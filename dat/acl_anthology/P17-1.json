An unexpected {``}side-effect{''} of such models is that their vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., \\textit{adding} two word-vectors results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., {``}man{''} + {``}royal{''} = {``}king{''}. This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. In particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the process generating the corpus. As a corollary, it explains the success of vector calculus in solving word analogies. When these assumptions do not hold, this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby: the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. This shows that Skip-Gram embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further, implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models can be used to fit SDR models.","pages":"69--76","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-1007","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-1007","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P17-1008","title":"The State of the Art in Semantic Representation","authors":["Abend, Omri","Rappoport, Ari"],"emails":["oabend@cs.huji.ac.il","arir@cs.huji.ac.il"],"author_id":["omri-abend","ari-rappoport"],"abstract":"Semantic representation is receiving growing attention in NLP in the past few years, and many proposals for semantic schemes (e.g., AMR, UCCA, GMB, UDS) have been put forth.

Question answering over knowledge base (KB-QA) is one of the promising approaches to access the substantial knowledge. Meanwhile, as the neural network-based (NN-based) methods develop, NN-based KB-QA has already achieved impressive results. However, previous work did not put more emphasis on question representation, and the question is converted into a fixed vector regardless of its candidate answers. This simple representation strategy is not easy to express the proper information in the question. Hence, we present an end-to-end neural network model to represent the questions and their corresponding scores dynamically according to the various candidate answer aspects via cross-attention mechanism. In addition, we leverage the global knowledge inside the underlying KB, aiming at integrating the rich KB information into the representation of the answers. As a result, it could alleviates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, which helps the cross-attention model to represent the question more precisely. The experimental results on WebQuestions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pages":"221--231","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-1021","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-1021","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P17-1022","title":"Translating Neuralese","authors":["Andreas, Jacob","Dragan, Anca","Klein, Dan"],"emails":["jda@cs.berkeley.edu","anca@cs.berkeley.edu","klein@cs.berkeley.edu"],"author_id":["jacob-andreas","anca-dragan","dan-klein"],"abstract":"Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized deep multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication channel.

In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised.

Grounded verb semantics are acquired mainly based on the parallel data of the use of a verb phrase and its corresponding sequences of primitive actions demonstrated by humans. The rich interaction between teachers and students that is considered important in learning new skills has not yet been explored. To address this limitation, this paper presents a new interactive learning approach that allows robots to proactively engage in interaction with human partners by asking good questions to learn models for grounded verb semantics. The proposed approach uses reinforcement learning to allow the robot to acquire an optimal policy for its question-asking behaviors by maximizing the long-term reward.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix.","pages":"2028--2036","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-1185","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-1185","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P17-1186","title":"Deep Multitask Learning for Semantic Dependency Parsing","authors":["Peng, Hao","Thomson, Sam","Smith, Noah A."],"emails":["hapeng@cs.washington.edu","sthomson@cs.cmu.edu","nasmith@cs.washington.edu"],"author_id":["hao-peng","sam-thomson","noah-a-smith"],"abstract":"We present a deep neural architecture that parses sentences into three semantic dependency graph formalisms.

Since sememes are not explicit for each word, people manually annotate word sememes and form linguistic common-sense knowledge bases. In this paper, we present that, word sememe information can improve word representation learning (WRL), which maps words into a low-dimensional semantic space and serves as a fundamental step for many NLP tasks. The key idea is to utilize word sememes to capture exact meanings of a word within specific contexts accurately. More specifically, we follow the framework of Skip-gram and present three sememe-encoded models to learn representations of sememes, senses and words, where we apply the attention scheme to detect word senses in various contexts. We conduct experiments on two tasks including word similarity and word analogy, and our models significantly outperform baselines. The results indicate that WRL can benefit from sememes via the attention scheme, and also confirm our models being capable of correctly modeling sememe information.","pages":"2049--2058","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-1187","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-1187","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P17-1188","title":"Learning Character-level Compositionality with Visual Features","authors":["Liu, Frederick","Lu, Han","Lo, Chieh","Neubig, Graham"],"emails":["fliu1@cs.cmu.edu","hlu2@cs.cmu.edu","chiehl@andrew.cmu.edu","gneubig@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["frederick-liu","han-lu","chieh-lo","graham-neubig"],"abstract":"Previous work has modeled the compositionality of words by creating character-level models of meaning, reducing problems of sparsity for rare words. However, in many writing systems compositionality has an effect even on the character-level: the meaning of a character is derived by the sum of its parts. In this paper, we model this effect by creating embeddings for characters based on their visual characteristics, creating an image for the character and running it through a convolutional neural network to produce a visual character embedding. Experiments on a text classification task demonstrate that such model allows for better processing of instances with rare characters in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Additionally, qualitative analyses demonstrate that our proposed model learns to focus on the parts of characters that carry topical content which resulting in embeddings that are coherent in visual space.","pages":"2059--2068","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-1188","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-1188","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P17-1189","title":"A Progressive Learning Approach to {C}hinese {SRL} Using Heterogeneous Data","authors":["Xia, Qiaolin","Sha, Lei","Chang, Baobao","Sui, Zhifang"],"emails":["xql@pku.edu.cn","shalei@pku.edu.cn","chbb@pku.edu.cn","szf@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["qiaolin-xia","lei-sha","baobao-chang","zhifang-sui"],"abstract":"Previous studies on Chinese semantic role labeling (SRL) have concentrated on a single semantically annotated corpus.

But still, Data sparsity remains a bottleneck. This situation calls for larger training datasets, or effective approaches which can take advantage of highly heterogeneous data. In this paper, we focus mainly on the latter, that is, to improve Chinese SRL by using heterogeneous corpora together. We propose a novel progressive learning model which augments the Progressive Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Adapters. The model can accommodate heterogeneous inputs and effectively transfer knowledge between them. We also release a new corpus, Chinese SemBank, for Chinese SRL.
