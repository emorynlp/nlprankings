Previous work has typically assumed richer but cognitively implausible input, such as POS tag annotated data, which makes that work less relevant to human language acquisition. We show that grammar induction from words alone is in fact feasible when the model is provided with sufficient training data, and present two new streaming or mini-batch algorithms for PCFG inference that can learn from millions of words of training data. We compare the performance of these algorithms to a batch algorithm that learns from less data. The minibatch algorithms outperform the batch algorithm, showing that cheap inference with more data is better than intensive inference with less data.

The fundamental theory of this work is that several words, such as symptom words (fever, headache, etc.), appear in advance of flu epidemic occurrence. Consequently, past word occurrence can contribute to estimation of the number of current patients. To employ such forecasting words, one can first estimate the optimal time lag for each word based on their cross correlation. Then one can build a linear model consisting of word frequencies at different time points for nowcasting and for forecasting influenza epidemics. Experimentally obtained results (using 7.7 million tweets of August 2012 {--} January 2016), the proposed model achieved the best nowcasting performance to date (correlation ratio 0.93) and practically sufficient forecasting performance (correlation ratio 0.91 in 1-week future prediction, and correlation ratio 0.77 in 3-weeks future prediction).

The comparison is usually done using Pearson correlation. In this work, we show that relying on intrinsic evaluations with Pearson correlation can be misleading. In three common STS based tasks we could observe that the Pearson correlation was especially ill-suited to detect the best STS system for the task and other evaluation measures were much better suited.

The translation of wordnets is fundamentally complex because of the need to translate all senses of a word including low frequency senses, which is very challenging for current machine translation approaches. For this reason we leverage existing translations of WordNet in other languages to identify contextual information for wordnet senses from a large set of generic parallel corpora. We evaluate our approach using 10 translated wordnets for European languages. Our experiment shows a significant improvement over translation without any contextual information.

We evaluate our model on two tasks: (i) bridge transliteration and (ii) bridge captioning.

We also induce embeddings to generalize over elementary tree structures and exploit a tree recurrence over the input structure to model long-distance influences between NLG choices. We evaluate the models on the task of linearizing unannotated dependency trees, documenting the contribution of our modeling techniques to improvements in both accuracy and run time.","pages":"224--235","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1022","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1023","title":"Abstractive News Summarization based on Event Semantic Link Network","authors":["Li, Wei","He, Lei","Zhuge, Hai"],"emails":["1weili.ict.kg@gmail.com","2hel2@aston.ac.uk","3zhuge@ict.ac.cn"],"author_id":["wei-li","lei-he","hai-zhuge"],"abstract":"This paper studies the abstractive multi-document summarization for event-oriented news texts through event information extraction and abstract representation.

Learning representations of words is a pioneering study in this school of research. However, paragraph (or sentence and document) embedding learning is more suitable\/reasonable for some tasks, such as sentiment classification and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we are aware, there is only a dearth of research focusing on launching unsupervised paragraph embedding methods. Classic paragraph embedding methods infer the representation of a given paragraph by considering all of the words occurring in the paragraph. Consequently, those stop or function words that occur frequently may mislead the embedding learning process to produce a misty paragraph representation. Motivated by these observations, our major contributions are twofold. First, we propose a novel unsupervised paragraph embedding method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at not only distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but also excluding the general background information to produce a more informative low-dimensional vector representation for the paragraph. We evaluate the proposed EV model on benchmark sentiment classification and multi-document summarization tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed embedding method. Second, in view of the increasing importance of spoken content processing, an extension of the EV model, named the denoising essence vector (D-EV) model, is proposed. The D-EV model not only inherits the advantages of the EV model but also can infer a more robust representation for a given spoken paragraph against imperfect speech recognition. The utility of the D-EV model is evaluated on a spoken document summarization task, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed embedding method in relation to several well-practiced and state-of-the-art summarization methods.","pages":"358--368","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1035","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1036","title":"Continuous Expressive Speaking Styles Synthesis based on {CVSM} and {MR}-{HMM}","authors":["Lorenzo-Trueba, Jaime","Barra-Chicote, Roberto","Gallardo-Antolin, Ascension","Yamagishi, Junichi","Montero, Juan M."],"emails":["jaime@nii.ac.jp","","","",""],"author_id":["jaime-lorenzo-trueba","roberto-barra-chicote","ascension-gallardo-antolin","junichi-yamagishi","juan-m-montero"],"abstract":"This paper introduces a continuous system capable of automatically producing the most adequate speaking style to synthesize a desired target text.

This makes it difficult to reach a satisfactory inter-annotator agreement during the annotation of gold standard annotations and, subsequently, to create consistent large scale annotations. To address this problem, we present an annotation schema for prominence and boundary labeling of prosodic phrases based upon acoustic parameters and a tagger for prosody annotation at the prosodic phrase level.

In this article, we propose a simple but efficient approach to bridge the lexical and orthographic differences between Hindi and Urdu texts. With respect to text processing, addressing the differences between the Hindi and Urdu texts would be beneficial in the following ways: (a) instead of training separate models, their individual resources can be augmented to train single, unified models for better generalization, and (b) their individual text processing applications can be used interchangeably under varied resource conditions. To remove the script barrier, we learn accurate statistical transliteration models which use sentence-level decoding to resolve word ambiguity. Similarly, we learn cross-register word embeddings from the harmonized Hindi and Urdu corpora to nullify their lexical divergences. As a proof of the concept, we evaluate our approach on the Hindi and Urdu dependency parsing under two scenarios: (a) resource sharing, and (b) resource augmentation. We demonstrate that a neural network-based dependency parser trained on augmented, harmonized Hindi and Urdu resources performs significantly better than the parsing models trained separately on the individual resources.

The scholarly interest of the topic can be attributed to the fact that Japanese loanwords undergo a complex series of phonological adaptations, something which has been puzzling scholars for decades. While previous studies of Japanese loanword accommodation have focused on specific phonological phenomena of limited scope, the current study leverages computational methods to provide a more complete description of all the sound changes that occur when adopting English words into Japanese. To investigate this, we have developed a parallel corpus of 250 English transcriptions and their respective Japanese equivalents. These words were then used to develop a wide-coverage finite state transducer based phonological grammar that mimics the behavior of the Japanese adaption process. By developing rules with the goal of accounting completely for a large number of borrowing and analyzing forms mistakenly generated by the system, we discovered an internal inconsistency inside the loanword phonology of the Japanese language, something arguably underestimated by previous studies. The result of the investigation suggests that there are multiple {`}dimensions{'} that shape the output form of the current Japanese loanwords.

Nevertheless, CNNA allows the visualisation of attention weights of words when making classification decisions and hence is more appropriate for the extraction of word subsequences describing ADRs.","pages":"877--887","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1084","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1085","title":"{C}hinese Preposition Selection for Grammatical Error Diagnosis","authors":["Huang, Hen-Hsen","Shao, Yen-Chi","Chen, Hsin-Hsi"],"emails":["hhhuang@nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw","ycshao@nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw","hhchen@ntu.edu.tw"],"author_id":["hen-hsen-huang","yen-chi-shao","hsin-hsi-chen"],"abstract":"Misuse of Chinese prepositions is one of common word usage errors in grammatical error diagnosis.

The technique has a wide range of applications such as rendering a quick glimpse of a document, or extracting key content for further use. While previous work often assumes keyphrases are a static property of a given documents, in many applications, the appropriate set of keyphrases that should be extracted depends on the set of documents that are being considered together. In particular, good keyphrases should not only accurately describe the content of a document, but also reveal what discriminates it from the other documents. In this paper, we study this problem of extracting discriminative keyphrases. In particularly, we propose to use the hierarchical semantic structure between candidate keyphrases to promote keyphrases that have the right level of specificity to clearly distinguish the target document from others. We show that such knowledge can be used to construct better discriminative keyphrase extraction systems that do not assume a static, fixed set of keyphrases for a document. We show how this helps identify key expertise of authors from their papers, as well as competencies covered by online courses within different domains.","pages":"932--942","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1089","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1090","title":"Hashtag Recommendation Using End-To-End Memory Networks with Hierarchical Attention","authors":["Huang, Haoran","Zhang, Qi","Gong, Yeyun","Huang, Xuanjing"],"emails":["huanghr15@fudan.edu.cn","qz@fudan.edu.cn","yygong12@fudan.edu.cn","xjhuang@fudan.edu.cn"],"author_id":["haoran-huang","qi-zhang","yeyun-gong","xuan-jing-huang"],"abstract":"On microblogging services, people usually use hashtags to mark microblogs, which have a specific theme or content, making them easier for users to find.

However, building the monolingual parallel corpus necessary for training the model requires costly human annotation. Monolingual parallel corpora for text simplification have therefore been built only for a limited number of languages, such as English and Portuguese. To obviate the need for human annotation, we propose an unsupervised method that automatically builds the monolingual parallel corpus for text simplification using sentence similarity based on word embeddings. For any sentence pair comprising a complex sentence and its simple counterpart, we employ a many-to-one method of aligning each word in the complex sentence with the most similar word in the simple sentence and compute sentence similarity by averaging these word similarities. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in a monolingual parallel corpus construction task for English text simplification. The results also demonstrated the superior accuracy in text simplification that use the framework of statistical machine translation trained using the corpus built by the proposed method to that using the existing corpora.","pages":"1147--1158","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1109","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1110","title":"{W}ord2{V}ec vs {DB}nary: Augmenting {METEOR} using Vector Representations or Lexical Resources?","authors":["Servan, Christophe","B{\\'e}rard, Alexandre","Elloumi, Zied","Blanchon, Herv{\\'e}","Besacier, Laurent"],"emails":["christophe.servan@imag.fr","alexandre.b{\\'e}rard@imag.fr","zied.elloumi@imag.fr","herv{\\'e}.blanchon@imag.fr","laurent.besacier@imag.fr"],"author_id":["christophe-servan","alexandre-berard","zied-elloumi","herve-blanchon","laurent-besacier"],"abstract":"This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed representations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT).

After this, a two-channel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.","pages":"1340--1349","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1127","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1128","title":"{C}hinese Hypernym-Hyponym Extraction from User Generated Categories","authors":["Wang, Chengyu","He, Xiaofeng"],"emails":["chywang2013@gmail.com","xfhe@sei.ecnu.edu.cn"],"author_id":["chengyu-wang","xiaofeng-he"],"abstract":"Hypernym-hyponym ({``}is-a{''}) relations are key components in taxonomies, object hierarchies and knowledge graphs.

However, for a given question, users sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or b) Deep Learning (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required feature representations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as - {``}Deep Feature Fusion Network (DFFN){''} which combines the advantages of both hand-crafted features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along with its metadata, the DFFN architecture independently - a) learns features from the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and b) computes hand-crafted features using various external resources and then combines them using a fully connected neural network trained to predict the final answer quality. DFFN is end-end differentiable and trained as a single system. We propose two different DFFN architectures which vary mainly in the way they model the input question\/answer pair - DFFN-CNN uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and DFFN-BLNA uses a Bi-directional LSTM with Neural Attention (BLNA). Both these proposed variants of DFFN (DFFN-CNN and DFFN-BLNA) achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 benchmark datasets and outperforms baseline approaches which individually employ either HCF or DL based techniques alone.","pages":"1429--1440","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1135","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1136","title":"Learning Event Expressions via Bilingual Structure Projection","authors":["Li, Fangyuan","Huang, Ruihong","Xiong, Deyi","Zhang, Min"],"emails":["fyli@stu.suda.edu.cn","huangrh@cse.tamu.edu","dyxiong@suda.edu.cn","minzhang@suda.edu.cn"],"author_id":["fangyuan-li","ruihong-huang","deyi-xiong","min-zhang"],"abstract":"Identifying events of a specific type is a challenging task as events in texts are described in numerous and diverse ways.

Thus, we combine (i) mid-sized high-quality manually crafted lexicons as seeds and (ii) bootstrapping, in order to build large-scale lexicons.","pages":"1557--1567","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1147","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1148","title":"Evaluating Argumentative and Narrative Essays using Graphs","authors":["Somasundaran, Swapna","Riordan, Brian","Gyawali, Binod","Yoon, Su-Youn"],"emails":["","","","oon@ets.org"],"author_id":["swapna-somasundaran","brian-riordan","binod-gyawali","su-youn-yoon"],"abstract":"This work investigates whether the development of ideas in writing can be captured by graph properties derived from the text.

This is especially the case when rare words occur. When using statistical machine translation, it has already been shown that significant gains can be achieved by simplifying the input in a preprocessing step. A commonly used example is the pre-reordering approach. In this work, we used phrase-based machine translation to pre-translate the input into the target language. Then a neural machine translation system generates the final hypothesis using the pre-translation. Thereby, we use either only the output of the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) system or a combination of the PBMT output and the source sentence. We evaluate the technique on the English to German translation task. Using this approach we are able to outperform the PBMT system as well as the baseline neural MT system by up to 2 BLEU points.

We evaluated the model on a corpus of political interviews, with encouraging results. The model predicts accurately the degree of cooperation for one of the two dialogue game roles (interviewer) and also the relative cooperation for both roles (i.e., which interlocutor in the conversation was most cooperative).

In this work, we develop a novel joint inference method that labels each utterance in a tutoring dialogue session with a dialogue act and a specific mode from a set of pre-defined dialogue acts and modes, respectively. Specifically, we develop our joint model using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), a framework that combines first-order logic with probabilities, and is thus capable of representing complex, uncertain knowledge. We define first-order formulas in our MLN that encode the inter-dependencies between dialogue modes and more fine-grained dialogue actions. We then use a joint inference to jointly label the modes as well as the dialogue acts in an utterance. We compare our system against a pipeline system based on SVMs on a real-world dataset with tutoring sessions of over 500 students. Our results show that the joint inference system is far more effective than the pipeline system in mode detection, and improves over the performance of the pipeline system by about 6 points in F1 score. The joint inference system also performs much better than the pipeline system in the context of labeling modes that highlight important pedagogical steps in tutoring.","pages":"2000--2011","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1188","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1189","title":"Dialogue Act Classification in Domain-Independent Conversations Using a Deep Recurrent Neural Network","authors":["Khanpour, Hamed","Guntakandla, Nishitha","Nielsen, Rodney"],"emails":["hamedkhanpour@my.unt.edu","nishithaguntakandla@my.unt.edu","rodney.nielsen@unt.edu"],"author_id":["hamed-khanpour","nishitha-guntakandla","rodney-nielsen"],"abstract":"In this study, we applied a deep LSTM structure to classify dialogue acts (DAs) in open-domain conversations.

These non-sentential questions may not make sense to the system when a user asks them without the context of conversation. The system thus needs to take into account the conversation context to process the question. In this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder decoder network that can generate a complete (intended) question, given an incomplete question and conversation context. RNN encoder decoder networks have been show to work well when trained on a parallel corpus with millions of sentences, however it is extremely hard to obtain conversation data of this magnitude. We therefore propose to decompose the original problem into two separate simplified problems where each problem focuses on an abstraction. Specifically, we train a semantic sequence model to learn semantic patterns, and a syntactic sequence model to learn linguistic patterns. We further combine syntactic and semantic sequence models to generate an ensemble model. Our model achieves a BLEU score of 30.15 as compared to 18.54 using a standard RNN encoder decoder model.","pages":"2022--2031","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1190","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1191","title":"Context-aware Natural Language Generation for Spoken Dialogue Systems","authors":["Zhou, Hao","Huang, Minlie","Zhu, Xiaoyan"],"emails":["tuxchow@gmail.com","aihuang@tsinghua.edu.cn","zxy-dcs@tsinghua.edu.cn"],"author_id":["hao-zhou","minlie-huang","xiaoyan-zhu"],"abstract":"Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component of question answering(QA) systems which has a significant impact on system quality.

While a plethora of methods have been traditionally employed for this task, majority focus has been on analyzing only aspect-centered local information. However, incorporating context information from non-local aspect neighbors may capture richer structure in review text and enhance prediction. This may especially be helpful to resolve ambiguous predictions. The context around an aspect can be incorporated using semantic relations within text and inter-label dependencies in the output. On the output side, this becomes a structured prediction task. However, non-local label correlations are computationally heavy and intractable to infer for structured prediction models like Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, some prior intuition is required to incorporate non-local context. Thus, inspired by previous research on multi-stage prediction, we propose a two-level model for aspect-based analysis. The proposed model uses predicted probability estimates from first level to incorporate neighbor information in the second level. The model is evaluated on data taken from SemEval Workshops and Bing Liu{'}s review collection. It shows comparatively better performance against few existing methods.

Commonsense knowledge also provides background information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task. Previous versions of SenticNet were focused on collecting this kind of knowledge for sentiment analysis but they were heavily limited by their inability to generalize. SenticNet 4 overcomes such limitations by leveraging on conceptual primitives automatically generated by means of hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction.","pages":"2666--2677","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1251","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1252","title":"Joint Embedding of Hierarchical Categories and Entities for Concept Categorization and Dataless Classification","authors":["Li, Yuezhang","Zheng, Ronghuo","Tian, Tian","Hu, Zhiting","Iyer, Rahul","Sycara, Katia"],"emails":["","","","yuezhanl@andrew.cmu.edu","",""],"author_id":["yuezhang-li","ronghuo-zheng","tian-tian","zhiting-hu","rahul-iyer","katia-sycara"],"abstract":"Existing work learning distributed representations of knowledge base entities has largely failed to incorporate rich categorical structure, and is unable to induce category representations.

In this paper, we compare both, visual and linguistic representations in their ability to capture different types of fine-grain semantic knowledge{---}or attributes{---}of concepts. Humans often describe objects using attributes, that is, properties such as shape, color or functionality, which often transcend the linguistic and visual modalities.

To address the above two issues, this pa-per proposes a graph-based method, which can discover inference rules by effectively modelling and exploiting both the context and the inter-dependencies between predicates. Specifically, we propose a graph-based representation{---}Predicate Graph, which can capture the semantic relevance between predicates using both the predicate-feature co-occurrence statistics and the inter-dependencies between predicates. Based on the predicate graph, we propose a context-sensitive random walk algorithm, which can learn con-text-specific predicate representations by distinguishing context-relevant information from context-irrelevant information. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms traditional inference rule discovery methods.","pages":"2902--2911","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1273","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1274","title":"Modelling Sentence Pairs with Tree-structured Attentive Encoder","authors":["Zhou, Yao","Liu, Cong","Pan, Yan"],"emails":["yoosan.zhou@gmail.com","liucong3@mail.sysu.edu.cn","panyan5@mail.sysu.edu.cn"],"author_id":["yao-zhou","cong-liu","yan-pan"],"abstract":"We describe an attentive encoder that combines tree-structured recursive neural networks and sequential recurrent neural networks for modelling sentence pairs.

To address the challenges mentioned above, we focus on learning high-level features that are able to generalize across domains, so a global classifier can benefit with a simple combination of documents from multiple domains. In this paper, the proposed model incorporates both sentiment polarity and unlabeled data from multiple domains and learns new feature representations. Our model doesn{'}t require labels from every domain, which means the learned feature representation can be generalized for sentiment domain adaptation. In addition, the learned feature representation can be used as classifier since our model defines the meaning of feature value and arranges high-level features in a prefixed order, so it is not necessary to train another classifier on top of the new features.

Often, reference-based evaluation measures (such as BLEU or WER) are appealing because they are cheap and allow rapid quantitative comparison. On the other hand, practitioners often focus on manual evaluation because they must deal with frequently changing domains and quality standards requested by customers, for which reference-based evaluation is insufficient or not possible due to missing in-domain reference data (Harris et al., 2016). In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for lightly supervised quality estimation. We collect manually annotated scores for a small number of segments in a test corpus or document, and combine them with automatically predicted quality scores for the remaining segments to predict an overall quality estimate.

Human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is by far the most widely employed human-targeted metric in machine translation, commonly employed, for example, as a gold standard in evaluation of quality estimation. Original experiments justifying the design of HTER, as opposed to other possible formulations, were limited to a small sample of translations and a single language pair, however, and this motivates our re-evaluation of a range of human-targeted metrics on a substantially larger scale. Results show significantly stronger correlation with human judgment for HBLEU over HTER for two of the nine language pairs we include and no significant difference between correlations achieved by HTER and HBLEU for the remaining language pairs. Finally, we evaluate a range of quality estimation systems employing HTER and direct assessment (DA) of translation adequacy as gold labels, resulting in a divergence in system rankings, and propose employment of DA for future quality estimation evaluations.","pages":"3124--3134","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1294","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1295","title":"Connecting Phrase based Statistical Machine Translation Adaptation","authors":["Wang, Rui","Zhao, Hai","Lu, Bao-Liang","Utiyama, Masao","Sumita, Eiichiro"],"emails":["wangrui.nlp@gmail.com","zhaohai@cs.sjtu.edu.cn","blu@cs.sjtu.edu.cn","mutiyama@nict.go.jp","eiichiro.sumita@nict.go.jp"],"author_id":["rui-wang","hai-zhao","bao-liang-lu","masao-utiyama","eiichiro-sumita"],"abstract":"Although more additional corpora are now available for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), only the ones which belong to the same or similar domains of the original corpus can indeed enhance SMT performance directly.

This allows for untranslatable source words to remain unaligned and at the same time avoids the introduction of artificial NULL words which introduces unusually long alignment jumps. Existing Bayesian word alignment models are unpractically slow because they consider each target position when resampling a given alignment link. The sampling complexity therefore grows linearly in the target sentence length. In order to make our model useful in practice, we devise an auxiliary variable Gibbs sampler that allows us to resample alignment links in constant time independently of the target sentence length.

A common, major challenge in applying such topic models to other tasks is to accurately interpret the meaning of each topic. Topic labeling, as a major interpreting method, has attracted significant attention recently. However, most of previous works only focus on the effectiveness of topic labeling, and less attention has been paid to quickly creating good topic descriptors; meanwhile, it{'}s hard to assign labels for new emerging topics by using most of existing methods. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose a novel fast topic labeling framework that casts the labeling problem as a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) search problem in a probability vector set. Our experimental results show that the proposed sequential interleaving method based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) technology is efficient in boosting the comparison speed among probability distributions, and the proposed framework can generate meaningful labels to interpret topics, including new emerging topics.","pages":"3339--3348","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1315","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1316","title":"Sequence to Backward and Forward Sequences: A Content-Introducing Approach to Generative Short-Text Conversation","authors":["Mou, Lili","Song, Yiping","Yan, Rui","Li, Ge","Zhang, Lu","Jin, Zhi"],"emails":["doublepower.mou@gmail.com","songyiping@pku.edu.cn","ruiyan@pku.edu.cn","lige@pku.edu.cn","zhanglucs@pku.edu.cn","zhijin@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["lili-mou","yiping-song","rui-yan","ge-li","lu-zhang","zhi-jin"],"abstract":"Using neural networks to generate replies in human-computer dialogue systems is attracting increasing attention over the past few years.

Currently, the feasibility of this end goal is limited by several gaps in both the empirical and computational literature. The purpose of this paper is to address those gaps in the following ways: (1) investigate which properties of task-oriented discourse correspond with effective performance in human teams, and (2) discuss how and to what extent these properties can be utilized in spoken dialogue systems. To this end, we analyzed natural language data from a unique corpus of spontaneous, task-oriented dialogue (CReST corpus), which was annotated for disfluencies and conversational moves. We found that effective teams made more self-repair disfluencies and used specific communication strategies to facilitate grounding and coordination. Our results indicate that truly robust and natural dialogue systems will need to interpret highly disfluent utterances and also utilize specific collaborative mechanisms to facilitate grounding. These data shed light on effective communication in performance scenarios and directly inform the development of robust dialogue systems for situated artificial agents.","pages":"3359--3369","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1317","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1318","title":"A Neural Network Approach for Knowledge-Driven Response Generation","authors":["Vougiouklis, Pavlos","Hare, Jonathon","Simperl, Elena"],"emails":["pv1e13@ecs.soton.ac.uk","jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk","e.simperl@ecs.soton.ac.uk"],"author_id":["pavlos-vougiouklis","jonathon-hare","elena-simperl"],"abstract":"We present a novel response generation system.

Accordingly, we alias the former to the frame TURN.01 and the latter to a group of frames that includes FILM.01 and SHOOT.03. We execute a large-scale manual aliasing effort for three target languages and apply the new lexicons to automatically generate large Proposition Banks for Chinese, French and German with manually curated frames.

RNN can utilize distributed representations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each text into vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: the time-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing models usually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based operation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector. However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually independent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step dimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature representation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional (2D) pooling operation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features for sequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of the matrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain a fixed-length representation of the text. This paper also utilizes 2D convolution to sample more meaningful information of the matrix. Experiments are conducted on six text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, question classification, subjectivity classification and newsgroup classification.

Our system, consisting of a ResNet and an auxiliary loss function predicting our semantic tags, significantly outperforms prior results on English Universal Dependencies POS tagging (95.71{\\%} accuracy on UD v1.2 and 95.67{\\%} accuracy on UD v1.3).","pages":"3531--3541","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1333","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1334","title":"A Supervised Approach for Enriching the Relational Structure of Frame Semantics in {F}rame{N}et","authors":["Virk, Shafqat Mumtaz","Muller, Philippe","Conrath, Juliette"],"emails":["","",""],"author_id":["shafqat-mumtaz-virk","philippe-muller","juliette-conrath"],"abstract":"Frame semantics is a theory of linguistic meanings, and is considered to be a useful framework for shallow semantic analysis of natural language. FrameNet, which is based on frame semantics, is a popular lexical semantic resource. In addition to providing a set of core semantic frames and their frame elements, FrameNet also provides relations between those frames (hence providing a network of frames i.e. FrameNet). We address here the limited coverage of the network of conceptual relations between frames in FrameNet, which has previously been pointed out by others. We present a supervised model using rich features from three different sources: structural features from the existing FrameNet network, information from the WordNet relations between synsets projected into semantic frames, and corpus-collected lexical associations. We show large improvements over baselines consisting of each of the three groups of features in isolation. We then use this model to select frame pairs as candidate relations, and perform evaluation on a sample with good precision.","pages":"3542--3552","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1334","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1335","title":"{R}eddit Temporal N-gram Corpus and its Applications on Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity in Social Media using a Topic-based Latent Semantic Analysis","authors":["Dang, Anh","Moh{'}d, Abidalrahman","Islam, Aminul","Minghim, Rosane","Smit, Michael","Milios, Evangelos"],"emails":["anh@cs.dal.ca","amohd@cs.dal.ca","2aminul@louisiana.edu","3rminghim@icmc.usp.br","4mike.smit@dal.ca","eem@cs.dal.ca"],"author_id":["anh-dang","abidalrahman-mohd","aminul-islam","rosane-minghim","michael-smit","evangelos-milios"],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new large-scale n-gram corpus that is created specifically from social media text. Two distinguishing characteristics of this corpus are its monthly temporal attribute and that it is created from 1.65 billion comments of user-generated text in Reddit. The usefulness of this corpus is exemplified and evaluated by a novel Topic-based Latent Semantic Analysis (TLSA) algorithm. The experimental results show that unsupervised TLSA outperforms all the state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised methods in SEMEVAL 2015: paraphrase and semantic similarity in Twitter tasks.","pages":"3553--3564","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1335","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"},{"id":"C16-1336","title":"Dictionaries as Networks: Identifying the graph structure of Ogden{'}s Basic {E}nglish","authors":["Garrido, Camilo","Gutierrez, Claudio"],"emails":["cgarrido@dcc.uchile.cl","cgutierr@dcc.uchile.cl"],"author_id":["camilo-garrido","claudio-gutierrez"],"abstract":"We study the network structure underlying dictionaries.

Our approach jointly models global lexical, local lexical and dependency syntactic context. Each context type is associated with a latent variable and the three types of variables share a hierarchical structure. We use skip-gram based word and dependency context embeddings to construct all three types of representations, reducing the total number of parameters to be estimated and enabling better generalization. We describe an EM algorithm to efficiently estimate model parameters and use the Integrated Complete Likelihood criterion to automatically estimate the number of senses. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the SemEval-2010 and SemEval-2013 Word Sense Induction datasets.","pages":"3577--3587","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C16-1337","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers"}]
