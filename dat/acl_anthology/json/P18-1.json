This representation allows the model to share the {``}strength{''} across sub-word structures (e.g. Latin roots), producing accurate representations of rare, misspelt, or even unseen words. Moreover, each component of the mixture can capture a different word sense. Probabilistic FastText outperforms both FastText, which has no probabilistic model, and dictionary-level probabilistic embeddings, which do not incorporate subword structures, on several word-similarity benchmarks, including English RareWord and foreign language datasets. We also achieve state-of-art performance on benchmarks that measure ability to discern different meanings. Thus, our model is the first to achieve best of both the worlds: multi-sense representations while having enriched semantics on rare words.","pages":"1--11","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P18-1001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P18-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P18-1002","title":"A La Carte Embedding: Cheap but Effective Induction of Semantic Feature Vectors","authors":["Khodak, Mikhail","Saunshi, Nikunj","Liang, Yingyu","Ma, Tengyu","Stewart, Brandon","Arora, Sanjeev"],"emails":["mkhodak@princeton.edu","nsaunshi@princeton.edu","yliang@cs.wisc.edu","tengyuma@stanford.edu","bms4@princeton.edu","arora@princeton.edu"],"author_id":["mikhail-khodak","nikunj-saunshi","yingyu-liang","tengyu-ma","brandon-m-stewart","sanjeev-arora"],"abstract":"Motivations like domain adaptation, transfer learning, and feature learning have fueled interest in inducing embeddings for rare or unseen words, n-grams, synsets, and other textual features.

Ideally, modeling useful information of preceding potential antecedents is crucial for classifying later zero pronoun-candidate antecedent pairs, a need which leads traditional models of zero pronoun resolution to draw on reinforcement learning.

Towards this goal, this paper introduces a new task on naive physical action-effect prediction, which addresses the relations between concrete actions (expressed in the form of verb-noun pairs) and their effects on the state of the physical world as depicted by images. We collected a dataset for this task and developed an approach that harnesses web image data through distant supervision to facilitate learning for action-effect prediction. Our empirical results have shown that web data can be used to complement a small number of seed examples (e.g., three examples for each action) for model learning.

Building upon variational autoencoders (VAEs), we present two novel models, DI-VAE and DI-VST that improve VAEs and can discover interpretable semantics via either auto encoding or context predicting. Our methods have been validated on real-world dialog datasets to discover semantic representations and enhance encoder-decoder models with interpretable generation.","pages":"1098--1107","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P18-1101","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P18-1101","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P18-1102","title":"Learning to Control the Specificity in Neural Response Generation","authors":["Zhang, Ruqing","Guo, Jiafeng","Fan, Yixing","Lan, Yanyan","Xu, Jun","Cheng, Xueqi"],"emails":["zhangruqing@software.ict.ac.cn","guojiafeng@ict.ac.cn","fanyixing@software.ict.ac.cn","lanyanyan@ict.ac.cn","junxu@ict.ac.cn","cxq@ict.ac.cn"],"author_id":["ruqing-zhang","jiafeng-guo","yixing-fan","yanyan-lan","jun-xu","xueqi-cheng"],"abstract":"In conversation, a general response (e.g., {``}I don{'}t know{''}) could correspond to a large variety of input utterances.

To address this problem, we propose a novel controlled response generation mechanism to handle different utterance-response relationships in terms of specificity. Specifically, we introduce an explicit specificity control variable into a sequence-to-sequence model, which interacts with the usage representation of words through a Gaussian Kernel layer, to guide the model to generate responses at different specificity levels.

In this paper, we measure cross-lingual syntactic variation, or anisomorphism, in the UD treebank collection, considering both morphological and structural properties. We show that reducing the level of anisomorphism yields consistent gains in cross-lingual transfer tasks. We introduce a source language selection procedure that facilitates effective cross-lingual parser transfer, and propose a typologically driven method for syntactic tree processing which reduces anisomorphism.

We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language understanding and incorporating external background knowledge. Additionally, the narrative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive passages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences.

Differently from statistical machine translation, the associations between source words and their possible target counterparts are not explicitly stored. Source and target words are at the two ends of a long information processing procedure, mediated by hidden states at both the source encoding and the target decoding phases. This makes it possible that a source word is incorrectly translated into a target word that is not any of its admissible equivalent counterparts in the target language. In this paper, we seek to somewhat shorten the distance between source and target words in that procedure, and thus strengthen their association, by means of a method we term bridging source and target word embeddings. We experiment with three strategies: (1) a source-side bridging model, where source word embeddings are moved one step closer to the output target sequence; (2) a target-side bridging model, which explores the more relevant source word embeddings for the prediction of the target sequence; and (3) a direct bridging model, which directly connects source and target word embeddings seeking to minimize errors in the translation of ones by the others. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed bridging models are able to significantly improve quality of both sentence translation, in general, and alignment and translation of individual source words with target words, in particular.","pages":"1767--1776","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P18-1164","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P18-1164","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P18-1165","title":"Reliability and Learnability of Human Bandit Feedback for Sequence-to-Sequence Reinforcement Learning","authors":["Kreutzer, Julia","Uyheng, Joshua","Riezler, Stefan"],"emails":["kreutzer@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","juyheng@ateneo.edu","riezler@cl.uni-heidelberg.de"],"author_id":["julia-kreutzer","joshua-uyheng","stefan-riezler"],"abstract":"We present a study on reinforcement learning (RL) from human bandit feedback for sequence-to-sequence learning, exemplified by the task of bandit neural machine translation (NMT).

The average attention network consists of two layers, with an average layer that models dependencies on previous positions and a gating layer that is stacked over the average layer to enhance the expressiveness of the proposed attention network. We apply this network on the decoder part of the neural Transformer to replace the original target-side self-attention model.

Making use of this language we show in experiments that one can bring recurrent and convolutional models very close to the Transformer performance by borrowing concepts from the Transformer architecture, but not using self-attention.

In this work we propose that in closed worlds with clear semantic types, one can substantially alleviate these problems by utilizing an abstract representation, where tokens in both the language utterance and program are lifted to an abstract form. We show that these abstractions can be defined with a handful of lexical rules and that they result in sharing between different examples that alleviates the difficulties in training. To test our approach, we develop the first semantic parser for CNLVR, a challenging visual reasoning dataset, where the search space is large and overcoming spuriousness is critical, because denotations are either TRUE or FALSE, and thus random programs are likely to lead to a correct denotation.

We contribute a novel aggregation model of derived word generation that learns derivational transformations both as orthographic functions using sequence-to-sequence models and as functions in distributional word embedding space. The model then learns to choose between the hypothesis of each system. We also present two ways of incorporating corpus information into derived word generation.","pages":"1938--1947","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P18-1180","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P18-1180","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P18-1181","title":"Deep-speare: A joint neural model of poetic language, meter and rhyme","authors":["Lau, Jey Han","Cohn, Trevor","Baldwin, Timothy","Brooke, Julian","Hammond, Adam"],"emails":["jeyhan.lau@gmail.com","t.cohn@unimelb.edu.au","tb@ldwin.net","julian.brooke@gmail.com","adam.hammond@utoronto.ca"],"author_id":["jey-han-lau","trevor-cohn","timothy-baldwin","julian-brooke","adam-hammond"],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a joint architecture that captures language, rhyme and meter for sonnet modelling.

To address these issues, we present Deep Dyna-Q, which to our knowledge is the first deep RL framework that integrates planning for task-completion dialogue policy learning. We incorporate into the dialogue agent a model of the environment, referred to as the world model, to mimic real user response and generate simulated experience.

One such source of cognitive information is gaze behaviour. In this paper, we show that gaze behaviour does indeed help in effectively predicting the rating of text quality. To do this, we first we model text quality as a function of three properties - organization, coherence and cohesion. Then, we demonstrate how capturing gaze behaviour helps in predicting each of these properties, and hence the overall quality, by reporting improvements obtained by adding gaze features to traditional textual features for score prediction. We also hypothesize that if a reader has fully understood the text, the corresponding gaze behaviour would give a better indication of the assigned rating, as opposed to partial understanding. Our experiments validate this hypothesis by showing greater agreement between the given rating and the predicted rating when the reader has a full understanding of the text.","pages":"2352--2362","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P18-1219","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P18-1219","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"},{"id":"P18-1220","title":"Multi-Input Attention for Unsupervised {OCR} Correction","authors":["Dong, Rui","Smith, David"],"emails":["dongrui@ccs.neu.edu","dasmith@ccs.neu.edu"],"author_id":["rui-dong","david-a-smith"],"abstract":"We propose a novel approach to OCR post-correction that exploits repeated texts in large corpora both as a source of noisy target outputs for unsupervised training and as a source of evidence when decoding.

In this paper we propose a method for cross-lingual morphological tagging that aims to improve information sharing between languages by relaxing this assumption. The proposed model uses factorial conditional random fields with neural network potentials, making it possible to (1) utilize the expressive power of neural network representations to smooth over superficial differences in the surface forms, (2) model pairwise and transitive relationships between tags, and (3) accurately generate tag sets that are unseen or rare in the training data.
