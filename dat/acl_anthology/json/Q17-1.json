However, promoting end-user understanding of topics remains an open research problem. We compare labels generated by users given four topic visualization techniques{---}word lists, word lists with bars, word clouds, and network graphs{---}against each other and against automatically generated labels. Our basis of comparison is participant ratings of how well labels describe documents from the topic. Our study has two phases: a labeling phase where participants label visualized topics and a validation phase where different participants select which labels best describe the topics{'} documents. Although all visualizations produce similar quality labels, simple visualizations such as word lists allow participants to quickly understand topics, while complex visualizations take longer but expose multi-word expressions that simpler visualizations obscure. Automatic labels lag behind user-created labels, but our dataset of manually labeled topics highlights linguistic patterns (e.g., hypernyms, phrases) that can be used to improve automatic topic labeling algorithms.","pages":"1--16","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00042","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q17-1001","year":"2017","volume":"5","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q17-1002","title":"Visually Grounded and Textual Semantic Models Differentially Decode Brain Activity Associated with Concrete and Abstract Nouns","authors":["Anderson, Andrew J.","Kiela, Douwe","Clark, Stephen","Poesio, Massimo"],"emails":["aander41@ur.rochester.edu","dk427@cam.ac.uk","sc609@cam.ac.uk","poesio@essex.ac.uk"],"author_id":["andrew-j-anderson","douwe-kiela","stephen-clark","massimo-poesio"],"abstract":"Important advances have recently been made using computational semantic models to decode brain activity patterns associated with concepts; however, this work has almost exclusively focused on concrete nouns.

We address this question by applying state-of-the-art computational models to decode functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activity patterns, elicited by participants reading and imagining a diverse set of both concrete and abstract nouns. One of the models we use is linguistic, exploiting the recent word2vec skipgram approach trained on Wikipedia. The second is visually grounded, using deep convolutional neural networks trained on Google Images. Dual coding theory considers concrete concepts to be encoded in the brain both linguistically and visually, and abstract concepts only linguistically. Splitting the fMRI data according to human concreteness ratings, we indeed observe that both models significantly decode the most concrete nouns; however, accuracy is significantly greater using the text-based models for the most abstract nouns. More generally this confirms that current computational models are sufficiently advanced to assist in investigating the representational structure of abstract concepts in the brain.","pages":"17--30","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00043","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q17-1002","year":"2017","volume":"5","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q17-1003","title":"Modeling Semantic Expectation: Using Script Knowledge for Referent Prediction","authors":["Modi, Ashutosh","Titov, Ivan","Demberg, Vera","Sayeed, Asad","Pinkal, Manfred"],"emails":["ashutosh@coli.uni-saarland.de","titov@uva.nl","vera@coli.uni-saarland.de","asayeed@coli.uni-saarland.de","pinkal@coli.uni-saarland.de"],"author_id":["ashutosh-modi","ivan-titov","vera-demberg","asad-sayeed","manfred-pinkal"],"abstract":"Recent research in psycholinguistics has provided increasing evidence that humans predict upcoming content.

The graph formulation provides a unified way of exploring different LSTM approaches and incorporating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies, such as sequential, syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual representation is learned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation classifier. This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enables multi-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in two important precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both conventional supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentence extraction produced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learning significantly improved extraction accuracy.

In CxG, a construction is a form\/function pairing that can rely on arbitrary linguistic and semantic features. Rather than codifying all aspects of each construction{'}s form, as some attempts to employ CxG in NLP have done, we propose methods that offload that problem to machine learning.

The parsing strategies differ in terms of the order in which they recognize productions in the derivation tree, where bottom-up strategies and top-down strategies take post-order and pre-order traversal over trees, respectively. Bottom-up parsers benefit from rich features from readily built partial parses, but lack lookahead guidance in the parsing process; top-down parsers benefit from non-local guidance for local decisions, but rely on a strong encoder over the input to predict a constituent hierarchy before its construction. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel parsing system based on in-order traversal over syntactic trees, designing a set of transition actions to find a compromise between bottom-up constituent information and top-down lookahead information. Based on stack-LSTM, our psycholinguistically motivated constituent parsing system achieves 91.8 F1 on the WSJ benchmark.
