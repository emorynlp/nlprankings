ZSDG requires an end-to-end generative dialog system to generalize to a new domain for which only a domain description is provided and no training dialogs are available. Then a novel learning framework, Action Matching, is proposed. This algorithm can learn a cross-domain embedding space that models the semantics of dialog responses which in turn, enables a neural dialog generation model to generalize to new domains. We evaluate our methods on two datasets, a new synthetic dialog dataset, and an existing human-human multi-domain dialog dataset. Experimental results show that our method is able to achieve superior performance in learning dialog models that can rapidly adapt their behavior to new domains and suggests promising future research.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5002","title":"Changing the Level of Directness in Dialogue using Dialogue Vector Models and Recurrent Neural Networks","authors":["Pragst, Louisa","Ultes, Stefan"],"emails":["louisa.pragst@uni-ulm.de","su259@cam.ac.uk"],"author_id":["louisa-pragst","stefan-ultes"],"abstract":"In cooperative dialogues, identifying the intent of ones conversation partner and acting accordingly is of great importance. While this endeavour is facilitated by phrasing intentions as directly as possible, we can observe in human-human communication that a number of factors such as cultural norms and politeness may result in expressing one{'}s intent indirectly. Therefore, in human-computer communication we have to anticipate the possibility of users being indirect and be prepared to interpret their actual meaning. Furthermore, a dialogue system should be able to conform to human expectations by adjusting the degree of directness it uses to improve the user experience. To reach those goals, we propose an approach to differentiate between direct and indirect utterances and find utterances of the opposite characteristic that express the same intent. In this endeavour, we employ dialogue vector models and recurrent neural networks.","pages":"11--19","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5002","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5002","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5003","title":"Modeling Linguistic and Personality Adaptation for Natural Language Generation","authors":["Hu, Zhichao","Fox Tree, Jean","Walker, Marilyn"],"emails":["zhu@ucsc.edu","foxtree@ucsc.edu","mawalker@ucsc.edu"],"author_id":["zhichao-hu","jean-e-fox-tree","marilyn-walker"],"abstract":"Previous work has shown that conversants adapt to many aspects of their partners{'} language.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to maximize SLU performances, especially for small training data sets. To this aim, we propose a novel CRF-based dialog act selector which chooses suitable dialog acts from outputs of RNN SLU and rule-based SLU. We evaluate the selector by using DSTC2 corpus when RNN SLU is trained by less than 1,000 training sentences. The evaluation demonstrates the selector achieves Micro F1 better than both RNN and rule-based SLUs. In addition, it shows the selector achieves better Macro F1 than RNN SLU and the same Macro F1 as rule-based SLU. Thus, we confirmed our method offers advantages in SLU performances for small training data sets.","pages":"366--370","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5043","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5043","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5044","title":"An Analysis of the Effect of Emotional Speech Synthesis on Non-Task-Oriented Dialogue System","authors":["Chiba, Yuya","Nose, Takashi","Kase, Taketo","Yamanaka, Mai","Ito, Akinori"],"emails":["","","","",""],"author_id":["yuya-chiba","takashi-nose","taketo-kase","mai-yamanaka","akinori-ito"],"abstract":"This paper explores the effect of emotional speech synthesis on a spoken dialogue system when the dialogue is non-task-oriented. Although the use of emotional speech responses have been shown to be effective in a limited domain, e.g., scenario-based and counseling dialogue, the effect is still not clear in the non-task-oriented dialogue such as voice chatting. For this purpose, we constructed a simple dialogue system with example- and rule-based dialogue management. In the system, two types of emotion labeling with emotion estimation are adopted, i.e., system-driven and user-cooperative emotion labeling. We conducted a dialogue experiment where subjects evaluate the subjective quality of the system and the dialogue from the multiple aspects such as richness of the dialogue and impression of the agent. We then analyze and discuss the results and show the advantage of using appropriate emotions for the expressive speech responses in the non-task-oriented system.","pages":"371--375","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5044","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5044","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5045","title":"Multi-task Learning for Joint Language Understanding and Dialogue State Tracking","authors":["Rastogi, Abhinav","Gupta, Raghav","Hakkani-Tur, Dilek"],"emails":["abhirast@google.com","raghavgupta@google.com","dilek@ieee.org"],"author_id":["abhinav-rastogi","raghav-gupta","dilek-hakkani-tur"],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task learning of language understanding (LU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems. Multi-task training enables the sharing of the neural network layers responsible for encoding the user utterance for both LU and DST and improves performance while reducing the number of network parameters. In our proposed framework, DST operates on a set of candidate values for each slot that has been mentioned so far. These candidate sets are generated using LU slot annotations for the current user utterance, dialogue acts corresponding to the preceding system utterance and the dialogue state estimated for the previous turn, enabling DST to handle slots with a large or unbounded set of possible values and deal with slot values not seen during training. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and inference, we investigate the use of scheduled sampling on LU output for the current user utterance as well as the DST output for the preceding turn.","pages":"376--384","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5045","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5045","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5046","title":"Weighting Model Based on Group Dynamics to Measure Convergence in Multi-party Dialogue","authors":["Rahimi, Zahra","Litman, Diane"],"emails":["zar10@pitt.edu","litman@cs.pitt.edu"],"author_id":["zahra-rahimi","diane-litman"],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new weighting method for extending a dyad-level measure of convergence to multi-party dialogues by considering group dynamics instead of simply averaging.

To address this issue, in this paper, a novel concept transfer learning approach is proposed. Here, substructures within literal concept definition are investigated to reveal the relationship between concepts. A hierarchical semantic representation for concepts is proposed, where a semantic slot is represented as a composition of \\textit{atomic concepts}. Based on this new hierarchical representation, transfer learning approaches are developed for adaptive LU. The approaches are applied to two tasks: value set mismatch and domain adaptation, and evaluated on two LU benchmarks: ATIS and DSTC 2{\\&}3. Thorough empirical studies validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art performance (F\u2081-score 96.08{\\%}) on ATIS by only using lexicon features.","pages":"391--399","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5047","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5047","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5048","title":"{C}ogent: A Generic Dialogue System Shell Based on a Collaborative Problem Solving Model","authors":["Galescu, Lucian","Teng, Choh Man","Allen, James","Perera, Ian"],"emails":["lgalescu@ihmc.us","cmteng@ihmc.us","jallen@ihmc.us","iperera@ihmc.us"],"author_id":["lucian-galescu","choh-man-teng","james-allen","ian-perera"],"abstract":"The bulk of current research in dialogue systems is focused on fairly simple task models, primarily state-based.

In this paper we report on our development from the ground up of a new dialogue model based on collaborative problem solving. We implemented the model in a dialogue system shell (Cogent) that al-lows developers to plug in problem-solving agents to create dialogue systems in new domains. The Cogent shell has now been used by several independent teams of researchers to develop dialogue systems in different domains, with varied lexicons and interaction style, each with their own problem-solving back-end. We believe this to be the first practical demonstration of the feasibility of a CPS-based dialogue system shell.","pages":"400--409","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5048","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5048","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"},{"id":"W18-5049","title":"Identifying Domain Independent Update Intents in Task Based Dialogs","authors":["Biyani, Prakhar","Akkaya, Cem","Tsioutsiouliklis, Kostas"],"emails":["pbiyani@twitter.com","cakkaya@oath.com","kostas@oath.com"],"author_id":["prakhar-biyani","cem-akkaya","kostas-tsioutsiouliklis"],"abstract":"One important problem in task-based conversations is that of effectively updating the belief estimates of user-mentioned slot-value pairs. Given a user utterance, the intent of a slot-value pair is captured using dialog acts (DA) expressed in that utterance. However, in certain cases, DA{'}s fail to capture the actual update intent of the user. In this paper, we describe such cases and propose a new type of semantic class for user intents. This new type, Update Intents (UI), is directly related to the type of update a user intends to perform for a slot-value pair. We define five types of UI{'}s, which are independent of the domain of the conversation. We build a multi-class classification model using LSTM{'}s to identify the type of UI in user utterances in the Restaurant and Shopping domains. Experimental results show that our models achieve strong classification performance in terms of F-1 score.","pages":"410--419","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5049","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5049","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue"}]
