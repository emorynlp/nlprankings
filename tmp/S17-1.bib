  abstract  = {Analogy completion via vector arithmetic has become a common means of
	demonstrating the compositionality of word embeddings. Previous work have shown
	that this strategy works more reliably for certain types of analogical word
	relationships than for others, but these studies have not offered a convincing
	account for why this is the case. We arrive at such an account through an
	experiment that targets a wide variety of analogy questions and defines a
	baseline condition to more accurately measure the efficacy of our system. We
	find that the most reliably solvable analogy categories involve either 1) the
	application of a morpheme with clear syntactic effects, 2) male--female
	alternations, or 3) named entities. These broader types do not pattern cleanly
	along a syntactic--semantic divide. We suggest instead that their commonality
	is distributional, in that the difference between the distributions of two
	words in any given pair encompasses a relatively small number of word types.
	Our study offers a needed explanation for why analogy tests succeed and fail
	where they do and provides nuanced insight into the relationship between word
	distributions and the theoretical linguistic domains of syntax and semantics.},

	representations learned with different architectures (sensitive to the order of

	Sentiment results from the (recursive) composition of lexical items and
	grammatical strategies such as negation and concession. The results are
	manifold: we show that there is no `one-size-fits-all' representation
	architecture outperforming the others across the board. Rather, the top-ranking
	architectures depend on the language at hand. Moreover, we find that in several
	cases the additive composition model based on skip-gram word vectors may
	surpass supervised state-of-art architectures such as bi-directional LSTMs.
	Finally, we provide a possible explanation of the observed variation based on
	the type of negative constructions in each language.},

  abstract  = {We consider the semantics of prepositions, revisiting a broad-coverage
	annotation scheme used for annotating all 4,250 preposition tokens in a 55,000
	word corpus of English. Attempts to apply the scheme to adpositions and case
	markers in other languages, as well as some problematic cases in English, have
	led us to reconsider the assumption that an adpositionâs lexical contribution
	is equivalent to the role/relation that it mediates. Our proposal is to embrace
	the potential for construal in adposition use, expressing such phenomena
	directly at the token level to manage complexity and avoid sense proliferation.
	We suggest a framework to represent both the scene role and the adpositionâs
	lexical function so they can be annotated at scaleâsupporting automatic,
	statistical processing of domain-general languageâand discuss how this
	representation would allow for a simpler inventory of labels.},

	automatically usually results in large numbers of candidates, which need to be
	filtered to derive a subset of patterns that reliably extract correct relation

	represented by entailment graphs, which capture semantic relationships holding
	among the learned pattern candidates. This is motivated by the fact that a
	pattern may not express the target relation explicitly, but still be useful for
	extracting instances for which the relation holds, because its meaning entails
	the meaning of the target relation. We evaluate the usage of both automatically
	generated and gold-standard entailment graphs in a relation extraction scenario
	and present favorable experimental results, exhibiting the benefits of
	structuring and selecting patterns based on entailment graphs.},

	However, schizophrenia research has not kept pace with technologies in

	examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing their syntax,
	semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self proclaimed)
