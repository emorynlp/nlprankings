Prior work treated animacy as a word-level property, and has developed statistical classifiers to classify words as either animate or inanimate. We discuss why this approach to the problem is ill-posed, and present a new approach based on classifying the animacy of co-reference chains. We show that simple voting approaches to inferring the animacy of a chain from its constituent words perform relatively poorly, and then present a hybrid system merging supervised machine learning (ML) and a small number of hand-built rules to compute the animacy of referring expressions and co-reference chains. This method achieves state of the art performance. The supervised ML component leverages features such as word embeddings over referring expressions, parts of speech, and grammatical and semantic roles. The rules take into consideration parts of speech and the hypernymy structure encoded in WordNet. The system achieves an F1 of 0.88 for classifying the animacy of referring expressions, which is comparable to state of the art results for classifying the animacy of words, and achieves an F1 of 0.75 for classifying the animacy of coreference chains themselves. We release our training and test dataset, which includes 142 texts (all narratives) comprising 156,154 words, 34,698 referring expressions, and 10,941 co-reference chains. We test the method on a subset of the OntoNotes dataset, showing using manual sampling that animacy classification is 90{\\%} +\/- 2{\\%} accurate for coreference chains, and 92{\\%} +\/- 1{\\%} for referring expressions. The data also contains 46 folktales, which present an interesting challenge because they often involve characters who are members of traditionally inanimate classes (e.g., stoves that walk, trees that talk). We show that our system is able to detect the animacy of these unusual referents with an F1 of 0.95.","pages":"1--12","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1002","title":"Zero Pronoun Resolution with Attention-based Neural Network","authors":["Yin, Qingyu","Zhang, Yu","Zhang, Weinan","Liu, Ting","Wang, William Yang"],"emails":["qyyin@ir.hit.edu.cn","yzhang@ir.hit.edu.cn","wnzhang@ir.hit.edu.cn","tliu@ir.hit.edu.cn","william@cs.ucsb.edu"],"author_id":["qingyu-yin","yu-zhang","weinan-zhang","ting-liu","william-yang-wang"],"abstract":"Recent neural network methods for zero pronoun resolution explore multiple models for generating representation vectors for zero pronouns and their candidate antecedents.

To tackle this aspect, we take the character identification corpus from the SemEval 2018 shared task that consists of entity annotation for singular mentions, and expand it by adding annotation for plural mentions. We then introduce a novel coreference resolution algorithm that selectively creates clusters to handle both singular and plural mentions, and also a deep learning-based entity linking model that jointly handles both types of mentions through multi-task learning. Adjusted evaluation metrics are proposed for these tasks as well to handle the uniqueness of plural mentions.

One category of works use unlabeled data to train general word embeddings based on term proximity, which can be integrated into traditional IR models. The other category employs labeled data (e.g. click-through data) to train end-to-end neural IR models consisting of layers for target-specific representation learning. The latter idea accounts better for the IR task and is favored by recent research works, which is the one we will follow in this paper. We hypothesize that general semantics learned from unlabeled data can complement task-specific representation learned from labeled data of limited quality, and that a combination of the two is favorable. To this end, we propose a learning framework which can benefit from both labeled and more abundant unlabeled data for representation learning in the context of IR. Through a joint learning fashion in a single neural framework, the learned representation is optimized to minimize both the supervised loss on query-document matching and the unsupervised loss on text reconstruction. Standard retrieval experiments on TREC collections indicate that the joint learning methodology leads to significant better performance of retrieval over several strong baselines for IR.","pages":"293--302","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1026","title":"Modeling the Readability of {G}erman Targeting Adults and Children: An empirically broad analysis and its cross-corpus validation","authors":["Wei{\\ss}, Zarah","Meurers, Detmar"],"emails":["zweiss@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de","dm@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de"],"author_id":["zarah-weiss","detmar-meurers"],"abstract":"We analyze two novel data sets of German educational media texts targeting adults and children.

Then, a second network designed as a dual-encoder SEQ2SEQ model using both the text query and the previously obtained sketch is employed to generate the final SQL query. Our approach shows improvements over previous approaches on two recent large datasets (WikiSQL and SENLIDB) suitable for data-driven solutions for natural language interfaces for databases.","pages":"514--524","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1043","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1044","title":"Employing Text Matching Network to Recognise Nuclearity in {C}hinese Discourse","authors":["Xu, Sheng","Li, Peifeng","Zhou, Guodong","Zhu, Qiaoming"],"emails":["sxu@stu.suda.edu.cn","pfli@suda.edu.cn","gdzhou@suda.edu.cn","qmzhu@suda.edu.cn"],"author_id":["sheng-xu","peifeng-li","guodong-zhou","qiaoming-zhu"],"abstract":"The task of nuclearity recognition in Chinese discourse remains challenging due to the demand for more deep semantic information.

In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to modeling coherence for neural machine translation by capturing contextual information either from recently translated sentences or the entire document. Particularly, we explore two types of caches: a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of target-side topical words that are semantically related to the document to be translated. On this basis, we build a new layer to score target words in these two caches with a cache-based neural model. Here the estimated probabilities from the cache-based neural model are combined with NMT probabilities into the final word prediction probabilities via a gating mechanism. Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with NMT system in an end-to-end manner.

First, we theoretically analyze the inherent self-normalization properties of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) language models. Then, we compare them empirically to softmax-based approaches, which are self-normalized using explicit regularization, and suggest a hybrid model with compelling properties.

One of the problematic presumptions with current MRC technologies is that each question is assumed to be answerable by looking at a given text passage. However, to realize human-like language comprehension ability, a machine should also be able to distinguish not-answerable questions (NAQs) from answerable questions. To develop this functionality, a dataset incorporating hard-to-detect NAQs is vital; however, its manual construction would be expensive. This paper proposes a dataset creation method that alters an existing MRC dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, and describes the resulting dataset. The value of this dataset is likely to increase if each NAQ in the dataset is properly classified with the difficulty of identifying it as an NAQ. This difficulty level would allow researchers to evaluate a machine{'}s NAQ detection performance more precisely. Therefore, we propose a method for automatically assigning difficulty level labels, which measures the similarity between a question and the target text passage.

The mechanism is able to capture the importance of each context word towards a target by modeling their semantic associations. We build upon this line of research and propose two novel approaches for improving the effectiveness of attention.

The proposed structured deep reinforcement learning is based on graph neural networks (GNN), which consists of some sub-networks, each one for a node on a directed graph. The graph is defined according to the domain ontology and each node can be considered as a sub-agent. During decision making, these sub-agents have internal message exchange between neighbors on the graph. We also propose an approach to jointly optimize the graph structure as well as the parameters of GNN.

We add a reordering RNN that shares the input encoder with the decoder. The RNNs are trained jointly with a multi-task loss function and applied sequentially at inference time. The task of the reordering model is to predict the permutation of the input words following the target language word order. After reordering, the attention in the decoder becomes more peaked and monotonic. For reordering, we adopt the Inversion Transduction Grammars (ITG) and propose a transition system to parse input to trees for reordering. We harness the ITG transition system with RNN. With the modeling power of RNN, we achieve superior reordering accuracy without any feature engineering. In experiments, we apply the model to the task of text normalization.

Fake news is typically written intentionally to mislead readers, which determines that fake news detection merely based on news content is tremendously challenging. Meanwhile, fake news could contain true evidence to mock true news and presents different degrees of fakeness, which further exacerbates the detection difficulty. On the other hand, the spread of fake news produces various types of data from different perspectives. These multiple sources provide rich contextual information about fake news and offer unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this paper, we study fake news detection with different degrees of fakeness by integrating multiple sources. In particular, we introduce approaches to combine information from multiple sources and to discriminate between different degrees of fakeness, and propose a Multi-source Multi-class Fake news Detection framework MMFD, which combines automated feature extraction, multi-source fusion and automated degrees of fakeness detection into a coherent and interpretable model.

Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use.

Intuitively, for each word, the prior density encodes the distribution of its potential {`}meanings{'}. These prior densities are conceptually similar to Gaussian embeddings of {\\.e}wcitevilnis2014word. Interestingly, unlike the Gaussian embeddings, we can also obtain context-specific densities: they encode uncertainty about the sense of a word given its context and correspond to the approximate posterior distributions within our model. The context-dependent densities have many potential applications: for example, we show that they can be directly used in the lexical substitution task. We describe an effective estimation method based on the variational autoencoding framework.

In detail, we propose a novel Sandwich Neural Network (SNN) to learn semantic and structure representations automatically without relying on parsers.

To solve the fusion problem, we propose two strategies: Adaptive Learning Sandwich Neural Network (AL-SNN) and Self-Attention Sandwich Neural Network (SA-SNN). The former learns the weights at corpus level, and the latter further combines attention mechanism to assign the weights at instance level.

Among models that do not employ prior linguistic knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art word and sentence-level tagging accuracy with the Sejong Korean corpus using our proposed data-driven Bi-LSTM model.","pages":"2482--2492","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1210","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1211","title":"Why does {P}air{D}iff work? - A Mathematical Analysis of Bilinear Relational Compositional Operators for Analogy Detection","authors":["Hakami, Huda","Hayashi, Kohei","Bollegala, Danushka"],"emails":["h.a.hakami@liv.ac.uk","hayashi.kohei@gmail.com","danushka.bollegala@liv.ac.uk"],"author_id":["huda-hakami","kohei-hayashi","danushka-bollegala"],"abstract":"Representing the semantic relations that exist between two given words (or entities) is an important first step in a wide-range of NLP applications such as analogical reasoning, knowledge base completion and relational information retrieval. A simple, yet surprisingly accurate method for representing a relation between two words is to compute the vector offset (PairDiff) between their corresponding word embeddings. Despite the empirical success, it remains unclear as to whether PairDiff is the best operator for obtaining a relational representation from word embeddings. We conduct a theoretical analysis of generalised bilinear operators that can be used to measure the l2 relational distance between two word-pairs. We show that, if the word embed- dings are standardised and uncorrelated, such an operator will be independent of bilinear terms, and can be simplified to a linear form, where PairDiff is a special case. For numerous word embedding types, we empirically verify the uncorrelation assumption, demonstrating the general applicability of our theoretical result. Moreover, we experimentally discover PairDiff from the bilinear relational compositional operator on several benchmark analogy datasets.","pages":"2493--2504","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1211","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1212","title":"Real-time Change Point Detection using On-line Topic Models","authors":["Wang, Yunli","Goutte, Cyril"],"emails":["ang@nrc.ca","outte@gmail.com"],"author_id":["yunli-wang","cyril-goutte"],"abstract":"Detecting changes within an unfolding event in real time from news articles or social media enables to react promptly to serious issues in public safety, public health or natural disasters.

The proposed model learns to generate word representations from characters. In our model, we employ a convolutional neural network and a highway network over characters to extract salient features effectively. Unlike previous models that learn word representations from a large corpus, we take a set of pre-trained word embeddings and generalize it to word entries, including OOV words. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, we perform both an intrinsic and an extrinsic task which are word similarity and language modeling, respectively. Experimental results show clearly that the proposed model significantly outperforms strong baseline models that regard words or their subwords as atomic units.

First, the paucity of example sentences in existing FE dictionaries results in a shortage of context information, which is necessary for acquiring semantic representation of FEs. Second, while a semantic category label is assigned to each FE in many FE dictionaries, it is difficult to predict the labels from user input, forcing users to manually designate the semantic category when searching.

Our sentence-level analysis indicates that comparing GLEU and M2, one metric may be more useful than the other depending on the scenario. We further qualitatively analyze these metrics and our findings show that apart from being less interpretable and non-deterministic, GLEU also produces counter-intuitive scores in commonly occurring test examples.","pages":"2730--2741","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1231","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1232","title":"Information Aggregation via Dynamic Routing for Sequence Encoding","authors":["Gong, Jingjing","Qiu, Xipeng","Wang, Shaojing","Huang, Xuanjing"],"emails":["jjgong15@fudan.edu.cn","xpqiu@fudan.edu.cn","sjwang17@fudan.edu.cn","xjhuang@fudan.edu.cn"],"author_id":["jingjing-gong","xipeng-qiu","shaojing-wang","xuan-jing-huang"],"abstract":"While much progress has been made in how to encode a text sequence into a sequence of vectors, less attention has been paid to how to aggregate these preceding vectors (outputs of RNN\/CNN) into fixed-size encoding vector. Usually, a simple max or average pooling is used, which is a bottom-up and passive way of aggregation and lack of guidance by task information. In this paper, we propose an aggregation mechanism to obtain a fixed-size encoding with a dynamic routing policy. The dynamic routing policy is dynamically deciding that what and how much information need be transferred from each word to the final encoding of the text sequence. Following the work of Capsule Network, we design two dynamic routing policies to aggregate the outputs of RNN\/CNN encoding layer into a final encoding vector. Compared to the other aggregation methods, dynamic routing can refine the messages according to the state of final encoding vector.

In particular, we confirm that it performs better with a greater number of slots in a dataset, including unknown words, by evaluating the models on a dataset of several domains.

We use a purely syntactic language model to study the significance of sentence structures in both single-domain and cross-domain attribution, i.e. cross-topic and cross-genre attribution. We show that syntax may be helpful for cross-genre attribution while cross-topic attribution and single-domain may benefit from additional lexical information. Further, pure syntactic models may not be effective by themselves and need to be used in combination with other robust models. To study the role of word choice, we perform attribution by masking all words or specific topic words corresponding to nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Using a single-domain dataset, IMDB1M reviews, we demonstrate the heavy influence of common nouns and proper nouns in attribution, thereby highlighting topic interference. Using cross-domain Guardian10 dataset, we show that some common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs may help with stylometric attribution as demonstrated by masking topic words corresponding to these parts-of-speech. As expected, it was observed that proper nouns are heavily influenced by content and cross-domain attribution will benefit from completely masking them.","pages":"2814--2822","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1238","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1239","title":"Learning Target-Specific Representations of Financial News Documents For Cumulative Abnormal Return Prediction","authors":["Duan, Junwen","Zhang, Yue","Ding, Xiao","Chang, Ching-Yun","Liu, Ting"],"emails":["jwduan@ir.hit.edu.cn","zhang@sutd.edu.sg","xding@ir.hit.edu.cn","chang.frannie@gmail.com","tliu@ir.hit.edu.cn"],"author_id":["junwen-duan","yue-zhang","xiao-ding","ching-yun-chang","ting-liu"],"abstract":"Texts from the Internet serve as important data sources for financial market modeling.

However, the very process of CV requires random partitioning of the data and so our performance estimates are in fact stochastic, with variability that can be substantial for natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate that these unstable estimates cannot be relied upon for effective parameter tuning. The resulting tuned parameters are highly sensitive to how our data is partitioned, meaning that we often select sub-optimal parameter choices and have serious reproducibility issues. Instead, we propose to use the less variable J-K-fold CV, in which J independent K-fold cross validations are used to assess performance. Our main contributions are extending J-K-fold CV from performance estimation to parameter tuning and investigating how to choose J and K. We argue that variability is more important than bias for effective tuning and so advocate lower choices of K than are typically seen in the NLP literature and instead use the saved computation to increase J. To demonstrate the generality of our recommendations we investigate a wide range of case-studies: sentiment classification (both general and target-specific), part-of-speech tagging and document classification.","pages":"2978--2989","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1252","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1253","title":"Incremental Natural Language Processing: Challenges, Strategies, and Evaluation","authors":["K{\\\"o}hn, Arne"],"emails":["koehn@informatik.uni-hamburg.de"],"author_id":["arne-kohn"],"abstract":"Incrementality is ubiquitous in human-human interaction and beneficial for human-computer interaction.

The resulting corpus is a gold-standard labeled corpus for supervised learning of semantic role labels in adult-child dialogues. Semantic role labeling (SRL) models assign semantic roles to sentence constituents, thus indicating who has done what to whom (and in what way). The current corpus is derived from the Adam files in the Brown corpus (Brown 1973) of the CHILDES corpora, and augments the partial annotation described in Connor et al. (2010). It provides labels for both semantic arguments of verbs and semantic arguments of prepositions. The semantic role labels and senses of verbs follow Propbank guidelines Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Palmer 2002; Palmer et al., 2005) and those for prepositions follow Srikumar and Roth (2011). The corpus was annotated by two annotators. Inter-annotator agreement is given separately for prepositions and verbs, and for adult speech and child speech. Overall, across child and adult samples, including verbs and prepositions, the kappa score for sense is 72.6, for the number of semantic-role-bearing arguments, the kappa score is 77.4, for identical semantic role labels on a given argument, the kappa score is 91.1, for the span of semantic role labels, and the kappa for agreement is 93.9. The sense and number of arguments was often open to multiple interpretations in child speech, due to the rapidly changing discourse and omission of constituents in production. Annotators used a discourse context window of ten sentences before and ten sentences after the target utterance to determine the annotation labels. The derived corpus is available for use in CHAT (MacWhinney, 2000) and XML format.","pages":"3004--3014","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1254","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1255","title":"Multi-layer Representation Fusion for Neural Machine Translation","authors":["Wang, Qiang","Li, Fuxue","Xiao, Tong","Li, Yanyang","Li, Yinqiao","Zhu, Jingbo"],"emails":["wangqiangneu@gmail.com","lifuxue119@163.com","xiaotong@mail.neu.edu.cn","li.yin.qiao.2012@hotmail.com","blamedrlee@outlook.com","zhujingbo@mail.neu.edu.cn"],"author_id":["qiang-wang","fuxue-li","tong-xiao","yanyang-li","yinqiao-li","jingbo-zhu"],"abstract":"Neural machine translation systems require a number of stacked layers for deep models.

Automating support is the task of automatically providing answers to these problems given a corpus of solution documents. Traditional approaches to this task rely on information retrieval and are keyword based; looking for keyword overlap between the question and solution documents and ignoring these attributes.

In this paper, we propose Knowledge-aware Attentive Network (KAN), a transfer learning framework for cross-domain answer selection, which uses the knowledge base as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer from the source domain to the target domains. Specifically, we design a knowledge module to integrate the knowledge-based representational learning into answer selection models. The learned knowledge-based representations are shared by source and target domains, which not only leverages large amounts of cross-domain data, but also benefits from a regularization effect that leads to more general representations to help tasks in new domains. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we use SQuAD-T dataset as the source domain and three other datasets (i.e., Yahoo QA, TREC QA and InsuranceQA) as the target domains.

An SLU corpus is a monolingual corpus with domain\/intent\/slot labels. Translating the original SLU corpus into the target language is an attractive strategy. However, SLU corpora consist of plenty of semantic labels (slots), which general-purpose translators cannot handle well, not to mention additional culture differences. This paper focuses on the language transferring task given a small in-domain parallel SLU corpus. The in-domain parallel corpus can be used as the first adaptation on the general translator. But more importantly, we show how to use reinforcement learning (RL) to further adapt the adapted translator, where translated sentences with more proper slot tags receive higher rewards. Our reward is derived from the source input sentence exclusively, unlike reward via actor-critical methods or computing reward with a ground truth target sentence. Hence we can adapt the translator the second time, using the big monolingual SLU corpus from the source language. We evaluate our approach on Chinese to English language transferring for SLU systems. The experimental results show that the generated English SLU corpus via adaptation and reinforcement learning gives us over 97{\\%} in the slot F1 score and over 84{\\%} accuracy in domain classification. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed language transferring method.

Although increasing the beam width mitigates the myopic bias, it also proportionally slows down the inference efficiency. To alleviate the myopic bias in small-width beam search, this paper proposes a Prospective-Performance Network (PPN) to predict the future reward of the given partially-generated response, and the future reward is defined by the expectation of the partial response appearing in the top-ranked responses given by a larger-width beam search. Enhanced by PPN, the decoder can promote the results with great potential during the beam search phase.

Begin with an insightful adversarial attack on VSE embeddings, we show the limitation of current frameworks and image-text datasets (e.g., MS-COCO) both quantitatively and qualitatively. The large gap between the number of possible constitutions of real-world semantics and the size of parallel data, to a large extent, restricts the model to establish a strong link between textual semantics and visual concepts. We alleviate this problem by augmenting the MS-COCO image captioning datasets with textual contrastive adversarial samples.

This simple but powerful technique brings a noticeable improvement over the baselines on a diverse set of downstream tasks, in addition to defending known-type adversarial attacks.

In this paper, we model rhetorical strategies for the computational synthesis of effective argumentation. In a study, we let 26 experts synthesize argumentative texts with different strategies for 10 topics. We find that the experts agree in the selection significantly more when following the same strategy. While the texts notably vary for different strategies, especially their arrangement remains stable.

Such datasets and systems thus do not cater to the multilingual regions of the world, such as India, where it is very common for people to speak more than one language and seamlessly switch between them resulting in code-mixed conversations. For example, a Hindi speaking user looking to book a restaurant would typically ask, {``}Kya tum is restaurant mein ek table book karne mein meri help karoge?{''} ({``}Can you help me in booking a table at this restaurant?{''}). To facilitate the development of such code-mixed conversation models, we build a goal-oriented dialog dataset containing code-mixed conversations. Specifically, we take the text from the DSTC2 restaurant reservation dataset and create code-mixed versions of it in Hindi-English, Bengali-English, Gujarati-English and Tamil-English.

A web-snippet can be represented using multiple views. Apart from textual view cued by both the semantic and syntactic information, a complimentary view extracted from images contained in the web-snippets is also utilized in the current framework. A single consensus partitioning is finally obtained after consulting these two individual views by the deployment of a multiobjective based clustering technique. Several objective functions including the values of a cluster quality measure measuring the goodness of partitionings obtained using different views and an agreement-disagreement index, quantifying the amount of oneness among multiple views in generating partitionings are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA. In order to detect the number of clusters automatically, concepts of variable length solutions and a vast range of permutation operators are introduced in the clustering process. Finally, a set of alternative partitioning are obtained on the final Pareto front by the proposed multi-view based multiobjective technique. Experimental results by the proposed approach on several benchmark test datasets of SRC with respect to different performance metrics evidently establish the power of visual and text-based views in achieving better search result clustering.","pages":"3793--3805","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-1321","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"C18-1322","title":"Integrating Tree Structures and Graph Structures with Neural Networks to Classify Discussion Discourse Acts","authors":["Miura, Yasuhide","Kano, Ryuji","Taniguchi, Motoki","Taniguchi, Tomoki","Misawa, Shotaro","Ohkuma, Tomoko"],"emails":["yasuhide.miura@fujixerox.co.jp","kano.ryuji@fujixerox.co.jp","motoki.taniguchi@fujixerox.co.jp","taniguchi.tomoki@fujixerox.co.jp","misawa.shotaro@fujixerox.co.jp","ohkuma.tomoko@fujixerox.co.jp"],"author_id":["yasuhide-miura","ryuji-kano","motoki-taniguchi","tomoki-taniguchi","shotaro-misawa","tomoko-ohkuma"],"abstract":"We proposed a model that integrates discussion structures with neural networks to classify discourse acts.
