In particular, people study the problem by investigating context-response matching for multi-turn response selection based on publicly recognized benchmark data sets. State-of-the-art methods require a response to interact with each utterance in a context from the beginning, but the interaction is performed in a shallow way. In this work, we let utterance-response interaction go deep by proposing an interaction-over-interaction network (IoI). The model performs matching by stacking multiple interaction blocks in which residual information from one time of interaction initiates the interaction process again. Thus, matching information within an utterance-response pair is extracted from the interaction of the pair in an iterative fashion, and the information flows along the chain of the blocks via representations. Evaluation results on three benchmark data sets indicate that IoI can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of various matching metrics. Through further analysis, we also unveil how the depth of interaction affects the performance of IoI.","pages":"1--11","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1002","title":"Incremental Transformer with Deliberation Decoder for Document Grounded Conversations","authors":["Li, Zekang","Niu, Cheng","Meng, Fandong","Feng, Yang","Li, Qian","Zhou, Jie"],"emails":["zekangli97@gmail.com","chengniu@tencent.com","fandongmeng@tencent.com","fengyang@ict.ac.cn","qianli@stumail.neu.edu.cn","jiezhou@tencent.com"],"author_id":["zekang-li","cheng-niu","fandong-meng","yang-feng","qian-li","jie-zhou"],"abstract":"Document Grounded Conversations is a task to generate dialogue responses when chatting about the content of a given document.

To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Matching network (STM) for response selection.

However, their quality is not consistent throughout the vocabulary due to the long-tail distribution of word frequency. Without sufficient contexts, rare word embeddings are usually less reliable than those of common words.

Since names often contain rare and uncommon words, this problem is particularly critical for name tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel reliability-aware name tagging model to tackle this issue. We design a set of word frequency-based reliability signals to indicate the quality of each word embedding. Guided by the reliability signals, the model is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms.

In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation approach which can learn both long- and short-term user representations. The core of our approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder, we learn representations of news from their titles and topic categories, and use attention network to select important words. In the user encoder, we propose to learn long-term user representations from the embeddings of their IDs.In addition, we propose to learn short-term user representations from their recently browsed news via GRU network. Besides, we propose two methods to combine long-term and short-term user representations. The first one is using the long-term user representation to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network in short-term user representation. The second one is concatenating both long- and short-term user representations as a unified user vector.

In this paper, we address this serious limitation of existing approaches and improve strong neural encoder-decoder models by appropriately modeling wider contexts. We employ an auxiliary encoder that encodes previous sentences and incorporate the encoding in the decoder via attention and gating mechanisms. Our approach results in statistically significant improvements in overall GEC performance over strong baselines across multiple test sets. Analysis of our cross-sentence GEC model on a synthetic dataset shows high performance in verb tense corrections that require cross-sentence context.","pages":"435--445","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1042","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1042","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1043","title":"This Email Could Save Your Life: Introducing the Task of Email Subject Line Generation","authors":["Zhang, Rui","Tetreault, Joel"],"emails":["r.zhang@yale.edu","joel.tetreault@grammarly.com"],"author_id":["rui-zhang","joel-tetreault"],"abstract":"Given the overwhelming number of emails, an effective subject line becomes essential to better inform the recipient of the email{'}s content.

In this paper, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for neural ASC models, which automatically mines useful attention supervision information from a training corpus to refine attention mechanisms.

Particularly, at each iteration, the context word with the maximum attention weight is extracted as the one with active\/misleading influence on the correct\/incorrect prediction of every instance, and then the word itself is masked for subsequent iterations. Finally, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term, which enables ASC models to continue equally focusing on the extracted active context words while decreasing weights of those misleading ones.

We find the learned latent trees have little to no structure and instead focus on lexical cues; even after obtaining more structured trees with proposed model modifications, the trees are still far from capturing discourse structure when compared to discourse dependency trees from an existing discourse parser. Finally, ablation studies show the structured attention provides little benefit, sometimes even hurting performance.","pages":"646--653","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1062","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1062","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1063","title":"Know What You Don{'}t Know: Modeling a Pragmatic Speaker that Refers to Objects of Unknown Categories","authors":["Zarrie{\\ss}, Sina","Schlangen, David"],"emails":["sina.zarriess@uni-bielefeld.de","david.schlangen@uni-potsdam.de"],"author_id":["sina-zarriess","david-schlangen"],"abstract":"Zero-shot learning in Language {\\&} Vision is the task of correctly labelling (or naming) objects of novel categories.

For example, prior literature suggests that experience might not translate into consequential changes in counselor behavior. This has led some to even argue that counseling is a profession without expertise. In this work, we develop a computational framework to quantify the extent to which individuals change their linguistic behavior with experience and to study the nature of this evolution. We use our framework to conduct a large longitudinal study of mental health counseling conversations, tracking over 3,400 counselors across their tenure. We reveal that overall, counselors do indeed change their conversational behavior to become more diverse across interactions, developing an individual voice that distinguishes them from other counselors. Furthermore, a finer-grained investigation shows that the rate and nature of this diversification vary across functionally different conversational components.","pages":"936--947","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1089","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1089","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1090","title":"Towards Automating Healthcare Question Answering in a Noisy Multilingual Low-Resource Setting","authors":["Daniel, Jeanne E.","Brink, Willie","Eloff, Ryan","Copley, Charles"],"emails":["jeanne.e.daniel@gmail.com","wbrink@sun.ac.za","ryan.peter.eloff@gmail.com","charles@praekelt.org"],"author_id":["jeanne-e-daniel","willie-brink","ryan-eloff","charles-copley"],"abstract":"We discuss ongoing work into automating a multilingual digital helpdesk service available via text messaging to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in South Africa.

To make TDS self-adapted to data and task, and to combine it with model training, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that synchronously searches for training instances relevant to the target domain and learns better representations for them. A selection distribution generator (SDG) is designed to perform the selection and is updated according to the rewards computed from the selected data, where a predictor is included in the framework to ensure a task-specific model can be trained on the selected data and provides feedback to rewards.

In this paper, we propose to leverage several multi-level structures to learn a VAE model for generating long, and coherent text. In particular, a hierarchy of stochastic layers between the encoder and decoder networks is employed to abstract more informative and semantic-rich latent codes.

However, current PCFG induction models, using word tokens as input, are unable to incorporate semantics and morphology into induction, and may encounter issues of sparse vocabulary when facing morphologically rich languages. This paper describes a neural PCFG inducer which employs context embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) in a normalizing flow model (Dinh et al., 2015) to extend PCFG induction to use semantic and morphological information. Linguistically motivated sparsity and categorical distance constraints are imposed on the inducer as regularization.

The performance of strong baseline models drops significantly on our adversarial test, indicating that they are indeed exploiting the shortcuts rather than performing multi-hop reasoning.

Such deep neural models, however, are not applicable to most human languages due to the lack of annotated training data for various NLP tasks. Cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL) is a viable method for building NLP models for a low-resource target language by leveraging labeled data from other (source) languages. In this work, we focus on the multilingual transfer setting where training data in multiple source languages is leveraged to further boost target language performance. Unlike most existing methods that rely only on language-invariant features for CLTL, our approach coherently utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features at instance level. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features, and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the similarity between the target language and each individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to share between various languages in the multilingual setup. Moreover, when coupled with unsupervised multilingual embeddings, our model can operate in a zero-resource setting where neither target language training data nor cross-lingual resources are available.

To overcome this problem, we propose a new unsupervised multilingual embedding method that does not rely on such assumption and performs well under resource-poor scenarios, namely when only a small amount of monolingual data (i.e., 50k sentences) are available, or when the domains of monolingual data are different across languages.

Since a large number of features contribute to the success of cross-lingual transfer (including phylogenetic similarity, typological properties, lexical overlap, or size of available data), even the most enlightened experimenter rarely considers all these factors for the particular task at hand.

In this paper, we ask the fundamental question of whether Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is necessary for deep learning-based Chinese Natural Language Processing. We benchmark neural word-based models which rely on word segmentation against neural char-based models which do not involve word segmentation in four end-to-end NLP benchmark tasks: language modeling, machine translation, sentence matching\/paraphrase and text classification. Through direct comparisons between these two types of models, we find that char-based models consistently outperform word-based models. Based on these observations, we conduct comprehensive experiments to study why word-based models underperform char-based models in these deep learning-based NLP tasks. We show that it is because word-based models are more vulnerable to data sparsity and the presence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and thus more prone to overfitting.

Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors.

Using a set of hand-crafted transformation rules, input sentences are recursively transformed into a two-layered hierarchical representation in the form of core sentences and accompanying contexts that are linked via rhetorical relations. In this way, the semantic relationship of the decomposed constituents is preserved in the output, maintaining its interpretability for downstream applications. Both a thorough manual analysis and automatic evaluation across three datasets from two different domains demonstrate that the proposed syntactic simplification approach outperforms the state of the art in structural text simplification.

We hypothesize that statistical NLI models may adopt three fallible syntactic heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic. To determine whether models have adopted these heuristics, we introduce a controlled evaluation set called HANS (Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems), which contains many examples where the heuristics fail. We find that models trained on MNLI, including BERT, a state-of-the-art model, perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that they have indeed adopted these heuristics.

These paragraph captions can hence contain substantial information of the image for tasks such as visual question answering. Moreover, this textual information is complementary with visual information present in the image because it can discuss both more abstract concepts and more explicit, intermediate symbolic information about objects, events, and scenes that can directly be matched with the textual question and copied into the textual answer (i.e., via easier modality match). Hence, we propose a combined Visual and Textual Question Answering (VTQA) model which takes as input a paragraph caption as well as the corresponding image, and answers the given question based on both inputs. In our model, the inputs are fused to extract related information by cross-attention (early fusion), then fused again in the form of consensus (late fusion), and finally expected answers are given an extra score to enhance the chance of selection (later fusion). Empirical results show that paragraph captions, even when automatically generated (via an RL-based encoder-decoder model), help correctly answer more visual questions.

How to learn accurate representations of these words to augment a pre-trained embedding by only a few observations is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embedding as a few-shot regression problem by fitting a representation function to predict an oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant observations) based on limited contexts.

Here, we measure human performance on the benchmark, in order to learn whether significant headroom remains for further progress. We provide a conservative estimate of human performance on the benchmark through crowdsourcing: Our annotators are non-experts who must learn each task from a brief set of instructions and 20 examples. In spite of limited training, these annotators robustly outperform the state of the art on six of the nine GLUE tasks and achieve an average score of 87.1.

However, the fundamental challenge lies in obtaining high-quality annotations of (utterance, program) pairs across various domains needed for training such models. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework to build a unified multi-domain enabled semantic parser trained only with weak supervision (denotations). Weakly supervised training is particularly arduous as the program search space grows exponentially in a multi-domain setting. To solve this, we incorporate a multi-policy distillation mechanism in which we first train domain-specific semantic parsers (teachers) using weak supervision in the absence of the ground truth programs, followed by training a single unified parser (student) from the domain specific policies obtained from these teachers. The resultant semantic parser is not only compact but also generalizes better, and generates more accurate programs. It further does not require the user to provide a domain label while querying. On the standard Overnight dataset (containing multiple domains), we demonstrate that the proposed model improves performance by 20{\\%} in terms of denotation accuracy in comparison to baseline techniques.","pages":"4801--4810","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1473","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1473","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1474","title":"Every Child Should Have Parents: A Taxonomy Refinement Algorithm Based on Hyperbolic Term Embeddings","authors":["Aly, Rami","Acharya, Shantanu","Ossa, Alexander","K{\\\"o}hn, Arne","Biemann, Chris","Panchenko, Alexander"],"emails":["5aly@informatik.uni-hamburg.de","","2ossa@informatik.uni-hamburg.de","koehn@informatik.uni-hamburg.de","biemann@informatik.uni-hamburg.de","panchenko@informatik.uni-hamburg.de"],"author_id":["rami-aly","shantanu-acharya","alexander-ossa","arne-kohn","chris-biemann","alexander-panchenko"],"abstract":"We introduce the use of Poincar{\\'e} embeddings to improve existing state-of-the-art approaches to domain-specific taxonomy induction from text as a signal for both relocating wrong hyponym terms within a (pre-induced) taxonomy as well as for attaching disconnected terms in a taxonomy.

So as to answer this question, we experiment with parallel corpora, which allows us to compare offline mapping to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns both embedding spaces. We observe that, under these ideal conditions, joint learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results in bilingual lexicon induction.

In the second one, the nested NER is viewed as a sequence-to-sequence problem, in which the input sequence consists of the tokens and output sequence of the labels, using hard attention on the word whose label is being predicted. The proposed methods outperform the nested NER state of the art on four corpora: ACE-2004, ACE-2005, GENIA and Czech CNEC. We also enrich our architectures with the recently published contextual embeddings: ELMo, BERT and Flair, reaching further improvements for the four nested entity corpora. In addition, we report flat NER state-of-the-art results for CoNLL-2002 Dutch and Spanish and for CoNLL-2003 English.","pages":"5326--5331","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1527","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1527","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1528","title":"Online Infix Probability Computation for Probabilistic Finite Automata","authors":["Cognetta, Marco","Han, Yo-Sub","Kwon, Soon Chan"],"emails":["cognetta.marco@gmail.com","soon--chan@yonsei.ac.kr","emmous@yonsei.ac.kr"],"author_id":["marco-cognetta","yo-sub-han","soon-chan-kwon"],"abstract":"Probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) are com- mon statistical language model in natural lan- guage and speech processing.

WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions.

This paper addresses these two critical challenges in NNLG by: (1) scalably (and at no cost) creating training datasets of parallel meaning representations and reference texts with rich style markup by using data from freely available and naturally descriptive user reviews, and (2) systematically exploring how the style markup enables joint control of semantic and stylistic aspects of neural model output. We present YelpNLG, a corpus of 300,000 rich, parallel meaning representations and highly stylistically varied reference texts spanning different restaurant attributes, and describe a novel methodology that can be scalably reused to generate NLG datasets for other domains.

Experiments show the state-of-the-art grammatical error correction system can improve the grammaticality of generated text and can bring task-oriented improvements in the tasks where target sentences are in a formal style.","pages":"6059--6064","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1609","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1609","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1610","title":"Improving the Robustness of Question Answering Systems to Question Paraphrasing","authors":["Gan, Wee Chung","Ng, Hwee Tou"],"emails":["nght@comp.nus.edu.sg","weechung@u.nus.edu"],"author_id":["wee-chung-gan","hwee-tou-ng"],"abstract":"Despite the advancement of question answering (QA) systems and rapid improvements on held-out test sets, their generalizability is a topic of concern.

However, both stages are largely isolated in the status quo and, hence, information from the two phases is never properly fused. In contrast, this work proposes RankQA: RankQA extends the conventional two-stage process in neural QA with a third stage that performs an additional answer re-ranking. The re-ranking leverages different features that are directly extracted from the QA pipeline, i.e., a combination of retrieval and comprehension features. While our intentionally simple design allows for an efficient, data-sparse estimation, it nevertheless outperforms more complex QA systems by a significant margin: in fact, RankQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 out of 4 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, its performance is especially superior in settings where the size of the corpus is dynamic. Here the answer re-ranking provides an effective remedy against the underlying noise-information trade-off due to a variable corpus size. As a consequence, RankQA represents a novel, powerful, and thus challenging baseline for future research in content-based QA.","pages":"6076--6085","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1611","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1611","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1612","title":"Latent Retrieval for Weakly Supervised Open Domain Question Answering","authors":["Lee, Kenton","Chang, Ming-Wei","Toutanova, Kristina"],"emails":["kentonl@google.com","mingweichang@google.com","kristout@google.com"],"author_id":["kenton-lee","ming-wei-chang","kristina-toutanova"],"abstract":"Recent work on open domain question answering (QA) assumes strong supervision of the supporting evidence and\/or assumes a blackbox information retrieval (IR) system to retrieve evidence candidates.

We induce latent document structure jointly with an abstractive summarization objective, and train our models in a scalable synthetic setup. In addition to improvements in summarization over topic-agnostic baselines, we demonstrate the benefit of the learnt document structure: we show that our models (a) learn to accurately segment documents by aspect; (b) can leverage the structure to produce both abstractive and extractive aspect-based summaries; and (c) that structure is particularly advantageous for summarizing long documents.

However, depending on the up-stream systems, e.g., speech recognition, or word segmentation, the input to translation system can vary greatly. The goal of this work is to extend the attention mechanism of the transformer to naturally consume the lattice in addition to the traditional sequential input. We first propose a general lattice transformer for speech translation where the input is the output of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) which contains multiple paths and posterior scores. To leverage the extra information from the lattice structure, we develop a novel controllable lattice attention mechanism to obtain latent representations. On the LDC Spanish-English speech translation corpus, our experiments show that lattice transformer generalizes significantly better and outperforms both a transformer baseline and a lattice LSTM. Additionally, we validate our approach on the WMT 2017 Chinese-English translation task with lattice inputs from different BPE segmentations. In this task, we also observe the improvements over strong baselines.","pages":"6475--6484","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1649","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1649","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1650","title":"Informative Image Captioning with External Sources of Information","authors":["Zhao, Sanqiang","Sharma, Piyush","Levinboim, Tomer","Soricut, Radu"],"emails":["sanqiang.zhao@pitt.edu","piyushsharma@google.com","tomerl@google.com","rsoricut@google.com"],"author_id":["sanqiang-zhao","piyush-sharma","tomer-levinboim","radu-soricut"],"abstract":"An image caption should fluently present the essential information in a given image, including informative, fine-grained entity mentions and the manner in which these entities interact.

We present a mechanism for integrating image information together with fine-grained labels (assumed to be generated by some upstream models) into a caption that describes the image in a fluent and informative manner. We introduce a multimodal, multi-encoder model based on Transformer that ingests both image features and multiple sources of entity labels. We demonstrate that we can learn to control the appearance of these entity labels in the output, resulting in captions that are both fluent and informative.","pages":"6485--6494","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1650","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1650","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1651","title":"{C}o{D}raw: Collaborative Drawing as a Testbed for Grounded Goal-driven Communication","authors":["Kim, Jin-Hwa","Kitaev, Nikita","Chen, Xinlei","Rohrbach, Marcus","Zhang, Byoung-Tak","Tian, Yuandong","Batra, Dhruv","Parikh, Devi"],"emails":["jnhwkim@sktbrain.com","kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu","xinleic@fb.com","mrf@fb.com","btzhang@bi.snu.ac.kr","yuandong@fb.com","dbatra@gatech.edu","parikh@gatech.edu"],"author_id":["jin-hwa-kim","nikita-kitaev","xinlei-chen","marcus-rohrbach","byoung-tak-zhang","yuandong-tian","dhruv-batra","devi-parikh"],"abstract":"In this work, we propose a goal-driven collaborative task that combines language, perception, and action.

We investigate where the natural language empirically grounds under two recent state-of-the-art VLN models.

However, two major challenges in modeling such multimodal human language time-series data exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due to variable sampling rates for the sequences from each modality; and 2) long-range dependencies between elements across modalities. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) to generically address the above issues in an end-to-end manner without explicitly aligning the data. At the heart of our model is the directional pairwise crossmodal attention, which attends to interactions between multimodal sequences across distinct time steps and latently adapt streams from one modality to another. Comprehensive experiments on both aligned and non-aligned multimodal time-series show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests that correlated crossmodal signals are able to be captured by the proposed crossmodal attention mechanism in MulT.","pages":"6558--6569","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P19-1656","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P19-1656","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"P19-1657","title":"Show, Describe and Conclude: On Exploiting the Structure Information of Chest X-ray Reports","authors":["Jing, Baoyu","Wang, Zeya","Xing, Eric"],"emails":["baoyu.jing@petuum.com","zeya.wang@petuum.com","eric.xing@petuum.com"],"author_id":["baoyu-jing","zeya-wang","eric-xing"],"abstract":"Chest X-Ray (CXR) images are commonly used for clinical screening and diagnosis. Automatically writing reports for these images can considerably lighten the workload of radiologists for summarizing descriptive findings and conclusive impressions. The complex structures between and within sections of the reports pose a great challenge to the automatic report generation. Specifically, the section Impression is a diagnostic summarization over the section Findings; and the appearance of normality dominates each section over that of abnormality. Existing studies rarely explore and consider this fundamental structure information. In this work, we propose a novel framework which exploits the structure information between and within report sections for generating CXR imaging reports. First, we propose a two-stage strategy that explicitly models the relationship between Findings and Impression. Second, we design a novel co-operative multi-agent system that implicitly captures the imbalanced distribution between abnormality and normality. Experiments on two CXR report datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of various evaluation metrics.
