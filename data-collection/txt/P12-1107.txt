Abstract

In this paper we describe a method for simpli-
fying sentences using Phrase Based Machine
Translation, augmented with a re-ranking
heuristic based on dissimilarity, and trained on
a monolingual parallel corpus. We compare
our system to a word-substitution baseline and
two state-of-the-art systems, all trained and
tested on paired sentences from the English
part of Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. Hu-
man test subjects judge the output of the dif-
ferent systems. Analysing the judgements
shows that by relatively careful phrase-based
paraphrasing our model achieves similar sim-
plification results to state-of-the-art systems,
while generating better formed output. We
also argue that text readability metrics such
as the Flesch-Kincaid grade level should be
used with caution when evaluating the output
of simplification systems.

1 Introduction

Sentence simplification can be defined as the process
of producing a simplified version of a sentence by
changing some of the lexical material and grammat-
ical structure of that sentence, while still preserving
the semantic content of the original sentence, in or-
der to ease its understanding. Particularly language
learners (Siddharthan, 2002), people with reading
disabilities (Inui et al., 2003) such as aphasia (Car-
roll et al., 1999), and low-literacy readers (Watanabe
et al., 2009) can benefit from this application. It can
serve to generate output in a specific limited format,
such as subtitles (Daelemans et al., 2004). Sentence
simplification can also serve to preprocess the input

of other tasks, such as summarization (Knight and
Marcu, 2000), parsing, machine translation (Chan-
drasekar et al., 1996), semantic role labeling (Vick-
rey and Koller, 2008) or sentence fusion (Filippova
and Strube, 2008).

The goal of simplification is to achieve an im-
provement in readability, defined as the ease with
which a text can be understood. Some of the factors
that are known to help increase the readability of text
are the vocabulary used, the length of the sentences,
the syntactic structures present in the text, and the
usage of discourse markers. One effort to create a
simple version of English at the vocabulary level has
been the creation of Basic English by Charles Kay
Ogden. Basic English is a controlled language with
a basic vocabulary consisting of 850 words. Accord-
ing to Ogden, 90 percent of all dictionary entries can
be paraphrased using these 850 words. An exam-
ple of a resource that is written using mainly Basic
English is the English Simple Wikipedia. Articles
on English Simple Wikipedia are similar to articles
found in the traditional English Wikipedia, but writ-
ten using a limited vocabulary (using Basic English
where possible). Generally the structure of the sen-
tences in English Simple Wikipedia is less compli-
cated and the sentences are somewhat shorter than
those found in English Wikipedia; we offer more de-
tailed statistics below.

1.1 Related work

Most earlier work on sentence simplification
adopted rule-based approaches. A frequently ap-
plied type of rule, aimed to reduce overall sentence
length, splits long sentences on the basis of syntactic

1015



information (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Car-
roll et al., 1998; Canning et al., 2000; Vickrey and
Koller, 2008). There has also been work on lexi-
cal substitution for simplification, where the aim is
to substitute difficult words with simpler synonyms,
derived from WordNet or dictionaries (Inui et al.,
2003).

Zhu et al. (2010) examine the use of paired doc-
uments in English Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia
for a data-driven approach to the sentence simplifi-
cation task. They propose a probabilistic, syntax-
based machine translation approach to the problem
and compare against a baseline of no simplification
and a phrase-based machine translation approach.
In a similar vein, Coster and Kauchak (2011) use
a parallel corpus of paired documents from Sim-
ple Wikipedia and Wikipedia to train a phrase-based
machine translation model coupled with a deletion
model. Another useful resource is the edit his-
tory of Simple Wikipedia, from which simplifica-
tions can be learned (Yatskar et al., 2010). Woods-
end and Lapata (2011) investigate the use of Simple
Wikipedia edit histories and an aligned Wikipedia–
Simple Wikipedia corpus to induce a model based
on quasi-synchronous grammar. They select the
most appropriate simplification by using integer lin-
ear programming.

We follow Zhu et al. (2010) and Coster and
Kauchak (2011) in proposing that sentence simpli-
fication can be approached as a monolingual ma-
chine translation task, where the source and target
languages are the same and where the output should
be simpler in form from the input but similar in
meaning. We differ from the approach of Zhu et
al. (2010) in the sense that we do not take syntac-
tic information into account; we rely on PBMT to
do its work and implicitly learn simplifying para-
phrasings of phrases. Our approach differs from
Coster and Kauchak (2011) in the sense that instead
of focusing on deletion in the PBMT decoding stage,
we focus on dissimilarity, as simplification does not
necessarily imply shortening (Woodsend and Lap-
ata, 2011), or as the Simple Wikipedia guidelines
state, “simpler does not mean short”1. Table 1.1
shows the average sentence length and the average

Page/Introduction

word length for Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia
sentences in the PWKP dataset used in this study
(Zhu et al., 2010). These numbers suggest that, al-
though the selection criteria for sentences to be in-
cluded in this dataset are biased (see Section 2.2),
Simple Wikipedia sentences are about 17% shorter,
while the average word length is virtually equal.

PWKP dataset (Zhu et al., 2010).

Statistical machine translation (SMT) has already
been successfully applied to the related task of para-
phrasing (Quirk et al., 2004; Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005; Madnani et al., 2007; Callison-Burch,
2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Wubben et al., 2010). SMT
typically makes use of large parallel corpora to train
a model on. These corpora need to be aligned at
the sentence level. Large parallel corpora, such as
the multilingual proceedings of the European Parlia-
ment (Europarl), are readily available for many lan-
guages. Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT)
is a form of SMT where the translation model aims
to translate longer sequences of words (“phrases”)
in one go, solving part of the word ordering problem
along the way that would be left to the target lan-
guage model in a word-based SMT system. PMBT
operates purely on statistics and no linguistic knowl-
edge is involved in the process: the phrases that are
aligned are motivated statistically, rather than lin-
guistically. This makes PBMT adaptable to any lan-
guage pair for which there is a parallel corpus avail-
able. The PBMT model makes use of a translation
model, derived from the parallel corpus, and a lan-
guage model, derived from a monolingual corpus in
the target language. The language model is typically
an n-gram model with smoothing. For any given in-
put sentence, a search is carried out producing an
n-best list of candidate translations, ranked by the
decoder score, a complex scoring function includ-
ing likelihood scores from the translation model,
and the target language model. In principle, all of
this should be transportable to a data-driven machine
translation account of sentence simplification, pro-

1016



vided that a parallel corpus is available that pairs text
to simplified versions of that text.

1.2 This study

In this work we aim to investigate the use of phrase-
based machine translation modified with a dissim-
ilarity component for the task of sentence simplifi-
cation. While Zhu et al. (2010) have demonstrated
that their approach outperforms a PBMT approach
in terms of Flesch Reading Ease test scores, we are
not aware of any studies that evaluate PBMT for sen-
tence simplification with human judgements. In this
study we evaluate the output of Zhu et al. (2010)
(henceforth referred to as ‘Zhu’), Woodsend and La-
pata (2011) (henceforth referred to as ‘RevILP’),
our PBMT based system with dissimilarity-based
re-ranking (henceforth referred to as ‘PBMT-R’), a
word-substitution baseline, and, as a gold standard,
the original Simple Wikipedia sentences. We will
first discuss the baseline, followed by the Zhu sys-
tem, the RevILP system, and our PBMT-R system
in Section 2. We then describe the experiment with
human judges in Section 3, and its results in Sec-
tion 4. We close this paper by critically discussing
our results in Section 5.

2 Sentence Simplification Models

2.1 Word-Substitution Baseline

The word substitution baseline replaces words in
the source sentence with (near-)synonyms that are
more likely according to a language model. For
each noun, adjective and verb in the sentence this
model takes that word and its part-of-speech tag
and retrieves from WordNet all synonyms from all
synsets the word occurs in. The word is then re-
placed by all of its synset words, and each replace-
ment is scored by a SRILM language model (Stol-
cke, 2002) with probabilities that are obtained from
training on the Simple Wikipedia data. The alter-
native that has the highest probability according to
the language model is kept. If no relevant alterna-
tive is found, the word is left unchanged. We use
the Memory-Based Tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996)
trained on the Brown corpus to compute the part-of-
speech tags. The WordNet::QueryData2 Perl mod-

2http://search.cpan.org/dist/
WordNet-QueryData/QueryData.pm

ule is used to query WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).

2.2 Zhu et al.
Zhu et al. (2010) learn a sentence simplification
model which is able to perform four rewrite op-
erations on the parse trees of the input sentences,
namely substitution, reordering, splitting, and dele-
tion. Their model is inspired by syntax-based
SMT (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and consists of
a language model, a translation model and a de-
coder. The four mentioned simplification opera-
tions together form the translation model. Their
model is trained on a corpus containing aligned sen-
tences from English Wikipedia and English Simple
Wikipedia called PWKP. The PWKP dataset con-
sists of 108,016 pairs of aligned lines from 65,133
Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia articles. These ar-
ticles were paired by following the “interlanguage
link”3. TF*IDF at the sentence level was used to
align the sentences in the different articles (Nelken
and Shieber, 2006).

Zhu et al. (2010) evaluate their system using
BLEU and NIST scores, as well as various read-
ability scores that only take into account the output
sentence, such as the Flesch Reading Ease test and
n-gram language model perplexity. Although their
system outperforms several baselines at the level of
these readability metrics, they do not achieve better
when evaluated with BLEU or NIST.

2.3 RevILP
Woodsend and Lapata’s (2011) model is based
on quasi-synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner,
2006). Quasi-synchronous grammar generates a
loose alignment between parse trees. It operates on
individual sentences annotated with syntactic infor-
mation in the form of phrase structure trees. Quasi-
synchronous grammar is used to generate all pos-
sible rewrite operations, after which integer linear
programming is employed to select the most ap-
propriate simplification. Their model is trained on
two different datasets: one containing alignments
between Wikipedia and English Simple Wikipedia
(AlignILP), and one containing alignments between
edits in the revision history of Simple Wikipedia
(RevILP). RevILP performs best according to the

1017



human judgements conducted in their study. They
show that it achieves better scores than Zhu et al.
(2010)’s system and is not scored significantly dif-
ferently from English Simple Wikipedia. In this
study we compare against their best performing sys-
tem, the RevILP system.

2.4 PBMT-R

We use the Moses software to train a PBMT
model (Koehn et al., 2007). The data we use is the
PWKP dataset created by Zhu et al. (2010). In gen-
eral, a statistical machine translation model finds a
best translation ẽ of a text in language f to a text
in language e by combining a translation model that

finds the most likely translation p(f |e) with a lan-
guage model that outputs the most likely sentence
p(e):

ẽ = argmax
e∈e∗

p(f |e)p(e)

The GIZA++ statistical alignment package is
used to perform the word alignments, which are
later combined into phrase alignments in the Moses
pipeline (Och and Ney, 2003) to build the sentence
simplification model. GIZA++ utilizes IBM Models
1 to 5 and an HMM word alignment model to find
statistically motivated alignments between words.
We first tokenize and lowercase all data and use all
unique sentences from the Simple Wikipedia part
of the PWKP training set to train an n-gram lan-
guage model with the SRILM toolkit to learn the
probabilities of different n-grams. Then we invoke
the GIZA++ aligner using the training simplifica-
tion pairs. We run GIZA++ with standard settings
and we perform no optimization. This results in a
phrase table containing phrase pairs from Wikipedia
and Simple Wikipedia and their conditional proba-
bilities as assigned by Moses. Finally, we use the
Moses decoder to generate simplifications for the
sentences in the test set. For each sentence we let
the system generate the ten best distinct solutions
(or less, if fewer than ten solutions are generated) as
ranked by Moses.

Arguably, dissimilarity is a key factor in simpli-
fication (and in paraphrasing in general). As output
we would like to be able to select fluent sentences
that adequately convey the meaning of the original
input, yet that contain differences that operational-
ize the intended simplification. When training our
PBMT system on the PWKP data we may assume
that the system learns to simplify automatically, yet
there is no aspect of the decoder function in Moses
that is sensitive to the fact that it should try to be
different from the input – Moses may well trans-
late input to unchanged output, as much of our train-
ing data consists of partially equal input and output
strings.

To expand the functionality of Moses in the in-
tended direction we perform post-hoc re-ranking on
the output based on dissimilarity to the input. We
do this to select output that is as different as possi-
ble from the source sentence, so that it ideally con-

1018



tains multiple simplifications; at the same time, we
base our re-ranking on a top-n of output candidates
according to Moses, with a small n, to ensure that
the quality of the output in terms of fluency and ade-
quacy is also controlled for. Setting n = 10, for each
source sentence we re-rank the ten best sentences
as scored by the decoder according to the Leven-
shtein Distance (or edit distance) measure (Leven-
shtein, 1966) at the word level between the input
and output sentence, counting the minimum num-
ber of edits needed to transform the source string
into the target string, where the allowable edit op-
erations are insertion, deletion, and substitution of a
single word. In case of a tie in Levenshtein Distance,
we select the sequence with the better decoder score.
When Moses is unable to generate ten different sen-
tences, we select from the lower number of outputs.
Figure 1 displays Levenshtein Distance and Flesch-
Kincaid grade level scores for different values of n.
We use the Lingua::EN::Fathom module4 to calcu-
late Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores. The read-
ability score stays more or less the same, indicating
no relation between n and readability. The average
edit distance starts out at just above 2 when selecting
the 1-best output string, and increases roughly until
n = 10.

2.5 Descriptive statistics
Table 2 displays the average edit distance and the
percentage of cases in which no edits were per-
formed for each of the systems and for Simple
Wikipedia. We see that the Levenshtein distance be-
tween Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia is the most
substantial with an average of 12.3 edits. Given
that the average number of tokens is about 25 for
Wikipedia and 21 for Simple Wikipedia (cf. Ta-
ble 1.1), these numbers indicate that the changes in
Simple Wikipedia go substantially beyond the aver-
age four-word length difference. On average, eight
more words are interchanged for other words. About
half of the original tokens in the source sentence do
not return in the output. Of the three simplifica-
tion systems, the Zhu system (7.95) and the RevILP
(7.18) attain similar edit distances, less substantial
than the edits in Simple Wikipedia, but still consid-

erable compared to the baseline word-substitution
system (4.26) and PBMT-R (3.08). Our system is
clearly conservative in its edits.

Table 2: Levenshtein Distance and percentage of unal-
tered output sentences.

On the other hand, we observe some differences
in the percentage of cases in which the systems de-
cide to produce a sentence identical to the input.
In 22 percent of the cases the RevILP system does
not alter the sentence. The other systems make this
decision about as often as the gold standard, Sim-
ple Wikipedia, where only 3% of sentences remain
unchanged. The word-substitution baseline always
manages to make at least one change.

3 Evaluation

3.1 Participants

Participants were 46 students of Tilburg University,
who participated for partial course credits. All were
native speakers of Dutch, and all were proficient in
English, having taken a course on Academic English
at University level.

3.2 Materials

We use the test set used by Zhu et al. (2010) and
Woodsend and Lapata (2011). This test set consists
of 100 sentences from articles on English Wikipedia,
paired with sentences from corresponding articles in
English Simple Wikipedia. We selected only those
sentences where every system would perform min-
imally one edit, because we only want to compare
the different systems when they actually generate al-
tered, assumedly simplified output. From this sub-
set we randomly pick 20 source sentences, result-
ing in 20 clusters of one source sentence and 5 sim-
plified sentences, as generated by humans (Simple
Wikipedia) and the four systems.

1019



3.3 Procedure

The participants were told that they participated in
the evaluation of a system that could simplify sen-
tences, and that they would see one source sentence
and five automatically simplified versions of that
sentence. They were not informed of the fact that we
evaluated in fact four different systems and the orig-
inal Simple Wikipedia sentence. Following earlier
evaluation studies (Doddington, 2002; Woodsend
and Lapata, 2011), we asked participants to evalu-
ate Simplicity, Fluency and Adequacy of the target
headlines on a five point Likert scale. Fluency was
defined in the instructions as the extent to which a
sentence is proper, grammatical English. Adequacy
was defined as the extent to which the sentence has
the same meaning as the source sentence. Simplic-
ity was defined as the extent to which the sentence
was simpler than the original and thus easier to un-
derstand. The order in which the clusters had to be
judged was randomized and the order of the output
of the various systems was randomized as well.

4 Results

4.1 Automatic measures

The results of the automatic measures are displayed
in Table 3. In terms of the Flesch-Kincaid grade
level score, where lower scores are better, the Zhu
system scores best, with 7.86 even lower than Sim-
ple Wikipedia (8.57). Increasingly worse Flesch-
Kincaid scores are produced by RevILP (8.61) and
PBMT-R (13.38), while the word substitution base-
line scores worst (14.64). With regard to the BLEU
score, where Simple Wikipedia is the reference, the
PBMT-R system scores highest with 0.43, followed
by the RevILP system (0.42) and the Zhu system
(0.38). The word substitution baseline scores low-
est with a BLEU score of 0.34.

RevILP 8.61 0.42
PBMT-R 13.38 0.43

4.2 Human judgements

To test for significance we ran repeated mea-
sures analyses of variance with system (Sim-
ple Wikipedia, PBMT-R, Zhu, RevILP, word-
substitution baseline) as the independent variable,
and the three individual metrics as well as their com-
bined mean as the dependent variables. Mauchlys
test for sphericity was used to test for homogeneity
of variance, and when this test was significant we
applied a Greenhouse-Geisser correction on the de-
grees of freedom (for the purpose of readability we
report the normal degrees of freedom in these cases).
Planned pairwise comparisons were made with the
Bonferroni method. Table 4 displays these results.

First, we consider the 3 metrics in isolation, be-
ginning with Fluency. We find that participants
rated the Fluency of the simplified sentences from
the four systems and Simple Wikipedia differently,
F (4, 180) = 178.436, p < .001, η2p = .799. The
word-substitution baseline, Simple Wikipedia and
PBMT-R receive the highest scores (3.86, 3.84 and
3.83 respectively) and don’t achieve significantly
different scores on this dimension. All other pair-
wise comparisons are significant at p < .001. Rev-
ILP attains a score of 3.18, while the Zhu system
achieves the lowest mean judgement score of 2.59.

Participants also rated the systems significantly
differently on the Adequacy scale, F (4, 180) =
116.509, p < .001, η2p = .721. PBMT-R scores
highest (3.71), followed by the word-substitution
baseline (3.58), RevILP (3.28), and then by Simple
Wikipedia (2.91) and the Zhu system (2.82). Sim-
ple Wikipedia and the Zhu system do not differ sig-
nificantly, and all other pairwise comparisons are
significant at p < .001. The low score of Simple
Wikipedia indicates indirectly that the human edi-
tors of Simple Wikipedia texts often choose to devi-
ate quite markedly from the meaning of the original
text.

Key to the task of simplification are the hu-
man judgements of Simplicity. Participants rated
the Simplicity of the output from the four sys-
tems and Simple Wikipedia differently, F (4, 180) =
74.959, p < .001, η2p = .625. Simple Wikipedia
scores highest (3.68) and the word substitution base-
line scores lowest (2.42). Between them are the
RevILP (2.96), Zhu (2.93) and PBMT-R (2.88) sys-

1020

Table 5: Pearson correlation between the different dimensions as assigned by humans and the automatic metrics.
Scores marked * are significant at p < .05 and scores marked ** are significant at p < .01

tems, which do not score significantly differently
from each other. All other pairwise comparisons are
significant at p < .001.

Finally we report on a combined score created by
averaging over the Fluency, Adequacy and Simplic-
ity scores. Inspection of this score, displayed in the
leftmost column of Table 4, reveals that the PBMT-
R system and Simple Wikipedia score best (3.47
and 3.46 respectively), followed by the word substi-
tution baseline (3.39), which in turn scores higher
than RevILP (3.13) and the Zhu system (2.78).
We find that participants rated the systems signifi-
cantly differently overall, F (4, 180) = 98.880, p <
.001, η2p = .687. All pairwise comparisons were sta-
tistically significant (p < .01), except the one be-
tween the PBMT-R system and Simple Wikipedia.

4.3 Correlations
Table 5 displays the correlations between the scores
assigned by humans (Fluency, Adequacy and Sim-
plicity) and the automatic metrics (Flesch-Kincaid
and BLEU). We see a significant correlation be-
tween Fluency and Adequacy (0.45), as well as be-
tween Fluency and Simplicity (0.24). There is a neg-
ative significant correlation between Flesch-Kincaid
scores and Simplicity (-0.45) while there is a posi-
tive significant correlation between Flesch-Kincaid
and Adequacy and Fluency. The significant correla-
tions between BLEU and Simplicity (0.42) and Flu-
ency (0.26) are both in the positive direction. There
is no significant correlation between BLEU and Ad-

equacy, indicating BLEU’s relative weakness in as-
sessing the semantic overlap between input and out-
put. BLEU and Flesch-Kincaid do not show a sig-
nificant correlation.

5 Discussion

We conclude that a phrase-based machine trans-
lation system with added dissimilarity-based re-
ranking of the best ten output sentences can suc-
cessfully be used to perform sentence simplifica-
tion. Even though the system merely performs
phrase-based machine translation and is not specif-
ically geared towards simplification were it not for
the dissimilarity-based re-ranking of the output, it
performs not significantly differently from state-of-
the-art sentence simplification systems in terms of
human-judged Simplification. In terms of Fluency
and Adequacy our system is judged to perform sig-
nificantly better. From the relatively low average
numbers of edits made by our system we can con-
clude that our system performs relatively small num-
bers of changes to the input, that still constitute as
sensible simplifications. It does not split sentences
(which the Zhu and RevILP systems regularly do);
it only rephrases phrases. Yet, it does this better
than a word-substitution baseline, which can also be
considered a conservative approach; this is reflected
in the baseline’s high Fluency score (roughly equal
to PBMT-R and Simple Wikipedia) and Adequacy
score (only slightly worse than PBMT-R).

him to twenty years to life , slightly less than the maximum possible of twenty-five years to
life .

Zhu the judge ordered that chapman should get psychiatric treatment . in prison and sentenced
him to twenty years to life , less maximum possible of twenty-five years to life .

RevILP the judge ordered that chapman should will get psychiatric treatment in prison . he sentenced
him to twenty years to life to life .

PBMT-R the judge ordered that chapman should get psychiatric treatment in prison and sentenced him
to twenty years to life , a little bit less than the highest possible to twenty-five years to life .

Table 6: Example output

The output of all systems, the original and the
simplified version of an example sentence from the
PWKP dataset is displayed in Table 6. The Simple
Wikipedia sentences illustrate that significant por-
tions of the original sentences may be dropped, and
parts of the semantics of the original sentence dis-
carded. We also see the Zhu and RevILP systems
resorting to splitting the original sentence in two,
leading to better Flesch-Kincaid scores. The word-
substitution baseline changes ‘receive’ in ‘have’,
while the PBMT-R system changes the same ‘re-
ceive’ in ’get’, ‘slightly’ to ‘a little bit’, and ‘maxi-
mum’ to ‘highest’.

In terms of automatic measures we see that the
Zhu system scores particularly well on the Flesch-
Kincaid metric, while the RevILP system and our
PBMT-R system achieve the highest BLEU scores.
We believe that for the evaluation of sentence sim-
plification, BLEU is a more appropriate metric than
Flesch-Kincaid or a similar readability metric, al-
though it should be noted that BLEU was found only
to correlate significantly with Fluency, not with Ad-
equacy. While BLEU and NIST may be used with
this in mind, readability metrics should be avoided
altogether in our view. Where machine translation
evaluation metrics such as BLEU take into account
gold references, readability metrics only take into
account characteristics of the sentence such as word
length and sentence length, and ignore grammatical-
ity or the semantic adequacy of the content of the
output sentence, which BLEU is aimed to implic-
itly approximate by measuring overlap in n-grams.

Arguably, readability metrics are best suited to be
applied to texts that can be considered grammati-
cal and meaningful, which is not necessarily true for
the output of simplification algorithms. A disrup-
tive example that would illustrate this point would
be a system that would randomly split original sen-
tences in two or more sequences, achieving consid-
erably lower Flesch-Kincaid scores, yet damaging
the grammaticality and semantic coherence of the
original text, as is evidenced by the negative cor-
relation for Simplicity and positive correlations for
Fluency and Adequacy in Table 5.

In the future we would like to investigate how we
can boost the number of edits the system performs,
while still producing grammatical and meaning-
preserving output. Although the comparison against
the Zhu system, which uses syntax-driven machine
translation, shows no clear benefit for syntax-based
machine translation, it may still be the case that ap-
proaches such as Hiero (Chiang et al., 2005) and
Joshua (Li et al., 2009), enhanced by dissimilarity-
based re-ranking, would improve over our current
system. Furthermore, typical simplification oper-
ations such as sentence splitting and more radical
syntax alterations or even document-level operations
such as manipulations of the co-reference structure
would be interesting to implement and test
