Abstract

In this study, we tackle the question of pos-tagging written Occitan, a lesser-resourced language
with multiple dialects each containing several varieties. For pos-tagging, we use a supervised
machine learning approach, requiring annotated training and evaluation corpora and optionally a
lexicon, all of which were prepared as part of the study. Although we evaluate two dialects of
Occitan, Lengadocian and Gascon, the training material and lexicon concern only Lengadocian.
We concluded that reasonable results (> 89% accuracy) are possible with a very limited training
corpus (2500 tokens), as long as it is compensated by intensive use of the lexicon. Results are
much lower across dialects, and pointers are provided for improvement. Finally, we compare the
relative contribution of more training material vs. a larger lexicon, and conclude that within our
configuration, spending effort on lexicon construction yields higher returns.

1 Introduction

Pos-tagging is one of the first steps in many Natural Language Processing chains, and generally requires
annotated corpora and lexicons to function properly. Substantial efforts are needed to create such re-
sources, few of which exist in the required format for less-resourced languages like Occitan. Creating
them is more challenging since less-resourced languages present spelling and dialectal variations and are
not necessarily standardized. In this paper, we apply a tool that was initially developed for rich-resourced
languages (French and English), the pos-tagger Talismane, to different varieties and dialects of literary
Occitan. We evaluate whether adapting this tool with only little annotated data is worthwhile.

Various efforts have been made recently to adapt pos-taggers to lesser-resourced languages. Täckström
et al. (2013) use a semi-supervised approach based on aligned bitext between a resource-rich and
resource-poor language, and achieve substantial gains. In our case, without an aligned bitext resource,
we were unable to attempt this approach. Garrette et al. (2013) perform an experiment giving annotators
limited time (4 hours) to annotate either training corpora or lexicons (which they call token and type
annotation) for 2 low-resourced languages. They conclude that lexicons provide higher initial gains.
However, whereas their lexicons are constructed by automatically selecting the most frequent words
from large unannotated corpora, our study can make use of existing wide-coverage lexical resources.
Scherrer and Sagot (2013) use an approach where lexical cognates are identified between a resource-rich
and resource-poor language, and their pos-tags are then used to help tagging the resource-poor language.
Their approach is interesting for languages, unlike Occitan, with no lexical resources available. However,
even cross-language approaches require a small manually-annotated corpus for accurate evaluation. It
seems simpler to begin by using this corpus for both training and evaluation before attempting more com-
plex approaches. A finer evaluation would then be required to determine whether data quality (a small
purpose-built corpus) or quantity (a large cross-language corpus) are more important for the present task.

A pos-tagger for Occitan was also developped as an intermediate step for machine translation in Aper-
tium (Armentano i Oller and Forcada, 2006; Sánchez-Martınez et al., 2007), where the most likely

translation is used to select the correct pos-tags. However, since they only evaluate the resulting transla-
tion quality, and since Apertium is not available as a standalone pos-tagger, we were unable to perform
comparisons.

Our article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we give an overview of the Occitan language and
its dialects. In Section 3, we present the software used, Talismane, as well as the feature and rule sets
applied. In Section 4, we discuss the various resources that were constructed for this study, including
corpora and lexica. In Section 5 we give the experimental setup, and discuss the results in Section 6.

2 Occitan language

Occitan is a romance language spoken in southern France and in several valleys of Spain and Italy.
The number of speakers is hard to estimate: according to several studies it might reasonably be situated

around 500,000 speakers. It is even harder to evaluate the number of people with an interest in Occitan.
According to a socio-linguistic survey carried out in the Midi-Pyrénées Region in 2010, 4% of the pop-
ulation are native or fluent speakers, 14% are speakers with an average competence and 32% understand
the language, with different degrees of competence, giving an estimated total of 1.5 million people for
this region alone. The interest in Occitan is supported by a sizable network of non-profit associations.
Among others, the primary and secondary immersive bilingual school system Calandreta, IEO (Institut
d’Estudis Occitans) and CFPO (Centre de Formacion Professionala Occitan) provide opportunities for
learning Occitan at any age. Occitan is also present in the French national education system in bilingual
classes at the primary school level; as optional courses at the secondary school level; and as a major or
optional classes in several universities.

2.1 Occitan dialects

Occitan is not standardized as a whole. It has several varieties organized into dialects. The most widely
accepted classification proposed by Bec (1995) includes Auvernhat, Gascon, Lengadocian, Lemosin,
Provençau and Vivaroaupenc.

In this article we focus on two Occitan dialects: Lengadocian, spoken in a zone delimited by the
Rhône, the Garonne and the Mediterranean Sea; and Gascon, spoken in a zone delimited by the Pyrenees,
the Garonne, and the Atlantic Ocean. Some examples of lexical variation from Lengadocian to Gascon
include the transformation of a Latin f into an h (filh/hilh), dropping the intervocalic n (luna/lua) and
metathesis of the r (cabra/craba) (Bec, 1995).

We assume that probabilities of pos-tag sequences will be fairly similar between Lengadocian and
Gascon in most cases. However, several examples below show non-lexical differences between the two
dialects that result in different pos-tag distributions.

1. Gascon has enunciative particles: “que” for affirmative sentences, “be” for exclamatory sentences,
and “e” for interrogative sentences and subordinate clauses. There is no equivalent in Lengadocian.
- Example: “I’m buying bread and apples”. Gascon: “Que crompi pans e pomas.” Lengadocian:
“Compri de pans e de pomas.”

2. There is no indefinite or partitive article in Gascon.
- Example: “He’s catching birds.” Gascon: “Que gaha ausèths.” Lengadocian: “Trapa d’aucèls.”
- Example: “I want some water.” Gascon: “Que vòli aiga.” Lengadocian: “Vòli d’aiga.”

3. Object and reflective clitics occur more often after the verb in Gascon than in Lengadocian.
- Example: “To come in and get served?” Gascon: “Entrar e hèr-se servir ?” Lengadocian:
“Dintrar e se far servir ?”

4. Double-negatives in Gascon: the preceding “ne/no” is mandatory in Gascon, but not in Lengado-
cian.
- Example: “He can’t hear anything.” Gascon: “N’enten pas arren.” Lengadocian: “Enten pas
ren.”

2.2 Written Occitan

Written Occitan first appeared in medieval times, with all dialects represented in literature. This results
in a lot of inter- and intra-dialectal variation within the texts. This geolinguistic variation corresponds
to (i) variations in spelling reflecting variations in pronunciation (for instance contes/condes) and (ii)
lexical variations (for instance pomas de terra/mandòrra). Numerous spelling conventions account for
additional variation within Occitan text. The spelling used in medieval times is nowadays called the
“troubadour spelling”. This spelling gradually disappeared with the decline of literary production. Since
the 19th century, two major spelling conventions can be distinguished: the first was influenced by French
spelling, and includes Mistral’s spelling in Provence and the Gaston Febus’ spelling in Bearn; the second,
called “classical spelling” and inspired by the troubador spelling, appeared in the 20th century. It is a
unified spelling convention distributed across all of the Occitan territories (Sibille, 2007). Diachronic
variation corresponds to changes in spelling conventions over time (for instance the evolution in the
spelling of conjugated verbs: avian vs. aviàn). Embracing all dialectal and spelling variations is one of
the main objectives of the BaTelÒc project.

2.3 BaTelÒc Project

The BaTelÒc project (Bras and Thomas, 2011; Bras and Vergez-Couret, 2013) aims at creating a wide-
coverage collection of written texts in Occitan, including literature (prose, drama and poetry) as well as
other genres such as technical texts and newspapers. The texts aim to cover the modern and contempo-
rary periods, as well as all dialectal and spelling varieties. More than one million words have already
been gathered. The text base is also designed to provide online tools for interrogating texts, for example
a concordancer to observe key forms in context. In the future, the aim is to enrich the text base with
linguistic annotations, such as pos-tags. These would allow new querying possibilities, e.g. the disam-
biguation of homographs such as poder as a common noun (“power”) and poder as a verb (“be able to”).
In order to provide such annotations, Part-Of-Speech annotation tools are required. We therefore decided
to use a probabilistic pos-tagger based on supervised machine learning methods: Talismane.

3 The Talismane pos-tagger

The present study trained the open source Talismane pos-tagger (Urieli, 2013) on an Occitan training
corpus. Talismane has already been applied to English and French pos-tagging, attaining an accuracy
≈ 97% (Urieli, 2014). It allows for the incorporation of a lexicon both as training features and as analysis
rules. In terms of features, this comes down to saying, “if the word X is listed in the lexicon as a common
noun, then it is more likely to be a common noun”. This information is incorporated into the statistical
model during training, along with other features listed below. Analysis rules override the statistical
model’s decisions during analysis, either imposing or prohibiting the choice of a certain category. For
example, a rule might say, “the word X cannot be assigned the closed category preposition unless it is
listed as a preposition in the lexicon”.

To select the machine learning configuration of the Occitan pos-tagger, we performed a grid search
of different classifier types and parameters, and settled on a linear SVM classifier with � = 0.1 and
C = 0.5.

3.1 Features

We used the identical feature set for Occitan as the one used by Talismane for French and English.
These include, for the token currently being analysed: W the word form; P each of the token’s possible
pos-tags according to the lexicon; L each of the token’s possible lemmas according to the lexicon; U
whether the current token is unknown in the lexicon; 1st whether the token is the first in the sentence;
Last whether the token is the last in the sentence; Sfx the last n letters in the token; as well as various
regular expression features testing whether the token starts with a capital letter, contains a dash, a space
or a period, or contains only capital letters.

We also used the following additional features for the tokens before and after the current to-
ken (where the subscript indicates the position of the token with respect to the current token):

23



W−1,W1, P−1, P1, L−1, L1, U1, where P−1 looks at the pos-tag assigned to the previous token, and
is thus the standard bigram feature. We also included various two-token and three-token combinations
of all of the above basic features, e.g. P−2P−1 giving the standard trigram feature.

3.2 Rules
The following rules were defined around closed class pos-tags (i.e. non-productive functional categories)
and open class pos-tags (i.e. productive lexical categories).

• Closed classes: for each closed class pos-tag (e.g. prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, etc.), only
allow the pos-tagger to assign this pos-tag if it exists in the lexicon. This prevents us, for example,
from inventing new prepositions.

• Open classes: do not assign an open class pos-tag (e.g. common noun, adjective, etc.) to a token if
it is only listed with closed classes in the lexicon. This prevents us, for example, from assigning a
tag such as “common noun” to the token “lo” (“the”).

• Rules which automatically assign the pos-tags Card and Pct respectively to numbers and punctu-
ation. These were applied systematically in all experiments.

4 Resources

For Talismane to function properly, various resources are required: a training corpus from which the
statistical model is learned, one or more evaluation corpora to evaluate performance, and optionally a
lexicon for wide-coverage features and rules. These resources all rely on a tagset specifically designed
for Occitan, shown in Table 1.

4.1 Lexicon and tagset
In the present study, we decided to construct a lexicon for one dialect only, the Lengadocian dialect,
corresponding to our training corpus.

The lexicon was built from available digital resources: the Laus dictionary of Lengadocian (Laus,
2005), as well as certain closed-class entries and proper nouns from the Apertium lexicon. The Laus
dictionary in particular covers different varieties of Lengadocian. For example, the entry for “night”
includes three variants: nuèch / nuèit / nuòch. Inflected forms for verbs were gathered from Lo congrès
permanent de la lenga occitana, which provides a complete verb-conjugation module1. A script was
written to automatically generate inflected forms for adjectives, nouns and past participles from the base
form entries. The number of entries for each pos-tag and total count are given in Table 1.

4.2 Training corpus
For training Talismane, a homogeneous corpus in the Lengadocian dialect was extracted from a single
novel: E la barta floriguèt by Enric Molin, an Occitan author from the Rouergue region. Since the present
study concentrates on differences between dialects and varieties, no attempt was made to construct a
balanced training corpus. The corpus contains around 2500 tokens manually annotated with pos-tags,
lemmas, and additional morpho-syntactic information (grammatical gender, number, person, tense and
mood). The first 1000 tokens were annotated separately by three annotators, who then consolidated
their annotations into a single gold standard, with an annotation guide. The remaining 1500 tokens were
annotated by a single annotator, who consulted the others in cases of doubt.

In the present study, the annotated lemmas and additional morpho-syntactic information were not used.

4.3 Evaluation corpora
For evaluation, three different corpora were compiled: the first one, the Rouergue corpus, was extracted
from: Los crocants de Roergue by Ferran Delèris, another author from the Rouergue region; the second
one, the Lot corpus, was extracted from Dels camins bartassièrs by Marceu Esquieu, written in another

variety of Lengadocian; the third one, the Gascon corpus, was extracted from Hont blanca de Jan Loı́s
Lavit, representing a variety of Gascon. The three corpora aim at representing different varieties of
Occitan: firstly, two different dialects: Lengadocian and Gascon; secondly, two varieties of Lengadocian:
Rouergue and Lot.

Table 2 shows a statistical comparison of the different corpora. As we can see, the percent of tokens
unseen in the training corpus (excluding punctuation) ranges from 46% for the same dialectal variant
(Rouergue) to 56% for a different dialect (Gascon). The difference is even more striking in terms of
the Lengadocian lexicon: 17% unknown forms in the Rouergue corpus vs. 40% unknown forms in the
Gascon corpus. Closed class coverage is particularly good for the two Lengadocian variants, with only
1.5% and 1% unknown forms, as opposed to 20% in the Gascon corpus.

5 Experiments

The resources we built were designed with several questions in mind:

• Which is the best strategy for each evaluation corpus?
• Is it always useful to apply closed-class rules?
• To what extent can a model built from a training corpus for a single dialectal variety be applied to

other varieties and dialects?

• To what extent can a lexicon for one dialect be applied to another dialect?
• What methods can be used to improve analysis for a dialect different from the training/lexicon

dialect?

Table 2: Training and evaluation corpora

A second range of experiments was designed to answer the following question: Given limited re-
sources, is it better to annotate a larger training corpus, or compile a larger lexicon?

To this end, we divided the training corpus into two halves, train1 and train2. We also created
several sub-lexica: closed classes only (closed), closed classes + half of the open class entries (half1)
closed classes + the other half of the open class entries (half2), the full lexicon (full) and an empty
lexicon (empty). Finally, we tested with and without closed class rules. This gave us a total of 3 training
corpus options × 5 lexicon options × 2 rule options = 30 evaluations per evaluation corpus.

We measured in each evaluation the total accuracy, the precision, recall and f-score for each pos-tag,
and for all open pos-tags and all closed pos-tags combined. These were also measured separately for the
set of tokens known and unknown in the lexicon.

6 Results

6.1 Overall results

Figure 1 shows results for the different lexicons and with/without closed-class rules (+rules on the figure).
Not surprisingly, the best configuration for all evaluation corpora was the full training corpus, the full
lexicon, and closed-class rules applied. This gives an accuracy of 87.02% for the Rouergue corpus,
89.08% for the Lot corpus, and 66.17% for the Gascon corpus. We can see that even a small training
corpus provides reasonable results: almost 90% with only 2500 annotated tokens.

Within a given dialect, variation in style and genre seem more important than variation due to dialectal
varieties: indeed, a training corpus in the Rouergue variety gave better results for an author in the Lot
variety than for another author in the Rouergue variety. Another reason for handling dialects as a whole
is that it would be very difficult and time consuming to construct a separate lexicon for each variety
within a given dialect.

The much lower results for Gascon are expected, given the much lower training corpus coverage and
lexicon coverage shown in Table 2, and the differences in pos-tag distribution presented in Section 2.1.

6.2 Closed class rules

The use of closed-class rules presented in Section 3.2 improved accuracy for all three corpora. The
accuracy rose from 85.88% to 87.02% for the Rouergue corpus, from 88.01% to 89.08% in the Lot
corpus, and 66.10% to 67.16% in the Gascon corpus. The last result is somewhat surprising, given the
fact that 20% of the closed class tokens in the Gascon corpus are unknown in the lexicon.

6.3 Lexicons

The five lexicon setups described above allowed us to compare the contribution of different parts of the
lexicon. Using a lexicon with only closed classes gives a fairly radical increase in all cases: together
with rules, we gain 7.13% for Rouergue, 11.99% for Lot, and 4.9% for Gascon. When we add the full

lexicon with open and closed classes, we see an additional increase of 6.14% for Rouergue, 7.71% for
Lot, and 3.62% for Gascon with respect to a closed-class lexicon only.

The open class gains are not directly correlated to the percentage of unknown words: the Lot corpus
has far more unknown words than the Rouergue corpus, and yet gains more in terms of accuracy when the
lexicon is added. Furthermore, the gains affect unknown words as well, probably through improvement
in tagging of neighboring words and n-gram features: we see an average gain of 8.54% in accuracy
for unknown words in Rouergue between the half1+rules/half2+rules and full+rules configurations, and
17.96% for unknown words in Lot.

6.4 Improving accuracy for other dialects

Given the relatively low score for Gascon, the question is, what can be done to improve this accuracy?
In view of the training corpus in Lengadocian and the differences described in Section 2.1, it is clear that
certain phenomena will be very difficult to detect, especially when Gascon lexical items are combined
with uniquely Gascon pos-tag sequences. Additionally, one Gascon part-of-speech, the enunciative par-
ticle (annotated Pe), is entirely missing from Lengadocian. However, this pos-tag happens to be the most
common one for the word “que”, and the only possibility for the word “be”.

We thus tested the addition of a new rule for Gascon only, stating that “be” is always annotated Pe, and
“que” is annotated Pe whenever it’s found at the start of a sentence, after a coordinating conjunction,
or after a comma. For a total of 30 ennunciative particles, this rule gives us 17 true positives, 1 false
positive, and 13 false negatives, for an f-score of 70.83%. It increases the total accuracy from 67.16% to
69.72%.

Beyond this rule (and possibly other similar rules), improving the accuracy necessarily requires more
resources. Given the gains provided by small but complete closed-class lexica, a priority should thus
be given to constructing a full-coverage closed-class lexicon for Gascon, and replacing the Lengadocian
closed-class lexicon with this one during analysis. It is an open question whether it is better to use a
higher-recall lexicon covering all dialects, or a higher-precision lexicon covering only Gascon. A similar
question concerns training corpora, which are typically much more costly to construct than lexica, given
that dictionaries in digital form are generally already available. Is it better to use a small training corpus
per dialect, or to mix training corpora for all dialects into a larger training corpus? This of course depends
on the degree of similarity between the dialects, and cannot be answered without empirical testing.

27



6.5 Build a training corpus or a lexicon?

To answer the question regarding the relative importance of annotating more training data or compiling
larger lexica, we ran an experiment where the training corpus and open-class lexicon were each divided
into two halves. We then compared the results provided by a single half of the training corpus and
a single half of the lexicon (4 possible combinations) with results provided when including either the
entire training corpus or the entire lexicon, but not both. Since the lexicon covers Lengadocian, we
concentrate on the two Lengadocian corpora only, considering them as a single corpus.

The mean gain for doubling the training corpus from 1,250 tokens to 2,500 tokens is 1.46%, whereas
the mean gain for doubling the open-class lexicon from 110K entries to 220K entries is 4.16%. It is thus
much more productive to double the lexicon size, in our configuration. Note of course that there is no
guarantee that this tendency would continue if we doubled the size of the training corpus and lexicon
again. Also, while it is always possible (albeit costly) to annotate more text, there is a limit to the
available lexical resources that can easily be compiled.

7 Conclusion and perspectives

In the present study, we show that supervised approaches, usually considered too costly for lesser-
resourced languages, can achieve good results (> 89%) with very little annotated material, as long
as wide-coverage lexicon is available. We determined that given a limited amount of time, it is better
to construct a larger lexicon than to annotate more training material. It would be interesting to repeat
this experiment when we have gathered more training material and a wider-coverage lexicon, in order to
view the tendencies in a graphical form.

One of the main objectives of the present study was to test a proof-of-concept for Occitan pos-tagging
and identify guidelines for future efforts in this area. One of the first benefits of our work is that, in
addition to the training and evaluation corpora and lexicon, we now have a functioning pos-tagger which
can help efficiently construct more training and evaluation material, and an annotation guide to help
correct this material.

Many recent studies have used semi-supervised cross-language pos-taggers, resulting in a larger quan-
tity but lower quality of training data. It would be interesting to compare such an approach to our present
supervised approach, as well as seeing whether the two can be combined (e.g. by giving more weight to
the higher quality material during training).

The use of Talismane as a pos-tagger gives us a certain degree of robustness for handling language
variants. Talismane is a hybrid toolkit: on the one hand, it provides robust supervised machine learning
techniques, allowing us to ensure that as more data gets annotated, the results improve. On the other
hand, it allows us to override the statistical models with symbolic rules, thus compensating for the low
representativity of less common phenomena in the limited training material, as well as allowing us to
take into account phenomena specific to the dialect or variety being analysed. The use of rules needs to
be explored more deeply and extended to other phenomena than those explored in the present study.

In terms of the Gascon dialect, although the results are much better than random chance, they still
leave much to be desired. Nevertheless, all of the phenomena observed for Lengadocian applied to
Gascon as well, albeit to a lesser extent: the closed-class lexicon and related rules provided substantial
gains (despite 20% unknown closed-class tokens in the lexicon), and additional gains were provided by
the open-class lexicon. We tested with success a single rule for Gascon around the enunciative particle.
Efforts would now be required to identify additional rules. However, the most promising perspective is
the construction of a lexicon for Gascon, in particular giving full coverage for all closed classes. It is
yet to be determined whether this lexicon should replace the Lengadocian lexicon during analysis, or
complete it. A similar question applies to training corpora: if we annotate a Gascon training corpus,
should it be combined with the Lengadocian corpus or should Gascon be trained separately.

Finally, there is another practical perspective from the present study: to use lists of unknown pos-
tagged words as the initial input for the construction of wider-coverage lexica.
