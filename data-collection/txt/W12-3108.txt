Abstract

We describe a submission to the WMT12
Quality Estimation task, including an exten-
sive Machine Learning experimentation. Data
were augmented with features from linguis-
tic analysis and statistical features from the
SMT search graph. Several Feature Selec-
tion algorithms were employed. The Quality
Estimation problem was addressed both as a
regression task and as a discretised classifi-
cation task, but the latter did not generalise
well on the unseen testset. The most success-
ful regression methods had an RMSE of 0.86
and were trained with a feature set given by
Correlation-based Feature Selection. Indica-
tions that RMSE is not always sufficient for
measuring performance were observed.

1 Introduction

As Machine Translation (MT) gradually gains a po-
sition into production environments, the need for es-
timating the quality of its output is increasing. Vari-
ous use cases refer to it as input assessment for Hu-
man Post-editing, as an extension for Hybrid MT or
System Combination, or even a method for improv-
ing components of existing MT systems.

With the current submission we are trying to
address the problem of assigning a quality score
to a single MT output per source sentence. Pre-
vious work includes regression methods for in-
dicating a binary value of correctness (Quirk,
2001; Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2007),
human-likeness (Gamon et al., 2005) or continu-
ous scores (Specia et al., 2009). As we also work
with continuous scores, we are making an effort
to combine previous feature acquisition sources,

such as language modelling (Raybaud et al., 2009),
language fluency checking (Parton et al., 2011),
parsing (Sánchez-Martinez, 2011; Avramidis et al.,
2011) and decoding statistics (Specia et al., 2009;
Avramidis, 2011). The current submission combines
such previous observations in a combinatory experi-
mentation on feature sets, feature selection methods
and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

The structure of the submission is as follows: The
approach is defined and the methods are described
in section 2, including features acquisition, feature
selection and learning. Section 3 includes informa-
tion about the experiment setup whereas the results
are discussed in Section 4.

2 Methods

2.1 Data and basic approach

This contribution has been built based on the data
released for the Quality Estimation task of the
Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) 2012
(Callison-Burch et al., 2012). The organizers pro-
vided an English-to-Spanish development set and a
test set of 1832 and 422 sentences respectively, de-
rived from WMT09 and WMT10 datasets. For each
source sentence of the development set, participants
were offered one translation generated by a state-of-
the-art phrase-based SMT system. The quality of
each SMT translation was assessed by human evalu-
ators, who provided a quality score in the range 1-5.
Additionally, statistics and processing information
from the execution of the SMT decoding algorithm
were given.

The approach presented here is making use of the
source sentences, the SMT output and the quality
scores in order to follow a typical ML paradigm:

Right after hearing about it, he described it as a “challenge. . . ” disambiguate -ing

Table 1: Sample suggestions generated by rule-based language checking tools, observed in development data

each source and target sentence of the development
set are being analyzed to generate a feature vector.
One training sample is formed out of the feature vec-
tor and the quality score (i.e. as a class value) of each
sentence. A ML algorithm is consequently used to
train a model given the training samples. The per-
formance of each model is evaluated upon a part of
the development set that was kept-out from training.

2.2 Acquiring Features

The features were obtained from two sources: the
decoding process and the analysis of the text of the
source and the target sentence. The two steps are
explained below.

2.2.1 Features from text analysis
The following features were generated with the use
of tools for the statistical and/or linguistic analysis
of the text. The baseline features included:

• Tokens count: Count of tokens in the source
and the translated sentence and their ratio, un-
known words and also occurrences of the target
word within the translated sentence (averaged
for all words in the hypothesis - type/token ra-
tio)

• IBM1-model lookup: Average number of
translations per source word in the sentence,
unweighted or weighted by the inverse fre-
quency of each word in the source corpus

• Language modeling: Language model proba-
bility of the source and translated sentence

• Corpus lookup: percentage of unigrams / bi-
grams / trigrams in quartiles 1 and 4 of fre-
quency (lower and higher frequency words) in
a corpus of the source language

Additionally, the following linguistically motivated
features were also included:

• Parsing: PCFG Parse (Petrov et al., 2006) log-
likelihood, size of n-best tree list, confidence
for the best parse, average confidence of all
parse trees. Ratios of the mentioned target fea-
tures to the corresponding source features.

• Shallow grammatical match: The number
of occurences of particular node tags on both
the source and the target was counted on the
PCFG parses. Additionally, the ratio of the
occurences of each tag in the target sentence
by the corresponding occurences on the source
sentence.

• Language quality check: Source and target
sentences were subject to automatic rule-based
language quality checking, providing a wide
range of quality suggestions concerning style,
grammar and terminology, summed up in an
overall quality score. The process employed
786 rules for English and 70 rules for Spanish.
We counted the occurences of every rule match
in each sentence and the number of characters it
affected. Sample rule suggestions can be seen
in Table 1.

2.2.2 Features from the decoding process
The organisers provided a verbose output of the de-
coding process, including probabilistic scores from
all steps of the execution of the translation search.
We added the scores appearing once per sentence
(i.e. referring to the best hypothesis), whereas for
the ones being modified over the generation graph,
their average (avg), variance (var) and standard de-
viation (std) was calculated. These features are:

• the log of the phrase translation probability
(pC) and the phrase future cost estimate (c)

• the score component vector including the dis-
tortion scores (d1...7), word penalty, translation
scores (e.g. a1: inverse phrase translation prob-
ability, a2: inverse lexical weighting)

2.3 Feature Selection

Experience has shown difficulties in including hun-
dreds of features into training a statistical model.
Several algorithms (such as Naı̈ve Bayes) require
statistically-independent features. For others, a
search space of hundreds of features may impose
increased computational complexity, which is often
unsustainable in the time and resources allocated.
In these cases we therefore applied several common
Feature Selection approaches, in order to reduce the
available features to an affordable number.

We used the Feature Selection algorithms of Re-
lieff (Kononenko, 1994), Information Gain and
Gain Ratio (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), and
Correlation-based Feature Selection (Hall, 2000).
The latter is known for producing feature sets highly
correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each
other; selection was done in two variations, greedy
stepwise and best first.

The data were discretised according to the algo-
rithm requirements and features were scored in a 10-
fold cross-validation.

2.4 Machine Learning

We tried to approach the issue with two distinct
modelling approaches, classification and regression.

2.4.1 Classification algorithms

In an effort to interpret Quality Estimation as a
classification problem, we expect to build models
that are able to assign a discrete value, as a mea-
sure of sentence quality. This bears some relation to
the way the quality scores were generated; humans
were asked to provide an (integer) quality score in
the range 1-5. In our case, we try to build classifiers
that do the same, but are also able to assign values
with smaller intervals. For this purpose, we set up
4 sub-experiments, where the class value in our data
was rounded up to intervals of 0.25, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0
respectively.

In this part of the experiment we used the Naı̈ve
Bayes, k-nearest-neighbours (kNN), Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Tree classification algorithms.
Naı̈ve Bayes’ probabilities for our continuous fea-
tures were estimated with locally weighted linear re-
gression (Cleveland, 1979).

2.4.2 Regression algorithms
Regression algorithms produce a model for di-

rectly predicting a quality score with continu-
ous values. Experimentation here included Par-
tial Least Squares Regression (Stone and Brooks,
1990), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines –
MARS (Friedman, 1991), Lasso (Tibshirani, 1994)
and Linear Regression.

3 Experiment and Results

3.1 Implementation

PCFG parsing features were generated on the out-
put of the Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein,
2007), trained over an English and a Spanish tree-
bank (Mariona Taulé and Recasens, 2008). N-
gram features have been generated with the SRILM
toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). The Acrolinx IQ1 was used
to parse the source side, whereas the Language Tool2

was applied on both sides.
The feature selection and learning algorithms

were implemented with the Orange (Demšar et al.,
2004) and Weka (Hall et al., 2009) toolkits.

3.2 Experiment structure

The methods explained in the previous section pro-
vide a wide range of experiment parameters. Con-
sequently, we tried to extensively test all the possi-
ble parameter combinations. The development data
were separated in two sets, one “training” set and
one “keep-out” set, used to test the predictions. In
order to give learners better coverage over the data,
the development set was split in two ways (70%
training - 30% test and 90% training - 10% test), so
that all experiments get performed under both set-
tings. The scores of these two were averaged3.

3.3 Results

The small size of the dataset allowed for fast train-
ing and testing of the discrete classification problem,
where we could execute 370 experiments. The re-
gression problem was considerably slower, as only
36 experiments concluded in time.

3Given the disparity of the test sizes, it would have in prin-

ciple been better to use a weighted average. Though, this would
not have lead to significant differences in the results.

Feature generation resulted (described in Section
2.2) into 266 features, while 90 of them derived from
language checking. Feature selection suggested sev-
eral feature sets containing between 30 and 80 fea-
tures. We ended up defining 22 feature sets, includ-
ing the full feature set, the baseline feature set and
a couple of manually selected feature sets. Unfor-
tunately, due to size restrictions, not all features can
be listed; though, indicative feature sets are listed in
Table 5.

The most important results of the classification
approach can be seen in Table 2 and the results of
the regression approach in Tables 3 (development
set) and 4 (shared task test set).

4 Discussion

4.1 Machine Learning Conclusions

Discrete classifiers (section 2.4.1) do not yield en-
couraging accuracy, as acceptable levels of accu-
racies appear only with a discretisation interval of
1.00, which though cannot be accepted due to its
high Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). On the de-
velopment keep-out set, the discretised Tree classi-

fier seemingly outperforms all other methods (in-
cluding the regression learners), since it yields a
RMSE of 0.84, given several different feature vec-
tors. Unfortunately, when applied to the final un-
known test data, these classifiers performed obvi-
ously bad, providing the same single value for all
sentences. We could attribute this to overfitting vs.
sparse data and consider how we can handle this bet-
ter in further work.

Another remarkable observation was the incapa-
bility of the RMSE to objectively show the qual-
ity of the model, in situations where the predicted
values are very close or equal to the average of
all real values. A Support Vector Machine with
RMSE = 0.86 ranked 3rd among the classifiers, al-
though it “cheated” by producing only the average
value: 3.25. This leads to the conclusion that the
selection of the best algorithm is not just dictated
by the lowest RMSE, but it should consider several
other indications such as the standard deviation.

We therefore resort to the regression learners
(section 2.4.2), whose scores are not worse, having
a RMSE of 0.855. We have to notice that the four

given the same features.

The best-performing feature set (#19) which was
chosen as the first submission (DFKI cfs-plsreg)
trained with PLS regression, contains features in-
dicated by Correlation-based Feature Selection, run
with bestfirst on a 10-fold cross-validation. We used
the features which were selected on the 100% or
90% of the folds. An equally best-performing fea-
ture set (#18) has resulted from exactly the same fea-
ture selection execution, but contains only features
which were selected in all folds.

The second submission (DFKI grcfs-mars) was
chosen to differentiate both the feature set and the
learning method, with respect to a decent interval.

The baseline feature set (#2) performed worse.
Noticeable was the RMSE of the feature set #4, with
features selected based on their Gain Ratio, but we
did not submit this due to its very narrow interval.

4.2 Feature conclusions

The best performing feature set gives interesting
hints on what worked as a best indication of trans-
lation quality. We would try to summarize them as
follows:

• The language checking of the source sen-
tence detected complex or embedded sentences,
which are often not handled properly by SMT
due to their complicated structure.

• The language checking of the target sentence
detected several agreement issues.

• Parsing provided of source and target count
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and secondary sen-
tences; with the assumption that translations
are relatively isomorphic, the loss of a verb or
a noun or the inability to properly handle a sec-
ondary sentence, would mean a considerably
bad translation outcome. The number of parse
trees generated for each sentence can be an in-
dication of ambiguity.

• Punctuation (dots, commas) often indicates a
complex sentence structure.

• The most useful decoding features were the in-
verse phrase translation probability (a1), the in-
verse lexical weighting (a2), the phrase proba-
bility (pC) and future cost estimate (c) as well
as statistics over their incremental values along
the search graph.
