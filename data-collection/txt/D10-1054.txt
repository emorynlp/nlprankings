Abstract

Hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation
provides a powerful mechanism to capture
both short and long distance phrase reorder-
ings. However, the phrase reorderings lack of
contextual information in conventional HPB
systems. This paper proposes a context-
dependent phrase reordering approach that
uses the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model
to help the HPB decoder select appropriate re-
ordering patterns. We classify translation rules
into several reordering patterns, and build a
MaxEnt model for each pattern based on var-
ious contextual features. We integrate the
MaxEnt models into the HPB model. Ex-
perimental results show that our approach
achieves significant improvements over a stan-
dard HPB system on large-scale translation
tasks. On Chinese-to-English translation,
the absolute improvements in BLEU (case-
insensitive) range from 1.2 to 2.1.

1 Introduction

The hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) model (Chi-
ang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) has been widely adopted
in statistical machine translation (SMT). It utilizes
synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) rules
to perform translation. Typically, there are three
types of rules (see Table 1): phrasal rule, a phrase
pair consisting of consecutive words; hierarchical
rule, a hierarchical phrase pair consisting of both
words and variables; and glue rule, which is used to
merge phrases serially. Phrasal rule captures short
distance reorderings within phrases, while hierar-
chical rule captures long distance reorderings be-

tween phrases. Therefore, the HPB model outper-
forms conventional phrase-based models on phrase
reorderings.

However, HPB translation suffers from a limita-
tion, in that the phrase reorderings lack of contex-
tual information, such as the surrounding words of
a phrase and the content of sub-phrases that rep-
resented by variables. Consider the following two
hierarchical rules in translating a Chinese sentence
into English:

X → 〈X1 � X2, X1 ’s X2〉 (1)

X → 〈X1 � X2, X2X1〉 (2)

Both pattern-match the source sentence, but pro-
duce quite different phrase reorderings. The first
rule generates a monotone translation, while the sec-
ond rule swaps the source phrases covered by X1
and X2 on the target side. During decoding, the first

rule is more likely to be used, as it occurs more fre-
quently in a training corpus. However, the exam-
ple is not a noun possessive case because the sub-
phrase covered by X1 is not a noun but a preposi-
tional phrase. Thus, without considering informa-
tion of sub-phrases, the decoder may make errors on
phrase reordering.

Contextual information has been widely used to
improve translation performance. It is helpful to re-
duce ambiguity, thus guide the decoder to choose
correct translation for a source text. Several re-
searchers observed that word sense disambiguation
improves translation quality on lexical translation
(Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007). These
methods utilized contextual features to determine
the correct meaning of a source word, thus help an
SMT system choose an appropriate target transla-
tion.

Zens and Ney (2006) and Xiong et al. (2006)
utilized contextual information to improve phrase
reordering. They addressed phrase reordering as
a two-class classification problem that translating
neighboring phrases serially or inversely. They built
a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) classifier based on
boundary words to predict the order of neighboring
phrases.

He et al. (2008) presented a lexicalized rule selec-
tion model to improve both lexical translation and
phrase reordering for HPB translation. They built
a MaxEnt model for each ambiguous source side
based on contextual features. The method was also
successfully applied to improve syntax-based SMT
translation (Liu et al., 2008), using more sophisti-
cated syntactical features. Shen et al. (2008) inte-
grated various contextual and linguistic features into
an HPB system, using surrounding words and de-
pendency information for building context and de-
pendency language models, respectively.

In this paper, we focus on improving phrase re-
ordering for HPB translation. We classify SCFG
rules into several reordering patterns consisting of
two variables X and F (or E) 1, such as X1FX2
and X2EX1. We treat phrase reordering as a classi-
fication problem and build a MaxEnt model for each
source reordering pattern based on various contex-

1We use F and E to represent source and target words, re-
spectively.

tual features. We propose a method to integrate the
MaxEnt models into an HPB system. Specifically:

• For hierarchical rules, we classify the source-
side and the target-side into 7 and 17 reordering
patterns, respectively. Target reordering pat-
terns are treated as possible labels. We then
build a classifier for each source pattern to pre-
dict phrase reorderings. This is different from
He et al. (2008), in which they built a clas-
sifier for each ambiguous hierarchical source-
side. Therefore, the training examples for each
MaxEnt model is small and the model maybe
unstable. Here, we classify source hierarchical
phrases into 7 reordering patterns according to
the arrangement of words and variables. We
can obtain sufficient samples for each MaxEnt
model from large-scale bilingual corpus.

• For glue rules, we extend the HPB model by
using bracketing transduction grammar (BTG)
(Wu, 1996) instead of the monotone glue rule.
By doing this, there are two options for the de-
coder to merge phrases: serial or inverse. We
then build a classifier for glue rules to predict
reorderings of neighboring phrases, analogous
to Xiong et al. (2006).

• We integrate the MaxEnt based phrase reorder-
ing models as features into the HPB model
(Chiang, 2005). The feature weights can be
tuned together with other feature functions by
MERT algorithm (Och, 2003).

Experimental results show that the presented method
achieves significant improvement over the baseline.
On Chinese-to-English translation tasks of NIST
evluation, improvements in BLEU (case-insensitive)
are 1.2 on MT06 GALE set, 1.8 on MT06 NIST set,
and 2.1 on MT08.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tion 2 describes the MaxEnt based phrase reorder-
ing method. Section 3 integrates the MaxEnt mod-
els into the translation model. In Section 4, we re-
port experimental results. We analyze the presented
method and experimental results in Section 5 and
conclude in Section 6.

2 MaxEnt based Phrase Reordering

We regard phrase reordering as a pattern classifica-
tion problem. A reordering pattern indicates an ar-
rangement of words and variables. Although there
are a large amount of hierarchical rules may be ex-
tracted from bilingual corpus, these rules can be
classified into several reordering patterns (Section
2.1). In addition, we extend the HPB model with
BTG, that adding an inverted glue rule to merge
phrases inversely (Section 2.2). Therefore, the glue
rules are classified into two patterns: serial or in-
verse. We then build a MaxEnt phrase reordering
(MEPR) classifier for each source reordering pattern
(Section 2.3). In Section 2.4, we describe contextual
features.

2.1 Reordering Pattern Classification for
Hierarchical Rule

Hierarchical rule, consisting of both words and vari-
ables, is of great importance for the HPB model.
During decoding, words are used for lexical trans-
lation, and variables capture phrase reordering. We
may learn millions of hierarchical rules from a bilin-
gual corpus. Although these rules are different from
each other, they can be classified into several re-
ordering patterns according to the arrangement of
variables and words.

In this paper, we follow the constraint as de-
scribed in (Chiang, 2005) that a hierarchical rule
can have at most two variables and they cannot be
adjacent on the source side. We use “X” to rep-
resent the variable, and “F ” and “E” to represent
word strings in source and target language, respec-
tively. Therefore, in a hierarchical rule, E is the lex-
ical translation of F , while the order of X and E
contains phrase reordering information.

For the hierarchical rule that contains one vari-
able (see Figure 1 for example), both the source and
the target phrases can be classified into three pat-

terns (Table 2). To reduce the complexity of clas-
sification, we do not distinguish the order of word
strings. For example, we consider “e1Xe2” and
“e2Xe1” as the same pattern “EXE”, because the
target words are determined by lexical translation of
source words. Our focus is the order between X and
E. During decoding the phrases covered by X are
dynamically changed and the contextual information
of these phrases is ignored for pattern-matching of
hierarchical rules.

Analogously, for the hierarchical rule that con-
tains two variables, the source phrases are classified
into 4 patterns, while the target phrases are classified
into 14 patterns, as shown in Table 3. The pattern
number on the source side is less than that on the
target side, because on the source side, “X1” always
appears before “X2”, and they cannot be adjacent.

557



2.2 Reordering Pattern Classification for Glue
Rule

The HPB model used glue rule to combine phrases
serially. The reason is that in some cases, there are
no valid translation rules that cover a source span.
Therefore, the glue rule provides a default monotone
combination of phrases in order to complete a trans-
lation. This is not sufficient because in certain cases,
the order of phrases may be inverted on the target-
side.

In this paper, we extend the glue rule with BTG
(Wu, 1996), which consists of three types of rules:

X → 〈f̃ , ẽ〉 (3)

X → 〈X1X2, X1X2〉 (4)
X → 〈X1X2, X2X1〉 (5)

Rule 3 is a phrasal rule that translates a source
phrase f̃ into a target phrase ẽ. Rule 4 merges two
consecutive phrases in monotone order, while Rule
5 merges them in inverted order. During decod-
ing, the decoder first uses Rule 3 to produce phrase
translation, and then iteratively uses Rule 4 and 5 to
merge two neighboring phrases into a larger phrase
until the whole sentence is covered.

We replace the original glue rules in the HPB
model with BTG rules (see Table 4). We believe
that the extended HPB model can benefit from BTG
in the following aspects:

• In the HPB model, as we mentioned, hierarchi-
cal rules are constrained in that nonterminals
cannot be adjacent on the source side, i.e., the
source side cannot contain “X1X2”. One rea-
son is that it will heavily increase the rule table
size. The other reason is that it can cause a spu-
rious ambiguity problem (Chiang, 2005). The
inverted glue rule in BTG, however, can solve
this problem.

• In the HPB model, only a monotone glue rule
is provided to merge phrases serially. In the ex-
tended HPB model, the combination of phrases
is classified into two types: monotone and in-
verse.

Analogous to Xiong et al. (2006), to perform
context-dependent phrase reordering, we build a

Glue Rule Extended Glue Rule
S → 〈X, X〉 S → 〈X, X〉

S → 〈SX, SX〉 X → 〈X1X2, X1X2〉
- X → 〈X1X2, X2X1〉

BTG.

MaxEnt based classifier for glue rules to predict the
order of two neighboring phrases. In this paper, we
utilize more contextual features.

2.3 The MaxEnt based Phrase Reordering
Classifier

As described above, we classified phrase reorderings
into several patterns. Therefore, phrase reordering
can be regarded as a classification problem: for each
source reordering pattern, we treat the correspond-
ing target reordering patterns as labels.

We build a general classification model within the
MaxEnt framework:

Pme(Tγ |Tα, α, γ) =
exp(

∑
i λihi(γ, α, f(X), e(X))∑

Tγ
exp(

∑
i λihi(γ, α, f(X), e(X))

(6)

where, α and γ are the source and target side, re-
spectively. Tα/Tγ is the reordering pattern of α/γ.
f(X) and e(X) are the phrases that covered by X
one the source and target side, respectively. Given
a source phrase, the model predicts a target reorder-
ing pattern, considering various contextual features
(Section 2.4).

According to the classification of reordering pat-
terns, there are 3 kinds of classifiers:

• P hr1me includes 3 classifiers for the hierarchical
rules that contain 1 variable. Each of the clas-
sifier has 3 labels;

• P hr2me includes 4 classifiers for the hierarchical
rules that contain 2 variables. Each of the clas-
sifier has 14 labels;

• P grme includes 1 classifier for the glue rules. The
classifier has 2 labels that predict a monotone
or inverse order for two neighboring phrases.
This classifier is analogous to (Xiong et al.,
2006).

558



There are 8 classifiers in total. This is much fewer
than the classifiers in He et al. (2008), in which a
classifier was built for each ambiguous hierarchical
source side. In this way, a classifier may face the
risk that there are not enough samples for training a
stable MaxEnt model. While our approach is more
generic, rather than training a MaxEnt model for a
specific hierarchical source side, we train a model
for a source reordering pattern. Thus, we reduce the
number of classifiers and can extract large training
examples for each classifier.

2.4 Feature definition

For a reordering pattern pair 〈Tα, Tγ〉, we design
three feature functions for phrase reordering classi-
fiers:

• Source lexical feature, including boundary
words and neighboring words. Boundary
words are the left and right word of the source
phrases covered by f(X), while neighboring
words are the words that immediately to the left
and right of a source phrase f(α);

• Part-of-Speech (POS) feature, POS tags of the
boundary and neighboring words on the source
side.

• Target lexical feature, the boundary words of
the target phrases covered by e(X).

These features can be extracted together with
translation rules from bilingual corpus. However,
since the hierarchical rule does not allow for adja-
cent variables on the source side, we extract features
for P grme by using the method described in Xiong et
al. (2006). We train the classifiers with a MaxEnt
trainer (Zhang, 2004).

3 Integrating the MEPR Classifier into the
HPB Model

The HPB model is built within the standard log-
linear framework (Och and Ney, 2002):

Pr(e|f) ∝
∑

i

λihi(α, γ) (7)

where hi(α, γ) is a feature function and λi is the
weight of hi. The HPB model has the following fea-
tures: translation probabilities p(γ|α) and p(α|γ),

lexical weights pw(γ|α) and pw(α|γ), word penalty,
phrase penalty, glue rule penalty, and a target n-
gram language model.

To integrate the MEPR classifiers into the transla-
tion model, the features of the log-linear model are
changed as follows:

• We add the MEPR classifier as a feature func-
tion to predict reordering pattern:

hme(Tγ |Tα) =
∑

Pme(Tγ |Tα, α, γ) (8)

During decoding, we first classify each source
phrase into one of the 8 source reordering pat-
terns and then use the corresponding MEPR
classifier to predict the possible target reorder-
ing pattern. Therefore, the contextual informa-
tion guides the decoder to perform phrase re-
ordering.

• We split the “glue rule penalty” into two fea-
tures: monotone glue rule number and inverted
glue rule number. These features reflect pref-
erence of the decoder for using monotone or
inverted glue rules.

The advantage of our extension method is that the
weights of the new features can be tuned together
with the other features by MERT algorithm (Och,
2003).

We utilize a standard CKY algorithm for decod-
ing. Given a source sentence, the decoder searches
the best derivation from the bottom to top. For a
source span [j1, j2], the decoder uses three kinds of
rules: translation rules produce lexical translation
and phrase reordering (for hierarchical rules), mono-
tone rule merges any neighboring sub-spans [j1, k]
and [k + 1, j2] serially, and inverted rule swap them.
Note that when the decoder uses the monotone and
inverted glue rule to combine sub-spans, it merges
phrases that do not contain variables. Because the
CKY algorithm guarantees that the sub spans [j1, k]
and [k + 1, j2] have been translated before [j1, j2].

4 Experiments

We carried out experiments on four systems:

• HPB: replication of the Hiero system (Chiang,
2005);

• HPB+MEHR: HPB with MaxEnt based classi-
fier for hierarchical rules, as described in Sec-
tion 2.1;

• HPB+MEGR: HPB with MaxEnt based classi-
fier for glue rules, as described in Section 2.2;

• HPB+MER: HPB with MaxEnt based classifier
for both hierarchical and glue rules.

All systems were tuned on NIST MT03 and tested
on MT06 and MT08. The evaluation metric was
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) with case-insensitive
matching of n-grams, where n = 4.

We evaluated our approach on Chinese-to-
English translation. The training data contained
77M Chinese words and 81M English words.
These data come from 17 corpora: LDC2002E18,
LDC2002L27, LDC2002T01, LDC2003E07,
LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2005E83,
LDC2005T06, LDC2005T10, LDC2005T34,
LDC2006E24, LDC2006E26, LDC2006E34,
LDC2006E86, LDC2006E92, LDC2006E93,
LDC2004T08 (HK News, HK Hansards).

To obtain word alignments, we first ran GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2000) in both translation directions
and then refined the results using the “grow-diag-
final” method (Koehn et al., 2003). For the lan-
guage model, we used the SRI Language Modeling
Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train two 4-gram models
on the Xinhua portion of the GigaWord corpus and
the English side of the training corpus.

4.1 Statistical Information of Rules

Hierarchical Rules
We extracted 162M translation rules from the train-
ing corpus. Among them, there were 127M hi-
erarchical rules, which contained 85M hierarchical
source phrases. We classified these source phrases
into 7 patterns as described in Section 2.1. Table
5 shows the statistical information. We observed
that the most frequent source pattern is “FXF ”,

which accounted for 46.1% of the total. Interest-
ingly, “X1FX2”, accounting for 3.7%, was the least
frequent pattern. Table 6 and Table 7 show the
distributions of reordering patterns for hierarchical
source phrases that contain one and two variables,
respectively. From both the tables, we observed
that for Chinese-to-English translation, the most fre-
quent “reordering” pattern for a source phrase is
monotone translation (bold font in the tables).

Glue Rules
To train a MaxEnt classifier for glue rules, we ex-
tracted 65.8M reordering (monotone and inverse)
instances from the training data, using the algo-
rithm described in Xiong et al. (2006). There were
63M monotone instances, accounting for 95.7%. Al-
though instances of inverse reordering accounted for
4.3%, they are important for phrase reordering.

improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.01). Note that MT06G has one reference for each source sentence,
while the MT06N and MT08 have four references.

• The HPB+MEHR system achieved significant
improvements on all test sets compared to the
HPB system. The absolute increases in BLEU
scores ranging from 0.6 (on 06G) to 1.0 (on
06N) percentage points. This indicates that the
ME based reordering for hierarchical rules im-
proves translation performance.

• The HPB+MEGR system achieved significant
improvements over the HPB system. The ab-
solute increases in BLEU scores ranging from
0.9 (on 06G) to 1.8 (on 06N) percentage points.
The HPB+MEGR system overcomes the short-
coming of the HPB system by using both
monotone glue rule and inverted glue rule,
which merging phrases serially and inversely,
respectively. Furthermore, the HPB+MEGR
system outperformed the HPB+MEHR system.

• The HPB+MER system achieved the best per-
formances on all test sets, with absolute in-
creases of BLEU scores ranging from 1.2 (on
06G) to 2.1 (on 08). The system combin-
ing with ME based reordering for both hier-
archical and glue rules, outperformed both the
HPB+MEHR and HPB+MEGR systems.

• In addition, we found that the decoder takes
more time after adding the MEPR models (the
speed column of Table 8). The average transla-
tion speed of HPB+MER (1.7 words/second) is
about 5 times slower than the HPB system (8.7
words/second). One reason is that the MEPR
models utilized contextual information to com-
pute classification scores. Another reason is
that adding inverted glue rules increases search
space.

5 Analysis

Experiments showed that the presented approach
achieved significant gains on BLEU scores. Further-
more, we sought to explore what would happen af-
ter integrating the MEPR classifiers into the transla-
tion model. We compared the outputs of HPB and
HPB+MER and observed that the translation perfor-
mance are improved on phrase reordering. For ex-
ample, the translations of a source sentence in MT08
are as follows 2:

• Src: ¸I1 �?2 þ�3 .4 m©5 éÄ6
é7 m8 Jø9 40�10 ë11 12 �13 �
Ï14 Oy15

• Ref: At the end4 of last3 month3, the
South1 Korean1 government2 began5 a plan15
to provide9 400,00010 tonnes11 of rice12 as
aid14 to North8 Korea8

• HPB: South Korean government late last
month to start with 400,000 tons of rice aid to
the DPRK

• HPB+MER: Start at the end of last month,
South Korean government plans to provide
400,000 tons of rice in aid to the DPRK

The most obvious error that the baseline system
makes is the order of the time expression “þ�
., the end of last month”, which should be either
at the beginning or the end on target side. However,
the baseline produced a monotone translation by us-
ing the rule “¸I �? X1, South Korean govern-
ment X1”. The HPB+MER system, however, moved
the time expression to the beginning of the sentence
by using the rule “¸I �? X1, X1 South Ko-
rean government’. The reason is that the MaxEnt
phrase reordering classifier uses the contextual fea-
tures (e.g. the boundary words) of the phrase cov-
ered by X1 to predict the phrase reordering as X1E
for the source phrase FX1.

2The co-indexes of the words in the source and reference
sentence indicate word alignments.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have proposed a MaxEnt based
phrase reordering approach to help the HPB decoder
select reordering patterns. We classified hierarchical
rules into 7 reordering patterns on the source side
and 17 reordering patterns on the target side. In ad-
dition, we introduced BTG to enhance the reorder-
ing of neighboring phrases and classified the glue
rules into two patterns. We trained a MaxEnt clas-
sifier for each reordering pattern and integrated it
into a standard HPB system. Experimental results
showed that the proposed approach achieved signif-
icant improvements over the baseline. The absolute
improvements in BLEU range from 1.2 to 2.1.

MaxEnt based phrase reordering provides a mech-
anism to incorporate various features into the trans-
lation model. In this paper, we only use a few fea-
ture sets based on standard contextual word and POS
tags. We believe that additional features will fur-
ther improve translation performance. Such features
could include syntactical features (Chiang et al.,
2009). In the future, we will carry out experiments
on deeper features and evaluate the effects of differ-
ent feature sets.
