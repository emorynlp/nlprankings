Abstract 

The statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem heavily depends on the sentence aligned 
parallel corpus and the target language model. 
This paper points out some of the core issues 
on switching a language script and its reper-
cussion in the phrase based statistical machine 
translation system development. The present 
task reports on the outcome of English-
Manipuri language pair phrase based SMT 
task on two aspects – a) Manipuri using Ben-
gali script, b) Manipuri using transliterated 
Meetei Mayek script. Two independent views 
on Bengali script based SMT and transliter-
ated Meitei Mayek based SMT systems of the 
training data and language models are pre-
sented and compared. The impact of various 
language models is commendable in such sce-
nario. The BLEU and NIST score shows that 
Bengali script based phrase based SMT 
(PBSMT) outperforms over the Meetei Mayek 
based English to Manipuri SMT system. 
However, subjective evaluation shows slight 
variation against the automatic scores. 

 

1 Introduction 

The present finding is due to some issue of socio-
linguistics phenomenon called digraphia - a case of 
Manipuri language (a resource constrained Indian 
languages spoken mainly in the state of Manipur) 
using two different scripts namely Bengali script1

and Meetei Mayek2. Meetei Mayek (MM) is the 
original script which was used until the 18th cen-
tury to represent Manipuri text. Its earliest use is 
dated between the 11th and 12th centuries CE3. 
Manipuri language is recognized by the Indian Un-
ion and has been included in the list of 8th sched-
uled languages by the 71st amendment of the 
constitution in 1992. In the recent times, the Ben-
gali script is getting replaced by Meetei Mayek at 
schools, government departments and other admin-
istrative activities. It may be noted that Manipuri is 
the only Tibeto-Burman language which has its 
own script. Digraphia has implications in language 
technology as well despite the issues of language 
planning, language policy and language ideology. 
There are several examples of languages written in 
one script that was replaced later by another script. 
Some of the examples are Romanian which origi-
nally used Cyrillic then changed to Latin; Turkish 
and Swahili began with the Arabic then Latin, and 
many languages of former Soviet Central Asia, 
which abandoned the Cyrillic script after the disso-
lution of the USSR. The present study is a typical 
case where the natural language processing of an 
Indian language is affected in case of switching 
script. 

Manipuri is a monosyllabic, morphologically 
rich and highly agglutinative in nature. Tone is 
very prominent. So, a special treatment of these 
tonal words is absolutely necessary. Manipuri lan-
guage has 6 vowels and their tone counterparts and 
6 diphthongs and their tone counterparts. Thus, a

Manipuri learner should know its tone system and 
the corresponding word meaning.  

Natural language processing tasks for Manipuri 
language is at the initial phase. We use a small par-
allel corpus and a sizable monolingual corpus col-
lected from Manipuri news to develop English-
Manipuri statistical machine translation system. 
The Manipuri news texts are in Bengali script. So, 
we carry out transliteration from Bengali script to 
Meetei Mayek as discussed in section 3. Typically, 
transliteration is carried out between two different 
languages –one as a source and the other as a tar-
get. But, in our case, in order to kick start the MT 
system development, Bengali script (in which most 
of the digital Manipuri text are available) to Meetei 
Mayek transliteration is carried out using different 
models. The performance of the rule based translit-
eration is improved by integrating the conjunct and 
syllable handling module in the present rule based 
task along with transliteration unit (TU). However, 
due to the tonal characteristic of this language, 
there is loss of accents for the tonal words when 
getting translated from Bengali script. In other 
words, there is essence of intonation in Manipuri 
text; the differentiation between Bengali characters 
such as �◌ (i) and ◌� (ee) or ◌�  (u) and ◌�  (oo) cannot 
be made using Meetei Mayek. This increases the 
lexical ambiguity on the transliterated Manipuri 
words in Meetei Mayek script. 
 

2 Related Work  

Several SMT systems between English and mor-
phologically rich languages are reported. (Tou-
tonova et al., 2007) reported the improvement of 
an SMT by applying word form prediction models 
from a stem using extensive morphological and 
syntactic information from source and target lan-
guages. Contributions using factored phrase based 
model and a probabilistic tree transfer model at 
deep syntactic layer are made by (Bojar and Hajič, 
2008) of English-to-Czech SMT system. (Yeniterzi 
and Oflazer, 2010) reported syntax-to-morphology 
mapping in factored phrase-based Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) from 
English to Turkish relying on syntactic analysis on 
the source side (English) and then encodes a wide 
variety of local and non-local syntactic structures 
as complex structural tags which appear as addi-
tional factors in the training data. On the target side 

(Turkish), they only perform morphological analy-
sis and disambiguation but treat the complete com-
plex morphological tag as a factor, instead of 
separating morphemes. (Bojar et al., 2012) pointed 
out several pitfalls when designing factored model 
translation setup. All the above systems have been 
developed using one script for each language at the 
source as well as target. 

Manipuri is a relatively free word order where 
the grammatical role of content words is largely 
determined by their case markers and not just by 
their positions in the sentence. Machine Transla-
tion systems of Manipuri and English is reported 
by (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2010b) on devel-
opment of English-Manipuri SMT system using 
morpho-syntactic and semantic information where 
the target case markers are generated based on the 
suffixes and semantic relations of the source sen-
tence. The above mentioned system is developed 
using Bengali script based Manipuri text. SMT 
systems between English and morphologically rich 
highly agglutinative language suffer badly if the 
adequate training and language resource is not 
available. Not only this, it is important to note that 
the linguistic representation of the text has implica-
tions on several NLP aspects not only in machine 
translations systems. This is our first attempt to 
build and compare English-Manipuri language pair 
SMT systems using two different scripts of Ma-
nipuri. 

3 Transliterated Parallel Corpora 

The English-Manipuri parallel corpora and Ma-
nipuri monolingual corpus collected from the news 
website www.thesangaiexpress.com are based on 
Bengali script. The Bengali script has 52 conso-
nants and 12 vowels. The modern-day Meetei 
Mayek script is made up of a core repertoire of 27 
letters, alongside letters and symbols for final con-
sonants, dependent vowel signs, punctuation, and 
digits. Meetei Mayek is a Brahmic script with con-
sonants bearing the inherent vowel and vowel ma-
tras modifying it. However, unlike most other 
Brahmi-derived scripts, Meetei Mayek employs 
explicit final consonants which contain no final 
vowels. The use of the killer (which refers to its 
function of killing the inherent vowel of a conso-
nant letter) is optional in spelling; for example, 
while ꯗꯔ may be read dara or dra, ꯗ꯭ꯔ must be read 
dra. Syllable initial combinations for vowels can 

12



occur in modern usage to represent diphthongs.  
The Meetei Mayek has 27 letters (Iyek Ipee), 8 
dependent vowel signs (Cheitap Iyek), 8 final con-
sonants (Lonsum Iyek), 10 digits (Cheising Iyek) 
and 3 punctuation (Cheikhei, Lum Iyek and Apun 
Iyek).

Bengali script as given by table 1,  over and above 
some of Bengali scripts which does not have a cor-
responding direct mapping to Meetei Mayek such 
as ( �,  �, ◌ , !, ◌"  etc.) which has resulted in the loss 
of target representation. The syllable based Bengali 
script to Meetei Mayek transliteration system out-
performs the other known transliteration systems in 
news domain between the two scripts in terms of 
precision and recall (Singh, 2012). The overall 
conjunct representation is many-to-many charac-
ters in nature for the bilingual transliteration task 
of Bengali script and Meetei Mayek. Some of the 
example words using the conjuncts are given as: 

 

#$�� �� wDjlKe   (press-na) 

���%&�& ��  rgKfDjgdsg (district-ki) 

#�'(��'�)* �� KlsDjlfjg\lGf (secretariate-ta) 

#+',*- � � wlfDjOM (petrol) 

And the Bengali script conjuncts and its constitu-
ents along with the Meetei Mayek notation for the 
above examples are as given below:  

#$ (pre) � + + ◌. � + #◌        � wDjl

A sample transliterated parallel corpus between 
English and Manipuri is given in the table 2. These 
transliterations are based on the syllable based 
model.

4 Building SMT for English-Manipuri  

The important resources of building SMT are the 
training and language modeling data. We use a 
small amount of parallel corpora for training and a 
sizable amount of monolingual Manipuri and Eng-
lish news corpora. So, we have two aspects of de-
veloping English-Manipuri language pair SMT 
systems by using the two different scripts for Ma-
nipuri. The moot question is which script will per-
form better. At the moment, we are developing 
only the baseline systems. So, the downstream 
tools are not taken into account which would have 
affected by way of the performance of the script 
specific tools other than the transliteration system 
performance used in the task. In the SMT devel-
opment process, apart from transliteration accuracy 
error, the change in script to represent Manipuri 
text has made the task of NLP related activities a 
difference in the way how it was carried out with 
Bengali script towards improving the factored 
based modes in future as well. Lexical ambiguity is 
very common in this language mostly due to tonal 
characteristics. This has resulted towards the re-
quirement of a word sense disambiguation module 
more than before. This is because of a set of differ-
ence in the representation using Meitei Mayek. As 
part of this ongoing experiment, we augment the 
training data with 4600 manually prepared variants 
of verbs and nouns phrases for improving the over-
all accuracy and help solving a bit of data sparsity 
problem of the SMT system along with an addi-
tional lexicon of 10000 entries between English 
and Manipuri to handle bits of data sparsity and 
sense disambiguation during the training process. 
The English-Manipuri parallel corpus developed 
by (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2010a) is used in 
the experiment. Moses4 toolkit (Koehn, 2007) is 
used for training with GIZA++5 and decoding. 
Minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) for tuning 
are carried out using the development data for two 
scripts. Table 3 gives the corpus statistics of the 
English-Manipuri SMT system development. 

4.1 Lexical Ambiguity 

Manipuri is, by large, a tonal language. The lexical 
ambiguity is very prominent even with Bengali 
script based text representation. The degree of am-
                                                           
4 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 
5 http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html 

biguity worsens due to the convergence as shown 
by the figure 1 and many to one mapping shown in 
the table 1. So, the Bengali script to Meetei Mayek 
transliteration has resulted to the lost of several 
words meaning at the transliterated output. Many 
aspects of translation can be best explained at a 
morphological, syntactic or semantic level. This 
implies that the phrase table and target language 
model are very much affected by using Meetei 
Mayek based text and hence the output of the SMT 
system. Thus, lexical ambiguity is one major rea-
son on why the transliterated Meetei Mayek script 
based PBSMT suffers comparatively. Three exam-
ples of lexical ambiguity are given below: 

 
(a)  
�1 (mi)  � spider � ꯃꯤ (mi) meaning either spider or 
man 
 
1� (mee)  � man � ꯃꯤ (mi) meaning either spider or 
man 
 
(b)   
	�9* (sooba) � to work � ꯁꯨꯕꯥ (suba) meaning either to 
work or to hit 
 
 	�9* (suba) � to hit � ꯁꯨꯕꯥ (suba) meaning either to 
work or to hit

The lexical ambiguity that arises are twofold,  i) 
one after transliteration into Meetei Mayek as 
given by examples (a) and (b), ii) one before the 
transliteration as given by the example (c) for 
which the ambiguity is doubled after the translit-
eration. Thus, the scripts are functioning as a rep-
resentation language for lexical ambiguity like the 
semantic phrase sense disambiguation model for 
SMT (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). 

4.2 Language Modeling 

The impact of the different language models is 
clearly seen in our experiment mostly by way of 
lexical variation and convergence characteristics as 
shown in Figure 1. Four different language models 
are developed: a) language model (LM1) on Ben-
gali script based Manipuri text, b) language model 
(LM2) on transliterated Manipuri Meetei Mayek 
text, there is change in the language model pa-
rameter such as perplexity which affects the over-
all translation decoding process, c) language model 
(LM3) based on language model (LM1) with trans-
literation to Meitei Mayek on Manipuri text from 
Bengali Script texts, and d) language model (LM4) 
based on language model (LM2) with translitera-
tion to Bengali script on Manipuri text from Meetei 
Mayek text. SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) is used to 
build trigram model with modified Kneser-Ney 
smoothing (Stanley and Joshua, 1998) and interpo-
lated with lower order estimates which works best 
for Manipuri language using 2.3 million words of 
180,000 Manipuri news sentences. There are varia-
tions in the language model parameters while 
switching the scripts.  

The log probability and perplexity of the sen-
tence (considering the first sentence from Table 2) 
using Bengali script, “�'-/� ��+*0 '12�& 1*�3&�4� 
5�67�����* ��&*� 8-9* �9& +*�:;9* :<=�'> M” are given 
as: 

 
logprob= -22.873 ppl= 193.774 ppl1= 347.888  
 
while the parameters for the same sentence using 
Meetei Mayek, i.e.,  
 
“ꯢꯂꯦꯛꯁꯟ    ꯗꯤꯄꯥꯔ꯭ꯇꯃꯦꯅ꯭ꯇꯀꯤ ꯃꯥꯌꯀꯧꯗꯒꯤ ꯑꯦꯢꯑꯦꯐꯁꯤꯗꯤꯗꯥ

given as:  
 
logprob= -26.7555 ppl= 473.752 ppl1= 939.364 

It is also observed that some of the n-grams entries 
on one language model are not available in the 
other language model. For example, 
 

-2.708879       1���* #HN9��       -0.3211589 
 

is a bigram found in Bengali script based language

is a bigram found in the Meetei Mayek based lan-
guage model but not available in Bengali script

gram in the language models, the log(P(W)) and  
log(backoff-weight) are found to be different. Two 
bigram examples are given below:

ous models developed are evaluated using BLEU 
(Papineni et al, 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 
2002) automatic scoring techniques. A high NIST 
score means a better translation by measuring the 
precision of n-gram.

Table 13: Manipuri to English translation output using 
Meetei Mayek: 
 
The English to Manipuri SMT system output using 
Bengali Script suffers fluency and adequacy scores 
as given by table 8 compared to English to Ma-
nipuri SMT system output using Meetei Mayek 
script. In the case of Manipuri to English SMT sys-

tem, the Meetei Mayek based SMT system outper-
forms the Bengali script based SMT in terms of 
both fluency and adequacy as given by table 9 as 
well as automatic scores as given by table 5. 

6 Conclusion and Discussion 

The detailed study of grapheme-to-phoneme indi-
cates missing tone for several words using present 
Meetei Mayek script. The training process based 
on the Bengali script training data is found to have 
higher vocabulary coverage all across since the 
representation is done with a finer glyph as com-
pared to Meetei Mayek so is the higher automatic 
scores in case of English-to-Manipuri PBSMT sys-
tem. But, considering the subjective evaluation 
scores, the Meetei Mayek based SMT systems out-
performs the Bengali script based English-to-
Manipuri SMT systems as against the automatic 
scores. In the case of Manipuri-to-English PBSMT 
systems, both the automatic score and subjective 
evaluation scores using Meetei Mayek outperforms 
the Bengali script based systems. Statistical sig-
nificant test is performed to judge if a change in 
score that comes from a change in the system with 
script switching reflects a change in overall trans-
lation quality. The systems show statistically sig-
nificant result as measured by bootstrap re-
sampling method (Koehn, 2004) on BLEU score. 
In future, the experiments can be repeated with 
special treatment of individual morphemes in bits 
and pieces on a decent size of parallel corpora. 
More notably, SMT decoders may have the feature 
of handling two or more scripts of the same lan-
guage in the future SMT systems for languages 
like Manipuri.
