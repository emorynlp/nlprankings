Abstract

To computationally model discourse phenomena such as argumentation we need corpora with
reliable annotation of the phenomena under study. Annotating complex discourse phenomena
poses two challenges: fuzziness of unit boundaries and the need for multiple annotators. We show
that current metrics for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) such as P/R/F1 and Krippendorff’s α
provide inconsistent results for the same text. In addition, IAA metrics do not tell us what parts of
a text are easier or harder for human judges to annotate and so do not provide sufficiently specific
information for evaluating systems that automatically identify discourse units. We propose a
hierarchical clustering approach that aggregates overlapping text segments of text identified by
multiple annotators; the more annotators who identify a text segment, the easier we assume that
the text segment is to annotate. The clusters make it possible to quantify the extent of agreement
judges show about text segments; this information can be used to assess the output of systems
that automatically identify discourse units.

1 Introduction

Annotation of discourse typically involves three subtasks: segmentation (identification of discourse units,
including their boundaries), segment classification (labeling the role of discourse units) and relation iden-
tification (indicating the link between the discourse units) (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a). The difficulty
of achieving an Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) of .80, which is generally accepted as good agree-
ment, is compounded in studies of discourse annotations since annotators must unitize, i.e. identify the
boundaries of discourse units (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). The inconsistent assignment of boundaries in
annotation of discourse has been noted at least since Grosz and Sidner (1986) who observed that although
annotators tended to identify essentially the same units, the boundaries differed slightly. The need for
annotators to identify the boundaries of text segments makes measurement of IAA more difficult because
standard coefficients such as κ assume that the units to be coded have been identified before the coding
begins (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). A second challenge for measuring IAA for discourse annotation is
associated with larger numbers of annotators. Because of the many ways that ideas are expressed in hu-
man language, using multiple annotators to study discourse phenomena is important. Such an approach
capitalizes on the aggregated intuitions of multiple coders to overcome the potential biases of any one
coder and helps identify limitations in the coding scheme, thus adding to the reliability and validity of
the annotation study. The more annotators, however, the harder it is to achieve an IAA of .80 (Bayerl and
Paul, 2011). What to annotate also depends, among other characteristics, on the phenomenon of interest,
the text being annotated, the quality of the annotation scheme and the effectiveness of training. But even
if these are excellent, there is natural variability in human judgment for a task that involves subtle dis-
tinctions about which competent coders disagree. An accurate computational model should reflect this
variability (Aakhus et al., 2013).

Table 1: Examples of Callouts and Targets

Figure 1: Cluster where 3 judges identify a core

We propose an approach for overcoming these challenges based on evidence from an annotation study
of arguments in online interactions. Our scheme for argumentation is based on Pragmatic Argumentation
Theory (PAT) (Van Eemeren et al., 1993; Hutchby, 2013; Maynard, 1985). PAT states that argument can
arise at any point when two or more actors engage in calling out and making problematic some aspect
of another actor’s prior contribution for what it (could have) said or meant (Van Eemeren et al., 1993).
The argumentative relationships among contributions to a discussion are indicated through links between
what is targeted and how it is called out. Table 1 shows two Callouts that refer back to the same Target.

Callouts and Targets are Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs) in the sense of Peldszus and Stede
(2013a), “minimal units of analysis . . . inspired . . . by a . . . relation-based discourse theory” (p.20). In our
case the theory is PAT. Callouts are related to Targets by a relationship that we may refer to as Response,
though we do not discuss the Response relationship in this paper.

The hierarchical clustering technique that we propose systematically identifies clusters of ADUs; each
cluster contains a core of overlapping text that two or more judges have identified. Figure 1 shows
a schematic example of a cluster with a core identified by three judges. The variation in boundaries
represents the individual judges’ differing intuitions; these differences reflect natural variation of human
judgments about discourse units. We interpret differences in the number (or percentage) of judges that
identify a core as evidence of how hard or easy a discourse unit is to recognize.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we show that methods for assessing IAA, such as
the information retrieval inspired (P/R/F1) approach (Wiebe et al., 2005) and Krippendorff’s α (Krip-
pendorff, 1995; Krippendorff, 2004b), which was developed for content analysis in the social sciences,
provide inconsistent results when applied to segmentations involving fuzzy boundaries and multiple
coders.

In addition, these metrics do not tell us which parts of a text are easier or harder to annotate, or help
choose a reliable gold standard. Our second contribution is a new method for assessing IAA using hier-
archical clustering to find parts of text that are easier or harder to annotate. These clusters could serve as
the basis for assessing the performance of systems that automatically identify ADUs - the system would
be rewarded for identifying ADUs that are easier for people to recognize and penalized for identifying
ADUs that are relatively hard for people to recognize.

2 Annotation Study of Argumentative Discourse Units: Callouts and Targets

In this section, we describe the annotation study we conducted to determine whether trained human
judges can reliably identify Callouts and Targets. The main annotation task was to find Callouts and the
Targets to which they are linked and unitize them, i.e., assign boundaries to each ADU. As mentioned
above, these are the steps for argument mining delineated in Peldszus and Stede (2013a). The design of

121



the study was consistent with the conditions for generating reliable annotations set forth in Krippendorff
(2004a, p. 217).

We selected five blog postings from a corpus crawled from Technorati (technorati.com) between 2008-
2010; the comments contain many disputes. We used the first 100 comments on each blog as our corpus,
along with the original posting. We refer to each blog and the associated comments as a thread.

The complexity of the phenomenon required the perspective of multiple independent annotators, de-
spite the known difficulty in achieving reliable IAA with more than two annotators. For our initial
study, in which our goal was to obtain naturally occurring examples of Callouts and Targets and assess
the challenges of reliably identifying them, we engaged five graduate students with a strong humanities
background. The coding was performed with the open-source Knowtator software (Ogren, 2006). All
five judges annotated all 100 comments in all five threads. While the annotation process was under way,
annotators were instructed not to communicate with each other about the study.

The annotators’ task was to find each instance of a Callout, determine the boundaries, link the Callout
to the most recent Target and determine the boundaries of the Target. We prepared and tested a set of
guidelines with definitions and examples of key concepts. The following is an adapted excerpt from the
guidelines:

• Callout: A Callout is (a part of) a subsequent action that selects (a part of) a prior action and marks
and comments on it in some way. In Table 1, Statements 2 and 3 are both Callouts, i.e., they perform
the action of calling out on Statement 1. Statement 2 calls out the first part of Statement 1 dealing
with switching phones. Statement 3 calls out all of Statement 1 – both what’s proposed and the
rationale for the disagreement.

• Target: A Target is a part of a prior action that has been called out by a subsequent action. Statement
1 is a Target of Statements 2 and 3. But Statements 2 and 3 link to different parts of Statement 1, as
described above.

• Response: A link between Callout and Target that occurs when a subsequent action refers back to
(is a response to) a prior action.

Annotators were instructed to mark any text segment (from words to entire comments) that satisfied
the definitions above. A single text segment could be a Target and a Callout. To save effort on a difficult
task, judges were asked only to annotate the most recent plausible Target. We plan to study chains of
responses in future work.

Prior to the formal study, each annotator spent approximately eight hours in training, spread over about
two weeks, under the supervision of a PhD student who had helped to develop the guidelines. Training
materials included the guidelines and postings and comments from Technorati that were not used in the
formal study. Judges were reminded that our research goal was to find naturally occurring examples of
Callouts and Targets and that the research team did not know in advance what were the right answers
– the subjects’ job was to identify Callouts and Targets that satisfied the definitions in the guidelines.
In response to the judges’ questions, the guidelines were iteratively updated: definitions were reviewed,
additional examples were added, and a list of FAQs was developed1.

Table 2 shows the wide range of results among the annotators for Callouts that illustrates a problem to
be addressed when assessing reliability for multiple annotators.

Averaged over all five threads, A1 identified the fewest Callouts (66.8) while A4 and A5 identified
the most (107 and 109, respectively). Furthermore, the number of annotations assigned by A4 and A5
to each corpus is consistently higher than those of the other annotators, while the number of annotations
A1 assigned to each thread is consistently lower than that of all of the other annotators. Although these
differences could be due to issues with training, we interpret the consistent variation among coders as
potential evidence of two distinct types of behavior: some judges are ‘lumpers’ who consider a text
string as a single unit; others are ‘splitters’ who treat the same text string as two (or more) distinct units.
The high degree of variability among coders is consistent with the observations of Peldszus and Stede

but even so, the variability highlights an important challenge for calculating IAA with multiple coders
and fuzzy unit boundaries.

3 Some Problems of Unitization Reliability with Existing IAA Metrics

In this section we discuss two state-of-the-art metrics frequently used for measuring IAA for discourse
annotation and we show that these methods offer limited informativeness when text boundaries are fuzzy
and there are multiple judges. These methods are the information retrieval inspired precision-recall
(P/R/F1) metrics used in Wiebe and her collaborators’ important work on sentiment analysis (Wiebe
et al., 2005; Somasundaran et al., 2008) and Krippendorff’s α, a variant of the α family of IAA coef-
ficients specifically designed to handle fuzzy boundaries and multiple annotators (Krippendorff, 1995;
Krippendorff, 2004b). Krippendorff’s α determines IAA based on observed disagreement relative to
expected agreement and calculates differences in annotators’ judgments. Although it is possible to use
number of words or even clauses to measure IAA, we use length in characters both for consistency with
Wiebe’s approach and because Krippendorff (2004b, pp.790-791) recommends using “. . . the smallest
distinguishable length, for example the characters in text. . .” to measure IAA. We next show the results
of using P/R/F and Krippendorff’s α to measure IAA for our annotation study and provide examples of
some challenges that need to be addressed.

3.1 Precision, Recall and F measures
Implementing P/R/F1 requires a gold standard annotation against which the other annotations can be
compared. P/R/F1 is calculated here, following (Wiebe et al., 2005), as follows: the units selected by
one annotator are taken as the gold standard and the remaining annotators are calculated against the
selected gold standard. To determine whether annotators selected the same text span, two different types
of matches were considered, as in Somasundaran et al. (2008): exact matches and overlap matches
(variation of their lenient match):

• Exact Matches (EM): Text spans that vary at the start or end point by five characters or less are
considered an exact match. This minor relaxation of exact matching (Somasundaran et al., 2008)
compensates for minor inconsistencies such as whether a judge included a sentence ending punctu-
ation mark in the unit.

• Overlap Matches (OM): Any overlap between text spans of more than 10% of the total number of
characters is considered a match. OM is weaker than EM but still an indicator of shared judgments
by annotators.

Tables 3 and 5 and Tables 4 and 6 show the P/R/F1-based IAA using EM and OM respectively. The
results are averaged across all five threads. Besides average P/R/F1 we also show Max F1 and Min F1,
which represent the maximum and minimum F1 relative to a particular annotator used as gold standard.

These tables show that the results vary greatly. Among the reasons for the variation are the following:

• Results are sensitive to which annotator is selected as the gold standard. In Table 4, pairing A4 with
the judge who agrees maximally produces an F measure of 90.2 while pairing A4 with the annotator
who agrees minimally produces an F measure of 73.3. In Tables 3 and 4, if we select A4 as the gold
standard we get the most variation; selecting A3 produces the least.

Table 6: Targets: OM P/R/F1 over 5 threads

• The type of matching matters. As expected, OM, which is less strict than EM, produces substantially
higher F1 scores both for Callouts (Tables 3 and 4 ) and Targets (Tables 5 and 6).

• Different phenomena are associated with different levels of difficulty of annotation. The F1 scores
for Targets are considerably lower than the F1 scores for Callouts. We suspect that Callouts are
easier to recognize since they are often introduced with standard expressions that signal agreement
or disagreement such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘I agree’, or ‘I disagree’. Targets, on the other hand, generally
lack such distinguishing lexical features.

We also observe differences across threads. For example, the Ban thread seems harder to annotate
than the other threads. Figure 2 and 3 show IAA results for OM for Callout and Target annotations for
annotators A1 and A5 respectively, across the five threads. We chose A1 and A5 because in general
A1 annotated the fewest Callouts and A5 annotated the most Callouts in the corpus. These figures show
different annotator behavior. For instance, for both Callout and Target annotations, A1 has higher average
R than P, while A5 has higher P but lower R. Figures 2 and 3 hint that the Ban thread is harder to annotate
than the others.

The examples in this section show two downsides to the P/R/F1 metric. First, the scores do not reflect
the extent to which two annotations match. This is crucial information for fuzzy boundary matching, be-
cause the agreement between two annotations can be over only a few characters or over the full length of
the selected text. Second, the variation across multiple judges demonstrates the disadvantage of arbitrary
selection of a gold standard set of annotations against which to measure IAA.

3.2 Krippendorff’s α
Krippendorff’s α calculates IAA based on the observed and expected disagreement between annotators.
We use the version of Kripendorff’s α discussed in Krippendorff (2004b) which takes into account mul-
tiple annotators and fuzzy boundaries. Detailed proof and an explanation of the calculation can be found
in (Krippendorff, 2004b; Krippendorff, 1995).

Table 8: Threads ranked by IAA in descending order

Comparison of α and P/R/F1 metrics shows that they generate inconsistent results that are difficult to
interpret. For example, in Table 7, the F1 measure for Callouts indicates lower agreement on the Ban
thread in comparison to Android while α suggests higher agreement on the Ban subcorpus relative to the

Figure 3: IAA metrics per thread when A5 is gold standard ( Left: Callout. Right: Target.)

Android subcorpus. The inconsistencies are also apparent in Table 8, which ranks threads in descending
order of IAA. For example, the Android corpus receives the highest IAA using F1 but the lowest using
α.

We do not show the results for Krippendorff’s α for Targets for the following reason. Relevant units
from a continuous text string are assigned to categories by individual annotators. But identification of
Targets is dependent on (temporally secondary to) identification of Callouts. In multiple instances we
observe that an annotator links multiple Callouts to two or more overlapping Targets. Depending on
the Callout, the same unit (i.e., text segment) can represent an annotation (a Target) or a gap between
two Targets. Computation of α is based on the overlapping characters of the annotations and the gaps
between the annotations. Naturally, if a single text string is assigned different labels (i.e. annotation
or a gap between annotations) in different annotations, α does not produce meaningful results. The
inapplicability of Krippendorff’s α to Targets is a significant limitation for its use in discourse annotation
(To save space we only show results for Callouts in subsequent tables.)

The examples in Section 3 show a fundamental limitation of both P/R/F1 and Krippendorff’s α: They
do not pinpoint the location in a document where the extent of variation can be observed. This limits the
usefulness of these measures for studying the discourse phenomenon of interest and for analyzing the
impact of factors such as text difficulty, corpus and judges on IAA. The impact of these factors on IAA
also makes it hard to pick gold standard examples on a principled basis.

4 Hierarchical Clustering of Discourse Units

In this section we introduce a clustering approach that aggregates overlapping annotations, thereby mak-
ing it possible to quantify agreement among annotators within a cluster. Then we show examples of
clusters from our annotation study in which the extent of annotator support for a core reflects how hard
or easy an ADU is for human judges to identify. The hierarchical clustering technique (Hastie et al.,
2009) assumes that overlapping annotations by two or more judges constitutes evidence of the approxi-
mate location of an instance of the phenomenon of interest. In our case, this is the annotation of ADUs
that contain overlapping text. Each ADU starts in its own cluster. The start and end points of each ADU
are utilized to identify overlapping characters in pairs of ADUs. Then, using a bottom-up clustering

technique, pairs of clusters (e.g. pairs of Callout ADUs) with overlapping text strings are merged as they
move up in the hierarchy. An ADU that does not overlap with ADUs identified by any other judge will
remain in its own cluster.

Aggregating overlapping annotations makes it possible to quantify agreement among the annotators
within a cluster. Table 9 shows an example of a cluster that contains five annotations; all five annotators
assign identical unit boundaries, which means that there is a single core, with no variation in the extent of
the ADU. Table 9 thus shows an optimal case – there is complete agreement among the five annotators.
We take this as strong evidence that the text string in Table 9 is an instance of a Callout that is relatively
easy to identify.

But of course, natural language does not make optimal annotation easy (even if coders were perfect).
Table 10 shows a cluster in which all five annotators agree on the core (shown in italics) but do not
agree about the boundaries of the ADU. A1 picked the shortest text segment. A2, A3 and A4 picked the
same text segment as A1 but they also included the rest of the sentence, up to the word ‘browsing’. In
A5’s judgment, the ADU is still longer - it also includes the sentence ‘Great browser . . . work wonders.’
Although not as clear-cut as the examples in Table 9, the fact that in Table 10 all annotators chose
overlapping text is evidence that the core has special status in the context of in an annotation task where it
is known that even expert annotators disagree about borders. Examples like those in Table 10 can be used
to study the reasons for variation in the judges’ assignment of boundaries. Besides ease of recognition
of an ADU and differing human intuitions, the instructions in the guidelines or characteristics of the
Callouts may be also having an effect.

Table 11 shows a more complex annotation pattern in a cluster. Annotators A1 and A2 agree on the
boundaries of the ADU, but their annotation does not overlap with A4 at all. A3’s boundaries subsume
all other annotations. But because A4’s boundaries do not overlap with those of A1 and A2, technically
this cluster has no core (a text segment included in all ADUs in a cluster). 5% or less of the clusters
have this problem. To handle the absence of a core in this type of cluster, we split the clusters that fit this
pattern into multiple ‘overlapping’ clusters, that is, we put A1, A2, and A3 into one cluster and we put
A3 and A4 into another cluster. Using this splitting technique, we get two cores, each selected by two
judges: i) “actually the only . . . app’s developer” from the cluster containing A1, A2, and A3 (shown in
italics) and ii) “I think it hilarious . . . another device” from the cluster containing A3 and A4 (shown in
bold). The disagreement of the judges in identifying the Callout suggests that judges have quite different
judgments about boundaries of the Callouts.

Table 12 and 13 respectively show the number of clusters with overlapping annotations for Callouts
for each thread before and after splitting. The splitting process has only a small impact on results. The
number of clusters with five and four annotators shows that in each corpus there are Callouts that are
evidently easier to identify. On the other hand, clusters selected by only two or three judges are harder to

identify. The clusters containing a text string picked by only one annotator are hardest to identify. This
may be an indication that this text string is not a good example of a Callout, though it also could be an
indication that the judge is particularly good at recognizing subtly expressed Callouts. The clustering
technique thus scaffolds deeper examination of annotation behavior and annotation/concept refinement.
Table 13 also shows that overall, the number of clusters with five or four annotators is well over 50% for
each thread except Ban, even when we exclude the clusters with an ADU identified by only one judge.
This is another hint that the IAA in this thread should be much lower than in the other threads. (See also
Figures 2 and 3).

Table 13: Callouts: Clusters after splitting process

The clusters with cores supported by four or five annotators show strong annotator agreement and are
very strong candidates for a gold standard, regardless of the IAA for the entire thread. Clusters with
an ADU selected by only one annotator are presumably harder to annotate and are more likely than
other clusters not to be actual instances of the ADU. This information can be used to assess the output
of systems that automatically identify discourse units. For example a system could be penalized more
for missing to identifying ADUs on which all five annotators agree on the boundaries, as in Table 9;
the penalty would be decreased for not identifying ADUs on which fewer annotators agree. Qualitative
analysis may help discover the reason for the variation in strength of clusters, thereby supporting our
ability to interpret IAA and to create accurate computational models of human judgments about dis-
course units. As a related research, PAT and the clustering technique discussed in this paper allow the
development of a finer-grained annotation scheme to analyze the type of links between Target-Callout
(e.g., Agree/Disagree/Other), and the nature of Callouts (e.g., Stance/Rationale) (Ghosh et al., 2014).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Reliability of annotation studies is important both as part of the demonstration of the validity of the
phenomena being studied and also to support accurate computational modeling of discourse phenomena.
The nature of ADUs, with their fuzzy boundaries, makes it hard to achieve IAA of .80 or higher. Fur-
thermore, the use of a single figure for IAA is a little like relying on an average to convey the range of
variation of a set of numbers. The contributions of this paper are i) to provide concrete examples of the
difficulties of using state of the art metrics like P/R/F1 and Krippendorff’s α to assess IAA for ADUs
and ii) to open up a new approach to studying IAA that can help us understand how factors like coder
variability and text difficulty affect IAA. Our approach supports reliable identification of discourse units
independent of the overall IAA of the document.
