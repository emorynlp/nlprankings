Abstract 

The problem of Word Sense Disambiguation 

(WSD) can be defined as the task of assigning the 

most appropriate sense to the polysemous word 

within a given context. Many supervised, 

unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches 

have been devised to deal with this problem, 

particularly, for the English language. However, 

this is not the case for Hindi language, where not 

much work has been done. In this paper, a new 

approach has been developed to perform 

disambiguation in Hindi language. For training 

the system, the text in Hindi language is 

converted into Hyperspace Analogue to 

Language (HAL) vectors, thereby, mapping each 

word into a high-dimensional space. We also deal 

with the fuzziness involved in disambiguation of 

words. We apply Fuzzy C-Means Clustering 

algorithm to form clusters denoting the various 

contexts in which the polysemous word may 

occur. The test data is then mapped into the high 

dimensional space created during the training 

phase. We test our approach on the corpus created 

using Hindi news articles and Wikipedia. We 

compare our approach with other significant 

approaches available in the literature and the 

experimental results indicate that our approach 

outperforms all the previous works done for 

Hindi Language. 

 

1. Introduction: 

Words in a language may carry more than one 

sense. Human beings can easily decipher the 

context in which the word is being used in a 

sentence. However, the same cannot be said for 

the machines. Various applications like speech 

processing, text processing, search engines, etc, 

in order to function properly, need to figure out 

the sense of the word. Thus there is a need for 

word sense disambiguation for correctly 

interpreting the meaning of a sentence written in 

natural language. 

Given a word and its possible senses, as defined 

in a knowledge base, the problem of Word Sense 

Disambiguation (WSD) can be defined as the 

process of identifying which sense of a word (i.e. 

meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word 

has multiple meanings. It was first formulated as 

a distinct computational task during the early 

days of machine translation in the 1940s, making 

it one of the oldest problems in computational 

linguistics. 

Warren Weaver (1949), in his famous 1949 

memorandum on translation, first introduced the 

problem in a computational context. Early 

researchers understood the significance and 

difficulty of WSD well. Since then there have 

been various approaches for handling the 

problem of Word Sense Disambiguation. 

Majorly, WSD can be done using Knowledge 

Based Approaches (Navigli, 2009), Machine 

Based Approaches (Navigli, 2009) and Hybrid 

Approach (Navigli, 2009). Knowledge-based 

methods rely primarily on dictionaries, thesauri, 

and lexical knowledge bases, without using any 

corpus evidence. Lesk Algorithm (1986) is a 

classical approach based on Knowledge bases. 

49



Semi-supervised or minimally supervised 

methods make use of a secondary source of 

knowledge such as a small annotated corpus as 

seed data in a bootstrapping process, or a word-

aligned bilingual corpus. Yarowsky Algorithm 

(1995) is based on this approach. Supervised 

methods make use of sense-annotated corpora to 

train from while unsupervised methods (Schütze, 

1998) are based on the assumption that similar 

senses occur in similar contexts, and thus senses 

can be induced from text by clustering word 

occurrences using some measure of similarity of 

context. 

Although much work is available for WSD in 

English language, but for Hindi language very 

few research works have been contributed. 

Sinha, Reddy and Bhattacharya (2012) did a 

statistical approach towards Word Sense 

Disambiguation in Hindi. In their work, a set of 

context words are selected using the surrounding 

window and for each sense w of a word, a 

semantic bag is created by referring to the Hindi 

WordNet® (hypernymy, hyponymy and 

meronymy).  They claim that sense of the word 

that has the maximum overlap between the 

context bag and the semantic bag is the correct 

sense. But, their system does not detect the 

underlying similarity in presence of 

morphological variations. Kumari and Singh 

(2013) used genetic algorithm to perform word 

sense disambiguation on Hindi nouns. Genetic 

algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm used to 

find approximate solutions to optimization and 

search problems using techniques inspired by 

evolutionary biology. But in their work, the recall 

values associated with the algorithm depend upon 

the genetic parameters chosen for evaluation and 

therefore is not universally applicable. Yadav and 

Vishwakarma (2013) use association rules to first 

mine the itemsets depending upon the context of 

the ambiguous word and then mine the 

association rule corresponding to the most 

frequent itemset. 

Tomar et al. (2013) use the technique of PLSA 

for making ‘k’ clusters representing the senses or 

the different contexts of the word. The clusters 

are then further enriched using the Hindi 

WordNet®. The cluster with which the maximum 

similarity score (cosine distance) is obtained 

gives the correct sense of the ambiguous word. 

The performance of their work varies linearly 

with the amount of training data used. In (2013), 

Jain, Yadav and Tayal used graph based approach 

for Word Sense Disambiguation in Hindi Text. 

Here, to construct a graph for the sentence each 

sense of the ambiguous word is taken as a source 

node and all the paths which connect the sense to 

other words present in the sentence are added. 

The importance of nodes in the constructed graph 

is identified using node neighbor based measures 

and graph clustering based measures. This 

method disambiguates all open class words and 

disambiguates all the words present in the 

sentence simultaneously. 

In (2005) , Hao Chen, Tingting He, Donghong Ji 

and Changqin Quan used an unsupervised 

approach, for disambiguating words in Chinese 

Language, where contexts that include 

ambiguous words are converted into vectors by 

means of a second-order context method, and 

these context vectors are then clustered by the k-

means clustering algorithm and lastly, the 

ambiguous words can be disambiguated after a 

similarity calculation process is completed. But, 

the K-means clustering limits the word to belong 

to only one cluster and hence also limits the 

accuracy of Word Sense Disambiguation. After 

going through the literature survey, we found that 

all the methodologies for WSD used till date do 

not take into account the fuzziness involved in 

disambiguation of the words. 

In this paper, we develop an approach whereby 

we first train our system taking Hindi newspaper 

and Wikipedia articles as input and use 

Hyperspace Analogue to Language model to 

convert Hindi words into vectors, representing 

points in the high dimensional Hyperspace. 

50



Fuzzy C-Means Clustering is then applied to get 

the clusters where each word may belong to more 

than one cluster with an associated membership 

value. The words belonging to one context are 

grouped together in a cluster. The polysemous 

words belong to more than one cluster, each 

cluster corresponding to the possible sense of that 

word. Once the training of the system is 

complete, the test data containing the polysemous 

word is processed using Hyperspace Analogue to 

Language (HAL) model to map the polysemous 

word of the test data as a point in the hyperspace 

created in the training phase. Then, Euclidean 

Distance is calculated between this point and all 

the cluster centers and the nearest cluster 

corresponds to the sense of the polysemous word 

used in the test data. And similar computation can 

be easily performed for each polysemous word of 

the test data in order to determine the correct 

sense of that word. 

We tested our approach using Netbeans IDE to 

develop a Hyperspace Analogue to Language 

(HAL) Model and MATLAB for construction of 

fuzzy clusters and finding the nearest cluster. The 

results obtained were compared with all of the 

previous approaches and our approach shows the 

best results. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as 

follows: Section 2 provides a review of 

Hyperspace Analogue to Language, Fuzzy Logic 

and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm. 

Section 3 describes the specifics of the proposed 

algorithm to carry out word sense 

disambiguation. Section 4 illustrates the 

application of the proposed approach on a small 

data set. Section 5 describes the experimental 

results obtained for our approach and the 

compares it with already existing techniques for 

Word Sense Disambiguation for Hindi language. 

Finally, the last section concludes the paper, and 

makes some suggestions for future work. 

 

2 Preliminaries: 

2.1 Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL): 

Hyperspace Analogue to Language is a numeric 

method developed by Kevin Lund and Curt 

Burgess (1996) for analyzing text. It does so by 

running a sliding window of fixed length across a 

text, calculating a matrix of word co-occurrence 

values along the way. The basic premise that the 

work relies on is that words with similar 

meanings repeatedly occur closely (also known 

as co-occurrence).  

Given a N word vocabulary, the HAL space is a  

N × N matrix constructed by moving a window 

of length l over the corpus by one word 

increments. Given two words W1 and W2, whose 

distance within the window is d, the weight of 

association between them is computed by l − d +

1. After traversing the corpus, an accumulated co-

occurrence matrix for all the words in a target 

vocabulary is produced. HAL is direction 

sensitive: the co-occurrence information for 

words preceding each word and co-occurrence 

information for words following each word are 

recorded separately by row and column vectors. 

2.1.1 Illustration: 

Consider the following piece of Hindi Text:  

“भारत की राजधानी दिल्ली है। दिल्ली मे अनेक वर्ग के लोर् 

है।”  

HAL Matrix constructed is as follows: 

 भारत  राजधानी  दिल्ली  वर्ग  लोर्  

भारत  -  -  -  -  -  

राजधानी  4  -  -  -  -  

दिल्ली  4  8  -  -  -  

वर्ग  -  -  4  -  -  

लोर्  -  -  1  4  -  

Taking a window of size 6, we consider all the 

words that are lying before and after the focus 

word but within the context window. For 

example, consider the word ““लोर्”. The distance 

51



between “वर्ग” and “लोर्” in the sentence given 

above is 3. So the value of the cell(लोर्, वर्ग) = 6-

3+1=4. 

2.2 Fuzzy Logic: 

Fuzzy logic (2005) is a form of many-valued 

logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate 

rather than fixed and exact. Compared to 

traditional binary sets (where variables may take 

on true or false values), fuzzy logic variables may 

have a truth value that ranges in degree between 

0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle 

the concept of partial truth, where the truth value 

may range between completely true and 

completely false (1999). The term fuzzy logic 

was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy 

set theory by Lotfi A. Zadeh (1965). Fuzzy logic 

has been applied to many fields, from control 

theory to artificial intelligence. 

2.3 Fuzzy C-Means Clustering: 

Data clustering is the process of dividing data 

elements into classes or clusters so that items in 

the same class are as similar as possible, and 

items in different classes are as dissimilar as 

possible. Depending on the nature of the data and 

the purpose for which clustering is being used, 

different measures of similarity may be used to 

place items into classes, where the similarity 

measure controls how the clusters are formed. 

Some examples of measures that can be used as 

in clustering include distance, connectivity, and 

intensity. 

In hard clustering, data is divided into distinct 

clusters, where each data element belongs to 

exactly one cluster. In fuzzy clustering (also 

referred to as soft clustering), data elements can 

belong to more than one cluster, and associated 

with each element is a set of membership levels. 

These indicate the strength of the association 

between that data element and a particular cluster. 

Fuzzy clustering is a process of assigning these 

membership levels, and then using them to assign 

data elements to one or more clusters. Thus, 

points on the edge of a cluster, may be in the 

cluster to a lesser degree than points in the center 

of cluster. In (Ross, 2004), Fuzzy C-Means 

(FCM) is described as a method of clustering 

which allows one piece of data to belong to two 

or more clusters. It is based on minimization of 

the following objective function: 

  

𝐽𝑚 = ∑ ∑ 𝑢𝑖𝑗
𝑚 || xi − cj||

2  𝐶𝑗=1
𝑁
𝑖=1          …….…1 

where m is any real number greater than 1, uij is 

the degree of membership of xi in the cluster j, xi 

is the ith of d-dimensional measured data, cj is the 

d-dimension center of the cluster, and ||*|| is any 

norm expressing the similarity between any 

measured data and the center. Fuzzy partitioning 

is carried out through an iterative optimization of 

the objective function shown above, with the 

update of membership uij and the cluster centers 

cj by: 

 

𝑢𝑖𝑗 =
1

∑ (
 ||xi−cj||

||xi−ck||
)

2
𝑚−1𝐶

𝑘=1

                         ……......2 

 

𝑐𝑗 =
∑ 𝑢𝑖𝑗

𝑚.𝑥𝑖
𝑁
𝑖=1

∑ 𝑢𝑖𝑗
𝑚𝑁

𝑖=1

                                      ….….....3 

 

3. Proposed Approach: 

The disambiguation process can be divided into 

two phases- Training Phase and Testing Phase. 

3.1 Training Phase 

The Training Phase involves the use of 

Hyperspace Analogue to Language model and 

Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm to cluster 

the words in the Q-dimensional space where Q is 

the number of significant words in the training 

document. Each cluster denotes the context in 

which the ambiguous word may occur. Here, a 

word can belong to more than one cluster, and 

associated with each word is a set of membership 

levels. More the membership value, more the 

word belongs to that cluster. The flow chart of the 

Training Phase is shown below: 

 

52



 
Figure 1: Training Phase 

3.1.1 Training Document: 

A set of documents were selected for the purpose 

of collecting words and then building the clusters 

of those words based on their co-occurrences. 

Documents used for training included articles 

from Hindi newspapers, magazines and 

Wikipedia.  

 3.1.2 Hyperspace Analogue to Language: 

In this phase, the training documents are 

processed as per the Hyperspace Analogue to 

Language Model. The algorithm for HAL (Lund 

and Burgess, 1998) calculates HAL matrix 

containing entries corresponding to all the unique 

words occurred during the training of the system. 

The matrix so generated is a N × N matrix where 

N is the total number of unique words in the 

training document set. 

 3.1.3 Dimension Reduction of the Matrix: 

As mentioned previously, the training document 

is a collection of the words, taken from a source 

such as news articles, Wikipedia and magazines. 

Some words are significant during the process of 

disambiguation while the other words that are not 

significant with respect to disambiguation 

process are called as the stop words like की है, 
की,और,यह ाँ,पर,को,थ ,यह,थ,ेक ,जिसकी,हुई,थी etc. 
Since the words are not significant with respect to 

our disambiguation process, we can remove the 

rows and columns corresponding to these words 

from Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) 

Matrix that helps in reducing the dimensionality 

of the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) 

space and further mathematical processing of the 

stop words. This reduction process reduces the 

N × N dimensional HAL matrix into Q × Q 

dimensional HAL matrix where Q is the number 

of significant words in the training document 

which are used for the disambiguation process. 

 3.1.4 Normalization: 

The reduced HAL matrix is then normalized to 

get the HAL vector corresponding to each 

significant word.   

In order to represent a Word as a Point in Q 

dimensional space, we consider each word as a 

concept: 

Concept C = < 𝑊𝑐𝑝1, 𝑊𝑐𝑝2, 𝑊𝑐𝑝3, …… 𝑊𝑐𝑝𝑄> 

 

where 𝑝1, 𝑝2... pn are called dimensions of C, 

each corresponding to a unique word that forms a 

dimension of the hyperspace and 𝑊𝑐𝑝𝑖, denotes 

the weight of 𝑝𝑖 in the vector representation of C. 

In order to calculate weights, we normalize the 

values in the HAL matrix. 

Normalization Formula: 

                                          

       𝑊𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑗 =
𝑊𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑗+𝑊𝑐𝑗𝑝𝑖  

√∑ 𝑊𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑘
2+𝑊𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑖

2𝑄
𝑘=1

     ………4                                               

Since we need to consider the correlation 

between two given words irrespective of the 

order in which those words appeared, we consider 

both 𝑊𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑗 and𝑊𝑐𝑗𝑝𝑖  . 

Therefore, by constructing a HAL space from 

training document, concepts are represented as 

weighted vectors in the high dimensional space, 

whereby each word in the vocabulary of the

corpus gives rise to an axis in the corresponding 

semantic space. 

 3.1.5 Fuzzy C-Means Clustering 

The HAL vectors for Q words generated in the 

previous step represent Q points in the  

Q-dimensional space. These vectors are then fed 

in as the input to the module implementing Fuzzy 

C-Means Clustering algorithm. The output of the 

Fuzzy Clustering module is a set of fuzzy clusters 

each representing a context of the ambiguous 

word. As is the nature of fuzzy clusters, a word 

may belong to one or more clusters with different 

membership values. 

 

3.2 Testing Phase 

This phase describes the disambiguation of the 

senses of the target ambiguous word in the test 

data. The flow diagram shown below describes 

the process:

 

Figure 2 Testing Phase

Given the test data, we apply HAL Model to get 

the M × M HAL Matrix where M is the number 

of unique words in the test data. The rows and 

columns in the HAL matrix correspond to the 

word in the test data. Dimension reduction and 

Normalization process is applied in the manner 

similar to the training phase to get the HAL 

vectors of the words in the test data. 

In order to apply dissimilarity measure for 

disambiguation process in the Q-dimensional 

Hyperspace, we need to map the M-dimensional 

HAL vector of the target ambiguous word to the 

Q-dimensional vector in the Hyperspace 

generated in the training phase. 

The mapping process involves initializing the Q-

dimensional HAL vector of the ambiguous word 

to all zeros and then finding the common words 

in the training document and the test data. The 

weights corresponding to the common words are 

extracted from the M-dimensional HAL vector of 

the test data and then these weights are 

substituted in the Q-dimensional HAL vector of 

the test data with respect to the indexes of the

words generated in the training phase. Hence, we 

get the Q-dimensional HAL vector of the target 

ambiguous word with respect to the test data 

containing weights for common words and zeros 

for the other dimensions. 

In order to disambiguate the correct sense of the 

target ambiguous word, Euclidean distance 

between target word’s HAL vector and centers of 

the clusters generated in the previous phase are 

calculated one by one as follows: 

  

𝑑(𝑝, 𝑞) = 𝑑(𝑞, 𝑝)

=  √(𝑞1 − 𝑝1)
2 + (𝑞2 − 𝑝2)

2 + ⋯ + (𝑞𝑄 − 𝑝𝑄)
2

= √∑(𝑞𝑖 − 𝑝𝑖)
2

𝑛

𝑖=1

 

 

…………..5 

The one with the minimum distance is then 

chosen to be the most related cluster and hence 

that corresponds to the most related sense. 

 

4. Illustrative Example 

The following example illustrates the proposed 

technique for disambiguation for the polysemous 

word ‘तीर’. 
The word ‘तीर’ can have different senses as 
follows: 

•    ध त ुआदि क  बन  वह पतल  लम्ब  हथथय र िो धनुष द्व र  
चल य  ि त  है (Arrow) 
•    निी य  िल शय क  ककन र  (Bank of River) 
 

The training data for the above mentioned 

ambiguous word can be found in the Appendix. 

Training Data consists of total 91 words. After 

removing the stop words we get 63 base words: 

धनुष,प्रयुक्त,व ल ,अस्त्र,तीर,अग्र,भ ग,नुकील ,सववप्रथम,उल्लेख
,ऋग्वेि,संदहत ,ममलत ,इषुकृत,्इषुक र,मसद्ध,दिनों,ननम वण-
क यव,व्यवजस्त्थत,व्यवस य,ऋग्वेिक लीन,लोह र,केवल,लोहे,क म
,तैय र,बन त ,शेष, 
ब ण,ननम वत ननक य,भीषण,ब ढ़,भूस्त्खलन,तब ही,सबक,उत्तर 
खंड,सरक र,र ज्य,नदियों,नई,इम रतें, 

बन न,ेपूरी,रोक,लग ,िी,आपि ,प्रभ ववत,लोगों,ववत्तीय,मिि,िेने
,उबरने,अल्पक मलक,िीर्वक मलक,किम,उठ न,ेव स्त्त,े 
पुनननवम वण,पुनव वस, प्र थधकरण, फैसल  . 
Using these base words, we form a HAL matrix 

of dimensions 63 × 63 using the window of size 

10. Normalization is carried out over the HAL 

Matrix to get the HAL vectors corresponding to 

each unique word. This was developed in the 

code written in Java language using the NetBeans 

Platform. Fuzzy C-Means Clustering is then 

applied to the generated HAL Vectors. Two 

clusters have been generated using code written 

in the Matlab. The following snippet shows the 

minimization of the objective function (using 

Equation 1) in the process of generating the 

clusters. 

 
Figure 3: Minimization of the objective 

function in fuzzy clustering 

Once we get the clusters, we consider the test 

data.  

Refer to Appendix for test data used in this case. 

 

The HAL vector (63 dimensional) is then 

obtained for the ambiguous word तीर. Euclidean 
distance between the Test Vector and the two 

cluster centers are calculated. The following 

snapshot shows the two values. 

 
Cluster 2 is hence obtained as the target sense of 

the ambiguous word which means that the word 

‘तीर’ here is correctly disambiguated as ‘Arrow’.

5. Results and Discussions 

Since there is no standard corpus available for 

Hindi language, we created our own corpus  by 

selecting relevant articles from Hindi Wikipedia 

as well as Hindi language newspapers viz Dainik 

Jagran, Nav Bharat Times etc.  

The training data used consists of 3753 words in 

total. A collection of polysemous words was 

made and training data was collected depicting 

the different contexts in which the word was used. 

The formula for accuracy is given as follows: 

𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦

=
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑙𝑦 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠
 

When the proposed technique for disambiguation 

of Hindi Text was applied on the corpus, we 

found an efficiency of nearly 79.16%. Our 

technique, therefore, performs better than all the 

previously used approaches used for performing 

word sense disambiguation in Hindi language. It 

can be noted that all the methodologies used till 

date do not take into account the fuzziness 

involved in disambiguation of the words. In this 

paper, we use the concept of Fuzzy C-Means 

Clustering to overcome this major drawback of 

the previous approaches. 

The following table shows the comparative 

efficiency of our technique with the previous 

techniques available in the literature that have 

been used in Word Sense Disambiguation in the 

Hindi language with their comparative 

accuracies. Thus, we conclude that the results 

obtained from our approach are better than all the 

other approaches that currently exist in the Hindi 

language and this is what makes it more 

promising.

 

6. Conclusion: 

In this work, we have proposed a new approach 

for Hindi Word Sense Disambiguation which 

incorporates fuzzy measures. We found that 

unlike the previous unsupervised approaches 

which discard contexts into which an ambiguous 

word may fall, the current approach retains the 

fuzziness associated with the ambiguity, thereby, 

giving better results. Moreover, the technique 

proposed by us is not language specific; it can be 

extended to other languages as well. As is evident 

from the results obtained by the use of HAL that 

the context knowledge in context specific WSD 

is very important and that world knowledge from 

the surrounding words plays a very important role

Thus, the above mentioned advantages make our 

approach particularly promising. This approach 

can be extended in the future to include semantic 

relations from sources like Wikipedia and 

Wordnet in the enrichment of clusters that will 

lead to better accuracy for disambiguating a 

polysemous word.

Translation: Arrow (तीर) is a pointed instrument used with 

the bow. Tracing the history, its first mention was in 

‘Rigved’.The use of words ‘ishukrit’ and ‘ishukar’ signifies 

that the people in those days were involved in the business 

of Arrow(तीर( making. The pointed front part of the 

arrow(तीर) was manufactured by Ironsmith while the rest 

was made by other specialized manufacturer.

Translation: The Government of Uttarakhand has banned 

the construction of new buildings due to heavy floods and 

landslide in the region. The Government has also decided 

to take all kinds of steps that includes providing financial 

help to disaster prone people to overcome the big loss.

Translation: The art of arrow (तीर) making is described in 

‘Agnipuran’. It mentions that the arrow(तीर) is made up of 

either iron or the wood. The material used should be a good 

quality golden coloured wood. Feather like structure is 

attached to the end of the arrow(तीर). Proper oiling of the 

arrow should be done to enable ease of use. The pointed 

front end of the arrow also has small amount of gold 

attached to it. In past, Bow and arrow were used during war 

times to kill the enemy
