Abstract

A person’s expressive behavior is differ-
ent in situations where he or she is alone,
or where an additional person is present.
This study looks at the extent to which such
physical co-presence effects have an impact
on a child’s ability to deceive. Using an
experimental digitized puppet show, truth-
ful and deceptive utterances were elicited
from children who were interacting with
two story characters. The children were
sitting alone, or as a couple together with
another child. A first perception study in
which minimal pairs of truthful and decep-
tive utterances were shown (vision-only) to
adult observers revealed that the correct de-
tection of deceptive utterances is depen-
dent on whether the stimuli were produced
by a child alone or together with another
child (both being visible). A second per-
ception study presented participants with
videos from children of the couples condi-
tion that were edited so that only one child
was visible. The study revealed that the de-
ceptive utterances could more often be de-
tected correctly in the more talkative chil-
dren than in the more passive ones.

1 Introduction

Deceiving others is not always easy. Past re-
search has shown that various factors can have a
detrimental effect on a person’s deceptive skills,
as it may matter whom one tries to deceive,
what kind of lie is being produced, and un-
der what circumstances a lie is elicited (De-
Paulo, Lindsay, Malone, Muhlenbruck, Charlton,
& Cooper 2003). The current study wants to ex-
plore whether the behavior of a deceiver is in-
fluenced by co-presence effects: i.e., is there an

essential difference between a deceiver who is
solely responsible for the lie he or she is produc-
ing, and someone who shares the responsibility
for the deceit with another person who is phys-
ically present. We investigate such questions in
data produced by children around the age of 5,
and focus in particular on possible nonverbal cues
to deception. As such, the current investigation
fits with other studies on deceptive skills of chil-
dren, given that these skills may reveal important
aspects of a child’s cognitive development. In-
deed, telling a lie is often claimed to be mentally
more demanding than telling the truth, and also
presumes that one is able to understand and ma-
nipulate another person’s perspective on a given
state of affair. Given this, the study of lies has
been thought to be potentially useful as a means
to learn more about how growing children develop
their metacognitive skills (e.g. Talwar, Lee, Bala,
& Lindsay, 2004; Talwar, Murphy, & Lee, 2007).

Previous researchers have often explored some-
one’s deceptive skills by running perception ex-
periments in which independent observers have to
judge in recordings of speakers whether a person
is telling the truth or not. The current study ex-
plores whether the detection of a lie is different
when an observer has to judge the recording of
a person who is alone, or of a person who pro-
duces a lie together with another person. From
the literature, it is not immediately clear whether
co-presence effects are likely to maximize or di-
minish the perceived difference between truth and
deceit. On the one hand, one could hypothesize
that the presence of another person may make it
easier for an observer to detect whether some-
one is telling the truth or not. Such an expecta-
tion could be based on studies that suggest that

55



people contaminate each other’s expressive be-
haviour, such that their facial and other nonverbal
cues become more pronounced and more clearly
interpretable for observers as cues to deception.
In a study with game-playing children (Shahid,
Krahmer, & Swerts 2008), to give an example,
it was found that observers tend to find it eas-
ier to determine whether a child had won or lost
a card guessing game, when it was playing to-
gether with another child, compared to a situation
in which it was playing the game alone. That re-
sult is reminiscent of work on gesturing, where it
is often reported that speakers become more ex-
pressive when they are directly being observed by
someone else. Bavelas, Gerwing, Sutton, and Pre-
vost (2008), for instance, found that speakers ges-
ture more and with a larger amplitude if they are
engaged in a face-to-face interaction, compared
to a telephone conversation or in a setting where
they talk to an answering machine. Similar find-
ings were reported by Mol, Krahmer, Maes, and
Swerts (2009).

On the other hand, findings that indicate that
people become more expressive in the presence
of other people may not generalize to all situa-
tional contexts, and may sometimes even be op-
posite to what was described above. For instance,
Lee and Wagner (2002) analysed video record-
ings of women who were speaking about a pos-
itive or a negative experience either in the pres-
ence of an experimenter or alone. They found
that women were more expressive about posi-
tive emotions when another person was present,
whereas the negative emotions were less clearly
expressed when someone else was present. These
results show that social context can have differ-
ent kinds of effects on a person’s nonverbal be-
havior depending on a speaker’s specific state of
mind. This begs the question as to what happens
when people are trying to deceive another person,
and whether possible nonverbal correlates of their
deceptive behavior become more pronounced or
rather more diminished in contexts where they are
alone, or physically co-present with other people.
Moreover, from a perceptual perspective, it is not
clear whether an observer would profit from the
fact that he or she has to judge the truthfulness of
only one person or of more than one person simul-
taneously. It could be that the exposure to multi-
ple persons would make it easier for an observer
because of having access to more resources to de-

cide about truth or lie. But it could also be the case
that the mere fact that an observer would have
to judge multiple people at the same time would
make the task of detecting deception more chal-
lenging than in the case where only one person
is speaking, because it might be that subtle cor-
relates of deception would escape the observer’s
attention.

Given the overall aim to investigate the effect
of physical co-presence on a child’s deceptive be-
havior, this study also explores whether the child’s
specific role in a situational context is of impor-
tance for the correct detection of deception. It has
of course already been known for a few decades
that a person’s personality may matter, for in-
stance in that extraverts tend to show more cor-
relates of deception than introvert people (e.g.
Bradley & Janisse 1981). Also, previous work
suggests that more dominant people exhibit dif-
ferent kinds of nonverbal behaviour than follow-
ers (Tiedens & Fragale 2003). In line with this
observation, we will look at children who are pas-
sive or active in a setting, and see whether that
difference has repercussions for lie detection. On
the one hand, active children in being more in-
volved in the interaction may increase the likeli-
hood of showing nonverbal cues to deception. On
the other hand, it may that the more passive chil-
dren may reveal such cues more clearly, as a result
of their belief that the observer’s focus of attention
is directed towards the more active child, so that
they leak more cues to deception.

The current research consists of two perception
experiments. Experiment 1 investigates whether
correlates of a child’s deceptive behaviour are
different for situations in which the child is ei-
ther alone or co-present with another child. Ex-
periment 2 looks at differences between partici-
pants within an interaction, in particular compar-
ing children who are very active and talkative ver-
sus those who take less initiative. We only focus
on visual cues (from which auditory features are
removed), given that earlier work (Ecoff, Ekman,
Mage & Frank 2000) has shown that observers
can more accurately detect deception when they
only have to focus on one modality (compared to
tests with multimodal stimuli).

2 Interactive elicitation procedure

To obtain truthful and deceptive utterances from
children, a new elicitation procedure was used,

56



based on a computerized version of an animated
puppet show. In the set-up, child participants are
seated in front of a computer screen on which they
see a story that unfolds. While the story is actually
controlled by the experimenter (whom the child
cannot see), the child is given the impression that
some crucial actions of 2 main characters depend
on the input of the child participant. During the
interaction, the video and speech of the child are
being recorded with a camera that is positioned on
the top of the computer screen to which the child
is looking. In this way, the recordings capture the
faces and upper part of the chest (frontal view) of
the child participants.

Figure 1: A few visual materials of scenes used in
the interactive puppet show

The show starts with a longer part in which a
narrating voice introduces 2 main characters, a
prince (the good guy) and a dragon (the bad guy),
to the participating child, in a typical fairy-tale

plot. The narrator explains to the child that a bad
dragon has been terrorizing a far-away country.
Luckily, Prince Peter has come up with a plan to
capture the dragon, for which he needs the help
from the child. The narrator explains that the per-
son who catches the dragon, receives a reward
(a bag of gold) from the king. In order to in-
crease the child’s level of engagement, an actual
bag of gold (actually, chocolate coins wrapped in
goldish-looking paper) is clearly shown on a table
in the visual field of the participant. Then the in-
teractive part starts in which child utterances are
elicited from exchanges with the 2 main charac-
ters of the story, the prince and the dragon. The
interactive part contains 2 central scenes designed
to elicit minimal pairs of truthful and deceptive ut-
terances from children to be used in a perception
test later on. As will become clear below, decep-
tive utterances are elicited from a child’s interac-
tion with the dragon, and the truthful ones from
interactions with the prince.

First, the prince appears, and asks the child for
its name, mainly to ensure that the latter becomes
aware that it can interact with the story character.
After this, the prince tells the child that he wants
to capture the dragon, and needs the child’s help.
He tells the child that he will hide behind a tree
(shown on the left of the screen), and that, if the
dragon appears, the child needs to tell the dragon
that the prince has entered the castle (shown on
the right of the screen). Then he hides behind
the tree, after which the dragon appears on stage
and asks the child where the prince is. The child
typically replies with a deceptive phrase like “in
the castle” (first deceptive response), after which
the dragon expresses some disbelief about this re-
sponse, and repeats the earlier question, so that
the child needs to repeat the earlier response (sec-
ond deceptive response). Then, the dragon leaves,
enters the castle, after which the prince appears
again. He tells the child he believes he has heard
the dragon, and asks where the dragon is, to which
a child typically responds with a truthful “in the
castle” (first truthful response). The prince says
he cannot believe that response, so asks the child
to repeat its truthful utterance (second truthful re-
sponse). Given that both the deceptive and truth-
ful scene contain a repeat, we obtain 4 versions
from every participating child of the utterance
“in the castle” (or equivalent phrases like “in the
tower”, or “in the church”): first and second at-

57



tempts of truthful and deceptive utterances. Fig-
ure 1 depicts some representative scenes from the
story.

We obtained minimal pairs (truthful and de-
ceptive variants of the utterance “in the castle”)
from 38 children (18 boys; 20 girls), who had vol-
unteered for the experiment with written consent
from their parents and/or primary caretakers. The
average age of these children was 5 years and 7
months (minimum: 4 years and 10 months; max-
imum: 6 and 4 months) in addition, we collected
recordings for 10 pairs of children who did the
same task as the singles, but sitting next to each
other and both facing the screen. Their average
age was 5 years and 5 months (minimum: 4 years
and 3 months; maximum: 6 and 9 months). Note
that the task given to the pairs of children was
the same as the one given to the children sitting
alone. It was interesting to note that there was es-
sentially no interaction between two participants
in the pairs condition, and that they basically only
responded to questions and instructions from the
story characters. We did observe, however, that
within these pairs, there tended to be a division of
labor, in that one of the children would typically
take the initiative and talk to the story characters,
while the other would be more passive.

3 Experiment 1: singles vs. couples

The first experiment explores whether there is a
difference in the extent to which lies can be de-
tected in children who are interacting alone with
some story characters, versus children who are
doing a similar task together with another child.

3.1 Method

3.1.1 Stimuli
The stimuli consisted of the children’s re-

sponses to either the prince (truthful) or the
dragon (deceptive), where some of the children
were interacting alone, and some were interact-
ing in couples. As said above, stimuli were pre-
sented as video-only materials, so with the sound
removed.

3.1.2 Participants
The data for the singles condition were col-

lected in an earlier study, and came from 20 ob-
servers (Swerts 2011). In addition, 121 partici-
pants took part in the couples condition of the ex-

periment, as partial fulfillment to get course cred-
its.

3.1.3 Procedure
Observers were presented with pairs of video

recordings, i.e., a truthful and a deceptive utter-
ance of either a single child, or similar clips in
which 2 children are visible who are sitting next
to each other. Pairs of recordings were either com-
paring the children’s first time they had responded
to a question from the prince or the dragon, or
pairs of utterances of their second responses to
those characters. Note that pairs of stimuli shown
to observers were always produced by the same
child. Stimuli were presented in a group exper-
iment, although each participant had to perform
the test individually (paper-and-pencil test). The
task given to observers was to guess by forced
choice which of the 2 clips they saw contained a
child’s deceptive utterance. The order of presenta-
tion of the truthful and deceptive utterance within
a pair, and of the pairs within the larger test was
fully randomized.

3.2 Results

The observer responses were analysed with a re-
peated measures ANOVA with the percentage
correct detection of deceptive utterances for all
stimulus pairs per observer as dependent variable,
and with attempt (2 levels: first attempt, second
attempt) and order (2 levels: deceptive utterance
shown first, deceptive utterance shown second)
as within-subject factors, and presence (2 levels:
alone, together) as between-subject factors. Ta-
ble 1 reveals that, while the main effects of pres-
ence and attempt are not significant, there is a
significant effect of presentation order on the ob-
servers’ likelihood to correctly detect the decep-
tive utterance: deceptive utterances could more
easily be detected correctly if they were shown
after the truthful utterance, rather than the other
way around. In addition, we found a significant
2-way interaction between attempt and presence
(F(1,139) = 5.793, p < .05, �2p = .040), which
can be explained by the data shown in table 2.
As can be seen, for the alone condition, observers
tend to find it easier to detect the deceptive utter-
ance in pairs of second interactions with the story
characters, than in the first interactions. However,
for those stimuli taken from children being to-
gether, there appears to be no difference between

3.3 Discussion

While the experiment did not reveal a main ef-
fect of co-presence on the detection of deception,
that factor turned out to be important in a 2-way
interaction with attempt. This significant interac-
tion may be explained by ceiling effects that are
only true for the condition in which 2 children
were being observed, but appear to be absent in
the alone condition. That is, in the alone condi-
tion, the probability to correctly detect a lie ap-
pears to depend on whether observers were seeing
a first or second attempt of a child interacting with
the story characters. As table 2 reveals, during a
second attempt, a single child was more likely to
show correlates of deceptive behavior compared
to its first attempt. That effect may be due to the
fact that during a second attempt a child is more
consciously aware of the fact that it tries to de-
ceive which may have the ironic counter-effect
that more cues to deception are leaked, as it tries
harder than the first time (Swerts 2011; see also
Wardlow Lane et al. 2006). However, in the to-
gether condition, it appears not to matter whether
the children were interacting for the first or sec-

ond time; rather, the results appears to be around
60% correct detection both during first and sec-
ond attempts. Compared with related studies in
this area of research (e.g. DePaulo, Lindsay, Mal-
one, Muhlenbruck, Charlton, & Cooper, 2003),
this percentage is high, so that some ceiling ef-
fects may come into play: the correct detection
for first attempts is already so high that it is hard
to get even better results during second attempts.
While experiment 1 has provided some evidence
that detection of deceit is affected by co-presence
effects, it remains unclear whether observers were
able to extract cues to deception from both chil-
dren in the together condition or whether they
were especially paying attention to certain types
of children. More specifically, informal observa-
tions of the video clips suggested that some chil-
dren were playing a more active role in the inter-
actions than other children.

4 Experiment 2: active vs. passive
children

Experiment 2 explores to what extent differences
between the child participants (talkative vs. silent
ones) may influence an observer’s ability to find a
deceptive utterance.

4.1 Method

4.1.1 Stimuli
The stimuli showed children from the couples

condition of experiment 1, except that the clips
only showed 1 child (zoomed in so that the other
child was not visible). As discussed above, when
two children were placed next to each other to in-
teract with the prince and the dragon in the story,
there tended to be one child who was more active

59

different levels of experimental factors

Factor Level Correct detection F-stats
Speaker Passive 50.4 (.18, 46.8 – 54.0) F(1,92) = 47.160, p < .001,

Active 62.0 (.15, 59.1 – 64.9) �2p = .339

Order Deception first 47.3 (.18, 43.7 – 50.9) F(1,92) = 23.889, p < .001,
Deception second 65.1 (.16, 61.9 – 68.3) �2p = .206

than the other when addressing the story charac-
ters. For the purpose of the current experiment,
we distinguished between children who were la-
beled “active” as those who had been speaking in
both the truthful and deceptive utterance, versus
the “passive” ones as those who had been silent in
at least one of the two. In doing so, we obtained
13 active and 7 passive children. Also, given that
we were only interested in the effect of passive vs
active children and to reduce the time it took to
complete the experiment, we decided to only use
stimuli from the second attempts of the children
to produce a truthful or deceptive utterance.

4.1.2 Participants
In total, 93 participants took part in the exper-

iment, as partial fulfillment to get course credits.
None of them had participated in any of the per-
ception tests of experiment 1.

4.1.3 Procedure
The procedure of this experiment was exactly

the same as the one used for experiment 1.

4.2 Results

The data were again analysed with a repeated
measures ANOVA with the percentage correct de-
tection of deceptive utterances for all stimulus
pairs per observer as dependent variable, and with
order (2 levels: deceptive utterance shown first,
deceptive utterance shown second) and speaker
role (2 levels: active, passive) as independent
within-subject factors. As shown in table 3, both
speaker type and presentation order had a signif-
icant effect on correct detection of the deceptive
utterance, such that observers found it easier to
detect the lies in the more active speakers, and in
those pairs in which the deceptive utterance was
presented as the second one in a pair (see also
experiment 1). Interestingly, the interaction be-

tween order and speaker role was not significant
(F(1,92) = 2.432, p = n.s., �2p = .026). As ta-
ble 4 reveals, the 2 effects of speaker role and or-
der are additive.

4.3 Discussion

Experiment 2 has shown that the likelihood of
correctly detecting whether a child is deceiving
or speaking the truth depends on how active it is
within a specific social context. That is, when it
takes the initiative of responding to the story char-
acters and is being relatively talkative, then this
level of engagement makes it easier for an ob-
server to decide whether or not the child is pro-
ducing a lie. Further research is needed to find out
why exactly it is that detection of deception is eas-
ier when people have to judge more active partic-
ipants. One reason could be that children who are
more active are also more expressive, which in-
creases the chances that specific cues to deception
are leaked to an observer. Such an explanation
would be compatible with earlier findings that the
accuracy with which lies can be detected correctly
varies for deceivers who have different personal-
ities. More specifically, it has been shown that,
when comparing introvert with extravert people,
it is generally easier to detect the lies in the latter
group (Bradley & Janisse, 1981).

In the current set-up of the experiment, the chil-

60



dren were not explicitly given any explicit roles in
the story, for instance, in that one of them would
be asked to be silent, while the other would be
given the instruction to take initiative with the
characters of the story. Rather, their level of en-
gagement within the interactive story occurred
spontaneously in the course of the interaction,
which was thought to guarantee that their interac-
tion was relatively natural. In future work, how-
ever, it could be worthwhile to make a partici-
pants’ active or passive role within the discourse
more explicit to the child and also measure as-
pects of their personality. This would help to de-
cide whether the detection of deception is due to
the fact that some children are more active, or to
the fact that some children are more extravert, or
to a combination of these factors.

5 General discussion

The current study revealed that deceiving children
are affected by co-presence effects. Experiment 1,
in which minimal pairs of truthful and deceptive
utterances were shown (vision-only) to adult ob-
servers, brought to light that the correct detection
of deceptive utterances is dependent on whether
the stimuli were produced by a child alone or to-
gether with another child. This result reminds one
of some practices in typical investigations of a
committed crime, where it is general practice to
confront various suspects with each other. Usu-
ally, the goal of letting multiple suspects meet
is to confront them with each other’s statements
from earlier police interrogations during which
they were separately interviewed independently
from each other. If these earlier sessions has let
to inconsistencies between the statements of the
different suspects, it might be interesting to see
how suspects react when they are exposed to each
other’s claims in a face-to-face situation. Ideally,
such a confrontation might help to let one of them
confess, or admit that an earlier claim was false.
Obviously, the story paradigm used in the produc-
tion experiment to elicit truthful and deceptive ut-
terances is different from such a police case, but
it does show that presence effects may maximize
the differences between truth and deceit.

This result appears to be compatible with the
idea that the presence of another person increases
a liar’s social awareness, which in turn might have
a detrimental effect on that person’s deceptive
skills. Such an effect could be similar to the re-

ported effect of an increased mental load on de-
ceptive behaviour: lying is generally assumed to
be more cognitively demanding than truth telling
(e.g. DePaulo, Lindsay, Malone, Muhlenbruck,
Charlton, & Cooper 2003; Vrij, Fisher, Mann, &
Leal 2006), given that liars have to monitor more
tasks than truth telling people, such as inventing
facts and controlling their behaviour while inter-
acting with another person. Consequently, tech-
niques that increase cognitive load, e.g. asking
people to tell a story in reverse order (Vrij, Mann,
Fisher, Leal, Milne, & Bull, 2008) or instructing
them to maintain eye contact with an interviewer
(Vrij, Mann, Leal, & Fisher 2010), tend to lead
to the effect that deception becomes more easily
observable. Under conditions of such increased
cognitive load, deceivers supposedly have less re-
sources to monitor their behavior, so that they leak
cues that others may pick up as indicators of de-
ception. Similarly, an increased social awareness
because of the mere presence of another person
could possibly lead to leaking more cues to lies.

The second perception experiment presented
participants with videos from children of the cou-
ples condition that were edited so that only one
child was visible. The study revealed that the de-
ceptive utterances could more often be detected
correctly in the more talkative children compared
to the more passive ones. It remains to be seen
whether these results are due to the fact that the
higher probability of correctly detecting decep-
tion in the more active children is due to the fact
that their higher level of engagement makes them
more expressive and more likely to leak cues to
deception, or because these more active children
have a more extravert personality that has been
shown to show more cues to deception than more
introvert children (Bradley & Janisse, 1981).

And finally, we found an additional order ef-
fect, as deceptive utterances can more often be
detected correctly when they are presented as the
second in a pair, as opposed to when they are pre-
sented as the first ones. This effect, in line with
previous observations by O’Sullivan et al (1988),
could be related to what is known as the truth
bias in the literature on deception, which refers
to “an a priori belief, expectation, or presumption
that reflects the oft-observed tendency to assume
communicators are truthful most of the time” (e.g.
Burgoon et al. 2008, p. 575). Accordingly, this
could possibly lead to the effect that an initial ut-

61



terance is first processed as being truthful, and re-
vised if an utterance contains counter-evidence to
this effect. Therefore, given that the truthful utter-
ances are more in line with default expectations of
an observer, it would become more easy to detect
the deceptive utterance as the more marked and
deviant case, if it is presented after the truthful
one.
