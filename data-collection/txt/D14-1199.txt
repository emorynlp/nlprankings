Abstract

The efficiency of Information Extraction
systems is known to be heavily influenced
by domain-specific knowledge but the cost
of developing such systems is consider-
ably high. In this article, we consider the
problem of event extraction and show that
learning word representations from unla-
beled domain-specific data and using them
for representing event roles enable to out-
perform previous state-of-the-art event ex-
traction models on the MUC-4 data set.

1 Introduction

In the Information Extraction (IE) field, event ex-
traction constitutes a challenging task. An event
is described by a set of participants (i.e. at-
tributes or roles) whose values are text excerpts.
The event extraction task is related to several sub-
tasks: event mention detection, candidate role-
filler extraction, relation extraction and event tem-
plate filling. The problem we address here is the
detection of role-filler candidates and their associ-
ation with specific roles in event templates. For
this task, IE systems adopt various ways of ex-
tracting patterns or generating rules based on the
surrounding context, local context and global con-
text (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009). Current ap-
proaches for learning such patterns include boot-
strapping techniques (Huang and Riloff, 2012a;
Yangarber et al., 2000), weakly supervised learn-
ing algorithms (Huang and Riloff, 2011; Sudo et
al., 2003; Surdeanu et al., 2006), fully supervised
learning approaches (Chieu et al., 2003; Freitag,
1998; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004; Patwardhan
and Riloff, 2009) and other variations. All these
methods rely on substantial amounts of manually
annotated corpora and use a large body of lin-
guistic knowledge. The performance of these ap-
proaches is related to the amount of knowledge

engineering deployed and a good choice of fea-
tures and classifiers. Furthermore, the efficiency
of the system relies on the a priori knowledge of
the applicative domain (the nature of the events)
and it is generally difficult to apply a system on
a different domain with less annotated data with-
out reconsidering the design of the features used.
An important step forwards is TIERlight (Huang
and Riloff, 2012a) that targeted the minimization
of human supervision with a bootstrapping tech-
nique for event roles detection. Also, PIPER (Pat-
wardhan and Riloff, 2007; Patwardhan, 2010) dis-
tinguishes between relevant and irrelevant regions
and learns domain-relevant extraction patterns us-
ing a semantic affinity measure. Another possi-
ble approach for dealing with this problem is to
combine the use a restricted set of manually anno-
tated data with a much larger set of data extracted
in an unsupervised way from a corpus. This ap-
proach was experimented for relations in the con-
text of Open Information Extraction (Soderland et
al., 2010) but not for extracting events and their
participants to our knowledge.

In this paper, we propose to approach the task
of labeling text spans with event roles by auto-
matically learning relevant features that requires
limited prior knowledge, using a neural model to
induce semantic word representations (commonly
referred as word embeddings) in an unsupervised
fashion, as in (Bengio et al., 2006; Collobert and
Weston, 2008). We exploit these word embed-
dings as features for a supervised event role (mul-
ticlass) classifier. This type of approach has been
proved efficient for numerous tasks in natural lan-
guage processing, including named entity recog-
nition (Turian et al., 2010), semantic role label-
ing (Collobert et al., 2011), machine translation
(Schwenk and Koehn, 2008; Lambert et al., 2012),
word sense disambiguation (Bordes et al., 2012) or
sentiment analysis (Glorot et al., 2011; Socher et
al., 2011) but has never been used, to our knowl-

edge, for an event extraction task. Our goal is two-
fold: (1) to prove that using as only features word
vector representations makes the approach com-
petitive in the event extraction task; (2) to show
that these word representations are scalable and
robust when varying the size of the training data.
Focusing on the data provided in MUC-4 (Lehnert
et al., 1992), we prove the relevance of our ap-
proach by outperforming state-of-the-art methods,
in the same evaluation environment as in previous
works.

2 Approach

In this work, we approach the event extraction task
by learning word representations from a domain-
specific data set and by using these representa-
tions to identify the event roles. This idea relies
on the assumption that the different words used
for a given event role in the text share some se-
mantic properties, related to their context of use
and that these similarities can be captured by spe-
cific representations that can be automatically in-
duced from the text, in an unsupervised way. We
then propose to rely only on these word repre-
sentations to detect the event roles whereas, in
most works (Riloff, 1996; Patwardhan and Riloff,
2007; Huang and Riloff, 2012a; Huang and Riloff,
2012b), the role fillers are represented by a set
of different features (raw words, their parts-of-
speech, syntactic or semantic roles in the sen-
tence).

Furthermore, we propose two additional contri-
butions to the construction of the word representa-
tions. The first one is to exploit limited knowledge
about the event types (seed words) to improve the
learning procedure by better selecting the dictio-
nary. The second one is to use a max operation1 on
the word vector representations in order to build
noun phrase representations (since slot fillers are
generally noun phrases), which represents a better
way of aggregating the semantic information born
by the word representations.

2.1 Inducing Domain-Relevant Word
Representations

In order to induce the domain-specific word rep-
resentations, we project the words into a 50-
dimensional word space. We chose a single

1This max operation consists in taking, for each compo-
nent of the vector, the max value of this component for each
word vector representation.

layer neural network (NN) architecture that avoids
strongly engineered features, assumes little prior
knowledge about the task, but is powerful enough
to capture relevant domain information. Follow-
ing (Collobert et al., 2011), we use an NN which
learns to predict whether a given text sequence
(short word window) exists naturally in the consid-
ered domain. We represent an input sequence of n
words as 〈wi〉 = 〈wi−(n/2) . . . , wi, . . . wi+(n/2)〉.
The main idea is that each sequence of words in
the training set should receive a higher score than
a sequence in which one word is replaced with
a random one. We call the sequence with a ran-
dom word corrupted ( ¯〈wi〉) and denote as correct
(〈wi〉) all the sequences of words from the data
set. The goal of the training step is then to min-
imize the following loss function for a word wi
in the dictionary D: Cwi =

∑
wi∈D max(0, 1 −

g(〈wi〉)+g( ¯〈wi〉)), where g(·) is the scoring func-
tion given by the neural network. Further details
and evaluations of these embeddings can be found
in (Bengio et al., 2003; Bengio et al., 2006; Col-
lobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010). For
efficiency, words are fed to our architecture as in-
dices taken from a finite dictionary. Obviously,
a simple index does not carry much useful infor-
mation about the word. So, the first layer of our
network maps each of these word indices into a
feature vector, by a lookup table operation. Our
first contribution intervenes in the process of the
choosing the proper dictionary. (Bengio, 2009)
has shown that the order of the words in the dic-
tionary of the neural network is not indifferent to
the quality of the achieved representations: he pro-
posed to order the dictionary by frequency and se-
lect the words for the corrupted sequence accord-
ing to this order. In our case, the most frequent
words are not always the most relevant for the task
of event role detection. Since we want to have a
training more focused to the domain specific task,
we chose to order the dictionary by word relevance
to the domain. We accomplish this by considering
a limited number of seed words for each event type
that needs to be discovered in text (e.g. attack,
bombing, kidnapping, arson). We then rate with
higher values the words that are more similar to the
event types words, according to a given semantic
similarity, and we rank them accordingly. We use
the “Leacock Chodorow” similarity from Word-
net 3.0 (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998). Initial ex-
perimental results proved that using this domain-

1853



oriented order leads to better performance for the
task than the order by frequency.

2.2 Using Word Representations to Identify
Event Roles

After having generated for each word their vec-
tor representation, we use them as features for the
annotated data to classify event roles. However,
event role fillers are not generally single words but
noun phrases that can be, in some cases, identi-
fied as named entities. For identifying the event
roles, we therefore apply a two-step strategy. First,
we extract the noun chunks using SENNA2 parser
(Collobert et al., 2011; Collobert, 2011) and we
build a representation for these chunks defined as
the maximum, per column, of the vector represen-
tations of the words it contains. Second, we use
a statistical classifier to recognize the slot fillers,
using this representation as features. We chose
the extra-trees ensemble classifier (Geurts et al.,
2006), which is a meta estimator that fits a num-
ber of randomized decision trees (extra-trees) on
various sub-samples of the data set and use averag-
ing to improve the predictive accuracy and control
over-fitting.

3 Experiments and Results

3.1 Task Description

We conducted the experiments on the official
MUC-4 training corpus that consists of 1,700 doc-
uments and instantiated templates for each doc-
ument. The task consists in extracting informa-
tion about terrorist events in Latin America from
news articles. We classically considered the fol-
lowing 4 types of events: attack, bombing, kid-
napping and arson. These are represented by tem-
plates containing various slots for each piece of
information that should be extracted from the doc-
ument (perpetrators, human targets, physical tar-
gets, etc). Following previous works (Huang and
Riloff, 2011; Huang and Riloff, 2012a), we only
consider the “String Slots” in this work (other slots
need different treatments) and we group certain
slots to finally consider the five slot types PerpInd
(individual perpetrator), PerpOrg (organizational
perpetrator), Target (physical target), Victim (hu-
man target name or description) and Weapon (in-
strument id or type). We used 1,300 documents
(DEV) for training, 200 documents (TST1+TST2)

2Code and resources can be found at http://ml.
nec-labs.com/senna/

for tuning, and 200 documents (TST3+TST4) as
the blind test set. To compare with similar works,
we do not evaluate the template construction and
only focus on the identification of the slot fillers:
for each answer key in a reference template, we
check if we find it correctly with our extraction
method, using head noun matching (e.g., the vic-
tim her mother Martha Lopez Orozco de Lopez is
considered to match Matha Lopez), and merging
duplicate extractions (so that different extracted
slot fillers sharing the same head noun are counted
only once). We also took into account the answer
keys with multiple values in the reference, deal-
ing with conjunctions (when several victims are
named, we need to find all of them) and disjunc-
tions (when several names for the same organiza-
tion are possible, we need to find any of them).
Our results are reported as Precision/Recall/F1-
score for each event role separately and averaged
on all roles.

3.2 Experiments

In all the experiments involving our model, we es-
tablished the following stable choices of parame-
ters: 50-dimensional vectors obtained by training
on sequences of 5 words, which is consistent with
previous studies (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert
and Weston, 2008). All the hyper-parameters of
our model (e.g. learning rate, size of the hidden
layer, size of the word vectors) have been chosen
by finetuning our event extraction system on the
TST1+TST2 data set. For DRVR-50 and W2V-50,
the embeddings were built from the whole training
corpus (1,300 documents) and the dictionary was
made of all the words of this corpus under their
inflected form.

We used the extra-trees ensemble classifier im-
plemented in (Pedregosa et al., 2011), with hyper-
parameters optimized on the validation data: for-
est of 500 trees and the maximum number of
features to consider when looking for the best
split is

√
number features. We present a 3-

fold evaluation: first, we compare our system with
state-of-the-art systems on the same task, then we
compare our domain-relevant vector representa-
tions (DRVR-50) to more generic word embed-
dings (C&W50, HLBL-50)3 and finally to another

role labeling on “String Slots” without using any
additional hand-engineered features. Moreover,
our representations (DRVR-50) clearly surpass the
models based on generic embeddings (C&W-50
and HLBL-50) and obtain better results than W2V-
50, based the competitive model of (Mikolov et
al., 2013a), even if the difference is small. We
can also note that the performance of our model
is good even with a small amount of training data,
which makes it a good candidate to easily develop
an event extraction system on a new domain.

Table 1 provides a more detailed analysis of the
comparative results. We can see in this table that
our results surpass those of previous systems (0.73
vs. 0.59) with, particularly, a consistently higher
precision on all roles, whereas recall is smaller for
certain roles (Target and Weapon). To further ex-
plore the impact of these representations, we com-
pared our word embeddings with other word em-
beddings (C&W-50, HLBL-50) and report the re-
sults in Figure 1 and Table 1. The results show
that our model also outperforms the models using
others word embeddings (F1-score of 0.73 against
0.65, 0.66). This proves that a model learned
on a domain-specific data set does indeed pro-
vide better results, even if its size is much smaller
(whereas it is usually considered that neural mod-
els require often important training data). Finally,
we also achieve slightly better results than W2V-50
with other word representations built on the same
corpus, which shows that the choices made for the
word representation construction, such as the use
of domain information for word ordering, tend to
have a positive impact.

4 Conclusions and Perspectives

We presented in this paper a new approach for
event extraction by reducing the features to only
use unsupervised word representations and a small
set of seed words. The word embeddings induced
from a domain-specific corpus bring improvement
over state-of-art models on the standard MUC-
4 corpus and demonstrate a good scalability on
different sizes of training data sets. Therefore,
our proposal offers a promising path towards eas-
ier and faster domain adaptation. We also prove
that using a domain-specific corpus leads to bet-
ter word vector representations for this task than
using other publicly-available word embeddings
(even if they are induced from a larger corpus).

As future work, we will reconsider the archi-
tecture of the neural network and we will refo-
cus on creating a deep learning model while tak-
ing advantage of a larger set of types of infor-
mation such as syntactic information, following
(Levy and Goldberg, 2014), or semantic informa-
tion, following (Yu and Dredze, 2014).
