Abstract

This paper examines the problem of adapt-
ing neural machine translation systems to new,
low-resourced languages (LRLs) as effectively
and rapidly as possible. We propose meth-
ods based on starting with massively multi-
lingual “seed models”, which can be trained
ahead-of-time, and then continuing training on
data related to the LRL. We contrast a num-
ber of strategies, leading to a novel, simple,
yet effective method of “similar-language reg-
ularization”, where we jointly train on both a
LRL of interest and a similar high-resourced
language to prevent over-fitting to small LRL
data. Experiments demonstrate that massively
multilingual models, even without any explicit
adaptation, are surprisingly effective, achiev-
ing BLEU scores of up to 15.5 with no data
from the LRL, and that the proposed similar-
language regularization method improves over
other adaptation methods by 1.7 BLEU points
average over 4 LRL settings.1

1 Introduction

When disaster strikes, news and social media are
invaluable sources of information, allowing hu-
manitarian organizations to rapidly mitigate crisis
situations and save lives (Vieweg et al., 2010; Neu-
big et al., 2011; Starbird et al., 2012). However,
language barriers looms large over these efforts,
especially when disasters occur in parts of the
world that use less common languages. In these
cases, machine translation (MT) technology can
be a valuable tool, with one widely-heralded suc-
cess story being the deployment of Haitian Creole-
to-English translation systems during the earth-
quakes in Haiti (Lewis, 2010; Munro, 2010).

However, data-driven MT systems, particularly
neural machine translation (NMT; Kalchbrenner

and Blunsom (2013); Bahdanau et al. (2015)), re-
quire large amounts of training data, and creating
high-quality systems in low-resource languages
(LRLs) is a difficult challenge where research ef-
forts have just begun (Gu et al., 2018). Another
hurdle, which to our knowledge has not been cov-
ered in previous research, is the time it takes to
create such a system. In a crisis situation, time
is of the essence, and systems that require days or
weeks of training will not be desirable or even fea-
sible.

In this paper we focus on the question: how can
we create MT systems for new language pairs as
accurately as possible, and as quickly as possible?
To examine this question we propose NMT meth-
ods at the intersection of cross-lingual transfer
learning (Zoph et al., 2016) and multilingual train-
ing (Johnson et al., 2016), two paradigms that, to
our knowledge, have not been used together in pre-
vious work. Our methods, laid out in §2 follow the
process of training a seed model on a large num-
ber of languages, then fine-tuning the model to im-
prove its performance on the language of interest.
We propose a novel method of similar-language
regularization (SLR) where training data from a
second similar languages is used to help prevent
over-fitting to the small LRL dataset.

In the experiments in §3, we attempt to answer
two questions: (1) Which method of creating mul-
tilingual systems and adapting them to an LRL is
the most effective way to increase accuracy? (2)
How can we create the strongest system possible
with a bare minimum of training time? The re-
sults are sometimes surprising – we first find that
a single monolithic model trained on 57 languages
can achieve BLEU scores as high as 15.5 with no
training data in the new source language whatso-
ever. In addition, the proposed method starting
with a universal model then fine-tuning with the
SLR proves most effective, achieving gains of 1.7

BLEU points averaged over several language pairs
compared to previous methods adapting to only
the LRL.

2 Training Paradigms

In this paper, we consider the setting where we
have a source LRL of interest, and we want to
translate into English.2 All of our adaptation
methods are based on first training on larger data
including other languages, then fine-tuning the
model to be specifically tailored to the LRL. We
first discuss a few multilingual training paradigms
from previous literature (§2.1), then discuss our
proposed adaptation methods (§2.2).

2.1 Multilingual Modeling Methods

We use three varieties of multilingual training:
Single-source modeling (“Sing.”) is the first
method, using only parallel data between the LRL
of interest and English. This method is straightfor-
ward and the resulting model will be most highly
tailored to the final test language pair, but the
method also has the obvious disadvantage that
training data is very sparse.
Bi-source modeling (“Bi”) trains an MT system
with two source languages: one LRL that we
would like to translate from, and a second highly
related high-resource language (HRL): the helper
source language.3 This method is inspired by
Johnson et al. (2016), who examine multilingual
translation models to/from English and two highly
related languages such as Spanish/Portuguese or
Japanese/Korean. The advantage of this method is
that it allows the LRL to learn from a highly simi-
lar helper, potentially increasing accuracy.
All-source modeling (“All”) trains not only on a
couple source languages, but instead creates a uni-
versal model on all of the languages that we have
at our disposal. In our experiments (§3.1) this en-
tails training systems on 58 source languages, to
our knowledge the largest reported in NMT exper-
iments.4 This paradigm allows us to train a single

2Translation into LRLs, is a challenging and interesting
problem in it’s own right, but beyond the scope of the paper.

3“Related” could mean different things: typologically re-
lated or having high lexical overlap. In our experiments our
LRLs are all selected to have an helper that is highly similar
in both aspects, but choosing an appropriate helper when this
is not the case is an interesting problem for future work.

4In contrast to Gu et al. (2018), who train on 10 languages.
Malaviya et al. (2017); Tiedemann (2018) train NMT on over
1,000 languages, but only as a feature extractor for down-
stream tasks; MT accuracy itself is not evaluated.

model that has wide coverage of vocabulary and
syntax of a large number of languages, but also
has the drawback in that a single model must be
able to express information about all the languages
in the training set within its limited parameter bud-
get. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that this model
may achieve worse accuracy than a model created
specifically to handle a particular source language.

In the following, we will consider adaptation
methods that focus on tailoring a more general
model (i.e. bi-source or universal) to a more spe-
cific model (i.e. single-source or bi-source).

2.2 Adaptation to New Languages

As noted in the introduction, there are two major
requirements: the accuracy of the system is im-
portant and the training time required from when
we learn of a need for translation to when we can
first start producing adequate results. Throughout
the discussion, we will compare various adapta-
tion paradigms with respect to these two aspects.

2.2.1 Adaptation by Fine-tuning
Our first adaptation method, inspired by Zoph
et al. (2016) is based on fine-tuning to the source
language of interest. Within our experiments, we
will test this setting, but also make two distinctions
between the types of adaptation:
Seed Model Variety: Zoph et al. (2016) per-
formed experiments taking a bilingual system
trained on a different language (e.g. French) and
adapting it to a new LRL (e.g. Uzbek). We can
also take universal model and adapt it to the new
language, a setting that we examine (to our knowl-
edge, for the first time) in this work.
Warm vs. Cold Start: Another contrast is
whether we have training data for the LRL of inter-
est while training the original system, or whether
we only receive training data after the original
model has already been trained. We call the former
warm start, and the latter cold start. Intuitively,
we expect warm-start training to perform better,
as having access to the LRL of interest during the
training of the original model will ensure that it
can handle the LRL to some extent. However, the
cold-start scenario is also of interest: we may want
to spend large amounts of time training a strong
model, then quickly adapt to a new language that
we have never seen before in our training data as
data becomes available. For the cold-start models,
we start with a model that is only trained on the
HRL similar to the LRL (Bi−), or a model trained

2.2.2 Similar-Language Regularization
One problem with adapting to a small amount of
data in the target language is that it will be very
easy for the model to over-fit to the small train-
ing set. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
method of similar language regularization: while
training to adapt to the language of interest, we
also add some data from another similar HRL
that has sufficient resources to help prevent over-
fitting. We do this in two ways:
Corpus Concatenation: Simply concatenate the
data from the two corpora, so that we have a small
amount of data in the LRL, and a large amount of
data in the similar HRL.
Balanced Sampling: Every time we select a mini-
batch to do training, we either sample it from the
LRL, or from the HRL according to a fixed ra-
tio. We try different sampling strategies, includ-
ing sampling with a 1-to-1 ratio, 1-to-2 ratio, and
1-to-4 ratio for the LRL and HRL respectively.

3 Experiments

3.1 Experimental Setup

We perform experiments on the 58-language-to-
English TED corpus (Qi et al., 2018), which is
ideal for our purposes because it has a wide variety
of languages over several language families, some
high-resourced and some low-resourced. Like
Qi et al. (2018), we experiment with Azerbaijani
(aze), Belarusian (bel), and Galician (glg) to En-
glish, and also additionally add Slovak (slk), a
slightly higher resourced language, for contrast.
These languages are all paired with a similar HRL:
Turkish (tur), Russian (rus), Portuguese (por), and
Czech (ces) respectively. Data sizes are shown in
Table 1.

Models are implemented using xnmt (Neu-
big et al., 2018), commit 8173b1f, and start
with the recipe for training on IWSLT TED5. The
model consists of an attentional neural machine
translation model (Bahdanau et al., 2015), using
bi-directional LSTM encoders, 128-dimensional

5Found in examples/stanford-iwslt/

word embeddings, 512-dimensional hidden states,
and a standard LSTM-based decoder.

Following standard practice (Sennrich et al.,
2016; Denkowski and Neubig, 2017), we break
low-frequency words into subwords using the
sentencepiece toolkit.6 There are two alter-
natives for creating subword units: jointly learning
subwords over all source language, or separately
learning subwords for each source language, then
taking the union of all the subword vocabularies as
the vocabulary for the multilingual model. Previ-
ous work on multilingual training has preferred the
former (Nguyen and Chiang, 2017), but in this pa-
per we use the latter for two reasons: (1) because
data in the LRL will not affect the subword units
from the other languages, in the cold-start sce-
nario we can postpone creation of subword units
for the LRL until directly before we start train-
ing on the LRL itself, and (2) we need not be
concerned with the LRL being “overwhelmed” by
the higher-resourced languages when calculating
statistics used in the creation of subword units, be-
cause all languages get an equal share.7 In the ex-
periments, we use a subword vocabulary of 8,000
for each language.

We also compare with two additional baselines:
phrase-based MT implemented in Moses,8 and
unsupervised NMT implemented in undreamt.9

Moses is trained on the bilingual data only (train-
ing multilingually reduced average accuracy), and
undreamt is trained on all monolingual data
available for the LRL and English.

3.2 Experimental Results
Table 2 shows our main translation results, with
warm-start scenarios in the upper half and cold-
start scenarios in the lower half.

Does Multilingual Training Help? To answer
this question, we can compare the warm-start
Sing., Bi, and All settings, and find that the an-
swer is a resounding yes, gains of 7-13 BLEU
points are obtained by going from single-source
to bi-source or all-source training, corroborating
previous work (Gu et al., 2018). Bi-source mod-
els tend to perform slightly better than all-source
models, indicating that given identical parameter

capacity, training on a highly resourced language
is effective. Comparing with the phrase-based
baseline, as noted by Koehn and Knowles (2017)
NMT tends to underperform on low-resource set-
tings when trained only on the data available for
these languages. However, multilingual training
of any variety quickly remedies this issue; all out-
perform phrase-based handily.

More interestingly, examining the cold-start re-
sults, we can see that even systems with no data
in the target language are able to achieve non-
trivial accuracies, up to 15.5 BLEU on glg-eng.
Interestingly, in the cold-start scenario, the All−

model bests the Bi− model, indicating that mas-
sively multilingual training is more useful in this
setting. In contrast, the unsupervised NMT model
struggles, achieving a BLEU score of around 0 for
all language pairs – this is because unsupervised
NMT requires high-quality monolingual embed-
dings from the same distribution, which can be
trained easily in English, but are not available in
the low-resource languages we are considering.

Does Adaptation Help? Regarding adaptation,
we can first observe that regardless of the origi-
nal model and method for adaptation, adaptation
is helpful, particularly (and unsurprisingly) in the
cold-start case. When adapting directly to only
the target language (“→Sing.”), adapting from the
massively multilingual model performs better, in-
dicating that information about all input languages
is better than just a single language. Next, compar-
ing with our proposed method of adding similar

language regularization (“→Bi”), we can see that
this helps significantly over adapting directly to
the LRL, particularly in the cold-start case where
we can observe gains of up to 1.7 BLEU points.
Finally, in our data setting, corpus concatenation
outperforms balanced sampling in both the cold-
start and warm-start scenarios.
How Can We Adapt Most Efficiently? Finally,
we revisit adapting to new languages efficiently,
with Figure 1 showing BLEU vs. hours training
for the aze/tur and bel/rus source language pairs
(others were similar). We can see that in all cases
the cold-start models (All− →) either outperform
or are comparable in final accuracy to the from-
scratch single-source and bi-source models. In ad-
dition, all of the adapted models converge faster
than the bi-source from-scratch trained models, in-
dicating that adapting from seed models is a good
strategy for rapid construction of MT systems in
new languages. Comparing the cold-start adap-
tation strategies, we can see that in general, the
higher the density of target language training data,
the faster the training converges to a solution, but
the worse the final solution is. This suggests that
there is a speed/accuracy tradeoff in the amount
of similar language regularization we apply dur-
ing fine-tuning.

4 Related Work

While adapting MT systems to new languages
is a long-standing challenge (Schultz and Black,
2006; Jabaian et al., 2013), multilingual NMT is
highly promising in its ability to abstract across



879

language boundaries (Firat et al., 2016; Ha et al.,
2016; Johnson et al., 2016). Results on multi-
lingual training for low-resource translation (Gu
et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2018) further demonstrates
this potential, although these works do not con-
sider adaptation to new languages, the main focus
of our work. Notably, we did not examine par-
tial freezing of parameters, another method proven
useful for cross-lingual adaptation (Zoph et al.,
2016); this is orthogonal to our multi-lingual train-
ing approach but the two methods could poten-
tially be combined. Finally, unsupervised NMT
approaches (Artetxe et al., 2017; Lample et al.,
2018, 2017) require no parallel data, but rest on
strong assumptions about high-quality comparable
monolingual data. As we show, when this assump-
tion breaks down these methods fail to function,
while our cold-start methods achieve non-trivial
accuracies even with no monolingual data.

5 Conclusion

This paper examined methods to rapidly adapt MT
systems to new languages by fine-tuning. In both
warm-start and cold-start scenarios, the best re-
sults were obtained by adapting a pre-trained uni-
versal model to the low-resource language while
regularizing with similar languages.
