Abstract 

 

The Copiale cipher is a 105-page enciphered 

book dated 1866.  We describe the features of 

the book and the method by which we 

deciphered it. 

 

1. Features of the Text 
 

Figure 1 shows a portion of an enciphered book 

from the East Berlin Academy.  The book has 

the following features: 
 

 It is 105 pages long, containing about 
75,000 handwritten characters. 

 The handwriting is extremely neat. 

 Some characters are Roman letters (such 

as a and b), while others are abstract 

symbols (such as 1 and <).  Roman 

letters appear in both uppercase and 

lowercase forms. 

 Lines of text are both left- and right-
justified. 

 There are only a few author corrections. 

 There is no word spacing.   
 

There are no illustrations or chapter breaks, but 

the text has formatting: 
 

 Paragraphs are indented. 

 Some lines are centered. 
 

— 
*This material was presented as part of an invited 

talk at the 4
th

 Workshop on Building and Using 

Comparable Corpora (BUCC 2011). 

 

 

 Some sections of text contain a double-

quote mark (“) before each line. 

 Some lines end with full stop (.) or colon 

(:).  The colon (:) is also a frequent 

word-internal cipher letter. 

 Paragraphs and section titles always 
begin with Roman letters (in capitalized 

form). 
 

The only non-enciphered inscriptions in the 

book are “Philipp 1866” and “Copiales 3”, the 

latter of which we used to name the cipher. 

The book also contains preview 

fragments (“catchwords”) at the bottom of left-

hand pages.  Each catchword is a copy of the 

first few letters from the following (right-hand) 

page.  For example, in Figure 1, the short 

sequence 3A^ floats at the bottom of the left page, 

and the next page begins 3A^om!...  In early 

printing, catchwords were used to help printers 

validate the folding and stacking of pages. 

 

2. Transcription 

 

To get a machine-readable version of the text, 

we devised the transcription scheme in Figure 2.  

According to this scheme, the line  
 

        >Ojv-</E3CA=/^Ub2Gr@J 
 

is typed as:  
 

pi oh j v hd tri arr eh three c. ah  

ni arr lam uh b lip uu r o.. zs

Figure 1.  Two pages from the Copiale cipher.

The transcription uses easy-to-reach keyboard 

characters, so a transcriber can work without 

taking his/her eyes off the original document.   

There are approximately 90 cipher 

letters, including 26 unaccented Roman letters, 

a-z.  The letters c, h, m, n, p, r, s, and x have 

dotted forms (e.g., C), while the letter i also has 

an un-dotted form.  The letters m, n, r, and u 

have underlined variants (e.g., B), and the 

vowels have circumflexed variants (e.g., A).  The 

plain letter y does not appear unaccented until 

page 30, but it appears quite frequently with an 

umlaut (y).The four Roman letters d, g, n, and z 

appear in both plain (d, g, n, z) and fancy forms 

(L, K, Y, J).  Capitalized Roman letters are used 

to start paragraphs.  We transcribe these with A-

Z, though we down-case them before counting 

frequencies (Section 3).  Down-casing D, G, N, 

and Z is not trivial, due to the presence of both 

plain and fancy lowercase forms.   

The non-Roman characters are an 

eclectic mix of symbols, including some Greek 

letters.  Eight symbols are rendered larger than 

others in the text: 9, @, #, %, 2, *, ±, and ¬. 
We transcribed a total of 16 pages 

(10,840 letters).  We carried out our analysis on 

those pages, after stripping catchwords and 

down-casing all Roman letters. 
 

3.  Letter Frequencies and Contexts 
 

Figure 3 shows cipher letter frequencies.  The 

distribution is far from flat, the most frequent 

letter being ^ (occurring 412 times).  Here are 

the most common cipher digraphs (letter pairs) 

and trigraphs, with frequencies: 

? - 99  ? - ^ 47 

C : 66  C : G 23 

- ^ 49  Y ? - 22 

: G 48  y ? - 18

The full digraph counts reveal 

interesting patterns among groups of letters.  For 

example, letters with circumflexes (A, E, I, O, U) 

have behaviors in common: all five tend to be 

preceded by z and >, and all five tend to be 

followed by 3 and j.  To get a better handle on 

letter similarities, we automatically clustered the 

cipher letters based on their contexts.  The result 

is shown in Figure 4.  We did the clustering as 

follows.  For each distinct letter x, we created a

Figure 4.  Automatic clustering of cipher letters 

based on similarity of contexts. 

 

 

co-occurrence vector of length 90, to capture the 

distribution of letters than precede x.  For 

example, if x is preceded 12 times by >, 0 times 

by U, 4 times by y, 1 time by 6, etc, then its 

vector looks like this:  [12, 0, 4, 1, …].  For the 

same letter x, we created another vector that 

captures the distribution of letters than follow x, 

e.g., [0, 0, 7, 2, …].  Then we concatenated the 

two vectors to create v(x) = [12, 0, 4, 1, …, 0, 0, 

7, 2, …].  We deemed two letters a and b to be 

similar if the cosine distance between v(a) and 

v(b) is small, indicating that they appear in 

similar contexts.  We used the Scipy software 

(http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eads/cluster.html) to 

perform and plot a clustering that incrementally 

merges similar letters (and groups of letters) in a 

bottom-up fashion. 

The cluster diagram confirms that 

circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) behave 

similarly.  It also shows that the unaccented 

Roman letters form a natural grouping, as do 

underlined letters.  Merges that happen low in 

the cluster map indicate very high similarity, e.g., 

the group (y, !, Y). 

 

4. First Decipherment Approach 

 

Building on the self-similarity of Roman letters, 

our first theory was that the Roman letters carry 

all the information in the cipher, and that all 

other symbols are NULLs (meaningless tokens 

added after encipherment to confuse 

cryptanalysis).  If we remove all other symbols, 

the remaining Roman letters indeed follow a 

typical natural language distribution, with the 

most popular letter occurring 12% of the time, 

and the least popular letters occurring rarely. 

The revealed sequence of Roman letters 

is itself nonsensical, so we posited a simple 

substitution cipher.  We carried out automatic 

computer attacks against the revealed Roman-

letter sequence, first assuming German source, 

then English, then Latin, then forty other 

candidate European and non-European 

languages.  The attack method is given in 

[Knight et al, 2006].  That method automatically 

combines plaintext-language identification with 

decipherment.  Unfortunately, this failed, as no 

5



language identified itself as a more likely 

plaintext candidate than the others. 

We then gave up our theory regarding 

NULLs and posited a homophonic cipher, with 

each plaintext letter being encipherable by any 

of several distinct cipher letters.  While a well-

executed homophonic cipher will employ a flat 

letter frequency distribution, to confound 

analysis, we guessed that the Copiale cipher is 

not optimized in this regard.   

We confirmed that our computer attack 

does in fact work on a synthetic homophonic 

cipher, i.e., it correctly identifies the plaintext 

language, and yields a reasonable, if imperfect, 

decipherment.  We then loosed the same attack 

on the Copiale cipher.  Unfortunately, all 

resulting decipherments were nonsense, though 

there was a very slight numerical preference for 

German as a candidate plaintext language. 

 

5. Second Decipherment Approach 

 

We next decided to focus on German as the most 

likely plaintext language, for three reasons: 

 
 the book is located in Germany 

 the computer homophonic attack gave a very 
slight preference to German 

 the book ends with the inscription “Philipp 
1866”, using the German double-p spelling. 

 

Pursuing the homophonic theory, our thought 

was that all five circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, 

U), behaving similarly, might represent the same 

German letter.  But which German letter?  Since 

the circumflexed letters are preceded by z and >, 

the circumflexed letters would correspond to the 

German letter that often follows whatever z and > 
stand for.  But what do they, in turn, stand for? 

From German text, we built a digraph 

frequency table, whose the most striking 

characteristic is that C is almost always followed 

by H.  The German CH pair is similar to the 

English QU pair, but C is fairly frequent in 

German.  A similar digraph table for the cipher 

letters shows that ? is almost always followed by 

-.  So we posited our first two substitutions: ?=C 

and -=H.  We then looked for what typically 

precedes and follows CH in German, and what 

typically precedes and follows ?- in the cipher.  

For example, ?-^ is the most frequent cipher 

trigraph, while CHT is a common German 

trigraph.  We thus hypothesized the further 

substitution ^=T, and this led to a cascade of 

others.  We retracted any hypothesis that 

resulted in poor German digraphs and trigraphs, 

and in this way, we could make steady progress 

(Figure 5).   

The cluster map in Figure 4 was of great 

help.  For example, once we established a 

substitution like y=I, we could immediately add 

Y=I and !=I, because the three cipher letters 

behave so similarly.  In this way, we mapped all 

circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) to plaintext E.  

These leaps were frequently correct, and we 

soon had substitutions for over 50 cipher letters.  

Despite progress, some very frequent 

German trigraphs like SCH were still drastically 

under-represented in our decipherment.  Also, 

many cipher letters (including all unaccented 

Roman letters) still lacked substitution values.  

A fragment of the decipherment thus far looked 

like this (where “?” stands for an as-yet-

unmapped cipher letter): 

 
?GEHEIMER?UNTERLIST?VOR?DIE?GESELLE 

?ERDER?TITUL 

?CEREMONIE?DER?AUFNAHME 

 

On the last line, we recognized the two words 

CEREMONIE and DER separated by a cipher 

letter.  It became clear that the unaccented 

Roman letters serve as spaces in the cipher.  

Note that this is the opposite of our first 

decipherment approach (Section 4).  The non-

Roman letters are not NULLs -- they carry 

virtually all the information.  This also explains 

why paragraphs start with capitalized Roman 

letters, which look nice, but are meaningless. 

We next put our hypothesized 

decipherment into an automatic German-to-

English translator (www.freetranslation.com), 

where we observed that many plaintext words 

were still untranslatable.  For example, 

ABSCHNITL was not recognized as a 

translatable German word.  The final cipher 

letter for this word is colon (:), which we had 

mapped previously to L.  By replacing the final 

L in ABSCHNITL with various letters of the 

alphabet (A-Z), we hit on the recognized word

6



 
Figure 5.  Progress of decipherment.  The main grid shows plaintext (German) letters across the top and 

ciphertext letters down the left side.  The ciphertext letters are grouped into clusters.  To the right of the 

main grid are frequent German trigraphs (der, und, ein, …) and frequent cipher trigraphs (?-^, C:G, HC|, 

…), with the two columns being separated by hypothesized trigraph decipherments. 

 

ABSCHNITT (translated as “section”).  We then 

realized that the function of colon (:) is to double 

the previous consonant (whether it be T, L, F, or 

some other letter).  Old German writing uses a 

stroke with the same function. 

The cipher letter T was still unknown, 

appearing in partially deciphered words like 

TAFLNER, TNUPFTUCHS, and GESELLTAFLT.  

We tried substituting each of the letters A-Z for 

T, but this did not yield valid German.  However, 

we found GESELLSCHAFLT in a German 

dictionary, so we concluded that T stands for 

SCH.  This opened the door for other multi-

plaintext-letter substitutions. 

Finally, we brought full native-German 

expertise to bear, by taking hypothesized 

decipherments (hyp) and correcting them (corr): 

 
ey/t+Nc-ZKGQOF~PC|nMYC5]-3Cy/OnQZMEX”g6G 
hyp:  is  mache ebenfals wilhuhrlise  bewegunge

corr:  berühre mit der linchen hand dein  

 

This allowed us to virtually complete our table 

of substitutions (Figure 6).  Three cipher letters 

remained ambiguous:  

 [ could represent either SS or S 
 5 could represent either H or K 

 G could represent either EN or EM  

However, these three symbols are ambiguous 

only with respect to deciphering into modern 

German, not into old German, which used 

different spelling conventions.   

The only remaining undeciphered 

symbols were the large ones: 9, @, #, %, 2, *, 
±, and ¬.  These appear to be logograms, 
standing for the names of (doubly secret) people 

and organizations, as we see in this section: “the 

9 asks him whether he desires to be 2”. 
 

6.  Contents 

 

The book describes the initiation of “DER 

CANDIDAT” into a secret society, some 

functions of which are encoded with logograms.  

Appendix A contains our decipherment of the 

beginning of the manuscript. 

 
7.  Conclusion 

 

We described the Copiale cipher and its 

decipherment.  It remains to transcribe the rest 

of the manuscript and to do a careful translation.  

The document may contain further encoded 

information, and given the amount of work it 

represents, we believe there may be other 

documents using the same or similar schemes.
