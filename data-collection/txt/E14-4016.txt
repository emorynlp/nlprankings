Abstract

We present a fast algorithm of word seg-
mentation that scans an input sentence
in a deterministic manner just one time.
The algorithm is based on simple max-
imum matching which includes execu-
tion of fully lexicalized transformational
rules. Since the process of rule match-
ing is incorporated into dictionary lookup,
fast segmentation is achieved. We eval-
uated the proposed method on word seg-
mentation of Japanese. Experimental re-
sults show that our segmenter runs consid-
erably faster than the state-of-the-art sys-
tems and yields a practical accuracy when
a more accurate segmenter or an annotated
corpus is available.

1 Introduction

The aim of this study is to improve the speed
of word segmentation. Applications for many
Asian languages including Chinese and Japanese
require word segmentation. Such languages do not
have explicit word delimiters such as white spaces.
Word segmentation is often needed before every
task of fundamental text processing such as count-
ing words, searching for words, indexing docu-
ments, and extracting words. Therefore, the per-
formance of word segmentation is crucial for these
languages. Take for instance, information retrieval
(IR) systems for documents in Japanese. It typi-
cally uses a morphological analyzer1 to tokenize
the content of the documents. One of the most
time consuming tasks in IR systems is indexing,
which uses morphological analysis intensively.

Major approaches to Japanese morphological
analysis (MA) are based on methods of finding

1 Japanese has a conjugation system in morphology and
does not put white spaces between words. Therefore, we
have to do morphological analysis in order to segment a given
sentence into words and give an associated part-of-speech
(POS) tag to each word. In the main stream of the research
of Japanese language processing, morphological analysis has
meant to be a joint task of segmentation and POS tagging.

the best sequence of words along with their part-
of-speech tags using a dictionary where they use
the Viterbi search (e.g., (Nagata, 1994), (Kudo et
al., 2004)). However, computation cost of mod-
ern MA systems is mainly attributed to the Viterbi
search as Kaji et al. (2010) point out.

One of methods of improving the speed of MA
or word segmentation will be to avoid or reduce
the Viterbi search. We can avoid this by using
maximum matching in the case of word segmenta-
tion. Since there are many applications such as IR
and text classification, where part-of-speech tags
are not mandatory, in this paper we focus on word
segmentation and adopt maximum matching for it.
However, maximum matching for Japanese word
segmentation is rarely used these days because the
segmentation accuracy is not good enough and the
accuracy of MA is much higher. In this paper we
investigate to improve the accuracy of maximum-
matching based word segmentation while keeping
speedy processing.

2 Segmentation Algorithm

Our algorithm is basically based on maximum
matching, or longest matching (Nagata, 1997). Al-
though maximum matching is very simple and
easy to implement, a segmenter with this algo-
rithm is not sufficiently accurate. For the pur-
pose of improving the segmentation accuracy, sev-
eral methods that can be combined with maximum
matching have been examined. In previous studies
(Palmer, 1997; Hockenmaier and Brew, 1998), the
combination of maximum matching and character-
based transformational rules has been investigated
for Chinese. They have reported promising results
in terms of accuracy and have not mentioned the
running time of their methods, which might sup-
posedly be very slow because we have to scan an
input sentence many times to apply learned trans-
formational rules.

In order to avoid such heavy post processing,
we simplify the type of rules and incorporate the
process of applying rules into a single process of
maximum matching for dictionary lookup. We

Input: ci: sentence which is represented as a char-
acter sequence. N : the number of characters in a
given sentence. t: dictionary, the data structure of
which should be a trie. oj : map an ID j to a single
word or a sequence of words. hj : total length of
oj .
Function: Lookup(t, c, i, N ): search the dic-
tionary t for the substring c starting at the position
i up to N by using maximum matching. This re-
turns the ID of the entry in the dictionary t when it
matches and otherwise returns −1.

else

word in the sequence with a delimiter.
Otherwise print oj as a single token. }

maximum matching that incorporates execution of
transformational rules.

show in Figure 1 the pseudo code of the algorithm
of word segmentation using maximum matching,
where the combination of maximum matching and
execution of simplified transformational rules is
realized. If each of the data oj in Figure 1 is a sin-
gle token, the algorithm which is presented here is
identical with segmentation by maximum match-
ing.

We use the following types of transformational
rules: c0c1...cl−1cl → w0...wm where ci is a char-
acter and wj is a word (or morpheme). Below are
sample rules for Japanese word segmentation:

• はないか (ha-na-i-ka) → は (ha; topic-
marker)ない (na-i; “does not exist”) か (ka;

“or”) 2

• 大工学部 (dai-ko-gaku-bu) → 大 (dai; “uni-
versity”)工学部 (ko-gaku-bu; “the faculty of
engineering”)

Note that the form of the left hand side of the rule
is the sequence of characters, not the sequence of
words. Due to this simplification, we can combine
dictionary lookup by maximum matching with ex-
ecution of transformational rules and make them
into a single process. In other words, if we find
a sequence of characters of the left hand side of a
certain rule, then we write out the right hand side
of the rule immediately. This construction enables
us to naturally incorporate execution (or appli-
cation) of transformational rules into dictionary-
lookup, i.e., maximum matching.

Although the algorithm in Figure 1 does not
specify the algorithm or the implementation of
function Lookup(), a trie is suitable for the struc-
ture of the dictionary. It is known that an effi-
cient implementation of a trie is realized by using
a double-array structure (Aoe, 1989), which en-
ables us to look up a given key at the O(n) cost,
where n is the length of the key. In this case the
computation cost of the algorithm of Figure 1 is
O(n).

We can see in Figure 1 that the Viterbi search
is not executed and the average number of dictio-
nary lookups is fewer than the number of char-
acters of an input sentence because the average
length of words is longer than one. This contrasts
with Viterbi-based algorithms of word segmenta-
tion or morphological analysis that always require
dictionary lookup at each character position in a
sentence.

3 Learning Transformational Rules

3.1 Framework of Learning

The algorithm in Figure 1 can be combined with
rules learned from a reference corpus as well as
hand-crafted rules. We used here a modified ver-
sion of Brill’s error-driven transformation-based
learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) for rule learning.

In our system, an initial system is a word seg-
menter that uses maximum matching with a given

2 If we use simple maximum matching, i.e., with no trans-
formational rules, to segment the samples here, we will get
wrong segmentations as follows: はないか → はな (ha-na;
“flower”) いか (i-ka; “squid”), 大工学部 → 大工 (dai-ku;
“carpenter”)学部 (gaku-bu; “faculty”).

word list and words which occur in a given ref-
erence corpus (a training corpus). Our segmenter
treats an unknown word, which is not in the dictio-
nary, as a one-character word as shown in Figure 1.

3.2 Generating Candidate Rules

In order to generate candidate rules, first we
compare the output of the current system with
the reference corpus and extract the differences
(Tashiro et al., 1994) as rules that have the follow-
ing form: Lw′0w′1 · · ·w′n R → Lw0w1 · · ·wm R
where w′0w′1 · · ·w′n is a word sequence in the sys-
tem output and w0w1 · · ·wm is a word sequence
in the reference corpus and L is a word in the left
context and R is a word in the right context. After
this extraction process, we generate four lexical-
ized rules from each extracted rule by using the
templates defined in Table 1.

3.3 Learning Rules

In order to reduce huge computation when learn-
ing a rule at each iteration of TBL, we use some
heuristic strategy. The heuristic score h is defined
as: h = f ∗ (n + m) where f is a frequency of
the rule in question and n is the number of words
in w′0w′1 · · ·w′n and m is the number of words in
w0w1 · · ·wm. After sorting the generated rules as-
sociated with the score h, we apply each candidate
rule in decreasing order of h and compute the error
reduction. If we get positive reduction, we obtain
this rule and incorporate it into the current dictio-
nary and then proceed to the next iteration. If we
do not find any rules that reduce errors, we termi-
nate the learning process.

4 Experiments and Discussion

4.1 Corpora and an Initial Word List

In our experiments for Japanese we used the Kyoto
University Text Corpus Version 4 (we call it KC4)
(Kurohashi and Nagao, 2003), which includes
newspaper articles, and 470M Japanese sentences
(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006), which is com-
piled from the Web. For training, we used two
sets of the corpus. The first set is the articles on

January 1st through 8th (7,635 sentences) of KC4.
The second one is 320,000 sentences that are se-
lected from the 470M Web corpus. Note that the
Web corpus is not annotated and we use it after
word segmentation is given by JUMAN 6.0 (Kuro-
hashi and Kawahara, 2007). The test data is a set
of sentences in the articles on January 9th (1,220
sentences). The articles on January 10th were used
for development.

We used all the words in the dictionary of JU-
MAN 6.0 as an initial word list. The number of
the words in the dictionary is 542,061. They are
generated by removing the grammatical informa-
tion such as part-of-speech tags from the entries in
the original dictionary of JUMAN 6.0.

4.2 Results and Discussion

Segmentation Performance We used word
based F-measure and character-wise accuracy to
evaluate the segmentation performance.

Table 2 shows comparison of various systems
including ours. It is natural that since our sys-
tem uses only fully lexicalized rules and does not
use any generalized rules, it achieves a moderate
performance. However, by using the Web cor-
pus that contains 320,000 sentences, it yields an
F-measure of near 0.96, which is at the same level
as the F-measure of HMMs (baseline) in (Kudo et
al., 2004, Table 3). We will discuss how we can
improve it in a later section.

Segmentation Speed Table 3 shows comparison
of the segmentation speed of various systems for
320,000 sentences of the Web corpus. Since, in
general, such comparison is heavily dependent on
the implementation of the systems, we have to be
careful for drawing any conclusion. However, we
can see that our system, which does not use the
Viterbi search, achieved considerably higher pro-
cessing speed than other systems.

Further Improvement The method that we
have presented so far is based on lexicalized rules.
That is, we do not have any generalized rules. The
system does not recognize an unknown English
word as a single token because most of such words
are not in the dictionary and then are split into sin-
gle letters. Similarly, a number that does not ap-
pear in the training corpus is split into digits.

It is possible to improve the presented method
by incorporating relatively simple post-processing
that concatenates Arabic numerals, numerals in

kanji3, Latin characters, and katakana4 ones. This
type of post processing is commonly used in
Japanese morphological analysis. JUMAN and
MeCab have a similar mechanism and use it.

As an additional experiment, we incorporated
this post processing into our segmenter and mea-
sured the performance. The result is shown in Ta-
ble 4. The segmenter with the post processing
yields an F-measure of 0.9719 when it is trained
on the 320k Web corpus. We observed that the
performance gap between state-of-the-art systems
such as JUMAN and MeCab and ours becomes
smaller. Additional computation time was +10%

script. Kanji means Chinese characters.

It is mainly used to denote loan words and onomatopoeias.
Such type of words are very productive and are often un-
known words in Japanese language processing.

for the post processing and this means the seg-
menter with the post processing is still much faster
than other sophisticated MA systems. Many ap-
plications which have to process a huge amount of
documents would gain the benefits from our pro-
posed methods.

5 Related Work

The use of transformational rules for improving
word segmentation as well as morphological anal-
ysis is not new. It is found in previous work (Papa-
georgiou, 1994; Palmer, 1997; Hockenmaier and
Brew, 1998; Gao et al., 2004). However, their ap-
proaches require the Viterbi search and/or a heavy
post process such as cascaded transformation in
order to rewrite the output of the base segmenter.
This leads to slow execution and systems that in-
corporate such approaches have much higher cost
of computation than ours.

6 Conclusion

We have proposed a new combination of maxi-
mum matching and fully lexicalized transforma-
tional rules. The proposed method allows us to
carry out considerably faster word segmentation
with a practically reasonable accuracy. We have
evaluated the effectiveness of our method on cor-
pora in Japanese. The experimental results show
that we can combine our methods with either
an existing morphological analyzer or a human-
edited training corpus.
