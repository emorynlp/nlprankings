Abstract

In this paper we present the evaluation of
different features for multiligual and cross-
level semantic textual similarity. Three dif-
ferent types of features were used: lexical,
knowledge-based and corpus-based. The re-
sults obtained at the Semeval competition rank
our approaches above the average of the rest
of the teams highlighting the usefulness of the
features presented in this paper.

1 Introduction

Semantic textual similarity aims to capture whether
the meaning of two texts are similar. This concept
is somehow different from the textual similarity def-
inition itself, because in the latter we are only in-
terested in measuring the number of lexical com-
ponents that the two texts share. Therefore, tex-
tual similarity can range from exact semantic equiv-
alence to a complete unrelatedness pair of texts.

Finding the semantic similarity between a pair
of texts has become a big challenge for specialists
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), because it
has applications in some NLP task such as machine
translation, automatic construction of summaries,
authorship attribution, machine reading comprehen-
sion, information retrieval, among others, which
usually need a manner to calculate degrees of simi-
larity between two given texts.

Semantic textual similarity can be calculated us-
ing texts of different sizes, for example between, a
paragraph and a sentence, or a sentence and a phrase,
or a phrase and a word, or even a word and a sense.
When we consider this difference, we say the task is
called “Cross-Level Semantic Similarity”, but when
this distinction is not considered, then we call the
task just as “Semantic Textual Similarity”.

In this paper, we evaluate different features for de-
termining those that obtain the best performances for
calculating both, cross-level semantic similarity and
multilingual semantic textual similarity.

The remaining of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 presents the features used in both
experiments. Section 3 shows the manner we used
the features for determining the degree of seman-
tic textual similarity. Section 4, on the other hand,
shows the experiments we have carried out for de-
termining cross-level semantic similarity. Finally, in
Section 5 the conclusions and findings are given.

2 Description of Features

In this section we describe the different features used
for evaluation semantic textual similarity. Basically,
we have used three different types of features: lex-
ical, knowledge-based and corpus-based. The first
one, counts the frequency of ocurrence of lexical
features which include n-grams of characters, skip-
grams1, words and some lexical relationships such
as synonymy or hypernymy. Additionally, we have
used two other features: the Jaccard coefficient be-
tween the two text, expanding each term with a set of

1They are also known as disperse n-grams because they con-
sider to “skip” a certain number of characters.

synonyms taken from WordReference Carrillo et al.
(2012), and the cosine between the two texts repre-
sented each by a bag of character n-grams and skip-
grams. In this case, we did not applied any word
sense disambiguation system before expanding with
synonyms, a procedure that may be performed in a
further work.

The second set of features considers the following
six word similarity metrics offered by NLTK: Lea-
cock & Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998),
Lesk (Lesk, 1986), Wu & Palmer (Wu and Palmer,
1994), Resnik (Resnik, 1995), Lin (Lin, 1998), and
Jiang & Conrath2 (Jiang and Conrath, 1997). In
this case, we determine the similarity between two
texts as the maximum possible pair of words similar-
ity. The third set of features considers two corpus-
based measures, both based on Rada Mihalcea’s tex-
tual semantic similarity (Mihalcea et al., 2006). The
first one uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
(Turney, 2001) for calculating the similarity between
pairs of words, whereas the second one uses Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998)
(implemented in the R software environment for sta-
tistical computing) for that purpose. In particular,
the PMI and LSA values were obtained using a cor-
pus built on the basis of Europarl, Project-Gutenberg
and Open Office Thesaurus. A summary of these
features can be seen in Table 1.

3 Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity

This task aims to find the semantic textual similar-
ity between two texts written in the same language.
Two different languages were considered: English
and Spanish. The degree of semantic similarity
ranges from 0 to 5; the bigger this value, the best se-
mantic match between the two texts. For the experi-
ments we have used the training datasets provided at
2012, 2013 and 2014 Semeval competitions. These
datasets are completely described at the task descrip-
tion papers of these Semeval editions Agirre et al.
(2013, 2014).

In order to calculate the semantic textual simi-
larity for the English language, we have used all
the features mentioned at Section 2. We have con-
structed a single vector for each pair of texts of the
training corpus, thus resulting 6,627 vectors in total.

2Natural Language Toolkit of Python; http://www.nltk.org/

The resulting set of vectors fed a supervised classi-
fier, in particular, a logistic regression model3. This
approach has been named as BUAP-EN-run1. The
most representative results obtained at the competi-
tion for the English language can be seen in Table 2.
As can be seen, we outperformed the average result
in all the cases, except on the case that the OnWN
corpus was used.

In order to calculate the semantic textual similar-
ity for the Spanish language, we have submitted two
runs, the first one is a supervised approach which
constructs a regression model, similar that the one
constructed for the English language, but consider-
ing only the following features: character n-grams,
character skip-grams, and the cosine similarity of
bag of character n-grams and skip-grams. This ap-
proach was named BUAP-run1. Given that the num-
ber of Spanish samples was so small, we decided
to investigate the behaviour of training with English
and testing with Spanish language. It is quite inter-
esting that this approach obtained a relevant ranking
(17 from 22 runs), even if the type of features used
were naı̈ve.

The second approach submitted for determining
the semantic textual similarity for the Spanish lan-
guage is an unsupervised one. It uses the same fea-
tures of the supervised approach for Spanish, but
these features were used to create a representation
vector for each text (independently), so that we may
be able to calculate the similarity by means of the
cosine measure between the two vectors. The ap-
proach was named BUAP-run2.

The most representative results obtained at the
competition for the Spanish language can be seen
in Table 3. There we can see that our unsupervised
approach slightly outperformed the overall average,
but the supervised approach was below the overall
average, a fact that is expected since we have trained
using the English corpus and testing with the Span-
ish language. Despite this, it is quite interesting that
the result obtained with this supervised approach is
not so bad.

Due to space constraints, we did not reported the
complete set of results of the competition, however,
these results can be seen at the task 10 description

3We used the version of the logistic classifier implemented
in the the Weka toolkit

4 Cross-Level Semantic Similarity

This task aims to find semantic similarity between
a pair of texts of different length written in En-
glish language, actually each text belong to a dif-
ferent level of representation of language (para-

graph, sentence, phrase, word, and sense). Thus,
the pair of levels that were required to be compared
in order to determine their semantic similarity were:
paragraph-to-sentence, sentence-to-phrase, phrase-
to-word, and word-to-sense.

The task cross level similarity judgments are
based on five rating levels which goes from 0 to

151



4. The first (0) implies that the two items do not
mean the same thing and are not on the same topic,
whereas the last one (4) implies that the two items
have very similar meanings and the most important
ideas, concepts, or actions in the larger text are rep-
resented in the smaller text. The remaining rating
levels imply something in the middle.

For word-to-sense comparison, a sense is paired
with a word and the perceived meaning of the word
is modulated by virtue of the comparison with the
paired sense’s definition. For the experiments pre-
sented at the competition, a corpus of 2,000 pairs
of texts were provided for training and other 2,000
pairs for testing. This dataset considered 500 pairs
for each type of level of semantic similarity. The
complete description of this task together with the
dataset employed is given in the task description pa-
per Jurgens et al. (2014).

We submitted two supervised approaches, to this
task employing all the features presented at Section
2. The first approach simply constructs a single vec-
tor for each pair of training texts using the afore-
mentioned features. These vectors are introduced in
Weka for constructing a classification model based
on logistic regression. This approach was named
BUAP-run1.

We have observed that when comparing texts of
different length, there may be a high discrepancy
between those texts because a very small length in
the texts may difficult the process of determining the
semantic similarity. Therefore, we have proposed
to expand small text with the aim of having more
term useful in the process of calculating the degree
of semantic similarity. In particular, we have ex-
panded words for the phrase-to-word and word-to-
sense cases. The expansion has been done as fol-
lows. When we calculated the similarity between
phrases and words, we expanded the word compo-
nent with those related terms obtained by means of
the Related-Tags Service of Flickr. When we cal-
culated the semantic similarity between words and
senses, we expanded the word component with their
WordNet Synsets (none word sense disambiguation
method was employed). This second approach was
named BUAP-run2.

The most representative results for the cross-level
semantic similarity task (which include our results)
are shown in Table 4. There we can see that the fea-

tures obtained a good performance when we com-
puted the semantic similarity between paragraphs
and sentences, and when we calculated the simili-
raty between sentences to phrases. Actually, both
runs obtained exactly the same result, because the
main difference between these two runs is that the
second one expands the word/sense using the Re-
lated Tags of Flickr. However, the set of expansion
words did not work properly, in particular when cal-
culating the semantic similarity between phrases and
words. We consider that this behaviour is due to
the domain of the expansion set do not match with
the domain of the dataset to be evaluated. In the
case of expanding words for calculating the similar-
ity between words and senses, we obtained a slightly
better performance, but again, this values are not
sufficient to highly outperform the overall average.
As future work we consider to implement a self-
expansion technique for obtaining a set of related
terms by means of the same training corpus. This
technique has proved to be useful when the expan-
sion process is needed in restricted domains Pinto
et al. (2011).

5 Conclusions

This paper presents the results obtained by the
BUAP team at the Task 3 and 10 of SemEval 2014.
In both task we have used a set of similar features,
due to the aim of these two task are quite similar:
determining semantic similarity. Some special mod-
ifications has been done according to each task in
order to tackle some issues like the language or the
text length.

In general, the features evaluated performed well
over the two approaches, however, some issues arise
that let us know that we need to tune the approaches
presented here. For example, a better expansion set
is required in the case of the Task 3, and a great num-
ber of samples for the spanish samples of Task 10
will be required.
