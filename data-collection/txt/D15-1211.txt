Abstract

We propose a transition-based model for
joint word segmentation, POS tagging and
text normalization. Different from pre-
vious methods, the model can be trained
on standard text corpora, overcoming the
lack of annotated microblog corpora. To
evaluate our model, we develop an anno-
tated corpus based on microblogs. Exper-
imental results show that our joint model
can help improve the performance of word
segmentation on microblogs, giving an er-
ror reduction in segmentation accuracy of
12.02%, compared to the traditional ap-
proach.

1 Introduction

Microblogs, such as Twitter, SMS and Weibo, has
become an important research topic in NLP. Pre-
vious work has shown that off-the-shelf NLP tools
can perform poorly on microblogs (Foster et al.,
2011; Gimpel et al., 2011; Han and Baldwin,
2011). One of the major challenges for microblog
processing is the issue of informal words. For ex-
ample, “tmrw” has been frequently used in tweets
for “tomorrow”, causing OOV problems.

Text normalization has been introduced as
a pre-processing step for microblog processing,
which transforms informal words into their stan-
dard forms. Most work in the literature focuses
on English microblog normalization, treating it as
a noisy channel problem (Pennell and Liu, 2014;
Cook and Stevenson, 2009; Yang and Eisenstein,
2013) or a translation problem (Aw et al., 2006;
Contractor et al., 2010; Li and Liu, 2012; Zhang
et al., 2014c), and training models based on words.

Lack of annotated corpora, text normalization
is more challenging for Chinese. Unlike En-
glish, Chinese informal words are more difficult

∗corresponding author

to mechanically normalize for two main reasons.
First, Chinese does not have word delimiters.
Second, Chinese informal words manifest diver-
sity, such as abbreviations, neologisms, unconven-
tional spellings and phonetic substitutions. Intu-
itively, there is mutual dependency between Chi-
nese word segmentation and normalization, and
therefore two tasks should be solved jointly.

Wang and Kan (2013) proposed a joint model
to process word segmentation and informal word
detection. However, text normalization was not
included in the joint model. Kaji et al (2014)
proposed a joint model for word segmentation,
POS tagging and normalization for Japanese Mi-
croblogs, which was trained on a partially anno-
tated microblog corpus. Their method requires
special annotation for text normalization, which
can be expensive.

In this paper, we propose a joint model for Chi-
nese text normalization, word-segmentation and
POS tagging, which can be trained using standard
segmentation and POS tagging annotation, over-
coming the lack of an annotated corpus on Chi-
nese microblogs. Our model is based on Zhang
and Clark (2010), with an extended set of transi-
tion actions to handle joint normalization. In our
model, word segmentation and POS tagging are
based on normalized text transformed from infor-
mal text. Assuming that the majority of informal
words can be normalized into formal equivalents
(Han et al., 2012; Li and Yarowsky, 2008), we
seek standard forms of informal words from an au-
tomatically constructed normalization dictionary.

To evaluate our model, we developed an anno-
tated corpus of microblog texts. Results show that
our model achieves the best performances on three
tasks compared with several baseline systems.

2 Text Normalization

Text normalization is a relatively new research
topic. There are no precise definitions of a text

1837



normalization task that are widely accepted by
researchers. The task is generally divided into
three categories: lexical-level, sentence-level and
discourse-level normalization. In this paper we
focus on lexical-level normalization, which aims
to transform informal words into their standard
forms.

Lexical normalization can be regarded as a
spelling correction problem. However, researches
on spelling correction focus on typographic
and cognitive/orthographic errors (Kukich, 1992),
while text normalization focuses on lexical vari-
ants, such as phonetic substitutions, abbreviation
and paraphrases.

Unlike English, for which informal words are
detected according to whether they are out of vo-
cabulary, Chinese informal words manifest diver-
sity. Wang et al. (2013) divided informal words
into three types: phonetic substitutions, abbrevi-
ations and neologisms. Li and Yarowsky (2008)
classified them into four types: homophone, ab-
breviation, transliteration and others. Due to vari-
ant characteristics, they normalise informal words
by training a model per type, leading to increased
system complexity.

Research reveals that most lexical variants have
an unambiguous standard form (Han et al., 2012;
Li and Yarowsky, 2008). The validity of this as-
sumption is also empirically assessed on our cor-
pus annotation in Section 6.1. Based on this as-
sumption, we seek standard forms of informal
words from a constructed normalization dictio-
nary, avoiding diversity on informal words.

3 Joint Segmentation and Normalization

3.1 Transition-based Segmentation
We adapt the segmenter of Zhang and Clark
(2007) as our baseline segmenter. Given an input
sentence x, the baseline segmenter finds a segmen-
tation by maximizing:

F (x) = argmax
y�Gen(x)

Score(y) (1)

where Gen(x) denotes the set of all possible seg-
mentations for an input sentence.

Zhang and Clark (2007) proposed a graph-
based scoring model, with features based on com-
plete words and word sequences. We adapt their
method slightly, under a transition-based frame-
work (Zhang and Clark, 2011), which gives us a
consistent way of defining all models in this paper.

Stack Queue

S2 S1 S0 C1 Cn... ...

Figure 1: A state of transition-based model.

Here a transition model is defined as a quadruple
M = (C, T, W, Ct), where C is a state space, T
is a set of transitions, each of which is a function:
C → C, W is an input sentence c1... cn, Ct is a
set of terminal states. A model scores the output
by scoring the corresponding transition sequence.

As shown in Figure 1, a state is a tuple ST =
(S, Q), where S contains partially segmented se-
quences, and Q = (ci, ci+1, ..., cn) is the sequence
of input characters that have not been processed.
When the character ci is processing, the transition
system would operate one of two actions that are
defined as follows:

(1) APP(ci), removing ci from Q, and append-
ing it to the last (partial) word in S.

(2) SEP(ci), removing ci from Q, making the
last word in S as completed, and adding ci as a
new partial word.

Given the sentence “å\'J�(How
great work pressure is!)”, the sequences of ac-
tion “SEP(å), APP(\), SEP(), APP(),
SEP('), SEP(J), SEP(!)” can be used to ana-
lyze its structure.

3.2 Joint Segmentation and Normalization

Our SN model extends the transition-based seg-
mentation model. In addition to the actions APP
and SEP, the transition system also contains a
SEPS action, which substitutes an in formal word
on the top of S if it exists in the normalization dic-
tionary. Figure 2 gives a normalization transition
process for the sentence “å\-¨'J�(How
great work pressure is!)”. During processing the
character “'(big)”, the following actions can be
applied.

(1) APP(“'(big)”), appending “'(big)” to the
last word “-¨(yālı́, pear)” in the informal la-
beled sequence.

(2) SEP(“'(big)”), making the last word “-
¨(yālı́, pear)” in the informal labeled sequence as
a completed word, and adding “'(big)” as a new
partial word.

(3) SEPS(“'(big)”, “(yālı̀, pressure)”),
operating the action SEP(“'(big)”), and using

informal word “-¨(yālı́, pear)”.

Given the sentence “å\-¨'J�(How
great work pressure is!)”, the sequences of ac-
tion “SEP(å), APP(\), SEP(-), APP(¨),
SEPS(', ), SEP(J), SEP(!)” can be used
to analyze its structure.

Lexical substitution is based on a normalization
dictionary whose entries consist of <lexical vari-
ant, standard form> pairs. The output is a pair
of labeled sequences, containing the informal la-
beled sequence and the corresponding formal la-
beled sequence. To rank the candidates, both la-
beled sequences can be scored. However, lacking
annotated corpora on informal texts, we only use
the score of formal labeled sequence in our model.
The advantage is that we can train our model by
using standard corpus only, overcoming the lack
of annotated corpora on informal texts.

3.3 Training and Decoding

We apply the global training and beam-search de-
coding framework of Zhang and Clark (2011). An
agenda is used by the decoder to keep the N-best
states during the incremental process. Before de-
coding starts, the agenda is initialized with the ini-
tial state. When a character is processed, existing
states are removed from the agenda and extended
with all possible actions, and the N-best newly
generated states are put back onto the agenda. Af-
ter all states have been terminal, the highest-scored
state from the agenda is taken as the output.

Algorithm 1 shows pseudocode for the decoder.
ADDITEM adds a new item into the agenda, N-
BEST returns the N highest-scored items from the
agenda, and BEST returns the highest-scored item

from the agenda. GETNWORD returns a possible
standard form set of last word, seeking from nor-
malization dictionary. APP appends a character
to the last word in a state, SEP joins a character
as the start of a new word in a state, SEPS oper-
ates SEP and replaces the last word by a possible
standard form.

3.4 Features
In the experiments, we use the segmentation fea-
ture templates of Zhang and Clark (2011). These
features are effective for segmentation on formal
text. However, for text normalization, these fea-
tures contain insufficient information. Our exper-
iments show that by using Zhang and Clark’s fea-
tures, the F-Score on normalization is only 0.4207.

Prior work has shown that the language statis-
tic information is important for text normalization
(Wang et al., 2013; Li and Yarowsky, 2008; Kaji
and Kitsuregawa, 2014). As a result, we extract
language model features by using word-based lan-
guage model learned from a large quantity of stan-
dard texts. In particular, 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram
features are extracted. Every type of n-gram is di-
vided into ten probability ranges. For example, if
the probability of the word bigram: “ - '”
(high pressure) is in the 2nd range, the feature is
represented as “word-2-gram=2”.

In our experiments, language models are trained
on the Gigaword corpus1 with SRILM tools2. To
train a word-based language model, we segmented
the corpus using our re-implementation of Zhang
and Clark (2010). Results show that language
model information not only improves the perfor-

mance of text normalization, but also increases the
performance of word-segmentation.

4 Extension for Joint Segmentation,
Normalization and POS tagging

4.1 Joint Segmentation and POS Tagging

In order to reduce the error propagation of word
segmentation, joint models have been applied to
some NLP tasks, such as POS tagging (Zhang and
Clark, 2010; Kruengkrai et al., 2009) and Parsing
(Zhang et al., 2014a; Qian and Liu, 2012; Zhang
et al., 2014b).

We take the joint word segmentation and POS
tagging model of Zhang and Clark (2010) as the
joint baseline. It extends from transition-based
segmenter, adding POS arguments to the original
actions. In Figure 1, when the current character ci
is processing, the transition system for ST would
operate as follows :

(1) APP(ci), removing ci from Q, and append-
ing it to the last (partial) word in S with the same
POS tag, .

(2) SEP(ci, pos), removing ci from Q, making
the last word in S as completed, and adding ci as
a new partial word with a POS tag “pos”.

Given the sentence “å\'J�(How
great work pressure is!)”, the sequences of ac-
tion “SEP(å, NN), APP(\), SEP(, NN),
APP(), SEP(', VA), SEP(J, SP), SEP(!,
PU)” can be used to analyze its structure.

4.2 Joint Segmentation, Normalization and
POS Tagging

Our joint model extends the model of Zhang and
Clark (2010) by adding a SEPS action, which sub-
stitutes formal word for last word in S if exists in
the dictionary. On the other hand, it can also be
regarded as an extension of the joint segmentation
and normalization model, adding POS arguments
to the original actions.

Using the same example shown in Figure 2, the
following three actions can be applied for the char-
acter “'�big)”:

(1) APP(“'(big)”), appending “'(big)” to the
last word “-¨(yālı́, pear)” in the informal la-
beled sequence, which remain with the same POS
tag “NN”.

(2) SEP(“'(big)”, VA), making the last word
“-¨(yālı́, pear)” in the informal labeled se-
quence as a completed word and adding “'(big)”
as a new partial word with a POS tag “VA”.

and using the standard form “(yālı̀, pressure)”
for the informal word “-¨(yālı́, pear)”.

Given the sentence “å\-¨'J�(How
great work pressure is!)”, the sequences of ac-
tion “SEP(å, NN), APP(\), SEP(-, NN),
APP(¨), SEPS(', VA, ), SEP(J, SP),
SEP(!, PU)” can be used to analyze its structure.

We use the same training and decoding frame-
work as our joint segmentation, normalization and
POS tagging model, as described in section 3.3.

5 Construction of Normalization
Dictionary

Although large-scale normalization dictionaries
are difficult to obtain, informal/formal relations
could be extracted from large-scale web corpora
(Li and Yarowsky, 2008), and informal words are
mainly derived using fixed word-formation pat-
terns. In this paper, we adopt two methods to con-
struct a normalization dictionary.

The first method is to extract informal/formal
pairs from large-scale text. In general, many infor-
mal and formal words co-occur in the same texts
or similar contexts. We can find their relations
with text patterns. As shown in Table 1, the first
example follows the “formal_ðinformal” (“_
ð” means “is also referred to as”) definition pat-
tern, while the second example follows the pattern
“informal(formal)”. This gives us a reliable way to
seed and bootstrap a list of informal/formal pairs.

We use a bootstrapping algorithm to extract in-
formal/formal pairs from large-scale microblogs.
First, a small set of example relations are collected
manually. Second, using these relations as a seed
set, we extract the text patterns, with which we
identify more new relations from the data and aug-

ment them into the seed set. Table 2 shows the
initial text patterns extracted form the examples.
The procedure iterates until it cannot identify new
relations. There is much noise in the extracted
informal/formal pairs. We re-rank them using a
similarity-based classifier with weak supervision,
with the positive pairs being inserted into dictio-
nary.

The second method is to generate new infor-
mal/formal pairs using word-formation patterns
extracted from informal/formal pairs. Although
Chinese informal words manifest diversity, infor-
mal words are mainly derived using fixing word-
formation methods, such as compounds, phonetic
substitutions, abbreviations, acronym, reduplica-
tion. We can learn the pattern of informal word-
formation from informal/formal pairs. For exam-
ple, in informal/formal pair “ ¹¸(mèizhı̌, sis-
ter paper)/¹P(mèizı̌, sister)”, informal word “¹
¸(mèizhı̌, sister paper)” is builded from formal
word “¹P(mèizı̌, sister)” by the pattern “P→
¸”. Using this pattern, we can generate many new
informal/formal pairs, such as “I¸(hànzhı̌, man
paper)/IP(hànzı̌, man)”, “7¸(nánzhı̌, man pa-
per)/7P(nánzı̌, man)”, “Y¸(sūnzhı̌, grandson
paper)/ YP(sūnzı̌, grandson)”, in which the for-
mal words contain character “P”.

In the experiments, we constructed the nor-
malization dictionary consisting of 32,787 infor-
mal/formal word pairs in total. The dictionary
is used to tamper the formal training data for
the joint segmentation and normalization systems
with 25% of the formal words in the dictionary be-
ing replaced with their informal equivalents.

6 Experiments

6.1 Microblog Corpus Annotation

To evaluate our model, we develop a microblog
corpus. Our annotated corpus is collected from
Sina Weibo3, which is the largest microblogging
platform in China. More than 1,000,000 Chinese
posts are crawled using Sina Weibo API. Among
these, 4,000 posts were randomly selected. We
follow Wang et al. (2012) and apply rules to
preprocess the corpus’URLs, emoticons, “@user-
names�and Hashtags as pre-segmented words.
As a result, we obtain 2,000 sentences as a source
of the corpus.

Two human participants annotated the 2,000
sentences by using the tools we developed. The
tools can simultaneously annotate word bound-
aries, POS and text normalization. We used the
CTB scheme for word segmentation and POS
tagging. We divided informal words into three
types: Phonetic Substitutions, Abbreviation, Para-
phrases. In total, we annotated 1,129 informal
word-pairs in the 2,000 sentences, which con-
tained 658 different informal words.

Table 3 shows the frequency distribution and
annotation agreement over three types of informal
words in corpus. The Cohen’s kappa is 0.95 for
informal words annotation, which shows that it
is easy for humans to distinguish informal words,
and validates our assumption that informal word
generally has one formal word equivalent.

6.2 Settings and Measures

Our model is trained on the Chinese Treebank
(CTB) 74, which is a large, word segmented, POS
tagged and fully bracketed Chinese news corpus.
The annotated microblog corpus is randomly di-
vided into two parts: 1,000 sentences for develop-
ment and 1,000 sentences for test.

The standard F-measure is used to measure the

accuracies of word segmentation, POS tagging
and text normalization, where the accuracy is F
= 2PR/(P+R). In addition, we use recall rates to
evaluate the identification accuracies of formal, in-
formal and all words. The recall rate of formal
words N-R is defined as the percentage of gold
standard output formal words that are correctly
segmented, the recall rate of informal words I-R
is defined as the percentage of gold-standard out-
put informal words that are correctly segmented
and the recall rate of all words ALL-R is defined as
the percentage of gold standard output words that
are correctly segmented.

6.3 Joint Segmentation and Normalization

Our development set is used to decide the beam
size and the number of training iterations. The best
performances on the development set are obtained
when the beam size is set to 16 and the number of
iterations is set to 32.

Comparison with pipeline We investigate the
influence of the language model and analyze the
result compared to the baseline. Table 4 shows the
results on the development and test sets, where SN
model is joint model and S;N is pipeline model.
Our SN model performs better on segmentation
than pipeline S;N model, demonstrating the effec-
tiveness of normalization.

Table 5 shows the accuracies (i.e., recall rate)
of formal and informal word identification on the
development set. After normalization, the accu-
racy of informal word identification has a large
improvement, and the accuracy of formal word
identification also increases. This shows that for-
mal words can be better recognized when infor-
mal words are identified correctly. It demonstrates
that text normalization is effective for both infor-
mal words and formal words.

The effect of language model From Table 4,
we observe that the performances increase when
using language model features. Particularly, the

normalization accuracy improves more signifi-
cantly. It indicates that statistical language model
knowledge play an important role on text normal-
ization. Using language model features, our SN
model improves more in the segmentation F-Score
compared with the baseline system.

Furthermore, we also find that the language
model features are helpful to identifying the for-
mal words, as shown in Table 5. The identification
accuracy of informal words increases on the SN
model, while the accuracy decreases on the S;N
model. Due to the relatively low frequency of in-
formal words, they score lower on informal text by
using the language model information, resulting in
incorrect word segmentations. This illustrates that
our joint model is more suitable for microblogs
than the pipeline method.

6.4 Joint Segmentation, Normalization and
POS tagging

We compare the following models on word seg-
mentation, text normalization and POS tagging.

ST Our re-implementation of Zhang and
Clark(2010). We investigate how the joint model
contributes to improving accuracy of word seg-
mentation and POS tagging in microblog domain.

S;N;T It is a pipe-line method for segmentation,
normalization and POS tagging. The segmentation
model does not use the features of POS. The nor-
malization model uses segmentation information,
but not features of POS. The POS tagging model
does not need to segmentation.

SN;T It is another pipe-line method that first
performs segmentation and normalization, then
performs POS tagging. The SN model does not
use the features of POS, and the POS tagging
model does not need to segmentation.

SNT Our joint segmentation, normalization,
and POS tagging model.

6.4.1 Results
Table 6 shows the final results on the test set. Pre-
vious work has shown that the systems trained on
news data give poor accuracies of word segmen-
tation and POS tagging in the microblog domain.
As shown in Table 6,the F-Score of segmentation
and POS tagging is 0.902 and 0.8163 respectively
by using the Stanford segmenter and POS tagger.

Comparing ST and SNT, we find that text nor-
malization can enhance word segmentation and
POS tagging in the microblog. SNT achieved
larger improvements over the baseline with lan-
guage features, reducing segmentation errors by
12.02% and POS errors by 3.63%.

Another goal of the experiment is to illustrate
whether the three tasks benefit from each other.
Comparing SN;T to S;N;T shows that the perfor-
mance increases by join segmentation and normal-
ization. It indicates that segmentation and text
normalization benefit from each other. On other
hand, our SNT model yields better performance
than SN;T. It indicates that POS features are effec-
tive for segmentation and text normalization, and
hence three tasks benefit from each other.

The effect of the normalization dictionary
The dictionary plays an important role in our
model, which reduces the number of OOV words.
Intuitively, the performance is higher when the
coverage of dictionary is larger. In the experi-
ments, the coverage of our dictionary on the devel-
opment and tests are 45.8%,48.2% respectively.

To investigate the effect of the dictionary on
our model, we manually construct ten dictionar-
ies from our development data, with coverage be-
tween 10% and 100%. Figure 3 shows the F-
score curves of test set on segmentation and POS-
tagging for both SNT+lm and ST+lm model by
different dictionaries. With the coverage of the
dictionaries increasing from 10% to 100%, the
F-score generally increases. When the coverage
is greater than about 20%, the F-score for joint
model is higher than for the baseline model.

6.4.2 Error Analysis
We found two major categories of errors. Abbre-
viation is sometimes incorrectly normalised, es-
pecially an informal word mapping to more than
one formal word. For example, informal word “
v” mapped to “ývÏ” (American idol),
which consists of two words: “ý” (American)
and “ vÏ” (idol). However, our model cannot
normalise the word “v” in the experiment.

Another type of error is phonetic substitutions
of numbers, which are sometimes identified incor-
rectly. For example. “7456” is identified as a num-
ber in the experiments, but it means “�{�”
(I’m so angry). To settle this problem, it needs
more context information.

6.5 Results of Lexical Normalization

It is interesting to explore how well the joint model
can normalize informal words. We compare our
results with two existing systems on text normal-
ization based on our annotated microblog corpus.

(1) WangDT We re-implement Wang et al.
(2013), which formalized the task as a classifica-
tion problem and proposed rule-based and statisti-
cal features to model three plausible channels that
explain the connection between formal and infor-
mal pairs. We use a single decision tree classifier

in the experiment.
(2) LYTop1 Li and Yarowsky (2008) formal-

ized the task as a ranking problem and proposed
a conditional log-linear model to normalization.
In the experiment, we select top 1 as the standard
form of informal word.

We use the same division with 1000 sentences
for training and 1000 for test. The training data is
used for both the WangDT and LY. We re-segment
the corpus using Stanford tools for the two base-
lines. WangDT uses CRF to detection informal
words and LYTop1 uses the informal words de-
tected using our joint model.

Although it is a little unfair for the two baselines
compared with our joint model, which uses the ex-
ternal knowledge - normalization dictionary. The
experiments can partly reflect some conclusions.
Table 7 shows the results of normalization by dif-
ferent systems. The performance of our model is
the best among the three systems. In particular,
the precision in our SNT model improves upon
the baselines significantly. The main reason is that
our model is based on global features over whole
sentences, while the two baselines based on local
windows features.

7 Related Work

There has much work on text normalization. The
task is generally treated as a noisy channel prob-
lem (Pennell and Liu, 2014; Cook and Steven-
son, 2009; Yang and Eisenstein, 2013; Sonmez
and Ozgur, 2014) or a translation problem (Aw
et al., 2006; Contractor et al., 2010; Li and Liu,
2012; Zhang et al., 2014c). For English, most
recent work (Han and Baldwin, 2011; Gouws et
al., 2011; Han et al., 2012) uses two-step unsuper-
vised approaches to first detect and then normalize
informal words. They aim to produce and use in-
formal/formal word lexicons and mappings.

In processing Chinese informal text, Wong and
Xia (2008) address the problem of informal words
in bulletin board system (BBS) chats by employ-
ing pattern matching. Xia et al. (2005) also use
SVM-based classification to recognize Chinese in-
formal sentences chats. Both methods have their

advantages: the learning-based method does bet-
ter on recall, while the pattern matching performs
better on precision.

Li and Yarowsky (2008) tackle the problem of
identifying informal/formal Chinese word pairs by
generating candidates from Baidu search engine
and ranking using a conditional log-linear model.
Zhang et al. (2014c) analyze the phenomena of
mixed text in Chinese microblogs, proposing a
two-stage method to normalise mixed texts. How-
ever, their models employ pipelined words seg-
mentation, resulting in reduced performance.

Wang and Kan (2013) propose a joint model to
process word segmentation and informal word de-
tection. However, text normalization is split to an-
other task (Wang et al., 2013). Our joint model
process word segmentation, POS tagging and nor-
malization simultaneously. Kaji et al. (2014)
propose a joint model for word segmentation,
POS tagging and normalization for Japanese Mi-
croblogs. Their model is trained on a partially an-
notated microblog corpus. In contrast, our model
can be trained on existing annotated corpora in
standard text.

Researchers have recently developed various
microblog corpora annotated with rich linguistic
information. Gimpel et al. (2011) and Foster et
al. (2011) annotate English microblog posts with
POS tags. Han and Baldwin (2011) release a mi-
croblog corpus annotated with normalized words.
Duan et al. (2012) develop a Chinese microblog
corpus annotated with segmentation for SIGHAN
bakeoff. Wang et al. (2013) release a Chinese mi-
croblog corpus for word segmentation and infor-
mal word detection. However, there are no mi-
croblog corpora annotated Chinese word segmen-
tation, POS tags, and normalized sentences.

Our work is alse related to the work of word
segmentation (Zhang and Clark, 2007; Zhang et
al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015) and joint word seg-
mentation and POS-tagging (Jiang et al., 2008;
Zhang and Clark, 2010). A comprehensive sur-
vey is out of the scope of this paper, but interested
readers can refer to Pei et al. (Pei et al., 2014) for
a recent literature review of the fields.

To evaluate our model, we develop an annotated
microblog corpus with word segmentation, POS
tags, and normalization. Furthermore, we train
our model by using a standard segmented and POS
tagged corpus. We also present a comprehensive
evaluation in terms of precision and recall on our

1844



microblog test corpus. Such an evaluation has not
been conducted in previous work due to the lack
of annotated corpora for Chinese microblogs.

8 Conclusion

We proposed a joint model of word segmentation,
POS tagging and normalization, in which the three
tasks benefit from each other. The model is trained
on standard corpora, hence there is no need to re-
train it for new microblog corpora. The results
demonstrated that the model can improve the per-
formance of word segmentation and POS tagging
with text normalization on microblogs, and our
model can benefit from the language statistical in-
formation, which is not suitable to segment word
and tag POS directly for microblogs because of the
relatively low frequency of informal words.

In our model, lexical substitution is based
on a normalization dictionary, which avoids
the diversity of informal words, simplifying
this problem for real world applications. The
codes of the joint model and data set are pub-
lished at the website: https://github.com/
qtxcm/JointModelNSP.
