Abstract

Event extraction is a popular research topic in natural language processing. Several event extrac-
tion tasks have been defined for both the newswire and biomedical domains. In general, different
systems have been developed for the two domains, despite the fact that the tasks in both domains
share a number of characteristics. In this paper, we analyse the commonalities and differences
between the tasks in the two domains. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate how an event
extraction method originally designed for the biomedical domain can be adapted for application
to the newswire domain. The performance is state-of-the-art for both domains, with F-scores of
52.7% for the biomedical domain and 52.1% for the newswire domain in terms of their primary
evaluation metrics.

1 Introduction

Research into event extraction was initially focussed on the general language domain, largely driven by
the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) series (e.g., Chinchor (1998)) and the Automated Con-
tent Extraction (ACE) evaluations1. More recently, the focus of research has been widened to the biomed-
ical domain, motivated by the ongoing series of biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) shared
tasks (STs) (e.g., Kim et al. (2013)).

Although the textual characteristics and the types of relevant events to be extracted can vary consid-
erably between domains, the same general features of events normally hold across domains. An event
usually consists of a trigger and arguments (see Figures 1 and 2.) A trigger is typically a verb or a nom-
inalised verb that denotes the presence of the event in the text, while the arguments are usually entities.
In general, arguments are assigned semantic roles that characterise their contribution towards the event
description.

Until now, however, there has been little, if any, effort by researchers working on event extraction in
different domains to share ideas and techniques, unlike syntactic tasks (e.g., (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008))
and other information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition (e.g., (Giuliano et al., 2006))
and relation extraction (e.g., (Qian and Zhou, 2012)). This means that the potential to exploit cross-
domain features of events to develop more adaptable event extraction systems is an under-studied area.
Consequently, although there is a large number of published studies on event extraction, proposing many
different methods, no work has previously been reported that aims to adapt an event extraction method
developed for one domain to a new domain.

In response to the above, we have investigated the feasibility of adapting an event extraction method
developed for the biomedical domain to the newswire domain. To facilitate this, we firstly carry out a
detailed static analysis of the differences that hold between event extraction tasks in the newswire and
biomedical domains. Specifically, we consider the ACE 2005 event extraction task (Walker et al., 2006)
for the newswire domain and the Genia Event Extraction task (GENIA) in BioNLP ST 2013 (Kim et al.,
2013) for the biomedical domain. Based on the results of this analysis, we adapt the biomedical event

extraction method to the task of extracting events in the newswire domain, according to the specification
of the ACE 2005 event extraction task. The original method consists of a classification pipeline that has
previously been applied to extract events according to task descriptions that are similar to GENIA. In
order to address the differences between this task and the ACE task, we have made a number of changes
to the original method, including modifications to the classification labels assigned, the pipeline itself
and the features used. We retrained the model of the adapted system on the ACE task, compared the
performance, and empirically analysed the differences between the two tasks in terms of entity-related
information. We demonstrate that the resulting system achieves state-of-the-art performance for tasks in
both domains.

2 Related Work

In this section, we introduce the two domain specific event extraction tasks on which we will focus, i.e.,
the ACE 2005 event extraction task, which concerns events in the newswire domain, and the GENIA
event task from the BioNLP ST 2013, which deals with biomedical event extraction. We also examine
state-of-the-art systems that have been developed to address each task.

2.1 Newswire Event Extraction

The extraction of events from news-related texts has been widely researched, largely due to motivation
from the various MUC and ACE shared tasks. Whilst MUC focussed on filling a single event template
on a single topic by gathering information from different parts of a document, ACE defined a more
comprehensive task, involving the recognition of multiple fine-grained and diverse types of entities and
associated intra-sentential events within each document.

A common approach to tackling the MUC template filling task has involved the employment of
pattern-based methods, e.g., Riloff (1996). In contrast, supervised learning approaches have constituted
a more popular means of approaching the ACE tasks2. In this paper, we choose to focus on adapting
our biomedical-focussed event extraction method to the ACE 2005 task. Our choice is based on the task
definition for ACE 2005 having more in common with the BioNLP 2013 GENIA ST definition than the
MUC event template task definition.

In terms of the characteristics of state-of-the-art event extraction systems designed according to the
ACE 2005 model, pipeline-based approaches have been popular (Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006).
Grishman et al. (2005) proposed a method that sequentially identifies textual spans of arguments, role
types, and event triggers. This pipeline approach has been further extended in several subsequent studies.
For example, Liao et al. (2010) investigated document-level cross-event consistency using co-occurrence
of events and event arguments, while Hong et al. (2011) exploited information gathered from the web to
ensure cross-entity consistency.

2Note that there are also approaches using few or no training data (e.g., (Ji and Grishman, 2008; Lu and Roth, 2012)) for
the ACE 2005 task, but they are not so many and we will focus on the supervised learning approaches in this paper.

2271



Li et al. (2013) recently proposed a joint detection method to detect both triggers and arguments
(together with their role types) using a structured perceptron model. The system outperformed the best
results reported for the ACE 2005 task in the literature, without the use of any external resources.

2.2 Biomedical Event Extraction

The task of event extraction has received a large amount of attention from BioNLP researchers in recent
years. Interest in this task was largely initiated by the BioNLP 2009 ST, and has been sustained through
the organisation of further STs in 2011 and 2013. The STs consist of a number of different sub-tasks, the
majority of which concern the extraction of events from biomedical papers from the PubMed database.
Events generally concern interactions between biomedical entities, such as proteins, cells and chemicals.

Similarly to newswire event extraction systems, pipeline-based methods have constituted a popular
approach to extracting events in the biomedical domain (Björne and Salakoski, 2013; Miwa et al., 2012).
The pipeline developed by Miwa et al. (2012) consists of a number of modules, which sequentially
detect event triggers, event arguments, event structures and hedges (i.e., speculations and negations).
The system has been applied to several event extraction tasks, and has achieved the best performance on
most of these, in comparison to other systems. It should be noted that the ordering of the components
in biomedical event extraction pipelines often differs from pipelines designed for news event extraction,
e.g., Grishman et al. (2005), which was described above.

As in newswire event detection, some joint (non pipeline-based) approaches have also been proposed
for biomedical event extraction. For example, McClosky et al. (2012) used a stacking model to combine
the results of applying two different methods to event extraction. The first method is a joint method,
similar to Li et al. (2013), that detects triggers, arguments and their roles. However, in contrast to
the structured perceptron employed in Li et al. (2013), McClosky et al. (2012) use a dual-decomposition
approach for the detection. The second method is based on dependency parsing and treats event structures
as dependency trees.

3 Adaptation of Biomedical Event Extraction to Newswire Event Extraction

In this section, we firstly analyse the differences between the domain-specific ACE 2005 and GENIA
event extraction tasks. Based on our findings, we propose an approach to adapting an existing event ex-
traction method, originally developed for biomedical event extraction, to the ACE 2005 task, by resolving
the observed differences between the two task definitions.

3.1 Differences in event extraction tasks

Both the ACE 2005 and GENIA tasks concern the task of event extraction, i.e., the identification of
relationships between entities. For both tasks, the requirement is to extract events from text that conform
to the general event description introduced earlier, i.e., a trigger and its arguments, each of which is
assigned a semantic role. Despite this high-level similarity between the tasks, their finer-grained details
diverge in a number of ways. Apart from the different textual domain, the tasks adopt varying annotation
schemes. The exact kinds of annotations provided at training time are also different, as are the evaluation
settings.

Several variants of the official task setting for the ACE 2005 corpus have been defined. This is partly
due to the demanding nature of the official task definition, which requires the detection of events from
scratch, including the recognition of named entities participating in events, together with the resolution
of coreferences. Alternative task settings (such as Ji and Grishman (2008); Liao and Grishman (2010)))
generally simplify the official task definition, e.g., by omitting the requirement to perform coreference
resolution. A further issue is that the test data sets for the official task setting have not been made publicly
available. As a result of the multiple existing variations of the ACE 2005 task definition that have been
employed by different research efforts, direct comparison of our results with those obtained by other
state-of-the art systems is problematic. The solution we have chosen is to adopt the same ACE 2005
event extraction task specification that has been adopted in recent research, by Hong et al. (2011) and Li
et al. (2013). For GENIA, we follow the specification of the original GENIA event extraction task.

Table 1: Comparison of event definitions and event extraction tasks. “Available annotations” are annota-
tions available in the corresponding corpus, while “Given annotations” are annotations provided during
(training and) prediction. “Given annotations” do not need to be predicted during event extraction.

Event annotation examples for ACE 2005 and GENIA are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
Table 1 summarises the following comparison between the two event extraction tasks.

Semantic types There are more event, role and entity types and a greater potential number of arguments
in ACE 2005 events than in GENIA events. There is also a hierarchy of event types and entity types
in ACE 2005. For example, the Life event type has Be-Born, Marry, Divorce, Injure, Die event
subtypes. Some GENIA event types can also be arranged to have a hierarchy but they are limited.
Events in ACE 2005 can take non-entity arguments, e.g., Time.

Nested events/Overlapping events Event structures are flat in ACE 2005, but they can be nested in
GENIA, i.e., an event can take other events as its arguments. Events in GENIA can also be over-
lapping, in the sense that a particular word or phrase can be a trigger for multiple events. Figure 2
illustrates both nesting and overlapping in GENIA events. These properties of GENIA events are
not addressed by methods developed for event extraction according to the ACE 2005 specification,
making direct application of these methods to the GENIA task impossible.

Links amongst arguments A specific feature of the GENIA event extraction task, which is completely
absent from the ACE 2005 task, is that links amongst arguments sometimes have to be identified.
For example, the Binding event type in the GENIA task can take the following argument role types:
Theme, Theme2, Site and Site2. The number 2 is attached to differentiate specific linkages between
arguments: Site is the location of Theme, while Site2 is the location of Theme2.

Entities, events and their attributes Entities in ACE 2005 have rich attributes associated with them.
For example, the Time entity type has an attribute to store a normalised temporal format (e.g., 2003-
03-04 for entities “20030304”, “March 4” and “Tuesday”) while the GPE (Geo-Political Entity)
type has attributes such as subtypes (e.g., Nation), mention type (proper name, common noun or
pronoun), roles (location of a group or person) and style (literal or metonymic). In contrast, GENIA
entities have no attributes3. In ACE 2005, all entities are provided (gold) in the training and test
data and they do not need to be predicted. In GENIA, some named entities (i.e., Proteins) are also
provided, but other types of named or non-named entities that can constitute event arguments, such
as locations and sites of proteins, are not provided in the test data and thus need to be predicted
as part of the extraction process. Events in both corpora also have associated attributes: modality,

polarity, genericity and tense in ACE 2005 and negation and speculation in GENIA. The GENIA
task definition requires event attributes to be predicted, but the ACE 2005 task definition does not.

Coreference Both entity and event coreference are annotated in ACE 2005, but only entity coreference is
annotated in GENIA. Events in ACE 2005 can take non-entity mentions, such as pronouns, as their
arguments. However, events in GENIA can take only entity mentions as arguments. Thus, instead
of non-entity mentions, coreferent entity mentions that are the closest to triggers are annotated as
arguments in GENIA. For example, in Figure 2, “p300” and “Foxp3” are annotated as Themes of
Gene expression events instead of “both proteins”.

Evaluation In ACE 2005, the accuracy of extracted events is evaluated at the level of individual ar-
guments and their roles. Completeness of events is not taken into consideration (Li et al., 2013),
presumably because each event can take many arguments. Evaluation is performed by taking into
account the 33 event subtypes, rather than the 8 coarser-grained event types. In contrast, evaluation
of events according to the GENIA specification considers only the correctness of complete events,
after nested events have been broken down.

In summary, the ACE 2005 task is in some respects more complex than the GENIA task, because it
concerns a greater number event types, whose arguments may constitute a greater range of entity types,
and whose semantic roles are drawn from a larger set, some of which are specific to particular event
types and entities. In other respects, the task is more straightforward than the GENIA task, because of
the simpler nature of the event structures in ACE 2005, i.e., there are no nested or overlapping event
structures.

3.2 Adaptation of event extraction method
Since event structures are simpler in ACE 2005 than GENIA, we choose to adapt a biomedical event
extraction method to the ACE 2005 task rather than the other way around. The inverse adaptation,
starting from a newswire event extraction method, is considered more complex, since we would need to
extend the method to capture the more complex event structures required in the GENIA task. It would
additionally be inappropriate to employ domain adaptation methods (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Pan
and Yang, 2010) to allow GENIA-trained models to be applied to the ACE 2005 tasks. This is because
such methods require that there is at least a certain degree of overlap between the target information
types, which is not the case in this scenario.

We employ the biomedical event extraction pipeline method described in Miwa et al. (2012) as our
starting point. Our motivation is that, due to their modular nature, pipeline approaches are often easier
to adapt to other task settings than joint approaches, e.g., (McClosky et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013).
In addition, the method has previously been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several
biomedical event extraction tasks (Miwa et al., 2012).

The pipeline consists of four detectors, i.e., trigger/entity, event role, event structure, and hedge de-
tectors. The trigger/entity detector finds triggers and entities in text. The event role detector determines
which triggers/entities constitute arguments of events, links them to the appropriate event trigger and as-
signs semantic roles to the arguments. The event structure detector merges trigger-argument pairs into all
possible complete event structures, and determines which of these structures constitute actual events. The
same detector determines links between arguments, such as Theme2 and Site2. The hedge detector finds
negation and speculation information associated with events. Each detector solves multi-label multi-
class classification problems using lexical and syntactic features obtained from multiple parsers. These
features include character n-grams, word n-grams, and shortest paths between triggers and participants
within parse structures. More detailed information can be found in Miwa et al. (2012).

We have updated the original method by simplifying the format of the classification labels used by
both the event role detector and event structure detector modules. We refer to this method as BioEE,
which we have applied to the GENIA task. We use only the role types (e.g., Theme) as classification
labels for instances in the event role detector, instead of the more complex labels used in the original
version of the module, which combined event types, roles and semantic entity types of arguments (e.g.,

2274



Binding:Theme-Protein). Similarly, in the event structure detector, we use only two labels (“EVENT”
or “NOT-EVENT”), instead of the previously used composite labels, which consisted of the event type,
together with the roles and semantic entity types of all arguments of the event (e.g., Regulation:Cause-
Protein:Theme-Protein.) We employed the simplified labels, since they increase the number of training
instances for each label. The use of such labels, compared to the more complex ones, could reduce the
potential of carrying out detailed modelling of specific aspects of the task. However, this was found not
to be an issue, since the use of the simplified labels improved the performance of the pipeline in detecting
events within the GENIA development data set (about 1% improvement in F-score). The simplification of
the set of classification labels was also vital to ensure the tractability of the classification problems within
the context of the ACE 2005 task. For example, using the same conventions to formulate classification
labels as in the original system would result in 345 possible labels (compared to 91 in GENIA) to be
predicted by the event role detector (and an even greater number of labels for the event structure detector),
based on event-role-semantic type combinations found in the ACE training/development sets.

In order to adapt the system to extract events according to the ACE 2005 specification, we modified
BioEE in several ways, making changes to both the pipeline itself and the features employed by the
different modules. We refer to this method as Adapted BioEE, and we applied this method to the ACE
2005 task. These changes were made in an attempt to address the two major differences between the
GENIA and ACE 2005 tasks, i.e., the simpler event structures and the availability of entity attribute and
coreference information in ACE.

The pipeline-based modifications consisted of removing certain modules from the original pipeline,
such that only two modules remained, i.e., the trigger/entity and event role detectors. The other two
modules of the original pipeline, i.e., the event structure and hedge detectors, were designed to deal with
problems that do not exist in the ACE 2005 extraction task, and thus their usage would be redundant.
Instead of using the event structure detector to piece the different elements of an event, we simply aggre-
gate all the arguments of the same trigger into a single event structure, after the event role detector has
been applied.

As mentioned above, the ACE 2005 task definition includes rich information about entities, including
attributes and coreference information. Existing systems developed to address this task have exploited
this information to generate rich feature sets for classification (Liao and Grishman, 2010; Li et al.,
2013). Based on the demonstrated utility of this information within the context of event extraction, we
also choose to use it, by adding binary feature that indicate the presence of base forms, entity subtypes,
and attributes of the entities and their coreferent entities to features in both detectors above. We choose
to use base forms, since surface forms of entities are not used by most biomedical event extraction
systems, including BioEE. We also add the features for Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) following Li
et al. (2013). Further details can be found in Li et al. (2013).

4 Evaluation

4.1 Evaluation settings

To assess the performance of Adapted BioEE on the ACE 2005 task, we followed the evaluation process
and settings used in previously reported studies (Hong et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013). ACE 2005 consists
of 599 documents. In order to facilitate direct comparison with other systems trained on the same data,
we conducted a blind test on the same 40 newswire documents that were used for evaluation in (Ji and
Grishman, 2008; Li et al., 2013), and used the remaining documents as training/development sets. We
use precision (P), recall (R) and F-score (F) to report the performance of the adapted system in classifying
triggers and argument roles. We use the latter F-score as our primary metric for comparing our system
with other systems, since this score better reflects the performance of the extraction of event structures.

GENIA consists of 34 full paper articles (Kim et al., 2013). To evaluate the performance of BioEE
on the GENIA task, we followed the task setting in BioNLP ST 2013 and used the official evaluation
systems provided by the organisers. We also used the same partitioning of data that was employed in
the official BioNLP ST 2013 evaluation, with 20 articles being used as the training/development set, and
the remaining 14 articles being held back as the test set. For brevity, we show the only the primary P,

R and F scores in the shared task, i.e., the EVENT TOTAL results obtained using the approximate span
& recursive evaluation method, as recommended by the organisers. The method individually evaluates
each complete core event, i.e., event triggers with their Theme and/or Cause role arguments, with relaxed
span matching, after nested events have been broken down as explained in Section 3.1. Note that the
scores do not count the non-named entities, hedges, and links between arguments, since only core events
are considered in the official evaluation.

We applied both a deep parser, Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) and a dependency parser, ksdep (Sagae
and Tsujii, 2007) to generate features for the ACE 2005 task, and their bio-adapted versions for the
GENIA task. We also employed the GENIA sentence splitter (Sætre et al., 2007) for sentence splitting,
and the snowball (Porter2) stemmer4 for stemming. We did not make use of any other external resources,
such as dictionaries, since this would hinder direct comparison of the two versions of the system.

4.2 Evaluation on GENIA
The “Event Detection” column in Table 2 shows evaluation results of BioEE on GENIA. The effects
on performance by including entity-related features, i.e., entity base forms and Brown clustering, as
introduced in Section 3.2, are shown as “BioEE (+Entity)”. The inclusion of these features slightly
degrades the performance.

For completeness, we also show in Table 2 the best and second best performing systems that took
part in the official BioNLP 2013 ST evaluation: EVEX (Hakala et al., 2013) and TEES-2.1 (Björne and
Salakoski, 2013). TEES-2.1 consists of a modular pipeline similar to BioEE, but it uses a different set
of features. EVEX enhances the output of TEES-2.1, by using information obtained from the results of
large-scale event extraction. The comparison shows that BioEE achieves state-of-the-art event extraction
performance on the GENIA task.

4.3 Evaluation on ACE 2005
The “Trigger Classification” and “Arg. Role Classification” columns of Table 3 summarise the evaluation
results of the Adapted BioEE system (as described in Section 3.2) on the ACE 2005 task.

We analysed the effects of incorporating features based on entity-related information into the extrac-
tion process, by repeating the experiments with such features omitted (-Entity). As can be observed in
Table 3, the removal of entity-related features led to 3% performance decrease in F-score.

For completeness, Table 3 also illustrates the results of state-of-the-art systems that were specifi-
cally developed for ACE 2005: the system based on a joint approach (Li et al., 2013) and the pipeline-
based system enhanced with web-gathered information (Hong et al., 2011). The difference between the

Adapted BioEE and the best system is small and insignificant and the Adapted BioEE achieved perfor-
mance that is comparable to or better than these other systems, in terms of the F-scores in argument role
classification.

5 Discussion

To further investigate the differences in performance of the BioEE and Adapted BioEE systems on the
two tasks, we evaluate the scores achieved for each task using the evaluation criteria originally designed
for the other task. Specifically, we apply the ACE 2005 argument role classification criteria to the out-
put of GENIA task, and we apply the complete event-based evaluation, originally used to evaluate the
GENIA task, to the events extracted for the ACE 2005 task. The “Arg. Role Decomposition” column of
Table 2 depicts the former evaluation, while the “Event Detection” column of Table 3 shows the latter.

Table 2 also shows the performance of the other biomedical event extraction systems introduced above
in carrying out argument role classification, since such information was provided as “Decomposition”
within the results of the original task evaluation5. Although the results shown for “Arg. Role Decompo-
sition” in Table 2 are not directly comparable to those shown for “Arg. Role Classification” in Table 3
(given the different characteristics of GENIA and ACE 2005 tasks), the scores are broadly comparable.
This demonstrates that the task of argument role classifications is equally challenging for both tasks.

The “Event Detection” column of Table 3 illustrates event-based evaluation scores on ACE 2005.
The event structure detector was added to the pipeline to facilitate comparison of the results of the two
different tasks in a similar setting, and performance was evaluated according to the GENIA evaluation
criteria. Evaluation scores on ACE 2005 are unexpectedly low compared to those in Table 2. Considering
that the performance of argument role classification is similar in both tasks, this low performance is likely
to be due to the large number of potential event arguments in ACE 2005. This means that, in comparison
to GENIA events, which have a small number of possible argument types, there is a greater chance that
some arguments of more complex ACE 2005 events will fail to be detected. According to the GENIA
evaluation criteria, even if the majority of arguments has been correctly identified, the complete event
structure will still be evaluated as incorrect. This helps to explain why such evaluation criteria may have
been deemed inappropriate in the original ACE 2005 evaluations.

Subsequently, we analysed the effects of utilising entity-related features. We show the results obtained
by adding entity information (+Entity) in Table 2 and the results obtained by removing entity information
(-Entity) in Table 3. The positive or negative effect on performance of adding or removing these features
is consistent across all subtask evaluations shown in the two tables, although the exact level of perfor-
mance improvement or degradation depends on the subtask under evaluation. Overall, the inclusion of
the features degraded the performance of BioEE on the GENIA task, but improved the performance of
Adapted BioEE on the ACE 2005 task. These differences may be due to the increased richness of en-
tity information in the ACE 2005 corpus, suggesting that enriching entities in the GENIA corpus with
attribute information could be a possible way to further improve the performance of the system on this
task.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have described our adaptation of a biomedical event extraction method to the newswire
domain. We firstly evaluated the method on a biomedical event extraction task (GENIA), and showed
that its performance was superior to other state-of-the-art systems designed for the task. We then adapted
the method to a newswire event extraction task (ACE 2005), by addressing the major differences between
the tasks. With only a small number of adaptations, the resulting system was also able to achieve state-of-
the-art performance on the newswire extraction task. These results show that there is no need to develop
separate systems for event extraction tasks in different domains, as long as the types of tasks being
addressed exhibit domain-independent features. However, further discussion and evaluation is needed to
better understand how different potential methods for adapting such tools from one domain to another
can be used and/or combined effectively.

As future work, we intend to further investigate the adaptation of alternative methods proposed for
use in one domain to another domain. Several interesting approaches have been described, such as the
utilisation of contextual information beyond the boundaries of individual sentences in the newswire do-
main (Ji and Grishman, 2008; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Hong et al., 2011) and joint approaches in the
biomedical domain (McClosky et al., 2012), but their adaptability to other domains has not yet been
investigated. We also intend to investigate the possibility of discovering and utilising shared information
between the two domains (Goldwasser and Roth, 2013). Encouraging greater levels of communication
between researchers working on NLP tasks in different domains will help to stimulate such new direc-
tions of research, both for event extraction and for other related information extraction tasks, such as
relation extraction and coreference resolution.
