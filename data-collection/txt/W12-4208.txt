Abstract

This paper presents two procedures for ex-
tracting transfer rules from parallel corpora
for use in a rule-based Japanese-English MT
system. First a “shallow” method where
the parallel corpus is lemmatized before it is
aligned by a phrase aligner, and then a “deep”
method where the parallel corpus is parsed by
deep parsers before the resulting predicates
are aligned by phrase aligners. In both pro-
cedures, the phrase tables produced by the
phrase aligners are used to extract semantic
transfer rules. The procedures were employed
on a 10 million word Japanese English paral-
lel corpus and 190,000 semantic transfer rules
were extracted.

1 Introduction

Just like syntactic and semantic information finds its
way into SMT models and contribute to improved
quality of SMT systems, rule-based systems bene-
fit from the inclusion of statistical models, typically
in order to rank the output of the components in-
volved. In this paper, we present another way of im-
proving RBMT systems with the help of SMT tools.
The basic idea is to learn transfer rules from paral-
lel texts: first creating alignments of predicates with
the help of SMT phrase aligners and then extracting
semantic transfer rules from these. We discuss two
procedures for creating the alignments. In the first
procedure the parallel corpus is lemmatized before
it is aligned with two SMT phrase aligners. Then
the aligned lemmas are mapped to predicates with
the help of the lexicons of the parsing grammar and
the generating grammar. Finally, the transfer rules

are extracted from the aligned predicates. In the sec-
ond procedure, the parallel corpus is initially parsed
by the parsing grammar and the generating gram-
mar. The grammars produce semantic representa-
tions, which are represented as strings of predicates.
This gives us a parallel corpus of predicates, about
a third of the size of the original corpus, which we
feed the phrase aligners. The resulting phrase tables
with aligned predicates are finally used for extrac-
tion of semantic transfer rules.

The two procedures complement each other. The
first procedure is more robust and thus learns from
more examples although the resulting rules are less
reliable. Here we extract 127,000 semantic transfer
rules. With the second procedure, which is more ac-
curate but less robust, we extract 113,000 semantic
transfer rules. The union of the procedures gives a
total of 190,000 unique rules for the Japanese En-
glish MT system Jaen.

2 Semantic Transfer

Jaen is a rule-based machine translation system em-
ploying semantic transfer rules. The medium for the
semantic transfer is Minimal Recursion Semantics,
MRS (Copestake et al., 2005). The system consists
of the two HPSG grammars: JACY, which is used
for the parsing of the Japanese input (Siegel and
Bender, 2002) and the ERG, used for the generation
of the English output (Flickinger, 2000). The third
component of the system is the transfer grammar,
which transfers the MRS representation produced by
the Japanese grammar into an MRS representation
that the English grammar can generate from: Jaen
(Bond et al., 2011).

At each step of the translation process, the output

is ranked by stochastic models. In the default con-
figuration, only the 5 top ranked outputs at each step
are kept, so the maximum number of translations is
125 (5x5x5). There is also a final reranking using a
combined model (Oepen et al., 2007).

The architecture of the MT system is illustrated in
Figure 1, where the contribution of the transfer rule
extraction from parallel corpora is depicted by the
arrow going from Bitext to Semantic Transfer.

Most of the rules in the transfer grammar are
simple predicate changing rules, like the rule for
mapping the predicate “_hon_n_rel” onto the predi-
cate “_book_v_1_rel”. Other rules are more com-
plex, and transfers many Japanese relations into
many English relations. In all, there are 61 types
of transfer rules, the most frequent being the rules
for nouns translated into nouns (44,572), noun noun
compounds translated into noun noun compounds
(38,197), and noun noun compounds translated into
adjective plus noun (27,679). 31 transfer rule types
have less than 10 instances. The most common rule
types are given in Table 1.1

1Some of the rule types are extracted by only one ex-
traction method. This holds for the types n_adj+n_mtr,
n+n+n_n+n_mtr, n+n_n_mtr, pp+np_np+pp_mtr, and
arg1+pp_arg1+pp_mtr, adj_pp_mtr, and preposition_mtr.
The lemmatized extraction method extracts rules for triple
compounds n+n+n_n+n. This is currently not done with
the semantic extraction method, since a template for a triple
compound would include 8 relations (each noun also has a
quantifier and there are two compound relations in between),
and the number of input relations are currently limited to 5 (but
can be increased). The rest of the templates are new, and they
have so far only been successfully integrated with the semantic
extraction method.

The transfer grammar has a core set of 1,415
hand-written transfer rules, covering function
words, proper nouns, pronouns, time expressions,
spatial expressions, and the most common open
class items. The rest of the transfer rules (190,356
unique rules) are automatically extracted from par-
allel corpora.

The full system is available from http:
//moin.delph-in.net/LogonTop (different
components have different licenses, all are open
source, mainly LGPL and MIT).

3 Two methods of rule extraction

The parallel corpus we use for rule extraction is
a collection of four Japanese English parallel cor-
pora and one bilingual dictionary. The corpora
are the Tanaka Corpus (2,930,132 words: Tanaka,
2001), the Japanese Wordnet Corpus (3,355,984
words: Bond, Isahara, Uchimoto, Kuribayashi, and
Kanzaki, 2010), the Japanese Wikipedia corpus
(7,949,605 words),2 and the Kyoto University Text
Corpus with NICT translations (1,976,071 words:
Uchimoto et al., 2004). The dictionary is Edict
(3,822,642 words: Breen, 2004). The word totals
include both English and Japanese words.

The corpora were divided into into development,
test, and training data. The training data from the
four corpora plus the bilingual dictionary was used
for rule extraction. The combined corpus used for
rule extraction consists of 9.6 million English words
and 10.4 million Japanese words (20 million words
in total).

3.1 Extraction from a lemmatized parallel
corpus

In the first rule extraction procedure we extracted
transfer rules directly from the surface lemmas of
the parallel text. The four parallel corpora were
tokenized and lemmatized, for Japanese with the
MeCab morphological analyzer (Kudo et al., 2004),
and for English with the Freeling analyzer (Padró
et al., 2010), with MWE, quantities, dates and sen-
tence segmentation turned off. (The bilingual dic-
tionary was not tokenized and lemmatized, since the
entries in the dictionary are lemmas).

for each type. The numbers in the Lemma column, show the number of rules extracted from the lemmatized parallel
corpus. The numbers in the Pred column show the number of rules extracted from the semantic parallel corpus. The
Intersect column, shows the number of intersecting rules of Lemma and Pred, and the Union column show the number
of distinct rules of Lemma and Pred.

We then used MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007) and
Anymalign (Lardilleux and Lepage, 2009) to align
the lemmatized parallel corpus. We got two phrase
tables with 10,812,423 and 5,765,262 entries, re-
spectively. MOSES was run with the default set-
tings, and Anymalign ran for approximately 16
hours.

We selected the entries that had (i) a translation
probability, P(English|Japanese) of more than 0.1,3

(ii) an absolute frequency of more than 1,4 (iii) fewer
than 5 lemmas on the Japanese side and fewer than 4

3This number is set based on a manual inspection of the
transfer rules produced. The output for each transfer rule tem-
plate is inspected, and for some of the templates, in particular
the multi-word expression templates, the threshold is set higher.

4The absolute frequency number can, according to Adrien
Lardilleux (p.c.), be thought of as a confidence score. The
larger, the more accurate and reliable the translation probabili-
ties. 1 is the lowest score.

lemmas on the English side,5 and (iv) lexical entries
for all lemmas in Jacy for Japanese and the ERG for
English. This gave us 2,183,700 Moses entries and
435,259 Anymalign entries, all phrase table entries
with a relatively high probability, containing lexical
items known both to the parser and the generator.

The alignments were a mix of one-to-one-or-
many and many-to-one-or-many. For each lemma
in each alignment, we listed the possible predicates
according to the lexicons of the parsing grammar
(Jacy) and the generating grammar (ERG). Since
many lemmas are ambiguous, we often ended up
with many semantic alignments for each surface
alignment. If a surface alignment contained 3 lem-
mas with two readings each, we would get 8 (2x2x2)
semantic alignments. However, some of the seman-

mas needed for the template matching on either side.

tic relations associated with a lemma had very rare
readings. In order to filter out semantic alignments
with such rare readings, we parsed the training cor-
pus and made a list of 1-grams of the semantic rela-
tions in the highest ranked output. Only the relations
that could be linked to a lemma with a probability
of more than 0.2 were considered in the semantic
alignment. The semantic alignments were matched
against 16 templates. Six of the templates are simple
one-to-one mapping templates:

1. noun ⇒ noun
2. adjective ⇒ adjective
3. adjective ⇒ intransitive verb
4. intransitive verb ⇒ intransitive verb
5. transitive verb ⇒ transitive verb
6. ditransitive verb ⇒ ditransitive verb

The rest of the templates have more than one
lemma on the Japanese side and one or more lem-
mas on the English side. In all, we extracted 126,964
rules with this method. Some of these are relatively
simple, such as 7 which takes a noun compound and
translates it into a single noun, or 8 which takes a
VP and translates it into a VP (without checking for
compositionality, if it is a common pattern we will
make a rule for it).

Other examples, such as 9 are more complex, here
the rule takes a Japanese noun-adjective combina-
tion and translates it to an adjective, with the exter-
nal argument in Japanese (the so-called second sub-
ject) linked to the subject of the English adjective.
Even though we are applying the templates to learn
rules to lemma n-grams, in the translation system
these rules apply to the semantic representation, so

they can apply to a wide variety of syntactic vari-
ations (we give an example of a relative clause be-
low).

Given the ambiguity of the lemmas used for the
extraction of transfer rules, we were forced to fil-
ter semantic relations that have a low probability in
order to avoid translations that do not generalize.
One consequence of this is that we were not building
rules that should have been built in cases where an
ambiguous lemma has one dominant reading, and
one or more less frequent, but plausible, readings.
Another consequence is that we were building rules
where the dominant reading is used, but where a less
frequent reading is correct. The method is not very
precise since it is based on simple 1-gram counts,
and we are not considering the context of the indi-
vidual lemma. A way to improve the quality of the
assignment of the relation to the lemma would be to
use a tagger or a parser. However, instead of going
down that path, we decided to parse the whole par-
allel training corpus with the parsing grammar and
the generation grammar of the MT system and pro-
duce a parallel corpus of semantic relations instead
of lemmas. In this way, we use the linguistic gram-
mars as high-precision semantic taggers.

3.2 Extraction from a parallel corpus of
predicates

The second rule extraction procedure is based on a
parallel corpus of semantic representations, rather
than lemmatized sentences. We parsed the train-
ing corpus (1,578,602 items) with the parsing gram-
mar (Jacy) and the generation grammar (ERG) of
the MT system, and got a parse with both grammars
for 630,082 items. The grammars employ statistical
models trained on treebanks in order to select the
most probable analysis. For our semantic corpus,

70



we used the semantic representation of the highest
ranked analysis on either side.

The semantic representation produced by the
ERG for the sentence The white dog barks is given in
Figure 2. The relations in the MRSs are represented
in the order they appear in the analysis.6 In the se-
mantic parallel corpus we kept the predicates, e.g.
_the_q_rel, _white_a_1_rel, and so on, but we did
not keep the information about linking. For verbs,
we attached information about the valency. Verbs
that were analyzed as intransitive, like bark in Fig-
ure 2, were represented with a suffix 1x, where 1
indicates argument 1 and x indicates a referential
index: _bark_v_1_rel@1x. If a verb was analyzed
as being transitive or ditransitive, this would be re-
flected in the suffix: _give_v_1_rel@1x2x3x. The
item corresponding to The white dog barks in the se-
mantic corpus would be _the_q_rel _white_a_1_rel
_dog_n_1_rel _bark_v_1_rel@1x.

The resulting parallel corpus of semantic rep-
resentations consists of 4,712,301 relations for
Japanese and 3,806,316 relations for English. This
means that the size of the semantic parallel corpus
is a little more than a third of the lemmatized paral-
lel corpus. The grammars used for parsing are deep
linguistic grammars, and they do not always perform
very well on out of domain data, like for example the
Japanese Wikipedia corpus. One way to increase the
coverage of the grammars would be to include ro-
bustness rules. This would decrease the reliability
of the assignment of semantic relations, but still be
more reliable than simply using 1-grams to assign
the relation.

The procedure for extracting semantic transfer
rules from the semantic parallel corpus is similar
to the procedure for extraction from the lemmatized
corpus. The major difference is that the semantic
corpus is disambiguated by the grammars.

As with the lemmatized corpus, the semantic par-
allel corpus was aligned with MOSES and Anyma-
lign. They produced 4,830,000 and 4,095,744 align-
ments respectively. Alignments with more than 5
relations on either side and with a probability of
less than 0.01 were filtered out.7 This left us with

6Each predicate has the character span of the corresponding
word(s) attached.

7A manual inspection of the rules produced by the template
matching showed that most of the rules produced for several of

4,898,366 alignments, which were checked against
22 rule templates.8 This produced 112,579 rules,
which is slightly fewer than the number of rules
extracted from the lemmatized corpus (126,964).
49,187 of the rules overlap with the rules extracted
from the lemmatized corpus, which gives us a total
number of unique rules of 190,356. The distribution
of the rules is shown in Table 1.

Some of the more complex transfer
rules types like p+n+arg12_arg12_mtr and
pp+arg12_arg12_mtr were extracted in far greater
numbers from the lemmatized corpus than from
the corpus of semantic representations. This is
partially due to the fact that the method involving
the lemmatized corpus is more robust, which means
that the alignments are done on 3 times as much
data as the method involving the corpus of semantic
predicates. Another reason is that the number
of items that need to be aligned to match these
kinds of multi-word templates is larger when the
rules are extracted from the corpus of semantic
representations. (For example, a noun relation
always has a quantifier binding it, even if there is no
particular word expressing the quantifier.) Since the
number of items to be aligned is bigger, the chance
of getting an alignment with a high probability that
matches the template becomes smaller.

One of the transfer rule templates (pp_pp_mtr)
generates many more rules with the method in-
volving the semantic predicates than the method
involving lemmas. This is because we restricted
the rule to only one preposition pair (_de_p_rel
↔ _by_p_means_rel) with the lemmatized corpus
method, while all preposition pairs are accepted with
the semantic predicate method since the confidence
in the output of this method is higher.

4 Experiment and Results

In order to compare the methods for rule extraction,
we made three versions of the transfer grammar, one
including only the rules extracted from the lemma-

the templates were good, even with a probability as low as 0.01.
For some of the templates, the threshold was set higher.

8The reason why the number of rule templates is higher with
this extraction method, is that the confidence in the results is
higher. This holds in particular for many-to-one rules, were the
quality of the rules extracted with from the lemmatized corpus
is quite low.

tized corpus (Lemm), one including only the rules
extracted from the corpus of semantic representa-
tions (Pred), and one including the union of the two
(Combined). In the Combined grammar, the Lemm
rules with a probability lower than 0.4 were filtered
out if the input relation(s) are already translated by
either handwritten rules or Pred rules since the con-
fidence in the Lemm rules is lower.

Since the two methods for rule extraction involve
different sets of templates, we also made two ver-
sions of the transfer grammar including only the 15
templates used in both Lemm and Pred. These were
named LemmCore and PredCore.

The five versions of the transfer grammar were
tested on sections 003, 004, and 005 of the Tanaka
Corpus (4,500 test sentences), and the results are
shown in Table 2. The table shows how the ver-
sions of Jaen performs with regard to parsing (con-
stant), transfer, generation, and overall coverage. It
also shows the NEVA9 scores of the highest ranked
translated sentences (NEVA), and the highest NEVA
score of the 5 highest ranked translations (Oracle).
The F1 is calculated based on the overall coverage
and the NEVA.

The coverage of Lemm and Pred is the same;
20.8%, but Pred gets a higher NEVA score than
Lemm (21.11 vs. 18.65), and the F1 score is one
percent higher. When the Lemm and Pred rules are
combined in Combined, the coverage is increased
by almost 6%. This increase is due to the fact that
the Lemm and Pred rule sets are relatively compli-

mentary. Although the use of the Lemm and Pred
transfer grammars gives the same coverage (20.8%),
only 648 (14.4%) of the test sentences are translated
by both systems. The NEVA score of Combined is
between that of Lemm and Pred while the F1 score
beats both Lemm and Pred.

When comparing the core versions of Lemm and
Pred, LemmCore and PredCore, we see the same
trend, namely that coverage is about the same and
the NEVA score is higher when the Pred rules are
used.

644 of the test sentences were translated by all
versions of the transfer grammar (Lemm, Pred, and
Combined). Table 3 shows how the different ver-
sions of Jaen perform on these sentences. The re-
sults show that the quality of the transfer rules ex-
tracted from the MRS parallel corpus is higher than
the quality of the transfer rules based on the lemma-
tized parallel corpus. It also shows that there is a
small decrease of quality when the rules from the
lemmatized parallel corpus are added to the rules
from the MRS corpus.

M: We eat fish raw.
J: We eat fish in the camcorder.

Jaen sometimes gets the arguments wrong:

(6) S: 彼は大統領に選ばれた。
R: He was elected president.
M: He was elected president.
J: The president chose him.

The output of Moses on the other hand is more
likely to lack words in the translation, and it is also
more likely to be ungrammatical. A translation with
a missing word is shown in (7).

(7) S: カーテンがゆっくり引かれた。
R: The curtains were drawn slowly.
M: The curtain was slowly.
J: The curtain was drawn slowly.

Missing words become extra problematic when a
negation is not transferred:

(8) S: 偏見は持つべきではない。
R: We shouldn’t have any prejudice.
M: You should have a bias.
J: I shouldn’t have prejudice.

Sometimes the Moses output is lacking so many
words that it is impossible to follow the meaning:

12The examples below are taken from the development data
of the Tanaka Corpus. ‘S’ stands for ‘Source’, ‘R’ stands for
‘Reference translation’, ‘M’ stands for ‘Moses translation,’ and
‘J’ stands for ‘Jaen translation.’

(9) S: 脳が私達の活動を支配している。
R: Our brains control our activities.
M: The brain to us.
J: The brain is controlling our activities.

Also the output of Moses is more likely to be un-
grammatical, as illustrated in (10) and (11).

(10) S: 私は日本を深く愛している。
R: I have a deep love for Japan.
M: I is devoted to Japan.
J: I am deeply loving Japan.

(11) S: 彼女はタオルを固く絞った。
R: She wrung the towel dry.
M: She squeezed pressed the towel.
J: She wrung the towel hard.

5 Discussion

In order to get a system with full coverage, Jaen
could be used with Moses as a fallback. This would
combine the precision of the rule-based system with
the robustness of Moses. The coverage and the qual-
ity of Jaen itself can be extended by using more
training data. Our experience is that this holds even
if the training data is from a different domain. By
adding training data, we are incrementally adding
rules to the system. We still build the rules we built
before, plus some more rules extracted from the new
data. Learning rules that are not applicable for the
translation task does not harm or slow down the sys-
tem. Jaen has a rule pre-selection program which,
before each translation task selects the applicable
rules. When the system does a batch translation of
1,500 sentences, the program selects about 15,000 of
the 190,000 automatically extracted rules, and only
these will be loaded. Rules that have been learned
but are not applicable are not used.13

We can also extend the system by adding more
transfer templates. So far, we are using 23 templates,
and by adding new templates for multi-word expres-
sions, we can increase the precision.

The predicate alignments produced from the par-
allel corpus of predicates are relatively precise since
the predicates are assigned by the grammars. This
allows us to extract transfer rules from alignments

13The pre-selection program speeds up the system by a factor
of three.

that are given a low probability (down to 0.01) by
the aligner.

We would also like to get more from the data we
have, by making the parser more robust. Two ap-
proaches that have been shown to work with other
grammars is making more use of morphological in-
formation (Adolphs et al., 2008) or adding robust-
ness rules (Cramer and Zhang, 2010).

6 Conclusion

We have shown how semantic transfer rules can be
learned from parallel corpora that have been aligned
in SMT phrase tables. We employed two strategies.
The first strategy was to lemmatize the parallel cor-
pus and use SMT aligners to create phrase tables of
lemmas. We then looked up the relations associated
with the lemmas using the lexicons of the parser and
generator. This gave us a phrase table of aligned
relations. We were able to extract 127,000 rules
by matching the aligned relations with 16 semantic
transfer rule templates.

The second strategy was to parse the parallel cor-
pus with the parsing grammar and the generating
grammar of the MT system. This gave us a paral-
lel corpus of predicates, which, because of lack of
coverage of the grammars, was about a third the size
of the full corpus. The parallel corpus of predicates
was aligned with SMT aligners, and we got a sec-
ond phrase table of aligned relations. We extracted
113,000 rules by matching the alignments against 22
rule templates. These transfer rules produced the
same number of translation as the rules produced
with the first strategy (20.8%), but they proved to
be more precise.

The two rule extraction methods complement
each other. About 30% of the sentences translated
with one rule set are not translated by the other. By
merging the two rule sets into one, we increased the
coverage of the system to 26.6%. A human evalua-
tor preferred Jaen’s translation to that of Moses for
58 out of a random sample of 100 translations.
