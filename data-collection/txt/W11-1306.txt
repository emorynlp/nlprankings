Abstract

This paper describes three systems from the
University of Minnesota, Duluth that partici-
pated in the DiSCo 2011 shared task that eval-
uated distributional methods of measuring se-
mantic compositionality. All three systems
approached this as a problem of collocation
identification, where strong collocates are as-
sumed to be minimally compositional. duluth-
1 relies on the t-score, whereas duluth-2 and
duluth-3 rely on Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (pmi). duluth-1 was the top ranked sys-
tem overall in coarse–grained scoring, which
was a 3-way category assignment where pairs
were assigned values of high, medium, or low
compositionality.

1 Introduction

An ngram or phrase that means more than the sum
of its parts is said to be non-compositional. Well
known examples include kick the bucket (i.e., to die)
and red tape (i.e., bureaucratic steps). The ability
to measure the degree of semantic compositionality
in a unit of text is a key capability of NLP systems,
since non-compositional phrases can be treated as
a single unit, rather than as a series of individual
words. This has a tremendous impact on word sense
disambiguation systems, for example, since a non-
compositional phrase will often have just one pos-
sible sense and thereby be reduced to a trivial case,
whereas the combination of possible sense assign-
ments for the words that make up a phrase can grow
exponentially.

Identifying collocations is another key capability
of NLP systems. Collocations are generally consid-

ered to be units of text that occur with some regular-
ity and may have some non-compositional meaning.
The Duluth systems that participated in the DiSCo
2011 shared task (Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011)
seek to determine the degree to which collocation
identification techniques can be used to measure se-
mantic compositionality. In particular, these systems
are based on the following hypothesis:

An ngram that has a high score accord-
ing to a measure of association (for iden-
tifying collocations) will be less composi-
tional (and less literal) than those that have
lower scores.

The intuition underlying this hypothesis is a high
score from a measure of association shows that the
words in the ngram are occurring together more of-
ten than would be expected by chance, and that
a non-compositional phrase is unlikely to occur in
such a way that it looks like a chance event.

2 System Development

The Duluth systems were developed by identify-
ing collocations based on frequency counts obtained
from the WaCky English corpus (Baroni et al.,
2009), hereafter referred to as the corpus. The part
of speech tags were removed from the corpus, and
the text was converted to lower case. A set of 139
training pairs was provided by the task organizers
that had been manually rated for compositionality.
This gold standard data was used to select which
measures of association would form the basis of the
Duluth systems. Thereafter a separate set of 174 test
pairs were provided by the organizers for evaluation.

2.1 Collocation Discovery

The Ngram Statistics Package (Text::NSP) (Baner-
jee and Pedersen, 2003) was used to measure the
association between the training pairs based on fre-
quency count data collected from the corpus. All
thirteen measures in the Ngram Statistics Package
were employed, including the Log-likelihood Ra-
tio (ll) (Dunning, 1993), Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (pmi) (Church and Hanks, 1990), Mutual Infor-
mation (tmi) (Church and Hanks, 1990), Poisson-
Stirling (ps) (Church, 2000), Fisher’s Exact Test
(leftFisher, rightFisher, and twotailed) (Pedersen et
al., 1996), Jaccard Coefficient (jaccard), Dice Coef-
ficient (dice), Phi Coefficient (phi), t-score (tscore)
(Church and Hanks, 1990), Pearson’s Chi-Squared
Test (x2), and the Odds Ratio (odds).

These measure the co-occurrence of word pairs
(bigrams) relative to their individual frequencies and
assess how likely it is that the word pair is occurring
together by chance (and is therefore likely composi-
tional) or has some significant pattern of occurrence
as a pair (in which case it is non-compositional).
More formally, many of these methods compare
the observed empirical data with a model that casts
the words in the bigram as independent statistical
events. The measures determine the degree to which
the observed data deviates from what would be ex-
pected under the model of independence. If the ob-
served data differs significantly from that, then there
is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the bi-
gram is a chance event, and we assume that there is
some interesting or significant pattern that implies
non-compositionality. In some cases the training
and test pairs are not adjacent (e.g., reinvent wheel
for reinvent the wheel), and so window sizes of 2, 4,
and 10 words were used when measuring the asso-
ciation between pairs of words. This means that 0, 2
and 8 intervening words were allowed, respectively.

Frequency count data for the word pairs are tabu-
lated as shown in the example in Figure 1. The vari-
able W1 represents the presence or absence of red
in the first position of each word pair, and W2 rep-
resents the presence or absence of tape in the sec-
ond position. This table tells us, for example, that
red tape occurs 5,363 times (n11), that red occurs
18,493 times (n1+), and that bigrams that contain
neither red nor tape occur 68,824,813 times (n22).

The total number of bigrams found in the corpus is
68,845,263 (n++). Note that these counts are based
on a window size of 2. Counts increase with a larger
window size. If the window size were 10, then n11
would tell us how many times red and tape occurred
within 8 words of each other (in order).

2.2 Scoring Word Pairs

The training pairs were ranked according to each of
the measures in Text::NSP, where high scores in-
dicate that two words (w1 and w2) are not occur-
ring together by chance, and that there is a non-
compositional meaning. However, high scores in the
shared task meant exactly the opposite; that a word
pair was highly compositional (and literal). In addi-
tion, the fine grained scoring in the shared task was
on a scale of 0 to 100, and it was required that partic-
ipating systems use that same scale. Thus, the scores
from the measures were converted to this scale as
follows:

Let the maximum value of the Text::NSP mea-
sure for all the pairs in the set under consideration be
max(m(W1, W2)), where m represents the specific
measure being used. Then the score for each word
pair is normalized by dividing it by this maximum
value, and subtracted from 1 and then multiplied by
100. More generally, the fine grained score for any
word pair (w1, w2) as computed by a specific duluth-
x system is dx(w1, w2) and is calculated as follows:

dx(w1, w2) = 100 ∗ (1−
m(w1, w2)

max(m(W1, W2))
) (1)

Coarse grained scoring is automatically per-
formed by binning all of the resulting scores in the
range 0-33 to low, 34 - 66 to medium and 67 - 100
to high.

2.3 Correlation of Word Pairs

Before the evaluation period, it was decided that
duluth-1 (our flagship system) would be based on the
measure of association that had the highest Spear-
man’s rank correlation with the fine grained gold
standard annotations of the training pairs. As can
be seen from Table 1, that measure was the t-score
based on a window size of 10.

As an additional experiment, the ranking of
the training pairs according to each measure in
Text::NSP was compared to the frequency ranking
in the corpus. As can be seen in Table 2, once again
it was the t-score that had the highest correlation.

While the correlation with the training pairs by
the t-score was encouraging, the correlation with
frequency was something of a surprise, and in fact
caused some concern. Could a measure that corre-
lated so highly with frequency really be successful
in measuring semantic compositionality? However,
upon reflection it seemed that correlation with fre-
quency might be quite desirable, and led to the for-
mulation of a second hypothesis:

Very frequent word pairs are more likely
to be compositional (i.e., highly literal)
than are less frequent word pairs.

Table 2: Text::NSP Rank Correlation with Frequency -
duluth-1 corresponds to t-score window 10, duluth-2 with
pmi window 10 and duluth-3 with pmi window 2

Window Size
Measure 2 4 10

ps 0.8856 0.8423 0.8299
ll 0.9082 0.8459 0.6953
tmi 0.9080 0.8459 0.6951
jaccard 0.7170 0.6128 0.5527
dice 0.7170 0.6128 0.5527
phi 0.7038 0.5743 0.4308
x2 0.7039 0.5744 0.4303
rightFisher -0.5998 -0.3279 0.2004
odds 0.3714 0.1483 -0.0353
pmi 0.2487 0.0789 -0.1390
leftFisher 0.5675 0.3500 -0.1726
twotailed -0.5965 -0.4434 -0.2712

The assumption that underlies this hypothesis is that
the most frequent word pairs tend to be very literal
and non-compositional (e.g., for the, in that) and it
would (in general) be a surprise to expect a compo-
sitional pair (e.g., above board, rip saw) to attain as
high a frequency.

3 duluth-1 (t-score in a 10 word window)

The duluth-1 system is based on the t-score in a 10
word window, and was selected because of its high
correlation to the gold standard annotations of the
training pairs and to the frequency ranking of the
training pairs. The t-score optimizes both of our
previous hypotheses, which suggests it should be a
good choice for measuring compositionality.

By way of background, the t-score (t) is formu-
lated as follows (Church et al., 1991), using the no-
tation introduced in Figure 1 :

t =
n11 −m11
√

n11
(2)

where n11 is the observed count of the word pair,
and m11 is the expected value based on the hypothe-
sized model of independence between variables W1
and W2. As such,

m11 =
n1+ ∗ n+1

n++
(3)

35



If there is little difference between the observed
and expected values, then the t-score is closer to zero
(or even less than zero) and the pair of words can be
judged to occur together simply by chance (i.e., the
hypothesis of independence is true).

The t-scores for the test pairs were converted fol-
lowing equation (1), and then submitted for evalu-
ation. duluth-1 placed in the middle ranks in the
fine grain evaluation according to mean distance,
and was the top ranked system according to the label
precision evaluation of coarse grained scoring.

4 duluth-2 (pmi with window size of 10)

In studying Tables 1 and 2, it’s clear that Point-
wise Mutual Information (pmi) deviates rather sig-
nificantly from frequency and the t-score. At the
time of the evaluation, we did not know if our hy-
potheses that motivated the use of the t-score would
prove to be true. If they did not, it seemed sensible to
include the most opposite measure to the t-score, as
a kind of fail safe mechanism for our systems over-
all. In addition, pmi has a fairly significant history of
use in identifying collocations and features for other
NLP tasks (e.g., (Pantel and Lin, 2002)), and so it
seemed like a credible candidate.

pmi has a well known bias towards identifying
words that only occur together, and tends to prefer
less frequent word pairs, and this is why it diverges
so significantly from the t-score and frequency. In-
terestingly, pmi is also based on the same observed
and expected values n11 and m11 as used in the t-
score (and many of the other measures), and is cal-
culated as follows:

pmi = log
n11

m11
(4)

If there is little difference between the observed
and expected values, then pmi tends towards 0 and
we treat the word pairs as independent and compo-
sitional.

duluth-2 relies on a window size of 10, since it di-
verges dramatically from the t-score and frequency.

5 duluth-3 (pmi with window size of 2)

duluth-3 is a very close relative of duluth-2, and dif-
fers only in that it requires word pairs to be adjacent.
Given the wider window sizes in duluth-2, it is clear

that if a pair has a high pmi score, they must only oc-
cur (mostly) together. duluth-3 only considers adja-
cent words, and so the words that make up the pairs
may also appear elsewhere in the corpus. As such
duluth-3 may tend to assign higher pmi scores than
the more exacting duluth-2 (where high scores mean
low compositionality). And in fact this is what oc-
curred. In the coarse scoring scheme, duluth-1 only
identified 2 low compositional word pairs, whereas
duluth-2 identified 46 and duluth-3 identified 70.

Despite the difference in the window size the rank
correlation between duluth-2 and duluth-3 is rela-
tively high (.9330). Both performed comparably in
the evaluation, being near the bottom of both the
fine and coarse grained evaluations. By comparison,
duluth-1 and duluth-2 have a relatively low rank cor-
relation of .1756, and duluth-1 and duluth-3 have a
modest correlation of .3438.

6 Conclusions

The Duluth systems seek to evaluate the degree to
which measures of collocation are able to measure
semantic compositionality as well. The results of
this shared task suggest that the t-score is well suited
to make coarse grained distinctions between high,
medium, and low levels of compositionality, since
duluth-1 was the top ranked system in the coarse
grained evaluation. While this success might be
considered surprising due to the simplicity of the
approach, it should not be underestimated. There
are two separate hypotheses that underly the t-score
and its use in measuring semantic compositionality.
These hold that word pairs with high measures of as-
sociation are more likely to be non–compositional,
and that more frequent word pairs are more likely to
be compositional. Of the measures evaluated in this
study, the t-score was best able to optimize both of
these conditions.
