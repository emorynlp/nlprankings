Abstract

Most previous work on trainable language
generation has focused on two paradigms:
(a) using a statistical model to rank a
set of generated utterances, or (b) using
statistics to inform the generation deci-
sion process. Both approaches rely on
the existence of a handcrafted generator,
which limits their scalability to new do-
mains. This paper presents BAGEL, a sta-
tistical language generator which uses dy-
namic Bayesian networks to learn from
semantically-aligned data produced by 42
untrained annotators. A human evalua-
tion shows that BAGEL can generate nat-
ural and informative utterances from un-
seen inputs in the information presentation
domain. Additionally, generation perfor-
mance on sparse datasets is improved sig-
nificantly by using certainty-based active
learning, yielding ratings close to the hu-
man gold standard with a fraction of the
data.

1 Introduction

The field of natural language generation (NLG) is
one of the last areas of computational linguistics to
embrace statistical methods. Over the past decade,
statistical NLG has followed two lines of research.
The first one, pioneered by Langkilde and Knight
(1998), introduces statistics in the generation pro-
cess by training a model which reranks candi-
date outputs of a handcrafted generator. While
their HALOGEN system uses an n-gram language
model trained on news articles, other systems have
used hierarchical syntactic models (Bangalore and
Rambow, 2000), models trained on user ratings of

der grant agreement EP/F013930/1 and funded by the EU

project: www.classic-project.org).

utterance quality (Walker et al., 2002), or align-
ment models trained on speaker-specific corpora
(Isard et al., 2006).

A second line of research has focused on intro-
ducing statistics at the generation decision level,
by training models that find the set of genera-
tion parameters maximising an objective function,
e.g. producing a target linguistic style (Paiva and
Evans, 2005; Mairesse and Walker, 2008), gener-
ating the most likely context-free derivations given
a corpus (Belz, 2008), or maximising the expected
reward using reinforcement learning (Rieser and
Lemon, 2009). While such methods do not suffer
from the computational cost of an overgeneration
phase, they still require a handcrafted generator to
define the generation decision space within which
statistics can be used to find an optimal solution.

This paper presents BAGEL (Bayesian networks
for generation using active learning), an NLG sys-
tem that can be fully trained from aligned data.
While the main requirement of the generator is to
produce natural utterances within a dialogue sys-
tem domain, a second objective is to minimise the
overall development effort. In this regard, a major
advantage of data-driven methods is the shift of
the effort from model design and implementation
to data annotation. In the case of NLG systems,
learning to produce paraphrases can be facilitated
by collecting data from a large sample of annota-
tors. Our meaning representation should therefore
(a) be intuitive enough to be understood by un-
trained annotators, and (b) provide useful gener-
alisation properties for generating unseen inputs.
Section 2 describes BAGEL’s meaning represen-
tation, which satisfies both requirements. Sec-
tion 3 then details how our meaning representation
is mapped to a phrase sequence, using a dynamic
Bayesian network with backoff smoothing.

Within a given domain, the same semantic
concept can occur in different utterances. Sec-
tion 4 details how BAGEL exploits this redundancy

to improve generation performance on sparse
datasets, by guiding the data collection process
using certainty-based active learning (Lewis and
Catlett, 1994). We train BAGEL in the informa-
tion presentation domain, from a corpus of utter-
ances produced by 42 untrained annotators (see
Section 5.1). An automated evaluation metric is
used to compare preliminary model and training
configurations in Section 5.2, while Section 5.3
shows that the resulting system produces natural
and informative utterances, according to 18 hu-
man judges. Finally, our human evaluation shows
that training using active learning significantly im-
proves generation performance on sparse datasets,
yielding results close to the human gold standard
using a fraction of the data.

2 Phrase-based generation from
semantic stacks

BAGEL uses a stack-based semantic representa-
tion to constrain the sequence of semantic con-
cepts to be searched. This representation can be
seen as a linearised semantic tree similar to the
one previously used for natural language under-
standing in the Hidden Vector State model (He
and Young, 2005). A stack representation provides
useful generalisation properties (see Section 3.1),
while the resulting stack sequences are relatively
easy to align (see Section 5.1). In the context of
dialogue systems, Table 1 illustrates how the input
dialogue act is first mapped to a set of stacks of
semantic concepts, and then aligned with a word
sequence. The bottom concept in the stack will
typically be a dialogue act type, e.g. an utterance
providing information about the object under dis-
cussion (inform) or specifying that the request
of the user cannot be met (reject). Other con-
cepts include attributes of that object (e.g., food,
area), values for those attributes (e.g., Chinese,
riverside), as well as special symbols for negat-
ing underlying concepts (e.g., not) or specifying
that they are irrelevant (e.g., dontcare).

The generator’s goal is thus finding the
most likely realisation given an unordered
set of mandatory semantic stacks Sm derived
from the input dialogue act. For example,
s =inform(area(centre)) is a mandatory stack
associated with the dialogue act in Table 1 (frame
8). While mandatory stacks must all be conveyed
in the output realisation, Sm does not contain the
optional intermediary stacks Si that can refer to

(a) general attributes of the object under discus-
sion (e.g., inform(area) in Table 1), or (b) to
concepts that are not in the input at all, which are
associated with the singleton stack inform (e.g.,
phrases expressing the dialogue act type, or clause
aggregation operations). For example, the stack
sequence in Table 1 contains 3 intermediary stacks
for t = 2, 5 and 7.

BAGEL’s granularity is defined by the semantic
annotation in the training data, rather than external
linguistic knowledge about what constitutes a unit
of meaning, i.e. contiguous words belonging to
the same semantic stack are modelled as an atomic
observation unit or phrase.1 In contrast with word-
level models, a major advantage of phrase-based
generation models is that they can model long-
range dependencies and domain-specific idiomatic
phrases with fewer parameters.

3 Dynamic Bayesian networks for NLG

Dynamic Bayesian networks have been used suc-
cessfully for speech recognition, natural language
understanding, dialogue management and text-to-
speech synthesis (Rabiner, 1989; He and Young,
2005; Lefèvre, 2006; Thomson and Young, 2010;
Tokuda et al., 2000). Such models provide a
principled framework for predicting elements in a
large structured space, such as required for non-
trivial NLG tasks. Additionally, their probabilistic
nature makes them suitable for modelling linguis-
tic variation, i.e. there can be multiple valid para-
phrases for a given input.

BAGEL models the generation task as finding
the most likely sequence of realisation phrases
R∗ = (r1...rL) given an unordered set of manda-
tory semantic stacks Sm, with |Sm| ≤ L. BAGEL
must thus derive the optimal sequence of semantic
stacks S∗ that will appear in the utterance given
Sm, i.e. by inserting intermediary stacks if needed
and by performing content ordering. Any num-
ber of intermediary stacks can be inserted between
two consecutive mandatory stacks, as long as all
their concepts are included in either the previous
or following mandatory stack, and as long as each
stack transition leads to a different stack (see ex-
ample in Table 1). Let us define the set of possi-
ble stack sequences matching these constraints as
Seq(Sm) ⊆ {S = (s1...sL) s.t. st ∈ Sm ∪ Si}.

We propose a model which estimates the dis-

one or more words.

P (R|S)P (S|Sm) (1)

Inference over the model defined in (1) requires
the decoding algorithm to consider all possible or-
derings over Seq(Sm) together with all possible
realisations, which is intractable for non-trivial do-
mains. We thus make the additional assumption
that the most likely sequence of semantic stacks
S∗ given Sm is the one yielding the optimal reali-
sation phrase sequence:

P (R|Sm) ≈ P (R|S∗)P (S∗|Sm) (2)
with S∗ = argmax

S∈Seq(Sm)
P (S|Sm) (3)

The semantic stacks are therefore decoded first
using the model in Fig. 1 to solve the argmax
in (3). The decoded stack sequence S∗ is then
treated as observed in the realisation phase, in
which the model in Fig. 2 is used to find the real-
isation phrase sequence R∗ maximising P (R|S∗)
over all phrase sequences of length L = |S∗| in
our vocabulary:

R∗ = argmax
R=(r1...rL)

P (R|S∗)P (S∗|Sm) (4)

R=(r1...rL)

In order to reduce model complexity, we fac-
torise our model by conditioning the realisation
phrase at time t on the previous phrase rt−1,
and the previous, current, and following semantic
stacks. The semantic stack st at time t is assumed

While dynamic Bayesian networks typically
take sequential inputs, mapping a set of seman-
tic stacks to a sequence of phrases is achieved
by keeping track of the mandatory stacks that
were visited in the current sequence (see stack set
tracker variable in Fig. 1), and pruning any se-
quence that has not included all mandatory input
stacks on reaching the final frame (see observed
stack set validator variable in Fig. 1). Since the
number of intermediary stacks is not known at de-
coding time, the network is unrolled for a fixed
number of frames T defining the maximum num-
ber of phrases that can be generated (e.g., T =
50). The end of the stack sequence is then deter-
mined by a special end symbol, which can only
be emitted within the T frames once all mandatory
stacks have been visited. The probability of the re-
sulting utterance is thus computed over all frames
up to the end symbol, which determines the length

1554



L of S∗ and R∗. While the decoding constraints
enforce that L > |Sm|, the search for S∗ requires
comparing sequences of different lengths. A con-
sequence is that shorter sequences containing only
mandatory stacks are likely to be favoured. While
future work should investigate length normalisa-
tion strategies, we find that the learned transition
probabilities are skewed enough to favour stack
sequences including intermediary stacks.

Once the topology and the decoding constraints
of the network have been defined, any inference al-
gorithm can be used to search for S∗ and R∗. We
use the junction tree algorithm implemented in the
Graphical Model ToolKit (GMTK) for our exper-
iments (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002), however both
problems can be solved using a standard Viterbi
search given the appropriate state representation.
In terms of computational complexity, it is impor-
tant to note that the number of stack sequences
Seq(Sm) to search over increases exponentially
with the number of input mandatory stacks. Nev-
ertheless, we find that real-time performance can
be achieved by pruning low probability sequences,
without affecting the quality of the solution.

3.1 Generalisation to unseen semantic stacks

In order to generalise to semantic stacks which
have not been observed during training, the re-
alisation phrase r is made dependent on under-
specified stack configurations, i.e. the tail l
and the head h of the stack. For example, the
last stack in Table 1 is associated with the head
centre and the tail inform(area). As a re-
sult, BAGEL assigns non-zero probabilities to re-
alisation phrases in unseen semantic contexts, by
backing off to the head and the tail of the stack.
A consequence is that BAGEL’s lexical realisa-
tion can generalise across contexts. For exam-
ple, if reject(area(centre)) was never ob-
served at training time, P (r = centre of town|s =
reject(area(centre))) will be estimated by
backing off to P (r = centre of town|h =
centre). BAGEL can thus generate ‘there are
no venues in the centre of town’ if the phrase
‘centre of town’ was associated with the con-
cept centre in a different context, such as
inform(area(centre)). The final realisation
model is illustrated in Fig. 2:

Conditional probability distributions are repre-
sented as factored language models smoothed us-
ing Witten-Bell interpolated backoff smoothing
(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), according to the
backoff graphs in Fig. 3. Variables which are the
furthest away in time are dropped first, and par-
tial stack variables are dropped last as they are ob-
served the most.

It is important to note that generating unseen se-
mantic stacks requires all possible mandatory se-
mantic stacks in the target domain to be prede-
fined, in order for all stack unigrams to be assigned
a smoothed non-zero probability.

3.2 High cardinality concept abstraction
While one should expect a trainable generator
to learn multiple lexical realisations for low-
cardinality semantic concepts, learning lexical
realisations for high-cardinality database entries
(e.g., proper names) would increase the number of
model parameters prohibitively. We thus divide
pre-terminal concepts in the semantic stacks into
two types: (a) enumerable attributes whose val-
ues are associated with distinct semantic stacks in

1555



our model (e.g., inform(pricerange(cheap))),
and (b) non-enumerable attributes whose values
are replaced by a generic symbol before train-
ing in both the utterance and the semantic stack
(e.g., inform(name(X)). These symbolic values
are then replaced in the surface realisation by the
corresponding value in the input specification. A
consequence is that our model can only learn syn-
onymous lexical realisations for enumerable at-
tributes.

4 Certainty-based active learning

A major issue with trainable NLG systems is the
lack of availability of domain-specific data. It is
therefore essential to produce NLG models that
minimise the data annotation cost.

BAGEL supports the optimisation of the data
collection process through active learning, in
which the next semantic input to annotate is de-
termined by the current model. The probabilis-
tic nature of BAGEL allows the use of certainty-
based active learning (Lewis and Catlett, 1994),
by querying the k semantic inputs for which the
model is the least certain about its output real-
isation. Given a finite semantic input space I
representing all possible dialogue acts in our do-
main (i.e., the set of all sets of mandatory seman-
tic stacks Sm), BAGEL’s active learning training
process iterates over the following steps:

1. Generate an utterance for each semantic input Sm ∈ I
using the current model.2

2. Annotate the k semantic inputs {S1m...Skm} yielding
the lowest realisation probability, i.e. for q ∈ (1..k)

Sqm = argmin
Sm∈I\{S1m...S

q−1
m }

(max
R

P (R|Sm)) (9)

with P (R|Sm) defined in (2).

3. Retrain the model with the additional k data points.

The number of utterances to be queried k should
depend on the flexibility of the annotators and the
time required for generating all possible utterances
in the domain.

5 Experimental method

BAGEL’s factored language models are trained us-
ing the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), and de-
coding is performed using GMTK’s junction tree
inference algorithm (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002).

2Sampling methods can be used if I is infinite or too
large.

Since each active learning iteration requires gen-
erating all training utterances in our domain, they
are generated using a larger clique pruning thresh-
old than the test utterances used for evaluation.

5.1 Corpus collection

We train BAGEL in the context of a dialogue
system providing information about restaurants
in Cambridge. The domain contains two dia-
logue act types: (a) inform: presenting infor-
mation about a restaurant (see Table 1), and (b)
reject: informing that the user’s constraints can-
not be met (e.g., ‘There is no cheap restaurant
in the centre’). Our domain contains 8 restau-
rant attributes: name, food, near, pricerange,
postcode, phone, address, and area, out of
which food, pricerange, and area are treated
as enumerable.3 Our input semantic space is ap-
proximated by the set of information presentation
dialogue acts produced over 20,000 simulated di-
alogues between our statistical dialogue manager
(Young et al., 2010) and an agenda-based user
simulator (Schatzmann et al., 2007), which results
in 202 unique dialogue acts after replacing non-
enumerable values by a generic symbol. Each di-
alogue act contains an average of 4.48 mandatory
semantic stacks.

As one of our objectives is to test whether
BAGEL can learn from data provided by a large
sample of untrained annotators, we collected a
corpus of semantically-aligned utterances using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk data collection ser-
vice. A crucial aspect of data collection for
NLG is to ensure that the annotators under-
stand the meaning of the semantics to be con-
veyed. Annotators were first asked to provide
an utterance matching an abstract description
of the dialogue act, regardless of the order in
which the constraints are presented (e.g., Offer
the venue Taj Mahal and provide the information
type(restaurant), area(riverside), food(Indian),
near(The Red Lion)). The order of the constraints
in the description was randomised to reduce the
effect of priming. The annotators were then asked
to align the attributes (e.g., Indicate the region of
the utterance related to the concept ‘area’), and
the attribute values (e.g., Indicate only the words
related to the concept ‘riverside’). Two para-
phrases were collected for each dialogue act in
our domain, resulting in a total of 404 aligned ut-

terances produced by 42 native speakers of En-
glish. After manually checking and normalising
the dataset,4 the layered annotations were auto-
matically mapped to phrase-level semantic stacks
by splitting the utterance into phrases at annotation
boundaries. Each annotated utterance is then con-
verted into a sequence of symbols such as in Ta-
ble 2, which are used to estimate the conditional
probability distributions defined in (6) and (8).
The resulting vocabulary consists of 52 distinct se-
mantic stacks and 109 distinct realisation phrases,
with an average of 8.35 phrases per utterance.

5.2 BLEU score evaluation

We first evaluate BAGEL using the BLEU auto-
mated metric (Papineni et al., 2002), which mea-
sures the word n-gram overlap between the gen-
erated utterances and the 2 reference paraphrases
over a test corpus (with n up to 4). While BLEU
suffers from known issues such as a bias towards
statistical NLG systems (Reiter and Belz, 2009), it
provides useful information when comparing sim-
ilar systems. We evaluate BAGEL for different
training set sizes, model dependencies, and active
learning parameters. Our results are averaged over
a 10-fold cross-validation over distinct dialogue
acts, i.e. dialogue acts used for testing are not seen
at training time,5 and all systems are tested on the
same folds. The training and test sets respectively
contain an average of 181 and 21 distinct dialogue
acts, and each dialogue act is associated with two
paraphrases, resulting in 362 training utterances.

4The normalisation process took around 4 person-hour for
404 utterances.

5We do not evaluate performance on dialogue acts used
for training, as the training examples can trivially be used as
generation templates.

Figure 4: BLEU score averaged over a 10-fold
cross-validation for different training set sizes and
network topologies, using random sampling.

Results: Fig. 4 shows that adding a dependency
on the future semantic stack improves perfor-
mances for all training set sizes, despite the added
model complexity. Backing off to partial stacks
also improves performance, but only for sparse
training sets.

Fig. 5 compares the full model trained using
random sampling in Fig. 4 with the same model
trained using certainty-based active learning, for
different values of k. As our dataset only con-
tains two paraphrases per dialogue act, the same
dialogue act can only be queried twice during the
active learning procedure. A consequence is that
the training set used for active learning converges
towards the randomly sampled set as its size in-
creases. Results show that increasing the train-
ing set one utterance at a time using active learn-
ing (k = 1) significantly outperforms random
sampling when using 40, 80, and 100 utterances
(p < .05, two-tailed). Increasing the number of
utterances to be queried at each iteration to k = 10
results in a smaller performance increase. A possi-

Figure 6: BLEU score averaged over a 10-fold

ble explanation is that the model is likely to assign
low probabilities to similar inputs, thus any value
above k = 1 might result in redundant queries
within an iteration.

As the length of the semantic stack sequence
is not known before decoding, the active learn-
ing selection criterion presented in (9) is biased
towards longer utterances, which tend to have a
lower probability. However, Fig. 6 shows that
normalising the log probability by the number of
semantic stacks does not improve overall learn-
ing performance. Although a possible explanation
is that longer inputs tend to contain more infor-
mation to learn from, Fig. 6 shows that a base-
line selecting the largest remaining semantic input
at each iteration performs worse than the active
learning scheme for training sets above 20 utter-
ances. The full log probability selection criterion
defined in (9) is therefore used throughout the rest
of the paper (with k = 1).

5.3 Human evaluation
While automated metrics provide useful informa-
tion for comparing different systems, human feed-
back is needed to assess (a) the quality of BAGEL’s
outputs, and (b) whether training models using ac-
tive learning has a significant impact on user per-
ceptions. We evaluate BAGEL through a large-
scale subjective rating experiment using Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk service.

For each dialogue act in our domain, partici-
pants are presented with a ‘gold standard’ human
utterance from our dataset, which they must com-
pare with utterances generated by models trained
with and without active learning on a set of 20, 40,
100, and 362 utterances (full training set), as well
as with the second human utterance in our dataset.
See example utterances in Table 3. The judges are
then asked to evaluate the informativeness and nat-
uralness of each of the 8 utterances on a 5 point
likert-scale. Naturalness is defined as whether the
utterance could have been produced by a human,
and informativeness is defined as whether it con-
tains all the information in the gold standard utter-
ance. Each utterance is taken from the test folds of
the cross-validation experiment presented in Sec-
tion 5.2, i.e. the models are trained on up to 90%
of the data and the training set does not contain the
dialogue act being tested.

Results: Figs. 7 and 8 compare the naturalness
and informativeness scores of each system aver-
aged over all 202 dialogue acts. A paired t-test
shows that models trained on 40 utterances or
less produce utterances that are rated significantly
lower than human utterances for both naturalness
and informativeness (p < .05, two-tailed). How-
ever, models trained on 100 utterances or more do
not perform significantly worse than human utter-
ances for both dimensions, with a mean difference
below .10 over 202 comparisons. Given the large
sample size, this result suggests that BAGEL can
successfully learn our domain using a fraction of
our initial dataset.

As far as the learning method is concerned, a
paired t-test shows that models trained on 20 and
40 utterances using active learning significantly
outperform models trained using random sam-
pling, for both dimensions (p < .05). The largest
increase is observed using 20 utterances, i.e. the
naturalness increases by .49 and the informative-
ness by .37. When training on 100 utterances, the
effect of active learning becomes insignificant. In-

Figure 7: Naturalness mean opinion scores for dif-
ferent training set sizes, using random sampling
and active learning. Differences for training set
sizes of 20 and 40 are all significant (p < .05).

terestingly, while models trained on 100 utterances
outperform models trained on 40 utterances using
random sampling (p < .05), they do not signifi-
cantly outperform models trained on 40 utterances
using active learning (p = .15 for naturalness and
p = .41 for informativeness). These results sug-
gest that certainty-based active learning is benefi-
cial for training a generator from a limited amount
of data given the domain size.

Looking back at the results presented in Sec-
tion 5.2, we find that the BLEU score correlates
with a Pearson correlation coefficient of .42 with
the mean naturalness score and .35 with the mean
informativeness score, over all folds of all systems
tested (n = 70, p < .01). This is lower than
previous correlations reported by Reiter and Belz
(2009) in the shipping forecast domain with non-
expert judges (r = .80), possibly because our do-
main is larger and more open to subjectivity.

6 Related work

While most previous work on trainable NLG re-
lies on a handcrafted component (see Section 1),
recent research has started exploring fully data-
driven NLG models.

Factored language models have recently been
used for surface realisation within the OpenCCG
framework (White et al., 2007; Espinosa et al.,
2008). More generally, chart generators for
different grammatical formalisms have been
trained from syntactic treebanks (White et al.,
2007; Nakanishi et al., 2005), as well as from
semantically-annotated treebanks (Varges and
Mellish, 2001). However, a major difference with
our approach is that BAGEL uses domain-specific
data to generate a surface form directly from se-
mantic concepts, without any syntactic annotation
(see Section 7 for further discussion).

This work is strongly related to Wong and
Mooney’s WASP−1 generation system (2007),
which combines a language model with an in-
verted synchronous CFG parsing model, effec-
tively casting the generation task as a translation
problem from a meaning representation to natu-
ral language. WASP−1 relies on GIZA++ to align
utterances with derivations of the meaning repre-
sentation (Och and Ney, 2003). Although early
experiments showed that GIZA++ did not perform
well on our data—possibly because of the coarse
granularity of our semantic representation—future
work should evaluate the generalisation perfor-
mance of synchronous CFGs in a dialogue system
domain.

Although we do not know of any work on ac-
tive learning for NLG, previous work has used
active learning for semantic parsing and informa-
tion extraction (Thompson et al., 1999; Tang et al.,
2002), spoken language understanding (Tur et al.,
2003), speech recognition (Hakkani-Tür et al.,
2002), word alignment (Sassano, 2002), and more
recently for statistical machine translation (Blood-
good and Callison-Burch, 2010). While certainty-
based methods have been widely used, future work
should investigate the performance of committee-
based active learning for NLG, in which examples
are selected based on the level of disagreement be-
tween models trained on subsets of the data (Fre-
und et al., 1997).

7 Discussion and conclusion

This paper presents and evaluates BAGEL, a sta-
tistical language generator that can be trained en-
tirely from data, with no handcrafting required be-
yond the semantic annotation. All the required
subtasks—i.e. content ordering, aggregation, lex-
ical selection and realisation—are learned from
data using a unified model. To train BAGEL in a di-
alogue system domain, we propose a stack-based
semantic representation at the phrase level, which
is expressive enough to generate natural utterances
from unseen inputs, yet simple enough for data to
be collected from 42 untrained annotators with a
minimal normalisation step. A human evaluation
over 202 dialogue acts does not show any differ-
ence in naturalness and informativeness between
BAGEL’s outputs and human utterances. Addition-
ally, we find that the data collection process can
be optimised using active learning, resulting in a
significant increase in performance when training

data is limited, according to ratings from 18 hu-
man judges.6 These results suggest that the pro-
posed framework can largely reduce the develop-
ment time of NLG systems.

While this paper only evaluates the most likely
realisation given a dialogue act, we believe that
BAGEL’s probabilistic nature and generalisation
capabilities are well suited to model the linguis-
tic variation resulting from the diversity of annota-
tors. Our first objective is thus to evaluate the qual-
ity of BAGEL’s n-best outputs, and test whether
sampling from the output distribution can improve
naturalness and user satisfaction within a dialogue.

Our results suggest that explicitly modelling
syntax is not necessary for our domain, possi-
bly because of the lack of syntactic complexity
compared with formal written language. Never-
theless, future work should investigate whether
syntactic information can improve performance in
more complex domains. For example, the reali-
sation phrase can easily be conditioned on syntac-
tic constructs governing that phrase, and the recur-
sive nature of syntax can be modelled by keeping
track of the depth of the current embedded clause.
While syntactic information can be included with
no human effort by using syntactic parsers, their
robustness to dialogue system utterances must first
be evaluated.

Finally, recent years have seen HMM-based
synthesis models become competitive with unit se-
lection methods (Tokuda et al., 2000). Our long
term objective is to take advantage of those ad-
vances to jointly optimise the language genera-
tion and the speech synthesis process, by combin-
ing both components into a unified probabilistic
concept-to-speech generation model.
