Abstract

We present the S-Space Package, an open
source framework for developing and eval-
uating word space algorithms. The pack-
age implements well-known word space
algorithms, such as LSA, and provides a
comprehensive set of matrix utilities and
data structures for extending new or ex-
isting models. The package also includes
word space benchmarks for evaluation.
Both algorithms and libraries are designed
for high concurrency and scalability. We
demonstrate the efficiency of the reference
implementations and also provide their re-
sults on six benchmarks.

1 Introduction

Word similarity is an essential part of understand-
ing natural language. Similarity enables meaning-
ful comparisons, entailments, and is a bridge to
building and extending rich ontologies for evaluat-
ing word semantics. Word space algorithms have
been proposed as an automated approach for de-
veloping meaningfully comparable semantic rep-
resentations based on word distributions in text.

Many of the well known algorithms, such as
Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais,
1997) and Hyperspace Analogue to Language
(Burgess and Lund, 1997), have been shown to
approximate human judgements of word similar-
ity in addition to providing computational mod-
els for other psychological and linguistic phenom-
ena. More recent approaches have extended this
approach to model phenomena such as child lan-
guage acquisition (Baroni et al., 2007) or seman-
tic priming (Jones et al., 2006). In addition, these
models have provided insight in fields outside of
linguistics, such as information retrieval, natu-
ral language processing and cognitive psychology.
For a recent survey of word space approaches and
applications, see (Turney and Pantel, 2010).

The parallel development of word space models
in different fields has often resulted in duplicated
work. The pace of development presents a need
for a reliable method for accurate comparisons be-
tween new and existing approaches. Furthermore,
given the frequent similarity of approaches, we
argue that the research community would greatly
benefit from a common library and evaluation util-
ities for word spaces. Therefore, we introduce the
S-Space Package, an open source framework with
four main contributions:

1. reference implementations of frequently
cited algorithms

2. a comprehensive, highly concurrent library of
tools for building new models

3. an evaluation framework for testing mod-
els on standard benchmarks, e.g. the TOEFL
Synonym Test (Landauer et al., 1998)

4. a standardized interface for interacting with
all word space models, which facilitates word
space based applications.

The package is written in Java and defines a
standardized Java interface for word space algo-
rithms. While other word space frameworks ex-
ist, e.g. (Widdows and Ferraro, 2008), the focus
of this framework is to ease the development of
new algorithms and the comparison against exist-
ing models. Compared to existing frameworks,
the S-Space Package supports a much wider vari-
ety of algorithms and provides significantly more
reusable developer utilities for word spaces, such
as tokenizing and filtering, sparse vectors and
matrices, specialized data structures, and seam-
less integration with external programs for di-
mensionality reduction and clustering. We hope
that the release of this framework will greatly fa-
cilitate other researchers in their efforts to de-
velop and validate new word space models. The
toolkit is available at http://code.google.com/
p/airhead-research/, which includes a wiki

containing detailed information on the algorithms,
code documentation and mailing list archives.

2 Word Space Models

Word space models are based on the contextual
distribution in which a word occurs. This ap-
proach has a long history in linguistics, starting
with Firth (1957) and Harris (1968), the latter
of whom defined this approach as the Distribu-
tional Hypothesis: for two words, their similarity
in meaning is predicted by the similarity of the
distributions of their co-occurring words. Later
models have expanded the notion of co-occurrence
but retain the premise that distributional similarity
can be used to extract meaningful relationships be-
tween words.

Word space algorithms consist of the same core
algorithmic steps: word features are extracted
from a corpus and the distribution of these features
is used as a basis for semantic similarity. Figure 1
illustrates the shared algorithmic structure of all
the approaches, which is divided into four compo-
nents: corpus processing, context selection, fea-
ture extraction and global vector space operations.

Corpus processing normalizes the input to cre-
ate a more uniform set of features on which the al-
gorithm can work. Corpus processing techniques
frequently include stemming and filtering of stop
words or low-frequency words. For web-gathered
corpora, these steps also include removal of non
linguistic tokens, such as html markup, or restrict-
ing documents to a single language.

Context selection determines which tokens in a
document may be considered for features. Com-
mon approaches use a lexical distance, syntac-
tic relation, or document co-occurrence to define
the context. The various decisions for selecting
the context accounts for many differences between
otherwise similar approaches.

Feature extraction determines the dimensions of
the vector space by selecting which tokens in the
context will count as features. Features are com-
monly word co-occurrences, but more advanced
models may perform a statistical analysis to se-
lect only those features that best distinguish word
meanings. Other models approximate the full set
of features to enable better scalability.

Global vector space operations are applied to
the entire space once the initial word features have
been computed. Common operations include al-
tering feature weights and dimensionality reduc-

tion. These operations are designed to improve
word similarity by changing the feature space it-
self.

3 The S-Space Framework

The S-Space framework is designed to be extensi-
ble, simple to use, and scalable. We achieve these
goals through the use of Java interfaces, reusable
word space related data structures, and support for
multi-threading. Each word space algorithm is de-
signed to run as a stand alone program and also to
be used as a library class.

3.1 Reference Algorithms

The package provides reference implementations
for twelve word space algorithms, which are listed
in Table 1. Each algorithm is implemented in its
own Java package, and all commonalities have
been factored out into reusable library classes.
The algorithms implement the same Java interface,
which provides a consistent abstraction of the four
processing stages.

We divide the algorithms into four categories
based on their structural similarity: document-
based, co-occurrence, approximation, and Word
Sense Induction (WSI) models. Document-based
models divide a corpus into discrete documents
and construct the vector space from word fre-
quencies in the documents. The documents are
defined independently of the words that appear
in them. Co-occurrence models build the vector
space using the distribution of co-occurring words
in a context, which is typically defined as a re-
gion around a word or paths rooted in a parse
tree. The third category of models approximate

Figure 1: A high-level depiction of common algorithmic steps that convert a corpus into a word space

co-occurrence data rather than model it explic-
itly in order to achieve better scalability for larger
data sets. WSI models also use co-occurrence but
also attempt to discover distinct word senses while
building the vector space. For example, these al-
gorithms might represent “earth” with two vectors
based on its meanings “planet” and “dirt.”

3.2 Data Structures and Utilities

The S-Space Package provides efficient imple-
mentations for matrices, vectors, and specialized
data structures such as multi-maps and tries. Im-
plementations are modeled after the java.util li-
brary and offer concurrent implementations when
multi-threading is required. In addition, the li-
braries provide support for converting between
multiple matrix formats, enabling interaction with
external matrix-based programs. The package also
provides support for parsing different corpora for-
mats, such as XML or email threads.

3.3 Global Operation Utilities

Many algorithms incorporate dimensionality re-
duction to smooth their feature data, e.g. (Lan-
dauer and Dumais, 1997; Rohde et al., 2009),
or to improve efficiency, e.g. (Sahlgren et al.,
2008; Jones et al., 2006). The S-Space Pack-
age supports two common techniques: the Sin-
gular Value Decomposition (SVD) and random-
ized projections. All matrix data structures are de-
signed to seamlessly integrate with six SVD im-
plementations for maximum portability, including
SVDLIBJ1 , a Java port of SVDLIBC2, a scalable
sparse SVD library. The package also provides
a comprehensive library for randomized projec-
tions, which project high-dimensional feature data
into a lower dimensional space. The library sup-
ports both integer-based projections (Kanerva et
al., 2000) and Gaussian-based (Jones et al., 2006).

The package supports common matrix trans-
formations that have been applied to word
spaces: point wise mutual information (Dekang,

http://tedlab.mit.edu/d̃r/SVDLIBC/

1998), term frequency-inverse document fre-
quency (Salton and Buckley, 1988), and log en-
tropy (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).

3.4 Measurements

The choice of similarity function for the vector
space is the least standardized across approaches.
Typically the function is empirically chosen based
on a performance benchmark and different func-
tions have been shown to provide application spe-
cific benefits (Weeds et al., 2004). To facili-
tate exploration of the similarity function param-
eter space, the S-Space Package provides sup-
port for multiple similarity functions: cosine sim-
ilarity, Euclidean distance, KL divergence, Jac-
card Index, Pearson product-moment correlation,
Spearman’s rank correlation, and Lin Similarity
(Dekang, 1998)

3.5 Clustering

Clustering serves as a tool for building and refin-
ing word spaces. WSI algorithms, e.g. (Puran-
dare and Pedersen, 2004), use clustering to dis-
cover the different meanings of a word in a cor-
pus. The S-Space Package provides bindings for
using the CLUTO clustering package3. In addi-
tion, the package provides Java implementations
of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, Spec-
tral Clustering (Kannan et al., 2004), and the Gap
Statistic (Tibshirani et al., 2000).

4 Benchmarks

Word space benchmarks assess the semantic con-
tent of the space through analyzing the geomet-
ric properties of the space itself. Currently used
benchmarks assess the semantics by inspecting the
representational similarity of word pairs. Two
types of benchmarks are commonly used: word
choice tests and association tests. The S-Space
Package supports six tests, and has an easily ex-
tensible model for adding new tests.

4.1 Word Choice

Word choice tests provide a target word and a list
of options, one of which has the desired relation to
the target. Word space models solve these tests by
selecting the option whose representation is most
similar. Three word choice benchmarks that mea-
sure synonymy are supported.

The first test is the widely-reported Test of En-
glish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) synonym
test from (Landauer et al., 1998), which consists
of 80 multiple-choice questions with four options.
The second test comes from the English as a Sec-
ond Language (ESL) exam and consists of 50
question with four choices (Turney, 2001). The
third consists of 200 questions from the Canadian
Reader’s Digest Word Power (RDWP) (Jarmasz
and Szpakowicz, 2003), which unlike the previ-
ous two tests, allows the target and options to be
multi-word phrases.

4.2 Word Association

Word association tests measure the semantic re-
latedness of two words by comparing word space
similarity with human judgements. Frequently,
these tests measure synonymy; however, other
types of word relations such as antonymy (“hot”
and “cold”) or functional relatedness (“doctor”
and “hospital”) are also possible. The S-Space
Package supports three association tests.

The first test uses data gathered by Rubenstein

and Goodneough (1965). To measure word simi-
larity, word similarity scores of 51 human review-
ers were gathered a set of 65 noun pairs, scored on
a scale of 0 to 4. The ratings are then correlated
with word space similarity scores.

Finkelstein et al. (2002) test for relatedness. 353
word pairs were rated by either 13 or 16 subjects
on a 0 to 10 scale for how related the words are.
This test is notably more challenging for word
space models because human ratings are not tied
to a specific semantic relation.

The third benchmark considers the antonym as-
sociation. Deese (1964) introduced 39 antonym
pairs that Greffenstette (1992) used to assess
whether a word space modeled the antonymy rela-
tionship. We quantify this relationship by measur-
ing the similarity rank of each word in an antonym
pair, w1, w2, i.e. w2 is the kth most-similar word
to w1 in the vector space. The antonym score is
calculated as 2

rankw1 (w2)+rankw2 (w1)
. The score

ranges from [0, 1], where 1 indicates that the most
similar neighbors in the space are antonyms. We
report the mean score for all 39 antonyms.

5 Algorithm Analysis

The content of a word space is fundamentally
dependent upon the corpus used to construct it.
Moreover, algorithms which use operations such
as the SVD have a limit to the corpora sizes they

Figure 3: Run time improvement as a factor of in-

can process. We therefore highlight the differ-
ences in performance using two corpora. TASA
is a collection of 44,486 topical essays introduced
in (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). The second cor-
pus is built from a Nov. 11, 2009 Wikipedia snap-
shot, and filtered to contain only articles with more
than 1000 words. The resulting corpus consists of
387,082 documents and 917 million tokens.

Table 2 reports the scores of reference algo-
rithms on the six benchmarks using cosine simi-
larity. The variation in scoring illustrates that dif-
ferent algorithms are more effective at capturing
certain semantic relations. We note that scores are
likely to change for different parameter configura-
tions of the same algorithm, e.g. token filtering or
changing the number of dimensions.

As a second analysis, we report the efficiency
of reference implementations by varying the cor-
pus size and number of threads. Figure 2 reports
the total amount of time each algorithm needs for
processing increasingly larger segments of a web-

gathered corpus when using 8 threads. In all cases,
only the top 100,000 words were counted as fea-
tures. Figure 3 reports run time improvements due
to multi-threading on the TASA corpus.

Algorithm efficiency is determined by three fac-
tors: contention on global statistics, contention on
disk I/O, and memory limitations. Multi-threading
benefits increase proportionally to the amount of
work done per context. Memory limitations ac-
count for the largest efficiency constraint, espe-
cially as the corpus size and number of features
grow. Several algorithms lack data points for
larger corpora and show a sharp increase in run-
ning time in Figure 2, reflecting the point at which
the models no longer fit into 8GB of memory.

6 Future Work and Conclusion

We have described a framework for developing
and evaluating word space algorithms. Many well
known algorithms are already provided as part of
the framework as reference implementations for
researches in distributional semantics. We have
shown that the provided algorithms and libraries
scale appropriately. Last, we motivate further re-
search by illustrating the significant performance
differences of the algorithms on six benchmarks.

Future work will be focused on providing sup-
port for syntactic features, including dependency
parsing as described by (Padó and Lapata, 2007),
reference implementations of algorithms that use
this information, non-linear dimensionality reduc-
tion techniques, and more advanced clustering al-
gorithms.
