Abstract

There is little evidence of widespread adoption of 
speech summarization systems. This may be due in 
part to the fact that the natural language heuristics 
used  to  generate  summaries  are  often  optimized 
with respect to a class of evaluation measures that, 
while  computationally  and  experimentally  inex-
pensive,  rely on subjectively selected gold stand-
ards  against  which  automatically  generated  sum-
maries  are  scored.  This  evaluation  protocol  does 
not take into account the usefulness of a summary 
in assisting the listener in achieving his or her goal.
     In this paper we study how current measures 
and methods for evaluating summarization systems 
compare to human-centric evaluation criteria. For 
this, we have designed and conducted an ecologic-
ally valid evaluation that determines the value of a 
summary  when  embedded  in  a  task,  rather  than 
how closely a summary resembles a gold standard. 
The results of our evaluation demonstrate  that  in 
the  domain  of  lecture  summarization,  the  well-
known  baseline  of  maximal  marginal  relevance 
(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) is statistically sig-
nificantly  worse  than  human-generated  extractive 
summaries,  and even worse than having no sum-
mary at  all in  a simple quiz-taking task. Priming 
seems to have no statistically significant effect on 
the usefulness  of the human summaries.  In addi-
tion, ROUGE scores and, in particular, the context-
free annotations that are often supplied to ROUGE 

as references, may not always be reliable as inex-
pensive proxies for ecologically valid evaluations. 
In fact, under some conditions, relying exclusively 
on ROUGE may even lead to scoring human-gen-
erated summaries that are inconsistent in their use-
fulness relative to using no summaries very favour-
ably.

1 Background and Motivation

Summarization  maintains  a  representation  of  an 
entire spoken document, focusing on those utter-
ances (sentence-like units) that are most important 
and therefore does not require the user to process 
everything that has been said. Our work focuses on 
extractive summarization where a selection of ut-
terances is chosen from the original spoken docu-
ment in order to make up a summary.

Current  speech  summarization  research  has 
made extensive use  of intrinsic  evaluation meas-
ures  such  as  F-measure,  Relative  Utility,  and 
ROUGE  (Lin,  2004),  which  score  summaries 
against  subjectively  selected  gold  standard  sum-
maries obtained using human annotators. These an-
notators are asked to arbitrarily select (in or out) or 
rank utterances, and in doing so commit to relative 
salience judgements with no attention to goal ori-
entation  and  no  requirement  to  synthesize  the 
meanings of larger units of structure into a coher-
ent message.

28



Given this  subjectivity,  current  intrinsic evalu-
ation measures are unable to properly judge which 
summaries  are  useful  for real-world applications. 
For  example,  intrinsic  evaluations  have  failed  to 
show that summaries created by algorithms based 
on complex linguistic and acoustic features are bet-
ter  than  baseline  summaries  created  by  simply 
choosing the positionally first utterances or longest 
utterances in a spoken document (Penn and Zhu, 
2008).  What  is  needed  is  an  ecologically  valid 
evaluation  that  determines  how valuable  a  sum-
mary is when embedded in a task, rather than how 
closely  a  summary  matches  the  subjective  utter-
ance level scores assigned by annotators.
   Ecological validity is "the ability of experiments 
to tell us how real people operate in the real world" 
(Cohen, 1995). This is often obtained by using hu-
man judges, but it is important to realize that the 
mere use of human subjects provides no guarantee 
as  to the ecological  validity  of their  judgements. 
When utterances are merely ranked with numerical 
scores  out  of  context,  for  example,  the  human 
judges who perform this task are not performing a 
task that they generally perform in their daily lives, 
nor does the task correspond to how they would 
create or use a good summary if they did have a 
need for one. In fact, there may not even be a guar-
antee that they  understand the task --- the notions 
of “importance,” “salience” and the like, when de-
fining the criterion by which utterances are selec-
ted, are not easy to circumscribe. Judgements ob-
tained in this fashion are no better than those of the 
generative linguists who leaned back in their arm-
chairs in the 1980s to introspect on the grammatic-
ality  of  natural  language  sentences.  The  field  of 
computational linguistics could only advance when 
corpora became electronically available to invest-
igate language that was written in an ecologically 
valid context.
   Ours is not the first ecologically valid experiment 
to be run in the context of speech summarization, 
however.  He et al. (1999; 2000) conducted a very 
thorough  and  illuminating  study  of  speech  sum-
marization in the lecture domain that  showed (1) 
speech summaries are indeed very useful to have 
around, if they are done properly, and (2) abstract-
ive summaries do not seem to add any statistically 
significant advantage to the quality of a summary 
over  what  topline  extractive  summaries  can 
provide. This is very good news; extractive sum-
maries are worth creating. Our study extends this 

work by attempting to evaluate the relative quality 
of  extractive  summaries.  We  conjecture  that  it 
would be very difficult for this field to progress un-
less we have a means of accurately measuring ex-
tractive summarization quality. Even if the meas-
ure comes at great expense, it is important to do.
   Another noteworthy paper is that of Liu and Liu 
(2010), who, in addition to collecting human sum-
maries of six meetings, conducted a subjective as-
sessment of the quality of those summaries  with 
numerically  scored  questionnaires.  These  are 
known as Likert scales, and they form an important 
component of any human-subject study in the field 
of human-computer interaction. Liu and Liu (2010) 
cast  considerable doubt on the value of ROUGE 
relative to these questionnaires. We will focus here 
on an objective, task-based measure that typically 
complements those subjective assessments.

2 Spontaneous Speech

Spontaneous speech is often not linguistically well-
formed,  and  contains  disfluencies,  such  as  false 
starts,  filled pauses,  and repetitions.  Additionally, 
spontaneous speech is more vulnerable to automat-
ic speech recognition (ASR) errors, resulting in a 
higher  word  error  rate  (WER).  As  such,  speech 
summarization has the most potential for domains 
consisting  of  spontaneous  speech  (e.g.  lectures, 
meeting recordings). Unfortunately, these domains 
are not easy to evaluate compared to highly struc-
tured  domains  such  as  broadcast  news.  Further-
more,  in  broadcast  news,  nearly  perfect  studio 
acoustic  conditions  and  professionally  trained 
readers  results  in  low  ASR WER,  making  it  an 
easy domain to summarize. The result is that most 
research has been conducted in this domain. How-
ever,  a positional  baseline performs very well  in 
summarizing broadcast news (Christensen, 2004), 
meaning that simply taking the first  N utterances 
provides a very challenging baseline, questioning 
the value of summarizing this domain. In addition, 
the widespread availability  of written  sources  on 
the same topics means that there is not a strong use 
case for speech summarization over simply sum-
marizing the equivalent  textual  articles on which 
the news  broadcasts  were  based.   This  makes  it 
even more difficult to preserve ecological validity.

University lectures present a much more relev-
ant domain, with less than ideal acoustic conditions 
but  structured  presentations  in  which  deviation 

29



from written sources (e.g., textbooks) is common-
place.  Here,  a  positional  baseline  performs  very 
poorly. The lecture domain also lends itself well to 
a  task-based  evaluation  measure;  namely  univer-
sity level quizzes or exams. This constitutes a real-
world problem in a domain that is also representat-
ive of other spontaneous speech domains that can 
benefit from speech summarization.

3 Ecologically Valid Evaluation

As pointed out by Penn and Zhu (2008), current 
speech summarizers have been optimized to per-
form an utterance selection task that may not ne-
cessarily reflect how a summarizer is able to cap-
ture the goal orientation or purpose of the speech 
data. In our study, we follow methodologies estab-
lished in the field of Human-Computer Interaction 
(HCI) for evaluating an algorithm or system – that 
is, determining the benefits a system brings to its 
users, namely usefulness, usability, or utility, in al-
lowing a user to reach a specific goal. Increasingly, 
such user-centric evaluations are carried out within 
various  natural  language  processing  applications 
(Munteanu et  al.,  2006).  The  prevailing  trend in 
HCI  is  for  conducting  extrinsic  summary  evalu-
ations (He et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2008; Tucker 
et al., 2010), where the value of a summary is de-
termined by how well the summary can be used to 
perform a specific task rather than comparing the 
content of a summary to an artificially created gold 
standard. We have conducted an ecologically valid 
evaluation of speech summarization that has evalu-
ated summaries  under real-world conditions, in a 
task-based manner.

The university lecture domain is an example of a 
domain where summaries are an especially suitable 
tool  for  navigation.  Simply  performing  a  search 
will not result in the type of understanding required 
of students in their lectures. Lectures have topics, 
and there is a clear communicative goal. For these 
reasons, we have chosen this domain for our evalu-
ation. By using actual university lectures as well as 
university students representative of the users who 
would make use of a speech summarization system 
in this domain, all results obtained are ecologically 
valid.

3.1Experimental Overview
We conducted a within-subject experiment where 
participants  were  provided  with  first  year  soci-
ology university lectures on a lecture browser sys-
tem installed on a desktop computer. For each lec-
ture, the browser made accessible the audio, manu-
al transcripts, and an optional summary. Evaluation 
of a summary was based on how well the user of 
the summary was able to complete a quiz based on 
the content of the original lecture material.

It is important to note that not all extrinsic eval-
uation is ecologically valid.  To ensure ecological 
validity in this study, great care was taken to en-
sure that human subjects were placed under condi-
tions that result in behavior that would be expected 
in actual real-world tasks.

3.2Evaluation
Each quiz consisted of 12 questions, and were de-
signed to be representative of what students were 
expected to learn in the class, incorporating factual 
questions  only,  to  ensure  that  variation  in  parti-
cipant  intelligence had a minimal impact  on res-
ults.  In  addition,  questions  involved  information 
that was distributed equally throughout the lecture, 
but at the same time not linearly in the transcript or 
audio  slider,  which  would  have  allowed  parti-
cipants to predict where the next answer might be 
located. Finally, questions were designed to avoid 
content that was thought to be common knowledge 
in  order  to  minimize  the  chance  of  participants 
having previous knowledge of the answers.

All  questions  were  short  answer  or  fill-in-the-
blank. Each quiz consisted of an equal number of 
four distinct  types  of questions,  designed so that 
performing a simple search would not be effective, 
though  no  search  functionality  was  provided. 
Question types do not appear in any particular or-
der on the quiz and were not grouped together.

Type  1: These  questions  can  be  answered 
simply  by  looking  at  the  slides.  As  such,  these 
questions  could  be  answered  correctly  with  or 
without a summary as slides were available in all 
conditions.

Type 2:  Slides provide an indication of where 
the content required to answer these questions are 
located. Access to the corresponding utterances is 
still required to find the answer to the questions.

30



Type 3: Answers to these questions can only be 
found  in  the  transcript  and  audio.  The  slides 
provide no hint as to where the relevant content is 
located.

Type 4: These questions are more complicated 
and require a certain level of topic comprehension. 
These questions often require connecting concepts 
from various portions of the lecture. These ques-
tions are more difficult and were included to min-
imize  the chance  that  participants  would already 
know the answer to questions without watching the 
lecture.

A teaching assistant for the sociology class from 
which  our  lectures  were  obtained  generated  the 
quizzes  used in the evaluation.  This teaching as-
sistant had significant experience in the course, but 
was not involved in the design of this study and did 
not have any knowledge relating to our hypotheses 
or  the  topic  of  extractive  summarization.  These 
quizzes provided an ecologically valid quantitative 
measure of whether a given summary was useful. 
Having this evaluation metric in place, automated 
summaries  were  compared  to  manual  summaries 
created by each participant in a previous session.

3.3Participants
Subjects  were  recruited  from  a  large  university 
campus,  and  were  limited  to  undergraduate  stu-
dents  who  had  at  least  two  terms  of  university 
studies,  to  ensure  familiarity  with  the  format  of 
university-level lectures and quizzes. Students who 
had taken the first year sociology course we drew 
lectures  from  were  not  permitted  to  participate. 
The study was conducted with 48 participants over 
the  course  of  approximately  one  academic 
semester.

3.4Method
Each evaluation session began by having a parti-
cipant perform a short warm-up with a portion of 
lecture content, allowing the participant to become 
familiar with the lecture browser interface. Follow-
ing  this,  the  participant  completed  four  quizzes, 
one  for  each  of  four  lecture-condition  combina-
tions. There were a total of four lectures and four 
conditions.  Twelve  minutes  were  given  for  each 
quiz. During this time, the participant was able to 
browse the audio, slides, and summary. Each lec-
ture was about forty minutes in length, establishing 

a time constraint. Lectures and conditions were ro-
tated using a Latin square for counter balancing. 
All participants completed each of the four condi-
tions.

One week prior to his or her evaluation session, 
each participant was brought in and asked to listen 
to  and  summarize  the  lectures  beforehand.  This 
resulted  in  the  evaluation  simulating  a  scenario 
where  someone  has  heard  a  lecture  at  least  one 
week in the past and may or may not remember the 
content during an exam or quiz. This is similar to 
conditions most university students experience.

3.5Conditions
The lecture audio recordings were manually tran-
scribed and segmented into utterances, determined 
by 200 millisecond pauses,  resulting in segments 
that  correspond  to  natural  sentences  or  phrases. 
The task of summarization consisted of choosing a 
set of utterances for inclusion in a summary (ex-
tractive summarization), where the total summary 
length was bounded by 17-23% of the words in the 
lecture;  a percentage typical  to most  summariza-
tion scoring tasks. All participants were asked to 
make use of the browser interface for four lectures, 
one for each of the following conditions:  no sum-
mary,  generic  manual summary,  primed manual  
summary, and automatic summary.

No  summary: This condition  served  as  a 
baseline where no summary was provided, but par-
ticipants  had  access  to  the  audio  and  transcript. 
While  all  lecture  material  was  provided,  the 
twelve-minute time constraint made it impossible 
to listen to the lecture in its entirety.

Generic  manual  summary: I  this  condition, 
each  participant  was  provided  with  a  manually 
generated summary. Each summary was created by 
the participant him or herself in a previous session. 
Only  audio  and text  from the  in-summary  utter-
ances  were  available  for  use.  This  condition 
demonstrates how a manually created summary is 
able to aid in the task of taking a quiz on the sub-
ject matter.

Primed manual summary: Similar to above, in 
this condition, a summary was created manually by 
selecting a set of utterances from the lecture tran-
script.  For  primed  summaries,  full  access  to  a 
priming quiz, containing all of the questions in the 
evaluation quiz as well as several additional ques-
tions, was available  at the time of summary cre-

31



ation. This determines the value of creating sum-
maries with a particular task in mind, as opposed to 
simply choosing utterances that are felt to be most 
important or salient.

Automatic  summary: The  procedure  for  this 
condition was identical to the generic manual sum-
mary condition from the point of view of the parti-
cipant.  However, during the evaluation phase, an 
automatically generated summary was provided in-
stead of the summary that the participant created 
him or herself. The algorithm used to generate this 
summary was an implementation of  MMR  (Car-
bonell and Goldstein, 1998). Cosine similarity with 
tf-idf term weighting was used to calculate similar-
ity. Although the redundancy component of MMR 
makes  it  especially  suitable  for  multi-document 
summarization,  there  is  no  negative  effect  if  re-
dundancy is not an issue. It is worth noting that our 
lectures are longer than material typically summar-
ized, and lectures in general are more likely to con-
tain  redundant  material  than  a  domain  such  as 
broadcast news. There was only one MMR sum-
mary generated for each lecture, meaning that mul-
tiple participants made use of identical summaries. 
The automatic summary was created by adding the 
highest scoring utterances one at a time until the 
sum of the length of all of the selected utterances 
reached 20% of the number of words in the origin-
al  lecture.  MMR was  chosen  as  it  is  commonly 
used  in  summarization.  MMR  is  a  competitive 
baseline,  even  among  state-of-art  summarization 
algorithms, which tend to correlate well with it.

What  this  protocol  does  not  do  is  pit  several 
strategies  for  automatic  summary  generation 
against  each  other.   That  study,  where  more  ad-
vanced summarization algorithms will also be ex-
amined, is forthcoming.  The present experiments 
have the collateral benefit  of  serving as a means 
for collecting ecologically valid human references 
for that study.

3.6Results
Quizzes were scored by a teaching assistant for the 
sociology  course  from  which  the  lectures  were 
taken. Quizzes were marked as they would be in 
the  actual  course  and  each  question  was  graded 
with equal  weight  out  of  two marks.  The scores 
were then converted to a percentage. The resulting 
scores (Table 1) are 49.3+-17.3% for the  no sum-
mary condition,  48.0+-16.2%  for  the  generic  

manual  summary  condition,  49.1+-15.2% for  the 
primed summary  condition,  and 41.0+-16.9% for 
MMR. These scores are lower than averages expec-
ted in a typical university course. This can be par-
tially  attributed  to  the  existence  of  a  time  con-
straint.

Table 1. Average Quiz Scores

Execution  of  the  Shapiro-Wilk Test  confirmed 
the scores are normally distributed and Mauchly's 
Test of Sphericity indicates that the sphericity as-
sumption holds. Skewness and Kurtosis tests were 
also  employed  to  confirm  normality.  A repeated 
measures  ANOVA determined  that  scores  varied 
significantly between conditions (F(3,141)=5.947, 
P=0.001). Post-hoc tests using the Bonferroni cor-
rection  indicate  that  the  no  summary,  generic  
manual  summary,  and  primed  manual  summary 
conditions all  resulted  in  higher  scores  than  the 
automatic (MMR) summary condition. The differ-
ence  is  significant  at  P=0.007,  P=0.014 and 
P=0.012 respectively. Although normality was as-
sured, the Friedman Test further confirms a signi-
ficant  difference  between  conditions 
(χ2(3)=11.684, P=0.009).

4 F-measure

F-measure is an evaluation metric that balances 
precision and recall which has been used to evalu-
ate summarization. Utterance level F-measure 
scores were calculated using the same summaries 
used in our human evaluation. In addition, three 
annotators were asked to create conventional gold 
standard summaries using binary selection. Annot-
ators were not primed in any sense, did not watch 
the lecture videos, and had no sense of the higher 
level purpose of their annotations. We refer to the 
resulting summaries as context-free as they were 
not created under ecologically valid conditions. F-
measure was also calculated with reference to 
these.

The F-measure results (Table 2) point out a few 
interesting phenomena. Firstly, when evaluating a 

32



given  peer  summary  type  with  the  same  model 
type,  the  generic-generic  scores  are  higher  than 
both  the  primed-primed and  context-free-con-
text-free summaries. This means that generic sum-
maries tend to share more utterances with each oth-
er, than primed summaries do, which are more var-
ied. This seems unintuitive at first, but could po-
tentially be explained by the possibility that differ-
ent participants focused on different aspects of the 
priming quiz, due to either perceived importance, 
or lack of time (or summary space) to address all 
of the priming questions.

Table 2. Average F-measure

We  also  observe  that  generic  summaries  are 
more similar to conventionally annotated (context-
free) summaries than either primed or MMR are. 
This  makes  sense  and  also  confirms  that  even 
though primed summaries do not significantly out-
perform generic summaries in the quiz taking task, 
they are inherently distinguishable from each other.

Furthermore,  when  evaluating  MMR using  F-
measure,  we  see that  MMR summaries  are  most 
similar to the context-free summaries, whose utter-
ance selections can be considered somewhat arbit-
rary.  Our  quiz  results  confirm MMR is  signific-
antly worse  than  generic  and primed summaries. 
This casts doubt on the practice of using similarly 
annotated  summaries  as  gold  standards  for  sum-
marization evaluation using ROUGE.

5 ROUGE Evaluation

More  common  than  F-measure,  ROUGE  (Lin, 
2004) is often used to evaluate summarization. Al-
though Lin (2004) claimed to have demonstrated 

that ROUGE correlates well with human summar-
ies,  both  Murray  et  al.  (2005),  and Liu  and Liu 
(2010) have cast doubt upon this.  It is important to 
acknowledge, however, that ROUGE is actually a 
family of measures, distinguished not only by the 
manner  in  which  overlap  is  measured  (1-grams, 
longest  common  subsequences,  etc.),  but  by  the 
provenience of the summaries that are provided to 
it as references.  If these are not ecologically valid, 
there is no sense in holding ROUGE accountable 
for an erratic result.
   To examine how ROUGE fairs under ecologic-
ally  valid  conditions,  we  calculated  ROUGE-1, 
ROUGE-2,  ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-SU4 on our 
data using the standard options outlined in previ-
ous DUC evaluations. ROUGE scores were calcu-
lated  for  each  of  the  generic  manual  summary, 
primed manual summary, and automatic summary 
conditions.  Each  summary  in  a  given  condition 
was  evaluated  once  against  the  generic  manual  
summaries  and  once  using  the  primed  manual 
summaries.  Similar  to  Liu  and  Liu  (2010), 
ROUGE  evaluation  was  conducted  using  leave-
one-out on the model summary type and averaging 
the results.

In addition to calculating ROUGE on the sum-
maries from our ecologically valid evaluation, we 
also followed  more  conventional  ROUGE evalu-
ation  and  used  the  same  context-free  annotator 
summaries as were used in our F-measure calcula-
tions above. Using these context-free summaries, 
the original  generic  manual,  primed manual,  and 
automatic  summaries  were  evaluated  using 
ROUGE.  The  result  of  these  evaluations  are 
presented in Table 3.

Looking at the ROUGE scores, we can see that 
when evaluated by each type of model summary, 
MMR  performs  worse  than  either  generic  or 
primed manual summaries. This is consistent with 
our quiz results, and perhaps shows that ROUGE 
may be able to distinguish human summaries from 
MMR.  Looking  at  the  generic-generic,  primed-
primed,  and  context-free-context-free scores,  we 
can get a sense of how much agreement there was 
between summaries. It is not surprising that con-
text-free  annotator  summaries  showed  the  least 
agreement,  as  these  summaries  were  generated 
with no higher purpose in mind. This suggests that 
using annotators to generate gold standards in such 
a manner is not ideal.  In addition, real world ap-
plications  for  summarization  would  conceivably 

33



rarely consist of a situation where a summary was 
created for no apparent reason. More interesting is 
the observation that, when measured by ROUGE, 
primed summaries have less in common with each 
other than generic summaries do. The difference, 
however,  is  less  pronounced  when  measured  by 
ROUGE than by F-measure. This is likely due to 
the fact that ROUGE can account for semantically 
similar utterances.

5.1Correlation with Quiz Scores
In order to assess the ability of ROUGE to predict 
quiz scores, we measured the correlation between 
ROUGE scores and quiz scores on a per participant 
basis. Similar to Murray et al. (2005), and Liu and 
Liu (2010), we used Spearman’s rank coefficient 
(rho) to measure the correlation between ROUGE 
and our human evaluation. Correlation was meas-
ured both by calculating Spearman's rho on all data 
points (“all” in Table 4) and by performing the cal-
culation separately for each lecture and averaging 
the results (“avg”). Significant rho values (p-value 
less than 0.05) are shown in bold.

Note that there are not many bolded values, in-
dicating  that  there  are  few  (anti-)correlations 
between quiz scores and ROUGE. The rho values 
reported by Liu and Liu (2010) correspond to the 
“all”  row of  our  generic-context-free  scores  (Liu 
and Liu (2010) did not report ROUGE-L), and we 
obtained  roughly  the  same  scores  as  they
did.  In  contrast  to  this,  our  "all"  generic-generic 
correlations are very low. It is possible that the lec-

tures condition the parameters of the correlation to 
such an extent that fitting all of the quiz-ROUGE
pairs to the same correlation across lectures is un-
reasonable. It may therefore be more useful to look 
at rho  values computed by lecture. For these val-
ues, our R-SU4 scores are not as high relative to R-
1 and R-2 as those reported by Liu and Liu (2010). 
It is also worth noting that the use of context-free 
binary selections as a reference results in increased 
correlation for generic summaries, but substantially 
decreases correlation for primed summaries.

With the exception that generic references prefer 
generic  summaries  and  primed  references  prefer 
primed  summaries,  all  other  values  indicate  that 
both generic and primed summaries are better than 
MMR.  However,  instead  of  ranking  summary 
types,  what  is  important  here  is  the  ecologically 
valid quiz scores.  Our data provides no evidence 
that ROUGE scores accurately predict quiz scores. 

6 Conclusions

We have presented an investigation into how cur-
rent  measures  and  methodologies  for  evaluating 
summarization systems compare to human-centric 
evaluation  criteria.  An  ecologically-valid  evalu-
ation was conducted that determines the value of a 
summary  when  embedded  in  a  task,  rather  than 
how closely a summary resembles a gold standard. 
The  resulting  quiz  scores  indicate  that  manual 
summaries  are  significantly  better  than  MMR. 
ROUGE scores were calculated using the summar-
ies created in the study. In addition, more conven-
tional context-free annotator summaries were also 
used in ROUGE evaluation. Spearman's rho indic-
ated  no  correlation  between  ROUGE scores  and 
our ecologically valid quiz scores. The results offer 
evidence that ROUGE scores and particularly con-
text-free  annotator-generated  summaries  as  gold 
standards may not always be reliably used in place 
of an ecologically valid evaluation.
