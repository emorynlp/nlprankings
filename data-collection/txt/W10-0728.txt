Abstract 

Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service 
is becoming increasingly popular in Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) research. In this 
paper, we report our findings in using MTurk 
to annotate medical text extracted from clini-
cal trial descriptions with three entity types: 
medical condition, medication, and laboratory 
test. We compared MTurk annotations with a 
gold standard manually created by a domain 
expert. Based on the good performance re-
sults, we conclude that MTurk is a very prom-
ising tool for annotating large-scale corpora 
for biomedical NLP tasks. 

1 Introduction 
The manual construction of annotated corpora is ex-
tremely expensive both in terms of time and money. 
Snow et al. (2008) demonstrated the potential power of 
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service in annotat-
ing large corpora for natural language tasks cheaply and 
quickly. We are working on a Natural Language Proc-
essing (NLP) project to automate the clinical trial eligi-
bility screening of patients. This project involves 
building statistical models for medical named entity 
recognition which requires a large-scale annotated cor-
pus for training. As part of corpus development, we 
tested the feasibility of using MTurk for the annotation 
of medical named entities in biomedical text and we 
report our findings in this paper. 
In the following sections we describe how we used 
MTurk to annotate the biomedical corpus created from 
publicly available clinical trial announcements. The 
main goal of our study was to understand how well non-
experts perform compared to medical expert in annotat-
ing the biomedical text.  

2 Related Work 
MTurk1 is an online micro-task market that allows re-
questers to distribute work to a large number of workers 
from all over the world. The inspiration of the system

was to have human workers complete simple tasks that 
would otherwise be extremely difficult for computers to 
perform (Kittur et al., 2008). A complex task is broken 
down into simple, one-time tasks called Human Intelli-
gence Tasks (HITs). Requesters post their HITs on the 
MTurk marketplace by specifying the amount paid for 
the completion of each task, and the workers select from 
the available HITs the ones that they would like to work 
on. In 2007, Amazon claimed that the user base of 
MTurk consisted of over 100,000 users from 100 coun-
tries2. 

MTurk has been adopted for a variety of uses both in 
industry and academia, ranging from user studies (Kittur 
et al., 2008) to image labeling (Sorokin and Forsyth, 
2008). Snow et al. (2008) examined the quality of labels 
created by MTurk workers for various NLP tasks in-
cluding word sense disambiguation, word similarity, 
text entailment, and temporal ordering. Since the publi-
cation of Snow et al.’s paper, MTurk has become in-
creasingly popular as an annotation tool for NLP 
research. Nakov (2008) used MTurk to create a manu-
ally annotated resource for noun-noun compound inter-
pretation based on paraphrasing verbs. In a different 
NLP task, Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evalu-
ate machine translation quality. With a budget of only 
$10, Callison-Burch demonstrated the feasibility of per-
forming manual evaluations of machine translation 
quality by recreating judgments from a WMT08 transla-
tion task.  

In our pilot study we used MTurk to annotate entities in 
the biomedical text. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study that investigates the feasibility of MTurk for bio-
medical named entity annotation. 

3 Annotation Task Description 
In this section we will describe the types of entities in 
our annotation task and the details of our corpus crea-
tion process.

3.1 Entity Types 

We used MTurk to annotate the biomedical text for the 
following three entity types:  
• Medical Conditions 

Example: First-degree relative who developed 
<Medical_Condition>breast cancer 
</Medical_Condition> at ≤ 50 years of age. 

• Medications 
Example: Previous treatment with an <Medica-
tion>anthracycline</Medication> in the metas-
tatic breast cancer setting. 

• Laboratory Test 
Example: <Laboratory_Test>Platelet count 
>=100,000 cells/mL</Laboratory_Test>. 

3.2 Corpus  

Our corpus came from the publicly available clinical 
trial announcements available at the ClinicalTrials.gov 
website. This website is a registry of federally and pri-
vately supported clinical trials conducted in the United 
States and around the world. The objectives and proce-
dures of each clinical trial are explained in detail along 
with participant selection criteria and logistical informa-
tion such as locations and contact information.  

For this task we selected 50,109 announcements from 
the roughly 85,000 announcements posted on the Clini-
calTrials.gov site. For selection criteria we relied on the 
following keywords: "heart | cancer | tumor | influenza | 
alzheimer | parkinson | malignant | stroke | respiratory | 
diabetes | pneumonia | nephritis | nephrotic | nephrosis | 
septicemia | liver | cirrhosis | hypertension | renal | neo-
plasm". We chose these keywords because they were 
part of the phrases of diagnoses for the top 12 leading 
causes of death excluding suicide, homicide and acci-
dents (Heron et al., 2009). We limited the selection to 
trials for "Adult" or "Senior" patients.  

After downloading the corpus of XML files we con-
verted them to ANSI text using ABC Amber XML 
Converter3. 49,794 files successfully converted to ANSI 
text format. Using a simple regular expression search 
we selected documents that had both the "Inclusion Cri-
teria" and "Exclusion Criteria" phrases. The final selec-
tion process resulted in 35,385 files. From this latest set 
we randomly selected 100 files to build the corpus for 
our pilot study. One of the authors, who has medical 
training, then manually annotated the three entity types 
in those selected files. We used this annotated set as the 
gold standard to measure the quality of the MTurk 
workers’ annotations.

Biomedical text is full of jargon, and finding the three 
entity types in such text can be difficult for non-expert 
annotators. To make the annotation task more conven-
ient for the MTurk workers, we used a customized user 
interface and provided detailed annotation guidelines. 
We also tested the bonus system available in the MTurk 
environment and evaluated the performance of the 
workers. 

4.1 User Interface 

In order to adapt the task of entity annotation to the 
MTurk format, we used an in-house web-based graphi-
cal user interface that allows the worker to select a span 
of text with the mouse cursor. The interface also uses 
simple tokenization heuristics to divide the text into 
highlightable spans and resolve partial token highlights 
or double-clicks into the next largest span. For instance, 
highlighting the word “cancer” from the second “c” to 
“e” will result in the entire span “cancer” being high-
lighted.  

4.2 Annotation Guidelines 

We created three separate annotation tasks, one for each 
entity type. For each task, we wrote annotation guide-
lines that explained the task and showed examples of 
entities that should be tagged and the ones that should 
not.  

4.3 Bonus System 

MTurk provides two methods for paying workers – 
fixed rates on each document and bonuses to workers 
for especially good work. In this study, we experi-
mented with the bonus system to see its effect on per-
formance and annotation time. Annotating a document 
would receive a base rate of $0.01-$0.05, but each 
tagged entity span could elicit a bonus of $0.01. The 
base rate would cover the case where the document 
truly contained no entities, but the bonus amount could 
potentially be much larger than the base rate if the 
document was entity-rich. Bonuses for each tagged en-
tity span were awarded based on an agreement threshold 
with peer workers. In this study, each document was 
annotated by four workers and we granted bonuses for 
entity spans that were agreed upon by at least three 
workers. 

4.4 Performance Monitoring 

We monitored a worker’s performance by comparing 
the worker’s annotations with his/her peer workers’ 
annotations. After we posted the HITs, we continuously 
monitored the workers’ performance and rejected the 
annotations from the ones who tried to cheat the system 
by either not doing any annotations (e.g., immediately 
submitting the document after accepting it) or con-

181



stantly doing wrong annotations (e.g., always annotating 
the first word of the text). Those rejected documents 
were automatically re-posted on the MTurk so other 
workers could work on them. In this pilot study, per-
formance monitoring was done mainly manually. As 
future work, we plan to automate the process in order to 
scale it for larger annotation tasks. 

4.5 Communication with Workers 

The workers could send us their questions and com-
ments about the individual documents or the general 
annotation task through a text box in the interface. Dur-
ing this study we received more than 100 messages 
from the workers. The majority of the messages were 
positive messages (“thank you”, “easy hit!”). However, 
some of the comments included questions such as: “Is 
pregnancy a medical condition?” or “Text doesn’t men-
tion the type of insulin but I highlighted it because insu-
lin is a medication!”. We responded to the questions in 
a timely manner to increase the quality of annotations.  

5 Annotation Experiments 

In our annotation experiments, each of 100 documents 
in our corpus was annotated by four workers, resulting 
in 100×4=400 files per experiment. We experimented 
with different pay scales to understand how they affect 
the quality and speed of the annotations. 

5.1 Cost of Annotations 

We investigated the cost of annotations both in terms of 
money and time. The summary of the results is in Table 
1. We ran five different MTurk annotation experiments 
for our corpus of 100 documents. A total of 139 workers 
were involved in our experiments, and we identified 
eight of those workers as cheaters and rejected their 
annotation. The remaining workers spent 138.86 hours 
to complete 1872 files. The slowest experiment was 
MedicalCondition-I, in which we paid a base document 
rate of $0.01 without any bonuses. With this pay scale, 
it took 71.16 hours for workers to annotate 272 out of 
400 files. We suspected we could not attract enough 

workers to finish the annotation task on time so we 
stopped the experiment before all 400 files were com-
pleted. When we compiled the results, we noticed that 
there was a general tendency for the workers to tag the 
first one or two entities and then ignore the rest of the 
document. Based on this observation, we decided to add 
bonuses to motivate the workers to read through the 
whole document. We ran the same annotation task, 
MedicalCondition-II, with a higher base document rate 
of $0.05 and a bonus rate of $0.01. With this new pay-
ment scale the annotation task was fully completed in 
7.28 hours.  

We also compared the effect of base rates when the bo-
nus amounts were kept the same. For medication anno-
tations, increasing the base document rate from $0.01 to 
$0.05 decreased the total amount of annotation time 
from 31.65 hours to 4.36 hours and also decreased the 
number of workers from 45 to 17. We ordered the 
workers based on the number files they annotated. The 
top ranked 5 workers in Medication-I annotated 187 
files (46%) and the top ranked 5 workers in Medication-
II annotated 313 files (78%). The difference between 
those two values was interesting since it indicated that 
by increasing the base rate, we managed to attract work-
ers who worked on more documents.  

The average amount of time workers spent per docu-
ment varied based on entity type. They spent the longest 
amount of time for medical condition and shortest 
amount of time for laboratory test. This can be ex-
plained by the richness of documents in terms of enti-
ties. In the manually created gold standard there were 
1159 mentions of medical condition, 518 mentions of 
medication, and 249 mentions of laboratory tests. An-
other observation was that the change in pay scales did 
not affect the average annotation time per document. 

5.2 Quality of Annotations 

We measured the quality of the MTurk annotations at 
different inter-annotator agreement levels by comparing 
the agreed entity spans with the spans in the gold stan-
dard.

There are 100 documents, and each document is  annotated by four workers.)

Given a document annotated by multiple workers and an 
agreement level k, there are different ways of creating a 
new span file that includes only the spans that are 
agreed by at least k workers. One method is to go over 
each span in each annotation and output only the spans 
that are marked by at least k workers. This method does 
not work well when the spans are long and the workers 
could disagree on the boundary. We used an alternative 
method which first goes over each word position in the 
document and marks the positions that are part of spans 
in at least k annotations, and then outputs the spans that 
cover those marked positions. We call the new span file 
agreement-k file. 

Once we have created agreement-k file, we compare it 
with the gold standard to calculate precision, recall, and 
F-measure. A span in agreement-k file and a span in the 
gold standard are called an exact match if they are iden-
tical and are called an overlap match if they overlap 
(exact match is a special case of overlap match). Table 2 
shows the performance for the MedicalCondition-II, 
Medication-II, and LaboratoryTest experiments at dif-
ferent agreement levels (k). As can be seen from the 
table, as the value of k increased, the precision values 
increased and the recall values decreased. For all of the 
experiments, the best F-Score was achieved at agree-
ment-level 2.  

Of the three entity types, laboratory test was the hardest 
partly because laboratory test entities tend to be longer 
(the average length for entities in gold standard was 
5.25 words, compared to 1.84 words for medication and 
3.18 words for medical condition), making the exact 
boundary harder to define. The results for MedicalCon-
dition-II and Medication-II were higher than Laborato-
ryTest. In addition, accuracy for Medication-I (not 
shown here due to space limit) and Medication-II were 
similar, indicating that pay rate did not affect accuracy 
much in our experiments. In the future, we plan to in-
crease the number of annotations for each document, 
which we believe could further improve the perform-
ance.  

6   Conclusion 
Human annotation is crucial for many NLP tasks. In this 
paper, we demonstrated the potential of using MTurk 

for annotating medical text. By continuously monitoring 
the workers’ performance and using the bonus system, 
we acquired high quality annotations from non-expert 
MTurk workers with limited time and budget.  

As future work, we plan to analyze the MTurk annota-
tions in detail in order to understand the problematic 
areas. Based on our observations, we will redesign our 
annotation tasks and continue our experiments with 
MTurk to create large-scale annotated corpora to be 
used in biomedical NLP projects.
