Abstract

We present a weakly-supervised induc-
tion method to assign semantic informa-
tion to food items. We consider two tasks
of categorizations being food-type classi-
fication and the distinction of whether a
food item is composite or not. The cate-
gorizations are induced by a graph-based
algorithm applied on a large unlabeled
domain-specific corpus. We show that the
usage of a domain-specific corpus is vi-
tal. We do not only outperform a manually
designed open-domain ontology but also
prove the usefulness of these categoriza-
tions in relation extraction, outperforming
state-of-the-art features that include syn-
tactic information and Brown clustering.

1 Introduction

In view of the large interest in food in many parts
of the population and the ever increasing amount
of new dishes/food items, there is a need of au-
tomatic knowledge acquisition. We approach this
task with the help of natural language processing.

We investigate different methods to assign cate-
gories to food items. We focus on two categoriza-
tions, being a classification of food items to cat-
egories of the Food Guide Pyramid (U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, 1992) and a categorization of
whether a food item is composite or not.

We present a semi-supervised graph-based ap-
proach to induce these food categorizations from
an unlabeled domain-specific text corpus crawled
from the Web. The method only requires mini-
mal manual guidance for the initialization of the
algorithm with seed terms. It depends, however,
on an automatically constructed high-quality sim-
ilarity graph. For that we choose a pattern-based
representation that outperforms a distributional-
based representation. For initialization, we ex-
amine some manually compiled seed words and

a very few simple surface patterns to automati-
cally induce such expressions. As a hard baseline,
we compare the effectiveness of using a general-
purpose ontology for the same types of categoriza-
tions. Apart from an intrinsic evaluation, we also
examine the categories in relation extraction.

The contributions of this paper are a method re-
quiring minimal supervision for a comprehensive
classification of food items and a proof of con-
cept that the knowledge that can thus be gained is
beneficial for relation extraction. Even though we
focus on a specific domain, the induction method
can be easily translated to other domains. In par-
ticular, other life-style domains, such as fashion,
cosmetics or home & gardening, show parallels
since comparable textual web data are available
and similar relation types (e.g. that two items fit
together or can be substituted by each other) exist.

Our experiments are carried out on German data
but our findings should carry over to other lan-
guages since the issues we address are (mostly)
language universal. For general accessibility, all
examples are given as English translations.

2 Data & Annotation

2.1 Domain-Specific Text Corpus

In order to generate a dataset for our experiments,
we used a crawl of chefkoch.de1 (Wiegand et al.,
2012b) consisting of 418, 558 webpages of food-
related forum entries. chefkoch.de is the largest
German web portal for food-related issues.

2.2 Food Categorization

As a food vocabulary, we employ a list of 1888
food items: 1104 items were directly extracted
from GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997), the
German version of WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
The items were identified by extracting all hy-
ponyms of the synset Nahrung (English: food). By

consulting the relation tuples from Wiegand et al.
(2012c) a further 784 items were added. We man-
ually annotated this vocabulary w.r.t. two tasks:

2.2.1 Task I: Food Types

The food type categories we chose are mainly in-
spired by the Food Guide Pyramid (U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, 1992) that divides food items
into categories with similar nutritional properties.
This categorization scheme not only divides the
set of food items in many intuitive homogeneous
classes but it is also the scheme that is most com-
monly agreed upon. Table 1 lists the specific cat-
egories we use. For category assignment of com-
plex dishes comprising different food items we ap-
plied a heuristics: we always assign the category
that dominates the dish. A meat sauce, for exam-
ple, would thus be assigned MEAT (even though
there may be other ingredients than meat).

2.2.2 Task II: Dishes vs. Atomic Food Items

In addition to Task I, we include another catego-
rization that divides food items into dishes and
atomic food items (Table 2). By dish, we mainly
understand food items that are composite food
items made of other (atomic) food items. This
categorization is orthogonal to the previous clas-
sification of food items. We refrained from adding
dishes as a further category of food types in §2.2.1,
as we would have ended up with a very heteroge-
neous class in the set of homogeneous food type
categories. Thus, dishes that differ greatly in nu-
trient content, such as Waldorf salad and chocolate
cake, would have been subsumed by one class.

3 Method

3.1 Graph-based Induction

We propose a semi-supervised graph-based ap-
proach to label food items with their respective

Class Description Examples Perc.

items among the food vocabulary (gold standard).

food categories. The underlying data structure
is a similarity graph connecting different food
items. Food items that belong to the same category
should be connected by highly weighted edges. In
order to infer the labels for each respective food
item, one first needs to specify a small set of seeds
for each category and then apply a graph-based
clustering method that divides the graph into clus-
ters that represent distinct food categories. Our
method is a low-resource approach that can also
be easily adapted to other domains. The only
domain-specific information required are an unla-
beled corpus and a set of seeds.

3.1.1 Construction of the Similarity Graph

To enable a graph-based induction, we generate a
similarity graph that connects similar food items.
For that purpose, a list of domain-independent
similarity-patterns was compiled. Each pattern is a
lexical sequence that connects the mention of two
food items (Table 3). Each pair of food items ob-
served with any of those patterns is connected via
a weighted edge (the different patterns are treated
equally). The weight is the total frequency of all
patterns co-occurring with a particular food pair.

Due to the high precision of our patterns, with
one or a few prototypical seeds we cannot expect
to find all items of a food category within the set
of items to which the seeds are directly connected.
Instead, one also needs to consider transitive con-
nectedness within the graph. For example, in Fig-
ure 1 banana and redberry are not directly con-
nected but they can be reached via pear or rasp-
berry. However, by considering mediate relation-
ships it becomes more difficult to determine the
most appropriate category for each food item since
most food items are connected to food items of dif-
ferent categories (in Figure 1, there are not only
edges between banana and other types of fruits
but there is also some edge to some sweet, i.e.
chocolate). For a unique class assignment, we ap-
ply a robust graph-based clustering algorithm. (It
will figure out that banana, pear, raspberry and
redberry belong to the same category and choco-
late belongs to another category, since it is mostly

linked to many other food items not being fruits.)

3.1.2 Semi-Supervised Graph Optimization

Our semi-supervised graph optimization (Belkin
and Niyogi, 2004) is a robust algorithm that was
primarily chosen since it only contains few free
parameters to adjust. It is based on two principles:
First, similar data points should be assigned simi-
lar labels, as expressed by a similarity graph of la-
beled and unlabeled data. Second, for labeled data
points the prediction of the learnt classifier should
be consistent with the (actual) gold labels.

We construct a weighted transition matrix W
of the graph by normalization of the matrix with
co-occurrence counts C which we obtain from the
similarity graph (§3.1.1). We use the common
normalization by a power of the degree function
di =

∑
j Cij: it defines Wij =

Cij
dλi d

λ
j

if i 6= j,
and Wii = 0. The normalization weight λ is the
first of two parameters used in our experiments for
semi-supervised graph optimization. For learning
the semi-supervised classifier, we use the method
of Zhou et al. (2004) to find a classifying function
which is sufficiently smooth with respect to both
the structure of unlabeled and labeled points.

Given a set of data points X = {x1, . . . , xn}
and label set L = {1, . . . , c}, with xi:1≤i≤l labeled
as yi ∈ L and xi:l+1≤i≤n unlabeled. For predic-
tion, a vectorial function F : X → Rc is estimated
assigning a vector Fi of label scores to every xi.
The predicted labeling follows from these scores
as ŷi = arg maxj≤c Fij . Conversely, the gold la-
beling matrix Y is a n × c matrix with Yij = 1 if
xi is labeled as yi = j and Yij = 0 otherwise.

Minimizing the cost function Q aims at a trade-
off between information from neighbours and ini-
tial labeling information, controlled by parameter

where δi is the degree function of W .
The first term inQ is the smoothness constraint,

its minimization leads to adjacent edges having
similar labels. The second term is the fitting con-
straint, its minimization leads to consistency of the
function F with the labeling of the data. The solu-
tion to the above cost function is found by solving
a system of linear equations (Zhou et al., 2004).

As we do not possess development data for this
work, we set the two free parameters λ = 0.5 and
µ = 0.01. This setting is used for both induction
tasks and all configurations. It is a setting that pro-
vided reasonable results without any notable bias
for any particular configuration we examine.

3.1.3 Manually vs. Automatically Extracted
Seeds

We explore two types of seed initializations: (a)
a manually compiled list of seed food items and
(b) a small set of patterns (Table 4) by the help of
which such seeds are automatically extracted.

In order to extract seeds for Task I with the
pattern-based approach, we apply the patterns
from Hearst (1992). These patterns have been de-
signed for the acquisition of hyponyms. Task I can
also be regarded as some type of hyponym extrac-
tion. The food types (fruit, meat, sweets) repre-
sent the hypernyms for which we extract seed hy-
ponyms (banana, beef, chocolate).

In order to extract seeds for Task II, we apply
two domain-specific sets of patterns (pattdish and
pattatom). We rank the food items according to the
frequency of occurring with the respective pattern
set. Since food items may occur in both rankings,
we merge the two rankings in the following way:
score(food item) = #pattdish(food it.)−#pattatom(food it.)

The top end of this ranking represents dishes
while the bottom end represents atoms.

3.2 Using a General-Purpose Ontology

As a hard baseline, we also make use of the seman-
tic relationships encoded in GermaNet. Our two

675



types of food categorization schemes can be ap-
proximated with the hypernymy graph in that on-
tology: We manually identify nodes that resemble
our food categories (e.g. fruit, meat or dish) and
label any food item that is an immediate or a me-
diate hyponym of these nodes (e.g. apple for fruit)
with the respective category label. The downside
of this method is that a large amount of food items
is missing from the GermaNet-database (§2.2).

3.3 Other Baselines & Post-Processing

In addition to the previous methods we imple-
ment a heuristic baseline (HEUR) that rests on the
observation that German food items of the same
food category often share the same suffix, e.g.
Schokoladenkuchen (English: chocolate cake) and
Apfelkuchen (English: apple pie). For HEUR, we
manually compiled a set of few typical suffixes for
each food type/dish category (ranging from 3 to 8
suffixes per category). For classification of a food
item, we assign the food item the category label
whose suffix matched with the food item.2

We also examine an unsupervised baseline
(UNSUP) that applies spectral clustering on the
similarity graph following von Luxburg (2007):

• Input: a similarity matrix W and the number of categories to detect k.
• The laplacian L is constructed from W . It is the symmetric laplacian

L = I − D1/2WD1/2 , where D is a diagonal degree matrix.3
• A matrix U ∈ Rn×k is constructed that contains as columns the first

k eigenvectors u1, . . . , uk of L.
• The rows of U are interpreted as the new data points. The final cluster-

ing is obtained by k-means clustering of the rows of U .

UNSUP (which is completely parameter-free)
gives some indication about the intrinsic expres-
siveness of the similarity graph as it lacks any
guidance towards the categories to be predicted.

In graph-based food categorization, one can
only make predictions for food items that are con-
nected (be it directly or indirectly) to seed food
items within the similarity graph. To expand labels
to unconnected food items, we apply some post-
processing (POSTP). Similarly to HEUR, it ex-
ploits the suffix-similarity of food items. It assigns
each unconnected food item the label of the food
item (that could be labeled by the graph optimiza-
tion) that shares the longest suffix. Due to their
similar nature, we refrain from applying POSTP
on HEUR as it would produce no changes.

2Unlike German food items, English food items are of-
ten multi-word expressions. Therefore, we assume that for
English, instead of analyzing suffixes the usage of the head
of a multiword expression (i.e. chocolate cake) would be an
appropriate basis for a similar heuristic.

3That is, Dii equals to the sum of the ith row.

4.1 Evaluation of Food Categorization

4.1.1 Detection of Food Types

Table 5 compares different classifiers and configu-
rations for the prediction of food types (against the
gold standard from Table 1). Apart from the pre-
viously described baselines, we consider n man-
ually selected prototypes (n-PROTO) and the top
n food items produced by Hearst-patterns (PAT-
Topn) as seeds for graph-based optimization. The
table shows that the semi-supervised graph-based
approach with these seeds outperforms the base-
lines UNSUP and HEUR. Only as few as 5
prototypical seeds (per category) are required to
obtain performance that is even better than us-
ing plain GermaNet. The table also shows that
post-processing (with our suffix-heuristics) con-
sistently improves performance. Manually choos-
ing prototypes is more effective than instantiating
seeds via Hearst-patterns. The quality of the out-
put of Hearst-patterns degrades from top 10 on-
wards. However, considering that PAT-Topn does
not include any manual intervention, it already
produces decent results. Finally, even GermaNet
can be effectively used as seeds.

heterogeneous classes which is why more seeds
are required for initialization. This means that
we cannot look for prototypes. For simplicity,
we resorted to randomly sample seeds from our
gold standard (RAND-n). For HEUR, we could
not find a small and intuitive set of suffixes that
are shared by many atomic food types, therefore
we considered all food types from our vocabulary
whose suffix did not match a typical dish suffix as
atomic. As this leaves no unspecified food items in
our vocabulary, we cannot use the output of HEUR
as seeds for graph-based optimization.

In contrast to the previous experiment, HEUR is
a more robust baseline. But again, post-processing
mostly improves performance, and patterns are not
as good as manual (random) seeds yet the former
are notably better than HEUR w.r.t. F-Score. Un-
like in the food-type classification, graph-based
optimization applied on GermaNet does not result
in some improvement. We assume that the preci-
sion of plain GermaNet with 81.3% is too low.5

Since GermaNet cannot effectively be used as
seeds for the graph-based optimization and post-
processing has already a strong positive effect, we
may wonder how effective the actual graph-based

5For other seeds for which it worked, we usually mea-
sured a precision of 90% or higher.

optimization is for this classification task. Af-
ter all, significantly more seeds are required for
this classification task than for the previous task,
so we need to show that it is not the mere seeds
(+post-processing) that are required for a reason-
able categorization. Table 7 examines two key
configurations with and without graph-based op-
timization. It shows that also for this classification
task, graph-based optimization produces a catego-
rization superior to the mere seeds. Moreover, the
suffix-based post-processing is complementary to
the improvement by the graph-based optimization.

4.1.3 Comparison of Initialization Methods

Table 8 compares for each food type 5 manually
selected prototypical seeds (i.e. 5-PROTO) and
the 5 food items most frequently been observed
with patthearst (Table 4). While the manually cho-
sen seeds represent the spectrum of food items
within each particular class (e.g. for STARCH,
some type of pasta, rice and potato was chosen),
it is not possible to enforce such diversity with
the automatically extracted seeds. However, most
food items are correct. Table 9 displays the 10
most highly ranked dishes and atomic food items
extracted with pattdish and pattatom (Table 4). Un-
like the previous task (Table 8), we obtain more
heterogeneous seeds within the same class.

4.1.4 Distributional Similarity

Since many recent methods for related tasks, such
as noun classification, are based on so-called dis-
tributional similarity (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997;
Lin, 1998; Snow et al., 2004; Weeds et al., 2004;
Yamada et al., 2009; Huang and Riloff, 2010;
Lenci and Benotto, 2012), we also examine this as
an alternative representation to the pattern-based
similarity graph (Table 3). We represent each food
item as a vector which itself is an aggregate of
the contexts of all mentions of a particular food
item. We weighted the individual (context) words
co-occurring with the food item at a fixed window
size of 5 words with tf-idf. We can now apply
graph-based optimization on the similarity matrix
encoding the cosine similarities between any pos-
sible pair of vectors representing two food items.
As seeds, we use the best configuration (not em-
ploying GermaNet), i.e. 10-PROTO for food type
classification and RAND-100 for the dish classi-
fication. Since, however, the graph clustering is
not actually necessary, as we have a full similar-
ity matrix (rather than a sparse graph) that also al-

lows us to compare any arbitrary pair of food items
directly, we also employ a second classifier (for
comparison) based on the nearest neighbour prin-
ciple. We assign each food item the label of the
most similar seed food item.

Table 10 compares these two classifiers with the
best previous result. It shows that the pattern-
based representation consistently outperforms the
distributional representation. The former may be
sparse but it produces high-precision similarity
links.6 The vector representation, on the other
hand, may not be sparse but it contains a high
degree of noise. The major problem is that not
only vectors of similar food items, such as chips
(fries), potatoes and rice, are similar to each other,
but also vectors of different food items that are
typically consumed with each other (e.g. fish
and chips). This is because of their frequent co-
occurrence (as in collocations like fish & chips).
Unfortunately, these pairs belong to different food
types. For the dish classification, however, the
vector representation is less of a problem.7

The distributional representation works better
with the simple nearest neighbour classifier. We
assume that graph-based optimization adds further
noise to the classification since, unlike the nearest
neighbour which only calculates the direct similar-
ity between two vectors, it also incorporates indi-
rect relationships (which may be more error-prone
than the direct relationships) between food items.

4.1.5 Do we need a domain-specific corpus?

In this section, we want to provide evidence that
apart from the similarity graph and seeds the tex-
tual source for the graph, i.e. our domain-specific

6By the label propagation within the graph-based opti-
mization, the sparsity problem is also mitigated.

7Fish and chips are both atoms, so in the dish classifica-
tion, it is no mistake to consider them similar food items.

corpus (chefkoch.de), is also important. For that
purpose, we compare our current corpus against
an open-domain corpus. We consider the German
version of Wikipedia since this resource also con-
tains encyclopedic knowledge about food items.
Table 11 compares the graph-based induction. As
in the previous section, we only consider the best
previous configuration. The table clearly shows
that our domain-specific text corpus is a more ef-
fective resource for our purpose than Wikipedia.

4.2 Evaluation for Relation Extraction

We now examine whether automatic food cate-
gorization can be harnessed for relation extrac-
tion. The task is to detect instances of the relation
types SuitsTo, SubstitutedBy and IngredientOf in-
troduced Wiegand et al. (2012b) (repeated in Ta-
ble 12) and motivated in Wiegand et al. (2012a).
These relation types are highly relevant for cus-
tomer advice/product recommendation. In partic-
ular, SuitsTo and SubstitutedBy are fairly domain-
independent relation types. Customers want to

know which items can be used together (SuitsTo),
be it two food items that can be used as a meal
or two fashion items that can be worn together.
Substitutes are also relevant for situations in which
item A is out of stock but item B can be offered as
an alternative. Therefore, insights from this work
should carry over to other domains.

We randomly extracted 1500 sentences from
our text corpus (§2.1) in which (at least) two food
items co-occur. Each food pair mention was man-
ually assigned one label. In addition to the three
relation types from above, we introduce the la-
bel Other for cases in which either another rela-
tion between the target food items is expressed or
the co-occurrence is co-incidental. On a subset of
200 sentences, we measured a substantial inter-
annotation agreement of Cohen’s κ = 0.67 (Lan-
dis and Koch, 1977).

We train a supervised classifier and incorporate
the knowledge induced from our domain-specific
corpus as features. We chose Support Vector Ma-
chines with 5-fold cross-validation using SVMlight-
multi-class (Joachims, 1999).

Table 13 displays all features that we examine
for supervised classification. Most features are
widely used throughout different NLP tasks. One
special feature brown takes into consideration the
output of Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992)
which like our graph-based optimization produces
a corpus-driven categorization of words. Simi-
lar to UNSUP, this method is unsupervised but it
considers the entire vocabulary of our text corpus
rather than only food items. Therefore, this in-
formation can be considered as a generalization
of all contextual words. Such type of informa-
tion has been shown to be useful for named-entity
recognition (Turian et al., 2010) and relation ex-
traction (Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

For syntactic parsing, Stanford Parser (Rafferty
and Manning, 2008) was used. For Brown cluster-
ing, the SRILM-toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) was used.
Following Turian et al. (2010), we induced 1000
clusters (from our domain-specific corpus §2.1).

4.2.1 Why should food categories be helpful
for relation extraction?

All relation types we consider comprise pairs of
two food items which makes these relation types
likely to be confused. Contextual information may
be used for disambiguation but there may also be
frequent contexts that are not sufficiently informa-
tive. For example, 25% of the instances of Ingre-

PLAIN +POSTP

dientOf follow the lexical pattern food item1 with
food item2 (1). However, the same pattern also
covers 15% of the instances of SuitsTo (2).

(1) We had a stew with red lentils. (Relation: IngredientOf)
(2) We had salmon with broccoli. (Relation: SuitsTo)

The food type information we learned from our
text corpus might tell us which of the food items
are dishes. Only in (1), there is a dish, i.e. stew.
So, one may infer that the presence of dishes is
indicative of IngredientOf rather than SuitsTo.

food item1 and food item2 is another ambigu-
ous context. It cannot only be observed with the
relation SuitsTo, as in (3) (66% of all instantia-
tions of that pattern), but also SubstitutedBy (20%
of all mentions of that relation match that pattern),
as in (4). For SuitsTo, two food items that belong
to two different classes (e.g. MEAT and STARCH
or MEAT and VEGE) are quite characteristic. For
SubstitutedBy, the two food items are very often of
the same category of the Food Guide Pyramid.

(3) I very often eat fish and chips. (Relation: SuitsTo)
(4) For these types of dishes you can offer both Burgundy wine and

Champagne. (Relation: SubstitutedBy)

Since the second ambiguous context involves
the two general relation types SuitsTo and Substi-
tutedBy, resolving this ambiguity with automati-
cally induced type information has some signifi-
cance for other domains. In particular, for other
life-style domains, domain-specific type informa-
tion could be obtained following our method from
§3.1. The disambiguation rule that two entities of
the same type imply SubstitutedBy otherwise they
imply SuitsTo should also be widely applicable.

4.2.2 Results

Table 14 displays the performance of the different
feature sets for relation extraction. The features
designed from graph-based induction (i.e. graph)
work slightly better than GermaNet. The perfor-
mance of patt is not impressively high. However,
one should consider that patt can be used directly
without a supervised classifier (as each pattern is

read off from the matching pattern which class is

it is dependent on supervised learning.

The only feature that individually manages to
significantly outperform word is graph. The tra-
ditional features (i.e. pos, synt and brown) only
produce some mild improvement when added
jointly to word along some conjunctive fea-
tures. When graph is added to this feature set
(i.e. word+patt+pos+synt+brown+conj), we ob-
tain another significant improvement. In con-
clusion, the information we induced from our
domain-specific corpus cannot be obtained by
other NLP-features, including other state-of-the-
art induction methods such as Brown clustering.

5 Related Work

While many of the previous works on noun catego-
rization also address the task of hypernym classifi-
cation (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Widdows,
2003; Kozareva et al., 2008; Huang and Riloff,
2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012) and some include
examples involving food items (Widdows and
Dorow, 2002; Cederberg and Widdows, 2003),
only van Hage et al. (2005) and van Hage et al.
(2006) specifically focus on the classification of
food items. van Hage et al. (2005) deal with on-
tology mapping whereas van Hage et al. (2006)
explore part-whole relations.

The task of data-driven lexicon expansion has
also been explored before (Kanayama and Na-
sukawa, 2006; Das and Smith, 2012), however,
our paper presents the first attempt to carry out
a comprehensive categorization for the food do-
main. For the first time, we also show that type
information can effectively improve the extraction
of very common relations. For the twitter domain,
the usage of type information based on cluster-
ing has already been found effective for supervised
learning (Bergsma et al., 2013).

6 Conclusion

We presented an induction method to assign se-
mantic information to food items. We considered
two types of categorizations being food-type infor-
mation and information about whether a food item
is composite or not. The categorization is induced
by graph-based optimization applied on a large
unlabeled domain-specific text corpus. We pro-
duce categorizations that outperform a manually
compiled resource. The usage of such a domain-
specific corpus based on a pattern-based represen-
tation is vital and largely outperforms other text
corpora or a distributional representation. The in-
duced knowledge improves relation extraction.
