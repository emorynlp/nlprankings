Abstract

In our participation on the task we wanted to test three different kinds of relatedness algorithms:
one based on embeddings induced from corpora, another based on random walks on WordNet
and a last one based on random walks based on Wikipedia. All three of them perform similarly
in noun relatedness datasets like WordSim353, close to the highest reported values. Although
the task definition gave examples of nouns, the train and test data were based on the Edinburgh
Association Thesaurus, and around 50% of the target words were not nouns. The corpus-based
algorithm performed much better than the other methods in the training dataset, and was thus
submitted for the test.

1 Introduction

Measuring semantic similarity and relatedness between terms is an important problem in lexical seman-
tics (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). It has applications in many natural language processing tasks, such as
Textual Entailment, Word Sense Disambiguation or Information Extraction, and other related areas like
Information Retrieval. Most of the proposed techniques are evaluated over manually curated word simi-
larity datasets like WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002), in which the weights returned by the systems
for word pairs are compared with human ratings.

The techniques used to solve this problem can be roughly classified into two main categories: those
relying on pre-existing knowledge resources (thesauri, semantic networks, taxonomies or encyclopedias)
(Alvarez and Lim, 2007; Yang and Powers, 2005; Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Agirre et al., 2009; Agirre
et al., 2010) and those inducing distributional properties of words from corpora (Sahami and Heilman,
2006; Chen et al., 2006; Bollegala et al., 2007; Agirre et al., 2009; Mikolov et al., 2013).

Our main objective when participating in the CogAlex shared task was to check how a sample of each
kind of technique would cope with the task. We thus selected one of the best corpus-based models to
date and another approach based on random walks over WordNet and Wikipedia.

2 Word Embeddings

Neural Networks have become quite a useful tool in NLP on the last years, specially in semantics. A
lot of models have been developed, but all of them share two characteristics: they learn meaning from
non-labeled corpora and represent meaning in a distributional way. These models learn the meaning of
words from corpora, and they represent it distributionally by the so-called embeddings. This embeddings
are low-dimensional and dense vectors composed by integers, where the dimensions are latent semantic
features of words.

We have used the Mikolov model (Mikolov et al., 2013) for this task, due to its effectiveness in
similarity experiments (Baroni et al., 2014). This neural network reduces the computational complexity
of previous architectures by deleting the hidden layer, and also, it’s able to train with larger corpora (more
than 109 words) and extract embeddings with larger dimensionality.

The Mikolov model has two variants: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. The first
one is quite similar to the feedforward Neural Net Language Model, but instead of a hidden layer it has
a projection layer; so, all the words are projected in the same position. Word order has thus no influence
in the projection. Training criterion is as follows: knowing past and future words, it will predict the one
in the middle.

The Skip-gram model is related to the previous one. The main difference is that it uses each current
word as an input to a log-linear classifier with a continuous projection layer, and predicts words within a
certain range before and after the current word.

In order to participate in this shared task, we have used the word2vec tool1. On the one hand, we
have used embeddings trained with the Skip-gram model on part of Google News corpus (about 100
billion words). The vectors have 300 dimensions and are publicly available2. On the other hand, we have
adapted the distance program in word2vec, so that its input is the test-set file of the shared task. The
way distance works is as follows:

• Reads all the vectors from the embeddings file, and stores them in memory.
• Reads the test-set file, and line by line

– Saves the five entry words if they exist in vocabulary.
– Dimension by dimension, sums five entries’ embeddings into one vector, and normalizes it.
– Calculates the semantic distance from the normalized vector to all words in vocabulary, and

selects the closest ones.
– Writes in output file the closest words along with their distances, writing the closest word first.

3 Random Walks on Wikipedia

In the last year there have been many attempts to apply graph based techniques to many NLP problems,
including word sense disambiguation (Agirre et al., 2014) or measuring semantic similarity and related-
ness between terms (Agirre et al., 2009). Those techniques consider a given Knowledge Base (KB) as a
graph, where vertices represent KB concepts and relations among concepts are represented by edges.

For this particular task we represented WikiPedia as a graph, where articles are the vertices and
links between articles are the edges. Contrary to other work using Wikipedia links (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008), the use of the whole graph allows to apply algorithms that
take into account the whole structure of Wikipedia. We applied PageRank and Personalized PageRank
on the Wikipedia graph using freely available software (Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Agirre et al., 2014)3.

The PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) ranks the vertices in a graph according to their relative
structural importance. The main idea of PageRank is that whenever a link from vi to vj exists in a graph,
a vote from node i to node j is produced, and hence the rank of node j increases. Besides, the strength of
the vote from i to j also depends on the rank of node i: the more important node i is, the more strength
its votes will have. Alternatively, PageRank can also be viewed as the result of a random walk process,
where the final rank of node i represents the probability of a random walk over the graph ending on node
i, at a sufficiently large time. Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002) is a variant of the PageRank
algorithm which biases the computation to prefer certain nodes of the graph.

Our method also needs a dictionary, an association between strings and Wikipedia articles. We con-
struct the dictionary using article titles, redirections, disambiguation pages, and anchor text extracted
from a Wikipedia dump4. Mentions are lowercased and all text between parenthesis is removed. If the
mention links to a disambiguation page, it is associated with all possible articles the disambiguation page
points to. Each association between a string and article is scored with the prior probability, estimated as
the number of times that the mention occurs in the anchor text of an article divided by the total number
of occurrences of the mention.

The method to compute the answer for a given set of words is very simple. We just compute the
Personalized PageRank algorithm over Wikipedia, initializing the walk using the set of given words,
obtaining a probability distribution over all Wikipedia articles. We then choose the article with maximum
probability, and return the title of the article as the expected answer.

Regarding PageRank implementation details, we chose a damping value of 0.85 and finish the calcu-
lation after 30 iterations. Some preliminary experiments on a related Word Sense Disambiguation task
indicated that the algorithm was quite robust to these values, and we did not optimize them.

4 Development results

After running the random walks algorithms on the development data, it was clear that WordNet and
Wikipedia were not sufficient resources for the task, and they were performing poorly. The embeddings,
on the other hand, were doing a good job (accuracy of 14.1%, having returned a word on 1907 of the
2000 train instances). This is in contradiction with the results obtained in word relatedness datasets: for
instance, in the WordSim353 dataset (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) we obtain Spearman correla-
tions of 68.5 using random walks on WordNet, 72.8 using random walks on Wikipedia, and 71.0 using
the embeddings.

One important difference between datasets like WordSim353 and the CogCalex data, is that in Word-
Sim353, all words are nouns in singular. From a small sample of the CogaLex training data, on the
contrary, we saw that only around 50% of the target words5 are nouns, with many occurrences of gram-
matical words, and words in plural. Wikipedia only contains nouns, and even if WordNet contains verbs
and adjectives, the semantic relations that we use are not able to check whether a meaning should be
lexicalized as an adjective (absent in the dataset) or noun (absence). Note also that the random walk
algorithm does not use co-occurrence data, and as such it is not able to capture that absent and minded
are closely related as in “absent minded”.

These differences between the WordSim 353 and the CogaLex data would explain the different be-
haviour of the algorithms. We would also like to mention that the definition of the task mentioned
examples which are closer to the capabilities of WordNet and Wikipedia (e.g. given a set of words like
“gin, drink, scotch, bottle and soda” the expected answer would be whisky). From the definition of the
task, it looked as if the task was about recovering a word given a definition (as in dictionaries), but the
actual data was based on the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus, which is a different kind of resource.

5 Test results

Given the development much better results of the embeddings, we submitted a run based on those. We
obtained 16.35% accuracy, ranking fourth in the evaluation of all twelve submissions.

6 Conclusions

We tested three different kinds of relatedness algorithms: one based on embeddings induced from cor-
pora, another based on random walks on WordNet and a last one based on random walks based on
Wikipedia. All three of them perform similarly in noun relatedness datasets like WordSim353. Although
the task definition gave examples of content nouns alone, the train and test data were based on the Ed-
inburgh Association Thesaurus, and only around 50% of the target words were nouns. The embedding
performed much better than the other methods in this dataset.
