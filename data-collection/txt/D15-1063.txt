Abstract

Temporal taggers are usually developed
for a certain language. Besides English,
only few languages have been addressed,
and only the temporal tagger HeidelTime
covers several languages. While this
tool was manually extended to these lan-
guages, there have been earlier approaches
for automatic extensions to a single tar-
get language. In this paper, we present an
approach to extend HeidelTime to all lan-
guages in the world. Our evaluation shows
promising results, in particular consider-
ing that our approach neither requires lan-
guage skills nor training data, but results
in a baseline tagger for 200+ languages.

1 Introduction & Related Work

Temporal tagging (the extraction and normaliza-
tion of temporal expressions) is a crucial task in
NLP, and many applications can benefit from tem-
poral information, e.g., in the context of question
answering and information retrieval (Campos et
al., 2014). Thus, there has been a lot of research
during the last years addressing temporal infor-
mation extraction, as reflected by manually an-
notated corpora, approaches to temporal tagging,
and research challenges such as the TempEval se-
ries (Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013).

While, in the meantime, the range of anno-
tated corpora covers several languages different
from English, e.g., the French, Portuguese, Ital-
ian, and Romanian TimeBank corpora (Bittar et
al., 2011; Costa and Branco, 2012; Caselli et al.,
2011; Forascu and Tufis, 2012), most approaches
to temporal tagging focus on processing English
text, e.g., DANTE (Mazur and Dale, 2009; Mazur,
2012) and SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012).
Of course, exceptions exist, e.g., TipSem for En-
glish and Spanish (Llorens et al., 2010), and Hei-
delTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013) even covers

13 languages. However, it required a lot of man-
ual effort to extend HeidelTime, and researchers
of different institutes and countries have been in-
volved for German (Strötgen and Gertz, 2011),
Dutch (van de Camp and Christiansen, 2012),
Spanish (Strötgen et al., 2013), French (Moriceau
and Tannier, 2014), Croatian (Skukan et al., 2014),
Vietnamese and Arabic (Strötgen et al., 2014),
Italian (Manfredi et al., 2014), Chinese (Li et al.,
2014), Russian, Estonian, and Portuguese.

Obviously, it is possible to manually extend
HeidelTime and thus a temporal tagger in general.
However, each language is typically addressed
separately, and the extension process is time- and
labor-intensive, so that a method to automate this
process is desirable. While there have been earlier
approaches for automatic extensions of temporal
taggers to further languages (Saquete et al., 2004;
Negri et al., 2006; Spreyer and Frank, 2008), these
were limited to a few languages and the results
were considered less successful, in particular for
the normalization subtask. In contrast, Angeli
and Uszkoreit (2013) presented an approach to
language-independent parsing of temporal expres-
sions, however, addressing only the normalization
and not the extraction subtask.

In this paper, we re-address the task of automat-
ically extending a temporal tagger to further lan-
guages. In contrast to previous work, we address
both subtasks of temporal tagging, i.e., the extrac-
tion and the normalization, and we do not limit our
work to a few selected languages, but we aim at
extending HeidelTime to cover all languages in the
world. In addition of making use of automatic pat-
tern translations based on Wiktionary,1 we allow
for fuzzy matching in the newly addressed lan-
guages. This strategy results in promising tempo-
ral tagging quality for many languages, although
our evaluations show that the quality of a manu-
ally extended temporal tagger is not reached, and

that there are open issues that need to be addressed
for specific language characteristics.

By making our newly developed resources pub-
licly available, we establish a baseline temporal
tagger for basically all languages in the world – for
comparison or as starting point for improvements.

2 HeidelTime

HeidelTime is a rule-based, domain-sensitive, and
publicly available temporal tagger that was de-
veloped with multilinguality in mind so that the
source code and language-dependent resources
are strictly separated, and it can be extended
to new languages without modifying its source
code (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013).

2.1 Input and Output Format

As input, HeidelTime requires linguistic prepro-
cessed documents with sentence, token, and part-
of-speech (pos) information – although it is possi-
ble to create language resources not making use of
pos constraints. For processing news-style docu-
ments, a publication date is additionally needed.

Temporal expressions are annotated following
the temporal markup language TimeML (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2005) using TIMEX3 tags with nor-
malization attributes, most importantly type (date,
time, duration, set) and value to represent the main
semantics of expressions in standard format.

2.2 Language-dependent Resources

Each language requires its own language resources
consisting of patterns, normalization information
and rules. Pattern files contain terms that are fre-
quently used to form temporal expressions, e.g.,
for names of months and weekdays or numbers
that may refer to a day or year. Regular expres-
sions can be used in the pattern files, and each pat-
tern file is interpreted as a regular expression pat-
tern, which can be called by HeidelTime’s rules.

Normalization files contain normalized infor-
mation for patterns defined in the pattern files, e.g.,
that the value of “January” is “01” and that “3” has
to be normalized to “03” in case it refers to a day
or a month and to “3” in case it refers to a duration.

Finally, for the four types of temporal expres-
sions (date, time, duration, and set), a rule file con-
tains all rules for respective expressions. In ad-
dition to a rule name, the extraction part and the
value normalization part are obligatory. The for-
mer is a regular expression that may contain any

number of references to pattern files, and in the lat-
ter, normalization functions are called to normal-
ize respective parts of the extracted expressions. In
addition, part-of-speech constraints can be spec-
ified, negative rules can be formulated, and off-
set information can be set, e.g., if parts of the ex-
tracted patterns are required context information
during the extraction process but not part of the
temporal expression itself.2

2.3 Manual Extension to a New Language

So far, HeidelTime resources for newly supported
languages have been manually created (cf. refer-
ences is Section 1). For this, the following steps
had to be completed: (i) linguistic preprocessing
for the new language has been provided, (ii) all
patterns in the pattern and normalization files have
been manually translated, and (iii) rules have been
developed iteratively. Starting with simple rules
of the source language (typically English), rules
have been adapted and added based on false nega-
tives, false positives, partial matches and incorrect
value normalizations on the training data for the
new language. Then, more complex rules of the
source language have been addressed step-by-step.

Note that tasks (ii) and (iii) have been carried
out by language experts, and task (iii) was per-
formed until no further improvements could be
achieved on the training data. In addition to the
fact that this process is time- and labor inten-
sive, further disadvantages are that a language ex-
pert and temporally annotated training data are re-
quired. Finally, languages are typically addressed
by different researchers with differing effort so
that quality and completeness varies.

3 Automatic Extension to All Languages

In this section, we present the steps of our auto-
matic extension approach in detail. A graphical
summary of our approach is depicted in Figure 1.

3.1 Linguistic Preprocessing

While part-of-speech (pos) information can be
helpful to write more general rules and to improve
temporal tagging quality, there is no pos tagger
covering all languages in the world. In addition,

2While these explanations are necessary to understand
our automated resource development approach that will
be presented in Section 3, for further details about Hei-
delTime and its language-dependent resources we refer

com/HeidelTime/heideltime.

              (iv) extract translations and fill pattern and normalization files

Figure 1: Graphical overview of the automated resource development process. Resources A and C are
directly added to the resources of all languages; resource B is processed following steps (i) to (iv).

the only obligatory linguistic preprocessing steps
are sentence splitting and tokenization. Thus, we
write a simple and generic, language-independent
sentence splitter and tokenizer, which we use for
all languages. Note that our tokenization is based
on a white-space token boundary assumption so
that we have to take care of languages without
such token boundaries separately (cf. Section 4).

3.2 Language-independent Resources
Some patterns and normalization information are
valid for all (many) languages, e.g., numbers for
days and months. For such patterns, we write
language-independent pattern and normalization
resources (Figure 1, A). These do not contain
language-dependent terms and will be part of the
resources for each of the languages in the world.

3.3 Simplified English Resources
The main goal of the simplified English resources
is to make HeidelTime’s original English re-
sources amenable to automatic translation. Thus,
rules are addressed in a language-independent
fashion (cf. Section 3.4), and the simplified En-
glish resources (Figure 1, B) are written as normal-
ization files, from which pattern and normalization
files for all languages are derived (Figure 1, i-iv).

For terms directly occurring in English rules,
new pattern files are created, and all English
patterns are written without regular expressions.
While this makes the resources longer (original
patterns with regular expressions are expanded to
many patterns), these simplified resources are nec-
essary for a smooth translation process.

3.4 Language-independent Rules
Based on HeidelTime’s English resources, we also
write completely language-independent rules for
date, time, duration, and set expressions. In addi-
tion, we add “creative” rules that are not necessary
for English expressions but might match expres-
sions in other languages. In particular, we allow
several orderings of patterns and sometimes even
random tokens in between. For instance, instead
of just a “month day” pattern (e.g., to match “Jan-
uary 13”), we add “day month”, “day X month”
and “month X day”, with “X” matching any token
(e.g., for the Spanish translation “13 de enero”).

In the extraction and normalization parts of the
rules, we refer to the names of the language-
independent and simplified English pattern and
normalization files. Note that in contrast to the
original rules, these rules do neither contain pos
constraints nor any English terms to guarantee
language independence. However, fuzzy pattern
matching is allowed at the end of some patterns to
try to take care of morphology-rich languages.

3.5 Creating Resources for All Languages
As shown in Figure 1, the patterns of the sim-
plified English resources are translated to all lan-
guages in the world using Wiktionary as transla-
tion resource. For each normalization file, the re-
spective pattern and normalization files for each
language in Wiktionary are created (i).3 Then,

3Note that Wiktionary exists in about 170 lan-
guages but contains translations to many more languages;

the patterns are extracted from the simplified En-
glish normalization resources (ii) and the respec-
tive Wiktionary pages are accessed (iii). These
contain translation information that is then added
to the pattern and normalization files of the oc-
curring languages by extracting respective trans-
lations (iv).

Note that for ambiguous words, Wiktionary
contains one translation table for each meaning.
For instance, there are two translation tables for
“November” for the meanings “eleventh month
of the Gregorian calendar” and “N in the ICAO
spelling alphabet”.4 Obviously, it is crucial to
use only the translations of the intended meaning.
Thus, in the case of multiple meanings of English
patterns, we provide the names of Wiktionary’s
correct translation tables to our translation script,
so that only translations of the correct meaning are
generated. In addition, if patterns in the new lan-
guage start with a lower case character, we allow
upper case and lower case for the respective char-
acter as shown in Figure 1, (iv).

Unfortunately, Wiktionary is of course not com-
plete and does not contain translations to all lan-
guages for all English patterns. However, to al-
low backtracking, we add the English information
to the resource files of all languages. If, at a later
point, the automatically created resources are used
as basis for developing better resources for spe-
cific languages, missing translations can be easily
detected and manually added.

November#Translations.

3.6 Improving and Finalizing the Resources
In particular for the rule development process, we
also create the automatic resources for English.
These are repeatedly evaluated on the tempo-
rally annotated English corpora TimeBank (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003), TempEval-3 platinum (Uz-
Zaman et al., 2013), and WikiWars (Mazur and
Dale, 2010). Analyzing the errors on these cor-
pora, we iteratively improve the simplified English
resources and the rules. In Table 1, we compare
HeidelTime’s original English resources (Heidel-
Time 1.9) with the simplified resources (Heidel-
Time – automatic). While details about evaluation
measures will be described in Section 4, the results
of the automatic approach are obviously lower, as
expected due to the simplification process.

Resources for all languages are finally built by
combining the language-independent resources,
the automatically created pattern and normaliza-
tion files, and the language-independent rules.
Note that depending on the completeness of Wik-
tionary, the coverage of the resources – and thus
also their quality – varies between languages.

4 Evaluation

For a subset of languages, temporally annotated
corpora exist. Thus, we can directly evaluate our
approach for these languages. For German, Span-
ish, Italian, French, Portuguese, Croatian, Arabic,
Vietnamese, and Chinese, we compare our auto-
matic approach with HeidelTime’s manually de-
veloped resources. In addition, first results are re-
ported for Romanian.

Figure 2: Language completeness statistics showing how many of the simplified English patterns have
translations in Wiktionary for the 238 languages with at least 10% coverage (ordered based on “all
patterns” coverage). A detailed plot with all language names is available on HeidelTime’s GitHub page.

For all other languages, it is obviously difficult
to judge the temporal tagging quality of the newly
developed resources. However, for an estimation
of the quality for languages without temporally an-
notated corpora, we provide completeness statis-
tics of the pattern translations. The fewer transla-
tions are available for a language, the more likely
it is that the temporal tagging quality is rather low.

4.1 Evaluation Measures

Since the task of temporal tagging is two-fold, we
report precision, recall, and F1-score for the ex-
traction task, and for the full task (relaxed extrac-
tion plus value normalization) value F1. Simi-
lar as the TempEval-3 organizers (UzZaman et al.,
2013), we consider value F1 with relaxed match-
ing as most important. However, when processing
large amounts of data, value accuracy becomes
also important. Since it directly shows indepen-
dent of the recall if extracted expressions are nor-
malized correctly, it is reported, too.

4.2 Evaluation Results and Discussion

As shown in Table 1, the results of our automat-
ically created resources are worse than those of
HeidelTime with manually developed resources.
For Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese,
high precision, moderate recall, and good normal-
ization results are achieved. In contrast, recall for
Chinese, Croatian, and Romanian are quite low,
precision is low for Romanian, and normalization
accuracy for Chinese, Vietnamese and Romanian.
Clearly, more work is necessary to achieve tempo-
ral tagging quality that can be considered as appli-
cable for other applications. In particular, issues
with morphology-rich languages and those with-
out white-space tokenization have to be addressed.

Nevertheless, the results look promising for
several languages taking into account that the
resources are developed without any language-
specific information, and that our approach has

been the first step towards more sophisticated tem-
poral tagging of all languages in the world. Note
that recall is much worse than precision for all lan-
guages and that the normalization of extracted ex-
pressions works quite well (value acc.).

4.3 Completeness Statistics
To estimate the quality of our automatically cre-
ated resources for languages without annotated
corpora, we create completeness statistics. As Fig-
ure 2 shows, the completeness differs significantly
between languages. However, Wiktionary trans-
lations exist for at least 75% and 50% of the pat-
terns for 34 and 83 languages, respectively, and
even for many languages with low overall cover-
age, important patterns such as month names and
date words are well-covered. Note that even for
languages with few translations, our approach can
be considered as baseline since temporal tagging
of most languages has not been addressed before.

5 Conclusions and Ongoing Work
In this paper, we presented our approach to auto-
matically extend the temporal tagger HeidelTime
to all languages in the world. We thus estab-
lish new temporal tagging baselines for many lan-
guages, and anyone working on any of those lan-
guages in the future can either use our resources
as a starting point or as a baseline for compari-
son. The resources for 200+ languages are avail-
able with HeidelTime 2.0 at http://github.
com/HeidelTime/heideltime.

Currently, we are improving the simplified En-
glish resources and the translation process by ex-
ploiting further resources such as Wikipedia. In
the future, we thus plan to constantly update Hei-
delTime’s automatically created resources.
