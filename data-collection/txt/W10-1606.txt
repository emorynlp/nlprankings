Abstract

This paper aims to bring a general overview

on the situation of Computational Linguistics

in Costa Rica, particularly in the academic

world.

1 Introduction

Costa Rica is a Central American country, well

known for the abolition of its army in 1949 and

for its policies in favor of the conservation of eco-

logically important areas. Investments in Education

brought a good development of several higher edu-

cational institutions, most of them public and open

to new students through an academic selection sys-

tem. As a consequence, one of the main products of

exportation is software (outsourcing, for example).

The growing importance of Computational Linguis-

tics (CL) in the last years has made developers to

start using CL technologies at work, but unfortu-

nately, often, they are on their own for the lack of

academic structures supporting development. In the

Table 1 and in the Figure 1 we provide comparative

data on Information and Communication Technolo-

gies (ICT) for Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico and the

United States both taken from the World Economic

Report for 2010 (Dutta and Mia, 2010), in order to

help the reader to get a better picture of the context

on which CL is growing up in Costa Rica.

This paper aims to bring a general account of CL

in Costa Rica. This article is divided into three parts.

∗Thanks to Sharid Loáiciga, Natalia Bermúdez, Prof.

Gabriela Barrantes, Prof. Hugo Mora Poltronieri and Prof. Ál-

varo de la Osa for their suggestions and comments. All the gaps

and mistakes in this paper are entirely mine.

The section 2 starts with some early CL articles in

Costa Rica before covering academic and research

infrastructure in the country. The section 4 briefly

acknowledges the presence of CL industries in the

country. Finally, the section 5 presents some of the

current tendencies in research and teaching. The

claims in this paper are not exhaustive and they only

represent the Author’s opinion, who aims to be as

objective as possible, but who does not have a com-

plete knowledge on the structures, institutions and

companies involved in computational issues in Costa

Rica. Therefore, all the topics are raised from per-

sonal interviews and experiences .

2 Academic infrastructure

Since the 90’s, CL raised interest in main academic

institutions in Costa Rica, particularly in the field of

Artificial Intelligence, but this interest was not con-

tinued and well structured in time. Some researchers

moved to other academic areas in computation or

even to industrial research. So, in the Instituto Tec-

nológico de Costa Rica1 (TEC) we found the first

citations related to CL, mainly on number recogni-

tion (Helo and Sell, 1995), knowledge representa-

tion (Araya, 1992), connectionism (Vargas, 1991)

and unification grammars (Vargas, 1992), these last

from a philosophical perspective.

In Costa Rica, we found more than 40 universities

and research institutes. But, computational research

in the country is principally done in the TEC and in

the University of Costa Rica.2 At this moment, CL

is mainly found in the University of Costa Rica as

part of the academic structure. This institution, as

far as we are concerned, has two structures cover-

ing research: schools and research institutions. The

former are mainly oriented towards teaching; the lat-

ter are exclusively devoted to research. CL teaching

is carried out in the School of Philology, Linguis-

tics and Literature3 and in its associated postgrad-

uate program on Linguistics4. Research is concen-

trated in the Instituto de Investigaciones Lingüísticas

(INIL)5 at the Facultad de Letras6. INIL is under

the administrative supervision of the Vicerrectoría

de Investigación7, which approves project financing.

All the scientific responsability falls on the members

and commissions of the research institutions. At this

moment, CL is attached to INIL’s program ELEX-

HICÓS. Where a two year project is under develop-

ment, with the part time assistance of a researcher.

This project aims to create the bases for a hybrid

parser.

In the Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingeniería

(INII), we found a program on cognition and lan-

guage8. In spite of the name, their research ad-

dresses mostly behavioral issues.

There exists the possibility of getting funding

from governmental institutions, like CONARE9, but

they are meager. Nevertheless, it seems there are

good options within inter-university collaboration,

but this would require a long term coordination and

planification.

In Costa Rica, research funding can be improved

if real applications are proposed, for example edu-

cational and developmental tools. Other areas of in-

terest are indigenous and minority languages, like

Bribri and Chinese. In this sense, there are no com-

putational projects officially inscribed in INIL at this

moment, but ideas to start projects on this areas are

waiting for the next inauguration of the Natural Lan-

guage Processing Laboratory in the University of

Costa Rica, so there are no papers to cite for the mo-

ment. Nevertheless, any inquiry on indigenous lan-

3 Growing needs, growing interest

In the 90’s the project Estudios de Lexicografía

Hispano-Costarricense10 (ELEXHICÓS)11 at the

School of Philology, Linguistics and Literature of

the University of Costa Rica was born as an initia-

tive to do lexicographical research on contemporary

Costarican Spanish and to publish dictionaries based

on modern scientific methods and oriented towards

different publics and usages.

Lexicographical studies appeal to large corpora in

order to document accurate word values and guar-

antee their usefulness. The need of computational

resources was felt from the beginning of ELEX-

HICÓS. The Murillo and Sánchez (1993) on lexi-

cal and syntactic maturity (language acquisition) is

a good example of a research where this need of

language computational tools is present. However,

statistical dictionaries (Morales, 2009) can only be

done by electronic means because of the huge cal-

culations involved. For a long time, ELEXHICÓS

counted on the limited, but important, support of the

Centro de Informática (Center of Informatics) of the

University of Costa Rica, but the need of developing

its own resources and technologies imposed itself.

In 2002 the School of Philology, Linguistics

and Literature of the University of Costa Rica

opened the course Tecnología y Producción Tex-

tual12, where text processing technologies like

LATEX, XML, HTML, CSS and Perl are taught for

applications in the Humanities field. Some interest-

ing proof-of-concept projects have been proposed as

part of the course activities (Arroyo Molina, 2009;

Enciso Bahler, 2008; Fuentes Vargas, 2008). As

an initiative of ELEXHICÓS and the School of

Philology, Linguistics and Literature in order to de-

velop CL, the University of Costa Rica approved

a grant for a Ph.D. on Computational Linguistics,

which was fulfilled at the Laboratoire d’Analyse et

de Technologie du Langage13 of the University of

Geneva. As part of this initiative a full time Profes-

sorship on CL was opened for 2010 and since 2009

CL is taught as postgraduate facultative course for

the Master on Linguistics. Other courses on Formal

Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

were accepted and will be part of the offer in 2010.

Additionally, the School of Philology, Linguistics

and Literature approved the creation of a NLP labo-

ratory (project number 021-A9-734 of the Vicerrec-

toría de Investigación, main resarcher, Prof. Jorge

Antonio Leoni de León, assistant researcher, Prof.

Carla Jara Murillo), which is expected for 2010, and

should support research and teaching, especially be-

cause a course on data processing for undergraduate

students on Linguistics and Philology is under con-

sideration.

Computational graduate students have showed

their interest on CL courses at the Postgraduate Pro-

gram in Linguistics14. Some of them come to the

course looking for knowledge on CL, since because

of their jobs they need a good understanding of NLP

technologies. Although we lack of details about the

job they do with NLP, the works of Berrocal Rojas

(2009) and Cedeño Baltodano (2009) for the post-

graduate program on Computational Sciences illus-

trate the growing interest in the field. At the mo-

ment, only one student started, this year, her Mas-

ter’s thesis on CL at the Postgraduate Program on

Linguistics at the University of Costa Rica.

Off universities’ campus, it’s important to men-

tion the Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnología15 (CE-

NAT), which has projects sharing similarities with

CL, but with totally different aims. For example, we

can cite the projects on human memory modelisa-

tion (in collaboration with the Programa de Investi-

gaciones en Fundamentos de la Educación a Distan-

cia, PROIFED, UNED) and an adaptation of com-

putational learning methods to a parallel and dis-

tributed processing platform. CENAT has contacts

with several organizations at international level. CE-

NAT is a state inter-university research institution on

super computation.

4 Commercial application of Language

Technologies

We are aware of postgraduate students working in

related areas in another countries, but we do not have

details about their plans for the future. Nevertheless,

national industry has not waited to have graduated

specialists in order to start the commercialization

of NLP related software. For example, Wordmagic

Software16 developed symbolic machine translation

software Spanish–English and Tecapro presented an

orthographic correction software17. Because of se-

crecy in the industry, it is difficult to know how many

companies appeal to NLP technologies. Enterprise

are also make themselves present in the field by sci-

entific grants, in 2007 Juan Rodríguez won a prize

proposing a glove allowing translation between sign

language and Natural Langue.18

5 Research interests and collaboration

issues

Presently, the idea is that Computational Linguistics

would play a role, at different levels, in Lexicogra-

phy and Spanish as a second language (L2). This

leads to the creation of parsing systems and large

corpora, where collaboration is desired. Another in-

teresting area for CL is dialectology, where the tradi-

tion, as in Lexicography, of large collaborative ini-

tiatives exists. The new NLP laboratory will have

workstations exclusively dedicated to research and

the creation and storage of large copora as an inten-

sive international initiative could be possible.

The signing of specific collaborative agreements

between academic institutions is the preferred way

to accomplish international research projects. This

facilitates the approval of fundings.

6 Conclusions

In Costa Rica, CL is finding its path. At this moment

it is mainly an academic interest, but, as we saw,

there already are industrial products, where, eventu-

aly, graduated students could find professional em-

ployment.

In the University of Costa Rica, where CL is

rapidly growing up, collaborative initiatives are pos-

sible in a specifc and well defined frame. Addition-

ally, many students are coming to CL, with the new

academic offer. And this tendecy can increase in the

next years.

In this moment, there is no CL community in

Costa Rica. Before we are able to build it, we need to

create a solid ground where a CL community could

firmly stand up. This is starting to happen at the

University of Costa Rica, where individual initia-

tives begin to gather around the recent course on

CL taught by Prof. Jorge Antonio Leoni de León.

We hope this movement will continue with the next

opening of the NLP Laboratory at the School of

Philology, Linguistics and Literature in the Univer-

sity of Costa Rica. This laboratory will fill the lack

of equipment to make research on CL. Nevertheless,

the need of a permanent research group will be there.

This is an understandable situation in the sense that

CL is a very new branch in the University and es-

pecially in liberal arts. This allows us to think that

students will incorporate to CL studies and projects

once the equipment and the offer on courses will be

normal. It is expected that this year (2010), School

of Philology, Linguistics and Literature will have a

full time professor on CL, who will dedicate at least
1
4 of his time to research.
