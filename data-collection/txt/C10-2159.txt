Abstract
We show that unsupervised part of speech
tagging performance can be significantly
improved using likely substitutes for tar-
get words given by a statistical language
model. We choose unambiguous substi-
tutes for each occurrence of an ambiguous
target word based on its context. The part
of speech tags for the unambiguous sub-
stitutes are then used to filter the entry for
the target word in the word–tag dictionary.
A standard HMM model trained using the
filtered dictionary achieves 92.25% accu-
racy on a standard 24,000 word corpus.

1 Introduction

We define the unsupervised part-of-speech (POS)
tagging problem as predicting the correct part-of-
speech tag of a word in a given context using
an unlabeled corpus and a dictionary with possi-
ble word–tag pairs0 The performance of an un-
supervised POS tagging system depends highly
on the quality of the word–tag dictionary (Banko
and Moore, 2004). We propose a dictionary fil-
tering procedure based on likely substitutes sug-
gested by a statistical language model. The pro-
cedure reduces the word–tag dictionary size and
leads to significant improvement in the accuracy
of the POS models.

Probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov
model (HMM) trained by expectation maximiza-
tion (EM), maximum a posteriori (MAP) esti-
mation, and Bayesian methods have been used

0In the POS literature the term “unsupervised” is typi-
cally used to describe systems that do not directly use the
tagged data. However, many of the unsupervised systems,
including ours, uses the tag–word dictionary.

to solve the unsupervised POS tagging problem
(Merialdo, 1994; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).
All of these approaches first learn the parameters
connecting the hidden structure to the observed
sequence of variables and then identify the most
probable values of the hidden structure for a given
observed sequence. They differ in the way they
estimate the model parameters. HMM-EM esti-
mates model parameters by using the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), MAP defines a prior
distribution over parameters and finds the param-
eter values that maximize the posterior distribu-
tion given data, and Bayesian methods integrate
over the posterior of the parameters to incorporate
all possible parameter settings into the estimation
process. Some baseline results and performance
reports from the literature are presented in Table 1.

(Johnson, 2007) criticizes the standard EM
based HMM approaches because of their poor per-
formance on the unsupervised POS tagging and
their tendency to assign equal number of words
to each hidden state. (Mitzenmacher, 2004) fur-
ther claims that words have skewed POS tag dis-
tributions, and a Bayesian method with sparse pri-
ors over the POS tags may perform better than
HMM estimated with EM. (Goldwater and Grif-
fiths, 2007) uses a fully Bayesian HMM model
that averages over all possible parameter values.
Their model achieves 86.8% tagging accuracy
with sparse POS priors and outperforms 74.50%
accuracy of the standard second order HMM-EM
(3-gram tag model) on a 24K word subset of
the Penn Treebank corpus. (Smith and Eisner,
2005) take a different approach and use the con-
ditional random fields estimated using contrastive
estimation which outperforms the HMM-EM and

2007) – use the same 45 tag dictionary that is constructed from the Penn Treebank.

Bayesian methods by achieving 88.6% accuracy
on the same 24K corpus.

Despite the fact that HMM-EM has a poor repu-
tation in POS literature (Goldberg et al., 2008) has
shown that with good initialization together with
some language specific features and language de-
pendent constraints HMM-EM achieves 91.4%
accuracy. Aside from the language specific infor-
mation and the good initialization, they also man-
ually reduce the noise in the word–tag dictionary.

(Ravi and Knight, 2009) focus on the POS tag
collection to find the smallest POS model that ex-
plain the data. They apply integer programming
to construct a minimal bi-gram POS tag set and
use this set to constrain the training phase of the
EM algorithm. The model trained by EM is used
to reduce the dictionary and these steps are iter-
atively repeated until no further improvement is
observed. Their model achieves 91.6% accuracy
on the 24K word corpus (with 100 random starts
this goes up to 91.8%). The main advantage of
this model is the restriction of the tag set so that
rare POS tags or the noise in the corpus do not get
incorporated into the estimation process.

Language models for disambiguation: Recent
work has shown that statistical language models
trained on large amounts of unlabeled text can
be used to improve the performance on various
disambiguation problems. The language model
is used to generate likely substitutes for the tar-
get word in the given context and these benefit
the disambiguation process to the extent that the
likely substitutes are unambiguous or have dif-
ferent ambiguities compared to the target word.
Using statistical language models based on large
corpora for unsupervised word sense disambigua-

tion and lexical substitution has been explored in
(Yuret, 2007; Hawker, 2007; Yuret and Yatbaz,
2010). Unsupervised morphological disambigua-
tion in agglutinative languages using likely sub-
stitutes has been shown to improve on standard
methods in (Yatbaz and Yuret, 2009).

In this paper we use the statistical language
model to reduce the possible number of tags per
word to help the disambiguation process. Specif-
ically we assume that the same hidden tag se-
quence that has generated a particular test sen-
tence can also generate artificial sentences where
one of the words has been replaced with a likely
substitute. POS tags of the likely substitutes can
then be used to reduce the tag set of the target
word. Thus, the substitutes are implicitly incorpo-
rated into the disambiguation process for reducing
the noise and the rare tags in the dictionary.

Table 2: Sample artificial sentences generated for
a test sentence from the Penn Treebank.

Table 2 presents an example where the likely
unambiguous replacements of the target word
“whipsaw” for a given sentence taken from the
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) are listed. In
this example each substitute is an unambiguous
verb (VB), confirming our assumption that each
artificial sentence comes from the same hidden se-
quence. For all occurrences of the word “whip-
saw”, our reduction algorithm will count the POS
tags of the likely substitutes and remove the tags

1392



that have not been observed from the dictionary.
Assuming that the first sentence in Table 2 is the
only sentence in which we observe “whipsaw”,
the “NN” tag of “whipsaw” will be removed.

The next section describes the details of our
dictionary reduction method. Section 3 explains
the details of statistical language model. We ex-
perimentally demonstrate that the word–tag dic-
tionary reduced by the substitutes improve the
performance by constraining the unsupervised
model in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 comments
on the results and discusses the possible exten-
sions of our method.

2 Dictionary Reduction

Our main assumption is that likely replacements
of a target word should have the same POS tag
as the target word in a given context. Motivated
by this idea we propose a new procedure that au-
tomatically reduces the dictionary size by using
the unambiguous replacements of the target word.
For all occurrences of the target word the pro-
cedure counts the POS tags of the replacement
words and removes the unobserved POS tags of
the target word from the dictionary.

Our approach is based on the idea that similar
words in a given context should have the same tag
sequence. To reduce the dictionary with the help
of the replacement words similar to a target word
w, we follow three rules:

1. Choose the replacement word from unam-
biguous substitutes that are likely to appear
in the target word context.

2. Substitutes must be observed in the training
corpus.

3. Count the tags of the replacement for all oc-
currences of the target word.

4. Remove the tags that are not observed as the
tag of replacements in any occurrences of the
target word.

The first rule is used to increase the likelihood
of getting a replacement word with the same POS
tag. The second rule makes sure that the size of
the vocabulary does not change. The third rule

determines the unused POS tags in all occurrences
of w and finally, last rule removes the unobserved
tags of w from the dictionary.

We use the standard first order HMM to test the
performance of our method. In a standard nth or-
der HMM each hidden state is conditioned by its
n preceding hidden states and each observation is
conditioned by its corresponding hidden state. In
POS tagging, the observed variable sequence is
a sentence s and the hidden variables ti are the
POS tags of the words wi in s. The HMM pa-
rameters θ can be estimated by using Baum-Welch
EM algorithm on an unlabeled training corpus D
(Baum, 1972). The tag sequence that maximizes
Pr(t|s, θ̂) can be identified by the Viterbi search
algorithm.

3 Statistical Language Modeling

In order to estimate highly probable replacement
words for a given wordw in the context cw, we use
an n-gram language model. The context is defined
as the 2n−1 word windoww−n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn−1
and it is centered at the target word position. The
probability of a word in a given context can be
estimated as:

P (w0 = w|cw) ∝ P (w−n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn−1) (1)
= P (w−n+1)P (w−n+2|w−n+1)

. . . P (wn−1|wn−2−n+1) (2)
∝ P (w0|w−1−n+1)P (w1|w0−n+2)

. . . P (wn−1|wn−20 ) (3)

where wji represents the sequence of words
wiwi+1 . . . wj . In Equation 1, Pr(w|cw) is pro-
portional to Pr(w−n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn+1) since the
context of the target word replacements is fixed.
Terms without w0 are common for every replace-
ment in Equation 2 therefore they have been
dropped in Equation 3. Finally, because of the
Markov property of n-gram language model, only
n− 1 words are used as a conditional context.

The probabilities in Equation 3 are estimated
using a 4 gram language model for all the words
in the vocabulary of D that are unambiguous and
have a common tag with the target word w. The
words with the highest Pr(r|cw) where r ∈ D are
selected as the replacement words of w in cw.

1393



To get accurate domain independent proba-
bility estimates we used the Web 1T data-set
(Brants and Franz, 2006), which contains the
counts of word sequences up to length five in a
1012 word corpus derived from publicly accessi-
ble Web pages. The SRILM toolkit is used to train
5-gram language model (Stolcke, 2002). The lan-
guage model parameters are optimized by using a
randomly selected 24K words corpus from Penn
Treebank. In order to efficiently apply the lan-
guage model to a given test corpus, the vocabulary
size is limited to the words seen in the test corpus.

4 Experiments

In this section we present a number of experi-
ments measuring the performance of several vari-
ants of our algorithm. The models in this sec-
tion are trained1 and tested on the same unlabeled
data therefore there aren’t any out-of-vocabulary
words. The experiments in this section focus on:
(1) the analysis of the dictionary reduction (2) the
number of the substitutes used for each ambigu-
ous word and (3) the size of the word–tag dictio-
nary.

4.1 Dataset

We trained HMM-EM models on a corpus that
consists of the first 24K words of the Penn Tree-
bank corpus. To be consistent with the POS tag-
ging literature, the tag dictionary is constructed by
listing all observed tags for each word in the entire
Penn Treebank. Nearly 55% of the words in Penn
Treebank corpus are ambiguous and the average
number of tags is 2.3.

centage of the words according to their gold POS
tags.

1The GMTK tool is used to train HMM-EM model on an
unlabeled corpus (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002).

Table 3 shows the POS speech groups and their
distributions in the 24K word corpus. We report
the model accuracy on several POS groups. Our
motivation is to determine HMM-EM model ac-
curacies on the subgroups before and after imple-
menting the dictionary reduction procedure.

4.2 Baseline

Table 4 presents some standard baselines for com-
parison. We define a random and a most frequent
tag (MFT) baseline on the 24K corpus. The ran-
dom baseline is calculated by randomly picking
one of the tags of each word and it also represents
the amount of ambiguity in the corpus. The MFT
baseline simply selects the most frequent POS tag
of each word from the 1M word Penn Treebank
corpus (counts of the first 24K words is not in-
cluded in the 1M word corpus). If the target word
does not exist in the training set, the MFT base-
line randomly picks one of the possible tags of the
missing word.

The first and second order HMMs can be
treated as the unsupervised baselines. These unsu-
pervised baselines are calculated by training uni-
formly initialized first and second order HMMs on
the target corpus without any smoothing. All the
initial parameters of HMM-EM are uniformly ini-
tialized to observe only the effects of the artificial
sentences on the performance of HMM-EM.

The success of the MFT baseline on the Noun,
Adj, Pronoun and function word groups shows
that tag distributions of the words in these groups
are more skewed towards to one of the available
tags. The MFT baseline performs poorly, com-
pared to the above groups, on V erb, and Adv
which is due to the less skewed POS tag behav-
ior of these tags.

The POS tagging literature widely uses the sec-
ond order HMM as the baseline model; how-
ever, the performance of this model can be out-
performed by an unsupervised first order HMM
model or a simple MFT baseline as presented in
Table 4. A point worth noting is that although the
first order HMM and the MFT baseline have sim-
ilar content word accuracies, the MFT baseline is
significantly better on the function words. This
is expected since EM tends to assign words uni-
formly to the available POS tags. Thus EM can

not capture the highly skewed behavior of func-
tion words. Moreover the amount of skewness af-
fects the accuracy of the EM such that the perfor-
mance gain of the MFT baseline over the first or-
der HMM on function words is around 28%-30%
while the performance gain on Noun, Adj and
Pronoun is around 3%-4%.

4.3 Reduced Dictionary
EM can not capture the sparse structure of the
word distributions therefore it tends to assign
equal number of words to each POS tag. Together
with the noisy word–tag dictionary great portion
of the function words are tagged with very rare
POS tags. The abuse of the rare tags is presented
in Table 5 in a similar fashion with (Ravi and
Knight, 2009). The count of replacement word
POS tags and the removed rare POS tags of 2 er-
roneous function words are also shown in Table 5.

Table 5: Removed POS tags of the given words
are shown in bold.

The results obtained with the dictionary that is
reduced by using 5 replacements are presented
in Table 6. Note that with reduced dictionary
the uniformly initialized first order HMM-EM
achieves 91.85% accuracy. Dictionary reduction
also removes some of the useful tags therefore
the upper–bound (oracle score) of the 24K dataset
becomes 98.15% after the dictionary reduction.
We execute 100 random restarts of the EM algo-

rithm and select the model with the highest corpus
likelihood, our model achieves 92.25% accuracy
which is the highest accuracy reported for the 24K
corpus so far.

As Table 6 shows, the effect of the dictionary
reduction on the function words is higher than
the effect on the content words. The main reason
for this situation is, function words are frequently
tagged with one of its tags which is also the reason
for the high accuracy of the majority voting based
baseline on the function words.

The reduced dictionary (RD) removes the rare
problematic POS tags of the words as a result the
accuracy on the content and function words shows
a drastic improvement compared to HMM models
trained with the original dictionary.

4.4 More Data
In this set of experiments we doubled the size of
the data and trained HMM-EM models on a cor-
pus that consists of the first 48K words of the Penn
Treebank corpus. Our aim is to observe the effect
of more data on our dictionary reduction proce-

1395



dure. Using the 5 replacements of each ambigu-
ous word we reduce the dictionary and train a new
HMM-EM model using this dictionary. The ad-
ditional data together with 100 random starts in-
creases the model accuracy to 92.47% on the 48K
corpus.

Table 7: Percentages of the correctly tagged
words by the first and second order HMM-EM
model trained on the 48K corpus with reduced
dictionary. The dictionary size is reduced by using
the top 5 replacements of each target word.

As we mentioned before, when the model is
trained using the original dictionary, the perfor-
mance gap between the first order HMM the sec-
ond order HMM is around 8% as presented in Ta-
ble 4. On the other hand, when we use the re-
duced dictionary together with more data the ac-
curacy gap between the second order and the first
order HMM-EM becomes less than 2% as shown
in Table 7. This confirms the hypothesis that the
low performance of the second order HMM is due
to data sparsity in the 24K-word dataset, and bet-
ter results may be achieved with the second order
HMM in larger datasets.

4.5 Number of Replacements

In this set of experiments we vary the number of
artificial replacement words per each ambiguous
word in s. We run our method on the 24K corpus
with 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 replacement words per
ambiguous word and we present the results in Ta-
ble 8. The performance of our method affected by
the the number of replacements and highest score
is achieved when 5 replacements are used. Incor-
porating the probability of the substitutes into the
model rather than using a hard cutoff may be a
better solution.

words by the models trained on the 24K corpus

nary size is reduced by using different number re-
placements.

4.6 17-Tagset
To observe the effect our method on a model with
coarse grained dictionary, we collapsed the 45–
tagset treebank dictionary to a 17–tagset coarse
dictionary (Smith and Eisner, 2005). The POS
literature after the work of Smith and Eisner fol-
lows this tradition and also tests the models on this
17–tagset. Table 9 summarizes the previously re-
ported results on coarse grained POS tagging. Our
system achieves 92.9% accuracy where the ora-
cle accuracy of 24K dataset with the reduced 17–
tagset dictionary is 98.3% and the state-of-the-art
system IP+EM scores 96.8%.

Table 9: Performance of different systems using

The IP+EM system constructs a model that de-
scribes the data by using minimum number of bi-
gram POS tags then uses this model to reduce the
dictionary size (Ravi and Knight, 2009). InitEM-
HMM uses the language specific information to-
gether with good initialization and it achieves
93.8% accuracy on the 1M word treebank corpus.

strong ambiguity class component given the mor-
phological features of words and scores 93.4% on

Johnson, 2007). CE+spl is HMM model estimated

1396



by contrastive estimation method and achieves
88.7% accuracy (Smith and Eisner, 2005). Fi-
nally, BHMM is a fully Bayesian approach that
uses sparse POS priors and scores 87.3% (Gold-
water and Griffiths, 2007).

5 Contributions

In this paper we proposed a dictionary reduction
method that can be applied to unsupervised tag-
ging problems. With the help of a statistical lan-
guage model, our system creates artificial replace-
ments that are assumed to have the same POS tag
as the target word and use them to reduce the size
of the word–tag dictionary. To test our method
we used HMM-EM as the unsupervised model.
Our method significantly improves the prediction
accuracy of the unsupervised first order HMM-
EM system in all of the POS groups and achieves
92.25% and 92.47% word tagging accuracy on the
24K and 48K word corpora respectively. We also
tested our model on a coarse grained dictionary
with 17 tags and achieved an accuracy of 92.8%.

In this work, we show that unambiguous re-
placements of an ambiguous word can reduce the
amount of the ambiguity thus replacement words
might also be incorporated into the other unsuper-
vised disambiguation problems.
