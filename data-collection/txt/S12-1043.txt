Abstract

In this paper, we present a system for de-
tecting negation in English text. We address
three tasks: negation cue detection, negation
scope resolution and negated event identifi-
cation. We pose these tasks as sequence la-
beling problems. For each task, we train a
Conditional Random Field (CRF) model on
lexical, structural, and syntactic features ex-
tracted from labeled data. The models are
trained and tested using the dataset distributed
with the *sem Shared Task 2012 on resolving
the scope and focus of negation. The system
detects negation cues with 90.98% F1 mea-
sure (94.3% and 87.88% recall). It identifies
negation scope with 82.70% F1 on token-by-
token level and 64.78% F1 on full scope level.
Negated events are detected with 51.10% F1
measure.

1 Introduction

Negation is a linguistic phenomenon present in all
languages (Tottie, 1993; Horn, 1989). The seman-
tic function of negation is to transform an affirma-
tive statement into its opposite meaning. The auto-
matic detection of negation and its scope is a prob-
lem encountered in a wide range of natural language
processing applications including, but not limited to,
data mining, relation extraction, question answering,
and sentiment analysis. For example, failing to ac-
count for negation may result in giving wrong an-
swers in question answering systems or in the pre-
diction of opposite sentiment in sentiment analysis
systems.

The occurrence of negation in a sentence is deter-
mined by the presence of a negation cue. A nega-
tion cue is a word, a phrase, a prefix, or a postfix
that triggers negation. Scope of negation is the part
of the meaning that is negated (Huddleston and Pul-
lum, 2002). The negated event is the event or the en-
tity that the negation indicates its absence or denies
its occurrence. For example, in the sentence below
never is the negation cue. The scope is enclosed in
square brackets. The negated event is underlined.

[Andrew had] never [liked smart phones],
but he received one as a gift last week and
started to use it.

Negation cues and scopes may be discontinuous.
For example, the negation cue neither ... nor is dis-
continuous.

In this chapter, we present a system for automat-
ically detecting negation cues, negated events, and
negation scopes in English text. The system uses
conditional random field (CRF) models trained on
labeled sentences extracted from two classical En-
glish novels. The CRF models are trained using lex-
ical, structural, and syntactic features. The experi-
ments show promising results.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 re-
views previous work. Section 3 describes the data.
Section 4 describes the CRFs models. Section 5
presents evaluation, results, and discussion.

2 Previous Work

Most research on negation has been done in the
biomedical domain (Chapman et al., 2001; Mutalik
et al., 2001; Kim and Park, 2006; Morante et al.,

2008a; Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Agarwal and
Yu, 2010; Morante, 2010; Read et al., 2011), mostly
on clinical reports. The reason is that most NLP re-
search in the biomedical domain is interested in au-
tomatically extracting factual relations and pieces of
information from unstructured data. Negation detec-
tion is important here because information that falls
in the scope of a negation cue cannot be treated as
facts.

Chapman et al. (2001) proposed a rule-based al-
gorithm called NegEx for determining whether a
finding or disease mentioned within narrative med-
ical reports is present or absent. The algorithm
uses regular-expression-based rules. Mutalik et
al. (2001) developed another rule based system
called Negfinder that recognizes negation patterns
in biomedical text. It consists of two components:
a lexical scanner, lexer that uses regular expres-
sion rules to generate a finite state machine, and a
parser. Morante (2008b) proposed a supervised ap-
proach for detecting negation cues and their scopes
in biomedical text. Their system consists of two
memory-based engines, one that decides if the to-
kens in a sentence are negation signals, and another
one that finds the full scope of these negation sig-
nals.

Negation has been also studied in the context of
sentiment analysis (Wilson et al., 2005; Jia et al.,
2009; Councill et al., 2010; Heerschop et al., 2011;
Hogenboom et al., 2011). Wiegand et al. (2010) sur-
veyed the recent work on negation scope detection
for sentiment analysis. Wilson et al. (2005) studied

the contextual features that affect text polarity. They
used a machine learning approach in which nega-
tion is encoded using several features. One feature
checks whether a negation expression occurs in a
fixed window of four words preceding the polar ex-
pression. Another feature accounts for a polar pred-
icate having a negated subject. They also have dis-
ambiguation features to handle negation words that
do not function as negation cues in certain contexts,
e.g. not to mention and not just.

Jia et al. (2009) proposed a rule based method to
determine the polarity of sentiments when one or
more occurrences of a negation term such as not ap-
pear in a sentence. The hand-crafted rules are ap-
plied to syntactic and dependency parse tree repre-
sentations of the sentence.

Hogenboom et al. (2011) found that applying a
simple rule that considers two words, following a
negation keyword, to be negated by that keyword,
to be effective in improving the accuracy of senti-
ment analysis in movie reviews. This simple method
yields a significant increase in overall sentiment
classification accuracy and macro-level F1 of 5.5%
and 6.2%, respectively, compared to not accounting
for negation.

This work is characterized by addressing three
tasks at once: negation cue detection, negated
event identification, and negation scope resolution.
Our proposed approach uses a supervised graphical
probabilistic model trained using labeled data.

3 Data

We use the dataset distributed by the organizers of
the *sem Shared Task 2012 on resolving the scope
and focus of negation. This dataset includes two sto-
ries by Conan Doyle, The Hound of the Baskervilles,
The Adventures of Wisteria Lodge. All occur-
rences of negation are annotated accounting for
negation expressed by nouns, pronouns, verbs, ad-
verbs, determiners, conjunctions and prepositions.
For each negation cue, the negation cue and scope
are marked, as well as the negated event (if any ex-
ists). The annotation guidelines follow the proposal
of Morante et al. (2011)1. The data is split into three
sets: a training set containing 3,644 sentences, a de-
velopment set containing 787 sentences, and a test-
ing set containing 1,089 sentences. The data is pro-
vided in CoNLL format. Each line corresponds to a
token and each annotation is provided in a column;
empty lines indicate end of sentences. The provided
annotations are:

• Column 1: chapter name

• Column 2: sentence number within chapter

• Column 3: token number within sentence

• Column 4: word

• Column 5: lemma

• Column 6: part-of-speech

• Column 7: syntax

• Columns 8 to last:

– If the sentence has no negations, column
8 has a ”***” value and there are no more
columns.

– If the sentence has negations, the annota-
tion for each negation is provided in three
columns. The first column contains the
word or part of the word (e.g., morpheme
”un”), that belongs to the negation cue.
The second contains the word or part of
the word that belongs to the scope of the
negation cue. The third column contains
the word or part of the word that is the

negated event or property. It can be the
case that no negated event or property are

tence that contains two negation cues.

4 Approach

The problem that we are trying to solve can be split
into three tasks. The first task is to detect negation
cues. The second task is to identify the scope of each
detected negation cue. The third task is to identify
the negated event. We use a machine learning ap-
proach to address these tasks. We train a Condi-
tional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001)
model on lexical, structural, and syntactic features
extracted from the training dataset. In the following
subsections, we describe the CRF model that we use
for each task.

4.1 Negation Cue Detection
Negation cues are lexical elements that indicate the
existence of negation in a sentence. From lexical

330



point of view, negation cues can be divided into four
categories:

1. Prefix (i.e. in-, un-, im-, il-, dis-). For example,
un- in unsuitable) is a prefix negation cue.

2. Postfix (i.e. -less). for example, -less in
careless.

3. Multi-word negation cues such as neither...nor,
rather than, by no means, etc.

4. Single word negation cues such as not, no,
none, nobody, etc.

The goal of this task is to detect negation cues.
We pose this problem as a sequence labeling task.
The reason for this choice is that some negation cues
may not indicate negation in some contexts. For
example, the negation cue not in the phrase not to
mention does not indicate negation. Also, as we saw
above, some negation cues may consist of multiple
words, some of them are continuous and others are
discontinuous. Treating the task as a sequence label-
ing problem help model the contextual factors that
affect the function of negation cues. We train a CRF
model using features extracted from the sentences of
the training dataset. The token level features that we
train the model on are:

• Token: The word or the punctuation mark as it
appears in the sentence.

• Lemma: The lemmatized form of the token.

• Part-Of-Speech tag: The part of speech tag of
the token.

• Part-Of-Speech tag category: Part-of-speech
tags reduced into 5 categories: Adjec-
tive (ADJ), Verb (VB), Noun (NN), Adverb
(ADVB), Pronoun (PRO), and other (OTH).

• Is punctuation mark: This feature takes the
value 1 if the token is a punctuation mark and 0
otherwise.

• Starts with negation prefix: This feature takes
the value 1 if the token is a word that starts with
un-, in-, im-, il-, or dis- and 0 otherwise.

• Ends with negation postfix: This feature takes
the value 1 if the token is a word that ends with
-less and 0 otherwise.

The CRF model that we use considers at each to-
ken the features of the current token, the two pre-
ceding tokens, and the two proceeding tokens. The
model also uses token bigrams and trigrams, and
part-of-speech tag bigrams and trigrams as features.

The labels are 5 types: ”O” for tokens that are
not part of any negation cue; ”NEG” for single
word negation cues; ”PRE” for prefix negation cue;
”POST” for postfix negation cue; and ”MULTI-
NEG” for multi-word negation cues. Table 2 shows
an example labeled sentence.

At testing time, if a token is labeled ”NEG” or
”MULTI-NEG” the whole token is treated as a nega-
tion cue or part of a negation cue respectively. If a
token is labeled as ”PRE” or ”POST”, a regular ex-
pression is used to determine the prefix/postfix that
trigged the negation.

4.2 Negation Scope Detection

Scope of negation is the sequence of tokens (can
be discontinuous) that expresses the meaning that
is meant to be negated by a negation cue. A sen-
tence may contain zero or more negation cues. Each
negation cue has its own scope. It is possible that
the scope of two negation cues overlap. We use
each negation instance (i.e. each negation cue and
its scope) as one training example. Therefore, a
sentence that contains two negation cues provides
two training examples. We train a CRF model on
features extracted from all negation instances in the
training dataset. The features that we use are:

• Token: The word or the punctuation mark as it
appears in the sentence.

• Lemma: The lemmatized form of the token.

• Part-Of-Speech tag: The part of speech tag of
the token.

• Part-Of-Speech tag category: Part-of-speech
tags reduced into 5 categories: Adjec-
tive (ADJ), Verb (VB), Noun (NN), Adverb
(ADVB), Pronoun (PRO), and other (OTH).

331



• Is punctuation mark: This feature takes the
value 1 if the token is a punctuation mark and 0
otherwise.

• Type of negation cue: Possible types are:
”NEG” for single word negation cues; ”PRE”
for prefix negation cue; ”POST” for postfix
negation cue; and ”MULTI” for multi-word
negation cues.

• Relative position: This feature takes the value
1 if the token position in the sentence is be-
fore the position of the negation cue, 2 if the
token position is after the position of the nega-
tion cue, and 3 if the token is the negation cue
itself.

• Distance: The number of tokens between the
current token and the negation cue.

• Same segment: This feature takes the value 1
if this token and the negation cue fall in the
segment in the sentence. The sentence is seg-
mented by punctuation marks.

• Chunk: This feature takes the value NP-B (VP-
B) if this token is the first token of a noun (verb)
phrase, NP-I (VP-I) if it is inside a noun (verb)
phrase, NP-E (VP-E) if it is the last token of a
noun (verb) phrase.

• Same chunk: This feature takes the value 1 if
this token and the negation cue fall in the same
chunk (noun phrase or verb phrase).

• Is negation: This feature takes the value 1 if
this token is a negation cue, and 0 otherwise.

• Syntactic distance: The number of edges in the
shortest path that connects the token and the
negation in the syntactic parse tree.

• Common ancestor node: The type of the node
in the syntactic parse tree that is the least com-
mon ancestor of this token and the negation cue
token.

The CRF model considers the features of 4 tokens
to the left and to the right at each position. It also
uses bigram and trigram combinations of some of
the features.

At testing time a few postprocessing rules are
used to fix sure labels if they were labeled incor-
rectly. For example, if a word starts with a prefix
negation cue, the word itself (without the prefix) is
always part of the scope and it is also the negated
event.

4.3 Negated Event Identification

It is possible that a negation cue comes associated
with an event. A negation has an event if it oc-
curs in a factual context. The dataset that we use
was labeled for negated events whenever one exists.
We used the same features described in the previous
subsection to train a CRF model for negated event
identification. We have also tried to use one CRF
model for both scope resolution and negated event
identification, but we noticed that using two sepa-
rate models results in significantly better results for
both tasks.

5 Evaluation

We use the testing set described in Section 3 to eval-
uate the system. The testing set contains 1089 sen-
tences 235 of which contains at least one negation.

We use the standard precision, recall, and f-
measure metrics to evaluate the system. We perform
the evaluation on different levels:

1. Cues: the metrics are computed only for cue
detection.

2. Scope (tokens): the metrics are calculated at to-
ken level. If a sentence has 2 scopes, one with
5 tokens and another with 4, the total number
of scope tokens is 9.

3. Scope (full): the metrics are calculated at the
full scope level. Both the negation cue and
the whole scope should be correctly identified.
If a sentence contains 2 negation cues, then 2
scopes are checked. We report two values here
one the requires the cue match correctly and
one that does not.

4. Negated Events: the metrics are computed only
for negated events identification (apart from
negation cue and scope).

Table 3: Results of negation cue, negated event, and negation scope detection

5. Full negation: the metrics are computed for all
the three tasks at once and requiring everything
to match correctly.

For cue, scope and negated event to be correct,
both the tokens and the words or parts of words have
to be correctly identified. The final periods in abbre-
viations are disregarded. If gold has value ”Mr.” and
system ”Mr”, system is counted as correct. Also,
punctuation tokens are *not* taken into account for
evaluation.

Two variants of the metrics are computed. In the
first variant (A), precision is calculated as tp / (tp +
fp) and recall is calculated as tp / (tp + fn) where tp
is the count of true positive labels, fp is the count
of false positive labels, and fn is the count of false
negative labels. In variant B, the precision is calcu-
lated differently, using the formula precision = tp /
system.

Table 3 shows the results of our system.

6 Error Analysis

The system used no external resources outside the
training data. This means that the system recognizes
only negation cues that appeared in the training set.
This was the first source of error. For example, the
word unacquainted that starts with the negation pre-
fix un has never been seen in the training data. In-

tuitively, if no negation cue is detected, the system
does not attempt to produce scope levels. This prob-
lem can be overcome by using a lexicon of negation
words and those words that can be negated by adding
a negation prefix to them.

We noticed in several occasions that scope detec-
tion accuracy can be improved if some simple rules
can be imposed after doing the initial labeling us-
ing the CRF model (but we have not actually imple-
mented any such rules in the system). For example,
the system can require all the tokens that belong to
the same chunk (noun group, verb group, etc.) all
have the same label (e.g. the majority vote label).
The same thing could be also applied on the segment
rather than the chunk level where the boundaries of
segments are determined by punctuation marks.

7 Conclusion

We presented a supervised system for identifying
negation in English sentences. The system uses
three CRF trained models. One model is trained for
negation cue detection. Another model is trained
for negated event identification. A third one is
trained for negation scope identification. The mod-
els are trained using features extracted from a la-
beled dataset. Our experiments show that the system
achieves promising results.
