Abstract

Automatically compiling bilingual dictio-
naries of technical terms from comparable
corpora is a challenging problem, yet with
many potential applications. In this paper,
we exploit two independent observations
about term translations: (a) terms are of-
ten formed by corresponding sub-lexical
units across languages and (b) a term and
its translation tend to appear in similar lex-
ical context. Based on the first observa-
tion, we develop a new character n-gram
compositional method, a logistic regres-
sion classifier, for learning a string similar-
ity measure of term translations. Accord-
ing to the second observation, we use an
existing context-based approach. For eval-
uation, we investigate the performance of
compositional and context-based methods
on: (a) similar and unrelated languages,
(b) corpora of different degree of compa-
rability and (c) the translation of frequent
and rare terms. Finally, we combine the
two translation clues, namely string and
contextual similarity, in a linear model and
we show substantial improvements over
the two translation signals.

1 Introduction

Bilingual dictionaries of technical terms are re-
sources useful for various tasks, such as computer-
aided human translation (Dagan and Church,
1994; Fung and McKeown, 1997), Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (Och and Ney, 2003) and Cross-
Language Information Retrieval (Ballesteros and
Croft, 1997). In the last two decades, researchers
have focused on automatically compiling bilingual
term dictionaries either from parallel (Smadja et
al., 1996; Van der Eijk, 1993) or comparable cor-
pora (Rapp, 1999; Fung and Yee, 1998). While

parallel corpora contain the same sentences in two
languages, comparable corpora consist of bilin-
gual pieces of text that share some features, only,
such as topic, domain, or time period. Comparable
corpora can be constructed more easily than paral-
lel corpora. Freely available, up-to-date, on-line
resources (e.g., Wikipedia) can be employed.

In this paper, we exploit two different sources
of information to extract bilingual terminology
from comparable corpora: the compositional and
the contextual clue. The compositional clue is
the hypothesis that the representations of a term
in any pair of languages tend to consist of cor-
responding lexical or sub-lexical units, e.g., pre-
fixes, suffices and morphemes. In order to cap-
ture associations of textual units across languages,
we investigate three different character n-gram ap-
proaches, namely a Random Forest (RF) classifier
(Kontonatsios et al., 2014), Support Vector Ma-
chines with an RBF kernel (SVM-RBF) and a Lo-
gistic Regression (LogReg) classifier. Whilst the
previous approaches take as an input monolingual
features and then try to find cross-lingual map-
pings, our proposed method (LogReg classifier)
considers multilingual features, i.e., tuples of co-
occurring n-grams.

The contextual clue is the hypothesis that mu-
tual translations of a term tend to occur in similar
lexical context. Context-based approaches are un-
supervised methods that compare the context dis-
tributions of a source and a target term. A bilin-
gual seed dictionary is used to map context vec-
tor dimensions of two languages. Li and Gaussier
(2010) suggested that the seed dictionary can be
used to estimate the degree of comparability of a
bilingual corpus. Given a seed dictionary, the cor-
pus comparability is the expectation of finding for
each word of the source corpus, its translation in
the target part of the corpus. The performance of
context-based methods has been shown to depend
on the frequency of terms to be translated and the

1701



corpus comparability. In this work, we use an ex-
isting distributional semantics approach to locate
term translations.

Furthermore, we hypothesise that the compo-
sitional and contextual clue are orthogonal, since
the former considers the internal structure of terms
while the latter exploits the surrounding lexical
context. Based on the above hypothesis, we com-
bine the two translation clues in a linear model.

For experimentation, we construct compara-
ble corpora for four language pairs (English-
Spanish, English-French, English-Greek and
English-Japanese) of the biomedical domain.

We choose this domain because a large propor-
tion of the medical terms tends to composition-
ally translate across languages (Lovis et al., 1997;
Namer and Baud, 2007). Additionally, given the
vast amount of newly introduced terms (neolo-
gisms) in the medical domain (Pustejovsky et al.,
2001), term alignment methods are needed in or-
der to automatically update existing resources.

We investigate the following aspects of term
alignment: (a) the performance of compositional
methods on closely related and on distant lan-
guages, (b) the performance of context vectors and
compositional methods when translating frequent
or rare terms, (c) the degree to which the corpus
comparability affects the performance of context-
based and compositional methods (d) the improve-
ments that we can achieve when we combine the
compositional and context clue.

Our experiments show that the performance of
compositional methods largely depends on the dis-
tance between the two languages. The perfor-
mance of the context-based approach is greatly
affected by corpus-specific parameters (the fre-
quency of occurrence of the terms to be translated
and the degree of corpora comparability). It is also
shown that the combination of compositional and
contextual methods performs better than each of
the clues, separately. Combined systems can be
deployed in application environments with differ-
ent language pairs, comparable corpora and seeds
dictionaries.

The LogReg, dictionary extraction method de-
scribed in this paper is freely available 1.

2 Related Work

Context-based methods (Fung and Yee, 1998;
Rapp, 1999) adapt the Distributional Hypothesis
(Harris, 1954), i.e., words that occur in similar
lexical context tend to have the same meaning, in
a multilingual environment. They represent the
context of each term t as a context vector, usu-
ally following the bag-of-words model. Each di-
mension of the vector corresponds to a context
word occurring within a predefined window, while
the corresponding value is computed by a corre-
lation metric, e.g., Log-Likelihood Ratio (Morin
et al., 2007; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or
Point-wise Mutual Information (Andrade et al.,
2010). A general bilingual dictionary is then used
to translate/project the target context vectors into
the source language. As a result, the source and
target context vectors become directly compara-
ble. In a final step, candidate translations are being
ranked according to a distance metric, e.g., cosine
similarity (Tamura et al., 2012) or Jaccard index
(Zanzotto et al., 2010; Apidianaki et al., 2012).

Whilst context-based methods have become a
common practise for bilingual dictionary extrac-
tion from comparable corpora, nonetheless, their
performance is subject to various factors, one of
which is the quality of the comparable corpus. Li
and Gaussier (2010) introduced the corpus com-
parability metric and showed that it is related to
the performance of context vectors. The higher
the corpus comparability is, the higher the perfor-
mance of context vectors is. Furthermore, context
vector approaches are sensitive to the frequency of
terms. For frequent terms, distributional seman-
tics methods exhibit robust performance since the
corresponding context is more informative. Chiao
and Zweigenbaum (2002) reported an accuracy of
91% for the top 20 candidates when translating
terms that occur 100 times or more. However,
the performance of context vectors drastically de-
creases for lower frequency terms (Kontonatsios et
al., 2014; Morin and Daille, 2010).

Our work is more closely related to a second
class of term alignment methods that exploits the
internal structure of terms between a source and
a target language. Compositional translation al-
gorithms are based on the principal of composi-
tionality (Keenan and Faltz, 1985), which claims
that the translation of the whole is a function of
the translation of its parts. Lexical (Morin and
Daille, 2010; Daille, 2012; Robitaille et al., 2006;

1702



Tanaka, 2002) and sub-lexical (Delpech et al.,
2012) compositional algorithms are knowledge-
rich approaches that proceed in two steps, namely
generation and selection. In the generation step,
an input source term is segmented into basic trans-
lation units: words (lexical compositional meth-
ods) or morphemes (sub-lexical methods). Then
a pre-compiled, seed dictionary of words or mor-
phemes is used to translate the components of the
source term. Finally, a permutation function gen-
erates candidate translations using the list of the
translated segments. In the selection step, candi-
date translations are ranked according to their fre-
quency (Morin and Daille, 2010; Robitaille et al.,
2006) or their context similarity with the source
term (Tanaka, 2002). The performance of the
compositional translation algorithms is bound to
the coverage of the seed dictionary (Daille, 2012).
Delpech et al. (2012) noted that 30% of untrans-
lated terms were due to the low coverage of the
seed dictionary.

Kontonatsios et al. (2014) introduced a Random
Forest (RF) classifier that learns correspondences
of character n-grams between a source and target
language. Unlike lexical and sub-lexical compo-
sitional methods, a RF classifier does not require
a bilingual dictionary of translation units. The
model is able to automatically build correlation
paths between source and target sub-lexical seg-
ments that best discriminate translation from non-
translation pairs. However, being a supervised
method, it still requires a seed bilingual dictio-
nary of technical terms for training. The RF classi-
fier was previously applied on an English-Spanish
comparable corpus and it was shown to signifi-
cantly outperform context-based approaches.

3 Methods

In this section we describe the character n-gram
models, the context vector method and the hybrid
system. The lexicon induction task is formalised
as a two-class classification problem. Given a pair
of terms in a source and a target language, the out-
put is a prediction of whether the terms are mutual
translations are not. Furthermore, each term align-
ment method implements a ranking function that
calculates a similarity score between a source and
a target term. The methods rank target terms ac-
cording to the similarity score and select the top N
ranked terms as candidate translations. The rank-
ing functions will be discussed in the following

subsections.

3.1 Character n-gram models

Let s be a source term containing p character n-
grams (s={s1, s2, ..., sp} si ∈ S, ∀i ∈ [1, p])
and t a target term of q n-grams (t={t1, t2, ..., tq}
ti ∈ T , ∀i ∈ [1, q]). We extract charac-
ter n-grams by considering any contiguous, non-
linguistically motivated sequence of characters
that occurs within a window size of [2 − 5] 2) for
English, French and Greek. For Japanese, uni-
grams are included (window size of [1 − 5] be-
cause Japanese terms often contain Kanji (Chi-
nese) characters.

Given the two lists of source and target n-grams,
our objective is to find an underlying relationship
between S and T that best discriminates trans-
lation from non-translation pairs. The RF clas-
sifier was previously shown to exhibit such be-
haviour (Kontonatsios et al., 2014). An RF clas-
sifier (Breiman, 2001) is a collection of decision
trees voting for the most popular class. For a pair
of source and target terms 〈s, t〉, the RF method
creates feature vectors of a fixed size 2r, i.e., first
order feature space. The first r features are ex-
tracted from the source term, while the last r fea-
tures from the target term. Each feature has a
boolean value (0 or 1) that designates the pres-
ence/absence of the corresponding n-gram in the
input instance.

The ability of the RF to detect latent associa-
tions between S and T relies on the decision trees.
The internal nodes of a decision tree represent the
n-gram features that are linked together in the tree-
hierarchy. Each leaf node of the trees is labelled as
translation or non-translation indicating whether
the parent path of n-gram features is positively or
negatively associated. The classification margin
that we use to rank the candidate translations is
given by a margin function (Breiman, 2001):

mg(X, Y ) = av(I(x) = 1)−av(I(x)) = 0) (1)

where x is an instance 〈s, t〉, y ∈ Y = {0, 1} the
class label, I(·) : (s, t) −→ {0, 1} is the indicator
function of a decision tree and av(I(·)) the aver-
age number of trees voting for the same class la-
bel. In our experiments, we used the same settings
as the ones reported in Kontonatsios et al. (2014).

2we have experiments with larger and narrower window
sizes but this setting resulted in better translation accuracy

1703



We used 140 decision trees and log2 |2q| + 1 ran-
dom features. For training an RF model, we used
the WEKA platform (Hall et al., 2009).

The second class of machine learning algo-
rithms that we investigate is Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs). The simplest version of SVMs
is a linear classifier (linear-SVM) that tries to
place a hyperplane, a decision boundary, that sepa-
rates translation from non-translation instances. A
linear-SVM is a feature agnostic method since the
model only exploits the position of the vectors in
the hyperspace to achieve class separation (Hastie
et al., 2009).

The first order feature representation used with
the RF classifier does not model associations be-
tween S and T . Hence, intuitively, a first or-
der feature space is not linearly separable, i.e.,
there exists no decision boundary that divides the
data points into translations and non-translations.
3. To solve non-linear classification problems,
SVMs employ non-linear kernels. A kernel func-
tion projects input instances into a higher dimen-
sional space to discover non-linear associations
between the initial features. In this new, projected
feature space, the SVM attempts to define a sep-
arating plane. For training an non-linear SVM on
the first order feature space, we used the LIBSVM
package (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a radial ba-
sis function (RBF) kernel. For ranking candidate
translations, we used the decision value given by
LIBSVM which represents the distance between
an instance and the hyperplane. To translate a
source term, the method ranks candidate transla-
tions by decision value and suggests as best trans-
lation the candidate with the maximum distance
(maximum margin).

While the first order models try to find cross-
lingual mappings between monolingual features,
our proposed method follows a different approach.
It models cross-lingual links between the source
and target character n-grams and uses them as
second order features to train a linear classifier.
A second order feature is a tuple of n-grams in
S and T , respectively, that co-occur in a train-
ing, translation instance. Second order feature

3We applied a linear-SVM with the first order feature
representation on the four comparable corpora for English-
French, English-Spanish, English-Greek and English-
Japanese. In all cases, the best accuracies achieved were close
to zero. Additionally, the ranked list of candidate translations
was the same for all source terms. Hence, we can empiri-
cally suggest that the linear-SVM cannot exploit a first order
feature space.

values are boolean. Given a translation instance
〈s, t〉 of p source and q target n-grams, there are
p×q second order features. For dimensionality re-
duction, we consider as second order features the
most frequent out of all possible first order feature
combinations, only. Experiments indicate that a
large number of features needs to be considered
to achieve robust performance. To cope with the
high dimensional second order space, we use LI-
BLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008), which is designed
to solve large-scale, linear classifications prob-
lems. LIBLINEAR implements two linear clas-
sification algorithms: LogReg and linear-SVM.
Both models solve the same optimisation problem,
i.e., determine the optimal separating plane, but
they adopt different loss functions. Since LIBLIN-
EAR does not support decision value estimations
for the linear-SVM, we only experimented with
LogReg. Similarly to SVM-RBF, LogReg ranks
candidate translations by classification margin.

3.2 Context vectors

We follow a standard approach to calculate context
similarity of source and target terms (Rapp, 1999;
Morin and Daille, 2010; Morin and Prochasson,
2011a; Delpech et al., 2012). Context vectors
of candidate terms in the source and target lan-
guage are populated after normalising each bilin-
gual corpus, separately. Normalisation consists
of stop-word filtering, tokenisation, lemmatisa-
tion and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. For En-
glish, Spanish and French we used the TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1994) while for Greek we used the ILSP
toolkit (Papageorgiou et al., 2000). The Japanese
corpus was segmented and PoS-tagged using Ju-
man (Kurohashi and Kawahara, 2005).

In succession, monolingual context vectors are
compiled by considering all lexical units that oc-
cur within a window of 3 words before or af-
ter a term (a seven-word window). Only lexical
units (seeds) that occur in a bilingual dictionary
are retained The values in context vectors are Log-
Likelihood Ratio associations (Dunning, 1993) of
the term and a seed lexical unit occurring in it. In
a second step, we use the translations in the seed
dictionary to map target context vectors into the
source vector space. If there are several transla-
tions for a term, they are all considered with equal
weights. Finally, candidate translations are ranked
in descending order of the cosine of the angle be-
tween the mapped target vectors and the source

3.3 Hybrid term alignment system

Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of our term
alignment system. We use two bilingual seed dic-
tionaries: (a) a dictionary of term translation pairs
to train the n-gram models and (b) a dictionary of
word-to-word correspondences to translate target
context vectors. The n-gram and context vector
methods are used separately to score term pairs.
The n-gram model computes the value of the com-
positional clue while the context vector estimates
the score of the contextual clue. The hybrid model
combines both methods by using the correspond-
ing scores as features to train a linear classifier.
For this, we used a linear-SVM of the LIBSVM
package with default values for all parameters.

4 Data

Following previous research (Prochasson and
Fung, 2011; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013;
Klementiev et al., 2012), we construct compara-
ble biomedical corpora using Wikipedia as a freely
available resource.

Starting with a list of 4K biomedical English
terms (query-terms), we collected 4K English
Wikipedia articles, by matching query-terms to the
topic signatures of articles. Then, we followed

the Wikipedia interlingual links to retrieve the-
matically related articles in each target language.
Since not all English articles contain links for all
four target languages (Spanish, French, Greek and
Japanese), we used a different list of query-terms
for each language pair. Corpora were randomly
divided into training and testing parts. For train-
ing we used 3K documents and for testing the re-
maining 1K. Table 1 shows the size of corpora in
terms of numbers of source (SW) and target words
(TW).

4.1 Seed dictionaries

As shown in Figure 1, the term alignment methods
require two seed bilingual dictionaries: a term and
a word dictionary. The character n-gram models
rely on a bilingual term dictionary to learn asso-
ciations of n-grams that appear often in technical
terms. The dictionary may contain both single-
word and multi-word terms. For English-Spanish
and English-French we used UMLS (Bodenreider,
2004) while for English-Japanese we used an elec-
tronic dictionary of medical terms (Denshika and
Kenkyukai, 1991).

An English-Greek biomedical dictionary was
not available at the time of conducting these ex-
periments, thus we automatically compiled a dic-
tionary from a parallel corpus. For this, we trained
a standard Statistical Machine Translation system
(Koehn et al., 2007) on EMEA (Tiedemann, 2009),
a biomedical parallel corpus containing sentence-
aligned documents from the European Medicines
Agency. Then, we extracted all English-Greek
pairs for which: (a) the English sequence was
listed in UMLS and (b) the translation probability
was equal or higher to 0.7.

The sizes of the seed term dictionaries vary sig-
nificantly, e.g., 500K entries for English-French
but only 20K entries for English-Greek. How-
ever, the character n-gram models require a rela-
tively small portion of the corresponding dictio-
nary to converge. In the reported experiments,
we used 10K translation pairs as positive, train-
ing instances. In addition, we generated an equal
number of pseudo-negative instances by randomly
matching non-translation terms.

Morin and Prochasson (2011b) showed that the
translation accuracy of context vectors is higher
when using bilingual dictionaries that contain both
general language entries and technical terms rather
than general or domain-specific dictionaries, sep-

arately. In a mixed dictionary, lexical units are
either single-word technical terms, such as “dis-
ease” and “patient”, or general language words,
such as “occur” and “high”. Note that we have
already compiled a seed term dictionary for each
pair of languages. Following the suggestion of
Morin and Prochasson (2011b), we attempt to en-
rich the seed term dictionaries with general lan-
guage entries. For this, we extracted bilingual
word dictionaries for English-Spanish, English-
French and English-Greek by applying GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003) on the EMEA corpus. We
then concatenated the word with the term dictio-
naries to obtain enhanced seeds for the three lan-
guage pairs. For English-Japanese, we only used
the term dictionary to translate the target context
vectors.

Once the word dictionaries have been compiled,
we compute the corpus comparability measure. Li
and Gaussier (2010) define corpus comparability
as the percentage of words that can be translated
bi-directionally, given a seed dictionary.

Table 2 shows corpus comparability scores of
the four corpora accompanied with the number
of English, single words in the seed dictionar-
ies. It can be observed that seed dictionary sizes
are not necessarily proportional to the correspond-
ing corpus comparability scores. As expected, for

English-Japanese, corpus comparability is low be-
cause the dictionary contains single-word terms,
only. The English-Spanish dictionary is smaller
than the English-French but achieved higher cor-
pus comparability, i.e., a higher percentage of
words can be bi-directionally translated using the
corresponding seed dictionary. A possible ex-
planation is that the comparable corpora were
constructed using different lists of query-terms.
Hence, the query-terms used for English-Spanish
retrieved a more coherent corpus. The resulting
values of corpus comparability indicate that the
context vectors will perform the best for English-
Spanish while for English-Japanese the perfor-
mance is expected to be substantially lower.

4.2 Training and evaluation datasets

For evaluation, we construct a test dataset of
single-word terms, in particular nouns or adjec-
tives. The dataset contains 1K terms that occur
more frequently than 20 but not more than 200
times and are listed in the English part of the
UMLS. In order to extract candidate translations,
we considered all nouns or adjectives that occur
at least 5 times in the target part of the corpus.
Furthermore, we do not constraint the evaluation
datasets only to those terms whose corresponding
translation occurs in the corpus.

The hybrid model that combines the composi-
tional and context clue, is based on a two-feature
model. Therefore, the model converges using only
a few hundred instances. For training a hybrid
model, we used 1K translation instances that oc-
curred in the training comparable corpora. Sim-
ilarly, to the character n-gram models, pseudo-
negative instances were generated by randomly
coupling non-translation terms. The ratio of posi-
tive to negative instances is 1 : 1.

5 Experiments

In this section, we present three experiments con-
ducted to evaluate the character n-gram, con-
text vector and hybrid methods. Firstly, we
examine the performance of the n-gram mod-
els on closely related language pairs (English-
French, English-Spanish), on a distant language
pair (English-Greek) and on an unrelated language
pair (English-Japanese). English and Greek are
not unrelated because they are members of the
same language family, but also not closely re-
lated because they use different scripts. Secondly,

1706



we compare the character n-gram methods against
context vectors when translating frequent or rare
terms and on comparable corpora of similar lan-
guage pairs (English-French, English-Spanish) but
of different corpus comparability scores. Thirdly,
we evaluate the hybrid method on all four com-
parable corpora and investigate the improvement
margin of combining the contextual with the com-
positional clue.

As evaluation metrics, we adopt the top-N
translation accuracy, following most previous ap-
proaches (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum,
2002; Morin et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2012). The
top-N translation accuracy is defined as the per-
centage of source terms for which a given method
has output the correct translation among the top N
candidate translations.

5.1 Character n-gram models

In the first experiment, we investigate the perfor-
mance of the character n-gram models consider-
ing an increasing number of features. The features
were sorted in order of decreasing frequency of oc-
currence. Starting from the top of the list, more
features were incrementally added and translation
accuracy was recorded.

Figure 2 shows the top-20 translation accu-
racy of single-word terms on an increasing num-
ber of first and second order features. With re-
gards to the first order models (Subfigure 2a),
the Random Forest (RF) classifier outperforms
our baseline method (SVM-RBF) for all four lan-
guage pairs. The largest margin between RF and
SVM-RBF can be observed for the English-Greek
dataset while for closely related language pairs,
i.e., English-French and English-Spanish, the mar-
gin is smaller. Furthermore, it can be noted that
using only a small number of first order features,
1K features (500 for the source and 500 for the
target language, both n-gram models reach a sta-
ble performance.

In contrast to the first order models, the Lo-
gReg classifier requires a large number of sec-
ond order features to achieve a robust performance
(Subfigure 2b). Starting from 100K features, the
translation accuracy continuously increases. The
best performance is observed for a total number
of 4M second order features when considering
the English-French, English-Spanish and English-
Greek datasets. For English-Japanese, the best
performance is achieved for 2M features. Beyond

this point, translation accuracy decreases slightly.
After feature selection is performed, we directly

compare all the character n-gram models. Table 3
summarises performance achieved by the LogReg,
RF and SVM-RBF models. It can be noted that
LogReg and RF performed similarly for closely
related languages (no statistically significant dif-
ferences were observed) while both methods out-
performed the SVM-RBF. However, for English-
Greek and English-Japanese, LogReg achieved
a statistically significant improvement over the
translation accuracy of RF and SVM-RBF. Lo-
gReg outperformed RF by 7% for English-Greek,
while for English-Japanese the improvement was
10% and 17% percent for top-1 and top-20 accu-
racy, respectively. Finally, it can be observed that
the more distant the language pair is, the lower the
performance.

5.2 N-gram methods and context vectors

In this experiment, we compare the n-gram meth-
ods against context vectors with regards to two pa-
rameters: (a) the frequency of source terms to be
translated and (b) corpus comparability. English-
French and English-Spanish are similar language
pairs but the corresponding corpora are of dif-
ferent corpus comparability scores. To investi-
gate how performance is affected by term occur-
rence frequency, we compiled an additional test
dataset of 1K rare English terms in the frequency
range [10, 20]. Our intuition is, that character n-
gram methods will perform similarly for all set-
tings since character n-grams are corpus indepen-
dent features.

We compare (a) the character n-gram models
(LogReg, RF and SVM-RBF) with (b) the con-
text vector method (context) and (c) an upper
bound. The latter represents the percentage of
source terms for which a reference translation ac-
tually occurs in the target corpus. Hence, the up-
per bound is the maximum performance achiev-
able according to the reference evaluation.

Figure 3a shows the top-20 translation accu-
racy for high and medium frequency terms, within
the frequency range [20, 200]. Context vectors
achieved a robust performance of 52% and 45%
for English-Spanish and English-French, respec-
tively. The difference in corpus comparability
can explain this 7% margin between these perfor-
mances. As shown in Table 2, the corpus com-
parability scores for English-Spanish and English-

Figure 3: Top-20 translation accuracy of terms in the frequency range of [10, 200] and [10, 20]

French are 0.75 and 0.71, respectively. In contrast
to context vectors, the character n-gram methods
performed comparably.

A second factor that affects the performance of
context vectors, is the frequency of the terms to
be translated. The translation of rare terms has
been shown to be a challenging case for context
vectors. For example, Morin and Daille (2010)
reported low accuracy (21% for the top-20 can-
didates) of context vectors for terms occurring 20
times or less. In our experiments, Figure 3b illus-
trates accuracies achieved for less frequent terms

([10, 20]). The performance of context vectors is
significantly lower, 26% for English-Spanish and
21% for English-French. Furthermore, the trans-
lation accuracy of the n-gram methods decreases
slightly (∼ 5% to 8%). This can be explained
by the decrease of the upper bound for lower fre-
quency terms (∼ 3% to 6%).

5.3 Combining internal and contextual
similarity

We have hypothesised that the compositional and
contextual clue are orthogonal, i.e., they convey

different and possibly complimentary information.
To investigate this intuition, we evaluate the hybrid
model on all four comparable corpora, for term oc-
currence frequencies in [20, 200].

Figure 4a illustrates top-20 translation accu-
racy scores for (a) the character n-gram models,
(b) the context vector method and (c) the hy-
brid models, i.e., LogReg+Context, RF+Context,
SVM-RBF+Context. We observe that the com-
bination of the compositional and contextual clue
improved the performance of all methods. The hy-
brid model largely improved the performance of
the SVM-RBF (∼ 14% to 20%). With regards
to the combined signals the translation accuracy
of LogReg and RF increased by ∼ 4% for the
English-Japanese corpus and ∼ 8% for all other
corpora.

For the top 1 candidate translation, we observe
in Figure 4 smaller improvements achieved by the
hybrid model in comparison to the top-20 accu-
racy. Interestingly, the RF classifier performed
slightly better on its own for English-French,
English-Spanish and English-Japanese. This in-
dicates that the hybrid method ranks more correct
translations in the top 20 candidates but it does not
always assign the best score to the correct answer.

6 Discusion and Future work

In this paper, we investigated a compositional
and a context-based approach useful for compil-
ing bilingual dictionaries of terms automatically
from comparable corpora. Compositional transla-
tion methods exploit the internal structure of terms
across languages while context-based approaches
investigate the surrounding lexical context.

We proposed a character n-gram composi-
tional method, i.e., a Logistic Regression clas-

sifier, which uses a multilingual representation,
i.e., source and target terms. Experimental evi-
dence showed that the LogReg classifier signifi-
cantly outperformed the baseline methods on dis-
tant languages. For closely related languages, Lo-
gReg performed comparably to an existing n-gram
method based on a Random Forest classifier.

Furthermore, we compared the n-gram models
against a context-based approach under different
corpus-specific parameters: (a) corpus compara-
bility, which is relevant to the seed dictionary, and
(b) the occurrence frequency of the terms to be
translated. It was shown that the performance of
n-gram methods was not affected by different pa-
rameter settings. Only small fluctuations were ob-
served, since the n-gram methods are based on
corpus-independent features, only. In contrast,
the context-based method was affected by corpus
comparability scores. The corresponding transla-
tion accuracy declined significantly for rare terms.

Finally, we hypothesised that the n-gram and
context-based methods provide complimentary in-
formation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a
hybrid method that combines compositional and
contextual similarity scores as features in a lin-
ear classifier. The hybrid model achieved signif-
icantly better top-20 translation accuracy than the
two methods separately but minor improvements
were observed in terms of top-1 accuracy.

As future work, we plan to improve the qual-
ity of the extracted dictionary further by exploiting
additional translation signals. For example, previ-
ous works (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Klemen-
tiev et al., 2012) have reported that the temporal
and topic similarity are clues that indicate transla-
tion equivalence. It would be interesting to investi-
gate the contribution of different clues for various

1709



experimental parameters, e.g., domain, distance of
languages, types of comparable corpora.
