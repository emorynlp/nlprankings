Abstract

Bilingual dictionaries are expensive resources
and not many are available when one of the
languages is resource-poor. In this paper, we
propose algorithms for creation of new reverse
bilingual dictionaries from existing bilingual
dictionaries in which English is one of the two
languages. Our algorithms exploit the simi-
larity between word-concept pairs using the
English Wordnet to produce reverse dictionary
entries. Since our algorithms rely on available
bilingual dictionaries, they are applicable to
any bilingual dictionary as long as one of the
two languages has Wordnet type lexical ontol-
ogy.

1 Introduction

The Ethnologue organization1 lists 6,809 distinct
languages in the world, most of which are resource-
poor. Most existing online bilingual dictionaries are
between two resource-rich languages (e.g., English,
Spanish, French or German) or between a resource-
rich language and a resource-poor language. There
are languages for which we are lucky to find a single
bilingual dictionary online. For example, the Uni-
versity of Chicago hosts bilingual dictionaries from
29 Southeast Asian languages2, but many of these
languages have only one bilingual dictionary online.

Existing algorithms for creating new bilingual
dictionaries use intermediate languages or interme-
diate dictionaries to find chains of words with the
same meaning. For example, (Gollins and Sander-
son, 2001) use lexical triangulation to translate in
parallel across multiple intermediate languages and

fuse the results. They query several existing dictio-
naries and then merge results to maximize accuracy.
They use four pivot languages, German, Spanish,
Dutch and Italian, as intermediate languages. An-
other existing approach for creating bilingual dictio-
naries is using probabilistic inference (Mausam et
al., 2010). They organize dictionaries in a graph
topology and use random walks and probabilistic
graph sampling. (Shaw et al., 2011) propose a set
of algorithms to create a reverse dictionary in the
context of single language by using converse map-
ping. In particular, given an English-English dictio-
nary, they attempt to find the original words or terms
given a synonymous word or phrase describing the
meaning of a word.

The goal of this research is to study the feasibility
of creating a reverse dictionary by using only one ex-
isting dictionary and Wordnet lexical ontology. For
example, given a Karbi3-English dictionary, we will
construct an ENG-AJZ dictionary. The remainder of
this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
discuss the nature of bilingual dictionaries. Section
3 describes the algorithms we propose to create new
bilingual dictionaries from existing dictionaries. Re-
sults of our experiments are presented in Section 4.
Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Existing Online Bilingual Dictionaries

Powerful online translators developed by Google
and Bing provide pairwise translations (including
for individual words) for 65 and 40 languages, re-
spectively. Wiktionary, a dictionary created by vol-
unteers, supports over 170 languages. We find a

large number of bilingual dictionaries at PanLex4

including an ENG-Hindi5 and a Vietnamese6-ENG
dictionary. The University of Chicago has a number
of bilingual dictionaries for South Asian languages.
Xobdo7 has a number of dictionaries, focused on
Northeast India.

We classify the many freely available dictionaries
into three main kinds.
• Word to word dictionaries: These are dictionar-

ies that translate one word in one language to
one word or a phrase in another language. An
example is an ENG-HIN dictionary at Panlex.
• Definition dictionaries: One word in one lan-

guage has one or more meanings in the second
language. It also may have pronunciation, parts
of speech, synonyms and examples. An exam-
ple is the VIE-ENG dictionary, also at Panlex.
• One language dictionaries: A dictionary of this

kind is found at dictionary.com.

We have examined several hundred online dictionar-
ies and found that they occur in many different for-
mats. Extracting information from these dictionaries
is arduous. We have experimented with five existing
bilingual dictionaries: VIE-ENG, ENG-HIN, and a
dictionary supported by Xobdo with 4 languages:
Assamese8, ENG, AJZ, and Dimasa9. We consider
the last one to be a collection of 3 bilingual dictio-
naries: ASM-ENG, AJZ-ENG, and DIS-ENG. We
choose these languages since one of our goals is to
work with resource-poor languages to enhance the
quantity and quality of resources available.

3 Proposed Solution Approach

A dictionary entry, called LexicalEntry, is a 2-tuple
<LexicalUnit, Definition>. A LexicalUnit is a
word or a phrase being defined, also called definien-
dum (Landau, 1984). A list of entries sorted by
the LexicalUnit is called a lexicon or a dictionary.
Given a LexicalUnit, the Definition associated with
it usually contains its class and pronunciation, its

6ISO 693-3 code VIE
7http://www.xobdo.org/
8Assamese is an Indo-European language spoken by about

30 million people, but it is resource-poor, ISO 693-3 code ASM.

dia, spoken by about 115,000 people, ISO 693-3 code DIS.

meaning, and possibly additional information. The
meaning associated with it can have several Senses.
A Sense is a discrete representation of a single aspect
of the meaning of a word. Thus, a dictionary entry
is of the form <LexicalUnit, Sense1, Sense2, · · ·>.

In this section, we propose a series of algorithms,
each one of which automatically creates a reverse
dictionary, or ReverseDictionary, from a dictio-
nary that translates a word in language L1 to a word
or phrase in language L2. We require that at least
one of two these languages has a Wordnet type lexi-
cal ontology (Miller, 1995). Our algorithms are used
to create reverse dictionaries from them at various
levels of accuracy and sophistication.

3.1 Direct Reversal (DR)

The existing dictionary has alphabetically sorted
LexicalUnits in L1 and each of them has one or
more Senses in L2. To create ReverseDictionary,
we simply take every pair <LexicalUnit, Sense>
in SourceDictionary and swap the positions of the
two.

Algorithm 1 DR Algorithm
ReverseDictionary := φ
for allLexicalEntryi ∈ SourceDictionary do

for all Sensej ∈ LexicalEntryi do
Add tuple <Sensej ,
LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit> to
ReverseDictionary

end for
end for

This is a baseline algorithm so that we can com-
pare improvements as we create new algorithms.
If in our input dictionary, the sense definitions
are mostly single words, and occasionally a sim-
ple phrase, even such a simple algorithm gives
fairly good results. In case there are long or com-
plex phrases in senses, we skip them. The ap-
proach is easy to implement, and produces a high-
accuracy ReverseDictionary. However, the num-
ber of entries in the created dictionaries are lim-
ited because this algorithm just swaps the posi-
tions of LexicalUnit and Sense of each entry in the
SourceDictionary and does not have any method
to find the additional words having the same mean-
ings.

3.2 Direct Reversal with Distance (DRwD)

To increase the number of entries in the output dic-
tionary, we compute the distance between words
in the Wordnet hierarchy. For example, the words
"hasta-lipi" and "likhavat" in HIN have the meanings
"handwriting" and "script", respectively. The dis-
tance between "handwriting" and "script" in Word-
net hierarchy is 0.0, so that "handwriting" and
"script" likely have the same meaning. Thus, each of
"hasta-lipi" and "likhavat" should have both mean-
ings "handwriting" and "script". This approach
helps us find additional words having the same
meanings and possibly increase the number of lexi-
cal entries in the reverse dictionaries.

To create a ReverseDictionary, for every
LexicalEntryi in the existing dictionary,
we find all LexicalEntryj , i 6= j with dis-
tance to LexicalEntryi equal to or smaller
than a threshold α. As results, we have new
pairs of entries <LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit,
LexicalEntryj .Sense> ; then we swap positions
in the two-tuples, and add them into the Reverse-
Dictionary. The value of α affects the number of
entries and the quality of created dictionaries. The
greater the value of α, the larger the number of
lexical entries, but the smaller the accuracy of the
ReverseDictionary.

The distance between the two LexicalEntrys is the
distance between the two LexicalUnits if the Lexi-
calUnits occur in Wordnet ontology; otherwise, it is
the distance between the two Senses. The distance
between each phrase pair is the average of the to-
tal distances between every word pair in the phrases
(Wu and Palmer, 1994). If the distance between two
words or phrases is 1.00, there is no similarity be-
tween these words or phrases, but if they have the
same meaning, the distance is 0.00.

We find that aReverseDictionary created using
the value 0.0 for α has the highest accuracy. This ap-
proach significantly increases the number of entries
in the ReverseDictionary. However, there is an is-
sue in this approach. For instance, the word "tuhbi"
in DIS means "crowded", "compact", "dense", or
"packed". Because the distance between the En-
glish words "slow" and "dense" in Wordnet is 0.0,
this algorithm concludes that "slow" has the mean-
ing "tuhbi" also, which is wrong.

Algorithm 2 DRwD Algorithm
ReverseDictionary := φ
for allLexicalEntryi ∈ SourceDictionary do

for all Sensej ∈ LexicalEntryi do
for all LexicalEntryu ∈
SourceDictionary do

for all Sensev ∈ LexicalEntryu do
if distance(<LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit,
Sensej> ,<LexicalEntryu.LexicalUnit,
Sensev> ) 6 α then

Add tuple <Sensej ,
LexicalEntryu.LexicalUnit>
to ReverseDictionary

end if
end for

end for
end for

end for

3.3 Direct Reversal with Similarly (DRwS)

The DRwD approach computes simply the dis-
tance between two senses, but does not look at
the meanings of the senses in any depth. The
DRwS approach represents a concept in terms of
its Wordnet synset10, synonyms, hyponyms and
hypernyms. This approach is like the DRwD
approach, but instead of computing the distance
between lexical entries in each pair, we calcu-
late the similarity, called simValue. If the sim-
Value of a <LexicalEntryi,LexicalEntryj>, i 6=
j pair is equal or larger than β, we conclude
that the LexicalEntryi has the same meaning as
LexicalEntryj .

To calculate simValue between two phrases, we
obtain the ExpansionSet for every word in each
phrase from the WordNet database. An Expansion-
Set of a phrase is a union of synset, and/or synonym,
and/or hyponym, and/or hypernym of every word in
it. We compare the similarity between the Expan-
sionSets. The value of β and the kinds of Expan-
sionSets are changed to create different ReverseDic-
tionarys. Based on experiments, we find that the best
value of β is 0.9, and the best ExpansionSet is the
union of synset, synonyms, hyponyms, and hyper-
nyms. The algorithm for computing the simValue of
entries is shown in Algorithm 3.

10Synset is a set of cognitive synonyms.

4 Experimental results

The goals of our study are to create the high-
precision reverse dictionaries, and to increase the
numbers of lexical entries in the created dictio-
naries. Evaluations were performed by volunteers
who are fluent in both source and destination lan-
guages. To achieve reliable judgment, we use the
same set of 100 non-stop word ENG words, ran-
domly chosen from a list of the most common
words11. We pick randomly 50 words from each
created ReverseDictionary for evaluation. Each
volunteer was requested to evaluate using a 5-point
scale, 5: excellent, 4: good, 3: average, 2: fair, and
1: bad. The average scores of entries in the Reverse-
Dictionarys is presented in Figure 1. The DRwS dic-
tionaries are the best in each case. The percentage of
agreements between raters is in all cases is around
70%.

The dictionaries we work with frequently have
several meanings for a word. Some of these mean-
ings are unusual, rare or very infrequently used. The

11http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm

DR algorithm creates entries for the rare or unusual
meanings by direct reversal. We noticed that our
evaluators do not like such entries in the reversed
dictionaries and mark them low. This results in
lower average scores in the DR algorithm compar-
ing to averages cores in the DRwS algorithm. The
DRwS algorithm seems to have removed a number
of such unusual or rare meanings (and entries simi-
lar to the rare meanings, recursively) improving the
average score

Our proposed approaches do not work well for
dictionaries containing an abundance of complex
phrases. The original dictionaries, except the VIE-
ENG dictionary, do not contain many long phrases
or complex words. In Vietnamese, most words
we find in the dictionary can be considered com-
pound words composed of simpler words put to-
gether. However, the component words are sepa-
rated by space. For example, "bái thần giáo" means
"idolatry". The component words are "bái" mean-
ing "bow low"; "thần" meaning "deity"; and "giáo"
meaning "lance", "spear", "to teach", or "to edu-
cate". The presence of a large number of compound
words written in this manner causes problems with
the ENG-VIE dictionary. If we look closely at Fig-
ure 1, all language pairs, except ENG-VIE show
substantial improvement in score when we compare
the DR algorithm with DRwS algorithm.

Figure 1: Average entry score in ReverseDictionary

The DRwD approach significantly increases the
number of entries, but the accuracy of the created
dictionaries is much lower. The DRwS approach us-
ing a union of synset, synonyms, hyponyms, and hy-
pernyms of words, and β ≥ 0.9 produces the best re-
verse dictionaries for each language pair. The DRwS
approach increases the number of entries in the cre-
ated dictionaries compared to the DR algorithm as

shown in Figure 2.

ReverseDictionarys generated from 100 common
words

We also create the entire reverse dictionary for
the AJZ-ENG dictionary. The total number of en-
tries in the ENG-AJZ dictionaries created by us-
ing the DR algorithm and DRwS algorithm are
4677 and 5941, respectively. Then, we pick 100
random words from the ENG-AJZ created by us-
ing the DRwS algorithm for evaluation. The av-
erage score of every entry in this created dictio-
nary is 4.07. Some of the reversal bilingual dictio-
naries can be downloaded at http://cs.uccs.edu/ lin-
clab/creatingBilingualLexicalResource.html.

5 Conclusion

We proposed approaches to create a reverse dic-
tionary from an existing bilingual dictionary using
Wordnet. We show that a high precision reverse dic-
tionary can be created without using any other inter-
mediate dictionaries or languages. Using the Word-
net hierarchy increases the number of entries in the
created dictionaries. We perform experiments with
several resource-poor languages including two that
are in the UNESCO’s list of endangered languages.
