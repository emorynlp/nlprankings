Abstract 

This paper presents a three-way perspective on 
the annotation of discourse in scientific 
literature. We use three different schemes, each 
of which focusses on different aspects of 
discourse in scientific articles, to annotate a 
corpus of three full-text papers, and compare 
the results. One scheme seeks to identify the 
core components of scientific investigations at 
the sentence level, a second annotates meta-
knowledge pertaining to bio-events and a third 
considers how epistemic knowledge is 
conveyed at the clause level. We present our 
analysis of the comparison, and a discussion of 
the contributions of each scheme.  

1 Introduction 

The literature boom in the life sciences over the 
past few years has sparked increasing interest into 
text mining tools, which facilitate the automatic 
extraction of useful knowledge from text 
(Ananiadou et al., 2006; Ananiadou  &  
McNaught, 2006; Zweigenbaum et al., 2007; 
Cohen  &  Hunter, 2008). Most of these tools have 
focussed on entity recognition and relation 
extraction and with few exceptions, e.g., (Hyland, 
1996; Light et al., 2004; Sándor, 2007; Vincze et 
al., 2008), do not take into account the discourse 
context of the knowledge extracted. However, 
failure to take this context into account results in 
the loss of information vital for the correct 
interpretation of extracted knowledge, e.g. the 
scope of the relations, or the level of certainty with 
which they are expressed. A particular piece of 

knowledge may represent, e.g., an accepted fact, 
hypothesis, results of an experiment, analysis 
based on experimental results, factual or 
speculative statements etc. Furthermore, this 
knowledge may represent the author's current 
work, or work reported elsewhere. The ability to 
recognise different discourse elements 
automatically provides crucial information for the 
correct interpretation of extracted knowledge, 
allowing scientific claims to be linked to 
experimental evidence, or newly reported 
experimental knowledge to be isolated. The 
importance of categorising such knowledge 
becomes more pronounced as analysis moves from 
abstracts to full papers, where the content is richer 
and linguistic constructions are more complex 
(Cohen et al., 2010). Analysis of full papers is 
extremely important, since less than 8% of 
scientific claims occur in abstracts (Blake, 2010). 

Various different schemes for annotating 
discourse elements in scientific texts have been 
proposed. The schemes vary along several axes, 
including perspective, motivation, complexity and 
the granularity of the units of text to which the 
scheme is applied. Faced with such variety, it is 
important to be able to select the best scheme(s) 
for the purpose at hand. Answers to questions such 
as the following can help in the selection process: 
1. What are the relative merits of the different 

schemes? 
2. What are the similarities and differences 

between schemes? 
3. Can annotation according to multiple schemes 

provide enhanced information?

4. Is there any advantage in merging annotation 

schemes or is it better to allow complementary 
and different dimensions of scientific discourse 
annotation?	  

As a starting point to addressing such questions, 
we provide a comparison of three different 
schemes for the annotation of discourse elements 
within scientific papers. Each scheme has a 
different perspective and motivation:, one is 
content-driven, seeking to identify the main 
components of a scientific investigation, another is 
driven by the need to describe events of biomedical 
relevance and the third focusses on how epistemic 
knowledge is conveyed in discourse.  

These different viewpoints mean that the 
schemes vary in both the type and complexity of 
the discourse elements identified, as well as the 
types of units to which the annotation is applied, 
i.e. complete sentences, segments of sentences, or 
specific relations/events occurring within these 
sentences. To facilitate the comparison, we have 
annotated three full papers according to each of the 
schemes. The analysis resulting from this three-
way annotation considers mappings between 
schemes, their relative merits, and how the 
information annotated by the different schemes can 

complement each other to provide enriched details 
about knowledge extracted from the texts. 

In the following sections, we firstly provide a 
description of the three schemes, and then explain 
how they have been used in our corpus annotation. 
Finally we discuss the results from the comparison, 
and the features of each scheme. 

2 Sentence annotation: CoreSC scheme  

The reasoning behind this scheme is that a paper is 
the human-readable representation of a scientific 
investigation. Therefore, the goal of the annotation 
is to retrieve the content model of scientific 
investigations as reflected within scientific 
discourse. The hypothesis is that there is a set of 
core scientific concepts (CoreSC), which constitute 
the key components of a scientific investigation. 
CoreSCs consist of 11 concepts originating from 
the CISP (Core Information about Scientific 
Papers) meta-data (Soldatova  &  Liakata, 2007), 
which are a subset of classes from the EXPO 
ontology for the description of scientific 
experiments (Soldatova  &  King, 2006). The 
CoreSCs are: Motivation, Goal, Object, 
Background, Hypothesis, Method, Model, 
Experiment, Observation, Result and Conclusion. 

38



Figure 1.  Bio-Event Representation 

The CoreSC scheme (Liakata et al., 2010; 
Liakata et al., 2012) implements the above-
mentioned concepts as a 3-layered sentence-based 
annotation scheme. This means that each sentence 
in a document is assigned one of the 11 CoreSC 
concepts. The scheme also considers a layer 
designated to properties of the concepts (e.g. New 
Method vs Old Method) as well as identifiers 
which link instances of the same concept across 
sentences. A short definition of CoreSC categories 
and their properties can be found in Table 1.  

The CoreSC scheme is accompanied by 47-page 
annotation guidelines, and has been used by 16 
domain experts to annotate a corpus of 265 full 
papers from physical chemistry & biochemistry 
(Liakata  &  Soldatova, 2009; Liakata et al., 2010). 
This corpus consists of 40,000 sentences, 
containing over 1 million words and was 
developed in three phases (for details see Liakata 
et al. (2012)). Inter-annotator agreement between 
experts was measured in terms of Cohen’s kappa 
(Cohen, 1960) on 41 papers and ranged between 
0.5 and 0.7. Machine learning classifiers have been 
trained on the CoreSC corpus, achieving > 51% 
accuracy across the eleven categories. The most 
accurately predicted category is Experiment, the 
category describing experimental methods (Liakata 
et al., 2012). Classifiers trained on 1000 Biology 
abstracts annotated with CoreSC have obtained an 
accuracy of over 80% (Guo et al., 2010). Models 
trained on the CoreSC corpus papers have been 
used to create automatic summaries of the papers, 
which have been evaluated in a question answering 
task (Liakata et al., 2012). Lastly, the CoreSC 
scheme was used to annotate 50 papers from 
Pubmed Central pertaining to Cancer Risk 
Assessment. A web tool (SAPIENTA 1 ) allows 
users to annotate their full papers with Core 
Scientific concepts, and can be combined with 
manual annotation. A UIMA framework 2 
implementation of this code for large-scale 
annotation of CoreSC concepts is in progress. 

3 Event annotation: Meta-knowledge for 
bio-events 

The motivation for this annotation scheme is to 
allow the training of more sophisticated event-

based information extraction systems. In contrast 
to the sentence-based scheme described in section 
2, this scheme is applied at the level of events 
(Ananiadou et al., 2010), of which there may be 
several within a single sentence. 

3.1 Bio-Events 
Events are template-like, structured representations 
of pieces of knowledge contained within sentences. 
Normally, events are “anchored” to a trigger 
(typically a verb or noun) around which the 
knowledge expressed is organised. Each event has 
one of more participants, which describe different 
aspects of the event. Participants can correspond to 
entities or other events, and are often labelled with 
semantic roles, e.g., CAUSE, THEME, 
LOCATION, etc. The work described here 
focusses specifically on bio-events, which are 
complex structured relations representing fine-
grained relations between bio-entities and their 
modifiers. Figure 1 provides some examples of 
bio-events. Event extraction systems (Björne et al., 
2009; Miwa et al., 2010; Miwa et al., 2012; Quirk 
et al., 2011) are typically trained on text corpora, in 
which events and their participants have been 
manually annotated by domain experts. Research 
into bio-event extraction has been boosted by the 
two recent shared tasks at BioNLP 2009/2011 
(Kim et al., 2011; Pyysalo et al., In Press). Several 
gold standard event annotated corpora exist; 
examples include the GENIA Event Corpus (Kim 
et al., 2008), GREC (Thompson et al., 2009) and 
BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007), in addition to the 
corpora produced for the shared tasks. 

3.2 Meta-knowledge Annotation 
Until recently, the only attempts to recognise 
information relating to the correct interpretation of 
events were restricted to sparse details regarding 
negation and speculation (Kim et al., 2011). 

39



In order to address this problem, a multi-
dimensional annotation scheme especially tailored 
to bio-events was developed (Nawaz et al., 2010; 
Thompson et al., 2011). The scheme identifies and 
categorises several different types of contextual 
details regarding events (termed meta-knowledge), 
including discourse information. Different types of 
meta-knowledge are encoded through five distinct 
dimensions (Figure 2). The advantage of using 
multiple dimensions is that the interplay between 
the assigned values in each dimension can reveal 
both subtle and substantial differences in the types 
of meta-knowledge expressed. 

In the majority of cases, meta-knowledge is 
expressed through the presence of particular “clue” 
words or phrases, although other features can also 
come into play, such as the tense of the event 
trigger, or the relative position within the text. 

Figure 2: Meta-knowledge annotation 
	  
The annotation task consists of assigning an 
appropriate value from a fixed set for each 
dimension, as well as marking the textual evidence 
for this assignment. The five meta-knowledge 
dimensions and their values are as follows: 
Knowledge Type (KT): Captures the general 
information content of the event. Each event is 
classified as one of: Investigation (enquiries and 
examinations, etc.), Observation (direct 
experimental observations), Analysis (inferences, 
interpretations and conjectures, etc.), Fact (known 
facts), Method (methods) or Other (general events 
that provide incomplete information or do not fit 
into any other category).  
Certainty Level (CL): Encodes the confidence or 
certainty level ascribed to the event in the given 
text. The epistemic scale is partitioned into three 
distinct levels: L3 (no expression of uncertainty), 

L2 (high confidence or slight speculation) and L1 
(low confidence or considerable speculation). 
Polarity: Identifies negated events. Negation is 
defined as the absence or non-existence of an 
entity or a process. 
Manner: Captures information about the rate, 
level, strength or intensity of the event, using three 
values: High, Low, or Neutral (no indication of 
rate/intensity). 
Source:  Encodes the source of the knowledge 
being expressed by the event as Current (the 
current study) or Other (any other source). 
     Of these five dimensions, only KT, CL and 
Source were considered during the comparison 
with the other two schemes, since they are directly 
related to discourse analysis.  

The GENIA event corpus, consisting of 1000 
abstracts with 36,115 events (Kim et al., 2008) has 
been annotated with meta-knowledge by 2 
annotators, supported by 64-page annotation 
guidelines 3  (Thompson et al., 2011). Inter-
annotator agreement rates ranged between 0.84–
0.93 (Cohen’s Kappa).  Research has been carried 
out into the automatic assignment of Manner 
values to events (Nawaz et al., In Press).  In 
addition, the EventMine-MK service (Miwa et al., 
In Press), based on EventMine (Miwa et al., 2010) 
facilitates automatic extraction of biomedical 
events with meta-knowledge assigned. The 
performance of EventMine-MK in assigning 
different meta-knowledge values to events ranges 
between 57% and 87% (macro-averaged F-Score) 
on the BioNLP’09 Shared Task corpus (Kim et al, 
2011). EventMine-MK is available as a component 
of the U-Compare interoperable text mining 
system4 (Kano et al., 2011). 

4 Clause annotation: Segments for 
epistemic knowledge 

The third scheme we consider uses a Discourse 
Segment Type classification of segments at, 
roughly, a clause level, i.e., each segment has a 
main verb. This means that the level of granularity 
of argumentational elements in this scheme lies 
between the other two schemes, i.e. it is usually 
more granular than CoreSC, but sometimes less 
granular than the event-based scheme.

Table 2:  Discourse Segment Types 

	  
The segment annotation scheme identifies a 
taxonomy of discourse segment types that seem to 
be exclusive and useful (de Waard & Pander Maat, 
2009). Three classes of segment types are defined:  
− Basic segment types: segments referring 

directly to the topic of study – see Table 2.  
− ‘Other’-segment types: segments referring to 

conceptual or experimental work in other 
research papers than the current one 

− Regulatory segment types: ‘regulatory’ clauses 
that control and introduce other segments.  

A list of segment types is presented in Table 2; 
further details, including a list of all segment types 
and correlations with verb tense can be found in de 
Waard  &  Pander Maat (2009). The focus of this 
work is to identify linguistic features that 
characterise these discourse segment types, 
according to three aspects: 
− Verb tense, aspect, mood and voice 
− Semantic verb class 
− Epistemic modality markers 

So far, 6 full-text papers (comprising about 2300 
segments) have been manually annotated with 
segment types and correlated with the above 
features. A first automated validation was 
promising (de Waard, Buitelaar and Eigener, 
2009). The need for parsing at a clause level is 
especially prominent in biological text, since 
specific semantic roles are played by particular 
clause types. We give four examples of typical 

clause constructions that play a specific rhetorical 
role: firstly, reporting clauses are often sentence-
initial ‘that’ matrix clauses (1a): 
1. a.  This suggests that  
1.b. miR-372 and miR-373 caused the observed  
selective growth advantage. 

Secondly, descriptions confirming certain 
accepted characteristics of biological entities are 
often given as nonrestrictive relative clauses (2b):  
2.a. We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the  
RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene,  

2. b. which is only active when tamoxifen is 
added  

Thirdly, a subordinate gerund clause is often 
used to describe a method (3a), with a main (finite) 
clause describing a result (3b) and fourthly, 
experimental goals are often given as a (mostly 
sentence-initial) clause with a to-infinitive (4a) 
often preceding a past-tense methods clause (4b). 
3. a. Using fluorescence microscopy and luciferase 
assays, 
b. we observed potent and specific miRNA activity 
expressed from each miR-Vec (Figure S2). 
4. a. To identify miRNAs that can interfere with 
this process  
4. b. we transduced BJ/ET fibroblasts with miR-Lib  

However, the lack of simple robust clause 
parsers has prevented the automated identification 
of semantic roles at the clause level. Therefore, this 
scheme has so far only been manually

implemented. Despite being less widely 
implemented than the other two schemes, we 
believe that the segment scheme offers some useful 
pointers for linguistic features that can identify 
particular rhetorical classes in the text, and 
secondly, offers an interesting perspective on the 
fact that in biological text, several rhetorical moves 
are made within a single sentence.  

5 Data and methods 

Three papers already annotated according to the 
GENIA event annotation scheme (Kim et al., 
2008), were further annotated according to the 
three annotation schemes described above. We 
obtained all corresponding CoreSCs, events and 
segments per sentence. Each sentence has a single 
CoreSC annotation and one or more segment 
annotations (depending on the number of clauses). 
Event annotations in a sentence may range from 
zero to multiple, according to whether any relevant 
biomedical events are described in the sentence.  

Events within a sentence are mapped to 
segments by identifying which segment contains 
the trigger for a particular event. The three meta-
knowledge dimensions for events considered in 
this comparison, i.e., KT, CL and Source, result in 
16 different combinations of values encountered in 
the three papers. The numbers for CoreSC and 
Segment labels encountered were 12 and 22, 
respectively. Confusion matrices were obtained for 
each paper and for each pair of annotation 
schemes. Note that, as bio-events are largely 
unconcerned with describing methodology, the 
Methods sections of these papers do not contain 
event annotation or meta-knowledge annotation. 
The pairwise confusion matrices from each paper 
were combined, resulting in three matrices (Tables 
3, 4 and 5), which describe the associations 
between the annotation schemes in the three papers 
examined. We have highlighted the highest 
frequencies per row and where appropriate also the 
highest values per column. The use of two 
different colours aims to facilitate readability. 

6 Results and Discussion 

We present the results from analysing the pairwise 
confusion matrices for the three schemes and 
discuss the merits of each scheme. 

6.1 Event Meta-knowledge v. CoreSC 
In Tables 3 (and 5), the meta-knowledge categories 
combine KT, CL and Source ((O)ther) values. 
Table 3 shows some straightforward and expected 
mappings, e.g.,Method (Met,L3) events are almost 
always found within CoreSC Experiment or 
Method sentences, whilst Investigation events 
(Inv,L3) occur most frequently within CoreSC 
Goal or Motivation sentences.  

For other categories, information from the two 
schemes can complement each other in different 
ways. For example, KT and Source information 
about events can help to distinguish different types 
of information within CoreSC Background 
sentences (top left corner of Table 3). Such 
information mainly corresponds to facts, 
observations from previous studies, or analyses of 
information. Conversely, information from the 
CoreSC scheme can help to further classify the 
interpretation of events. For example, events with 
an analytical interpretation (Ana,L1,L2,L3) may 
occur as background information to a study (Bac), 
as hypotheses (Hyp),  as part of observations 
(Obs), when reporting the results of the current 
study (Res) or when making concluding remarks 
about the study (Con). CoreSCs can also help to 
further refine events relating to outcomes (Obs,L3) 
according to whether they pertain to 
(Obs)ervations, (Res)ults or (Con)clusions. 

CoreSC Conclusion, Result and Observation 
sentences contain mainly Observation events 
concerned with the current study. However, such 
sentences often also include an analytical part, with 
varying levels of certainty, which event 
information can help to isolate. The CL annotated 
for events is also useful in helping to determine the 
confidence with which information is stated in 
CoreSC Conclusion and Hypothesis sentences.  

Due to the nature of bio-event annotation, only a 
small number of events correspond to methods. 
Thus, CoreSC provides a more detailed 
characterisation of method-related sentences, i.e., 
Experiment, Method_New, Model and Object. 

6.2 Discourse Segments v. CoreSC 
In most cases, there seems to be natural mapping 
between the two schemes (See Table 4). CoreSC 
Observation maps to Result, CoreSC Method and 
Experiment map to Method, CoreSC Hypothesis 
maps to Hypothesis, CoreSC Goal maps to Goal, 

42



CoreSC Conclusion maps to Implication and 
Hypothesis, CoreSC Result maps to Implication 
and Result, and Problem is equivalent to CoreSC 
Motivation. The bulk of CoreSC Background maps 
to Fact and Other-Implication, but the “Other” 
Segment categories provide a substantial 
refinement of the CoreSC Background category.  
 

 
Table 3. Event Meta-knowledge vs CoreSC 

 
  On the other hand, CoreSC refines Method, 
Result and Implication segments. CoreSC Result 
may include both Fact and Method clauses, which 
can be captured by the Segment scheme, since 
annotation is performed at the clause level. CoreSC 
Conclusion maps to both Implication and 
Hypothesis segments, suggesting that there may be 
differences in the certainty levels of these 
conclusions. This is supported by preliminary 
classification experiments (paper in progress).  
	  
6.3 Discourse Segments v. Event Meta-
Knowledge	  

 
Some straightforward mappings exist between 
segment and event meta-knowledge categories 
(Table 5). For example, Investigation events (Inv, 
L3) are generally found within Goal and Problem 
segments; Method events (Met,L3) are normally 
found within Method segments, Observation events 
(Obs,L3) are found mainly within Result, Fact and 
Implication segments and (Ana,L1,L2) events 
correspond mainly to Hypotheses and Implications. 

Whilst these are similar findings to the 
comparison between event meta-knowledge and 
CoreSCs, the variance of the distribution is often 
smaller when mapping from Events to Segments. 
This is to be expected – the information encoded 
by many events has the scope of roughly a clause, 
which corresponds closely to the scope of 

discourse segments. This could permit cleaner one-
to-one mappings between categories. 

 
Table 4: Segments vs CoreSC 

	  

 Hypothesis and Implication segments mainly 
contain (Ana)lysis events. The differing certainty 
levels of events can help to refine information 
about the statements made within these segments. 
Likewise, these segment types could help to refine 
the nature of the analysis described by the event.   

Similarly to the CoreSC scheme, the results 
suggest that Result segments could be refined by 
the meta-knowledge scheme to distinguish 
between results emerging from direct experimental 
observations, and those obtained through analysis 
of experimental observations. Another interesting 
result is that Fact segments can contain Fact, 
(Ana)lysis or (Obs)ervation events. This may 
suggest that Fact segments are actually a rather 
general category, containing a range of different 
information. Few events occur within the 
Regulatory segments, as these mainly introduce 
content-bearing segments.  

The majority of Method segments and a 
significant number of the Result segments do not 
correspond to events, as none of the methods 
sections have been annotated with event 
information, for reasons explained previously.

7 Related Work 

A number of schemes for annotating scientific 
discourse elements at the sentence level have been 
proposed. Certain schemes have been aimed at 
abstracts, e.g., (McKnight  &  Srinivasan, 2003; 
Ruch et al., 2007; Hirohata et al., 2008; Björne et 
al., 2009). The work of Hirohata et al. (2009) has 
been integrated with the MEDIE service5 (Miyao et 
al., 2006), allowing the user to query facts using 
conclusions, results, etc. For full papers, the most 
notable work has focussed on argumentative 
zoning (AZ) (Teufel et al., 1999; Teufel  &  
Moens, 2002; Teufel et al., 2009; Teufel, 2010). 
An important aspect of AZ involves capturing the 
attribution of knowledge claims and citation 
function, and the scheme has been tested on 
information extraction and summarisation tasks 
with Computational Linguistics papers. AZ was 
modified for the annotation of biology papers by 
Mizuta et al. (2005) in order to facilitate 
information extraction, and more recently Teufel et 
al. (2009) extended the AZ scheme to better 
accommodate the life sciences and chemistry in 
particular, producing AZ-II. 
Scientific discourse annotation has also targeted 
the retrieval of speculative text to help improve 
curation. For a recent overview see de Waard and 
Pander Maat (2012).  Modality and negation in text 
have also been the focus of recent workshops 
(Farkas et al (2010), Morante & Sporleder (2012)). 
Finally, Shatkay et al (2008) define a multi-
dimensional scheme, which combines several of 
the above-mentioned aspects. 
     Recent work has compared schemes to discover 
mappings and relative merits. Liakata et al. (2010) 
compared AZ-II and CoreSC on 36 papers 
annotated with both schemes and found that 
CoreSC provides finer granularity in distinguishing 
content categories (e.g. methods, goals and 
outcomes) while the strength of AZ-II lies in 
detecting the attribution of knowledge claims and 
identifying the different functions of background 
information. Guo et al. (2010) compared three 
schemes for the identification of discourse 
structure in scientific abstracts from cancer 
research assessment articles. The work showed a 
subsumption relation between the scheme of 
Hirohata et al. (2008), a cut-down version of the 

                                                
5 http://www.nactem.ac.uk/medie/ 

scheme proposed by Teufel et al. (2009) and 
CoreSC (1st layer), from general to specific.	  

8  Conclusion 

We have compared three different schemes, each 
taking a different perspective to the annotation of 
scientific discourse. The comparison shows that 
the three schemes are complementary, with 
different strengths and points of focus. CoreSC 
offers a fine-grained characterisation of methods, 
outcomes and objectives. It has been used to 
annotate a collection of 265 full papers, and 
subsequently CoreSC recognition has been fully 
automated, creating the online SAPIENTA tool. 
The discourse segment annotation scheme can help 
to provide a finer-grained characterisation of 
background work, and could also help to split 
multi-clause CoreSC sentences into appropriate 
segments. Recognition of event meta-knowledge 
has been fully automated in the U-Compare 
framework, and the KT values of the scheme can 
help to provide a finer-grained analysis of certain 
segment and sentence types. The CL dimension 
also allows confidence values to be ascribed to the 
Conclusion, Result, Implication and Hypothesis 
categories of the other two schemes.   
Future work will focus on annotating texts with 
several discourse perspectives to investigate the 
advantages of the schemes. Ideally we would like 
to propose a unified approach for scientific 
discourse annotation, but recognize that choices 
such as the unit of annotation are often task-
oriented, and that users should be able to mix and 
match discourse segments as required. This said, 
the analysis in this paper paves the way for 
potential harmonisation, revealing points of union 
and intersection between the schemes.
