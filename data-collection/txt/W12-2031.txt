Abstract

In this paper we describe the technical im-
plementation of our system that participated
in the Helping Our Own 2012 Shared Task
(HOO-2012). The system employs a num-
ber of preprocessing steps and machine learn-
ing classifiers for correction of determiner and
preposition errors in non-native English texts.
We use maximum entropy classifiers trained
on the provided HOO-2012 development data
and a large high-quality English text collec-
tion. The system proposes a number of highly-
probable corrections, which are evaluated by a
language model and compared with the origi-
nal text. A number of deterministic rules are
used to increase the precision and recall of the
system. Our system is ranked among the three
best performing HOO-2012 systems with a
precision of 31.15%, recall of 22.08% and F1-
score of 25.84% for correction of determiner
and preposition errors combined.

1 Introduction

The Helping Our Own Challenge (Dale and Kilgar-
riff, 2010) is a shared task that was proposed to ad-
dress automated error correction of non-native En-
glish texts. In particular, the Helping Our Own 2012
Shared Task (HOO-2012) (Dale et al., 2012) focuses
on determiners and prepositions as they are well-
known sources for errors produced by non-native
English writers. For instance, Bitchener et al. (2005)
reported error rates of respectively 20% and 29%.

Determiners are in particular challenging because
they depend on a large discourse context and world
knowledge, and moreover, they simply do not exist

in many languages, such as Slavic and South-East
Asian languages (Ghomeshi et al., 2009). The use
of prepositions in English is idiomatic and thus very
difficult for learners of English. On the one hand,
prepositions connect noun phrases to other words in
a sentence (e.g. . . . by bus), on the other hand, they
can also be part of phrasal verbs such as carry on,
hold on, etc.

In this paper we describe our system implemen-
tation and results in HOO-2012. The paper is struc-
tured as follows. Section 2 gives the task definition,
errors addressed, data resources and evaluation cri-
teria and metrics. Section 3 shows some background
and related work. Section 4 gives the full system de-
scription, while Section 5 reports and discusses the
results of the experiments. Section 6 concludes with
an error analysis and possible further improvements.

2 HOO-2012 Tasks and Resources

2.1 Tasks

In the scope of HOO-2012 the following six possible
error types1 are targeted:

• Replace determiner (RD):
Have the nice day. → Have a nice day.

• Missing determiner (MD):
That is great idea. → That is a great idea.

• Unnecessary determiner (UD):
I like the pop music. → I like pop music.

1The set of error tags is based on the Cambridge University
Press Error Coding System, fully described in (Nicholls, 2003).

263



• Replace preposition (RT):
In the other hand. . . → On the other hand. . .

• Missing preposition (MT):
She woke up 6 o’clock. → She woke up at 6
o’clock.

• Unnecessary preposition (UT):
He must go to home. → He must go home.

2.2 Data
The HOO development dataset consists of 1000
exam scripts drawn from a subset of the CLC FCE
Dataset (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011). This corpus
contains texts written by students who attended the
Cambridge ESOL First Certificate in English exam-
ination in 2000 and 2001. The entire development
dataset comprises 374680 words, with an average
of 375 words per file. The test data consists of a
further 100 files provided by Cambridge University
Press (CUP), with 18013 words, and an average of
180 words per file.

dataset (‘Dev’) and two versions of the gold stan-
dard test data: the original version as derived from
the CUP-provided dataset (‘Test A’), and a revised
version (‘Test B’) which was compiled in response
to requests for corrections from participating teams.
The datasets and the revision process are further ex-
plained in (Dale et al., 2012).

2.3 Evaluation Criteria and Metrics

For evaluation in the HOO framework, a distinction
is made between scores and measures. The com-
plete evaluation mechanism is described in detail in
(Dale and Narroway, 2012) and on the HOO-2012
website.2

Scores Three different scores are used:

1. Detection: does the system determine that an
edit of the specified type is required at some
point in the text?

2. Recognition: does the system correctly deter-
mine the extent of the source text that requires
editing?

3. Correction: does the system offer a correction
that is identical to that provided in the gold
standard?

Measures For each score, three measures are cal-
culated: precision (1), recall (2) and F -score (3).

precision =
tp

tp+ fp
(1)

recall =
tp

tp+ fn
(2)

where tp is the number of true positives (the num-
ber of instances that are correctly found by the sys-
tem), fp the number of false positives (the number
of instances that are incorrectly found), and fn the
number of false negatives (missing results).

Fβ = (1 + β
2)

precision · recall
β2 · precision+ recall

(3)

where β is used as a weight factor regulating the
trade-off between recall and precision. We use the
balanced F -score, i.e. β = 1, such that recall and
precision are equally weighted.

Combined We provide results on prepositions and
determiners combined, and for each of these two
subcategories separately. We also report on each of
the different error types separately.

3 Related Work

HOO-2012 follows on from the HOO-2011 Shared
Task Pilot Round (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011). That
task targeted a broader range of error types, and used
a much smaller dataset.

Most work on models for determiner and preposi-
tion generation has been developed in the context of
machine translation output (e.g. (Knight and Chan-
der, 1994), (Minnen et al., 2000), (De Felice and
Pulman, 2007) and (Toutanova and Suzuki, 2007)).
Some of these methods depend on full parsing of
text, which is not reliable in the context of noisy
non-native English texts.

Only more recently, models for automated error
detection and correction of non-native texts have
been explicitly developed and studied. Most of these
methods use large corpora of well-formed native En-
glish text to train statistical models, e.g. (Han et al.,
2004), (Gamon et al., 2008) and (De Felice and Pul-
man, 2008). Yi et al. (2008) used web counts to de-
termine correct article usage, while Han et al. (2010)
trained a classifier solely on a large error-tagged
learner corpus for preposition error correction.

4 System Description

4.1 Global System Workflow
The system utilizes a hybrid approach that combines
statistical machine learning classifiers and a rule-
based system. The global system architecture is pre-
sented in Figure 1. This section describes the global
system workflow. The subsequent sections elabo-
rate on the machine learning classifiers and heuris-
tics implemented in the system.

The system workflow is divided in the following
processing steps:

1. Text Preprocessing: The system performs a
preliminary text analysis by automated spelling
correction and subsequent syntactic analysis,
such as tokenization and part-of-speech (POS)
tagging.

2. Error Detection, Recognition and Correction:
The system identifies if a correction is needed,
and the type and extent of that correction. Two
families of error correction tasks that separately
address determiners and prepositions are per-
formed in parallel.

3. Correction validation: Once a correction has
been proposed, it is validated by a language
model derived from a large corpus of high-
quality English text.

4.1.1 Text Preprocessing
In HOO-2012, texts submitted for automated cor-

rections are written by learners of English. Besides
the error types that are addressed in HOO-2012, mis-
spellings are another type of highly-frequent errors.
For example, one student writes the following: In my
point of vue, Internet is the most important discover
of the 2000 centery.

When using automated natural language process-
ing tools, incorrect spelling (and grammar) can in-
troduce an additional bias. To reduce the bias propa-
gated from the preprocessing steps, the text is first
automatically corrected by the open-source spell
checker GNU Aspell.3

At the next step, the text undergoes a shallow syn-
tactic analysis that includes sentence boundary de-
tection, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, chunk-
ing, lemmatization, relation finding and preposi-
tional phrase attachment. These tasks are performed
by MBSP (De Smedt et al., 2010).4

4.1.2 Error Detection, Recognition and
Correction

In general, the task of automated error correction
is addressed by a number of subtasks of finding the
position in text, recognizing the type of error, and
the proposal for a correction. In our implementation
we approach these tasks in a two-step approach as
proposed in (Gamon et al., 2008). With two families
of errors, the system therefore employs four classi-
fiers in total.

For determiner error corrections, a classifier (C1
in Figure 1) first predicts whether a determiner is
required in the observed context. If it is required,
another classifier (C2 in Figure 1) estimates which
one. The same approach is employed for the prepo-
sition error correction task (classifiers C3 and C4 in
Figure 1). The details on how the classifiers were
implemented are highlighted in Section 4.2.

and ILK (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005).

4.1.3 Correction Validation
Our error correction system implements a correc-

tion validation mechanism as proposed in (Gamon et
al., 2008). The validation mechanism makes use of
a language model that is derived from a large corpus
of English. We use a trigram language model trained
on the English Gigaword corpus with a 64K-word
vocabulary (using interpolated Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing with a bigram cutoff of 3 and trigram cutoff of
5).

The language model serves to increase the pre-
cision at the cost of recall as false positives can be
confusing for learners for English. The original sen-
tence and the error-corrected version are passed to
the language model. Only if the difference in proba-
bility of being generated by the language model ex-
ceeds a heuristic threshold (estimated using a tuning
set) is the correction finally accepted.

4.2 Machine Learning Classifiers

As already mentioned, the system employs four ma-
chine learning classifiers in total (C1–C4 — two for
each family of errors). Classifiers C1 and C3 re-
spectively estimate the presence of determiners and
prepositions in the observed context. If one is ex-
pected, the second set of classifiers estimates which
one is the most likely.

For the determiner choice classifier (C2), we re-
strict the determiner choice class values to the indef-
inite and definite articles: a/an and the. The prepo-
sition choice class values for the preposition choice
classifier (C4) are restricted to set of the following
10 common prepositions: on, in, at, for, of, about,
from, to, by, with and (other).

All the classifiers are implemented by discrimina-
tive maximum entropy classification models (ME)
(Ratnaparkhi, 1998). Such models have been proven
effective for a number of natural language process-
ing tasks by combining heterogeneous forms of evi-
dence (Ratnaparkhi, 2010).

Training Classifiers and Inference As training
instances we consider each noun phrase (NP) in ev-
ery sentence of the training data. For the binary clas-
sifiers (C1 and C3), a positive example is a noun
phrase that follows a determiner/preposition, and a
negative example is one that does not. The multi-
class classifiers (C2 and C4) are trained respectively
to distinguish specific instances of determiners (defi-
nite and indefinite for C2) and the set of prepositions
mentioned above. For each classifier, a training in-
stance is represented by the following features:

• Tokens in NP.

• Tokens’ POS tags in NP.

• Tokens’ lemmas in NP.

• Tokens in a contextual window of 3 tokens to
the left and to the right from the potential cor-
rection position.

• Tokens’ POS tags in a contextual window of 3
tokens from the potential correction position.

• Tokens’ lemmas in a contextual window of 3
tokens from the potential correction position.

• Trigrams of concatenated tokens before and af-
ter NP.

266



• Trigrams of concatenated tokens’ POS tags be-
fore and after NP.

• Trigrams of concatenated tokens’ lemmas be-
fore and after NP.

• Head noun in NP.

• POS tag of head noun in NP.

• Lemma of head noun in NP.

Once the classification models have been derived,
the classifiers are ready to be employed in the sys-
tem. For the text correction task, each sentence
undergoes the same preprocessing analysis as de-
scribed in Section 4.1.1. Then, for each noun phrase
in the input sentence, we extract the feature con-
text, and use the models to predict the need for
the presence of a determiner or preposition, and if
so, which one. Our system only accepts classifier
predictions if they are obtained with a high confi-
dence. The confidence thresholds were empirically
estimated from pre-evaluation experiments with a
tuning dataset (Section 5.1).

4.3 Rule-based Modules
Our system also has a number of rule-based mod-
ules. The first rule-based module is in charge of
making the choice between a and an if the deter-
miner type classifier (C2) predicts the presence of
an indefinite determiner. The choice is determined
by a lookup in the CMU pronouncing dictionary5

(a/an CMU Dictionary in Figure 1). In this dictio-
nary each word entry is mapped to one or a number
of pronunciations in the phonetic transcription code
system Arpabet. If the pronunciation of the word
that follows the estimated correction position starts
with a consonant, a is used; if it starts with a vowel,
an is selected.

The second rule-based module corrects confusion
errors of determiner-noun agreement, e.g. this/these
and that/those (Definite Determiner in Figure 1). It
is implemented by introducing rules with patterns
based on whether the noun was tagged as singular
or plural.

The third rule-based module is used to filter out
unnecessary corrections proposed by the classifiers

5http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/
cmudict

(C1-C4) and augmented by the already described
rule-based modules. Each correction is examined
against the input text and if it yields a different text
than the original input text, such a correction is con-
sidered as a necessary correction.

However, sometimes automatically proposed cor-
rections have to be rejected because they are out of
scope of the addressed errors. We do not replace
possessive determiners such as my, your, his, our,
their by the definite article the. Similarly, some
prepositions can be grouped in opposite pairs, for
example from and to, for which we do not propose
any correction as it requires a deep semantic analysis
of text.

5 Experiments and Results

In this section we describe the pre-evaluation exper-
iments and the results of the final evaluation on the
HOO-2012 test set. Table 2 shows the characteris-
tics of the datasets used in the experiments.

5.1 Pre-Evaluation Experiments

In the course of system development, we split the
files in the HOO development dataset into a train-
ing set (80%), a tuning set (10%) and a held-out test
set (10%). From the beginning it was clear that the
provided development dataset alone was too small to
address the automated error correction tasks by em-
ploying machine learning classification techniques.
Additionally to that dataset, we used a set of Reuters
news data and the Wikipedia corpus for training the
classifiers.

Once the classification models had been derived,
the system was evaluated on the tuning data and ad-
justed in order to increase the overall performance.

267



After that, the system was evaluated on the held-out
test set for which the results are shown in Table 3.

5.2 Final System Configuration and Evaluation
Results

For the final evaluation, we retrained the models us-
ing the complete HOO development data (again, in
addition to the Reuters and Wikipedia corpus men-
tioned above). The number of training instances are
shown in Table 4.

Table 4: Number of training instances used for the
ME models.

In the HOO framework, precision and recall are
weighted equally. However, in the domain of error
correction for non-native writers, precision is prob-
ably more important because false positives can be
very confusing and demotivating for learners of En-
glish. For this reason, we submitted two different
runs which also gave us insights into the impact of
the language model. ‘Run 0’ denotes the system ex-
cluding the language model and using lower thresh-
olds, such that neither precision nor recall is favored
in particular, while ‘Run 1’ focuses on precision
by using the language model as a filter, and having
higher thresholds. Thus, we present the results for
two different runs on the final HOO test set, both
before and after manual revision (see Section 2.2).
Table 5 presents the results for recognition and Ta-
ble 6 those for correction.

The difficulty of the HOO 2012 Shared Task is
reflected by rather low system performance levels

(Dale et al., 2012). Nonetheless, we observed some
interesting patterns. In terms of the overall system
performance, our system achieved better results for
determiner errors than for preposition errors.

With respect to determiners, missing determiners
are handled best by our system, while unnecessary
determiners and replacement errors are more diffi-
cult. Concerning prepositions, missing prepositions
are found to be the most challenging. This confirms
the difficulty of choosing the right preposition due to
the large number of possible alternatives, and their
sometimes subtle differences in usage and meaning.

While ‘Run 1’ achieved a higher precision (at the
cost of recall), ‘Run 0’ performed better in terms of
overall performance (F1-score). This result can be
explained by the relative small size and limited tun-
ing of the language model. Moreover, it also shows
that the use of the F1-score might not be the most
informative evaluation metric in this context.

6 Conclusions

Determiners and prepositions present real chal-
lenges for non-native English writers. For auto-
mated determiner and preposition error correction
in HOO-2012, we implemented a hybrid system
that combines statistical machine learning classifiers
and a rule-based system. By employing a language
model for correction validation, the system achieved
a precision of 42.16%, recall of 9.49% and F1-score
of 15.50%. Without the language model, a preci-
sion of 31.15%, recall of 22.08% and F1-score of
25.84% were reached, and our system was ranked
third in terms of F1-score.

Three major bottlenecks were identified in the im-
plementation: (i) spelling errors should first be cor-
rected due to the noisy input texts; (ii) classifier
thresholds must be carefully adjusted to minimize
false positives; and (iii) overall, preposition errors
are handled worse than determiner errors, although
there is also a large difference among the various er-
ror types.

For future work, we will focus on models that ex-
plicitly utilize the writer’s background. Also, a full
evaluation of the system should include a thorough
user-centric study with evaluation criteria and met-
rics beyond the traditional precision, recall and F -
score.
