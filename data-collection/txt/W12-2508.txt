Abstract

We present a method of authorship attribution
and stylometry that exploits hierarchical infor-
mation in phrase-structures. Contrary to much
previous work in stylometry, we focus on con-
tent words rather than function words. Texts
are parsed to obtain phrase-structures, and com-
pared with texts to be analyzed. An efficient
tree kernel method identifies common tree frag-
ments among data of known authors and un-
known texts. These fragments are then used to
identify authors and characterize their styles.
Our experiments show that the structural infor-
mation from fragments provides complemen-
tary information to the baseline trigram model.

1 Introduction

The task of authorship attribution (for an overview
cf. Stamatatos, 2009) is typically performed with su-
perficial features of texts such as sentence length,
word frequencies, and use of punctuation & vocabu-
lary. While such methods attain high accuracies (e.g.,
Grieve, 2007), the models make purely statistical de-
cisions that are difficult to interpret. To overcome
this we could turn to higher-level patterns of texts,
such as their syntactic structure.

Syntactic stylometry was first attempted by
Baayen et al. (1996), who looked at the distribution of
frequencies of grammar productions.1 More recently,
Raghavan et al. (2010) identified authors by deriving
a probabilistic grammar for each author and picking
the author grammar that can parse the unidentified

text with the highest probability. There is also work
that looks at syntax on a more shallow level, such
as Hirst and Feiguina (2007), who work with par-
tial parses; Wiersma et al. (2011) looked at n-grams
of part-of-speech (POS) tags, and Menon and Choi
(2011) focussed on particular word frequencies such
as those of ‘stop words,’ attaining accuracies well
above 90% even in cross-domain tasks.

In this work we also aim to perform syntactic sty-
lometry, but we analyze syntactic parse trees directly,
instead of summarizing the data as a set of grammar
productions or a probability measure. The unit of
comparison is tree fragments. Our hypothesis is that
the use of fragments can provide a more interpretable
model compared to one that uses fine-grained surface
features such as word tokens.

2 Method

We investigate a corpus consisting of a selection of
novels from a handful of authors. The corpus was
selected to contain works from different time periods

from authors with a putatively distinctive style. In
order to analyze the syntactic structure of the corpus
we use hierarchical phrase-structures, which divide
sentences into a series of constituents that are repre-
sented in a tree-structure; cf. figure 1 for an example.
We analyze phrase-structures using the notion of tree
fragments (referred to as subset trees by Collins and
Duffy, 2002). This notion is taken from the frame-
work of Data-Oriented Parsing (Scha, 1990), which
hypothesizes that language production and compre-
hension exploits an inventory of fragments from pre-
vious language experience that are used as building
blocks for novel sentences. In our case we can sur-
mise that literary authors might make use of a specific
inventory in writing their works, which characterizes
their style. Fragments can be characterized as fol-
lows:

Definition. A fragment f of a tree T is a connected
subset of nodes from T , with |f | ≥ 2, such that each
node of f has either all or none of the children of the
corresponding node in T .

When a node of a fragment has no children, it is
called a frontier node; in a parsing algorithm such
nodes function as substitution sites where the frag-
ment can be combined with other fragments. Cf. fig-
ure 2 for an example of a fragment. An important
consideration is that fragments can be of arbitrary
size. The notion of fragments captures anything from
a single context-free production such as

(1) S → NP VP

. . . to complete stock phrases such as

(2) Come with me if you want to live.

In other words, instead of making assumptions about
grain size, we let the data decide. This is in contrast
to n-gram models where n is an a priori defined
sliding window size, which must be kept low because

of data-sparsity considerations.
To obtain phrase-structures of the corpus we em-

ploy the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003),
which is a treebank parser trained on the Wall Street
journal (WSJ) section of the Penn treebank (Marcus
et al., 1993). This unlexicalized parser attains an ac-
curacy of 85.7 % on the WSJ benchmark (|w| ≤ 100).
Performance is probably much worse when parsing
text from a different domain, such as literature; for
example dialogue and questions are not well repre-
sented in the news domain on which the parser is
trained. Despite these issues we expect that useful
information can be extracted from the latent hierar-
chical structure that is revealed in parse trees, specif-
ically in how patterns in this structure recur across
different texts.

We pre-process all texts manually to strip away
dedications, epigraphs, prefaces, tables of contents,
and other such material. We also verified that no oc-
currences of the author names remained.2 Sentence
and word-level tokenization is done by the Stanford
parser. Finally, the parser assigns the most likely
parse tree for each sentence in the corpus. No fur-
ther training is performed; as our method is memory-
based, all computation is done during classification.

In the testing phase the author texts from the train-
ing sections are compared with the parse trees of texts
to be identified. To do this we modified the fragment
extraction algorithm of Sangati et al. (2010) to iden-
tify the common fragments among two different sets
of parse trees.3 This is a tree kernel method (Collins
and Duffy, 2002) which uses dynamic programming
to efficiently extract the maximal fragments that two
trees have in common. We use the variant reported by
Moschitti (2006) which runs in average linear time
in the number of nodes in the trees.

To identify the author of an unknown text we col-
lect the fragments which it has in common with each
known author. In order to avoid biases due to dif-
ferent sizes of each author corpus, we use the first
15,000 sentences from each training section. From
these results all fragments which were found in more
than one author corpus are removed. The remaining
fragments which are unique to each author are used
to compute a similarity score.

We have explored different variations of similarity
scores, such as the number of nodes, the average num-
ber of nodes, or the fragment frequencies. A simple
method which appears to work well is to count the
total number of content words.4 Given the parse trees
of a known author A and those of an unknown author
B, with their unique common fragments denoted as
A uB, the resulting similarity is defined as:

f(A, B) =
∑

x∈AuB
content words(x)

However, while the number of sentences in the train-
2Exception: War and Peace contains a character with the

same name as its author. However, since this occurs in only one
of the works, it cannot affect the results.

3The code used in the experiments is available at http://
github.com/andreasvc/authident.

4Content words consist of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and ad-
verbs. They are identified by the part-of-speech tags that are part
of the parse trees.

ing sets has been fixed, they still diverge in the aver-
age number of words per sentence, which is reflected
in the number of nodes per tree as well. This causes
a bias because statistically, there is a higher chance
that some fragment in a larger tree will match with
another. Therefore we also normalize for the average
number of nodes. The author can now be guessed as:

arg max
A∈Authors

f(A, B)

1/|A|
∑

t∈A |t|

Note that working with content words does not mean
that the model reduces to an n-gram model, because
fragments can be discontiguous; e.g., “he said X but
Y .” Furthermore the fragments contain hierarchical
structure while n-grams do not. To verify this con-
tention, we also evaluate our model with trigrams
instead of fragments. For this we use trigrams of
word & part-of-speech pairs, with words stemmed
using Porter’s algorithm. With trigrams we simply
count the number of trigrams that one text shares with
another. Raghavan et al. (2010) have observed that
the lexical information in n-grams and the structural
information from a PCFG perform a complementary
role, achieving the highest performance when both
are combined. We therefore also evaluate with a
combination of the two.

3 Evaluation & Discussion

Our data consist of a collection of novels from five
authors. See table 1 for a specification. We perform
cross-validation on 4 works per author. We evaluate
on two different test sizes: 20 and 100 sentences. We
test with a total of 500 sentences per work, which
gives 25 and 5 datapoints per work given these sizes.
As training sets only the works that are not tested on
are presented to the model. The training sets consist
of 15,000 sentences taken from the remaining works.
Evaluating the model on these test sets took about
half an hour on a machine with 16 cores, employing
less than 100 MB of memory per process. The simi-
larity functions were explored on a development set,
the results reported here are from a separate test set.

The authorship attribution results are in table 2. It
is interesting to note that even with three different
translators, the work of Tolstoy can be successfully
identified; i.e., the style of the author is modelled, not
the translator’s.

Table 3: Confusion matrix when looking at 20 sentences
with trigrams and fragments combined. The rows are the
true authors, the columns the predictions of the model.

Gamon (2004) also classifies chunks of 20 sen-
tences, but note that in his methodology data for
training and testing includes sentences from the same
work. Recognizing the same work is easier because
of recurring topics and character names.

Grieve (2007) uses opinion columns of 500–2,000
words, which amounts to 25–100 sentences, as-
suming an average sentence length of 20 words.
Most of the individual algorithms in Grieve (2007)
score much lower than our method, when classify-
ing among 5 possible authors like we do, while the
accuracies are similar when many algorithms are
combined into an ensemble. Although the corpus
of Grieve is carefully controlled to contain compa-
rable texts written for the same audience, our task
is not necessarily easier, because large differences
within the works of an author can make classifying
that author more challenging.

Table 3 shows a confusion matrix when working
with 20 sentences. It is striking that the errors are
relatively asymmetric: if A is often confused with
B, it does not imply that B is often confused with
A. This appears to indicate that the similarity metric
has a bias towards certain categories which could be

removed with a more principled model.

Here are some examples of sentence-level and pro-
ductive fragments that were found:

(3) Conrad: [PP [IN ] [NP [NP [DT ] [NN sort ] ]
[PP [IN of ] [NP [JJ ] [NN ] ] ] ] ]

(4) Hemingway: [VP [VB have ] [NP [DT a ] [NN
drink ] ] ]

(5) Salinger: [NP [DT a ] [NN ] [CC or ] [NN some-
thing ] ]

(6) Salinger: [ROOT [S [NP [PRP I ] ] [VP [VBP
mean ] [SBAR ] ] [. . ] ] ]

(7) Tolstoy: [ROOT [SINV [“ “ ] [S ] [, , ] [” ” ]
[VP [VBD said ] ] [NP ] [, , ] [S [VP [VBG
shrugging ] [NP [PRP$ his ] [NNS shoulders ]
] ] ] [. . ] ] ]

It is likely that more sophisticated statistics, for exam-
ple methods used for collocation detection, or general
machine learning methods to select features such as
support vector machines would allow to select only
the most characteristic fragments.

4 Conclusion

We have presented a method of syntactic stylome-
try that is conceptually simple—we do not resort
to sophisticated statistical inference or an ensemble
of algorithms—and takes sentence-level hierarchical
phenomena into account. Contrary to much previous
work in stylometry, we worked with content words
rather than just function words. We have demon-
strated the feasibility of analyzing literary syntax
through fragments; the next step will be to use these
techniques to address other literary questions.
