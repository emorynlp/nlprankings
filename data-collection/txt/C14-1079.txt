Abstract

A large number of online health communities exist today, helping millions of people with social
support during difficult phases of their lives when they suffer from serious diseases. Interactions
between members in these communities contain discussions on practical problems faced by peo-
ple during their illness such as depression, side-effects of medications, etc and answers to those
problems provided by other members. Analyzing these interactions can be helpful in getting
crucial information about the community such as dominant health issues, identifying sentimental
effects of interactions on individual members and identifying influential members. In this paper,
we analyze user messages of an online cancer support community, Cancer Survivors Network
(CSN), to identity the two types of social support present in them: emotional support and infor-
mational support. We model the task as a binary classification problem. We use several generic
and novel domain-specific features. Experimental results show that we achieve high classifica-
tion performance. We, then, use the classifier to predict the type of support in CSN messages
and analyze the posting behaviors of regular members and influential members in CSN in terms
of the type of support they provide in their messages. We find that influential members generally
provide more emotional support as compared to regular members in CSN.

1 Introduction
Increasingly more people turn to online health communities (OHCs) to seek social support during their
illnesses (LaCoursiere, 2001; Beaudoin and Tao, 2007). When people suffering from a serious disease
such as cancer or AIDS interact with other people who have experienced similar medical conditions,
they feel emotionally supported. In addition, through these interactions, people can obtain important
information about the disease, e.g., about various medications, symptoms, and side-effects. Although
authoritative health-related web sites contain the information they search for, obtaining this information
directly from people in OHCs adds substantial value to it. Previous studies showed that obtaining social
support in OHCs can help people feel better (Dunkel-Schetter, 1984; Maloney-Krichmar and Preece,
2005; Beaudoin and Tao, 2007; Vilhauer, 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).

As a result of online interactions in OHCs, a huge volume of user-generated content exists today
on various issues/problems related to specific diseases. This content comprises of important information
such as people’s experiences with diseases, recommendations and feedbacks about certain medications or
medical procedures, and emotional support in the form of encouragement, sympathy, and success stories.
Mining this content can prove to be very useful in obtaining crucial insights into community dynamics
such as identifying dominant health issues or the effects of social support on community members,
identifying influential members, as well as designing smart information retrieval systems for users.

In this study, we focus on an online cancer support community, the Cancer Survivors Network1 (CSN)
of the American Cancer Society. We analyze user messages of CSN to identify the two most important
types of social support present in them: informational and emotional support (Davison et al., 2000).
Emotional support comprises of seeking or providing caring/concern, understanding, empathy, sympathy,

encouragement, affirmation and validation. In contrast, informational support comprises of seeking or
providing knowledge such as advice, referrals, and suggestions (Bambina, 2007). We further explore the
relation between the type of support present in messages and users’ influence in the community.

Identifying the type of support in user messages in an OHC can potentially be used in many important
applications including the following:

1. Identify influential members in OHCs: Every community has a set of members who influence
(a much larger set of) other members in the community. These members are called leaders or
influential members. The attributes of a leader in a community depends upon the community’s
nature (QA, Twitter, OHC, forum, blogsite, etc.). For example, high activity may not be an indicator
of high influence in the blogosphere (Agarwal et al., 2008) and high popularity does not necessarily
imply influence in Twitter (Romero et al., 2011). In OHCs, bringing positivity in the community and
answering members’ concerns effectively by posting messages that contain certain type of support
(informational or emotional) may be an indicator of influence.

2. Improve information search in OHCs: Interactions in OHCs contain valuable information in the
form of people’s experiences, advice, referrals, pertaining to diseases, medications, side-effects,
etc. Users embed this information often in messages containing other types of support, of which
emotional support constitutes a major part. To efficiently search OHCs for this information, it must
be separated from emotional support. Hence, identifying the type of support in user messages can
help improve search and retrieval in OHCs.

3. Understand social relationships in OHCs: Emotional support is one of the dimensions of social
tie strength between members in a social network (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009). Previous stud-
ies have shown that members receiving emotional support in OHCs are more likely to remain in
the community for a longer period of time as compared to members receiving informational sup-
port (Wang et al., 2012). Identifying emotional and informational support can help understand the
social dynamics of an OHC. For example, it would be interesting to see if there is a correlation
between the social tie strength of members and the type of support present in their interactions.

Hi X, I had a bilateral with radical on the right and prophylactic on the left. I think all you can do is
gentle exercises to strengthen your back (yoga). There are also herbal painkillers that work well too.
I just tolerate the pain and consider it a signal of my new limit and go down to rest. You want to talk,
anytime! We are all there with you.

Table 1: A user message. Sentences in grey and black fonts are informational and emotional, respectively.
We model the task of identifying the two types of supports as a binary classification problem. Specifi-
cally, we classify each sentence in a user message as containing either emotional or informational sup-
port 2. Table 1 shows a user message containing emotional and informational supports. We use several
features computed from sentences of messages such as unigrams, part-of-speech tags, lexicon-based fea-
tures and word patterns for the classification. After building the classification model, we predict the
amounts of the two supports in all CSN messages and explore the following research question:

RQ: Do influential members of CSN post one of the two types of supports significantly more
compared to regular members?
We analyze messages posted by regular members and messages posted by certain members, identified
as influential by the CSN community managers and two staff members who monitor the contents of the
CSN on a full time basis, for the type of support (informational and emotional) present in them. Using
the classification model, we calculate the amounts of the two supports posted by influential members and
regular members and compare them across the two populations (For details, see Section 3.1).

Previous works on analyzing social support in OHCs have mainly been in the field of social sci-
ence (Eriksson and Lauri, 2000; Rodgers and Chen, 2005; Høybye et al., 2005; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007;
Beaudoin and Tao, 2007; Buis, 2008; Han et al., 2011). These works used manual techniques for iden-
tifying the type of support in user messages and hence, are limited to a small number of messages as

2Although a sentence may belong to both the classes, we did not find such cases in our data.

compared to the real world data. In contrast, the current work builds machine learning classifiers that
can automatically predict the type of support in messages. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there have
been no reported works on analyzing the relationship between users’ influence and the type of support
present in their messages in OHCs. Next, we review related works.

2 Related Work
Many studies in social science have focused on analyzing social support in user messages of OHCs (Cour-
saris and Liu, 2009; Han et al., 2011; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007), finding impacts of social support on
users (Eriksson and Lauri, 2000; Rodgers and Chen, 2005; Buis, 2008; Høybye et al., 2005), identifying
information needs of users in OHCs (Rozmovits and Ziebland, 2004), etc. Among various types of social
supports, emotional support and informational support have received major attention. In this section, we
first review social science works on analyzing online social support, discuss works on identifying the
type of social support, and, finally, compare the current problem with subjectivity analysis.

LaCoursiere (2001) presented an integrated theory conceptualizing online social support. She defined
three channels through which online social support occurs: 1) perceptual: individual feeling the need of
social support arising due to emotional states such as stress, etc, 2) cognitive: individual seeking infor-
mation about certain medical entities such as procedures, medication, etc, 3) transactional: individual
evaluating the received social support. In our case, these channels correspond to emotional support and
informational support. Høybye et al. (2005) conducted a qualitative study to analyze the effects of online
social support by interviewing women with breast cancer who used an online support group and found
that the women were empowered by the exchanges of knowledge and experience within the online sup-
port group. Rodgers et al. (2005) conducted a longitudinal content analysis of messages of participants
in a breast cancer discussion board to analyze changes in affect/sentiment of the participants towards
breast cancer and found that a positive shift in sentiment occurred over the period of time. Pfeil and
Zaphiris (2007) analyzed messages of SeniorNet forum to extract language patterns used to provide em-
pathic support. Budak and Agrawal (2013) interviewed participants of group chats in Twitter and found
that informational support is more important than emotional support in educational Twitter chats.

All the above works used manual methods of data preparation such as interviews with users of sup-
port groups, manual coding of messages to identify emotional and informational support and performed
further qualitative and/or quantitative analyses based on that data. Since, manual methods have seri-
ous limitations in terms of scalability, the number of messages used for analysis in these studies is too
small compared to the real world data which contains millions of messages. To address these limitations,
we develop automatic methods for identifying the type of support in user messages in an online cancer
support group using machine learning. We develop a classifier that learns on a smaller set of manually
labeled messages and makes predictions on a much larger set of messages with a very high accuracy.

A recent work by Wang et al. (2012) is close to our work. They used a linear regression model to
predict the amount of informational and emotional supports present in messages of a cancer forum. For
a test message, the trained model predicts the amount of the two supports on a scale of 1 − 7. Since a
message may contain both types of support, it is generally difficult for human annotators to assess the
amount of each support in an entire message on a particular scale for model training. In contrast, we label
each sentence as belonging to either informational or emotional support class and identify the two types
of support at sentence level in messages (using binary classification). Note that it is much easier and less
ambiguous for a human annotator to identify the type of support present in a sentence (of a message)
compared to giving a score to an entire message based on the amount of the two supports present in it.

Relationship with Subjectivity Analysis: Subjectivity analysis is an active area of research in com-
putational linguistics. It essentially deals with separating subjective parts (e.g., expressing opinion, emo-
tion, speculation and other private states of mind) from objective parts (presenting facts, verifiable infor-
mation) of a text (Wiebe et al., 1999; Biyani et al., 2012a). It has been widely used in applications like
opinion mining from product reviews (Liu, 2010), community question-answering (Li et al., 2008a; Stoy-
anov et al., 2005a; Somasundaran et al., 2007), summarization (Carenini et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2005),
and finding opinionative threads in online forums (Biyani et al., 2014; Biyani et al., 2012b; Biyani et al.,
2013a). Though the current work has some relation with subjectivity analysis in the sense that both are

829



text classification, there are important differences between the two problems. The two classes in sub-
jectivity analysis (subjective and objective) are different from the two types of support that we identify.
While emotional support is subjective in nature, informational support is not necessarily objective as it
also contains opinions of users. Also, social support in OHCs encompasses several types of supports
such as understanding, caring, concern, sympathy, empathy, knowledge about medications, etc. which
are generally not provided by users in other sites such as product reviews, question-answering sites, etc.
These differences make the two problems different in both the nature and the approaches that can be used
to address them. For example, we use certain word patterns to identify sympathy and affirmation and use
the presence of terms related to cancer medications, procedures and side-effects for computing features
for classification. These features have not been used in subjectivity classification.

3 Problem Formulation
Online health communities provide social support to its members of which emotional and informational
supports constitute a major part and have received major attention as compared to other supports such
as companionship, community building, network support, etc. (Bambina, 2007; Meier et al., 2007;
Himle et al., 1991; Wang et al., 2012; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007). We focus on the two supports and
follow their definitions as given by Bambina (2007) in their study of social supports expressed in a can-
cer support group. They define emotional messages as the messages that have the following supports:
caring/concern, understanding, empathy, sympathy, encouragement, affirmation and validation. Infor-
mational support is defined as providing advice, knowledge and referrals. Since a user message often
contains a mixture of these supports, we identify the two supports at sentence level. Table 1 contains a
user message with sentences marked with the type of support in them. Specifically, given a sentence s,
in a user message, we want to classify it into one of the two classes: emotional support or informational
support. We use machine learning methods for classification. After training the classifier, we use it to
predict the type of support in the sentences of user messages in CSN and address our research question
outlined in Section 1. We present the details of the features used for classification in Section 3.2.

3.1 Research Question
To address the research question (RQ), we need to compute the amounts of the two supports in the
messages of regular and influential members and then compare the two amounts. Let u denote a user and
M be the set of messages posted by her such that M = {m1,m2, ....mp} where p is the total number
of messages in the set M . For a message mk ∈ M , we compute its emotional index, euk = nek/(nk)
where nek and nk are the number of sentences containing emotional support and the total number of
sentences in mk. Since a sentence can belong to either emotional support or informational support class,
informational index of mk, iuk = 1 − euk. The overall emotional index of u (eu) is the average of the
emotional indices of her messages: eu = 1p

∑p
k=1 euk. The informational index of u, iu = 1 − eu.

Since, the informational index can be derived from emotional index, we compute only emotional indices
for all regular and influential members and compare them between the two user populations (regular
and influential). We compute the emotional indices of regular members, ER, and emotional indices of
influential members, EI . We compare the means of the two populations of emotional indices (µRe and
µIe) and test the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternate hypothesis (H1) as follows:
H0: The two populations have equal means, i.e., µRe − µIe = 0.
H1: The two populations have significantly different means , i.e., µRe − µIe 6= 0.

For one of the population indices to be significantly more than the other, we should have the null
hypothesis rejected. We use one-sided t-test to conduct hypothesis testing and report the results in Sec-
tion 4.5. Next, we discuss the features used in the classification.

3.2 Features for Classification

3.2.1 Words and POS tags
Words and their part-of-speech tags capture basic lexical properties of text and have been extensively
used in text classification problems such as subjectivity classification and sentiment classification (Li et
al., 2008b; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Biyani et al., 2013b). We use frequency of words and their
POS tags in a sentence as features in our classification model.

830



3.2.2 Lexicon-based Features
Emotional support expresses caring, concern, sympathy, and other kinds of sentimental support whereas
informational support provides knowledge about cancer medications, cancer reports, referrals, and other
kinds of information (Bambina, 2007). Due to this difference in the nature of these supports, a sentence
expressing emotional support is likely to contain emotional words which are subjective in nature and a
sentence containing informational support is likely to have cancer-related keywords such as drug names,
names of cancer procedures, etc. To capture this difference, we use frequencies of subjective words and
cancer-related keywords as features. Specifically, we design five features to code frequencies of weak
subjective words (numWeak), strong subjective words (numStrong), cancer drugs (numDrug), side-
effects of cancer medications (numSide), and cancer procedures (numProc) respectively in a sentence.
We use the subjectivity lexicon compiled from the MPQA corpus (Stoyanov et al., 2005b) to get weak
and strong subjective words. We compile lexicon of cancer drugs 3, and CSN staff members helped get
a list of side-effects and cancer procedures. Some of the side-effects of cancer medications are hair loss,
neuropathy, fatigue, fibrosis, etc.
3.2.3 Linguistic Features
We analyzed user messages to find patterns that are expressive of emotional and informational support.
We found that members, generally, use certain word patterns to express similar feelings. For example,
to provide affirmation and sympathy, people use positive verbs such as know, feel, understand, sense,
support, etc. in patterns <I $posVerb> and <I $aux $posVerb>, where $posVerb is a positive verb and
$aux is an auxiliary verb from the set {can, could, do, would, will, may}. Some people use “We” instead
of “I” in their messages to provide support such as “we understand what you are going through”.
To take into account such cases, we use the same patterns by replacing “I ” with “We”. Hence, we
get four patterns for emotional support. For providing informational support, people often use patterns
such as <You $advice>, <I $opinion>, <I $aux $opinion> to provide advice and opinions. $advice
is an auxilliary verb from the set {should, must, need, might}, $opinion is an opinion verb from the
set {recommend, advise, suggest, advocate, request}, and $aux is an auxilliary verb. People also give
information about their experiences using patterns such as <I too>, <I also> and <I $pastVerb> to
tell their own experiences related to similar problems as that of the support seeker where $pastVerb is a
past tense verb such as underwent, undergone, experienced, had, found, etc. So, we get six patterns for
informational support. We design two features (IsEmPattern and IsInPattern) to encode presence (1)
or absence (0) of the two types of patterns.

For a sentence, we also use its number of words (numWords) and its type, question sentence (IsQues)
and/or exclamatory sentence (isExclaim), as features. To identify question sentences, we see if a sen-
tence starts with any of the 5W1H words (what, why, who, when, where, how) or words in the set {do,
does, did} or ends with a question mark.
4 Experiments
We now describe our data and the experimental setting, and present our results.
4.1 Data Preparation

We use data from a popular online cancer support community, the Cancer Survivors’ Network (CSN),
developed and maintained by the American Cancer Society. CSN is an online community for cancer
patients, cancer survivors, their families and friends. Its features are similar to many online forums
with dynamic interactive medium such as chat rooms, discussion boards, etc. Members of CSN post
in discussion boards for seeking and sharing information about cancer related issues and for seeking
and providing emotional support. To conduct our experiments, we used user messages in the discussion
threads of the Breast Cancer sub forum of CSN that were posted between June 2000 to June 2012. Breast
cancer is the largest among all the sub-forums of CSN. A dataset of 250, 868 messages posted by 5516
users in 22, 297 discussion threads is used in this study.

To prepare the evaluation dataset for classification experiments, we randomly sampled 240 messages
from 27 discussion threads. Since, our focus is on the messages that provide support, we do not consider

3http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/alphalist

831



messages posted by thread starters in discussion threads as they seek support. We took help of three
human annotators to tag all the sentences of all the messages in one of the two support classes. First,
two annotators tagged all the sentences. The percentage agreement between them was 89%. For the
remaining 11% sentences, majority vote was taken with the help of the third annotator. Following this
tagging scheme, we obtained a total of 1066 sentences with 390 sentences in the informational support
class and 676 sentences in the emotional support class. In many cases, members only write a few words,
e.g., see you, bye, or their names at the end of a message. To deal with these situations, we filter out
sentences that have less than four words.

4.2 Experimental Protocol
We experimented with various machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines,
Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting, etc.) to conduct our classification experiments. Naive Bayes
Multinomial gave the best performance with words & POS tags features, logistic regression with lexicon-
based features and AdaBoost (with Decision Stump as the weak learner) with linguistic features. For
combining the models built on the three types of features, we used the following three methods:

1. Feature combination: Classification model built on the feature set generated by combining the
three types of features. It is denoted by All. We use Multinomial Naive Bayes for this model.

2. Average confidence: Ensemble of the three classifiers built on the three types of features respec-
tively. The final confidence of the ensemble is calculated by taking average of the confidences
outputted by the three classifiers. It is denoted by AllAvgConf.

3. Highest confidence: Similar to the AllAvgConf model but the final prediction of the ensemble is
taken as the prediction of the most confident classifier of the three classifiers. More precisely, the
prediction for an instance is given by the classifier that returns the maximum prediction confidence
for one class or the other. It is denoted by AllMostConf.

Table 2: Classification results.

We used Weka data mining toolkit (Hall et al.,
2009) to conduct classification experiments. To
evaluate the performance of our classifiers, we
used macro-averaged precision, recall and F-1
score. We use F-1 score to compare perfor-
mances of two classifiers and used 10-fold cross
validation. A naive baseline that classifies all
the instances in the majority class will have a
macro-averaged precision, recall and F-1 score
of 0.402, 0.634 and 0.492, respectively.

4.3 Classification Results
Table 2 presents the results of the support clas-
sification experiments. The table reports preci-
sion, recall and F-1 score of different classifi-
cation models for the individual classes and the
overall result. Words & POS tags are the best
performing features followed by lexicon-based
features and linguistic features. Further, com-
bining all the features (model denoted as “All”)
improves the performance over individual fea-
ture types for both classes. We see that All-
MostConf model is the best performing of all
the models, particularly outperforming All and
AllAvgConf models. This observation suggests that the three classifiers built on the three features types
have different knowledge. For some instances, a particular classifier is more confident than the rest while
for other instances, other classifiers are more confident. Hence, we see that taking prediction of the most

832



confident classifier gives the best performance. It is interesting to note that combining the three classi-
fiers’ knowledge in this fashion is more effective than simply combining all the three types of features
and train a single classifier on the combined feature set. We also note that all the models have better
performance for the emotional support class than for the informational support class. This can be caused
by the fact that there are significantly more number of instances in the former class and, hence, more
patterns to learn for the class.

4.4 Informative Features

Next, we study the importance of individual features by measuring their chi-squared statistic with respect
to the class variable. We, first, study the word features and then present rankings of the other types of
features. Figure 1 shows a cloud of top 26 most informative words. The size of a word is proportional to
its chi-squared statistic, i.e., bigger a word, more informative it is. We see that cancer specific keywords
such as herceptin, tamoxifen, chemo, dose, stage, etc and words conveying emotions such as good, hope,
glad, pain, hugs, etc are highly informative for the support classification. Since, chi-square method
gives feature ranking for the class variable and not for individual classes, we compute word rankings for
individual classes using tf − idf scores of words. Specifically, for a term t and a class c, we compute
the term frequency of t by counting its number of occurrences in the instances (sentences) belonging
to c and multiply the term frequency with the inverse document frequency of t (calculated from the
entire corpus) to get the tf − idf score of t for c. Using this method, we calculated tf − idf scores
for all the words and ranked them according to their scores for the two classes. Figure 2 shows top ten
tf− idf ranked keywords for the two classes. We see that cancer-related keywords and words expressing
emotions are among the top ten most informative words for the informational and the emotional support
classes respectively. We also note that most of the top ten words for the two classes in Figure 2 are in
the word cloud of the top 26 words computed using chi-squared method except “keep” for the emotional
support class and “after”, “first”, “because” and “cancer” for the informational class. These words have
semantic relationships with the classes. For example, “keep” is often used by support providers in phrases
such as “keep you in prayers”, “may god keep you in good health”, etc to provide emotional support and
“after” and “first” are used in the context of providing one’s own experience related to cancer procedures,
medications, etc such as “After my first chemo, I did not feel light”.

test.

Figure 2: Top ten words for the two classes
ranked using tf-idf scheme.

We, now, discuss the ranking of non-word features: POS tags, lexicon-based and linguistic features.
The chi-squared ranking for the lexicon-based and linguistic features is as follows: numStrong > num-
Words > isExclaim > numDrug > numSide > numProc > isInPattern > isEmPattern > numWeak >
isQues. The features on the right side of > have higher rank than those on the left side. We see that the
number of strong subjective words in a sentence is the most informative feature followed by number of
words in a sentence. Among cancer-related terms, drug names are more informative than side-effects
and cancer procedures. Also, informational support word patterns are more informative than word pat-
terns capturing emotional support. It is interesting to note that isQues is the least informative feature,
maybe due to the fact that, while providing support, people generally do not ask questions. The top 5

833



most informative POS tags are: cardinal number (CD) followed by singular noun (NN), participle verb
(VBN), past tense verb (VBD) and preposition (IN).

4.5 Influence versus Support type

Figure 3: Plot showing the change in mean emo-
tional indices of influential members (pink) and reg-
ular members (blue) with the threshold on the num-
ber of messages posted by them.

CSN managers provided a list of 62 influential
members (IMs) for the breast cancer forum. IMs
posted a total of 340, 147 sentences in 85, 244
messages and regular members posted 825, 651
sentences in 165, 624 messages in the breast
cancer forum. As described in Section 3, we
conduct statistical hypothesis testing on the two
populations of emotional indices (regular mem-
bers and IMs) to understand if there is a sig-
nificant difference in their posting behaviors in
terms of providing one of the two supports more
often than the other. To test our hypothesis, we
conducted one sided t-test on the two popula-
tions. We found that the mean of emotional in-
dices of IMs (0.713) is significantly larger than
that of the regular members (0.542). We also
note that the posting behavior of regular mem-
bers in CSN follows a power law distribution with most of the members posting very few messages
(mode = 1, median = 2, mean = 30) and only a few members posting very many messages. To verify
that this behavior does not have impacts on our hypothesis testing, we conducted three more t-tests be-
tween the two populations using a threshold on the number of messages that a member has posted. We
used three threshold values on the number of messages: 1, 2, and 30 (as mode, median and mean values).
For all the three t-tests, the null hypothesis was rejected at p-value< 0.001, suggesting that IMs posted
significantly more emotional support than regular members. The values of Mean Emotional Indices cor-
responding to the three thresholds are 0.715, 0.719 and 0.746 for influential members and 0.564, 0.581
and 0.646 for regular members respectively.

In our analysis, we observed an interesting behavior. As we increased the threshold, the mean of
emotional indices also increased. To further investigate this finding, we plotted the means of emotional
indices of regular members and IMs as the function of the threshold on the number of messages posted
by them. We increased the threshold from 10 to 1000 in steps of 10. Figure 3 reports the finding. We see
that the mean of emotional indices of regular members increase with the threshold suggesting that more
active members post more emotional support as compared to the less active members. We also see that
the mean of emotional indices of IMs is higher than that of regular members for all the thresholds. These
interesting observations can be helpful in analyzing behavior of influential members in OHCs.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We identified two types of social support, emotional and informational, provided in user messages of an
online cancer support community using machine learning classification models. We used three types of
features and got the best results by using ensemble of the three classifiers built on the three individual
feature types. Our models achieved strong results with over 80% F-1 score. We also found that influ-
ential members provide significantly more emotional support to the community as compared to regular
members. The finding can be helpful in identifying properties of influential members in online health
communities. In future, we plan to analyze effects of the two types of supports on OHCs’ dynamics and
use it to improve information search in OHCs.
