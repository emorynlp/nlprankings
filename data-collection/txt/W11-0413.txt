Abstract

Subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) is
an area that has been witnessing a flurry
of novel research. However, only few at-
tempts have been made to build SSA systems
for morphologically-rich languages (MRL). In
the current study, we report efforts to par-
tially bridge this gap. We present a newly
labeled corpus of Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) from the news domain manually an-
notated for subjectivity and domain at the sen-
tence level. We summarize our linguistically-
motivated annotation guidelines and provide
examples from our corpus exemplifying the
different phenomena. Throughout the paper,
we discuss expression of subjectivity in nat-
ural language, combining various previously
scattered insights belonging to many branches
of linguistics.

1 Introduction

As the volume of web data continues to phenome-
nally increase, researchers are becoming more inter-
ested in mining that data and making the informa-
tion therein accessible to end-users in various inno-
vative ways. As a result, searches and processing
of data beyond the limiting level of surface words
are becoming increasingly important (Diab et al.,
2009). The sentiment expressed in Web data specif-
ically continues to be of high interest and value to
internet users, businesses, and governmental bodies.
Thus, the area of Subjectivity and sentiment analysis
(SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel research.
Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of
language used to express opinions, feelings, eval-
uations, and speculations (Banfield, 1982; Wiebe,

1994) and it, thus, incorporates sentiment. The pro-
cess of subjectivity classification refers to the task
of classifying texts into either Objective (e.g., More
than 1000 tourists have visited Tahrir Square, in
downtown Cairo, last week.) or Subjective. Sub-
jective text is further classified with sentiment or po-
larity. For sentiment classification, the task refers
to identifying whether a subjective text is positive
(e.g., The Egyptian revolution was really impres-
sive!), negative (e.g., The bloodbaths that took place
in Tripoli were horrifying!), neutral (e.g., The com-
pany may release the software next month.), and,
sometimes, mixed (e.g., I really like this labtop, but
it is prohibitively expensive.). SSA sometimes in-
corporates identifying the holder(s), target(s), and
strength (e.g., low, medium, high) of the expressed
sentiment.

In spite of the great interest in SSA, only few
studies have been conducted on morphologically-
rich languages (MRL) (i.e., languages in which sig-
nificant information concerning syntactic units and
relations are expressed at the word-level (Tsarfaty
et al., 2010)). Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Czech, and
Basque are examples of MRLs. SSA work on MRLs
has been hampered by lack of annotated data. In the
current paper we report efforts to manually anno-
tate a corpus of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a
morphologically-rich variety of Arabic, e.g., (Diab
et al., 2007; Habash et al., 2009). The corpus is a
collection of documents from the newswire genre
covering several domains such as politics and sports.
We label the data at the sentence level. Our annota-
tion guidelines explicitly incorporate linguistically-
motivated information.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, we motivate work on the news genre.
In Section 3, we summarize our linguistically-
motivated annotation guidelines. In Section 4, we
introduce the domain annotation task. In Section 5
we provide examples from our dataset. We present
related work in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7.

2 Subjectivity and Sentiment in the News

Most work on SSA has been conducted on data be-
longing to highly subjective, user-generated genres
such as blogs and product or movie reviews where
authors express their opinions quite freely (Balahur
and Steinberger, 2009). In spite of the important
role news play in our lives (e.g., as an influencer
of the social construction of reality (Fowler, 1991),
(Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999), (Wodak and
Meyer, 2009)), the news genre has received much
less attention within the SSA community. This role
of news and the connection between news-making
and social contexts and practices motivates the task
of building SSA system. In addition, the many novel
ways online news-making is becoming an interactive
process (Abdul-Mageed, 2008) further motivates
investigating the newswire genre. News-makers re-
produce some of the views of their readers (e.g., by
quoting them) and they devote full stories about the
interactions of web users on social media outlets1.
Although subjectivity in news articles has tradition-
ally tended to be implicit, the fact that news sto-
ries have their own biases (e.g., hiding agents be-
hind negative or positive events via use of passive
voice, variation in lexical choice) has been pointed
out by e.g., (Van Dijk, 1988). The growing trend to
foster interactivity and more heavily report commu-
nication of internet users within the body of news
articles is likely to make expression of subjectivity
in news articles more explicit.

3 Subjectivity and Sentiment Annotation

bic annotated 2855 sentences from Part 1 V 3.0 of

zations like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya with the hightened at-
tention to social media as a result of ongoing revolutions and
protests in the Arab world

Total 1423 462 682 288 2855

Table 1: Agreement for SSA sentences

the Penn Arabic TreeBank (PATB) (Maamouri et al.,
2004). The sentences make up the first 400 docu-
ments of that part of PATB amounting to a total of
54.5% of the PATB Part 1 data set. The task was
to annotate MSA news articles at the sentence level.
Each article has been processed such that coders are
provided sentences to label. We prepared annotation
guidelines for this SSA task focusing specifically on
the newswire genre. We summarize the guidelines
next, illustrating related and relevant literature.

3.1 SSA Categories

For each sentence, each annotator assigned one of 4
possible labels: (1) Objective (OBJ), (2) Subjective-
Positive (S-POS), (3) Subjective-Negative (S-NEG),
and (4) Subjective-Neutral (S-NEUT). We followed
(Wiebe et al., 1999) in operationalizing the subjec-
tive vs. the objective categories. In other words,
if the primary goal of a sentence is perceived to be
the objective reporting of information, it was labeled
OBJ. Otherwise, a sentence would be a candidate for
one of the three subjective classes.2 Table 1 shows
the contingency table for the two annotators judg-
ments. Overall agreement is 88.06%, with a Kappa
(k) value of 0.38.

To illustrate, a sentence such as “The Prime Min-
ister announced that he will visit the city, saying
that he will be glad to see the injured”, has two au-
thors (the story writer and the Prime Minister indi-
rectly quoted). Accordingly to our guidelines, this
sentence should be annotated S-POS tag since the
part related to the person quoted (the Prime Minis-

2It is worth noting that even though some SSA researchers
include subjective mixed categories, we only saw such cate-
gories attested in less than < 0.005% which is expected since
our granularity level is the sentence. If we are to consider larger
units of annotation, we believe mixed categories will become
more frequent. Thus we decided to tag the very few subjective
mixed sentences as S-NEUT.

111



ter) expresses a positive subjective sentiment, ”glad”
which is a private state (i.e., a state that is not sub-
ject to direct verification) (Quirk et al., 1974).

3.2 Good & Bad News

News can be good or bad. For example, whereas
”Five persons were killed in a car accident” is bad
news, ”It is sunny and warm today in Chicago” is
good news. Our coders were instructed not to con-
sider good news positive nor bad news negative if
they think the sentences expressing them are objec-
tively reporting information. Thus, bad news and
good news can be OBJ as is the case in both exam-
ples.

3.3 Perspective

Some sentences are written from a certain perspec-
tive (Lin et al., 2006) or point of view. Consider
the two sentences (1) ”Israeli soldiers, our heroes,
are keen on protecting settlers” and (2) ”Palestinian
freedom fighters are willing to attack these Israeli
targets”. Sentence (1) is written from an Israeli per-
spective, while sentence (2) is written from a Pales-
tinian perspective. The perspective from which a
sentence is written interplays with how sentiment is
assigned. Sentence (1) is considered positive from
an Israeli perspective, yet the act of protecting set-
tlers is considered negative from a Palestinian per-
spective. Similarly, attacking Israeli targets may be
positive from a Palestinian vantage point, but will be
negative from an Israeli perspective. Coders were
instructed to assign a tag based on their understand-
ing of the type of sentiment, if any, the author of a
sentence is trying to communicate. Thus, we have
tagged the sentences from the perspective of their
authors. As it is easy for a human to identify the
perspective of an author (Lin et al., 2006), this mea-
sure facilitated the annotation task. Thus, knowing
that the sentence (1) is written from an Israeli per-
spective the annotator assigns it a S-POS tag.

3.4 Epistemic Modality

Epistemic modality serves to reveal how confident
writers are about the truth of the ideational mate-
rial they convey (Palmer, 1986). Epistemic modal-
ity is classified into hedges and boosters. Hedges
are devices like perhaps and I guess that speakers

employ to reduce the degree of liability or respon-
sibility they might face in expressing the ideational
material. Boosters3 are elements like definitely, I as-
sure that, and of course that writers or speakers use
to emphasize what they really believe. Both hedges
and boosters can (1) turn a given unit of analsysis
from objective into subjective and (2) modify polar-
ity (i.e., either strengthen or weaken it). Consider,
for example, the sentences (1) ”Gaddafi has mur-
dered hundreds of people”, (2) ”Gaddafi may have
murdered hundreds of people”, and (3) ”Unfortu-
nately, Gaddafi has definitely murdered hundreds of
people”. While (1) is OBJ, since it lacks any subjec-
tivity cues), (2) is S-NEUT because the proposition
is not presented as a fact but rather is softened and
hence offered as subject to counter-argument, (3) is
a strong S-NEG (i.e., it is S-NEG as a result of the
use of ”unfortnately”, and strong due to the use of
the booster definitely). Our annotators were explic-
itly alerted to the ways epistemic modality markers
interact with subjectivity.

3.5 Illocutionary Speech Acts

Occurrences of language expressing (e.g. apologies,
congratulations, praise, etc. are referred to as il-
locutionary speech acts (ISA) (Searle, 1975). We
believe that ISAs are relevant to the expression of
sentiment in natural language. For example, the two
categories expressives (e.g., congratulating, thank-
ing, apologizing and commisives (e.g., promising)
of (Searle, 1975)’s taxonomy of ISAs are specially
relevant to SSA. In addition, (Bach and Harnish,
1979) define an ISA as a medium of communicat-
ing attitude and discuss ISAs like banning, bidding,
indicting, penalizing, assessing and convicting. For
example, the sentence ”The army should never do
that again” is a banning act and hence is S-NEG.
Although our coders were not required to assign ISA
tags to the sentences, we have brought the the con-
cept of ISAs to their attention as we believe a good
understanding of the concept facilitates annotating
data for SSA.

3.6 Annotator’s Background Knowledge

The type of sentiment expressed may vary based
on the type of background knowledge of an annota-

3 (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) call these intensifiers.

Table 2: Domains

tor/reader (Balahur and Steinberger, 2009). For ex-
ample, the sentence ”Secularists will be defeated”,
may be positive to a reader who opposes secularism.
However, if the primary intention of the author is
judged to be communicating negative sentiment, an-
notators are supposed to assign a S-NEG tag. In gen-
eral, annotators have been advised to avoid interpret-
ing the subjectivity of text based on their own eco-
nomic, social, religious, cultural, etc. background
knowledge.

4 Domain Annotation

The same two annotators also manually assigned
each sentence a domain label. The domain labels are
from the news genre and are adopted from (Abdul-
Mageed, 2008). The set of domain labels is as fol-
lows: {Light news, Military and political violence,
Sport, Politics, Crime, Economy, Disaster, Arts and
culture, This day in history}. Table 2 illustrates the
number of sentences deemed for each domain. Do-
main annotation is an easier task than subjectivity
annotation. Inter-annotator agreement for domain
label assignment is at 97%. The two coders dis-
cussed differences and a total agreement was even-
tually reached. Coders disagreed most on cases be-
longing to the Military and political violence and
Politics domains. For example, the following is
a case where the two raters disagreed (and which
was eventutally assigned a Military and political vi-
olence domain):

5 Examples of SSA categories from MSA
news

We illustrate examples of each category in our anno-
tation scheme. We also show and discuss examples
for each category where the annotators differed in
their annotations. Importantly, the two annotators
discussed and adjudicated together the differences.

5.1 Objective Sentences
Sentences where no opinion, sentiment, speculation,
etc. is expressed are tagged as OBJ. Typically such
sentences relay factual information, potentially
expressed by an official source, like examples 1-3

Examples 1-3 show that objective sentences can
have some implicitly negative words/phrases like

�@ ”{nsHAb” (”withdrawl”). In addition, al-

though these 3 examples convey bad news, they are
annotated with an OBJ tag since the sentences are
judged as facts, although one annotator did initially
tag example 1 as S-NEG before it was resolved later.
In a similar vein, the OBJ tag was also assigned to
good news as in example 4 below:

The subtle nature of subjectivity as expressed in
the news genre is reflected in some of the posi-
tive examples, especially in directly or indirectly
quoted content when quoted people express their
emotion or support their cause (via e.g., using
modifiers). For instance, the use of the phrases
\" ÈAÓñË@

SwmAl” (”for the advancement of Somalia”) and

successful coaches in Asia, more specifically in the
Gulf area, and it is enough that he lead the Kuwaiti
team to winning the Gulf Cup twice in a row in 96

5.3 Subjective Negative Sentences
Again, the more explicit negative content was found
to be frequent in sentences with quoted content (as is
illustrated in examples 12-14). (12) shows how the
S-NEG S-POS sentiment can be very strong as is il-
lustrated by the use of the noun phrase ú

English: A statement from the Turkish Foreign
Ministry indicated that ”Turkey follows with great
concern the terrorist attacks that have occurred in
recent days in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan”.

Speech acts have also been used to express neg-
ative sentiment. For example, (14) is a direct quo-
tation where a political figure denounces the acts of
hearers. The speech act is intensified through the use
of the adverb ú �æk ”HtY” (”even”):

English: Sharon, addressing Labour MPs from
the Knesset, said: ”You have even abandoned the
biggest part of the old city”.

Majority of the sentences pertaining to the mili-
tary and political violence domain were OBJ, how-
ever, some of the sentences belonging to this specific
domain were annotated S-NEG. News reporting is
supposed to be objective, story authors sometimes
used very negative modifiers, sometimes metaphor-
ically as is indicated in (15). Example 15, however,
was labeled OBJ by one of the annotators, and later
agrrement was reached that it is more of an S-NEG
case.

the future, as is illustrated by sentences 18 and 19:

Hedges were also used to show cautious commit-

to S-NEUT ones. Sentences (20) and (21) are exam-

Some S-NEUT cases are examples of arguing that
something is true or should be done (Somasundaran
et al., 2007). (22) is an illustrative example:

Example 22 was, however, initially tagged as
OBJ. Later, the two annotators agreed to assign it
an S-NEUT tag.

6 Related Work

There are a number of datasets annotated for SSA.
Most relevant to us is work on the news genre.
(Wiebe et al., 2005) describe a fine-grained news

corpus manually labeled for SSA5 at the word and
phrase levels. Their annotation scheme involves
identifying the source and target of sentiment as
well as other related properties (e.g., the intensity of
expressed sentiment). Our work is less fine grained
on the one hand, but we label our data for domain as
well as subjectivity.

(Balahur et al., 2009) report work on labeling
quotations from the news involving one person men-
tioning another entity and maintain that quotations
typically contain more sentiment expressions than
other parts of news articles. Our work is different
from that of (Balahur et al., 2009) in that we label
all sentences regardless whether they include quota-
tions or not. (Balahur et al., 2009) found that enti-
ties mentioned in quotations are not necessarily the
target of the sentiment, and hence we believe that
SSA systems built for news are better if they focus
on all the sentences of articles rather than quotations
alone (since the target of sentiment may be outside
the scope of a quotation, but within that of the sen-
tence to which a quotation belongs)..

The only work on Arabic SSA we are aware of is
that of Abbasi et al. (2008) who briefly describe la-
beling a collection of documents from Arabic Web
forums. (Abbasi et al., 2008)’s dataset, however, is
not publicly available and detailed information as to
how the data was annotated is lacking. Our work is
different from (Abbasi et al., 2008)’s in that we la-
bel instances at the sentence level. We believe that
documents contain mixtures of OBJ and SUBJ cases
and hence sentence-level annotation is more fine-
grained. In addition, (Abbasi et al., 2008) focus
on a specific domain of ’dark Web forums’.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel annotation layer of
SSA to an already labeled MSA data set, the PATB
Part 1 ver. 3.0. To the best of our knowledge, this
layer of annotation is the first of its kind on MSA
data of the newswire genre. We will make that col-
lection available to the community at large. We mo-
tivate SSA for news and summarize our linguistics-
motivated guidelines for data annotation and provide
examples from our data set.

5They use the term private states (Quirk et al., 1974) to
refer to expressions of subjectivity.
