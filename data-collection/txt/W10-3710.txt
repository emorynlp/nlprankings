Abstract 

In linguistic studies, reduplication gener-
ally means the repetition of any linguis-
tic unit such as a phoneme, morpheme, 
word, phrase, clause or the utterance as a 
whole. The identification of reduplica-
tion is a part of general task of identifica-
tion of multiword expressions (MWE). 
In the present work, reduplications have 
been identified from the Bengali corpus 
of the articles of Rabindranath Tagore. 
The present rule-based approach is di-
vided into two phases. In the first phase, 
identification of reduplications has been 
done mainly at general expression level 
and in the second phase, their structural 
and semantics classifications are ana-
lyzed. The system has been evaluated 
with average Precision, Recall and F-
Score values of 92.82%, 91.50% and 
92.15% respectively. 

1 Introduction 

In all languages, the repetition of noun, pronoun, 
adjective and verb are broadly classified under 
two coarse-grained categories: repetition at the 
(a) expression level, and at the (b) contents or 
semantic level. The repetition at both the levels 
is mainly used for emphasis, generality, intensity 
or to show continuation of an act.  The paper 
deals with the identification of reduplications at 
both levels in Bengali. Reduplication phenome-
non is not an exotic feature of Indian Languages. 
For instance, Yiddish English has duplication of 
the form X schm-X, as in "duplication schmu-
plication". Semantic duplication is also rich in 

English and Onomatopoeic repetition is not un-
common either (e.g., ha-ha, blah-blah etc).  

Reduplication carries various semantic mean-
ings and sometime helps to identify the mental 
state of the speaker as well. Some correlative 
words are used in Bengali to express the posses-
siveness, relative or descriptiveness. They are 
called ‘secondary descriptive compounds’.  

The related studies on MWEs are discussed in 
Section 2. Various types of reduplications in 
Bengali and their semantic interpretations are 
discussed in Section 3. The proposed system 
architecture and the procedures are discussed in 
Section 4. The evaluation metrics used for eva-
luating the system are discussed in Section 5.  
Experimental results are presented in Section 6 
and conclusions are drawn in Section 7.  

2 Related Work 

The works on MWE identification and extrac-
tion have been continuing in English (Fillmore, 
2003; Sag et. al, 2002). After tokenization, mul-
tiword expressions are important in understand-
ing the meaning in applications like Machine 
Translation, Information Retrieval system etc. 
Some of the MWE extraction tasks in English 
can be seen in (Diab and Bhutada, 2009; Enivre 
and Nilson, 2004). Among Indian languages, 
Hindi compound noun MWE extraction has been 
studied in (Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008). 
Manipuri reduplicated MWE identification is 
discussed in (Nongmeikapam and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2010). There are no published works on 
reduplicated MWE identification in Bengali.  

3 Reduplication of Words in Bengali 

Identification of MWEs is done during the to-
kenization phase and is absolutely necessary 

73



during POS tagging as is outlined in (Thoudam 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2008). POS tagger identi-
fies MWE as unknown word at token level. 
Bengali Shallow Parser 1  can only identify hy-
phened reduplication and gives them separate 
tags like RDP (reduplication) or ECH (echo).  

Another objective for identifying reduplicated 
MWEs is to extract correct sense of reduplicated 
MWEs as discussed in Section 3.2. Sometime, 
reduplication is used for sentiment marking to 
identify whether the speaker uses it in positive or 
negative sense. For example,  
(i) Eto Bara Bara Asha Kisher?(Why are you 

thinking so high?)  (Positive Sense) 
(ii) Ki Bara Bara Bari Ekhane! (Here, the 

buildings are very large.) (Negative Sense)  

3.1 Expression Level Classification of Redu-
plication 

Four classes of reduplications commonly occur 
in the Indian language (Bengali, Hindi, Tamil2, 
Manipuri etc.). In Bengali, another type called 
correlated word is also classified as reduplica-
tion.  

Onomatopoeic expressions: Such words rep-
resent an imitation of a particular sound or imita-
tion of an action along with the sound, etc. For 
example, khat khat, (knock knock). 

Complete Reduplication: The individual 
words carry certain meaning, and they are re-
peated. e.g. bara-bara (big big), dheere dheere, 
slowly). In some cases, both the speaker and the 
listener repeat certain clauses or phrases in long 
utterances or narrations. The repetition of such 
utterances breaks the monotony of the narration, 
allows a pause for the listener to comprehend the 
situation, and also provides an opportunity to the 
speaker to change the style of narration. 

Partial Reduplication: Only one of the 
words is meaningful, while the second word is 
constructed by partially reduplicating the first 
word. Most common type in Bengali is one 
where the first letter or the associated matra or 
both is changed, e.g. thakur-thukur (God), 
boka-soka ( Foolish) etc.  

Semantic Reduplication: The most common 
forms of semantic relations between paired 
words are synonym (matha-mundu, head), an-

2 http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sjoh0535/thesis.html 

tonym (din-rat, day and night), class representa-
tive (cha-paani, snacks)). 

Correlative Reduplication: To express a 
sense of exchange or barter or interchange, the 
style of corresponding correlative words is used 
just preceding the main root verb. For example, 
maramari( fighting).  

3.2 Reduplication at the Sense Level 

Different types of reduplication at the sense 
level are described below: 
i. Sense of repetition:  

       Bachar Bachar Ek Kaj Kara . 
       ( Do the same job every year.)  

ii. Sense of plurality: 
 Ki Bara Bara Bari Ekhane. 
 (Here, the houses are very large.) 

iii. Sense of Emphatic or Modifying Meaning:   
         Lala-Lala phul. (Deep red rose) 
iv. Sense of completion:  

        Kheye Deye Ami Shute Jaba. 
         After eating, I shall go to sleep. 

v. Sense of hesitation or softness:  
       Eta Hasi Hasi Mukh Kena? 
 Why does your face smiling? 

vi. Sense of incompleteness of the verbs: 
  Katha Bolte Bolte Hatat Se Chup Kore Gelo. 
    Talking about something, suddenly he      

stopped. 
vii. Sense of corresponding correlative words: 

     Nijera  Maramari Kara  Na.  
 Don’t fight among yourselves. 

viii.   Sense of Onomatopoeia:  
     Shyamal Darja Khata khata Karchhe .  

 Shyamal is knocking at the door. 

4 System Design 

The system is designed in two phases. The first 
phase identifies mainly five cases of reduplica-
tion discussed in Section 3.1 and the second 
phase attempts to extract the associated sense or 
semantics discussed in Section 3.2.     

4.1 Identifying Reduplications 

 Reduplication is considered as two consecutive 
words W1 and W2. For complete reduplica-
tion, after removing matra, comparison for com-
plete equality of two words is checked. 

74



  In partial reduplication, three cases are pos-
sible- (i) change of the first vowel or the matra 
attached with first consonant, (ii) change of con-
sonant itself in first position or (iii) change of 
both matra and consonant. Exception is reported 
where vowel in first position is changed to con-
sonant and its corresponding matra is added. For 
example, ���-���� (abal-tabal, incoherent or 
irrelevant). Linguistic study (Chattopadhyay, 
1992) reveals that the consonants that can be 
produced after changing are �, �, �, �. 

For onomatopoeic expression, mainly words 
are repeated twice and may be with some matra 
(mainly ‘e-matra is added with the first word to 
make second word). In this case, after removing 
inflection, words are divided equally and then 
the comparison is done.  

For correlative reduplication, the formative 
affixes � and -i are added with the root to 
form w1 and w2 respectively and agglutinated 
together to make a single word. 

For semantic reduplication, a dictionary 
based approach has been taken. List of inflec-
tions identified for the semantic reduplication is 
shown in Table 1.  

 

Set of identified inflections and matra 
0(���� ), e(-��, -�), -��(-e��), -��, ��(-e��), -
�, -e�(���), e��, -���,  -��, -�, -����� , -o, -i, 

 

Table 1. Inflections identified for semantic redu-
plication. 

This system has identified those consecutive 
words having same part-of-speech. Then, mor-
phological analysis has been done to identify the 
roots of both components. In synonymous redu-
plication, w2 is the synonym of w1. So, at first 
in Bengali monolingual dictionary, the entry of 
w1 is searched to have any existence of w2. For 
antonym words, they are mainly gradable oppo-
site (pap-purna, Vice and Virtue) where the 
word and its antonyms are entirely different 
word forms. The productive opposites (garraji, 
disagree is the opposite of raji, agree) are easy 
to identify because the opposite word is gener-
ated by adding some fixed number of prefixes or 
suffixes with the original. In dictionary based 
approach, English meaning of both w1 and w2 
are extracted and opposite of w1 is searched in 

English WordNet3 for any entry of w2. The first 
model for identifying the five types of reduplica-
tions is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Semantics (Sense) Analysis 

Mainly eight types of semantic classifications 
are identified in Section 3.2. If the reduplication 
is an onomatopoeic expression, its sense is easily 
identified as the sense of onomatopoeia. When 
infinite verb with complete reduplication is iden-
tified in a sentence, it obviously expresses the 
sense of incompleteness. The semantic or partial 
reduplicated words belong to the sense of com-
pletion. The correlative word is classified as the 
sense of corresponding correlative word because 
it is generally associated with the full verb in the 
sentence. The problem arises when grouping the 
complete reduplication. Sometime they are used 
as sense of repetition, plurality and sometime 
they express some kind of hesitation, incom-
pleteness or softness. Sense disambiguation for 
this case has been identified as a future work.  

5 Evaluation Metrics 

The corpus is collected from some selected arti-
cles of Rabindranath Tagore4. Standard IR met-
rics like Precision, Recall and F-score are used 
to evaluate the system. Total number of relevant

reduplication is identified manually. For each 
type of expression level classification, Precision, 
Recall and F-score are calculated separately. The 
overall system score is the average of these 
scores. Statistical co-occurrence measures like 
frequency, hyphen and closed form count are 
calculated on each of the types as an evidence of 
their MWEhood.  

6 Experimental Results 

The collected corpus includes 14,810 tokens for 
3675 distinct word forms at the root level.  Pre-
cision, Recall, F-score are calculated for each 
class as well as for the reduplication identifica-
tion system and are shown in Table 2. 

Reduplications Precision Recall F-
Score 

Onomatopoeic 99.85 99.77 99.79 
Complete 99.98 99.92 99.95 

Partial 79.15 75.80 77.44 
Semantic 85.20 82.26 83.71 

Correlative 99.91 99.73 99.82 
System 92.82 91.50 92.15 

 
Table 2. Evaluation results for various reduplica-
tions (in %). 

The scores of partial and semantic evaluation 
are not satisfactory because of some wrong tag-
ging by the shallow parser (adjective, adverb and 
noun are mainly interchanged). Some synony-
mous reduplication (����-�����, dhire-susthe, 
slowly and steadily, leisurely) implies some 
sense of the previous word but not its exact 
synonym. These words are not identified prop-
erly.  Figure 2 shows that the use of complete 
reduplication is more in this corpus. In this cor-
pus, only 8.52% reduplications are hyphened. It 
shows that the trend of writing reduplications is 
to use the space as separator. Also the percent-
age of closed reduplications is 33.09% where 
maximum of them are onomatopoeic, correlative 
and semantic reduplications. 100% of correlative 
reduplications are closed. 

7 Conclusion 

The reduplication phenomenon has been studied 
for Bengali at the expression as well as at the 
semantic levels. The semantics of the redupli-

cated words indicate some sort of sense disam-
biguation that cannot be handled by only rule-
based approach. More works need to be done for 
identifying semantic reduplication using statisti-
cal and morphological approaches.
