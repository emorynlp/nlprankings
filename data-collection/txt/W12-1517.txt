Abstract

This paper concerns the architecture of a gen-
erator for Italian Sign Language. In particu-
lar we describe a microplanner based on an
expert-system and a combinatory categorial
grammar used in realization.

1 Introduction

In this paper we present the main features of the
generator used into a translation architecture from
Italian to Italian Sign Language (Lingua Italiana
dei Segni, henceforth LIS), that is the sign lan-
guage used by the Italian deaf (signing) community
(Volterra, 2004). Our generator consists of two mod-
ules: (i) SentenceDesigner, that is a rule-based mi-
croplanner; (ii) OpenCCG, that is a chart realizer
(White, 2006). There are two main issues in this
work. The first issue concerns the use of an expert
system for microplanning. Most of our knowledge
about LIS linguistics derives from discussions with
linguists: expert systems allow for sharp modular-
ization of this human knowledge. Moreover, expert-
system allow us for easily updateable knowledge or-
ganization in cases of conflict or contradiction. The
second issue in our work concerns the design of
a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) used by
the realizer. This CCG accounts for a number of
specific LIS phenomena as spatial verb-arguments
agreement and NP coordination.1

1In this paper we present a grammatical account for spatial
verb-arguments agreement. A different approach, that we are
exploring too, is to consider space allocation as separate process
that takes as input the syntactic structure, similar to prosody in
vocal languages.

perature values exceed the average) produced by the TUP
parser.

In order to reduce the difficulties of our project we
concentrated on a specific application domain, i.e.
weather forecasts: a group of linguists produced a
small parallel corpus (300 sentences) of Italian-LIS
sentences extracted from TV news and concerning
weather forecasts. Building vocal-SL parallel cor-
pora is a hard task: there are theoretical difficulties
concerning the extra-video annotation. In particu-
lar, while there are standards for the representation
of the phonological information of the signs, there
are no standard ways to represent their morpho-
syntactic inflections. The corpus has been used pri-
marily to produce an electronic dictionary for the
virtual interpreter consisting of about 1500 signs,
that provides a lexicon for the realizer too. In con-
trast, most of the knowledge about LIS syntax comes
from discussions with some linguists.

2 Parsing and Interpretation

Our interlingua translation system is a chain com-
posed of four distinct modules, that are: (1) a de-
pendency parser for Italian; (2) an ontology based
semantic interpreter; (3) a generator; (4) a virtual
actor that performs the synthesis of the final LIS sen-
tence. In this Section we give some details about the

105



parser and the semantic interpreter, in Sections 3 and
4 we describe the generator.

In the first step, the syntactic structure of the
source language is produced by the TUP, a rule-
based parser (Lesmo, 2007). The TUP is based on
a morphological dictionary of Italian (about 25, 000
lemmata) and a rule-based grammar, and it produces
a dependency tree, that makes clear the structural
syntactic relationships occurring between the words
of the sentence. Each word in the source sentence is
associated with a node of the tree, and the nodes are
linked via labeled arcs that specify the syntactic role
of the dependents with respect to their head (the par-
ent node). In Figure 1 we show the syntactic analy-
sis for the sentence “Valori di temperatura superiori
alla media” (rough translation: Temperature values
exceed the average). The edge label “ARG” indi-
cates an ARGument relation, i.e. an obligatory rela-
tion between the head and its argument. The edge
label “RMOD” indicates a Restricting MODifier re-
lation, i.e. a non obligatory relation from the head
and its dependent (Bosco and Lombardo, 2004).

from the interpretation of the sentence “Valori di temper-
atura superiori alla media”.

The second step of the translation is the seman-
tic interpretation: the syntax-semantics interface is
based on ontologies (Lesmo et al., 2011). The
knowledge in the ontology, which has been designed
for this specific application, concerns the application
domain, i.e. weather forecasts, as well as more gen-
eral common knowledge about the world. Note that
the ontology used by the semantic interpreter is not
the same ontology used by the generator (microplan-
ner and realizer): indeed, whilst the semantic inter-
preter ontology describes the linguistic knowledge
of the Italian language, the generator describes the
linguistic knowledge of the LIS. Starting from the
lexical semantics of the words and on the basis of the
dependency structure, a recursive function searches
in the ontology providing a number of “connection

paths” that represent the meaning. In fact, the final
sentence meaning consists of a complex fragment of
the ontology, i.e. a single connected semantic net-
work (Lesmo et al., 2011). In Figure 2 we show a
fragment of the semantic network resulting from the
interpretation of the sentence “Valori di temperatura
superiori alla media”. The nodes of the network con-
tain instances (prefix name £), concepts (prefix name
££) relations (prefix name &) from the ontology. In
Figure 2 the nodes AVERAGE, GRATER-THAN are in-
stances, the other nodes are concepts. Informally
speaking, we can say that the semantic interpreter
organizes the information of the semantic network
as a number of “information chunks” that are weakly
connected to the other parts of the network. In the
network of Figure 2 we can distinguish two chunks.
The paraphrase of these chuncks meanings is: there
is a (temperature) value involved in a comparison
(chunk 1) with a mathematical value that is the aver-
age (chunk 2). In the next section we describe how
the microplanner manages this organization of the
information.

3 The SentenceDesigner microplanner

In a previous version of our system we assumed
that the semantic network encoded a single chunk of
meaning expressing the semantics of the event only
in terms of predicate-arguments. The working hy-
pothesis was to assume a one-to-one sentence align-
ment between source and target sentences. This sim-
plification assumption allowed for a trivial genera-
tion architecture that did not have a microplanning
phase at all, and just delegated a simple form of lex-
icalization to the realizer. However, newer version
of the semantic interpreter produced more complex
semantic networks. Therefore, in our project we re-
move the previous assumption and in this Section we
describe SentenceDesigner, a rule-based microplan-
ner. SentenceDesigner basically performs the fol-
lowing three-steps algorithm:
1. Segmentation

a. Split the semantic network
into atomic messages

2. Lexicalization
For each message:
a. Introduce prelexical nodes
b. Introduce syntactic relations

between prelexical nodes
3. Simplification

106



For each message:
a. Extend syntactic relations

among messages
b. Remove non-necessary

prelexical nodes
c. Remove repetitions

among messages
d. Remove semantic relations

and reorder messages

In the first step SentenceDesigner split the seman-
tic networks into a number of subgraphs: the idea
is to recognize which parts of the network con-
tain an atomic message, i.e. a complete information
chunk, that can potentially be generated as a sin-
gular sentence. SentenceDesigner uses a very sim-
ple heuristic for this step: a message is a subtree
of the network, i.e. a root-node together with all of
its descendants in the network. We call root-node a
node that does not have any parent: in Figure 2 the
nodes COMPARISON-RELATION, APPLIED-FUNCTION
are root-nodes. Note that some nodes belong to sev-
eral distinct messages: for example the MATH-VALUE
belongs to the messages rooted by COMPARISON-
RELATION and APPLIED-FUNCTION respectively.

Figure 3: Two rules of the knowledge-base used by the
expert system for lexicalization.

In the second step, that corresponds to “lexical-
ization” (Reiter and Dale, 2000), SentenceDesigner
performs two distinct procedures for each message.
The procedure 2-a. introduces new prelexical nodes
in the message that will be treated as lexical items
in the realization phase. Also in this case we have
a very simple heuristic that associates one-to-one
prelexical nodes to concepts and instances. The
prelexical nodes are organized into a lexical ontol-
ogy that is shared with the realizer: in this way
the microplanner informs the realizer of the selec-

tional restrictions that the semantics imposes on the
syntactic behaviour of lexical nodes (e.g. colloca-
tions). For example, the prelexical node value be-
longing to the class evaluable-entity is in-
troduced in place to the concept MATH-VALUE. Note
that currently we are not yet able to deal with re-
ferring expressions generation for instances, i.e. we
uniformly treat concepts and instances: in future we
plan to integrate into the system a specific module
for this task. The procedure 2-b. concerns the in-
troduction of syntactic relations between prelexical
nodes. This is a very complex and critical task: on
the one hand we need to encode the linguistic knowl-
edge produced by the corpus analysis (see below)
and by many discussions with linguists; on the other
hand we need to account for the behaviour of these
relations in the CCG used by the realizer. In order
to manage this complexity we decided to use an ex-
pert system (Stefik et al., 1982).2 Indeed, expert sys-
tems allow for a sharp modularization of the knowl-
edge and allow for a clear resolution of conflicts:
we needed several revisions of our formalization and
expert systems speed-up this process. In Figure 3 we
show two rules that are “fired” by SentenceDesigner
during the microplanning of the semantic network in
Figure 2: the first rule encodes the comparison se-
mantic relation into one subject (SYN-SUBJ) and one
object (SYN-OBJ) syntactic relations; the second rule
encodes the semantic relation concerning a math-
ematical value as a modifier (SYN-RMOD) relation.
The actual implementation of the system consists of
about 50 rules and very complex rules are necessary
for particular syntactic constructions as coordination
or subordinate clauses, i.e. to manage aggregation.

The third step of the algorithm concerns the sim-
plification of the messages built in the previous step.
In 3-a. we “propagate” the syntactic relations among
the various messages: if a prelexical node belongs
to various messages, then all the syntactic relations
starting from that node will be replicated in all the
messages. For example, the prelexical node aver-
age is replicated in the message rooted by the node
COMPARISON-RELATION, since value is connected
to the prelexical node average by the syntactic re-

used the LISA expert system. This is an implementation of the
RETE algorithm compliant with Common lisp Specifications

lation modifier in the message rooted by the node
APPLIED-FUNCTION. In 3-b., we remove non neces-
sary prelexical nodes: corpus analysis showed that
LIS often is “lexically simpler” with respect to the
corresponding Italian sentence, and in order to pro-
duce fluent LIS sentences we need to remove some
prelexical nodes. For example, the Italian phrase
“valori di temperatura” (values of temperature) is
translated by omitting the sign for “valore”. In 3-c.,
we remove messages that are properly included in
other messages: this can happen as a consequence
of the procedure 3-a. For example, at this stage
the syntactic information of the message rooted by
the node APPLIED-FUNCTION is properly contained
in the message rooted by the node COMPARISON-
RELATION. In 3-d., we remove the semantic relations
and reorder the remaining messages on the basis of
a simple heuristics: for example, temporal informa-
tion will be passed first to the realizer. The final

result of SentenceDesigner consists of a number of
syntactic messages, i.e. a number of abstract syntax
trees: each tree will be realized as single sentence
(Reiter and Dale, 2000). In Figure 4 there are the
abstract syntax tree produced by SentenceDesigner
on the input given by the semantic network of Fig-
ure 2.

4 A CCG for LIS

In our architecture we use the OpenCCG realizer
(White, 2006), an open source tool that is based
on categorial grammars (CCG) (Steedman, 2000).
Some previous works on translation to SL accounted
for typical syntactic phenomena by using lexical-
ized grammars and feature unification too (Veale
and Conway, 1994; Zhao et al., 2000; Huener-
fauth, 2006). However we use the OpenCCG since
it allows us to encode the LIS inflectional system
by using features in the syntactic categories. The

L2 SUPERIORE R2”.

integration in one single elementary structure of
morphology-syntax-semantics is appealing for SLs,
where the absence of function words increases the
importance of morpho-syntactic features to express
the correct meaning of the sentence.

A challenging requirement of our project is that
the SLs do not have a natural written form. As
a consequence we developed an artificial written
form for LIS. Our electronic lexicon is stored into
a database, such that an entry consists of a unique
alphanumeric ID. However, for the sake of clarity
here we write a LIS sentence just as a sequence of
glosses. We use names (in uppercase) for the glosses
that are related to their rough translation into Ital-
ian. The only feature that we explicitly represent in
glosses is the spatial position of the sign (cf. (Zhao
et al., 2000)). We assume a discrete horizontal di-
mension consisting of seven positions L1 (the left-
most position), L2, L3, N (the neutral position), R3,
R2, R1 (the rightmost position).

Similarly to American SL, in LIS we can tell a
number of verb classes on the basis of spatial ac-
cord (Volterra, 2004; Wright, 2008; Brentani, 2010).
For instance the verb Li SUPERIORE Rj (exceed)
belongs to the class II-A, i.e. it is a transitive verb
such that the starting position of the sign (Li) co-
incides with the position of the subject, as well as
the ending position of the sign (Rj) coincides with
the position of the object (Volterra, 2004). Sim-
ilarly to (Wright, 2008), we model LIS linguistic
phenomenon in CCG by using a morphological fea-
ture. This feature encodes the position of the noun in
the atomic category NP , as well as the starting and
ending position of a verb in the complex category
S\NP\NP (in accord with (Geraci, 2004) and in
contrast to (Volterra, 2004) we assume that LIS re-
spects the SOV order). In Fig. 5 we show the re-

108



alization of the LIS sentence “TEMPERATURA R2
VALORE L2 MEDIA L2 L2 SUPERIORE R2” by
using the abstract syntactic tree in Figure 4. The
feature unification mechanism constraints the NP ar-
guments to agree with the starting and ending po-
sition of the verb: the subject TEMPERATURA is
signed in the position R2, i.e. the starting position
of the verb SUPERIORE, while the object MEDIA
is signed in the position L2, i.e. the ending position
of the verb. More details about our formalization of
verb-arguments and NP-coordination in LIS can be
found in (Mazzei, 2011).

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a generator for
LIS adopted into a symbolic translation architecture.
The generator is composed by a expert-system based
microplanner and a CCG based realizer. The expert-
system allows us to manage and update the knowl-
edge provided by linguists and derived from corpus
analysis. CCG allowed for a clear formalization of
LIS syntax.

While the design of a quantitative evaluation of
the system is still in progress, a preliminary quali-
tative evaluation provided us some information. In
particular, two native LIS signers give a positive
evaluation about the space allocation of the signs but
give a negative feedback on modifiers word order.
