Abstract

This paper describes the work which aimed to create a semantic transparency dataset of Chi-
nese nominal compounds (SemTransCNC 1.0) by crowdsourcing methodology. We firstly se-
lected about 1,200 Chinese nominal compounds from a lexicon of modern Chinese and the Sinica
Corpus. Then through a series of crowdsourcing experiments conducted on the Crowdflower
platform, we successfully collected both overall semantic transparency and constituent semantic
transparency data for each of them. According to our evaluation, the data quality is good. This
work filled a gap in Chinese language resources and also practiced and explored the crowdsourc-
ing methodology for linguistic experiment and language resource construction.

1 Introduction

The meaning of “马虎” (mǎhu, horse-tiger, ‘careless’) has nearly nothing to do with neither “马” (mǎ,
‘horse’) nor “虎” (hǔ, ‘tiger’). However the meaning of “道路” (dàolù, road-way, ‘road’) is basically
equal to “道” (dào, ‘road’) or “路” (lù, ‘way’). And there are intermediate cases too, for instance, “江
湖” (jiānghú, river-lake, ‘all corners of the country’), its meaning is not equal to “江” (jiāng, ‘river’)
plus “湖” (hú, ‘lake’), but clear relatedness between them can be observed. This phenomenon is called
semantic transparency of compounds. We distinguish between overall semantic transparency (OST) and
constituent semantic transparency (CST). The semantic transparency of a compound, i.e., the overall se-
mantic transparency, is the extent to which the compound retains its literal meaning in its actual meaning.
The semantic transparency of a constituent of a compound, i.e., the constituent semantic transparency, is
the extent to which the constituent retains its meaning in the actual meaning of the compound. Semantic
similarity between the literal meaning and the actual meaning of a compound can be used to estimate the
overall semantic transparency of a compound, for the more the literal meaning is retained in the actual
meaning, the more similar they are. The same technique can be used to estimate constituent semantic
transparency. Semantic transparency can be quantified; if we assign 0 to “fully opaque” and assign 1 to
“fully transparent”, then semantic transparency can be quantified as a closed interval [0, 1].
The quantitative analysis of semantic transparency must be supported by semantic transparency

datasets. In previous semantic transparency related studies on Chinese compounds, some researchers
created some datasets to support their own studies. But this kind of datasets are usually relatively small
and restrictive, so cannot be used widely, for example, (徐彩华 and李镗, 2001; Myers et al., 2004;干
红梅, 2008; Mok, 2009), etc. Some datasets, although large enough and can be used in other studies, are
not publicly accessible, for example, (王春茂 and彭聃龄, 1999;高兵 and高峰强, 2005), etc. A large
and publicly accessible semantic transparency dataset of Chinese compounds is still a gap in Chinese
language resources.
Crowdsourcing, as an emergingmethod of data collection and resource construction (Snow et al., 2008;

Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010; Munro et al., 2010; Schnoebelen and Kuperman, 2010; Gurevych and
Zesch, 2013; Wang et al., 2013) and an emerging method of behavioral experiment (Paolacci et al., 2010;

Berinsky et al., 2011; Mason and Suri, 2012; Rand, 2012; Crump et al., 2013), is attracting more andmore
attention from the field of language study and language computing. As a method of data collection and
resource construction, it has the advantages of high speed and low cost, etc. It can use redundancy to filter
out noise in order to improve data quality; if used properly, it can produce expert-level data. As a method
of experiment, besides the above advantages, it also has the following ones, (1) it is easier to obtain large
samples, because the amount of potential participants is huge; (2) the diversity of participants is good,
because the participants are from different places and have different backgrounds; (3) crowdsourcing
environments are usually anonymous, so it is easier to collect certain sensitive data.

2 Method

2.1 Compound Selection

We use the following criteria to select compounds, (1) they are disyllabic nominal compounds; (2) each
of them has the structure NN, AN, or VN; (3) they are composed of free morphemes; (4) they have
mid-range word frequencies; and (5) they are used in both Mainland China and Taiwan. And we select
compounds according to the following procedure:
(1) Extract monosyllabic nouns, adjectives and verbs mainly according to “The Dictionary of Con-

temporary Chinese (the 6th edition)” (现代汉语词典,第 6版), and thus we get three sets, a) the set of
monosyllabic nouns, N; b) the set of monosyllabic adjectives, A; and c) the set of monosyllabic verbs, V.
(2) Extract the words of the structure NN, AN, or VN 1 from the “Lexicon of Common Words in

Contemporary Chinese” (现代汉语常用词表). In this step, NN means both morphemes of the word
appear in the set N; AN means the first morpheme appears in the set A and the second appears in the set
N; VN means the first morpheme appears in the set V and the second appears in the set N. After this step,
we get “word list 1”.
(3) Extract the words which have mid-range frequencies 2 from the Sinica Corpus 4.0 (Chen et al.,

1996). These words are represented in traditional Chinese characters. We convert them into simplified
Chinese characters and only reserve the words which also appear in “word list 1”. After this step, we get
“word list 2”.
(4) Manually verify “word list 2” to generate the final list. Things need to be verified include the

following aspects. (a) Because in “word list 2” word structures are judged automatically, there are many
errors, so we have to verify the correctness of the word structure judgments. (b) We have to make sure
that the morphemes of each word are free morphemes. (c) We also need to delete some proper nouns.
The words we selected appear in both Sinica Corpus 4.0 and “Lexicon of Common Words in Contem-

porary Chinese”. Since there is no completely reliable criterion to identify Chinese word, appearing in
two lexicons ensures their word identity. This also ensures that they are used in both Mainland China and
Taiwan, and further means they are quite possible to be shared in other Chinese language communities,
for example Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, etc.
According to above criteria and procedure, we selected a total of 1,176 words. 664 (56.46%) of them

have the structure NN; 322 (27.38%) have the structure AN; and 190 (16.16%) have the structure VN.

2.2 Experimental Design

Normally, a crowdsourcing experiment should be reasonably small in size. We randomly divide these
1,176 words into 21 groups, Gi (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21); each group has 56 words.

1See苑春法 and黄昌宁 (1998), and Huang (1998) for relevant statistics.
2We use cumulative frequency feature to determine mid-range frequency. Sort the word frequency list of Sinica Corpus

4.0 descendingly; then calculate cumulative frequency word by word until each word corresponds with a cumulative frequency
value; finally, plot a curve on a coordinate plane whose x-axis represents the ranks of words in the sorted list, and the y-axis
represents cumulative frequency values. Very apparently, this curve can be divided into three successive phases; the words
within each phase have similar word frequency features. According to this, we identify three word frequency categories, 5,163
high-frequency words (frequency range: [182, 581823], cumulative frequency range: [0%, 80%]), 19,803 mid-range frequency
words (frequency range: [23, 181], cumulative frequency range: (80%, 93%]), and 177,496 low-frequency words (frequency
range: [1, 22], cumulative frequency range: (93%, 100%]). Sinica Corpus 4.0 contains about 11.2 million word tokens.

Questionnaires
We collect overall semantic transparency (OST) and constituent semantic transparency (CST) data of
these words. In order to avoid interaction, we designed two kinds of questionnaires to collect OST data
and CST data respectively. So Gi (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21) has two questionnaires, one OST questionnaire for
OST data collection and one CST questionnaire for CST data collection. Besides titles and instructions,
each questionnaire has 3 sections. Section 1 is used to collect identity information includes gender, age,
education and location. Section 2 contains four very simple questions about the Chinese language; the
first two questions are open-ended Chinese character identification questions, the third question is a close-
ended homophonic character identification question, and the fourth one is a close-ended antonymous
character identification question; different questionnaires use different questions. Section 3 contains the
questions for semantic transparency data collection. Suppose AB is a disyllabic nominal compound, we
use the following question to collect its OST rating scores: “How is the sum of the meanings of A and
B similar to the meaning of AB?” And use the following two questions to collect its CST rating scores
of its two constituents: “How is the meaning of A when it is used alone similar to its meaning in AB?”
and “How is the meaning of B when it is used alone similar to its meaning in AB?”. 7-point scales are
used in section 3; 1 means “not similar at all” and 7 means “almost the same”.
In order to evaluate the data received in the experiments, we embedded some evaluation devices in the

questionnaires. We mainly evaluated intra-group and inter-group consistency; and if the data have good
intra-group and inter-group consistency, we can believe that the data quality is good. In each group we
choose two words and make them appear twice, we call them intra-group repeated words and we can use
them to evaluate the intra-group consistency. We insert into each group two same extra words, w1“地
步”, w2“高山”, to evaluate the inter-group consistency.

Quality Control Measures
On a crowdsourcing platform like Crowdflower, the participants are anonymous, they may try to cheat
and submit invalid data, and they may come from different countries and speak different languages rather
than the required one. There may be spammers who continuously submit invalid data at very high speed
and they may even bypass the quality control measures to cheat for money. In order to ensure that the
participants are native Chinese speakers and to improve data quality, we use the following measures, (1)
a participant must correctly answer the first two Chinese character identification questions in the section
2s of the questionnaires, and he/she must correctly answer at least one of the last two questions in these
section 2s; (2) If a participant do not satisfy the above conditions, he/she will not see Section 3s; (3) each
word stimulus in section 3s has an option which allows the participants to skip it in case he/she does not
recognize that word; (4) all the questions in the questionnaires must be answered except the ones which
allow to be skipped and are explicitly claimed to be skipped; (5) we wrote a monitor program to detect
and resist spammers automatically; (6) after the experiment is finished, we will analyze the data and filter
out invalid data, and we will discuss this in detail in section 3.

2.3 Experimental Platform and Procedure
We choose Crowdflower as our experimental platform, because according to our previous experiments,
it is a feasible crowdsourcing platform to collect Chinese language data. We create one task for each
questionnaire on the platform; there are 21 groups of word and each group has one OST questionnaire
and one CST questionnaire, so there are a total of 42 tasksT osti , T csti (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21). We publish these
42 tasks successively, and for each task we create a monitor program to detect and resist spammers. All
of these tasks use the following parameters: (1) each task will collect 90 responses; (2) we pay 0.15USD
for each response of OST questionnaire and pay 0.25USD for each response of CST questionnaire; (3)
each worker account of Crowdflower can only submit one response for each questionnaire and each IP
address can only submit one response for each questionnaire; (4) we only allow the workers from the
following regions (according to IP addresses) to submit data: Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau,
Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, New Zealand, and
Indonesia; and we can dynamically disable or enable certain regions on demand in order to ensure both
data quality and quantity.

3 Data Refinement and Result Calculation

TheOST dataset produced by theOST taskT osti (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21) isDosti . The CST dataset produced by
the CST task T csti is Dcsti . Each dataset contains 90 responses. Because of the nature of crowdsourcing
environment, there are many invalid responses in each dataset; so firstly we need to filter them out in
order to refine the data. A response is invalid if (1) its completion time is less than 135 seconds (for
OST responses); its completion time is less than 250 seconds (for CST responses) 3; or (2) it failed to
correctly answer the first two questions of section 2s of the questionnaires; or (3) it wrongly answered
the last two questions of section 2s of the questionnaires; or (4) it skipped one or more words in section
3s of the questionnaires; or (5) it used less than two numbers on the 7-point scales in section 3s of the
questionnaires. The statistics of valid response are shown in Table 1.
The OST dataset Dosti (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21) contains ni valid responses; it means word w in the OST

dataset of the ith group has ni OST rating scores; the arithmetic mean of these ni OST rating scores is
the OST result of word w. The CST results of the two constituents of word w are calculated using the
same algorithm.

4 Evaluation

Three kinds of evaluation measures are used, (1) the intra-group consistency of the OST and CST results,
(2) the inter-group consistency of the OST and CST results, and (3) the correlation between the OST and
CST results.

3Each OST questionnaire has about 70 questions, and each CST questionnaire has about 130; in an OST or CST question-
naire, almost all the questions are the same except the stimuli words and can be instantly answered by intuition; note that a
participant can take part in as many as 42 tasks; according to our test, if a participant is familiar with the tasks, he/she can
answer each question in less than 2 seconds (less than 1 second to identify the stimulus word and another less than 1 second
to rate it) without difficulty. 70 × 2 = 140 seconds, the expected time should be less than this, so we use 135 seconds as
the temporal threshold for valid OST responses. The calculation of the temporal threshold for valid CST responses is similar,
130× 2 = 260 seconds, the expected time should be less than this, so we use 250 seconds.

4.1 Intra-group Consistency

In each group Gi (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21), we selected two words wi,1, wi,2 (intra-group repeated words) and
made them appear twice between which there is enough distance; we can calculate the difference values
between the results of the two appearances of these words.

Intra-group Consistency of OST Results
There are 21 groups and in each group there are two intra-group repeated words, so there are a total of 42
such words. Each intra-group repeated word appears twice, so we can obtain two OST results r1, r2. The
difference value between the two results, d = |r1 − r2|, of each intra-group repeated word is calculated,
so there are 42 difference values. Among them, the maximum value is 0.29; the minimum value is 0;
the median is 0.1; their mean is 0.11; and their standard deviation is 0.08; all of these values are low and
indicate that these OST datasets have good intra-group consistency (see Table 2).

Intra-group Consistency of CST Results
Each intra-group repeated word has two constituents, c1, c2, so each constituent gets two CST results, i.e.,
rc1,1, rc1,2 and rc2,1, rc2,2. We calculate the difference values for the two constituents, d1 = |rc1,1−rc1,2|
and d2 = |rc2,1 − rc2,2|, and get 42 difference values of the first constituents and 42 difference values
of the second constituents. Among the difference values of the first constituents, the maximum value
is 0.27; the minimum value is 0; the median is 0.09; their mean is 0.1, and their standard deviation is
0.07; all of these values are low, this indicates that the CST results of the first constituents in the CST
datasets of the 21 groups have good intra-group consistency. Among the difference values of the second
constituents, the maximum value is 0.36; the minimum value is 0; the median is 0.07; their mean is 0.09,
and their standard deviation is 0.09; all of these values are low; this indicates that the CST results of the
second constituents in the CST datasets of the 21 groups have good intra-group consistency (see Table
3). So these 21 CST datasets have good intra-group consistency.

4.2 Inter-group Consistency

We inserted two inter-group repeated words, w1“地步”, w2“高山”, into all of these 21 groups Gi (i =
1, 2, 3, ..., 21); we can evaluate the inter-group consistency by comparing their semantic transparency
rating results in different groups. Since w1, w2 appear in all OST and CST questionnaires of 21 groups,
we can obtain (1) 21 OST results of w1, (2) 21 OST results of w2, (3) 21 CST results of each of the two
constituents w1,c1, w1,c2 of w1, and (4) 21 CST results of each of the two constituents w2,c1, w2,c2 of w2.
Standard deviation can be used to measure difference, for example, the standard deviation of the 21 OST
results of w1 is 0.2; this value is small and indicates high consistency; because these 21 results are from
the OST datasets of 21 groups respectively, so we can say that these 21 OST datasets have good inter-
group consistency. The standard deviation of the 21 OST results of w2 is 0.14; the standard deviation of
21 CST results of the first constituent of w1 is 0.2, and that of the second is 0.18; the standard deviation
of 21 CST results of the first constituent of w2 is 0.15, and that of the second is 0.2; all of these values
are small and all of them indicate good inter-group consistency (see Table 4).

4.3 Correlation between OST and CST Results

Each compound in the datasets has two constituents; both constituents affect the OST of the compound,
but neither of them can solely determine the OST of the compound. So the mean of the two CST values
of a compound is a fairly good estimation of its OST value. Therefore, if the datasets are reliable, in each
group, we should observe strong correlation between the OST results and their corresponding means of
the CST results. For each group, we calculate three Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r);
r1 is the r between the OST results and their corresponding CST results of the first constituents; r2 is
the r between the OST results and their corresponding CST results of the second constituents; and r3 is
the r between the OST results and their corresponding means of the CST results. The r3 values of the 21
groups are all greater than 0.9 which indicates very strong correlation; among them, the maximum value
is 0.96; the minimum value is 0.91; and their mean is 0.94 (SD = 0.02); the r1 and r2 values are also

5 Merging and Normalization

The evaluation results show that the collected data are generally reliable and have relatively high intra-
group and inter-group consistency which further indicate that these datasets share similar scale and are
basically comparable, so we can merge the 21 OST datasets into one big OST dataset Dost and merge
the 21 CST datasets into one big CST dataset Dcst. When we merge these datasets, we delete all the
extra words which are used to evaluate the inter-group consistency; for the repeated words which are

4After merging and normalization (see Section 5), we calculated these three correlation coefficients betweenDost andDcst,
the results are r1 = 0.68, r2 = 0.68, r3 = 0.87.

Table 3: The Intra-group Consistency of the CST Results of Each Group

used to evaluate the intra-group consistency, the final result of each of them is the mean of its two results.
According to our definition, the range of semantic transparency value is [0, 1], but the experimental results
are obtained using 7-point scales, so we need to normalize these results in order to map them to the range
[0, 1]. The normalized OST and CST results will be merged into Dost and Dcst respectively. Assume
that, in the dataset Dost, the OST result of the ith (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 1176) word is Swi , and the normalized
result is S′wi , then,

S′wi =
Swi − 1

Table 4: The Inter-group Consistency of the OST and CST Results

And assume that, in the dataset Dcst, the CST result of the jth (j = 1, 2) constituent of the ith word is
Sci,j , and the normalized result is S′ci,j , then,

S′ci,j =
Sci,j − 1

6 Distribution

Influenced by outliers and perhaps other factors, the OST and CST results cannot cover the whole range
of the scale [0, 1]; both ends shrink towards the central point 0.5, and the shrinkage of each end is about
0.2; nevertheless, the results can still assign proper ranks of semantic transparency to the compounds and
their constituents which are generally consistent with our intuitions. Among the normalized OST results,
the maximum is 0.81; the minimum is 0.28; the median is 0.63; and their mean is 0.62 (SD = 0.09).
Among the normalized CST results of the first constituents (C1.CST results), the maximum is 0.77; the
minimum is 0.19; the median is 0.57; and their mean is 0.56 (SD = 0.09). And among the normalized
CST results of the second constituents (C2.CST results), the maximum is 0.79; the minimum is 0.22; the
median is 0.6; and their mean is 0.58 (SD = 0.1). The distributions of OST, C1.CST, and C2.CST results
are similar; all of them are negatively skewed (see Figure 1), and their estimated skewnesses are −0.66,
−0.77, and −0.63 respectively. These distributions exhibit that more compounds and their constituents
in our datasets have relatively high semantic transparency values.

7 Conclusion

This work created a dataset of semantic transparency of Chinese nominal compounds (SemTransCNC
1.0), which filled a gap in Chinese language resources. It contains the overall and constituent semantic
transparency data of about 1,200 Chinese disyllabic nominal compounds and can support semantic trans-
parency related studies of Chinese compounds, for example, theoretical, statistical, psycholinguistic, and

computational studies, etc. And this work was also a successful practice of crowdsourcing method for lin-
guistic experiment and language resource construction. Large scale language data collection experiments
which require large amount of participants are usually very difficult to conduct in laboratories using the
traditional paradigm. Crowdsourcing method enabled us to finish the data collection task within rela-
tively short period of time and relatively low budget (1,000USD); during the process of the experiment,
we needed not to organize and communicate with the participants, it saved a lot of time and energy. The
participants are from all over the world, so it is better than traditional laboratory method in the aspect
of participant diversity. The data collected have very good intra-group and inter-group consistency, the
OST and CST data highly correlate with each other as expected, and the results are consistent with our
intuitions: all of these indicate good data quality. The methods of questionnaire design, quality control,
data refinement, evaluation, emerging, and normalization can be used in crowdsourcing practices of the
same kind.
