Abstract

This paper describes the importation of
Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)
data and annotations into the linguistic
database ANNIS, which allows users to vi-
sualize and query linguistically-annotated
corpora. We outline the process of
mapping MASC’s GrAF representation to
ANNIS’s internal format relANNIS and
demonstrate how the system provides ac-
cess to multiple annotation layers in the
corpus. This access provides information
about inter-layer relations and dependen-
cies that have been previously difficult to
explore, and which are highly valuable for
continued development of language pro-
cessing applications.

1 Introduction

Over the past decade, corpora with multiple lay-
ers of linguistic annotation have been developed
in order to extend the range of empirically-based
linguistic research and enable study of inter-layer
interactions. Recently created corpora include
OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007), the Groningen
Meaning Bank (Basile et al., 2012), and the Man-
ually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)1 (Ide et al.,
2010). Typically, such corpora are represented
in idiosyncratic in-house formats, and developers
provide special software to access and query the
annotations (for example, the OntoNotes “db tool”
and Groningen’s GMB Explorer). Access without
the use of developer-supplied software often re-
quires significant programming expertise, and as
a result, it is not easy–or even possible–for others
to add to or modify data and annotations in the re-
source.

This paper describes the importation of MASC
data and annotations into the linguistic database

1www.anc.org/MASC

ANNIS2 (Chiarcos et al., 2008; Zeldes et al.,
2009), which was designed to visualize and query
linguistically-annotated corpora. Unlike most
other corpora with multi-layer annotations, no
special software has been developed for access
to MASC. Instead, all MASC data and annota-
tions are represented in GrAF (Ide and Suder-
man, 2007), the XML serialization of the abstract
model for annotations defined by ISO TC37 SC4’s
Linguistic Annotation Framework (ISO/LAF) (Ide
and Suderman, In press). GrAF is intended to
serve as a generic “pivot” format that is isomor-
phic to annotation schemes conforming to the ab-
stract model and therefore readily mappable to
schemes used in available systems. We outline
the process of mapping GrAF to ANNIS’s internal
format relANNIS and demonstrate how the sys-
tem provides access to multiple annotation layers
in MASC.

2 The ANNIS Infrastructure

The ANNIS system is a linguistic database geared
toward the requirements of querying multi-layer
annotated corpora, and providing various visual-
ization means for layers with different structural
properties. In particular, the annotation types
supported are spans, DAGs with labelled edges,
and pointing relations between terminals or non-
terminals. For illustration, Figure 1 shows a
screenshot where various parallel annotations of
the same data are provided: dependency trees,
constituent trees (here with “secondary edges” in
dotted lines), and a grid view for annotations that
assign labels to token spans. In addition, ANNIS
offers a “discourse view” giving the complete text
with coreference relations indicated by color and
underlining. In the top of the screenshot, it can be
noted that the system also stored video (and au-

dio) data, but that aspect shall not concern us in
this paper.

The system is web-based; the user interface is
written in Java and ExtJS. The backend is Post-
greSQL3. In general, all components are open
source under the Apache License 2.0, and you
can download ANNIS from the above-mentioned
URL. We offer two versions: A server version, and
the more lightweight “ANNIS kickstarter”, which
can be installed locally, e.g., on laptops.

ANNIS is complemented by SaltNPepper, a
framework for converting annotations stemming
from various popular annotation tools (MMAX,
EXMARaLDA, annotate/Synpathy, RSTTool) –
see Section 4.

3 MASC and GrAF

MASC is a fully open, half-million word corpus
covering nineteen diverse genres of American En-
glish drawn from the Open American National
Corpus (OANC)4. The corpus includes manually
produced or hand-validated annotations for mul-
tiple linguistic layers, including morphosyntax
(two different annotations), shallow parse (noun
and verb chunks), Penn Treebank syntax, and
named entities. Portions of the corpus are also
annotated for FrameNet frames, opinion, Prop-
Bank predicate-arguments, and WordNet 3.1 word
senses. Discourse-level annotation, including co-
reference, clauses, and discourse markers, will be
available in fall, 2013.

Like the OANC, all MASC annotations
are rendered in standoff form using GrAF,
the graph-based format developed as a part
of the ISO Linguistic Annotation Framework
(ISO/LAF)(ISO 24612, 2012). GrAF is an XML
serialization of the LAF abstract model for annota-
tions, a formalization of models used across mul-
tiple applications for associating (linking) infor-
mation, including not only directed-acyclic graphs
(DAGs) but also ER diagrams, the Universal Mod-
eling Language (UML), semantic and neural net-
works, RDF/OWL, and, more generally, hyper-
linked data on the World Wide Web. The model
is sufficiently general to represent any type of lin-
guistic annotation; any serialization of the model
can therefore serve as a pivot or intermediary
among diverse annotation formats that conform to
the abstract model. Thus, any sufficiently well-

3http://www.postgresql.org/
4www.anc.org/OANC

formed annotation scheme should be isomorphic
to a GrAF representation of the same information.
Problems arise only when a scheme does not spec-
ify information explicitly but rather embeds the in-
terpretation in processing software rather than in
the representation itself; for transduction to GrAF,
this information must be made explicit in the rep-
resentation.

Funding for MASC did not allow for extensive
software development; the expectation is that by
rendering the corpus in the ISO standard GrAF
format, access could rely on GrAF-aware software
developed by others, or transduction from GrAF
to appropriate alternative formats would be trivial.
We have already developed and deployed means
to import linguistic data represented in GrAF into
UIMA, GATE, and NLTK, and we provide trans-
ducers from GrAF to inline XML and the CoNLL
IOB format.5 Additionally, a GrAF-to-RDF trans-
ducer is near completion, which will enable inclu-
sion of MASC in the Linguistic Linked Open Data
(LLOD) cloud6. The incorporation of a GRAF
transducer for ANNIS provides another example
of the flexibility afforded via the GrAF represen-
tation.

4 Mapping GrAF to ANNIS via
SaltNPepper

Pepper is a software framework that converts lin-
guistic data among various formats, e.g. CoNLL,
EXMARaLDA, PAULA, TigerXML, RSTTool
and TreeTagger (Zipser et al., 2011). It is built
upon the graph-based Salt meta model (Zipser and
Romary, 2010), which is in turn based on the LAF
abstract model for linguistic annotation. Map-
ping GrAF to Salt extends the range of formats
into which annotations represented in GrAF can
be automatically transduced to those to which Salt
has been mapped, including ANNIS’s relational
database format relANNIS.

The following steps were taken to import the
MASC corpus into ANNIS: first, the MASC cor-
pus data was extracted with the GrAF API7. Sec-
ond, a mapping between GrAF and Salt data
structures was created. Most of the conversion
is straightforward, since both models are graph-
based. The only added processing is to provide

explicit edge labels in the Salt representation for
ordered constiuents: in GrAF, directed edges from
one to several other nodes by default represent sets
of ordered constituents and need not be explicitly
labeled as such, whereas in Salt, the role of all
edges must be specified explicitly. Explicit labels
in ANNIS are required in order to generate the ap-
propriate visualizations automatically (e.g. trees
for syntactic hierarchies and arc diagrams for syn-
tactic dependencies).

Finally, the code was structured as a plug-in
for Pepper and parameterized to make it usable
for GrAF-formatted corpora other than MASC. It
will be included in the next SaltNPepper release.
The code is currently available from our software
repository8.

5 MASC in ANNIS: Examples

The ANNIS Query Language (AQL) allows users
to search for specific token values and annotations
as well as relationships between them, even across
annotation level boundaries.9 Token values are
represented as text between quotes (e.g. "men"),
while annotations are specified as attribute-value
pairs (e.g. pos="NN", a part-of-speech attribute
with the value NN). A query for an annotation will
return all elements with that annotation. Where
necessary, namespaces10 can be added to any ele-
ment to disambiguate, e.g., ptb:cat="NP" sig-
nifies all annotation attribute-value pairs (attribute:
cat, value: NP) that are in the ptb (Penn Tree-
bank) namespace.

Relations among elements are specified by
back-referencing incremental variable numbers,
e.g. #1, #2 etc. Linguistically motivated opera-
tors bind the elements together; e.g. #1 > #2
means that the first element dominates the second
in a tree. Operators can express overlap and adja-
cency between annotation spans, as well as recur-
sive hierarchical relations that hold between nodes
(such as elements in a syntactic tree).

The following examples show AQL queries that
combine annotations from different layers:

GrAFModules/

9Note that ANNIS does not allow searching for arbitrary
strings from the primary data, but only for pre-identified seg-
ments such as tokens, named entities, etc.

10A namespace groups one or more types of annotation
into a logical unit, e.g all annotations produced by a specific
tool or project.

1. A VP that dominates a PP which contains a
named person at its right border:

cat="VP" & cat="PP" & NER="person" &

#1>#2 & #2 r #3

2. a VP of passive form in past tense that in-
cludes a mention of a FrameNet frame ele-
ment:

cat="VP" & voice="passive" &

tense="SimPas" & FE="Event" & #1 i #2

& #1 i #3 & #1 i #4

Figure 2 shows the results of a search for an
NP that includes both a named entity of the type
country and a FrameNet frame element of the type
Food:

cat="NP" & anc:type="country" &

FE="Food" & #1 i #2 & #1 i #3

6 Summary and Outlook

We explained the mapping of the MASC multi-
layer corpus to the ANNIS database by interpret-
ing the GrAF format via the Pepper framework.
Both MASC and ANNIS are freely available; a
portion of MASC will also be added to the online
demo version of ANNIS. We are also making the
Pepper converter module for GrAF available.

Version 3 of ANNIS is currently under devel-
opment11. Besides a new front-end and a REST-
based API, it offers improved tokenization support
(annotation on the level of subtokens; conflicting
tokenizations) and handles dialogue corpora with
simultaneous speakers as well as time-aligned au-
dio/video data.

The ability to query across multiple annota-
tion levels opens up significant new possibilities
for exploring linguistically annotated data. Most
commonly, language models are developed us-
ing information from at most one or two linguis-
tic layers; ANNIS enables user to explore inter-
dependencies that have been previously difficult
to detect. By providing tools and data that are
entirely free for use by the community, the AN-
NIS and MASC efforts contribute to the growing
trend toward transparent sharing and openness of
linguistic data and tools.
