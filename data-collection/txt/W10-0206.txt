Abstract 

Emotion cause detection is a new research area 

in emotion processing even though most theo-

ries of emotion treat recognition of a triggering 

cause event as an integral part of emotion. As a 

first step towards fully automatic inference of 

cause-emotion correlation, we propose a text-

driven, rule-based approach to emotion cause 

detection in this paper. First of all, a Chinese 

emotion cause annotated corpus is constructed 

based on our proposed annotation scheme. By 

analyzing the corpus data, we identify seven 

groups of linguistic cues and generalize two 

sets of linguistic rules for detection of emotion 

causes. With the linguistic rules, we then de-

velop a rule-based system for emotion cause 

detection. In addition, we propose an evaluation 

scheme with two phases for performance as-

sessment. Experiments show that our system 

achieves a promising performance for cause oc-

currence detection as well as cause event detec-

tion. The current study should lay the ground 

for future research on the inferences of implicit 

information and the discovery of new informa-

tion based on cause-event relation. 

1 Introduction 

Text-based emotion processing has attracted plenty 

of attention in NLP. Most research has focused on 

the emotion detection and classification by 

identifying the emotion types, for instances 

happiness and sadness, for a given sentence or 

document (Alm 2005, Mihalcea and Liu 2006, 

Tokuhisa et al. 2008). However, on top of this 

surface level information, deeper level information 

regarding emotions, such as the experiencer, cause, 

and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted and 

analyzed for real world applications (Alm 2009). 

In this paper, we aim at mining one of the crucial 

deep level types of information, i.e. emotion cause, 

which provides useful information for applications 

ranging from economic forecasting, public opinion 

mining, to product design. Emotion cause detection 

is a new research area in emotion processing. In 

emotion processing, the cause event and emotion 

correlation is a fertile ground for extraction and 

entailment of new information. As a first step 

towards fully automatic inference of cause-

emotion correlation, we propose a text-driven, 

rule-based approach to emotion cause detection in 

this paper.  

 Most theories of emotion treat recognition of 

a triggering cause event as an integral part of 

emotional experience (Descartes 1649, James 1884, 

Plutchik 1962, Wierzbicka 1999). In this study, 

cause events refer to the explicitly expressed 

arguments or events that evoke the presence of the 

corresponding emotions. They are usually 

expressed by means of propositions, 

nominalizations, and nominals. For example, “they 

like it” is the cause event of the emotion happiness 

in the sentence “I was very happy that they like it”. 

Note that we only take into account emotions that 

are explicitly expressed, which are usually 

presented by emotion keywords, e.g. “This 

surprises me”. Implicit emotions that require 

inference or connotation are not processed in this 

first study. In this study, we first build a Chinese 

emotion cause annotated corpus with five primary 

emotions, i.e. happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and 

surprise. We then examine various linguistic cues 

which help detect emotion cause events: the 

position of cause event and experiencer relative to 

the emotion keyword, causative verbs (e.g. rang4 

“to cause”), action verbs (e.g. xiang3dao4 “to think 

about”), epistemic markers (e.g. kan4jian4 “to 

see”), conjunctions (e.g. yin1wei4 “because”), and 

prepositions (e.g. dui4yu2 “for”). With the help of 

45



these cues, a list of linguistic rules is generalized. 

Based on the linguistic rules, we develop a rule-

based system for emotion cause detection. 

Experiments show that such a rule-based system 

performs promisingly well. We believe that the 
current study should lay the ground for future 

research on inferences and discovery of new 

information based on cause-event relation, such as 

detection of implicit emotion or cause, as well as 

prediction of public opinion based on cause events, 

etc.  

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 

discusses the related work on various aspects of 

emotion analysis. Section 3 describes the construc-

tion of the emotion cause corpus. Section 4 

presents our rule-based system for emotion cause 

detection. Section 5 describes its evaluation and 

performance. Section 6 highlights our main contri-

butions. 

2 Previous Work 

We discuss previous studies on emotion analysis in 

this section, and underline fundamental yet unre-

solved issues. We survey the previous attempts on 

textual emotion processing and how the present 

study differs.  

2.1 Emotion Classes 

Various approaches to emotion classification were 

proposed in different fields, such as philosophy 

(Spinoza 1675, James 1884), biology (Darwin 

1859, linguistics (Wierzbicka 1999, Kövecses 

2000), neuropsychology (Plutchik 1962, Turner 

1996), and computer science (Ortony et al. 1988, 

Picard 1995), as well as varying from language to 

language. Although there is lack of agreement 

among different theories on emotion classification, 

a small number of primary emotions are commonly 

assumed. Other emotions are secondary emotions 

which are the mixtures of the primary emotions.  

Researchers have attempted to propose the list 

of primary emotions, varying from two to ten basic 

emotions (Ekman 1984, Plutchik 1980, Turner 

2000). Fear and anger appear on every list, whe-

reas happiness and sadness appear on most of the 

lists. These four emotions, i.e. fear, anger, happi-

ness, and sadness, are the most common primary 

emotions. Other less common primary emotions 

are surprise, disgust, shame, distress, guilt, interest, 

pain, and acceptance.  

In this study, we adopt Turner’s emotion clas-

sification (2000), which identifies five primary 

emotions, namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger, 

and surprise. Turner’s list consists of primary emo-

tions agreed upon by most previous work. 

2.2 Emotion Processing in Text 

Textual emotion processing is still in its early stag-

es in NLP. Most of the previous works focus on 

emotion classification given a known emotion con-

text such as a sentence or a document using either 

rule-based (Masum et al. 2007, Chaumartin 2007) 

or statistical approaches (Mihalcea and Liu 2005, 

Kozareva et al. 2007). However, the performance 

is far from satisfactory. What is more, many basic 

issues remain unresolved, for instances, the rela-

tionships among emotions, emotion type selection, 

etc. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) was the first to explore 

both the issues of emotion detection and classifica-

tion. It created a Japanese emotion-provoking 

event corpus for an emotion classification task us-

ing an unsupervised approach. However, only 

49.4% of cases were correctly labeled. Chen et al. 

(2009) developed two cognitive-based Chinese 

emotion corpora using a semi-unsupervised ap-

proach, i.e. an emotion-sentence (sentences con-

taining emotions) corpus and a neutral-sentence 

(sentences containing no emotion) corpus. They 

showed that studies based on the emotion-sentence 

corpus (~70%) outperform previous corpora. 

Little research, if not none, has been done to 

examine the interactions between emotions and the 

corresponding cause events, which may make a 

great step towards an effective emotion classifica-

tion model. The lack of research on cause events 

restricted current emotion analysis to simple classi-

ficatory work without exploring the potentials of 

the rich applications of putting emotion ‘in con-

text’. In fact, emotions can be invoked by percep-

tions of external events and in turn trigger 

reactions. The ability to detect implicit invoking 

causes as well as predict actual reactions will add 

rich dimensions to emotion analysis and lead to 

further research on event computing.  

3 Emotion Cause Corpus  

This section briefly describes how the emotion 

cause corpus is constructed. We first explain what 

46



an emotion cause is and discuss how emotion 

cause is linguistically expressed in Chinese. We 

then describe the corpus data and the annotation 

scheme. For more detailed discussion on the con-

struction of the emotion cause corpus, please refer 

to Lee et al. (2010). 

3.1 Cause Events 

Following Talmy (2000), the cause of an emotion 

should be an event itself. In this work, it is called a 

cause event. By cause event, we do not necessarily 

mean the actual trigger of the emotion or what 

leads to the emotion. Rather, it refers to the imme-

diate cause of the emotion, which can be the actual 

trigger event or the perception of the trigger event. 

Adapting TimeML annotation scheme (Saurí et al. 

2004), events refer to situations that happen or oc-

cur. In this study, cause events specifically refer to 

the explicitly expressed arguments or events that 

are highly linked with the presence of the corres-

ponding emotions. In Lee et al.’s (2010) corpus, 

cause events are categorized into two types: verbal 

events and nominal events. Verbal events refer to 

events that involve verbs (i.e. propositions and 

nominalizations), whereas nominal events are 

simply nouns (i.e. nominals). Some examples of 

cause event types are given in bold face in (1)-(6).

The causes in (1) and (2) are propositional causes, 

which indicate the actual events involved in caus-

ing the emotions. The ones in (3) and (4) are no-

minalized causes, whereas (5) and (6) involve 

nominal causes  

3.2 Corpus Data and Annotation Scheme 

Based on the list of 91 Chinese primary emotion 

keywords identified in Chen et al. (2009), we ex-

tract 6,058 instances of sentences by keyword 

matching from the Sinica Corpus
1
, which is a 

tagged balanced corpus of Mandarin Chinese con-

taining a total of ten million words. Each instance 

contains the focus sentence with the emotion key-

word “<FocusSentence>” plus the sentence before 

“<PrefixSentence>” and after “<SuffixSentence>” 

it. The extracted instances include all primary emo-

tion keywords occurring in the Sinica Corpus ex-

cept for the emotion class happiness, as the 

keywords of happiness exceptionally outnumber 

other emotion classes. In order to balance the 

number of each emotion class, we set the upper 

limit at about 1,600 instances for each primary 

emotion.  

Note that the presence of emotion keywords 

does not necessarily convey emotional information 

due to different possible reasons such as negative 

polarity and sense ambiguity. Hence, by manual 

inspection, we remove instances that 1) are non-

emotional; 2) contain highly ambiguous emotion 

keywords, such as ru2yi4 “wish-fulfilled”, hai4xiu1 

“to be shy”, wei2nan2 “to feel awkward”, from the 

corpus. After the removal, the remaining instances 

in the emotion cause corpus is 5,629. Among the 

remaining instances, we also remove the emotion 

keywords in which the instances do not express 

that particular emotion and yet are emotional. The 

total emotion keywords in the corpus is 5,958. 

For each emotional instance, two annotators 

manually annotate cause events of each keyword. 

Since more than one emotion can be present in an

instance, the emotion keywords are tagged as 

<emotionword id=0>, <emotionword id=1>, and 

so on.  

 
573 Y 0/shang1 xin1/Sadness  

<PrefixSentence> ma1ma ye3 wen4 le ling2 ju1, dan4 shi4 

mei2 you3 ren4 jian4 dao4 xiao3 bai2. </PrefixSentence>

ever saw Little White. </PrefixSentence> <FocusSentence>

tionword id=0> sad </emotionword> for a long time, but this 

did not help.  </FocusSentence> <SuffixSentence> Whenever 

[I] see a white stray dog, [I] cannot help thinking of Little 

White. </SuffixSentence> 

Figure 1: An Example of Cause Event Annotation 

 

Figure 1 shows an example of annotated emotional 

sentences in corpus, presented as pinyin with tones, 

followed by an English translation. For an emotion 

keyword tagged as <id=0>, [*01n] marks the be-

ginning of its cause event while [*02n] marks the 

end. The “0” shows which index of emotion key-

word it refers to, “1” marks the beginning of the 

cause event, “2” marks the end, and “n” indicates 

that the cause is a nominal event. For an emotion 

keyword tagged as <id=1>, [*11e] marks the be-

ginning of the cause event while [*12e] marks the 

end, in which “e” refers to a verbal event, i.e. ei-

ther a proposition or a nominalization. An emotion 

keyword can sometimes be associated with more 

than one cause, in which case both causes are 

marked. The emotional sentences containing no 

explicitly expressed cause event remain as they are. 

The actual number of extracted instances of 

each emotion class to be analyzed, the positive 

emotional instances, and the instances with cause 

events are presented in Table 1.  

 
Table 1: Summary of Corpus Data 

Emotions 
No. of Instances 

Extracted Emotional With Causes 

Happiness 1,644 1,327 1,132 (85%) 

Sadness 901 616 468 (76%) 

Fear 897 689 567 (82%) 

Anger 1,175 847 629 (74%) 

Surprise 1,341 781 664 (85%) 

Total 5,958 4,260 (72%) 3,460 (81%) 

We can see that 72% of the extracted instances ex-

press emotions, and 81% of the emotional in-

stances have a cause. The corpus contains 

happiness (1,327) instances the most and sadness 

(616) the least. For each emotion type, about 81% 

of the emotional sentences, on average, are consi-

dered as containing a cause event, with surprise 

the highest (85%) and anger the lowest (73%). 

This indicates that an emotion mostly occurs with 

the cause event explicitly expressed in the text, 

which confirms the prominent role of cause events 

in expressing an emotion. 

4 A Rule-based System for Cause Detec-
tion  

4.1 Linguistic Analysis of Emotion Causes 

By analyzing the corpus data, we examine the 

correlations between emotions and cause events in 

terms of various linguistic cues: the position of 

cause event, verbs, epistemic markers, 

conjunctions, and prepositions. We hypothesize 

that these cues will facilitate the detection of 

emotion cause events.  

 First, we calculate the distribution of cause 

event types of each emotion as well as the position 

of cause events relative to emotion keywords and 

experiencers. The total number of emotional 

instances regarding each emotion is given in Table 

2.  

 
Table 2: Cause Event Position of Each Emotion 

Emotions Cause Type (%) Cause Position (%) 

Event Nominal Left Right 

Happiness 76 6 74 29 

Sadness 67 8 80 20 

Fear 68 13 52 48 

Anger 55 18 71 26 

Surprise 73 12 59 41 

 

Table 2 suggests that emotion cause events tend to 

be expressed by verbal events than nominal events 

and that cause events tend to occur at the position 

to the left of the emotion keyword, with fear (52%) 

being no preference. This may be attributed to the 

fact that fear can be triggered by either factive or 

potential causes, which is rare for other primary 

emotions. For fear, factive causes tend to take the 

left position whereas potential causes tend to take 

the right position. 

48



 Second, we identify seven groups of 

linguistic cues that are highly collocated with 

cause events (Lee et al. 2010), as shown in Table 3.  

 
Table 3: Seven Groups of Linguistic Cues 

Group Cue Words 

I ‘to cause’: rang4, ling4, shi3  

II ‘to think about’: e.g. xiang3 dao4, xiang3 qi3, yi1 

xiang3  

‘to talk about’: e.g. shuo1dao4, jiang3dao4, tan2dao4  

III ‘to say’: e.g. shuo1, dao4 

IV ‘to see’: e.g. kan4dao4, kan4jian4, jian4dao4  

‘to hear’: e.g. ting1dao4, ting1 shuo1 

‘to know’: e.g. zhi1dao4, de2zhi1, fa1xian4 

‘to exist’: you3 

V ‘for’ as in ‘I will do this for you’: wei4, wei4le 

‘for’ as in ‘He is too old for the job’: dui4, dui4yu2 

VI ‘because’: yin1, yin1wei4, you2yu2 

VII ‘is’: deshi4 

‘at’: yu2 

‘can’: neng2 

 

Group I includes three common causative verbs, 

and Group II a list of verbs of thinking and talking. 

Group III is a list of say verbs. Group IV includes 

four types of epistemic markers which are usually 

verbs marking the cognitive awareness of emotion 

in the complement position (Lee and Huang 2009). 

The epistemic markers include verbs of seeing, 

hearing, knowing, and existing. Group V covers 

some prepositions which all roughly mean ‘for’. 

Group VI contains the conjunctions that explicitly 

mark the emotion cause. Group VII includes other 

linguistic cues that do not fall into any of the six 

groups. Each group of linguistic cues serves as an 

indicator marking the cause events in different 

structures of emotional constructions, in which 

Group I specifically marks the end of the cause 

events while the other six groups marks the 

beginning of the cause events. 

4.2 Linguistic Rules for Cause Detection 

We examine 100 emotional sentences of each emo-

tion keyword randomly extracted from the devel-

opment data, and generalize some rules for 

identifying the cause of the corresponding emotion 

verb (Lee 2010). The cause is considered as a 

proposition. It is generally assumed that a proposi-

tion has a verb which optionally takes a noun oc-

curring before it as the subject and a noun after it 

as the object. However, a cause can also be ex-

pressed as a nominal. In other words, both the pre-

dicate and the two arguments are optional provided 

that at least one of them is present.  

We also manually identify the position of the 

experiencer as well as the linguistic cues discussed 

in Section 4.1. All these components may occur in 

the clause containing the emotion verb (focus 

clause), the clause before the focus clause, or the 

clause after the focus clause. The abbreviations 

used in the rules are given as follows:  
 

C = Cause event 

E = Experiencer 

K = Keyword/emotion verb 

B = Clause before the focus clause 

F = Focus clause/the clause containing the emotion verb 

A = Clause after the focus clause 

 

For illustration, an example of the rule description 

is given in Rule 1. 
 

Rule 1: 

i) C(B/F) + I(F) + E(F) + K(F) 
ii) E = the nearest Na/Nb/Nc/Nh after I in F 

iii) C = the nearest (N)+(V)+(N) before I in F/B  
 

Rule 1 indicates that the experiencer (E) appears to 

be the nearest Na (common noun)/ Nb (proper 

noun)/ Nc (place noun)/ Nh (pronoun) after Group 

I cue words in the focus clause (F), while, at the 

same time, it comes before the keyword (K). Be-

sides, the cause (C) comes before Group I cue 

words. We simplify the proposition as a structure 

of (N)+(V)+(N), which is very likely to contain the 

cause event. Theoretically, in identifying C, we 

should first look for the nearest verb occurring be-

fore Group I cue words in the focus sentence (F) or 

the clause before the focus clause (B), and consider 

this verb as an anchor. From this verb, we search to 

the left for the nearest noun, and consider it as the 

subject; we then search to the right for the nearest 

noun until the presence of the cue words, and con-

sider it as the object. The detected subject, verb, 

and object form the cause event. In most cases, the 

experiencer is covertly expressed. It is, however, 

difficult to detect such causes in practice as causes 

may contain no verbs, and the two arguments are 

optional. Therefore, we take the clause instead of 

the structure of (N)+(V)+(N) as the actual cause. 

Examples are given in (7) and (8). For both sen-

tences, the clause that comes before the cue word 

is taken as the cause event of the emotion in ques-

tion.

Table 4 summarizes the generalized rules for de-

tecting the cause events of the five primary emo-

tions in Chinese. We identify two sets of rules: 1) 

the specific rules that apply to all emotional in-

stances (i.e. rules 1-13); 2) the general rules that 

apply to the emotional instances in which causes 

are not found after applying the specific set of 

rules (i.e. rules 14 and 15).

Constraints are set to each rule to filter out incor-

rect causes. For instances, in Rule 1, the emotion 

keyword cannot be followed by the words de “pos-

session”/ deshi4 “is that”/ shi4 “is” since it is very 

likely to have the cause event occurring after such 

words; in Rule 2, the cue word in III yuo3 “to ex-

ist” is excluded as it causes noises; whereas for 

Rule 4, it only applies to instances containing 

keywords of happiness, fear, and surprise.

5.1 Evaluation Metrics 

An evaluation scheme is designed to assess the 

ability to extract the cause of an emotion in context. 

We specifically look into two phases of the per-

formance of such a cause recognition system. 

Phase 1 assesses the detection of an emotion co-

occurrence with a cause; Phrase 2 evaluates the 

recognition of the cause texts for an emotion. 

 

Overall Evaluation:  
The definitions of related metrics are presented in 

Figure 2. For each emotion in a sentence, if neither 

the gold-standard file nor the system file has a 

cause, both precision and recall score 1; otherwise, 

precision and recall are calculated by the scoring 

method ScoreForTwoListOfCauses. As an emotion 

may have more than one cause, ScoreForTwoLis-

tOfCauses calculates the overlap scores between 

two lists of cause texts. Since emotion cause rec-

ognition is rather complicated, two relaxed string 

match scoring methods are selected to compare 

two cause texts, ScoreForTwoStrings: Relaxed 

Match 1 uses the minimal overlap between the 

gold-standard cause and the system cause. The sys-

tem cause is considered as correct provided that 

there is at least one overlapping Chinese character; 

Relaxed Match 2 is more rigid which takes into 

account the overlap text length during scoring.

Phase 1: The Detection of Cause Occurrence 
The detection of cause occurrence is considered a 

preliminary task for emotion cause recognition and 

is compounded by the fact that neutral sentences 

are difficult to detect, as observed in Tokuhisa et al. 

(2008). For Phase 1, each emotion keyword in a 

sentence has a binary tag: Y (i.e. with a cause) or 

N (without a cause). Similar to other NLP tasks, 

we adopt the common evaluation metrics, i.e. accu-

racy, precision, recall, and F score. 
 

Phase 2: The Detection of Causes 
The evaluation in Phase 2 is limited to the emotion 

keywords with a cause either in the gold-standard 

file or in the system file. The performance is calcu-

lated as in Overall Evaluation scheme. 

 

 
 

5.2 Results and Discussion 

We use 80% sentences as the development data, 

and 20% as the test data. The baseline is designed 

as follows: find a verb to the left of the keyword in 

question, and consider the clause containing the 

verb as a cause.  

Table 5 shows the performances of the overall 

evaluation. We find that the overall performances 

of our system have significantly improved using 

Relaxed Match 1 and Relaxed Match 2 by 19% 

and 19% respectively. Although the overall per-

formance of our system (47.95% F-score for Re-

laxed Match 1 and 41.67% for Relaxed Match 2) is 

not yet very high, it marks a good start for emotion

cause detection and extraction. 

Table 6 and 7 show the performances of the 

baseline and our rule-based system in Phase 1. Ta-

ble 6 shows the overall accuracy, and Table 7 

shows the detailed performances. In Table 6, we 

find that our system and the baseline have similar 

high accuracy scores. Yet Table 7 shows that both 

systems achieve a high performance for emotions 

with a cause, but much worse for emotions without 

a cause. It is important to note that even though the 

naive baseline system has comparably high per-

formance with our rule-based system in judging 

whether there is a cause in context, this result is 

biased by two facts. First, as the corpus contains 

more than 80% of sentences with emotion, a sys-

tem which is biased toward detecting a cause, such 

as the baseline system, naturally performs well. In 

addition, once the actual cause is examined, we can 

see that the baseline actually detects a lot of false 

positives in the sense that the cause it identifies is 

only correct in 4.39%. Our rule-based system 

shows great promise in being able to deal with 

neutral sentences effectively and being able to 

detect the correct cause at least three times more 

often than the baseline.  

Table 8 shows the performances in Phase 2. 

Comparing to the baseline, we find that our rules 

improve the performance of cause recognition us-

ing Relaxed Match 1 and 2 scoring by 21% and 

21% respectively. On the one hand, the 7% gap in 

F-score between Relaxed Match 1 and 2 also indi-

cates that our rules can effectively locate the clause 

of a cause. On the other hand, the rather low per-

formances of the baseline show that most causes 

recognized by the baseline are wrong although the 

baseline effectively detects the cause occurrence, 

as indicated in Table 7. In addition, we check the 

accuracy (precision) and contribution (recall) of 

each rule. In descending order, the top four accu-

rate rules are: Rules 7, 10, 11, and 1; and the top 

four contributive rules are: Rules 2, 15, 14, and 3.  

6 Conclusion  

Emotion processing has been a great challenge in 

NLP. Given the fact that an emotion is often trig-

gered by cause events and that cause events are 

integral parts of emotion, we propose a linguistic-

driven rule-based system for emotion cause detec-

tion, which is proven to be effective. In particular, 

we construct a Chinese emotion cause corpus an-

notated with emotions and the corresponding cause 

events. Since manual detection of cause events is 

labor-intensive and time-consuming, we intend to 

use the emotion cause corpus to produce automatic 

extraction system for emotion cause events with 

machine learning methods. We believe that our 

rule-based system is useful for many real world 

applications. For instance, the information regard-

ing causal relations of emotions is important for 

product design, political evaluation, etc. Such a 

system also shed light on emotion processing as 

the detected emotion cause events can serve as 

clues for the identification of implicit emotions.
