Abstract

The 2013 Association for Computational
Linguistics MultiLing Pilot posed a task
to measure the performance of multi-
lingual, single-document, summarization
systems using a dataset derived from many
Wikipedias. The objective of the pilot
was to assess automatic summarization of
multilingual text documents outside the
news domain and the potential of using
Wikipedia articles for such research. This
report describes the pilot task, the dataset,
the methods used to evaluate the submitted
summaries, and the overall performance of
each participant’s system.

1 Introduction

Document summarization is an active subject of
research and development. The ACM Digital Li-
brary has about 806 reports on the subject pub-
lished since 1993, with over half of them appear-
ing in the last five years. While the impetus for
much of this research is the annual Text Anal-
ysis Conference (TAC) workshop on document
summarization, there is a growing demand in the
consumer market for news summarization appli-
cations being met by tablet and smart-phone ap-
plications such as Clipped1, Summoner2, TLDR3,
and Yahoo News. Yahoo and Google even ac-
quired two companies developing such applica-
tions, Summly (Stelter, 2013) and Wavii (Tsotsis,
2013) respectively, earlier this year. While sum-
marization technology for news sources is com-
ing to fruition, the performance of such technol-
ogy on non-English documents outside the news
domain has not been throughly assessed and may
need further research. Since the datasets used by

3http://goo.gl/qEgCs

the TAC summarization workshops have predom-
inately been English news articles, with some ex-
ceptions (Giannakopoulos et al., 2011), the objec-
tive of the 2013 ACL MultiLing Pilot was to assess
the performance of automatic multilingual single-
document summarization systems on non-English
text outside the news domain and to determine the
potential of using Wikipedia articles for such re-
search.

This report starts with a description of the task
and dataset, the methods used to evaluate the sub-
mitted summaries, the performance of each partic-
ipating system, and concludes with an assessment
of the pilot and potential future work.

2 Task and Dataset Description

The objective of each participant system of the pi-
lot was simple: compute a summary for each doc-
ument in at least two of the datasets languages.
No restrictions were placed on the languages that
could be chosen nor was any target summary size
specified.

The dataset was derived from a corpus cre-
ated in 2010 to measure the performance of the
CLASSY (Conroy et al., 2009) summarization al-
gorithm on non-English documents outside the
news domain. At the time such a corpus did not
exist so one was created from the Wikipedias.
To date there are Wikipedias in 285 languages
comprising over 75 million pages. Some of the
Wikipedias maintain a list of Feature Articles,
which are articles reviewed and voted upon by ed-
itors as the best that fulfill Wikipedia’s require-
ments in accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and
style. One such requirement is that the article have
a lead section that should

. . . be able to stand alone as a concise
overview. It should . . . summarize the
most important points . . . [and] material
in the lead should roughly reflect its im-

29



portance to the topic . . . 4

So the lead section of a featured article is
an excellent summary of it, hence, the fea-
tured articles were used to create the corpus.
In 2010 there were 41 Wikipedias with more
than nine featured articles. The Perl module
Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia5 was de-
veloped to automatically create the corpus from
the featured articles of those Wikipedias. The cor-
pus is publicly available (Kubina, 2010) and the
Perl module can be used to create an updated cor-
pus.

The dataset for the pilot was created from a
subset of the 2010 corpus. This was done to en-
sure that each language had 30 articles and that
the size of each article’s body text was sufficiently
large. First, for each article the summary and body
were compressed to approximate their informa-
tion content size. For example, given a Chinese
and English article with the same character length
the Chinese article will usually contain more in-
formation than an English article and their com-
pressed sizes will approximation their true infor-
mation content. Next, if the compressed body
size of an article was less than five times its com-
pressed summary size, then the article was dis-
carded. The factor of five was simply chosen to
ensure the body of each article was sufficiently
large relative to the summary size. For each lan-
guage the median of the ratio of compressed body
size to compressed summary size was computed
and only the 30 articles closest to the median were
included in the dataset. This filtering reduced the
corpus from 12, 819 articles in 41 languages to the
dataset containing 1, 200 articles in 40 languages.
For each language in the dataset Table 1 contains
the mean size of the articles, their bodies, and their
summaries, in characters.

3 Evaluation Methods and Results

Four teams submitted the results of six summa-
rization systems. The teams are denoted by AIS,
LAN, MD, and MUS; the MD team submitted
three systems. Throughout this report the systems
are denoted by AIS, LAN, MD1, MD2, MD3, and
MUS. Table 2 contains the list of languages sub-
mitted for each system and the mean size, in char-
acters, of the summaries submitted.

5http://goo.gl/ySgOS

For the evaluation a baseline summary was ex-
tracted from the each article in the dataset that is
the prefix substring of the article’s body text with
the same length as the text in the lead section of
the article. For the remainder of this report the
lead section of an article is called the human sum-
mary. An oracle summary was also computed for
each article by heuristically extracting sentences
from its body text to maximize its ROUGE-2 score
against the human summary until its size exceeded
the human summary, upon which it was truncated.

Submitted summaries were automatically eval-
uated against the human summary of each arti-
cle using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 (Lin, 2004) and
MeMoG (Giannakopoulos et al., 2008). For
ROUGE, the languages Chinese, Japanese, Ko-
rean, and Thai were tokenized into individual
characters. For MeMoG the character n-gram size
used for each language is listed in Table 3, which
is the n-gram size that maximized the standard de-
viation divided by the mean of the n-gram fre-
quency distribution of the language in the dataset.
So the selected n-gram size maximizes the vari-
ability of the distribution values relative to their
mean. A shorter n-gram size would inflate the
MeMoG scores because of their inherent frequent
co-occurrence and conversely a longer size would
penalize MeMoG scores due to their infrequent
co-occurrence.

Each scoring method was performed twice, first
by truncating, if necessary, each system summary
to the size of the human summary, which is called
HSS-scoring. The second set of scores were com-
puted by truncating all the summaries of an ar-
ticle, including the human summary, to the size
of the shortest summary amongst the system and
human summaries for the article, which is called
SSS-scoring. For HSS-scoring the system sum-
maries shorter that the human summary are penal-
ized since ROUGE is recall oriented. Alternately,
SSS-scoring gives preference to shorter system
summaries that have their best content (extracted
sentences) first.

The performance for HSS-scoring of the sys-
tems on the seven languages that at least two teams
submitted summaries for are given in Figures 1, 2,
and 3. Table 4 gives an overview of how often sig-
nificant differences in each of the three automatic
metrics was observed. In particular, the last row
gives the fraction of times that an non-parametric
analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the

medians of the system scores were not the same,
using a rejection threshold of 0.05. Also, the frac-
tion of time that each system significantly outper-
formed the lead baseline is also recorded. A paired
Wilcoxon test was invoked whenever the ANOVA
indicated a significant difference was present, with
a threshold of 0.05.

Lastly, each systems performance for SSS-

scoring is provided in Figures 4, 5, and 6. Sur-
prisingly, the results change little. Lastly Table 5
contains the number of times that each system beat
the baseline summary with a 95% confidence mea-
sured as a result of the non-parametric ANOVA
and the Wilcoxon paired sign rank test. The results
show that the number of significant differences go
down for ROUGE scores and up for MeMoG.

4 Summary

Overall, the authors believe the pilot was success-
ful in that it exposed researchers to the poten-
tial for using Wikipedia articles for summarization
research and demonstrated that generating sum-
maries for the genre of Wikipedia articles is a more
challenging task than newswire documents. No-
tably, no system outperformed the baseline for En-
glish! In hindsight this is not too surprising since
news articles have a prose style6 significantly dif-
ferent from Wikipedia articles7. Wikipedia arti-
cles are written as expositions having a topical
flow that can vary significantly between sections
but news articles are written in a style8 that ad-
dresses the most important information first—the

who, what, when, where and why—with the sub-
sequent text providing more details. Hence news
articles have a more even topical flow. The authors
hope these results stimulate research and devel-
opment of summarization algorithms outside the
news domain.

As for the metrics, ROUGE-1 observed the
most significant differences among the systems
and MeMoG observed the least as measured by
a non-parametric ANOVA. However, a human
evaluation of the summaries generated would be
needed to detemine which of the automatic metrics
is best at predicting significant differences among
systems for such data.
