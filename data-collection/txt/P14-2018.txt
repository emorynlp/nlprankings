Abstract

Manually constructing a Wordnet is a dif-
ficult task, needing years of experts’ time.
As a first step to automatically construct
full Wordnets, we propose approaches to
generate Wordnet synsets for languages
both resource-rich and resource-poor, us-
ing publicly available Wordnets, a ma-
chine translator and/or a single bilin-
gual dictionary. Our algorithms translate
synsets of existing Wordnets to a target
language T, then apply a ranking method
on the translation candidates to find best
translations in T. Our approaches are ap-
plicable to any language which has at least
one existing bilingual dictionary translat-
ing from English to it.

1 Introduction

Wordnets are intricate and substantive reposito-
ries of lexical knowledge and have become im-
portant resources for computational processing of
natural languages and for information retrieval.
Good quality Wordnets are available only for a
few "resource-rich" languages such as English and
Japanese. Published approaches to automatically
build new Wordnets are manual or semi-automatic
and can be used only for languages that already
possess some lexical resources.

The Princeton Wordnet (PWN) (Fellbaum,
1998) was painstakingly constructed manually
over many decades. Wordnets, except the PWN,
have been usually constructed by one of two ap-
proaches. The first approach translates the PWN
to T (Bilgin et al., 2004), (Barbu and Mititelu,
2005), (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006), (Sagot and
Fišer, 2008), (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) and
(Oliver and Climent, 2012); while the second ap-
proach builds a Wordnet in T, and then aligns
it with the PWN by generating translations (Gu-

nawan and Saputra, 2010). In terms of popular-
ity, the first approach dominates over the second
approach. Wordnets generated using the second
approach have different structures from the PWN;
however, the complex agglutinative morphology,
culture specific meanings and usages of words and
phrases of target languages can be maintained. In
contrast, Wordnets created using the first approach
have the same structure as the PWN.

One of our goals is to automatically gener-
ate high quality synsets, each of which is a set
of cognitive synonyms, for Wordnets having the
same structure as the PWN in several languages.
Therefore, we use the first approach to construct
Wordnets. This paper discusses the first step of a
project to automatically build core Wordnets for
languages with low amounts of resources (viz.,
Arabic and Vietnamese), resource-poor languages
(viz., Assamese) or endangered languages (viz.,
Dimasa and Karbi)1. The sizes and the qualities
of freely existing resources, if any, for these lan-
guages vary, but are not usually high. Hence, our
second goal is to use a limited number of freely
available resources in the target languages as in-
put to our algorithms to ensure that our methods
can be felicitously used with languages that lack
much resource. In addition, our approaches need
to have a capability to reduce noise coming from
the existing resources that we use. For transla-
tion, we use a free machine translator (MT) and
restrict ourselves to using it as the only "dictio-
nary" we can have. For research purposes, we have
obtained free access to the Microsoft Translator,
which supports translations among 44 languages.
In particular, given public Wordnets aligned to the
PWN ( such as the FinnWordNet (FWN) (Lindén,
2010) and the JapaneseWordNet (JWN) (Isahara et
al., 2008) ) and the Microsoft Translator, we build
Wordnet synsets for arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie.

1ISO 693-3 codes of Arabic, Assamese, Dimasa, Karbi
and Vietnamese are arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie, respectively.

2 Proposed approaches

In this section, we propose approaches to create
Wordnet synsets for a target languages T using ex-
isting Wordnets and the MT and/or a single bilin-
gual dictionary. We take advantage of the fact
that every synset in PWN has a unique offset-POS,
referring to the offset for a synset with a partic-
ular part-of-speech (POS) from the beginning of
its data file. Each synset may have one or more
words, each of which may be in one or more
synsets. Words in a synset have the same sense.
The basic idea is to extract corresponding synsets
for each offset-POS from existing Wordnets linked
to PWN, in several languages. Next, we translate
extracted synsets in each language to T to produce
so-called synset candidates using MT. Then, we
apply a ranking method on these candidates to find
the correct words for a specific offset-POS in T.

2.1 Generating synset candidates

We propose three approaches to generate synset
candidates for each offset-POS in T.

2.1.1 The direct translation (DR) approach

The first approach directly translates synsets in
PWN to T as in Figure 1.

Figure 1: The DR approach to construct Wordnet
synsets in a target language T.

For each offset-POS, we extract words in that
synset from the PWN and translate them to the tar-
get language to generate translation candidates.

2.1.2 Approach using intermediate Wordnets
(IW)

To handle ambiguities in synset translation, we
propose the IW approach as in Figure 2. Publicly
available Wordnets in various languages, which
we call intermediate Wordnets, are used as re-
sources to create synsets for Wordnets. For each
offset-POS, we extract its corresponding synsets
from intermediate Wordnets. Then, the extracted
synsets, which are in different languages, are
translated to T using MT to generate synset candi-
dates. Depending on which Wordnets are used and
the number of intermediate Wordnets, the num-
ber of candidates in each synset and the number
of synsets in the new Wordnets change.

Figure 2: The IW approach to construct Wordnet
synsets in a target language T

2.1.3 Approach using intermediate Wordnets
and a dictionary (IWND)

The IW approach for creating Wordnet synsets de-
creases ambiguities in translations. However, we
need more than one bilingual dictionary from each
intermediate languages to T. Such dictionaries are
not always available for many languages, espe-
cially the ones that are resource poor. The IWND
approach is like the IW approach, but instead of
translating immediately from the intermediate lan-
guages to the target language, we translate synsets
extracted from intermediate Wordnets to English
(eng), then translate them to the target language.
The IWND approach is presented in Figure 3.

net synsets

2.2 Ranking method
For each of offset-POS, we have many translation
candidates. A translation candidate with a higher
rank is more likely to become a word belonging to
the corresponding offset-POS of the new Wordnet
in the target language. Candidates having the same
ranks are treated similarly. The rank value in the
range 0.00 to 1.00. The rank of a word w, the so-
called rankw, is computed as below.

rankw = occurwnumCandidates ∗ numDstWordnetsnumWordnets
where:

- numCandidates is the total number of trans-
lation candidates of an offset-POS

- occurw is the occurrence count of the word w
in the numCandidates

- numWordnets is the number of intermediate
Wordnets used, and

- numDstWordnets is the number of distinct in-
termediate Wordnets that have words trans-
lated to the word w in the target language.

Our motivation for this rank formula is the fol-
lowing. If a candidate has a higher occurrence
count, it has a greater chance to become a cor-
rect translation. Therefore, the occurrence count
of each candidate needs to be taken into account.
We normalize the occurrence count of a word by
dividing it by numCandidates. In addition, if a
candidate is translated from different words hav-
ing the same sense in different languages, this can-
didate is more likely to be a correct translation.
Hence, we multiply the first fraction by numDst-
Wordnets. To normalize, we divide results by the
number of intermediate Wordnet used.

For instance, in our experiments we use 4 in-
termediate Wordnets, viz., PWN, FWN, JWN and
WOLF Wordnet (WWN) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008).
The words in the offset-POS "00006802-v" ob-
tained from all 4 Wordnets, their translations to
arb, the occurrence count and the rank of each
translation are presented in the second, the fourth
and the fifth columns, respectively, of Figure 4.
2.3 Selecting candidates based on ranks
We separate candidates based on three cases as be-
low.

Case 1: A candidate w has the highest chance
to become a correct word belonging to a specific
synset in the target language if its rank is 1.0. This
means that all intermediate Wordnets contain the
synset having a specific offset-POS and all words
belonging to these synsets are translated to the

Figure 4: Example of calculating the ranks of
candidates translated from words belonging to the
offset-POS "00006802-v" in 4 Wordnets: PWN,
FWN, JWN and WWN. The wordA, wordB and
wordC are obtained from PWN, FWN and WWN,
respectively. The JWN does not contain this offset-
POS. TL presents transliterations of the words in
arb. The numWordnets is 4 and the numCandi-
dates is 7. The rank of each candidate is shown in
the last column of Figure 4.

same word w. The more the number of intermedi-
ate Wordnets used, the higher the chance the can-
didate with the rank of 1.0 has to become the cor-
rect translation. Therefore, we accept all transla-
tions that satisfy this criterion. An example of this
scenario is presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Example of Case 1: Using the IW ap-
proach with four intermediate Wordnets, PWN,
FWN, JWN and WWN. All words belonging to
the offSet-POS "00952615-n" in all 4 Wordnets are
translated to the same word "điện" in vie. The
word "điện" is accepted as the correct word be-
longing to the offSet-POS "00952615-n" in the
Vietnamese Wordnet we create.

Case 2: If an offSet-POS does not have candi-
dates having the rank of 1.0, we accept the candi-
dates having the greatest rank. Figure 6 shows the
example of the second scenario.

Case 3: If all candidates of an offSet-POS has
the same rank which is also the greatest rank, we

Figure 6: Example of Case 2: Using the IW ap-
proach with three intermediate Wordnets, PWN,
FWN and WWN. For the offSet-POS "01437254-
v", there is no candidate with the rank of 1.0.
The highest rank of the candidates in "vie" is 0.67
which is the word gửi. We accept "gửi" as the cor-
rect word in the offSet-POS "01437254-v" in the
Vietnamese Wordnet we create.

skip these candidates. Table 1 gives an example of
the last scenario.

Wordnet Words Cand. Rank
PWN act hành động 0.33
PWN behave hoạt động 0.33
FWN do làm 0.33

Table 1: Example of Case 3: Using the DR ap-
proach. For the offSet-POS "00010435-v", there
is no candidate with the rank of 1.0. The highest
rank of the candidates in vie is 0.33. All of 3 can-
didates have the rank as same as the highest rank.
Therefore, we do not accept any candidate as the
correct word in the offSet-POS "00010435-v" in
the Vietnamese Wordnet we create.

3 Experiments

3.1 Publicly available Wordnets
The PWN is the oldest and the biggest available
Wordnet. It is also free. Wordnets in many
languages are being constructed and developed2.
However, only a few of these Wordnets are of high
quality and free for downloading. The EuroWord-
net (Vossen, 1998) is a multilingual database with
Wordnets in European languages (e.g., Dutch, Ital-
ian and Spanish). The AsianWordnet3 provides
a platform for building and sharing Wordnets for
Asian languages (e.g., Mongolian, Thai and Viet-
namese). Unfortunately, the progress in building
most of these Wordnets is slow and they are far
from being finished.

In our current experiments as mentioned ear-
lier, we use the PWN and other Wordnets linked
to the PWN 3.0 provided by the Open Multilingual
Wordnet4 project (Bond and Foster, 2013): WWN,
FWN and JWN. Table 2 provides some details of
the Wordnets used.

Wordnet Synsets Core
JWN 57,179 95%
FWN 116,763 100%
PWN 117,659 100%
WWN 59,091 92%

Table 2: The number of synsets in the Wordnets
linked to the PWN 3.0 are obtained from the Open
Multilingual Wordnet, along with the percentage
of synsets covered from the semi-automatically
compiled list of 5,000 "core" word senses in PWN.
Note that synsets which are not linked to the PWN
are not taken into account.

For languages not supported by MT, we use
three additional bilingual dictionaries: two dictio-
naries Dict(eng,ajz) and Dict(eng,dis) provided by
Xobdo5; one Dict(eng,asm) created by integrat-
ing two dictionaries Dict(eng,asm) provided by
Xobdo and Panlex6. The dictionaries are of vary-
ing qualities and sizes. The total number of entries
in Dict(eng,ajz), Dict(eng,asm) and Dict(eng,dis)
are 4682, 76634 and 6628, respectively.

3.2 Experimental results and discussion

As previously mentioned, our primary goal is to
build high quality synsets for Wordnets in lan-
guages with low amount of resources: ajz, asm,
arb, dis and vie. The number of Wordnet synsets
we create for arb and vie using the DR approach
and the coverage percentage compared to the
PWN synsets are 4813 (4.10%) and 2983 (2.54%),
respectively. The number of synsets for each
Wordnet we create using the IW approach with
different numbers of intermediate Wordnets and
the coverage percentage compared to the PWN
synsets are presented in Table 3.

For the IWND approach, we use all 4 Wordnets
as intermediate resources. The number of Wordnet
synsets we create using the IWND approach are
presented in Table 4. We only construct Wordnet
synsets for ajz, asm and dis using the IWND ap-

Finally, we combine all of the Wordnet synsets
we create using different approaches to generate
the final Wordnet synsets. Table 5 presents the fi-
nal number of Wordnet synsets we create and their
coverage percentage.

vie 98,210 83.47%

Table 5: The number and the average score of
Wordnets synsets we create.

Evaluations were performed by volunteers who
use the language of the Wordnet as mother tongue.
To achieve reliable judgment, we use the same
set of 500 offSet-POSs, randomly chosen from the
synsets we create. Each volunteer was requested
to evaluate using a 5-point scale – 5: excellent, 4:
good, 3: average, 2: fair and 1: bad. The aver-
age score of Wordnet synsets for arb, asm and vie
are 3.82, 3.78 and 3.75, respectively. We notice
that the Wordnet synsets generated using the IW
approach with all 4 intermediate Wordnets have
the highest average score: 4.16/5.00 for arb and

4.26/5.00 for vie. We are in the process of finding
volunteers to evaluate the Wordnet synsets for ajz
and dis.

It is difficult to compare Wordnets because the
languages involved in different papers are differ-
ent, the number and quality of input resources vary
and the evaluation methods are not standard. How-
ever, for the sake of completeness, we make an at-
tempt at comparing our results with published pa-
pers. Although our score is not in terms of percent-
age, we obtain the average score of 3.78/5.00 (or
informally and possibly incorrectly, 75.60% preci-
sion) which we believe it is better than 55.30% ob-
tained by (Bond et al., 2008) and 43.20% obtained
by (Charoenporn et al., 2008). In addition, the av-
erage coverage percentage of all Wordnet synsets
we create is 44.85% which is better than 12% in
(Charoenporn et al., 2008) and 33276 synsets ('
28.28%) in (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) .

The previous studies need more than one dic-
tionary to translate between a target language
and intermediate-helper languages. For exam-
ple, to create the JWN, (Bond et al., 2008) needs
the Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, Japanese-
English lexicon and Japanese-English life sci-
ence dictionary. For asm, there are a number
of Dict(eng,asm); to the best of our knowledge
only two online dictionaries, both between eng
and asm, are available. The IWND approach re-
quires only one input dictionary between a pair of
languages. This is a strength of our method.

4 Conclusion and future work

We present approaches to create Wordnet synsets
for languages using available Wordnets, a public
MT and a single bilingual dictionary. We create
Wordnet synsets with good accuracy and high cov-
erage for languages with low resources (arb and
vie), resource-poor (asm) and endangered (ajz and
dis). We believe that our work has the potential
to construct full Wordnets for languages which do
not have many existing resources. We are in the
process of creating a Website where all Wordnet
synsets we create will be available, along with a
user friendly interface to give feedback on individ-
ual entries. We will solicit feedback from commu-
nities that use these languages as mother-tongue.
Our goal is to use this feedback to improve the
quality of the Wordnet synsets. Some of Word-
net synsets we created can be downloaded from
http://cs.uccs.edu/∼linclab/projects.html.
