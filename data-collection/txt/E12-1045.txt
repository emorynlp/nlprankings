Abstract

In this paper, we address statistical ma-
chine translation of public conference talks.
Modeling the style of this genre can be very
challenging given the shortage of available
in-domain training data. We investigate the
use of a hybrid LM, where infrequent words
are mapped into classes. Hybrid LMs are
used to complement word-based LMs with
statistics about the language style of the
talks. Extensive experiments comparing
different settings of the hybrid LM are re-
ported on publicly available benchmarks
based on TED talks, from Arabic to English
and from English to French. The proposed
models show to better exploit in-domain
data than conventional word-based LMs for
the target language modeling component of
a phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion system.

1 Introduction

The translation of TED conference talks1 is an
emerging task in the statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) community (Federico et al., 2011).
The variety of topics covered by the speeches, as
well as their specific language style, make this a
very challenging problem.

Fixed expressions, colloquial terms, figures of
speech and other phenomena recurrent in the talks
should be properly modeled to produce transla-
tions that are not only fluent but that also em-
ploy the right register. In this paper, we propose
a language modeling technique that leverages in-
domain training data for style adaptation.

Hybrid class-based LMs are trained on text
where only infrequent words are mapped to Part-
of-Speech (POS) classes. In this way, topic-
specific words are discarded and the model fo-
cuses on generic words that we assume more use-
ful to characterize the language style. The factor-
ization of similar expressions made possible by
this mixed text representation yields a better n-
gram coverage, but with a much higher discrimi-
native power than POS-level LMs.

Hybrid LM also differs from POS-level LM in
that it uses a word-to-class mapping to determine
POS tags. Consequently, it doesn’t require the de-
coding overload of factored models nor the tag-
ging of all parallel data used to build phrase ta-
bles. A hybrid LM trained on in-domain data can
thus be easily added to an existing baseline sys-
tem trained on large amounts of background data.

The proposed models are used in addition to
standard word-based LMs, in the framework of
log-linear phrase-based SMT.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. After discussing the language style adapta-
tion problem, we will give an overview of relevant
work. In the following sections we will describe
in detail hybrid LM and its possible variants. Fi-
nally, we will present an empirical analysis of the
proposed technique, including intrinsic evaluation
and SMT experiments.

2 Background

Our working scenario is the translation of TED
talks transcripts as proposed by the IWSLT Eval-
uation Campaign2. This genre covers a variety
of topics ranging from business to psychology.

monolingual – consists of a rather small collection
of TED talks plus a variety of large out-of-domain
corpora, such as news stories and UN proceed-
ings.

Given the diversity of topics, the in-domain
data alone cannot ensure sufficient coverage to an
SMT system. The addition of background data
can certainly improve the n-gram coverage and
thus the fluency of our translations, but it may also
move our system towards an unsuitable language
style, such as that of written news.

In our study, we focus on the subproblem of
target language modeling and consider two En-
glish text collections, namely the in-domain TED
and the out-of-domain NEWS3, summarized in
Table 2. Because of its larger size – two orders
of magnitude – the NEWS corpus can provide a
better LM coverage than the TED on the test data.
This is reflected both on perplexity and on the av-
erage length of the context (or history h) actually

used by these two LMs to score the test’s refer-
ence translations. Note that the latter measure is
bounded at the LM order minus one, and is in-
versely proportional to the number of back-offs
performed by the model. Hence, we use this value
to estimate how well an n-gram LM fits the test
data. Indeed, despite the genre mismatch, the per-
plexity of a NEWS 5-gram LM on the TED-2010
test reference translations is 104 versus 112 for
the in-domain LM, and the average history size is
2.5 versus 1.7 words.

Yet we observe that the style of public speeches
is much better represented in the in-domain cor-
pus than in the out-of-domain one. For instance,
let us consider the vocabulary distribution4 of the

two corpora (Table 3). The very first forms, as
ranked by frequency, are quite similar in the two
corpora. However, there are important excep-
tions: the pronouns I and you are among the top
20 frequent forms in the TED, while in the NEWS
they are ranked only 40th and 64th respectively.
Other interesting cases are the words actually,
stuff, guy and amazing, all ranked about 10 times
higher in the TED than in the NEWS corpus.

We can also analyze the most typical ways
to start and end a sentence in the two text col-
lections. As shown in Table 1, the frequency
ranking of sentence-initial and sentence-final 5-
grams in the in-domain corpus is notably different
from the out-of-domain one. TED’s most frequent
sentence-initial 5-gram “[s] Thank you . [/s] ” is
not at all attested in the NEWS corpus. As for
the 4th most common sentence start “[s] And I
said ,” is only ranked 8199th in the NEWS, and
so on. Notably, the top ranked NEWS 5-grams in-
clude names of cities (Washington, New York) and
of news agency (AP, Reuters). As regards sen-
tence endings, we observe similar contrasts: for
instance, the word sequence “and so on . [/s] ”
is ranked 4th in the TED and 157th in the NEWS
while “, you know . [/s] ” is 5th in the TED and
only 1652th in the NEWS.

These figures confirm that the talks have a spe-
cific language style, remarkably different from
that of the written news genre. In summary, talks
are characterized by a massive use of first and sec-
ond persons, by shorter sentences, and by more
colloquial lexical and syntactic constructions.

3 Related Work

The brittleness of n-gram LMs in case of mis-
match between training and task data is a well
known issue (Rosenfeld, 2000). So called do-
main adaptation methods (Bellegarda, 2004) can
improve the situation, once a limited amount
of task specific data become available. Ideally,
domain-adaptive LMs aim to improve model ro-
bustness under changing conditions, involving
possible variations in vocabulary, syntax, content,
and style. Most of the known LM adaption tech-
niques (Bellegarda, 2004), however, address all
these variations in a holistic way. A possible rea-
son for this is that LM adaptation methods were
originally developed under the automatic speech
recognition framework, which typically assumes
the presence of one single LM. The progressive

adoption of the log-linear modeling framework in
many NLP tasks has recently introduced the use
of multiple LM components (features), which per-
mit to naturally factor out and integrate different
aspects of language into one model. In SMT, the
factored model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007), for in-
stance, permits to better tailor the LM to the task
syntax, by complementing word-based n-grams
with a part-of-speech (POS) LM , that can be es-
timated even on a limited amount of task-specific
data. Besides many works addressing holistic LM
domain adaptation for SMT, e.g. Foster and Kuhn
(2007), recently methods were also proposed to
explicitly adapt the LM to the discourse topic of a
talk (Ruiz and Federico, 2011). Our work makes
another step in this direction by investigating hy-
brid LMs that try to explicitly represent the speak-
ing style of the talk genre. As a difference from
standard class-based LMs (Brown et al., 1992) or
the more recent local LMs (Monz, 2011), which
are used to predict sequences of classes or word-
class pairs, our hybrid LM is devised to pre-
dict sequences of classes interleaved by words.
While we do not claim any technical novelty in
the model itself, to our knowledge a deep investi-
gation of hybrid LMs for the sake of style adap-
tation is definitely new. Finally, the term hybrid
LM was inspired by Yazgan and Saraçlar (2004),
which called with this name a LM predicting se-
quences of words and sub-words units, devised to
let a speech recognizer detect out-of-vocabulary-
words.

4 Hybrid Language Model

Hybrid LMs are n-gram models trained on a
mixed text representation where each word is ei-
ther mapped to a class or left as is. This choice
is made according to a measure of word common-
ness and is univocal for each word type.

The rationale is to discard topic-specific words,
while preserving those words that best character-
ize the language style (note that word frequency
is computed on the in-domain corpus only). Map-
ping non-frequent terms to classes naturally leads
to a shorter tail in the frequency distribution, as
visualized by Figure 1. A model trained on such
data has a better n-gram coverage of the test set
and may take advantage of a larger context when
scoring translation hypotheses.

As classes, we use deterministically assigned
POS tags, obtained by first tagging the data with

TED corpus before and after POS-mapping of words

rank in the frequency list (x-axis) is plotted against the
respective frequency in logarithmic scale. Types with
less than 20 occurrences are omitted from the graph.

Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) and then choosing
the most likely tag for each word type. In this
way, we avoid the overload of searching for the
best tagging decisions at run-time at the cost of
a slightly higher imprecision (see Section 5.1).
The hybridly mapped data is used to train a high-
order n-gram LM that is plugged into an SMT de-
coder as an additional feature on target word se-
quences. During the translation process, words
are mapped to their class just before querying the
hybrid LM, therefore translation models can be
trained on plain un-tagged data.

As exemplified in Table 4, hybrid LMs can
draw useful statistics on the context of common
words even from a small corpus such as the TED.
To have an idea of data sparseness, consider that
in the unprocessed TED corpus the most frequent
5-gram containing the common word guy occurs
only 3 times. After the mapping of words with
frequency <500, the highest 5-gram frequency
grows to 17, the second one to 9, and so on.

4.1 Word commonness criteria
The most intuitive way to measure word common-
ness is by absolute term frequency (F ). We will
use this criterion in most of our experiments. A
finer solution would be to also consider the com-
monness of a word across different talks. At this
end, we propose to use the fdf statistics, that is the
product of relative term f requency and document
f requency5:

fdfw =
c(w)∑
w′ c(w′)

× c(dw)
c(d)

where dw are the documents (talks) containing at
least one occurrence of the word w.

If available, real talk boundaries can be used
to define the documents. Alternatively, we can
simply split the corpus into chunks of fixed size.
In this work we use this approximation.

Another issue is how to set the threshold. In-
dependently from the chosen commonness mea-
sure, we can reason in terms of the ratio of tokens
that are mapped to POS classes (WP ). For in-
stance, in our experiments with English, we can
set the threshold to F=500 and observe that WP
corresponds to 25% of the tokens (and 99% of the
types). In the same corpus, a similar ratio is ob-
tained with fdf =0.012.

In our study, we consider three ratios WP ={.25,
.50, .75} that correspond to different levels of lan-
guage modeling: from a domain-generic word-
level LM to a lexically anchored POS-level LM.

4.2 Handling morphology
Token frequency-based measures may not be suit-
able for languages other than English. When
translating into French, for instance, we have to
deal with a much richer morphology.

As a solution we can use lemmas, univocally
assigned to word types in the same manner as
POS tags. Lemmas can be employed in two ways:
only for word selection, as a frequency measure,
or also for word representation, as a mapping for
common words. In the former, we preserve in-
flected variants that may be useful to model the
language style, but we also risk to see n-gram cov-
erage decrease due to the presence of rare types.
In the latter, only canonical forms and POS tags

5This differs from the tf-idf widely used in information
retrieval, which is used to measure the relevance of a term in
a document. Instead, we measure commonness of a term in
the whole corpus.

appear in the processed text, thus introducing a
further level of abstraction from the original text.

Here follows a TED sentence in its original
version (first line) and after three different hy-
brid mappings – namely WP =.25, WP =.25 with
lemma forms, and WP =.50:

Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right.

Now you VB , but that NN has kind of a NN to it, right.
Now you VB , but that NN have kind of a NN to it, right.

5 Evaluation

In this section we perform an intrinsic evaluation
of the proposed LM technique, then we measure
its impact on translation quality when integrated
into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system.

5.1 Intrinsic evaluation

We analyze here a set of hybrid LMs trained on
the English TED corpus by varying the ratio of
POS-mapped words and the word representation
technique (word vs lemma). All models were
trained with the IRSTLM toolkit (Federico et al.,
2008), using a very high n-gram order (10) and
Witten-Bell smoothing.

First, we estimate an upper bound of the POS
tagging errors introduced by deterministic tag-
ging. At this end, the hybridly mapped data is
compared with the actual output of Tree Tagger on
the TED training corpus (see Table 5). Naturally,
the impact of tagging errors correlates with the ra-
tio of POS-mapped tokens, as no error is counted
on non-mapped tokens. For instance, we note that
the POS error rate is only 1.9% in our primary set-
ting, WP =.25 and word representation, whereas
on a fully POS-mapped text it is 6.6%. Note that
the English tag set used by Tree Tagger includes
43 classes.

Now we focus on the main goal of hybrid text
representation, namely increasing the coverage of
the in-domain LM on the test data. Here too, we
measure coverage by the average length of word
history h used to score the test reference transla-
tions (see Section 2). We do not provide perplex-
ity figures, since these are not directly compara-
ble across models with different vocabularies. As
shown by Table 5, n-gram coverage increases with
the ratio of POS-mapped tokens, ranging from 1.7
on an all-words LM to 4.4 on an all-POS LM. Of

Hybrid 10g LM |V | POS-Err h10g

lary size, POS error rate, and average word history on

course, the more words are mapped, the less dis-
criminative our model will be. Thus, choosing the
best hybrid mapping means finding the best trade-
off between coverage and informativeness.

We also applied hybrid LM to the French lan-
guage, again using Tree Tagger to create the POS
mapping. The tag set in this case comprises 34
classes and the POS error rate with WP =.25 is
1.2% (compare with 1.9% in English). As previ-
ously discussed, morphology has a notable effect
on the modeling of French. In fact, the vocabu-
lary reduction obtained by mapping all the words
to their most probable lemma is -45% (57959 to
31908 types in the TED corpus), while in English
it is only -25%.

5.2 SMT baseline
Our SMT experiments address the translation of
TED talks from Arabic to English and from En-
glish to French. The training and test datasets
were provided by the organizers of the IWSLT11
evaluation, and are summarized in Table 6.
Marked in bold are the corpora used for hybrid
LM training. Dev and test sets have a single ref-
erence translation.

For both language pairs, we set up com-
petitive phrase-based systems6 using the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). The decoder fea-
tures a statistical log-linear model including a
phrase translation model and a phrase reordering
model (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn et al., 2005), two
word-based language models, distortion, word
and phrase penalties. The translation and re-
ordering models are obtained by combining mod-
els independently trained on the available paral-

scribed in (Ruiz et al., 2011).

lel corpora: namely TED and NEWS for Arabic-
English; TED, NEWS and UN for English-
French. To this end we applied the fill-up method
(Nakov, 2008; Bisazza et al., 2011) in which out-
of-domain phrase tables are merged with the in-
domain table by adding only new phrase pairs.
Out-of-domain phrases are marked with a binary
feature whose weight is tuned together with the
SMT system weights.

For each target language, two standard 5-gram
LMs are trained separately on the monolingual
TED and NEWS datasets, and log-linearly com-
bined at decoding time. In the Arabic-English
task, we use a hierarchical reordering model (Gal-
ley and Manning, 2008; Hardmeier et al., 2011),
while in the English-French task we use a default
word-based bidirectional model. The distortion
limit is set to the default value of 6. Note that
the use of large n-gram LMs and of lexicalized
reordering models was shown to wipe out the im-
provement achievable by POS-level LM (Kirch-
hoff and Yang, 2005; Birch et al., 2007).

Concerning data preprocessing we apply stan-
dard tokenization to the English and French text,
while for Arabic we use an in-house tokenizer that
removes diacritics and normalizes special charac-
ters and digits. Arabic text is then segmented with
AMIRA (Diab et al., 2004) according to the ATB
scheme7. The Arabic-English system uses cased

junctions w+ and f+, prepositions l+, k+, b+, future marker

translation models, while the English-French sys-
tem uses lowercased models and a standard re-
casing post-process.

Feature weights are tuned on dev2010 by
means of a minimum error training procedure
(MERT) (Och, 2003). Following suggestions by
Clark et al. (2011) and Cettolo et al. (2011) on
controlling optimizer instability, we run MERT
four times on the same configuration and use the
average of the resulting weights to evaluate trans-
lation performance.

5.3 Hybrid LM integration

As previously stated, hybrid LMs are trained only
on in-domain data and are added to the log-linear
decoder as an additional target LM. To this end,
we use the class-based LM implementation pro-
vided in Moses and IRSTLM, which applies the
word-to-class mapping to translation hypotheses
before LM querying8. The order of the additional
LM is set to 10 in the Arabic-English evaluation
and 7 in the English-French, as these appeared to
be the best settings in preliminary tests.

Translation quality is measured by BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and
Lavie, 2005) and TER (Snover et al., 2006)9. To
test whether differences among systems are statis-
tically significant we use approximate randomiza-
tion as done in (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005)10.

Model variants. The effect on MT quality of
various hybrid LM variants is shown in Table 7.
Note that allPOS and allLemmas refer to deter-
ministically assigned POS tags and lemmas, re-
spectively. Concerning the ratio of POS-mapped
tokens, the best performing values are WP =.25 in
Arabic-English and WP =.50 in English-French.
These hybrid mappings outperform all the uni-
form representations (words, lemmas and POS)
with statistically significant BLEU and METEOR
improvements.

The fdf experiment involves the use of doc-
ument frequency for the selection of common
words. Its performance is very close to that of hy-

8Detailed instructions on how to build and use hybrid
LMs can be found at http://hlt.fbk.eu/people/bisazza.

9We use case-sensitive BLEU and TER, but case-
insensitive METEOR to enable the use of paraphrase tables
distributed with the tool (version 1.3).

puted with the Multeval toolkit (Clark et al., 2011):

brid LMs simply based on term frequency; only
METEOR gains 0.1 points in Arabic-English. A
possible reason for this is that document fre-
quency was computed on fixed-size text chunks
rather than on real document boundaries (see Sec-
tion 4.1). The lemmaF experiment refers to the
use of canonical forms for frequency measuring:
this technique does not seem to help in either lan-
guage pair. Finally, we compare the use of lem-
mas versus surface forms to represent common
words. As expected, lemmas appear to be help-
ful for French language modeling. Interestingly
this is also the case for English, even if by a small
margin (+0.2 METEOR, -0.1 TER).

Summing up, hybrid mapping appears as a
winning strategy compared to uniform map-
ping. Although differences among LM variants
are small, the best model in Arabic-English is
.25-POS/lemmas, which can be thought of as
a domain-generic lemma-level LM. In English-
French, instead, the highest scores are achieved
by .50-POS/lemmas or .50-POS/lemmas(fdf), that
is POS-level LM with few frequently occurring
lexical anchors (vocabulary size 59). An inter-
pretation of this result is that, for French, mod-
eling the syntax is more helpful than modeling
the style. We also suspect that the French TED
corpus is more irregular and diverse with respect
to the style, than its English counterpart. In fact,
while the English corpus include transcripts of
talks given by English speakers, the French one is
mostly a collection of (human) translations. Typi-
cal features of the speech style may have been lost
in this process.

Comparison with baseline. In Table 8 the
best performing hybrid LM is compared against
the baseline that only includes the standard LMs
described in Section 5.2. To complete our eval-
uation, we also report the effect of an in-domain
LM trained on 50 word classes induced from the
corpus by maximum-likelihood based clustering
(Och, 1999).

In the two language pairs, both types of LM
result in consistent improvements over the base-
line. However, the gains achieved by the hybrid
approach are larger and all statistically signifi-
cant. The hybrid approach is significantly bet-
ter than the unsupervised one by TER in Arabic-
English and by BLEU and METEOR in English-
French (these siginificances are not reported in

pears to better leverage the available in-domain
data, achieving improvements according to all
metrics: +0.5/+0.4/-1.0 BLEU/METEOR/TER
in Arabic-English and +0.7/-0.6/-0.3 in English-
French, without requiring any bitext annotation or
decoder modification.

Talk-level analysis. To conclude the study,
we analyze the effect of our best hybrid LM
on Arabic-English translation quality, at the sin-
gle talk level. The test used in the experiments
(tst2010) consists of 11 transcripts with an av-
erage length of 151±73 sentences. For each
talk, we compare the baseline BLEU score with
that obtained by adding a .25-POS/lemmas hybrid
LM. Results are presented in Figure 2. The dark
and light columns denote baseline and hybrid-LM
BLEU scores, respectively, and refer to the left y-
axis. Additional data points, plotted on the right
y-axis in reverse order, represent talk-level per-
plexities (PP) of a standard 5-gram LM trained
on TED (◦) and those of the .25-POS/lemmas
10-gram hybrid LM (M), computed on reference
translations.

What emerges first is a dramatic variation of
performance among the speeches, with baseline
BLEU scores ranging from 33.95 on talk “00” to
only 12.42 on talk “02”. The latter talk appears as
a corner case also according to perplexities (397
by word LM and 111 by hybrid LM). Notably, the
perplexities of the two LMs correlate well with
each other, but the hybrid’s PP is much more sta-
ble across talks: its standard deviation is only 14

points, while that of the word-based PP is 79. The
BLEU improvement given by hybrid LM, how-
ever modest, is consistent across the talks, with
only two outliers: a drop of -0.2 on talk “00”, and
a drop of -0.7 on talk “02”. The largest gain (+1.1)
is observed on talk “10”, from 16.8 to 17.9 BLEU.

6 Conclusions

We have proposed a language modeling technique
that leverages the in-domain data for SMT style
adaptation. Trained to predict mixed sequences
of POS classes and frequent words, hybrid LMs
are devised to capture typical lexical and syntactic
constructions that characterize the style of speech
transcripts.

Compared to standard language models, hy-
brid LMs generalize better to the test data and
partially compensate for the disproportion be-
tween in-domain and out-of-domain training data.
At the same time, hybrid LMs show more dis-
criminative power than merely POS-level LMs.
The integration of hybrid LMs into a competi-
tive phrase-based SMT system is straightforward
and leads to consistent improvements on the TED
task, according to three different translation qual-
ity metrics.

Target language modeling is only one aspect
of the statistical translation problem. Now that
the usability of the proposed method has been as-
sessed for language modeling, future work will
address the extension of the idea to the modeling
of phrase translation and reordering.
