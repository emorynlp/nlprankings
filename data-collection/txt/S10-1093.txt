Abstract

This document describes the prelimi-
nary release of the integrated Kyoto sys-
tem for specific domain WSD. The sys-
tem uses concept miners (Tybots) to ex-
tract domain-related terms and produces
a domain-related thesaurus, followed by
knowledge-based WSD based on word-
net graphs (UKB). The resulting system
can be applied to any language with a
lexical knowledge base, and is based on
publicly available software and resources.
Our participation in Semeval task #17 fo-
cused on producing running systems for
all languages in the task, and we attained
good results in all except Chinese. Due
to the pressure of the time-constraints in
the competition, the system is still under
development, and we expect results to im-
prove in the near future.

1 Introduction

In this paper we describe the participation of the
integrated Kyoto system on the “SemEval-2010
task #17: All-words Word Sense Disambigua-
tion on a Specific Domain” task (Agirre et al.,
2010). The goal of our participation was to eval-
uate the preliminary release of the integrated sys-
tem for specific domain WSD developed for the
Kyoto project1. Besides, we wanted to test the
performance of our domain specific WSD system
(Agirre et al., 2009) on this test set, and to inte-
grate the thesaurus construction software (Tybots)
developed for the project. The system can be run
for any language and domain if provided with a
lexical knowledge base and some background doc-
uments on the domain.

We will first present the components of our sys-
tem, followed by the experimental design and the

results. Finally, the conclusions are presented.

2 The Kyoto System for Domain Specific
WSD

We will present in turn UKB, the Tybots, and the
lexical knowledge-bases used.

2.1 UKB
UKB is a knowledge-based unsupervised WSD
system which exploits the structure of an under-
lying Language Knowledge Base (LKB) and finds
the most relevant concepts given an input con-
text (Agirre and Soroa, 2009). UKB starts by tak-
ing the LKB as a graph of concepts G = (V,E)
with a set of vertices V derived from LKB con-
cepts and a set of edges E representing relations
among them. Giving an input context, UKB ap-
plies the so called Personalized PageRank (Haveli-
wala, 2002) over it to obtain the most representa-
tive senses for the context.

PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is a method
for scoring the vertices V of a graph according
to each node’s structural importance. The algo-
rithm can be viewed as random walk process that
postulate the existence of a particle that randomly
traverses the graph, but at any time may jump to
a new vertex with a given damping factor (also
called teleport probability). After PageRank cal-
culation, the final weight of node i represents the
proportion of time that a random particle spends
visiting node i after a sufficiently long time. In
standard PageRank, the teleport vector is chosen
uniformly, whereas for Personalized PageRank it
is chosen from a nonuniform distribution of nodes,
specified by a teleport vector.

UKB concentrates the initial probability mass
of the teleport vector in the words occurring in
the context of the target word, causing all random
jumps on the walk to return to these words and
thus assigning a higher rank to the senses linked to
these words. Moreover, the high rank of the words

417



spreads through the links in the graph and make
all the nodes in its vicinity also receive high ranks.
Given a target word, the system checks which is
the relative ranking of its senses, and the WSD
system would output the one ranking highest.

UKB is very flexible and can be use to perform
WSD on different settings, depending on the con-
text used for disambiguating a word instance. In
this paper we use it to perform general and do-
main specific WSD, as shown in section 3. PageR-
ank is calculated by applying an iterative algo-
rithm until convergence below a given threshold
is achieved. Following usual practice, we used a
damping value of 0.85 and set the threshold value
at 0.001. We did not optimize these parameters.

2.2 Tybots

Tybots (Term Yielding Robots) are text mining
software that mine domain terms from corpus
(e.g. web pages), organizing them in a hierar-
chical structure, connecting them to wordnets and
ontologies to create a semantic model for the do-
main (Bosma and Vossen, 2010). The software is
freely available using Subversion 2. Tybots try to
establish a view on the terminology of the domain
which is as complete as possible, discovering rela-
tions between terms and ranking terms by domain
relevance.

Preceding term extraction, we perform tok-
enization, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatiza-
tion, which is stored in Kyoto Annotation For-
mat (KAF) (Bosma et al., 2009). Tybots work
through KAF documents, acquire domain relevant
terms based on the syntactic features, gather co-
occurrence statistics to decide which terms are sig-
nificant in the domain and produce a thesaurus
with sets of related words. Section 3.3 describes
the specific settings that we used.

2.3 Lexical Knowledge bases

We used the following wordnets, as suggested by
the organizers:
WN30g: English WordNet 3.0 with gloss relations
(Fellbaum, 1998).
Dutch: The Dutch LKB is part of the Cor-
netto database version 1.3 (Vossen et al., 2008).
The Cornetto database can be obtained from
the Dutch/Flanders Taalunie3. Cornetto com-
prises taxonomic relations and equivalence rela-

tions from both WordNet 2.0 and 3.0. Cornetto
concepts are mapped to English WordNet 3.0.
Italian: Italwordnet (Roventini et al., 2003) was
created in the framework of the EuroWordNet,
employs the same set of semantic relations used
in EuroWordNet, and includes links to WordNet
3.0 synsets.
Chinese: The Chinese WordNet (Version 1.6) is
now partially open to the public4 (Tsai et al.,
2001). The Chinese WordNet is also mapped to
WordNet 3.0.

Table 1 shows the sizes of the graphs created
using each LKB as a source. The upper part shows
the number of lexical entries, synsets and relations
of each LKB. It also depicts the number of links to
English WordNet 3.0 synsets.

In addition, we also created bilingual graphs for
Dutch, Italian and Chinese, comprising the orig-
inal monolingual LKB, the links to WordNet 3.0
and WordNet 3.0 itself. We expected this richer
graphs to perform better performance. The sizes
of the bilingual graphs are shown in the lower side
of Table 1.

3 Experimental setting

All test documents were lemmatized and PoS-
tagged using the linguistic processors available
within the Kyoto project. In this section we de-
scribe the submitted runs.

3.1 UKB parameters

We use UKB with the default parameters. In par-
ticular, we don’t use dictionary weights, which in
the case of English come from annotated corpora.
This is done in order to make the system fully un-
supervised. It’s also worth mentioning that in the
default setting parts of speech were not used.

cision (P) and recall (R), overall and for each PoS.
We include the First Sense (1sense) and random
baselines, as well as the best run, as provided by
the organizers.

3.2 Run1: UKB using context

The first run is an application of the UKB tool in
the standard setting, as described in (Agirre and
Soroa, 2009). Given the input text, we split it in
sentences, and we disambiguate each sentence at a
time. We extract the lemmas which have an entry
in the LKB and then apply Personalized PageR-
ank over all of them, obtaining a score for every
concept of the LKB. To disambiguate the words in
the sentence we just choose its associated concept
(sense) with maximum score.

In our experiments we build a context of at least
20 content words for each sentence to be disam-
biguated, taking the sentences immediately before
when necessary. UKB allows two main methods
of disambiguation, namely ppr and ppr w2w. We
used the latter method, as it has been shown to per-
form best.

In this setting we used the monolingual graphs
for each language (cf. section 2.3). Note that
in this run there is no domain adaptation, it thus
serves us as a baseline for assessing the benefits of
applying domain adaptation techniques.

3.3 Run2: UKB using related words
Instead of disambiguating words using their con-
text of occurrence, we follow the method de-
scribed in (Agirre et al., 2009). The idea is to first
obtain a list of related words for each of the tar-
get words, as collected from a domain corpus. On
a second step each target word is disambiguated
using the N most related words as context (see
below). For instance, in order to disambiguate
the word environment, we would not take into
account the context of occurrence (as in Section
3.2), but we would use the list of most related
words in the thesaurus (e.g. “biodiversity, agri-
culture, ecosystem, nature, life, climate, . . .”). Us-
ing UKB over these contexts we obtain the most
predominant sense for each target word in the do-
main(McCarthy et al., 2007), which is used to la-
bel all occurrences of the target word in the test
dataset.

In order to build the thesaurus with the lists of
related words, we used Tybots (c.f. section 2.2),
one for each corpus of the evaluation dataset, i.e.
Chinese, Dutch, English, and Italian. We used the
background documents provided by the organiz-
ers, which we processed using the linguistic pro-
cessors of the project to obtain the documents in
KAF. We used the Tybots with the following set-
tings. We discarded co-occurring words with fre-
quencies below 105. Distributional similarity was
computed using (Lin, 1998). Finally, we used up
to 50 related words for each target word.

As in run1, we used the monolingual graphs for
the LKBs in each language.

3.4 Run3: UKB using related words and
bilingual graphs

The third run is exactly the same as run2, except
that we used bilingual graphs instead of monolin-
gual ones for all languages other than English (cf.
section 2.3). There is no run3 for English.

4 Results

Table 2 shows the results of our system on the
different languages. We will analyze different as-
pects of the results in turn.
Domain adaptation: Using Personalized Pager-
ank over related words (run2 and run3) con-
sistently outperforms the standard setting (run1)
in all languages. This result is consistent with

the small size of the background corpus.

our previous work on English (Agirre et al.,
2009), and shows that domain adaptation works
for knowledge-based systems.
Monolingual vs. Bilingual graphs: As ex-
pected, we obtained better results using the bilin-
gual graphs (run3) than with monolingual graphs
(run2), showing that the English WordNet has a
richer set of relations, and that those relations can
be successfully ported to other languages. This
confirms that aligning different wordnets at the
synset level is highly beneficial.
Overall results: the results of our runs are highly
satisfactory. In two languages (Dutch and Ital-
ian) our best runs perform better than the first
sense baseline, which is typically hard to beat for
knowledge-based systems. In English, our system
performs close but below the first sense baseline,
and in Chinese our method performed below the
random baseline.

The poor results obtained for Chinese can be
due the LKB topology; an analysis over the graph
shows that it is formed by a large number of
small components, unrelated with each other. This
’flat’ structure heavily penalizes the graph based
method, which is many times unable to discrimi-
nate among the concepts of a word. We are cur-
rently inspecting the results, and we don’t discard
bugs, due to the preliminary status of our software.
In particular, we need to re-examine the output of
the Tybot for Chinese.

5 Conclusions

This paper describes the results of the prelimi-
nary release of he integrated Kyoto system for do-
main specific WSD. It comprises Tybots to con-
struct a domain-related thesaurus, and UKB for
knowledge-based WSD based on wordnet graphs.
We applied our system to all languages in the
dataset, obtaining good results. In fact, our sys-
tem can be applied to any language with a lexical
knowledge base, and is based on publicly available
software and resources. We used the wordnets and
background texts provided by the organizers of the
task.

Our results show that we were succesful in
adapting our system to the domain, as we man-
aged to beat the first sense baseline in two lan-
guages. Our results also show that adding the En-
glish WordNet to the other language wordnets via
the available links is beneficial.

Our participation focused on producing running

systems for all languages in the task, and we at-
tained good results in all except Chinese. Due to
the pressure and the time-constraints in the com-
petition, the system is still under development. We
are currently revising our system for bugs and fine-
tuning it.
