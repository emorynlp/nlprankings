Abstract

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu
et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art
performance on sentence-pair regression tasks
like semantic textual similarity (STS). How-
ever, it requires that both sentences are fed
into the network, which causes a massive com-
putational overhead: Finding the most sim-
ilar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences
requires about 50 million inference computa-
tions (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction
of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic sim-
ilarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks
like clustering.

In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT
(SBERT), a modification of the pretrained
BERT network that use siamese and triplet net-
work structures to derive semantically mean-
ingful sentence embeddings that can be com-
pared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the
effort for finding the most similar pair from 65
hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 sec-
onds with SBERT, while maintaining the ac-
curacy from BERT.

We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on com-
mon STS tasks and transfer learning tasks,
where it outperforms other state-of-the-art
sentence embeddings methods.1

1 Introduction

In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT
(SBERT), a modification of the BERT network us-
ing siamese and triplet networks that is able to
derive semantically meaningful sentence embed-
dings2. This enables BERT to be used for certain
new tasks, which up-to-now were not applicable
for BERT. These tasks include large-scale seman-

similar sentences are close in vector space.

tic similarity comparison, clustering, and informa-
tion retrieval via semantic search.

BERT set new state-of-the-art performance on
various sentence classification and sentence-pair
regression tasks. BERT uses a cross-encoder: Two
sentences are passed to the transformer network
and the target value is predicted. However, this
setup is unsuitable for various pair regression tasks
due to too many possible combinations. Finding
in a collection of n = 10 000 sentences the pair
with the highest similarity requires with BERT
n·(n−1)/2 = 49 995 000 inference computations.
On a modern V100 GPU, this requires about 65
hours. Similar, finding which of the over 40 mil-
lion existent questions of Quora is the most similar
for a new question could be modeled as a pair-wise
comparison with BERT, however, answering a sin-
gle query would require over 50 hours.

A common method to address clustering and se-
mantic search is to map each sentence to a vec-
tor space such that semantically similar sentences
are close. Researchers have started to input indi-
vidual sentences into BERT and to derive fixed-
size sentence embeddings. The most commonly
used approach is to average the BERT output layer
(known as BERT embeddings) or by using the out-
put of the first token (the [CLS] token). As we
will show, this common practice yields rather bad
sentence embeddings, often worse than averaging
GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).

To alleviate this issue, we developed SBERT.
The siamese network architecture enables that
fixed-sized vectors for input sentences can be de-
rived. Using a similarity measure like cosine-
similarity or Manhatten / Euclidean distance, se-
mantically similar sentences can be found. These
similarity measures can be performed extremely
efficient on modern hardware, allowing SBERT
to be used for semantic similarity search as well
as for clustering. The complexity for finding the

most similar sentence pair in a collection of 10,000
sentences is reduced from 65 hours with BERT to
the computation of 10,000 sentence embeddings
(~5 seconds with SBERT) and computing cosine-
similarity (~0.01 seconds). By using optimized
index structures, finding the most similar Quora
question can be reduced from 50 hours to a few
milliseconds (Johnson et al., 2017).

We fine-tune SBERT on NLI data, which cre-
ates sentence embeddings that significantly out-
perform other state-of-the-art sentence embedding
methods like InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017) and
Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018). On
seven Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks,
SBERT achieves an improvement of 11.7 points
compared to InferSent and 5.5 points compared to
Universal Sentence Encoder. On SentEval (Con-
neau and Kiela, 2018), an evaluation toolkit for
sentence embeddings, we achieve an improvement
of 2.1 and 2.6 points, respectively.

SBERT can be adapted to a specific task. It
sets new state-of-the-art performance on a chal-
lenging argument similarity dataset (Misra et al.,
2016) and on a triplet dataset to distinguish sen-
tences from different sections of a Wikipedia arti-
cle (Dor et al., 2018).

The paper is structured in the following way:
Section 3 presents SBERT, section 4 evaluates
SBERT on common STS tasks and on the chal-
lenging Argument Facet Similarity (AFS) corpus
(Misra et al., 2016). Section 5 evaluates SBERT
on SentEval. In section 6, we perform an ablation
study to test some design aspect of SBERT. In sec-
tion 7, we compare the computational efficiency of
SBERT sentence embeddings in contrast to other
state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods.

2 Related Work

We first introduce BERT, then, we discuss state-
of-the-art sentence embedding methods.

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a pre-trained
transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017), which
set for various NLP tasks new state-of-the-art re-
sults, including question answering, sentence clas-
sification, and sentence-pair regression. The input
for BERT for sentence-pair regression consists of
the two sentences, separated by a special [SEP]
token. Multi-head attention over 12 (base-model)
or 24 layers (large-model) is applied and the out-
put is passed to a simple regression function to de-
rive the final label. Using this setup, BERT set a

new state-of-the-art performance on the Semantic
Textual Semilarity (STS) benchmark (Cer et al.,
2017). RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) showed, that
the performance of BERT can further improved by
small adaptations to the pre-training process. We
also tested XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), but it led in
general to worse results than BERT.

A large disadvantage of the BERT network
structure is that no independent sentence embed-
dings are computed, which makes it difficult to de-
rive sentence embeddings from BERT. To bypass
this limitations, researchers passed single sen-
tences through BERT and then derive a fixed sized
vector by either averaging the outputs (similar to
average word embeddings) or by using the output
of the special CLS token (for example: May et al.
(2019); Zhang et al. (2019); Qiao et al. (2019)).
These two options are also provided by the popu-
lar bert-as-a-service-repository3. Up to our knowl-
edge, there is so far no evaluation if these methods
lead to useful sentence embeddings.

Sentence embeddings are a well studied area
with dozens of proposed methods. Skip-Thought
(Kiros et al., 2015) trains an encoder-decoder ar-
chitecture to predict the surrounding sentences.
InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017) uses labeled
data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference
dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and the Multi-
Genre NLI dataset (Williams et al., 2018) to train
a siamese BiLSTM network with max-pooling
over the output. Conneau et al. showed, that
InferSent consistently outperforms unsupervised
methods like SkipThought. Universal Sentence
Encoder (Cer et al., 2018) trains a transformer
network and augments unsupervised learning with
training on SNLI. Hill et al. (2016) showed, that
the task on which sentence embeddings are trained
significantly impacts their quality. Previous work
(Conneau et al., 2017; Cer et al., 2018) found that
the SNLI datasets are suitable for training sen-
tence embeddings. Yang et al. (2018) presented
a method to train on conversations from Reddit
using siamese DAN and siamese transformer net-
works, which yielded good results on the STS
benchmark dataset.

Humeau et al. (2019) addresses the run-time
overhead of the cross-encoder from BERT and
present a method (poly-encoders) to compute
a score between m context vectors and pre-

computed candidate embeddings using attention.
This idea works for finding the highest scoring
sentence in a larger collection. However, poly-
encoders have the drawback that the score function
is not symmetric and the computational overhead
is too large for use-cases like clustering, which
would require O(n2) score computations.

Previous neural sentence embedding methods
started the training from a random initialization.
In this publication, we use the pre-trained BERT
and RoBERTa network and only fine-tune it to
yield useful sentence embeddings. This reduces
significantly the needed training time: SBERT can
be tuned in less than 20 minutes, while yielding
better results than comparable sentence embed-
ding methods.

3 Model

SBERT adds a pooling operation to the output
of BERT / RoBERTa to derive a fixed sized sen-
tence embedding. We experiment with three pool-
ing strategies: Using the output of the CLS-token,
computing the mean of all output vectors (MEAN-
strategy), and computing a max-over-time of the
output vectors (MAX-strategy). The default config-
uration is MEAN.

In order to fine-tune BERT / RoBERTa, we cre-
ate siamese and triplet networks (Schroff et al.,
2015) to update the weights such that the produced
sentence embeddings are semantically meaningful
and can be compared with cosine-similarity.

The network structure depends on the available

training data. We experiment with the following
structures and objective functions.

Classification Objective Function. We con-
catenate the sentence embeddings u and v with
the element-wise difference |u−v| and multiply it
with the trainable weight Wt ∈ R3n×k:

o = softmax(Wt(u, v, |u− v|))

where n is the dimension of the sentence em-
beddings and k the number of labels. We optimize
cross-entropy loss. This structure is depicted in
Figure 1.

Regression Objective Function. The cosine-
similarity between the two sentence embeddings
u and v is computed (Figure 2). We use mean-
squared-error loss as the objective function.

Triplet Objective Function. Given an anchor
sentence a, a positive sentence p, and a negative
sentence n, triplet loss tunes the network such that
the distance between a and p is smaller than the
distance between a and n. Mathematically, we
minimize the following loss function:

max(||sa − sp|| − ||sa − sn||+ �, 0)

with sx the sentence embedding for a/n/p, || · ||
a distance metric and margin �. Margin � ensures
that sp is at least � closer to sa than sn. As metric
we use Euclidean distance and we set � = 1 in our
experiments.

classifier objective function for one epoch. We
used a batch-size of 16, Adam optimizer with

warm-up over 10% of the training data. Our de-
fault pooling strategy is MEAN.

4 Evaluation - Semantic Textual
Similarity

We evaluate the performance of SBERT for com-
mon Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks.
State-of-the-art methods often learn a (complex)
regression function that maps sentence embed-
dings to a similarity score. However, these regres-
sion functions work pair-wise and due to the com-
binatorial explosion those are often not scalable if
the collection of sentences reaches a certain size.
Instead, we always use cosine-similarity to com-
pare the similarity between two sentence embed-
dings. We ran our experiments also with nega-
tive Manhatten and negative Euclidean distances
as similarity measures, but the results for all ap-
proaches remained roughly the same.

4.1 Unsupervised STS

We evaluate the performance of SBERT for STS
without using any STS specific training data. We
use the STS tasks 2012 - 2016 (Agirre et al., 2012,
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), the STS benchmark (Cer
et al., 2017), and the SICK-Relatedness dataset
(Marelli et al., 2014). These datasets provide la-
bels between 0 and 5 on the semantic relatedness
of sentence pairs. We showed in (Reimers et al.,
2016) that Pearson correlation is badly suited for

STS. Instead, we compute the Spearman’s rank
correlation between the cosine-similarity of the
sentence embeddings and the gold labels. The
setup for the other sentence embedding methods
is equivalent, the similarity is computed by cosine-
similarity. The results are depicted in Table 1.

The results shows that directly using the output
of BERT leads to rather poor performances. Av-
eraging the BERT embeddings achieves an aver-
age correlation of only 54.81, and using the CLS-
token output only achieves an average correlation
of 29.19. Both are worse than computing average
GloVe embeddings.

Using the described siamese network structure
and fine-tuning mechanism substantially improves
the correlation, outperforming both InferSent and
Universal Sentence Encoder substantially. The
only dataset where SBERT performs worse than
Universal Sentence Encoder is SICK-R. Universal
Sentence Encoder was trained on various datasets,
including news, question-answer pages and dis-
cussion forums, which appears to be more suitable
to the data of SICK-R. In contrast, SBERT was
pre-trained only on Wikipedia (via BERT) and on
NLI data.

While RoBERTa was able to improve the per-
formance for several supervised tasks, we only
observe minor difference between SBERT and
SRoBERTa for generating sentence embeddings.

4.2 Supervised STS

The STS benchmark (STSb) (Cer et al., 2017) pro-
vides is a popular dataset to evaluate supervised
STS systems. The data includes 8,628 sentence
pairs from the three categories captions, news, and
forums. It is divided into train (5,749), dev (1,500)
and test (1,379). BERT set a new state-of-the-art
performance on this dataset by passing both sen-
tences to the network and using a simple regres-

BERT systems were trained with 10 random seeds and
4 epochs. SBERT was fine-tuned on the STSb dataset,
SBERT-NLI was pretrained on the NLI datasets, then
fine-tuned on the STSb dataset.

We use the training set to fine-tune SBERT us-
ing the regression objective function. At predic-
tion time, we compute the cosine-similarity be-
tween the sentence embeddings. All systems are
trained with 10 random seeds to counter variances
(Reimers and Gurevych, 2018).

The results are depicted in Table 2. We ex-
perimented with two setups: Only training on
STSb, and first training on NLI, then training on
STSb. We observe that the later strategy leads to a
slight improvement of 1-2 points. This two-step
approach had an especially large impact for the
BERT cross-encoder, which improved the perfor-
mance by 3-4 points. We do not observe a signifi-
cant difference between BERT and RoBERTa.

4.3 Argument Facet Similarity

We evaluate SBERT on the Argument Facet Sim-
ilarity (AFS) corpus by Misra et al. (2016). The
AFS corpus annotated 6,000 sentential argument
pairs from social media dialogs on three contro-
versial topics: gun control, gay marriage, and
death penalty. The data was annotated on a scale
from 0 (“different topic”) to 5 (“completely equiv-
alent”). The similarity notion in the AFS corpus
is fairly different to the similarity notion in the
STS datasets from SemEval. STS data is usually

descriptive, while AFS data are argumentative ex-
cerpts from dialogs. To be considered similar, ar-
guments must not only make similar claims, but
also provide a similar reasoning. Further, the lex-
ical gap between the sentences in AFS is much
larger. Hence, simple unsupervised methods as
well as state-of-the-art STS systems perform badly
on this dataset (Reimers et al., 2019).

We evaluate SBERT on this dataset in two sce-
narios: 1) As proposed by Misra et al., we evaluate
SBERT using 10-fold cross-validation. A draw-
back of this evaluation setup is that it is not clear
how well approaches generalize to different top-
ics. Hence, 2) we evaluate SBERT in a cross-topic
setup. Two topics serve for training and the ap-
proach is evaluated on the left-out topic. We repeat
this for all three topics and average the results.

SBERT is fine-tuned using the Regression Ob-
jective Function. The similarity score is computed
using cosine-similarity based on the sentence em-
beddings. We also provide the Pearson correla-
tion r to make the results comparable to Misra et
al. However, we showed (Reimers et al., 2016)
that Pearson correlation has some serious draw-
backs and should be avoided for comparing STS
systems. The results are depicted in Table 3.

Unsupervised methods like tf-idf, average
GloVe embeddings or InferSent perform rather
badly on this dataset with low scores. Training
SBERT in the 10-fold cross-validation setup gives
a performance that is nearly on-par with BERT.

However, in the cross-topic evaluation, we ob-
serve a performance drop of SBERT by about 7
points Spearman correlation. To be considered
similar, arguments should address the same claims
and provide the same reasoning. BERT is able to
use attention to compare directly both sentences
(e.g. word-by-word comparison), while SBERT
must map individual sentences from an unseen
topic to a vector space such that arguments with
similar claims and reasons are close. This is a
much more challenging task, which appears to re-
quire more than just two topics for training to work
on-par with BERT.

matically fine-grained train, dev and test set for
sentence embeddings methods. Wikipedia arti-
cles are separated into distinct sections focusing
on certain aspects. Dor et al. assume that sen-

tences in the same section are thematically closer
than sentences in different sections. They use this
to create a large dataset of weakly labeled sen-
tence triplets: The anchor and the positive exam-
ple come from the same section, while the neg-
ative example comes from a different section of
the same article. For example, from the Alice
Arnold article: Anchor: Arnold joined the BBC
Radio Drama Company in 1988., positive: Arnold
gained media attention in May 2012., negative:
Balding and Arnold are keen amateur golfers.

We use the dataset from Dor et al. We use the
Triplet Objective, train SBERT for one epoch on
the about 1.8 Million training triplets and evaluate
it on the 222,957 test triplets. Test triplets are from
a distinct set of Wikipedia articles. As evaluation
metric, we use accuracy: Is the positive example
closer to the anchor than the negative example?

Results are presented in Table 4. Dor et al. fine-
tuned a BiLSTM architecture with triplet loss to
derive sentence embeddings for this dataset. As
the table shows, SBERT clearly outperforms the
BiLSTM approach by Dor et al.

5 Evaluation - SentEval

SentEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018) is a popular
toolkit to evaluate the quality of sentence embed-
dings. Sentence embeddings are used as features
for a logistic regression classifier. The logistic re-
gression classifier is trained on various tasks in a
10-fold cross-validation setup and the prediction
accuracy is computed for the test-fold.

Table 4: Evaluation on the Wikipedia section triplets
dataset (Dor et al., 2018). SBERT trained with triplet
loss for one epoch.

The purpose of SBERT sentence embeddings
are not to be used for transfer learning for other
tasks. Here, we think fine-tuning BERT as de-
scribed by Devlin et al. (2018) for new tasks is
the more suitable method, as it updates all layers
of the BERT network. However, SentEval can still
give an impression on the quality of our sentence
embeddings for various tasks.

We compare the SBERT sentence embeddings
to other sentence embeddings methods on the fol-
lowing seven SentEval transfer tasks:

• MR: Sentiment prediction for movie reviews
snippets on a five start scale (Pang and Lee,
2005).

• CR: Sentiment prediction of customer prod-
uct reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).

• SUBJ: Subjectivity prediction of sentences
from movie reviews and plot summaries
(Pang and Lee, 2004).

• MPQA: Phrase level opinion polarity classi-
fication from newswire (Wiebe et al., 2005).

• SST: Stanford Sentiment Treebank with bi-
nary labels (Socher et al., 2013).

• TREC: Fine grained question-type classifi-
cation from TREC (Li and Roth, 2002).

• MRPC: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Cor-
pus from parallel news sources (Dolan et al.,
2004).

The results can be found in Table 5. SBERT
is able to achieve the best performance in 5 out
of 7 tasks. The average performance increases
by about 2 percentage points compared to In-
ferSent as well as the Universal Sentence Encoder.
Even though transfer learning is not the purpose of
SBERT, it outperforms other state-of-the-art sen-
tence embeddings methods on this task.

Table 5: Evaluation of SBERT sentence embeddings using the SentEval toolkit. SentEval evaluates sentence
embeddings on different sentence classification tasks by training a logistic regression classifier using the sentence
embeddings as features. Scores are based on a 10-fold cross-validation.

It appears that the sentence embeddings from
SBERT capture well sentiment information: We
observe large improvements for all sentiment tasks
(MR, CR, and SST) from SentEval in comparison
to InferSent and Universal Sentence Encoder.

The only dataset where SBERT is significantly
worse than Universal Sentence Encoder is the
TREC dataset. Universal Sentence Encoder was
pre-trained on question-answering data, which ap-
pears to be beneficial for the question-type classi-
fication task of the TREC dataset.

Average BERT embeddings or using the CLS-
token output from a BERT network achieved bad
results for various STS tasks (Table 1), worse than
average GloVe embeddings. However, for Sent-
Eval, average BERT embeddings and the BERT
CLS-token output achieves decent results (Ta-
ble 5), outperforming average GloVe embeddings.
The reason for this are the different setups. For
the STS tasks, we used cosine-similarity to es-
timate the similarities between sentence embed-
dings. Cosine-similarity treats all dimensions
equally. In contrast, SentEval fits a logistic regres-
sion classifier to the sentence embeddings. This
allows that certain dimensions can have higher or
lower impact on the classification result.

We conclude that average BERT embeddings /
CLS-token output from BERT return sentence em-
beddings that are infeasible to be used with cosine-
similarity or with Manhatten / Euclidean distance.
For transfer learning, they yield slightly worse
results than InferSent or Universal Sentence En-
coder. However, using the described fine-tuning
setup with a siamese network structure on NLI
datasets yields sentence embeddings that achieve
a new state-of-the-art for the SentEval toolkit.

6 Ablation Study

We have demonstrated strong empirical results for
the quality of SBERT sentence embeddings. In

this section, we perform an ablation study of dif-
ferent aspects of SBERT in order to get a better
understanding of their relative importance.

We evaluated different pooling strategies
(MEAN, MAX, and CLS). For the classification
objective function, we evaluate different concate-
nation methods. For each possible configuration,
we train SBERT with 10 different random seeds
and average the performances.

The objective function (classification vs. regres-
sion) depends on the annotated dataset. For the
classification objective function, we train SBERT-
base on the SNLI and the Multi-NLI dataset. For
the regression objective function, we train on the
training set of the STS benchmark dataset. Perfor-
mances are measured on the development split of
the STS benchmark dataset. Results are shown in
Table 6.

NLI STSb
Pooling Strategy
MEAN 80.78 87.44
MAX 79.07 69.92
CLS 79.80 86.62
Concatenation
(u, v) 66.04 -
(|u− v|) 69.78 -
(u ∗ v) 70.54 -
(|u− v|, u ∗ v) 78.37 -
(u, v, u ∗ v) 77.44 -
(u, v, |u− v|) 80.78 -
(u, v, |u− v|, u ∗ v) 80.44 -

Table 6: SBERT trained on NLI data with the clas-
sification objective function, on the STS benchmark
(STSb) with the regression objective function. Con-
figurations are evaluated on the development set of the
STSb using cosine-similarity and Spearman’s rank cor-
relation. For the concatenation methods, we only report
scores with MEAN pooling strategy.

When trained with the classification objective
function on NLI data, the pooling strategy has a
rather minor impact. The impact of the concate-
nation mode is much larger. InferSent (Conneau



3989

et al., 2017) and Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer
et al., 2018) both use (u, v, |u− v|, u ∗ v) as input
for a softmax classifier. However, in our architec-
ture, adding the element-wise u ∗ v decreased the
performance.

The most important component is the element-
wise difference |u − v|. Note, that the concate-
nation mode is only relevant for training the soft-
max classifier. At inference, when predicting sim-
ilarities for the STS benchmark dataset, only the
sentence embeddings u and v are used in combi-
nation with cosine-similarity. The element-wise
difference measures the distance between the di-
mensions of the two sentence embeddings, ensur-
ing that similar pairs are closer and dissimilar pairs
are further apart.

When trained with the regression objective
function, we observe that the pooling strategy has
a large impact. There, the MAX strategy perform
significantly worse than MEAN or CLS-token strat-
egy. This is in contrast to (Conneau et al., 2017),
who found it beneficial for the BiLSTM-layer of
InferSent to use MAX instead of MEAN pooling.

7 Computational Efficiency

Sentence embeddings need potentially be com-
puted for Millions of sentences, hence, a high
computation speed is desired. In this section, we
compare SBERT to average GloVe embeddings,
InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017), and Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018).

For our comparison we use the sentences from
the STS benchmark (Cer et al., 2017). We com-
pute average GloVe embeddings using a sim-
ple for-loop with python dictionary lookups and
NumPy. InferSent4 is based on PyTorch. For
Universal Sentence Encoder, we use the Tensor-
Flow Hub version5, which is based on Tensor-
Flow. SBERT is based on PyTorch. For improved
computation of sentence embeddings, we imple-
mented a smart batching strategy: Sentences with
similar lengths are grouped together and are only
padded to the longest element in a mini-batch.
This drastically reduces computational overhead
from padding tokens.

Performances were measured on a server with
Intel i7-5820K CPU @ 3.30GHz, Nvidia Tesla

V100 GPU, CUDA 9.2 and cuDNN. The results
are depicted in Table 7.

Model CPU GPU
Avg. GloVe embeddings 6469 -
InferSent 137 1876
Universal Sentence Encoder 67 1318
SBERT-base 44 1378
SBERT-base - smart batching 83 2042

Table 7: Computation speed (sentences per second) of
sentence embedding methods. Higher is better.

On CPU, InferSent is about 65% faster than
SBERT. This is due to the much simpler net-
work architecture. InferSent uses a single Bi-
LSTM layer, while BERT uses 12 stacked trans-
former layers. However, an advantage of trans-
former networks is the computational efficiency
on GPUs. There, SBERT with smart batching
is about 9% faster than InferSent and about 55%
faster than Universal Sentence Encoder. Smart
batching achieves a speed-up of 89% on CPU and
48% on GPU. Average GloVe embeddings is obvi-
ously by a large margin the fastest method to com-
pute sentence embeddings.

8 Conclusion

We showed that BERT out-of-the-box maps sen-
tences to a vector space that is rather unsuit-
able to be used with common similarity measures
like cosine-similarity. The performance for seven
STS tasks was below the performance of average
GloVe embeddings.

To overcome this shortcoming, we presented
Sentence-BERT (SBERT). SBERT fine-tunes
BERT in a siamese / triplet network architec-
ture. We evaluated the quality on various com-
mon benchmarks, where it could achieve a sig-
nificant improvement over state-of-the-art sen-
tence embeddings methods. Replacing BERT with
RoBERTa did not yield a significant improvement
in our experiments.

SBERT is computationally efficient. On a GPU,
it is about 9% faster than InferSent and about 55%
faster than Universal Sentence Encoder. SBERT
can be used for tasks which are computationally
not feasible to be modeled with BERT. For exam-
ple, clustering of 10,000 sentences with hierarchi-
cal clustering requires with BERT about 65 hours,
as around 50 Million sentence combinations must
be computed. With SBERT, we were able to re-
duce the effort to about 5 seconds.
