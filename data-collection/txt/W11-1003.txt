Abstract

To facilitate the application of semantics in
statistical machine translation, we propose
a broad-coverage predicate-argument struc-
ture mapping technique using automated re-
sources. Our approach utilizes automatic
syntactic and semantic parsers to gener-
ate Chinese-English predicate-argument struc-
tures. The system produced a many-to-many
argument mapping for all PropBank argu-
ment types by computing argument similarity
based on automatic word alignment, achieving
80.5% F-score on numbered argument map-
ping and 64.6% F-score on all arguments. By
measuring predicate-argument structure sim-
ilarity based on the argument mapping, and
formulating the predicate-argument structure
mapping problem as a linear-assignment prob-
lem, the system achieved 84.9% F-score us-
ing automatic SRL, only 3.7% F-score lower
than using gold standard SRL. The map-
ping output covered 49.6% of the annotated
Chinese predicates (which contains predicate-
adjectives that often have no parallel annota-
tions in English) and 80.7% of annotated En-
glish predicates, suggesting its potential as a
valuable resource for improving word align-
ment and reranking MT output.

1 Introduction

As the demand for semantically consistent machine
translation rises (Wu and Fung, 2009a), the need
for a comprehensive semantic mapping tool has be-
come more apparent. With the current architecture
of machine translation decoders, few ways of in-
corporating semantics in MT output include using

word sense disambiguation to select the correct tar-
get translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007) and reorder-
ing/reranking MT output based on semantic con-
sistencies (Wu and Fung, 2009b) (Carpuat et al.,
2010). While a comprehensive semantic mapping
tool can supplement or improve the results of such
techniques, there are many other exciting ideas we
can explore: with automatic SRL, we can improve
coverage (and possibly accuracy) of Chinese seman-
tic class generation (Wu et al., 2010) by running the
system on a large, unannotated parallel corpus. Us-
ing predicate-argument mappings as constraints, it
may be possibly to improve SRL output by perform-
ing joint inference of SRL in source and target lan-
guages simultaneously, much like what Burkett and
Klein (2008) was able to achieve with syntactic pars-
ing.

As the foundation of many machine translation
decoders (DeNeefe and Knight, 2009), word align-
ment has continuously played an important role in
machine translation. There have been several at-
tempts to improve word alignment, most of which
have focused on tree-to-tree alignments of syntac-
tic structures (Zhang et al., 2007; Mareček, 2009a).
Our hypothesis is that the predicate-argument struc-
ture alignments can abstract away from language
specific syntactic variation and provide a more ro-
bust, semantically coherent alignment across sen-
tences.

We begin by running GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003), one of the most popular alignment tools, to
obtain automatic word alignments between parallel
English/Chinese corpora. To achieve a broader cov-
erage of semantic mappings than just those anno-

21



tated in parallel PropBank-ed corpora, we attempt
to map automatically generated predicate-argument
structures. For each Chinese and English verb pred-
icate pairs within a parallel sentence, we exam-
ine the quality of both the predicate and argument
alignment (using GIZA++ word alignment output)
and devise a many-to-many argument mapping tech-
nique. From that, we pose predicate-argument map-
ping as a linear assignment problem (optimizing the
total similarity of the mapping) and solve it with
the Kuhn-Munkres method (Kuhn, 1955). With
this approach, we were able to incur only a small
predicate-argument F-score degradation over using
manual PropBank annotation. The output also pro-
vides much more fine-grained argument mapping
that can be used for downstream MT applications.

2 Related work

Our basic approach to semantic mapping is similar
to the idea of semantic similarity based on triangu-
lation between parallel corpora outlined in Resnik
(2004) and Madnani et al. (2008a; 2008b), but is
implemented here quite differently. It is most sim-
ilar in execution to the work of (Mareček, 2009b),
which improves word alignment by aligning tec-
togrammatical trees in a parallel English/Czech cor-
pus. The Czech corpus is first lemmatized because
of the rich morphology, and then the word alignment
is “symmetrized”. However, this approach does not
explicitly make use of the predicate-argument struc-
ture to confirm the alignments or to suggest new
ones.

Padó and Lapata (2005; 2006) used word align-
ment and syntax based argument similarity to
project English FrameNet semantic roles to German.
The approach relied on annotated semantic roles on
the source side only, precluding joint inferenece of
the projection using reference or automatic target
side semantic roles.

Fung et al. (2007) demonstrated that there is
poor semantic parallelism between Chinese-English
bilingual sentences. Their technique for im-
proving Chinese-English predicate-argument map-
ping (ARGChinese,i 7→ ARGEnglish,j) consists of
matching predicates with a bilingual lexicon, com-
puting cosine-similarity (based on lexical transla-
tion) of arguments and tuning on an unannotated

parallel corpus. The system differs from ours in
that it only provided one-to-one mapping of num-
bered arguments and may not be able to detect
predicate mapping with no lexical relations that are
nevertheless semantically related. Later, Wu and
Fung (2009b) used parallel semantic roles to im-
prove MT system outputs. Given the outputs from
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a machine translation
decoder, they reordered the outputs based on the best
predicate-argument mapping. The resulting system
showed a 0.5 point BLEU score improvement even
though the BLEU metric often discounts improve-
ment in semantic consistency of MT output.

Choi et al. (2009) (and later Wu et al. (2010))
showed how to enhance Chinese-English verb align-
ments by exploring predicate-argument structure
alignment using parallel PropBanks. The result-
ing system showed improvement over pure GIZA++
alignment. Those two systems differs from ours
in that they operated on gold standard parses and
semantic roles. The systems also did not pro-
vide explicit argument mapping between the aligned
predicate-argument structures.

3 Resources

To perform automatic semantic mapping, we need
an annotated corpus to evaluate the results. In addi-
tion, we also need a word aligner, a syntactic parser,
and a semantic role labeler (as well as annotated and
unannotated corpora to train each system).

3.1 Corpus

We used the portion of the Penn Chinese TreeBank
with word alignment annotation as the basis for eval-
uating semantic mapping. The word-aligned por-
tion, containing around 2000 parallel sentences, is
exclusive to Xinhua News (and covers around 50%
of the Xinhua corpus in the Chinese TreeBank). We
then merged the word alignment annotation with the
TreeBank and PropBank annotation of Ontonotes
4.0 (Hovy et al., 2006), which includes a wide ar-
ray of data sources like broadcast news, news wire,
magazine, web text, etc. A small percentage of the
2000 sentences were discarded because of tokeniza-
tion differences. We dubbed the resulting 1939 par-
allel sentences as the triple-gold Xinhua corpus.

22



3.2 Word Alignment
We chose GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) as our word
alignment tool primarily because of its popularity,
though there are other alternatives like Lacoste-
Julien et al. (2006).

3.3 Phrase Structure Parsing
We chose the Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein,
2007) for phrase structure parsing since it has been
tested on both English and Chinese corpora and can
be easily retrained.

3.4 Semantic Role Labeling
For semantic role labeling (SRL), we built our own
system using a fairly standard approach: SRL is
posed as a multi-class classification problem requir-
ing the identification of argument candidates for
each predicate and their argument types. Typi-
cally, argument identification and argument label-
ing are performed in two separate stages because of
time/resource constraints during training/labeling.
For our system, we chose LIBLINEAR (Fan et al.,
2008), a library for large linear classification prob-
lems, as the classifier. This alleviated the need to
separate the identification and labeling stages: argu-
ment identification is trained simply by incorporat-
ing the “NOT-ARG” label into the training data.

Most the of the features used by the classifier are
standard features found in many SRL systems; these
include:

Predicate predicate lemma and its POS tag
Voice indicates the voice of the predicate. For En-

glish, we used the six heuristics detailed by
Igo (2007), which detects both ordinary and
reduced passive constructions. For Chinese,
we simply detected the presence of passive in-
dicator words (those with SB, LB POS tags)
amongst the siblings of the predicate.

Phrase type phrase type of the constituent
Subcategorization phrase structure rule expanding

the predicate parent

Head word the head word and its POS tag of the
constituent

Parent head word whether the head word of the
parent is the same as the head word of the con-
stituent

Position whether the constituent is before or after
the predicate

Path the syntactic tree path from the predicate to
the constituent (as well as various path general-
ization methods)

First word first word and its POS tag of the con-
stituent

Last word last word and its POS tag of the con-
stituent

Syntactic frame the siblings of the constituent

Constituent distance the number of potential con-
stituents with the same phrase type between the
predicate and the constituent

We also created many bigrams (and a few trigrams)
of the above features.

By default, LIBLINEAR uses the one-vs-all ap-
proach for multi-class classification. This does not
always perform well for some easily confusable
class labels. Also, as noted by Xue (2004), cer-
tain features are strong discriminators for argument
identification but not for argument labeling, while
the reverse is true for others. Under such condi-
tions, mixing arguments and non-arguments within
the same class may produce sub-optimal results for a
binary classifier. To address these issues, we built a
pairwise multi-class classifier (using simple major-
ity voting) on top of LIBLINEAR.

The resulting English SRL system, evaluated
using the CoNLL 2005 methodology, achieved a
77.3% F-score on the WSJ corpus, comparable to
the leading system (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005) us-
ing a single parser output. The Chinese SRL system,
on the other hand, achieved 74.4% F-score on the
triple-gold Xinhua corpus (similar but not directly
comparable to Wu et al. (2006) and Xue (2008)
because of differences in TreeBank/PropBank revi-
sions as well as differences in test set).

4 Predicate-arguments mapping

4.1 Argument mapping
To produce a good predicate-argument mapping, we
needed to consider 2 things: whether good argument
mapping can be produced based on argument type
only, and whether each argument only maps to one
argument in the target language.

23



4.1.1 Predicate-dependent argument mapping
Theoretically, PropBank numbered arguments are

supposed to be consistent across predicates: ARG0
typically denotes the agent of the predicate and
ARG1 the theme. While this consistency may hold
true for predicates in the same language, as Fung et
al. (2007) noted, this is not a reliable indicator when
mapping predicate-arguments between Chinese and
English. For example, when comparing the Prop-
Bank frames of the English verb arrive and the syn-
onymous Chinese verb抵达, we see ARG1 (entity in
motion) for arrive.01 is equivalent to ARG0 (agent)
of 抵达.01 while ARG4 (end point, destination) is
equivalent to ARG1 (destiny).

4.1.2 Many-to-many argument mapping
Just as there are shortcomings in assuming pred-

icate independent argument mappings, assuming
one-to-one argument mapping may also be overly
restrictive. For example, in the following Chinese
sentence:
大 通道 建设 搞搞搞活活活了大 西南的 物流
big passage construction invigorated big southwest’s material flow

the predicate搞活(invigorate) has 2 arguments:

• ARG0: 大 通道 建设 (big passage construc-
tion)

• ARG1: 大 西南的物流 (big southwest’s ma-
terial flow)

In the parallel English sentence:

Construction of the main passage has activated the
flow of materials in the great southwest

activate has 3 arguments:

• ARG0: construction of the main passage
• ARG1: the flow of materials
• ARGM-LOC: in the great southwest

In these parallel sentences, ARG1 of搞活 should be
mapped to both ARG1 and ARGM-LOC of activate.

While the English translation of搞活, invigorate,
is not a direct synonym of activate, they at least have
some distant relationship as indicated by sharing
the inherited hypernym make in the WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) database. The same cannot be said for
all predicate-pairs. For example, in the following
parallel sentence fragments:

街上 客流 如如如 潮
on the street people flow like the tide

the Chinese predicate-argument structure for
如(like) is:

• ARG0: 客流 (flow of guests)
• ARG1: 潮 (tide)
• ARGM-LOC:街上 (on the street)

while the English predicate-argument structure for
flow is:

• ARG1: people
• ARGM-LOC: on the street
• ARGM-MNR: like the tide

Semantically, the predicate-argument pairs are
equivalent. The argument mapping, however, is
more complex:

• 如.ARG0⇐⇒ flow.ARG1, flow.V
• 如.V,如.ARG1⇐⇒ flow.ARGM-MNR
• 如.ARGM-LOC⇐⇒ flow.ARGM-LOC

Table 1 details the argument mapping for the
triple-gold Xinhua data. The mapping distribution
for ARG0 and ARG1 is relatively deterministic (and
similar to ones found by Fung et al. (2007)). Map-
pings involving ARG2-5 and modifier arguments,
on the other hand, are much more varied. Typically,
when there is a many-to-many argument mapping,
it’s constrained to a one-to-two or two-to-one map-
ping. Much more rarely is there a case of a two-to-
two or even more complex mapping.

4.2 Word alignment based argument mapping

To achieve optimal mappings between parallel
predicate-argument structure, we would like to max-
imize the number of words in the mapped argument
set (over the entire set of arguments) while minimiz-
ing the number of unaligned words in the mapped
argument set.

Let ac,i and ac,j denote arguments in Chinese and
English respectively, AI as a set of arguments, Wc,i
as words in argument ac,i, and mape(ai) = We,i
as the word alignment function that takes the source
argument and produces a set of words in the target

Table 1: Chinese argument type (column) to English argument type (row) mapping on triple-gold Xinhua corpus

language sentence. We define precision as the frac-
tion of aligned target words in the mapped argument
set:

Pc,I =
|(∪i∈Imape(ac,i)) ∩ (∪j∈JWe,j)|

|∪i∈Imape(ac,i)|
(1)

and recall as the fraction of source words in the
mapped argument set:

Rc,I =

∑
i∈I |Wc,i|∑
∀i |Wc,i|

(2)

We then choose Ac,I that optimizes the F1-score of
Pc and Rc:

Ac,I = arg max
I

2 · Pc,I ·Rc,I
Pc,I +Rc,I

= Fc,I (3)

Finally, to constrain both source and target argument
set, we optimize:

Ac,I , Ae,J = arg max
I,J

2 · Fc,I · Fe,J
Fc,I + Fe,J

= FIJ (4)

To measure similarity between a single pair of
source, target arguments, we define:

Pij =
|mape(ac,i) ∪Wj |
|mape(ac,i)|

, Rij =
|mapc(ae,j) ∪Wi|
|mapc(ae,j)|

(5)

To generate the set of argument mapping pairs, we
simply choose all pairs of ac,i, ae,j ∈ Ac,I , Ae,J
where Fij ≥ � (� > 0).

Directly optimizing equation 4 requires exhaus-
tive search of all argument set combinations between
the source and target, which is NP-complete. While
the typical number of arguments for each predicate
is relatively small, this is nevertheless inefficient.
We performed the following greedy-based approx-
imation with quadratic complexity:

1. Compute the best (based on F-score of equa-
tion 5) pair of source-target argument mappings
for each source argument (target argument may
be reused)

2. Select the remaining argument pair with the
highest F-score

3. Insert the pair in Ac,I , Ae,J if it increases FIJ ,
else discard

4. repeat until all argument pairs are exhausted

5. repeat 1-4 reversing the source and target direc-
tion

6. merge the output of the 2 directions

Much like GIZA++ word alignment where the out-
put of each direction produces only one-to-many
mappings, merging the output of the two directions
produces many-to-many mappings.

25



4.3 One-to-one predicate-argument mapping
To find the best predicate-argument mapping be-
tween Chinese and English parallel sentences, we
assume each predicate in a Chinese or English sen-
tence can only map to one predicate in the target
sentence. As noted by Wu et al. (2010), this as-
sumption is mostly valid for the Xinhua news cor-
pus, though occasionally, a predicate from one sen-
tence may align more naturally to two predicates in
the target sentence. This typically occurs with verb
conjunctions. For example the Chinese phrase “观
光 旅游” (sightseeing and tour) is often translated
to the single English verb “travel”. As noted by Xue
and Palmer (2009), the Chinese PropBank annotates
predicative adjectives, which tend not to have an
equivalent in the English PropBank. Additionally,
some verbs in one language are nominalized in the
other. This results in a good portion of Chinese or
English predicates in parallel sentences not having
an equivalent in the other language.

With the one-to-one mapping constraint, we op-
timize the mapping by maximizing the sum of the
F1-scores (as defined by equation 4) of the predi-
cates and arguments in the mapping. Let PC and PE
denote the sets of predicates in Chinese and English
respectively, with G(PC , PE) = {g : PC 7→ PE} as
the set of possible mappings between the two predi-
cate sets, then the optimal mapping is:

g∗ = arg max
g∈G

∑
i,j∈g

FCi,Ej (6)

To turn this into a classic linear assignment problem,
we define Cost(PCi , PEj ) = 1 − FCi,Ej , and (6)
becomes:

g∗ = arg min
g∈G

∑
i,j∈g

Cost(PC,i, PE,j) (7)

(7) can be solved in polynomial time with the Kuhn-
Munkres algorithm (Kuhn (1955)).

5 Experimental setup

5.1 Reference predicate-argument mapping
To generate reference predicate-argument map-
pings, we ran the mapping system described in sec-
tion 4.2 with a cutoff threshold of FCi,Ej < 0.65
(i.e., alignments with F-score below 0.65 are dis-
carded). We reviewed a small random sample of the

output and found it to have both high precision and
recall, with only occasional discrepancies caused by
possible word alignment errors. If one-to-one argu-
ment mapping is imposed, the reference predicate-
argument mapping will lose 8.2% of the alignments.
For mappings using automatic word alignment, we
chose a cutoff threshold of FCi,Ej < 0.15. This can
easily be tuned for higher precision or recall based
on application needs.

5.2 Parser, SRL, GIZA++

We trained the Berkeley parser and our SRL sys-
tem on Ontonotes 4.0, excluding the triple-gold Xin-
hua sections as well as the non-English or Chinese
sourced portion of the corpus. GIZA++ was trained
on 400K parallel Chinese-English sentences from
various sources with the default parameters. For
the word mapping functions mape(ac), mapc(ae)
in equation 5, instead of taking the word align-
ment intersection of the source-target and target-
source directions as Padó and Lapata (2006), we
used the two alignment outputs seperately (using the
Chinese-English output when projecting Chinese ar-
gument to English words, and vice versa). On av-
erage (from the 400K corpus), an English sentence
contains 28.5% more tokens than the parallel Chi-
nese sentence (even greater at 36.2% for the Xinhua
portion). Taking either the intersection or union will
significantly affect recall or precision of the align-
ment.

6 Results

6.1 Semantic role labeling

We first provide some results of the SRL system on
the triple-gold Xinhua corpus in table 2. Unlike the
conventional wisdom which expects English SRL
to outperform Chinese SRL, when running on the
Chinese-sourced Xinhua parallel corpus, our SRL
actually performed better on Chinese than English
(74.4% vs 71.8% F-score). The Berkeley parser
output also seemed to be of higher quality on Chi-
nese; the system was able to pick out better con-
stituent candidates in Chinese than English, as ev-
idenced by the higher recall for oracle SRL (92.6%
vs 91.1%). Comparing the quality of the output by
argument type, we found the only argument type
where the Chinese SRL system performed signifi-

Table 2: SRL results on triple-gold Xinhua corpus. “arg

“oracle” is the oracle SRL based on automatic parser out-
put, and “word match” is scoring based on length of ar-
gument overlap with the reference

cantly worse is ARG0 (almost 10% F-score lower).
This is likely caused by dropped pronouns in Chi-
nese sentences (Yang and Xue, 2010), making it
harder for both the syntactic and semantic parsers
to identify the correct subject.

We also report the SRL result scored at word level
instead of at argument level (79.4% F-score for Chi-
nese and 75.5% for English). The CoNLL 2005
shared task scoring (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005)
discounts arguments that are not a perfect word span
match, even if the system output is semantically
close to the reference argument. While this is im-
portant in some applications of SRL, for other ap-
plications like improving word alignment with SRL,
improving recall on approximate arguments may be
a better trade-off than having high precision on per-
fectly matched arguments. We noticed that while
overall improvement in SRL improves both word
level and argument level performance, for other-
wisely identical systems, we can slightly favor word
level performance (up to 1-3% F-score) by includ-
ing positive training samples that are not a perfect
argument match.

6.2 Predicate-argument mapping

Table 3 details the results of Chinese-English
predicate-argument mapping. Using automatic SRL
and word alignment, the system achieved an 84.9%
F-score, only 3.7% F-score less than using gold stan-
dard SRL annotation. When looking at only ar-
guments, however, the differences are larger: au-
tomatic SRL based output produced an 80.5% F-
score for core arguments. While this compares fa-
vorably to Fung et al. (2007)’s 72.5% (albeit with

different sections of the corpus), it’s 16.5% F-score
lower than gold SRL based output. When including
all arguments, automatic SRL based output achieved
64.6% while the gold SRL based output achieved
81.6%. This indicates that the mapping result for
all arguments is limited by errors in word alignment.
We also report the results of automatic SRL on both
producing the correct argument mappings and word
spans (62.5% for core arguments and 56.5% for all
arguments). This may be relevant for applications
such as joint inference between word alignment and
SRL.

We also experimented with discriminative
(reweighing) word alignment based on part-of-
speech tags of the words to improve the mapping
system but were not able to achieve better results.
This may be due to the top few POS types account-
ing for most of the words in a language, therefore it
did not prove to be a strong discriminator.

6.3 Mapping coverage

Table 4 provides predicate and word coverage de-
tails of the predicate-argument mapping, another
potentially relevant statistic for applications of
predicate-argument mapping. High coverage of
predicates and words in the mappings may provide
more relevant constraints to help reorder MT output
or rerank word alignment. We expect labeling En-
glish nominalized predicate-arguments will help in-
crease both predicate and word coverage in the map-
ping output.

In order to build a comprehensive probability
model of Chinese-English predicate-argument map-
ping, we applied the mapping technique on an unan-
notated 400K parallel sentence corpus. Automatic

SRL found 1.6 million Chinese predicate instances
and 1.3 million English predicate instances. The
mapping system found around 700K predicate-pairs
(with FC,E < 0.3). Table 5 shows the number of
unique verbs in the corpus and contained in the map-
ping results within the Chinese and English Prop-
Bank verb framesets. The corpus also included some
verbs that do not appear in PropBank framesets.

7 Conclusion and future work

We proposed a broad-coverage predicate-argument
mapping system using automatically generated word
alignment and semantic role labeling. We also
provided a competitive Chinese and English SRL
system using a LIBLINEAR classifier and pair-
wise multi-class classification approach. By explor-
ing predicate-argument structure, the mapping sys-
tem is able to generate mappings between seman-
tically similar predicate-argument structures con-
taining non-synonymous predicates, achieving an
84.9% F-score, only 3.7% lower than the F-score
of gold-standard SRL based mappings. Utilizing
word alignment information, the system was able
to provide detailed many-to-many argument map-

pings (occurs in 8.2% of the reference mappings)
for core arguments and modifier arguments, achiev-
ing an 80.5% F-score for core arguments and 64.6%
F-score for all arguments.

While our experiment with discriminative word
alignment based on POS tags did not show improve-
ment, there are other word grouping/weighing met-
rics like n-gram based clustering, verb classification,
term frequency, that may be more appropriate for se-
mantic mapping. With the advent of a predicate-
argument annotation resource for nominalization,
Ontonotes 5, we plan to update our SRL system
to produce nominalized predicate-arguments. This
would potentially increase the predicate-argument
mapping coverage in the corpus as well as increasing
the accuracy of mapping (by reducing the number of
unmappable predicate-arguments), making the map-
ping more useful for downstream applications.

We are also experimenting with a probabilis-
tic approach to predicate-argument mapping to im-
prove the robustness of mapping against word align-
ment errors. Using the output of the current sys-
tem on a large corpus, we can establish mod-
els for p(prede|predc), p(arge|predc, prede, argc)
and refine them through iterations of expectation-
maximization. If this approach shows promise, the
next step would be to explore integrating the map-
ping model directly into GIZA++ for joint inference
of word alignment and predicate-argument mapping.
Other statistical translation specific applications we
would like to explore include extensions of MT out-
put reordering (Wu and Fung, 2009b) and rerank-
ing using predicate-argument mapping, as well as
predicate-argument projection onto the target lan-
guage as an evaluation metric for MT output.
