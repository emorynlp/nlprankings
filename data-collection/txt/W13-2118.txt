Abstract

This paper focuses on a subtask of natu-
ral language generation (NLG), voice se-
lection, which decides whether a clause is
realised in the active or passive voice ac-
cording to its contextual information. Au-
tomatic voice selection is essential for re-
alising more sophisticated MT and sum-
marisation systems, because it impacts
the readability of generated texts. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, the
NLG community has been less concerned
with explicit voice selection. In this pa-
per, we propose an automatic voice se-
lection model based on various linguistic
information, ranging from lexical to dis-
course information. Our empirical evalua-
tion using a manually annotated corpus in
Japanese demonstrates that the proposed
model achieved 0.758 in F-score, outper-
forming the two baseline models.

1 Introduction

Generating a readable text is the primary goal
in natural language generation (NLG). To realise
such text, we need to arrange discourse entities
(e.g. NPs) in appropriate positions in a sentence
according to their discourse salience. Consider the
two following Japanese texts, each of which con-
sists of two sentences.

(1) Tomi-wa kouenj-ni it-ta .
Tomi-TOP parkj-IOBJ go-PAST
(Tomi went to a parkj .)

Karei-wa sokoj-de ookina inu-ni oikake-rareta .
hei-TOP therej-LOC big dog-IOBJ chase-PASSIVE/PAST
(Hei was chased by a big dog therej .)

(2) Tomi-wa kouenj-ni it-ta .
Tomi-TOP parkj-IOBJ go-PAST
(Tomi went to a parkj .)

Ookina inu-ga sokoj-de karei-o oikake-ta .
big dog-SUBJ therej-LOC hei-OBJ chase-PAST
(A big dog chased himi therej .)

In (1), ‘Tomi’ is topicalised in the first sentence,
and then it appears at the subject position in the
second sentence. In contrast, the same argu-
ment, i.e. ‘hei’ is realised at the object position
in the second sentence of text (2). Intuitively,
text (1) is relatively more natural than text (2).
Thus, given the two predicate argument relations,
go(SUBJ:Tomi, IOBJ:parkj) and chase(SUBJ:big
dog, OBJ:Tomi, IOBJ:parkj), a generation system
should choose text (1).

The realisation from a semantic representation
(e.g. predicate argument structures) to an actual
text has been mainly developed in the area of nat-
ural language generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000),
and has been applied to various NLP applications
such as multi-document summarisation (Radev
and McKeown, 1998) and tutoring systems (Di
Eugenio et al., 2005). During the course of a
text generation process, various kinds of decisions
should be made, including decisions on textual
content, clustering the content of each clause, dis-
course structure of the clauses, lexical choices,
types of referring expressions and syntactic struc-
tures. Since these different kinds of decisions are
interrelated to each other, it is not a trivial prob-
lem to find an optimal order among these deci-
sions. This issue has been much discussed in terms
of architecture of generation systems. Although a
variety of architectures has been proposed in the
past, e.g. an integrated architecture (Appelt, 1985)
and a revision-based architecture (Inui et al., 1994;
Robin, 1994), a pipeline architecture is considered
as a consensus architecture in which decisions
are made in a predetermined order (Reiter, 1994).
Voice selection is a syntactic decision that tends to
be made in a later stage of the pipeline architec-
ture, even though it influences various decisions,
such as discourse structure and lexical choice. Un-
like referring expression generation, voice selec-
tion has received less attention and been less dis-
cussed in the past. Against this background, this

research tackles the problem of voice selection
considering a wide range of linguistic information
that is assumed to be already decided in the pre-
ceding stages of a generation process.

The paper is organised as follows. We first
overview the related work in Section 2, and then
propose a voice selection model based on the four
kinds of information that impact voice selection
in Section 3. Section 4 then demonstrates the re-
sults of empirical evaluation using the NAIST Text
Corpus (Iida et al., 2007) as training and evalu-
ation data sets. Finally, Section 5 concludes and
discusses our future directions.

2 Related work

The task of automatic voice selection has been
mainly developed in the NLG community. How-
ever, it has attracted less attention compared with
other major NLG problems, such as generating re-
ferring expressions. There is less work focusing
singly on voice selection, but not entirely with-
out exception, such as Abb et al. (1993). In their
work, passivisation is performed by taking into ac-
count both linguistic and extra-linguistic informa-
tion. The linguistic information explains passivi-
sation in an incremental generation process; realis-
ing the most salient discourse entity in short term
memory as a subject eventually leads to passivi-
sation. In contrast, extra-linguistic information is
used to move a less salient entity to a subject posi-
tion when an explicit agent is missing in the text.
Although these two kinds of information seem ad-
equate for explaining passivisation, their applica-
bility was not examined in empirical evaluations.

Sheikha and Inkpen (2011) focused attention on
voice selection in the generation task distinguish-
ing formal and informal sentences. In their work,
passivisation is considered as a rhetorical tech-
nique for conveying formal intentions. However,
they did not discuss passivisation in terms of dis-
course coherence.

3 Voice selection model

We recast the voice selection task into a binary
classification problem, i.e. given a predicate with
its arguments and its preceding context, we clas-
sify the predicate into either an active or passive
class, taking into account predicate argument rela-
tions and the preceding context of the predicate.

As shown in examples (1) and (2) in Section 1,
several factors have an impact on voice selection

in a text. In this work, we take into account the
following four information as features The details
of the feature set are shown in Table 1.

Passivisation preference of each verb An im-
portant factor of voice selection is the preference
for how frequently a verb is used in passive sen-
tences. This means each verb has a potential ten-
dency of being used in passive sentences in a do-
main. For example, the verb ‘yosou-suru (to ex-
pect)’ tends to be realised in the passive in the
newspaper domain because Japanese journalists
tend to write their opinions objectively by omitting
the agent role. To take into account this preference
of verb passivisation, we define a preference score
by the following formula:

scorepas(vi) =
freqpas(vi)
freqall(vi)

· log freqall(vi) (1)

where vi is a verb in question1, freqall(vi) is
the frequency of vi appearing in corpora, and
freqpas(vi) is the frequency of vi with the passive
marker, (ra)reru. The logarithm of freqall(vi) is
multiplied due to avoiding the overestimation of
the score for less frequent instances. In the evalua-
tion, the preference score was calculated based on
the frequency of each verb in the 12 years worth
of newspaper articles, which had been morpho-
syntactically analysed by a Japanese morpholog-
ical analyser Mecab3 and a dependency parser
CaboCha4.
Syntactic decisions As described in Section 1,
various kinds of decisions are interrelated to voice
selection. Particularly, syntactic decisions includ-
ing voice selection directly impact sentence struc-
ture. Therefore, we introduce syntactic informa-
tion except for voice selection which prescribes
how an input predicate-argument structure will be
realised in an actual text.
Semantic category of arguments Animacy of
the arguments of a predicate has an impact on their
syntactic positions. Unlike in English, inanimate
subjects tend to be avoided in Japanese. In order
to capture this tendency, we use the semantic cate-
gory of the arguments of the verb in question (e.g.

1Note that the preference needs to be defined for each
word sense. However, we here ignore the difference of senses
because selecting a correct verb sense for a given context is
still difficult.

Coreference and anaphora of arguments As
discussed in discourse theories such as Centering
Theory (Grosz et al., 1995), arguments which have
been already most salient in the preceding context
tend to be placed at the beginning of a sentence for
reducing the cognitive cost of reading, as argued in
Functional Grammar (Halliday and Matthiessen,
2004). In order to consider the characteristic, we
employ an extension of Centering Theory (Grosz
et al., 1995), proposed by Nariyama (2002) for
implementing the COREF type features in Table 1.
She proposed a generalised version of the forward
looking-center list, called the Salient Reference
List (SRL), which stores all salient discourse en-
tities (e.g. NP) in the preceding contexts in the or-
der of their saliency. A highly ranked argument’s
entity in the SRL tends to be placed in the sub-
ject position, resulting in a passive sentence if that
salient entity has a THEME role in the predicate-
argument structure. To capture this characteristic,
the order and rank of discourse entities in the SRL
are used as features5.

In addition, as described in Abb et al. (1993),
if the agent filler of a predicate is underspecified,
the passive voice is preferred so as to unfocus the
underspecified agent. Likewise, if the argument

5In Table 1 “* srl rank” stands for how highly the argu-
ment’s referent ranked out of the discourse entities in the
SRL, while “* srl order” stands for which slot (e.g. TOP slot
or SUBJ slot, etc.) stores the argument’s referent.

(in this case, the agent filler) of a predicate is ex-
ophoric, the passive voice is selected.

4 Experiments

We conducted an empirical evaluation using man-
ually annotated newspaper articles in Japanese. To
estimate the feature weights of each classifier, we
used MEGAM6, an implementation of the Maxi-
mum Entropy model, with default parameter set-
tings. We also used SVM7 with a polynomial ker-
nel for explicitly handling the dependency of the
proposed features.

4.1 Data and baseline models

For training and evaluation, we used the NAIST
Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007). Because the cor-
pus contains manually annotated predicate argu-
ment relations and coreference relations, we used
those for the inputs of voice selection. In our prob-
lem setting, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation;
given manually annotated predicate argument re-
lations and coreference relations of arguments, a
model determines whether a predicate in question
is actually realised in the passive or active voice
in the original text. The performance is measured
based on recall, precision and F-score of correctly
detecting passive voice. For evaluation, we di-
vided the texts in the corpus into two sets; one is
used for training and the other for evaluation. The
details of this division are shown in Table 2.

We employed two baseline models for compar-

ison. One is based on the passivisation preference
of each verb. The model uses only scorepas(vi)
defined in equation (1), that is, it selects the pas-
sive voice if the score is more than the threshold
parameter θ; otherwise, it selects the active voice.
The other baseline model is based on the infor-
mation that the existence of an exophoric subject
results in selecting the passive voice. To capture
this characteristic, the model classifies a verb in
question as passive if the annotated subject is ex-
ophoric; otherwise, it selects the active voice.

4.2 Results

We first evaluated performance of the first baseline
model with various θ. The results are shown in
Table 3, demonstrating that the baseline achieved
its best F-score when θ is 0.2. Therefore, we set
the θ to 0.2 in the following comparison.

Table 4 shows the results of the baselines and
proposed models. To investigate the impact of
each feature type, we conducted feature ablation
when using the maximum entropy model (ME:* in
Table 4). Table 4 shows that the model using the
feature type PRED achieves the best performance
among the four models when using a single feature
type. In addition, by adding feature type(s), the F-
score monotonically improves. Finally, the results
of the model using the PRED, ARG and COREF fea-
tures achieved the best F-score, 0.605, out of the
two baselines and models based on the maximum
entropy model. It indicates that each of the fea-
tures except SYN feature contributes to improving
performance in a complementary manner.

Furthermore, the results of the model using
SVM with the second degree polynomial kernel
show better performance than any model based on

5 Conclusion

This paper focused on the task of automatic voice
selection in text generation, taking into account
four kinds of linguistic information: passivisa-
tion preference of verbs, syntactic decisions, se-
mantic category of the arguments of a predicate,
and coreference or anaphoric relations of the argu-
ments. For empirical evaluation of voice selection
in Japanese, we used the predicate argument re-
lations and coreference relations annotated in the
NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007). Integrat-
ing the four kinds of linguistic information into
a machine learning-based approach contributed to
improving F-score by about 0.3, compared to the
best baseline model, which utilises only the pas-
sivisation preference. Finally, we achieved 0.758
in F-score by combining features using SVM.

As future work, we are planning to incorpo-
rate the proposed voice selection model into natu-
ral language generation models for more sophisti-
cated text generation. In particular, generating re-
ferring expressions and voice selection are closely
related because both tasks utilise similar linguistic
information (e.g. salience and semantic informa-
tion of arguments) for generation. Therefore, our
next challenge is to solve problems about gener-
ating referring expressions and voice selection si-
multaneously by using optimisation techniques.
