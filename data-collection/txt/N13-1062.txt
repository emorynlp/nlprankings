Abstract

Word sense disambiguation aims to identify
which meaning of a word is present in a given
usage. Gathering word sense annotations is a
laborious and difficult task. Several methods
have been proposed to gather sense annota-
tions using large numbers of untrained anno-
tators, with mixed results. We propose three
new annotation methodologies for gathering
word senses where untrained annotators are
allowed to use multiple labels and weight the
senses. Our findings show that given the ap-
propriate annotation task, untrained workers
can obtain at least as high agreement as anno-
tators in a controlled setting, and in aggregate
generate equally as good of a sense labeling.

1 Introduction
Word sense annotation is regarded as one of the most
difficult annotation tasks (Artstein and Poesio, 2008)
and building manually-annotated corpora with high-
quality sense labels is often a time- and resource-
consuming task. As a result, nearly all sense-tagged
corpora in wide-spread use are created using trained
annotators (Hovy et al., 2006; Passonneau et al.,
2010), which results in a knowledge acquisition bot-
tleneck for training systems that require sense labels
(Gale et al., 1992). In other NLP areas, this bot-
tleneck has been addressed through gathering anno-
tations using many untrained workers on platforms
such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a task
commonly referred to as crowdsourcing. Recently,
several works have proposed gathering sense anno-
tations using crowdsourcing (Snow et al., 2008; Bie-
mann and Nygaard, 2010; Passonneau et al., 2012b;

Rumshisky et al., 2012). However, these meth-
ods produce sense labels that are different from the
commonly used sense inventories such as WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).
Furthermore, while Passonneau et al. (2012b) did
use WordNet sense labels, they found the quality
was well below that of trained experts.

We revisit the task of crowdsourcing word sense
annotations, focusing on two key aspects: (1) the
annotation methodology itself, and (2) the restric-
tion to single sense assignment. First, the choice in
sense inventory plays an important role in gathering
high-quality annotations; fine-grained inventories
such as WordNet often contain several related senses
for polysemous words, which untrained annotators
find difficult to correctly apply in a given context
(Chugur et al., 2002; McCarthy, 2006; Palmer et
al., 2007; Rumshisky and Batiukova, 2008; Brown
et al., 2010). However, many agreement studies
have restricted annotators to using a single sense,
which can significantly lower inter-annotator agree-
ment (IAA) in the presence of ambiguous or poly-
semous usages; indeed, multiple studies have shown
that when allowed, annotators readily assign multi-
ple senses to a single usage (Véronis, 1998; Mur-
ray and Green, 2004; Erk et al., 2009; Passonneau
et al., 2012b). Therefore, we focus on annotation
methodologies that enable workers to use as many
labels as they feel appropriate, asking the question:
if allowed to make labeling ambiguity explicit, will
annotators agree? Furthermore, we adopt the goal
of Erk et al. (2009), which enabled annotators to
weight each sense by its applicability to the given
context, thereby quantifying the ambiguity.

This paper provides the following contributions.
First, we demonstrate that the choice in annotation
setup can significantly improve IAA and that the la-
bels of untrained workers follow consistent patterns
that enable creating high quality labeling from their
aggregate. Second, we find that the sense labeling
from crowdsourcing matches performance with an-
notators in a controlled setting.

2 Related Work
Given the potential utility of a sense-labeled corpus,
multiple studies have examined how to efficiently
gather high quality sense annotations. Snow et al.
(2008) had MTurk workers, referred to as Turkers,
disambiguate uses of “president.” While they re-
ported extremely high IAA (0.952), their analysis
was only performed on a single word.

Biemann and Nygaard (2010) and Biemann
(2012) construct a sense-labeled corpus by concur-
rently constructing the sense inventory itself. Turk-
ers used a lexical substitution task to identify valid
substitutions of a target word. The contexts for the
resulting substitutions were clustered based on their
word overlap and the resulting clusters were labeled
as senses. Biemann and Nygaard (2010) showed that
the number of sense definitions for a word in their
inventory was correlated with the number in Word-
Net, often with their inventory having fewer senses
by combining related meanings and omitting rare
meanings.

Hong and Baker (2011) evaluated multiple anno-
tation strategies for gathering FrameNet sense anno-
tations, ultimately yielding high (>90%) accuracy
for most terms after filtering. They highlight am-
biguous and polysemous usages as a notable source
of errors, which the present work directly addresses.

In the most related work, Passonneau et al.
(2012b) had Turkers annotate contexts using one or
more senses, with the requirement that a worker la-
bels all contexts. While they found that agreement
between all workers was low, their annotations could
be combined using the GLAD model (Whitehill et
al., 2000) to obtain good performance, though not
as good as trained annotators.

3 Annotation Methodologies
We consider three methodologies for gathering
sense labels: (1) the methodology of Erk et al.

(2009) for gathering weighted labels, (2) a multi-
stage strategy that uses both binary and Likert rat-
ings, and (3) MaxDiff, a paired choice format.

Likert Ratings Likert rating scales provide the
most direct way of gathering weighted sense labels;
Turkers are presented with all senses of a word and
then asked to rate each on a numeric scale. We adopt
the annotation guidelines of Erk et al. (2009) which
used a five-point scale, ranging from 1 to 5, indicat-
ing the sense does not apply or that it matches the
contextual usage exactly, respectively.

Select and Rate Recent efforts in crowdsourc-
ing have proposed multi-stage processes for accom-
plishing complex tasks, where efforts by one group
of workers are used to create new subtasks for other
workers to complete (Bernstein et al., 2010; Kittur
et al., 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2012). We propose a
two-stage strategy that aims to reduce the complex-
ity of the annotation task, referred to as Select and
Rate (S+R). First, Turkers are presented with all the
senses and asked to make a binary choice of which
senses apply. Second, a Likert rating task is created
for only those senses whose selection frequency is
above a threshold, thereby concentrating worker fo-
cus on a potentially smaller set of senses.

Our motivation for S+R is two-fold. First, the
sense definitions of certain words may be unclear
or misinterpreted by a minority of the Turkers, who
then systematically rate inapplicable senses as appli-
cable. The Select task can potentially remove such
noise and therefore improve both IAA and rating
quality in the subsequent Rate task. Second, while
the present study analyzes words with 4–8 senses,
we are ultimately interested in annotating highly
polysemous words with tens of senses, which could
present a significant cognitive burden for an annota-
tor to rate concurrently. Here, the Select stage can
potentially reduce the number of senses presented,
leading to less cognitive burden in the Rate stage.
Furthermore, as a pragmatic benefit, removing in-
applicable senses reduces the visual space required
for displaying the questions on the MTurk platform,
which can improve annotation throughput.

MaxDiff MaxDiff is an alternative to scale-based
ratings in which Turkers are presented with a only
subset of all of a word’s senses and then asked to se-
lect (1) the sense option that best matches the mean-

ing in the example context and (2) the sense option
that least matches (Louviere, 1991). In our setting,
we presented three options at a time for words with
fewer than seven senses, and four options for those
with seven senses. For a single context, multiple
subsets of the senses are presented and then their rel-
ative ranking is used to produce the numeric rating.
The final applicability ratings were produced using
a modification of the counting procedure of Orme
(2009). First, all sense ratings are computed as the
number of times the sense was rated best minus the
number of times rated least. Second, all negatively-
rated senses are assigned score of 1, and all posi-
tively ratings are normalized to be (1, 5].

4 Experiments

For measuring the difference in methodologies, we
propose three experiments based on different anal-
yses of comparing Turker and non-Turker annota-
tions on the same dataset, the latter of which we re-
fer to as the reference labeling. First, we measure
the ability of the Turkers individually by evaluat-
ing their IAA with the reference labeling. Second,
many studies using crowdsourcing combine the re-
sults into a single answer, thereby leveraging the
wisdom of the crowds (Surowiecki, 2005) to smooth
over inconsistencies in the data. Therefore, in the
second experiment, we evaluate different methods
of combining Turker responses into a single sense
labeling, referred to as an aggregate labeling, and
comparing that with the reference labeling. Third,
we measure the replicability of the Turker annota-
tions (Kilgarriff, 1999) using a sampling methodol-

ogy. Two equally-sized sets of Turker annotations
are created by randomly sampling without replace-
ment from the full set of annotations for each item.
IAA is calculated between the aggregate labelings
computed from each set. This sampling is repeated
50 times and we report the mean IAA as a measure
of the expected degree of replicability when anno-
tating using different groups of Turkers.

For the reference sense labeling, we use a subset
of the GWS dataset of Erk et al. (2009), where three
annotators rated 50 instances each for eight words.
For clarity, we refer to these individuals as the GWS
annotators. Given a word usage in a sentence, GWS
annotators rated the applicability of all WordNet 3.0
senses using the same Likert scale as described in
Section 3. Contexts were drawn evenly from the
SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) and SENSEVAL-3 lex-
ical substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2004) corpora.
GWS annotators were apt to use multiple senses,
with nearly all instances having multiple labels.

For each annotation task, Turkers were presented
with an identical set of annotation guidelines, fol-
lowed by methodology-specific instructions.1 To in-
crease the familiarity with the task, four instances
were shown per task, with all instances using the
same target word. Unlike Passonneau et al. (2012b),
we did not require a Turker to annotate all contexts
for a single word; however many Turkers did com-
plete the majority of instances. Both the Likert, Se-
lect, and Rate tasks used ten Turkers each. Senses
were passed from Select to Rate if they received at

least three votes. For MaxDiff, we gathered at least
3n annotations per context where n is the number of
senses of the target word, ensuring that each sense
appeared at least once. Due to resource limitations,
we omitted the evaluation of argument.n for MaxD-
iff. Following the recommendation of Kosinski et al.
(2012), Turkers were paid $0.05USD for each Lik-
ert, Select, and Rate task. For MaxDiff, due to their
shorter nature and comparably high volume, Turkers
were paid $0.03USD per task.

To ensure fluency in English as well as reduce the
potential for low-quality results, we prefaced each
task with a simple test question that asked the Turker
to pick out a definition of the target word from a list
of four options. The incorrect options were selected
so that they would be nonsensical for anyone famil-
iar with the target word. Additionally, we rejected
all Turker responses where more than one option
was missing a rating. In the case of missing ratings,
we infer a rating of 1. Approximately 20-30% of the
submissions were rejected by these criteria, under-
scoring the importance of filtering.

For measuring IAA, we selected Krippendorff’s
α (Krippendorff, 1980; Artstein and Poesio, 2008),
which is an agreement coefficient that handles miss-
ing data, as well as different levels of measurement,
e.g., nominal data (Select and MaxDiff) and interval
data (Likert and Rate).2 Krippendorff’s α adjusts for
chance, ranging between [−1, 1] for nominal data
and (−1, 1] for interval data, where 1 indicates per-
fect agreement and -1 indicates systematic disagree-
ment; random labels would have an expected α of
zero. We treat each sense and instance combination
as a separate item to rate.

5 Results
The results of the first experiment appear in the top
of Table 1. Two important aspects emerge. First, the
word itself plays a significant role in IAA. Though
Erk et al. (2009) reported a pair-wise IAA of the
GWS annotators between 0.466 and 0.506 using
Spearman’s ρ, the IAA varies considerably between
words for both Turkers and GWS annotators when
measured using Krippendorff’s α.

Second, the choice of annotation methodology

2We note that although the ratings are technically given on
an ordinal scale (ranks), we use the interval scale to allow com-
parison with rational ratings from the aggregate solutions.

significantly impacts IAA. While both the Likert and
S+R tasks have lower IAA than the GWS annota-
tors do, the MaxDiff annotators achieve higher IAA
for almost all words. We hypothesize that compar-
ing senses for applicability is an easier task for the
untrained worker, rather than having to construct a
mental scale of what constitutes the applicability of
each sense. Surprisingly, the binary Select task has
a lower IAA than the more complex the Likert task.
An analysis of the duration of median task comple-
tion times for the Likert and Select tasks showed lit-
tle difference (with the exception of paper.n, which
was on average 50 second faster for Likert ratings),
suggesting that both tasks are equally as cognitively
demanding. In addition, the Rate task has the lowest
IAA, despite its similarity to the Likert task. An in-
spection of the annotations shows that the full rating
scale was used, so the low value is not due to Turk-
ers always using the same rating, which would yield
an IAA near chance.

In the second experiment, we created a aggregate
sense labeling and compared its IAA with the GWS
annotators, shown in Table 1 (bottom). For scale-
based ratings, we considered three arithmetic oper-
ations for selecting the final rating: mode, median,
and mean. We found that the mode yielded the high-
est average IAA for the Likert ratings and median for
S+R; however, the differences in IAA using each op-
eration were often small. We compare the IAA with
GWS annotators against two baselines: one gener-
ated by sampling from the GWS annotators’ rating
distribution, and a second generated by uniformly
sampling in [1, 5]. By comparison, the aggregate la-
belings have a much larger IAA than the baselines,
which is often at least as high as the IAA amongst
the GWS annotators themselves, indicating that the
Turkers in aggregate are capable of producing equiv-
alent ratings. Of the three annotation methodolo-
gies, MaxDiff provides the highest IAA both within
its annotators and with its aggregate key. Surpris-
ingly, neither the Likert or S+R aggregate labeling
appears better than the other.

Based on the second experiment, we measured
the average IAA across all words between the ag-
gregate Likert and MaxDiff solutions, which was
0.472. However, this IAA is significantly affected by
the annotations for win.v and different.a, which had
the lowest IAA among Turkers (Table 1) and there-

While this IAA is still moderate, it suggests that
Turkers can still produce similar annotations even
when using different annotation methodologies.

For the third experiment, replicability is reported
as the average IAA between the sampled aggregate
labelings for all annotated words. Table 2 shows this
IAA for Likert and MaxDiff methodologies in com-
parison to other sense annotation studies. Krippen-
dorff (2004) recommends that an α of 0.8 is nec-
essary to claim high-quality agreement, which is
achieved by the MaxDiff methodology. In contrast,
the average IAA between sampled Likert ratings is
significantly lower, though the methodology does
achieve an α of 0.812 for paper.n. However, when
the two words with the lowest IAA, win.v and differ-
ent.a, are excluded, the average α increases to 0.880
for MaxDiff and 0.649 for Likert. Overall, these re-
sults suggest that MaxDiff can generate highly repli-
cable annotations with agreement on par with that of
other high-quality sense-labeled corpora. Further-
more, the Likert methodology may in aggregate still

produce moderately replicable annotations in some
cases.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

Word sense disambiguation is a difficult task, both
for humans and algorithms, with an important bot-
tleneck in acquiring large sense annotated corpora.
As a potential solution, we proposed three annota-
tion methodologies for crowdsourcing sense labels.
Importantly, we relax the single sense assignment
restriction in order to let annotators explicitly note
ambiguity through weighted sense ratings. Our find-
ings reveal that moderate IAA can be obtained using
MaxDiff ratings, with IAA surpassing that of anno-
tators in a controlled setting. Furthermore, our find-
ings showed marked differences in rating difficulty
per word, even in the weighted rating setting. In
future work, we will investigate what factors influ-
ence annotation difficulty in order to improve IAA
to what is considered expert levels, drawing from
existing work analyzing difficulty in the single label
setting (Murray and Green, 2004; Passonneau et al.,
2009; Cinková et al., 2012).
