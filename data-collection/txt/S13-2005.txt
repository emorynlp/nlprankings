Abstract

This paper presents the second round of the
task on Cross-lingual Textual Entailment for
Content Synchronization, organized within
SemEval-2013. The task was designed to pro-
mote research on semantic inference over texts
written in different languages, targeting at the
same time a real application scenario. Par-
ticipants were presented with datasets for dif-
ferent language pairs, where multi-directional
entailment relations (“forward”, “backward”,
“bidirectional”, “no entailment”) had to be
identified. We report on the training and test
data used for evaluation, the process of their
creation, the participating systems (six teams,
61 runs), the approaches adopted and the re-
sults achieved.

1 Introduction

The cross-lingual textual entailment task (Mehdad et
al., 2010) addresses textual entailment (TE) recog-
nition (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) under the new
dimension of cross-linguality, and within the new
challenging application scenario of content synchro-
nization. Given two texts in different languages, the
cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) task con-
sists of deciding if the meaning of one text can be
inferred from the meaning of the other text. Cross-
linguality represents an interesting direction for re-
search on recognizing textual entailment (RTE), es-
pecially due to its possible application in a vari-
ety of tasks. Among others (e.g. question answer-
ing, information retrieval, information extraction,
and document summarization), multilingual content

synchronization represents a challenging application
scenario to evaluate CLTE recognition components
geared to the identification of sentence-level seman-
tic relations.

Given two documents about the same topic writ-
ten in different languages (e.g. Wikipedia pages),
the content synchronization task consists of au-
tomatically detecting and resolving differences in
the information they provide, in order to produce
aligned, mutually enriched versions of the two docu-
ments (Monz et al., 2011; Bronner et al., 2012). To-
wards this objective, a crucial requirement is to iden-
tify the information in one page that is either equiv-
alent or novel (more informative) with respect to the
content of the other. The task can be naturally cast
as an entailment recognition problem, where bidi-
rectional and unidirectional entailment judgements
for two text fragments are respectively mapped into
judgements about semantic equivalence and novelty.
The task can also be seen as a machine translation
evaluation problem, where judgements about se-
mantic equivalence and novelty depend on the pos-
sibility to fully or partially translate a text fragment
into the other.

The recent advances on monolingual TE on the
one hand, and the methodologies used in Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) on the other, offer
promising solutions to approach the CLTE task. In
line with a number of systems that model the RTE
task as a similarity problem (i.e. handling similar-
ity scores between T and H as features contributing
to the entailment decision), the standard sentence
and word alignment programs used in SMT offer
a strong baseline for CLTE (Mehdad et al., 2011;

Mehdad et al., 2012). However, although repre-
senting a solid starting point to approach the prob-
lem, similarity-based techniques are just approx-
imations, open to significant improvements com-
ing from semantic inference at the multilingual
level (e.g. cross-lingual entailment rules such as
“perro”→“animal”). Taken in isolation, similarity-
based techniques clearly fall short of providing an
effective solution to the problem of assigning direc-
tions to the entailment relations (especially in the
complex CLTE scenario, where entailment relations
are multi-directional). Thanks to the contiguity be-
tween CLTE, TE and SMT, the proposed task pro-
vides an interesting scenario to approach the issues
outlined above from different perspectives, and of-
fers large room for mutual improvement.

Building on the success of the first CLTE evalua-
tion organized within SemEval-2012 (Negri et al.,
2012a), the remainder of this paper describes the
second evaluation round organized within SemEval-
2013. The following sections provide an overview
of the datasets used, the participating systems, the
approaches adopted, the achieved results, and the
lessons learned.

2 The task

Given a pair of topically related text fragments (T1
and T2) in different languages, the CLTE task con-
sists of automatically annotating it with one of the
following entailment judgements (see Figure 1 for
Spanish/English examples of each judgement):

• bidirectional (T1→T2 & T1←T2): the two

fragments entail each other (semantic equiva-
lence);

• forward (T1→T2 & T16←T2): unidirectional
entailment from T1 to T2;

• backward (T16→T2 & T1←T2): unidirectional
entailment from T2 to T1;

• no entailment (T16→T2 & T16←T2): there is
no entailment between T1 and T2 in either di-
rection;

In this task, both T1 and T2 are assumed to be
true statements. Although contradiction is relevant
from an application-oriented perspective, contradic-
tory pairs are not present in the dataset.

3 Dataset description

The CLTE-2013 dataset is composed of four CLTE
corpora created for the following language combi-
nations: Spanish/English (SP-EN), Italian/English
(IT-EN), French/English (FR-EN), German/English
(DE-EN). Each corpus consists of 1,500 sentence
pairs (1,000 for training and 500 for test), balanced
across the four entailment judgements.

In this year’s evaluation, as training set we used
the CLTE-2012 corpus1 that was created for the
SemEval-2012 evaluation exercise2 (including both
training and test sets). The CLTE-2013 test set was
created from scratch, following the methodology de-
scribed in the next section.

3.1 Data collection and annotation
To collect the entailment pairs for the 2013 test set
we adopted a slightly modified version of the crowd-
sourcing methodology followed to create the CLTE-
2012 corpus (Negri et al., 2011). The main differ-
ence with last year’s procedure is that we did not
take advantage of crowdsourcing for the whole data
collection process, but only for part of it.

As for CLTE-2012, the collection and annotation
process consists of the following steps:

1. First, English sentences were manually ex-
tracted from Wikipedia and Wikinews. The se-
lected sentences represent one of the elements
(T1) of each entailment pair;

2http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task8/

26



2. Next, each T1 was modified in various ways
in order to obtain a corresponding T2. While
in the CLTE-2012 dataset the whole T2 cre-
ation process was carried out through crowd-
sourcing, for the CLTE-2013 test set we crowd-
sourced only the first phase of T1 modification,
namely the creation of paraphrases. Focusing
on the creation of high quality paraphrases, we
followed the crowdsourcing methodology ex-
perimented in Negri et al. (2012b), in which
a paraphrase is obtained through an itera-
tive modification process of an original sen-
tence, by asking workers to introduce meaning-
preserving lexical and syntactic changes. At
each round of the iteration, new workers are
presented with the output of the previous iter-
ation in order to increase divergence from the
original sentence. At the end of the process,
only the more divergent paraphrases according
to the Lesk score (Lesk, 1986) are selected. As
for the second phase of T2 creation process,
this year it was carried out by expert annota-
tors, who followed the same criteria used last
year for the crowdsourced tasks, i.e. i) remove
information from the input (paraphrased) sen-
tence and ii) add information from sentences
surrounding T1 in the source article;

3. Each T2 was then paired to the original T1, and
the resulting pairs were annotated with one of
the four entailment judgements. In order to re-
duce the correlation between the difference in
sentences’ length and entailment judgements,
only the pairs where the difference between the
number of words in T1 and T2 (length diff ) was
below a fixed threshold (10 words) were re-
tained.3 The final result is a monolingual En-
glish dataset annotated with multi-directional
entailment judgements, which are well dis-
tributed over length diff values ranging from 0
to 9;

4. In order to create the cross-lingual datasets,
each English T1 was manually translated into

as possible on semantic aspects of the problem, by reduc-
ing the applicability of simple association rules such as IF
length(T1)>length(T2) THEN T1→T2.

four different languages (i.e. Spanish, German,
Italian and French) by expert translators;

5. By pairing the translated T1 with the cor-
responding T2 in English, four cross-lingual
datasets were obtained.

To ensure the good quality of the datasets, all the
collected pairs were cross-annotated and filtered to
retain only those pairs with full agreement in the
entailment judgement between two expert annota-
tors. The final result is a multilingual parallel en-
tailment corpus, where T1s are in 5 different lan-
guages (i.e. English, Spanish, German, Italian, and
French), and T2s are in English. It is worth men-
tioning that the monolingual English corpus, a by-
product of our data collection methodology, will be
publicly released as a further contribution to the re-
search community.

3.2 Dataset statistics

As described in section 3.1, the methodology fol-
lowed to create the training and test sets was the
same except for the crowdsourced tasks. This al-
lowed us to obtain two datasets with the same bal-
ance across the entailment judgements, and to keep
under control the distribution of the pairs for differ-
ent length diff values in each language combination.

Training Set. The training set is composed of
1,000 CLTE pairs for each language combina-
tion, balanced across the four entailment judge-
ments (bidirectional, forward, backward, and
no entailment). As shown in Table 1, our data col-
lection procedure led to a dataset where the major-
ity of the pairs falls in the +5 -5 length diff range
for each language pair (67.2% on average across the
four language pairs). This characteristic is partic-
ularly relevant as our assumption is that such data
distribution makes entailment judgements based on
mere surface features such as sentence length inef-
fective, thus encouraging the development of alter-
native, deeper processing strategies.

Test Set. The test set is composed of 500 entail-
ment pairs for each language combination, balanced
across the four entailment judgements. As shown
in Table 2, also in this dataset the majority of the
collected entailment pairs is uniformly distributed

in the [-5,+5] length diff range (68.1% on average
across the four language pairs).

However, comparing training and test set for
each language pair, it can be seen that while the
Spanish-English and Italian-English datasets are ho-
mogeneous with respect to the length diff feature,
the French-English and German-English datasets
present noticeable differences between training and
test set. These figures show that, despite the consid-
erable effort spent to produce comparable training

and test sets, the ideal objective of a full homogene-
ity between the datasets for these two languages was
difficult to reach.

Complete details about the distribution of the
pairs in terms of length diff for the four cross-
lingual corpora in the test set are provided in Figure
2. Vertical bars represent, for each length diff value,
the proportion of pairs belonging to the four entail-
ment classes.

4 Evaluation metrics and baselines

Evaluation results have been automatically com-
puted by comparing the entailment judgements re-
turned by each system with those manually assigned
by human annotators in the gold standard. The met-
rics used for systems’ ranking is accuracy over the
whole test set, i.e. the number of correct judge-
ments out of the total number of judgements in the
test set. Additionally, we calculated precision, re-
call, and F1 measures for each of the four entail-
ment judgement categories taken separately. These
scores aim at giving participants the possibility to
gain clearer insights into their system’s behaviour on
the entailment phenomena relevant to the task.

To allow comparison with the CLTE-2012 re-
sults, the same three baselines were calculated on the
CLTE-2013 test set for each language combination.
The first one is the 0.25 accuracy score obtained by
assigning each test pair in the balanced dataset to
one of the four classes. The other two baselines con-
sider the length difference between T1 and T2:

• Composition of binary judgements (Bi-
nary). To calculate this baseline an SVM
classifier is trained to take binary en-
tailment decisions (“YES”, “NO”). The
classifier uses length(T1)/length(T2) and
length(T2)/length(T1) as features respectively
to check for entailment from T1 to T2 and vice-
versa. For each test pair, the unidirectional
judgements returned by the two classifiers are
composed into a single multi-directional judge-
ment (“YES-YES”=“bidirectional”, “YES-
NO”=“forward”, “NO-YES”=“backward”,
“NO-NO”=“no entailment”);

• Multi-class classification (Multi-class). A
single SVM classifier is trained with the same
features to directly assign to each pair one of
the four entailment judgements.

Both the baselines have been calculated with the
LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011), using de-
fault parameters. Baseline results are reported in Ta-
ble 3.

Although the four CLTE datasets are derived from
the same monolingual EN-EN corpus, baseline re-
sults present slight differences due to the effect of

translation into different languages. With respect to
last year’s evaluation, we can observe a slight drop
in the binary classification baseline results. This
might be due to the fact that the length distribution
of examples is slightly different this year. How-
ever, there are no significant differences between the
multi-class baseline results of this year in compar-
ison with the previous round results. This might
suggest that multi-class classification is a more ro-
bust approach for recognizing multi-directional en-
tailment relations. Moreover, both baselines failed
in capturing the “no-entailment” examples in all
datasets (F1no−entailment = 0).

Binary 0.35 0.39 0.37 0.39
Multi-class 0.43 0.44 0.42 0.42

Table 3: Baseline accuracy results.

5 Submitted runs and results

Like in the 2012 round of the CLTE task, partici-
pants were allowed to submit up to five runs for each
language combination. A total of twelve teams reg-
istered for participation and downloaded the train-
ing set. Out of them, six4 submitted valid runs.
Five teams produced submissions for all the four
language combinations, while one team participated
only in the DE-EN task. In total, 61 runs have been
submitted and evaluated (16 for DE-EN, and 15 for
each of the other language pairs).

Accuracy results are reported in Table 4. As can
be seen from the table, the performance of the best
systems is quite similar across the four language
combinations, with the best submissions achieving
results in the 43.4-45.8% accuracy interval. Simi-
larly, also average and median results are close to
each other, with a small drop on DE-EN. This drop
might be explained by the difference between the
training and test set with respect to the length diff
feature. Moreover, the performance of DE-EN auto-
matic translation might affect approaches based on
“pivoting”, (i.e. addressing CLTE by automatically
translating T1 in the same language of T2, as de-
scribed in Section 6).

Table 4: CLTE-2013 accuracy results (61 runs) over the
4 language combinations. Highest, average, median and
lowest scores are calculated considering only the best run
for each team (*task organizers’ system).

Compared to the results achieved last year, shown
in Table 5, a sensible decrease in the highest scores
can be observed. While in CLTE-2012 the top sys-
tems achieved an accuracy well above 0.5 (with a
maximum of 0.632 in SP-EN), the results for this
year are far below such level (the peak is now at
45,8% for FR-EN). A slight decrease with respect
to 2012 can also be noted for average performances.
However, it’s worth remarking the general increase
of the lowest and median scores, which are less sen-
sitive to isolate outstanding results achieved by sin-
gle teams. This indicates that a progress in CLTE
research has been made building on the lessons
learned after the first round of the initiative.

To better understand the behaviour of each sys-
tem, Table 6 provides separate precision, recall, and
F1 scores for each entailment judgement, calculated
over the best runs of each participating team. In
contrast to CLTE-2012, where the “bidirectional”
and “no entailment” categories consistently proved
to be more problematic than “forward” and “back-
ward” judgements, this year’s results are more ho-
mogeneous across the different classes. Neverthe-
less, on average, the classification of “bidirectional”
pairs is still worse for three language pairs (SP-EN,
IT-EN and FR-EN), and results for “no entailment”

are lower for two of them (SP-EN and DE-EN).

SP-EN IT-EN FR-EN DE-EN
Highest 0.632 0.566 0.570 0.558
Average 0.440 0.411 0.408 0.408

Lowest 0.274 0.326 0.296 0.296

Table 5: CLTE-2012 accuracy results. Highest, average,
median and lowest scores are calculated considering only
the best run for each team.

As regards the comparison with the baselines,
this year’s results confirm that the length diff -based
baselines are hard to beat. More specifically, most
of the systems are slightly above the binary classi-
fication baseline (with the exception of the DE-EN
dataset where only two systems out of six outper-
formed it), whereas for all the language combina-
tions the multi-class baseline was beaten only by the
best participating system.

This shows that, despite the effort in keeping the
distribution of the entailment classes uniform across
different length diff values, eliminating the correla-
tion between sentence length and correct entailment
decisions is difficult. As a consequence, although
disregarding semantic aspects of the problem, fea-
tures considering length information are quite ef-
fective in terms of overall accuracy. Such features,
however, perform rather poorly when dealing with
challenging cases (e.g. “no-entailment”), which are
better handled by participating systems.

6 Approaches

A rough classification of the approaches adopted by
participants can be made along two orthogonal di-
mensions, namely:

• Pivoting vs. Cross-lingual. Pivoting meth-
ods rely on the automatic translation of one of
the two texts (either single words or the en-
tire sentence) into the language of the other
(typically English) in order perform monolin-
gual TE recognition. Cross-lingual methods
assign entailment judgements without prelim-
inary translation.

• Composition of binary judgements vs.
Multi-class classification. Compositional ap-
proaches map unidirectional (“YES”/“NO”)

entailment decisions taken separately into sin-
gle judgements (similar to the Binary baseline
in Section 4). Methods based on multi-class
classification directly assign one of the four en-
tailment judgements to each test pair (similar to
our Multi-class baseline).

In contrast with CLTE-2012, where the combina-
tion of pivoting and compositional methods was the
option adopted by the majority of the approaches,
this year’s solutions do not show a clear trend. Con-
cerning the former dimension, participating systems
are equally distributed in cross-lingual and pivoting
methods relying on external automatic translation
tools. Regarding the latter dimension, in addition
to compositional and multi-class strategies, also al-
ternative solutions that leverage more sophisticated
meta-classification strategies have been proposed.

Besides the recourse to MT tools (e.g. Google
Translate), other tools and resources used by partic-
ipants include: WordNet, word alignment tools (e.g.
Giza++), part-of-speech taggers (e.g. Stanford POS
Tagger), stemmers (e.g. Snowball), machine learn-
ing libraries (e.g. Weka, SVMlight), parallel corpora
(e.g. Europarl), and stopword lists. More in detail:

ALTN [cross-lingual, compositional] (Turchi
and Negri, 2013) adopts a supervised learning
method based on features that consider word align-
ments between the two sentences obtained with
GIZA++ (Och et al., 2003). Binary entailment
judgements are taken separately, and combined into
final CLTE decisions.

BUAP [pivoting, multi-class and meta-
classifier] (Vilariño et al., 2013) adopts a pivoting
method based on translating T1 into the language of

31



T2 and vice versa (using Google Translate5). Sim-
ilarity measures (e.g. Jaccard index) and features
based on n-gram overlap, computed at the level of
words and part of speech categories, are used (either
alone or in combination) by different classification
strategies including: multi-class, a meta-classifier
(i.e. combining the output of 2/3/4-class classifiers),
and majority voting.

CELI [cross-lingual, meta-classifier]
(Kouylekov, 2013) uses dictionaries for word
matching, and a multilingual corpus extracted
from Wikipedia for term weighting. A variety of
distance measures implemented in the RTE system
EDITS (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010; Negri et
al., 2009) are used to extract features to train a
meta-classifier. Such classifier combines binary
decisions (“YES”/“NO”) taken separately for each
of the four CLTE judgements.

ECNUCS [pivoting, multi-class] (Jiang and
Man, 2013) uses Google Translate to obtain the En-
glish translation of each T1. After a pre-processing
step aimed at maximizing the commonalities be-
tween the two sentences (e.g. abbreviation replace-
ment), a number of features is extracted to train
a multi-class SVM classifier. Such features con-
sider information about sentence length, text sim-
ilarity/difference measures, and syntactic informa-
tion.

SoftCard [pivoting, multi-class] (Jimenez et al.,
2013) after automatic translation with Google Trans-
late, uses SVMs to learn entailment decisions based
on information about the cardinality of: T1, T2, their
intersection and their union. Cardinalities are com-
puted in different ways, considering tokens in T1 and
T2, their IDF, and their similarity.

Umelb [cross-lingual, pivoting, compositional]
(Graham et al., 2013) adopts both pivoting and
cross-lingual approaches. For the latter, GIZA++
was used to compute word alignments between the
input sentences. Word alignment features are used
to train binary SVM classifiers whose decisions are
eventually composed into CLTE judgements.

7 Conclusion

Following the success of the first round of the Cross-
lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchroniza-

tion task organized within SemEval-2012, a second
evaluation task has been organized within SemEval-
2013. Despite the decrease in the number of partic-
ipants (six teams - four less than in the first round
- submitted a total of 61 runs) the new experience
is still positive. In terms of data, a new test set
has been released, extending the old one with 500
new CLTE pairs. The resulting 1,500 cross-lingual
pairs, aligned over four language combinations (in
addition to the monolingual English version), and
annotated with multiple entailment relations, repre-
sent a significant contribution to the research com-
munity and a solid starting point for further develop-
ments.6 In terms of results, in spite of a significant
decrease of the top scores, the increase of both me-
dian and lower results demonstrates some encour-
aging progress in CLTE research. Such progress is
also demonstrated by the variety of the approaches
proposed. While in the first round most of the
teams adopted more intuitive and “simpler” solu-
tions based on pivoting (i.e. translation of T1 and
T2 in the same language) and compositional entail-
ment decision strategies, this year new ideas and
more complex solutions have emerged. Pivoting and
cross-lingual approaches are equally distributed, and
new classification methods have been proposed. Our
hope is that the large room for improvement, the in-
crease of available data, and the potential of CLTE
as a way to address complex NLP tasks and applica-
tions will motivate further research on the proposed
problem.
