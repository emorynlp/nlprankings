Abstract

In this paper, we describe our system sub-
mitted for the Sentiment Analysis task at Se-
mEval 2013 (Task 2). We implemented a com-
bination of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA)
with Naive Bayes classifier. ESA represents
text as a high dimensional vector of explicitly
defined topics, following the distributional se-
mantic model. This approach is novel in the
sense that ESA has not been used for Senti-
ment Analysis in the literature, to the best of
our knowledge.

1 Introduction

Semantic relatedness measure gives the comparison
of different terms or texts on the basis of their
meaning or the content. For instance, it can be
said that the word ”computer” is semantically
more related to ”laptop” than ”flute”. Sentiment
analysis refers to the task of determining the overall
contextual polarity of the written text. In this paper,
we propose the use of semantic relatedness models,
specifically Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA),
to identify textual polarity. There are different
approaches to model semantic relatedness like
WordNet based models (Banerjee and Banerjee,
2002), distributional semantic models (DSMs) etc.
DSMs follow the distributional hypothesis, which
says that words occurring in the same contexts tend
to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954). There-
fore, considering sentiment classification problem,
distributional hypothesis suggests that the words or
phrases referring to positive polarity would tend to
co-occur, and similar assumptions can be made for

the negative terms.

DSMs generally utilize large textual corpora to
extract the distributional information relying on
the co-occurrence information and distribution of
the terms. These models represent the text in the
form of high-dimensional vectors highlighting the
co-occurrence information. Semantic relatedness
between two given texts is calculated by using
these vectors, thus, following that the the semantic
meaning of a text can be inferred from its usage
in different contexts. There are several different
computational models following distributional
semantics hypothesis. Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et.
al., 2003), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) are
some examples of such models. However, in this
work, we investigated the use of ESA for the given
task of sentiment analysis (SA).

There are two sub-tasks defined in Task 2 at
SemEval 2013 (SemEval, 2013). We participated in
Message Polarity Classification sub-task, where we
are required to automatically classify the sentiment
of a given message into positive, negative, or
neutral. The task deals with the short texts coming
from Twitter and SMS (Short Message Service). We
are provided with 8,000 - 12,000 twitter messages
annotated with their sentiment label for the purpose
of training the models. In this work, we present our
approach for sentiment classification which uses a
combination of ESA and Naive Bayes classifier. The
rest of the paper is structured as follows : Section 2
discusses some related work in this context. Section

3 briefly explains ESA. Section 4 describes our
approaches while Section 5 explains the submitted
runs for our system to the task. Section 6 reports the
results, and we conclude in section 7.

2 Related Work

The research in SA initiated with the classical ma-
chine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Maxi-
mum Entropy etc. using intuitive features like un-
igrams, bigrams, parts of speech information, posi-
tion of words, adjectives etc. (Pang et. al., 2002).
However, such approaches are heavily dependent
upon the given training data, and therefore can be
very limited for SA due to out of vocabulary words
and phrases, and different meanings of words in
different contexts (Pang and Lee, 2008). Due to
these problems, several methods have been investi-
gated to use some seed words for extracting more
positive and negative terms with the help of lexi-
cal resources like WordNet etc., for instance, Senti-
WordNet, which defines the polarity of the word
along with the intensity. In this paper, we model the
sentiment classification using DSMs based on ex-
plicit topic models (Cimiano et. al., 2009), which
incorporate correlation information from a corpus
like Wikipedia, to generalize from a few known pos-
itive or negative terms. There have been some other
attempts to utilize topic models in this regards, but
they mainly focussed on latent topic models (Lin and
He, 2009) (Maas et. al., 2011). Joint sentiment topic
model introduced LDA based unsupervised topic
models in sentiment analysis by pointing out that
sentiments are often topic dependent because same
word/phrase could represent different sentiments for
different topics (Lin and He, 2009). The recent work
by Maas et. al. (Maas et. al., 2011) on using latent
concept models presented a mixture model of un-
supervised and supervised techniques to learn word
vectors capturing semantic term-document informa-
tion along with the sentiment content.

3 Explicit Semantic Analysis

Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is a technique
for computing semantic relatedness between texts
using distributional information (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007). ESA represents text as vec-
tors of concepts explicitly defined by humans, like

Wikipedia articles. This provides an intuitive and
easily understandable topic space for humans, in
contrast to the latent topic space in latent mod-
els.Input texts are represented as multidimensional
vectors of weighted concepts. The procedure of
computing semantic relatedness involves comparing
the vectors corresponding to the given texts e.g. us-
ing cosine product. The magnitude of each dimen-
sion in the vector is the associativity weight of the
text to that explicit concept/dimension. To quantify
this associativity, the textual content related to the
explicit concept/dimension is utilized. This weight
can be calculated by considering different methods,
for instance, tf-idf score. ESA has been proved to
be a generalized vector space model (Gottron et. al.,
2011).

4 Methodology

We implemented a combination of traditional ma-
chine learning based approach for SA using Naive
Bayes algorithm, and ESA based sentiment identifi-
cation. To perform sentiment classification solely
using ESA, we asses the similarity of a new text
against the text whose sentiment is already known,
using ESA. More similar is a text to a particular sen-
timent annotated text, better are its chances to be-
long to the same sentiment class. On the other hand,
we followed a standard classification approach by
learning Naive Bayes over the given training data.
Finally, we consult both ESA and Naive Bayes for
classifying the text. The overall probability of a text
belonging to a particular sentiment class was deter-
mined by weighted sum of ESA similarity score,
and the scores given by Naive Bayes classifier. The
sentiment class with the highest total score was ac-
cepted as the sentiment of the input text. The indi-
vidual weights of ESA and Naive Bayes were deter-
mined by linear regression for our experiments.

5 System Description

We created three bags of words (BOW) correspond-
ing to the different sentiment classes (positive,
negative, and neutral) annotated in the training
data. These BOWs were used as the definition of
the particular sentiment class for making the ESA
comparisons, and for learning Naive Bayes. We
used unigrams and bigrams as features for the Naive

replicated from the version available on Github1,
replacing the Wikipedia dump by the version
released in February 2013.

We submitted two runs each for Twitter and
SMS test data. The first run (constrained) used
only the provided training data for learning while
the second run (unconstrained) used a combination
of external training data coming from the popular
movie review dataset (Pang et. al., 2002), and the
data provided with the task.

6 Results and discussion

The first four entries provided in the table 1 corre-
spond to the four runs submitted in SemEval-2013
Task 2. The fifth entry corresponds to the results
of a separate experiment performed by us, to esti-
mate the influence of ESA on SA. According to the
F-scores, ESA is unable to identify the sentiment in
the texts following the mentioned approach. The re-
sults suggest that combining Naive Bayes to the sys-
tem improved the overall scores. However, even the
combined system could not perform well. Also, the
mixing of external data lowered the scores indicat-
ing incompatibility of the external training data with
the provided data.

7 Conclusion

We presented an approach of using ESA for senti-
ment classification. The submitted system follow
a combination of standard Naive Bayes model and
ESA based classification. The results of the task
suggests that the approach we used for ESA based
classification is unable to identify the sentiment ac-
curately. As a future step, we plan to investigate

more on the usability of ESA for sentiment classifi-
cation, for instance, by using suitable features in the
concept definitions, and weighing them according to
the different sentiment classes.
