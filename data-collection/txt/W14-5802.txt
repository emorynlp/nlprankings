Abstract
Having access to large lexical and grammatical resources when creating a new language resource
is essential for its enhancement and enrichment. This paper describes the interplay and interac-
tive utilization of different language technology tools and resources, in particular the Swedish
lexicon SALDO and Swedish Constructicon, in the creation of Swedish FrameNet. We show
how integrating resources in a larger infrastructure is much more than the sum of the parts.

1 Introduction

This paper describes how Swedish language technology resources are exploited to construct Swedish
FrameNet (SweFN),1 a lexical-semantic resource that has been expanded from and constructed in line
with Berkeley FrameNet (BFN). The resource has been developed within the framework of the theory
of Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1985). According to this theory, semantic frames including their partic-
ipants represent cognitive scenarios as schematic representations of events, objects, situations, or states
of affairs. The participants are called frame elements (FEs) and are described in terms of semantic roles
such as AGENT, LOCATION, or MANNER. Frames are evoked by lexical units (LUs) which are pairings
of lemmas and meanings.

To get a visualization of the notion of semantic frames consider the frame Vehicle landing. It
has the following definition in BFN: “A flying VEHICLE comes to the ground at a GOAL in a controlled
fashion, typically (but not necessarily) operated by an operator.” VEHICLE and GOAL are the core
elements that together with the description uniquely characterize the frame. Their semantic types are
Physical object and Location. The non-core elements of the frame are: CIRCUMSTANCES, COTHEME,
DEGREE, DEPICTIVE, EVENT DESCRIPTION, FREQUENCY, GOAL CONDITIONS, MANNER, MEANS,
MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, PATH, PERIOD OF ITERATIONS, PLACE, PURPOSE, RE ENCODING,
SOURCE, and TIME. The lexical units evoking the frame are: land.v, set down.v, and touch down.v. In
addition, the frame contains a number of example sentences which are annotated in terms of LUs and
FEs. These sentences carry valence information about different syntactic realizations of the FEs and
about their semantic characteristics.

Currently SweFN contains around 1,150 frames with over 29,000 lexical units of which 5,000 are
verbs, and also 8,300 semantically and syntactically annotated sentences, selected from a corpus.

SweFN has mainly been created manually, but as a response to an ever increasing complexity, volume,
and specialization of textual evidence, the creation of SweFN is enhanced with automated Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) techniques. In contrast to the construction of English resources, as well as the
construction of framenets for other languages, the resources used to construct SweFN are all linked in a
unique infrastructure of language resources.

2 The development of framenets in other languages

FrameNet-like resources have been developed in several languages and have been exploited in a range
of NLP applications such as semantic parsing (Das et al., 2014), information extraction (Moschitti et

al., 2003), natural language generation (Roth and Frank, 2009), and semi-automatic disambiguation of
polysemous words (Alonso et al., 2013).

Currently the most active framenet research teams are working on Swedish FrameNet (SweFN) (Borin
et al., 2010; Heppin and Gronostaj, 2014), Japanese FrameNet (JFN) covering 565 frames, 8,500 LUs,
and 60,000 annotated example sentences (Ohara, 2013) and FrameNet Brazil (Br-FN) for Brazilian Por-
tuguese (Torrent, 2013) covering 179 frames, 196 LUs, and 12,100 annotated sentences.2

Even though the point of departure for all FrameNet-like resources is BFN, they differ in a number of
important aspects. SweFN has focused on transferring frames and populating them with LUs. For each
frame there are annotated example sentences extracted from corpora. Sentences illustrate the instanti-
ation of a number of LUs and FEs with regard to the frame, but many LUs do not yet have associated
example sentences. BFN and Spanish FrameNet (Subirats, 2009) also use isolated corpus sentences for
annotation while the SALSA project for German (Burchardt et al., 2009) has the aim of creating full-text
annotation of a German corpus. JFN, Spanish FrameNet, and FN-Br all use BFN software to construct
frames, while SweFN uses its own software and tools. Even though JFN uses BFN software and an-
notations tools for as much compatibility with BFN as possible, the Japanese writing system differs
considerably from that of English, and several modifications have been necessary to handle the different
character systems and word boundary issues.

Most framenets have the intention of covering general language. However, there are domain spe-
cific resources such as, the Copa 2014 FrameNet Brasil, a multilingual resource for the language of
soccer and tourism (Torrent et al., 2014) covering Portuguese, English and Spanish. Bertoldi and de
Oliveira Chishman (2011) describe work buiding a FrameNet-like ontology for the language of criminal
justice contrasting the differences between English and Portuguese languages and legal cultures.

3 Lexical and grammatical resources and tools for Swedish

Swedish FrameNet is part of SweFN++, a larger project with the goal to create a multifaceted panchronic
lexical macro-structure for Swedish to be used as an infrastructure component for Swedish language
technology and development of NLP applications and annotated corpora. One goal of SweFN++ is to
re-use and enhance existing in-house and external lexical resources and harmonize them into a single
macro-structure for processing both modern and historic Swedish text (Borin et al., 2010). Another goal
is to release all SweFN++ resources under an open content license.

3.1 SALDO – association lexicon
SALDO (Borin et al., 2013a)3 is a Swedish association lexicon which contains morphological and
lexical-semantic information for more than 131,000 entries, of which around 10% are verbs. SALDO en-
tries are arranged in a hierarchical structure capturing semantic closeness between lexemes. Each lexical
entry of SALDO has a unique identifier. Each lexical entry, except 41 top nodes, also has a main descrip-
tor, which may be complemented with a second determinative descriptor. These descriptors are other,
more central, entries from SALDO. The SALDO entry for the noun flaska ‘bottle’, with its descriptors,
is shown in figure 1.

SALDO is the pivot of all the Swedish lexical language technology resources maintained at
Språkbanken. Having one pivot resource makes it possible for all Språkbanken resources to be com-
patible with each other (Borin and Forsberg, 2014).

3.2 Swedish Constructicon
The Swedish Constructicon (SweCcn)4 is an electronic database of Swedish constructions (Lyngfelt
et al., 2012; Sköldberg et al., 2013). Just as it is precursor the Berkeley Constructicon,5 it builds on
experiences from Construction Grammar and is historically, methodologically and theoretically closely
related to Frame Semantics and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2012). While framenets map single lexical

Figure 1: A search for the noun flaska ‘bottle’ in SALDO shows that it only has one sense. We are also
shown the lemma, the part of speech, the primary descriptor förvara ‘store.v’, the secondary descriptor
hälla ‘pour.v’, and finally primary and secondary children, that is entries which have flaska as primary
or secondary descriptor.

units to the frames they evoke, a constructicon deals with the pairing of form and meaning in more
complex linguistic units, typically (partially) schematic multiword units that cannot easily be referred to
by either grammatical or lexicographic descriptions alone.

In SweCcn each construction is described individually in a construction entry, defined by its spe-
cific characteristics in form, meaning, function, and distribution. Each entry includes a free text def-
inition, schematic structural description, definitions of construction elements (CEs) and annotated ex-
ample sentences. Since the constructicon must account for both form and meaning, the construc-
tion elements can be both semantic roles and syntactic constituents. For example, the construction
reflexiv resultativ, instantiated in äta sig mätt ‘eat oneself full’, is defined as a verb phrase
where somebody (ACTOR) or something (THEME) performs an action (ACTIVITY) that leads to a result
which affects the ACTOR/THEME, expressed with a reflexive particle. The construction roughly means
“achieve something by V-ing”, and can be applied to both transitive and intransitive verbs, altering the
verbs’ inherent valence restrictions. The syntactic structure of the construction is [V refl AP], and the
construction elements are defined as the semantic roles ACTOR, THEME, ACTIVITY and RESULT, as
well as the reflexive particle. Example sentences like dricka sig full ‘drink oneself drunk’ and springa
sig varm ‘run oneself warm’ are added to the entry, while an example like känna sig trött ‘feel tired’
does not fit since one doesn’t get tired by feeling.

Swedish Constructicon is developed as an extension of Swedish FrameNet and forms a part of the
SweFN++ infrastructure. Swedish Constructicon currently consists of about 300 construction entries,
ranging from general linguistic patterns to partially fixed expressions, of which a significant part are con-
structions in the borderland between grammar and lexicon, commonly neglected from both perspectives.

3.3 Karp – open lexical infrastructure
Karp is an open lexical infrastructure with three main functions: (1) support the creation, cura-
tion, and mutual integration of the lexical resources of SweFN++; (2) publish all lexical resources at
Språkbanken, making them searchable and downloadable in various formats such as Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF) (Francopoulo et al., 2006), and Resource Description Framework (RDF) (Lassila
and Swick, 1999); (3) offer advanced editing functionalities with support for exploitation of corpora
resources (Borin et al., 2013b).

There are 21 resources with over 700,000 lexical entries available in Karp. Since all resources uti-
lize the lexical entries of SALDO, a large amount of information becomes accessible when performing
simple searches. For example when we look up the SALDO entry flaska..1 ‘bottle’, we find information
about the synset from Swesaurus,6 a WordNet-like Swedish resource, as well as synset and sense from
Princeton WordNet,7 syntactic valence from PAROLE,8 identifier from Loan Typology Wordlist (LWT),9

the lexical ID from Lexin,10 etc. Each of these resources is in turn linked to mono- and multi-lingual
information that can be exploited by any other resource or application.

3.4 Korp – Swedish corpora

Korp is a Swedish corpus search interface developed at Språkbanken. It provides access to over 1.6
billion tokens from both modern and historic Swedish texts (Borin et al., 2012; Ahlberg et al., 2013).
The interface allows advanced searches and comparisons between different corpora, all automatically
annotated with dependency structure using MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).

One functionality provided by Korp is Related Words. This shows a list of words fetched from SALDO
which are semantically related to the search term. Only words that actually occur in the corpora are
retrieved by this function. By clicking on one of these, a new corpus search is done with this word as
search term (Borin et al., 2012). Another functionality in Korp is Word Picture which uses statistical
data to select typical examples illustrating collocational semantic relations for chosen expressions. This
query system extracts frequent collocations of the word in question along with an analysis of the parts-
of-speech of the collocating words.

4 The development of SweFN

As described by the BFN research team, manual construction of a framenet resource involves several
steps, including defining frames and frame elements, collecting appropriate lexical units for the frames,
comparing the findings with printed dictionaries, extracting syntactic and collocational contexts to illus-
trate the frame, and analyzing sentences to explore the use of LUs (Fillmore et al., 2003).

The work procedure of SweFN is based on transfer of information from BFN. To a large extent we
follow the BFN development process, but the development of SweFN differs in three crucial aspects:
(1) when we transfer frames from BFN to Swedish, there is usually no need to re-define them. How-
ever, the frames are checked for compatibility with Swedish language and culture; (2) our inventory of
LUs is derived from the SALDO lexicon; (3) we utilize in-house resources, all linked in the Swedish
infrastructure for language technology, SweFN++.

Taking BFN as a starting point saves time and effort in developing frames. Most of the effort goes
to figure out what SALDO entries evoke which frames and to find suitable example sentences. In order
to find appropriate LUs evoking a particular frame we consult: (1) the lexical resources in Karp (see
section 4.3); (2) printed dictionaries; (3) the corpus infrastructure Korp for concordance search in order to
investigate additional uses of the words. This process occasionally results in new frames or modification
of the frames of BFN (see section 4.4).

4.1 SALDO

The manual process of constructing a SweFN frame begins with choosing a frame from BFN or word of
interest. When we create a frame equivalent to one which already exists in BFN, we transfer the frame
features which are more or less language independent from the BFN frame to the SweFN frame. These
features include frame description, frame-to-frame relations, and FEs. We then search for appropriate
SALDO entries evoking the frame as well as example sentences for annotation. If suitable entries exist
in SALDO they are chosen for use as LUs. Otherwise we suggest entries to be added to SALDO (Borin
et al., 2013a). Each SALDO sense is allowed to populate only one SweFN frame except in a few cases
where some inflectional forms evoke one frame and other forms another frame.

When we instead use a word or expression as a starting point we look up all senses in SALDO and
systematically add each sense to the frame it evokes. The selection of LUs from SALDO to populate
the frames of SweFN is done in different ways. One method is to determine which of the English LUs
of BFN frames have suitable equivalents in Swedish. Thereafter different types of searches are made
in SALDO. For example, working on the frame Containers, having introduced the noun LU flaska
‘bottle’ one can search for entries ending with flaska, thus finding a number of compounds such as cham-
pagneflaska ‘champagne bottle’, droppflaska ‘dropper bottle (med.)’, engångsflaska (one+time+bottle)

10http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/lexin/

11



‘non-returnable bottle’, glasflaska ‘glass bottle’, halvflaska (half+bottle) ‘375ml bottle’, miniatyrflaska
‘miniature bottle’, nappflaska (pacifier+bottle) ‘baby bottle’, sprayflaska (spray+bottle) ‘spray can’, tom-
flaska ‘empty bottle’, vattenflaska ‘water bottle’, värmeflaska (heat+bottle) ‘warm water bottle’, to name
a few. Another method is searching for entries having the LU in question as one of the determiners. For
example, working on the Animal frame, a search may be done on the determiner djur ‘animal’ resulting
in a long list of lexical entries for different species of animals, which may be entered into the frame.

The possibility of doing searches in SALDO as described above, in combination with compounding
being very productive in Swedish, is one reason for the relatively large number of LUs in SweFN.

4.2 Swedish Constructicon

Constructions are more complex linguistic units than words, they are common in use and difficult to ig-
nore when working with authentic text. One way to enrich SweFN with more representative examples of
how to express meaning in language is to include constructions as frame-evoking units in the database.
Currently work is being done on systematically linking constructions in SweCcn with frames in SweFN
(Ehrlemark, 2014), but the task is not as straight-forward as identifying which frame is evoked by a
certain LU. First, not all constructions evoke frames, carrying little meaning from a semantic point of
view. This includes such general patterns as constructions for modification, predication, passive voice
or filler-gap constructions. Second, constructions that potentially correspond with frames do not always
fit the distribution pattern of frame elements described in the target frame. This group includes fig-
urative constructions or constructions that are more, or less, general than the target frame in SweFN.
Constructions which do correspond with frames may be called frame-bearing constructions (Fillmore
et al., 2012). A frame-bearing construction evokes a target frame in the same manner as an LU, with
matching construction elements and frame elements.

The linking of constructions with frames is carried out through manual analysis of constructions and
their semantic valence patterns. The work includes paraphrasing the meaning of a construction to identify
which frame or frames it may evoke, and thereafter comparing the construction elements with the FEs of
the target frame. For example, SweCcn includes three constructions for comparisons: jämförelse
‘comparison’, which has the two subordinate constructions jämförelse.likhet ‘compari-
son.similarity’ and jämförelse.olikhet ‘comparison.difference’ – all three are Swedish equiva-
lents of corresponding constructions in the Berkeley Constructicon (Bäckström et al., 2014). In all three
cases the CEs in the construction entries correspond to the FEs in the Evaluative comparison
frame which has the following definition: a PROFILED ITEM is compared to a STANDARD ITEM with re-
spect to some ATTRIBUTE. By establishing a link between, in this case the comparison constructions
and the Evaluative comparison frame, we may enrich the frame with typical example sentences
such as Hennes cykel är bättre än min ‘Her bicycle is better than mine’ and Popband är lika arga som
rockband ‘Popbands are as angry as rockbands’.

Another example is the pair of constructions proportion i om and proportion per, which
distinguish different syntactic patterns for expressing proportion in Swedish. In both cases,
the construction combines two entities, a numerator and a denominator, joined by a preposi-
tion. However, they differ regarding domain of use, preposition used, and definiteness of the
second noun phrase. The construction proportion i om describes time, and therefore cor-
responds to frames that express proportion in relation to time units, such as Frequency and
Speed description. The construction proportion per is a more general construction
that expresses Frequency and Speed description as well as other ratio relations as de-
scribed in the frames Relational quantity, Rate quantification, Proportion, and
Price per unit. Thus, a link between SweFN and SweCcn may refer the user to correct Swedish
constructions for ratio relations from the frames they evoke.

At the time of writing, about half of the entries in SweCcn are linked to frames in SweFN. The
continuing work with comparing and linking the two resources does not aim to link all constructions
with frames, but rather to distinguish frame-bearing from non-frame-bearing constructions. The linking
allows the user to easily go between a construction and the frame or frames it evokes and correspondingly

12



from a frame to constructions evoking the frame. In this way, both SweCcn and SweFN become more
representative of the language they set out to describe and better incorporated for future pedagogical and
language technological uses.

4.3 Karp

As well as being the editing tool used to build SweFN and other resources, Karp is an important tool
for accessing information. Searching on any expression, word form or lemma results in a display of
every occurrence in all SweFN++ resources, except instances in the corpus. This gives, for example, an
overview of different senses of polysemous words, in which resources they have been entered and how.
Thus, we can see which SweFN frames are evoked by different senses of a word, we can see synonymous
words in Swesaurus (Borin and Forsberg, 2014), the morphology of the word as well as multiword units
containing this word in SALDO, samples of sentences from Korp where the chosen word occurs, and
constructions in Swedish Constructicon which use this word (Lyngfelt et al., 2012).

SweFN developers use Karp to find SALDO entries that evoke a particular frame, SweCcn developers
use Karp to find frames evoked by constructions, or constructions that evoke frames. Figure 2 shows an
example of a view in Karp. In this particular view SweFN and SweCcn resources were selected, but other
choices are also possible. The combination of searches shown here are in turn for a certain construction
or frame (two first boxes), for constructions that match a certain frame (third box). This particular search
is for constructions that match Similarity, which here resulted in 14 different constructions, each
of which contained potential patterns which in turn could be used to perform new searches in Korp.
Finally, in the fourth box the search is for a particular SALDO sense, and in the fifth box for a certain
LU. Searches for other types of units such as frame elements, etc. are also possible.

Figure 2: The Karp editing tool provides various functionalities to extract information from a number
of different lexical resources. The combination of searches above is selected to illustrate the variety of
possibilities in Karp.

13



4.4 Korp
The Korp corpora and search interface serve several purposes in the creation of SweFN. The coverage
of lexical variation found in corpora is much larger than the variation we find in a lexicon and this helps
in defining senses of polysemous words. From the corpora, example sentences are extracted to illustrate
valence structures of LUs evoking frames. Korp extended search allows searches that combine SweFN
LUs and syntactic structures of SweCcn constructions. The Related Words function provides a method of
easily expanding the set of LUs populating a frame and giving easy access to example sentences where
lexical variations are observed. Word Picture offers guidance in disambiguation as of LUs well as in
analyzing semantic and syntactic structures.

Korp is a useful tool to check for compatibility with Swedish language and culture. Extended searches
help us modify BFN frames and create new frames. There are two situations when BFN frames have
been modified for SweFN (Heppin and Gronostaj, 2014): (1) the BFN frames are not suitable because
of linguistic or cultural differences. For example the BFN frame Jury deliberation has been re-
defined to Deliberation in SweFN. In Deliberation the FE corresponding to the FE JURY in
BFN is changed to DELIBERATION GROUP seeing that there is no jury in the Swedish legal process
and a more general frame is appropriate as it covers deliberations in different kinds of legal systems;
(2) the BFN frames are too general for our purposes, for example Sound makers in BFN corresponds
to two more specific frames in SweFN: Noise makers and Musical instruments. Completely
new frames have also been created when there is a need for a frame not yet created for BFN. SweFN, for
example, has a greater emphasis on nominal LUs than framenets for other languages. Therefore, frames
such as Animals, Countries, and Plants have been created.

After determining the appropriate pairing of SALDO units and SweFN frames, searches are made for
example sentences manifesting these LUs in the Korp corpora. The sentences we aim to find should have
a variation of valence structure to give a broad overall picture of the LU patterns.

Figure 3: Word picture from Korp of the verb bygga ‘build’ in present tense, e.g. bygger. The columns
display from left to right subjects, objects, and adverbials. The number to the right in each column is the
frequency of the collocation in Korp.

Word Picture is useful when taking a starting point in individual, polysemous words, to determine
which frames are evoked by the different senses. In figure 3 items, which are listed in subject and object

14



positions respectively, highlight two different senses of the verb bygga ‘build’, one abstract and one
concrete sense. The nouns found in subject position, such as film ‘film’, system ‘system’, undersökning
‘examination’, metod ‘method’, rapport ‘report’, etc., occur with the sense of bygga ‘build’ which is
typically found in an abstract intransitive construction with the preposition på ‘on’ as in ‘founded on’,
‘built on’, or ‘based on’. This sense evokes the Use as a starting point frame. The nouns in the
object position, such as hus ‘house’ and bro ‘bridge’, collocate with the agentive verb bygga ‘build’ in
the concrete sense of ‘construct’ or ‘erect’, which evokes the Building frame (Heppin and Gronostaj,
2014).

5 Consistency checks and automatic extension of the data

There is no gold standard to evaluate the quality of SweFN against as there is no other comparable
resource. FrameNet-like resources for other languages are constructed with different foci and under
different conditions. However, there is a constant assessment of the correctness of the resources built
into the workflow and ongoing consistency checks to avoid inconsistency between resources. The Karp
tool gives error messages, for example when SALDO entries are listed in more than one frame. Other
types of checks are run with certain intervals, for example to see if there are annotation tags which do not
follow the standard format. Confronted with different types of error messages the developers go back to
the frames in question to revise the contents of the frame, such as which LUs are said to evoke the frame,
or the choice of and annotation of example sentences.

One part of the work is directed towards developing computational methods to facilitate the man-
ual construction of SweFN. We have so far focused on three tasks: (1) semantic role labeling (SRL)
(Johansson et al., 2012); (2) automatic sentence extraction, i.e. finding example sentences with varied
syntactic and semantic complexities (Pilán et al., 2013); (3) automatic expansion of the SweFN lexicon
to determine which frame is evoked by a given word by combining statistical and rule-based methods
based on SALDO descriptors and extracted information from Korp (Johansson, 2014).

6 Conclusions

The building of one big macro-resource for Swedish language technology, where the individual resources
interact with and enhance each other, provides a unique overview of the Swedish language. One search
on a lexical expression results in a list of descriptions from all of the separate resources. The information
derived is not only useful for the end user, but also for the continuing work on all parts of the linguistic
macro-structure.

We have here focused on how two language technology resources, SALDO and SweCcn, are exploited
in the development of SweFN, but also on how these resources enhance each other and other resources.
We mainly address the manual perspectives of the workflow, illustrating what data may derive from the
different resources, how this data may be used to facilitate work, and how the contents of one resource
may reappear in the contents of another. We have given a sketch of the language technology tools with
the aim to reveal their potential importance in the development of SweFN.

The construction of SweFN, and even more so the construction of a macro-resource such as SweFN++,
will continue to develop in the foreseeable future. New insights as well as new problems will continue
to give rise to changes.
