Abstract

In the last decade, substantial progress has
been made in the induction of semantic rela-
tions from raw text, especially of hypernymy
and meronymy in the English language and
in the classification of noun-noun relations in
compounds or other contexts. We investigate
the question of learning qualia-like semantic
relations that cross part-of-speech boundaries
for German, by first introducing a hand-tagged
dataset of associated noun-verb pairs for this
task, and then provide classification results us-
ing a general framework for supervised classi-
fication of lexical relations.

1 Introduction

Ever since the introduction of wordnets (Miller
and Fellbaum, 1991) or more generally machine-
readable dictionaries containing semantic relations,
researchers have investigated ways to learn such ex-
amples automatically from large text corpora, or
generalize them from existing instances. Substan-
tial research exists on the learning of hyperonymy
relations (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2005; Tjong
Kim Sang and Hofmann, 2009), meronymy relations
(Hearst, 1998; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju
et al., 2003) and selectional preferences (Erk et al.,
2010; Bergsma et al., 2008; Ó Séaghdha, 2010).

Both lexicographic research (Chaffin and Her-
rmann, 1987; Morris and Hirst, 2004) and research
in cognitive psychology (Vigliocco et al., 2004;
McRae et al., 2005), argue that it is important to
consider relations beyond the classical inventory

of hyperonymy and meronymy relations; further-
more psychological research on priming (Hare et al.,
2009) suggests different processing for different re-
lations, which would entail that cognitively plau-
sible modeling of human language should model
these relations explicitly rather than simply record-
ing untyped associations between concepts (as in the
‘evocation’ relation proposed for WordNet by Boyd-
Graber et al., 2006).

One set of suggestions for an extended inventory
of relations can be found in the telic and agentive
qualia relations of Pustejovsky (1991) which have
been shown to be useful in recognizing discourse re-
lations (Wellner et al., 2006), or metonymy/coercion
phenomena (Verspoor, 1997; Rüd and Zarcone,
2011), and have the property of linking different
parts-of-speech groups, unlike meronymy and hy-
peronymy/troponymy.

The work we present in this paper consists of a
dataset of noun-verb associations for German con-
crete nouns, which we present in more detail in sec-
tion 3, and a state-of-the-art approach to the super-
vised classification of such cross-part-of-speech re-
lations using informative features from large collec-
tions of unannotated text, which we present in sec-
tion 4. Experimental results are discussed in section
6.

2 Related Work

Most of earlier work on discovering novel instances
of semantic relations was based on surface pattern
matching, as presented by Hearst (1998). In the do-
main of finding qualia relations, Cimiano and Wen-
deroth (2005) propose patterns such as “. . . purpose

12



of X is . . . ” or “. . . X is used to . . . ”, whereas they
argue that agentive qualia are best chosen from a
small, fixed inventory of verbs (e.g., make, bake,
create . . . ). Katrenko and Adriaans (2008a) addi-
tionally propose “to Y a (new|complete) X” and “a
(new|complete) X has been Y’d” as patterns for agen-
tive qualia.

Some of the more recent work starts out from
matches extracted by means of such a pattern, but
use supervised training data to learn semantic con-
straints that improve the precision by filtering the
extracted examples. Berland and Charniak (1999)
use some handcrafted rules to exclude abstract ob-
jects from the part-of relations they extract from a
corpus, and additionally rank pattern extractions by
collocation strength. Girju et al. (2003) propose an
iterative refinement scheme based on taxonomic in-
formation from WordNet: In this learning approach,
general constraints using top-level semantic classes
(entity, abstraction, causal-agent) are passed to a de-
cision tree learner and iteratively refined until the se-
mantic constraints induced from the classes are no
longer ambiguous.

Katrenko and Adriaans (2008b, 2010) present ap-
proaches to learn semantic constraints for the use in
recognizing semantic relations between word tokens
(SemEval 2007 shared task, see Girju et al., 2009),
either in a graph-based generalization of Girju’s it-
erative refinement approach that is able to handle
sense ambiguities more gracefully, or by clustering
pairs of words by the joint similarity of both relation
arguments.

A complementary aspect is to improving recall
beyond the possibilities of a few hand-selected pat-
terns. Following Hearst (1998), Girju et al. (2003)
show that it is possible to find usable patterns by
exploiting known positive examples and looking for
co-occurrences of these relation arguments in a cor-
pus. However, these patterns usually have low preci-
sion and/or very limited recall, meaning that a more
elaborate approach (such as Girju et al.’s induction
of semantic constraints) is needed to make the best
use of them.

Yamada and Baldwin (2004) propose to use a
combination of templates typical of telic and agen-
tive qualia relations (X is worth Y ing, X deserves
Y ing, a well-Y ed X) and a statistical ranking com-
bining association and a classifier learned on pos-

itive and negative examples for that role. They
find that the combination of association statistic and
classification worked somewhat better than the tem-
plates alone.

One approach targeted at exploiting a greater
number of patterns for hyperonymy relations can be
found in the work of Snow et al. (2005): they ex-
tract patterns consisting of the shortest path in the
dependency graph plus an optional satellite and use
the set of all found paths as features in a linear clas-
sifier. The resulting classifier for hyperonymy re-
lations outperforms single patterns both in terms of
precision and in terms of recall; a further improve-
ment can be achieved if the frequency of pattern in-
stances is binned instead of just occurrence or non-
occurrence being recorded.

Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann (2009) investigate
the question whether it is necessary to use syntac-
tic (rather than surface) patterns for the hyperonym
classification approach of Snow et al. They compare
a method of extracting features based on syntax as
in Snow et al.’s approach with a surface-based al-
ternative where the string between two words, plus
optionally one word to the left or right side of the
word, is extracted. Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann
argue that the benefit of the parser (additional recall
due to the better generalization capability of the syn-
tactic patterns) is mostly negated by parsing errors:
In some informative contexts that the system based
on POS patterns is able to find without problems,
parsing errors lead to a parse tree that does not ex-
hibit the intended (dependency path) pattern.

Several researchers have applied such pattern
classification approaches to a larger set of relations,
and have demonstrated that extracting a pattern dis-
tribution between occurrences and performing su-
pervised classification based on this distribution is
a promising solution for semantic relations that go
beyond hyperonymy.

Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2007) use a super-
vised classification approach for noun-noun com-
pounds combining context features for each of the
single words with features characterizing the joint
occurrences of the two nouns that are part of the tar-
get compound. In their experiments, they found that
linear classification using informative (bag-of-words
and bag-of-triples) features in conjunction with fea-
tures aimed at the similarity of each word of the tar-

13



get pair yields good results. In particular, the results
of using a linear classifier with informative corpus-
based features that are quite close to those that can
be achieved using a (more accurate, but computa-
tionally quite expensive) string kernel or those that
Ó Séaghdha (2007) achieves using taxonomic infor-
mation from WordNet.

Turney (2008) presents a general approach for
classifying word pairs into semantic relations by ex-
tracting the strings occurring between the two words
of a pair (up to three words in-between, up to one
word on either side) and using a frequency-based
selection process to select sub-patterns where words
from the extracted context pattern may have been re-
placed by a wildcard. Using standard machine learn-
ing tools (a support vector machine with radial base
function kernel), he is able to reach results that are
close to those possible with previous more special-
ized approaches.

Similarly, Herdağdelen and Baroni (2009) tackle
a variety of problems in semantic relation classifi-
cation using a unified approach where frequent uni-
grams and bigrams are extracted from co-occurrence
contexts of the target word pair (in addition to fea-
tures extracted from general occurrence contexts of
each word). Herdağdelen and Baroni’s approach
uses a linear SVM (which is faster and better-suited
to large data sets in general than either kernelized
support vector machines or nearest-neighbour ap-
proaches) yet is able to reach competitive accuracy.

In contrast to approaches using generic machine
learning, Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2009) and
Nakov and Kozareva (2011) model the similarities
between related word pairs more explicitly in terms
of distributional kernels (Ó Séaghdha and Copes-
take), or as a similarity metric between word pairs
(Nakov and Kozareva). Such approaches allow more
flexibility in the modeling of similarity and the com-
bination of lexical and relational similarity mea-
sures, but are less well-suited for scaling up to more
training data.1

Because of the need for sufficient training data,
purely supervised approaches to learning relations

1Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2009) reports training times
of slightly more than one day for their most efficient method
whereas a ten-fold crossvalidation run using SVMperf – see the
presentation on p. 6 – takes under an hour, i.e., using linear
classification is more efficient by a factor of about 100.

in morphologically-rich languages are often lim-
ited to the classical relations found in wordnets.
Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann (2009) use a Dutch
corpus and hyperonymy relations from the Dutch
Cornetto wordnet and mention relatively few dif-
ferences to approaches on English such as Snow
et al. (2005). Kurc and Piasecki (2008) apply
the semi-supervised approach of Pantel and Pen-
nachiotti (2006) for learning hyperonymy relations,
but modify the patterns used to enforce morphosyn-
tactic agreement and accommodate a more flexi-
ble word order. Versley (2007) uses Web pattern
queries for finding hyperonymy relations and men-
tions the fact that greater morphological richness
and the smaller size of the German Web make the
use of Web queries more complex than for English.

Outside the realm of hyperonymy, Regneri (2006)
uses Web-based pattern search to classify verb-verb
associations into the semantic classes proposed for
English by Chklovski and Pantel (2004). Rüd and
Zarcone (2011) perform a corpus study of patterns
indicative of telic and agentive qualia relations in a
German Web corpus, but perform no automatic clas-
sification.

In summary, the research of Tjong Kim Sang and
Hofmann (2009) seems to indicate that at least hy-
peronymy relations can be found using a shallow
pattern approach despite greater word order flex-
ibility of languages such as Dutch and German.
For cross-part-of-speech relations, such as telic and
agentive qualia, such a question has been unad-
dressed as of yet, which prompted us to create a
dataset that is suitable for such an investigation.

3 Material

In order to investigate general-domain Noun-Verb
relations in German, we first had to create an ap-
propriate dataset that captures a realistic notion of
the relationships that humans infer in a text. Exist-
ing datasets that explore this space (most of them
for English) use a variety of approaches: One ap-
proach starts from examples (such as the popular
analogy dataset for English introduced by Turney
and Littman, 2003); other approaches such as the
data collection for the SemEval task on identifying
relations between nominals (Girju et al., 2009; Hen-
drickx et al., 2010) start from common semantic re-

14



lations and use patterns to gather positive and nega-
tive examples by Web queries.

In our case, we started from noun-verb associa-
tions found in a sample of human-produced asso-
ciations to concrete noun stimuli (Melinger et al.,
2006); starting from the original association data, we
excluded items that were produced by less than three
subjects and used the part-of-speech information at-
tached to the data to retrieve only the verb associates.

The classification scheme was motivated by exist-
ing generative lexicon research (Pustejovsky, 1991;
Lenci et al., 2003), but was modeled to achieve a
good fit to the associations present in the data rather
than to force a good fit to any particular theory.

• agentive relations exist between an artifact and
an event that creates or procures it (e.g. bread-
bake)

• the telic relations exist between an entity and
an event that is related to its purpose or (actual
or intended) role:

– telic-artifact holds between an artifact and
its intended usage (e.g. plane-fly)

– telic-role holds between a role (i.e., a pro-
fession, organizational position etc.) and
activities related to that role (e.g. cowboy-
ride)

– telic-bodypart holds between a body part
and its intended uses (e.g. eye-see)

• the behaviour group of relations hold between
an entity and events that are caused by it, but
are not necessarily intentional or related to a
role that it fulfills:

– behaviour-animate are typical activities
performed by animate entities that are un-
related to the role that they fulfill for hu-
mans (e.g., dog-bark)

– behaviour-artifact relates artifacts to (usu-
ally) unintended behaviour associated
with them (e.g., moped-rattle)

– behaviour-environment relates elements
of the environment to events that go on
around them (e.g., sun-shine)

• location relations hold between elements of the
environment and activities typically performed
in or at them (e.g., mountain-climb)

• grooming relations hold between artifacts and
activities that contribute to the readiness of an
artifact (or body part) for its intended use but
are not directly related to it (e.g., plant-water,
hair-dye)

In comparison to standard schemes such as SIM-
PLE (Lenci et al., 2003), we have extended the set of
telic and agentive qualia from the original generative
lexicon approach by supplementing it with relations
that describe the affordances of objects or guides the
interpretative linking of objects and events, namely
location for affordances of elements of the environ-
ment and grooming for object-related actions that
may not be necessary for a differently-built object
with that same function, and finally behaviour de-
scribes events that co-occur with objects but are usu-
ally not part of a human agent’s action plan.

As a refinement, we subdivided the telic qualia
and behaviour relations, in particular specifying any
telic relation with the reason a concrete object may
be relevant for goal-directed processing – either by
teleological interpretation of body parts, by the cre-
ation of artifacts with a specific purpose, or the es-
tablishment of roles with social conventions sup-
porting certain types of actions.

Among the responses collected by Melinger et al.
(2006), we found relatively few instances that were
genuinely ambiguous (Drachen - fliegen, which may
either be interpreted as ‘kite/fly’, in which case it
would be a telic-artifact relation, or as ‘dragon/fly’,
in which case it would be a behaviour-animate rela-
tion), but found that domestic animals (cows, horses,
dogs) have affordances such as horse-ride or dog-
bark that indicate they are conceptualized as instru-
ments serving a particular goal (which means that
the relation should be labeled as telic-artifact rather
than as behaviour-animate).

In the associated word pairs, we also found re-
lations such as Zwiebel-schneiden (‘onion-cut’) or
Handtuch-duschen (‘towel-shower’) where the ac-
tion is related to a thing’s purpose but not identical
to it (towels are used to dry yourself after showering,
and people acquire onions to eat them after having
cut them). Our initial annotation included a com-
bination between the qualia-like relations presented
here and an additional event-semantic relation link-
ing the elicited event and the intended affordance of

15



the object. However, the event relation was left out
of the dataset used in the experiments to avoid data
sparsity.

In our dataset with 641 items, the most fre-
quent relations are telic-artifact (425 instances),
behaviour-animate (94 instances), telic-role (35 in-
stances), telic-bodypart (24 instances). The other re-
lations have between 2 and 17 instances each (see
table 3). The relationship data is therefore heavily
skewed.

4 Classification Approach

Our classification approach is aimed at a practi-
cal toolkit for supervised classification of lexical-
semantic relations, similar in spirit to the BagPack
approach of Herdağdelen and Baroni (2009) but
adapted for the use in morphologically-rich lan-
guages, in particular German.

In addition to the surface-based unigram and bi-
gram features, we use features based on dependency
syntax, which is more robust against variation in
word order, and allows to reattach separable verb
prefixes.

4.1 Preprocessing

To see why a very shallow approach may be less use-
ful for German, let us consider a simple direct (ac-
cusative) object relation such as between aufessen
(eat up) and Kuchen (cake): this relation could be
realized in a variety of ways depending on clause
type and constituent order, as illustrated in example
(1).

(1) a. Peter isst den Kuchen auf.
Peter eats the cake up.
“Peter eats up the cake”.

b. Den Kuchen hat Peter aufgegessen.
The cakeacc has Peter eaten-up.
“Peter has eaten up the cake”.

c. . . . dass Peter den Kuchen aufisst.
. . . that Peter the cake up-eat.
“. . . that Peter eats up the cake”.

In German, clause type decides whether the verb
is in verb-second position (1a) or at the end of the
clause (1b,1c); additionally, as in (1a), prefixes of
verbs may be stranded at the end of a clause with the
verb in verb-second position.

In addition to morphological analysis, hence, reat-
tachment is necessary in such cases as (1a), and
parsing is necessary to reattach prefix and verb. In
cases such as (1b), word order variation also needs
to be taken into account in order to recover the direct
object relation, unlike in languages with less-flexible
word order.

As a text collection that furnishes contexts for the
words or word pairs that interest us, we use the web-
news corpus, a collection of online news articles col-
lected by Versley and Panchenko (2012). For the
processing of this 1.7 billion word corpus, we use
a pipeline that relies on deterministic dependency
parsing to provide complete dependency parses at a
speed that is suitable for the processing of Web-scale
corpora.

The parsing model is based on MALTParser, a
transition-based parser, and uses part-of-speech and
morphological information as input. Morphological
information is annotated using RFTagger (Schmid
and Laws, 2008), a state-of-the-art morphological
tagger based on decision trees and a large con-
text window (which allows it to model morpho-
logical agreement more accurately than a normal
trigram-based sequence tagger). While transition-
based parsers are quite fast in general, an SVM clas-
sifier (which is used in MALTParser by default) be-
comes slower with increasing training set. In con-
trast, using the MALTParser interface to LibLinear
by Cassel (2009), we were able to reach a much
larger speed of 55 sentences per second (against 0.4
sentences per second for a more feature-rich SVM-
based model that reaches state of the art perfor-
mance).

For lemmatization, we use the syntax-based
TüBa-D/Z lemmatizer (Versley et al., 2010), which
uses a separate morphological analyzer and some
fallback heuristics. The SMOR morphology
(Schmid et al., 2004) serves to provide morpholog-
ical analyses for novel words, covering inflection,
derivation and composition processes. For unana-
lyzed novel words that are not covered by SMOR,
the lemmatizer falls back to surface-based guessing
heuristics. It uses morphological and syntactic in-
formation to provide more accurate lemmas; In ad-
dition to dependency structures, the morphological
tags from RFTagger as well as global frequency in-
formation are used.

4.2 Classification

For classification, we use the following learning
methods:

• For the SVMperf classifier, the set of possible
labels is decomposed into binary problems us-
ing the one-vs-all scheme (for each possible la-
bel, a classifier is trained that receives the in-
stances of this label as positive instances and
the others as negative instances). SVMperf al-
lows the training of models that either optimize
(an upper bound for) the accuracy (SVMacc)
or the f-measure (SVMF) of positive instances
(Joachims, 2005).

• The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier
directly learns the multiclass decision. Here,
we used the AMIS package by Miyao and Tsu-
jii (2002).

All experiments are run in a ten-fold crossvalidation
setup where the data is split ten portions and each
portion (fold) is tagged using a classifier trained on
the remaining nine folds. This setup leads to de-
creased variation

As noted in section 6, SVMperf using optimization
for accuracy (i.e., a standard linear kernel SVM with
hinge loss and a one-versus-all reduction to handle
the multiclass problem) performs best on the two ag-
gregate measures that we used (accuracy and macro-
averaged F). Hence, most results we report in the
later part only use the standard SVM learner.

4.3 Features

The first group of surface-based features uses
a similar technique to Herdağdelen and Baroni
(2009): given the co-occurrences of two words X
and Y with at most 4 words in-between, we extract
frequent unigrams and bigrams. Because we can
maintain the sparsity of the resulting feature vector
(see section 5), we can use a larger list of 10 000
each of the most frequent unigrams and bigrams
(w12) alternatively to a list with only 2 000 entries
each (w12:2k). The lem12 feature uses the same
approach, but uses lemmas instead.

A second group of features uses a path-based
representation based on a modified version of the de-
pendency parse (where the main verb, and not the

auxiliary verb is the head of a clause and is con-
nected to both the subject and its other arguments).

In the path-based representation, we can extract
the (shortest) path between the two target words in
the dependency graph. The rel feature records the
complete path (labeled dependency edges as well
as lemmas of intervening nodes) between the target
words. In contrast, the sat feature records labeled
dependency edges as well as lemmas of the depen-
dents of one of the target words.

Because the rel feature yields relatively large
(and therefore sparse) strings, we also decompose
the dependency path in triples consisting of labeled
dependency edge in the path and the two nodes ad-
jacent to it (with the endpoints replaced by “w1” and
“w2”, respectively) for the triples feature.

In order to emulate the feature extraction of Snow
et al. (2005), we introduce a relsat feature, which
pairs the path (as in the rel feature) with one de-
pendent of either target word. The relsat feature
would be able to model patterns such as “w1 and
other w2”, where a modifier (“other”) is not part of
the shortest dependency path between w1 and w2.

In addition, a feature based on GermaNet (Hen-
rich and Hinrichs, 2010) uses taxonomic informa-
tion: possible hypernyms of the noun and verb in
the pair are extracted, and are used by themselves
(e.g. “noun is a hyponym of ‘thing’ ”, or “verb is a
hyponym of ‘communicate’ ”) and in combinations
of up to two of these possible hypernym labels.

In addition to taxonomic information from Ger-
maNet, we use distributional similarity features
for single words. For the nouns, we use distribu-
tional features based on the co-occurrence of pre-
modifying adjectives, which Versley and Panchenko
(2012) found to work better than other grammatical-
relation-based collocates (attr1), while we use
Padó and Lapata’s (2007) method of gathering and
weighting collocates based on distance in the depen-
dency graph for the verbs (pl2). Herdağdelen and
Baroni (2009) simply use a window-based approach
for gathering collocates, which we reimplemented as
a simpler way of capturing distributional similarity.
The resulting features are named w1 and w2.

Due to the short path between w1 and w2, the triples and

more complicated constructions, the triples approach would

yield multiple simpler features whereas rel would yield one

single complex string.

5 Count Transformations

It is a well-known fact in distributional semantics
that raw observation counts for context items (be
they elements surrounding single word occurrences
or elements extracted from the occurences of two
words together) are incomparable for different target
words/target pairs (since their frequency can differ)
as well as for different context items. As a result, re-
searchers have proposed different approaches to pro-
duce transformed vectors using more sophisticated
association statistics (see Dumais, 1991, Weeds
et al., 2004, Turney and Pantel, 2010, inter alia).

In our case, we implemented L1 normalization
(which normalizes for target word frequency), a con-
servative estimate for pointwise mutual information
(which normalizes for the frequencies of both target
word and feature), and the G2 log-likelihood mea-
sure of Dunning (1993), which gives significance
scores (i.e., numbers that invariably grow both with
target and feature frequency, even if the association
strength – the relation between actual occurrences
and those that would be expected when assuming no
association – is constant). In both cases, very fre-

quent features would be emphasized in comparison
to medium- and low-frequency features.

In the realm of supervised learning, an additional
choice has to be made among learning methods that
can classify words or word pairs using large feature
vectors – most commonly using nearest-neighbour
classification (Nakov and Kozareva, 2011), us-
ing custom kernels in support vector classification
(Ó Séaghdha and Copestake, 2009; Turney, 2008),
or by using appropriate techniques to represent the
feature vectors in linear classification.

In comparison to the former methods, linear clas-
sification scales better with the number of exam-
ples (where nearest-neigbour and kernel-based tech-
niques both show strongly superlinear behaviour)
and would be the method of choice for large-scale
classification.

Herdağdelen and Baroni (2009) propose to map
the values computed by association statistics by
computing mean and standard deviation of each fea-
ture and mapping the range [µ−2σ, µ+2σ] of asso-
ciation scores for that feature (seen over the values
of that feature for all target pairs) to the range [0, 1]
in the input for the classifier, clamping values out-
side that range to 0 or 1, respectively.

Unfortunately, the approach proposed by
Herdağdelen and Baroni has the property that an
association score of 0 is mapped to a non-zero
feature value for the classifier, which means that
feature vectors are no longer sparse (i.e., instead of
only storing non-zero values for context items that
are informative, values for all context items have to
be processed).

To keep the sparsity of the transformed counts,
we always use 0 as the lower bound of the mapping
(such that zero values stay zero values). In addi-
tion to the Herdagdelen and Baroni’s mean/variance-
based threshold, we investigated the following pos-
sibilities for fixing the upper bound:

• MI scale: use a constant upper bound of 1 on (a
conservative estimate of) the pointwise mutual
information.2

2To yield a conservative MI estimate, we use the discounting
factor introduced by Pantel and Lin (2002). The pointwise mu-
tual information value normalizes the frequency of both words
of a pair, hence all mutual information values are on a common
scale. A threshold of 1 in this case corresponds to two items oc-

Table 1: Trivial and single-feature baselines (using SVM-
acc unless noted otherwise)

• norm: use a value based on mean and standard
deviation of the occurring values for one given
feature (µ+ 2σ).

• quant: use a fixed quantile (99%) of all values
for a feature for the upper bound of the map-
ping interval.

In addition, to mapping feature values onto the
unit interval [0, 1], we investigated the usefulness of
making the features binary-valued by mapping all
values lower than the threshold to zero. While intu-
itively a continuous-valued feature should be more
informative, the high dimensionality of the feature
space may mean that noisy feature extraction ulti-
mately leads to a worse model in the continuous-
feature case.

6 Results and Discussion

Because of the skewed distribution, it is useful to
look not only at the overall accuracy (Acc) but also
at the macro-average of the F-measure of all rela-
tions (MacroF). The macro-averaged F-measure re-
flects the ability of the system to recognize all re-

curring together about exp(1) ≈ 2.7 times as often as would be
expected from the marginal distribution for that co-occurrence
relation.

lations since it weighs all relation types equally, in-
stead of (implicitly) weighting by token count where
under-predicting rare relation types normally yields
a higher accuracy. As is evident from table 1, the
accuracy baseline for the most frequent label (telic-
artifact) is already quite high.

Looking at results with various scaling methods
and learners on single features (table 1), we found
that the SVMacc learner consistently yields better
accuracy and macro-averaged F-measure than the
other two learners. For the weighting functions, we
found that none of the measures was consistently
better than the others; results for the single features
in table 1 are reported for a weighting function that
works best for either accuracy or macro-averaged F-
measure using. (For space reasons, table 1 shows
numbers only for the w12 feature and L1-norm scal-
ing; other features and settings show a similar rela-
tion between the scores for different learners).

As in the investigation by Ó Séaghdha and Copes-
take (2007), dependency triples from the path be-
tween the two target words are the most effective
feature representation and yields both the great-
est accuracy value (with L1 scaling and quantile-
based setting of thresholds) and the greatest F-
measure macroaverage (with G2 scaling and setting
of thresholds based on average and standard devi-
ation). Combination of the triples feature with

other features based on paired co-occurrences does
not lead to further improvements, especially with
those features that also express information from the
dependency path (rel,relsat).

In comparison, the accuracy of the GermaNet hy-
pernyms feature (which includes combinations of
the hypernyms of first and second word) is much
higher than the versions that do not make use of
hand-crafted taxonomic knowledge, which is sur-
prising since it uses only taxonomic and no rela-
tional information. The pairwise feature combina-
tion for GermaNet features yields another small im-
provement over these already very good results. Dis-
tributional information on single words, both the
strictly window-based w1+w2 feature and the one
that is based on more elaborated distributional mod-
eling (attr1+pl2) show quite good results that
show further (but relatively small) improvements
when combined with the triples feature.

The importance of taxonomic (or, alternatively,
distributional semantic) information for the task pro-
posed here - namely, the supervised classification of
qualia-like relations - partly mirrors results for the
supervised classification of relations between nomi-
nals, where Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2007) find
that their best system for distributional similarity
based on the BNC performs at about the same level
as a (somewhat simpler) approach using WordNet-
based classification (Ó Séaghdha, 2007), with only
much more sophisticated approaches such as the one
of Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2009), which also
makes use of a considerably larger textual basis to
improve results over the level of the WordNet-based
approach.

Another reason for the importance of taxonomic
information in this task may lie in the fact that the
different relations have relatively strong selectional

restrictions (for animate objects, roles/professions,
body parts, or artifacts on the noun side, and certain
types of actions or events on the verb side).

Looking at the results for each relation in table
3, we see that both telic-artifact and behaviour-
animate, the two relations with the largest counts,
are classified quite reliably, while behaviour-
bodypart and behaviour-environment, the two rela-
tions with very few examples, are never found by
the system. Among the other relations, taxonomi-
cal information for nouns and verbs seems to be in-
strumental for adequate classification of the groom-
ing relation and possibly also for location, telic-
bodypart and telic-role.

7 Summary

In this paper, we have presented a dataset contain-
ing cross-part-of-speech relations between concrete
nouns and human verb associates and demonstrated
a state-of-the-art approach for the supervised mul-
ticlass classification of the qualia relations in this
dataset.3 Our results show that taxonomic informa-
tion from GermaNet is much superior to all other
features, while corpus-based dependency triples are
still visibly superior to shallow surface-based fea-
tures.

Important questions for future research would in-
clude a more direct comparison to other languages
(ideally using a similar data set and information
sources) to tease apart the influences of word order,
taxonomic organization, and data sparsity, respec-
tively.

available on request. Please feel free to send an email to the
author if you want to use it or produce a create a version for
