Abstract

Our research aims to extract information about
medication use from veterinary discussion fo-
rums. We introduce the task of categoriz-
ing information about medication use to deter-
mine whether a doctor has prescribed medica-
tion, changed protocols, observed effects, or
stopped use of a medication. First, we create
a medication detector for informal veterinary
texts and show that features derived from the
Web can be very powerful. Second, we cre-
ate classifiers to categorize each medication
mention with respect to six categories. We
demonstrate that this task benefits from a rich
linguistic feature set, domain-specific seman-
tic features produced by a weakly supervised
semantic tagger, and balanced self-training.

1 Introduction

Natural language processing holds great promise for
automatically extracting empirical data about med-
ications, from the perspective of both doctors and
patients. A wealth of information about the admin-
istration and effectiveness of medications lies within
unstructured text, including medical records created
by health care professionals (e.g., discharge sum-
maries) as well as informal texts written by medical
practitioners and patients (e.g., Web forums).

Previous work has been done on detecting med-
ication terms and recognizing relations between
medications and other medical concepts, such as dis-
eases and symptoms. Our research explores a new
problem: identifying and categorizing contexts in-
volving the administration of medications, which we
call medication use categorization. For each men-
tioned medication, we want to know whether it was
used in a patient’s care, and if so, what actions or ob-

servations are being reported. Our task aims to dis-
tinguish between contexts where a doctor prescribed
a medication, changed the protocol of a medication
(e.g., dosage or frequency), stopped use of a medi-
cation, observed effects produced by the medication,
or is asking a question about a medication. Distin-
guishing these contexts is an important step toward
being able to extract empirical data about medica-
tion use, such as effectiveness, success under differ-
ent protocols, and adverse events.

Our research studies veterinary discussion fo-
rums, which often contain informal vocabulary such
as shortened and abbreviated medication terms (e.g.
“pred” instead of “prednisone”, or “abx” for “an-
tibiotics”). The first part of our research addresses
the problem of medication detection from informal
text. We create an effective medication detector us-
ing supervised learning with linguistic features as
well as contextual features acquired from the Web.
We show that the Web context features substantially
improve recall, and yield an effective medication de-
tector even with small amounts of training data.

Second, we design supervised classifiers for med-
ication use categorization. We incorporate a rich set
of contextual, syntactic, and sentential features as
well as a semantic tagger trained for the veterinary
domain with bootstrapped learning over a large set
of unannotated veterinary texts. We demonstrate ad-
ditional performance gains by using balanced self-
training with the unannotated texts.

2 Related Work

Previous work on extracting medication information
from text has primarily focused on clinical medi-
cal text, such as discharge summaries (e.g., (Doan
and Xu, 2010; Halgrim et al., 2010; Doan et al.,
2012; Tang et al., 2013; Segura-Bedmar et al.,

1452



2013)). The Third and Fourth i2b2 Shared Tasks
included medication detection from clinical texts
(Uzuner et al., 2010; Uzuner et al., 2011), and
the Fourth i2b2 Shared Task also included relation
classification between treatments (including medi-
cations), problems, and tests. Recently, there has
been growing interest in extracting medication in-
formation from other types of text, such as Twitter,
online health forums, and drug review sites (e.g.,
(Leaman et al., 2010; Bian et al., 2012; Liu et al.,
2013; Liu and Chen, 2013; Yates and Goharian,
2013; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014)). Much of this
research is geared toward identifying adverse drug
events or drug-drug interactions.

Many methods have been used for medication ex-
traction, including rule based approaches (Levin et
al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010), machine learning (Patrick
and Li, 2010; Doan and Xu, 2010; Tang et al., 2013),
and hybrid methods (Halgrim et al., 2010; Meystre
et al., 2010). Rule based and hybrid approaches typ-
ically rely on manually created lexicons and rules.
RxNorm (Nelson et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2005) is a
large knowledge base containing generic and brand
names of drugs and it is often used as a compo-
nent in these systems. We compare our results with
the MedEx system (Xu et al., 2010), which uses
RxNorm coupled with manually defined rules.

To our knowledge, classifying medication men-
tions with respect to administration use categories
has not yet been studied. A novel aspect of our work
is also the use of Web Context features for medica-
tion detection. Similar Web features have been ex-
ploited for fine-grained person classification (Giu-
liano, 2009), while we demonstrate that they can be
highly beneficial for medical concept extraction.

3 Task Description and Data Set

We divide our task into two subproblems: (1)
Medication Detection aims to identify words cor-
responding to non-food substances used to treat
patients (e.g., drugs, potassium supplements), and
(2) Medication Use Categorization aims to classify
medication mentions based on actions and observa-
tions related to their administration and to identify
question contexts. We assign each medication
mention to one of the six categories below.

Rx: The text indicates that a doctor prescribed the
medication for a patient, or that a patient is taking
(or has previously taken) the medication.
Example: “I started the dog on abx.”
Change: A change in the administration of the med-
ication was made (e.g., dosage, route, frequency).
Example: “I increased the pred to 5mg.”
Stop: Use of the medication was discontinued.
Example: “We took the cat off metacam.”
Effect: The text reports a positive or negative effect
from the medication on a patient.
Example: “The dog responded well to Vetsulin.”
Question: A question is asked about the medication.
Example: “Do you think we should consider lasix?”
Other: None of the above. This category primarily
covers contexts not describing patient use.
Example: “Aranesp is expensive.”

Our data consists of discussion forums from the
Veterinary Information Network (VIN), which is
a web portal (www.vin.com) that hosts message
boards for veterinary professionals to discuss cases
and issues in their practice. To produce gold stan-
dard annotations, we collected the initial post of 500
randomly selected threads from VIN forums about
cardiology/pulmonology, endocrinology, and feline
internal medicine. We defined annotation guide-
lines to identify the minimum span of medication
mentions.1 Two people independently annotated 50
texts, and we measured their inter-annotator agree-
ment (IAA) using Cohen’s kappa (κ) statistic. For
medication detection, their IAA score was κ = .96.

For the medication use categories, we measured
IAA in two ways. First, we measured agreement
on all of the words labeled as a medication by at
least one annotator, yielding κ = 0.80. Second, we
measured agreement only on the words labeled as
a medication by both annotators (to more directly
assess agreement on the six categories), yielding
κ = .92. Finally, the annotators labeled an addi-
tional 450 texts, producing a gold standard set of
500 labeled texts. Of the annotated medication men-
tions, 93% have one word and 6% have two words.
The frequency of each category is shown below.

4 Medication Detection

Detecting medication terms in discussion forums is
challenging because of their informal nature. As we
will show in Section 4.1, dictionary look-up from
lexicons is not sufficient. Therefore the first part
of our research aims to create an effective medica-
tion detector for these informal veterinary texts. We
used the Stanford CoreNLP tools (Manning et al.,
2014) for lemmatization, POS tagging and parsing,
and created a SVM classifier with a linear kernel
using SVMlin (Sindhwani and Keerthi, 2006). The
classifier labels each token as a medication term or
not a medication term. Adjacent medication tokens
are then combined into a single medication mention.
We designed three types of features:

Word Features include the medication word’s
string, lemma, and part-of-speech tag. Since drugs
often have common affixes (e.g., “-sone” is a com-
mon suffix for corticosteroids), we also defined fea-
tures for character sequences of length 2-4 at the be-
ginning and end of a word.

Local Context Features represent the word pre-
ceding and the word following each medication
term. We replace numbers with the symbol “CD”.
We also defined features to represent the syntactic
dependency relations linked to the medication word
using the Stanford Parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006).

Web Context Features capture information from
web sites that mention a term, which provides exter-
nal context beyond the information available in the
training texts. During training, we issued a Google
query for each unique word in our training data and
collected the title and text snippets of the top 10 re-
trieved documents. We then defined binary-valued
features to represent all of the words in the retrieved
texts.2 We store the results of each query so that ad-
ditional queries are needed only for previously un-
seen words.

4.1 Medication Detection Results

We conducted 10-fold cross-validation experiments
on our data set to evaluate our medication detector.

First, we created three baselines to assess the diffi-
culty of medication detection for this data. The first
row of Table 1 shows the performance of a veteri-

ing the title and entire snippet achieved the best results.

nary thesaurus manually created by the VIN.3 We
extracted all of the words in the entries categorized
as Pharmacologic Substance and label all instances
of those words as medication terms. The VIN the-
saurus achieved high precision but only 51% recall.
Some reasons for the low coverage include abbre-
viations, misspellings, general terms (e.g., “drug”),
and pronouns that refer to medications (which are
annotated in our data). The second row shows the
results of MedEx (Xu et al., 2010), which uses the
RxNorm drug lexicon and ranked in second place
for the 2009 i2b2 Medication Extraction challenge.
MedEx’s low precision is primarily due to labeling
chemical substances (e.g., “glucose”) as medica-
tions, but in our data they are often test results (e.g.,
“the cat’s glucose level...”). The third row shows
the results of creating a Training Lexicon by collect-
ing all nouns annotated as medications in the train-
ing data. We labeled all instances of these nouns as
medication terms in the test data, which produced
slightly higher recall and precision than MedEx.

Table 1: Medication Detection Results

The last three rows in Table 1 show the results
for our classifier. With only Word Features, the
classifier produced an 83.9% F score, outperforming
the baselines. Adding the Local Context Features
yielded small gains in recall and precision. The
Web Context Features further increased recall from
81% to 86%, raising the F score to 87.6%. We tried
adding features for the VIN thesaurus and MedEx
system, but they did not improve upon the results
obtained with the Web Context features.

We observed that the Web Context Features can
compensate for small amounts of training data. To
demonstrate how powerful they are, we randomly
selected 100 gold standard texts to use as a test

of training data. Figure 1 shows the results for
classifiers using only the Word Features, Word
and Local Context Features, and all features. The
classifier with Web Context Features achieved an
F score > 70% using only 10 training texts, and
approached its best performance with just 100
training texts.

5 Medication Use Categorization

We tackled this problem by designing a supervised
classifier with linguistic features, and incorporated a
semantic tagger trained by bootstrapping on a large
collection of veterinary text. We also used a bal-
anced self-training method on unannotated veteri-
nary texts to further improve performance.

First, we created a one-vs-the-rest binary SVM
classifier for each category using scikit-learn (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011).4 If an instance is labeled with
multiple categories, we select the most confident one
using the distance from the hyperplane. We de-
signed three sets of features. N-gram Features rep-
resent a context window of size eight (+/-4) around
the medication mention. We define features for lexi-
cal unigrams, lexical bigrams, lemma unigrams, and
lemma bigrams. Syntactic Features capture verb
phrases that participate in a dependency relation
with the medication, using the Stanford parser. The

4Note that for medication detection we used SVMlin, but we
switched to scikit-learn for the medication categorization be-
cause it supported additional types of classifiers that we wanted
to try. Ultimately, however, the SVM performed best. We con-
firmed that SVM results from both toolkits were very similar.

third set of Sentential Features are for the Question
and Other categories to recognize sentences that do
not describe use of the medication on a patient, but
ask questions, request guidance, describe hypothet-
ical scenarios, etc. The sentential features consist
of clause initial part-of-speech (POS) and lemma
bigrams; whether the sentence ends with a ques-
tion mark; whether the word “question” occurs in
the same NP as the medication; whether the sen-
tence contains the POS sequence<MD PRP>5; and
whether the medication is separated by a comma
from the ending question mark (for lists).

Semantic Tagging. We hypothesized that identi-
fying semantic concepts might be beneficial. For ex-
ample, the presence of an ANIMAL term suggests a
patient, and a SYMPTOM term may indicate the rea-
son for a prescription or an effect of medication use.
First, we used WordNet (Miller, 1995) and identi-
fied synsets for 4 semantic classes: ANIMAL, DRUG,
DISEASE/SYMPTOM, and HUMAN. We assigned any
noun phrase with a head in these synsets to the cor-
responding semantic type. Next, we used a boot-
strapping method (Huang and Riloff, 2010) to build
domain-specific semantic taggers (SemTaggers) for
the same four semantic classes as well as TEST,
TREATMENT and OTHER. We used 10 seed words6

for each category and 10,000 unlabeled veterinary
forum texts for bootstrapping. Finally, we created
Semantic Features for our medication use classifier.
Each noun phrase tagged with a semantic class was
replaced by a semantic type. Then we constructed
features from pairs of adjacent terms in a context
window of size eight (+/-4) around each medica-
tion mention. For example, the word sequence
“for a Boston terrier with diabetes” would be trans-
formed into “for ANIMAL with DISSYM” and the
features for this context would be: <for ANIMAL>,
<ANIMAL with>, and <with DISSYM>.

sification, applied to the mentions identified by our
medication detector (from Section 4). The N-gram

6We used the same seeds as (Huang and Riloff, 2010). How-

ever we added one semantic class, TREATMENT, so for this cat-
egory we manually identified the 10 most frequent words in the
unannotated texts that describe treatments.

Table 3: Medication Use Categorization Results on gold medications (each cell shows Precision, Recall, and F)

features alone yield an average F score of 55.9%.
Both the Sentential features and Syntactic features
(added cumulatively) further improve performance,
raising the average F score to 61.8%. The next two
rows show the effect of adding the semantic fea-
tures. WordNet improves performance for Effect
and Change but recall is lower for Stop and Other.
In contrast, the SemTaggers improve performance
across all categories, raising the F score to 64.2%.
Our ablation studies show the ANIMAL class con-
tributed most to the improvement.

In addition, we explored self-training to exploit
unannotated texts. We applied the classifiers to
2,000 unlabeled veterinary texts, and used the newly
labeled instances as additional training data. This
did not improve performance, presumably because
the most common categories dominated the new in-
stances. We then explored a balanced self-training
method that enforces an even distribution of the six
categories in the new training instances. For this
approach, we added exactly k new instances7 for
each class, where k was selected to be the size of
the smallest set of newly labeled instances among
the six categories. The last row of Table 2 shows
that this balanced self-training approach improved
the average F score from 64.2% to 66.6%.

7The most confident new instances were selected based on
the differences between the scores for the winning class and the
other classes.

Table 3 shows the results for medication use clas-
sification applied to gold standard medication men-
tions. The same trends hold: the sentential and syn-
tactic features improve over n-grams, the SemTagger
semantic features add value and outperform Word-
Net, and balanced self-training further improves
performance. Overall performance increases from
66.6% to 75.1% F score with gold medications.

6 Conclusion

This research introduced a new task for classifying
medication mentions with respect to their use in pa-
tient care. We created an effective medication detec-
tor for informal veterinary texts that exploits features
derived from Web pages, and we created classifiers
to recognize six medication use categories. These
classifiers achieved precision ≥ 75% for all cate-
gories except Other, with recall ranging from 54%
for Effects to 86% for Questions. This research is a
first step toward NLP systems that can acquire em-
pirical data about the administration and effective-
ness of medications from unstructured text.
