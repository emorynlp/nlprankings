Abstract

Integrating vision and language has long
been a dream in work on artificial intel-
ligence (AI). In the past two years, we
have witnessed an explosion of work that
brings together vision and language from
images to videos and beyond. The avail-
able corpora have played a crucial role in
advancing this area of research. In this
paper, we propose a set of quality met-
rics for evaluating and analyzing the vi-
sion & language datasets and categorize
them accordingly. Our analyses show that
the most recent datasets have been us-
ing more complex language and more ab-
stract concepts, however, there are differ-
ent strengths and weaknesses in each.

1 Introduction

Bringing together language and vision in one in-
telligent system has long been an ambition in AI
research, beginning with SHRDLU as one of the
first vision-language integration systems (Wino-
grad, 1972) and continuing with more recent at-
tempts on conversational robots grounded in the
visual world (Kollar et al., 2013; Cantrell et al.,
2010; Matuszek et al., 2012; Kruijff et al., 2007;
Roy et al., 2003). In the past few years, an influx
of new, large vision & language corpora, along-
side dramatic advances in vision research, has
sparked renewed interest in connecting vision and
language. Vision & language corpora now provide
alignments between visual content that can be rec-
ognized with Computer Vision (CV) algorithms
and language that can be understood and generated
using Natural Language Processing techniques.

Fueled in part by the newly emerging data, re-
search that blends techniques in vision and in lan-
guage has increased at an incredible rate. In just

∗F.F. and N.M. contributed equally to this work.

the past year, recent work has proposed meth-
ods for image and video captioning (Fang et al.,
2014; Donahue et al., 2014; Venugopalan et al.,
2015), summarization (Kim et al., 2015), refer-
ence (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014), and question an-
swering (Antol et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015), to
name just a few. The newly crafted large-scale vi-
sion & language datasets have played a crucial role
in defining this research, serving as a foundation
for training/testing and helping to set benchmarks
for measuring system performance.

Crowdsourcing and large image collections
such as those provided by Flickr1 have made it
possible for researchers to propose methods for vi-
sion and language tasks alongside an accompany-
ing dataset. However, as more and more datasets
have emerged in this space, it has become un-
clear how different methods generalize beyond the
datasets they are evaluated on, and what data may
be useful for moving the field beyond a single task,
towards solving larger AI problems.

In this paper, we take a step back to document
this moment in time, making a record of the ma-
jor available corpora that are driving the field. We
provide a quantitative analysis of each of these
corpora in order to understand the characteristics
of each, and how they compare to one another.
The quality of a dataset must be measured and
compared to related datasets, as low quality data
may distort an entire subfield. We propose a set of
criteria for analyzing, evaluating and comparing
the quality of vision & language datasets against
each other. Knowing the details of a dataset com-
pared to similar datasets allows researchers to de-
fine more precisely what task(s) they are trying to
solve, and select the dataset(s) best suited to their
goals, while being aware of the implications and
biases the datasets could impose on a task.

We categorize the available datasets into three
major classes and evaluate them against these cri-

teria. The datasets we present here were chosen
because they are all available to the community
and cover the data that has been created to sup-
port the recent focus on image captioning work.
More importantly, we provide an evolving web-
site2 containing pointers and references to many
more vision-to-language datasets, which we be-
lieve will be valuable in unifying the quickly ex-
panding research tasks in language and vision.

2 Quality Criteria for Language &
Vision Datasets

The quality of a dataset is highly dependent on
the sampling and scraping techniques used early
in the data collection process. However, the con-
tent of datasets can play a major role in narrowing
the focus of the field. Datasets are affected by both
reporting bias (Gordon and Durme, 2013), where
the frequency with which people write about ac-
tions, events, or states does not directly reflect
real-world frequencies of those phenomena; they
are also affected by photographer’s bias (Torralba
and Efros, 2011), where photographs are some-
what predictable within a given domain. This sug-
gests that new datasets may be useful towards the
larger AI goal if provided alongside a set of quanti-
tative metrics that show how they compare against
similar corpora, as well as more general “back-
ground” corpora. Such metrics can be used as in-
dicators of dataset bias and language richness. At
a higher level, we argue that clearly defined met-
rics are necessary to provide quantitative measure-
ments of how a new dataset compares to previous
work. This helps clarify and benchmark how re-
search is progressing towards a broader AI goal as
more and more data comes into play.

In this section, we propose a set of such metrics
that characterize vision & language datasets. We
focus on methods to measure language quality that
can be used across several corpora. We also briefly
examine metrics for vision quality. We evaluate
several recent datasets based on all proposed met-
rics in Section 4, with results reported in Tables 1,
2, and Figure 1.

2.1 Language Quality

We define the following criteria for evaluating the
captions or instructions of the datasets:
• Vocabulary Size (#vocab), the number of
unique vocabulary words.

2http://visionandlanguage.net

• Syntactic Complexity (Frazier, Yngve) mea-
sures the amount of embedding/branching in a
sentence’s syntax. We report mean Yngve (Yngve,
1960) and Frazier measurements (Frazier, 1985);
each provides a different counting on the number
of nodes in the phrase markers of syntactic trees.
• Part of Speech Distribution measures the dis-
tribution of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other
parts of speech.
• Abstract:Concrete Ratio (#Conc, #Abs,
%Abs) indicates the range of visual and non-visual
concepts the dataset covers. Abstract terms are
ideas or concepts, such as ‘love’ or ‘think’ and
concrete terms are all the objects or events that are
mainly available to the senses. For this purpose,
we use a list of most common abstract terms in En-
glish (Vanderwende et al., 2015), and define con-
crete terms as all other words except for a small
set of function words.
• Average Sentence Length (Sent Len.) shows
how rich and descriptive the sentences are.
• Perplexity provides a measure of data skew
by measuring how expected sentences are from
one corpus according to a model trained on an-
other corpus. We analyze perplexity (Ppl) for each
dataset against a 5-gram language model learned
on a generic 30B words English dataset. We
further analyze pair-wise perplexity of datasets
against each other in Section 4.

2.2 Vision Quality

Our focus in this survey is mainly on language,
however, the characteristics of images or videos
and their corresponding annotations is as impor-
tant in vision & language research. The quality of
vision in a dataset can be characterized in part by
the variety of visual subjects and scenes provided,
as well as the richness of the annotations (e.g., seg-
mentation using bounding boxes (BB) or visual de-
pendencies between boxes). Moreover, a vision
corpus can use abstract or real images (Abs/Real).

3 The Available Datasets

We group a representative set of available datasets
based on their content. For a complete list of
datasets and their descriptions, please refer to the
supplementary website.2

3.1 Captioned Images

Several recent vision & language datasets provide
one or multiple captions per image. The captions

208



of these datasets are either the original photo ti-
tle and descriptions provided by online users (Or-
donez et al., 2011; Thomee et al., 2015), or the
captions generated by crowd workers for existing
images. The former datasets tend to be larger in
size and contain more contextual descriptions.

3.1.1 User-generated Captions
• SBU Captioned Photo Dataset (Ordonez et al.,
2011) contains 1 million images with original user
generated captions, collected in the wild by sys-
tematic querying of Flickr. This dataset is col-
lected by querying Flickr for specific terms such as
objects and actions and then filtered images with
descriptions longer than certain mean length.
• Déjà Images Dataset (Chen et al., 2015) con-
sists of 180K unique user-generated captions as-
sociated with 4M Flickr images, where one cap-
tion is aligned with multiple images. This dataset
was collected by querying Flickr for 693 high fre-
quency nouns, then further filtered to have at least
one verb and be judged as “good” captions by
workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Turkers).

3.1.2 Crowd-sourced Captions
• UIUC Pascal Dataset (Farhadi et al., 2010) is
probably one of the first datasets aligning images
with captions. Pascal dataset contains 1,000 im-
ages with 5 sentences per image.
• Flickr 30K Images (Young et al., 2014) extends
previous Flickr datasets (Rashtchian et al., 2010),
and includes 158,915 crowd-sourced captions that
describe 31,783 images of people involved in ev-
eryday activities and events.
•Microsoft COCO Dataset (MS COCO) (Lin et
al., 2014) includes complex everyday scenes with
common objects in naturally occurring contexts.
Objects in the scene are labeled using per-instance
segmentations. In total, this dataset contains pho-
tos of 91 basic object types with 2.5 million la-
beled instances in 328k images, each paired with 5
captions. This dataset gave rise to the CVPR 2015
image captioning challenge and is continuing to be
a benchmark for comparing various aspects of vi-
sion and language research.
• Abstract Scenes Dataset (Clipart) (Zitnick et
al., 2013) was created with the goal of represent-
ing real-world scenes with clipart to study scene
semantics isolated from object recognition and
segmentation issues in image processing. This re-
moves the burden of low-level vision tasks. This
dataset contains 10,020 images of children playing

outdoors associated with total 60,396 descriptions.

3.1.3 Captions of Densely Labeled Images
Existing caption datasets provide images paired
with captions, but such brief image descriptions
capture only a subset of the content in each image.
Measuring the magnitude of the reporting bias in-
herent in such descriptions helps us to understand
the discrepancy between what we can learn for
the specific task of image captioning versus what
we can learn more generally from the photographs
people take. One dataset useful to this end pro-
vides image annotation for content selection:
•Microsoft Research Dense Visual Annotation
Corpus (Yatskar et al., 2014) provides a set of 500
images from the Flickr 8K dataset (Rashtchian et
al., 2010) that are densely labeled with 100,000
textual labels, with bounding boxes and facets an-
notated for each object. This approximates “gold
standard” visual recognition.

To get a rough estimate of the reporting bias in
image captioning, we determined the percentage
of top-level objects3 that are mentioned in the cap-
tions for this dataset out of all the objects that are
annotated. Of the average 8.04 available top-level
objects in the image, each of the captions only re-
ports an average of 2.7 of these objects.4 A more
detailed analysis of reporting bias is beyond the
scope of this paper, but we found that many of the
biases (e.g., people selection) found with abstract
scenes (Zitnick et al., 2013) are also present with
photos.

3.2 Video Description and Instruction

Video datasets aligned with descriptions (Chen et
al., 2010; Rohrbach et al., 2012; Regneri et al.,
2013; Naim et al., 2015; Malmaud et al., 2015)
generally represent limited domains and small lex-
icons, which is due to the fact that video process-
ing and understanding is a very compute-intensive
task. Available datasets include:
• Short Videos Described with Sentences (Yu
and Siskind, 2013) includes 61 video clips (each
35 seconds in length, filmed in three different

3This visual annotation consists of a two-level hierarchy,
where multiple Turkers enumerated and located objects and
stuff in each image, and these objects were then further la-
beled with finer-grained object information (Has attributes).

4We did not use an external synonym or paraphrasing re-
source to perform the matching between labels and captions,
as the dataset itself provides paraphrases for each object: each
object is labeled by multiple Turkers, who labeled Isa rela-
tions (e.g., “eagle” is a “bird”).

taneous events between a subset of four objects:
a person, a backpack, a chair, and a trash-can.
Each video was manually annotated (with very re-
stricted grammar and lexicon) with several sen-
tences describing what occurs in the video.
• Microsoft Research Video Description Cor-
pus (MS VDC) (Chen and Dolan, 2011) con-
tains parallel descriptions (85,550 English ones)
of 2,089 short video snippets (10-25 seconds
long). The descriptions are one sentence sum-
maries about the actions or events in the video
as described by Amazon Turkers. In this dataset,
both paraphrase and bilingual alternatives are cap-
tured, hence, the dataset can be useful translation,
paraphrasing, and video description purposes.

3.3 Beyond Visual Description

Recent work has demonstrated that n-gram lan-
guage modeling paired with scene-level under-
standing of an image trained on large enough
datasets can result in reasonable automatically
generated captions (Fang et al., 2014; Donahue
et al., 2014). Some works have proposed to step
beyond description generation, towards deeper AI
tasks such as question answering (Ren et al., 2015;
Malinowski and Fritz, 2014). We present two of
these attempts below:
• Visual Madlibs Dataset (VML) (Yu et al.,
2015) is a subset of 10,783 images from the MS
COCO dataset which aims to go beyond describ-
ing which objects are in the image. For a given
image, three Amazon Turkers were prompted
to complete one of 12 fill-in-the-blank template
questions, such as ‘when I look at this picture,
I feel –’, selected automatically based on the im-
age content. This dataset contains a total of

360,001 MadLib question and answers.
• Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset
(Antol et al., 2015) is created for the task of open-
ended VQA, where a system can be presented with
an image and a free-form natural-language ques-
tion (e.g., ‘how many people are in the photo?’),
and should be able to answer the question. This
dataset contains both real images and abstract
scenes, paired with questions and answers. Real
images include 123,285 images from MS COCO
dataset, and 10,000 clip-art abstract scenes, made
up from 20 ‘paperdoll’ human models with ad-
justable limbs and over 100 objects and 31 ani-
mals. Amazon Turkers were prompted to create
‘interesting’ questions, resulting in 215,150 ques-
tions and 430,920 answers.
• Toronto COCO-QA Dataset (CQA) (Ren et
al., 2015) is also a visual question answering
dataset, where the questions are automatically
generated from image captions of MS COCO
dataset. This dataset has a total of 123,287 im-
ages with 117,684 questions with one-word an-
swer about objects, numbers, colors, or locations.

4 Analysis

We analyze the datasets introduced in Section 3
according to the metrics defined in Section 2, us-
ing the Stanford CoreNLP suite to acquire parses
and part-of-speech tags (Manning et al., 2014).
We also include the Brown corpus (Francis and
Kucera, 1979; Marcus et al., 1999) as a reference
point. We find evidence that the VQA dataset cap-
tures more abstract concepts than other datasets,
with almost 20% of the words found in our ab-
stract concept resource. The Deja corpus has the
least number of abstract concepts, followed by
COCO and VDC. This reflects differences in col-

Figure 1: Simplified part-of-speech distributions for the eight
datasets. We include the POS tags from the balanced Brown
corpus (Marcus et al., 1999) to contextualize any very shal-
low syntactic biases. We mapped all nouns to “N,” all verbs
to “V,” all adjectives to “J” and all other POS tags to “O.”

lecting the various corpora: For example, the Deja
corpus was collected to find specifically visual
phrases that can be used to describe multiple im-
ages. This corpus also has the most syntactically
simple phrases, as measured by both Frazier and
Yngve; this is likely caused by the phrases needing
to be general enough to capture multiple images.

The most syntactically complex sentences are
found in the Flickr30K, COCO and CQA datasets.
However, the CQA dataset suffers from a high per-
plexity against a background corpus relative to the
other datasets, at odds with relatively short sen-
tence lengths. This suggests that the automatic
caption-to-question conversion may be creating
unexpectedly complex sentences that are less re-
flective of general language usage. In contrast,
the COCO and Flickr30K dataset’s relatively high
syntactic complexity is in line with their relatively

high sentence length.
Table 2 illustrates further similarities between

datasets, and a more fine-grained use of perplex-
ity to measure the usefulness of a given train-
ing set for predicting words of a given test set.
Some datasets such as COCO, Flickr30K, and Cli-
part are generally more useful as out-domain data
compared to the QA datasets. Test sets for VQA
and CQA are quite idiosyncratic and yield poor
perplexity unless trained on in-domain data. As
shown in Figure 1, the COCO dataset is balanced
across POS tags most similarly to the balanced
Brown corpus (Marcus et al., 1999). The Clipart
dataset provides the highest proportion of verbs,
which often correspond to actions/poses in vision
research, while the Flickr30K corpus provides the
most nouns, which often correspond to object/stuff
categories in vision research.

We emphasize here that the distinction between
a qualitatively good or bad dataset is task depen-
dent. Therefore, all these metrics and the obtained
results provide the researchers with an objective
set of criteria so that they can make the decision
whether a dataset is suitable to a particular task.

5 Conclusion

We detail the recent growth of vision & language
corpora and compare and contrast several recently
released large datasets. We argue that newly in-
troduced corpora may measure how they compare
to similar datasets by measuring perplexity, syn-
tactic complexity, abstract:concrete word ratios,
among other metrics. By leveraging such met-
rics and comparing across corpora, research can
be sensitive to how datasets are biased in different
directions, and define new corpora accordingly.
