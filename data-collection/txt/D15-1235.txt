Abstract

The conferences ACL (Association for
Computational Linguistics) and EMNLP
(Empirical Methods in Natural Language
Processing) rank among the premier
venues that track the research develop-
ments in Natural Language Processing and
Computational Linguistics. In this paper,
we present a study on the research pa-
pers of approximately two decades from
these two NLP conferences. We apply
keyphrase extraction and corpus analysis
tools to the proceedings from these venues
and propose probabilistic and vector-based
representations to represent the topics
published in a venue for a given year.
Next, similarity metrics are studied over
pairs of venue representations to capture
the progress of the two venues with respect
to each other and over time.

1 Introduction

Scientific findings in a subject-area are typically
published in conferences, journals, patents, and
books in that domain. These research docu-
ments constitute valuable resources from the per-
spective of data mining applications. For in-
stance, the citation links among research docu-
ments are used in computing bibliometric quan-
tities for authors (Alonso et al., 2009) whereas
topic models on research corpora are used to
distinguish between influential and impactful re-
searchers (Kataria et al., 2011) and to capture tem-
poral topic trends (He et al., 2009).

Despite several potential benefits mentioned
above and the free availability of most research

proceedings in NLP through the ACL Anthology1,
the topical and temporal aspects of this corpus are
yet to be fully studied in current literature. In this
paper, we present our study on research proceed-
ings of approximately two decades from two lead-
ing NLP conferences, namely ACL and EMNLP,
to complement a previous study on this topic by
Hall et al (2008). To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to characterize the developments
in the NLP domain using a comparative study of
two of its leading publication venues. Our contri-
butions are summarized below:

1. We represent the NLP research corpus from
approximately two decades as a keyphrase-
document matrix and apply Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) to extract co-
herent topics from it (Newman et al., 2010).

2. We propose two novel representations for
summarizing the venue proceedings in a
given year. (1) The probabilistic represen-
tation expresses each venue as a probability
distribution over topics, whereas (2) the TP-
ICP representation captures topics that are
the major focus in the venue for a particu-
lar year via Topic Proportion (TP) as well
as topic importance as measured with inverse
corpus proportion (ICP).

3. We apply Jensen-Shannon divergence and
cosine similarity on our proposed venue rep-
resentations to analyze the venues over time.
Specifically, we ask the following questions:
What are the popular topics in ACL and
EMNLP in a particular year? Is the topical
focus in EMNLP different from ACL? How

did the topical focus in each venue change
over time?

Organization: We describe our novel venue rep-
resentations and the measures used to compare
them in Section 2. The details of our datasets and
experiments are presented in Section 3 along with
results and observations. We summarize related
research in Section 4 before concluding the paper
in Section 5.

2 Methods

Let Y = {y1, y2 . . . yT } be the consecutive years
in which the research proceedings are available
from V , set of publication venues under consider-
ation (V = {“ACL”, “EMNLP”} in this paper). If
D is the set of all documents over the years, each
document d ∈ D is associated with {Kd, y, v}
where Kd refers to the content of d whereas v and
y refer to the venue and year in which d was pub-
lished.

2.1 Venues as Probability Distributions

Let t1, t2 . . . tk denote the topics capturing the
content of documents in D. Using probabilis-
tic topic modeling and dimension reduction tools
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or pLSA (Hof-
mann, 1999; Blei et al., 2003), we extract for each
d ∈ D, P (ti|d), i = 1 . . . k, the multinomial dis-
tribution over the topics associated with d.

The venue-topic probability distribution
P (ti|vy) for a given (venue, year) pair
(v = l, y = m) can be computed using
Dl,m, the set of documents published in venue l,
in the year m. That is,

Pl,m(ti) =
1

|Dl,m|
∑

d∈Dl,m
P (ti|d) (1)

Note that the above probabilistic representation
facilitates a quantitative measure to compare
two venues: the divergence between the prob-
ability distributions of the two venues. The
Kullback−Leibler divergence (KLD) between two
(discrete) probability distributions P and Q is
given by: DKL(P ||Q) =

∑
i
P (i)log P (i)Q(i) . Due

to the unsymmetric nature of KLD, we use the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, a symmetric and fi-
nite measure (0 ≤ JSD(P ||Q) ≤ 1) based on
KLD. Let M = 12 (P + Q),

JSD(P ||Q) = 1
2
[DKL(P ||M) + DKL(Q||M)]

2.2 Venues as TP-ICP Vectors

Discrete probability distributions are often repre-
sented in computations as normalized vectors. For
instance, the P (ti|v) values comprise the compo-
nents of a k-dimensional vector. This topic pro-
portion (TP) vector is similar to the normalized
term frequency vector commonly used in Infor-
mation Retrieval (IR) (Manning et al., 2008). TP
values are fractions indicating the percentage of a
given topic among all topics covered in a partic-
ular year. Thus these values are higher for topics
that are the major focus in the venue for a particu-
lar year .

We also extend inverse document frequency, a
popular concept that is used to weigh terms in
IR (Manning et al., 2008) to describe Inverse Cor-
pus Proportion or ICP. Our objective in defin-
ing ICP is to capture the importance of a topic
by diminishing the effect of topics that are com-
mon across all years. Let TPv,y(i) represents the
proportion of topic ti in venue v for year y, then
ICP (ti) =

log
( |Y |∑

y=1

|V |∑
v=1

k∑
j=1

TPv,y(j)

|Y |∑
y=1

|V |∑
v=1

TPv,y(i)

)
=

( |D|
|Y |∑
y=1

|V |∑
v=1

TPv,y(i)

)

since
k∑

j=1
TP(j) = 1, TP being a probability dis-

tribution vector and |Y | × |V | = |D|. The TP-
ICP vector for a venue is defined as: [TP (1) ×
ICP (1), . . . TP (k) × ICP (k)] and captures in
each component the weighted proportion of a topic
in that venue for a year. This novel represen-
tation can be considered the topic-level counter-
part of the popular TF-IDF representation in IR.
Given two TP-ICP vectors P = [p1, p2, . . . pk] and
Q = [q1, q2, . . . qk], the similarity between them
using the cosine measure is given by:

cosine(P,Q) =

k∑
i=1

pi.qi

||P ||2.||Q||2

2.3 Keyphrases for representing documents

Corpus analysis tools often use bag-of-words
models and term frequencies for representing doc-
uments (Heinrich, 2005). However, research doc-
uments are often well-structured, and contain var-
ious sections with author information, citations,

and content-related sections such as abstract, re-
lated work, and experiments. To best represent
the topical content of these documents, we har-
ness the latest work on keyphrase extraction for
research documents and represent documents us-
ing keyphrases (Hasan and Ng, 2014).

We use the ExpandRank algorithm (Wan and
Xiao, 2008) to extract top n-grams ∀d ∈ D. Ex-
pandRank effectively combines PageRank values
on word graphs with text similarity scores be-
tween documents to score n-grams for a document
and was shown to outperform other unsupervised
keyphrase extraction methods on research docu-
ments in absence of other information such as ci-
tations (Gollapalli and Caragea, 2014).

3 Experiments
Datasets and setup: We crawled the ACLWeb
for research papers from EMNLP and ACL from
the year 1996 through 20142 using the Java-based
crawler, Heritrix3. The text from the PDF docu-
ments was extracted using the PDFBox software4

after which simple rules similar to the ones used
in CiteSeer (Li et al., 2006) were employed to ex-
tract the “body” of the research document5. The
numbers of papers for each year at the end of this
process are listed in Table 2. From these numbers,

Since our goal is to compare the two venues, we start from 1996 when EMNLP

branched off into a full conference from a workshop on Very Large Corpora although ACL
proceedings are available from 1979.

it appears that the paper “intake” in each confer-
ence has gone up overall during the last decade
although occasionally the increase is due to co-
location with related conferences such as IJCNLP
and HLT6.

We construct the keyphrase-document matrix
using top-100 keyphrases of each document ex-
tracted with ExpandRank. The LDA implemen-
tation provided in Mallet (McCallum, 2002) was
used to extract topics from this matrix. The
LDA algorithm was run along with hyperparame-
ter optimization (Minka, 2003) for different num-
bers of topics between 10 . . . 100 in increments of
10. We use the average corpus likelihood over
ten randomly-initialized runs to choose the opti-
mal number of topics that best “explain” the cor-
pus (Heinrich, 2005). As indicated by the left plot
in Figure 1 this optimum is obtained when the
number of topics is 30.

3.1 Results and Observations
The top phrases that reflect the “theme” captured
by a topic are shown in Table 1. As indicated
in this table, we are able to extract coherent top-
ics from the corpus using LDA on a document-
keyphrase matrix (AlSumait et al., 2009; Newman
et al., 2010).

equal parts and examine the top topics for ACL
and EMNLP at these time points. We rank the
topics in each conference by their TP-ICP val-
ues and list the top 3 topics in the right table of
Figure 1. “Semantic relation extraction”, “sen-
timent analysis”, and “topic models” are the top
research topics in NLP last year (2014) whereas
in the year 1996, the topics “noun phrase extrac-
tion”, “summarization”, “corpus modeling”, and
“speech recognition” dominated the NLP research
arena. From the table, it can be seen that “infor-
mation retrieval” (topicID: 18) ranks among the
top topics in EMNLP for all three timepoints dur-
ing 2000-2010 whereas “natural language genera-
tion” (topicID: 9) was consistently addressed dur-
ing 1996-2005 in ACL.

EMNLP versus ACL: We compare the venues
using JSD and Cosine similarity measures in the
middle plot of Figure 1. The plot shows decreas-
ing divergence between the topical distributions
over the years and increasing cosine similarity be-
tween the TP-ICP vectors for the venues. These
trends indicate that over the two decades the two
venues ACL and EMNLP seem to have “become
like each other” although their topical focus was
different during the initial years. Increasingly,
both venues seem to publish papers on similar top-

ics. This behavior could be interpreted to mean
that the NLP research field is more stable now with
two of its leading conferences addressing prob-
lems on similar topics.

Changing topical focus over the years: In
the first plot of Figure 2, we show the Jensen-
Shannon divergence between the topic distribu-
tions of a particular venue for a given year y and
(y − 1), the year preceding it. The curve indi-
cates that in the years between 1997-2008, the rate
of change from year to year is higher than in the
years following 2008. We split the time period
1996-2014 into five roughly-equal parts to form
the set {1996, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014}. The JSD
between the distribution in a particular year and
the years preceding it in the above set is shown for
ACL (middle plot) and EMNLP (right plot) in Fig-
ure 2. For example, the first cluster in the middle
plot, shows the JSD values between the distribu-
tions for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 with
the starting year 1996 for ACL. For both venues,
the divergences of a given year are higher with
the early starting years 1996 and 2000 than with
the later starting years 2005 and 2010, indicating
that the topics being addressed currently in NLP
research are significantly different from those ad-
dressed a decade back.

4 Related Work
Temporal analysis of corpora is an upcoming re-
search topic in text mining groups. Topic models
were particularly investigated for detecting activ-
ity patterns in corpora annotated with time infor-
mation (Huynh et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2009).
Evolution of topics and their trends were studied
on research corpora from NIPS (Wang and McCal-
lum, 2006) as well as CiteSeer (He et al., 2009).

In contrast with existing approaches that seek to
model the detection of new topics and their evo-
lution, we focus on representing different venues
pertaining to a research field and examine their de-
velopment over time by comparing them against
each other. In a similar study, Hall et al. (2008)
examined the emergence of topics in NLP litera-
ture. They proposed “topic entropy” to measure
the diversity in three conferences from the ACL
Anthology during the years 1978-2006. They also
noted that all the venues seem to converge in the
topics they cover over the years based on the JSD
between their topic distributions.
5 Conclusions
We presented our study on research proceed-
ings of approximately two decades from the lead-
ing NLP conference venues: EMNLP and ACL.
We extracted coherent topics from this corpus
by applying topic modeling on the correspond-
ing keyphrase-document matrix. Next, the ex-
tracted topics were used to characterize each
venue through probabilistic and vector represen-
tations and compared against each other and over
the years using various similarity measures. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to present
insights related to the development of a research
field by studying two leading conferences in the
area using various techniques from NLP and IR.
