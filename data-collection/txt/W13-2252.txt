Abstract

This paper gives a detailed description of
the ACT (Accuracy of Connective Trans-
lation) metric, a reference-based metric
that assesses only connective translations.
ACT relies on automatic word-level align-
ment (using GIZA++) between a source
sentence and respectively the reference
and candidate translations, along with
other heuristics for comparing translations
of discourse connectives. Using a dictio-
nary of equivalents, the translations are
scored automatically or, for more accu-
racy, semi-automatically. The accuracy of
the ACT metric was assessed by human
judges on sample data for English/French,
English/Arabic, English/Italian and En-
glish/German translations; the ACT scores
are within 2-5% of human scores.

The actual version of ACT is available
only for a limited language pairs. Conse-
quently, we are participating only for the
English/French and English/German lan-
guage pairs. Our hypothesis is that ACT
metric scores increase with better transla-
tion quality in terms of human evaluation.

1 Introduction

Discourse connectives should preserve their sense
during translation, as they are often ambiguous
and may convey more than one sense depending
on the inter-sentential relation (causality, conces-
sion, contrast or temporal). For instance, since
in English can express temporal simultaneity, but
also a causal sense.

In this paper, we present results of different Ma-
chine Translation systems for English-to-French
and English-to-German pairs. More specifically,
we measure the quality of machine translations
of eight English discourse connectives: although,

even though, meanwhile, since, though, while,
however, and yet, adopting different approaches.
This quality is measured using a dedicated met-
ric named ACT (Accuracy of Connective Transla-
tion), a reference-based metric that assesses only
connective translations.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we present the ACT metric and its error rate. In
section 3, we compare the ACT metric to previous
machine translation evaluation metrics. Finally,
we present the results of the different English-to-
German and English-to-French MT systems (Sec-
tion 4).

2 ACT Metric

We described the ACT metric in (Hajlaoui and
Popescu-Belis, 2013) and (Hajlaoui and Popescu-
Belis, 2012). Its main idea is to detect, for a given
explicit source discourse connective, its transla-
tion in a reference translation and in a candidate
translation. ACT then compares and scores these
translations. To identify the translations, ACT first
uses a dictionary of possible translations of each
discourse connective type, collected from training
data and validated by humans. If a reference or a
candidate translation contains more than one pos-
sible translation of the source connective, align-
ment information is used to detect the correct con-
nective translation. If the alignment information is
irrelevant (not equal to a connective), it then com-
pares the word position (word index) of the source
connective alignment with the index in the trans-
lated sentence (candidate or reference) and the set
of candidate connectives to disambiguate the con-
nective’s translation. Finally, the nearest connec-
tive to the alignment is taken.

ACT proceeds by checking whether the refer-
ence translation contains one of the possible trans-
lations of the connective in question. After that, it
similarly checks if the candidate translation con-
tains a possible translation of the connective. Fi-

408



nally, it checks if the reference connective found
is equal (case 1), synonymous (case 2) or incom-
patible 1(case 3) to the candidate connective. Dis-
course relations can be implicit in the candidate
(case 4), or in the reference (case 5) translation or
in both of them (case 6). These different compar-
isons can be represented by the following 6 cases:

• Case 1: same connective in the reference
(Ref) and candidate translation (Cand).

• Case 2: synonymous connective in Ref and
Cand.

• Case 3: incompatible connective in Ref and
Cand.

• Case 4: source connective translated in Ref
but not in Cand.

• Case 5: source connective translated in Cand
but not in Ref.

• Case 6: the source connective neither trans-
lated in Ref nor in Cand.

Based on the connective dictionary categorised
by senses, ACT gives one point for identical (case
1) and equivalent translations (case 2), otherwise
zero. ACT proposes a semi-automatic option by
manually checking instances of case 5 and case
62.

ACT returns the ratio of the total number of
points to the number of source connectives ac-
cording to the three versions: (1) ACTa counts
only case 1 and case 2 as correct and all others
cases as wrong, (2) ACTa5+6 excludes case 5 and
case 6 and (3) ACTm considers the correct transla-
tions found by manual scoring of case 5 and case 6
noted respectively case5corr and case6corr to bet-
ter consider these implicit cases.

2We do not check manually case 4 because we observed

that its instances propose generally explicit translations that
do not belong to our dictionary, it means the SMT system
tends to learn explicit translations for explicit source connec-
tive.

2.1 Configurations of ACT metric

As shown in Figure 1, ACT can be configured to
use an optional disambiguation module. Two ver-
sions of this disambiguation module can be used:
(1) without training, which means without sav-
ing an alignment model and only using GIZA++
as alignment tool; (2) with training and saving
an alignment model using MGIZA++ (a multi-
threaded version of GIZA++) trained on an exter-
nal corpus to align the (Source, Reference) and the
(Source, Candidate) data.

Figure 1: ACT architecture

ACT is more accurate using the disambiguation
module. We encourage to use the version without
training since it only requires the installation of
the GIZA++ tool. Based on its heuristics and on
its connective dictionaries categorised by senses,
ACT has a higher precision to detect the right con-
nective when more than one translation is possible.
The following example illustrates the usefulness
of the disambiguation module when we have more
than one possible translation of the source con-
nective. Without disambiguation, ACT detects the
same connective si in both target sentences (wrong
case 1), while the right translation of the source
connective although is bien que and même si re-
spectively in the reference and the candidate sen-
tence (case 2).

Without disambiguation, case 1: Csrc= although,
Cref = si, Ccand = si

With disambiguation, case 2: Csrc= although
(concession), Cref = bien que, Ccand = même si

tique .

• CANDIDATE: nous n’ était pas si mauvaise
en irlande . cette fois . même si nous avons
eu vent de nombreuses graves tempêtes sur
les deux rives de l’ atlantique .

In the following experiments, we used the rec-
ommended configuration of ACT (without train-
ing).

2.2 Error rate of the ACT metric
ACT is a free open-source Perl script licensed un-
der GPL v33. It has a reasonable and accept-
able error score when comparing its results to
human judgements (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis,
2013). Its accuracy was assessed by human judges
on sample data for English-to-French, English-to-
Arabic, English-to-Italian and English-to-German
translations; the ACT scores are within 2-5% of
human scores.

2.3 Multilingual architecture of ACT Metric
The ACT architecture is multilingual: it was ini-
tially developed for the English-French language
pair, then ported to English-Arabic, English-
Italian and English-German.

The main resource needed to port the ACT met-
ric to another language pair is the dictionary of
connectives matching possible synonyms and clas-
sifying connectives by sense. To find these pos-
sible translations of a given connective, we pro-
posed an automatic method based on a large cor-
pus analysis (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2012).
This method can be used for any language pair.

Estimating the effort that would have to be taken
to port the ACT metric to new language pairs fo-
cusing on the same linguistic phenomena mainly
depends on the size of parallel data sets contain-
ing the given source connective. The classifi-
cation by sense depends also on the number of
possible translations detected for a given source
connective. This task is sometimes difficult, as
some translations (target connectives) can be as
ambiguous as the source connective. Native lin-
guistic knowledge of the target language is there-
fore needed in order to complete a dictionary with
the main meanings and senses of the connectives.

We think that the same process and the same
effort can be taken to adapt ACT to new linguistic
phenomena (verbs, pronouns, adverbs, etc).

3 Related works

ACT is different from existing MT metrics. The
METEOR metric (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011)
uses monolingual alignment between two trans-
lations to be compared: a system translation and
a reference one. METEOR performs a mapping
between unigrams: every unigram in each trans-
lation maps to zero or one unigram in the other
translation. Unlike METEOR, the ACT metric
uses a bilingual alignment (between the source and
the reference sentences and between the source
and the candidate sentences) and the word posi-
tion information as additional information to dis-
ambiguate the connective situation in case there is
more than one connective in the target (reference
or candidate) sentence. ACT may work without
this disambiguation.

The evaluation metric described in (Max et al.,
2010) indicates for each individual source word
which systems (among two or more systems or
system versions) correctly translated it according
to some reference translation(s). This allows car-
rying out detailed contrastive analyses at the word
level, or at the level of any word class (e.g. part
of speech, homonymous words, highly ambiguous
words relative to the training corpus, etc.). The
ACT metric relies on the independent compari-
son of one system’s hypothesis with a reference.
An automatic diagnostics of machine translation
and based on linguistic checkpoints (Zhou et al.,
2008), (Naskar et al., 2011) constitute a different
approach from our ACT metric. The approach es-
sentially uses the BLEU score to separately eval-
uate translations of a set of predefined linguis-
tic checkpoints such as specific parts of speech,
types of phrases (e.g., noun phrases) or phrases
with a certain function word. A different ap-
proach was proposed by (Popovic and Ney, 2011)
to study the distribution of errors over five cate-
gories (inflectional errors, reordering errors, miss-
ing words, extra words, incorrect lexical choices)
and to examine the number of errors in each cat-
egory. This proposal was based on the calcu-
lation of Word Error Rate (WER) and Position-
independent word Error Rate (PER), combined
with different types of linguistic knowledge (base
forms, part-of-speech tags, name entity tags, com-

410



pound words, suffixes, prefixes). This approach
does not allow checking synonym words having
the same meaning like the case of discourse con-
nectives.

4 ACT-based comparative evaluation

We used the ACT metric to assess connective
translations for 21 English-German systems and
23 English-French systems. It was computed on
tokenized and lower-cased text using its second
configuration ”without training” (Hajlaoui and
Popescu-Belis, 2013).

Table 1 shows only ACTa scores for the
English-to-German translation systems since
ACTa5+6 gives the same rank as ACTa. Table 2
present the same for the English-to-French sys-
tems. We are not presenting ACTm either because
we didn’t check manually case 5 and case 6.

5 Conclusion

The connective translation accuracy of the can-
didate systems cannot be measured correctly by
current MT metrics such as BLEU and NIST. We
therefore developed a new distance-based metric,
ACT, to measure the improvement in connective
translation. ACT is a reference-based metric that
only compares the translations of discourse con-
nectives. It is intended to capture the improvement
of an MT system that can deal specifically with
discourse connectives.

ACT can be also used semi-automatically. Con-
sequently, the scores reflect more accurately the
improvement in translation quality in terms of dis-
course connectives.

Theoretically, a better system should preserve
the sense of discourse connectives. Our hypothe-
sis is thus that ACT scores are increasing with bet-
ter translation quality. We need access the human
rankings of this task to validate if ACT’s scores
indeed correlate with overall translation quality
rankings.
