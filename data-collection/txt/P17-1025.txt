Abstract

Learning commonsense knowledge from
natural language text is nontrivial due to
reporting bias: people rarely state the ob-
vious, e.g., “My house is bigger than me.”
However, while rarely stated explicitly,
this trivial everyday knowledge does influ-
ence the way people talk about the world,
which provides indirect clues to reason
about the world. For example, a statement
like, “Tyler entered his house” implies that
his house is bigger than Tyler.

In this paper, we present an approach to
infer relative physical knowledge of ac-
tions and objects along five dimensions
(e.g., size, weight, and strength) from un-
structured natural language text. We frame
knowledge acquisition as joint inference
over two closely related problems: learn-
ing (1) relative physical knowledge of ob-
ject pairs and (2) physical implications
of actions when applied to those object
pairs. Empirical results demonstrate that it
is possible to extract knowledge of actions
and objects from language and that joint
inference over different types of knowl-
edge improves performance.

1 Introduction

Reading and reasoning about natural language text
often requires trivial knowledge about everyday
physical actions and objects. For example, given
a sentence “Shanice could fit the trophy into the
suitcase,” we can trivially infer that the trophy
must be smaller than the suitcase even though it
is not stated explicitly. This reasoning requires
knowledge about the action “fit”—in particular,
typical preconditions that need to be satisfied in
order to perform the action. In addition, reasoning

⇒ x  is lighter than  y

⇒ x  is faster than  y

⇒ x  is less rigid than  y

Figure 1: An overview of our approach. A verb’s
usage in language (top) implies physical relations
between objects it takes as arguments. This allows
us to reason about properties of specific objects
(middle), as well as the knowledge implied by the
verb itself (bottom).

about the applicability of various physical actions
in a given situation often requires background
knowledge about objects in the world, for exam-
ple, that people are usually smaller than houses,
that cars generally move faster than humans walk,
or that a brick probably is heavier than a feather.

In fact, the potential use of such knowledge
about everyday actions and objects can go beyond
language understanding and reasoning. Many
open challenges in computer vision and robotics
may also benefit from such knowledge, as shown

in recent work that requires visual reasoning and
entailment (Izadinia et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2014).
Ideally, an AI system should acquire such knowl-
edge through direct physical interactions with the
world. However, such a physically interactive sys-
tem does not seem feasible in the foreseeable fu-
ture.

In this paper, we present an approach to ac-
quire trivial physical knowledge from unstructured
natural language text as an alternative knowledge
source. In particular, we focus on acquiring rel-
ative physical knowledge of actions and objects
organized along five dimensions: size, weight,
strength, rigidness, and speed. Figure 1 illustrates
example knowledge of (1) relative physical rela-
tions of object pairs and (2) physical implications
of actions when applied to those object pairs.

While natural language text is a rich source to
obtain broad knowledge about the world, compil-
ing trivial commonsense knowledge from unstruc-
tured text is a nontrivial feat. The central challenge
lies in reporting bias: people rarely states the obvi-
ous (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013; Sorower et al.,
2011; Misra et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017), since
it goes against Grice’s conversational maxim on
the quantity of information (Grice, 1975).

In this work, we demonstrate that it is possi-
ble to overcome reporting bias and still extract the
unspoken knowledge from language. The key in-
sight is this: there is consistency in the way people
describe how they interact with the world, which
provides vital clues to reverse engineer the com-
mon knowledge shared among people. More con-
cretely, we frame knowledge acquisition as joint
inference over two closely related puzzles: in-
ferring relative physical knowledge about object
pairs while simultaneously reasoning about physi-
cal implications of actions.

Importantly, four of five dimensions of knowl-
edge in our study—weight, strength, rigidness,
and speed—are either not visual or not easily rec-
ognizable by image recognition using currently
available computer vision techniques. Thus, our
work provides unique value to complement re-
cent attempts to acquire commonsense knowledge
from web images (Izadinia et al., 2015; Bagher-
inezhad et al., 2016; Sadeghi et al., 2015).

In sum, our contributions are threefold:

• We introduce a new task in the domain
of commonsense knowledge extraction from
language, focusing on the physical implica-

tions of actions and the relative physical re-
lations among objects, organized along five
dimensions.
• We propose a model that can infer relations

over grounded object pairs together with first
order relations implied by physical verbs.
• We develop a new dataset VERBPHYSICS

that compiles crowdsourced knowledge of
actions and objects.1

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We
first provide the formal definition of knowledge
we aim to learn in Section 2. We then describe
our data collection in Section 3 and present our in-
ference model in Section 4. Empirical results are
given in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6. We
review related work in Section 7 and conclude in
Section 8.

2 Representation of Relative Physical
Knowledge

2.1 Knowledge Dimensions
We consider five dimensions of relative physical
knowledge in this work: size, weight, strength,
rigidness, and speed. “Strength” in our work
refers to the physical durability of an object (e.g.,
“diamond” is stronger than “glass”), while “rigid-
ness” refers to the physical flexibility of an object
(e.g., “glass” is more rigid than a “wire”). When
considered in verb implications, size, weight,
strength, and rigidness concern individual-level
semantics; the relative properties implied by verbs
in these dimensions are true in general. On the
other hand, speed concerns stage-level semantics;
its implied relations hold only during a window
surrounding the verb.2

2.2 Relative physical knowledge
Let us first consider the problem of representing
relative physical knowledge between two objects.
We can write a single piece of knowledge like “A
person is larger than a basketball” as

person >size basketball

Any propositional statement can have exceptions
and counterexamples. Moreover, we need to cope

2We thank reviewer two for pointing us to this terminol-

ogy and for the illustrative example: “When a person throws a
ball, the ball is faster than the person (stage-level) but it’s not
true in general that balls are faster than people (individual-
level).”

with uncertainties involved in knowledge acquisi-
tion. Therefore, we assume each piece of knowl-
edge is associated with a probability distribution.
More formally, given objects x and y, we define a
random variable Oax,y whose range is {>, <,'}
with respect to a knowledge dimension a ∈
{SIZE,WEIGHT,STRENGTH,RIGIDNESS,SPEED}
so that:

P(Oax,y = r), r ∈ {>, <,'}.

This immediately provides two simple properties:

P(Ox,y = >) = P(Oy,x = <)
P(Ox,x = ') = 1

2.3 Physical Implications of Verbs
Next we consider representing relative physical
implications of actions applied over two objects.
For example, consider an action frame “x threw
y.” In general, following implications are likely to
be true:

“x threw y” =⇒ x >size y
“x threw y” =⇒ x >weight y
“x threw y” =⇒ x <speed y

Again, in order to cope with exceptions and uncer-
tainties, we assume a probability distribution asso-
ciated with each implication. More formally, we
define a random variable F av to denote the impli-
cation of the action verb v when applied over its
arguments x and y with respect to a knowledge di-
mension a so that:

P(F sizethrew = >) := P(“x threw y”⇒ x >size y)
P(Fwgtthrew = >) := P(“x threw y”⇒ x >wgt y)

where the range of F sizethrew is {>, <,'}. Intu-
itively, F sizethrew represents the likely first order re-
lation implied by “throw” over ungrounded (i.e.,
variable) object pairs.

The above definition assumes that there is only a
single implication relation for any given verb with
respect to a specific knowledge dimension. This
is generally not true, since a verb, especially a
common action verb, can often invoke a number
of different frames according to frame semantics
(Fillmore, 1976). Thus, given a number of differ-
ent frame relations v1...vT associated with a verb
v, we define random variables F with respect to
a specific frame relation vt, i.e., F avt . We use this
notation going forward.

Frame Perspective on Verb Implications: Fig-
ure 2 illustrates the frame-centric view of physical
implication knowledge we aim to learn. Impor-
tantly, the key insight of our work is inspired by
Fillmore’s original manuscript on frame seman-
tics (Fillmore, 1976). Fillmore has argued that
“frames”—the contexts in which utterances are
situated—should be considered as a third primi-
tive of describing a language, along with a gram-
mar and lexicon. While existing frame annotations
such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank
(Palmer et al., 2005), and VerbNet (Kipper et al.,
2000) provide rich frame knowledge associated

268



with a predicate, none of them provide the exact
kind of physical implications we consider in our
paper. Thus, our work can potentially contribute
to these resources by investigating new approaches
to automatically recover richer frame knowledge
from language. In addition, our work is motivated
by the formal semantics of Dowty (1991), as the
task of learning verb implications is essentially
that of extracting lexical entailments for verbs.

3 Data and Crowdsourced Knowledge

Action Verbs: We pick 50 classes of Levin
verbs from both “alternation classes” and “verb
classes” (Levin, 1993), which corresponds to
about 1100 unique verbs. We sort this list by fre-
quency of occurrence in our frame patterns in the
Google Syntax Ngrams corpus (Goldberg and Or-
want, 2013) and pick the top 100 verbs.

Action Frames: Figure 2 illustrates examples
of action frame relations. Because we consider
implications over pairwise argument relations for
each frame, there are sometimes multiple frame
relations we consider for a single frame. To enu-
merate action frame relations for each verb, we use
syntactic patterns based on dependency parse by
extracting the core components (subject, verb, di-
rect object, prepositional object) of an action, then
map the subject to an agent, the direct object to a
theme, and the prepositional object to a goal.3 For
those frames that involve an argument in a prepo-
sitional phrase, we create a separate frame for each
preposition based on the statistics observed in the
Google Syntax Ngram corpus.

Because the syntax ngram corpus provides only
tree snippets without context, this way of enu-
merating potential frame patterns tend to over-
generate. Thus we refine our prepositions for each
frame by taking either the intersection or union
with the top 5 Google Surface Ngrams (Michel
et al., 2011), depending on whether the frame was
under- or over-generating. We also add an ad-
ditional crowdsourcing step where we ask crowd
workers to judge whether a frame pattern with a
particular verb and preposition could plausibly be
found in a sentence. This process results in 813
frame templates, an average of 8.13 per verb.

3Future research could use an SRL parser instead. We use
dependency parse to benefit from the Google Syntax Ngram
dataset that provides language statistics over an extremely
large corpus, which does not exist for SRL.

Table 1: Statistics of crowdsourced knowledge.
Frames are partitioned by verb. Counts are shown
for usable data, which includes only ≥ 2/3 agree-
ment and removes all with “no relation.” Each pre-
diction task (frames or object pairs) is given 5% of
that domain’s data as seed. We compare models
using either 5% or 20% of the other domain’s data
as seed.

Object Pairs: To provide a source of ground
truth relations between objects, we select the ob-
ject pairs that occur in the 813 frame templates
with positive pointwise mutual information (PMI)
across the Google Syntax Ngram corpus. After
replacing a small set of “human” nouns with a
generic HUMAN object, filtering out nouns labeled
as abstract by WordNet (Miller, 1995), and distill-
ing all surface forms to their lemmas (also with
WordNet), the result is 3656 object pairs.

3.1 Crowdsourcing Knowledge

We collect human judgements of the frame knowl-
edge implications to use as a small set of seed
knowledge (5%), a development set (45%), and a
test set (50%). Crowd workers are given with a
frame template such as “x threw y,” and then asked
to list a few plausible objects (including people
and animals) for the missing slots (e.g., x and y).4

4This step is to prime them for thinking about the partic-
ular template; we do not use the objects they provided.

269



We then ask them to rate the general relationship
that the arguments of the frame exhibit with re-
spect to all knowledge dimensions (size, weight,
etc.). For each knowledge dimension, or attribute,
a, workers select an answer from (1) x >a y, (2)
x <a y, (3) x 'a y, or (4) no general relation.

We conduct a similar crowdsourcing step for
the set of object pairs. We ask crowd workers
to compare each of the 3656 object pairs along
the five knowledge dimensions we consider, se-
lecting an answer from the same options above as
with frames. We reserve 50% of the data as a test
set, and split the remainder up either 5% / 45%
or 20% / 30% (seed / development) to investigate
the effects of different seed knowledge sizes on the
model.

Statistics for the dataset are provided in Table 1.
About 90% of the frames as well as object pairs
had 2/3 agreement between workers. After remov-
ing frame/attribute combinations and object pairs
that received less than 2/3 agreement, or were se-
lected by at least 2/3 workers to have no relation,
we end up with roughly 400–600 usable frames
and 2100–2500 usable object pairs per attribute.

4 Model

We model knowledge acquisition as probabilistic
inference over a factor graph of knowledge. As
shown in Figure 3, the graph consists of multiple
substrates (page-wide boxes) corresponding to dif-
ferent knowledge dimensions (shown only three of
them —strength, size, weight—for brevity). Each
substrate consists of two types of sub-graphs: verb
subgraphs and object subgraphs, which are con-
nected through factors that quantify action–object
compatibilities. Connecting across substrates are
factors that model inter-dependencies across dif-
ferent knowledge dimensions. In what follows, we
describe each graph component.

4.1 Nodes

The factor graph contains two types of nodes in or-
der to capture two classes of knowledge. The first
type of nodes are object pair nodes. Each object
pair node is a random variable Oax,y which cap-
tures the relative strength of an attribute a between
objects x and y.

The second type of nodes are frame nodes. Each
frame node is a random variable F avt . This corre-
sponds to the verb v used in a particular type of
frame t, and captures the implied knowledge the

frame vt holds along an attribute a.
All random variables take on the values
{>, <,'}. For an object pair node Oax,y, the
value represents the belief about the relation be-
tween x and y along the attribute a. For a frame
node F avt , the value represents the belief about the
relation along the attribute a between any two ob-
jects that might be used in the frame vt.

We denote the sets of all object pair and frame
random variables O and F , respectively.

4.2 Action–Object Compatibility

The key aspect of our work is to reason about
two types of knowledge simultaneously: relative
knowledge of grounded object pairs, and implica-
tions of actions related to those objects. Thus we
connect the verb subgraphs and object subgraphs
through selectional preference factors ψs between
two such nodes Oax,y and F

a
vt if we find evidence

from text that suggests objects x and y are used in
the frame vt. These factors encourage both ran-
dom variables to agree on the same value.

As an example, consider a node Osizep,b which
represents the relative size of a person and a bas-
ketball, and a node F sizethrewdobj which represents the
relative size implied by an “x threw y” frame. If
we find significant evidence in text that “[person]
threw [basketball]” occurs, we would add a se-
lectional preference factor to connect Osizep,b with
F sizethrewdobj and encourage them towards the same
value. This means that if it is discovered that peo-
ple are larger than basketballs (the value >), then
we would expect the frame “x threw y” to entail
x >size y (also the value >).

4.3 Semantic Similarities

Some frames have relatively sparse text evidences
to support their corresponding knowledge acqui-
sition. Thus, we include several types of factors
based on semantic similarities as described below.

Cross-Verb Frame Similarity: We add a group
of factors ψv between two verbs v and u (to con-
nect a specific frame of v with a corresponding
frame of u) based on the verb-level similarities.

Within-Verb Frame Similarity: Within each
verb v, which consists of a set of frame relations
v1, ...vT , we also include frame-level similarity
factors ψf between vi and vj . This gives us more
evidence over a broader range of frames when tex-
tual evidence might be sparse.

Figure 3: High level view of the factor graph model. Performance on both learning relative knowledge
about objects (right), as well as entailed knowledge from verbs (center) via realized frames (left), is
improved by modeling their interplay (orange). Unary seed (ψseed) and embedding (ψemb) factors are
omitted for clarity.

Object Similarity: As with verbs, we add fac-
tors ψo that encourage similar pairs of objects to
take the same value. Given that each node rep-
resents a pair of objects, finding that x and y are
similar yields two main cases in how to add fac-
tors (aside from the trivial case where the variable
Oax,y is given a unary factor to encourage the value
').

1. If nodes Ox,z and Oy,z exist, we expect ob-
jects x and y to both have a similar relation
to z. We add a factor that encourages Ox,z
and Oy,z to take the same value. The same is
true if nodes Oz,x and Oz,y exist.

2. On the other hand, if nodesOx,z andOz,y ex-
ist, we expect these two nodes to reach the
opposite decision. In this case, we add a fac-
tor that encourages one node to take the value
> if the other prefers the value <, and vice
versa. (For the case of ', if one prefers that
value, then both should.)

4.4 Cross-Knowledge Correlation

Some knowledge dimensions, such as size and
weight, have a significant correlation in their im-
plied relations. For two such attributes a and b, if
the same frame F avi and F

b
vi exists in both graphs,

we add a factor ψa between them to push them to-
wards taking the same value.

4.5 Seed Knowledge

In order to kick off learning, we provide a small set
of seed knowledge among the random variables in
{O,F} with seed factors ψseed. These unary seed
factors push the belief for its associated random
variable strongly towards the seed label.

4.6 Potential Functions

Unary Factors: For all frame and object pair
random variables in the training set, we train a
maximum entropy classifier to predict the value
of the variable. We then use the probabilities of
the classifier as potentials for seed factors given to
all random variables in their class (frame or ob-
ject pair). Each log-linear classifier is trained sep-
arately per attribute on a featurized vector of the
variable:

P(r|Xa) ∝ ewa·f(Xa)

The feature function is defined differently accord-
ing to the node type:

f(Oap,q) := 〈g(p), g(q)〉
f(F avt) := 〈h(t), g(v), g(t)〉

Here g(x) is the GloVe word embedding (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) for the word x (t is the frame
relation’s preposition, and g(t) is simply set to the
zero vector if there is no preposition) and h(t) is
a one-hot vector of the frame relation type. We
use GloVe vectors of 100 dimensions for verbs and
50 dimensions for objects and prepositions (the di-
mensions picked based on development set).

Binary Factors: In the case of all other factors,
we use a “soft 1” agreement matrix with strong
signal down the diagonals:




> ' <
> 0.7 0.1 0.2
' 0.15 0.7 0.15
< 0.2 0.1 0.7




4.7 Inference

After our full graph is constructed, we use belief
propagation to infer the assignments of frames and
object pairs not in our training data. Each mes-
sage µ is a vector where each element is the prob-
ability that a random variable takes on each value
x ∈ {>, <,'}. A message passed from a ran-
dom variable v to a neighboring factor f about
the value x is the product of the messages from
its other neighboring factors about x:

µv→f (x) ∝
∏

f ′∈N(v)\{f}
µf ′→v(x)

A message passed from a factor f with potential
ψ to a random variable v about its value x is a
marginalized belief about v taking value x from
the other neighboring random variables combined

with its potential:

µf→v(x) ∝
∑

x:x[v]=x

ψ(x)
∏

v′∈N(f)\{v}
µv′→f (x[v

′])

After stopping belief propagation, the marginals
for a node can be computed and used as a deci-
sion for that random variable. The marginal for
v taking value x is the product of its surrounding
factors’ messages:

v(x) ∝
∏

f∈N(v)
µf→v(x)

5 Experimental Results

Factor Graph Construction: We first need to
pick a set of frames and objects to determine our
set of random variables. The frames are simply
the subset of the frames that were crowdsourced
in the given configuration (e.g., seed + dev), with
“soft 1” unary seed factors (the gold label indexed
row of the binary factor matrix) given only to those
in the seed set. The same selection criteria and
seed factors are applied to the crowdsourced ob-
ject pairs.

For lexical similarity factors (ψv, ψo), we pick
connections based on the cosine similarity scores
of GloVe vectors thresholded above a value chosen
based on development set performance. Attribute
similarity factors (ψa) are chosen based on sets of
frames that reach largely the same decisions on the
seed data (95%). Frame similarity factors (ψf ) are
added to pairs of frames with linguistically sim-
ilar constructions. Finally, selectional preference

factors (ψs) are picked by using a threshold (also
tuned on the development set) of pointwise mu-
tual information (PMI) between the frames and
the object pairs’ occurrences in the Google Syn-
tax Ngram corpus.

For each task, we consider the set of factors to
include in each model a hyperparameter, which is
also tuned on the development set.

Baselines: Baselines include making a RAN-
DOM choice, picking between >, <, and '), pick-
ing the MAJORITY label, and a maximum entropy
classifier based on the embedding representations
(EMB-MAXENT) defined in Section 4.6.

Inferring Knowledge of Actions: Our first ex-
periment is to predict knowledge implied by new
frames. In this task, 5% of the frames are avail-
able as seed knowledge. We experiment with two
different sets of seed knowledge for the object pair
data: OUR MODEL (A) uses only 5% of the object
pair data as seed, and OUR MODEL (B) uses 20%.

The full results for the baseline methods and our
model are given in the upper half of Table 2. Our
model outperforms the baselines on all attributes
except for the speed, which has a highly skewed
label distribution to allow the majority baseline to

similarity factors hindered performance.

perform well. Ablations are given in Table 3, and
sample correct predictions from the development
set are shown in examples 1–5 of Figure 4.

Inferring Knowledge of Objects: Our second
experiment is to predict the correct relations of
new object pairs. The data for this task is the
inverse of before: 5% of the object pairs are
available as seed knowledge, and we experiment
with both 5% (OUR MODEL (A)) and 20% (OUR
MODEL (B)) frames given as seed data. Again,
both are independently tuned on the development
data. Results for this task are presented in the
lower half of Table 2. While OUR MODEL (A) is
competitive with the strongest baseline, introduc-
ing the additional frame data allows OUR MODEL
(B) to reach the highest accuracy.

6 Discussion

Metaphorical Language: While our frame pat-
terns are intended to capture action verbs, our tem-
plates also match senses of those verbs that can
be used with abstract or metaphorical arguments,
rather than directly physical ones. One exam-
ple from the development set is “x contained y.”
While x and y can be real objects, more abstract
senses of “contained” could involve y as a “for-
est fire” or even a “revolution.” In these instances,
x >size y is plausible as an abstract notion: if
some entity can contain a revolution, we might
think that entity as “larger” or “stronger” than the
revolution.

Error analysis: Examples 6–10 in Figure 4
highlight failure cases for the model. Example

273



6 shows a case where the comparison is non-
sensical because “for” would naturally be fol-
lowed by a purpose (“He drove the car for work.”)
or a duration (“She drove the car for hours.”)
rather than a concrete object whose size is mea-
surable. Example 7 highlights an underspecified
frame. One crowd worker provided the example,
“PERSON stopped the fly with {the jar / a swat-
ter},” where fly <weight {jar, swatter}. How-
ever, two crowd workers provided examples like
“PERSON stopped their car with the brake,” where
clearly car >weight brake. This example il-
lustrates complex underlying physics we do not
model: a brake—the pedal itself—is used to stop
a car, but it does so by applying significant force
through a separate system.

The next two examples are cases where the
model nearly predicts correctly (8, e.g., “She lived
at the office.”) and is just clearly wrong (9, e.g.,
“He snipped off a locket of hair”). Example 10
demonstrates a case of polysemy where the model
picks the wrong side. In the phrase, “She caught
the runner in first,”, it is correct that she >speed

runner. However, the sense chosen by the crowd
workers is that of, “She caught the baseball,”
where indeed she <speed baseball.

7 Related work

Several works straddle the gap between IE, knowl-
edge base completion, and learning commonsense
knowledge from text. Earlier works in these areas
use large amounts of text to try to extract general
statements like “A THING CAN BE READABLE”
(Gordon et al., 2010) and frequencies of events
(Gordon and Schubert, 2012). Our work focuses
on specific domains of knowledge rather than gen-
eral statements or occurrence statistics, and devel-
ops a frame-centric approach to circumvent report-
ing bias. Other work uses a knowledge base and
scores unseen tuples based on similarity to exist-
ing ones (Angeli and Manning, 2013; Li et al.,
2016). Relatedly, previous work uses natural lan-
guage inference to infer new facts from a dataset
of commonsense facts that can be extracted from
unstructured text (Angeli and Manning, 2014). In
contrast, we focus on a small number of specific
types of knowledge without access to an existing
database of knowledge.

A number of recent works combine multi-
modal input to learn visual attributes (Bruni et al.,
2012; Silberer et al., 2013), extract commonsense

knowledge from web images (Tandon et al., 2016),
and overcome reporting bias (Misra et al., 2016).
In contrast, we focus on natural language evidence
to reason about attributes that are both in (size)
and out (weight, rigidness, etc.) of the scope of
computer vision. Yet other works mine numerical
attributes of objects (Narisawa et al., 2013; Taka-
mura and Tsujii, 2015; Davidov and Rappoport,
2010) and comparative knowledge from the web
(Tandon et al., 2014). Our work uniquely learns
verb-centric lexical entailment knowledge.

A handful of works have attempted to learn the
types of knowledge we address in this work. One
recent work tried to directly predict several binary
attributes (such “is large” and “is yellow”) from on
off-the-shelf word embeddings, noting that accu-
racy was very low (Rubinstein et al., 2015). An-
other line of work addressed grounding verbs in
the context of robotic tasks. One paper in this
line acquires verb meanings by observing state
changes in the environment (She and Chai, 2016).
Another work in this line does a deep investigation
of eleven verbs, modeling their physical effect via
annotated images along eighteen attributes (Gao
et al., 2016). These works are encouraging inves-
tigations into multimodal groundings of a small set
of verbs. Our work instead grounds into a fixed set
of attributes but leverages language on a broader
scale to learn about more verbs in more diverse set
of frames.

8 Conclusion

We presented a novel take on verb-centric frame
semantics to learn implied physical knowledge la-
tent in verbs. Empirical results confirm that by
modeling changes in physical attributes entailed
by verbs together with objects that exhibit these
properties, we are able to better infer new knowl-
edge in both domains.
