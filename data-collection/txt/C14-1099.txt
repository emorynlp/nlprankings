Abstract

Finding a definition of compoundhood that is cross-lingually valid is a non-trivial task as shown
by linguistic literature. We present an iterative method for defining and extracting English noun
compounds in a multilingual setting. We show how linguistic criteria can be used to extract
compounds automatically and vice versa how the results of this extraction can shed new lights
on linguistic theories about compounding. The extracted compound nouns and their multilingual
contexts are a rich source that serves several purposes. In an additional case study we show how
the database serves to predict the internal structure of tripartite noun compounds using spelling
variations across languages, which leads to a precision of over 91%.

1 Introduction

Compounding is a phenomenon that is studied extensively in linguistic literature. Also in computational
linguistics, compounds are enjoying more and more attention (Ó Séaghdha, 2008; Hendrickx et al.,
2013). Compounding is a very productive word formation. Already 2-year-olds are able to form new
words by using compounds consisting of two morphemes (Clark, 1981). As a consequence, compounds
are a very common word type but many occur with a very low token count. In an analysis of the German
APA corpus, Baroni et al. (2002) found that almost half (47%) of the word types were compounds. At
the same time, the compounds accounted for a small portion of the overall token count (7%), which
suggests that many of them are rare (83% of the compounds had a corpus frequency of 5 or lower). For
English, more than half of the two-noun compounds (e.g., car park) in the BNC occur exactly once (Kim
and Baldwin, 2006). The high productivity of compounds makes compositional approaches to automatic
processing indispensable: listing all possible compounds in a dictionary would be as infeasible as listing
all possible adjective-noun combinations. Even for compound nouns that occur 10 times or more in the
BNC, static English dictionaries provide only 27% coverage (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).

Being abundant as a phenomenon but scarce in terms of individual examples (the combination of
high type frequency and low token frequency) makes the analysis of these compound nouns particularly
problematic for statistical techniques that need high token frequencies to make accurate predictions. Data
sparsity is expected to lead to low performance. However, the correct analysis of compound nouns is
important for a number of NLP tasks, for example in machine translation (Bouillon et al., 1992; Rackow
et al., 1992; Johnston and Busa, 1999; Navigli et al., 2003). The accurate translation of compounds is
non-trivial, because we find a large amount of variation in the way languages deal with compounding.
Some languages such as German use closed compounding (i.e., they create one-word compounds, e.g.,
Todesstrafe (death penalty)) whereas others do not. In Romance languages, such as French, compounds
are not as productive, instead postmodifying prepositional phrases (e.g., peine de mort) and adjectives
(peine capitale) are used to construct complex nominals.

Another challenge in compound translation is due to the fact that the amount of underspecification in
compound surface structure varies between languages. For example, whereas English leaves the com-
pound relation (i.e., the semantic relation between two components, e.g., N2 made of N1 as in iron door)

covert, in French we find prepositions that correlate with the relation type (Girju, 2007; Celli and Nissim,
2009). Chocolate cake, cake made of chocolate, is translated with gateau au chocolat, whereas wedding
cake, cake made for a wedding, is gateau de marriage.

The first aim of this study is to extract a large database of compounds and their translations in context
from a parallel corpus. This database will serve multiple purposes. For example, it will be used to study
compounding across different languages, and we will exploit the cross-lingual variation for compound
processing. In the second part of this paper, we will show a case study of how the extracted database
can be used for analysing the structure of noun phrases, more specifically, we exploit spelling variations
across languages for bracketing three-noun compounds (3NCs) such as air traffic control, which could be
indicated as LEFT bracketing using the German phrase Kontrolle des Luftverkehrs (control of air traffic).

Compounding is an important subject of study in theoretical linguistics, because it constitutes a con-
tinuum from fully compositional to idiosyncratic word formation and is found at the boundary between
words and phrases. However, there is virtually no reliable and universally accepted criterion for distin-
guishing compounds from phrases or other types of word formations, as stated by Lieber and Stekauer
(2009). They discuss reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds, that we will
review in the next section. They do, however, also describe a number of linguistic tests, each with their
own advantages and drawbacks.

This brings us to the second aim of this paper. We propose an iterative method that, in absence of a
clear definition, validates several linguistic tests on corpus data and continuously refines the definition.
We show how we use linguistic tests to extract compounds automatically and vice versa how the results
of this extraction can shed new lights on linguistic theory about compoundhood. The multilingual nature
of our data (we work on parallel corpora) has the additional advantage that a cross-lingual definition can
be sought by studying compounds in context and their translation across several languages.

In Section 2, we discuss the problem of defining noun compounds (NCs) as described by Lieber and
Stekauer (2009) and present an iterative method for defining and extracting English NCs starting with
an initial definition based on some linguistic tests. In Section 3, we present our method for extracting
English NCs and their translations to several languages from a parallel corpus using a set of extraction
rules. An experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4. In Section 5 we show in a case
study of bracketing three-noun compounds how our database serves for exploiting multilingual spelling
variations. Section 6 describes related work and finally Section 7 concludes.

2 Iterative method for the definition and extraction of noun compounds

In this section, we outline the controversy of defining compoundhood as described in linguistic literature.
We present several linguistic tests for distinguishing compounds and show how we implement some
linguistic criteria that can be used for identification and extraction of noun compounds and how these
constitute the initial definition.

2.1 Definition of compounds and linguistic criteria

When we seek to find a working definition of noun compounds (NCs), we have to keep in mind that not
only the definition but also the existence of such an NC is controversial. Lieber and Stekauer (2009)
present a discussion about this controversy sketched below. While Bauer (2003) defines a compound as
a “formation of a new lexeme by adjoining two or more lexemes”, Marchand (1967) argues that there
is no compounding word formation at all. Instead, he uses the word formation EXPANSION, which
combines prefixed words like reheat with such as steamboat using the criterion of a free head. Lieber
and Stekauer (2009) highlight two reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds.
Firstly, in some languages, constituents are not free but stems or roots. For example, the Slovak term
rýchlovlak (express train) starts with the stem of the adjective rýchly (as in the phrase rýchly vlak (fast
train)). The lack of inflection in English makes compositional and phrasal structures (i.e., fast train as
phrase or as compound (express train)) collapse. Secondly, sometimes phrases and derivations cannot be
distinguished from compounds. While blackboard (in opposition to a black board) can be classified as
compound without dissent, a tomato bowl that just happens to hold tomatoes might not be regarded as a

1048



single lexeme (conforming Bauer’s (2003) definition).
So, the only way for getting a suitable definition is to find solid criterions. Although Lieber and

Stekauer (2009) come to the conclusion that there is almost no reliable and universally accepted criterion,
they mention several plausible tests. Compounds can be identified by prosody. While in the phrase black
bird, the head (bird) is stressed, in the compound blackbird the stress is on the first syllable (black).
A syntactic test mentioned by Lieber and Stekauer (2009) is inseparability, i.e., there must not be any
element intervening a compound’s components. While black bird can be understood as compound, black
ugly bird is a phrase. Another promising syntactic criterion is the inability to modify the first element
(i.e., the modifier) of a compound. In a phrase like social person, the first element (social) can be
modified (i.e., very social person). This is not possible for compounds (e.g., very social policy). A last
syntactic criterion, the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform such
as one (e.g., black bird vs. black one), would need human support. A morphological criterion states that
in compounds only the head is inflected. Although this assumption does not always hold (as shown in
examples like overseas investor or girls club), this seems to be a promising criterion when investigating
inflectional behaviour in aligned languages that show strong morphology, e.g., French. Conversely,
determining compoundhood on the basis of spelling is discarded by Lieber and Stekauer (2009). English
orthography is highly inconsistent: some compounds usually occur as a closed compound (e.g., football),
some occur hyphenated and some occur as an open compound (e.g., waiting room or rule of law). For
some compounds, several spellings are possible (e.g., flowerpot, flower-pot, flower pot or pot of flowers).

In our study, we focus on written language as given in a parallel corpus. Since we do not have any
speech data, we cannot use any phonological features such as stress for the extraction of noun com-
pounds. For the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform, we cannot
assess if the meaning of a sentence would have changed (e.g., We see blackbirds vs. We see black ones).

In this paper, we focus on criteria that are most suitable with the current data. Although Lieber and
Stekauer (2009) exclude spelling as a reliable criterion of compoundhood, we take it as starting point.
The parallel corpus we use for the extraction includes several languages. Spelling variations between
languages can be exploited to find compounds (e.g., social policy can be written as one word in German
(Sozialpolitik)). We account for the English spelling variations by defining part-of-speech (PoS) patterns
that cover most plausible spellings. These PoS patterns treat each noun or adjective as a compound’s
component and thus, this way of extraction inherently implements the criterion of inseparability. We
exploit multilingual evidence in terms of cross-lingual differences in spelling to extract compounds.
Diverse language families have different declinations of forming a closed compound. While languages
like Danish and German prefer closed compounding, English and Romance languages like Spanish use
open compounds. It is this spelling variation that we base our first set of extraction rules on with the aim
of having a set of English NCs and their translations in up to 9 European languages. We will show that
cross-lingual closed compounding is a promising feature for extracting English NCs.

The inability to modify the first element of a compound seems to be a promising test. Since there
are many linguistic factors that have to be taken into account (e.g., morphological agreement in gender,
number or case), we plan to include this criterion for several languages and any combination of contextual
modifier and potential noun compound. We will implement this and further morphological criteria in
future work.

2.2 Initial definition for compound extraction

With a focus on multilingual validity, we adapt the definition of Bauer (2003) to our multilingual setting.
Inspired by Behagel’s (1909) First Law (“Elements that belong close together intellectually will also be
placed close together”), we associate a closed compounding language realising an English word sequence
as a closed NC with an indicator for compoundhood:

Initial definition: A noun compound is a nominal composition of several lexemes that are represented
as a one-word expression in some of the languages studied.

This definition covers both target single words (e.g., blackbird translates to German as Amsel) or target

1049



closed compounds (e.g., football match translates to Dutch as voetbalwedstrijd).
We are aware of the fact that this definition leads to some controversial cases for English word se-

quences including pre-nominal adjectives. While some of them are commonly accepted such as social
policy (German: Sozialpolitik), others are less accepted such as strong wind (German: Starkwind) or
small car (German: Kleinwagen). This is not an unwanted side-effect. On the contrary, these contro-
versial cases are an essential part of the iterative process we described, as they will foster linguistic
discussions. Although the German Starkwind can be regarded as partly compositional, it is frequently
used with a concrete definition (in contrast to the phrase starker Wind) and cannot occur in a context
violating this definition, as shown in the table below.

1 a) Als Starkwind wird meist eine Windstärke zwischen 6 und 7 Beaufort bezeichnet.
1 b) A {strong wind} usually refers to a wind force of 6-7 Beaufort.
2 a) Am Samstag weht ein starker Wind mit Windstärke 8 von Westen.
2 b) On Saturday, a strong wind with wind force 8 will blow from the west.
3 a) *Am Samstag weht ein Starkwind mit Windstärke 8 von Westen.
3 b) On Saturday, a *{strong wind} with wind force 8 will blow from the west.

3 Multilingual extraction of NCs

This method is based on the initial definition for compound extraction described in Section 2.2 and can be
adapted in succeeding iterations. English NCs are extracted from a parallel corpus that includes English
and some closed compounding languages (e.g., German).

3.1 Preprocessing the parallel data
In Section 4.1, we describe the tokenization, sentence alignment, word alignment and PoS tagging we
apply to the parallel data in more detail. In addition, we perform a binary compound splitter on each
word that is tagged as a noun by following a variant of the methods of Stymne et al., (2013). This un-
supervised splitter checks each noun for all possible segmentations into at most two components with at
least two characters. All possible segmentations are scored with the geometric mean of the components’
frequencies in the parallel corpus. The highest-scored segmentation (possibly with no split point) is used.

3.2 Preselection of English noun compounds using PoS patterns
As a basis for the extraction of English NCs, we use a set of possible English PoS sequences that can
constitute an NC. These PoS patterns account for the various ways of composing English NCs and for the
inseparability property as described in Section 2.1. Table 1 lists all plausible PoS patterns for bipartite and
tripartite NCs with some examples (cf. the Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus et al., 1993)). For all examples
in Table 1, we found translations to a closed compound in German, which satisfies our initial definition
described in Section 2.2, e.g., overall recovery rate has been translated to Gesamtrückforderungsquote.
Although the larger the number of components, the sparser the number of (correct) extractions, we create
a regular expression for PoS patterns that cover English NCs with n components (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10).
This regular expression combines all possible combinations of observed NC types. In the next step, we
will filter noise, that occurs mostly in longer word sequences.

3.3 Noise filters
The selection of English NCs and their translations is based on automatic preprocessing, which leads to
some noise due to false PoS tags or flaws in word alignment. With increasing word sequence length, the
amount of noise increases. We apply several filters on each preselected NC and on their alignments to
all other languages in the corpus and keep only those that pass all filters.

3.3.1 PoS filters
1. Two filters are applied to all languages: we disqualify word sequences including nouns or adjectives

that (1) consist of only one character or (2) are contained in a stop list1.

Table 1: English PoS sequences for noun compounds

2. Then, to account for PoS tagging errors in English, we collect all words and their PoS tags in the
parallel corpus. For each word, we compute the probability of being tagged as a noun or adjective
as given in (1).

P (noun/adj | word) = f((noun ∪ adj) ∩ word)
f(word)

(1)

We disqualify English word sequences, if they contain a noun or adjective w with
P (noun/adj | w) < θ. After testing several values for θ, we have decided to choose θ = 0.15
because it has turned out to be a promising trade-off between coverage and precision (e.g., accept-
ing words like human but rejecting words like anywhere).

3.3.2 Word alignment filter

Shortcomings in word alignment quality are remedied with three word alignment filters.

1. We truncate extraneous words (i.e., determiners, prepositions and (ad)verbs) from the border of the
word sequence (adjectives are removed from the right border for Germanic languages and from the
left border for Romance languages).

2. We disqualify the word sequence as being phrasal if it contains two consecutive nouns with verbs or
adjectives in between or if the nouns are more than φ tokens apart from each other. When analysing
many instances of Romance phrases aligned to an English noun compound, we observed that φ = 3
is the maximum token distance two nominal components can be apart (usually separated by prepo-
sition or preposition+determiner). If the word sequence is qualified as phrasal, we add determiners
and prepositions that occur in the context between the nouns, otherwise the word sequence remains
unchanged.

3. We remove the word sequence if it does not contain at least one noun.

The resulting set of English word sequences that conform to the regular expression in Table 1 and their
aligned and filtered word sequences are stored as a set of m-tuples of word sequences. Subsequently,
we will refer to this set as the basic set. The basic set still contains English word sequences that do not
comply with our initial definition for compound extraction (Section 2.2), i.e., that are not aligned to a
closed compound. In the next step, we apply a restrictor to all NCs in the basic set and keep only those
instances that pass the restrictor.

1051



3.4 Closed compound restrictor

An English word sequence is considered to be an NC if it is represented as a one-word expression in some
of the closed compounding languages (e.g., Dutch, German, Swedish, . . . ). Given a parallel corpus with
n > 1 closed compounding languages, this definition leaves space for investigating the degree of cross-
lingual closed compounding (degclosed) which is necessary for optimal extraction quality (i.e., optimal
precision and recall). Because the rules described in Section 3.3.2 still leave some word alignment errors
(i.e., English word sequences that are aligned to only a part of the true translation), a single compounding
language realising the English word sequence as one word (i.e., degclosed = 1) might not be restrictive
enough.

The closed compound restrictor with degclosed ≥ i retains only English word sequences that are
aligned to at least i one-word expressions in the aligned closed compounding languages. We will refer
to this restrictor as CCR(i) and to the resulting data set as closed compound(i).

4 Experiments for NC Extraction

4.1 Setup

Data and preprocessing. We use the 7th release of the Europarl corpus2. Although the Europarl corpus
comprises 21 European languages, the amount of common data they cover is rather small. This means,
the more languages we use, the smaller the amount of common data. In order to get a good trade-off
between cross-lingual coverage and language variation exploitation, we decided on a set of 10 languages:
English, the closed compounding languages Danish, Dutch, German and Swedish, as well as Greek and
the Romance languages French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Instead of preprocessing the parallel
corpus on our own, we exploit the already preprocessed Europarl resource of OPUS3 (Tiedemann, 2012).
This preprocessed resource is PoS tagged using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) for English, Dutch, German,
French, Italian and Spanish and the Hunpos4 tagger for Danish, Portuguese and Swedish. We additionally
tagged the Greek data using the MATE5 tagger. The sentence alignment provided by OPUS is restricted
to language pairs. As we need a sentence representation that is parallel in all 10 languages, we apply
the OPUS sentence aligner (with English as pivot) on our language set and extract a total of 884,164
parallel sentence representations. The word alignment information provided by OPUS was also based on
language pairs. This means, the sentence-wise token indices has to be adapted to our updated sentence
representation (which is different due to a larger language set). In OPUS, the word alignment tool GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003) has been used with the symmetrisation heuristics (grow-diag-final-and (Koehn et
al., 2007)).

4.2 Evaluation procedure and scoring

In order to compare the added value in terms of recall and precision of each closed compound restrictor
(i.e., CCR(1) to CCR(4)), we randomly select 50 accepted and 50 rejected English word sequences for
each restrictor. We rate the correctness of acceptance and rejection and compute precision and recall as
given in (2) and (3). F-Score is defined as harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Precision =
accepted ∩ correct

accepted
(2)

Recall =
accepted ∩ correct

(accepted ∩ correct) ∪ (rejected ∩ incorrect) (3)

The precision of the basic set is measured as the accuracy of a 50 sample subset. We do not compute
recall and F-Score for the basic set.

We measure the amount of closed NCs in a given closed compounding language (ccl) and for a given
set of NCs (Set) by using the frequency of closed NCs relative to the number of all word sequences
(NSet,cll) (word sequences removed in Section 3.3 are excluded). Since the alignment to single words is
still somewhat noisy (i.e., our compound splitter does not work error-free and there are still deficiencies
in the word alignment), we select a set of 50 closed noun compound samples and rate the accuracy. The
final amount of closed NCs is the product of relative frequency and accuracy, as given in (4).

closed compound (4) 143,121 98.0% 63.6% 77.2% 10.4%

Table 2: Extraction quality of the basic set after restrictor application

Table 2 shows the results when applying the four different degrees of the closed compound restrictor
to the basic set. The first result is that using only a PoS-based method leads to a very poor extraction
accuracy (38%). For the applications of the closed compound restrictors, the result is that increasing
degclosed means increasing precision but decreasing recall in NC extraction. The reason for this is that an
aligned closed NC is generally a sufficient condition for an English NC (except for controversial cases
such as strong wind) but not a necessary condition (i.e., a true English NC may be aligned to only pe-
riphrastic constructions). The highest F-Score (82.1%) is achieved using CCR(2). We can conclude that
the closed compound restrictor is a reliable method for extracting English NCs. In future work, we will
use a large set of human annotators with different backgrounds in order to get a widely distributed sense
of compoundhood. Moreover, instead of a binary rating, we will consider compoundhood as a continuum
and compare rating scores with the amount of aligned closed compounding languages realising a closed
compound in a larger parallel corpus.

The last column in Table 2 shows the amount of closed English NCs in each respective set. Since
degclosed correlates with the amount of closed English NCs, we can conclude that, despite the cross-
lingual differences in spelling conventions attested in linguistic literature, there is a bias for a universal
consensus in closed compounding.

Language pccl
German 71.2%
Danish 63.3%
Swedish 62.2%
Dutch 58.7%

Table 3: The amounts of closed noun compounds

Table 3 shows the amounts of closed noun compounds in the closed compounding languages Danish,
Dutch, German and Swedish, extracted from the closed compound (1) set. Our result shows that German
is the most productive language in closed compounding (71.2%), while the other languages have a similar
productivity (58-63%).

The result of our extraction method is a database of English NCs and their translations in up to 9
European languages. As described in the introduction, this database will serve several purposes. One is to
study cross-lingual variation. Table 4 shows some examples of multilingual noun compound extractions
from closed compound (2).

Table 4: Examples of multilingual noun compounds

The examples show that English noun compounds have various realisations in European languages.
Although French and Italian are open compounding languages, we do find closed compounding (e.g.,
autoroutes). Compounds such as timetable can also be aligned to single nouns such as calendrier (cal-
endar). We found three common word formation types in Romance languages for bipartite noun com-
pounds: (1) two nouns and a preposition in between, (2) one noun and a post-nominal adjective and (3)
a single (possibly compounding) noun. Although Romance languages usually agree with respect to the
word formation type, they may disagree as is the case for French and Italian for the example concern-
ing trading system. One interesting observation is that while the head of highways (ways) is translated
fairly literally, the modifier (high) is replaced by alternative aspects. On highways, cars (Autobahnen
(car-ways)) usually drive fast (snelwegen (fast-ways)). In future work, we will use this database for re-
searching the nature of compoundhood in a cross-lingual perspective. The resource is publicly available
for future research6.

5 Bracketing three-noun compounds

In this section, we show a case study of how our extracted database can be used to predict the structure
of NPs, more specifically to bracket tripartite noun compounds (3NCs), i.e., a composition of three bare
nouns that function as one unit. Given a 3NC, we can either have RIGHT bracketing, as in baby [bicycle
seat], or LEFT bracketing, as in [human rights] abuses.

5.1 The cross-lingual bracketing method

We first start with six phrase patterns that correspond to foreign phrases that are aligned to an English
3NC, as shown in Table 5, where SN refers to a single (non-compounding) noun, FC refers to a func-
tional context (i.e., a sequence of functional words), ADJ refers to an adjective and CNC refers to a
closed (bipartite) NC (based on the splitter described in Section 3.1). Each phrase pattern contains a
complex unit that is separated from the rest, e.g., a closed NC or a combination of adjective and single
noun. For each pattern, we know what is the head and what is the modifier: the first phrase pattern
contains only one nominal component, that can be identified as head. For the other patterns, the order
is: head, FC, modifier. Based on the assumption that the aligned head corresponds to the English head,
we can infer the English bracketing from the complexity of the aligned head. If the aligned head is the
complex unit, the English bracketing label is RIGHT, otherwise LEFT. The third column in Table 5 shows
the inferred labels for the English 3NC based on the foreign phrase pattern. For an English 3NC, we
check all aligned languages for a matching phrase pattern and collect, in the case of a match, the inferred
label. The majority label determines the final bracketing label.

The examples below illustrate instances for each phrase pattern, where the indices correspond to those
in Table 5.

We observed that the initial assumption (saying that the aligned head corresponds to the English head)
is not always true. Sometimes the English head and modifier are swapped in aligned languages, as
illustrated in example (7).

(7) nl: stabiele

”exchange rate stability”

To solve this problem, we inspect the word alignment from the phrase pattern of language lj to the
English nouns N1, N2 and N3 in a 3NC. If the complex unit is aligned to {N2, N3} or to {N1, N3}, lj
provides the label RIGHT. If the complex unit is aligned to {N1, N2}, lj votes for LEFT. If the complex
unit is aligned to all three nouns, this is an indicator for a word alignment error. In this case, lj will not
perform any prediction. In all other cases, the inferred label from the phrase pattern is used.

5.2 Evaluation for cross-lingual bracketing

As there are only two possible structures for 3NCs, namely LEFT or RIGHT branching, we regard this
task as a binary classification and score the accuracy of class agreement. As basis, we use the basic set
created in Section 3, because alignments to closed compounds are not of interest for the bracketing task.
Two trained human annotators (of which one is one of the authors) individually bracket a sample of 100
randomly selected 3NCs in context. Contextual cues can help the annotator to disambiguate the structure
of the English NC, so the accompanying sentences are shown to the annotator. The annotators are no
domain experts and since terms in Europarl can be quite domain specific, they are allowed to look up the
meaning of the constituents in a dictionary or check Google. Annotators are asked to label 3NCs as LEFT
or RIGHT, or UNDECIDED if they are unclear. Furthermore, the annotators are asked to mark extraction
errors. When inspecting the inter-annotator agreement for the bracketing classes (LEFT/RIGHT; i.e., 76
of 100 samples), we achieved an agreement rate of 89% and κ = 0.693 (Cohen, 1960), which means
substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). Afterwards, the annotators discuss disagreements and
revise their annotations. This has led to a perfect agreement in our setting. The 8 UNDECIDED labellings
show that in some cases the bracketing remains ambiguous even in context. In future work, we would like
to investigate if larger contexts or domain knowledge is necessary for the disambiguation process or if
the NCs are inherently flat (i.e., if LEFT or RIGHT bracketing does not make any difference in meaning).
We evaluate our cross-lingual bracketing system for (1) inferred label of a phrase pattern and (2) word

alignment information for phrase pattern with inferred label as back-off. We compare the bracketing
performance against the LEFT class baseline.

5.3 Results
Method Accuracy
LEFT baseline 71.1 %
Inferred phrase pattern labels 89.0† %
Word alignment for phrase patterns 91.6† %

Table 6: Bracketing performance; † indicates significantly higher than the LEFT baseline
Table 6 shows the results of our system compared to the LEFT class baseline. The first result is that both

inferred label and word alignment information for phrase pattern outperform the LEFT class baseline
significantly7. Bracketing with word alignment information for phrase pattern outperforms bracketing
based on the inferred labels.

6 Related Work

Our methods for extracting and structuring English NCs rely on the spelling of various aligned languages.
Previous work on multilingual extraction include Morin and Daille (2010) and Weller and Heid (2012).
These type-based approaches focus on bilingual terminology extraction using comparable corpora. Our
token-based extraction method includes 10 languages and we extract both the NCs and their context.
While the aforementioned work serves as resource for improving machine translation (MT) systems, we
focus on NC research and how multilingual evidence can help analysing and interpreting English NCs.

This multilingual perspective on a considerable number of languages has been adopted as well by
Macherey et al., (2011), who present a multilingual language-independent approach to compound split-
ting. Moreover, they learned morphological operations on compounding automatically. Here, Macherey
et al., (2011) extract training instances using a method related to Garera and Yarowsky (2008): select a
single word f in a language l translated to several English words ei . If there is a translation for each ei
to a word gi that shows a (partial) substring match with f , (f ; e1, . . . , en; g1, . . . , gn) is extracted. While
Macherey et al., (2011) extract training instances type-based in a bilingual setting, we directly extract
NC instances with a set of four closed compounding languages. This token-based perspective has the
advantage that we can process English NCs for which there is no literal translation to the target language
(e.g., health insurance aligned to Krankenversicherung (lit. invalid insurance)).

In cross-lingual annotation transfer (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Padó, 2007; Van der Plas et al., 2011)
human annotations are transferred from one language to the other in parallel data. In this paper, we use
the structural differences between languages as found in parallel corpora to generate annotations on the
target language and do not rely on annotations on the source language.

Bracketing methods for both three-noun compounds and complete base NPs have been designed both
supervised and unsupervised. Vadas and Curran (2007) used a supervised bracketing method on man-
ually annotated data. Pitler et al. (2010) used the data from Vadas and Curran (2007) for a parser
applicable on base NPs of any length including coordinations. Their supervised classifier exploited web-
scale N-grams. Although supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods by far, the need for
annotated data is a drawback of supervised approaches. Bergsma et al. (2011) used crosslingual data as
additional supervision to make the need for manual annotations less pressing. Unsupervised methods use
N-gram statistics (Marcus, 1980; Lauer, 1995; Nakov and Hearst, 2005) or semantic information (Kim
and Baldwin, 2013).

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we discussed the complexity related to the definition of compoundhood and presented
an iterative method that tries to refine existing definitions by tentatively demonstrating the efficacy of

linguistic criteria on corpus data. The initial implementation of two linguistic criteria, based on cross-
lingual spelling conventions and the inseparability of a compound’s components, achieved an F-Score of
82.1% on the task of extracting English compounds.

The extracted multilingual database of compounds in contexts serves multiple purposes. For example,
it can be used to study cross-lingual variations in compounding. We showed in an additional experiment
how the cross-lingual evidence found in the multilingual database can be used to bracket English three-
noun compounds using cross-lingual spelling variation with a set of six phrase patterns. We achieved a
bracketing accuracy of 91.6% that is very close to human performance.

In future work, we plan to continue refining the definition of compoundhood in a cross-lingual setting.
We will experiment with additional linguistic criteria defined over multiple languages. This way, we hope
to improve the quality of the multilingual database that we will further explore for compound analysis
and translation.
