Abstract

In this paper, I present a lexical representation 
of the light  verb  ha  'do'  used in two types of 
Korean light verb constructions (LVCs). These 
two types of the constructions have the typical 
theoretical  and  implementation  problems  as 
multiword  expressions (MWEs):  lexical 
proliferation of the possible light verb senses in 
the  lexicon,  potential  overgeneration  of  ill-
formed  LVCs,  and  the  semantic 
compositionality issue. Adopting and adapting 
the idea of qualia structure (Pustejovsky, 1991) 
into  a  typed-feature  structure  grammar 
(Copestake, 1993; Copestake, 2002; Sag et al., 
2003),  I  suggest  that  some  Korean  common 
nouns  have  their  associated  predicate 
information  in  their  lexical  entries  (e.g.,  the 
predicate  meaning  cook is  included  in  the 
lexical  entry of  the common noun  pap 'rice'). 
Thus  such  common  nouns  provide  an 
appropriate predicate meaning to the light verb. 
The  lexical  constraints  on  the  light  verb  and 
common nouns,  and  relevant  phrase  structure 
rules  allow me  to  capture  the  generalizations 
and  idiosyncrasies  regarding  LVCs  in  a 
systematic way.   

1 Two Types of LVCs

A particular type of Korean LVCs, exemplified in 
(1),  has  been  much  studied  (Chae,  1996,  2002; 
Choi and Wechsler, 2001; Kim et al., 2004; Kim et 
al., 2007, inter alia, and similar Japanese examples 
in  Miyagawa,  1989;  Matsumoto,  1996;  Yokota, 
2005, among others): 

(1)a. ku-ka     [swuhak-ul  kongpwu-lul] 
         he-Nom  math-Acc   study-Acc       
         ha-yess-ta.1

1 Abbreviations: Nom = Nominative, Acc = Accusative, Pst = 
Past,  Dec  =  Declarative,  Pass  =  Passive,  Que  =  Question, 
Comp  =  Complementizer,  Top  =  Topicalization,  Rel  = 
Relative marker 

               do-Pst-Dec
         'He studied mathematics.'    
     b. ku-ka     [Mary-wa    tayhwa-lul] ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom  Mary-with  talk-Acc       do-Pst-Dec 
         'He talked with Mary.'

In  (1a),  the  light  verb  ha-yess-ta 'do-Pst-Dec' 
requires as its complement the verbal noun (VN) 
phrase, swuhak-ul  kongpwu-lul 'math-Acc  study-
Acc', and thus the types of LVCs in (1) are called 
VN-LVC in this paper, but see different syntactic 
analyses in Choi and Wechsler, 2001; Kim et al., 
2004.  Although  the  light  verbs  are  the  syntactic 
heads of the VN-LVCs, the core  meanings of the 
sentences come from the verbal nouns. The mixed 
properties of VN in VN-LVC (that is,  a VN can 
assign  verbal  cases  to  its  arguments,  but  at  the 
same time it can be modified by an adjective) have 
attracted much research on VN-LVCs (Grimshaw 
and  Mester,  1988  on  Japanese;  Cho  and  Sells, 
1991; Manning, 1993; Choi and Wechsler,  2001; 
Kim et al., 2007, among others). 

However,  there  are  many  other  usages  of  the 
Korean light verb ha 'do', which are almost ignored 
in the literature. In this paper, I investigate the two 
frequently-used,  but  less-studied types  of  Korean 
LVCs. 

In  the  first  type  of  the  LVCs,  the  light  verb 
requires a phrase headed by a common noun (CN) 
as its object (so, it is named CN-LVC here): 

(2)a. ku-ka      pap-ul     ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom  rice-Acc  do-Pst-Dec
         'He cooked/*ate the rice (result product).'
     b. ku-ka      khephi-lul/*mwul-ul   ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom  coffee-Acc/water-Acc  do-Pst-Dec
         'He brewed /drank the coffee/*water.'

In (2),  we can see that  the  meaning of  the light 
verb is  determined by the object as with the VN-
LVCs in (1).2 Almost every VN seems possible to 
2 Similar examples in English (Pustejovsky, 1991):

40



appear as the object in a VN-LVC. However, not 
every common noun can be the object  of  a CN-
LVC.  

The questions that naturally arise are 1) how to 
represent  the light  verbs  of the  CN-LVCs in the 
lexicon,  and  2)  how  to  formally  and  efficiently 
describe  the  way  the  predicate  meanings  (e.g., 
brew and drink) are derived from the objects (e.g., 
khephi-lul 'coffee-Acc'). 

If we treat CN-LVCs as words-with-spaces, then 
they  suffer  from  a  lexical  proliferation  in 
describing all possible meanings of the light verb 
expressions  (e.g.,  do_drink_coffee, 
do_brew_coffee,  do_drink_tea,  do_brew_tea, etc.) 
(see Sag  et al.,  2002). On the other hand, a fully 
compositional  analysis  would  overgenerate  (e.g 
licensing  *mwul-ul  ha-yess-ta 'water-Acc  do-Pst-
Dec' in (2b)) and would not be able to explain the 
problem of the semantic compositionality (that is, 
exactly where and how does the predicate meaning 
of the light verb phrase in a CN-LVC come from?) 
(see Sag et al., 2002). These problems of the CN-
LVCs are not properly treated yet.

English LVCs have almost the same problems as 
the  Korean  CN-LVCs:  idiosyncrasies  on  which 
light  verb combines  with a  given noun (Abeille, 
1988) (e.g., make a mistake, give a demo). A fully 
compositional  account,  on the other hand,  would 
be  unable  to  block  alternative  light  verb 
combinations  (e.g.,  *give  a  mistake,  *make  a  
demo) (see Sag et al., 2002).

Moreover,  in  Korean  serial  verb constructions  
(SVCs) the situation gets more complicated:

(3)a. ku-ka      pap-ul     hay  mek-ess-ta.
         he-Nom  rice-Acc  do    eat-Pst-Dec
         'He cooked the rice and ate it.'
     b. ku-ka      khephi-lul*mwul-ul/    hay 
         he-Nom  coffee-Acc/ water-Acc  do    
         masi-ess-ta.
         drink-Pst-Dec
         'He brewed/*drank  the coffee and drank it.'

   i) Mary finished the cigarette.
   ii) Mary finished her beer. 

                   iii) John finished the book.  

The exact meaning of the verb is determined by the object:  
finish smoking for i),  finish drinking for ii) and finish writing 
for  iii).  The  verb,  however,  has  also  its  own  meaning: 
finishing X.  So,  in  this  case,  the  verb  seems  to  be  an 
intermediate type between light and heavy verbs. 

In  (3),  the  specific  meanings  of  the  light  verbs 
depend  on  the  common  noun  objects,  which  is 
parallel  with  the  CN-LVCs.  The  difference, 
however,  is  that  there  is  more  restriction  on  the 
appropriate choice from the associated predicate(s) 
for  the  determination  of  the  light  verb  meaning: 
e.g., only brew (creation sense) is allowed in (3b). 
I  return to  this semantic  restriction in  Section 3. 
The type of the constructions in (3) is called serial  
verb-light  verb  construction  (SV-LVC)  in  this 
paper. 

SV-LVCs have the same problems as CN-LVCs, 
including  lexical  proliferation of  every  possible 
senses of the serial light verb expressions with the 
words-with-spaces  approach,  the  potential 
overgeneration,  and  the  question  of  semantic 
compositionality. 

These issues of the Korean LVCs as MWEs are 
crucial  problems  in  natural  language  processing 
(NLP) like the disambiguation problems (see Sag 
et al., 2002). The goal of this paper is to solve the 
problems  and  to  present  an  efficient  formal 
account for CN- and SV-LVCs that is suitable for 
applications to linguistically precise NLP. 

2 Grammatical Properties of CN-LVCs

CN-LVCs are very  productive: the light verb  ha- 
'do' can combine with many (but not all) different 
common nouns to constitute CN-LVCs. The basic 
semantic and syntactic properties of CN-LVCs are 
discussed below.   

2.1 Semantic Constraints of CN-LVCs
As is already illustrated in (2), there are two kinds 
of idiosyncratic restrictions on CN-LVCs. The first 
one is about what common noun can appear as the 
object in a CN-LVC: 

(4)a. ku-ka      pap-ul/*khwukhi-lul   ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom  rice-Acc/*cookie-Acc  do-Pst-Dec
         'He cooked the rice/(int.) baked the cookie.'
     b. ku-ka      khemphwuthe-lul/*kaysanki-lul 
         he-Nom  computer-Acc/*calculator-Acc
         ha-yess-ta.
         do-Pst-Dec 
         'He used the computer/*calculator.'

The examples  in (4) show that  only certain food 
products or machines can occur as the objects in 
the CN-LVCs. The loan word khwukhi-lul 'cookie-

41



Acc' in (4a) is not allowed, but other loan words, 
such  as  khephi-lul 'coffee-Acc'  in  (2b)  and 
khemphwuthe-lul  'computer-Acc' in (4b), are fine. 
There  seems  to  be  no  natural  semantic  class  of 
common  nouns  that  can  appear  in  CN-LVCs, 
which  leads  me  to  attribute  the  idiosyncratic 
property to the individual common nouns. 

The second idiosyncratic property is about what 
predicate  is  associated with what  common  noun. 
For instance, in (4a)  the CN-LVC has only one 
reading,  'He  cooked the  rice',  not  other 
interpretations like 'He ate the rice,' although 'cook' 
and 'eat'  are (at least  semantically and maybe also 
statistically) plausible candidates for the associated 
predicates of the common noun  pap 'rice'. Lapata 
(2001) uses a large corpus to acquire the meanings 
of  polysemous  adjectives  (e.g.,  fast).  However, 
such  corpus  findings  only  tell  us  the  possible 
interpretations, but not impossible interpretations.

It seems intuitive that common nouns have such 
information  about  their  related  predicates  since 
without  a  specific  predicate  given,  we  can 
normally guess what predicate might come after a 
common noun object in an incomplete sentence (at 
least  in  Korean  whose  word  order  is  SOV)  (see 
similar  combinatoric information  related  with 
Korean VN of VN-LVCs in  Cho and Sells, 1991 
and Japanese VN in Manning, 1993). 

In short,  only some common nouns have such 
information  about  certain  related  predicates. 
Pustejovsky (1991) refers to this kind of relation as 
cospecification:  i.e.  like  verb  can  select  for  its 
argument  type,  an  argument  also  can  select  its 
associated  predicates.  The  associated  predicate 
information is included in the qualia structure of  a 
lexical item (Pustejovsky, 1991). Among the four 
basic  roles  in  qualia  structure,  the  telic  role  has 
values  about  purpose  and function  of  the  object 
(e.g.,  read for  novel),  and  the  agentive  role  has 
values  on  factors  involved  in  the  origin  or 
“bringing  about”  of  an  object  (e.g.,  write for 
novel). 

Building on the qualia structure,  I  propose that 
Korean  common  nouns  have  dual  semantic 
components, the first  of which is the meaning of 
the common noun itself, and second of which is the 
qualia  structure.  Details  of  the  semantic  feature 
structures of such common nouns are introduced in 
Section 5.  

2.2 Syntactic Constraints of CN-LVCs
The CN-LVCs allow internal adverb modification:

(5)a. ku-ka      pap-ul      ppalli    ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom  rice-Acc  quickly  do-Pst-Dec
         'He quickly cooked the rice.'
     b. ku-ka     khemphwuthe-lul ppalli  ha-yess-ta.
         he-Nom computer-Acc     quickly do-Pst-Dec
         'He quickly used the computer.'

So, the CN-LVCs are like Syntactically-Flexible 
Expressions (see Sag et al., 2002). I treat the CN-
LVCs  as  a  normal  transitive  verb  phrase 
construction  (generated  by  the  general  head-
complement phrase rule) in syntax.

Since  the  light  verb  ha 'do'  is  syntactically  a 
transitive verb, the passive counterparts of the CN-
LVCs  are  predicted  to  be  generated.  However, 
only (4a) allows its passive:

(6)a. ku-eyuyhay  pap-i        toy-ess-ta.
         he-by           rice-Nom  do.Pass-Pst-Dec
         'The rice (product, not raw material) was 
         cooked by him.'       
     b. *ku-eyuyhay  khemphwuthe-ka  
           he-by            computer-Nom 
           toy-ess-ta.
           do.Pass-Pst-Dec

The passive light verb toy has the become meaning 
(i.e.  creation  sense).  The  associated  predicate  of 
pap 'rice' is cook (an agentive role predicate). Thus 
in (6a) toy is compatible with be cooked, which is 
also  a  “bringing  about”  predicate,  but  in  the 
passive form. However, khemphuthe 'computer' has 
as  its  associated  predicate  use  (a  telic  role 
predicate)  and its passive form  be used is also a 
telic role predicate. So, the creation meaning of toy  
is  not  compatble  with the  common noun subject 
khemphwuthe-ka 'computer-Nom' in (6b). 

In  sum,  CN-LVCs  are  basically  transitive 
phrases, but they are constrained by the semantic 
relations  between  common  nouns  and  the  light 
verb.  

3 Grammatical Properties of SV-LVCs

As CN-LVCs are highly productive, SV-LVCs are 
accordingly very productive. The two types of the 
LVCs  have  similar  semantic  and  syntactic 
constraints. But SV-LVCs are more restricted.  

42



3.1 Semantic Constraints of SV-LVCs
As noted in (3), there are lexical constraints on the 
meanings of SV-LVCs. Consider (7): 

(7)a. ku-ka     pap-ul     hay   ponay-ess-ta.
        he-Nom  rice-Acc  do     send-Pst-Dec
        (lit.) 'He cooked the rice and sent it (to me).'   
    b. ku-ka      khephi-lul  hay  ponay-ess-ta.
        he-Nom  coffee-Acc  do    send-Pst-Dec
        (lit.) 'He brew the coffee and sent it (to me).'
               
Since  the  common  noun  pap 'rice'  has  only one 
associated predicate,  cook  as shown in (2a),  (7a) 
has only one reading. Although khephi 'coffee' has 
two  associated  predicates,  drink  and  brew as 
evidenced  in  (2b), (7b)  also  has  only  one 
interpretation  with  brewed  (the  reading  that  he 
drank  the  coffee  and  sent  it  somewhere  is 
implausible).  Here,  two  hypotheses  on  the 
interpretations  are  possible:  1)  any  associated 
predicate that is plausible and available is chosen 
for the V1 light verb meaning, or 2) the V1 light 
verb  meaning  must  be  a  creation  (that  is,  an 
agentive role predicate). 

The second hypothesis predicts that if a common 
noun has only a telic role predicate whose meaning 
is plausible in an SV-LVC, then the SV-LVC must 
be ill-formed. This is confirmed below: 

(8) *ku-ka      khemphwuthe-lul  hay 
        he-Nom  computer-Acc         do  
        ponay-ess-ta.    
        send-Pst-Dec

The common noun khemphuthe 'computer' has the 
associated predicate  use. The meaning of the telic 
role is plausible before the sending relation. So, the 
ungrammaticality of (8) rejects the first hypothesis.

Thus I suggest that certain common nouns have 
certain associated predicates information, and then 
in an SV-LVC, an available predicate of  bringing 
about meaning must be chosen as the meaning of 
the V1 light verb hay in the construction. If such a 
predicate is not available, then the SV-LVC is ill-
formed.  Also,  I  have  already illustrated  that  the 
agentive  role  predicate  of  a  common  noun  is 
required  for  the  generation  of  the  passive  CN-
LVCs  like  (6a).  Then  how  about  passive  SV-
LVCs?  I  discuss  this  question  in  the  following 
section. 

3.2 Syntactic Constraints of SV-LVCs
First,  adverbs can modify the serial  verbs  in the 
SV-LVCs: 

(9)a. ku-ka      pap-ul      ppalli    hay  mek-ess-ta.
         he-Nom  rice-Acc  quickly  do    eat-Pst-Dec
         'He quickly cooked the rice and ate it.'
     b. ku-ka     khephi-lul  ppalli    hay
         he-Nom coffee-Acc quickly  do  
         masi-ess-ta.
         drink-Pst-Dec
         'He quickly brew the coffee and drank it.'

SV-LVCs  are  also  categorized  into 
Syntactically-Flexible  Expressions.  However, 
unlike CN-LVCs, the serial verbs (e.g.,  hay mek-
ess-ta 'do eat-Pst-Dec') are complex predicates that 
need a special phrase (like (23) in Section 5).

As  predicted,  a  common  noun  must  have  an 
agentive  role  predicate  to  license  a  well-formed 
passive SV-LVC. In other words, only if an SV-
LVC is allowed, its passive SV-LVC is licensed: 

 
(10)a. pap-i/khephi-ka             toy-e               
           rice-Nom/coffee-Nom  do.Pass-Comp  
           ponay-e       ci-ess-ta.
           send-Comp  Pass-Pst-Dec 
           (lit.) 'The rice was cooked and sent (to me).'
           (lit.) 'The coffee was brewed and sent 
                   (to me).'
      b. *khemphwuthe-ka  toy-e  
            computer-Nom     do.Pass-Comp 
            ponay-e       ci-ess-ta.    
            send-Comp  Pass-Pst-Dec 
 
Just like the passive CN-LVCs, the exact meaning 
of toy depends on the common noun subject. 

So,  SV-LVCs are complex predicate structures 
in  syntax,  but  they  are  also  constrained  by  the 
semantics of common nouns and the light verb. 

4 Pragmatic Factors

If a rich context is given, some ill-formed LVCs 
can be saved:

(11)a. ku-ka     *chayk-ul   ha-yess-ta.
           he-Nom   book-Acc  do-Pst-Dec
       b. ku-ka      sayngil    senmwul-lo  chayk-ul  
           he-Nom  birthday  present-as     book-Acc
           ha-yess-ta.

43



           do-Pst-Dec 
           'he gave a book as a birthday present.'

The telic role of senmwul 'present' is give and this 
telic role seems to be passed to the object chayk-ul  
'book-Acc' in (11b). 

The grammaticality depends on what sense of a 
word is used in the sentence:  

(12)a. *ku-ka       haksayng-ul  ha-yess-ta.
             he-Nom  student-Acc    do-Pst-Decl
       b. nwu-ka      haksayng  ha-lay?
           who-Nom  student      do-Que?
           'Who told you to be a student?'
           (from the Korean TV show, Hot Brothers)

The ill-formed CN-LVC in (12a) can be saved in a 
special context where haksayng-ul 'student-Acc' is 
interpreted as a student role of a play (then the telic 
role  play for  the  light  verb),  or  in  a  colloquial 
context  like  (12b).  Being  a  student  (or  lawyer, 
teacher,  doctor,  etc.)  means  that  the  person 
performs (telic role) the tasks of the position. 

The object of the light verb can be implicit: 

(13) ce     ken    twu-ko      kan-ta.    ne   hay. 
        that  thing  leave-and  go-Dec.  you  do. 
        'Let me leave that thing for you. You have it.'
        (from the Korean movie, Hello Ghost)

The common noun object ce ken 'that thing' of the 
light verb is dropped from the second sentence of 
(13). The associated predicate of the common noun 
object  is  linked  to  the  light  verb  across  the 
sentence  boundary.  The  abandonment  of  the 
possession of that thing seems to enforce the light 
verb to have the meaning of  have. Such verbs as 
write,  cook,  build are  related  with  physical 
creations, but  buy,  have,  possess are related with 
relational creations. 

Leaving  the  detailed  formal  analysis  of  the 
pragmatic factors for future research, I focus on the 
representations  of  the  semantic  and  syntactic 
constraints.

5 Typed-feature Structure Grammar  

In this section, I present the formal analyses of the 
CN-  and  SV-LVCs  in  a  typed-feature  structure 
system (Copestake, 2002) based on the framework 
of  the  Head-driven  Phrase  Structure  Grammar 

(Pollard and Sag, 1994; Sag et al., 2003).

5.1 Type Hierarchy of Korean 
First,  I  adopt the following type hierarchy of the 
KPSG (Korean Phrase Structure Grammar) (Kim, 
2004; Kim et al., 2004):  

(14) Type hierarchy of linguistic expressions3: 
                                 sign 

                 lex-st                                             syn-st
                                            
 verbal  nominal  adverbial  adnominal  lex-ex   ph

 v-stem          n-stem    
   
 nonstative-v   vn                        cn

               kongpwu 'study'   pap 'rice'    
               tayhwa 'talk'        khephi 'coffee' 
                                           khemphuthe  'computer'
                                           mwul  'water'

The  type  vn has  the  mixed  properties  inherited 
from  its  supertypes,  verbal and  n-stem  (see 
Malouf,  1998,  2000;  Choi  and Wechsler,  2001). 
The type  cn also inherits  its  constraints  from its 
supertypes:  for instance, nominal  properties from 
the type n-stem (see Kim et al., 2004). 

Briscoe  et  al.  (1990)  and  Copestake  (1993) 
illustrate  some  lexical  entries  with  the  qualia 
structure following Pustejovsky and Aniek (1988), 
Pustejovsky  (1989,  1991).  For  example, 
autobiography  has its associated predicates,  write 
(the value of the agentive role) and read (the value 
of  the  telic  role).  They  are  represented  in  the 
lexical entry of autobiography. 

I declare that Korean common nouns have both 
the RESTR(ICTION) for normal semantics and the 
QUALIA-ST(RUCTURE),  which in  turn  has  the 
AGENTIVE  and  TELIC  attributes,  adopting  the 
basic idea from Pustejovsky (1991) and adapting 
the  feature  structure  from  Copestake  (1993). 
Moreover,  I  posit  the  QUALIA  attribute  whose 
value is the sum of the values of the AGENTIVE 
and  TELIC.  Based  on  this  feature  structure,  I 
propose  the  following  representations  of  the 
Korean common nouns: 

  

3 The dashed line here means that there are intermediate types  
between the types that are connected with it.

(15)a. Lexical entry for pap 'rice'

      b. Lexical entry for khephi 'coffee'

       c. Lexical entry for khemphuthe  'computer'

      d. Lexical entry for mwul  'water'

In (15a), pap 'rice' has its associated predicate cook 
as the value of the AGENTIVE, but it has no value 
for the TELIC. Then, the QUALIA list must have 
only one value cook.  In (15b), khephi 'coffee' has 
brew  and  drink in  the  AGENTIVE  and  TELIC, 
respectively. Then its QUALIA list includes  brew 
as its first value, and drink as its second value. In 
(15c),  the  associated  predicate  of  khemphuthe 
'computer'  is  use (a telic role),  which is then the 
sole value for the QUALIA. In (15d), mwul 'water' 
is  declared  not  to  have  any  value  for  the 
AGENTIVE or TELIC. Thus, it  does not have a 
value for the QUALIA, either. 

Now as  for  the  relevant  verbs  of  the  LVCs,  I 
divide the type  tr(ansitive)-v(erb) in the following 
type hierarchy further into  tr(ansitive)-light-v(erb) 
and tr(ansitive)-nonlight-v(erb): 

(16) Type hierarchy of non-stative verbs: 

                   nonstative-v   

  intr-v                 tr-v                           ditr-v
 
              tr-light-v      tr-nonlight-v    ponay- 'send'
                                                     
               ha-1 'do'        mek- 'eat'      
               ha-2 'do'        masi- 'drink'    
               hay 'do.Comp'            
 
Three lexical entries of the light verbs are under 
the type  tr-light-v.  They have different properties 
that can be captured by the following constraints: 
                                        
(17)a. Constraints on the type, nonstative-v:

      b. Constraints on the type, tr-light-v:

      c. Constraints on ha-1: 

      d. Constraints on ha-2: 

      e. Constraints on hay:  

In (17a), the defeasible feature [LITE /–] is posited 
on  nonstative-v.  So,  all  the  subtypes  inherit 
[LITE /–], except for  tr-light-v  since in (17b), the 
defeasible feature [LITE /–] is  overridden by the 
specification of the feature value. Only two types 
tr-nonlight-v  and  ditr-v  can appear as V2 in SV-
LVCs, and now they can be referred to as verbs 
that  take  at  least  one  complement  and  have  the 
feature [LITE /–].  In (17c), the RESTR of  ha-1 is 
claimed to be empty list since the light verb that 
combines with a verbal noun phrase does not seem 
to contribute a core meaning to the VP as shown in 
(1).  However,  in  (17d),  the  meaning  of  ha-2 is 
linked to a value of the QUALIA of the common 
noun object. This constraint of ha-2 will guarantee 
that in CN-LVCs, any value in the QUALIA (e.g.,

drink or  brew of  coffee)  can  be  chosen  for  the 
specific meaning of the light verb. Another effect 
of the constraint is  preventing the common nouns 
like  mwul 'water'  from appearing  in  a  CN-LVC 
since such common nouns are declared to not have 
a value for the QUALIA as in (15d).  Finally,  in 
(17e), a separate lexical entry for the V1 light verb 
hay is posited due to the different properties from 
ha-2: e.g., ha-2 can get a tense, so is finite but hay 
cannot receive a tense, so is nonfinite. In addition, 
the meaning of the V1 light verb  hay  is identical 
only with the Agentive value of the common noun 
object.  

5.2 Head-Complement Combinations 
Along with the lexical entries, syntactic rules are 
needed. In the type hierarchy of (14), the relevant 
subtypes of syn-st are represented below (cf. Kim, 
2004; Kim et al., 2004; Kim, 2010). I added the 
new type hd-sv-lv-ex as a subtype of hd-lex-ex:

(18)          syn-st

  lex-ex                        ph

                 hd-comp-ph      hd-subj-ph    hd-mod-ph

       hd-lex-ex   

       hd-sv-lv-ex

The  following  general  head-complement  rule 
(see Sag et al., 2003; Kim 2004) generates a phrase 
of the type hd-comp-ph:

(19) Head-Complement Rule: 

In  addition  to  the  syntactic  head-complement 
phrase rule, the following semantic constraints on 
the structures are defined (Sag et al., 2003): 

(20)Semantic Compositionality Principle: 
In  any  well-formed  phrase  structure,  the 
mother's  RESTR  value  is  the  sum  of  the 
RESTR values of the daughters. 

Equipped with the Head-Complement Rule and 
the  Semantic  Compositionality  Principle,  VPs  in 
CN- and VN-LVCs can be generated:

(21)a. Head-Complement Phrase of CN-LVC:

       b. Head-Complement Phrase of VN-LVC:

In  (21),  according  to  the  Semantic 
Compositionality Principle, the VP in the CN- or 
VN-LVC has the sum of the RESTR values of the 
object and the light verb. 

In the type hierarchy (18), the type  hd-comp-ph 
has  the  subtype  which  is  constrained  by  the 
following Head-Lex Rule (cf. Kim et al., 2004):

(22) Head-Lex Rule: 

In (22),  the  head  element  combines  with  its 
complement,  whose  complements  and  some  of 
head's complements are passed up to the resulting 
hd-lex-ex. 

The constraints on  hd-lex-ex are inherited to its 
subtype  hd-sv-lv-ex.  This  phrase  type  is 
responsible for the combinations of the serial light 
verb expressions in SV-LVCs:

(23) Head-SV-LV-EX Rule:  

In  (23),  the  nonstative  verbs  with  [LITE  /–] 
(which are not intransitive) like eat, drink and send 
require the V1 light verb hay as its complement.  

Now, the serial light verb expressions (e.g.,  hay 
mek-ess-ta 'do.Pass  eat-Pst-Dec')  can  be  licensed 
with the Head-SV-LV-EX Rule and the Semantic 
Compositionality Principle. Furthermore, (23) can 
rule out  the ill-formed SV-LVCs like (8) *ku-ka 
khemphwuthe-lul  [hay  ponay-ess-ta] 'he-Nom

computer-Acc do send-Pst-Dec' because  hd-sv-lv-
ex requires  a  common  noun  object  that  has  an 
AGENTIVE  value,  but  khemphwuthe 'computer' 
has no value for it.  The implausible interpretation 
'#He drank the coffee and sent it (to me)' for (7b) 
[ku-ka  khephi-lul  [hay  ponay-ess-ta]] is  also 
blocked since the meaning of the light verb hay is 
linked only to the AGENTIVE value of the object. 

The  following  feature  structures  show  the 
analyses  of  the  VP [pap-ul  ha-yess-ta] 'rice-Acc 
do-Pst-Dec' in the CN-LVC (2a) and the VP [pap-
ul  [hay  mek-ess-ta]] 'rice-Acc  do  eat-Pst-Dec'  in 
the SV-LVC (3a): 

(24) [pap-ul ha-yess-ta]: 

(25) [pap-ul [hay mek-ess-ta]]:  

6 Conclusion and Future Work 

The light verb ha-2 'do' is used for CN-LVCs and 
hay is  used  for  SV-LVCs.  I  also  proposed  that 
certain  Korean  common  nouns  have  their 
associated predicate meanings in the QUALIA-ST. 
These  lexical  constrains  on  individual  common 
nouns and the light verbs, and the relevant phrase 
structure  rules  account  for  the  regular  and 
idiosyncratic  properties  of  the  two  LVC 
constructions in a systematic manner.

I believe that  the current  analysis can possibly 
extend  to  the  corresponding  LVCs  in  other 
languages (especially Japanese since it has similar 
LVCs with the light verb suru 'do' and allows serial 
verbs). The VPs with the verbs start or finish (see 
Pustejovsky, 1991) can also be accounted for using 
the  qualia  structure:  e.g.,  pap-ul sicakhata/ 
kkuthnayta 'start/ finish (cooking/*eating) the rice', 
khephi-lul sicakhata/  kkuthnayta 'start/  finish 
(brewing/*drinking)  the  coffee',  khemphuthe-lul  
sicakhata/  kkuthnayta 'start/  finish 
(*building/using)  the  computer'  and  *mwul-ul 
sicakhata/  kkuthnayta.  My  temporary  hypothesis 
for such the VPs is that there is the ranking (that is, 
agentive role > telic role), so the agentive role of a 
common  noun  object  is  used  first  with  start or 
finish,  but  if  agentive  role  is  not  available,  then 
telic  role  is  used,  and  if  even  telic  role  is  not 
available, then it is ungrammatical.   

More comprehensive research with corpus data 
and the actual implementation of the analysis in the 
Linguistic  Knowledge  Building (LKB)  system 
(Copestake, 2002) are left for future work.
