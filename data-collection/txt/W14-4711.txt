Abstract
Multilinguality is a key feature of today’s Web, and it is this feature that we leverage and exploit
in our research work at the Sapienza University of Rome’s Linguistic Computing Laboratory,
which I am going to overview and showcase in this talk.

I will start by presenting BabelNet 2.5 (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), available at
http://babelnet.org, a very large multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and semantic net-
work, which covers 50 languages and provides both lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge
for all the open-class parts of speech, thanks to the seamless integration of WordNet, Wikipedia,
Wiktionary, OmegaWiki, Wikidata and the Open Multilingual WordNet. In order to construct
the BabelNet network, we extract at different stages: from WordNet, all available word senses
(as concepts) and all the lexical and semantic pointers between synsets (as relations); from
Wikipedia, all the Wikipages (i.e., Wikipages, as concepts) and semantically unspecified rela-
tions from their hyperlinks. WordNet and Wikipedia overlap both in terms of concepts and
relations: this overlap makes the merging between the two resources possible, enabling the cre-
ation of a unified knowledge resource. In order to enable multilinguality, we collect the lexical
realizations of the available concepts in different languages. Finally, we connect the multilingual
Babel synsets by establishing semantic relations between them.

Next, I will present Babelfy (Moro et al., 2014), available at http://babelfy.org, a unified
approach that leverages BabelNet to perform Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity
Linking in arbitrary languages, with performance on both tasks on a par with, or surpassing, those
of task-specific state-of-the-art supervised systems. Babelfy works in three steps: first, given a
lexicalized semantic network, we associate with each vertex, i.e., either concept or named entity,
a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices. This is a preliminary step which needs
to be performed only once, independently of the input text. Second, given a text, we extract all
the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, list the possible meanings according
to the semantic network. Third, we create a graph-based semantic interpretation of the whole
text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed
semantic signatures. We then extract a dense subgraph of this representation and select the best
candidate meaning for each fragment. Our experiments show state-of-the-art performances on
both WSD and EL on 6 different datasets, including a multilingual setting.

In the third part of the talk I will present two novel approaches to large-scale knowledge acqui-
sition and validation developed in my lab. I will first introduce video games with a purpose
(Vannella et al., 2014), a novel, powerful paradigm for the large scale acquisition and validation
of knowledge and data (http://knowledgeforge.org). We demonstrate that converting
games with a purpose into more traditional video games provides a fun component that moti-
vates players to annotate for free, thereby significantly lowering annotation costs below that of
crowdsourcing. Moreover, we show that video games with a purpose produce higher-quality
annotations than crowdsourcing.

Then I will introduce the Wikipedia Bitaxonomy (Flati et al., 2014, WiBi), available at
http://wibitaxonomy.org and now integrated into BabelNet. WiBi is the largest and
most accurate currently available taxonomy of Wikipedia pages and taxonomy of categories,
aligned to each other. WiBi is created in three steps: we first create a taxonomy for the Wikipedia
pages by parsing textual definitions, extracting the hypernym(s) and disambiguating them accord-
ing to the page inventory; next, we leverage the hypernyms in the page taxonomy, together with
their links to the corresponding categories, so as to induce a taxonomy over Wikipedia categories
while at the same time improving the page taxonomy in an iterative way; finally we employ
structural heuristics to overcome inherent problems affecting categories. The output of our three-
phase approach is a bitaxonomy of millions of pages and hundreds of thousands of categories for
the English Wikipedia.
