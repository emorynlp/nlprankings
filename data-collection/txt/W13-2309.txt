Abstract 

Discourse relation may entail sentiment in-
formation. In this work, we annotate both 
discourse relation and sentiment information 
on a moderate-sized Chinese corpus extracted 
from the ClueWeb09. Based on the annota-
tion, we investigate the association between 
the relation type and the sentiment polarity in 
Chinese and interpret the data from various 
aspects. Finally, we highlight some language 
phenomena and give some remarks. 

1 Introduction 
A discourse relation indicates how two argu-
ments (i.e., elementary discourse units) cohere to 
each other. Various discourse relations were de-
fined according to different taxonomy (Carlson 
and Marcu, 2001; Carlson et al., 2002; Prasad et 
al., 2008). In the work of the Penn Discourse 
Treebank 2.0 annotation, Prasad et al. (2008) 
labeled four grammatical classes of connectives 
in English, including subordinating conjunctions, 
coordinating conjunctions, adverbial connectives, 
and implicit connectives. Besides, the sense of 
each connective was also tagged. They defined 
three levels of sense hierarchy for the connec-
tives. The four classes on the top level are Tem-
poral, Contingency, Comparison, and Expansion.  

There are explicit and implicit uses of dis-
course relations. An explicit discourse relation 
indicates the arguments are connected with an 
overt discourse marker (i.e., connective). A con-
nective joins two discourse units such as phrases, 
clauses, or sentences together. For example, the 
word however is a common connective that indi-
cates a Comparison relation between two argu-
ments. The sense of a discourse marker denotes 
how its two arguments cohere. In other words, a 

discourse marker presents the relation of its two 
arguments. 

In other cases, discourse marker is absent from 
an implicit relation. However, readers can still 
infer the relation from its argument pair. To re-
solve implicit discourse relations, i.e., without 
the information from discourse markers, is more 
challenging (Lin et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010).   

Hutchinson (2004) pointed out the properties 
of a discourse marker from three dimensions, 
including polarity, veridicality, and type. The 
polarity of a discourse marker indicates the sen-
timent transition of its two arguments. Veridi-
cality, the second dimension of a discourse 
marker, specifies whether both the two argu-
ments are true or not. Type, similar to the sense 
which is annotated in the PDTB, is the third di-
mension of a discourse marker.  

Our previous work (Huang and Chen, 2012a; 
Huang and Chen, 2012b) addressed the interac-
tion between the sentiment polarity and the dis-
course structure in Chinese. Consider (S1), 
which consists of three clauses and forms a nest-
ed discourse structure shown in Figure 1. 

 
(S1) 管理處雖然嘗試要讓長期以來作為大

台北後花園的陽明山區更回歸自然 (Although 
the management office tried to make the Yang-
mingshan area a more natural environment as the 
long-term garden of Taipei)，但隨著週休二日、
經濟環境改善 (but due to the two-day weekend 
and the improved economic conditions)，遊客
帶來停車、垃圾等間接影響卻更嚴重 (the is-
sues of tourist parking, garbage, and other indi-
rect effects become more serious)。 

 
The second and the third clauses form a Con-

tingency relation with a sentiment polarity transi-
tion from Positive to Negative. Furthermore, 

70



 
Figure 1: Discourse structure and sentiment po-

larities of (S1). 
 
these two clauses also constitute one of the ar-
guments of a Positive-Negative Comparison rela-
tion. As the PDTB 2.0 annotation manual sug-
gests (Prasad, et al., 2007), a Comparison rela-
tion is established to emphasize the differences 
between two arguments. Therefore, it is expected 
that the two arguments of a Comparison relation 
are relatively likely to have the opposing polarity 
states (i.e., Positive-Negative or Negative-
Positive). On the other hand, the two arguments 
of an Expansion relation are relatively likely to 
belong to the same polarity states (e.g., Positive-
Positive or Neutral-Neutral).  

Discourse relation recognition (Hernault et al., 
2010; Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and sentiment 
analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) have attracted 
much attention recently. Due to the limitation of 
the resources, the research on Chinese discourse 
relation analysis is relatively rare. In our previ-
ous work, we annotated a collection of Chinese 
discourse corpora, namely NTU Chinese Dis-
course Resources (http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ntu-
discourse/), for inter-sentential and intra-
sentential discourse relation recognition (Huang 
and Chen, 2011; Huang and Chen, 2012a). How-
ever, no sentiment information is labeled in these 
corpora. In another work (Huang and Chen, 
2012b), we proposed an annotation scheme to 
construct a Chinese discourse corpus with rich 
information including sentiment polarities, but 
the corpus is still under construction due to its 
complexity. Zhou and Xue (2012) did PDTB-
style Chinese discourse corpus annotation, but 
the corpus is also not available yet. 

In this paper, we annotate a moderate-sized 
Chinese corpus with the information of discourse 
relations and sentiment polarities. Total 7,638 
sentences are sampled from the ClueWeb09. We 
review the results of annotation and analyze 
some language phenomena found in the corpus.  

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we introduce the ClueWeb corpus 

and a dictionary of Chinese discourse markers. In 
Section 3, the criteria to sample instances and the 
annotation scheme are shown. We analyze the 
language phenomena found in the annotated data 
and discuss the correlation between discourse 
relations and sentiment polarities in Section 4. 
Finally, we conclude the remarks in Section 5.  

2 Linguistic Resources 
The PDTB is a popular dataset used in the Eng-
lish discourse research. In contrast, no Chinese 
discourse corpus is publicly available at present. 
To construct a Chinese discourse corpus, we 
sample instances from a huge Chinese corpus 
(Yu et al., 2012). This corpus was developed 
based on the ClueWeb09 dataset, where Chinese 
material is the second largest. It contains a total 
of 9,598,430,559 POS-tagged sentences in 
172,298,866 documents.   

In this paper, only the explicit discourse rela-
tions are concerned. A dictionary of discourse 
markers is consulted to extract the instances of 
explicit discourse relations from the ClueWeb. 
This Chinese discourse marker dictionary is de-
veloped based on Cheng and Tian (1989), Cheng 
(2006) and Lu (2007). Table 1 shows an over-
view of the discourse marker dictionary. It con-
tains 808 words and word pairs mapped into the 
PDTB four top-level classes (Cheng and Tian, 
1989; Wolf and Gibson, 2005). Besides the types 
of discourse relations, we further classify the 
markers into three groups of scopes shown in the 
second column, including Single word, Intra-
sentential, and Inter-sentential, according to their 
grammatical usages. The Single word group con-
tains those individual words used as discourse 
markers. The Intra-sentential group contains 
pairs of words that occur inside the same senten-
ce and denote a discourse relation. Here, a Chi-
nese sentence is defined as a sequence of succes-
sive words that is ended by a period, a question 
mark, or an exclamation mark. The clauses of a 
sentence are delimited by commas. The Inter-
sentential discourse markers are similar to the 
Intra-sentential ones, but the two words of a pair 
individually appear in different sentences. Some 
discourse markers can be used as both Inter-
sentential and Intra-sentential. In this work, the 
Inter-sentential only discourse markers are ex-
cluded because we only concern the discourse 
relation occurring within a sentence. The third 
column lists the number of discourse markers for 
each scope under each PDTB class, and the 
fourth column gives some examples.

3 Annotation 
Based on the Chinese part of the ClueWeb09 (Yu 
et al., 2012), we sample a moderate-sized data 
with some criteria and annotate them with the 
information of discourse relations and sentiment 
polarities. 

3.1 Sampling a reliable dataset 
Discourse relations may be explicit or implicit, 
and a sentence may contain more than one dis-
course marker. Multiple discourse relations oc-
curring in a sentence will make the annotation 
more complex. In this work, we focus on the cor-
relation between discourse relations and senti-
ment polarity. To get a reliable dataset for analy-
sis, we sample sentences based on the following 
three criteria. 

1.  A sentence should contain only two clauses. 
2. A sentence should contain exact one dis-

course marker shown in the Chinese discourse 
marker dictionary. We match the discourse 
marker on the word level. For the Single word 
markers, the marker can appear in either of the 
clauses. For the pairwise markers, the first word 
should appear in the first clause, and the second 
word should appear in the second one. 

3. The lengths of both clauses in a sentence 
are no more than 20 Chinese characters.  

As shown in Figure 1, the sentiment polarity 
determination is more challenging when more 
than one discourse relation is involved in a sen-
tence. In order to facilitate the analysis, we focus 
on those sentences that contain exact one dis-

course marker. The limitation of clause length is 
also applied to avoid the noise from implicit dis-
course relation. Based on a preliminary statistics, 
we find that most clauses in the Chinese part of 
the ClueWeb (Yu et al., 2012) are no longer than 
20 Chinese characters shown in Figure 2. 

 
Figure 2: Length distribution in the ClueWeb. 

3.2 Annotation scheme 
Using the criteria described in Section 3.1, total 
7,638 instances are randomly selected from the 
ClueWeb, and 87 native speakers annotate these 
instances. Each instance is shown to three anno-
tators. The annotator labels the polarities of the 
first clause, the second clause, and the whole in-
stance with Negative, Neutral, and Positive. In 
addition, the discourse relation between the two 
clauses is also labeled with Temporal, Contin-
gency, Comparison, and Expansion. For each 
target sentence, the annotation is based on the 
information from the sentence only. The sen-
tences are not given to annotators. Finally, the 
majority of each label is taken. For example, the 

72



polarity p1 of the first clause in the instance (S2) 
is labeled as Positive, the polarity p2 of the sec-
ond clause is labeled as Negative, the resulting 
polarity pw of the whole sentence is also labeled 
as Negative, and the discourse relation between 
the two clauses is labeled as Comparison.   

 (S2) 法國品牌的汽車在本土市場的佔有率
雖然過半 (Although French brand cars share 
more than half of the domestic market share)，
但市場份額持續萎縮 (but the market share con-
tinued to shrink)。 

The inter-agreements of p1, p2, pw, and dis-
course relation among annotators are 0.49, 0.50, 
0.47, and 0.41 in Fleiss’ Kappa values, respec-
tively (all are moderate agreement). The result-
ing corpus is publicly available on the website of 
NTU Chinese Discourse Resources1.  

4 Results and Discussion 
To investigate the corpus annotated with dis-
course relation and sentiment polarity, we firstly 
give an overview of results with respect to these 
two types of linguistic phenomena. And then, the 
most frequent discourse markers for each class of 
discourse relations are discussed. Finally, we 
reorganize the results to several aspects and dis-
cuss the association between discourse relations 
and sentiment polarities.  

4.1 Overview of the annotated corpus 
The distribution of the discourse relations versus 
the polarities of whole sentence (pw) is shown in 
Table 2. Compared to the distributions of dis-
course relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank 
(Prasad et al., 2008) shown in Table 3, the ex-
plicit Chinese discourse corpus is more similar to 
the whole English corpus. The instances of Ex-
pansion form the largest set among four dis-
course relation classes. In Chinese, the instances 
of Expansion are even more. Temporal is the 
most infrequent relation which has close fre-
quencies in both corpora. The different charac-
teristic is the frequency of Comparison relation. 
In our Chinese corpus, the frequency of Compar-
ison relation is about half of that in the PDTB.  

In Table 2, the symbol † is used to highlight 
the relatively major polarity of each relation. The 
symbol ‡ is marked when the polarity is the ma-
jority (i.e., with a frequency greater than 50%). 
Near half (49.11%) of the instances belong to 
Neutral. Neutral statements are major in Tem-

poral and Expansion classes. On the other hand, 
Comparison is the relation which is most in-
volved in expressing sentiment, negative senti-
ment in particular. Contingency is second to 
Comparison in expressing sentiment. 

The distribution of the discourse relations ver-
sus (p1, p2), the sentiment polarity transitions be-
tween two clauses, is shown in Table 4. Neutral-
Neutral is the most frequent polarity transition in 
all relations. More than half of the Temporal in-
stances are Neutral-Neutral. The reason may be 
that the Temporal relations are usually used in 
the sentences that describe the objective facts of 
the past, present, or the future. In such sentences, 
the sentiments are relatively rare. On the other 
hand, the sentences of Comparison and Contin-
gency occur more in the critical and analytical 
scenarios. 

Although the most frequent transition of Com-
parison is also Neutral-Neutral (23.14%), the 
other three types of transitions, Positive-Negative, 
Neutral-Negative, and Negative-Positive, have 
close frequencies of 22.71%, 16.90%, and 
15.72%, respectively. Moreover, Negative polar-
ity is involved in all these three transitions in one 
of their clauses. 

The relations between p1, p2, and pw are also 
interesting. Table 5 shows the top 10 most fre-
quent correlations of the polarities (p1, p2, pw) of 
the first clause, the second clause, and the whole 
sentence. On the one hand, it is not surprising 
that most instances belong to (Neutral, Neutral, 
Neutral). On the other hand, it is worthy of not-
ing that p2 and pw are identical in the top eight 
types of combinations in Table 5. In other words, 
the resulting sentiment polarity of a two-clause 
sentence is mostly consistent with the polarity of

of sentiment polarities between clauses and the 
whole sentence. Total 92.50% of instances be-
long to the case (p2 = pw), where the polarity of 
the second clause is identical to the polarity of 
the whole sentence. In Chinese writing, putting 
the important part of a sentence at the end of the 
sentence is very common.  

4.2 Frequent discourse markers 
The top discourse markers in our Chinese corpus 
are shown in Table 7. For each PDTB class, the 
five most frequent discourse markers are listed. 
In each row of the table, its number of occur-
rences and the distribution of its nine sentiment 
polarity transitions are given. Note that there are 
three polarities, i.e., positive, neutral, and nega-
tive. The relatively major sentiment polarity tran-
sition of each discourser maker is labeled with 
the symbol †. The symbol ‡ is marked when the 
sentiment polarity is the majority, i.e., its ratio is 
greater than 50%. 

Some discourse markers are the top markers in 
more than one discourse relation such as 也 (also) 
and 還 (still). In the discourse marker dictionary, 
the word 也  (also) is defined as a discourse 

marker of the Expansion relation. However, this 
word is frequent in the instances of all the four 
relations. In different relations, the distributions 
of the sentiment transitions of this word differ. In 
other words, the word 也  (also), which is a 
common word in Chinese, is not only used as a 
discourse marker for emphasizing the Expansion 
relation, but also has various senses in other us-
ages.  

For instance, the word 也 in (S3) is a dis-
course marker to denote an Expansion relation, 
but it is a particle in (S4). In fact, (S4) is an in-
stance of the implicit Contingency relation. We 
ignore all of instances of the word 也 (also) in 
the following analysis since it is an outlier. 

(S3) 這既是對我們工作的肯定 (This is an af-
firmation of our work)，也是對我們的一種鼓
勵和鞭策(and also our encouragement and mo-
tivation)。 

(S4) 不能放開心前行 (The mind cannot be 
open to forward progress)，天地也變得狹小 
(the world becomes narrow)。 

The word 還 (still) is another ambiguous dis-
course marker. Besides the Expansion relation 
defined in the dictionary, it is sometimes used to 
denote the Temporal relation, especially in the 
negation context, e.g., 還沒 (not yet). 

The two frequent discourse markers of the 
Contingency relation, 由於 (due to) and 因為 
(because) share the similar sense, and their dis-
tributions of sentiment polarity transitions are 
more consistent than the other markers of the 
Contingency relation.  

The most frequent discourse marker of the 
Comparison class is 但 (but). The other two dis-
course markers 卻 (but) and 但是 (but) share the 
similar sense, however, their polarity distribu-
tions differ significantly. Compared to the more 
general marker 但  (but), the second frequent 
marker 卻 (but) is bolder and more critical. (S5) 
is an example of the marker 卻 (but). As shown 
in our data, the marker 卻 (but) is likely to high-
light the negative sentences.

The other discourser marker 但是 (but) is an 
emphasized version of the marker 但 (but) so 
that it is more likely used in the stronger polarity 
transitions such as Positive-Negative and Nega-
tive-Positive. In addition, the sense of the marker 
而 (however) is also similar to the sense of 但 
(but), but it is more frequent to be used in the 
neutral situations. These linguistic phenomena 
show that the synonyms may have different sen-
timent usages in the real world. 

4.3 Association between discourse relation 
and sentiment polarity 

To analyze the data at a higher level, we reor-
ganize the sentiment transitions into several tran-
sition categories from four aspects. The details 
are shown in Table 8. The first aspect is Polarity 
Tendency, which classifies the transitions into 
three categories, including Positive-Tendency, 
Neutral, and Negative-Tendency. This aspect 
reflects the overall polarity of both arguments. 
The Negative-Positive transition is considered as 
Positive-Tendency because the emphasis of a 
Chinese sentence is usually placed in the last 
clause. Similarly, the Positive-Negative transition 
is considered as Negative-Tendency. The second 
aspect is Polarity Change, which indicates if the 
polarities of both arguments are opposite. Only 
Negative-Positive and Positive-Negative are re-
garded as Opposite. All the rest transitions are 

treated as NonOpposite. The third aspect is Di-
rection, which captures the movement from the 
first clause to the second one. To-Positive stands 
for the transitions in which the polarity of the 
second clause is more positive than that of the 
first clause. On the other hand, To-Negative 
stands for the transitions in which the polarity of 
the second clause is less positive than that of the 
first clause. Equal stands for the cases in which 
the polarities of both clauses are identical. The 
last aspect is Negativity, which regards the polar-
ity of an argument as binary values, i.e., Negative 
and NonNegative. In this way, we re-classify the 
nine-way sentiment polarity transitions into four 
transitions. In other words, both the polarity 
states Neutral and Positive are merged into one 
state NonNegative in this aspect. Such a binary 
scheme is also used in some related work, in 
which the negative polarity is distinguished and 
the rest are considered Positive (Kim and Hovy, 
2004; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007). For each type of 
each aspect, five discourse markers that occur 
more than 10 times in the dataset and have the 
highest ratio of the corresponding type are listed 
in the fifth column of Table 8 as significant dis-
course markers.  

We analyze the annotations according to the 
four aspects, and the results are shown in Table 9. 
The chi-squared test is used to test the dependen-
cy between the PDTB classes of discourse mark-
ers and each aspect of sentiment transitions. The 
results show that no matter whether the senti-
ment polarity transitions are categorized into Po-
larity Tendency, Polarity Change, Direction, or 
Negativity, the classes of discourse relations are 

75



significantly dependent on the sentiment polari-
ties of the arguments at p=0.001. 

In the aspect of Polarity Tendency, the ratios 
of Neutral in the Temporal and Expansion rela-
tions are 57.01% and 48.33%, respectively, 
which are definitely higher than those of Contin-
gency and Comparison relations. In other words, 
the two arguments of Contingency and Compari-
son relations are less likely to be neutral. The 
ratio of Negative-Tendency of the Comparison 
relation is 46.72%. It confirms the Comparison 
relation is likely to be involved in negative 
statements. As shown in Table 8, three of the 
five significant discourse markers of Negative-
Tendency are the synonyms of 卻 (but), which 
are discourse markers of  the Comparison rela-
tion. The other two markers, 否則 (otherwise) 
and 因 (because), are discourse markers of the 
Contingency relation. Like the word otherwise in 
English, 否則 (otherwise) is used for introducing 
what bad scenario will happen if something is 
not done. The marker 因 (because) is not only a 
significant discourse marker of the category 
Negative-Tendency, but also a significant marker 

of Negative-Negative from the aspect of Negativ-
ity. From the real data, we find this marker is 
often used in bad cause-and-effect statements. 
(S6) is an example. The usage of the other dis-
course marker 因為  (because), which is a syno-
nyms of 因 (because), is more general.  

(S6) 因毛巾日久不見陽光 (Because the tow-
el is without sunlight for a long time)，容易滋
生細菌和真菌 (it is easy to breed bacteria and 
fungi)。 

The ratio of Opposite of Comparison relation 
from the aspect of Polarity Change is 38.43%. 
Although it is not as high as expected, it is the 
highest among the four PDTB classes and much 
higher than those of three other classes. Com-
pared to the other classes, Comparison is most 
likely to have a pair of opposite arguments. 

Four of the five significant discourse markers 
of Opposite in Table 8 are the synonyms of 但 
(but). Expansion relation has the highest ratio of 
NonOpposite. This matches our expectation that 
the Expansion relation is used to concatenate 
several events which have similar properties

from certain perspective. 
The ratio of To-Negative of Comparison rela-

tion from the aspect of Direction in Table 9 is 
42.30%, which is significantly higher than the 
ratios of To-Negative of the other classes. This 
also confirms the Comparison relation is likely 
to be used to express critical opinions. Further-
more, the ratio of Equal of Comparison relations 
is much lower than those of other classes. This 
result shows the Comparison relation is more 
involved in sentiment polarity transitions. 

The Negativity aspect in Table 9 also shows 
the NonNegative-Negative is more likely to hap-
pen than the Negative-NonNegative in all rela-
tions. This statistics reflects a particular phenom-
enon “good words ahead” in Chinese.  That is, 
speakers tend to express a negative opinion after 
kind words. 

The sentiment polarity flips in the instances of 
the two categories Negative-NonNegative and 
NonNegative-Negative. However, the significant 
discourse markers of the two categories are very 
different. In spite of the general marker 但是 
(but), the discourse markers 卻 (but), 否則 (oth-
erwise), 即使...也 (even if...), and 可是 (but) are 
often used in NonNegative-Negative, which usu-
ally results a negative remark. On the other hand, 
the discourse markers 雖然...但 (although...), 不
過 (but), 終於 (finally), and 但 (but) are often 
used in Negative-NonNegative, which usually 
results a positive remark. For example, the dis-
course marker 終於 (finally), which is a dis-
course marker of the Temporal relation, is usu-
ally used when an event successfully accom-
plished after twists and turns such as (S7). 

(S7) 歷經多次磨難的國產手機巨頭波導

many tribulations)，終於成功轉戰汽車行業

industry)。 

5 Conclusion 
To investigate the discourse relation and the sen-
timent polarity of Chinese discourse markers, we 
construct a moderate-sized corpus based on the 
Chinese part of ClueWeb09. In this paper, our 
annotation scheme and the analysis of the anno-
tation results are shown. Total 7,638 instances 
are annotated by native speakers. The discourse 
relation distribution of the annotated data is 
comparable to the distribution of the well-known 
English discourse corpus PDTB 2.0. Through the 
data analysis, we validate certain human intui-
tions in Chinese language. Near half of instances 
are in neutral sentiment while the Comparison 
relation is most likely to be involved in negative 
sentiment. Furthermore, the high sentiment de-
pendency between the last clause and the whole 
sentence is validated in the data. 

The data shows the significant association be-
tween the discourse relation and the sentiment 
polarity. The arguments of a Comparison rela-
tion or a Contingency relation are more likely to 
be involved in expressing sentiment. Moreover, 
the Comparison relation often occurs in the sen-
tences with sentiment polarity transitions, and 
frequently occurs in the instances with the nega-
tive sentiment. On the other hand, the arguments 
of the Temporal and the Expansion relations are 
relatively objective. The behavior of word choice 
between synonyms is also observed in the data. 
Each synonym of a sense may have its own us-
age in expressing sentiment. 

This paper points out the ambiguities of the 
discourse markers in Chinese.  That is, a marker 
may suggest more than one discourse relation. 
Besides, words may have both the functions of 
discourse connectives and non-discourse ones in 
their surface forms. These two issues make the 
interpretation of Chinese discourse markers more 
challenging. Determination of their correct uses 
and disambiguation of their discourse functions 
will be investigated in the future.
