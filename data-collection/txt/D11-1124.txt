Abstract

Most traditional summarization methods treat
their outputs as static and plain texts, which
fail to capture user interests during summa-
rization because the generated summaries are
the same for different users. However, users
have individual preferences on a particular
source document collection and obviously a
universal summary for all users might not al-
ways be satisfactory. Hence we investigate
an important and challenging problem in sum-
mary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized
Summarization (IPS), which generates sum-
maries in an interactive and personalized man-
ner. Given the source documents, IPS captures
user interests by enabling interactive clicks
and incorporates personalization by model-
ing captured reader preference. We develop
experimental systems to compare 5 rival al-
gorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets
which amount to 5197 documents. Evalua-
tion results in ROUGE metrics indicate the
comparable performance between IPS and the
best competing system but IPS produces sum-
maries with much more user satisfaction ac-
cording to evaluator ratings. Besides, low
ROUGE consistency among these user pre-
ferred summaries indicates the existence of
personalization.

1 Introduction

In the era of information explosion, people need new
information to update their knowledge whilst infor-
mation on Web is updating extremely fast. Multi-
document summarization has been proposed to ad-
dress such dilemma by producing a summary de-

livering the majority of information content from a
document set, and hence is a necessity.

Traditional summarization methods play an im-
portant role with the exponential document growth
on the Web. However, for the readers, the impact of
human interests has seldom been considered. Tra-
ditional summarization utilizes the same methodol-
ogy to generate the same summary no matter who is
reading. However, users may have bias on what they
prefer to read due to their potential interests: they
need personalization. Therefore, traditional summa-
rization methods are to some extent insufficient.

Topic biased summarization tries for personaliza-
tion by pre-defining human interests as several gen-
eral categories, such as health or science. Readers
are required to select their possible interests before
summary generation so that the chosen topic has
priority during summarization. Unfortunately, such
topic biased summarization is not sufficient for two
reasons: (1) interests cannot usually be accurately
pre-defined by ambiguous topic categories and (2)
user interests cannot always be foreknown. Often
users do not really know what general ideas or detail
information they are interested in until they read the
summaries. Therefore, more flexible interactions
are required to establish personalization.

Due to all the insufficiencies of existed sum-
marization approaches, we introduce a new multi-
document summarization task of Interactive Person-
alized Summarization (IPS) and a novel solution for
the task. Taking a document collection as input, the
system outputs a summary aligned both with source
corpus and with user personalization, which is cap-
tured by flexible human−system interactions. We

1342



build an experimental system on 4 real datasets to
verify the effectiveness of our methods compared
with 4 rivals. The contribution of IPS is manifold
by addressing following challenges:
• The 1st challenge for IPS is to integrate user

interests into traditional summary components. We
measure the utilities of these components and com-
bine them. We formulate the task into a balanced
optimization framework via iterative substitution to
generate summaries with maximum overall utilities.
• The 2nd challenge is to capture user inter-

ests through interaction. We develop an interactive
mechanism of “click” and “examine” between read-
ers and summaries and address sparse data by “click
smoothing” under the scenario of few user clicks.

We start by reviewing previous works. In Section
3 we provide IPS overview, describe user interac-
tion and optimize component combination with per-
sonalization. We conduct empirical evaluation and
demonstrate the experimental system in Section 4.
Finally we draw conclusions in Section 5.

2 Related Work

Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) has drawn
much attention in recent years and gained emphasis
in conferences such as ACL, EMNLP and SIGIR,
etc. General MDS can either be extractive or ab-
stractive. The former assigns salient scores to se-
mantic units (e.g. sentences, paragraphs) of the doc-
uments indicating their importance and then extracts
top ranked ones, while the latter demands informa-
tion fusion(e.g. sentence compression and reformu-
lation). Here we focus on extractive summarization.

Centroid-based method is one of the most popular
extractive summarization method. MEAD (Radev
et al., 2004) and NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) are
such implementations, using position and term fre-
quency, etc. MMR (Goldstein et al., 1999) algorithm
is used to remove redundancy. Most recently, the
graph-based ranking methods have been proposed to
rank sentences or passages based on the “votes” or
“recommendations” between each other. The graph-
based methods first construct a graph representing
the sentence relationships at different granularities
and then evaluate the saliency score of the sentences
based on the graph. TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2005) and LexPageRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004)

use algorithms similar to PageRank and HITS to
compute sentence importance. Wan et al. improve
the graph-ranking algorithm by differentiating intra-
document and inter-document links between sen-
tences (2007b) and incorporate cluster information
in the graph model to evaluate sentences (2008).

To date, topics (or themes, clusters) in documents
have been discovered and used for sentence selec-
tion for topic biased summarization (Wan and Yang,
2008; Gong and Liu, 2001). Wan et al. have
proposed a manifold-ranking method to make uni-
form use of sentence-to-sentence and sentence-to-
topic relationships to generate topic biased sum-
maries (2007a). Leuski et al. in (2003) pre-define
several topic concepts, assuming users will foresee
their interested topics and then generate the topic
biased summary. However, such assumption is not
quite reasonable because user interests may not be
forecasted, or pre-defined accurately as we have ex-
plained in last section.

The above algorithms are usually traditional ex-
tensions of generic summarizers. They do not in-
volve interactive mechanisms to capture reader in-
terests, nor do they utilize user preference for per-
sonalization in summarization. Wan et al. in (2008)
have proposed a summarization biased to neighbor-
ing reading context through anchor texts. How-
ever, such scenario does not apply to contexts with-
out human-edited anchor texts like Wikipedia they
have used. Our approach can naturally and simulta-
neously take into account traditional summary ele-
ments and user interests and combine both in opti-
mization under a wider practical scenario.

3 Interactive Personalized Summarization

Personalization based on user preference can be
captured via various alternative ways, such as eye-
tracking or mouse-tracking instruments used in (Guo
and Agichtein, 2010). In this study, we utilize inter-
active user clicks/examinations for personalization.

Unlike traditional summarization, IPS supports
human−system interaction by clicking into the sum-
mary sentences and examining source contexts. The
implicit feedback of user clicks indicates what they
are interested in and the system collects preference
information to update summaries if readers wish to.
We obtain an associated tuple <q, c> between a

1343



clicked sentence q and the examined contexts c.
As q has close semantic coherence with neigh-

boring contexts due to consistency in human natural
language, we consider a window of sentences cen-
tered at the clicked sentence q as c, which is a bag of
sentences. The window size k is a parameter to set.

However, click data is often sparse: users are not
likely to click more than 1/10 of total summary sen-
tences within a single generation. We amplify these
tiny hints of user interest by click smoothing.

We change the flat summary structure into a hi-
erarchical organization by extracting important se-
mantic units (denoted as u) and establishing link-
age between them. If the clicked sentence q con-
tains u, we diffuse the click impact to the correlated
units, which makes a single click perform as multi-
ple clicks and the sparse data is smoothed.

Problem Formulation
Input: Given the sentence collection D decom-

posed by documents, D = {s1, s2, . . . , s|D|} and
the clicked sentence record Q = {q1, q2, . . . }, we
generate summaries in sentences. A user click is
associated with a tuple <q, (u), c> where the exis-
tence of u depends on whether q contains u. The
collection of semantic units is denoted as M =
{u1, u2, . . . , u|M |}.

Output: A summary S as a set of sentences
{s1, s2, . . . , s|S|} and S ⊂ D according to the pre-
specified compression rate φ (0 < φ < 1).

After the overview and formulation of IPS prob-
lem, we move on to the major components of User
Interaction and Personalized Summarization.

3.1 User Interaction
Hypertexify Summaries. We hypertexify the sum-
mary structure by establishing linkage between se-
mantic units. There are several possible formats for
semantic units, such as words or n-grams, etc. As
single words are proved to be not illustrative of se-
mantic meanings (Zhao et al., 2011) and n-grams are
rigid in length, we choose to extract semantic units
at a phrase granularity. Among all phrases from
source texts, some are of higher importance to at-
tract user interests, such as hot concepts or popu-
lar event names. We utilize the toolkit provided by
(Zhao et al., 2011) based on graph proximity LDA
(Blei et al., 2003) to extract key phrases and their
corresponding topic. A topic T is represented by

{(u1, π(u1, T )), (u2, π(u2, T )), . . . }where π(u, T )
is the probability of u belonging to topic T . We in-
vert the topic-unit representation in Table 1, where
each u is represented as a topic vector. The corre-
lation corr(.) between ui, uj is measured by cosine
similarity sim(.) on topic distribution vector ~ui, ~uj .

corr(ui, uj) = simtopic(~ui, ~uj) (1)

Table 1: Inverted representation of topic-unit vector.
~u1 π(u1, T1) π(u1, T2) . . . π(u1, Tn)
~u2 π(u2, T1) π(u2, T2) . . . π(u2, Tn)
...

...
...

...
...

~u|M | π(u|M |, T1) π(u|M |, T2) . . . π(u|M |, Tn)

When the summary is hypertexified by established
linkage, users click into the generated summary to
examine what they are interested in. A single click
on one sentence become multiple clicks via click
smoothing when the indicative function I(u|q) = 1.

I(u|q) =
{

1 q contains u;
0 otherwise.

(2)

The click smoothing brings pseudo clicks q′ asso-
ciated with u′ and contexts c′. The entire user feed-
back texts A from q can be written as:

A(q) = I(u|q)
|M |∑

j=1

corr(u′, u)(u′+γ ·c′)+γ ·c (3)

where γ is the weight tradeoff between u and asso-
ciated contexts c. If I(u|q) = 0, only the examined
context c is feedbacked for user preference; other-
wise, correlative contexts with u are taken into con-
sideration, which is a process of impact diffusion.

3.2 Personalized Summarization
Traditional summarization involves two essential re-
quirements: (1) coverage: the summary should
keep alignment with the source collection, which is
proved to be significant (Li et al., 2009). (2) di-
versity: according to MMR principle (Goldstein et
al., 1999) and its applications (Wan et al., 2007b;
Wan and Yang, 2008), a good summary should be
concise and contain as few redundant sentences as
possible, i.e., two sentences providing similar infor-
mation should not both present. According to our

1344



investigation, we observe that a well generated sum-
mary should properly consider a key component of
(3) user interests, which captures user preference to
summarize what they are interested in.

All above requirements involve a measurement
of similarity between two word distributions Θ1
and Θ2. Cosine, Kullback-Leibler divergence DKL
and Jensen Shannon divergence DJS are all able
to measure the similarity, but (Louis and Nenkova,
2009) indicate the superiority of DJS in summa-
rization task. We also introduce a pair of decreas-
ing/increasing logistic functions, L1(x) = 1/(1 +
ex) and L2(x) = ex/(1 + ex), to map the diver-
gence into interval [0,1]. V is the vocabulary set
and tf denotes the term frequency for word w.

DJS(Θ1||Θ2) =
1

2
[DKL(Θ1||Θ2)+DKL(Θ2||Θ1)]

where

DKL(Θ1||Θ2) =
∑

k∈V
p(w|Θ1)log

p(w|Θ1)
p(w|Θ2)

where

p(w|Θ) = tf(w,Θ)∑
w′ tf(w

′,Θ)
.

Modeling Interest for User Utility. Given a gener-
ated summary S, users tend to scrutinize texts rele-
vant to their interests. Texts related to user implicit
feedback are collected as A = ∑|Q|i=1A(qi). Intu-
itively, the smaller distance between the word distri-
bution of final summary (ΘS) and the word distri-
bution of user preference (ΘA), the higher utility of
user interests Uuser(S) will be, i.e.,

Uuser(S) = L1(DJS(ΘS ||ΘA)). (4)

We model the utility of traditional summarization
Utrad(S) using a linear interpolation controlled by
parameter δ between utility from coverage Uc(S)
and utility Ud(S) from diversity:

Utrad(S) = Uc(S) + δ · Ud(S). (5)

Coverage Utility. The summary should share a
closer word distribution with the source collection
(Allan et al., 2001; Li et al., 2009). A good summary
focuses on minimizing the loss of main information
from the whole collection D. Utility from coverage

Uc(S) is defined as follows and for coverage utility,
smaller divergence is desired.

Uc(S) = L1(DJS(ΘS ||ΘD)). (6)

Diversity Utility. Diversity measures the novelty
degree of any sentence s compared with all other
sentences within S, i.e., the distances between all
other sentences and itself. Diversity utility Ud(S) is
an average novelty score for all sentences in S. For
diversity utility, larger distance is desired, and hence
we use the increasing function L2 as follows:

Ud(S) =
1

|S|
∑

s∈S
L2(DJS(Θs||Θ(S−s))). (7)

3.3 Balanced Optimization Framework
A well generated summary S should be sufficiently
aligned with the original source corpus, and also
be optimized given the user interests. The utility
of an individual summary U(S) is evaluated by the
weighted combination of these components, con-
trolled by parameter λ for balanced weights.

U(S) = Utrad(S) + λ · Uuser(S) (8)

Given the sentence setD and the compression rate
φ, there are φ·|D| out of |D| possibilities to generate
S. The IPS task is to predict the optimized sentence
subset of S∗ from the space of all combinations. The
objective function is as follows:

S∗ = argmax
S

U(S). (9)

As U(S) is measured based on preferred interests
from user interaction within a generation in our sys-
tem, we extract S iteratively to approximate S∗, i.e,
maximize U(S) based on the user feedbacks from
the interaction sessions. Each session is an iteration.
We use a similar framework as we have proposed in
(Yan et al., 2011).

During every session, the top ranked sentences are
strong candidates for the summary to generate and
the rank methodology is based on the metrics U(.).
The algorithm tends to highly rank sentences which
are with both coverage utility and interest utility, and
are diversified in balance: we rank each sentence s
according to U(s) under such metrics.

Consider S(n−1) generated in the (n-1)-th session
which consists of top φ|D| ranked sentences, as well

1345



as the top φ|D| ranked sentences in the n-th iteration
(denoted by O(n)), they have an intersection set of
Z(n) = Sn−1∩On. There is a substitutable sentence
set X (n) = S(n−1) −Z(n) and a new candidate sen-
tence set Y(n) = O(n) − Z(n). We substitute x(n)
sentences with y(n), where x(n) ⊆ X (n) and y(n)
⊆ Y(n). During every iteration, our goal is to find a
substitutive pair <x,y> for S:

<x,y> : X × Y → R.

To measure the performance of such a substitu-
tion, a discriminant utility gain function ∆Ux,y

∆U (n)
x(n),y(n)

= U(S(n))− U(S(n−1))
= U((S(n−1) − x(n)) ∪ y(n))− U(S(n−1))

(10)
is employed to quantify the penalty. Therefore, we
predict the substitutive pair by maximizing the gain
function ∆Ux,y over the state set R, with a size of∑Y

k=0A
k
XC

k
Y , where <x,y>∈ R. Finally the ob-

jective function of Equation (9) changes into maxi-
mization of utility gain by substitute x̂ with ŷ during
each iteration:

< x̂, ŷ >= argmax
x⊆X ,y⊆Y

∆Ux,y. (11)

Note that the objectives of interest utility opti-
mization and traditional utility optimization are not
always the same because the word distributions in
these texts are usually different. The substitutive
pair <x,y> may perform well based on the user
preference component while not on the traditional
summary part and vice versa. There is a tradeoff
between both user optimization and traditional opti-
mization and hence we need to balance them by λ.

The objective Equation (11) is actually to maxi-
mize ∆U(S) from all possible substitutive pairs be-
tween two iteration sessions to generate S. The al-
gorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. The threshold � is
set at 0.001 in this study.

4 Experiments and Evaluation

4.1 Datasets
IPS can be tested on any document set but a tiny
corpus to summarize may not cover abundant effec-
tive interests to attract user clicks indicating their

preference. Besides, the scenario of small corpus is
not quite practical for the exponential growing web.
Therefore, we test IPS on large real world datasets.
We build 4 news story sets which consist of docu-
ments and reference summaries to evaluate our pro-
posed framework empirically. We downloaded 5197
news articles from 10 selected sources. As shown in
Table 2, three of the sources are in UK, one of them
is in China and the rest are in US. We choose them
because many of these websites provide handcrafted
summaries for their special reports, which serve as
reference summaries. These events belong to differ-
ent categories of Rule of Interpretation (ROI) (Ku-
maran and Allan, 2004). Statistics are in Table 3.

4.2 Experimental System Setups
• Preprocessing. Given a collection of documents,
we first decompose them into sentences. Stop-words
are removed and words stemming is performed.
Then the word distributions can be calculated.
• User Interface Design. Users are required to
specify the overall compression rate φ and the sys-
tem extracts φ|D| sentences according to user utility

1346



Figure 1: A demonstration system for Interactive Personalized Summarization when compression rate φ is specified
(e.g. 5%). For convenience of browsing, we number the selected sentences (see in part 3). Extracted semantic units,
such as “drilling mud”, are in bold and underlined format (see in part 1). When the user clicks a sentence (part 4), the
clicked sentence ID is kept in the click record (part 2). Mis-clicked records revocation can be operated by clicking
the deletion icon “X” (see in part 3). Once a sentence is clicked, user can track the sentence into the popup source
document to examine the contexts. The selected sentences are highlighted in the source documents (see in part 5).

and traditional utility. User utility is obtained from
interaction. The system keeps the clicked sentence
records and calculates the user feedback by Equa-
tion (3) during every session. Consider sometimes

users click into the summary due to confusion or
mis-operations, but not their real interests. The sys-
tem supports click records revocation. More details
of the user interface is demonstrated in Figure 1.

4.3 Evaluation Metrics

We include both subjective evaluation from 3 evalu-
ators based on their personalized interests and pref-
erence, and the objective evaluation based on the
widely used ROUGE metrics (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

Evaluator Judgments
Evaluators are requested to express an opinion

over all summaries based on the sentences which
they deem to be important for the news. In general
a summary can be rated in a 5-point scale, where
“1” for “terrible”, “2” for “bad”, “3” for “normal”,
“4” for “good” and “5” for “excellent”. Evaluators
are allowed to judge at any scores between 1 and 5,
e.g. a score of “3.3” is adopted when the evaluator
feels difficult to decide whether “3” or “4” is more

1347



appropriate but with preference towards “3”.
ROUGE Evaluation
The DUC usually officially employs ROUGE

measures for summarization evaluation, which mea-
sures summarization quality by counting overlap-
ping units such as the N-gram, word sequences, and
word pairs between the candidate summary and the
reference summary. We use ROUGE-N as follows:

ROUGE-N =

∑
S∈{RefSum}

∑
N-gram∈S

Countmatch(N-gram)

∑
S∈{RefSum}

∑
N-gram∈S

Count (N-gram)

whereN stands for the length of the N-gram and N-
gram∈RefSum denotes the N-grams in the reference
summaries while N-gram∈CandSum denotes the N-
grams in the candidate summaries. Countmatch(N-
gram) is the maximum number of N-gram in the
candidate summary and in the set of reference sum-
maries. Count(N-gram) is the number of N-grams in
the reference summaries or candidate summary.

According to (Lin and Hovy, 2003), among all
sub-metrics in ROUGE, ROUGE-N (N=1, 2) is rela-
tively simple and works well. In this paper, we eval-
uate our experiments using all methods provided by
the ROUGE package (version 1.55) and only report
ROUGE-1, since the conclusions drawn from differ-
ent methods are quite similar. Intuitively, the higher
the ROUGE scores, the similar two summaries are.

4.4 Algorithms for Comparison

We implement the following widely used multi-
document summarization algorithms as the baseline
systems, which are all designed for traditional sum-
marization without user interaction. For fairness we
conduct the same preprocessing for all algorithms.

Random: The method selects sentences ran-
domly for each document collection.

Centroid: The method applies MEAD algorithm
(Radev et al., 2004) to extract sentences according to
the following parameters: centroid value, positional
value, and first-sentence overlap.

GMDS: The Graph-based MDS proposed by
(Wan and Yang, 2008) first constructs a sentence
connectivity graph based on cosine similarity and
then selects important sentences based on the con-
cept of eigenvector centrality.

IPSini: The initial generated summary from IPS
merely models coverage and diversity utility, which

is similar to the previous work described in (Allan et
al., 2001) with different goals and frameworks.

IPS: Our proposed algorithms with personaliza-
tion component to capture interest by user feed-
backs. IPS generates summaries via iterative sen-
tence substitutions within user interactive sessions.

RefSum: As we have used multiple reference
summaries from websites, we not only provide
ROUGE evaluations of the competing systems but
also of the reference summaries against each other,
which provides a good indicator of not only the
upper bound ROUGE score that any system could
achieve, but also human inconsistency among refer-
ence summaries, indicating personalization.

4.5 Overall Performance Comparison

We take the average ROUGE-1 performance and hu-
man ratings on all sets. The overall results are shown
in Figure 2 and details are listed in Tables 4∼6.

Figure 2: Overall performance on 6 datasets.

From the results, we have following observations:
• Random has the worst performance as expected,

both in ROUGE-1 scores and human judgements.
• The ROUGE-1 and human ratings of Centroid

and GMDS are better than those of Random. This is
mainly because the Centroid based algorithm takes
into account positional value and first-sentence over-
lap, which facilitates main aspects summarization
and PageRank-based GMDS ranks the sentence us-
ing eigenvector centrality which implicitly accounts
for information subsumption among all sentences.
• In general, the GMDS system slightly outper-

forms Centroid system in ROUGE-1, but the human
judgements of GMDS and Centroid are of no signifi-
cant difference. This is probably due to the difficulty

of human judgements on comparable summaries.
• The results of ROUGE-1 and ratings for IPSini

are better than Random but worse than Centroid and
GMDS. The reason in this case may be that IPSini
does not capture sufficient attributes: coverage and
diversity are merely fundamental requirements.
• Traditional summarization considers sentence

selection based on corpus only, and hence neglects

user interests. Many sentences are extracted due to
arbitrary assumption of reader preference, which re-
sults in a low user satisfaction. Human judgements
under our proposed IPS framework greatly outper-
form baselines, indicating that the appropriate use
of human interests for summarization are beneficial.

The ROUGE-1 performance for IPS is not as ideal
as that of GMDS. This situation may result from the
divergence between user interests and general infor-
mation provided by mass media propaganda, which
again motivates the need for personalization.

Although the high disparities between different
human evaluators have been observed in (Gong and
Liu, 2001), we still examine the consistency among
3 evaluators and their preferred summaries to prove
the motivation of personalization in our work.

4.6 Consistency Analysis for Personalization

The low ROUGE-1 scores of RefSum indicate the
inconsistency among reference summaries. We con-
duct personalization analysis from two perspectives:
(1) human rating consistency and (2) content consis-
tency among human supervised summaries.

We calculate the mean and variance of rating vari-
ations among evaluator judgements, listed in Table

1349

vised summaries.

Evaluator 1 Evaluator 2 Evaluator 3
Evaluator 1 0.273 0.398
Evaluator 2 0.289 0.257
Evaluator 3 0.407 0.235

RefSum 0.365 0.302 0.394

8. We see that for Random the average rating vari-
ation is 0.25, for IPS is 0.27, for IPSini is 0.33, for
RefSum is 0.38, for GMDS is 0.47 and for Centroid
is the highest, 0.50. Such phenomenon indicates
for poor generated summaries, such as Random or
IPSini, humans have consensus, but for normal sum-
maries without personalized interests, they are likely
to have disparities, surprisingly, even for RefSum.
General summaries provided by mass media satisfy
part of audiences, but obviously not all of them.

The high rating consistency of IPS indicates peo-
ple tend to favor summaries generated according to
their interests. We next examine content consistency
of these summaries with high rating consistency.

As shown in Table 9, although highly scored,
these human supervised summaries still have low
content consistency (especially Evaluator 2). The
low content consistency between RefSum and su-
pervised summaries shows reader have individual
personalization. Note that the inconsistency among
evaluators is larger than that between RefSum and
supervised summaries, indicating interests take a
high proportion in evaluator supervised summaries.

4.7 Parameter Settings

δ controls coverage/diversity tradeoff. We tune δ on
IPSini and apply the optimal δ directly in IPS. Ac-
cording to the statistics in (Yan et al., 2010), the se-
mantic coherent context is about 7 sentences. There-
fore, we empirically choose k=3 for the examined
context window. The number of topics is set at
n=50. We assign an equal weight (γ = 1) to seman-
tic units and examined contexts according to analog-
ical research of summarization from implicit feed-
backs via clickthrough data (Sun et al., 2005).
λ is the key parameter in IPS approach, control-

ling the weight of user utility during the process of
interactive personalized summarization.

Through Figure 3, we see that when λ is small

Figure 3: λ v.s. human ratings and ROUGE scores.

(λ ∈ [0.01, 0.1]), both human judgements and
ROUGE evaluation scores have little difference.
When λ ∈ [0.1, 1], ROUGE scores increase signifi-
cantly but human satisfaction shows little response.
λ ∈ [1, 10] brings large user utility enhancement be-
cause user may find what they are interested in but
ROUGE scores start to decay. When λ ∈ [10, 100],
ROUGE scores drop much because the emphasized
user interests may guide the generated summaries
divergent away from the original corpus.

In Figure 4 we examine how λ attracts user clicks
and regeneration counts until satisfaction. As the re-
sult indicates, both counts increase as λ increases.
When λ is small (from 0.01 to 0.1), readers find
no more interesting aspects through clicks and re-
generations and stop due to the bad user experience.
As λ increases, the system mines more relevant sen-
tences according to personalized interests and hence
attracts user clicks and intention to regenerate.

5 Conclusion

We present an important and novel summariza-
tion problem, Interactive Personalized Summariza-
tion (IPS), which generates summaries based on
human−system interaction for “interests” and per-
sonalization. We formally formulate IPS as a combi-
nation of user utility and traditional summary utility,
such as coverage and diversity. We implement a sys-
tem under such framework for experiments on real
web datasets to compare all approaches. Through
our experiments we notice that user personalization
of interests plays an important role in summary gen-
eration, which largely increase human ratings due to
user satisfaction. Besides, our experiments indicate
the inconsistency between user preferred summaries
and reference summaries measured by ROUGE, and
hence prove the effectiveness of personalization.
