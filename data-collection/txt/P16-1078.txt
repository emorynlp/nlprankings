Abstract

Most of
the existing Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) models focus on the
conversion of sequential data and do
not directly use syntactic information.
We propose a novel end-to-end syntac-
tic NMT model, extending a sequence-
to-sequence model with the source-side
phrase structure. Our model has an at-
tention mechanism that enables the de-
coder to generate a translated word while
softly aligning it with phrases as well as
words of the source sentence. Experi-
mental results on the WAT’15 English-
to-Japanese dataset demonstrate that our
proposed model considerably outperforms
sequence-to-sequence attentional NMT
models and compares favorably with the
state-of-the-art tree-to-string SMT system.

1 Introduction

Machine Translation (MT) has traditionally been
one of the most complex language processing
problems, but recent advances of Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) make it possible to perform
translation using a simple end-to-end architecture.
In the Encoder-Decoder model (Cho et al., 2014b;
Sutskever et al., 2014), a Recurrent Neural Net-
work (RNN) called the encoder reads the whole
sequence of source words to produce a ﬁxed-
length vector, and then another RNN called the
decoder generates the target words from the vec-
tor. The Encoder-Decoder model has been ex-
tended with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et
al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a), which allows the
model to jointly learn the soft alignment between
the source language and the target language. NMT
models have achieved state-of-the-art results in
English-to-French and English-to-German trans-

and a Japanese word.

lation tasks (Luong et al., 2015b; Luong et al.,
2015a). However, it is yet to be seen whether
NMT is competitive with traditional Statistical
Machine Translation (SMT) approaches in trans-
lation tasks for structurally distant language pairs
such as English-to-Japanese.

Figure 1 shows a pair of parallel sentences in
English and Japanese. English and Japanese are
linguistically distant in many respects; they have
different syntactic constructions, and words and
phrases are deﬁned in different lexical units.
In
this example, the Japanese word “緑茶” is aligned
with the English words “green” and “tea”, and
the English word sequence “a cup of” is aligned
with a special symbol “null”, which is not explic-
itly translated into any Japanese words. One way
to solve this mismatch problem is to consider the
phrase structure of the English sentence and align
the phrase “a cup of green tea” with “緑茶”. In
SMT, it is known that incorporating syntactic con-
stituents of the source language into the models
improves word alignment (Yamada and Knight,
2001) and translation accuracy (Liu et al., 2006;
Neubig and Duh, 2014). However, the existing
NMT models do not allow us to perform this kind
of alignment.

In this paper, we propose a novel attentional
NMT model to take advantage of syntactic infor-

824

mation. Following the phrase structure of a source
sentence, we encode the sentence recursively in a
bottom-up fashion to produce a vector representa-
tion of the sentence and decode it while aligning
the input phrases and words with the output. Our
experimental results on the WAT’15 English-to-
Japanese translation task show that our proposed
model achieves state-of-the-art translation accu-
racy.

2 Neural Machine Translation

2.1 Encoder-Decoder Model
NMT is an end-to-end approach to data-driven
machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom,
2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al.,
2015). In other words, the NMT models directly
estimate the conditional probability p(y|x) given
a large collection of source and target sentence
pairs (x, y). An NMT model consists of an en-
coder process and a decoder process, and hence
they are often called Encoder-Decoder models. In
the Encoder-Decoder models, a sentence is treated
as a sequence of words.
In the encoder pro-
cess, the encoder embeds each of the source words
x = (x1, x2,··· , xn) into a d-dimensional vector
space. The decoder then outputs a word sequence
y = (y1, y2,··· , ym) in the target language given
the information on the source sentence provided
by the encoder. Here, n and m are the lengths
of the source and target sentences, respectively.
RNNs allow one to effectively embed sequential
data into the vector space.
In the RNN encoder, the i-th hidden unit hi ∈
Rd×1 is calculated given the i-th input xi and the
previous hidden unit hi−1 ∈ Rd×1,

hi = fenc(xi, hi−1),

(1)

where fenc is a non-linear function, and the initial
hidden unit h0 is usually set to zeros. The encod-
ing function fenc is recursively applied until the n-
th hidden unit hn is obtained. The RNN Encoder-
Decoder models assume that hn represents a vec-
tor of the meaning of the input sequence up to the
n-th word.

After encoding the whole input sentence into
the vector space, we decode it in a similar way.
The initial decoder unit s1 is initialized with the
input sentence vector (s1 = hn). Given the pre-
vious target word and the j-th hidden unit of the
decoder, the conditional probability that the j-th

target word is generated is calculated as follows:

p(yj|y<j, x) = g(sj),

(2)

where g is a non-linear function. The j-th hidden
unit of the decoder is calculated by using another
non-linear function fdec as follows:

sj = fdec(yj−1, sj−1).

(3)

We employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Gers et
al., 2000) in place of vanilla RNN units. The t-
th LSTM unit consists of several gates and two
different types of states: a hidden unit ht ∈ Rd×1
and a memory cell ct ∈ Rd×1,

it = σ(W (i)xt + U (i)ht−1 + b(i)),
ft = σ(W (f )xt + U (f )ht−1 + b(f )),
ot = σ(W (o)xt + U (o)ht−1 + b(o)),
˜ct = tanh(W (˜c)xt + U (˜c)ht−1 + b(˜c)),
ct = it ⊙ ˜ct + ft ⊙ ct−1,
ht = ot ⊙ tanh(ct),

(4)
where each of it, ft, ot and ˜ct ∈ Rd×1 denotes
an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and a
state for updating the memory cell, respectively.
W (·) ∈ Rd×d and U (·) ∈ Rd×d are weight matri-
ces, b(·) ∈ Rd×1 is a bias vector, and xt ∈ Rd×1
is the word embedding of the t-th input word. σ(·)
is the logistic function, and the operator ⊙ denotes
element-wise multiplication between vectors.

2.2 Attentional Encoder-Decoder Model
The NMT models with an attention mecha-
nism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a)
have been proposed to softly align each decoder
state with the encoder states. The attention mech-
anism allows the NMT models to explicitly quan-
tify how much each encoder state contributes to
the word prediction at each time step.

In the attentional NMT model in Luong et al.
(2015a), at the j-th step of the decoder process,
the attention score αj(i) between the i-th source
hidden unit hi and the j-th target hidden unit sj is
calculated as follows:

∑n
exp(hi · sj)
k=1 exp(hk · sj) ,

(5)

αj(i) =

where hi · sj is the inner product of hi and sj,
which is used to directly calculate the similarity
score between hi and sj. The j-th context vector

825

dj is calculated as the summation vector weighted
by αj(i):

n∑

dj =

αj(i)hi.

(6)

i=1

To incorporate the attention mechanism into the
decoding process, the context vector is used for the
the j-th word prediction by putting an additional
hidden layer ˜sj:

˜sj = tanh(Wd[sj; dj] + bd),

(7)
where [sj; dj] ∈ R2d×1 is the concatenation of sj
and dj, and Wd ∈ Rd×2d and bd ∈ Rd×1 are a
weight matrix and a bias vector, respectively. The
model predicts the j-th word by using the softmax
function:

p(yj|y<j, x) = softmax(Ws ˜sj + bs),

(8)
where Ws ∈ R|V |×d and bs ∈ R|V |×1 are a weight
matrix and a bias vector, respectively. |V | stands
for the size of the vocabulary of the target lan-
guage. Figure 2 shows an example of the NMT
model with the attention mechanism.

2.3 Objective Function of NMT Models
The objective function to train the NMT models
is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the translation
pairs in the training data:

J(θ) =

1
|D|

log p(y|x),

(9)

∑

(x,y)∈D

where D denotes a set of parallel sentence pairs.
The model parameters θ are learned through
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
3 Attentional Tree-to-Sequence Model
3.1 Tree-based Encoder + Sequential

Encoder

The exsiting NMT models treat a sentence as a
sequence of words and neglect the structure of

Figure 3: Proposed model: Tree-to-sequence at-
tentional NMT model.

a sentence inherent in language. We propose a
novel tree-based encoder in order to explicitly take
the syntactic structure into consideration in the
NMT model. We focus on the phrase structure of
a sentence and construct a sentence vector from
phrase vectors in a bottom-up fashion. The sen-
tence vector in the tree-based encoder is there-
fore composed of the structural information rather
than the sequential data. Figure 3 shows our pro-
posed model, which we call a tree-to-sequence at-
tentional NMT model.

In Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar
(HPSG) (Sag et al., 2003), a sentence is composed
of multiple phrase units and represented as a bi-
nary tree as shown in Figure 1. Following the
structure of the sentence, we construct a tree-based
encoder on top of the standard sequential encoder.
The k-th parent hidden unit h(phr)
for the k-th
phrase is calculated using the left and right child
hidden units hl

k as follows:

k and hr

k

h(phr)

k

= ftree(hl

k, hr

k),

(10)

where ftree is a non-linear function.

We construct a tree-based encoder with LSTM
units, where each node in the binary tree is repre-
sented with an LSTM unit. When initializing the
leaf units of the tree-based encoder, we employ the
sequential LSTM units described in Section 2.1.
Each non-leaf node is also represented with an
LSTM unit, and we employ Tree-LSTM (Tai et
al., 2015) to calculate the LSTM unit of the par-
ent node which has two child LSTM units. The
∈ Rd×1 and the memory cell
hidden unit h(phr)
∈ Rd×1 for the k-th parent node are calcu-

Our proposed tree-based encoder is a natural
extension of the conventional sequential encoder,
since Tree-LSTM is a generalization of chain-
structured LSTM (Tai et al., 2015). Our encoder
differs from the original Tree-LSTM in the cal-
culation of the LSTM units for the leaf nodes.
The motivation is to construct the phrase nodes in
a context-sensitive way, which, for example, al-
lows the model to compute different representa-
tions for multiple occurrences of the same word in
a sentence because the sequential LSTMs are cal-
culated in the context of the previous units. This
ability contrasts with the original Tree-LSTM, in
which the leaves are composed only of the word
embeddings without any contextual information.

Initial Decoder Setting

3.2
We now have two different sentence vectors: one
is from the sequence encoder and the other from
the tree-based encoder. As shown in Figure 3, we
provide another Tree-LSTM unit which has the ﬁ-
nal sequential encoder unit (hn) and the tree-based
encoder unit (h(phr)
root ) as two child units and set it
as the initial decoder s1 as follows:

s1 = gtree(hn, h(phr)
root ),

(12)

where gtree is the same function as ftree with an-
other set of Tree-LSTM parameters. This initial-
ization allows the decoder to capture information
from both the sequential data and phrase struc-
tures. Zoph and Knight (2016) proposed a simi-
lar method using a Tree-LSTM for initializing the

decoder, with which they translate multiple source
languages to one target language. When the syn-
tactic parser fails to output a parse tree for a sen-
tence, we encode the sentence with the sequential
encoder by setting h(phr)
root = 0. Our proposed tree-
based encoder therefore works with any sentences.

3.3 Attention Mechanism in Our Model
We adopt the attention mechanism into our tree-
to-sequence model in a novel way. Our model
gives attention not only to sequential hidden units
but also to phrase hidden units. This attention
mechanism tells us which words or phrases in the
source sentence are important when the model de-
codes a target word. The j-th context vector dj
is composed of the sequential and phrase vectors
weighted by the attention score αj(i):

adopt

input-feeding
method (Luong et al., 2015a) in our model, which
is a method for feeding ˜sj−1, the previous unit
to predict the word yj−1, into the current target
hidden unit sj,

the

sj = fdec(yj−1, [sj−1; ˜sj−1]),

(14)

where [sj−1; ˜sj−1] is the concatenation of sj−1
and ˜sj−1. The input-feeding approach contributes
to the enrichment in the calculation of the decoder,
because ˜sj−1 is an informative unit which can be
used to predict the output word as well as to be
compacted with attentional context vectors. Lu-
ong et al. (2015a) showed that the input-feeding
approach improves BLEU scores. We also ob-
served the same improvement in our preliminary
experiments.

3.4 Sampling-Based Approximation to the

NMT Models

The biggest computational bottleneck of train-
ing the NMT models is in the calculation of the
softmax layer described in Equation (8), because
its computational cost increases linearly with the
size of the vocabulary. The speedup technique
with GPUs has proven useful for sequence-based
NMT models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al.,

827

2015a) but it is not easily applicable when deal-
ing with tree-structured data. In order to reduce
the training cost of the NMT models at the soft-
max layer, we employ BlackOut (Ji et al., 2016), a
sampling-based approximation method. BlackOut
has been shown to be effective in RNN Language
Models (RNNLMs) and allows a model to run rea-
sonably fast even with a million word vocabulary
with CPUs.

At each word prediction step in the training,
BlackOut estimates the conditional probability in
Equation (2) for the target word and K neg-
ative samples using a weighted softmax func-
tion. The negative samples are drawn from the
unigram distribution raised to the power β ∈
[0, 1] (Mikolov et al., 2013). The unigram dis-
tribution is estimated using the training data and
β is a hyperparameter. BlackOut is closely re-
lated to Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) (Gut-
mann and Hyv¨arinen, 2012) and achieves better
perplexity than the original softmax and NCE in
RNNLMs. The advantages of Blackout over the
other methods are discussed in Ji et al. (2016).
Note that BlackOut can be used as the original
softmax once the training is ﬁnished.

4 Experiments

4.1 Training Data
We applied the proposed model to the English-to-
Japanese translation dataset of the ASPEC corpus
given in WAT’15.1 Following Zhu (2015), we ex-
tracted the ﬁrst 1.5 million translation pairs from
the training data. To obtain the phrase structures
of the source sentences, i.e., English, we used the
probabilistic HPSG parser Enju (Miyao and Tsu-
jii, 2008). We used Enju only to obtain a binary
phrase structure for each sentence and did not use
any HPSG speciﬁc information. For the target
language, i.e., Japanese, we used KyTea (Neubig
et al., 2011), a Japanese segmentation tool, and
performed the pre-processing steps recommended
in WAT’15.2 We then ﬁltered out the translation
pairs whose sentence lengths are longer than 50
and whose source sentences are not parsed suc-
cessfully. Table 1 shows the details of the datasets
used in our experiments. We carried out two ex-
periments on a small training dataset to investigate

a large training dataset to compare our proposed
methods with the other systems.

The vocabulary consists of words observed in
the training data more than or equal to N times.
We set N = 2 for the small training dataset and
N = 5 for the large training dataset. The out-of-
vocabulary words are mapped to the special token
“unk”. We added another special symbol “eos” for
both languages and inserted it at the end of all the
sentences. Table 2 shows the details of each train-
ing dataset and its corresponding vocabulary size.

4.2 Training Details

The biases,
softmax weights, and BlackOut
weights are initialized with zeros. The hyperpa-
rameter β of BlackOut is set to 0.4 as recom-
mended by Ji et al. (2016). Following J´ozefowicz
et al. (2015), we initialize the forget gate biases of
LSTM and Tree-LSTM with 1.0. The remaining
model parameters in the NMT models in our ex-
periments are uniformly initialized in [−0.1, 0.1].
The model parameters are optimized by plain SGD
with the mini-batch size of 128. The initial learn-
ing rate of SGD is 1.0. We halve the learning rate
when the development loss becomes worse. Gra-
dient norms are clipped to 3.0 to avoid exploding
gradient problems (Pascanu et al., 2012).

Small Training Dataset We conduct experi-
ments with our proposed model and the sequential
attentional NMT model with the input-feeding ap-
proach. Each model has 256-dimensional hidden
units and word embeddings. The number of nega-
tive samples K of BlackOut is set to 500 or 2000.

828

Large Training Dataset Our proposed model
has 512-dimensional word embeddings and d-
dimensional hidden units (d ∈ {512, 768, 1024}).
K is set to 2500.

Our code3 is implemented in C++ using the
Eigen library,4 a template library for linear alge-
bra, and we run all of the experiments on multi-
core CPUs.5 It takes about a week to train a model
on the large training dataset with d = 512.

4.3 Decoding process
We use beam search to decode a target sentence
for an input sentence x and calculate the sum
of the log-likelihoods of the target sentence y =
(y1,··· , ym) as the beam score:

score(x, y) =

log p(yj|y<j, x).

(15)

m∑

j=1

Decoding in the NMT models is a generative pro-
cess and depends on the target language model
given a source sentence. The score becomes
smaller as the target sentence becomes longer, and
thus the simple beam search does not work well
when decoding a long sentence (Cho et al., 2014a;
Pouget-Abadie et al., 2014).
In our preliminary
experiments, the beam search with the length nor-
malization in Cho et al. (2014a) was not effective
in English-to-Japanese translation. The method
in Pouget-Abadie et al. (2014) needs to estimate
the conditional probability p(x|y) using another
NMT model and thus is not suitable for our work.
In this paper, we use statistics on sentence
lengths in beam search. Assuming that the length
of a target sentence correlates with the length of
a source sentence, we redeﬁne the score of each
candidate as follows:

score(x, y) = Lx,y +

log p(yj|y<j, x),(16)

Lx,y = log p(len(y)|len(x)),

j=1

(17)

where Lx,y is the penalty for the conditional prob-
ability of the target sentence length len(y) given
the source sentence length len(x).
It allows
the model to decode a sentence by considering
the length of the target sentence.
In our exper-
iments, we computed the conditional probability

p(len(y)|len(x)) in advance following the statis-
tics collected in the ﬁrst one million pairs of the
training dataset. We allow the decoder to generate
up to 100 words.

4.4 Evaluation
We evaluated the models by two automatic eval-
uation metrics, RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010) and
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) following WAT’15.
We used the KyTea-based evaluation script for the
translation results.6 The RIBES score is a metric
based on rank correlation coefﬁcients with word
precision, and the BLEU score is based on n-gram
word precision and a Brevity Penalty (BP) for out-
puts shorter than the references. RIBES is known
to have stronger correlation with human judge-
ments than BLEU in translation between English
and Japanese as discussed in Isozaki et al. (2010).

5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Small Training Dataset
Table 3 shows the perplexity, BLEU, RIBES, and
the training time on the development data with the
Attentional NMT (ANMT) models trained on the
small dataset. We conducted the experiments with
our proposed method using BlackOut and soft-
max. We decoded a translation by our proposed
beam search with a beam size of 20.

As shown in Table 3, the results of our proposed
model with BlackOut improve as the number of
negative samples K increases. Although the result
of softmax is better than those of BlackOut (K =
500, 2000), the training time of softmax per epoch
is about three times longer than that of BlackOut
even with the small dataset.

As to the results of the ANMT model, reversing
the word order in the input sentence decreases the
scores in English-to-Japanese translation, which
contrasts with the results of other language pairs
reported in previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014;
Luong et al., 2015a). By taking syntactic infor-
mation into consideration, our proposed model
improves the scores, compared to the sequential
attention-based approach.

We found that better perplexity does not always
lead to better translation scores with BlackOut as
shown in Table 3. One of the possible reasons is
that BlackOut distorts the target word distribution

Effects of the proposed beam search Table 4
shows the results on the development data of pro-
posed method with BlackOut (K = 2000) by
the simple beam search and our proposed beam
search. The beam size is set to 6 or 20 in the sim-
ple beam search, and to 20 in our proposed search.
We can see that our proposed search outperforms
the simple beam search in both scores. Unlike
RIBES, the BLEU score is sensitive to the beam
size and becomes lower as the beam size increases.
We found that the BP had a relatively large im-
pact on the BLEU score in the simple beam search
as the beam size increased. Our search method
works better than the simple beam search by keep-
ing long sentences in the candidates with a large
beam size.

Effects of the sequential LSTM units We also
investigated the effects of the sequential LSTMs
at the leaf nodes in our proposed tree-based en-
coder. Table 5 shows the result on the develop-
ment data of our proposed encoder and that of an
attentional tree-based encoder without sequential
LSTMs with BlackOut (K = 2000).7 The results
show that our proposed encoder considerably out-

performs the encoder without sequential LSTMs,
suggesting that the sequential LSTMs at the leaf
nodes contribute to the context-aware construction
of the phrase representations in the tree.

5.2 Large Training Dataset
Table 6 shows the experimental results of RIBES
and BLEU scores achieved by the trained models
on the large dataset. We decoded the target sen-
tences by our proposed beam search with the beam
size of 20.8 The results of the other systems are the
ones reported in Nakazawa et al. (2015).

All of our proposed models show similar per-
formance regardless of the value of d. Our ensem-
ble model is composed of the three models with
d = 512, 768, and 1024, and it shows the best
RIBES score among all systems.9

As for the time required for training, our im-
plementation needs about one day to perform one
epoch on the large training dataset with d = 512.
It would take about 11 days without using the
BlackOut sampling.

Comparison with the NMT models The model
of Zhu (2015) is an ANMT model (Bahdanau et
al., 2015) with a bi-directional LSTM encoder,
and uses 1024-dimensional hidden units and 1000-

d = 512, and then we decoded it again with the beam size of
1000 following Zhu (2015).

Lavie, 2014) score of 53.6 with language option “-l other”.

dimensional word embeddings. The model of Lee
et al. (2015) is also an ANMT model with a bi-
directional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoder,
and uses 1000-dimensional hidden units and 200-
dimensional word embeddings. Both models are
sequential ANMT models. Our single proposed
model with d = 512 outperforms the best result of
Zhu (2015)’s end-to-end NMT model with ensem-
ble and unknown replacement by +1.19 RIBES
and by +0.17 BLEU scores. Our ensemble model
shows better performance,
in both RIBES and
BLEU scores, than that of Zhu (2015)’s best sys-
tem which is a hybrid of the ANMT and SMT
models by +1.54 RIBES and by +0.74 BLEU
scores and Lee et al. (2015)’s ANMT system
with special character-based decoding by +1.30
RIBES and +1.20 BLEU scores.
Comparison with the SMT models PB, HPB
and T2S are the baseline SMT systems in
WAT’15: a phrase-based model, a hierarchical
phrase-based model, and a tree-to-string model,
respectively (Nakazawa et al., 2015). The best
model in WAT’15 is Neubig et al. (2015)’s tree-
to-string SMT model enhanced with reranking by
ANMT using a bi-directional LSTM encoder. Our
proposed end-to-end NMT model compares favor-
ably with Neubig et al. (2015).

5.3 Qualitative Analysis
We illustrate the translations of test data by our
model with d = 512 and several attentional rela-
tions when decoding a sentence. In Figures 4 and
5, an English sentence represented as a binary tree
is translated into Japanese, and several attentional
relations between English words or phrases and

Figure 4: Translation example of a short sen-
tence and the attentional relations by our proposed
model.

Japanese word are shown with the highest atten-
tion score α. The additional attentional relations
are also illustrated for comparison. We can see the
target words softly aligned with source words and
phrases.

In Figure 4, the Japanese word “液晶” means
“liquid crystal”, and it has a high attention score
(α = 0.41) with the English phrase “liquid crystal
for active matrix”. This is because the j-th tar-
get hidden unit sj has the contextual information
about the previous words y<j including “活性 マ
トリックス の” (“for active matrix” in English).
The Japanese word “セル” is softly aligned with
the phrase “the cells” with the highest attention
score (α = 0.35). In Japanese, there is no deﬁ-
nite article like “the” in English, and it is usually
aligned with null described as Section 1.

In Figure 5, in the case of the Japanese word
“示” (“showed” in English), the attention score
with the English phrase “showed excellent perfor-
mance” (α = 0.25) is higher than that with the
English word “showed” (α = 0.01). The Japanese
word “の” (“of” in English) is softly aligned with
the phrase “of Si dot MOS capacitor” with the
highest attention score (α = 0.30). It is because
our attention mechanism takes each previous con-
text of the Japanese phrases “優れ た 性能” (“ex-
cellent performance” in English) and “Ｓｉ ドット
ＭＯＳ コンデンサ” (“Si dot MOS capacitor” in
English) into account and softly aligned the target
words with the whole phrase when translating the
English verb “showed” and the preposition “of”.
Our proposed model can thus ﬂexibly learn the at-
tentional relations between English and Japanese.
We observed that our model translated the word
“active” into “活性”, a synonym of the reference
word “アクティブ”. We also found similar exam-
ples in other sentences, where our model outputs

831

synonyms of the reference words, e.g. “女” and “
女性” (“female” in English) and “NASA” and “航
空宇宙局” (“National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration” in English). These translations are
penalized in terms of BLEU scores, but they do not
necessarily mean that the translations were wrong.
This point may be supported by the fact that the
NMT models were highly evaluated in WAT’15 by
crowd sourcing (Nakazawa et al., 2015).

6 Related Work
Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) were the ﬁrst
to propose an end-to-end NMT model using Con-
volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the source
encoder and using RNNs as the target decoder.
The Encoder-Decoder model can be seen as an ex-
tension of their model, and it replaces the CNNs
with RNNs using GRUs (Cho et al., 2014b) or
LSTMs (Sutskever et al., 2014).

Sutskever et al. (2014) have shown that mak-
ing the input sequences reversed is effective in a
French-to-English translation task, and the tech-
nique has also proven effective in translation tasks
between other European language pairs (Luong et
al., 2015a). All of the NMT models mentioned
above are based on sequential encoders. To incor-
porate structural information into the NMT mod-
els, Cho et al. (2014a) proposed to jointly learn
structures inherent in source-side languages but
did not report improvement of translation perfor-
mance. These studies motivated us to investigate
the role of syntactic structures explicitly given by
existing syntactic parsers in the NMT models.

The attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al.,
2015) has promoted NMT onto the next stage. It
enables the NMT models to translate while align-
ing the target with the source. Luong et al. (2015a)

reﬁned the attention model so that it can dynami-
cally focus on local windows rather than the entire
sentence. They also proposed a more effective at-
tentional path in the calculation of ANMT models.
Subsequently, several ANMT models have been
proposed (Cheng et al., 2016; Cohn et al., 2016);
however, each model is based on the existing se-
quential attentional models and does not focus on
a syntactic structure of languages.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel syntactic ap-
proach that extends attentional NMT models. We
focus on the phrase structure of the input sen-
tence and build a tree-based encoder following
the parsed tree. Our proposed tree-based encoder
is a natural extension of the sequential encoder
model, where the leaf units of the tree-LSTM
in the encoder can work together with the origi-
nal sequential LSTM encoder. Moreover, the at-
tention mechanism allows the tree-based encoder
to align not only the input words but also input
phrases with the output words. Experimental re-
sults on the WAT’15 English-to-Japanese transla-
tion dataset demonstrate that our proposed model
achieves the best RIBES score and outperforms
the sequential attentional NMT model.
