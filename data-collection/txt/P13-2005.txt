Abstract 

This paper proposes a technique to leverage 

topic based sentiments from Twitter to help 

predict the stock market. We first utilize a con-

tinuous Dirichlet Process Mixture model to 

learn the daily topic set. Then, for each topic 

we derive its sentiment according to its opin-

ion words distribution to build a sentiment 

time series. We then regress the stock index 

and the Twitter sentiment time series to predict 

the market. Experiments on real-life S&P100 

Index show that our approach is effective and 

performs better than existing state-of-the-art 

non-topic based methods. 

1 Introduction 

Social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, 

etc., have become ubiquitous platforms for social 

networking and content sharing. Every day, they 

generate a huge number of messages, which give 

researchers an unprecedented opportunity to uti-

lize the messages and the public opinions con-

tained in them for a wide range of applications 

(Liu, 2012). In this paper, we use them for the 

application of stock index time series analysis. 

Here are some example tweets upon querying 

the keyword “$aapl” (which is the stock symbol 

for Apple Inc.) in Twitter: 

1. “Shanghai Oriental Morning Post confirm-

ing w Sources that $AAPL TV will debut 

in May, Prices range from $1600-$3200, 

but $32,000 for a 50"wow.” 

2. “$AAPL permanently lost its bid for a ban 

on U.S. sales of the Samsung Galaxy Nex-

us http://dthin.gs/XqcY74.” 

3. “$AAPL is loosing customers. everybody is 

buying android phones! $GOOG.” 

As shown, the retrieved tweets may talk about 

Apple’s products, Apple’s competition relation-

ship with other companies, etc. These messages 

are often related to people’s sentiments about 

Apple Inc., which can affect or reflect its stock 

trading since positive sentiments can impact 

sales and financial gains. Naturally, this hints 

that topic based sentiment is a useful factor to 

consider for stock prediction as they reflect peo-

ple’s sentiment on different topics in a certain 

time frame. 

This paper focuses on daily one-day-ahead 

prediction of stock index based on the temporal 

characteristics of topics in Twitter in the recent 

past. Specifically, we propose a non-parametric 

topic-based sentiment time series approach to 

analyzing the streaming Twitter data. The key 

motivation here is that Twitter’s streaming mes-

sages reflect fresh sentiments of people which 

are likely to be correlated with stocks in a short 

time frame. We also analyze the effect of training 

window size which best fits the temporal dynam-

ics of stocks. Here window size refers to the 

number of days of tweets used in model building. 

Our final prediction model is built using vec-

tor autoregression (VAR). To our knowledge, 

this is the first attempt to use non-parametric 

continuous topic based Twitter sentiments for 

stock prediction in an autoregressive framework.

2.1 Market Prediction and Social Media 

Stock market prediction has attracted a great deal 

of attention in the past. Some recent researches 

suggest that news and social media such as blogs, 

micro-blogs, etc., can be analyzed to extract pub-

lic sentiments to help predict the market (La-

vrenko et al., 2000; Schumaker and Chen, 2009). 

Bollen et al. (2011) used tweet based public 

mood to predict the movement of Dow Jones 
*   The work was done when the first author was visiting 

University of Illinois at Chicago.

Industrial Average index. Ruiz et al. (2012) stud-

ied the relationship between Twitter activities 

and stock market under a graph based view. 

Feldman et al. (2011) introduced a hybrid ap-

proach for stock sentiment analysis based on 

companies’ news articles.  

2.2 Aspect and Sentiment Models 

Topic modeling as a task of corpus exploration 

has attracted significant attention in recent years. 

One of the basic and most widely used models is 

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 

2003). LDA can learn a predefined number of 

topics and has been widely applied in its extend-

ed forms in sentiment analysis and many other 

tasks (Mei et al., 2007; Branavan et al., 2008; Lin 

and He, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Wang et al., 

2010; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; 

Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Sauper et al., 2011; 

Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; He et al., 2012).  

The Dirichlet Processes Mixture (DPM) model 

is a non-parametric extension of LDA (Teh et al., 

2006), which can estimate the number of topics 

inherent in the data itself. In this work, we em-

ploy topic based sentiment analysis using DPM 

on Twitter posts (or tweets). First, we employ a 

DPM to estimate the number of topics in the 

streaming snapshot of tweets in each day.  

Next, we build a sentiment time series based 

on the estimated topics of daily tweets. Lastly, 

we regress the stock index and the sentiment 

time series in an autoregressive framework. 

3 Model 

We now present our stock prediction framework. 

3.1 Continuous DPM Model 

Comparing to edited articles, it is much harder to 

preset the number of topics to best fit continuous 

streaming Twitter data due to the large topic di-

versity in tweets. Thus, we resort to a non-

parametric approach: the Dirichlet Process Mix-

ture (DPM) model, and let the model estimate the 

number of topics inherent in the data itself. 

Mixture model is widely used in clustering and 

can be formalized as follows: 

   ∑      (       )
 
              (1) 

where    is a data point,    is its cluster label, K 
is the number of topics,  (       ) is the sta-
tistical (topic) models: *  +   

  and     is the 
component weight satisfying      and  
∑      . 

In our setting of DPM, the number of mixture 

components (topics) K is unfixed apriori but es-

timated from tweets in each day. DPM is defined 

as in (Neal, 2010): 

                 (  )  
               

           (   )                 (2) 

where    is the parameter of the model that      
belongs to, and   is defined as a Dirichlet Pro-
cess with the base measure H and the concentra-
tion parameter   (Neal, 2010). 

We note that neighboring days may share the 

same or closely related topics because some top-

ics may last for a long period of time covering 

multiple days, while other topics may just last for 

a short period of time. Given a set of time-

stamped tweets, the overall generative process 

should be dynamic as the topics evolve over time. 

There are several ways to model this dynamic 

nature (Sun et al., 2010; Kim and Oh, 2011; 

Chua and Asur, 2012; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; 

Wang et al., 2008). In this paper, we follow the 

approach of Sun et al. (2010) due to its generality 

and extensibility. 

Figure 1 shows the graphical model of our con-

tinuous version of DPM (which we call cDPM). 

As shown, the tweets set is divided into daily 

based collections: *         +  *    +   
     are the 

observed tweets and *    +   
     are the model pa-

rameters (latent topics) that generate these tweets. 

For each subset of tweets,    (tweets of day  ), 
we build a DPM on it. For the first day (   ), 
the model functions the same as a standard DPM, 

i.e., all the topics use the same base measure, 

      ( ). However, for later days (   ), 
besides the base measure,       ( ), we make 
use of topics learned from previous days as pri-

ors. This ensures smooth topic chains or links 

(details in §3.2). For efficiency, we only consider 

topics of one previous day as priors. 

We use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Bishop, 

2006) for model inference. Hyper-parameters are 

set to:              ;       as in 
(Sun et al., 2010; Teh et al., 2006) which have 

been shown to work well. Because a tweet has at 

most 140 characters, we assume that each tweet 

contains only one topic. Hence, we only need to

sample the topic assignment    for each tweet   . 
According to different situations with respect 

to a topic’s prior, for each tweet    in   , the 
conditional distribution for    given all other 
tweets’ topic assignments, denoted by    , can be 
summarized as follows: 

1.    is a new topic: Its candidate priors contain 
the symmetric base prior    ( )  and topics 

*      +   
     learned from            .  

 If    takes a symmetric base prior: 

 (     
           )   

 

     

 (    )

 (       )

∏  (      )
   
   

∏  ( )
   
   

           (3) 

where the first part denotes the prior proba-

bility according to the Dirichlet Process and 

the second part is the data likelihood (this 

interpretation can similarly be applied to the 

following three equations).  

 If    takes one topic k from *      +   
     as 

its prior: 

 (      
            )    

 
        

     

 (    )

 (       )

∏  (          ( )     )
   
   

∏  (          ( ))
   
   

 (4) 

2. k is an existing topic: We already know its 
prior. 

 If k takes a symmetric base prior: 

  (               )   

 
  
  

     

 (        ( )

∏  (

Notations in the above equations are listed as 

follows: 

      is the number of topics learned in day t-1. 
 |V| is the vocabulary size. 

    is the document length of   . 
      is the term frequency of word   in   . 
       ( ) is the probability of word   in pre-

vious day’s topic k.  

   
   is the number of tweets assigned to topic k 

excluding the current one   .  

     
   is the term frequency of word   in topic k, 

with statistic from    excluded. While    ( )
   

denotes the marginalized sum of all words in 

topic k with statistic from    excluded. 
Similarly, the posteriors on *    ( )+  (topic 
word distributions) are given according to their 

prior situations as follows: 

 If topic k takes the base prior: 

           ( )   (      ) (         ( )) ⁄     (7) 

where      is the frequency of word   in topic 

k and    ( )  is the marginalized sum over all 
words. 

 otherwise, it is defined recursively as: 

    ( )  (          ( )      ) (         ( ))⁄  (8) 

where        serves as the topic prior for     . 

Finally, for each day we estimate the topic 

weights,    as follows:  

        ∑      ⁄                              (9) 

where    is the number of tweets in topic k. 

3.2 Topic-based Sentiment Time Series 

Based on an opinion lexicon   (a list of positive 
and negative opinion words, e.g., good and bad), 

each opinion word,     is assigned with a po-
larity label  ( ) as “+1” if it is positive and “-1” 
if negative. We spilt each tweet’s text into opin-

ion part and non-opinion part. Only non-opinion 

words in tweets are used for Gibbs sampling. 

Based on DPM, we learn a set of topics from 

the non-opinion words space  . The correspond-
ing tweets’ opinion words share the same topic 

assignments as its tweet. Then, we compute the 

posterior on opinion word probability,     
 ( ) 

for topic   analogously to equations (7) and (8). 
Finally, we define the topic based sentiment 

score  (   ) of topic   in day t as a weighted 
linear combination of the opinion polarity labels: 

 (   )   ∑     
 ( )

   
    ( );  (   )   ,    -    (10) 

According to the generative process of cDPM, 

topics between neighboring days are linked if a 

topic k takes another topic as its prior. We regard 

this as evolution of topic k. Although there may 

be slight semantic variation, the assumption is 

reasonable. Then, the sentiment scores for each 

topic series form the sentiment time series {…, 

S(t-1, k), S(t, k), S(t+1, k), ...}. 

Figure 2 demonstrates the linking process 

where a triangle denotes a new topic (with base 

symmetric prior), a circle denotes a middle topic 

(taking a topic from the previous day as its prior, 

 

 

 

 
           0      …       t-1          t         t+1    …    N

while also supplying prior for the next day) and 

an ellipse denotes an end topic (no further topics 

use it as a prior). In this example, two continuous 

topic chains or links (via linked priors) exist for 

the time interval [t-1, t+1]: one in light grey color, 

and the other in black. As shown, there may be 

more than one topic chain/link (5-20 in our ex-

periments) for a certain time interval
1
.Thus, we 

sort multiple sentiment series according to their 

accumulative weights of topics over each link: 

∑     
  
    

. In our experiments, we try the top 

five series and use the one that gives the best re-

sult, which is mostly the first (top ranked) series 

with a few exceptions of the second series. The 

topics mostly focus on hot keywords like: news, 

stocknews, earning, report, which stimulate ac-

tive discussions on the social media platform. 

3.3 Time Series Analysis with VAR 

For model building, we use vector autoregression 

(VAR). The first order (time steps of historical 

information to use: lag = 1) VAR model for two 

time series *  + and *  + is given by:  

                                                   
                                               (11) 

where * + are the white noises and * + are model 
parameters. We use the “dse” library

2
 in the R 

language to fit our VAR model based on least 

square regression. 

 Instead of training in one period and predicting 

over another disjointed period, we use a moving 

training and prediction process under sliding 

windows
3
 (i.e., train in [t, t + w] and predict in-

dex on t + w + 1) with two main considerations: 

 Due to the dynamic and random nature of both 
the stock market and public sentiments, we are 

more interested in their short term relationship. 

 Based on the sliding windows, we have more 
training and testing points.  

Figure 3 details the algorithm for stock index 

prediction. The accuracy is computed based on 

the index up and down dynamics, the function 

     (    ) returns True only if   (our predic-
tion) and   (actual value) share the same index 
up or down direction. 

 

 

                                                 
1 The actual topic priors for topic links are governed by the 

four cases of the Gibbs Sampler. 
2 http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dse 
3  This is similar to the autoregressive moving average 

(ARMA) models. 

4 Dataset 

We collected the tweets via Twitter’s REST API 

for streaming data, using symbols of the Stand-

ard & Poor's 100 stocks (S&P100) as keywords. 

In this study, we focus only on predicting the 

S&P100 index. The time period of our dataset is 

between Nov. 2, 2012 and Feb. 7, 2013, which 

gave us 624782 tweets. We obtained the S&P100 

index’s daily close values from Yahoo Finance. 

5 Experiment 

5.1 Selecting a Sentiment Metric 

Bollen et al. (2011) used the mood dimension, 

Calm together with the index value itself to pre-

dict the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, 

their Calm lexicon is not publicly available. We 

thus are unable to perform a direct comparison 

with their system. We identified and labeled a 

Calm lexicon (words like “anxious”, “shocked”, 

“settled” and “dormant”) using the opinion lexi-

con
4
 of Hu and Liu (2004) and computed the sen-

timent score using the method of Bollen et al. 

(2011) (sentiment ratio). Our pilot experiments 

showed that using the full opinion lexicon of Hu 

and Liu (2004) actually performs consistently 

better than the Calm lexicon. Hence, we use the 

entire opinion lexicon in Hu and Liu (2004). 

5.2 S&P100INDEX Movement Prediction 

We evaluate the performance of our method by 

comparing with two baselines. The first (Index) 

uses only the index itself, which reduces the 

VAR model to the univariate autoregressive 

model (AR), resulting in only one index time 

series {  } in the algorithm of Figure 3.

 When considering Twitter sentiments, existing 

works (Bollen et al., 2011, Ruiz et al., 2012) 

simply compute the sentiment score as ratio of 

pos/neg opinion words per day. This generates a 

lexicon-based sentiment time series, which is 

then combined with the index value series to give 

us the second baseline Raw.  

 In summary, Index uses index only with the 

AR model while Raw uses index and opinion 

lexicon based time series. Our cDPM uses index 

and the proposed topic based sentiment time se-

ries. Both Raw and cDPM employ the two di-

mensional VAR model. We experiment with dif-

ferent lag settings from 1-3 days. 

 We also experiment with different training 

window sizes, ranging from 15 - 30 days, and 

compute the prediction accuracy for each win-

dow size. Table 1 shows the respective average 

and best accuracies over all window sizes for 

each lag and Table 2 summarizes the pairwise 

performance improvements of averaged scores 

over all training window sizes. Figure 4 show the 

detailed accuracy comparison for lag 1 and lag 3.  

    From Table 1, 2, and Figure 4, we note: 

i. Topic-based public sentiments from tweets 
can improve stock prediction over simple sen-
timent ratio which may suffer from backchan-
nel noise and lack of focus on prevailing top-
ics. For example, on lag 2, Raw performs 
worse by 8.6% than Index itself. 

ii. cDPM outperforms all others in terms of both 
the best accuracy (lag 3) and the average ac-
curacies for different window sizes. The max-
imum average improvement reaches 25.0% 
compared to Index at lag 1 and 15.1% com-
pared to Raw at lag 3. This is due to the fact 
that cDPM learns the topic based sentiments 
instead of just using the opinion words’ ratio 
like Raw, and in a short time period, some 
topics are more correlated with the stock mar-

ket than others. Our proposed sentiment time 
series using cDPM can capture this phenome-
non and also help reduce backchannel noise 
of raw sentiments.  

iii. On average, cDPM gets the best performance 
for training window sizes within [21, 22], and 
the best prediction accuracy is 68.0% on win-
dow size 22 at lag 3. 

6 Conclusions 

Predicting the stock market is an important but 

difficult problem. This paper showed that Twit-

ter’s topic based sentiment can improve the pre-

diction accuracy beyond existing non-topic based 

approaches. Specifically, a non-parametric topic-

based sentiment time series approach was pro-

posed for the Twitter stream. For prediction, vec-

tor autoregression was used to regress S&P100 

index with the learned sentiment time series. Be-

sides the short term dynamics based prediction, 

we believe that the proposed method can be ex-

tended for long range dependency analysis of 

Twitter sentiments and stocks, which can render 

deep insights into the complex phenomenon of 

stock market. This will be part of our future work.
