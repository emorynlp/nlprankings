Abstract

Readers suffering from information overload
have often turned to collections of pithy and
famous quotations. While research on large-
scale analysis of text reuse has found effective
methods for detecting widely disseminated
and famous quotations, this paper explores the
complementary problem of detecting, from
internal evidence alone, which phrases are
quotable. These quotable phrases are mem-
orable and succinct statements that people are
likely to find useful outside of their original
context. We evaluate quotable phrase extrac-
tion using a large digital library and demon-
strate that an integration of lexical and shallow
syntactic features results in a reliable extrac-
tion process. A study using a reddit commu-
nity of quote enthusiasts as well as a simple
corpus analysis further demonstrate the prac-
tical applications of our work.

1 Introduction

Readers have been anxious about information over-
load for a long time: not only since the rise of the
web, but with the earlier explosion of printed books,
and even in manuscript culture (Blair, 2010). One
traditional response to the problem has been ex-
cerpting passages that might be useful outside their
original sources, copying them into personal com-
monplace books, and publishing them in dictionaries
such as Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations or the Oxford

∗ “The book is a dictionary of wisdom and wit...” (Samuel
Smiles, “A Publisher and His Friends”) This and all the subse-
quent quotations in this paper were discovered by the proposed
quotable phrase extraction process.

Dictionary of Quotations. Even on the web, collec-
tion of quotable phrases continues to thrive1, as evi-
denced by the popularity of quotation websites such
as BrainyQuote and Wikiquote.

According to a recent estimate, there are close
to 130 million unique book records in world li-
braries today (Taycher, 2010). Many of these
books are being digitized and stored by commercial
providers (e.g., Google Books and Amazon), as well
as non-profit organizations (e.g., Internet Archive
and Project Gutenberg).

As a result of this digitization, the development
of new methods for preserving, accessing and ana-
lyzing the contents of literary corpora becomes an
important research venue with many practical appli-
cations (Michel et al., 2011). One particularly in-
teresting line of work in these large digital libraries
has focused on detecting text reuse, i.e., passages
from one source that are quoted in another (Kolak
and Schilit, 2008).

In contrast, in this paper we explore the modeling
of phrases that are likely to be quoted. This phrase
modeling is done based on internal evidence alone,
regardless of whether or not the phrase actually is
quoted in existing texts.

We call such potential quotation a quotable
phrase – a meaningful, memorable, and succinct
statement that can be quoted without its original
context. This kind of phrases includes aphorisms,
epigrams, maxims, proverbs, and epigraphs.

dom in epigram and dissertation, but it is a trifle tedious to
hear another person display theirs.” (Kate Sanborn, “The Wit
of Women”)

A computational approach to quotable phrase ex-
traction has several practical applications. For in-
stance, it can be used to recommend new additions to
existing quotable phrase collections, especially fo-
cusing on lesser read and studied authors and liter-
ary works2. It can also generate quotable phrases
that will serve as catchy and entertaining previews
for book promotion and advertisement3 .

In this work, we describe such a computational
approach to quotable phrase extraction. Our ap-
proach leverages the Project Gutenberg digital li-
brary and an online collection of quotations to build
a quotable language model. This language model
is further refined by a supervised learning algorithm
that combines lexical and shallow syntactic features.

In addition, we demonstrate that a computational
approach can help to address some intriguing ques-
tions about the nature of quotability. What are the
lexical and the syntactic features that govern the
quotability of a phrase? Which authors and books
are highly quotable? How much variance is there in
the perceived quotability of a given phrase?

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we provide a detailed description
of the entire process of quotable phrase extraction.
In Section 3 we review the related work. In Sections
4 and 5 we evaluate the quotable phrase extraction
process, and provide some corpus quotability analy-
sis. We conclude the paper in Section 6.

2 Quotable Phrase Extraction

There are three unique challenges that need to be
addressed in the design of the process of quotable

2“There is life in a poet so long as he is quoted...” (Sir Alfred
Comyn Lyall, “Studies in Literature and History”)

3As an example, see the “Popular Highlights” feature for
Kindle e-books in the Amazon bookstore.

phrase extraction. The first challenge stems from the
fact that the boundaries of potential quotes are often
ambiguous. A quotable phrase can consist of a sen-
tence fragment, a complete sentence, or a passage of
text that spans several sentences.

The second challenge is that the occurrence of
quotable phrases is a rare phenomena in literary cor-
pora. A randomly selected book passage is unlikely
to be quotable without any additional context.

The third challenge is related to the syntax and se-
mantics of quotable phrases. For instance, consider
the phrase

“Evil men make evil use of the law, though
the law is good, while good men die well, al-
though death is an evil.” (Thomas Aquinas,
“Summa Theologica”)

and contrast it with

“Of the laws that he can see, the great se-
quences of life to death, of evil to sorrow,
of goodness to happiness, he tells in burning
words.” (Henry Fielding, “The Soul of a Peo-
ple”)

While both of these phrases share a common vocab-
ulary (law, death, good and evil), the latter sentence
contains unresolved pronouns (he, twice) that make
it less amenable to quotation out of context.

Accordingly, we design a three-stage quotable
phrase extraction process, with each stage corre-
sponding to one of challenges described above. The
diagram in Figure 1 provides a high-level overview
of the entire extraction process on a single book.
Next, we provide a brief description of this diagram.
Then, in the following sections, we focus on individ-
ual stages of the extraction process.

To address the first challenge of quote boundary
detection, at the first stage of the extraction process

70



(Sentence Segmentation) we segment the text of the
input book into sentences using an implementation
of the Punkt sentence boundary detection algorithm
(Kiss and Strunk, 2006). In an initial experiment, we
found that 78% of the approximately 4,000 quota-
tions collected from the QuotationsPage4 consist of
a single sentence. From now on, therefore, we make
a simplifying assumption that an extracted quotable
phrase is confined within the sentence boundaries.

The second processing stage (Naı̈ve Bayes Filter-
ing) aims to address the second challenge (the rar-
ity of quotable phrases) and significantly increases
the ratio of quotable phrases that are considered as
candidates in the final processing stage (Quotable
Phrase Detection). To this end, we use a set of quo-
tations collected from an external resource to build a
quotable language model. Only sentences that have
a sufficiently high likelihood of being drawn from
this language model are considered at the final pro-
cessing stage.

For this final processing stage (Quotable Phrase
Detection), we develop a supervised algorithm that
focuses on the third challenge, and analyzes the syn-
tactic structure of the input sentences. This super-
vised algorithm makes use of structural and syntac-
tic features that may effect phrase quotability, in ad-
dition to the vocabulary of the phrase.

2.1 Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering

In order to account for the rarity of quotable phrases
in the book corpus, we use a filtering approach based
on a pre-built quotable language model. Using this
filtering approach, we significantly reduce the num-
ber of sentences that need to be considered in the su-
pervised quotable phrase detection stage (described
in Section 2.2). In addition, this approach increases
the ratio of quotable phrases considered at the super-
vised stage, addressing the problem of the sparsity of
positive examples.

To build the quotable language model, we boot-
strap the existing quotation collections on the web.
In particular, we collect approximately 4,000 quotes
on more than 200 subjects from the QuotationsPage.
This collection provides a diverse set of high-quality
quotations on subjects ranging from Laziness and
Genius to Technology and Taxes.

4www.quotationspage.com

Then, we build two separate unigram language
models. The first one is the quotable language
model, which is built using the collected quotations
(LQ). The second one is the background language
model, which is built using the entire book corpus
(LC). Using these language models we compute a
log-likelihood ratio for each processed sentence s,
as

LLRs =
∑

w∈s

ln
p(w|LQ)

p(w|LC)
, (1)

where the probabilities p(w|·) are computed using a
maximum likelihood estimate with add-one smooth-
ing.

A sentence s is allowed to pass the filtering stage
if and only if LLRs ∈ [α, β], where α, β are posi-
tive constants5. The lower bound on the LLRs, α,
requires the sentence to be highly probable given the
quotable language model LQ. The upper bound on
the LLRs, β, filters out sentences that are highly im-
probable given the background language model LC .

Finally, the sentences for which LLRs ∈ [α, β]
are allowed to pass through the Naı̈ve Bayes filter.
They are forwarded to the next stage, in which a su-
pervised quotable phrase detection is performed.

2.2 Supervised Quotable Phrase Detection

In a large corpus, a supervised quotable phrase de-
tection method needs to handle a significant num-
ber of input instances (in our corpus, an average-
sized book contains approximately 2,000 sentences).
Therefore, we make use of a simple and efficient
perceptron algorithm, which is implemented follow-
ing the description by Bishop (2006).

We note, however, that the proposed supervised
detection method can be also implemented using a
variety of other binary prediction techniques. In
an initial experiment, we found that more complex
methods (e.g., decision trees) were comparable to or
worse than the simple perceptron algorithm.

Formally, we define a binary function f(s) which
determines whether an input sentence s is a quotable
(q) or a non-quotable (q) phrase, based on:

f(s) =

{

q if wxs > 0
q else,

5In this work, we set α = 1, β = 25. This setting is done
prior to seeing any labeled data.

Feature Description
Lexical

LLR Sentence log-likelihood ratio (Eq. 1)
#word Number of words in s.
#char Number of characters in s.
wordLenAgg Feature for each aggregate Agg of word length in s.

Agg = {min, max, mean}
#capital Number of capitalized words in s.
#quantifier Number of universal quantifiers in s (from a list of 13 quantifiers, e.g., all, whole, nobody).
#stops Number of common stopwords in s.
beginStop True if s begins with a stopword, False otherwise.
hasDialog True if s contains at least one of the three common dialog terms {say, says, said}.
#abstract Number of abstract concepts (e.g., adventure, charity, stupidity ) in s.

Punctuation
hasP Five features to indicate whether punctuation of type P is present in s.

P = {quotations, parentheses, colon, dash, semi-colon}.
Parts of Speech

#POS Four features for the number of occurrences of part-of-speech POS in s.
POS = {noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun}.

hasComp True if s contains a comparative adjective or adverb, False otherwise.
hasSuper True if s contains a superlative adjective or adverb, False otherwise.
hasPP True if s contains a verb in past participle, False otherwise.
#IGSeq[i] Count of the POS sequence with the i-th highest IG(X, Y ) (Eq. 3) in s.

Table 1: Description of the quotability features that are computed for each sentence s .

where xs is a vector of quotability features com-
puted for the sentence s, and w is a weight vector
associated with these features. The weight vector w
is updated using stochastic gradient descent on the
perceptron error function (Bishop, 2006).

Since Eq. 2 demonstrates that the supervised
quotable phrase detection can be formulated as a
standard binary classification problem, its success
will be largely determined by an appropriate choice
of feature vector xs. As we are unaware of any
previous work on supervised detection of quotable
phrases, we develop an initial set of easy-to-compute
features that considers the lexical and shallow syn-
tactic structure of the analyzed sentence.

2.3 Quotability Features

A decision about phrase quotability is often sub-
jective; it is strongly influenced by personal taste
and circumstances6 . Therefore, the set of features
that we describe in this section is merely a coarse-
grained approximation of the true intrinsic qualities
of a quotable phrase. Nevertheless, it is important to

6“One man’s beauty another’s ugliness; one man’s wisdom
another’s folly.” (Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Essays”)

note that these features do prove to be beneficial in
the context of the quote detection task, as is demon-
strated by our empirical evaluation in Section 5.

Table 1 details the quotability features, which are
divided into 3 groups: lexical, punctuation-based
and POS-based features. All of these features are
conceptually simple and can be efficiently computed
even for a large number of input sentences.

Some of these features are inspired by existing
text analysis tasks. For instance, work on readabil-
ity detection for the web (Kanungo and Orr, 2009;
Si and Callan, 2001) examined features which are
similar to the lexical features in Table 1. Parts of
speech features (e.g., the presence of comparative
and superlative adjectives and adverbs) have been
extensively used for sentiment analysis and opinion
mining (Pang and Lee, 2008).

In addition, we use a number of features based on
simple hand-crafted word lists. These lists include
word categories that could be potential indicators of
quotable phrases such as universal quantifiers (e.g.,
all, everyone) and abstract concepts7.

7For abstract concept modeling we use a list of 176 abstract
nouns available at www.englishbanana.com.

72



The novel features in Table 1 that are specifically
designed for quotable phrase detection are based on
part of speech sequences that are highly indicative
of quotable (or, conversely, non-quotable) phrase
(features #IGSeq[i]). In order to compute these
features we first manually label a validation set of
500 sentences that passed the Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering
(Section 2.1). Then, we apply a POS tagger to these
sentences, and for each POS tag sequence of length
n, seqn, we compute its information gain

IG(X,Y ) = H(X) −H(X|Y ). (3)

In Eq. 3, X is a binary variable indicating the pres-
ence or the absence of seqn in the sentence, and
Y ∈ {q, q}.

We select k sequences seqn with the highest value
of IG(X,Y )8. We use the count in the sentence of
the sequence seqn with the i-th highest information
gain as the feature #IGSeq[i]. Intuitively, the fea-
tures #IGSeq[i] measure how many POS tag se-
quences that are indicative of a quotable phrase (or,
conversely, indicative of a non-quotable phrase) the
sentence contains.

3 Related Work

The increasing availability of large-scale digital li-
braries resulted in a recent surge of interest in com-
putational approaches to literary analysis. To name
just a few examples, Genzel et al. (2010) examined
machine translation of poetry; Elson et al. (2010)
extracted conversational networks from Victorian
novels; and Faruqui and Padó (2011) predicted for-
mal and informal address in English literature.

In addition, computational methods are increas-
ingly used for identification of complex aspects
of writing such as humor (Mihalcea and Pulman,
2007), double-entendre (Kiddon and Brun, 2011)
and sarcasm (Tsur et al., 2010). However, while
successful, most of this work is still limited to an
analysis of a single aspect of writing style.

In this work, we propose a more general compu-
tational approach that attempts to extract quotable
phrases. A quotability of a phrase can be affected
by various aspects of writing including (but not lim-

ited to) humor and irony9, use of metaphors10 , and
hyperbole11 .

It is important to note that our approach is con-
ceptually different from the previous work on para-
phrase and quote detection in book corpora (Kolak
and Schilit, 2008), news stories (Liang et al., 2010)
and movie scripts (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.,
2012). While this previous work focuses on mining
popular and oft-used quotations, we are mainly in-
terested in discovering quotable phrases that might
have never been quoted by others.

4 Experimental Setup

To evaluate the quotable phrase extraction process
in its entirety (see Figure 1), we use a collection of
Project Gutenberg (PG) books12 – a popular digital
library containing full texts of public domain books
in a variety of formats. In particular, we harvest the
entire corpus of 21,492 English books in textual for-
mat from the PG website.

The breakdown of the PG corpus is shown in Ta-
ble 2. The number of detected sentences in the PG
corpus exceeds 44 million. Roughly a third of these
sentences are able to pass through the Naı̈ve Bayes
Filtering (described in Section 2.1) to the supervised
quotable phrase detection stage (Section 2.2).

For each of these sentences, we compute a set of
lexical and syntactic features described in Section
2.3. For computing the features that require the part
of speech tags, we use the MontyLingua package
(Liu, 2004).

5 Evaluation and Analysis

5.1 Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering Evaluation

In the Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering stage (see Section 2.1)
we evaluate two criteria. First, we measure its abil-
ity to reduce the number of sentences that pass to the
supervised quotable phrase detection stage. As Ta-
ble 2 shows, the Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering reduces the
number of these sentences by more than 60%.

Second, we evaluate the recall of the Naı̈ve Bayes
Filtering. We are primarily interested in its ability
to reliably detect quotable phrases and pass them
through to the next stage, while still reducing the
total number of sentences.

For recall evaluation, we collect a set of
2, 817 previously unseen quotable phrases from the
Goodreads website13, and run them through the
Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering stage. 2, 262 (80%) of the
quotable phrases pass the filter, indicating a high
quotable phrase recall.

Table 3: Top quotability features.

Based on these findings, we conclude that the pro-
posed Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering is able to reliably detect
quotable phrases, while filtering out a large number
of non-quotable ones. It can be further calibrated to
reduce the number of non-quotable sentences or to
increase the quotable phrase recall, by changing the
setting of the parameters α and β, described in Sec-
tion 2.1. In the remainder of this section, we use its
output to analyze the performance of the supervised
quotable phrase detection stage.

5.2 Quotable Phrase Detection Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the supervised
quotable phrase detection stage (see Section 2.2) we
randomly sample 1,500 sentences that passed the
Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering (this sample is disjoint from
the sample of 500 sentences used for computing
the IGTagSeq feature in Section 2.3). We anno-
tate these sentences with q (Quotable) and q (Non-
Quotable) labels.

Of these sentences, 381 (25%) are labeled as
Quotable. This ratio of quotable phrases is much
higher than what is expected from a non-filtered con-
tent of a book, which provides an indication that the
Naı̈ve Bayes Filtering provides a relatively balanced
input to the supervised detection stage.

We use this random sample of 1,500 labeled sen-
tences to train a perceptron algorithm (as described
in Section 2.2) using 10-fold cross-validation. We
train two variants of the perceptron. The first variant
is trained using only the lexical features in Table 1,
while the second variant uses all the features.

Figure 2 compares the precision-recall curves of
these two variants. It demonstrates that using the
syntactic features based on punctuation and part of
speech tags significantly improves the precision of

quote phrase detection at all recall levels. For in-
stance at the 0.4 recall level, it can improve precision
by almost 25%.

Figure 2 also shows that the proposed method
is reliable for high-precision quotable phrase de-
tection. This is especially important for applica-
tions where recall is given less consideration, such
as book preview using quotable phrases. The pro-
posed method reaches a precision of 0.7 at the 0.1
recall level.

It is also interesting to examine the importance of
different features for the quotable phrase detection.
Table 3 shows the ten highest-weighted features, as
learned by the perceptron algorithm on the entire set
of 1,500 labeled examples.

The part of speech features #IGTagSeq[i] oc-
cupy three of the positions in the Table 3. It is inter-
esting to note that two of them have a high negative
weight. In other words, some of the POS sequences
that have the highest information gain (see Eq. 3)
are sequences that are indicative of non-quotable
phrases, rather than quotable phrases.

The two highest-weighted features are based
on handcrafted word lists (#abstract and
#quantifier, respectively). This demonstrates
the importance of task-specific features such as
these for quotability detection.

Finally, the presence of different parts of speech
in the phrase (nouns, verbs and adjectives), as well
as their verb tenses, are important features. For
instance, the presence of a verb in past participle
(hasPP) is a strong negative indicator of phrase
quotability.

5.3 The reddit Study

As mentioned in Section 2.3, the degree of the
phrase quotability is often subjective, and therefore
its estimation may vary among individuals. To val-
idate that our quotability detection method is not
biased by our training data, and that the detected
quotes will have a universal appeal, we set up a veri-

fication study that leverages an online community of
quote enthusiasts.

For our study, we use reddit, a social content web-
site where the registered users submit content, in the
form of either a link or a text post. Other regis-
tered users then upvote or downvote the submission,
which is used to rank the post.

Specifically, we use the Quotes subreddit14, an ac-
tive reddit community devoted to discovering and
sharing quotable phrases. At the time of this writ-
ing, the Quotes subreddit has more than 12,000 sub-
scribers. A typical post to this subreddit contains a
single quotable phrase with attribution. Any reddit
user can then upvote or downvote the quote based on
its perceived merit.

To validate the quality of the quotes which were
used for training the perceptron algorithm, we sub-
mitted 60 quotes, which were labeled as quotable by
one of the authors, to the Quotes subreddit. At most
one quote per day was submitted, to avoid negative
feedback from the community for “spamming”.

Table 4 presents the upvote scores of the submit-
ted quotes. An upvote score, denoted ⇑, is computed
as

⇑= # upvotes −# downvotes.

Table 4 validates that the majority of the quotes la-
beled as quotable, were also endorsed by the red-
dit community, and received a non-negative upvote
score. As an illustration, in Table 5, we present five
quotes with the highest upvote scores. Anecdotally,
at the time of this writing, only one of the quotes
in Table 5 (a quote by Mark Twain) appeared in
web search results in contexts other than the origi-
nal book.

5.4 Project Gutenberg Corpus Analysis

In this section, we briefly highlight an interesting ex-
ample of how the proposed computational approach
to quotable phrase extraction can be used for a liter-
ary analysis of the PG digital library. To this end,
we train the supervised quotable phrase detection
method using the entire set of 1,500 manually la-
beled sentences. We then run this model over all the
17.5 million sentences that passed the Naı̈ve Bayes
filtering stage, and retain only the sentences that get
positive perceptron scores (Eq. 2).

This procedure yields 701,418 sentences, which
we call quotable phrases in the remainder of this

the entire Project Gutenberg corpus; however, they
still constitute a sizable collection with some poten-
tially interesting properties.

We propose a simple example of a literary anal-

where x is either a book or an author. To ensure the
statistical validity of our analysis, we limit our atten-
tion to books with at least 25 quotable phrases and
authors with at least 5 books in the PG collection.

Using this definition, we can easily compile a list
of authors and books with the highest quotability in-
dex (see Table 6). An interesting observation is that
many of the authors and books in Table 6 deal with
religious themes: Christianity (e.g., Mary Baker
Eddy, S. D. Gordon), Bahá’ı́sm (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) and
Buddhism (“The Dhammapada”). This is not sur-
prising considering the figurative language common
in the religious prose15.

6 Conclusions

As the number of digitized books increases, a com-
putational analysis of literary corpora becomes an
active research field with many practical applica-
tions. In this paper, we focus on one such appli-
cation: extraction of quotable phrases from books.
Quotable phrase extraction can be used, among
other things, for finding new original quotations
for dictionaries and online quotation repositories, as
well as for generating catchy previews for book ad-
vertisement.

We develop a quotable phrase extraction process
that includes sentence segmentation, unsupervised
sentence filtering based on a quotable language
model, and a supervised quotable phrase detection
using lexical and syntactic features. Our evaluation
demonstrates that this process can be used for high-
precision quotable phrase extraction, especially in
applications that can tolerate lower recall. A study
using a reddit community of quote enthusiasts as
well as a simple corpus analysis further demonstrate
the practical applications of our work.
