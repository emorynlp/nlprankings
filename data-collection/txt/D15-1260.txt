Abstract

In this work, we improve the performance
of intra-sentential zero anaphora resolu-
tion in Japanese using a novel method
of recognizing subject sharing relations.
In Japanese, a large portion of intra-
sentential zero anaphora can be regarded
as subject sharing relations between pred-
icates, that is, the subject of some predi-
cate is also the unrealized subject of other
predicates. We develop an accurate rec-
ognizer of subject sharing relations for
pairs of predicates in a single sentence,
and then construct a subject shared pred-
icate network, which is a set of predi-
cates that are linked by the subject shar-
ing relations recognized by our recognizer.
We finally combine our zero anaphora
resolution method exploiting the subject
shared predicate network and a state-of-
the-art ILP-based zero anaphora resolution
method. Our combined method achieved a
significant improvement over the the ILP-
based method alone on intra-sentential
zero anaphora resolution in Japanese. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explicitly use an independent sub-
ject sharing recognizer in zero anaphora
resolution.

1 Introduction

In ‘pro-dropped’ languages such as Japanese, Chi-
nese and Italian, pronouns are often unrealized in
text. For example, the subject of nomu (take) is
omitted in example (1).

(1) Tomi-wa infuruenza-ni natta-node ,
Tom-TOP flu-IOBJ had-since punc

(ϕi-ga) kusuri-o non-da .
hei-SUBJ medicine-OBJ took period
Since Tomi had the flu, (hei) took medicine.

Such unrealized pronouns are regarded as zero
anaphors, which are indicated using ϕ in liter-
ature, like ϕi-ga in example (1). Zero anaphor
refers to its antecedent somewhere. This phe-
nomenon of the reference is called zero anaphora.
In Japanese, about 60% of subjects appear as zero
anaphors in newspaper articles (Iida et al., 2007b),
and thus zero anaphora resolution is an essential
task for developing highly accurate machine trans-
lation and information extraction systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of re-
solving intra-sentential zero anaphora, in which a
subject zero anaphor refers to its antecedent in-
side a single sentence. This work does not ad-
dress inter-sentential zero anaphora, in which a
zero anaphor in a sentence refers to its antecedent
in another sentence. The novelty of our method
is in the use of subject sharing relations, which
are relations between two predicates that share a
subject by (zero) anaphora or coreference. For ex-
ample, in example (2), there are two subject shar-
ing relations for predicate pairs, advance-plan and
plan-dispatch, as illustrated in Figure 1.

(2) seifui-wa (ϕi-ga) hisaichi-ni
governmenti-TOP iti-SUBJ disaster site-IOBJ

50 nin-o hakensuru koto-o (ϕi-ga)

keikakusi junbisagyo-o susumeru .
plan preparation-OBJ advance period
The governmenti plans that (iti) will dispatch
50 people to the disaster site and (iti) is
advancing its preparations.

The most straightforward method to recognize
subject sharing relations is to apply a (zero)
anaphora resolution system to a sentence and de-
tect such relations by recognizing (zero) anaphora,
like the relations represented by seifui and two
zero anaphors ϕi in Figure 1. However, to our
surprise, we found that a simple supervised clas-
sifier that exploits the local contexts surrounding

predicates achieved a higher accuracy than that
of the straightforward method. This suggests that
just propagating the realized subject of a predi-
cate to the subject zero anaphor of other predicates
through recognized subject sharing relations (e.g.,
propagating subject government of advance to the
subject positions of plan and dispatch in Figure 1)
might lead to a higher accuracy in zero anaphora
resolution than the existing zero anaphora reso-
lution methods. In addition, a large portion of
zero anaphora can be regarded as subject shar-
ing relations (e.g., 39% of the intra-sentential zero
anaphora in the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al.,
2007b) are such cases). Hence, just by combining
our subject zero anaphora method with an existing
general anaphora resolution method that covers
other types of anaphora, significant improvement
of accuracy over all types of anaphora might be
achieved. This paper empirically shows that this
is actually the case through a series of experiments
in which we combine our method with an existing
ILP-based zero anaphora resolution method (Iida
and Poesio, 2011).

Our subject zero anaphora resolution method
constructs a subject shared predicate network
(SSPN), which is a network of predicates in which
subject sharing predicates are linked, from the
results of our accurate pairwise subject sharing
recognizer, which detects the predicate pairs that
share a subject. Zero anaphora resolution is done
by propagating the realized subject of a predi-
cate to the subject zero anaphor of other pred-
icates in the SSPN. An important point here is
that SSPN was introduced to solve the issue re-
lated to our pairwise subject sharing recognizer.
Our recognizer is applied only to the restricted

pairs of predicates in a sentence, such as predi-
cates that have a direct dependency relation be-
tween them. This is because our current recog-
nizer cannot achieve high accuracy for any pair
of predicates. In Figure 1, for instance, our rec-
ognizer can detect a subject sharing relation be-
tween advance and plan and another between plan
and dispatch, but it cannot detect one between ad-
vance and dispatch. However, in the SSPN, the
undetected relations can be derived by connecting
the two detected ones, and in the zero anaphora
resolution subject government of advance can be
successfully propagated to the subject position of
dispatch.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we briefly overview previous work
on zero anaphora resolution. In Section 3, we
overview the procedure of our zero anaphora reso-
lution method. We explain the three types of sub-
ject sharing relations on which we focus and pro-
pose a method of pairwise subject sharing recog-
nition for the three types in Section 4. We eval-
uate how effectively our method recognizes sub-
ject sharing relations for these types in Section 5.
After that, we investigate the impact of explic-
itly introducing SSPNs in Section 6 and com-
pare our zero anaphora resolution method with a
state-of-the-art ILP-based method on the task of
intra-sentential subject zero anaphora resolution in
Section 7. Finally, in Section 8 we summarize this
work and discuss future directions.

2 Related work

Traditional approaches to zero anaphora reso-
lution are based on manually created heuristic
rules (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1994; Oku-
mura and Tamura, 1996; Nakaiwa and Shirai,
1996), which are mainly motivated by the rules
and preferences introduced in Centering The-
ory (Grosz et al., 1995). However, the research
trend of zero anaphora resolution has shifted from
such rule-based approaches to machine learning-
based approaches because in machine learning we
can easily integrate many different types of infor-
mation, such as morpho-syntactic, semantic and
discourse-related information. Researchers have
developed methods of zero anaphora resolution
for Chinese (Zhao and Ng, 2007; Chen and Ng,
2013), Japanese (Seki et al., 2002; Isozaki and Hi-
rao, 2003; Iida et al., 2007a; Taira et al., 2008;
Sasano et al., 2008; Sasano et al., 2009; Imamura

et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2010; Hayashibe et
al., 2011; Iida and Poesio, 2011; Yoshikawa et al.,
2011; Hangyo et al., 2013; Yoshino et al., 2013)
and Italian (Iida and Poesio, 2011). One critical
issue in zero anaphora resolution is optimizing the
outputs of sub-problems (e.g., zero anaphor detec-
tion and antecedent identification). Recent works
by Watanabe et al. (2010), Iida and Poesio (2011)
and Yoshikawa et al. (2011) revealed that joint in-
ference improves the overall performance of zero
anaphora resolution. We employed one of these
works as a baseline in Section 6.

Concerning subject sharing recognition, re-
lated methods have been explored for pronominal
anaphora (Yang et al., 2005) or coreference reso-
lution (Bean and Riloff, 2004; Bansal and Klein,
2012). In these methods, the semantic compatibil-
ity between the contexts surrounding an anaphor
and its antecedent (e.g., the compatibility of verbs
kidnap and release given some arguments) was
automatically extracted from raw texts in an un-
supervised manner and used as features in a ma-
chine learning-based approach. However, because
the automatically acquired semantic compatibility
is not always true or applicable in the context of
any pair of an anaphor and its antecedent, the ef-
fectiveness of the compatibility features might be
weakened. In contrast, we accurately recognize
the explicit subject sharing relations and directly
use them for propagating the subject of some pred-
icate to the empty subject position of other pred-
icates instead of indirectly using the relations as
features.

3 Zero anaphora resolution using subject
shared predicate network

In this section, we first give an overview of the
procedure of our zero anaphora resolution method.
Intra-sentential zero anaphora resolution in our
method is performed in the following five steps,
as depicted in Figure 2.

Step 1 The pairwise subject sharing relations be-
tween two predicates in a sentence are recog-
nized by our subject sharing recognizer.

Step 2 A subject shared predicate network
(SSPN) is constructed based on the results of
pairwise subject sharing recognition.

Step 3 For each predicate in the set of the subject
shared predicates in the SSPN, a subject is
detected by our subject detector, if one exists.

Figure 2: Procedure of our zero anaphora resolu-
tion method

Step 4 If a subject is detected, it is propagated to
the empty subject position of each predicate
in the subject shared predicates in the SSPN.

Step 5 For resolving the potential zero anaphora
that were not resolved until Step 4, we apply
the existing ILP-based method (Iida and Poe-
sio, 2011).

We define subject sharing relations as follows.
Two predicates have a subject sharing relation if
and only if they share the same subject that is re-
ferred to by (zero) anaphora or coreference. Note
that the shared subject does not need to be realized
in the text; it can appear as inter-sentential zero
anaphora or exophora. In Step 1, the pairwise sub-
ject sharing relations between two predicates are
recognized, but recognizing the relations between
any two predicates in a sentence remains difficult.
We thus focus on some typical types of predicate
pairs. The details of the predicate pair types will
be explained in Section 4.1.

Given the results of pairwise subject sharing
recognition, we construct an SSPN in Step 2. In
an SSPN, every predicate in a sentence is a node
and only the predicate pairs that were judged to be
subject sharing are connected by a link. The ma-
jor advantage of explicitly constructing an SSPN
is that it enables us to resolve zero anaphora even

2181



if a predicate with a subject zero anaphor does
not have any direct subject sharing relation with a
predicate with a subject, like predicates susumeru
(advance) and hakensuru (dispatch) in Figure 1.
By traversing the paths of the subject sharing re-
lations in the SSPN, such predicates can be con-
nected to successfully propagate the subject. The
effect of introducing SSPNs is empirically evalu-
ated in Section 6.

For use in Step 3, we create a subject detector,
which judges whether an argument to a predicate
is its subject using SVMlight 1, an implementation
of Support Vector Machine (Vapnik, 1998), with a
polynomial kernel of 2nd degree. The training in-
stances of the subject detector are extracted from
the predicate-argument relations2 in the NAIST
Text Corpus. The numbers of positive and nega-
tive instances are 35,304 and 104,250 respectively.
As features, we used the morpho-syntactic infor-
mation about the lemmas of the predicate and its
argument and the functional words following the
predicate and its argument. The results of subject
detection with 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate
that our subject detector accurately detects sub-
jects with performances of 0.949 in recall, 0.855
in precision, and 0.899 in F-score.

Note that our subject detector checks whether
each predicate in an SSPN has a syntactic sub-
ject among its arguments. An SSPN can include
more than one predicate, and each predicate may
have its own subject3. In this step, if two or more
distinct subjects are detected for predicates in an
SSPN, we use the most likely subject (i.e., the
subject with the highest SVM score outputted by
our subject detector) for subject propagation. Note
that subject propagation is not performed if the
subject position of a predicate is already filled.

Up to this point, the zero anaphora of the fol-
lowing three cases cannot be resolved: (i) no sub-
ject was detected for any predicate in a group
linked by the subject sharing relations in the
SSPN, (ii) no subject sharing relation was recog-
nized for a predicate in the SSPN and (iii) non-

1http://svmlight.joachims.org/
2Note that if a predicate appears in a relative clause and

a noun modified by the clause is the semantic subject of the
predicate, the noun is not regarded as subject by our subject
detector.

3The subject sharing recognizer is likely to regard two
predicates, each of which has its own subject, as non-subject
sharing predicate pairs, but it is still logically possible that
they are judged as subject sharing predicate pairs hence as a
part of an SSPN.

subject arguments were omitted as zero anaphors.
To resolve zero anaphora in these cases, we ap-
ply a state-of-the-art ILP-based zero anaphora res-
olution method (Iida and Poesio, 2011) in Step 5.
This method determines zero anaphor and its an-
tecedent by joint inference using the results of sub-
ject detection, zero anaphor detection and intra-
and inter-sentential antecedent identification. In
the original method by Iida and Poesio (2011),
the inter-sentential zero anaphora was resolved,
but in this work we focus on intra-sentential zero
anaphora. To adapt their method for our problem
setting, we simply removed the inter-sentential an-
tecedent identification model from their method.

4 Pairwise subject sharing recognition

A key component in our zero anaphora resolu-
tion method is pairwise subject sharing recogni-
tion. In this work, we focus on three types of sub-
ject sharing relations (DEP, ADJ and PNP types)
as a first step because the instances belonging to
the three types occupy 62% of intra-sentential zero
anaphora that can be regarded as subject sharing.
We developed a method that recognizes each sub-
ject sharing type and evaluate it.

4.1 Three types of subject sharing relations

We first describe the three types of subject sharing
relations we focus on.

DEP A typical type of subject sharing relation
is one between two predicates that have a syntac-
tical dependency relation. The relation between
two predicates, natta (have) and nonda (take), in
example (1) in Section 1 is classified as this type
because the two predicates have the same subject
Tomi (ϕi), as illustrated in Figure 3. We call this
type of subject sharing the DEP type.

ADJ This type is a subject sharing relation be-
tween two adjacent predicates, i.e., a predicate

pairs that do not have any other predicate between
them in the surface order of a sentence. Although
two adjacent predicates in a sentence tend to share
the same subject, they sometimes cannot be cap-
tured as the DEP type due to a long-distance de-
pendency between predicates. For example, in ex-
ample (3), two adjacent predicates, land and move
onto, have the same subject but not a direct depen-
dency relation, as illustrated in Figure 4.

(ϕi-ga) yudouro-ni hait-ta-atoni

soujukan-ga kikanakunat-ta .
control stick-SUBJ do not work-PAST period
The airplane safely landed, but its control
stick did not work after (iti) moved onto the
taxiway.

To cover such cases, we also take into account the
subject sharing relations of the ADJ type in which
two predicates appear adjacently in the surface or-
der.

PNP In addition to the above two types of re-
lations, in Japanese predicate pairs often have a

subject sharing relation when one of the predi-
cates syntactically depends on a noun (or noun
phrase) that in turn syntactically depends on the
other predicate. Example (4) is classified as such
a type because noun houshin (plan) is placed be-
tween two predicates, akirakanisita (unveil) and
tekkaisuru (abolish), in the dependency path and
predicates share subject chiji (governor), as illus-
trated in Figure 5.

(4) chijii-wa (ϕi-ga) joukou-o
governor-TOP hei-SUBJ stipulation-OBJ

tekkaisuru houshin-o akirakanisi-ta .
abolish plan-TOP unveil-PAST period
The governori unveiled his plan under which
(hei) will abolish the stipulation.

We call this type of subject sharing relation the
PNP type.

In this work, we solve the problem of subject
sharing recognition as a binary classification prob-
lem in which we classify whether two predicates
share the same subject. We solve this problem us-
ing a supervised approach. We independently ex-
tract the training instances for each type from a
corpus to which (zero) anaphora, coreference and
subjects were annotated. The binary labels of the
training instances are classified into the positive
class if the subject of the two predicates in an in-
stance is shared by coreference or (zero) anaphora,
and negative otherwise. To create a classifier, we
use SVMlight and experiment with both a linear
kernel and a polynomial kernel of 2nd degree.

As features, we use the feature set shown in
Table 1. Even though these features look simple,
we expect them to work well to capture the char-
acteristics of each subject sharing type. For ex-
ample, as shown in example (5), the (subject) case
marker of the argument (mother-SUBJ) between
two predicates natta (have) and katta (buy) is a
good indicator of non-subject sharing.

(5) Tomi-ga infuruenza-ni natta-node ,
Tom-SUBJ flu-IOBJ had-since punc

haha-ga kusuri-o katta .
mother-SUBJ medicine-OBJ buy-PAST period
Since Tom had the flu, his mother bought
medicine.

For recognizing the PNP type of subject sharing
relations, whether certain nouns appear between
two predicates is an important clue, e.g., koto
(complementizer) in example (6) and nouryoku
(ability) in example (7).

To robustly capture this characteristic, we use as
features the discrete classes created by the noun
clustering algorithm proposed by Kazama and
Torisawa (2008). It follows the distributional hy-
pothesis, which states that semantically similar
words tend to appear in similar contexts (Harris,
1954). By treating the syntactic dependency re-
lations between words as ‘contexts,’ the clustering
method defines a probabilistic model of noun-verb
dependencies with hidden classes:

p(n, ⟨v, r⟩) =
∑

c

p(n|c)p(⟨v, r⟩|c)p(c)

where n is a noun, v is a verb or noun on which n
depends by grammatical relation r (post-positions
in Japanese), and c is a hidden class. The depen-
dency relation frequencies were obtained from a
600-million page web corpus, and model parame-
ters p(n|c), p(⟨v, r⟩|c) and p(c) were estimated us-
ing the EM algorithm (Hofmann, 1999). We clus-
tered one million nouns into 500 discrete classes

by assigning noun n to class c when the model pa-
rameter p(c|n) > θ (θ = 0.2).

5 Experiment 1: pairwise subject
sharing recognition

We first empirically evaluate the performance of
our pairwise subject sharing recognition for the
DEP, ADJ and PNP types.

5.1 Experimental setting

The training data for the subject sharing recog-
nizer were generated from the NAIST Text Cor-
pus 1.4 (Iida et al., 2007b), in which (zero)
anaphora, coreference and subjects were manu-
ally annotated. We automatically extracted pairs
of predicates from the corpus. Since the original
NAIST Text Corpus has a wide variety of anno-
tation noise, we cleaned it up by the following
strategy. According to the annotation scheme in
the NAIST Text Corpus, predicate-argument rela-
tions were annotated for the ‘bare predicates’ even
if the predicates appear in passive or causative sen-
tences. In such cases, the annotation was difficult
and caused inconsistencies because the annotators
needed to imagine the predicate-argument rela-
tions for predicates that are not explicitly written,
considering case alternation caused by changes of
voice and so on. As such, to achieve a higher level
of consistency, we modified the annotation scheme
for predicate-argument relations by considering
‘surface predicates’ and re-annotated predicate-
argument relations in passive and causative cases,
thus reducing the risk of inconsistent annotations
caused by case alternation.

Table 2: Results of subject sharing recognition

Another important point is that in the NAIST
Text Corpus, if the antecedent of a zero anaphor is
not explicitly written in the corpus, it is simply an-
notated as ‘exophoric’, and the subject sharing re-
lations between two predicates whose subject was
annotated as exophoric cannot be captured. In
contrast, in our cleaning procedure, the annota-
tors additionally annotated such ‘exophoric’ sub-
ject sharing relations to take into account all sub-
ject sharing relations in the corpus.

The predicates in the corpus and their depen-
dency relations were detected based on the outputs
of a Japanese dependency parser, J.DepP5 (Yoshi-
naga and Kitsuregawa, 2009). We obtained 49,313
predicate pairs for the DEP type, 86,728 for the
ADJ type, and 27,117 for the PNP types. The num-
bers of positive instances of DEP, ADJ and PNP
types are 9,524, 13,104, and 2,363 respectively. To
evaluate the subject sharing recognition, we con-
ducted 5-fold cross-validation using these predi-
cate pairs and measured the performance using re-
call, precision and F-score.

Note that we also evaluated a baseline method
that recognizes subject sharing relations using the
results of the state-of-the-art zero anaphora resolu-
tion method (Iida and Poesio, 2011) and the sub-
ject detector at Step 3 in Section 3.

5.2 Results: subject sharing recognition

We measured the performances of the baseline and
our subject sharing recognition method using re-
call, precision and F-score for each of the three
types of subject sharing relations, which are shown
in Table 2. The results demonstrate that all of the
proposed classifiers solved the problems with high
precision. In particular, for each type, the classi-
fier using a polynomial kernel achieved more than

5http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/˜ynaga/jdepp/

70% precision. We thus used the classifiers with
a polynomial kernel for evaluations in Section 6.
The results also show that the classifier using a
polynomial kernel for each type outperformed the
baseline method based on the state-of-the-art zero
anaphora resolution method. That is, the direct
subject sharing recognition using our classifiers
has the potential to lead to a significant improve-
ment in zero anaphora resolution, which we con-
firm through the experiments in Section 7.

Table 2 also shows that the classifier for the DEP
type outperformed those for all of the other types
in F-score. The difference reflects the wider vari-
ations of the problems in both ADJ and PNP com-
pared to the case of DEP. For example, to recog-
nize the PNP type of subject sharing relation, our
classifier needs to appropriately learn the compli-
cated relationship between two predicates and the
noun that intervenes between them, a problem we
do not need to consider for the DEP type.

6 Experiment 2: intra-sentential zero
anaphora resolution between subjects

We next investigate the effect of introducing
SSPNs. In this experiment, we evaluated the per-
formance of intra-sentential zero anaphora resolu-
tion only between subjects, i.e., the positive in-
stances used in this experiment were limited to
the cases where the antecedent of a zero anaphor
is the realized subject of a predicate. We evalu-
ated a method of zero anaphora resolution using
only SSPNs, where intra-sentential zero anaphora
is resolved by the first four steps (Steps 1 to 4)
in Section 3. We compared it to a baseline that
only used the results of pairwise subject sharing
recognition without SSPNs: if the subject shar-
ing relation between two predicates is recognized
by our pairwise subject sharing recognizer and a

single subject is detected by our subject detector
for one of the two predicates, then the subject fills
the empty subject position of the other predicate.
Note that in this baseline method, transitive sub-
ject propagation through more than one subject
sharing relation is not performed. Also, if mul-
tiple subjects are detected for a predicate, we used
the most likely subject to fill the subject position
of the predicate, as in our method.

We conducted 5-fold cross-validation using the
modified version of the NAIST Text Corpus pre-
sented in Section 5.1. In this evaluation, we
used the 8,473 subject zero anaphors that refer
to the subject antecedents (46% of all the intra-
sentential subject zero anaphora, in which a sub-
ject zero anaphor refers to the antecedent that are
not limited to subject) in the corpus. We mea-
sured the performance using recall, precision and
F-score for each of the three types of subject shar-
ing relations and their combinations. When com-
bining more than one subject sharing recognizer in
our method, we construct the SSPN using the sub-
ject sharing relations recognized by at least one
of those recognizers for transitive subject propa-
gation. On the other hand, in the baseline method,
the SSPN was not constructed and zero anaphoric
relations were identified using only the outputs of
our subject detector and one of those recognizers.

The experimental results shown in Table 3
clearly demonstrate that the method with SSPNs
for each type or a combination of the three types
consistently outperformed that without SSPNs ex-
cept for the PNP type. This result suggests that

multi-step propagation of subjects through more
than one subject sharing relation, as done in
SSPNs, is an effective way to propagate a sub-
ject to a subject position that cannot be reached
by a single subject sharing relation. Our results
also show that the F-score is improved by com-
bining different types of subject sharing relations,
and the best F-score, 0.456, was achieved when
we used all types of relations, i.e., in the case of
DEP+ADJ+PNP with SSPNs.

7 Experiment 3: intra-sentential subject
zero anaphora resolution

Finally, we evaluate the performance of intra-
sentential subject zero anaphora resolution. In the
previous section, we evaluated just a part of our
method, i.e., from Step 1 to Step 4 presented in
Section 3. In this section, we evaluate the whole
method, i.e., from Step 1 to Step 5, against 18,324
subject zero anaphors, which are all subject zero
anaphors annotated in our modified version of the
NAIST Text Corpus. As a baseline, we employed
Iida and Poesio (2011)’s method that was tuned
for intra-sentential zero anaphora resolution. The
baseline method solves the problems by applying
only Step 5 in Section 3 to all the predicates.

Our results in Table 4 show that all the meth-
ods using either each type or a combination of the
three types significantly outperformed the base-
line6. The best performing method was DEP+PNP,
which achieved 0.380 in F-score, which is 3.6%

6The significance was tested using McNemar’s testing
(p < 0.01).

higher than the baseline. This suggests that
our method exploiting subject sharing relations
and SSPNs has a positive impact on accuracy of
general intra-sentential zero anaphora resolution
methods because about 84% of zero anaphors of
general intra-sentential zero anaphora appear as
subject zero anaphor in our corpus.

We also estimate how accurately the method us-
ing only the SSPNs evaluated in Section 6 resolves
intra-sentential subject zero anaphora in compari-
son to the baseline method. The results are shown
in Table 5 and demonstrate that the performance
of all the methods without Step 5 does not reach
that of the baseline method in F-score. However,
they retain high precision that ranges from 60% to
75%, preserving more than 10% of the recall on
the DEP, DEP+ADJ, DEP+PNP and DEP+ADJ+PNP
methods. Actually, in some of the potential ap-
plications of zero anaphora resolution, such as in-
formation extraction, methods with high precision
and low recall are preferable to ones with low pre-
cision and high recall. Our methods with SSPNs
alone might be usable in such applications because
of their high precision.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a subject shared pred-
icate network (SSPN), which is a network of

predicates that are linked by subject sharing re-
lations for resolving typical intra-sentential zero
anaphora. In our zero anaphora resolution method,
zero anaphoric relations are identified by propa-
gating a subject through subject sharing paths in
the SSPN. To construct SSPNs, we developed a
novel method of pairwise subject sharing recog-
nition using the local contexts that surround two
predicates and demonstrated that it can accurately
recognize subject sharing relations. We combined
our method of intra-sentential zero anaphora res-
olution with Iida and Poesio (2011)’s method and
achieved significantly better F-score than Iida and
Poesio (2011)’s method alone.

As future work, we are planning to use
commonsense knowledge, such as causal-
ity (Hashimoto et al., 2014) and script-like
knowledge (Sano et al., 2014), that has been
automatically acquired from big data for accurate
subject sharing recognition to improve inter-
sentential zero anaphora resolution for cases not
focused on in this work.
