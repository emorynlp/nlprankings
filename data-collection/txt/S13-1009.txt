Abstract 

This paper describes our system submitted to 
*SEM 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) 
core task which aims to measure semantic si-
milarity of two given text snippets. In this 
shared task, we propose an interpolation STS 
model named Model_LIM integrating Fra-
meNet parsing information, which has a good 
performance with low time complexity com-
pared with former submissions. 

1 Introduction 

The goal of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is 
to measure semantic similarity of two given text 
snippets. STS has been recently proposed by 
Agirre et al. (2012) as a pilot task, which has close 
relationship with both tasks of Textual Entailment 
and Paraphrase, but not equivalent with them and it 
is more directly applicable to a number of NLP 
tasks such as Question Answering (Lin and Pantel, 
2001), Text Summarization (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 
1999), etc. And yet, the acquiring of sentence simi-
larity has been the most important and basic task in 
STS. Therefore, the STS core task of *SEM 2013 
conference, is formally defined as the degree of 
semantic equivalence between two sentences as 
follows: 

 
 5: completely equivalent, as they mean 

the same thing.  
 4: mostly equivalent, but some unimpor-

tant details differ. 

 3: roughly equivalent, but some impor-
tant information differs/missing. 

 2: not equivalent, but share some details.  
 1: not equivalent, but are on the same top-

ic. 
 0: on different topics. 

 
In this paper, we attempt to integrate semantic 

information into STS task besides the lower-level 
word and syntactic information. Evaluation results 
show that our STS model could benefit from se-
mantic parsing information of two text snippets. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 reviews prior researches on STS. Section 3 
illustrates three models measuring text similarity. 
Section 4 describes the linear interpolation model 
in detail. Section 5 provides the experimental re-
sults on the development set as well as the official 
results on all published datasets. Finally, Section 6 
summarizes our paper with direction for future 
works. 

2 Related Work  

Several techniques have been developed for STS. 
The typical approach to finding the similarity be-
tween two text segments is to use simple word 
matching method. In order to improve this simple 
method, Mihalcea et al. (2006) combine two cor-
pus-based and six knowledge-based measures of 
word similarity, but the cost of their algorithm is 
expensive. In contrast, our method treats words 
and texts in essentially the same way. 

In 2012 STS task, 35 teams participate and sub-
mit 88 runs. The two top scoring systems are UKP 

74



and Takelab. The former system (Bär et al., 2012) 
uses a simple log-linear regression model to com-
bine multiple text similarity measures (related to 
content, structure and style) of varying complexity. 
While the latter system Takelab (Šarić et al., 2012) 
uses a support vector regression model with mul-
tiple features measuring word-overlap similarity 
and syntax similarity. 

The results of them score over 80%, far exceed-
ing that of a simple lexical baseline. But both share 
one characteristic: they integrate lexical and syntax 
information without semantic information, espe-
cially FrameNet parsing information. In addition, 
the complexity of these algorithms is very high. 
Therefore, we propose a different and simple mod-
el integrating FrameNet parsing information in this 
paper. 

3 Linear Interpolation Model  

In this paper, we propose a combination interpola-
tion model which is constructed by the results of 
three similarity models based on words, WordNet, 
FrameNet , which are called simWD(·), simWN(·) and 
simFN(·)  respectively. The overall similarity  
simLIM(S1, S2) between a pair of texts S1, S2 is com-
puted in the following equation: 
 
simLIM(S1, S2)= ω1 · simWD(S1, S2)  

+ω2 · simWN(S1, S2) +ω3 · simFN(S1, S2) 
(1)

 
In which, ω1, ω2 and ω3 are respectively the 
weights of the similarity models, i.e., ω1 +ω2 +ω3 
= 1; and they are all positive hyperparameters. 
Now, we describe the three models used in this 
equation. 

3.1 Similarity Based on Words 

This model is motivated by Vector Space Model 
(Salton et al., 1975). We present each sentence as a 
vector in the multidimensional token space. Let Sc 
denote the set of all words in the c-th text snippets 
(c = 1, 2); the words of bag is W = S1  S2. Hence, 
the similarity of a pair of sentences, formally ex-
pressed as: 

simWD(S1, S2) = 
∑  ,  · ,| |

∑ ,| |  · ∑ ,| |
 

 
(2)

 
In which, we can find ,  1,2, … , | |; 

1,2  by solving: 
 

,
1, ,
0,  

 

 
(3)

From these two equations above, we can see the 
more identical words in a text pair, the more simi-
lar the two snippets are. Whereas, by intuition, 
many high-frequency functional words would not 
be helpful to the estimation of the similarity given 
in Eq.(2). Therefore, in the preprocessing stage, we 
compute the word frequencies per dataset, and then 
remove the high frequency words (top 1% in fre-
quency list) in each segment. 

3.2 Similarity Based on WordNet 

This model measures semantic similarity with the 
help of such resources that specifically encode re-
lations between words or concepts like WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998). We use the algorithms by Lin 
(1998) on WordNet to compute the similarity be-
tween two words a and b, which we call simLin(a, 
b). Let S1, S2 be the two word sets of two given text 
snippets, we use the method below: 
 
simWN(S1, S2)  

=
∑   ,  · ,| |,| |

| |,| |
 

 
(4)

In which, , 1,2 . In the numerator of 
Eq.(4),we try to max(·), avg(·) and mid(·) respec-
tively, then we find the max(·) is the best. 

3.3 Similarity Based on FrameNet 

FrameNet lexicon (Fillmore et al., 2003) is a rich 
linguistic resource containing expert knowledge 
about lexical and predicate-argument semantics in 
English. In a sentence, word or phrase tokens that 
evoke a frame are known as targets. Each frame 
definition also includes a set of frame elements, or 
roles, corresponding to different aspects of the 
concept represented by the frame, such as partici-
pants, props, and attributes. We use the term ar-
gument to refer to a sequence of word tokens 
annotated as filling a frame role. 

All the data are automatically parsed by 
SEMFOR1 (Das and Smith, 2012; Das and Smith,

2011). Figure 1 shows the parser output of a sen-
tence pair given in Microsoft Research Video De-
scription Corpus with annotated targets, frames 
and role argument pairs. It can be noticed that 
FrameNet parsing information could give some 
clues of the similarity of two given snippets and 
we think that integrating this information could 
improve the accuracy of STS task. For example, 
the sentences in the Figure 1 both illustrate “some-
body is moving”. However, our model depends on 
the precision of that parser. If it would be im-
proved, the results in STS task would be better. 

 

 
Figure 1: This is a pair of sentences in 2013 STS train-
ing data: (a) Girls are walking on the stage; (b) Women 
models are walking down a catwalk. The words in bold 
correspond to targets, which evoke semantic frames that 
are denoted in capital letters. Every frame is shown in a 
distinct color; the arguments of each frame are anno-
tated with the same color, and marked below the sen-
tence, at different levels; the spans marked in the block 
of dotted liens fulfill a specific role. 
 

For a given sentence Sc (c = 1,2) with a set of 
evoked frame Fc = < f1,f2, …, fn > (n is the number 
of evoked frames), a set of target word with each 
frame Tc = < t1, t2, …, tn > and the set of roles 
(namely, frame elements) c = {Rc,1, Rc,2, …,Rc,n}, 
each frame contains one or more arguments  
Rc,i = {rj} (i = 1, 2, …, n; j is an integer that is 
greater or equal to zero). Take Figure 1 as an ex-
ample, 

 
T1 = <grils, walking>, 
F1 = <PEOPLE, SELF_MOTION>, 

1 = {R1,1, R1,2 }, 
 R1,1 = {girls},  
R1,2 = {girls, on the stage}; 

 
T2 = <women, models, walking, down>, 
F2 = <PEOPLE, VEHICLE, 

SELF_MOTION, DIRECTION>, 

2 = {R2,1, R2,2, R2,3, R2,4}, 
R2,1 = {women}, R2,2 = {models}, 
R2,3 = {women models}, R2,4 = {down}. 

 
In order to compute simFr(·) simply, we also use 

a interpolation model to combine the similarities 
based on target words simTg(·), frames simFr(·) and 
frame relations simRe(·). They are estimated as the 
following: 

When computing the similarity on target word 
level simTg(S1, S2), we also consider each sentence 
as a vector of target words as is seen in Eq.(5). 

 
T = T1   T2; 

simTg(S1, S2)= 
∑  ,  · ,|T|

∑ ,| |  · ∑ ,| |
 

 

 
 
(5)

In which, we can find t ,  1,2, … , | |; 
1,2  by solving: 

 

,
1, ,   ,

1,2, … , | |
0,

 

 

 
(6)

Let simFr(S1, S2) be the similarity on frame level 
as shown in Eq.(7), with each sentence as a vector 
of frames. We define f1,i, f2,i like ,  in Eq.(3). 

 
F = F1  F2; 

simFr(S1, S2)= 
∑  ,  · ,| |

∑ ,| |  · ∑ ,| |
 

 

 
 
(7)

Before computing the role relationship between 
the pair of sentences, we should find the contain-
ment relationship of each pair of frames in one 
sentence. We use a rule to define the containment 
relationship: 

Given two frames fc,i, fc,j in a sentence Sc, if  
, ,  , then fc,j contains fc,i - and that is 

fc,i is a child of fc,j. After that we add them into the 
set of frame relationship  , , ,

 , ,   0 . 
We consider the relationship between two 

frames in a sentence as a 2-tuple, and again use 
Figure 1 as an example, 

Rlt1 = <PEOPLE, SELF_MOTION> ; 
Rlt2 = <PEOPLE, SELF_MOTION>,  

<VEHICLE, SELF_MOTION > . 

76



Besides, we do exactly the same with both 
frames, namely ,  c  1,2  the value 
of ,  is 1. The similarity on frame relationship 
level simRe(S1, S2) presents each sentence as a vec-
tor of roles as shown in Eq.(8).  

 
Rlt = Rlt1  Rlt2; 
simRe(S1, S2)= 

∑  ,  · ,| |

∑ ,| |  · ∑ ,| |
 

 
(8)

Lastly, the shallow semantic similarity between 
two given sentences is computed as: 

 
SimFN(S1, S2)= α · simTg(S1, S2)  

+β · simFr(S1, S2) +γ · simRe(S1, S2) 
 

 
(9)

In which, α + β + γ =1, and they are all positive 
hyperparameters. As shown in Figure 2, we plot 
the Pearson correlation (vertical axis) against the 
combination of parameters (horizontal axis) in all 
2013 STS train data (2012 STS data). We notice 
that generally the Pearson correlation is fluctuates, 
and the correlation peak is found at 32, which in 
Table 1 is α=0.6, β=0.3, γ=0.1.

the value of result confidence is 100. The effect values 
are represented by a vertical line (i.e. ID = 32). 
 

4 Tuning Hyperparameters  

Eq.(1) is a very simple linear interpolation model, 
and we tune the hyperparameters on the whole 
2012 STS data. 

As shown in Figure 3,we plot the Pearson corre-
lation (vertical axis) for the different combination 
of parameters ω1, ω2 and ω3 (horizontal axis). We 
notice that generally the Pearson correlation fluc-
tuates with a dropping tendency in most cases, and 
the correlation peak presents at 13, which in Table 
1 is ω1=0.8, ω2=0.1, ω3=0.1.

5 Results 

We submit four runs: the first one (Model_WD) is 
based on word similarity; the second one (Mod-
el_WN) which is only using the similarity based on 
WordNet, is submitted with the team name of 
SXULLL; the third one (Model_FN) which uses 
FrameNet similarity defined in Section 3.3; and the 
last one in which we combine the three similarities 
described in Section 4 together with an interpola-
tion model. In addition, we map our outputs mul-
tiply by five to the [0-5] range. 

It is worth notice that in the first model, we lo-
wercase all words and remove all numbers and 
punctuations. And in the third model, we extract all 
frame-semantic roles with SEMFOR. 

In the experiment, we use eight datasets totally - 
namely MSRpar, MSRvid, SMTeuroparl, OnWN, 
SMTnews, headlines, FNWN and SMT - with their 
gold standard file to evaluate the performance of 
the submitted systems. Evaluation is carried out 
using the official scorer which computes Pearson 
correlation between the human rated similarity 
scores and the system’s output. The final measure 
is the score that is weighted by the number of text 
pairs in each dataset (”Mean”). See Agirre et al. 
(2012) for a full description of the metrics. 

5.1 Experiments on STS 2012 Data 

There is no new train data in 2013, so we use 2012  
data as train data. From Table 2, 3 we can see that 
the Model_LIM has better performance than the 
other three models. 
 

 MSRpar MSRvid SMTeuroparl Mean
Model_WD 0.4532  0.4487   0.6467 0.5153
Model_WN 0.2718  0.5410  0.6225  0.4774
Model_FN 0.4437  0.5530  0.5178  0.5048
Model_LIM 0.4896  0.5533  0.6681  0.5696

Table 2: Performances of the four models on 2012 train 
data. The highest correlation in each column is given in 
bold. 
 

From Table 2, we notice that all the models ex-
cept Model_FN, are apt to handle the SMTeuroparl 
that involves long sentences. For Model_FN, it 
performs well in computing on short and similarly 
structured texts such as MSRvid (This will be con-
firmed in test data later). Although WordNet and 
FrameNet model has a mere weight of 20% in 
Model_LIM (i.e. ω1 +ω2 = 0.2), the run which in-
tegrate more semantic information displays a con-

sistent performance across the three train sets (es-
pecially in SMTeuroparl, the Pearson correlation 
rises from 0.5178 to 0.66808), when compared to 
the other three. 

 
 MSRpar MSRvid SMTeuroparl OnWN SMTnews Mean 

Baseline 0.4334 0.2996 0.4542 0.5864 0.3908 0.4356

Model_WD 0.4404 0.5464 0.5059 0.6751 0.4583 0.5346

Model_WN 0.1247 0.6608 0.0637 0.4089 0.3436 0.3417

Model_FN 0.3830 0.6082 0.3537 0.6091 0.4061 0.4905

Model_LIM 0.4489 0.6301 0.5086 0.6841 0.4872 0.5631
UKP_run2 0.6830 0.8739 0.5280 0.6641 0.4937 0.6773

Table 3: Performances of our three models as well as 
the baseline and UKP_run2 (that is ranked 1 in last STS 
task) results on 2012 test data. The highest correlation in 
each column is given in bold. 
 

The 2012 STS test results obtained by first rank-
ing UKP_run2 and baseline system are shown in 
Table 3, it is interesting to notice that performance 
of Model_WD is similar with Model_LIM except 
on MSRvid, the text segments in which there are 
fewer identical words because of the semantic 
equivalence. For Model_FN, we can see it per-
forms well on short and similarly structured texts 
(MSRvid and OnWN) as mentioned before. This is 
because the precision of FrameNet parser took ef-
fect on the FrameNet-based models performance. 
Compared to UKP_run2, the performance of Mod-
el_LIM is obviously better on OnWN set, while on 
SMTeuroparl and SMTnews this model scores 
slightly lower than UKP_run2. Finally, Mod-
el_LIM did not perform best on MSRpar and 
MSRvid compared with UKP_run2, but it has low 
time complexity and integrates semantic informa-
tion. 

5.2 Official Results on STS 2013 Test Data 

Table 4 provides the official results of our submit-
ted systems, along with the rank on each dataset. 
Generally, all results outperform the baseline, 
based on simple word overlap. However, the per-
formance of Model_LIM is not always the best in 
the three runs for each dataset. From the table we 
can note that a particular model always performs 
well on the dataset including the lexicon on which 
the model is based on e.g. Model_WN in OnWN, 
Model_FN in FNWN. Besides, Model_WD and 
Model_LIM almost have same scores except in 
OnWN set, because in Model_LIM is included 
with WordNet resource.

Table 4: Performances of our systems as well as base-
line on STS 2013 individual test data, accompanied by 
their rank (out of 90) shown in brackets. Scores in bold 
denote significant improvements over the baseline. 
 

As seen from the system rank in table, the op-
timal runs in the three submitted system remain 
with Model_LIM. Not only Model_LIM performs 
best on two occasions, but also Model_FN ranks 
top ten twice, in FNWN and SMT respectively, we 
owe this result to the contribution of FrameNet 
parsing information. 

6 Conclusion 

We have tested all the models on published STS 
datasets. Compared with the official results, Mod-
el_LIM system is apt to handle the SMT that in-
volves long sentences. Moreover, this system just 
integrates words, WordNet and FrameNet semantic 
information, thus it has low time complexity. 
There is still much room for improvement in our 
work. For example, we will attempt to use multiva-
riate regression software to tuning the hyperpara-
meters.
