Abstract

This paper presents a system which adopts
a standard sequence labeling technique for
hedge detection and scope finding. For
the first task, hedge detection, we formu-
late it as a hedge labeling problem, while
for the second task, we use a two-step la-
beling strategy, one for hedge cue label-
ing and the other for scope finding. In par-
ticular, various kinds of syntactic features
are systemically exploited and effectively
integrated using a large-scale normalized
feature selection method. Evaluation on
the CoNLL-2010 shared task shows that
our system achieves stable and competi-
tive results for all the closed tasks. Fur-
thermore, post-deadline experiments show
that the performance can be much further
improved using a sufficient feature selec-
tion.

1 Introduction

Hedges are linguistic devices representing spec-
ulative parts of articles. Previous works such as
(Hyland, 1996; Marco and Mercer, 2004; Light et
al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2008) present research
on hedge mainly as a linguistic phenomenon.
Meanwhile, detecting hedges and their scopes au-
tomatically are increasingly important tasks in nat-
ural language processing and information extrac-
tion, especially in biomedical community. The
shared task of CoNLL-2010 described in Farkas
et al. (2010) aims at detecting hedges (task 1)
and finding their scopes (task 2) for the literature

from BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008) and
Wikipedia. This paper describes a system adopt-
ing sequence labeling which performs competitive
in the official evaluation, as well as further test.
In addition, a large-scale feature selection proce-
dure is applied in training and development. Con-
sidering that BioScope corpus is annotated by two
independent linguists according to a formal guide-
line (Szarvas, 2008), while Wikipedia weasels are
tagged by netizens who are diverse in background
and various in evaluation criterion, it is needed to
handle them separately. Our system selects fea-
tures for Wikipedia and BioScope corpus indepen-
dently and evaluate them respectively, leading to
fine performances for all of them.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The next section presents the technical details of
our system of hedge detection and scope finding.
Section 3 gives information of features. Section
4 shows the evaluation results, including official
results and further ones after official outputs col-
lection. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Methods

Basically, the tasks are formulated as sequence la-
beling in our approach. The available label set dif-
fers between task 1 and 2. In addition, it is needed
to introduce an indicator in order to find scopes for
the multi-hedge sentences properly.

2.1 Hedge detection

The valid label set of task 1, hedge detection, con-
tains only two labels: “Hedge” and “ ”, which
represent that a word is in a hedge cue or not
respectively. Since results of hedge detection in
this shared task are evaluated at sentence level, a
sentence will be classified as “uncertain” in the
post-process if it has one or more words labeled
“Hedge” in it and otherwise “certain”.

2.2 Scope finding

The second task is divided into two steps in our
system. The first step is quite the same as what
the system does in task 1: labeling the words as in
hedge cues or not. Then the scope of each hedge
will be labeled by taking advantage of the result
of the first step. A scope can be denoted by a
beginning word and an ending word to represent
the first and the last element. In scope finding the
available label set contains “Begin”, “End”, “Mid-
dle” and “ ”, representing the first and last word in
the scope, in-scope and out-of-scope. As an exam-
ple, a sentence with hedge cue and scope labeling
is given in Table 1. Hedge cue “indicating” with
its scope from “indicating” itself to “transcription”
are labeled. While evaluating outputs, only “Be-
gin”s and “End”s will be taken into consideration
and be treated as the head and tail tokens of the
scopes of specific hedge cues.

Table 1: A sentence with hedge cue and scope la-
beling

It seems that the best labeling result of task 1
can be used directly to be the proper intermediate
representation of task 2. However, the complexity
of scope finding for multi-hedge sentences forces
us to modify the intermediate result of task 2 for
the sake of handling the sentences with more than
one hedge cue correctly. Besides, since task 1 is
a sentence classification task essentially, while the
goal of the first step of task 2 is to label the words
as accurately as possible, it is easy to find that
the optimal labeling results of task 1 may not be
optimal to be the intermediate representations for
task 2. This problem can be solved if sentence-
level hedge detection and intermediate representa-

tion finding are treated as two separate tasks with
independent feature selection procedures. The de-
tails of feature selection will be given in section
3.

2.3 Scope finding for multi-hedge cases

Sentences with more than one hedge cue are quite
common in both datasets of BioScope corpus and
Wikipedia. By counting hedges in every sentence,
we find that about one fourth of the sentences with
hedges have more than one hedge cue in all three
data sources (Table 2). In Morante and Daele-
mans (2009), three classifiers predict whether each
token is Begin, End or None and a postprocess-
ing is needed to associate Begins and Ends with
their corresponding hedge cues. In our approach,
in order to decrease ambiguous or illegal outputs
e.g. inequivalent numbers of Begins and Ends, a
pair of Begin and End without their correspond-
ing hedge cue between them, etc., sentences with
more than one hedge cue will be preprocessed by
making copies as many as the number of hedges
and be handled separately.

The sentence which is selected as a sample has
two hedge cues: “suggesting” and “may”, so our
system preprocesses the sentence into two single-
hedge ones, which is illustrated in Table 3. Now it
comes to the problem of finding scope for single-
hedge sentence. The two copies are labeled sep-
arately, getting one scope from “suggesting” to
“mitogenesis” for the hedge cue “suggesting” and
the other from “IFN-alpha” to “mitogenesis” for
“may”. Merging the two results will give the final
scope resolution of the sentence.

However, compared with matching Begins and
Ends in postprocessing given by Morante and
Daelemans (2009), the above method gives rise
to out of control of projections of the scopes,
i.e. scopes of hedges may partially overlap after
copies are merged. Since scopes should be in-
tact constituents of sentences, namely, subtrees in
syntax tree which never partly overlap with each
other, results like this are linguistically illegal and
should be discarded. We solve this problem by in-
troducing an instructional feature called “Indica-
tor”. For sentences with more than one hedge cue,
namely more than one copy while finding scopes,
words inside the union of existing (labeled) scopes
will be tagged as “Indicator” in unhandled copies
before every labeling. For example, after finding
scope for the first copy in Table 3 and words from

“suggesting” to “mitogenesis” are put in the scope
of cue “suggesting”, these words should be tagged
“Indicator” in the second copy, whose result is il-
lustrated in Table 4. If not in a scope, any word is
tagged “ ” as the indicator. The “Indicator”s tag-
ging from “suggesting” to “mitogenesis” in Table
4 mean that no other than the situations of a) “Be-
gin” is after or at “suggesting” and “End” is before
or at “mitogenesis” b) Both “Begin” and “End” are
before “suggesting” c) Both next “Begin” and next
“End” are after “mitogenesis” can be accepted. In
other words, new labeling should keep the projec-
tions of scopes in the result. Although it is only
an instructional indicator and does not have any
coerciveness, the evaluation result of experiment
shows it effective.

3 Feature selection

Since hedge and scope finding are quite novel
tasks and it is not easy to determine the effective
features by experience, a greedy feature selection
is conducted. As it mentioned in section 2, our
system divides scope finding into two sub-tasks:

Table 4: Scope resolution with instructional fea-
ture: “Indicator”

a) Hedge cue labeling

b) Scope labeling

The first one is the same as hedge detection task
in strategy, but quite distinct in target of feature
set, because hedge detection is a task of sentence
classification while the first step of scope find-
ing aims at high accuracy of labeling hedge cues.
Therefore, three independent procedures of fea-
ture selection are conducted for BioScope corpus
dataset. As Wikipedia is not involved in the task of
scope finding, it only needs one final feature set.

About 200 feature templates are initially con-
sidered for each task. We mainly borrow ideas and
are enlightened by following sources while initial-
izing feature template sets:

a) Previous papers on hedge detection and
scope finding (Light et al., 2004; Medlock,
2008; Medlock and Briscoe, 2008; Kilicoglu
and Bergler, 2008; Szarvas, 2008; Ganter
and Strube, 2009; Morante and Daelemans,
2009);

94



b) Related works such as named entity recog-
nition (Collins, 1999) and text chunking
(Zhang et al., 2001);

c) Some literature on dependency parsing
(Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonald et al.,
2005; Nivre, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009c; Zhao
et al., 2009a);

3.1 Notations of Feature Template

A large amount of advanced syntactic features in-
cluding syntactic connections, paths, families and
their concatenations are introduced. Many of these
features come from dependency parsing, which
aims at building syntactic tree expressed by depen-
dencies between words. More details about de-
pendency parsing are given in Nivre and Scholz
(2004) and McDonald et al. (2005). The parser
in Zhao et al. (2009a) is used to construct de-
pendency structures in our system, and some of
the notations in this paper adopt those presented
in Zhao et al. (2009c). Feature templates are from
various combinations or integrations of the follow-
ing basic elements.

Word Property. This part of features includes
word form (form), lemma (lemma), part-of-speech
tag (pos), syntactic dependency (dp) , syntactic de-
pendency label (dprel).

Syntactic Connection. This includes syntactic
head (h), left(right) farthest(nearest) child (lm, ln,
rm and rn) and high (low) support verb, noun or
preposition. Here we specify the last one as an
example, support verb(noun/preposition). From a
given word to the syntactic root along the syntac-
tic tree, the first verb/noun/preposition that is met
is called its low support verb/noun/preposition,
and the nearest one to the root(farthest to
the given word) is called as its high support
verb/noun/preposition. The concept of support
verb was broadly used (Toutanova et al., 2005;
Xue, 2006; Jiang and Ng, 2006), and it is extended
to nouns and prepositions in Zhao et al. (2009b).
In addition, a slightly modified syntactic head, pp-
head, is introduced, it returns the left most sibling
of a given word if the word is headed by a prepo-
sition, otherwise it returns the original head.

Path. There are two basic types of path. One
is the linear path (linePath) in the sequence, the
other is the path in the syntactic parsing tree (dp-
Path). For example, m:n|dpPath represents the
dependency path from word m to n. Assuming
that the two paths from m and n to the root are

pm and pn, m:n|dpPathShare, m:n|dpPathPred
and m:n|dpPathArgu represent the common part
of pm and pn, part of pm which does not belong
to pn and part of pn which does not belong to pm,
respectively.

Family. A children set includes all syntactic
children(children) are used in the template nota-
tions.

Concatenation of Elements. For all collected
elements according to dpPath, children and so on,
we use three strategies to concatenate all those
strings to produce the feature value. The first is
seq, which concatenates all collected strings with-
out doing anything. The second is bag, which
removes all duplicated strings and sort the rest.
The third is noDup, which removes all duplicated
neighbored strings.

Hedge Cue Dictionary and Scope Indicator.
Hedge cues in the training set are collected and put
in a dictionary. Whether a word in the training or
testing set is in the dictionary (dic) is introduced
into feature templates. As the evaluation is non-
open, we do not put in any additional hedge cues
from other resources. An indicator (indicator) is
given for multi-hedge scope finding, as specified
in section 2.At last, in feature set for scope label-
ing, hedge represents that the word is in a hedge
cue.

At last, we take x as current token to be labeled,
and xm to denote neighbor words. m > 0 repre-
sents that it is a word goes mth after current word
and m < 0 for word −mth before current word.

3.2 Feature template sets for each task

As optimal feature template subsets cannot be ex-
pected to be extracted from so large sets by hand,
greedy feature selections according to Zhao et al.
(2009b) are applied. The normalized feature selec-
tion has been proved to be effective in quite a lot
of NLP tasks and can often successfully select an
optimal or very close to optimal feature set from a
large-scale superset. Although usually it needs 3
to 4 loops denoted by “While” in the Algorithm 1
of Zhao et al. (2009b) to get the best template set,
we only complete one before official outputs col-
lection because of time limitation, which to a large
extent hinders the performance of the system.

Three template sets are selected for BioScope
corpus. One with the highest accuracy for
sentence-level hedge detection (Set B), one with
the best performance for word-level hedge cue la-

95



beling (Set H) and another one with the maximal
F-score for scope finding (Set S). In addition, one
set is discovered for sentence-level hedge detec-
tion of Wikipedia (Set W)1 . Table 52 lists some
selected feature templates which are basic word or
hedging properties for the three sets of BioScope
corpus and Wikipedia. From the table we can see
it is clear that the combinations of lemma, POS
and word form of words in context, which are usu-
ally basic and common elements in NLP, are also
effective for hedge detection. And as we expected,
the feature that represents whether the word is in
the hedge list or not is very useful especially in
hedge cue finding, indicating that methods based
on a hedge cue lists (Light et al., 2004) or keyword
selection (Szarvas, 2008) are quite significant way
to accomplish such tasks.

Some a little complicated syntactic features
based on dependencies are systemically exploited
as features for tasks. Table 6 enumerates some of
the syntactic features which proves to be highly
effective. We noticed that lowSupportNoun, high-
SupportNoun and features derived from dpPath is
notably useful. It can be explained by the aware-
ness that hedge labeling and scope finding are to
process literatures in the level of semantics where
syntactic features are often helpful.

We continue our feature selection procedures
for BioScope corpus after official outputs collec-
tion and obtain feature template sets that bring bet-
ter performance. Table 7 gives some of the fea-
tures in the optimized sets for BioScope corpus
resolution. One difference between the new sets
and the old ones is the former contain more syntac-
tic elements, indicating that exploiting syntactic
feature is a correct choice. Another difference is
the new sets assemble more information of words
before or after the current word, especially words
linearly far away but close in syntax tree. Appear-
ance of combination of these two factors such as
x−1.lm.form seems to provide an evidence of the
insufficiency training and development of our sys-
tem submitted to some extent.

on the in-domain and cross-domain evaluation set.
All the experiments are implemented and run by
Maximum Entropy Markov Models (McCallum,
2000).

4.1 Official results
The official results for tasks are in Table 8, in
which three in-domain tests and cue matching
result for biomedical texts are listed. For the
first task for BioCorpus, our system gives F-score
0.8363 in in-domain test and for Wikipedia we
give F-score 0.5618 in closed evaluation. For the
second task, our system gives results in closed and
open test, with F-score 0.4425 and 0.4441 respec-
tively.

We compare the F-score of our system with the
best in the final result in Table 9. We rank pretty
high in Wikipedia hedge detection, while other
three are quite steady but not prominent. This is
mainly due to two reasons:

1. Feature selection procedures are not perfectly
conducted.

2. Abstracts and fulltexts in BioScope are mixed
to be the training set, which proves quite in-
appropriate when the evaluation set contains

97



only fulltext literature, since abstract and full-
text are quite different in terms of hedging.

4.2 Further results

Intact feature selection procedures for BioScope
corpus are conducted after official outputs collec-
tions. The results of evaluation with completely
selected features compared with the incomplete
one are given in Table 7. The system performs a
higher score on evaluation data (Table 10), which
is more competitive in both tasks on BioScope cor-
pus. The improvement for task 2 is significant, but
the increase of performance of hedge cue detec-
tion is less remarkable. We believe that a larger
fulltext training set and a more considerate train-
ing plan will help us to do better job in the future
work.

5 Conclusion

We describe the system that uses sequence label-
ing with normalized feature selection and rich fea-
tures to detect hedges and find scopes for hedge
cues. Syntactic features which are derived from
dependencies are exploited, which prove to be
quite favorable. The evaluation results show that
our system is steady in performance and does
pretty good hedging and scope finding in both Bio-
Scope corpus and Wikipedia, especially when the
feature selection procedure is carefully and totally
conducted. The results suggest that sequence la-
beling and a feature-oriented method are effective
in such NLP tasks.
