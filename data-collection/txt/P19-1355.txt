Abstract

Recent progress in hardware and methodol-
ogy for training neural networks has ushered
in a new generation of large networks trained
on abundant data. These models have ob-
tained notable gains in accuracy across many
NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improve-
ments depend on the availability of exception-
ally large computational resources that neces-
sitate similarly substantial energy consump-
tion. As a result these models are costly to
train and develop, both financially, due to the
cost of hardware and electricity or cloud com-
pute time, and environmentally, due to the car-
bon footprint required to fuel modern tensor
processing hardware. In this paper we bring
this issue to the attention of NLP researchers
by quantifying the approximate financial and
environmental costs of training a variety of re-
cently successful neural network models for
NLP. Based on these findings, we propose ac-
tionable recommendations to reduce costs and
improve equity in NLP research and practice.

1 Introduction

Advances in techniques and hardware for train-
ing deep neural networks have recently en-
abled impressive accuracy improvements across
many fundamental NLP tasks (Bahdanau et al.,
2015; Luong et al., 2015; Dozat and Man-
ning, 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017), with the
most computationally-hungry models obtaining
the highest scores (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,
2019; Radford et al., 2019; So et al., 2019). As
a result, training a state-of-the-art model now re-
quires substantial computational resources which
demand considerable energy, along with the as-
sociated financial and environmental costs. Re-
search and development of new models multiplies
these costs by thousands of times by requiring re-
training to experiment with model architectures
and hyperparameters. Whereas a decade ago most

mon NLP models, compared to familiar consumption.1

NLP models could be trained and developed on
a commodity laptop or server, many now require
multiple instances of specialized hardware such as
GPUs or TPUs, therefore limiting access to these
highly accurate models on the basis of finances.

Even when these expensive computational re-
sources are available, model training also incurs a
substantial cost to the environment due to the en-
ergy required to power this hardware for weeks or
months at a time. Though some of this energy may
come from renewable or carbon credit-offset re-
sources, the high energy demands of these models
are still a concern since (1) energy is not currently
derived from carbon-neural sources in many loca-
tions, and (2) when renewable energy is available,
it is still limited to the equipment we have to pro-
duce and store it, and energy spent training a neu-
ral network might better be allocated to heating a
family’s home. It is estimated that we must cut
carbon emissions by half over the next decade to
deter escalating rates of natural disaster, and based
on the estimated CO2 emissions listed in Table 1,

model training and development likely make up
a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emis-
sions attributed to many NLP researchers.

To heighten the awareness of the NLP commu-
nity to this issue and promote mindful practice and
policy, we characterize the dollar cost and carbon
emissions that result from training the neural net-
works at the core of many state-of-the-art NLP
models. We do this by estimating the kilowatts
of energy required to train a variety of popular
off-the-shelf NLP models, which can be converted
to approximate carbon emissions and electricity
costs. To estimate the even greater resources re-
quired to transfer an existing model to a new task
or develop new models, we perform a case study
of the full computational resources required for the
development and tuning of a recent state-of-the-art
NLP pipeline (Strubell et al., 2018). We conclude
with recommendations to the community based on
our findings, namely: (1) Time to retrain and sen-
sitivity to hyperparameters should be reported for
NLP machine learning models; (2) academic re-
searchers need equitable access to computational
resources; and (3) researchers should prioritize de-
veloping efficient models and hardware.

2 Methods

To quantify the computational and environmen-
tal cost of training deep neural network mod-
els for NLP, we perform an analysis of the en-
ergy required to train a variety of popular off-
the-shelf NLP models, as well as a case study of
the complete sum of resources required to develop
LISA (Strubell et al., 2018), a state-of-the-art NLP
model from EMNLP 2018, including all tuning
and experimentation.

We measure energy use as follows. We train the
models described in §2.1 using the default settings
provided, and sample GPU and CPU power con-
sumption during training. Each model was trained
for a maximum of 1 day. We train all models on
a single NVIDIA Titan X GPU, with the excep-
tion of ELMo which was trained on 3 NVIDIA
GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. While training, we repeat-
edly query the NVIDIA System Management In-
terface2 to sample the GPU power consumption
and report the average over all samples. To sample
CPU power consumption, we use Intel’s Running
Average Power Limit interface.3

the top 3 cloud compute providers (Cook et al., 2017),
compared to the United States,4 China5 and Germany
(Burger, 2019).

We estimate the total time expected for mod-
els to train to completion using training times and
hardware reported in the original papers. We then
calculate the power consumption in kilowatt-hours
(kWh) as follows. Let pc be the average power
draw (in watts) from all CPU sockets during train-
ing, let pr be the average power draw from all
DRAM (main memory) sockets, let pg be the aver-
age power draw of a GPU during training, and let
g be the number of GPUs used to train. We esti-
mate total power consumption as combined GPU,
CPU and DRAM consumption, then multiply this
by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which ac-
counts for the additional energy required to sup-
port the compute infrastructure (mainly cooling).
We use a PUE coefficient of 1.58, the 2018 global
average for data centers (Ascierto, 2018). Then the
total power pt required at a given instance during
training is given by:

pt =
1.58t(pc + pr + gpg)

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
provides average CO2 produced (in pounds per
kilowatt-hour) for power consumed in the U.S.
(EPA, 2018), which we use to convert power to
estimated CO2 emissions:

CO2e = 0.954pt (2)

This conversion takes into account the relative pro-
portions of different energy sources (primarily nat-
ural gas, coal, nuclear and renewable) consumed
to produce energy in the United States. Table 2
lists the relative energy sources for China, Ger-
many and the United States compared to the top

three cloud service providers. The U.S. break-
down of energy is comparable to that of the most
popular cloud compute service, Amazon Web Ser-
vices, so we believe this conversion to provide a
reasonable estimate of CO2 emissions per kilowatt
hour of compute energy used.

2.1 Models

We analyze four models, the computational re-
quirements of which we describe below. All mod-
els have code freely available online, which we
used out-of-the-box. For more details on the mod-
els themselves, please refer to the original papers.
Transformer. The Transformer (T2T) model
(Vaswani et al., 2017) is an encoder-decoder archi-
tecture primarily recognized for efficient and accu-
rate machine translation. The encoder and decoder
each consist of 6 stacked layers of multi-head self-
attention. Vaswani et al. (2017) report that the
Transformer base model (T2Tbase; 65M param-
eters) was trained on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for
12 hours, and the Transformer big model (T2Tbig;
213M parameters) was trained for 3.5 days (84
hours; 300k steps). This model is also the ba-
sis for recent work on neural architecture search
(NAS) for machine translation and language mod-
eling (So et al., 2019), and the NLP pipeline that
we study in more detail in §4.2 (Strubell et al.,
2018). So et al. (2019) report that their full ar-
chitecture search ran for a total of 979M training
steps, and that their base model requires 10 hours
to train for 300k steps on one TPUv2 core. This
equates to 32,623 hours of TPU or 274,120 hours
on 8 P100 GPUs.
ELMo. The ELMo model (Peters et al., 2018)
is based on stacked LSTMs and provides rich
word representations in context by pre-training on
a large amount of data using a language model-
ing objective. Replacing context-independent pre-
trained word embeddings with ELMo has been
shown to increase performance on downstream
tasks such as named entity recognition, semantic
role labeling, and coreference. Peters et al. (2018)
report that ELMo was trained on 3 NVIDIA GTX
1080 GPUs for 2 weeks (336 hours).
BERT. The BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) pro-
vides a Transformer-based architecture for build-
ing contextual representations similar to ELMo,
but trained with a different language modeling ob-
jective. BERT substantially improves accuracy on
tasks requiring sentence-level representations such

as question answering and natural language infer-
ence. Devlin et al. (2019) report that the BERT
base model (BERTbase; 110M parameters) was
trained on 16 TPU chips for 4 days (96 hours).
NVIDIA reports that they can train a BERT model
in 3.3 days (79.2 hours) using 4 DGX-2H servers,
totaling 64 Tesla V100 GPUs (Forster et al., 2019).
GPT-2. This model is the latest edition of
OpenAI’s GPT general-purpose token encoder,
also based on Transformer-style self-attention and
trained with a language modeling objective (Rad-
ford et al., 2019). By training a very large model
on massive data, Radford et al. (2019) show high
zero-shot performance on question answering and
language modeling benchmarks. The large model
described in Radford et al. (2019) has 1542M pa-
rameters and is reported to require 1 week (168
hours) of training on 32 TPUv3 chips. 6

3 Related work

There is some precedent for work characterizing
the computational requirements of training and in-
ference in modern neural network architectures in
the computer vision community. Li et al. (2016)
present a detailed study of the energy use required
for training and inference in popular convolutional
models for image classification in computer vi-
sion, including fine-grained analysis comparing
different neural network layer types. Canziani
et al. (2016) assess image classification model ac-
curacy as a function of model size and gigaflops
required during inference. They also measure av-
erage power draw required during inference on
GPUs as a function of batch size. Neither work an-
alyzes the recurrent and self-attention models that
have become commonplace in NLP, nor do they
extrapolate power to estimates of carbon and dol-
lar cost of training.

Analysis of hyperparameter tuning has been
performed in the context of improved algorithms
for hyperparameter search (Bergstra et al., 2011;
Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Snoek et al., 2012). To
our knowledge there exists to date no analysis of
the computation required for R&D and hyperpa-
rameter tuning of neural network models in NLP.

4 Experimental results

4.1 Cost of training

Table 3 lists CO2 emissions and estimated cost of
training the models described in §2.1. Of note is
that TPUs are more cost-efficient than GPUs on
workloads that make sense for that hardware (e.g.
BERT). We also see that models emit substan-
tial carbon emissions; training BERT on GPU is
roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight. So
et al. (2019) report that NAS achieves a new state-
of-the-art BLEU score of 29.7 for English to Ger-
man machine translation, an increase of just 0.1
BLEU at the cost of at least $150k in on-demand
compute time and non-trivial carbon emissions.

4.2 Cost of development: Case study

To quantify the computational requirements of
R&D for a new model we study the logs of
all training required to develop Linguistically-
Informed Self-Attention (Strubell et al., 2018), a
multi-task model that performs part-of-speech tag-
ging, labeled dependency parsing, predicate detec-
tion and semantic role labeling. This model makes
for an interesting case study as a representative
NLP pipeline and as a Best Long Paper at EMNLP.

Model training associated with the project
spanned a period of 172 days (approx. 6 months).
During that time 123 small hyperparameter grid
searches were performed, resulting in 4789 jobs
in total. Jobs varied in length ranging from a min-
imum of 3 minutes, indicating a crash, to a maxi-
mum of 9 days, with an average job length of 52
hours. All training was done on a combination of
NVIDIA Titan X (72%) and M40 (28%) GPUs.8

The sum GPU time required for the project
totaled 9998 days (27 years). This averages to

about 60 GPUs running constantly throughout the
6 month duration of the project. Table 4 lists upper
and lower bounds of the estimated cost in terms
of Google Cloud compute and raw electricity re-
quired to develop and deploy this model.9 We see
that while training a single model is relatively in-
expensive, the cost of tuning a model for a new
dataset, which we estimate here to require 24 jobs,
or performing the full R&D required to develop
this model, quickly becomes extremely expensive.

5 Conclusions

Authors should report training time and
sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Our experiments suggest that it would be benefi-
cial to directly compare different models to per-
form a cost-benefit (accuracy) analysis. To ad-
dress this, when proposing a model that is meant
to be re-trained for downstream use, such as re-
training on a new domain or fine-tuning on a new
task, authors should report training time and com-
putational resources required, as well as model
sensitivity to hyperparameters. This will enable
direct comparison across models, allowing subse-
quent consumers of these models to accurately as-
sess whether the required computational resources

are compatible with their setting. More explicit
characterization of tuning time could also reveal
inconsistencies in time spent tuning baseline mod-
els compared to proposed contributions. Realiz-
ing this will require: (1) a standard, hardware-
independent measurement of training time, such
as gigaflops required to convergence, and (2) a
standard measurement of model sensitivity to data
and hyperparameters, such as variance with re-
spect to hyperparameters searched.

Academic researchers need equitable access to
computation resources.

Recent advances in available compute come at a
high price not attainable to all who desire access.
Most of the models studied in this paper were de-
veloped outside academia; recent improvements in
state-of-the-art accuracy are possible thanks to in-
dustry access to large-scale compute.

Limiting this style of research to industry labs
hurts the NLP research community in many ways.
First, it stifles creativity. Researchers with good
ideas but without access to large-scale compute
will simply not be able to execute their ideas,
instead constrained to focus on different prob-
lems. Second, it prohibits certain types of re-
search on the basis of access to financial resources.
This even more deeply promotes the already prob-
lematic “rich get richer” cycle of research fund-
ing, where groups that are already successful and
thus well-funded tend to receive more funding
due to their existing accomplishments. Third, the
prohibitive start-up cost of building in-house re-
sources forces resource-poor groups to rely on
cloud compute services such as AWS, Google
Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

While these services provide valuable, flexi-
ble, and often relatively environmentally friendly
compute resources, it is more cost effective for
academic researchers, who often work for non-
profit educational institutions and whose research
is funded by government entities, to pool resources
to build shared compute centers at the level of
funding agencies, such as the U.S. National Sci-
ence Foundation. For example, an off-the-shelf
GPU server containing 8 NVIDIA 1080 Ti GPUs
and supporting hardware can be purchased for
approximately $20,000 USD. At that cost, the
hardware required to develop the model in our
case study (approximately 58 GPUs for 172 days)
would cost $145,000 USD plus electricity, about

half the estimated cost to use on-demand cloud
GPUs. Unlike money spent on cloud compute,
however, that invested in centralized resources
would continue to pay off as resources are shared
across many projects. A government-funded aca-
demic compute cloud would provide equitable ac-
cess to all researchers.

Researchers should prioritize computationally
efficient hardware and algorithms.

We recommend a concerted effort by industry and
academia to promote research of more computa-
tionally efficient algorithms, as well as hardware
that requires less energy. An effort can also be
made in terms of software. There is already a
precedent for NLP software packages prioritizing
efficient models. An additional avenue through
which NLP and machine learning software de-
velopers could aid in reducing the energy asso-
ciated with model tuning is by providing easy-
to-use APIs implementing more efficient alterna-
tives to brute-force grid search for hyperparameter
tuning, e.g. random or Bayesian hyperparameter
search techniques (Bergstra et al., 2011; Bergstra
and Bengio, 2012; Snoek et al., 2012). While
software packages implementing these techniques
do exist,10 they are rarely employed in practice
for tuning NLP models. This is likely because
their interoperability with popular deep learning
frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow is
not optimized, i.e. there are not simple exam-
ples of how to tune TensorFlow Estimators using
Bayesian search. Integrating these tools into the
workflows with which NLP researchers and practi-
tioners are already familiar could have notable im-
pact on the cost of developing and tuning in NLP.
