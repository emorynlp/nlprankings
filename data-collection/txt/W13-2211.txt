Abstract

This paper describes TÜBİTAK-BİLGEM
statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tems submitted to the Eighth Work-
shop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (WMT) shared translation task for
German-English language pair in both di-
rections. We implement phrase-based
SMT systems with standard parameters.
We present the results of using a big tun-
ing data and the effect of averaging tun-
ing weights of different seeds. Addition-
ally, we performed a linguistically moti-
vated compound splitting in the German-
to-English SMT system.

1 Introduction

TÜBİTAK-BİLGEM participated for the first time
in the WMT’13 shared translation task for the
German-English language pairs in both directions.
We implemented a phrase-based SMT system by
using the entire available training data. In the
German-to-English SMT system, we performed a
linguistically motivated compound splitting. We
tested different language model (LM) combina-
tions by using the parallel data, monolingual data,
and Gigaword v4. In each step, we tuned systems
with five different tune seeds and used the average
of tuning weights in the final system. We tuned
our systems on a big tuning set which is generated
from the last years’ (2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012)
development sets. The rest of the paper describes
the details of our systems.

2.1 Baseline

All available data was tokenized, truecased, and
the maximum number of tokens were fixed to
70 for the translation model. The Moses open
SMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) was used with

MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) with the stan-
dard alignment heuristic grow-diag-final (Och and
Ney, 2003) for word alignments. Good-Turing
smoothing was used for phrase extraction. Sys-
tems were tuned on newstest2012 with MERT
(Och, 2003) and tested on newstest2011. 4-
gram language models (LMs) were trained on
the target side of the parallel text and the mono-
lingual data by using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)
toolkit with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and
Ney, 1995) and then binarized by using KenLM
toolkit (Heafield, 2011). At each step, systems
were tuned with five different seeds with lattice-
samples. Minimum Bayes risk decoding (Kumar
and Byrne, 2004) and -drop-unknown parameters
were used during the decoding.

This configuration is common for all of the ex-
periments decribed in this paper unless stated oth-
erwise. Table 1 shows the number of sentences
used in system training after the clean-corpus pro-
cess.

Data Number of sentences
Europarl 1908574
News-Commentary 177712
Commoncrawl 726458

Table 1: Parallel Corpus.

We trained two baseline systems in order to as-
sess the effects of this year’s new parallel data,
commoncrawl. We first trained an SMT system
by using only the training data from the previ-
ous WMT shared translation tasks that is europarl
and news-commentary (Baseline1). As the second
baseline, we also included the new parallel data
commoncrawl only in the translation model (Base-
line2). Then, we included commoncrawl corpus
both to the translation model and the language
model (Baseline3).

Table 2 compares the baseline results. For all

109



experiments throughout the paper, we present the
minimum and the maximum BLEU scores ob-
tained after five different tunes. As seen in the
table, the addition of the commoncrawl corpus re-
sultedin a 1.1 BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) points
improvement (on average) on the test set. Al-
though Baseline2 is slightly better than Baseline3,
we used Baseline3 and kept commoncrawl corpus
in LMs for further experiments.

2.2 Bayesian Alignment

In the original IBM models (Brown et al., 1993),
word translation probabilities are treated as model
parameters and the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm is used to obtain the maximum-
likelihood estimates of the parameters and the
resulting distributions on alignments. However,
EM provides a point-estimate, not a distribu-
tion, for the parameters. The Bayesian align-
ment on the other hand takes into account all
values of the model parameters by treating them
as multinomial-distributed random variables with
Dirichlet priors and integrating over all possible
values. A Bayesian approach to word alignment
inference in IBM Models is shown to result in sig-
nificantly less “garbage collection” and a much
more compact alignment dictionary. As a result,
the Bayesian word alignment has better transla-
tion performances and obtains significant BLEU
improvements over EM on various language pairs,
data sizes, and experimental settings (Mermer et
al., 2013).

We compared the translation performance of
word alignments obtained via Bayesian inference
to those obtained via EM algorithm. We used a
a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in
HMM alignment model, integrating over all pos-
sible parameter values in finding the alignment
distribution by using Baseline3 word alignments
for initialization. Table 3 compares the Bayesian
alignment to the EM alignment. The results show
a slight increase in the development set newstest12
but a decrease of 0.1 BLEU points on average in
the test set newstest11.

2.3 Development Data in Training

Development data from the previous years (i.e.
newstest08, newstest09, newstest10), though being
a small set of corpus (7K sentences), is in-domain
data and can positively affect the translation sys-
tem. In order to make use of this data, we exper-
imented two methods: i) adding the development
data in the translation model as described in this
section and ii) using it as a big tuning set for tun-
ing the parameters more efficiently as explained in
the next section.

Similar to including the commoncrawl corpus,
we first add the development data both to the train-
ing and language models by concatenating it to the
biggest corpus europarl (DD(tm+lm)) and then
we removed this corpus from the language models
(DD(tm)). Results in Table 4 show that including
the development data both the tranining and lan-
guage model increases the performance in devel-
opment set but decreases the performance in the
test set. Including the data only in the translation
model shows a very slight improvement in the test
set.

DD(tm) 21.23|21.52 20.26|20.49

Table 4: Development Sets Results.

2.4 Tuning with a Big Development Data

The second method of making use of the develop-
ment data is to concatenate it to the tuning set. As
a baseline, we tuned the system with newstest12
as mentioned in Section 2.1. Then, we concate-
nated the development data of the previous years
with the newstest12 and built a big tuning set. Fi-
nally, we obtained a tuning set of 10K sentences.
We excluded the newstest11 as an internal test set
to see the relative improvements of different sys-
tems. Table 5 shows the results of using a big tun-
ing set. Tuning the system with a big tuning set
resulted in a 0.13 BLEU points improvement.

2.5 Effects of Different Language Models

In this set of experiments, we tested the effects
of different combinations of parallel and monolin-
gual data as language models. As the baseline, we
trained three LMs, one from each parallel corpus
as europarl, news-commentary, and commoncrawl
and one LM from the monolingual data news-
shuffled (Baseline3). We then trained two LMs,
one from the whole parallel data and one from the
monolingual data (2LMs). Table 6 shows that us-
ing whole parallel corpora as one LM performs
better than individual corpus LMs and results in
0.1 BLEU points improvement on the baseline. Fi-
nally, we trained Gigaword v4 (LDC2009T13) as a
third LM (3LMs) which gives a 0.16 BLEU points
improvement over the 2LMs.

2.6 German Preprocessing

In German, compounding is very common. From
the machine translation point of view, compounds
increase the vocabulary size with high number of
the singletons in the training data and hence de-
crease the word alignment quality. Moreover, high
number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in tun-
ing and test sets results in several German words
left as untranslated. A well-known solution to this
problem is compound splitting.

Similarly, having different word forms for a
source side lemma for the same target lemma
causes the lexical redundancy in translation. This
redundancy results in unnecessary large phrase
translation tables that overload the decoder, as a
separate phrase translation entry has to be kept for
each word form. For example, German definite de-
terminer could be marked in sixteen different ways
according to the possible combinations of genders,
case and number, which are fused in six different

tokens (e.g., der, das, die, den, dem, des). Except
for the plural and genitive cases, all these forms
are translated to the same English word “the”.

In the German preprocessing, we aimed both
normalizing lexical redundancy and splitting Ger-
man compounds with corpus driven splitting al-
gorithm based on Koehn and Knight (2003). We
used the same compound splitting and lexical re-
dundancy normalization methods described in Al-
lauzen et al. (2010) and Durgar El-Kahlout and
Yvon (2010) with minor in-house changes. We
used only “addition” (e.g., -s, -n, -en, -e, -es) and
“truncation” (e.g., -e, -en, -n) affixes for com-
pound splitting. We selected minimum candidate
length to 8 and minimum split length to 4. By us-
ing the Treetagger (Schmid, 1994) output, we in-
cluded linguistic information in compound split-
ting such as not splitting named entities and for-
eign words (CS1). We also experimented adding
# as a delimiter for the splitted words except the
last word (e.g., Finanzkrisen is splitted as finanz#
krisen) (CS2).

On top of the compound splitting, we
applied the lexical redundancy normalization
(CS+Norm1). We lemmatized German articles,
adjectives (only positive form), for some pronouns
and for nouns in order to remove the lexical re-
dundancy (e.g., Bildes as Bild) by using the fine-
grained part-of-speech tags generated by RFTag-
ger (Schmid and Laws, 2008). Similar to CS2, We
tested the delimited version of normalized words
(CS+Norm2).

Table 7 shows the results of compound split-
ting and normalization methods. As a result, nor-
malization on top of compounding did not per-
form well. Besides, experiments showed that com-
pound word decomposition is crucial and helps
vastly to improve translation results 0.43 BLEU
points on average over the best system described
in Section 2.5.

2.7 Average of Weights

As mentioned in Section 2.1, we performed tun-
ing with five different seeds. We averaged the five
tuning weights and directly applied these weights
during the decoding. Table 8 shows that using the
average of several tuning weights performs better
than each individual tuning (0.2 BLEU points).

2.8 Other parameters

In addition to the experiments described in the
earlier sections, we removed the -drop-unknown
parameter which gave us a 0.5 BLEU points im-
provement. We also included the monotone-at-
punctuation, -mp in decoding. We handled out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) words by lemmatizing the
OOV words. Moreover, we added all development
data in training after fixing the parameter weights
as described in Section 2.7. Although each of
these changes increases the translation scores each
gave less than 0.1 BLEU point improvement. Ta-
ble 9 shows the results of the final system after
including all of the approaches except the ones de-
scribed in Section 2.2 and 2.3.

3 English-German

For English-to-German translation system, the
baseline setting is the same as described in Sec-
tion 2.1. We also added the items that showed
positive improvement in the German to English
SMT system such as using 2 LMs, tuning with five
seeds and averaging tuning parameters, using -mp,
and not using -drop-unknown. Table 10 shows the
experimental results for English-to-German SMT
systems. Similar to the German-to-English direc-
tion, tuning with a big development data outper-
forms the baseline 0.26 BLEU points (on average).

Additionally, averaging the tuning weights of dif-
ferent seeds results in 0.2 BLEU points improve-
ment.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we described our submissions to
WMT’13 Shared Translation Task for German-
English language pairs. We used phrase-based
systems with a big tuning set which is a com-
bination of the development sets from last four
years. We tuned the systems on this big tuning
set with five different tunes. We averaged these
five tuning weights in the final system. We trained
4-gram language models one from parallel data
and one from monolingual data. Moreover, we
trained a 4-gram language model with Gigaword
v4 for German-to-English direction. For German-
to-English, we performed a different compound
splitting method instead of the Moses splitter. We
obtained a 1.7 BLEU point increase for German-
to-English SMT system and a 0.5 BLEU point in-
crease for English-to-German SMT system for the
internal test set newstest2011. Finally, we sub-
mitted our German-to-English SMT system with
a BLEU score 25.6 and English-to-German SMT
system with a BLEU score 19.3 for the official test
set newstest2013.
