Abstract

Predicate-argument structure contains rich se-
mantic information of which statistical ma-
chine translation hasn’t taken full advantage.
In this paper, we propose two discriminative,
feature-based models to exploit predicate-
argument structures for statistical machine
translation: 1) a predicate translation model
and 2) an argument reordering model. The
predicate translation model explores lexical
and semantic contexts surrounding a verbal
predicate to select desirable translations for
the predicate. The argument reordering model
automatically predicts the moving direction
of an argument relative to its predicate af-
ter translation using semantic features. The
two models are integrated into a state-of-the-
art phrase-based machine translation system
and evaluated on Chinese-to-English transla-
tion tasks with large-scale training data. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate that the two
models significantly improve translation accu-
racy.

1 Introduction

Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts to-
wards integrating predicate-argument structures into
statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu and Fung,
2009b; Liu and Gildea, 2010). In this paper, we take
a step forward by introducing a novel approach to in-
corporate such semantic structures into SMT. Given
a source side predicate-argument structure, we at-
tempt to translate each semantic frame (predicate
and its associated arguments) into an appropriate tar-
get string. We believe that the translation of predi-
cates and reordering of arguments are the two central

issues concerning the transfer of predicate-argument
structure across languages.

Predicates1 are essential elements in sentences.
Unfortunately they are usually neither correctly
translated nor translated at all in many SMT sys-
tems according to the error study by Wu and Fung
(2009a). This suggests that conventional lexical and
phrasal translation models adopted in those SMT
systems are not sufficient to correctly translate pred-
icates in source sentences. Thus we propose a
discriminative, feature-based predicate translation
model that captures not only lexical information
(i.e., surrounding words) but also high-level seman-
tic contexts to correctly translate predicates.

Arguments contain information for questions of
who, what, when, where, why, and how in sentences
(Xue, 2008). One common error in translating ar-
guments is about their reorderings: arguments are
placed at incorrect positions after translation. In or-
der to reduce such errors, we introduce a discrim-
inative argument reordering model that uses the
position of a predicate as the reference axis to es-
timate positions of its associated arguments on the
target side. In this way, the model predicts moving
directions of arguments relative to their predicates
with semantic features.

We integrate these two discriminative models into
a state-of-the-art phrase-based system. Experimen-
tal results on large-scale Chinese-to-English transla-
tion show that both models are able to obtain signif-
icant improvements over the baseline. Our analysis
on system outputs further reveals that they can in-
deed help reduce errors in predicate translations and
argument reorderings.

1We only consider verbal predicates in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we will introduce related work and show the signif-
icant differences between our models and previous
work. In Section 3 and 4, we will elaborate the pro-
posed predicate translation model and argument re-
ordering model respectively, including details about
modeling, features and training procedure. Section
5 will introduce how to integrate these two models
into SMT. Section 6 will describe our experiments
and results. Section 7 will empirically discuss how
the proposed models improve translation accuracy.
Finally we will conclude with future research direc-
tions in Section 8.

2 Related Work

Predicate-argument structures (PAS) are explored
for SMT on both the source and target side in some
previous work. As PAS analysis widely employs
global and sentence-wide features, it is computa-
tionally expensive to integrate target side predicate-
argument structures into the dynamic programming
style of SMT decoding (Wu and Fung, 2009b).
Therefore they either postpone the integration of tar-
get side PASs until the whole decoding procedure is
completed (Wu and Fung, 2009b), or directly project
semantic roles from the source side to the target side
through word alignments during decoding (Liu and
Gildea, 2010).

There are other previous studies that explore only
source side predicate-argument structures. Komachi
and Matsumoto (2006) reorder arguments in source
language (Japanese) sentences using heuristic rules
defined on source side predicate-argument structures
in a pre-processing step. Wu et al. (2011) automate
this procedure by automatically extracting reorder-
ing rules from predicate-argument structures and ap-
plying these rules to reorder source language sen-
tences. Aziz et al. (2011) incorporate source lan-
guage semantic role labels into a tree-to-string SMT
system.

Although we also focus on source side predicate-
argument structures, our models differ from the pre-
vious work in two main aspects: 1) we propose two
separate discriminative models to exploit predicate-
argument structures for predicate translation and ar-
gument reordering respectively; 2) we consider ar-
gument reordering as an argument movement (rel-

ative to its predicate) prediction problem and use
a discriminatively trained classifier for such predic-
tions.

Our predicate translation model is also related to
previous discriminative lexicon translation models
(Berger et al., 1996; Venkatapathy and Bangalore,
2007; Mauser et al., 2009). While previous models
predict translations for all words in vocabulary, we
only focus on verbal predicates. This will tremen-
dously reduce the amount of training data required,
which usually is a problem in discriminative lexi-
con translation models (Mauser et al., 2009). Fur-
thermore, the proposed translation model also dif-
fers from previous lexicon translation models in that
we use both lexical and semantic features. Our ex-
perimental results show that semantic features are
able to further improve translation accuracy.

3 Predicate Translation Model

In this section, we present the features and the train-
ing process of the predicate translation model.

3.1 Model

Following the context-dependent word models in
(Berger et al., 1996), we propose a discriminative
predicate translation model. The essential compo-
nent of our model is a maximum entropy classifier
pt(e|C(v)) that predicts the target translation e for
a verbal predicate v given its surrounding context
C(v). The classifier can be formulated as follows.

pt(e|C(v)) =
exp(

∑

i θifi(e, C(v)))
∑

e′ exp(
∑

i θifi(e
′, C(v)))

(1)

where fi are binary features, θi are weights of these
features. Given a source sentence which contains
N verbal predicates {vi}N1 , our predicate translation
model Mt can be denoted as

Mt =

N
∏

i=1

pt(evi |C(vi)) (2)

Note that we do not restrict the target translation
e to be a single word. We allow e to be a phrase
of length up to 4 words so as to capture multi-word
translations for a verbal predicate. For example, a
Chinese verb “u1(issue)” can be translated as “to
be issued” or “have issued” with modality words.

903



This will increase the number of classes to be pre-
dicted by the maximum entropy classifier. But ac-
cording to our observation, it is still computation-
ally tractable (see Section 3.3). If a verbal predicate
is not translated, we set e = NULL so that we can
also capture null translations for verbal predicates.

3.2 Features

The apparent advantage of discriminative lexicon
translation models over generative translation mod-
els (e.g., conventional lexical translation model as
described in (Koehn et al., 2003)) is that discrim-
inative models allow us to integrate richer contexts
(lexical, syntactic or semantic) into target translation
prediction. We use two kinds of features to predict
translations for verbal predicates: 1) lexical features
and 2) semantic features. All features are in the fol-
lowing binary form.

f(e, C(v)) =

{

1, if e = ♣ and C(v).♥ = ♠
0, else

(3)
where the symbol ♣ is a placeholder for a possible
target translation (up to 4 words), the symbol♥ indi-
cates a contextual (lexical or semantic) element for
the verbal predicate v, and the symbol ♠ represents
the value of ♥.

Lexical Features: The lexical element ♥ is
extracted from the surrounding words of verbal
predicate v. We use the preceding 3 words and
the succeeding 3 words to define the lexical con-
text for the verbal predicate v. Therefore ♥ ∈
{w−3, w−2, w−1, v, w1, w2, w3}.

Semantic Features: The semantic element ♥ is
extracted from the surrounding arguments of ver-
bal predicate v. In particular, we define a seman-
tic window centered at the verbal predicate with
6 arguments {A−3, A−2, A−1, A1, A2, A3} where
A−3 − A−1 are arguments on the left side of v
while A1 − A3 are those on the right side. Differ-
ent verbal predicates have different number of argu-
ments in different linguistic scenarios. We observe
on our training data that the number of arguments for
96.5% verbal predicates on each side (left/right) is
not larger than 3. Therefore the defined 6-argument
semantic window is sufficient to describe argument
contexts for predicates.

For each argument Ai in the defined seman-

f(e, C(v)) = 1 if and only if
e = adjourn and C(v).Ah−3 =Sn¬
e = adjourn and C(v).Ar−1 = ARGM-TMP
e = adjourn and C(v).Ah

tic window, we use its semantic role (i.e., ARG0,
ARGM-TMP and so on) Ari and head word A

h
i to

define semantic context elements ♥. If an argument
Ai does not exist for the verbal predicate v 2, we set
the value of both Ari and A

h
i to null.

Figure 1 shows a Chinese sentence with its
predicate-argument structure and English transla-
tion. The verbal predicate “>¬/adjourn” (in bold)
has 4 arguments: one in an ARG0 agent role, one
in an ARGM-ADV adverbial modifier role, one in
an ARGM-TMP temporal modifier role and the last
one in an ARG1 patient role. Table 1 shows several
semantic feature examples of this verbal predicate.

3.3 Training

In order to train the discriminative predicate transla-
tion model, we first parse source sentences and la-
beled semantic roles for all verbal predicates (see
details in Section 6.1) in our word-aligned bilingual
training data. Then we extract all training events for
verbal predicates which occur at least 10 times in
the training data. A training event for a verbal predi-
cate v consists of all contextual elements C(v) (e.g.,
w1, Ah1 ) defined in the last section and the target
translation e. Using these events, we train one max-
imum entropy classifier per verbal predicate (16,121
verbs in total) via the off-the-shelf MaxEnt toolkit3.
We perform 100 iterations of the L-BFGS algorithm
implemented in the training toolkit for each verbal
predicate with both Gaussian prior and event cutoff
set to 1 to avoid overfitting. After event cutoff, we
have an average of 140 classes (target translations)
per verbal predicate with the maximum number of
classes being 9,226. The training takes an average of
52.6 seconds per verb. In order to expedite the train-

2For example, the verb v has only two arguments on its left
side. Thus argument A−3 doest not exist.

ing, we run the training toolkit in a parallel manner.

4 Argument Reordering Model

In this section we introduce the discriminative ar-
gument reordering model, features and the training
procedure.

4.1 Model

Since the predicate determines what arguments are
involved in its semantic frame and semantic frames
tend to be cohesive across languages (Fung et al.,
2006), the movements of predicate and its arguments
across translations are like the motions of a planet
and its satellites. Therefore we consider the reorder-
ing of an argument as the motion of the argument
relative to its predicate. In particular, we use the po-
sition of the predicate as the reference axis. The mo-
tion of associated arguments relative to the reference
axis can be roughly divided into 3 categories4: 1) no
change across languages (NC); 2) moving from the
left side of its predicate to the right side of the predi-
cate after translation (L2R); and 3) moving from the
right side of its predicate to the left side of the pred-
icate after translation (R2L).

Let’s revisit Figure 1. The ARG0, ARGM-ADV
and ARG1 are located at the same side of their predi-
cate after being translated into English, therefore the
reordering category of these three arguments is as-
signed as “NC”. The ARGM-TMP is moved from
the left side of “>¬/adjourn” to the right side of
“adjourn” after translation, thus its reordering cate-
gory is L2R.

In order to predict the reordering category for
an argument, we propose a discriminative argu-
ment reordering model that uses a maximum en-

interrupted by their predicates, other arguments or any words
outside the arguments in question. We leave for future research
the task of determining whether arguments should be translated
as a unit or not.

lows.

∑

i θifi(m, C(A)))
∑

m′ exp(
∑

i θifi(m
′, C(A)))

(4)

where C(A) indicates the surrounding context of A.
The features fi will be introduced in the next sec-
tion. We assume that motions of arguments are in-
dependent on each other. Given a source sentence
with labeled arguments {Ai}N1 , our discriminative
argument reordering model Mr is formulated as

Mr =

N
∏

i=1

pr(mAi |C(Ai)) (5)

4.2 Features

The features fi used in the argument reordering
model still takes the binary form as in Eq. (3). Table
2 shows the features that are used in the argument
reordering model. We extract features from both the
source and target side. On the source side, the fea-
tures include the verbal predicate, the semantic role
of the argument, the head word and the boundary
words of the argument. On the target side, the trans-
lation of the verbal predicate, the translation of the
head word of the argument, as well as the boundary
words of the translation of the argument are used as
features.

4.3 Training

To train the argument reordering model, we first ex-
tract features defined in the last section from our
bilingual training data where source sentences are
annotated with predicate-argument structures. We
also study the distribution of argument reordering
categories (i.e.,NC, L2R and R2L) in the training
data, which is shown in Table 3. Most arguments,
accounting for 82.43%, are on the same side of their
verbal predicates after translation. The remaining

arguments (17.57%) are moved either from the left
side of their predicates to the right side after transla-
tion (accounting for 11.19%) or from the right side
to the left side of their translated predicates (ac-
counting for 6.38%).

After all features are extracted, we use the maxi-
mum entropy toolkit in Section 3.3 to train the maxi-
mum entropy classifier as formulated in Eq. (4). We
perform 100 iterations of L-BFGS.

5 Integrating the Two Models into SMT

In this section, we elaborate how to integrate the two
models into phrase-based SMT. In particular, we in-
tegrate the models into a phrase-based system which
uses bracketing transduction grammars (BTG) (Wu,
1997) for phrasal translation (Xiong et al., 2006).
Since the system is based on a CKY-style decoder,
the integration algorithms introduced here can be
easily adapted to other CKY-based decoding sys-
tems such as the hierarchical phrasal system (Chi-
ang, 2007).

5.1 Integrating the Predicate Translation
Model

It is straightforward to integrate the predicate trans-
lation model into phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al.,

2003; Xiong et al., 2006). We maintain word
alignments for each phrase pair in the phrase ta-
ble. Given a source sentence with its predicate-
argument structure, we detect all verbal predicates
and load trained predicate translation classifiers for
these verbs. Whenever a hypothesis covers a new
verbal predicate v, we find the target translation e
for v through word alignments and then calculate its
translation probability pt(e|C(v)) according to Eq.
(1).

The predicate translation model (as formulated in
Eq. (2)) is integrated into the whole log-linear model
just like the conventional lexical translation model
in phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003). The
two models are independently estimated but comple-
mentary to each other. While the lexical translation
model calculates the probability of a verbal predi-
cate being translated given its local lexical context,
the discriminative predicate translation model is able
to employ both lexical and semantic contexts to pre-
dict translations for verbs.

5.2 Integrating the Argument Reordering
Model

Before we introduce the integration algorithm for
the argument reordering model, we define two
functions A and N on a source sentence and its
predicate-argument structure τ as follows.

• A(i, j, τ): from the predicate-argument struc-
ture τ , the function finds all predicate-argument
pairs which are completely located within the
span from source word i to j. For example, in
Figure 1, A(3, 6, τ) = {(>¬, ARGM-TMP)}
while A(2, 3, τ) = {}, A(1, 5, τ) = {} because
the verbal predicate “>¬” is located outside
the span (2,3) and (1,5).

• N (i, k, j, τ): the function finds all predicate-
argument pairs that cross the two neighboring
spans (i, k) and (k+1, j). It can be formulated
as A(i, j, τ)− (A(i, k, τ)

⋃

A(k + 1, j, τ)).

We then define another function Pr to calculate
the argument reordering model probability on all ar-
guments which are found by the previous two func-
tions A and N as follows.

Pr(B) =
∏

A∈B

pr(mA|C(A)) (6)

906



where B denotes either A or N .
Following (Chiang, 2007), we describe the algo-

rithm in a deductive system. It is shown in Figure
2. The algorithm integrates the argument reordering
model into a CKY-style decoder (Xiong et al., 2006).
The item [X, i, j] denotes a BTG node X spanning
from i to j on the source side. For notational con-
venience, we only show the argument reordering
model probability for each item, ignoring all other
sub-model probabilities such as the language model
probability. The Eq. (7) shows how we calculate the
argument reordering model probability when a lex-
ical rule is applied to translate a source phrase c to
a target phrase e. The Eq. (8) shows how we com-
pute the argument reordering model probability for a
span (i, j) in a dynamic programming manner when
a merging rule is applied to combine its two sub-
spans in a straight (X → [X1, X2]) or inverted or-
der (X → 〈X1, X2〉). We directly use the probabili-
ties Pr(A(i, k, τ)) and Pr(A(k + 1, j, τ)) that have
been already obtained for the two sub-spans (i, k)
and (k + 1, j). In this way, we only need to calcu-
late the probability Pr(N (i, k, j, τ)) for predicate-
argument pairs that cross the two sub-spans.

6 Experiments

In this section, we present our experiments on
Chinese-to-English translation tasks, which are
trained with large-scale data. The experiments are
aimed at measuring the effectiveness of the proposed
discriminative predicate translation model and argu-
ment reordering model.

6.1 Setup

The baseline system is the BTG-based phrasal sys-
tem (Xiong et al., 2006). Our training corpora5

consist of 3.8M sentence pairs with 96.9M Chinese
words and 109.5M English words. We ran GIZA++
on these corpora in both directions and then applied
the “grow-diag-final” refinement rule to obtain word
alignments. We then used all these word-aligned
corpora to generate our phrase table. Our 5-gram
language model was trained on the Xinhua section
of the English Gigaword corpus (306 million words)

5The corpora include LDC2004E12, LDC2004T08,
LDC2005T10, LDC2003E14, LDC2002E18, LDC2005T06,
LDC2003E07 and LDC2004T07.

using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with modi-
fied Kneser-Ney smoothing.

To train the proposed predicate translation model
and argument reordering model, we first parsed all
source sentences using the Berkeley Chinese parser
(Petrov et al., 2006) and then ran the Chinese se-
mantic role labeler6 (Li et al., 2010) on all source
parse trees to annotate semantic roles for all verbal
predicates. After we obtained semantic roles on the
source side, we extracted features as described in
Section 3.2 and 4.2 and used these features to train
our two models as described in Section 3.3 and 4.3.

We used the NIST MT03 evaluation test data as
our development set, and the NIST MT04, MT05
as the test sets. We adopted the case-insensitive
BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002) as the evaluation
metric. Statistical significance in BLEU differences
was tested by paired bootstrap re-sampling (Koehn,
2004).

6.2 Results

Our first group of experiments is to investigate
whether the predicate translation model is able to
improve translation accuracy in terms of BLEU and
whether semantic features are useful. The experi-
mental results are shown in Table 4. From the table,
we have the following two observations.

• The proposed predicate translation models
achieve an average improvement of 0.57 BLEU
points across the two NIST test sets when all
features (lex+sem) are used. Such an improve-
ment is statistically significant (p < 0.01). Ac-
cording to our statistics, there are 5.07 verbal
predicates per sentence in NIST04 and 4.76
verbs per sentence in NIST05, which account
for 18.02% and 16.88% of all words in NIST04
and 05 respectively. This shows that not only
verbal predicates are semantically important,
they also form a major part of the sentences.
Therefore, whether verbal predicates are trans-
lated correctly or not has a great impact on the
translation accuracy of the whole sentence 7.

7The example in Table 6 shows that the translations of

verbs even influences reorderings and translations of neighbor-
ing words.

• When we integrate both lexical and semantic
features (lex+sem) described in Section 3.2, we
obtain an improvement of about 0.33 BLEU
points over the system where only lexical fea-
tures (lex) are used. Such a gain, which is sta-
tistically significant, confirms the effectiveness
of semantic features.

Our second group of experiments is to validate
whether the argument reordering model is capable
of improving translation quality. Table 5 shows the
results. We obtain an average improvement of 0.4
BLEU points on the two test sets over the base-
line when we incorporate the proposed argument re-
ordering model into our system. The improvements
on the two test sets are both statistically significant
(p < 0.01).

Finally, we integrate both the predicate translation
model and argument reordering model into the final
system. The two models collectively achieve an im-

provement of up to 0.92 BLEU points over the base-
line, which is shown in Table 5.

7 Analysis

In this section, we conduct some case studies to
show how the proposed models improve translation
accuracy by looking into the differences that they
make on translation hypotheses.

Table 6 displays a translation example which
shows the difference between the baseline and
the system enhanced with the predicate translation
model. There are two verbal predicates “` /head
to” and “ë\/attend” in the source sentence. In
order to get the most appropriate translations for
these two verbal predicates, we should adopt differ-
ent ways to translate them. The former should be
translated as a corresponding verb word or phrase
while the latter into a preposition word “for”. Unfor-
tunately, the baseline incorrectly translates the two
verbs. Furthermore, such translation errors even re-
sult in undesirable reorderings of neighboring words
“Ë|ð/Bethlehem and “g/mass”. This indi-
cates that verbal predicate translation errors may
lead to more errors, such as inappropriate reorder-
ings or lexical choices for neighboring words. On
the contrary, we can see that our predicate transla-
tion model is able to help select appropriate words
for both verbs. The correct translations of these two
verbs also avoid incorrect reorderings of neighbor-
ing words.

Table 7 shows another example to demonstrate
how the argument reordering model improve re-
orderings. The verbal predicate “?1/carry out”
has three arguments, ARG0, ARG-ADV and ARG1.
The ARG1 argument should be moved from the
right side of the predicate to its left side after trans-
lation. The ARG0 argument can either stay on the
left side or move to right side of the predicate. Ac-

Table 7: A translation example showing the difference between the baseline and the system with the argument re-
ordering model (ARM). The predicate-argument structure (PAS) of the source sentence is also displayed in the first
row.

cording to the phrase alignments of the baseline,
we clearly observe three serious translation errors:
1) the ARG0 argument is translated into separate
groups which are not adjacent on the target side;
2) the predicate is not translated at all; and 3) the
ARG1 argument is not moved to the left side of the
predicate after translation. All of these 3 errors are
avoided in the Base+ARM system output as a re-
sult of the argument reordering model that correctly
identifies arguments and moves them in the right di-
rections.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented two discriminative models to
incorporate source side predicate-argument struc-
tures into SMT. The two models have been inte-
grated into a phrase-based SMT system and evalu-
ated on Chinese-to-English translation tasks using
large-scale training data. The first model is the pred-
icate translation model which employs both lexical
and semantic contexts to translate verbal predicates.

The second model is the argument reordering model
which estimates the direction of argument move-
ment relative to its predicate after translation. Ex-
perimental results show that both models are able to
significantly improve translation accuracy in terms
of BLEU score.

In the future work, we will extend our predicate
translation model to translate both verbal and nom-
inal predicates. Nominal predicates also frequently
occur in Chinese sentences and thus accurate trans-
lations of them are desirable for SMT. We also want
to address another translation issue of arguments as
shown in Table 7: arguments are wrongly translated
into separate groups instead of a cohesive unit (Wu
and Fung, 2009a). We will build an argument seg-
mentation model that follows (Xiong et al., 2011) to
determine whether arguments should be translated
as a unit or not.
