Abstract

We present a statistical model for canonicalizing
named entity mentions into a table whose rows rep-
resent entities and whose columns are attributes (or
parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it
incorporates entity context, surface features, first-
order dependencies among attribute-parts, and a no-
tion of noise. Transductive learning from a few
seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines
Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We
evaluate our model and its components on two
datasets collected from political blogs and sports
news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglom-
erative clustering approach and previous work.

1 Introduction

Proper handling of mentions in text of real-world
entities—identifying and resolving them—is a cen-
tral part of many NLP applications. We seek an al-
gorithm that infers a set of real-world entities from
mentions in a text, mapping each entity mention to-
ken to an entity, and discovers general categories of
words used in names (e.g., titles and last names).
Here, we use a probabilistic model to infer a struc-
tured representation of canonical forms of entity at-
tributes through transductive learning from named
entity mentions with a small number of seeds (see
Table 1). The input is a collection of mentions found
by a named entity recognizer, along with their con-
texts, and, following Eisenstein et al. (2011), the
output is a table in which entities are rows (the num-
ber of which is not pre-specified) and attribute words
are organized into columns.

This paper contributes a model that builds on the
approach of Eisenstein et al. (2011), but also:
• incorporates context of the mention to help with

disambiguation and to allow mentions that do not
share words to be merged liberally;
• conditions against shape features, which improve

the assignment of words to columns;

• is designed to explicitly handle some noise; and
• is learned using elements of Bayesian inference

with conditional estimation (see §2).
We experiment with variations of our model,

comparing it to a baseline clustering method and the
model of Eisenstein et al. (2011), on two datasets,
demonstrating improved performance over both at
recovering a gold standard table. In a political
blogs dataset, the mentions refer to political fig-
ures in the United States (e.g., Mrs. Obama and
Michelle Obama). As a result, the model discov-
ers parts of names—〈Mrs., Michelle, Obama〉—
while simultaneously performing coreference res-
olution for named entity mentions. In the sports
news dataset, the model is provided with named en-
tity mentions of heterogenous types, and success
here consists of identifying the correct team for ev-
ery player (e.g., Kobe Bryant and Los Angeles Lak-
ers). In this scenario, given a few seed examples,
the model begins to identify simple relations among
named entities (in addition to discovering attribute
structures), since attributes are expressed as named
entities across multiple mentions. We believe this
adaptability is important, as the salience of different
kinds of names and their usages vary considerably
across domains.

2 Model

We begin by assuming as input a set of mention to-
kens, each one or more words. In our experiments
these are obtained by running a named entity recog-
nizer. The output is a table in which rows are un-
derstood to correspond to entities (types, not men-
tion tokens) and columns are fields, each associated
with an attribute or a part of it. Our approach is
based on a probabilistic graphical model that gener-
ates the mentions, which are observed, and the table,
which is mostly unobserved, similar to Eisenstein et
al. (2011). Our learning procedure is a hybrid of
Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. The
generative story, depicted in Figure 1, is:
• For each column j ∈ {1, . . . , C}:
◦ Draw a multinomial distribution φj over the

vocabulary from a Dirichlet process: φj ∼
DP(αj , G0). This is the lexicon for field j.
◦ Generate table entries. For each row i (of which

there are infinitely many), draw an entry xi,j
for cell i, j from φj . A few of these entries (the
seeds) are observed; we denote those x̃.
◦ Draw weights βj that associate shape and po-

sitional features with columns from a 0-mean,
µ-variance Laplace distribution.

• Generate the distribution over entities to be men-
tioned in general text: η ∼ GEM(τ) (“stick-
breaking” distribution).
• Generate context distributions. For each row r:
◦ Draw a multinomial over the context vocabu-

lary (distinct from mention vocabulary) from a
Dirichlet distribution, θr ∼ Dir(λ).

• For each mention token m:
◦ Draw an entity/row r ∼ η.
◦ For each word in the mention w, given some of

its features f (assumed observed):
. Choose a column c ∼ 1Z exp(β>c f). This

uses a log-linear distribution with partition
function Z. In one variation of our model,
first-order dependencies among the columns
are enabled; these introduce a dynamic char-
acter to the graphical model that is not shown
in Figure 1.

. With probability 1 − �, set the text wm` to
be xrc. Otherwise, generate any word from a
unigram-noise distribution.

◦ Generate mention context. For each of the T =
10 context positions (five before and five after
the mention), draw the word s from θr.

Our choices of prior distributions reflect our be-
liefs about the shapes of the various distributions.
We expect field lexicons φj and the distributions
over mentioned entities η to be “Zipfian” and so use
tools from nonparametric statistics to model them.
We expect column-feature weights β to be mostly
zero, so a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior is used
(Tibshirani, 1996).

Our goal is to maximize the conditional likeli-
hood of most of the evidence (mentions, contexts,
and seeds), p(w, s, x̃ | α,β, λ, τ, µ, �,f) =

with respect to β and τ . We fix α (see §3.3 for the
values of α for each dataset), λ = 2 (equivalent to
add-one smoothing), µ = 2 × 10−8, � = 10−10,
and each mention word’s f . Fixing λ, µ, and α is
essentially just “being Bayesian,” or fixing a hyper-
parameter based on prior beliefs. Fixing f is quite
different; it is conditioning our model on some ob-
servable features of the data, in this case word shape
features. We do this to avoid integrating over fea-
ture vector values. These choices highlight that the
design of a probabilistic model can draw from both
Bayesian and discriminative tools. Observing some
of x as seeds (x̃) renders this approach transductive.

Exact inference in this model is intractable, so we
resort to an approximate inference technique based
on Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. The opti-
mization of β can be described as “contrastive” esti-
mation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), in which some as-
pects of the data are conditioned against for compu-
tational convenience. The optimization of τ can be
described as “empirical Bayesian” estimation (Mor-
ris, 1983) in which the parameters of a prior are
fit to data. Our overall learning procedure is a
Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm
(Wei and Tanner, 1990).

3 Learning and Inference

Our learning procedure is an iterative algorithm con-
sisting of two steps. In the E-step, we perform col-
lapsed Gibbs sampling to obtain distributions over
row and column indices for every mention, given the
current value of the hyperparamaters. In the M-step,
we obtain estimates for the hyperparameters, given
the current posterior distributions.

3.1 E-step
For the mth mention, we sample row index r, then
for each word wm`, we sample column index c.

3.1.1 Sampling Rows
Similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011), when we sam-

ple the row for a mention, we use Bayes’ rule and
marginalize the columns. We further incorporate
context information and a notion of noise.

p(rm = r | . . .) ∝ p(rm = r | r−m, η)
(
∏
`

∑
c p(wm` | x, rm = r, cm` = c))

(
∏
t p(smt | rm = r))

We consider each quantity in turn.
Prior. The probability of drawing a row index fol-
lows a stick breaking distribution. This allows us
to have an unbounded number of rows and let the
model infer the optimal value from data. A standard
marginalization of η gives us:

p(rm = r | r−m, τ) =
{

N−mr
N+τ if N

−m
r > 0

τ
N+τ otherwise,

where N is the number of mentions, Nr is the num-
ber of mentions assigned to row r, and N−mr is the
number of mentions assigned to row r, excludingm.
Mention likelihood. In order to compute the likeli-
hood of observing mentions in the dataset, we have
to consider a few cases. If a cell in a table has al-
ready generated a word, it can only generate that
word. This hard constraint was a key factor in the
inference algorithm of Eisenstein et al. (2011); we
speculate that softening it may reduce MCMC mix-
ing time, so introduce a notion of noise. With proba-
bility � = 10−10, the cell can generate any word. If a
cell has not generated any word, its probability still
depends on other elements of the table. With base
distribution G0,1 and marginalizing φ, we have:

p(wm` | x, rm = r, cm` = c, αc) = (1)
1− � if xrc = wm`
� if xrc 6∈ {wm`,∅}

N−m`cw
N−m`c +αc

if xrc = ∅ and Ncw > 0
G0(wm`) αcN−m`c +αc

if xrc = ∅ and Ncw = 0

where N−m`c is the number of cells in column c that
are not empty and N−m`cw is the number of cells in
column c that are set to the word wm`; both counts
excluding the current word under consideration.
Context likelihood. It is important to be able to
use context information to determine which row
a mention should go into. As a novel extension,
our model also uses surrounding words of a men-
tion as its “context”—similar context words can en-
courage two mentions that do not share any words
to be merged. We choose a Dirichlet-multinomial
distribution for our context distribution. For every
row in the table, we have a multinomial distribution
over context vocabulary θr from a Dirichlet prior λ.

1We let G0 be a uniform distribution over the vocabulary.

687



Therefore, the probability of observing the tth con-
text word for mention m is p(smt | rm = r, λ)

=

{
N−mtrs +λs−1

N−mtr +
P

v λv−V
if N−mtr > 0

λs−1P
v λv−V

otherwise,

whereN−mtr is the number of context words of men-
tions assigned to row r, N−mtrs is the number of con-
text words of mentions assigned to row r that are
smt, both excluding the current context word, and v
ranges over the context vocabulary of size V .

3.1.2 Sampling Columns
Our column sampling procedure is novel to this

work and substantially differs from that of Eisen-
stein et al. (2011). First, we note that when we sam-
ple column indices for each word in a mention, the
row index for the mention r has already been sam-
pled. Also, our model has interdependencies among
column indices of a mention.2 Standard Gibbs sam-
pling procedure breaks down these dependencies.
For faster mixing, we experiment with first-order
dependencies between columns when sampling col-
umn indices. This idea was suggested by Eisenstein
et al. (2011, footnote 1) as a way to learn structure
in name conventions. We suppressed this aspect of
the model in Figure 1 for clarity.

We sample the column index c1 for the first word
in the mention, marginalizing out probabilities of
other words in the mention. After we sample the
column index for the first word, we sample the col-
umn index c2 for the second word, fixing the pre-
vious word to be in column c1, and marginalizing
out probabilities of c3, . . . , cL as before. We repeat
the above procedure until we reach the last word
in the mention. In practice, this can be done effi-
ciently using backward probabilities computed via
dynamic programming. This kind of blocked Gibbs
sampling was proposed by Jensen et al. (1995) and
used in NLP by Mochihashi et al. (2009). We have:
p(cm` = c | . . .) ∝

p(cm` = c | fm`, β)p(cm` = c | cm`− = c−)(∑
c+
pb(cm` = c | cm`+ = c+)

)
p(wm` | x, rm = r, cm` = c, αc),

2As shown in Figure 1, column indices in a mention form
“v-structures” with the row index r. Since everyw` is observed,
there is an active path that goes through all these nodes.

where `− is the preceding word and c− is its sam-
pled index, `+ is the following word and c+ is its
possible index, and pb(·) are backward probabilities.
Alternatively, we can perform standard Gibbs sam-
pling and drop the dependencies between columns,
which makes the model rely more heavily on the fea-
tures. For completeness, we detail the computations.
Featurized log linear distribution. Our model can
use arbitrary features to choose a column index.
These features are incorporated as a log-linear dis-
tribution, p(cm` = c | fm`,β) = exp(β

>
c fm`)P

c′ exp(β
>
c′fm`)

.

The list of features used in our experiments is:
1{w is the first word in the mention}; 1{w ends
with a period}; 1{w is the last word in the men-
tion}; 1{w is a Roman numeral}; 1{w starts with
an upper-case letter}; 1{w is an Arabic number};
1{w ∈ {mr,mrs,ms,miss, dr,mdm} }; 1{w con-
tains ≥ 1 punctuation symbol}; 1{w ∈ {jr, sr}};
1{w ∈ {is, in, of, for}}; 1{w is a person entity};
1{w is an organization entity}.
Forward and backward probabilities. Since
we introduce first-order dependencies between
columns, we have forward and backward probabili-
ties, as in HMMs. However, we always sample from
left to right, so we do not need to marginalize ran-
dom variables to the left of the current variable be-
cause their values are already sampled. Our transi-
tion probabilities are as follows:

p(cm` = c | cm`− = c−) =
N−mc−,cP
c′−

N−m
c′−,c

,

whereN−mc−,c is the number of times we observe tran-
sitions from column c− to c, excluding mention m.
The forward and backward equations are simple (we
omit them for space).
Mention likelihood. Mention likelihood p(wm` |
x, rm = r, cm` = c, αc) is identical to when we
sample the row index (Eq. 1).

3.2 M-step

In the M-step, we use gradient-based optimization
routines, L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) and
OWL-QN (Andrew and Gao, 2007) respectively, to
maximize with respect to τ and β.

688



3.3 Implementation Details

We ran Gibbs sampling for 500 iterations,3 discard-
ing the first 200 for burn-in and averaging counts
over every 10th sample to reduce autocorrelation.

For each word in a mention w, we introduced 12
binary features f for our featurized log-linear distri-
bution (§3.1.2).

We then downcased all words in mentions for the
purpose of defining the table and the mention words
w. Ten context words (5 each to the left and right)
define s for each mention token.

For non-convex optimization problems like ours,
initialization is important. To guide the model to
reach a good local optimum without many restarts,
we manually initialized feature weights and put a
prior on transition probabilities to reflect phenom-
ena observed in the initial seeds. The initializer was
constructed once and not tuned across experiments.4

The M-step was performed every 50 Gibbs sampling
iterations. After inference, we filled each cell with
the word that occurred at least 80% of the time in the
averaged counts for the cell, if such a word existed.

4 Experiments

We compare several variations of our model to
Eisenstein et al. (2011) (the authors provided their
implementation to us) and a clustering baseline.

4.1 Datasets

We collected named entity mentions from two cor-
pora: political blogs and sports news. The political
blogs corpus is a collection of blog posts about poli-
tics in the United States (Eisenstein and Xing, 2010),
and the sports news corpus contains news summaries
of major league sports games (National Basketball

3On our moderate-sized datasets (see §4.1), each iteration
takes approximately three minutes on a 2.2GHz CPU.

4For the politics dataset, we set C = 6, α =
〈1.0, 1.0, 10−12, 10−15, 10−12, 10−8〉, initialized τ = 1, and
used a Dirichlet prior on transition counts such that before ob-
serving any data: N0,1 = 10, N0,5 = 5, N2,0 = 10, N2,1 =
10, N2,3 = 10, N2,4 = 5, N3,0 = 10, N3,1 = 10, N5,1 = 15
(others are set to zero). For the sports dataset, we set C = 5,
α = 〈1.0, 1.0, 10−15, 10−6, 10−6〉, initialized τ = 1, and
used a Dirichlet prior on transition counts N0,1 = 10, N2,3 =
20, N3,4 = 10 (others are set to zero). We also manually initial-
ized the weights of some features β for both datasets. These val-
ues were obtained from preliminary experiments on a smaller
sample of the datasets, and updated on the first EM iteration.

Association, National Football League, and Major
League Baseball) in 2009. Due to the large size of
the corpora, we uniformly sampled a subset of doc-
uments for each corpus and ran the Stanford NER
tagger (Finkel et al., 2005), which tagged named en-
tities mentions as person, location, and organization.
We used named entity of type person from the po-
litical blogs corpus, while we are interested in per-
son and organization entities for the sports news cor-
pus. Mentions that appear less than five times are
discarded. Table 2 summarizes statistics for both
datasets of named entity mentions.
Reference tables. We use Eisenstein et al.’s man-
ually built 125-entity (282 vocabulary items) refer-
ence table for the politics dataset. Each entity in the
table is represented by the set of all tokens that app-
pear in its references, and the tokens are placed in its
correct column. For the sports data, we obtained a
roster of all NBA, NFL, and MLB players in 2009.
We built our sports reference table using the play-
ers’ names, teams and locations, to get 3,642 play-
ers and 15,932 vocabulary items. The gold standard
table for the politics dataset is incomplete, whereas
it is complete for the sports dataset.
Seeds. Table 1 shows the seeds for both datasets.

4.2 Evaluation Scores
We propose both a row evaluation to determine
how well a model disambiguates entities and merges
mentions of the same entity and a column evaluation
to measure how well the model relates words used in
different mentions. Both scores are new for this task.

The first step in evaluation is to find a maximum
score bipartite matching between rows in the re-
sponse and reference table.5 Given the response and

5Treating each row as a set of words, we can optimize the
matching using the Jonker and Volgenant (1987) algorithm.
The column evaluation is identical, except that sets of words
that are matched are defined by columns. We use the Jaccard
similarity—for two sets A and B, |A∩B||A∪B|—for our similarity
function, Sim(i, j).

689



reference tables, xres and xref , we can compute:

Sres = 1|xres |
∑

i∈xres ,j∈xref :Match(i,j)=1 Sim(i, j)

Sref = 1|xref |
∑

i∈xres ,j∈xref :Match(i,j)=1 Sim(i, j)

where i and j denote rows, Match(i, j) is one if i and
j are matched to each other in the optimal matching
or zero otherwise. Sres is a precision-like score, and
Sref is a recall-like score.6 Column evaluation is the
same, but compares columns instead.

4.3 Baselines

Our simple baseline is an agglomerative clustering
algorithm that clusters mentions into entities using
the single-linkage criterion. Initially, each unique
mention forms its own cluster that we incremen-
tally merge together to form rows in the table. This
method requires a similarity score between two clus-
ters. For the politics dataset, we follow Eisenstein et
al. (2011) and use the string edit distance between
mention strings in each cluster to define the score.
For the sports dataset, since mentions contain per-
son and organization named entity types, our score
for clustering uses the Jaccard distance between con-
text words of the mentions. However, such cluster-
ings do not produce columns. Therefore, we first
match words in mentions of type person against
a regular expression to recognize entity attributes
from a fixed set of titles and suffixes, and the first,
middle and last names. We treat words in mentions
of type organization as a single attribute.7 As we
merge clusters together, we arrange words such that

6Eisenstein et al. (2011) used precision and recall for their
similarity function. Precision prefers a more compact response
row (or column), which unfairly penalizes situations like those
of our sports dataset, where rows are heterogeneous (e.g., in-
cluding people and organizations). Consider a response ta-
ble made up of two rows: 〈Kobe, Bryant〉 and 〈Los, Ange-
les, Lakers〉, and a reference table containing all NBA play-
ers and their team names, e.g., 〈Kobe, Bryant, Los, Angeles,
Lakers〉. Evaluating with the precision similarity function, we
will have perfect precision by matching the first row to the ref-
erence row for Kobe Bryant and the latter row to any Lakers
player. The system is not rewarded for merging the two rows
together, even if they are describing the same entity. Our eval-
uation scores, however, reward the system for accurately filling
in more cells.

7Note that the baseline system uses NER tags, list of titles
and suffixes; which are also provided to our model through the
features in §3.1.2.

all words within a column belong to the same at-
tribute, creating columns as necessary to accomo-
date multiple similar attributes as a result of merg-
ing. We can evaluate the tables produced by each
step of the clustering to obtain the entire sequence
of response-reference scores.

As a strong baseline, we also compare our ap-
proach with the original implementation of the
model of Eisenstein et al. (2011), denoted by EEA.

4.4 Results
For both the politics and sports dataset, we run the
procedure in §3.3 three times and report the results.
Politics. The results for the politics dataset are
shown in Figure 2. Our model consistently outper-
formed both baselines. We also analyze how much
each of our four main extensions (shape features,
context information, noise, and first-order column
dependencies) to EEA contributes to overall per-
formance by ablating each in turn (also shown in
Fig. 2). The best-performing complete model has
415 rows, of which 113 were matched to the ref-
erence table. Shape features are useful: remov-
ing them was detrimental, and they work even bet-
ter without column dependencies. Indeed, the best
model did not have column dependencies. Remov-
ing context features had a strong negative effect,
though perhaps this could be overcome with a more
carefully tuned initializer.

In row evaluation, the baseline system can achieve
a high reference score by creating one entity row per
unique string, but as it merges strings, the clusters
encompass more word tokens, improving response
score at the expense of reference score. With fewer
clusters, there are fewer entities in the response ta-
ble for matching and the response score suffers. Al-
though we use the same seed table in both exper-
iments, the results from EEA are below the base-
line curve because it has the additional complexity
of inferring the number of columns from data. Our
model is simpler in this regard since it assumes that
the number of columns is known (C = 6). In col-
umn evaluation, our method without column depen-
dencies was best.
Sports. The results for the sports dataset are shown
in Figure 3. Our best-performing complete model’s
response table contains 599 rows, of which 561
were matched to the reference table. In row eval-

uation, our model lies above the baseline response-
reference score curve, demonstrating its ability to
correctly identify and combine player mentions with
their team names. Similar to the previous dataset,
our model is also substantially better in column eval-
uation, indicating that it mapped mention words into
a coherent set of five columns.

4.5 Discussion
The two datasets illustrate that our model adapts to
somewhat different tasks, depending on its input.
Furthermore, fixing C (unlike EEA) does appear to
have benefits.

In the politics dataset, most of the mentions con-
tain information about people. Therefore, besides
canonicalizing named entities, the model also re-
solves within-document and cross-document coref-
erence, since it assigned a row index for every men-
tion. For example, our model learned that most men-
tions of John McCain, Sen. John McCain, Sen. Mc-
Cain, and Mr. McCain refer to the same entity. Ta-
ble 3 shows a few noteworthy entities from our com-
plete model’s output table.

Barack Obama Mr. Sen. Hussein
Michelle Obama Mrs.

Norm Coleman Sen.
Sarah Palin Ms.
John McCain Mr. Sen. Hussein

tics dataset, showing a few noteworthy correct (blue) and
incorrect (red) examples. Black indicates seeds. Though
Ms. is technically correct, there is variation in prefer-
ences and conventions. Our data include eight instances
of Ms. Palin and none of Mrs. Palin or Mrs. Sarah
Palin.

The first entity is an easy example since it only
had to complete information provided in the seed ta-
ble. The model found the correct gender-specific ti-
tle for Barack Obama, Mr.. The rest of the examples
were fully inferred from the data. The model was es-
sentially correct for the second, third, and fourth en-
tities. The last row illustrates a partially erroneous
example, in which the model confused the middle
name of John McCain, possibly because of a com-
bination of a strong prior to reuse this row and the

introduction of a notion of noise.

In the sports dataset, persons and organizations
are mentioned. Recall that success here consists of
identifying the correct team for every player. The
EEA model is not designed for this and performed
poorly. Our model can do better, since it makes use
of context information and features, and it can put a
person and an organization in one row even though
they do not share common words. Table 4 shows a
few noteworthy entities from our complete model’s
output.

Surprisingly, the model failed to infer that Derek
Jeter plays for New York Yankees, although men-
tions of the organization New York Yankees can be
found in our dataset. This is because the model did
not see enough evidence to put them in the same row.
However, it successfully inferred the missing infor-
mation for Ben Roethlisberger. The next two rows
show cases where our model successfully matched
players with their teams and put each word token to
its respective column. The most frequent error, by
far, is illustrated in the fifth row, where a player is
matched with a wrong team. Kevin Garnett plays for
the Boston Celtics, not the Los Angeles Lakers. It
shows that in some cases context information is not
adequate, and a possible improvement might be ob-
tained by providing more context to the model. The
sixth row is interesting because Dave Toub is indeed
affiliated with the Chicago Bears. However, when
the model saw a mention token The Bears, it did not
have any other columns to put the word token The,
and decided to put it in the fourth column although it
is not a location. If we added more columns, deter-
miners could become another attribute of the entities
that might go into one of these new columns.

5 Related Work

There has been work that attempts to fill predefined
templates using Bayesian nonparametrics (Haghighi
and Klein, 2010) and automatically learns template
structures using agglomerative clustering (Cham-
bers and Jurafsky, 2011). Charniak (2001) and El-
sner et al. (2009) focused specifically on names and
discovering their structure, which is a part of the
problem we consider here. More similar to our
work, Eisenstein et al. (2011) introduced a non-
parametric Bayesian approach to extract structured
databases of entities. A fundamental difference of
our approach from any of the previous work is it
maximizes conditional likelihood and thus allows
beneficial incorporation of arbitrary features.

Our model is focused on the problem of canoni-
calizing mention strings into their parts, though its r
variables (which map mentions to rows) could be in-
terpreted as (within-document and cross-document)
coreference resolution, which has been tackled us-
ing a range of probabilistic models (Li et al., 2004;
Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon and Domingos,
2008; Singh et al., 2011). We have not evaluated it
as such, believing that further work should be done
to integrate appropriate linguistic cues before such
an application.

6 Conclusions

We presented an improved probabilistic model for
canonicalizing named entities into a table. We
showed that the model adapts to different tasks de-
pending on its input and seeds, and that it improves
over state-of-the-art performance on two corpora.
