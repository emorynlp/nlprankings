Abstract

Topic Models (TM) such as Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA) are increasingly used
in Natural Language Processing applica-
tions. At this, the model parameters and
the influence of randomized sampling and
inference are rarely examined — usually,
the recommendations from the original pa-
pers are adopted. In this paper, we ex-
amine the parameter space of LDA topic
models with respect to the application of
Text Segmentation (TS), specifically target-
ing error rates and their variance across dif-
ferent runs. We find that the recommended
settings result in error rates far from opti-
mal for our application. We show substan-
tial variance in the results for different runs
of model estimation and inference, and give
recommendations for increasing the robust-
ness and stability of topic models. Run-
ning the inference step several times and se-
lecting the last topic ID assigned per token,
shows considerable improvements. Similar
improvements are achieved with the mode
method: We store all assigned topic IDs
during each inference iteration step and se-
lect the most frequent topic ID assigned to
each word. These recommendations do not
only apply to TS, but are generic enough to
transfer to other applications.

1 Introduction

With the rise of topic models such as pLSI (Hof-
mann, 2001) or LDA (Blei et al., 2003) in Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP), an increasing
number of works in the field use topic models to
map terms from a high-dimensional word space
to a lower-dimensional semantic space. TMs
are ’the new Latent Semantic Analysis’ (LSA),

(Deerwester et al., 1990), and it has been shown
that generative models like pLSI and LDA not
only have a better mathematical foundation rooted
in probability theory, but also outperform LSA in
document retrieval and classification, e.g. (Hof-
mann, 2001; Blei et al., 2003; Biro et al., 2008).
To estimate the model parameters in LDA, the ex-
act computation that was straightforward in LSA
(matrix factorization) is replaced by a randomized
Monte-Carlo sampling procedure (e.g. variational
Bayes or Gibbs sampling).

Aside from the main parameter, the number
of topics or dimensions, surprisingly little atten-
tion has been spent to understand the interac-
tions of hyperparameters, the number of sam-
pling iterations in model estimation and inter-
ference, and the stability of topic assignments
across runs using different random seeds. While
progress in the field of topic modeling is mainly
made by adjusting prior distributions (e.g. (Sato
and Nakagawa, 2010; Wallach et al., 2009)), or
defining more complex model mixtures (Heinrich,
2011), it seems unclear whether improvements,
reached on intrinsic measures like perplexity or
on application-based evaluations, are due to an
improved model structure or could originate from
sub-optimal parameter settings or literally ’bad
luck’ due to the randomized nature of the sam-
pling process.

In this paper, we address these issues by sys-
tematically sweeping the parameter space. For
this, we pick LDA since it is the most commonly
used TM in the field of NLP. To evaluate the con-
tribution of the TM, we choose the task of TS:
this task has received considerable interest from
the NLP community, standard datasets and eval-
uation measures are available for testing, and it

19



has been shown that this task considerably bene-
fits from the use of TMs, see (Misra et al., 2009;
Sun et al., 2008; Eisenstein, 2009).

This paper is organized as follows: In the next
section, we present related work regarding text
segmentation using topic models and topic model
parameter evaluations. Section 3 defines the Top-
icTiling text segmentation algorithm, which is a
simplified version of TextTiling (Hearst, 1994),
and makes direct use of topic assignments. Its
simplicity allows us to observe direct conse-
quences of LDA parameter settings. Further, we
describe the experimental setup, our application-
based evaluation methodology including the data
set and the LDA parameters we vary in Section 4.

Results of our experiments in Section 5 indi-
cate that a) there is an optimal range for the num-
ber of topics, b) there is considerable variance in
performance for different runs for both model es-
timation and inference, c) increasing the number
of sampling iterations stabilizes average perfor-
mance but does not make TMs more robust, but d)
combining the output of several independent sam-
pling runs does, and additionally leads to large er-
ror rate reductions. Similar results are obtained by
e) the mode method with less computational costs
using the most frequent topic ID that is assigned
during different inference iteration steps. In the
conclusion, we give recommendations to add sta-
bility and robustness for TMs: aside from opti-
mization of the hyperparameters, we recommend
combining the topic assignments of different in-
ference iterations, and/or of different independent
inference runs.

2 Related Work

2.1 Text Segmentation with Topic Models

Based on the observation of Halliday and Hasan
(1976) that the density of coherence relations is
higher within segments than between segments,
most algorithms compute a coherence score to
measure the difference of textual units for inform-
ing a segmentation decision. TextTiling (Hearst,
1994) relies on the simplest coherence relation –
word repetition – and computes similarities be-
tween textual units based on the similarities of
word space vectors. The task of text segmenta-
tion is to decide, for a given text, how to split this
text into segments.

Related to our algorithm (see Section 3.1) are
the approaches described in Misra et al. (2009)
and Sun et al. (2008): topic modeling is used to
alleviate the sparsity of word vectors by mapping
words into a topic space. This is done by extend-
ing the dynamic programming algorithms from
(Utiyama and Isahara, 2000; Fragkou et al., 2004)
using topic models. At this, the topic assignments
have to be inferred for each possible segment.

2.2 LDA and Topic Model Evaluation

For topic modeling, we use the widely applied
LDA (Blei et al., 2003), This model uses a train-
ing corpus of documents to create document-topic
and topic-word distributions and is parameterized
by the number of topics T as well as by two
hyperparameters. To generate a document, the
topic proportions are drawn using a Dirichlet dis-
tribution with hyperparameter α. Adjacent for
each word w a topic zdw is chosen according to
a multinomial distribution using hyperparameter
βzdw . The model is estimated using m itera-
tions of Gibbs sampling. Unseen documents can
be annotated with an existing topic model using
Bayesian inference methods. At this, Gibbs sam-
pling with i iterations is used to estimate the topic
ID for each word, given the topics of the other
words in the same sentential unit. After inference,
every word in every sentence receives a topic ID,
which is the sole information that is used by the
TopicTiling algorithm to determine the segmenta-
tion. We use the GibbsLDA implementation by
Phan and Nguyen (2007) for all our experiments.

The article of Blei et al. (2003) compares LDA
with pLSI and Mixture Unigram models using the
perplexity of the model. In a collaborative filter-
ing evaluation for different numbers of topics they
observe that using too many topics leads to over-
fitting and to worse results.

In the field of topic model evaluations, Griffiths
and Steyvers (2004) use a corpus of abstracts pub-
lished between 1991 and 2001 and evaluate model
perplexity. For this particular corpus, they achieve
the lowest perplexity using 300 topics. Further-
more, they compare different sampling methods
and show that the perplexity converges faster with
Gibbs sampling than with expectation propaga-
tion and variational Bayes. On a small artificial
testset, small variations in perplexity across dif-
ferent runs were observed in early sampling itera-
tions, but all runs converged to the same limit.

20



In Wallach et al. (2009) topic models are eval-
uated with symmetric and asymmetric hyperpa-
rameters based on the perplexity. They observe
a benefit using asymmetric parameters for α, but
cannot show improvement with asymmetric priors
for β.

3 Method

3.1 TopicTiling

For the evaluation of the topic models, a text seg-
mentation algorithm called TopicTiling is used
here. This algorithm is a newly developed al-
gorithm based on TextTiling (Hearst, 1994) and
achieves state of the art results using the Choi
dataset, which is a standard dataset for TS eval-
uation. The algorithm uses sentences as minimal
units. Instead of words, we use topic IDs that
are assigned to each word using the LDA infer-
ence running on sentence units. The LDA model
should be estimated on a corpus of documents that
is similar to the to-be-segmented documents.

To measure the coherence cp between two sen-
tences around position p, the cosine similarity
(vector dot product) between these two adjacent
sentences is computed. Each sentence is repre-
sented as a T -dimensional vector, where T is the
number of topic IDs defined in the topic model.
The t-th element of the vector contains the num-
ber of times the t-th topic is observed in the sen-
tence. Similar to the TextTiling algorithm, lo-
cal minima calculated from these similarity scores
are taken as segmentation candidates.

This is illustrated in Figure 1, where the simi-
larity scores between adjacent sentences are plot-
ted. The vertical lines in this plot indicate all local
minima found.

Figure 1: Cosine similarity scores of adjacent sen-
tences based on topic distribution vectors. Vertical
lines (solid and dashed) indicate local minima. Solid
lines mark segments that have a depth score above a
chosen threshold.

Following the TextTiling definition, not the
minimum score cp at position p itself is used, but
a depth score dp for position p computed by

di = 1/2 ∗ (cp−1 − cp + cp+1 − cp). (1)

In contrast to TextTiling, the directly neighboring
similarity scores of the local minima are used, if
they are higher than cp. When using topics instead
of words, it can be expected that sentences within
one segment have many topics in common, which
leads to cosine similarities close to 1. Further, us-
ing topic IDs instead of words greatly increases
sparsity. A minimum in the curve indicates a
change in topic distribution. Segment boundaries
are set at the positions of the n highest depth-
scores, which is common practice in text segmen-
tation algorithms. An alternative to a given n
would be the selection of segments according to
a depth score threshold.

4 Experimental Setup

As dataset the Choi dataset (Choi, 2000) is used.
This dataset is an artificially generated corpus that
consists of 700 documents. Each document con-
sists of 10 segments and each segment has 3–
11 sentences extracted from a document of the
Brown corpus. For the first setup, we perform a
10-fold Cross Validation (CV) for estimating the
TM (estimating on 630 documents at a time), for
the other setups we use 600 documents for TM
estimation and the remaining 100 documents for
testing. While we aim to neglect using the same
documents for training and testing, it is not guar-
anteed that all testing data is unseen, since the
same source sentences can find their way in sev-
eral artificially crafted ’documents’. This prob-
lem, however, applies for all evaluations on this
dataset that use any kind of training, be it LDA
models in Misra et al. (2009) or TF-IDF values in
Fragkou et al. (2004).

For the evaluation of the Topic Model in combi-
nation of Text Segmentation, we use the Pk mea-
sure (Beeferman et al., 1999), which is a stan-
dard measure for error rates in the field of TS.
This measure compares the gold standard seg-
mentation with the output of the algorithm. A
Pk value of 0 indicates a perfect segmentation,
the averaged state of the art on the Choi Dataset
is Pk = 0.0275 (Misra et al., 2009). To assess
the robustness of the TM, we sweep over varying

21



configurations of the LDA model, and plot the re-
sults using Box-and-Whiskers plots: the box in-
dicates the quartiles and the whiskers are maxi-
mal 1.5 times of the Interquartile Range (IQR) or
equal to the data point that is no greater to the 1.5
IQR. The following parameters are subject to our
exploration:

• T : Number of topics used in the LDA model.
Common values vary between 50 and 500.

• α : Hyperparameter that regulates the sparse-
ness topic-per-document distribution. Lower
values result in documents being represented
by fewer topics (Heinrich, 2004). Recom-
mended: α = 50/T (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004)

• β : Reducing β increases the sparsity of
topics, by assigning fewer terms to each
topic, which is correlated to how related
words need to be, to be assigned to a topic
(Heinrich, 2004). Recommended: β =
{0.1, 0.01} (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004;
Misra et al., 2009)

• m Model estimation iterations. Recom-
mended / common settings: m = 500−5000
(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Wallach et al.,
2009; Phan and Nguyen, 2007)

• i Inference iterations. Recommended / com-
mon settings: 100 (Phan and Nguyen, 2007)

• d Mode of topic assignments. At each in-
ference iteration step, a topic ID is assigned
to each word within a document (represented
as a sentence in our application). With this
option, we count these topic assignments for
each single word in each iteration. After all i
inference iterations, the most frequent topic
ID is chosen for each word in a document.

• r Number of inference runs: We repeat the
inference r times and assign the most fre-
quently assigned topic per word at the fi-
nal inference run for the segmentation algo-
rithm. High r values might reduce fluctua-
tions due to the randomized process and lead
to a more stable word-to-topic assignment.

All introduced parameters parameterize the TM.
We are not aware of any research that has used

several inference runs r and the mode of topic as-
signments d to increase stability and varying TM
parameters in combinations with measures other
then perplexity.

Figure 2: Box plots for different number of topics T .
Each box plot is generated from the average Pk value
of 700 documents, α = 50/T , β = 0.1, m = 1000,
i = 100, r = 1. These documents are segmented with
TopicTiling using a 10-folded CV.

Each box plot is generated from the Pk values
of 700 documents. As expected, there is a contin-
uous range of topic numbers, namely between 50
and 150 topics, where we observe the lowest Pk
values. Using too many topics leads to overfitting
of the data and too few topics result in too gen-
eral distinctions to grasp text segments. This is in
line with other studies, that determine an optimum
for T , cf. (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), which is
specific to the application and the data set.

5.2 Estimation and Inference iterations

The next step examines the robustness of the topic
model according to the number of model estima-
tion iterations m needed to achieve stable results.
600 documents are used to train the LDA model

22



that is applied by TopicTiling to segment the re-
maining 100 documents. From Figure 2 we know
that sampling 100 topics leads to good results.
To have an insight into unstable topic regions we
also inspect performance at different sampling it-
erations using 20 and 250 topics. To assess sta-
bility across different model estimation runs, we
trained 30 LDA models using different random
seeds. Each box plot in Figures 3 and 4 is gen-
erated from 30 mean values, calculated from the
Pk values of the 100 documents. The variation
indicates the score variance for the 30 different
models.

Figure 3: Box plots with different model estimation
iterations m, with T=100, α = 50/T , β = 0.1, i =
100, r = 1. Each box plot is generated from 30 mean
values calculated from 100 documents.

Using 100 topics (see Figure 3), the burn-in
phase starts with 8–10 iterations and the mean Pk
values stabilize after 40 iterations. But looking
at the inset for large m values, significant vari-
ations between the different models can be ob-
served: note that the Pk error rates are almost
double between the lower and the upper whisker.
These remain constant and do not disappear for
largerm values: The whiskers span error rates be-
tween 0.021 - 0.037 for model estimation on doc-
ument units

With 20 topics, the Pk values are worse as with
100 topics, as expected from Figure 2. Here the
convergence starts at 100 sample iterations. More
interesting results are achieved with 250 topics.
A robust range for the error rates can be found be-
tween 20 and 100 sample iterations. With more
iterations m, the results get both worse and un-

stable: as the ’natural’ topics of the collection
have to be split in too many topics in the model,
perplexity optimizations that drive the estimation
process lead to random fluctuations, which the
TopicTiling algorithm is sensitive to. Manual in-
spection of models for T = 250 revealed that in
fact many topics do not stay stable across estima-
tion iterations.

Figure 5: Figure of box plots for different inference
iterations i and m = 1000, T = 100, α = 50/T ,
β = 0.1, r = 1 .

In the next step we sweep over several infer-
ence iterations i. Starting from 5 iterations, error
rates do not change much, see Figure 5. But there
is still substantial variance, between about 0.019 -
0.038 for inference on sentence units.

5.3 Number of inference runs r

To decrease this variance, we assign the topic not
only from a singe inference run, but repeat the in-
ference calculations several times, denoted by the
parameter r. Then the frequency of assigned topic
IDs per token is counted across the r runs, and we
assign the most frequent topic ID (frequency ties
are broken randomly). The box plot for several
evaluated values of r is shown in Figure 6.

This log-scaled plot shows that both variance
and Pk error rate can be substantially decreased.
Already for r = 3, we observe a significant im-
provement in comparison to the default setting of
r = 1 and with increasing r values, the error rates
are reduced even more: for r = 20, variance and
error rates are is cut in less than half of their orig-
inal values using this simple operation.

In the previous experiment, we use the topic IDs

inference iteration step. Now, we examine some-
thing similar, but for all i inference steps of a sin-
gle inference run: we select the mode of topic
ID assignments for each word across all inference
steps. The impact of this method on error and
variance is illustrated in Figure 7. Using a sin-
gle inference iteration, the topic IDs are almost
assigned randomly. After 20 inference iterations
Pk values below 0.02 are achieved. Using further
iterations, the decrease of the error rate is only

method, the additional computational costs of this
method are much lower as the inference iterations
have to be carried out anyway in the default appli-
cation setting.

5.5 Hyperparameters α and β

In many previous works, hyperparameter settings
α = 50/T and β = {0.1, 0.01} are commonly
used. In the next series of experiments we inves-
tigate how different parameters of these both pa-
rameters can change the TS task.

For α values, shown in Figure 8, we can see
that the recommended value for T = 100 , α =

24



0.5 leads to sub-optimal results, and an error rate
reduction of about 40% can be realized by setting
α = 0.1.

Regarding values of β, we find that Pk rates
and their variance are relatively stable between
the recommended settings of 0.1 and 0.01. Values
larger than 0.1 lead to much worse performance.
Regarding variance, no patterns within the stable
range emerge, see Figure 9.

learned from this and strive at optimal system per-
formance. For this, we contrast TS results ob-
tained with the default LDA configuration with
the best systems obtained by optimization of sin-
gle parameters, as well as to a system that uses
these optimal settings for all parameters. Table 1
shows Pk error rates for the different systems. At
this, we fixed the following parameters: T = 100,
m = 500, i = 100, β = 0.1. For the computa-
tions we use 600 documents for the LDA model
estimation, apply TopicTiling and compute the er-
ror rate for the 100 remaining documents and re-
peat this 30 times with different random seeds.

We can observe a massive improvement for op-
timized single parameters. The α-tuning tuning
results in an error rate reduction of 39.77% in
comparison to the default configurations. Using
r = 20, the error rate is cut in less than half
its original value. Also for the mode mechanism
(d = true) the error rate is halved but slightly
worse than than when using the repeated infer-
ence. Using combined optimized parameters does
not result to additional error decreases. We at-
tribute the slight decline of the combined method
in both in the error rate Pk and in the variance to
complex parameter interactions that shall be ex-
amined in further work. In Figure 10, we visual-
ize these results in a density plot. It becomes clear
that repeated inference leads to slightly better and
more robust performance (higher peak) than the
mode method. We attribute the difference to sit-
uations, where there are several highly probable
topics in our sampling units, and by chance the
same one is picked for adjacent sentences that be-
long to different segments, resulting in failure to
recognize the segmentation point. However, since
the differences are miniscule, only using the mode
method might be more suitable for practical pur-
poses since its computational cost is lower.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we examined the robustness of LDA
topic models with respect to the application of
Text Segmentation by sweeping through the topic
model parameter space. To our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to systematically assess the sta-
bility of topic models in a NLP task.

The results of our experiments are summarized
as follows:

• Perform the inference r times using the same
model and choosing the assigned topic ID
per word token taken from the last infer-
ence iteration, improves both error rates and
stability across runs with different random
seeds.

• Almost equal performance in terms of er-
ror and stability is achieved with the mode
mechanism: choose the most frequent topic
ID assignment per word across inference
steps. While error rates were slightly higher
for our data set, this method is probably
preferable in practice because of its lower
computation costs.

• As found in other studies, there is a range for
the number of topics T , where optimal re-
sults are obtained. In our task, performance
showed to be robust in the range of 50 - 150
topics.

• The default setting for LDA hyperparameters
α and β can lead to sub-optimal results. Es-
pecially α should be optimized for the task at

hand, as the utility of the topic model is very
sensitive to this parameter.

• While the number of iterations for model es-
timation and inference needed for conver-
gence is depending on the number of topics,
the size of the sampling unit (document) and
the collection, it should be noted that after
convergence the variance between different
sampling runs does not decrease for a larger
number of iterations.

Equipped with the insights gained from exper-
iments on single parameter variation, we were
able to implement a very simple algorithm for text
segmentation that improves over the state of the
art on a standard dataset by a large margin. At
this, the combination of the optimal α, and a high
number of inference repetitions r and the mode
method (d = true) produced slightly more errors
than a high r alone. While the purpose of this pa-
per was mainly to address robustness and stability
issues of topic models, we are planning to apply
the segmentation algorithm to further datasets.

The most important takeaway, however, is that
especially for small sampling units like sentences,
tremendous improvements in applications can be
obtained when looking at multiple inference as-
signments and using the most frequently assigned
topic ID in subsequent processing – either across
diffeent inference steps or across diffeent infer-
ence runs. These two new strategies seem to be
able to offset sub-optimal hyperparameters to a
certain extent. This scheme is not only applica-
ble to Text Segmentation, but in all applications
where performance crucially depends on stable
topic ID assignments per token. Extensions to
this scheme, like ignoring tokens with a high topic
variability (stop words or general terms) or dy-
namically deciding to conflate several topics be-
cause of their per-token co-occurrence, are left for
future work.
