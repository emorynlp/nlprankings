Abstract

Medical information is widespread in modern society (e.g. scientific research, medical blogs,
clinical documents, TV and radio broadcast, novels). Moreover, everybody’s life may be con-
cerned with medical problems. However, the medical field conveys very specific and often
opaque notions (e.g., myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, abdominal strangulated hernia,
galactose urine), that are difficult to understand by lay people. We propose an automatic method
based on the morphological analysis of terms and on text mining for finding the paraphrases of
technical terms. Analysis of the results and their evaluation indicate that we can find correct
paraphrases for 343 terms. Depending on the semantics of the terms, error rate of the extractions
ranges between 0 and 59%. This kind of resources is useful for several Natural Language Pro-
cessing applications (i.e., information extraction, text simplification, question and answering).

1 Background

Medical and health information is widespread in the modern society in light of pressing health concerns
and of maintaining of healthy lifestyles. Besides, it is also available through modern media: scientific
research, articles, medical blogs and fora, clinical documents, TV and radio broadcast, novels, discussion
fora, epidemiological alerts, etc. Still, availability of medical and health information does not guaran-
tee its easy and correct understanding by lay people. The medical field conveys indeed very technical
notions, such as in example (1).

(1) myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, erythredema polyneuropathy, acromegaly, galactosemia

Although technical, these notions are nevertheless important for patients (AMA, 1999; McCray, 2005;
Eysenbach, 2007; Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center, 2008). It has been shown that in several
situations such notions cannot be correctly understood by patients: the steps needed for the medication
preparing and use (Patel et al., 2002); the instructions on drugs from patient package inserts, and the
information delivered in informed consensus and health brochures: it appears that among the 2,600
patients recruited in two hospitals, 26% to 60% cannot manage information available in these sources
(Williams et al., 1995); health information in different languages (English, Spanish, French) provided in
websites created for patients require high reading level (Berland et al., 2001; Hargrave et al., 2003; Kusec,
2004) and remains difficult to manage by patients, which can be negative for the communication between
patients and medical professionals, and the healthcare process (Tran et al., 2009). This situation sets the
context of our work. Our objective is to propose method for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases for
technical medical notions. More particularly, we propose to concentrate on terms and their words that
show neoclassical compounding word formation (Booij, 2010; Iacobini, 1997; Amiot and Dal, 2005),
such as in the example (1). Such words often involve Latin and Greek roots or bases, which makes them
more difficult to understand, as such words must be decomposed first (see examples (2) and (3)). To our
knowledge, this kind of approach has not been applied for the acquisition of laymen paraphrases.

(2) myocardial is formed with Latin myo (muscle) and Greek cardia (heart)

(3) cholecystectomy is formed with Greek chole (bile), Latin cystis (bladder), and Greek ectomy (surgical
removal)

Our work is related to the following research topics:

• Readability. The readability studies the ease in which text can be understood. Two kinds of readabil-
ity measures are distinguished: classical and computational (François, 2011). Classical measures
are usually based on number of characters and/or syllables in words, sentences or documents and on
linear regression models (Flesch, 1948; Gunning, 1973; Dubay, 2004). Computational measures,
that are more recent, can involve vectorial models and a great variety of descriptors. These de-
scriptors, usually specific to the texts processed, are for instance: combination of classical measures
with medical terminologies (Kokkinakis and Toporowska Gronostaj, 2006); n-grams of characters
(Poprat et al., 2006); discursive descriptors (Goeuriot et al., 2007); lexicon (Miller et al., 2007);
morphological descriptors (Chmielik and Grabar, 2011); combination of various descriptors (Wang,
2006; Zeng-Treiler et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008; François and Fairon, 2013).

• Lexical simplification. The lexical simplification helps to make text easier to understand. Lexical
simplification of texts in English has been addressed during the SemEval 2012 challengea. Given
a short input text and a target word in English, and given several English substitutes for the tar-
get word that fit the context, the goal was to rank these substitutes according to how simple they
are (Specia et al., 2012). Several clues have been applied: lexicon extracted from oral corpus and
Wikipedia, Google n-grams, WordNet (Sinha, 2012); word length, number of syllables, mutual in-
formation and frequency of words (Jauhar and Specia, 2012); frequency in Wikipedia, word length,
n-grams of characters and of words, syntactic complexity of documents (Johannsen et al., 2012);
n-grams, frequency in Wikipedia, n-Google grams (Ligozat et al., 2012); WordNet and word fre-
quency (Amoia and Romanelli, 2012).

• Dedicated resources. The building of resources suitable for performing the simplification is an-
other related research topics. Such resources are mainly two-fold lexica in which specialized and
non-specialized vocabularies are aligned (in examples (4) to (6), the technical terms are followed
by their non-technical equivalents). The first initiative of the kind appeared with the collaborative
effort Consumer Health Vocabulary (Zeng and Tse, 2006) (examples in (4)). One of the meth-
ods was applied to the most frequently occurring medical queries aligned to the UMLS (Unified
Medical Language System) concepts (Lindberg et al., 1993). Another work exploited a small cor-
pus and several statistical association measures for building aligned lexicon with technical terms
from the UMLS and their lay equivalents (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007). Similar work in other lan-
guages followed. In French, researchers proposed methods for the acquisition of syntactic variation
(Deléger and Zweigenbaum, 2008; Cartoni and Deléger, 2011) from comparable specialized and
non-specialized corpora, that led to the detection of verb/noun variations (examples in (5)) and a
larger set of syntactic variations (examples in (6)). Besides, research on the acquisition of termi-
nological variation (Hahn et al., 2001), synonymy (Fernández-Silva et al., 2011) and paraphrasing
(Max et al., 2012) is also relevant to outline the topics.

Our work is closely related to the building of resources dedicated to the lexical simplification. Our
objective is to propose method for paraphrasing the technical medical terms (i.e. medical compounds) in
expressions that are easier to understand by lay people. This aspect is seldom addressed: we can observe
that only some examples in (4) are concerned with the paraphrasing of technical and compound terms
(myocardial infarction, acrodynia). We work with the French data. Contrary to previous work, we do
not use comparable corpora with technical and non-technical texts. Instead, we exploit terms from an
existing medical terminology and corpora built from social media sources. We assume that this kind
of corpora may provide lay people equivalents for technical terms. We also rely on the morphological
analysis of technical terms. The expected result is to obtain pairs like {myocardial, heart muscle} or
{cholecystectomy, removal of gall bladder}. In the following, we start with the presentation of the
resources used (section 2), we present then the steps of the methodology (section 3). We describe and
discuss the obtained results (section 4) and conclude with some directions for future work (section 5).

2 Resources

2.1 Medical terms

The material processed is issued from the French part of the UMLS. It provides syntactically simple terms
that contain one word only (acrodynia), and syntactically complex terms that contain more than one word
(myocardial infarction). Syntactically complex terms are segmented in words. Each term is associated
to semantic types. When a given word receives more than one semantic type, a manual post-processing
allows to disambiguate it: each word is assigned to one semantic type only. Among the semantic types
available, we consider the three most common in the medical practice to which the lay people are the
most exposed: Anatomy (616 words): describe human body anatomy (e.g. abdominopelvic); Disorders
(2,283 words): describe medical problems and their signs (e.g. infarction, diabetes); Procedures (1,271
words): describe procedures which may be performed by medical staff to detect or cure disorders (e.g.
cholecystectomy). In what follows, word and term can be exchangeable and mean either the graphical
unit provided by the segmentation, or the medical notion.

The Wiki corpus contains encyclopaedic information on several medical notions from Wikipedia. Thanks
to the collaborative writing of the articles, these contain mostly correct information about the topics
concerned. Other corpora are collected from the dedicated fora (e.g. diabetes or backache). We assume
that people involved in these discussions may show low, middle or high degree of knowledge about the
disorders and related notions. We expect that all our corpora are written in a simple style and that they
contain paraphrases of technical terms. From Table 1, we can observe that the corpora vary in size.

3 Methodology for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases for medical compounds

The methodology is designed for analyzing the neoclassical medical compounds and for searching their
non-technical paraphrases in corpora. In our approach, the paraphrases may occur alone, such as heart
muscle, without being accompanied by their technical compounds (myocarde). In this case, we need first
to acquire the knowledge needed for their automatic detection. We propose to rely on the morphological
analysis of terms. The method is composed of four main steps: the processing of terms, the processing of
corpora, the extraction of layman paraphrases for technical terms, and the evaluation of the extractions.

3.1 The processing of medical terms

To reach the morphological information on terms we apply three specific processing:

1. Morpho-syntactic tagging and lemmatization of terms. The terms are morpho-syntactically tagged
and lemmatized with TreeTagger for French (Schmid, 1994). The morpho-syntactic tagging is
done in context of the terms. If a given word receives more than one tag, the most frequent one is
kept. At this step, we obtain term lemmas with their part-of-speech tags, such as in example (7).

(7) myocardique/A (myocardial/A), cholécystectomie/N (cholecystectomy/N), polyneuropathie/N
(polyneuropathy/N), acromégalie/N (acromegaly/N), galactosémie/N (galactosemia/N)

2. Morphological analysis. The lemmas are then morphologically analyzed with DériF (Namer,
2009). This tool performs the analysis of lemmas in order to detect their morphological structure,
to decompose them into their components (bases and affixes), and to semantically analyze their
structure. We give some examples of the morphological analysis in (8).

(8) myocardique/A: [[[myo N*] [carde N*] NOM] ique ADJ]
cholécystectomie/N: [[cholécysto N*] [ectomie N*] NOM]
polyneuropathie/N: [poly [[neur N*] [pathie N*] NOM] NOM]
acromégalie/N: [[acr N*] [mégal N*] ie NOM]
galactosémie/N: [[galactose NOM] [ém N*] ie NOM]

The computed bases and affixes are associated with syntactic categories (NOM, ADJ, V). When a
given base is suppletive (does not exist in modern French but was borrowed from Latin or Greek
languages), DériF assigns the most probable category (e.g. N* for nouns, A* for adjectives). For
instance, the analysis of myocardique/A indicates that this word contains the suppletive noun bases
myo N* (muscle) and carde N* (heart), and the affix -ique/ADJ. We can observe that some bases can
be decomposed further (e.g. galactose in galact (milk) and ose (sugars), cholecystectomy in chole (bile)
and cystis (bladder)). The words that contain more than one base are considered to be compounds
and are processed in the further steps of the method.

3. Association of morphological components with French words. The bases are “translated” with words
from modern French. We use for this resource built in previous work (Zweigenbaum and Grabar,
2003; Namer, 2003) (see some examples in (9)).

(9) myocardique/A: myo=muscle (muscle), carde=coeur (heart)
cholécystectomie/N: cholécysto=vésicule biliaire (gall bladder), ectomie=ablation (removal)

97



polyneuropathie/N: poly=nombreux (several), neuro=nerf (nerve), pathie=maladie (disorder)
acromégalie/N: acr=extrémité (extremity), mégal=grandeur (size)
galactosémie/N: galactose=galactose (galactose), ém=sang (blood)

Some words can remain technical (e.g., galactose, vésicule biliaire), while other components totally
lose their technical meaning (e.g. mégal=grandeur (size), poly=nombreux (several)).

3.2 The processing of corpora
The corpora are first segmented in words and sentences. Then, we also perform morpho-syntactic tagging
and lemmatization with TreeTagger for French.

3.3 The extraction of layman paraphrases corresponding to technical terms
French words corresponding to the morphological decomposition of terms (examples in (9)) are projected
on corpora in order to extract sentences and their segments which can provide the layman paraphrases for
the corresponding technical terms. Sentences that contain the translated French words are extracted as
candidates for proposing the paraphrases. Additionally, the segments delimited by these words are also
extracted. We consider the co-occurrence of the words issued from the morphological decomposition in
a sliding graphical window of n words. In the experiments presented, the window size n is fixed to 10
words. Smaller or larger windows show less performance.

(10) Les causes de tachycardie ventriculaire sont superposables à celles des extrasystoles ventric-
ulaires: infarctus du myocarde, insuffisance cardiaque, hypertrophie du muscle du coeur et
prolapsus de la valve mitrale.

The sentence in (10) contains words muscle and coeur, underlined in the example, that correspond to
the morphological components of myocardique (see examples in (9)). For this reason, this sentence is
extracted, as well as the segment delimited by these two words muscle du coeur (heart muscle).

3.4 The evaluation
The objective of the evaluation is to assess whether the proposed method is valid for the acquisition
of paraphrases for technical medical terms. The obtained results are evaluated manually by a com-
puter scientist with no training in biomedicine, but with background in computational linguistics and
morphology. We analyze the candidates for paraphrases from several points of view: Are the French
words corresponding to the components extracted correctly? Do these French words provide valid can-
didates for paraphrases? How easy are these paraphrases to be understood by laymen or by non-experts
in medicine? During the evaluation related to the second point (Do these French words provide valid
candidates for paraphrases?), we distinguish four situations:

1. the extraction is correct: e.g. myocardique paraphrased in muscle du coeur (heart muscle);

2. the extraction suffers from the incorrect morphological decomposition or from the wrong “trans-
lation” in French: e.g. périanal is “translated” in autour (around) and an (meaning year as it is). The
“translation” of this last word an is not correct and should be anus (anus) instead. Because of the
wrong “translation”, we collect a lot of incorrect segments like autour de 30 ans (around 30 years);

3. the extraction should be post-processed but contains the correct paraphrase: e.g. spondylarthrose,
“translated” in vertèbre (vertebra) and arthrose (arthrosis), is paraphrased in arthrose que l’on ne voyait
pas sur la vertèbre (arthrosis that was not seen on the vertebra), while the correct paraphrase from this
segment should be arthrose sur la vertèbre (arthrosis on the vertebra);

4. the extraction is wrong and can provide no useful information.

This evaluation allows to estimate precision of the results in three versions: strong precision Pstrong (only
the correct extractions are considered (extractions from 1)); weak precision Pweak (correct extractions
and extractions that need post-processing are considered (extractions from 1 and 3)); rate of incorrect
extractions %incorrect (the percentage of the incorrect extractions is computed (extractions from 4)).

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 The morphological analysis of terms

We generate the morphological analysis for 218 single words from the anatomy semantic type, 1,789 dis-
order words and 1,023 procedure words: over 70% of words are morphologically analyzed. Among these
words, we observe compounds (myocardique) and words formed with affixes (e.g. réadaptation derived
from adaptation, derived in its turn from adapter). The remaining words may be simple (e.g. abcès
(abscess), lèpre (leprosy), cicatrice (scar)) or contain bases and affixes that are not managed by Dérif (e.g.
pneumostrongylose (pneumostrongylosis), lagophtalmie (lagophthalmos), nécatorose (necatorosis)). Among the
generated decompositions by Dérif, we can find some cases with ambiguous decomposition that occur
when medical terms can be decomposed in several possible ways, among which only one is semantically
correct. For instance, posturographie (posturography) is decomposed into: [post [[uro N*] [graphie N*]
NOM] NOM], which may be glossed as control during the period which follows the therapy done on
the urinary system. From the formal point of view, such decomposition is very possible, although it is
weak semantically. For the term posturographie, the right decomposition is: [[posturo N*] [graphie
N*] NOM], which is related to the definition of the optimal body position when walking or sitting. As
indicated above, some terms (e.g. périanal) can be incorrectly “translated” in French.

4.2 The preprocessing of corpora

Our main difficulty at this step is related to the processing of forum messages and to their segmentation
into sentences. In addition to possible and frequent spelling and grammatical errors, forum messages
have also a very specific punctuation, which may be missing or convey personal feelings and emotions.
This seriously impedes the possibility to provide the correct segmentation in sentences, and means that,
because of the missing punctuation, the mapping of decomposed terms with corpora may be done with
bigger text segments in which the semantic relations between the mapped components may be weak or
non-existent, and provide incorrect extractions. We plan to combine the current method with the syntactic
analysis in order to ensure that stronger syntactic and semantic relations exist between the components.

4.3 The extraction of paraphrases and their evaluation

We present the results on extraction of sentences and paraphrases from the corpora processed. In Table
2, for the three semantic types of terms (anatomy ana., disorders dis., and procedures pro.) from each
corpus, we indicate the following information: the number of different sentences extracted (sentences),
yje number of different terms (uniq. terms), the number of correct paraphrases (correct), the number
of paraphrases that are possibly correct (pos. correct), the number of paraphrases which morphological
analysis and “translation” should be improved (morph. ana.), and the number of incorrect paraphrases
(incorrect). The last three lines indicate the precision values: strong precision (Pstrong), weak precision
(Pweak) and incorrect extractions (%incorrect).

From the data presented in Table 2, we can propose several observations: (1) the Wiki corpus, that is
not the largest in our dataset, provides the largest number of extractions (sentences and unique terms);
(2) among the three semantic types (anatomy, disorders and procedures), the number of paraphrases ex-
tracted for disorders is the largest in all corpora; (3) the largest set of paraphrases, that suffer from the
incorrect morphological decomposition or “translation”, is obtained for the procedure terms. According
to these observations, Pstrong ranges between 20 to 46% for anatomy, 39 and 66% for disorders, and 6 to
43 for procedures. The Pweak values, that takes into account the paraphrases that need post-processing,
show the increase by 0 to 28% by comparison with the Pstrong values. The %incorrect values indicate
that anatomy terms show the largest rate (40 to 59%) of incorrect paraphrases: it is possible that the
anatomy terms present the lowest rate of compositionality. The incorrect paraphrases are between 20
and 47 among the disorder terms, and between 0 to 54 among the procedure terms. The syntactic anal-
ysis may help to improve the current results. On the whole, the proposed method allows to extract the
paraphrases for 722 different terms from the corpora processed. Within the evaluated set of extractions,
these paraphrases are correct for 273 terms; while 343 terms are provided with correct paraphrases and
paraphrases that need to be post-processed. Most of the extracted paraphrases are noun phrases, and, at
a lesser extent, verb phrases. We present some examples of the correct paraphrases extracted:

- dorsalgie (dorsalgia): douleur dans le dos (pain in the back)
- myélocyte (myelocyte): cellules dans la moelle osseuse (cells of the bone marrow)
- lombalgie (lombalgia): douleurs dans les reins (pain in kidney)
- gastralgie (gastralgia): douleurs à l’estomac (stomach pain)
- desmorrhexie (desmorrhexia): rupture des ligaments (ligamentous rupture)
- hépatite (hepatitis): inflammation du foie (liver inflammation)

We can find several types of paraphrases that suffer from incorrect decomposition or “translation”:

• syringomyélie (syringomyelia) is currently “translated” in moelle (marrow or spinal cord) and canal (canal).
This term means a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord. We assume that
a more correct “translation” of this term should be: moelle (marrow or spinal cord) and cavité (cavity);

• sous-dural is “translated” in sous (sub) and dur (hard). The term is related to specific space in brain
that can be opened by the separation of the arachnoid mater from the dura mater. Concerning its
“translation”, we assume that dure-mère (dura mater) should be used instead of dur (hard). Besides,
the names of anatomical locations often remains difficult to understand. We assume that even when
terms are decomposed and “translated” correctly, the paraphrases for such terms may be not suitable
for laymen: other types of explanations (e.g. schemes or pictures) should be used instead;

• hyperémie (hyperaemia) is “translated” in hyper and sang (blood). The term means the increase of
blood flow to different tissues in the body. This term is not fully compositional because the notion
of tissues is absent, while necessary for its understanding. The proposed extractions for this term
mainly come from corpora related to diabetes, in which hyper and hypo are often used in relation
with the hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. This means that hyper should be “translated” with other
words, such as increase or elevated;

• hétérotopie is translated in autre (another) and endroit (place). The term means the displacement of an
organ from its normal position and that [an organ] is found in another place than the one expected.
This term brings no correct candidates for paraphrases because: it is not fully compositional and its
“translation” provides very common words widely used in the corpora.

Among the incorrect extractions we can find: (1) more terms with non-compositional semantics (such
as ostéodermie (osteoderm), causalgie (causalgia), adénoı̈de (adenoid), or xanthochromie (xanthochromia)) for
which the extracted paraphrases capture only part of the meaning; and (2) extractions that must be con-
troled by the syntactic analysis (e.g. petite boule de peau qui a sortie entre l’ongle et... (small skinball
that appeared between the nail and...) for micronychie (micronychia)) to make them more grammatical. Para-
phrases extracted from the Wiki corpus cover larger range of medical terms, while those extracted from

100



fora dedicated to a given medical topics are redundant. On the whole, we can consider that the currently
proposed method allows extracting interesting candidates as the paraphrases of technical terms, that are
indeed much easier to understand than the technical terms by themselves.

If we compare the obtained results with those presented in previous work, we can observe that:

• we extract paraphrases for larger number of terms: 343 terms with correct and possibly correct
paraphrases (722 terms with paraphrases in total) in our work against a total of 65 and 82 in (Deléger
and Zweigenbaum, 2008), 109 in (Cartoni and Deléger, 2011), and 152 in (Elhadad and Sutaria,
2007). In our work, the terms may receive more than one paraphrase;

• the precision values we obtain are comparable with those indicated in previous work: 67% and 60%
in (Deléger and Zweigenbaum, 2008), 66% in (Cartoni and Deléger, 2011), and 58% in (Elhadad
and Sutaria, 2007);

• in the cited work, the content of the corpora is explored but no reference is done to the set of terms
expected to be found. Because we work with a termset, we can compute the recall. If we consider the
terms that can be analyzed morphologically (3,030 terms), and for which we can find the paraphrases
with the proposed method, the recall value is close to 10% with the correct paraphrases (299 terms),
and to 24% with all the paraphrases extracted (722 terms). Yet, it is not sure that all of the terms, that
have been analyzed morphologically, can be provided with paraphrases in the corpora processed.

Besides, we should not forget that the nature of compounds and the decomposition of terms into com-
ponents also mean that specific semantic relations exist between these components (Namer and Zweigen-
baum, 2004; Booij, 2010). These are inherent to the syntactic constructions extracted. The characteristics
of these relations will be described and modeled in future work.

5 Conclusions and Future work

We propose to exploit social media texts in order to detect paraphrases for technical medical terms,
concentrating particularly on neoclassical compounds (e.g., myocardial, cholecystectomy, galactose,
acromegaly). The work is done in French. The method relies on the morphological analysis of terms,
on the “translation” of the components of terms in modern French words (e.g. {card, heart}), and on
the projection of these words on corpora. The method allows extracting correct and possibly correct
paraphrases for up to 343 technical terms. For covering larger set of terms, additional corpora must be
treated. The extracted paraphrases are easier to understand than the original technical terms. Moreover,
the semantic relations among the components, although non explicated, are conveyed by the paraphrases.
We can consider that the method proves to be efficient and promising for the creation of lexicon suit-
able for the simplification of medical texts. Besides, the purpose of the method is to cover neoclassical
compound terms that are usually non treated with automatic approaches, as they do not present clear
formal similarity with their paraphrases. One of the difficulties we have currently is related to the lack of
constrains on the extracted segments. In future work, we plan to apply the syntactic analysis for parsing
the extracted sentences. Another possibility is to compute the probability for a given paraphrase to be
correct, which can rely for instance on frequency of the extracted paraphrases, on their syntactic struc-
ture, etc. In order to make the extraction of paraphrases more exhaustive, we will apply the method to
other corpora and we will use additional resources (synonyms, associative resources) for performing the
approximate mapping of paraphrases. In future work, we will take into account syntactically complex
terms and not only simple words. The very objective of our work is to exploit and test the resource
created for the simplification of medical texts.
