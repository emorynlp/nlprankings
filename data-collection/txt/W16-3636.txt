Abstract

When people converse about social or po-
litical topics, similar arguments are often
paraphrased by different speakers, across
many different conversations. Debate
websites produce curated summaries of ar-
guments on such topics; these summaries
typically consist of lists of sentences that
represent frequently paraphrased proposi-
tions, or labels capturing the essence of
one particular aspect of an argument, e.g.
Morality or Second Amendment. We call
these frequently paraphrased propositions
ARGUMENT FACETS. Like these curated
sites, our goal is to induce and identify
argument facets across multiple conversa-
tions, and produce summaries. However,
we aim to do this automatically. We frame
the problem as consisting of two steps:
we first extract sentences that express an
argument from raw social media dialogs,
and then rank the extracted arguments in
terms of their similarity to one another.
Sets of similar arguments are used to rep-
resent argument facets. We show here that
we can predict ARGUMENT FACET SIMI-
LARITY with a correlation averaging 0.63
compared to a human topline averaging
0.68 over three debate topics, easily beat-
ing several reasonable baselines.

1 Introduction

When people converse about social or political
topics, similar arguments are often paraphrased by
different speakers, across many different conver-
sations. For example, consider the dialog excerpts
in Fig. 1 from the 89K sentences about gun control
in the IAC 2.0 corpus of online dialogs (Abbott et
al., 2016). Each of the sentences S1 to S6 provide

different linguistic realizations of the same propo-
sition namely that Criminals will have guns even
if gun ownership is illegal.

S1: To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun own-
ership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns..
S2: Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have
guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun
free zones.
S3: Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting
guns.
S4: Gun control laws will not work because criminals do
not obey gun control laws!
S5: Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands
of people who follow laws.
S6: Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect
good law abiding free citizens.

Figure 1: Paraphrases of the Criminals will have
guns facet from multiple conversations.

Debate websites, such as Idebate and ProCon
produce curated summaries of arguments on the
gun control topic, as well as many other topics.12

These summaries typically consist of lists, e.g.
Fig. 2 lists eight different aspects of the gun con-
trol argument from Idebate. Such manually cu-
rated summaries identify different linguistic real-
izations of the same argument to induce a set of
common, repeated, aspects of arguments, what we
call ARGUMENT FACETS. For example, a curator
might identify sentences S1 to S6 in Fig. 1 with a
label to represent the facet that Criminals will have
guns even if gun ownership is illegal.

Like these curated sites, we also aim to induce
and identify facets of an argument across multiple
conversations, and produce summaries of all the
different facets. However our aim is to do this
automatically, and over time. In order to simplify
the problem, we focus on SENTENTIAL ARGU-
MENTS, single sentences that clearly express

Pro Arguments
A1: The only function of a gun is to kill.
A2: The legal ownership of guns by ordinary citizens
inevitably leads to many accidental deaths.
A3: Sports shooting desensitizes people to the lethal na-
ture of firearms.
A4: Gun ownership increases the risk of suicide.
Con Arguments
A5: Gun ownership is an integral facet of the right to self
defense.
A6: Gun ownership increases national security within
democratic states.
A7: Sports shooting is a safe activity.
A8: Effective gun control is not achievable in democratic
states with a tradition of civilian gun owership.

a particular argument facet in dialog. We aim
to use SENTENTIAL ARGUMENTS to produce
extractive summaries of online dialogs about
current social and political topics. This paper
extends our previous work which frames our goal
as consisting of two tasks (Misra et al., 2015;
Swanson et al., 2015).

• Task1: Argument Extraction: How can we
extract sentences from dialog that clearly ex-
press a particular argument facet?

• Task2: Argument Facet Similarity: How
can we recognize that two sentential argu-
ments are semantically similar, i.e. that
they are different linguistic realizations of the
same facet of the argument?

Task1 is needed because social media dialogs
consist of many sentences that either do not ex-
press an argument, or cannot be understood out
of context. Thus sentences that are useful for in-
ducing argument facets must first be automatically
identified. Our previous work on Argument Ex-
traction achieved good results, (Swanson et al.,
2015), and is extended here (Sec. 2).

Task2 takes pairs of sentences from Task1 as
input and then learns a regressor that can pre-
dict Argument Facet Similarity (henceforth AFS).
Related work on argument mining (discussed in
more detail in Sec. 4) defines a finite set of facets
for each topic, similar to those from Idebate in
Fig. 2.3 Previous work then labels posts or sen-
tences using these facets, and trains a classifier to
return a facet label (Conrad et al., 2012; Hasan
and Ng, 2014; Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2014; Naderi
and Hirst, 2015), inter alia. However, this sim-
plification may not work in the long term, both be-
cause the sentential realizations of argument facets
are propositional, and hence graded, and because

3See also the facets in Fig. 3 below from ProCon.org.

facets evolve over time, and hence cannot be rep-
resented by a finite list.

In our previous work on AFS, we developed
an AFS regressor for predicting the similarity
of human-generated labels for summaries of
dialogic arguments (Misra et al., 2015). We
collected 5 human summaries of each dialog, and
then used the Pyramid tool and scheme to annotate
sentences from these summaries as contributors to
(paraphrases of) a particular facet (Nenkova and
Passonneau, 2004). The Pyramid tool requires
the annotator to provide a human readable label
for a collection of contributors that realize the
same propositional content. The AFS regressor
operated on pairs of human-generated labels from
Pyramid summaries of different dialogs about the
same topic. In this case, facet identification is
done by the human summarizers, and collections
of similar labels represent an argument facet. We
believe this is a much easier task than the one
we attempt here of training an AFS regressor on
automatically extracted raw sentences from social
media dialogs. The contributions of this paper are:

• We develop a new corpus of sentential argu-
ments with gold-standard labels for AFS.

• We analyze and improve our argument ex-
tractor, by testing it on a much larger dataset.
We develop a larger gold standard corpus for
ARGUMENT QUALITY (AQ).

• We develop a regressor that can predict AFS
on extracted sentential arguments with a cor-
relation averaging 0.63 compared to a human
topline of 0.68 for three debate topics.4

2 Corpora and Problem Definition

Many existing websites summarize the frequent,
and repeated, facets of arguments about current
topics, that are linguistically realized in different
ways, across many different social media and de-
bate forums. For example, Fig. 2 illustrates the
eight facets for gun control on IDebate. Fig. 3
illustrates a different type of summary, for the
death penalty topic, from ProCon, where the ar-
gument facets are called out as the “Top Ten Pros
and Cons” and given labels such as Morality,
Constitutionality and Race. See the top of
Fig. 3. The bottom of Fig. 3 shows how each facet
is then elaborated by a paragraph for both its Pro
and Con side: due to space we only show the sum-
mary for the Morality facet here.

These summaries are curated, thus one would

not expect that different sites would call out the
exact same facets, or even that the same type of
labels would be used for a specific facet. As
we can see, ProCon (Fig. 3) uses one word or
phrasal labels, while IDebate (Fig. 2) describes
each facet with a sentence. Moreover, these cu-
rated summaries are not produced for a particu-
lar topic once-and-for-all: the curators often re-
organize their summaries, drawing out different
facets, or combining previously distinct facets un-
der a single new heading. We hypothesize that this
happens because new facets arise over time. For
example, it is plausible that for the gay marriage
topic, the facet that Gay marriage is a civil rights
issue came to the fore only in the last ten years.

Our long-term aim is to produce summaries
similar to these curated summaries, but automat-
ically, and over time, so that as new argument
facets arise for a particular topic, we can identify
them. We begin with three debate topics, gun con-
trol (38102 posts), gay marriage (22425 posts) and
death penalty (5283 posts), from the Internet Ar-
gument Corpus 2.0 (Abbott et al., 2016). We first
need to create a large sample of high quality sen-
tential arguments (Task1 above) and then create a
large sample of paired sentential arguments in or-
der to train the model for AFS (Task2 above).

2.1 Argument Quality Data
We extracted all the sentences for all of the posts
in each topic to first create a large corpus of topic-
sorted sentences. See Table 1.

We started with the Argument Quality (AQ) re-

Topic Original Rescored Sampled AQ #N (%)
GC 89,722 63,025 2140 1887 (88%)
DP 17,904 11,435 1986 1520 (77%)
GM 51,543 40,306 2062 1745 (85%)

pled bin range > 0.55 and number of sentential
arguments (high AQ) after annotation. GC=Gun
Control, DP=Death Penalty, GM=Gay Marriage.

gressor from Swanson et al. (2015), which gives a
score to each sentence. The AQ score is intended
to reflect how easily the speaker’s argument can be
understood from the sentence without any context.
Easily understandable sentences are assumed to
be prime candidates for producing extractive sum-
maries. In Swanson et al. (2015), the annotators
rated AQ using a continuous slider ranging from
hard (0.0) to easy to interpret (1.0). We refined the
Mechanical Turk task to elicit new training data
for AQ as summarized in Table 1. Fig. 8 in the ap-
pendix shows the HIT we used to collect new AQ
labels for sentences, as described below.

We expected to to apply Swanson’s AQ regres-
sor to our sample completely “out of the box”.
However, we first discovered that many sentences
given high AQ scores were very similar, while we
need a sample that realizes many diverse facets.
We then discovered that some extracted sentential
arguments were not actually high quality. We hy-
pothesized that the diversity issue arose primarily
because Swanson’s dataset was filtered using high
PMI n-grams. We also hypothesized that the qual-
ity issue had not surfaced because Swanson’s sam-
ple was primarily selected from sentences marked
with the discourse connectives but, first, if, and so.
Our sample (Original column of Table 1) is much
larger and was not similarly filtered.

Figure 4: Word count distribution for argument
quality prediction scores > 0.91 for Swanson’s
original model.

Fig. 4 plots the distribution of word counts for
sentences from our sample that were given an AQ
score > 0.91 by Swanson’s trained AQ regres-
sor. The first bin shows that many sentences with

278



less than 10 words are predicted to be high qual-
ity, but many of these sentences in our data con-
sisted of only a few elongated words (e.g. HA-
HAHAHA...). The upper part of the distribution
shows a large number of sentences with more than
70 words with a predicted AQ > 0.91. We discov-
ered that most of these long sentences are multiple
sentences without punctuation. We thus refined
the AQ model by removing duplicate sentences,
and rescoring sentences without a verb and with
less than 4 dictionary words to AQ = 0. We then
restricted our sampling to sentences between 10
and 40 tokens, to eliminate run-on sentences and
sentences without much propositional content. We
did not retrain the regressor, rather we resampled
and rescored the corpus. See the Rescored column
of Table 1. After removing the two tails in Fig. 4,
the distribution of word counts is almost uniform
across bins of sentences from length 10 to 40.

As noted above, the sample in Swanson et al.
(2015) was filtered using PMI, and PMI con-
tributes to AQ. Thus, to end up with a diverse
set of sentences representing many facets of each
topic, we decided to sample sentences with lower
AQ scores than Swanson had used. We binned
the sentences based on predicted AQ score and ex-
tracted random samples across bins ranging from
.55–1.0, in increments of .10. Then we extracted a
smaller sample and collected new AQ annotations
for gay marriage and death penalty on Mechani-
cal Turk, using the definitions in Fig. 8 (in the ap-
pendix). See the Sampled column of Table 1. We
pre-selected three annotators using a qualifier that
included detailed instructions and sample annota-
tions. A score of 3 was mapped to a yes and scores
of 1 or 2 mapped to a no. We simplified the task
slightly in the HIT for gun control, where five an-
notators were instructed to select a yes label if the
sentence clearly expressed an argument (score 3),
or a no label otherwise (score 1 or 2).

We then calculated the probability that the sen-
tences in each bin were high quality arguments
using the resulting AQ gold standard labels, and
found that a threshhold of predicted AQ > 0.55
maintained both diversity and quality. See Fig. 9
in the appendix. Table 1 summarizes the results
of each stage of the process of producing the new
AQ corpus of 6188 sentences (Sampled and then
annotated). The last column of Table 1 shows that
gold standard labels agree with the rescored AQ
regressor between 77% and 88% of the time.

2.2 Argument Facet Similarity Data

The goal of Task2 is to define a similarity metric
and train a regression model that takes as input two
sentential arguments and returns a scalar value that
predicts their similarity(AFS). The model must re-
flect the fact that similarity is graded, e.g. the same
argument facet may be repeated with different lev-
els of explicit detail. For example, sentence A1 in
Fig. 2 is similar to the more complete argument,
Given the fact that guns are weapons—things de-
signed to kill—they should not be in the hands of
the public, which expresses both the premise and
conclusion. Sentence A1 leaves it up to the reader
to infer the (obvious) conclusion.

S7: Since there are gun deaths in countries that have
banned guns, the gun bans did not work.
S8: It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are
just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less
gun crime (particularly where it’s not related to organ-
ised crime).
S9: My point was that the theory that more gun con-
trol leaves people defenseless does not explain the lower
murder rates in other developed nations.

Figure 5: Paraphrases of the Gun ownership does
not lead to higher crime facet of the Gun Control
topic across different conversations.

Our approach to Task2 draws strongly on recent
work on semantic textual similarity (STS) (Agirre
et al., 2013; Dolan and Brockett, 2005; Mihalcea
et al., 2006). STS measures the degree of seman-
tic similarity between a pair of sentences with val-
ues that range from 0 to 5. Inspired by the scale
used for STS, we first define what a facet is, and
then define the values of the AFS scale as shown
in Fig. 10 in the appendix (repeated from Misra et
al. (2015) for convenience). We distinguish AFS
from STS because: (1) our data are so different:
STS data consists of descriptive sentences whereas
our sentences are argumentative excerpts from di-
alogs; and (2) our definition of facet allows for
sentences that express opposite stance to be real-
izations of the same facet (AFS = 3) in Fig. 10.

Related work has primarily used entailment or
semantic equivalence to define argument similar-
ity (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Boltuzic and
Šnajder, 2015; Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2015; Haber-
nal et al., 2014). We believe the definition of AFS
given in Fig. 10 will be more useful in the long
run than semantic equivalence or entailment, be-
cause two arguments can only be contradictory if
they are about the same facet. For example, con-
sider that sentential argument S7 in Fig. 5 is anti
gun-control, while sentences S8 and S9 are pro
gun-control. Our annotation guidelines label them
with the same facet, in a similar way to how the

279



curated summaries on ProCon provides both a Pro
and Con side for each facet. See Fig. 3.

Figure 6: The distribution of AFS scores as a
function of UMBC STS scores for gun control
sentences.

In order to efficiently collect annotations for
AFS, we want to produce training data pairs that
are more likely than chance to be the same facet
(scores 3 and above as defined in Fig. 10). Sim-
ilar arguments are rare with an all-pairs matching
protocol, e.g. in ComArg approximately 67% of
the annotations are “not a match” (Boltuzic and
Šnajder, 2014). Also, we found that Turkers are
confused when asked to annotate similarity and
then given a set of sentence pairs that are almost
all highly dissimilar. Annotations also cost money.
We therefore used UMBC STS (Han et al., 2013)
to score all potential pairs.5 To foreshadow, the
plot in Fig. 6 shows that this pre-scoring works:
(1) the lower quadrant of the plot shows that STS
< .20 corresponds to the lower range of scores for
AFS; and (2) the lower half of the left hand side
shows that we still get many arguments that are
low AFS (values below 3) in our training data.

We selected 2000 pairs in each topic, based on
their UMBC similarity scores, which resulted in
lowest UMBC scores of 0.58 for GM, 0.56 for
GC and 0.58 for DP. To ensure a pool of diverse
arguments, a particular sentence can appear in at
most ten pairs. MT workers took a qualification
test with definitions and instructions as shown in
Fig. 10. Sentential arguments with sample AFS
annotations were part of the qualifier. The 6000
pairs were made available to our three most reli-
able pre-qualified workers. The last row of Table 3
reports the human topline for the task, i.e. the av-
erage pairwise r across all three workers. Interest-
ingly, the Gay marriage topic (r = 0.60) is more
difficult for human annotators than either Death
Penalty (r = 0.74) or Gun Control (r = 0.69).

versity of Maryland Baltimore County available at

3 Argument Facet Similarity

Given the data collected above, we defined a su-
pervised machine learning experiment with AFS
as our dependent variable. We developed a num-
ber of baselines using off the shelf tools. Features
are grouped into sets and discussed in detail below.

3.1 Feature Sets
NGRAM cosine. Our primary baseline is an
ngram overlap feature. For each argument, we ex-
tract the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, and then
calculate the cosine similarity between two texts
represented as vectors of their ngram counts.
Rouge. Rouge is a family of metrics for compar-
ing the similarity of two summaries (Lin, 2004),
which measures overlapping units such as con-
tinuous and skip ngrams, common subsequences,
and word pairs. We use all the rouge f-scores
from the pyrouge package. Our analysis shows
that rouge s* f score correlates most highly with
AFS.6

UMBC STS. We consider STS, a measure of the
semantic similarity of two texts (Agirre et al.,
2012), as another baseline, using the UMBC STS
tool. Fig. 6 illustrates that in general, STS is rough
approximation of AFS. It is possible that our selec-
tion of data for pairs for annotation using UMBC
STS either improves or reduces its performance.
Google Word2Vec. Word embeddings from
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) are popular for
expressing semantic relationships between words,
but using word embeddings to express entire sen-
tences often requires some compromises. In par-
ticular, averaging word2vec embeddings for each
word may lose too much information in long sen-
tences. Previous work on argument mining has
developed methods using word2vec that are ef-
fective for clustering similar arguments (Habernal
and Gurevych, 2015; Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2015)
Other research creates embeddings at the sen-
tence level using more advanced techniques such
as Paragraph Vectors (Le and Mikolov, 2014).

We take a more direct approach in which we
use the word embeddings directly as features. For
each sentential argument in the pair, we create a
300-dimensional vector by filtering for stopwords
and punctuation and then averaging the word em-
beddings from Google’s word2vec model for the
remaining words.7 Each dimension of the 600 di-
mensional concatenated averaged vector is used
directly as a feature. In our experiments, this

280



concatenation method greatly outperforms cosine
similarity (Table 2, Table 3). Sec. 3.3 discusses
properties of word embeddings that may yield
these performance differences.
Custom Word2Vec. We also create our own
300-dimensional embeddings for our dialogic do-
main using the Gensim library (Řehůřek and So-
jka, 2010), with default settings, and a very
large corpus of user-generated dialogic content.
This includes the corpus described in Sec. 2
(929, 206 forum posts), an internal corpus of
1, 688, 639 tweets on various topics, and a corpus
of 53, 851, 542 posts from Reddit.8

LIWC category and Dependency Overlap.
Both dependency structures and the Linguistics
Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) tool have been use-
ful in previous work (Pennebaker et al., 2001;
Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Hasan and Ng,
2013). We develop a novel feature set that com-
bines LIWC category and dependency overlap,
aiming to capture a generalized notion of concept
overlap between two arguments, i.e. to capture the
hypothesis that classes of content words such as
affective processes or emotion types are indicative
of a shared facet across pairs of arguments.

Figure 7: LIWC Generalized Dep. tuples

We create partially generalized LIWC depen-
dency features and count overlap normalized by
sentence length across pairs, building on previous
work (Joshi and Penstein-Rosé, 2009). Stanford
dependency features (Manning et al., 2014) are
generalized by leaving one dependency element
lexicalized, replacing the other word in the depen-
dency relation with its LIWC category and by re-
moving the actual dependency type (nsubj, dobj,
etc.) from the triple. This creates a tuple of (“gov-
ernor token”, LIWC category of dependent token).
We call these simplified LIWC dependencies.

Fig. 7 illustrates the generalization process for
three LIWC simplified dependencies, (”deter”,
”fear), (”deter”, ”punishment”), and (”deter”,
”love”). Because LIWC is a hierarchical lexicon,

8One month sample https://www.reddit.com/
r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_
publicly_available_reddit_comment

two dependencies may share many generalizations
or only a few. Here, the tuples with dependent to-
kens fear and punishment are more closely related
because their shared generalization include both
Negative Emotion and Affective Processes, but the
tuples with dependent tokens fear and love have a
less similar relationship, because they only share
the Affective Processes generalization.

3.2 Machine Learning Regression Results

We randomly selected 90% of our annotated pairs
to use for nested 10-fold cross-validation, set-
ting aside 10% for qualitative analysis of pre-
dicted vs. gold-standard scores. We use Ridge
Regression (RR) with l2-norm regularization and
Support Vector Regression (SVR) with an RBF
kernel from scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
Performance evaluation uses two standard mea-
sures, Correlation Coefficient (r) and Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). A separate inner cross-
validation within each fold of the outer cross-
validation is used to perform a grid search to deter-
mine the hyperparameters for that outer fold. The
outer cross-validation reports the scoring metrics.
Simple Ablation Models. We first evaluate sim-
ple models based on a single feature using both
RR and SVR. Table 2, Rows 1, 2, and 3 show the
baseline results: UMBC Semantic Textual Sim-
ilarity (STS), Ngram Cosine, and Rouge. Sur-
prisingly, the UMBC STS measure does not per-
form as well as Ngram Cosine for Death Penalty
and Gay Marriage. LIWC dependencies (Row 4)
perform similarly to Rouge (Row 3) across top-
ics. Cosine similarity for the custom word2vec
model (Row 5) performs about as well or bet-
ter than ngrams across topics, but cosine simi-
larity using the Google model (Row 6) performs
worse than ngrams for all topics except Death
Penalty. Interestingly our custom Word2Vec mod-
els perform significantly better than the Google
word2vec models for Gun Control and Gay Mar-
riage, with both much higher r and lower RMSE,
while performing identically for Death Penalty.
Feature Combination Models. Table 3 shows
the results of testing feature combinations to learn
which ones are complementary. Since SVR con-
sistently performs better than RR, we use SVR
only. Significance is calculated using paired
t-tests between the RMSE values across folds.
We paired Ngrams separately with LIWC and
ROUGE to evaluate if the combination is sig-
nificant. Ngram+Rouge (Row 1) is significantly
better than Ngram for Gun Control and Death
Penalty (p < .01), and Gay Marriage (p = .03).

with 10-fold Cross-Validation on the 1800 training items for each topic.

Ngram+LIWC (Row 2) is significantly better than
Ngram for Gun Control, and Death Penalty (p <
.01). Thus both Rouge and LIWC provide com-
plementary information to Ngrams.

Our best result using our hand-engineered fea-
tures is a combination of LIWC, Rouge, and
Ngrams (Row 3). Interestingly, adding UMBC
STS (Row 4) gives a small but significant im-
provement (p < 0.01 for gun control; p = 0.07
for gay marriage). Thus we take Ngrams, LIWC,
Rouge, and UMBC STS (Row 4) as our best hand-
engineered model across all topics with a correla-
tion of 0.65 for gun control, 0.50 for death penalty
and 0.40 for gay marriage. This combination is
significantly better than the baselines for Ngram
baseline (p < .01), UMBC STS (p <= .02) and
Rouge (p < .01) for all three topics.

We then further combine the hand-engineered
features (Row 4) with the Google Word2Vec fea-
tures (Row 6), creating the model in Row 8. A
paired t-test between RMSE values from each
cross-validation fold for each model (Row 4 vs.
Row 8 and Row 6 vs. Row 8) shows that the our
hand-engineered features are complementary to
Word2Vec, and their combination yields a model
significantly better than either model alone (p <

.01). We note that although the custom word2vec
model performs much better for gun control and
gay marriage when using cosine, it actually per-
forms slightly but significantly (p = .05) worse
when using concatenation with hand-engineered
features. This may simply be due to the size
of the training data, i.e. the Google model used
nearly twice as much training data, while our
domain-specific word2vec model achieves compa-
rable performance to the Google model with much
less training data.

3.3 Analysis and Discussion

Although it is common to translate word em-
beddings into single features or reduced feature
sets for similarity through the use of cluster-
ing (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015) or cosine simi-
larity (Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2015), we show that it
is possible to improve results by directly combin-
ing word embeddings with hand-engineered fea-
tures. In our task, sentences were limited to a max-
imum of 40 tokens in order to encourage single-
facet sentences, but this may have provided an ad-
ditional benefit by allowing us to average word
embeddings while still preserving useful signal.

Our results also demonstrate that using concate-

GC1 You say that gun control must not be effec-
tive because the study’s conclusions about
gun control were inconclusive.

You’re right that gun control isn’t about guns,

GM4 Technically though marriage is not dis-

to marry the opposite sex.

Everyone has the right to marry someone of the
opposite sex, and with gay marriage, everyone
will have the right to marry someone of the same
AND opposite sex.

as hundreds of such protections at the state level.

nation for learning similarity with vector represen-
tations works much better than the common prac-
tice of reducing a pair of vectors to a single score
using cosine similarity. Previous work (Li et al.,
2015; Pennington et al., 2014) also shows that all
dimensions are not equally useful predictors for
a specific task. For sentiment classification, Li
et al. (2015) find that “too large a dimensional-
ity leads many dimensions to be non-functional
... causing two sentences of opposite sentiment to
differ only in a few dimensions.” This may also
be the situation for the 300-dimensional embed-
dings used for AFS. Hence, when using concate-
nation, single dimensions can be weighted to ad-
just for non-functional dimensions, but using co-
sine makes this per-dimension weighting impossi-
ble. This might explain why our custom word2vec
model outperforms the Google model when using
cosine as compared to concatenation, i.e. more di-
mensions are informative in the custom model, but
overall, the Google model provides more comple-
mentary information when non-functional dimen-
sions are accounted for. More analysis is needed
to fully support this claim.

To qualitatively illustrate some of the differ-
ences between our final AFS regressor model
(Row 8 of Table 3) and several baselines, we ap-
ply the model to a set-aside 200 pairs per topic.
Table 4 shows examples selected to highlight the
strengths of AFS prediction for different models
as compared to the AFS gold standard scores.

MT AFS values near 1 indicate same topic but
no similarity. Rows GC1 and DP2 talk about to-
tally different facets and only share the same topic
(AFS = 1). Rouge and Ngram features based on

word overlap predict scores that are too high. In
contrast, LIWC dependencies and word2vec based
on concept and semantic overlap are more accu-
rate. MT values near 3 indicate same facet but
somewhat different arguments. Arguments in row
GM4 talk about marriage rights to all, and there
is some overlap in these arguments beyond sim-
ply being the same topic, however the speakers are
on opposite stance sides. Both of the arguments
in row GM5 (MT AFS of 3.3) reference the same
facet of the financial and legal benefits available to
married couples, but Arg2 is more specific. Both
Word2vec and our trained AFS model can recog-
nize the similarity in the concepts in the two argu-
ments and make good predictions.

MT values above 4 indicate two arguments that
are the same facet and very similar. Row DP6 gets
a high Rouge overlap score and Word2vec relates
‘lower crime rate’ as semantically similar to ‘de-
ter murder rates’ thus yielding an accurately high
AFS score. DP7 is an example where LIWC de-
pendencies perform better as compared to other
features, because it focuses in on the dependency
between the death penalty and cost, but none of the
models do well at predicting the MT AFS score.
One issue here may be that, despite our attempts
to sample pairs with more representatives of high
AFS, there is just less training data available for
this part of the distribution. Hence all the regres-
sors will be conservative at predicting the highest
values. We hope in future work to improve our
AFS regressor by finding additional methods for
populating the training data with more highly sim-
ilar pairs.

4 Related Work

There are many theories of argumentation that
might be applicable for our task (Jackson and Ja-
cobs, 1980; Reed and Rowe, 2004; Walton et al.,
2008; Gilbert, 1997; Toulmin, 1958; Dung, 1995),
but one definition of argument structure may not
work for every NLP task. Social media arguments
are often informal, and do not necessarily follow
logical rules or schemas of argumentation (Stab
and Gurevych, 2014; Peldszus and Stede, 2013;
Ghosh et al., 2014; Habernal et al., 2014; Goudas
et al., 2014; Cabrio and Villata, 2012).

Moreover, in social media, segments of text that
are argumentative must first be identified, as in
our Task1. Habernal and Gurevych (2016) train
a classifier to recognize text segments that are ar-
gumentative, but much previous work does Task1
manually. Goudas et al. (2014) annotate 16,000
sentences from social media documents and con-
sider 760 of them to be argumentative. Hasan
and Ng (2014) also manually identify argumenta-
tive sentences, while Boltuzic and Šnajder (2014)
treat the whole post as argumentative, after man-
ually removing “spam” posts. Biran and Ram-
bow (2011) automatically identify justifications as
a structural component of an argument.

Other work groups semantically-similar classes
of reasons or frames that underlie a particu-
lar speaker’s stance, what we call ARGUMENT
FACETS. One approach categorizes sentences or
posts using topic-specific argument labels, which
are functionally similar to our facets as discussed
above (Conrad et al., 2012; Hasan and Ng, 2014;
Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2014; Naderi and Hirst,
2015). For example, Fig. 2 lists facets A1 to
A8 for Gun Control from the IDebate website;
Boltuzic and Šnajder (2015) use this list to label
posts. They apply unsupervised clustering using a
semantic textual similarity tool, but evaluate clus-
ters using their hand-labelled argument tags. Our
method instead explicitly models graded similar-
ity of sentential arguments.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We present a method for scoring argument facet
similarity in online debates using a combination of
hand-engineered and unsupervised features with a
correlation averaging 0.63 compared to a human
top line averaging 0.68. Our approach differs from
similar work that finds and groups the “reasons”
underlying a speakers stance, because our mod-
els are based on the belief that it is not possible
to define a finite set of discrete facets for a topic.
A qualitative analysis of our results, illustrated by

Table 4, suggests that treating facet discovery as a
similarity problem is productive, i.e. examination
of particular pairs suggests facets about legal and
financial benefits for same-sex couples, the claim
that the death penalty does not actually affect mur-
der rates, and an assertion that “they”, implying
“congress”, do not have the express, enumerated
power to pass legislation restricting guns.

Previous work shows that metrics used for eval-
uating machine translation quality perform well
on paraphrase recognition tasks (Madnani et al.,
2012). In our experiments, ROUGE performed
very well, suggesting that other machine transla-
tion metrics such as Terp and Meteor may be use-
ful (Snover et al., 2009; Lavie and Denkowski,
2009). We will explore this in future work.

In future, we will use our AFS regressor to clus-
ter and group similar arguments and produce ar-
gument facet summaries as a final output of our
pipeline. Habernal and Gurevych (2015) apply
clustering in argument mining by averaging word
embeddings from posts and sentences from debate
portals, clustering the resulting averaged vectors,
and then computing distance measures from clus-
ters to unseen sentences (“classification units”)
as features. Cosine similarity between weighted
and summed vector representations is also a com-
mon approach, and Boltuzic and Šnajder (2015)
show word2vec cosine similarity beats bag-of-
words and STS baselines when used with cluster-
ing for argument identification.

Finally, our AQ extractor treats all posts on a
topic equally, operating on a set of concatenated
posts. We will explore other sampling methods to
ensure that the AQ extractor does not eliminate ar-
guments made by less articulate citizens, by e.g.
enforcing that “Every speaker in a debate con-
tributes at least one argument”. We will also sam-
ple by stance-side, so that summaries can be orga-
nized using “Pro” and “Con”, as in curated sum-
maries. Our final goal is to combine quality-based
argument extraction, our AFS model, stance, post
and author level information, so that our sum-
maries represent the diversity of views on a topic,
a quality not always guaranteed by summarization
techniques, human or machine.

Facet: A facet is a low level issue that often reoccurs in
many arguments in support of the author’s stance or in at-
tacking the other author’s position. There are many ways
to argue for your stance on a topic. For example, in a dis-
cussion about the death penalty you may argue in favor of
it by claiming that it deters crime. Alternatively, you may
argue in favor of the death penalty because it gives victims
of the crimes closure. On the other hand you may argue
against the death penalty because some innocent people will
be wrongfully executed or because it is a cruel and unusual
punishment. Each of these specific points is a facet.
For two utterances to be about the same facet, it is not nec-
essary that the authors have the same belief toward the facet.
For example, one author may believe that the death penalty
is a cruel and unusual punishment while the other one at-
tacks that position. However, in order to attack that position
they must be discussing the same facet.

We would like you to classify each of the following sets of
pairs based on your perception of how SIMILAR the argu-
ments are, on the following scale, examples follow.
(5) Completely equivalent, mean pretty much exactly the
same thing, using different words.
(4) Mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ.
One argument may be more specific than another or include
a relatively unimportant extra fact.
(3) Roughly equivalent, but some important information
differs or is missing. This includes cases where the argu-
ment is about the same FACET but the authors have differ-
ent stances on that facet.
(2) Not equivalent, but share some details. For example,
talking about the same entities but making different argu-
ments (different facets)
(1) Not equivalent, but are on same topic
(0) On a different topic
