Abstract

The availability of learner corpora, especially
those which have been manually error-tagged
or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means
that researchers do not have a common devel-
opment and test set for natural language pro-
cessing of learner English such as for gram-
matical error detection. Given this back-
ground, we created a novel learner corpus
that was manually error-tagged and shallow-
parsed. This corpus is available for research
and educational purposes on the web. In
this paper, we describe it in detail together
with its data-collection method and annota-
tion schemes. Another contribution of this
paper is that we take the first step toward
evaluating the performance of existing POS-
tagging/chunking techniques on learner cor-
pora using the created corpus. These contribu-
tions will facilitate further research in related
areas such as grammatical error detection and
automated essay scoring.

1 Introduction

The availability of learner corpora is still somewhat
limited despite the obvious usefulness of such data
in conducting research on natural language process-
ing of learner English in recent years. In particular,
learner corpora tagged with grammatical errors are
rare because of the difficulties inherent in learner
corpus creation as will be described in Sect. 2. As
shown in Table 1, error-tagged learner corpora are
very few among existing learner corpora (see Lea-
cock et al. (2010) for a more detailed discussion
of learner corpora). Even if data is error-tagged,

it is often not available to the public or its access
is severely restricted. For example, the Cambridge
Learner Corpus, which is one of the largest error-
tagged learner corpora, can only be used by authors
and writers working for Cambridge University Press
and by members of staff at Cambridge ESOL.

Error-tagged learner corpora are crucial for devel-
oping and evaluating error detection/correction al-
gorithms such as those described in (Rozovskaya
and Roth, 2010b; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000;
Chodorow et al., 2007; Felice and Pulman, 2008;
Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al.,
2003b; Lee and Seneff, 2008; Nagata et al., 2004;
Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006; Tetreault et
al., 2010b). This is one of the most active research
areas in natural language processing of learner En-
glish. Because of the restrictions on their availabil-
ity, researchers have used their own learner corpora
to develop and evaluate error detection/correction
methods, which are often not commonly available
to other researchers. This means that the detec-
tion/correction performance of each existing method
is not directly comparable as Rozovskaya and Roth
(2010a) and Tetreault et al. (2010a) point out. In
other words, we are not sure which methods achieve
the best performance. Commonly available error-
tagged learner corpora are therefore essential to fur-
ther research in this area.

For similar reasons, to the best of our knowledge,
there exists no such learner corpus that is manually
shallow-parsed and which is also publicly available,
unlike, say, native-speaker corpora such as the Penn
Treebank. Such a comparison brings up another cru-
cial question: “Do existing POS taggers and chun-

kers work on learner English as well as on edited text
such as newspaper articles?” Nobody really knows
the answer to the question. The only exception in the
literature is the work by Tetreault et al. (2010b) who
evaluated parsing performance in relation to prepo-
sitions. Nevertheless, a great number of researchers
have used existing POS taggers and chunkers to ana-
lyze the writing of learners of English. For instance,
error detection methods normally use a POS tagger
and/or a chunker in the error detection process. It is
therefore possible that a major cause of false pos-
itives and negatives in error detection may be at-
tributed to errors in POS-tagging and chunking. In
corpus linguistics, researchers (Aarts and Granger,
1998; Granger, 1998; Tono, 2000) use such tools to
extract interesting patterns from learner corpora and
to reveal learners’ tendencies. However, poor per-
formance of the tools may result in misleading con-
clusions.

Given this background, we describe in this paper
a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner
corpus that we created. In Sect. 2, we discuss the
difficulties inherent in learner corpus creation. Con-
sidering the difficulties, in Sect. 3, we describe our
method for learner corpus creation, including its
data collection method and annotation schemes. In
Sect. 4, we describe our learner corpus in detail. The
learner corpus is called the Konan-JIEM learner cor-
pus (KJ corpus) and is freely available for research

and educational purposes on the web1. Another
contribution of this paper is that we take the first
step toward answering the question about the per-
formance of existing POS-tagging/chunking tech-
niques on learner data. We report and discuss the
results in Sect. 5.

2 Difficulties in Learner Corpus Creation

In addition to the common difficulties in creating
any corpus, learner corpus creation has its own dif-
ficulties. We classify them into the following four
categories of the difficulty in:

1. collecting texts written by learners;

2. transforming collected texts into a corpus;

3. copyright transfer; and

4. error and POS/parsing annotation.

The first difficulty concerns the problem in col-
lecting texts written by learners. As in the case
of other corpora, it is preferable that the size of a
learner corpus be as large as possible where the size
can be measured in several ways including the total
number of texts, words, sentences, writers, topics,
and texts per writer. However, it is much more diffi-
cult to create a large learner corpus than to create a

1http://www.gsk.or.jp/index_e.html

large native-speaker corpus. In the case of native-
speaker corpora, published texts such as newspa-
per articles or novels can be used as a corpus. By
contrast, in the case of learner corpora, we must
find learners and then let them write since there
are no such published texts written by learners of
English (unless they are part of a learner corpus).
Here, it should be emphasized that learners often
do not spontaneously write but are typically obliged
to write, for example, in class, or during an exam.
Because of this, learners may soon become tired of
writing. This in itself can affect learner corpus cre-
ation much more than one would expect especially
when creating a longitudinal learner corpus. Thus, it
is crucial to keep learners motivated and focused on
the writing assignments.

The second difficulty arises when the collected
texts are transformed into a learner corpus. This
involves several time-consuming and troublesome
tasks. The texts must be archived in electronic
form, which requires typing every single collected
text since learners normally write on paper. Be-
sides, each text must be archived and maintained
with accompanying information such as who wrote
what text when and on what topic. Optionally, a
learner corpus could include other pieces of infor-
mation such as proficiency, first language, and age.
Once the texts have been electronically archived, it
is relatively easy to maintain and access them. How-
ever, this is not the case when the texts are first col-
lected. Thus, it is better to have an efficient method
for managing such information as well as the texts
themselves.

The third difficulty concerning copyright is a
daunting problem. The copyright for each text
must be transferred to the corpus creator so that the
learner corpus can be made available to the public.
Consider the case when a number of learners par-
ticipate in a learner corpus creation project and ev-
eryone has to sign a copyright transfer form. This is-
sue becomes even more complicated when the writer
does not actually have such a right to transfer copy-
right. For instance, under the Japanese law, those
younger than 20 years of age do not have the right;
instead their parents do. Thus, corpus creators have
to ask learners’ parents to sign copyright transfer
forms. This is often the case since the writers in
learner corpus creation projects are normally junior

high school, high school, or college students.

The final difficulty is in error and POS/parsing
annotation. For error annotation, several annota-
tion schemes exist (for example, the NICT JLE
scheme (Izumi et al., 2005)). While designing an an-
notation scheme is one issue, annotating errors is yet
another. No matter how well an annotation scheme
is designed, there will always be exceptions. Every
time an exception appears, it becomes necessary to
revise the annotation scheme. Another issue we have
to remember is that there is a trade-off between the
granularity of an annotation scheme and the level of
the difficulty in error annotation. The more detailed
an annotation scheme is, the more information it can
contain and the more difficult identifying errors is,
and vice versa.

For POS/parsing annotation, there are also a num-
ber of annotation schemes including the Brown tag
set, the Claws tag set, and the Penn Treebank tag
set. However, none of them are designed to be used
for learner corpora. In other words, a variety of lin-
guistic phenomena occur in learner corpora which
the existing annotation schemes do not cover. For
instance, spelling errors often appear in texts writ-
ten by learners of English as in sard year, which
should be third year. Grammatical errors prevent us
applying existing annotation schemes, too. For in-
stance, there are at least three possibilities for POS-
tagging the word sing in the sentence everyone sing
together. using the Penn Treebank tag set: sing/VB,
sing/VBP, or sing/VBZ. The following example is
more complicated: I don’t success cooking. Nor-
mally, the word success is not used as a verb but
as a noun. The instance, however, appears in a po-
sition where a verb appears. As a result, there are
at least two possibilities for tagging: success/NN
and success/VB. Errors in mechanics are also prob-
lematic as in Tonight,we and beautifulhouse (miss-
ing spaces)2. One solution is to split them to obtain
the correct strings and then tag them with a normal
scheme. However, this would remove the informa-
tion that spaces were originally missing which we
want to preserve. To handle these and other phe-
nomena which are peculiar to learner corpora, we
need to develop a novel annotation scheme.

2Note that the KJ corpus consists of typed essays.

3 Method

3.1 How to Collect and Maintain Texts Written
by Learners

Our text-collection method is based on writing exer-
cises. In the writing exercises, learners write essays
on a blog system. This very simple idea of using a
blog system naturally solves the problem of archiv-
ing texts in electronic form. In addition, the use of a
blog system enables us to easily register and main-
tain accompanying information including who (user
ID) writes when (uploaded time) and on what topic
(title of blog item). Besides, once registered in the
user profile, the optional pieces of information such
as proficiency, first language, and age are also easy
to maintain and access.

To design the writing exercises, we consulted
with several teachers of English and conducted pre-
experiments. Ten learners participated in the pre-
experiments and were assigned five essay topics on
average. Based on the experimental results, we
designed the procedure of the writing exercise as
shown in Table 2. In the first step, learners are as-
signed an essay topic. In the second step, they are
given time to prepare during which they think about
what to write on the given topic before they start
writing. We found that this enables the students to
write more. In the third step, they actually write an
essay on the blog system. After they have finished
writing, they submit their essay to the blog system
to be registered.

The following steps were considered optional. We
implemented an article error detection method (Na-
gata et al., 2006) in the blog system as a trial at-
tempt to keep the learners motivated since learners
are likely to become tired of doing the same exercise
repeatedly. To reduce this, the blog system high-
lights where article errors exist after the essay has
been submitted. The hope is that this might prompt
the learners to write more accurately and to continue
the exercises. In the pre-experiments, the detection
did indeed seem to interest the learners and to pro-
vide them with additional motivation. Considering
these results, we decided to include the fourth and
fifth steps in the writing exercises when we created
our learner corpus. At the same time, we should of
course be aware that the use of error detection affects
learners’ writing. For example, it may change the

distribution of errors. Nagata and Nakatani (2010)
reported the effects in detail.

To solve the problem of copyright transfer, we
took legal professional advice but were informed
that, in Japan at least, the only way to be sure is
to have a copyright transfer form signed every time.
We considered having it signed on the blog system,
but it soon turned out that this did not work since
participating learners may still be too young to have
the legal right to sign the transfer. It is left for our
long-term future work to devise a better solution to
this legal issue.

3.2 Annotation Scheme
This subsection describes the error and
POS/chunking annotation schemes. Note that
errors and POS/chunking are annotated separately,
meaning that there are two files for any given text.
Due to space restrictions we limit ourselves to only
summarizing our annotation schemes in this section.
The full descriptions are available together with the
annotated corpus on the web.

3.2.1 Error Annotation
We based our error annotation scheme on that used
in the NICT JLE corpus (Izumi et al., 2003a), whose
detailed description is readily available, for exam-
ple, in Izumi et al. (2005). In that annotation
scheme and accordingly in ours, errors are tagged
using an XML syntax; an error is annotated by tag-
ging a word or phrase that contains it. For in-
stance, a tense error is annotated as follows: I � v tns
crr=“made” � make � /v tns � pies last year.

where v tns denotes a tense error in a verb. It
should be emphasized that the error tags contain the
information on correction together with error anno-
tation. For instance, crr=“made” in the above ex-
ample denotes the correct form of the verb is made.
For missing word errors, error tags are placed where

1213



a word or phrase is missing (e.g., My friends live
� prp crr=“in” ��� /prp � these places.).

As a pilot study, we applied the NICT JLE annota-
tion scheme to a learner corpus to reveal what mod-
ifications we needed to make. The learner corpus
consisted of 455 essays (39,716 words) written by
junior high and high school students3. The follow-
ing describes the major modifications deemed nec-
essary as a result of the pilot study.

The biggest difference between the NICT JLE
corpus and our targeted corpus is that the former is
spoken data and the latter is written data. This differ-
ence inevitably requires several modifications to the
annotation scheme. In speech data, there are no er-
rors in spelling and mechanics such as punctuation
and capitalization. However, since such errors are
not usually regarded as grammatical errors, we de-
cided simply not to annotate them in our annotation
schemes.

Another major difference is fragment errors.
Fragments that do not form a complete sentence of-
ten appear in the writing of learners (e.g., I have
many books. Because I like reading.). In written
language, fragments can be regarded as a grammat-
ical error. To annotate fragment errors, we added a
new tag � f � (e.g., I have many books. � f � Because
I like reading. � /f � ).

As discussed in Sect. 2, there is a trade-off be-
tween the granularity of an annotation scheme and
the level of the difficulty in annotating errors. In our
annotation scheme, we narrowed down the number
of tags to 22 from 46 in the original NICT JLE tag
set to facilitate the annotation; the 22 tags are shown
in Appendix A. The removed tags are merged into
the tag for other. For instance, there are only three
tags for errors in nouns (number, lexis, and other) in
our tag set whereas there are six in the NICT JLE
corpus (inflection, number, case, countability, com-
plement, and lexis); the other tag ( � n o � ) covers
the four removed tags.

3.2.2 POS/Chunking Annotation
We selected the Penn Treebank tag set, which is
one of the most widely used tag sets, for our

work started. Learners wrote their essays on paper. Unfortu-
nately, this learner corpus cannot be made available to the pub-
lic since the copyrights were not transferred to us.

POS/chunking annotation scheme. Similar to the er-
ror annotation scheme, we conducted a pilot study
to determine what modifications we needed to make
to the Penn Treebank scheme. In the pilot study, we
used the same learner corpus as in the pilot study for
the error annotation scheme.

As a result of the pilot study, we found that the
Penn Treebank tag set sufficed in most cases except
for errors which learners made. Considering this, we
determined a basic rule as follows: “Use the Penn
Treebank tag set and preserve the original texts as
much as possible.” To handle such errors, we made
several modifications and added two new POS tags
(CE and UK) and another two for chunking (XP and
PH), which are described below.

A major modification concerns errors in mechan-
ics such as Tonight,we and beautifulhouse as already
explained in Sect. 2. We use the symbol “-” to an-
notate such cases. For instance, the above two ex-
amples are annotated as follows: Tonight,we/NN-
,-PRP and beautifulhouse/JJ-NN. Note that each
POS tag is hyphenated. It can also be used
for annotating chunks in the same manner. For
instance, Tonight,we is annotated as [NP-PH-NP
Tonight,we/NN-,-PRP ]. Here, the tag PH stands for�

chunk label and denotes tokens which are not
normally chunked (cf., [NP Tonight/NN ] ,/, [NP
we/PRP ]).

Another major modification was required to han-
dle grammatical errors. Essentially, POS/chunking
tags are assigned according to the surface informa-
tion of the word in question regardless of the ex-
istence of any errors. For example, There is ap-
ples. is annotated as [NP There/EX ] [VP is/VBZ
] [NP apples/NNS ] ./. Additionally, we define the
CE4 tag to annotate errors in which learners use a
word with a POS which is not allowed such as in I
don’t success cooking. The CE tag encodes a POS
which is obtained from the surface information to-
gether with the POS which would have been as-
signed to the word if it were not for the error. For
instance, the above example is tagged as I don’t
success/CE:NN:VB cooking. In this format, the sec-
ond and third POSs are separated by “:” which de-
notes the POS which is obtained from the surface
information and the POS which would be assigned

4CE stands for cognitive error.

1214



to the word without an error. The user can select
either POS depending on his or her purposes. Note
that the CE tag is compatible with the basic anno-
tation scheme because we can retrieve the basic an-
notation by extracting only the second element (i.e.,
success/NN). If the tag is unknown because of gram-
matical errors or other phenomena, UK and XP5 are
used for POS and chunking, respectively.

For spelling errors, the corresponding POS and
chunking tag are assigned to mistakenly spelled
words if the correct forms can be guessed (e.g., [NP
sird/JJ year/NN ]); otherwise UK and XP are used.

4 The Corpus

We carried out a learner corpus creation project us-
ing the described method. Twenty six Japanese col-
lege students participated in the project. At the be-
ginning, we had the students or their parents sign
a conventional paper-based copyright transfer form.
After that, they did the writing exercise described in
Sect. 3 once or twice a week over three months. Dur-
ing that time, they were assigned ten topics, which
were determined based on a writing textbook (Ok-
ihara, 1985). As described in Sect. 3, they used a
blog system to write, submit, and rewrite their es-
says. Through out the exercises, they did not have
access to the others’ essays and their own previous
essays.

As a result, 233 essays were collected; Table 3
shows the statistics on the collected essays. It turned
out that the learners had no difficulties in using the
blog system and seemed to focus on writing. Out of
the 26 participants, 22 completed the 10 assignments
while one student quit before the exercises started.

We annotated the grammatical errors of all 233
essays. Two persons were involved in the annota-
tion. After the annotation, another person checked
the annotation results; differences in error annota-

tion were resolved by consulting the first two. The
error annotation scheme was found to work well on
them. The error-annotated essays can be used for
evaluating error detection/correction methods.

For POS/chunking annotation, we chose 170 es-
says out of 233. We annotated them using our
POS/chunking scheme; hereafter, the 170 essays
will be referred to as the shallow-parsed corpus.

5 Using the Corpus and Discussion

5.1 POS Tagging

The 170 essays in the shallow-parsed corpus was
used for evaluating existing POS-tagging techniques
on texts written by learners. It consisted of 2,411
sentences and 22,452 tokens.

HMM-based and CRF-based POS taggers were
tested on the shallow-parsed corpus. The former was
implemented using tri-grams by the author. It was
trained on a corpus consisting of English learning
materials (213,017 tokens). The latter was CRFTag-
ger6, which was trained on the WSJ corpus. Both
use the Penn Treebank POS tag set.

The performance was evaluated using accuracy
defined by

number of tokens correctly POS-tagged
number of tokens � (1)

If the number of tokens in a sentence was differ-
ent in the human annotation and the system out-
put, the sentence was excluded from the calcula-
tion. This discrepancy sometimes occurred because
the tokenization of the system sometimes differed
from that of the human annotators. As a result, 19
and 126 sentences (215 and 1,352 tokens) were ex-
cluded from the evaluation in the HMM-based and
CRF-based POS taggers, respectively.

Table 4 shows the results. The second column
corresponds to accuracies on a native-speaker cor-
pus (sect. 00 of the WSJ corpus). The third column
corresponds to accuracies on the learner corpus.

As shown in Table 4, the CRF-based POS tagger
suffers a decrease in accuracy as expected. Interest-
ingly, the HMM-based POS tagger performed bet-
ter on the learner corpus. This is perhaps because it

was trained on a corpus consisting of English learn-
ing materials whose distribution of vocabulary was
expected to be relatively similar to that of the learner
corpus. By contrast, it did not perform well on the
native-speaker corpus because the size of the train-
ing corpus was relatively small and the distribution
of vocabulary was not similar, and thus unknown
words often appeared. This implies that selecting
appropriate texts as a training corpus may improve
the performance.

Table 5 shows the top five POSs mistakenly
tagged as other POSs. An obvious cause of mis-
takes in both taggers is that they inevitably make
errors in the POSs that are not defined in the Penn
Treebank tag set, that is, UK and CE. A closer
look at the tagging results revealed that phenom-
ena which were common to the writing of learners
were major causes of other mistakes. Errors in cap-
italization partly explain why the taggers made so
many mistakes in NN (singular nouns). They often
identified erroneously capitalized common nouns
as proper nouns as in This Summer/NNP Vaca-
tion/NNP. Spelling errors affected the taggers in the
same way. Grammatical errors also caused confu-
sion between POSs. For instance, omission of a cer-
tain word often caused confusion between a verb and
an adjective as in I frightened/VBD. which should
be I (was) frightened/JJ. Another interesting case
is expressions that learners overuse (e.g., and/CC
so/RB on/RB and so/JJ so/JJ). Such phrases are not
erroneous but are relatively infrequent in native-
speaker corpora. Therefore, the taggers tended to
identify their POSs according to the surface infor-
mation on the tokens themselves when such phrases
appeared in the learner corpus (e.g., and/CC so/RB
on/IN and so/RB so/RB). We should be aware that
tokenization is also problematic although failures in
tokenization were excluded from the accuracies.

The influence of the decrease in accuracy on other
NLP tasks is expected to be task and/or method de-
pendent. Methods that directly use or handle se-

quences of POSs are likely to suffer from it. An
example is the error detection method (Chodorow
and Leacock, 2000), which identifies unnatural se-
quences of POSs as grammatical errors in the writ-
ing of learners. As just discussed above, existing
techniques often fail in sequences of POSs that have
a grammatical error. For instance, an existing POS
tagger likely tags the sentence I frightened. as I/PRP
frightened/VBD ./. as we have just seen, and in turn
the error detection method cannot identify it as an
error because the sequence PRP VBD is not unnatu-
ral; it would correctly detect it if the sentence were
correctly tagged as I/PRP frightened/JJ ./. For the
same reason, the decrease in accuracy may affect the
methods (Aarts and Granger, 1998; Granger, 1998;
Tono, 2000) for extracting interesting sequences of
POSs from learner corpora; for example, BOS7 PRP
JJ is an interesting sequence but is never extracted
unless the phrase is correctly POS-tagged. It re-
quires further investigation to reveal how much im-
pact the decrease has on these methods. By contrast,
error detection/correction methods based on the bag-
of-word features (or feature vectors) are expected to
suffer less from it since mistakenly POS-tagged to-
kens are only one of the features. At the same time,
we should notice that if the target errors are in the
tokens that are mistakenly POS-tagged, the detec-
tion will likely fail (e.g., verbs should be correctly
identified in tense error detection).

In addition to the above evaluation, we at-
tempted to improve the POS taggers using the
transformation-based POS-tagging technique (Brill,
1994). In the technique, transformation rules are
obtained by comparing the output of a POS tagger
and the human annotation so that the differences be-
tween the two are reduced. We used the shallow-

parsed corpus as a test corpus and the other man-
ually POS-tagged corpus created in the pilot study
described in Subsect. 3.2.1 as a training corpus. We
used POS-based and word-based transformations as
Brill (1994) described.

Table 6 shows the improvements together with the
original accuracies. Table 6 reveals that even the
simple application of Brill’s technique achieves a
slight improvement in both taggers. Designing the
templates of the transformation for learner corpora
may achieve further improvement.

5.2 Head Noun Identification
In the evaluation of chunking, we focus on head
noun identification. Head noun identification often
plays an important role in error detection/correction.
For example, it is crucial to identify head nouns to
detect errors in article and number.

We again used the shallow-parsed corpus as a test
corpus. The essays contained 3,589 head nouns.
We implemented an HMM-based chunker using 5-
grams whose input is a sequence of POSs, which
was obtained by the HMM-based POS tagger de-
scribed in the previous subsection. The chunker was
trained on the same corpus as the HMM-based POS
tagger. The performance was evaluated by recall and
precision defined by

respectively.
Table 7 shows the results. To our surprise, the

chunker performed better than we had expected. A
possible reason for this is that sentences written by
learners of English tend to be shorter and simpler in
terms of their structure.

The results in Table 7 also enable us to quanti-
tatively estimate expected improvement in error de-
tection/correction which is achieved by improving

chunking. To see this, let us define the following
symbols: � : Recall of head noun identification, 	 :
recall of error detection without chunking error, 
	
recall of error detection with chunking error. 	 and

	 are interpreted as the true recall of error detection

and its observed value when chunking error exists,
respectively. Here, note that 
	 can be expressed
as 
	����	 . For instance, according to Han et al.
(2006), their method achieves a recall of 0.40 (i.e.,

	���� ��� ), and thus 	���� ����� assuming that chunk-ing errors exist and recall of head noun identification

is ����� ��� � just as in this evaluation. Improving � to����� ����� would achieve 	���� ����� without any mod-ification to the error detection method. Precision can
also be estimated in a similar manner although it re-
quires a more complicated calculation.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we discussed the difficulties inherent in
learner corpus creation and a method for efficiently
creating a learner corpus. We described the manu-
ally error-annotated and shallow-parsed learner cor-
pus which was created using this method. We also
showed its usefulness in developing and evaluating
POS taggers and chunkers. We believe that publish-
ing this corpus will give researchers a common de-
velopment and test set for developing related NLP
techniques including error detection/correction and
POS-tagging/chunking, which will facilitate further
research in these areas.

A Error tag set

This is the list of our error tag set. It is based on the
NICT JLE tag set (Izumi et al., 2005).
� n: noun

– num: number
– lxc: lexis
– o: other

� v: verb
– agr: agreement

Recall Precision
0.903 0.907

Table 7: Performance on head noun identification.

– tns: tense
– lxc: lexis
– o: other

� mo: auxiliary verb
� aj: adjective

– lxc: lexis
– o: other

� av: adverb
� prp: preposition

– lxc: lexis
– o: other

� at: article
� pn: pronoun
� con: conjunction
� rel: relative clause
� itr: interrogative
� olxc: errors in lexis in more than two words
� ord: word order
� uk: unknown error
� f: fragment error
