Abstract

We describe the WIKIQA dataset, a new
publicly available set of question and sen-
tence pairs, collected and annotated for re-
search on open-domain question answer-
ing. Most previous work on answer sen-
tence selection focuses on a dataset cre-
ated using the TREC-QA data, which
includes editor-generated questions and
candidate answer sentences selected by
matching content words in the question.
WIKIQA is constructed using a more nat-
ural process and is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the previous dataset.
In addition, the WIKIQA dataset also in-
cludes questions for which there are no
correct sentences, enabling researchers to
work on answer triggering, a critical com-
ponent in any QA system. We compare
several systems on the task of answer sen-
tence selection on both datasets and also
describe the performance of a system on
the problem of answer triggering using the
WIKIQA dataset.

1 Introduction

Answer sentence selection is a crucial subtask of
the open-domain question answering (QA) prob-
lem, with the goal of extracting answers from a
set of pre-selected sentences (Heilman and Smith,
2010; Yao et al., 2013; Severyn and Moschitti,
2013). In order to conduct research on this im-
portant problem, Wang et al. (2007) created a
dataset, which we refer to by QASENT, based on
the TREC-QA data. The QASENT dataset chose
questions in TREC 8-13 QA tracks and selected
sentences that share one or more non-stopwords
from the questions. Although QASENT has since

become the benchmark dataset for the answer se-
lection problem, its creation process actually in-
troduces a strong bias in the types of answers that
are included. The following example illustrates an
answer that does not share any content words with
the question and would not be selected:

Q: How did Seminole war end?
A: Ultimately, the Spanish Crown ceded the
colony to United States rule.

One significant concern with this approach is that
the lexical overlap will make sentence selection
easier for the QASENT dataset and might inflate
the performance of existing systems in more natu-
ral settings. For instance, Yih et al. (2013) find that
simple word matching methods outperform many
sophisticated approaches on the dataset. We ex-
plore this possibility in Section 3.

A second, more subtle challenge for question
answering is that it normally assumes that there is
at least one correct answer for each question in the
candidate sentences. During the data construction
procedures, all the questions without correct an-
swers are manually discarded.1 We address a new
challenge of answer triggering, an important com-
ponent in QA systems, where the goal is to detect
whether there exist correct answers in the set of
candidate sentences for the question, and return a
correct answer if there exists such one.

We present WIKIQA, a dataset for open-
domain question answering.2 The dataset con-
tains 3,047 questions originally sampled from
Bing query logs. Based on the user clicks, each
question is associated with a Wikipedia page pre-
sumed to be the topic of the question. In order to
eliminate answer sentence biases caused by key-
word matching, we consider all the sentences in

1The policy is adopted both by the official
QASENT tracks (Voorhees and Tice, 1999) and by Wang et
al. (2007).

the summary paragraph of the page as the candi-
date answer sentences, with labels on whether the
sentence is a correct answer to the question pro-
vided by crowdsourcing workers. Among these
questions, about one-third of them contain correct
answers in the answer sentence set.

We implement several strong baselines to study
model behaviors in the two datasets, including
two previous state-of-the-art systems (Yih et al.,
2013; Yu et al., 2014) on the QASENT dataset
as well as simple lexical matching methods. The
results show that lexical semantic methods yield
better performance than sentence semantic mod-
els on QASENT, while sentence semantic ap-
proaches (e.g., convolutional neural networks)
outperform lexical semantic models on WIKIQA.
We propose to evaluate answer triggering using
question-level precision, recall and F1 scores. The
best F1 scores are slightly above 30%, which sug-
gests a large room for improvement.

2 WIKIQA Dataset

In this section, we describe the process of creat-
ing our WIKIQA dataset in detail, as well as some
comparisons to the QASENT dataset.

2.1 Question & Sentence Selection

In order to reflect the true information need of gen-
eral users, we used Bing query logs as the ques-
tion source. Taking the logs from the period of
May 1st, 2010 to July 31st, 2011, we first se-
lected question-like queries using simple heuris-
tics, such as queries starting with a WH-word
(e.g., “what” or “how”) and queries ending with
a question mark. In addition, we filtered out some
entity queries that satisfy the rules, such as the TV
show “how I met your mother.” In the end, approx-
imately 2% of the queries were selected. To fo-
cus on factoid questions and to improve the ques-
tion quality, we then selected only the queries is-
sued by at least 5 unique users and have clicks to
Wikipedia. Among them, we sampled 3,050 ques-
tions based on query frequencies.

Because the summary section of a Wikipedia
page provides the basic and usually most impor-
tant information about the topic, we used sen-
tences in this section as the candidate answers.
Figure 1 shows an example question, as well as
the summary section of a linked Wikipedia page.

Question: Who wrote second Corinthians?

Second Epistle to the Corinthians The Second Epistle to the Corinthi-
ans, often referred to as Second Corinthians (and written as 2 Corinthi-
ans), is the eighth book of the New Testament of the Bible. Paul the
Apostle and “Timothy our brother” wrote this epistle to “the church of
God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia”.

Figure 1: An example question and the summary
paragraph of a Wikipedia page.

2.2 Sentence Annotation

We employed crowdsourcing workers through a
platform, which is similar to Amazon MTurk, to
label whether the candidate answer sentences of
a question are correct. We designed a cascaded
Web UI that consists of two stages. The first
stage shows a testing question, along with the ti-
tle and the summary paragraph of the associated
Wikipedia page, asking the worker “Does the short
paragraph answer the question?” If the worker
chooses “No”, then equivalently all the sentences
in this paragraph are marked incorrect and the UI
moves to the next question. Otherwise, the sys-
tem enters the second stage and puts a checkbox
along each sentence. The worker is then asked to
check the sentences that can answer the question
in isolation, assuming coreference is resolved. To
ensure the label quality, each question was labeled
by three workers. Sentences with inconsistent la-
bels would be verified by a different set of crowd-
sourcing workers. The final decision was based on
the majority vote of all the workers. In the end, we
included 3,047 questions and 29,258 sentences in
the dataset, where 1,473 sentences were labeled as
answer sentences to their corresponding questions.

Although not used in the experiments, each of
these answer sentence is associated with the an-
swer phrase, which is defined as the shortest sub-
string of the sentence that answers the question.
For instance, the second sentence in the summary
paragraph shown in Figure 1 is an answer sen-
tence. Its substring “Paul the Apostle and Tim-
othy our brother” can be treated as the answer
phrase. The annotations of the answer phrases
were given by the authors of this paper. Because
the answer phrase boundary can be highly ambigu-
ous, each sentence is associated with at most two
answer phrases that are both acceptable, given by
two different labelers. We hope this addition to
the WIKIQA data can be beneficial to future re-
searchers for building or evaluating an end-to-end
question answering system.

2.3 WIKIQA vs. QASENT

Our WIKIQA dataset differs from the existing
QASENT dataset in both question and candi-
date answer sentence distributions. Questions in
QASENT were originally used in TREC 8-13 QA
tracks and were a mixture of questions from query
logs (e.g., Excite and Encarta) and from human
editors. The questions might be outdated and do
not reflect the true information need of a QA sys-
tem user. By contrast, questions in WIKIQA were
sampled from real queries of Bing without edi-
torial revision. On the sentence side, the can-
didate sentences in QASENT were selected from
documents returned by past participating teams in
the TREC QA tracks, and sentences were only
included if they shared content words from the
questions. These procedures make the distribu-
tion of the candidate sentence skewed and unnat-
ural. In comparison, 20.3% of the answers in
the WIKIQA dataset share no content words with
questions. Candidate sentences in WIKIQA were
chosen from relevant Wikipedia pages directly,
which could be closer to the input of an answer
sentence selection module of a QA system.

To make it easy to compare results of dif-
ferent QA systems when evaluated on the
WIKIQA dataset, we randomly split the data
to training (70%), development (10%) and
testing (20%) sets. Some statistics of the
QASENT and WIKIQA datasets are presented in
Tables 1 and 2.3 WIKIQA contains an order of

data contains more questions, only 94 of them are paired with

magnitude more questions and three times more
answer sentences compared to QASENT. Unlike
QASENT, we did not filter questions with only
incorrect answers, as they are still valuable for
model training and more importantly, useful for
evaluating the task of answer triggering, as de-
scribed in Section 3. Specifically, we find nearly
two-thirds of questions contain no correct answers
in the candidate sentences.

The distributions of question types in these two
datasets are also different, as shown in Table 3.4

WIKIQA contains more description or definition
questions, which could be harder to answer.

3 Experiments

Many systems have been proposed and tested on
the QASENT dataset, including lexical semantic
models (Yih et al., 2013) and sentence seman-
tic models (Yu et al., 2014). We investigate the
performance of several systems on WIKIQA and
QASENT. As discussed in Section 2, WIKIQA of-
fers us the opportunity to evaluate QA systems on
answer triggering. We propose simple metrics and
perform a feature study on the new task. Finally,
we include some error analysis and discussion at
the end of this section.

3.1 Baseline Systems

We consider two simple word matching methods:
Word Count and Weighted Word Count. The first
method counts the number of non-stopwords in the
question that also occur in the answer sentence.
The second method re-weights the counts by the
IDF values of the question words.

We reimplement LCLR (Yih et al., 2013), an
answer sentence selection approach that achieves
very competitive results on QASENT. LCLR

sentences that have human annotations.
4The classifier is trained using a logistic regression

model on the UIUC Question Classification Datasets (http:
//cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/QA/QC). The
performance is comparable to (Li and Roth, 2002).

makes use of rich lexical semantic features,
including word/lemma matching, WordNet and
vector-space lexical semantic models. We do not
include features for Named Entity matching.5

We include two sentence semantic methods,
Paragraph Vector6 (PV; Le and Mikolov, 2014)
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN; Yu et
al., 2014). The model score of PV is the cosine
similarity score between the question vector and
the sentence vector. We follow Yu et al. (2014) and
employ a bigram CNN model with average pool-
ing. We use the pre-trained word2vec embeddings
provided by Mikolov et al. (2013) as model input.7

For computational reasons, we truncate sentences
up to 40 tokens for our CNN models.

Finally, we combine each of the two sentence
semantic models with the two word matching fea-
tures by training a logistic regression classifier, re-
ferring as PV-Cnt and CNN-Cnt. CNN-Cnt has
been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on
the QASENT dataset (Yu et al., 2014).

3.2 Evaluation of Answer Triggering

The task of answer sentence selection assumes that
there exists at least one correct answer in the can-
didate answer sentence set. Although the assump-
tion simplifies the problem of question answering,
it is unrealistic for practical QA systems. Modern
QA systems rely on an independent component to
pre-select candidate answer sentences, which uti-
lizes various signals such as lexical matching and
user behaviors. However, the candidate sentences

5The improvement gains from the features are marginal
on the QASENT dataset.

graph Vector, as we found it significantly outperforms the
Distributed Memory version of Paragraph Vector.

are not guaranteed to contain the correct answers,
no matter what kinds of pre-selection components
are employed. We propose the answer triggering
task, a new challenge for the question answering
problem, which requires QA systems to: (1) de-
tect whether there is at least one correct answer in
the set of candidate sentences for the question; (2)
if yes, select one of the correct answer sentences
from the candidate sentence set.

Previous work adopts MAP and MRR to eval-
uate the performance of a QA system on answer
sentence selection. Both metrics evaluate the rela-
tive ranks of correct answers in the candidate sen-
tences of a question, and hence are not suitable for
evaluating the task of answer triggering. We need
metrics that consider both the presence of answers
with respect to a question and the correctness of
system predictions.

We employ precision, recall and F1 scores for
answer triggering, at the question level. In partic-
ular, we compute these metrics by aggregating all
the candidate sentences of a question. A question
is treated as a positive case only if it contains one
or more correct answer sentences in its candidate
sentence pool. For the prediction of a question, we
only consider the sentence in the candidate set that
has the highest model score. If the score is above
a predefined threshold and the sentence is labeled
as a correct answer to the question, then it means
that the prediction is correct and the question is
answered correctly.

3.3 Results

WIKIQA vs. QASENT The MAP and MRR
results are presented in Table 4. We only evalu-
ate questions with answers in the WIKIQA dataset
under these metrics. On the QASENT dataset, as
found by prior work, the two word matching meth-
ods are very strong baselines, in which they sig-

2016



nificantly outperform sentence semantic models.
By incorporating rich lexical semantic informa-
tion, LCLR further improves the results. CNN-
Cnt gives results that match LCLR, and PV-Cnt
performs worse than CNN-Cnt.8

The story on the WIKIQA dataset is differ-
ent. First, methods purely rely on word match-
ing are not sufficient to achieve good results. Sec-
ond, CNN significantly outperforms simple word
matching methods and performs slightly better
than LCLR, which suggests that semantic under-
standing beyond lexical semantics is important for
obtaining good performance on WIKIQA. Finally,
word matching features help to further boost CNN
results by approximately 3 to 4 points in both
MAP and MRR.

Evaluation of answer triggering on WIKIQA
We evaluate the best system CNN-Cnt on the task
of answer triggering, and the results are shown in
Table 5. We tune the model scores for making pre-
dictions with respect to F1 scores on the dev set,
due to the highly skewed class distribution in train-
ing data. The absolute F1 scores are relative low,
which suggests a large room for improvement.

We further study three additional features:
the length of question (QLen), the length of
sentence (SLen), and the class of the ques-
tion (QClass). The motivation for adding these
features is to capture the hardness of the question
and comprehensiveness of the sentence. Note that
the two question features have no effects on MAP
and MRR. As shown in Table 5, the question-level
F1 score is substantially improved by adding a
simple QLen feature. This suggests that designing
features to capture question information is very
important for this task, which has been ignored in
the past. SLen features also give a small improve-
ment in the performance, and QClass feature has
slightly negative influence on the results.

3.4 Error Analysis & Discussion

The experimental results show that for the same
model, the performance on the WIKIQA dataset
is inferior to that on the QASENT dataset, which
suggests that WIKIQA is a more challenging
dataset. Examining the output of CNN-Cnt, the
best performing model, on the WIKIQA dev set
seems to suggest that deeper semantic understand-
ing and answer inference are often required. Be-

8Our CNN reimplementation performs slightly worse
than (Yu et al., 2014).

low are two examples selected that CNN-Cnt does
not correctly rank as the top answers:

Q1: What was the GE building in Rockefeller
Plaza called before?
A1: [GE Building] Known as the RCA Building
until 1988, it is most famous for housing the head-
quarters of the television network NBC.

Q2: How long was I Love Lucy on the air?
A2: [I Love Lucy] The black-and-white series
originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May
6, 1957, on the Columbia Broadcasting System
(CBS).

Answering the first question may require a better
semantic representation that captures the relation-
ship between “called before” and “known ... un-
til”. As for the second question, knowing that on
a TV channel (e.g., CBS) implies “on the air” and
a time span between two dates is legitimate to a
“how long” question is clearly beneficial.

4 Conclusion

We present WIKIQA, a new dataset for open-
domain question answering. The dataset is con-
structed in a natural and realistic manner, on which
we observed different behaviors of various meth-
ods compared with prior work. We hope that
WIKIQA enables research in the important prob-
lem of answer triggering and enables further re-
search in answer sentence selection in more real-
istic settings. We also hope that our empirical re-
sults will provide useful baselines in these efforts.
