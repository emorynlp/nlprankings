Metaphor is highly frequent in language, which makes its computational processing indis-
pensable for real-world NLP applications addressing semantic tasks. Previous approaches to
metaphor modeling rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge and operate on a limited domain
or a subset of phenomena. We present the first integrated open-domain statistical model of
metaphor processing in unrestricted text. Our method first identifies metaphorical expressions
in running text and then paraphrases them with their literal paraphrases. Such a text-to-text
model of metaphor interpretation is compatible with other NLP applications that can benefit
from metaphor resolution. Our approach is minimally supervised, relies on the state-of-the-art
parsing and lexical acquisition technologies (distributional clustering and selectional preference
induction), and operates with a high accuracy.

1. Introduction

Our production and comprehension of language is a multi-layered computational
process. Humans carry out high-level semantic tasks effortlessly by subconsciously
using a vast inventory of complex linguistic devices, while simultaneously integrating
their background knowledge, to reason about reality. An ideal computational model
of language understanding would also be capable of performing such high-level se-
mantic tasks. With the rapid advances in statistical natural language processing (NLP)
and computational lexical semantics, increasingly complex semantic tasks can now
be addressed. Tasks that have received much attention so far include, for example,
word sense disambiguation (WSD), supervised and unsupervised lexical classification,
selectional preference induction, and semantic role labeling. In this article, we take a
step further and show that state-of-the-art statistical NLP and computational lexical
semantic techniques can be used to successfully model complexmeaning transfers, such
as metaphor.

Metaphors arise when one concept is viewed in terms of the properties of another.
Humans often use metaphor to describe abstract concepts through reference to more
concrete or physical experiences. Some examples of metaphor include the following.

(1) How can I kill a process? (Martin 1988)

(2) Hillary brushed aside the accusations.

(3) I investedmyself fully in this research.

(4) And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And danceswith the daffodils.
(“I wandered lonely as a cloud,” William Wordsworth, 1804)

Metaphorical expressions may take a great variety of forms, ranging from conventional
metaphors, which we produce and comprehend every day, for example, those in Exam-
ples (1)–(3), to poetic and novel ones, such as Example (4). In metaphorical expressions,
seemingly unrelated features of one concept are attributed to another concept. In Ex-
ample (1), a computational process is viewed as something alive and, therefore, its forced
termination is associated with the act of killing. In Example (2) Hillary is not literally
cleaning the space by sweeping accusations. Instead, the accusations lose their validity
in that situation, in other words Hillary rejects them. The verbs brush aside and reject both
entail the resulting disappearance of their object, which is the shared salient property
that makes it possible for this analogy to be lexically expressed as a metaphor.

Characteristic of all areas of human activity (from poetic to ordinary to scientific)
and thus of all types of discourse, metaphor becomes an important problem for NLP.
As Shutova and Teufel (2010) have shown in an empirical study, the use of conventional
metaphor is ubiquitous in natural language text (according to their data, on average
every third sentence in general-domain text contains a metaphorical expression). This
makes metaphor processing essential for automatic text understanding. For example,
an NLP application which is unaware that a “leaked report” is a “disclosed report”
and not, for example, a “wet report,” would fail further semantic processing of the
piece of discourse in which this phrase appears. A system capable of recognizing and
interpreting metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text would become an invaluable
component of any real-world NLP application that needs to access semantics (e.g., infor-
mation retrieval [IR], machine translation [MT], question answering [QA], information
extraction [IE], and opinion mining).

So far, these applications have not used any metaphor processing techniques and
thus often fail to interpret metaphorical data correctly. Consider an example from MT.
Figure 1 shows metaphor translation from English into Russian by a state-of-the-art
statistical MT system (Google Translate1). For both sentences the MT system produces
literal translations of metaphorical terms in English, rather than their literal interpreta-
tions. This results in otherwise grammatical sentences being semantically infelicitous,
poorly formed, and barely understandable to a native speaker of Russian. The meaning
of stir in Figure 1 (1) and spill in Figure 1 (2) would normally be realized in Russian only
via their literal interpretation in the given context (provoke and tell), as shown under
CORRECT TRANSLATION in Figure 1. A metaphor processing component could help to

avoid such errors. We conducted a pilot study of the importance of metaphor for MT,
by running an English-to-Russian MT system (Google Translate) on the sentences from
the data set of Shutova (2010) containing single-word verb metaphors. We found that
27 out of 62 sentences (44%) were translated incorrectly due to metaphoricity. Due to
the high frequency of metaphor in text according to corpus studies, such a high level of
error becomes important for MT.

Examples where metaphor understanding is crucial can also be found in opinion
mining, that is, detection of the speaker’s attitude to what is said and to the topic.
Consider the following sentences.

(5) a. Government loosened its strangle-hold on business. (Narayanan 1999)

b. Government deregulated business. (Narayanan 1999)

Both sentences describe the same fact. The use of the metaphor loosened strangle-hold in
Example (5a) suggests that the speaker opposes government control of economy, how-
ever, whereas Example (5b) does not imply this. One can infer the speaker’s negative
attitude via the presence of a negativeword strangle-hold. Ametaphor processing system
would establish the correct meaning of Example (5a) and thus discover the actual fact
towards which the speaker has a negative attitude.

Because metaphor understanding requires resolving non-literal meanings via ana-
logical comparisons, the development of a complete and computationally practical
account of this phenomenon is a challenging and complex task. Despite the impor-
tance of metaphor for NLP systems dealing with semantic interpretation, its automatic
processing has received little attention in contemporary NLP, and is far from being a
solved problem. The majority of computational approaches to metaphor still exploit
ideas articulated two or three decades ago (Wilks 1978; Lakoff and Johnson 1980). They
often rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge (Martin 1990; Fass 1991; Narayanan
1997, 1999; Barnden and Lee 2002; Feldman and Narayanan 2004; Agerri et al. 2007)
and reduce the task to reasoning about a limited domain or a subset of phenomena
(Gedigian et al. 2006; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007). So far there has been no robust
statistical system operating on unrestricted text. State-of-the-art accurate parsing (Klein
andManning 2003; Briscoe, Carroll, andWatson 2006; Clark and Curran 2007), however,
as well as recent work on computational lexical semantics (Schulte im Walde 2006;

2009; Sun and Korhonen 2009; Abend and Rappoport 2010; Ó Séaghdha 2010) open up
many avenues for the creation of such a system. This is the niche the presented work is
intending to fill.

1.1 What Is Metaphor?

Metaphor has traditionally been viewed as an artistic device that lends vividness and
distinction to an author’s style. This view was first challenged by Lakoff and Johnson
(1980), who claimed that it is a productive phenomenon that operates at the level of
mental processes. According to Lakoff and Johnson, metaphor is thus not merely a
property of language (i.e., a linguistic phenomenon), but rather a property of thought
(i.e., a cognitive phenomenon). This view was subsequently adopted and extended
by a multitude of approaches (Grady 1997; Narayanan 1997; Fauconnier and Turner
2002; Feldman 2006; Pinker 2007) and the term conceptual metaphor was coined to
describe it.

The view postulates that metaphor is not limited to similarity-based meaning ex-
tensions of individual words, but rather involves reconceptualization of a whole area
of experience in terms of another. Thus metaphor always involves two concepts or
conceptual domains: the target (also called the topic or tenor in the linguistics literature)
and the source (also called the vehicle). Consider Examples (6) and (7).

(6) He shot down all of my arguments. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

(7) He attacked every weak point in my argument. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

According to Lakoff and Johnson, a mapping of the concept of argument to that of war is
used in both Examples (6) and (7). The argument, which is the target concept, is viewed
in terms of a battle (or awar), the source concept. The existence of such a link allows us to
talk about arguments using war terminology, thus giving rise to a number of metaphors.
Conceptual metaphor, or source–target domain mapping, is thus a generalization over
a set of individual metaphorical expressions that covers multiple cases in which ways
of reasoning about the source domain systematically correspond to ways of reasoning
about the target.

Conceptual metaphor manifests itself in natural language in the form of linguistic
metaphor (or metaphorical expressions) in a variety of ways. The most common types
of linguistic metaphor are lexical metaphor (i.e., metaphor at the level of a single
word sense, as in the Examples (1)–(4)), multi-word metaphorical expressions (e.g.,
“whether we go on pilgrimagewith Raleigh or put out to seawith Tennyson”), or extended
metaphor, that spans over longer discourse fragments.

Lexical metaphor is by far the most frequent type. In the presence of a certain
conceptual metaphor individual words can be used in entirely novel contexts, which
results in the formation of new meanings. Consider the following example.

(8) How can we build a ‘Knowledge economy’ if research is handcuffed? (Barque
and Chaumartin 2009)

In this sentence the physical verb handcuff is used with an abstract object research
and its meaning adapts accordingly. Metaphor is a productive phenomenon (i.e., its

304



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

novel examples continue to emerge in language). A large number of metaphorical
expressions, however, become conventionalized (e.g., “I cannot grasp his way of think-
ing”). Although metaphorical in nature, their meanings are deeply entrenched in every-
day use, and are thus cognitively treated as literal terms. Both novel and conventional
metaphors are important for text processing, hence our work is concerned with both
types. Fixed non-compositional idiomatic expressions (e.g., kick the bucket, rock the boat,
put a damper on), however, are left aside, because the mechanisms of their formation are
no longer productive in modern language and, as such, they are of little interest for the
design of a generalizable computational model of metaphor.

Extended metaphor refers to the use of metaphor at the discourse level. A famous
example of extended metaphor can be found in William Shakespeare’s play As You Like
It, where he first compares the world to a stage and then in the following discourse
describes its inhabitants as players. Extended metaphor often appears in literature
in the form of an allegory or a parable, whereby a whole story from one domain is
metaphorically transferred onto another in order to highlight certain attributes of the
subject or teach a moral lesson.

1.2 Computational Modeling of Metaphor

In this article we focus on lexical metaphor and the computational modeling thereof.
From an NLP viewpoint, not all metaphorical expressions are equally important. A
metaphorical expression is interesting for computational modeling if its metaphorical
sense is significantly distinct from its original literal sense and cannot be interpreted
directly (e.g., by existing word sense disambiguation techniques using a predefined
sense inventory). The identification of highly conventionalized metaphors (e.g., the
verb impress, whose meaning originally stems from printing) are not of interest for NLP
tasks, because their metaphorical senses have long been dominant in language and their
original literal senses may no longer be used. A number of conventionalizedmetaphors,
however, require explicit interpretation in order to be understood by computer (e.g.,
“cast doubt,” “polish the thesis,” “catch a disease”), as do all novel metaphors. Thus
we are concerned with both novel and conventional metaphors, but only consider the
cases whereby the literal and metaphorical senses of the word are in clear opposition in
common use in contemporary language.

Automatic processing of metaphor can be divided into two subtasks: metaphor
identification, or recognition (distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language
in text); and metaphor interpretation (identifying the intended literal meaning of a
metaphorical expression). An ideal metaphor processing system should address both
of these tasks and provide useful information to support semantic interpretation in
real-world NLP applications. In order to be directly applicable to other NLP systems,
it should satisfy the following criteria:

� Provide a representation of metaphor interpretation that can be easily
integrated with other NLP systems: This criterion places constraints
on how the metaphor processing task should be defined. The most
universally applicable metaphor interpretation would be in the text-to-text
form. This means that a metaphor processing system would take raw text
as input and provide a more literal text as output, in which metaphors
are interpreted.

305



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

� Operate on unrestricted running text: In order to be useful for real-world
NLP the system needs to be capable of processing real-world data. Rather
than only dealing with individual carefully selected clear-cut examples,
the system should be fully implemented and tested on free naturally
occurring text.

� Be open-domain: The system needs to cover all domains, genres, and
topics. Thus it should not rely on any domain-specific information or focus
on individual types of instances (e.g., a hand-chosen limited set of
source-target domain mappings).

� Be unsupervised or minimally supervised: To be easily adaptable to new
domains, the system needs to be unsupervised or minimally supervised.
This means it should not use any task-specific (i.e., metaphor-specific)
hand-coded knowledge. The only acceptable exception might be a
multi-purpose general-domain lexicon that is already in existence and
does not need to be created in a costly manner, although it would be an
advantage if no such resource is required.

� Cover all syntactic constructions: To be robust, the system needs to be
able to deal with metaphors represented by all word classes and syntactic
constructions.

In this article, we address both the metaphor identification and interpretation
tasks, resulting in the first integrated domain-independent corpus-based computational
model of metaphor. The method is designed with the listed criteria in mind. It takes
unrestricted text as input and produces textual output. Metaphor identification and
interpretation modules, based on the algorithms of Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010)
and Shutova (2010), are first evaluated independently, and then combined and evalu-
ated together as an integrated system. All components of the method are in principle
applicable to all part-of-speech classes and syntactic constructions. In the current ex-
periments, however, we tested the system only on single-word metaphors expressed by
a verb. Verbs are frequent in language and central to conceptual metaphor. Cameron
(2003) conducted a corpus study of the use of metaphor in educational discourse for all
parts of speech. She found that verbs account for around 50% of the data, the rest being
shared by nouns, adjectives, adverbs, copula constructions, and multi-word metaphors.
This suggests that verb metaphors provide a reliable testbed for both linguistic and
computational experiments. Restricting the scope to verbs is a methodological step
aimed at testing the main principles of the proposed approach in a well-defined setting.
We would, however, expect the presented methods to scale to other parts of speech
and to a wide range of syntactic constructions, because they rely on techniques from
computational lexical semantics that have been shown to be effective in modeling not
only verb meanings, but also those of nouns and adjectives.

As opposed to previous approaches that modeled metaphorical reasoning starting
from a hand-crafted description and applying it to explain the data, we aim to design
a statistical model that captures regular patterns of metaphoricity in a large corpus and
thus generalizes to unseen examples. Compared to labor-intensive manual efforts, this
approach is more robust and, being nearly unsupervised, cost-effective. In contrast to
previous statistical approaches, which addressed metaphors of a specific topic or did
not consider linguistic metaphor at all (e.g., Mason 2004), the proposed method covers
all metaphors in principle, can be applied to unrestricted text, and can be adapted to
different domains and genres.

306



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

Our first experiment is concerned with the identification of metaphorical expres-
sions in unrestricted text. Starting from a small set of metaphorical expressions, the
system learns the analogies involved in their production in aminimally supervised way.
It generalizes over the exemplified analogies by means of verb and noun clustering
(i.e., the identification of groups of similar concepts). This generalization allows it to
recognize previously unseen metaphorical expressions in text. Consider the following
examples:

(9) All of this stirred an uncontrollable excitement in her.

(10) Time and time again he would stare at the ground, hand on hip, and then
swallow his anger and play tennis.

Having once seen the metaphor “stir excitement” in Example (9) the metaphor identifi-
cation system successfully concludes that “swallow anger” in Example (10) is also used
metaphorically.

The identified metaphors then need to be interpreted. Ideally, a metaphor interpre-
tation task should be aimed at producing a representation of metaphor understanding
that can be directly embedded into other NLP applications that could benefit frommeta-
phor resolution. We define metaphor interpretation as a paraphrasing task and build
a system that discovers literal meanings of metaphorical expressions in text and pro-
duces their literal paraphrases. For example, for metaphors in Examples (11a) and (12a)
the system produces the paraphrases in Examples (11b) and (12b), respectively.

(11) a. All of this stirred an uncontrollable excitement in her.

b. All of this provoked an uncontrollable excitement in her.

(12) a. a carelessly leaked report

b. a carelessly disclosed report

The paraphrases for metaphorical expressions are acquired in a data-driven manner
from a large corpus. Literal paraphrases are then identified using a selectional prefer-
ence model.

This article first surveys the relevant theoretical and computational work on meta-
phor, then describes the design of the identification and paraphrasingmodules and their
independent evaluation, and concludes with the evaluation of the integrated text-to-text
metaphor processing system. The evaluations were carried out with the aid of human
subjects. In the case of identification, the subjects were asked to judge whether a system-
annotated phrase is a metaphor. In case of paraphrasing, they had to decide whether
the system-produced paraphrase for the metaphorical expression is correct and literal
in the given context. In addition, we created a metaphor paraphrasing gold standard
by asking human subjects (not previously exposed to system output) to produce their
own literal paraphrases for metaphorical verbs. The system paraphrasing was then also
evaluated against this gold standard.

2. Theoretical and Computational Background

2.1 Metaphor and Polysemy

Theorists of metaphor distinguish between two kinds of metaphorical language: novel
(or poetic) metaphors (i.e., those that are imaginative), and conventionalized metaphors

307



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

(i.e., those that are used as a part of an ordinary discourse). According to Nunberg
(1987), all metaphors emerge as novel, but over time they become part of general usage
and their rhetorical effect vanishes, resulting in conventionalized metaphors. Following
Orwell (1946), Nunberg calls such metaphors “dead” and claims that they are not
psychologically distinct from literally used terms. The scheme described by Nunberg
demonstrates how metaphorical associations capture patterns governing polysemy,
namely, the capacity of aword to havemultiplemeanings. Over time some of the aspects
of the target domain are added to the meaning of a term in the source domain, resulting
in a (metaphorical) sense extension of this term. Copestake and Briscoe (1995) discuss
sense extension mainly based on metonymic examples and model the phenomenon
using lexical rules encoding metonymic patterns. They also suggest that similar mecha-
nisms can be used to account for metaphorical processes. According to Copestake and
Briscoe, the conceptual mappings encoded in the sense extension rules would define
the limits to the possible shifts in meaning.

General-domain lexical resources often include information about metaphorical
word senses, although unsystematically and without any accompanying semantic an-
notation. For example, WordNet2 (Fellbaum 1998) contains the comprehension sense
of grasp, defined as “get the meaning of something,” and the reading sense of skim,
defined as “read superficially.” A great deal of metaphorical senses are absent from
the current version of WordNet, however. A number of researchers have advocated the
necessity of systematic inclusion and mark-up of metaphorical senses in such general-
domain lexical resources (Alonge and Castelli 2003; Lönneker and Eilts 2004) and claim
that this would be beneficial for the computational modeling of metaphor. Metaphor
processing systems could then either use this knowledge or be evaluated against it.
Lönneker (2004) mapped the senses from EuroWordNet3 to the Hamburg Metaphor
Database (Lönneker 2004; Reining and Lönneker-Rodman 2007) containing examples
of metaphorical expressions in German and French. Currently no explicit information
about metaphor is integrated into WordNet for English, however.

Although consistent inclusion in WordNet is in principle possible for conventional
metaphorical senses, it is not viable for novel contextual sense alternations. Because
metaphor is a productive phenomenon, all possible cases of contextual meaning alter-
nations it results in cannot be described via simple sense enumeration (Pustejovsky
1995). Computational metaphor processing therefore cannot be approached using the
standard word sense disambiguation paradigm, whereby the contextual use of a word
is classified according to an existing sense inventory. The metaphor interpretation task
is inherently more complex and requires generation of new and often uncommon
meanings of the metaphorical term based on the context.

2.2 Theoretical Views on Metaphor

The following views on metaphor are prominent in linguistics and philosophy: the
comparison view (e.g., the Structure-Mapping Theory of Gentner [1983]), the interaction
view (Black 1962; Hesse 1966), the selectional restrictions violation view (Wilks 1975,
1978), and conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). All of these

308



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

approaches share the idea of an interconceptual mapping that underlies the production
of metaphorical expressions. Gentner’s Structure-Mapping Theory postulates that the
ground for metaphor lies in similar properties and relations shared by the two con-
cepts (the target and the source). Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982), however, criticize
this view by noting that “everything has some feature or category that it shares with
everything else, but we cannot combine just any two things in metaphor” (Tourangeau
and Sternberg 1982, page 226). The interaction view focuses on the surprise and novelty
that metaphor introduces. Its proponents claim that the source concept (or domain) rep-
resents a template for seeing the target concept in an entirely new way. The conceptual
metaphor theory of Lakoff and Johnson (1980) takes this idea much further by stating
that metaphor operates at the level of thought rather than at the level of language, and
that it is based on a set of cognitive mappings between source and target domains. Thus
Lakoff and Johnson put the emphasis on the structural aspect of metaphor, rather than
its decorative function in language that dominated the preceding theories. The selec-
tional restrictions violation view of Wilks (1978) concerns manifestation of metaphor in
language. Wilks suggests that metaphor represents a violation of combinatory norms
in the linguistic context and that metaphorical expressions can be detected via such
violation.

2.2.1 Conceptual Metaphor Theory. Examples (6) and (7) provided a good illustration of
CMT. Lakoff and Johnson explain them via the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS
WAR, which is systematically reflected in language in a variety of expressions.

(13) Your claims are indefensible. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

(14) I demolished his argument. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

(15) I’ve never won an argument with him. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

(16) You disagree? Okay, shoot! (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)

According to CMT, we conceptualize and structure arguments in terms of battle, which
systematically influences the way we talk about arguments within our culture. In
other words, the conceptual structure behind battle (i.e., that one can shoot, demolish,
devise a strategy, win, and so on), is metaphorically transferred onto the domain of
argument.

Manifestations of conceptual metaphor are ubiquitous in language and communi-
cation. Here are a few other examples of common metaphorical mappings.

� TIME IS MONEY (e.g., “That flat tire costme an hour”)

� IDEAS ARE PHYSICAL OBJECTS (e.g., “I cannot grasp his way of
thinking”)

� LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS (e.g., “I would not
be able to put all my feelings intowords”)

� EMOTIONS ARE VEHICLES (e.g., “[...] she was transportedwith
pleasure”)

� FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS (e.g., “[...] all of this stirred an unfathomable
excitement in her”)

309



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

� LIFE IS A JOURNEY (e.g., “He arrived at the end of his life with very little
emotional baggage”)

CMT produced a significant resonance in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cogni-
tive science, and artificial intelligence, including NLP. It inspired novel research (Martin
1990, 1994; Narayanan 1997, 1999; Barnden and Lee 2002; Feldman andNarayanan 2004;
Mason 2004; Martin 2006; Agerri et al. 2007), but was also criticized for the lack of
consistency and empirical verification (Murphy 1996; Shalizi 2003; Pinker 2007). The
sole evidence with which Lakoff and Johnson (1980) supported their theory was a set of
carefully selected examples. Such examples, albeit clearly illustrating the main tenets of
the theory, are not representative. They cannot possibly capture the whole spectrum
of metaphorical expressions, and thus do not provide evidence that the theory can
adequately explain the majority of metaphors in real-world texts. Aiming to verify the
latter, Shutova and Teufel (2010) conducted a corpus-based analysis of conceptual meta-
phor in the data from the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard 2007). In their study
three independent participants annotated both linguistic metaphors and the underlying
source–target domain mappings. Their results show that although the annotators reach
some overall agreement on the annotation of interconceptual mappings, they experi-
enced a number of difficulties, one of which was the problem of finding the right level
of abstraction for the source and target domain categories. The difficulties in category
assignment for conceptual metaphor suggest that it is hard to consistently assign explicit
labels to source and target domains, even though the interconceptual associations exist
in some sense and are intuitive to humans.

2.2.2 Selectional Restrictions Violation View. Lakoff and Johnson do not discuss howmeta-
phors can be recognized in linguistic data. To date, the most influential account of this
issue is that ofWilks (1975, 1978). According toWilks, metaphors represent a violation of
selectional restrictions (or preferences) in a given context. Selectional restrictions are the
semantic constraints that a predicate places onto its arguments. Consider the following
example.

(17) a. My aunt always drinks her tea on the terrace.

b. My car drinks gasoline. (Wilks 1978)

The verb drink normally requires a grammatical subject of type ANIMATE and a gram-
matical object of type LIQUID, as in Example (17a). Therefore, drink taking a car as a
subject in (17b) is an anomaly, which, according to Wilks, indicates a metaphorical use
of drink.

Although Wilks’s idea inspired a number of computational experiments on meta-
phor recognition (Fass and Wilks 1983; Fass 1991; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007), it
is important to note that in practice this approach has a number of limitations. Firstly,
there are other kinds of non-literalness or anomaly in language that cause a violation of
semantic norm, such as metonymies. Thus the method would overgenerate. Secondly,
there are kinds of metaphor that do not represent a violation of selectional restrictions
(i.e., the approach may also undergenerate). This would happen, for example, when
highly conventionalized metaphorical word senses are more frequent than the original
literal senses. Due to their frequency, selectional preference distributions of such words
in real-world data would be skewed towards the metaphorical senses (e.g., capturemay
select for ideas rather than captives according to the data). As a result, no selectional
preferences violation can be detected in the use of such verbs. Another case where the

310



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

method does not apply is copula constructions, such as “All the world’s a stage.” And
finally, the method does not take into account the fact that interpretation (of metaphor
as well as other linguistic phenomena) is always context-dependent. For example,
the phrase “All men are animals” uttered by a biology professor or a feminist would
have entirely different interpretations, the latter clearly metaphorical, but without any
violation of selectional restrictions.

2.3 Computational Approaches to Metaphor
2.3.1 Automatic Metaphor Recognition. One of the first attempts to automatically identify
and interpret metaphorical expressions in text is the approach of Fass (1991). It origi-
nates in the idea of Wilks (1978) and utilizes hand-coded knowledge. Fass developed a
system called met*, which is capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy,
metaphor, and anomaly. It does this in three stages. First, literalness is distinguished
from non-literalness using selectional preference violation as an indicator. In the case
that non-literalness is detected, the respective phrase is tested for being metonymic
using hand-coded patterns (such as CONTAINER-FOR-CONTENT). If the system fails
to recognize metonymy, it proceeds to search the knowledge base for a relevant analogy
in order to discriminate metaphorical relations from anomalous ones. For example, the
sentence in Example (17b) would be represented in this framework as (car,drink,gasoline),
which does not satisfy the preference (animal,drink,liquid), as car is not a hyponym of
animal. met* then searches its knowledge base for a triple containing a hypernym of
both the actual argument and the desired argument and finds (thing,use,energy source),
which represents the metaphorical interpretation.

Goatly (1997) identifies a set of linguistic cues, namely, lexical patterns indicating
the presence of a metaphorical expression in running text, such as metaphorically speak-
ing, utterly, completely, so to speak, and literally. This approach, however, is likely to find
only a small proportion ofmetaphorical expressions, as the vast majority of them appear
without any signaling context. We conducted a corpus study in order to investigate the
effectiveness of linguistic cues asmetaphor indicators. For each cue suggested by Goatly
(1997), we randomly sampled 50 sentences from the BNC containing it and manually
annotated them for metaphoricity. The results are presented in Table 1. The average
precision (i.e., the proportion of identified expressions that were metaphorical) of the
linguistic cue method according to these data is 0.40, which suggests that the set of
metaphors that this method generates contains a great deal of noise. Thus the cues are
unlikely to be sufficient for metaphor extraction on their own, but together with some
additional filters, they could contribute to a more complex system.

The work of Peters and Peters (2000) concentrates on detecting figurative language
in lexical resources. They mine WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) for examples of systematic

polysemy, which allows them to capture metonymic and metaphorical relations. Their
system searches for nodes that are relatively high in the WordNet hierarchy (i.e., are
relatively general) and that share a set of commonword forms among their descendants.
Peters and Peters found that such nodes often happen to be in a metonymic (e.g.,
publisher – publication) or a metaphorical (e.g., theory – supporting structure) relation.

The CorMet system (Mason 2004) is the first attempt at discovering source–
target domain mappings automatically. It does this by finding systematic variations in
domain-specific selectional preferences, which are inferred from texts on the Web. For
example, Mason collects texts from the LAB domain and the FINANCE domain, in both
of which pourwould be a characteristic verb. In the LAB domain pour has a strong selec-
tional preference for objects of type liquid, whereas in the FINANCE domain it selects for
money. From this Mason’s system infers the domain mapping FINANCE – LAB and the
concept mappingMONEY IS LIQUID. He compares the output of his system against the
Master Metaphor List (MML; Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991) and reports a per-
formance of 77% in terms of accuracy (i.e., proportion of correctly induced mappings).

Birke and Sarkar (2006) present a sentence clustering approach for non-literal lan-
guage recognition, implemented in the TroFi system (Trope Finder). The idea behind
their system originates from a similarity-based word sense disambiguation method
developed by Karov and Edelman (1998). The latter uses a set of seed sentences anno-
tated with respect to word sense. The system computes similarity between the sentence
containing the word to be disambiguated and all of the seed sentences and selects the
sense corresponding to the annotation in the most similar seed sentences. Birke and
Sarkar adapt this algorithm to perform a two-way classification (literal vs. non-literal),
not aiming to distinguish between specific kinds of tropes. An example for the verb
pour in their database is shown in Figure 2. They attain a performance of 0.54 in terms
of F-measure (van Rijsbergen 1979).

Themethod of Gedigian et al. (2006) discriminates between literal andmetaphorical
use. The authors trained a maximum entropy classifier for this purpose. They col-
lected their data using FrameNet (Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003) and PropBank
(Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) annotations. FrameNet is a lexical resource for English
containing information on words’ semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities, or
valencies, in each of their senses. PropBank is a corpus annotated with verbal propo-
sitions and their arguments. Gedigian et al. (2006) extracted the lexical items whose
frames are related to MOTION and CURE from FrameNet, then searched the PropBank
Wall Street Journal corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) for sentences containing such
lexical items and annotated them with respect to metaphoricity. For example, the verb
run in the sentence “Texas Air has run into difficulty” was annotated as metaphorical,
and in “I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see”
as literal. Gedigian et al. used PropBank annotation (arguments and their semantic

types) as features to train the classifier, and report an accuracy of 95.12%. This result is,
however, only 2.22 percentage points higher than the performance of the naive baseline
assigning majority class to all instances (92.90%). Such high performance of their system
can be explained by the fact that 92.90% of the verbs ofMOTION and CURE in their data
are used metaphorically, thus making the data set unbalanced with respect to target
categories and making the task easier.

Both Birke and Sarkar (2006) and Gedigian et al. (2006) focus only on metaphors
expressed by a verb. The approach of Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) additionally
covers metaphors expressed by nouns and adjectives. Krishnakumaran and Zhu use
hyponymy relation in WordNet and word bigram counts to predict metaphors at a
sentence level. Given a metaphor in copula constructions, or an IS-A metaphor (e.g., the
famous quote by William Shakespeare “All the world’s a stage”) they verify if the two
nouns involved are in hyponymy relation inWordNet, otherwise this sentence is tagged
as containing a metaphor. They also treat expressions containing a verb or an adjective
used metaphorically (e.g., “He planted good ideas in their minds” or “He has a fertile
imagination”). For those cases, they calculate bigram probabilities of verb–noun and
adjective–noun pairs (including the hyponyms/hypernyms of the noun in question). If
the combination is not observed in the data with sufficient frequency, the system tags
the sentence as metaphorical. This idea is a modification of the selectional preference
view of Wilks, although applied at the bigram level. Alternatively, one could extract
verb–object relations from parsed text. Compared to the latter, Krishnakumaran and
Zhu (2007) lose a great deal of information. The authors evaluated their system on a
set of example sentences compiled from the Master Metaphor List, whereby highly con-
ventionalized metaphors are taken to be negative examples. Thus they do not deal with
literal examples as such. Essentially, the distinction Krishnakumaran and Zhu are mak-
ing is between the senses included inWordNet, even if they are conventional metaphors
(e.g., “capture an idea”), and those not included in WordNet (e.g., “planted good ideas”).

2.3.2 Automatic Metaphor Interpretation. One of the first computational accounts of meta-
phor interpretation is that of Martin (1990). In his metaphor interpretation, denotation
and acquisition system (MIDAS), Martin models the hierarchical organization of con-
ventional metaphors. The main assumption underlying this approach is that more spe-
cific conventional metaphors (e.g., COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS viewed as a LIVING
BEING in “How can I kill a process?”) descend from more general ones (e.g., PROCESS
[general, as a sequence of events] is a LIVINGBEING). Given an example of ametaphor-
ical expression, MIDAS searches its database for a corresponding conceptual metaphor
that would explain the anomaly. If it does not find any, it abstracts from the example to
more general concepts and repeats the search. If a suitable general metaphor is found,
it creates a new mapping for its descendant, a more specific metaphor, based on this
example. This is also how novel conceptual metaphors are acquired by the system.
The metaphors are then organized into a resource called MetaBank (Martin 1994). The
knowledge is represented in MetaBank in the form of metaphor maps (Martin 1988)
containing detailed information about source-target concept mappings and empirically
derived examples. MIDAS has been integrated with Unix Consultant, a system that
answers users’ questions about Unix. The system first tries to find a literal answer to the
question. If it is not able to, it calls MIDAS, which detects metaphorical expressions via
selectional preference violation and searches its database for a metaphor explaining the
anomaly in the question.

Another cohort of approaches aims to perform inference about entities and events
in the source and target domains for the purpose of metaphor interpretation. These

313



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

include the KARMA system (Narayanan 1997, 1999; Feldman and Narayanan 2004)
and the ATT-Meta project (Barnden and Lee 2002; Agerri et al. 2007). Within both
systems the authors developed a metaphor-based reasoning framework in accordance
with CMT. The reasoning process relies on manually coded knowledge about the world
and operates mainly in the source domain. The results are then projected onto the target
domain using the conceptual mapping representation. The ATT-Meta project concerns
metaphorical and metonymic description of mental states; and reasoning about mental
states is performed using first order logic. Their system, however, does not take natural
language sentences as input, but hand-coded logical expressions that are representa-
tions of small discourse fragments. KARMA in turn deals with a broad range of abstract
actions and events and takes parsed text as input.

Veale and Hao (2008) derive a “fluid knowledge representation for metaphor inter-
pretation and generation” called Talking Points. Talking Points is a set of characteristics
of concepts belonging to source and target domains and related facts about the world
which are acquired automatically from WordNet and from the Web. Talking Points are
then organized in Slipnet, a framework that allows for a number of insertions, deletions,
and substitutions in definitions of such characteristics in order to establish a connection
between the target and the source concepts. This work builds on the idea of slippage in
knowledge representation for understanding analogies in abstract domains (Hofstadter
and Mitchell 1994; Hofstadter 1995). The following is an example demonstrating how
slippage operates to explain the metaphorMake-up is a Western burqa.

Make-up =>
≡ typically worn by women
≈ expected to be worn by women
≈must be worn by women
≈must be worn by Muslim women

Burqa <=

By doing insertions and substitutions, the system arrives from the definition “typi-
cally worn by women” to that of “must be worn byMuslimwomen.” Thus it establishes
a link between the concepts of make-up and burqa. Veale and Hao, however, did not
evaluate to what extent their system is able to interpret metaphorical expressions in
real-world text.

The next sections of the paper are devoted to our own experiments on metaphor
identification and interpretation.

3. Metaphor Identification Method and Experiments

The first task for metaphor processing within NLP is its identification in text. As dis-
cussed earlier, previous approaches to this problem either utilize hand-coded knowl-
edge (Fass 1991; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007) or reduce the task to searching for
metaphors of a specific domain defined a priori (e.g., MOTIONmetaphors) in a specific
type of discourse (e.g., the Wall Street Journal [Gedigian et al. 2006]). In contrast, the
search space in our experiments is the entire BNC and the domain of the expressions
identified is unrestricted. In addition, the developed technique does not rely on any
hand-crafted lexical or world knowledge, but rather captures metaphoricity by means
of verb and noun clustering in a data-driven manner.

Themotivation behind the use of clusteringmethods for themetaphor identification
task lies in CMT. The patterns of conceptual metaphor (e.g., FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS)

314



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

always operate on semantic classes, that is, groups of related concepts, defined by
Lakoff and Johnson as conceptual domains (FEELINGS include love, anger, hatred, etc.;
LIQUIDS include water, tea, petrol, beer, etc.). Thus modeling metaphorical mechanisms
in accordance with CMT would involve capturing such semantic classes automatically.
Previous research on corpus-based lexical semantics has shown that it is possible to
automatically induce semantic word classes from corpus data via clustering of contex-
tual cues (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Lin 1998; Schulte im Walde 2006). The current
consensus is that the lexical items showing similar behavior in a large body of text most
likely have related meanings.

The second reason for the use of unsupervised and weakly supervised methods
is suggested by the results of corpus-based studies of conceptual metaphor. The anal-
ysis of conceptual mappings in unrestricted text, conducted by Shutova and Teufel
(2010), although confirming some aspects of CMT, uncovered a number of fundamental
difficulties. One of these is the choice of the level of abstraction and granularity of
categories (i.e., labels for source and target domains). This suggests that it is hard
to define a comprehensive inventory of labels for source and target domains. Thus a
computational model of metaphorical associations should not rely on explicit domain
labels. Unsupervised methods allow us to recover patterns in data without assigning
any explicit labels to concepts, and thus to model interconceptual mappings implicitly.

The method behind our metaphor identification system relies on distributional
clustering. Noun clustering, specifically, is central to the approach. It is traditionally
assumed that noun clusters produced using distributional clustering contain concepts
that are similar to each other. This is true only in part, however. There exist two types
of concepts: concrete, those concepts denoting physical entities or physical experiences
(e.g., chair, apple, house, rain) and abstract, those concepts that do not physically exist
at any particular time or place, but rather exist as a type of thing or as an idea (e.g.,
justice, love, democracy). It is the abstract concepts that tend to be described metaphori-
cally, rather than concrete concepts. Humans use metaphor attempting to gain a better
understanding of an abstract concept by comparing it to their physical experiences. As
a result, abstract concepts expose different distributional behavior in a corpus. This
in turn affects the application of clustering techniques and the obtained clusters for
concrete and abstract concepts would be structured differently. Consider the example in
Figure 3. The figure shows a cluster containing concrete concepts (on the right) that are
various kinds of mechanisms; a cluster containing verbs co-occurring with mechanisms
in the corpus (at the bottom); and a cluster containing abstract concepts (on the left)
that tend to co-occur with these verbs. Such abstract concepts, albeit having quite
distinct meanings (e.g., marriage and democracy), are observed in similar lexico-syntactic
environments. This is due to the fact that they are systematically used metaphorically
with the verbs from the domain of MECHANISM. Hence, they are automatically
assigned to the same cluster. The following examples illustrate this phenomenon in
textual data.

(18) Our relationship is not really working.

(19) Diana and Charles did not succeed in mending their marriage.

(20) The wheels of Stalin’s regime were well oiled and already turning.

Such a structure of the abstract clusters can be explained by the fact that relationships,
marriages, collaborations, and political systems are all cognitively mapped to the same

source domain of MECHANISM. In contrast to concrete concepts, such as tea, water,
coffee, beer, drink, liquid, that are clustered together when they have similar meanings,
abstract concepts tend to be clustered together if they are associated with the same
source domain.We define this phenomenon as clustering by association and it becomes
central to the system design. The expectation is that clustering by association would
allow the harvesting of new target domains that are associated with the same source
domain, and thus identify new metaphors.

The metaphor identification system starts from a small set of seed metaphorical
expressions, that is, annotatedmetaphors (such as those in Examples (18) or (19)), which
serve as training data. Note that seed annotation only concerns linguistic metaphors;
metaphorical mappings are not annotated. The system then (1) creates source domains
describing these examples by means of verb clustering (such as the verb cluster in
Figure 3); (2) identifies new target domains associated with the same source domain by
means of noun clustering (see, e.g., ABSTRACT cluster in Figure 3), and (3) establishes a
link between the source and the target clusters based on the seed examples.

Thus the system captures metaphorical associations implicitly. It generalizes over
the associated domains by means of verb and noun clustering. The obtained clusters
then represent source and target concepts between which metaphorical associations
hold. The knowledge of such associations is then used to identify new metaphorical
expressions in a large corpus.

In addition to this, we build a selectional preference–based metaphor filter. This
idea stems from the view of Wilks (1978), but is, however, a modification of it. The
filter assumes that the verbs exhibiting weak selectional preferences, namely, verbs co-
occurring with any argument class in linguistic data (remember, influence, etc.) generally
have no or only weak potential for being a metaphor. It has been previously shown
that it is possible to quantify verb selectional preferences on the basis of corpus data,
using, for example, a measure defined by Resnik (1993). Once the candidate metaphors
are identified in the corpus using clustering methods, those displaying weak selectional
preferences can be filtered out.

Figures 4 and 5 depict the metaphor identification pipeline: first, the identifica-
tion of metaphorical associations and then that of metaphorical expressions in text. In

summary, the system (1) starts from a seed set of metaphorical expressions exemplifying
a range of source–target domain mappings; (2) performs noun clustering in order to
harvest various target concepts associated with the same source domain; (3) creates a
source domain verb lexicon by means of verb clustering; (4) searches the corpus for
metaphorical expressions describing the target domain concepts using the verbs from
the source domain lexicon; and (5) filters out the candidates exposing weak selectional
preference strength as non-metaphorical.

3.1 Experimental Data

The identification system takes a list of seed phrases as input. Seed phrases contain
manually annotated linguistic metaphors. The system generalizes from these linguistic
metaphors to the respective conceptual metaphors by means of clustering. This gen-
eralization is then used to harvest a large number of new metaphorical expressions in
unseen text. Thus the data needed for the identification experiment consist of a seed set,
data sets of verbs and nouns that are subsequently clustered, and an evaluation corpus.

3.1.1 Metaphor Corpus and Seed Phrases. The data to test the identification module were
extracted from the metaphor corpus created by Shutova and Teufel (2010). Their corpus
is a subset of the BNC (Burnard 2007) and, as such, it provides a suitable platform
for testing the metaphor processing system on real-world general-domain expressions
in contemporary English. Our data set consists of verb–subject and verb–direct object
metaphorical expressions. In order to avoid extra noise, we enforced some additional
selection criteria. All phrases were included unless they fell in one of the following
categories:

� Phrases where the subject or object referent is unknown (e.g., containing
pronouns such as in “in which they [changes] operated”) or represented
by a named entity (e.g., “Then Hillary leapt into the conversation”).
These cases were excluded from the data set because their processing
would involve the use of additional modules for coreference resolution
and named entity recognition, which in turn may introduce additional
errors into the system.

� Phrases whose metaphorical meaning is realized solely in passive
constructions (e.g., “sociologists have been inclined to [..]”). These cases
were excluded because for many such examples it was hard for humans
to produce a literal paraphrase realized in the form of the same syntactic
construction. Thus their paraphrasing was deemed to be an unfairly
hard task for the system.

� Multiword metaphors (e.g., “whether we go on pilgrimage with Raleigh or
put out to seawith Tennyson”). The current system is designed to identify
and paraphrase single-word, lexical metaphors. In the future the system
needs to be modified to process multiword metaphorical expressions;
this is, however, outside the scope of the current experiments.

The resulting data set consists of 62 phrases that are different single-word metaphors
representing verb–subject and verb–direct object relations, where a verb is used meta-
phorically. The phrases include, for instance, “stir excitement,” “reflect enthusiasm,”
“grasp theory,” “cast doubt,” “suppressmemory,” “throw remark” (verb–direct object con-
structions); and “campaign surged,” “factor shaped [...],” “tension mounted,” “ideology
embraces,” “example illustrates” (subject–verb constructions). This data set was used as
a seed set in the identification experiments. The phrases in the data set were manually
annotated for grammatical relations.

3.1.2 Verb and Noun Data Sets. The noun data set used for clustering consists of the
2,000 most frequent nouns in the BNC. The 2,000 most frequent nouns cover most
common target categories and their linguistic realizations. BNC represents a suitable

318



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

source for such nouns because the corpus is balanced with respect to genre, style,
and theme.

The verb data set is a subset of VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006). VerbNet is the largest
resource for general-domain verbs organized into semantic classes as proposed by Levin
(1993). The data set includes all the verbs in VerbNet with the exception of highly
infrequent ones. The frequency of the verbs was estimated from the data collected by
Korhonen, Krymolowski, and Briscoe (2006) for the construction of the VALEX lexicon,
which to date is one of the largest automatically created verb resources. The verbs from
VerbNet that appear less than 150 times in this data were excluded. The resulting data
set consists of 1,610 general-domain verbs.

3.1.3 Evaluation Corpus. The evaluation data for metaphor identification was the BNC
parsed by the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006). We used the gram-
matical relation (GR) output of RASP for the BNC created by Andersen et al. (2008).
The system searched the corpus for the source and target domain vocabulary within a
particular grammatical relation (verb–direct object or verb–subject).

3.2 Method

The main components of the method include (1) distributional clustering of verbs
and nouns, (2) search through the parsed corpus, and (3) selectional preference-based
filtering.

3.2.1 Verb and Noun Clustering Method. The metaphor identification system relies on
the clustering method of Sun and Korhonen (2009). They use a rich set of syntactic
and semantic features (GRs, verb subcategorization frames [SCFs], and selectional
preferences) and spectral clustering, a method particularly suitable for the resulting
high dimensional feature space. This algorithm has proved to be effective in previous
verb clustering experiments (Brew and Schulte im Walde 2002) and in other NLP tasks
involving high dimensional data (Chen et al. 2006).

Spectral clustering partitions objects relying on their similarity matrix. Given a set
of data points, the similarity matrix records similarities between all pairs of points. The
system of Sun and Korhonen (2009) constructs similarity matrices using the Jensen-
Shannon divergence as a measure. Jensen-Shannon divergence between two feature
vectors wi and wj is defined as follows:

JSD(wi,wj) =
1
2
D(wi||m)+ 12D(wj||m) (1)

where D is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and m is the average of the wi and wj.
Spectral clustering can be viewed in abstract terms as the partitioning of a graph

G over a set of words W. The weights on the edges of G are the similarities Sij. The
similarity matrix S thus represents the adjacency matrix for G. The clustering problem
is then defined as identifying the optimal partition, or cut, of the graph into clusters,
such that the intra-cluster weights are high and the inter-cluster weights are low. The
system of Sun and Korhonen (2009) uses the MNCut algorithm of Meila and Shi (2001)
for this purpose.

Sun and Korhonen (2009) evaluated their clustering approach on 204 verbs from
17 Levin classes and obtained an F-measure of 80.4, which is the state-of-the-art

319



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

performance level. The metaphor identification system uses the method of Sun and
Korhonen to cluster both verbs and nouns (separately), however, significantly extending
its coverage to unrestricted general-domain data and applying the method to a con-
siderably larger data set of 1,610 verbs.

3.2.2 Feature Extraction and Clustering Experiments. For verb clustering, the best perform-
ing features from Sun and Korhonen (2009) were adopted. These include automatically
acquired verb SCFs parameterized by their selectional preferences. These features were
obtained using the SCF acquisition system of Preiss, Briscoe, and Korhonen (2007). The
system tags and parses corpus data using the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, andWatson
2006) and extracts SCFs from the produced grammatical relations using a rule-based
classifier which identifies 168 SCF types for English verbs. It produces a lexical entry
for each verb and SCF combination occurring in corpus data. The selectional preference
classes were obtained by clustering nominal arguments appearing in the subject and
object slots of verbs in the resulting lexicon.

Following previous works on semantic noun classification (Pantel and Lin 2002;
Bergsma, Lin, and Goebel 2008), grammatical relations were used as features for noun
clustering. More specifically, the frequencies of nouns and verb lemmas appearing in
the subject, direct object, and indirect object relations in the RASP-parsed BNC were
included in the feature vectors. For example, the feature vector for bananawould contain
the following entries: {eat-dobj n1, fry-dobj n2, sell-dobj n3,..., eat with-iobj ni,
look at-iobj ni+1,..., rot-subj nk, grow-subj nk+1,...}.

We experimented with different clustering granularities, subjectively examined the
obtained clusters, and determined that the number of clusters set to 200 is the most
suitable setting for both nouns and verbs in our task. This was done by means of qual-
itative analysis of the clusters as representations of source and target domains—that is,
by judging how complete and homogeneous the verb clusters were as lists of potential
source domain vocabulary and howmany new target domains associated with the same
source domain were found correctly in the noun clusters. This analysis was performed
on a randomly selected set of 10 clusters taken from different granularity settings and
none of the seed expressions were used for it. Examples of such clusters are shown in
Figures 6 (nouns) and 7 (verbs), respectively. The noun clusters represent target concepts
associated with the same source concept (some suggested source concepts are given in
Figure 6, although the system only captures those implicitly). The verb clusters contain
lists of source domain vocabulary.

3.2.3 Corpus Search.Once the clusters have been obtained, the system proceeds to search
the corpus for source and target domain terms within verb–object (both direct and
indirect) and verb–subject relations. For each seed expression, a cluster is retrieved for
the verb to form the source concept, and a cluster is retrieved for the noun to form a list
of target concepts. The retrieved verb and noun clusters are then linked, and such links
represent metaphorical associations. The system then classifies grammatical relations in
the corpus as metaphorical if the lexical items in the grammatical relation appear in the
linked source (verb) and target (noun) clusters. This search is performed on the BNC
parsed by RASP. Consider the following example sentence extracted from the BNC (the
BNC text ID is given in brackets, followed by the hypothetical conceptual metaphor):

The relevant GRs identified by the parser are presented in Figure 8. The relation between
the verb accelerate and its semantic object change in Example (21) is expressed in the
passive voice and is, therefore, tagged by RASP as an ncsubj GR. Because this GR con-
tains terminology from associated source (MOTION) and target (CHANGE) domains,
it is marked as metaphorical and so is the term accelerate, which belongs to the source
domain of MOTION.

3.2.4 Selectional Preference Strength Filter. In the previous step a set of candidate verb
metaphors and the associated grammatical relations were extracted from the BNC.
These now need to be filtered based on selectional preference strength. To do this, we

automatically acquire selectional preference distributions for verb–subject and verb–
direct object relations from the RASP-parsed BNC. The noun clusters obtained using
Sun and Korhonen’s method as described earlier form the selectional preference classes.
To quantify selectional preferences, we adopt the selectional preference strength (SPS)
measure of Resnik (1993). Resnik models selectional preferences of a verb in proba-
bilistic terms as the difference between the posterior distribution of noun classes in a
particular relation with the verb and their prior distribution in that syntactic position
irrespective of the identity of the verb. He quantifies this difference using the Kullback-
Leibler divergence and defines selectional preference strength as follows:

SR(v) = D(P(c|v)||P(c)) =

where P(c) is the prior probability of the noun class, P(c|v) is the posterior probability
of the noun class given the verb, and R is the grammatical relation in question. In order
to quantify how well a particular argument class fits the verb, Resnik defines another
measure called selectional association:

AR(v, c) =
1
SR(v)

P(c|v) log
P(c|v)
P(c)

(3)

which stands for the contribution of a particular argument class to the overall selectional
preference strength of a verb.

The probabilities P(c|v) and P(c) were estimated from the corpus data as follows:

P(c|v) =
f (v, c)∑
k f (v, ck)

(4)

P(c) =
f (c)∑
k f (ck)

(5)

where f (v, c) is the number of times the predicate v co-occurs with the argument class c
in the relation R, and f (c) is the number of times the argument class occurs in the relation
R regardless of the identity of the predicate.

Thus for each verb, its SPS can be calculated for specific grammatical relations.
This measure was used to filter out the verbs with weak selectional preferences. The
expectation is that such verbs are unlikely to be used metaphorically. The optimal
selectional preference strength threshold was set experimentally for both verb–subject
and verb–object relations on a small held-out data set (via qualitative analysis of the
data). It approximates to 1.32. The system excludes expressions containing the verbs
with preference strength below this threshold from the set of candidate metaphors.
Examples of verbs with weak and strong direct object SPs are shown in Tables 2 and
3, respectively. Given the SPS threshold of 1.32, the filter discards 31% of candidate
expressions initially identified in the corpus.

over the seed set and that it operates beyond synonymy, its output was compared to

that of a baseline using WordNet. In the baseline system, WordNet synsets represent
source and target domains. The quality of metaphor identification for both the system
and the baseline was evaluated in terms of precision with the aid of human judges.
To compare the coverage of the system to that of the baseline in quantitative terms we
assessed how broadly they expand on the seed set. To do this, we estimated the number
of word senses captured by the two systems and the proportion of identified metaphors
that are not synonymous with any of those seen in the seed set, according to WordNet.
This type of evaluation assesses how well clustering methods are suited to identify new
metaphors not directly related to those in the seed set.

3.3.1 Comparison with WordNet Baseline. The baseline system was implemented using
synonymy information from WordNet to expand on the seed set. Source and target
domain vocabularies were thus represented as sets of synonyms of verbs and nouns in
seed expressions. The baseline system then searched the corpus for phrases composed
of lexical items belonging to those vocabularies. For example, given a seed expression
“stir excitement,” the baseline finds phrases such as “arouse fervour, stimulate agitation,
stir turmoil,” and so forth. It is not able to generalize over the concepts to broad
semantic classes, however—for example, it does not find other FEELINGS such as
rage, fear, anger, pleasure. This, however, is necessary to fully characterize the target
domain. Similarly, in the source domain, the system only has access to direct synonyms
of stir, rather than to other verbs characteristic of the domain of LIQUIDS (pour, flow,
boil, etc.).

To compare the coverage achieved by the system using clustering to that of the
baseline in quantitative terms, we estimated the number of WordNet synsets, that
is, different word senses, in the metaphorical expressions captured by the two sys-
tems. We found that the baseline system covers only 13% of the data identified using
clustering. This is due to the fact that it does not reach beyond the concepts present
in the seed set. In contrast, most metaphors tagged by the clustering method (87%)
are non-synonymous to those in the seed set and some of them are novel. Together,
these metaphors represent a considerably wider range of meanings. Given the seed
metaphors “stir excitement, throw remark, cast doubt,” the system identifies previously
unseen expressions “swallow anger, hurl comment, spark enthusiasm,” and so on, as
metaphorical. Tables 4 and 5 show examples of how the system and the baseline expand
on the seed set, respectively. Full sentences containing metaphors annotated by the
system are shown in Figure 9. Twenty-one percent of the expressions identified by the
system do not have their correspondingmetaphorical senses included inWordNet, such
as “spark enthusiasm”; the remaining 79% are, however, more common conventional
metaphors. Starting with a seed set of only 62 examples, the system expands signif-
icantly on the seed set and identifies a total of 4,456 metaphorical expressions in the
BNC. This suggests that the method has the potential to attain a broad coverage of the
corpus given a large and representative seed set.

3.3.2 Evaluation Against Human Judgments. In order to assess the quality of metaphor
identification by both systems, their output was assessed by human judgments. For
this purpose, we randomly sampled sentences containing metaphorical expressions as
annotated by the system and by the baseline and asked human annotators to decide
whether these were metaphorical or not.

Participants Five volunteers participated in the experiment. They were all native
speakers of English and had no formal training in linguistics.

however, in the form of the following definition of metaphor (Pragglejaz Group 2007)

1. For each verb establish its meaning in context and try to imagine a more
basic meaning of this verb in other contexts. Basic meanings normally are:
(1) more concrete; (2) related to bodily action; (3) more precise (as opposed
to vague); (4) historically older.

2. If you can establish a basic meaning that is distinct from the meaning of
the verb in this context, the verb is likely to be used metaphorically.

Figure 10
Evaluation of metaphor identification.

Interannotator agreement Reliability was measured at κ = 0.63 (n = 2,N = 78, k = 5).
The data suggest that the main source of disagreement between the annotators was the
presence of conventional metaphors (e.g., verbs such as adopt, convey, decline).

Results The system performance was then evaluated against the elicited judgments in
terms of precision. The system output was compared to the gold standard constructed
by merging the judgments, whereby the expressions tagged as metaphorical by at least
three annotators were considered to be correct. This resulted in P = 0.79, with the
baseline attaining P = 0.44. In addition, the system tagging was compared to that of
each annotator pairwise, yielding an average P = 0.74 for the system and P = 0.41 for
the baseline.

In order to compare system performance to the human ceiling, pairwise agreement
was additionally calculated in terms of precision between the majority gold standard
and each judge. This corresponds to an average of P = 0.94.

To show that the system performance is significantly different from that of the base-
line, we annotated additional 150 instances identified by both systems for correctness
and conducted a one-tailed t-test for independent samples. The difference is statistically
significant with t = 4.11 (df = 148, p < 0.0005).

3.4 Discussion

We have shown that the method leads to a considerable expansion on the seed set and
operates with high precision—namely, it produces high quality annotations, and iden-
tifies fully novel metaphorical expressions relying only on the knowledge of source–
target domain mappings that it learns automatically. By comparing its coverage to that
of a WordNet baseline, we showed that the method reaches beyond synonymy and
generalizes well over the source and target domains.

The observed discrepancy in precision between the clustering approach and the
baseline can be explained by the fact that a large number of metaphorical senses are
included in WordNet. This means that in WordNet synsets source domain verbs appear
together with more abstract terms. For instance, the metaphorical sense of shape in
the phrase “shape opinion” is part of the synset “(determine, shape, mold, influence,
regulate).” This results in the low precision of the baseline system, because it tags literal
expressions (e.g., influence opinion) as metaphorical, assuming that all verbs from the
synset belong to the source domain.

Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

To perform a more comprehensive error analysis, we examined a larger subset of
the metaphorical expressions identified by the system (200 sentences, equally covering
verb–subject and verb–object constructions). System precision against the additional
judgments by one of the authors was measured at 76% (48 instances were tagged
incorrectly according to the judgments). The classification of system errors by type is
presented in Table 6. Precision errors in the output of the system were also concentrated
around the problem of conventionality of some metaphorical verbs, such as those in
“hold views, adopt traditions, tackle a problem.” This conventionality is reflected in the
data in that such verbs are frequently used in their “metaphorical” contexts. As a result,
they are clustered together with literally used terms. For instance, the verb tackle is
found in a cluster with solve, resolve, handle, confront, face, and so forth. This results in
the system tagging “resolve a problem” as metaphorical if it has previously seen “tackle
a problem.”

A number of system errors affecting its precision are also due to cases of general
polysemy and homonymy of both verbs and nouns. For example, the noun passage
can mean both “the act of passing from one state or place to the next” and “a section
of text; particularly a section of medium length,” as defined in WordNet. Sun and
Korhonen’s (2009) method performs hard clustering, that is, it does not distinguish
between different word senses. Hence the noun passage occurred in only one cluster,
containing concepts like thought, word, sentence, expression, reference, address, description,
and so on. This cluster models the “textual” meaning of passage. As a result of sense
ambiguity within the cluster, given the seed phrase “she blocked the thought,” the system
tags such expressions as “block passage,” “impede passage,” “obstruct passage,” and
“speed passage” as metaphorical.

The errors that may cause low recall of the system are of a different nature. Whereas
noun clustering considerably expands the seed set by identifying new associated tar-
get concepts (e.g., given the seed metaphor “sell soul” it identifies “sell skin” and
“launch pulse” as metaphorical), the verb clusters sometimes miss a certain proportion
of source domain vocabulary. For instance, given the seed metaphor “example illus-
trates,” the system identifies the following expressions: “history illustrates,” “episode
illustrates,” “tale illustrates,” “combination illustrates,” “event illustrates,” and so forth. It
does not, however, capture obvious verb-based expansions, such as “episode portrays,”
present in the BNC. This is one of the problems that could lead to a lower recall
of the system.

Nevertheless, in many cases the system benefits not only from dissimilar concepts
within the noun clusters used to detect new target domains, but also from dissim-
ilar concepts in the verb clusters. Verb clusters produced automatically relying on

contextual features may contain lexical items with distinct, or even opposite meanings
(e.g., throw and catch, take off and land). They tend to belong to the same semantic
domain, however (e.g., verbs of dealing with LIQUIDS, verbs describing a FIGHT) It is
the diversity of verb meanings within the domain cluster that allows the generalization
from a limited number of seed expressions to a broader spectrum of previously unseen
and novel metaphors, non-synonymous with those in the seed set.

The fact that the approach is seed-dependent is one of its possible limitations,
affecting the coverage of the system. Wide coverage is essential for the practical use
of the system. At this stage, however, it was impossible for us to reliably measure the
recall of the system, because there is no large corpus annotated for metaphor available.
In addition, because the current system was only tested with very few seeds (again,
due to the lack of metaphor-annotated data), we expect the current overall recall of the
system to be relatively low. In order to obtain a full coverage of the corpus, a large and
representative seed set is necessary. Although it is hard to capture the whole variety of
metaphorical language in a limited set of examples, it is possible to compile a seed set
representative of all common source–target domain mappings. The learning capabilities
of the system can then be used to expand on those to the whole range of conventional
and novel metaphorical mappings and expressions. In addition, because the precision
of the system was measured on the data set produced by expanding individual seed
expressions, we would expect the expansion of other, new seed expressions to yield a
comparable quality of annotations. Incorporating new seed expressions is thus likely to
result in increasing recall without a significant loss in precision.

The current system harvests a large and relatively clean set of metaphorical
expressions from the corpus. These annotations could provide a new platform for the
development and testing of other metaphor systems.

4. Metaphor Interpretation Method and Experiments

As is the case in metaphor identification, the majority of existing approaches to meta-
phor interpretation also rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge (Martin 1990; Fass
1991; Narayanan 1997, 1999; Barnden and Lee 2002; Feldman and Narayanan 2004;
Agerri et al. 2007) and produce interpretations in a non-textual format (Veale and Hao
2008). The ultimate objective of automatic metaphor processing, however, is a type
of interpretation that can be directly embedded into other systems to enhance their
performance. We thus define metaphor interpretation as a paraphrasing task and build
a system that automatically derives literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions in
unrestricted text. Our method is also distinguished from previous work in that it does
not rely on any hand-crafted knowledge aboutmetaphor, but in contrast is corpus-based
and uses automatically induced selectional preferences.

The metaphor paraphrasing task can be divided into two subtasks: (1) generating
paraphrases, that is, other ways of expressing the same meaning in a given context,
and (2) discriminating between literal and metaphorical paraphrases. Consequently,
the proposed approach is theoretically grounded in two ideas underlying each of these
subtasks:

� The meaning of a word in context emerges through interaction with the
meaning of the words surrounding it. This assumption is widely accepted
in lexical semantics theory (Pustejovsky 1995; Hanks and Pustejovsky
2005) and has been exploited for lexical acquisition (Schulte im Walde
2006; Sun and Korhonen 2009). It suggests that the context itself imposes

329



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

certain semantic restrictions on the words which can occur within it.
Given a large amount of linguistic data, it is possible to model these
semantic restrictions in probabilistic terms (Lapata 2001). This can be
done by deriving a ranking scheme for possible paraphrases that fit or
do not fit in a specific context based on word co-occurrence evidence.
This is how initial paraphrases are generated within the metaphor
paraphrasing module.

� Literalness can be detected via strong selectional preference. This idea
is a mirror-image of the selectional preference violation view of Wilks
(1978), who suggested that a violation of selectional preferences indicates
a metaphor. The key information that selectional preferences provide is
whether there is an association between the predicate and its potential
argument and how strong that association is. A literal paraphrase
would normally come from the target domain (e.g., “understand the
explanation”) and be strongly associated with the target concept, whereas
a metaphorical paraphrase would belong to the source domain (e.g.,
“grasp the explanation”) and be associated with the concepts from this
source domain more strongly than with the target concept. Hence we
use a selectional preference model to measure the semantic fit of the
generated paraphrases into the given context as opposed to all other
contexts. The highest semantic fit then indicates the most literal
paraphrase.

Thus the context-based probabilistic model is used for paraphrase generation and
the selectional preference model for literalness detection. The key difference between
the two models is that the former favors the paraphrases that co-occur with the words
in the context more frequently than other paraphrases do, and the latter favors the
paraphrases that co-occur with the words from the context more frequently than with
any other lexical items in the corpus. This is the main intuition behind our approach.

The system thus incorporates the following components:

� a context-based probabilistic model that acquires paraphrases for
metaphorical expressions from a large corpus;

� a WordNet similarity component that filters out the irrelevant
paraphrases based on their similarity to the metaphorical term (similarity
is defined as sharing a common hypernym within three levels in the
WordNet hierarchy);

� a selectional preference model that discriminates literal paraphrases from
the metaphorical ones. It re-ranks the paraphrases, de-emphasizing the
metaphorical ones and emphasizing the literal ones.

In addition, the system disambiguates the sense of the paraphrases using the
WordNet inventory of senses. The context-based model together with the WordNet
filter constitute a metaphor paraphrasing baseline. By comparing the final system to
this baseline, we demonstrate that simple context-based substitution, even supplied by
extensive knowledge contained in lexical resources, is not sufficient for metaphor inter-
pretation and that a selectional preference model is needed to establish the literalness of
the paraphrases.

This section first provides an overview of paraphrasing and lexical substitution
and relates these tasks to the problem of metaphor interpretation. It then describes
the experimental data used to develop and test the paraphrasing system and the
method itself, and finally, concludes with the system evaluation and the presentation
of results.

4.1 Paraphrasing and Lexical Substitution

Paraphrasing can be viewed as a text-to-text generation problem, whereby a new piece
of text is produced conveying the same meaning as the original text. Paraphrasing can
be carried out at multiple levels (sentence-, phrase-, and word-levels), and may involve
both syntactic and lexical transformations. Paraphrasing by replacing individual words
in a sentence is known as lexical substitution (McCarthy 2002). Because, in this article,
we address the phenomenon of metaphor at a single-word level, our task is close in
nature to lexical substitution. The task of lexical substitution originates from word
sense disambiguation (WSD). The key difference between the two is that whereas WSD
makes use of a predefined sense-inventory to characterize the meaning of a word in
context, lexical substitution is aimed at automatic induction of meanings. Thus the goal
of lexical substitution is to generate the set of semantically valid substitutes for the
word. Consider the following sentences from Preiss, Coonce, and Baker (2009).

(22) His parents felt that he was a bright boy.

(23) Our sun is a bright star.

Bright in Example (22) can be replaced by the word intelligent. The same replacement
in the context of Example (23) will not produce an appropriate sentence. A lexical
substitution system needs to (1) find a set of candidate synonyms for the word and
(2) select the candidate that matches the context of the word best.

Both sentence- or phrase-level paraphrasing and lexical substitution find a wide
range of applications in NLP. These include summarization (Knight and Marcu 2000;
Zhou et al. 2006), information extraction (Shinyama and Sekine 2003), machine trans-
lation (Kurohashi 2001; Callison-Burch, Koehn, and Osborne 2006), text simplification
(Carroll et al. 1999), question answering (McKeown 1979; Lin and Pantel 2001) and
textual entailment (Sekine et al. 2007). Consequently, there has been a plethora of
NLP approaches to paraphrasing (McKeown 1979; Meteer and Shaked 1988; Dras 1999;
Barzilay and McKeown 2001; Lin and Pantel 2001; Barzilay and Lee 2003; Bolshakov
and Gelbukh 2004; Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan 2004; Kauchak and Barzilay 2006; Zhao
et al. 2009; Kok and Brockett 2010) and lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli 2007,
2009; Erk and Padó 2009; Preiss, Coonce, and Baker 2009; Toral 2009; McCarthy, Keller,
and Navigli 2010).

Among paraphrasing methods one can distinguish (1) rule-based approaches,
which rely on a set of hand-crafted (McKeown 1979; Zong, Zhang, and Yamamoto 2001)
or automatically learned (Lin and Pantel 2001; Barzilay and Lee 2003; Zhao et al. 2008)
paraphrasing patterns; (2) thesaurus-based approaches, which generate paraphrases
by substituting words in the sentence by their synonyms (Bolshakov and Gelbukh
2004; Kauchak and Barzilay 2006); (3) natural language generation–based approaches
(Kozlowski, McCoy, and Vijay-Shanker 2003; Power and Scott 2005), which transform
a sentence into its semantic representation and generate a new sentence from it; and
(4) SMT-based methods (Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan 2004), operating as monolingual

331



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

MT. A number of approaches to lexical substitution rely on manually constructed
thesauri to find sets of candidate synonyms (McCarthy and Navigli 2007), whereas
others address the task in a fully unsupervised fashion. In order to derive and rank
candidate substitutes, the latter systems make use of distributional similarity measures
(Pucci et al. 2009; McCarthy, Keller, and Navigli 2010), vector space models of word
meaning (De Cao and Basili 2009; Erk and Padó 2009) or statistical learning techniques,
such as hidden Markov models and n-grams (Preiss, Coonce, and Baker 2009).

The metaphor interpretation task is different from the WSD task, because it is
impossible to predefine a set of senses of metaphorical words, in particular for novel
metaphors. Instead, the correct substitute for the metaphorical term needs to be gen-
erated in a data-driven manner, as for lexical substitution. The metaphor paraphrasing
task, however, also differs from lexical substitution in the following two ways. Firstly,
a suitable substitute needs to be used literally in the target context, or at least more
conventionally than the original word. Secondly, by definition, the substitution is not
required to be a synonym of the metaphorical word. Moreover, for our task this is not
even desired, because there is the danger that synonymous paraphrasing may result
in another metaphorical expression, rather than the literal interpretation of the original
one. Metaphor paraphrasing therefore presents an additional challenge in comparison
to lexical substitution, namely, that of discriminating between literal and metaphorical
substitutes. This second, harder, and not previously addressed task is the main focus
of the work presented in this section. The remainder of the section is devoted to the
description of the metaphor paraphrasing experiment.

4.2 Experimental Data

The paraphrasing system is first tested individually on a set of metaphorical expres-
sions extracted from a manually annotated metaphor corpus of Shutova and Teufel
(2010). This is the same data set as the one used for seeding the identification module
(see Section 3.1.1 for description). Because the paraphrasing evaluation described in
this section is conducted independently from the identification experiment, and no
part of the paraphrasing system relies on the output of the identification system and
vice versa, the use of the same data set does not give any unfair advantage to the
systems. In the later experiment (Section 5) when the identification and paraphrasing
system are evaluated jointly, again the same seed set will be used for identification;
paraphrasing, however, will be performed on the output of the identification system
(i.e., the new identified metaphors) and both the identified metaphors and their para-
phrases will be evaluated by human judges not used in the previous and the current
experiments.

4.3 Method

The system takes phrases containing annotated single-word metaphors as input; where
a verb is used metaphorically, its context is used literally. It generates a list of possible
paraphrases of the verb that can occur in the same context and ranks them according
to their likelihood, as derived from the corpus. It then identifies shared features of the
paraphrases and themetaphorical verb using theWordNet hierarchy and removes unre-
lated concepts. It then identifies the literal paraphrases among the remaining candidates
based on the verb’s automatically induced selectional preferences and the properties of
the context.

Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

4.3.1 Context-based Paraphrase Ranking Model. Terms replacing the metaphorical verb v
will be called its interpretations i. We model the likelihood L of a particular paraphrase
as a joint probability of the following events: the interpretation i co-occurring with the
other lexical items from its context w1, ...,wN in syntactic relations r1, ..., rN, respectively.

Li = P(i, (w1, r1), (w2, r2), ..., (wN, rN )) (6)

where w1, ...,wN and r1, ..., rN represent the fixed context of the term used metaphori-
cally in the sentence. In the system output, the context w1, ...,wN will be preserved, and
the verb v will be replaced by the interpretation i.

We assume statistical independence between the relations of the terms in a phrase.
For instance, for a verb that stands in a relation with both a subject and an object, the
verb–subject and verb–direct object relations are considered to be independent events
within the model. The likelihood of an interpretation is then calculated as follows:

P(i, (w1, r1), (w2, r2), ..., (wN, rN )) = P(i) · P((w1, r1)|i) · ... · P((wN, rN )|i) (7)

The probabilities can be calculated using maximum likelihood estimation

P(i) =
f (i)∑
k f (ik)

(8)

P(wn, rn|i) =
f (wn, rn, i)
f (i)

(9)

where f (i) is the frequency of the interpretation irrespective of its arguments,
∑
k f (ik) is

the number of times its part of speech class is attested in the corpus, and f (wn, rn, i) is
the number of times the interpretation co-occurs with context word wn in relation rn. By
performing appropriate substitutions into Equation (7) one obtains

P(i, (w1, r1), (w2, r2), ..., (wN, rN )) =
f (i)∑
k f (ik)

This model is then used to rank the possible replacements of the term used meta-
phorically in the fixed context according to the data. The parameters of the model were
estimated from the RASP-parsed BNC using the grammatical relations output created
by Andersen et al. (2008).

4.3.2 WordNet Filter. The context-based model described in Section 4.3.1 overgenerates
and hence there is a need to further narrow down the results. It is acknowledged in the
linguistics community that metaphor is, to a great extent, based on similarity between
the concepts involved (Gentner et al. 2001). We exploit this fact to refine paraphrasing.
After obtaining the initial list of possible substitutes for the metaphorical term, the
system filters out the terms whose meanings do not share any common properties
with that of the metaphorical term. Consider the computer science metaphor “kill a
process,” which stands for “terminate a process.” The basic sense of kill implies an end

or termination of life. Thus termination is the shared element of the metaphorical verb
and its literal interpretation.

Such an overlap of properties can be identified using the hyponymy relations in the
WordNet taxonomy. Within the initial list of paraphrases, the system selects the terms
that are hypernyms of the metaphorical term, or share a common hypernym with it. To
maximize the accuracy, we restrict the hypernym search to a depth of three levels in the
taxomomy. Table 7 shows the filtered lists of paraphrases for some of the test phrases,
together with their log-likelihood. Selecting the highest ranked paraphrase from this list
as a literal interpretation will serve as a baseline.

4.3.3 Re-ranking Based on Selectional Preferences. The lists which were generated contain
some irrelevant paraphrases (e.g., “contain the truth” for “hold back the truth”) and
some paraphrases where the substitute itself is metaphorically used (e.g., “suppress the

334



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

truth”). As the task is to identify the literal interpretation, however, the system should
remove these.

One way of dealing with both problems simultaneously is to use selectional prefer-
ences of the verbs. Verbs used metaphorically are likely to demonstrate semantic pref-
erence for the source domain, e.g., suppress would select for MOVEMENTS (political)
rather than IDEAS, or TRUTH (the target domain), whereas the ones used literally for
the target domain (e.g., conceal) would select for TRUTH. Selecting the verbs whose
preferences the noun in the metaphorical expression matches best should allow filtering
out non-literalness, as well as unrelated terms.

We automatically acquired selectional preference distributions of the verbs in the
paraphrase lists (for verb–subject and verb–direct object relations) from the RASP-
parsed BNC. As in the identification experiment, we derived selectional preference
classes by clustering the 2,000 most frequent nouns in the BNC into 200 clusters us-
ing Sun and Korhonen’s (2009) algorithm. In order to quantify how well a particular
argument class fits the verb, we adopted the selectional association measure proposed
by Resnik (1993), identical to the one we used within the selectional preference-based
filter for metaphor identification, as described in Section 3.2.4. To remind the reader,
selectional association is defined as follows:

AR(v, c) =
1
SR(v)

P(c|v) log
P(c|v)
P(c)

(11)

where P(c) is the prior probability of the noun class, P(c|v) is the posterior probability
of the noun class given the verb, and SR is the overall selectional preference strength of
the verb in the grammatical relation R.

We use selectional association as a measure of semantic fitness (i.e., literalness) of
the paraphrases. The paraphrases are re-ranked based on their selectional association
with the noun in the context. Those paraphrases that are not well suited or used meta-
phorically are dispreferred within this ranking. The new ranking is shown in Table 8.
The expectation is that the paraphrase in the first rank (i.e., the verb with which the
noun in the context has the highest association) represents a literal interpretation.

4.4 Evaluation and Discussion

As in the case of identification, the paraphrasing system was tested on verb–subject and
verb–direct object metaphorical expressions. These were extracted from the manually
annotated metaphor corpus of Shutova and Teufel (2010), as described in Section 3.1.1.
We compared the output of the final selectional-preference based system to that of the
WordNet filter acting as a baseline. We evaluated the quality of paraphrasing with the
help of human judges in two different experimental settings. The first setting involved
direct judgments of system output by humans. In the second setting, the subjects did
not have access to system output and had to provide their own literal paraphrases for
the metaphorical expressions in the data set. The system was then evaluated against
human judgments in Setting 1 and a paraphrasing gold standard created by merging
annotations in Setting 2.

4.4.1 Setting 1: Direct Judgment of System Output. The subjects were presented with a
set of sentences containing metaphorical expressions and the top-ranked paraphrases
produced by the system and by the baseline, randomized. They were asked to mark as

correct the paraphrases that have the same meaning as the term used metaphorically if

Subjects Seven volunteers participated in the experiment. They were all native
speakers of English (one bilingual) and had little or no linguistics expertise.

Interannotator agreement The reliability was measured at κ = 0.62 (n = 2,
N = 95, k = 7).

System evaluation against judgments We then evaluated the system performance
against the subjects’ judgments in terms of Precision at Rank 1, P(1). Precision at Rank
(1) measures the proportion of correct literal interpretations among the paraphrases
in rank 1. The results are shown in Table 9. The system identifies literal paraphrases
with a P(1) = 0.81 and the baseline with a P(1) = 0.55. We then conducted a one-tailed
Sign test (Siegel and Castellan 1988) that showed that this difference in performance is
statistically significant (N = 15, x = 1, p < 0.001).

4.4.2 Setting 2: Creation of a Paraphrasing Gold Standard. The subjects were presented with
a set of sentences containing metaphorical expressions and asked to write down all suit-
able literal paraphrases for the highlighted metaphorical verbs that they could think of.

Subjects Five volunteer subjects who were different from the ones used in the pre-
vious setting participated in this experiment. They were all native speakers of English
and some of them had a linguistics background (postgraduate-level degree in English).

Gold Standard The elicited paraphrases combined together can be interpreted
as a gold standard. For instance, the gold standard for the phrase “brushed aside the
accusations” consists of the verbs rejected, ignored, disregarded, dismissed, overlooked, and
discarded.

System evaluation by gold standard comparison The system output was com-
pared against the gold standard using mean average precision (MAP) as a measure.
MAP is defined as follows:

MAP = 1
M

M∑

j=1

1
Nj

Nj∑

i=1

Pji (12)

where M is the number of metaphorical expressions, Nj is the number of correct para-
phrases for the metaphorical expression j, Pji is the precision at each correct paraphrase
(the number of correct paraphrases among the top i ranks). First, average precision
is estimated for individual metaphorical expressions, and then the mean is computed
across the data set. This measure allows one to assess ranking quality beyond rank 1,
as well as the recall of the system. As compared with the gold standard, MAP of the
paraphrasing system is 0.62 and that of the baseline is 0.56, as shown in Table 9.

4.4.3 Discussion. Given that the metaphor paraphrasing task is open-ended, any gold
standard elicited on the basis of it cannot be exhaustive. Some of the correct paraphrases
may not occur to subjects during the experiment. As an example, for the phrase “stir
excitement” most subjects suggested only one paraphrase “create excitement,” which is
found in rank 3, suggesting an average precision of 0.33 for this phrase. The top ranks of
the system output are occupied by provoke and stimulate, however, which are intuitively
correct, more precise paraphrases, despite none of the subjects having thought of them.
Such examples contribute to the fact that the system’s MAP is significantly lower than
its precision at rank 1, because a number of correct paraphrases proposed by the system
are not included in the gold standard.

The selectional preference-based re-ranking yields a considerable improvement in
precision at rank 1 (26%) over the baseline. This component is also responsible for some
errors of the system, however. One of the potential limitations of selectional preference-
based approaches to metaphor paraphrasing is the presence of verbs exhibiting weak

337



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

selectional preferences. This means that these verbs are not strongly associated with
any of their argument classes. As noted in Section 3, such verbs tend to be used
literally, and are therefore suitable paraphrases. Our selectional preference model de-
emphasizes them, however, and, as a result, they are not selected as literal paraphrases
despite matching the context. This type of error is exemplified by the phrase “mend
marriage.” For this phrase, the system ranking overruns the correct top suggestion
of the baseline, “improve marriage,” and outputs “repair marriage” as the most likely
literal interpretation, although it is in fact a metaphorical use. This is likely to be due to
the fact that improve exposes a moderate selectional preference strength.

Table 10 provides frequencies of the common errors of the system by type. The
most common type of error is triggered by the conventionality of certain metaphorical
verbs. Because they frequently co-occur with the target noun class in the corpus, they
receive a high association score with that noun class. This results in a high ranking
of conventional metaphorical paraphrases. Examples of top-ranked metaphorical para-
phrases include “confront a question” for “tackle a question,” “repairmarriage” for “mend
marriage,” “example pictures” for “example illustrates.”

These errors concern non-literalness of the produced paraphrases. A less frequently
occurring error was paraphrasing with a verb that has a different meaning. One such
example was the metaphorical expression “tensionmounted,” for which the system pro-
duced a paraphrase “tension lifted,” which has the opposite meaning. This error is likely
to have been triggered by the WordNet filter, whereby one of the senses of lift would
have a common hypernym with the metaphorical verb mount. This results in lift not
being discarded by the filter, and subsequently ranked top due to the conventionality of
the expression “tension lifted.”

Another important issue that the paraphrase analysis brought to the foreground
is the influence of wider context on metaphorical interpretation. The current system
processes only the information contained within the GR of interest, discarding the
rest of the context. For some cases, however, this is not sufficient and the analysis
of a wider context is necessary. For instance, given the phrase “scientists focus” the
system produces a paraphrase “scientists think,” rather than the more likely paraphrase
“scientists study.” Such ambiguity of focus could potentially be resolved by taking its
wider context into account. The context-based paraphrase ranking model described in
Section 4.3.1 allows for the incorporation of multiple relations of the metaphorical verb
in the sentence.

Although the paraphrasing system uses hand-coded lexical knowledge from
WordNet, it is important to note that metaphor paraphrasing is not restricted to
metaphorical senses included in WordNet. Even if a metaphorical sense is absent from
WordNet, the system can still identify its correct literal paraphrase relying on the

hyponymy relation and similarity between concepts, as described in Section 4.3.2. For
example, the metaphorical sense of handcuff in “research is handcuffed” is not included
in Wordnet, although the system correctly identifies its paraphrase confine (“research is
confined”).

5. Evaluation of Integrated System

Up to now, the identification and the paraphrasing systemswere evaluated individually
as modules. To determine to which extent the presented systems are applicable within
NLP, we then ran the two systems together in a pipeline and evaluated the accuracy of
the resulting text-to-text metaphor processing. First, the metaphor identification system
was applied to naturally occurring text taken from the BNC and then the metaphorical
expressions identified in those texts were paraphrased by the paraphrasing system.
Some of the expressions identified and paraphrased by the integrated system are shown
in Figure 11. The system output was compared against human judgments in two
phases. In phase 1, a small sample of sentences containing metaphors identified and
paraphrased by the system was judged by multiple judges. In phase 2, a larger sample
of phrases was judged by only one judge (one of the authors of this article). Agreement
of the judgments of the latter with the other judges was measured on the data from
phase 1.

Because our goal was to evaluate both the accuracy of the integrated system and
its usability by other NLP tasks, we assessed its performance in a two-fold fashion.
Instances where metaphors were both correctly identified and paraphrased by the
system were considered strictly correct, as they show that the system fully achieved

its goals. Instances where the paraphrasing retained the meaning and resulted in a
literal paraphrase (including the cases where the identification module tagged a literal
expression as a metaphor) were considered correct lenient. The intuition behind this
evaluation setting is that correct paraphrasing of literal expressions by other literal
expressions, albeit not demonstrating the positive contribution of metaphor processing,
does not lead to any errors in system output and thus does not hamper the overall
usability of the integrated system.

5.1 Phase 1: Small Sample, Multiple Judges

Three volunteer subjects participated in the experiment. They were all native speakers
of English and had no formal training in linguistics.

Materials and task Subjects were presented with a set of sentences containing
metaphorical expressions identified by the system and their paraphrases, as shown
in Figure 12. There were 35 such sentences in the sample. They were asked to do the
following:

1. Compare the sentences, decide whether the highlighted expressions have
the same meaning, and record this in the box provided;

2. Decide whether the verbs in both sentences are used metaphorically or
literally and tick the respective boxes.

For the second task, the same definition of metaphor as in the identification evaluation
(cf. Section 3.3.2) was provided for guidance.

Interannotator agreement The reliability of annotations was evaluated indepen-
dently for judgments on similarity of paraphrases and their literalness. The inter-
annotator agreement on the task of distinguishing metaphoricity from literalness was
measured at κ = 0.53 (n = 2,N = 70, k = 3). On the paraphrase (i.e., meaning retention)
task, reliability was measured at κ = 0.63 (n = 2,N = 35, k = 3).

System performance We then evaluated the integrated system performance
against the subjects’ judgments in terms of accuracy (both strictly correct and correct

lenient). Strictly correct accuracy in this task measures the proportion of metaphors
both identified and paraphrased correctly in the given set of sentences. Correct lenient
accuracy, which demonstrates applicability of the system, is represented by the overall
proportion of paraphrases that retained their meaning and resulted in a literal para-
phrase (i.e., including literal paraphrasing of literal expressions in original sentences).
Human judgments were merged into a majority gold standard, which consists of those
instances that were considered correct (i.e., identified metaphor correctly paraphrased
by the system) by at least two judges. Compared to this majority gold standard, the
integrated system operates with a strictly correct accuracy of 0.66 and correct lenient
accuracy of 0.71. The average human agreement with the majority gold standard in
terms of accuracy is 0.80 on the literalness judgments and 0.89 on the meaning retention
judgments.

5.2 Phase 2: Larger Sample, One Judge

The systemwas also evaluated on a larger sample of automatically annotatedmetaphor-
ical expressions (600 sentences) using one person’s judgments produced following
the procedure from phase 1. We measured how far these judgments agree with the
judges used in phase 1. The agreement on meaning retention was measured at κ = 0.59
(n = 2,N = 35, k = 4) and that on the literalness of paraphrases at κ = 0.54 (n = 2,N =
70, k = 4).

On this larger data set, the system achieved an accuracy of 0.54 (strictly correct) and
0.67 (correct lenient). The proportions of different tagging cases are shown in Table 11.
The table also shows the acceptability of tagging cases. Acceptability indicates whether
or not this type of system paraphrasing would cause an error when hypothetically
integrated with an external NLP application. Cases where the system produces correct
literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions identified in the text would benefit
another NLP application, whereas cases where literal expressions are correctly para-
phrased by other literal expressions are considered neutral. Both such cases are deemed
acceptable, because they increase or preserve literalness of the text. All other tagging
cases introduce errors, thus they are marked as unacceptable. Examples of different
tagging cases are shown in Table 12.

The accuracy of metaphor-to-literal paraphrasing (0.54) indicates the level of in-
formative contribution of the system, and the overall accuracy of correct paraphrasing
resulting in a literal expression (0.67) represents the level of its acceptability within NLP.

5.3 Discussion and Error Analysis

The results of integrated system evaluation suggest that the system is capable of pro-
viding useful information about metaphor for an external text processing application

with a reasonable accuracy (0.67). It may, however, also introduce errors in the text by
incorrect paraphrasing, as well as by producing metaphorical paraphrases. If the latter
errors are rare (0.5%), the errors of the former type are sufficiently frequent (21.5%) to
make the metaphor system less desirable for use in NLP. It is therefore important to
address such errors.

Table 13 shows the contribution of the individual system components to the overall
error. The identification system tags 28% of all instances incorrectly (170). This yields a
component performance of 72%. This result is slightly lower than that obtained in its
individual evaluation in a setting with multiple judges (79%). This can be explained
by the fact that the integrated system was evaluated by one judge only, rather than
using a majority gold standard. When compared with the judgments of each annotator
pairwise the system precision was measured at 74% (cf. Section 3.3.2). Some of the
literal instances tagged as ametaphor by the identification component are then correctly
paraphrased with a literal expression by the paraphrasing component. Such cases do
not change the meaning of the text, and hence are considered acceptable. The resulting
contribution of the identification component to the overall error of the integrated system
is thus 15%.

As Table 13 shows, the paraphrasing component failed in 32% of all cases
(196 instances out of 600 were paraphrased incorrectly). As mentioned previously, this
error can be further split into paraphrasing without meaning retention (21.5%) and
metaphorical paraphrasing (11%). Both of these error types are unacceptable and lead
to lower performance of the integrated system. This error rate is also higher than that
of the paraphrasing system when evaluated individually on a manually created data
set (19%). The reasons for incorrect paraphrasing by the integrated system are manifold

and concern both themetaphor identification and paraphrasing components. One of the
central problems stems from the initial tagging of literal expressions as metaphorical by
the identification system. The paraphrasing system is not designed with literal-to-literal
paraphrasing in mind. When it receives literal expressions which have been incorrectly
identified as input, it searches for a more literal paraphrase for them. Not all literally
used words have suitable substitutes in the given context, however. For instance,
the literal expression “approve conclusion” is incorrectly paraphrased as “evaluate
conclusion.”

Similar errors occur when metaphorical expressions do not have any single-word
literal paraphrases, for example, “country functions according to...”. This is, however,
a more fundamental problem for metaphor paraphrasing as a task. In such cases, the
system, nonetheless, attempts to produce a substitute with approximately the same
meaning, which often leads to either metaphorical or incorrect paraphrasing. For in-
stance, “country functions” is paraphrased by “country runs,” with suggestions with
lower rank being “country works” and “country operates.”

Some errors that occur at the paraphrasing level are also due to the general
word sense ambiguity of certain verbs or nouns. Consider the following paraphras-
ing example, where Example (24a) shows an automatically identified metaphor and
Example (24b) its system-derived paraphrase:

(24) a. B71 852 Craig Packer and Anne Pusey of the University of Chicago have
continued to follow the life and loves of these Tanzanian lions.

b. B71 852 Craig Packer and Anne Pusey of the University of Chicago have
continued to succeed the life and loves of these Tanzanian lions.

This error results from the fact that the verb succeed has a high selectional preference for
life in one of its senses (“attain success or reach a desired goal”) and is similar to follow
in WordNet in another of its senses (“be the successor [of]”). The system merges these
two senses in one, resulting in an incorrect paraphrase.

One automatically identified example exhibited interaction of metaphor with
metonymy at the interpretation level. In the phrase “break word,” the verb break is used
metaphorically (although conventionally) and the noun word is a metonym standing
for promise. This affected paraphrasing in that the system searched for verbs denoting
actions that could be done with words, rather than promises, and suggested the para-
phrase “interrupt word(s).” This paraphrase is interpretable in the context of a person
giving a speech, but not in the context of a person giving a promise. This was the only
case of metonymy in the analyzed data, however.

Another issue that the evaluation on a larger data set revealed is the limitations of
the WordNet filter used in the paraphrasing system. Despite being a wide-coverage
general-domain database, WordNet does not include information about all possible
relations that exist between particular word senses. This means that some of the correct
paraphrases suggested by the context-based model get discarded by the WordNet filter
due to missing information in WordNet. For instance, the system produces no para-
phrase for the metaphors “hurl comment,” “spark enthusiasm,” and “magnify thought”
that it correctly identified. This problemmotivates the exploration of possibleWordNet-
free solutions for similarity detection in the metaphor paraphrasing task. The system
could either rely entirely on such a solution, or back off to it in cases when theWordNet-
based system fails.

Table 14 provides a summary of system errors by type. The most common errors
are caused by metaphor conventionality resulting in metaphorical paraphrasing (e.g.,

“swallow anger→ suppress anger,” “work killed him→ work exhausted him”), followed
by the WordNet filter– and general polysemy–related errors (e.g. “follow lives →
succeed lives”), resulting in incorrect paraphrasing or the system not producing any
paraphrase at all. Metaphor paraphrasing by another conventional metaphor instead
of a literal expression is undesirable, although it may still be useful if the paraphrases
are more lexicalized than the original expression. The word sense ambiguity– and
WordNet-based errors are more problematic, however, and need to be addressed in the
future. SP re-ranking is responsible for the majority of incorrect paraphrasing of literal
expressions. This may be due to the fact that the model is ignorant of the meaning
retention aspect, but rather favors the paraphrases that are used literally (albeit
incorrectly) in the given context. This shows that when building an integrated system,
it is necessary to adapt the metaphor paraphrasing module to be able to also handle
literal expressions, because the identification module is likely to produce at least some
of them.

5.4 Comparison to the CorMet System

It is hard to directly compare the performance of the presented system to the other
recent approaches to metaphor, because all of these approaches assume different task
definitions, and hence use data sets and evaluation techniques of their own. Among the
data-driven methods, however, the closest in nature to ours is Mason’s (2004) CorMet
system. Mason’s system does not perform metaphor interpretation or identification of
metaphorical expressions in text, but rather focuses on the detection of metaphorical
links between distant domains. Our system also involves such detection. Whereas
Mason relies on domain-specific selectional preferences for this purpose, however, our
system uses information about verb subcategorization, as well as general selectional
preferences, to perform distributional clustering of verbs and nouns and then link the
clusters based on metaphorical seeds. Another fundamental difference is that whereas
CorMet assigns explicit domain labels, our system models source and target domains
implicitly. In the evaluation of the CorMet system, the acquired metaphorical mappings
are compared to those in the manually created Master Metaphor List demonstrating the
accuracy of 77%. In our system, on the contrary, metaphor acquisition is evaluated via
extraction of naturally occurring metaphorical expressions, achieving a performance of
79% in terms of precision. In order to compare the new mapping acquisition ability

344



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

of our system to that of CorMet, however, we performed an additional analysis of the
mappings hypothesized by our noun clusters in relation to those in the MML. It was not
possible to compare the new mappings discovered by our system to the MML directly
as was done in Mason’s experiments, because in our approach source domains are
represented by clusters of their characteristic verbs. The analysis of the noun clusters
with respect to expansion of the the seed mappings taken from the MML, however,
allowed us to evaluate the mapping acquisition by our system in terms of both precision
and recall. The goal was to confirm our hypothesis that abstract concepts get clustered
together if they are associated with the same source domain and to evaluate the quality
of the newly acquired mappings.

To do this, we randomly selected 10 target domain categories described in the
MML and manually extracted all corresponding mappings (42 mappings in total).
The categories included SOCIETY, IDEA, LIFE, OPPORTUNITY, CHANGE, LOVE,
DIFFICULTY, CREATION, RELATIONSHIP, and COMPETITION. For the concept of
OPPORTUNITY, for example, three mappings were present in the MML: OPPORTU-
NITIES ARE PHYSICAL OBJECTS, OPPORTUNITIES ARE MOVING ENTITIES, and
OPPORTUNITIES ARE OPEN PATHS, whereas for the concept of COMPETITION the
list describes only two mappings: COMPETITION IS A RACE, COMPETITION IS A
WAR.

We then extracted the system-produced clusters containing the selected 10 target
concepts. Examples of the mappings and the corresponding clusters are shown in
Figure 13. Our goal was to verify whether other concepts in the cluster containing the
target concept are associated with the source domains given in the mappings. Each
member of these clusters was analyzed for possible association with the respective
source domains. For each concept in a cluster, we verified that it is associated with
the respective source domain by finding a corresponding metaphorical expression and
annotating the concepts accordingly. The degree of association of the members of the
clusters with a given source domain was evaluated in terms of precision on the set
of hypothesized mappings. The precision of the cluster’s association with the source

concept was calculated as a proportion of the associated concepts in it. Based on these
results we computed the average precision (AP) as follows:

AP = 1
M

M∑

j=1

#associated concepts in cluster cj
|cj|

(13)

whereM is the number of hypothesizedmappings and cj is the cluster of target concepts
corresponding to mapping j.

The annotation was carried out by one of the authors and its average precision
is 0.82. This confirms the hypothesis of clustering by association and shows that our
method favorably compares to Mason’s system. This is only an approximate compari-
son, however. Direct comparison of metaphor acquisition by the two systems was not
possible, as they produce the output in different formats and, as mentioned earlier, our
system models conceptual mappings implicitly, both within the noun clusters, as well
as by linking them to the verb clusters.

We then additionally evaluated the recall of mapping acquisition by our system
against the MML. For each selected MML mapping, we manually extracted all alter-
native target concepts associated with the source domain in the mapping from the
MML. For example, in case of LIFE IS A JOURNEY we identified all target concepts
associated with JOURNEY according to the MML and extracted them. These included
LIFE, CAREER, LOVE, and CHANGE. We then verified whether the relevant system-
produced noun clusters contained these concepts. The recall was then calculated as a
proportion of the concepts in this list within one cluster. For example, the concepts LIFE
and CAREER are found in the same cluster, but not LOVE and CHANGE. The overall
recall of mapping acquisition was measured at 0.50.

These results show that the system is able to discover a large number of metaphor-
ical connections in the data with high precision. Although the evaluation against the
Master Metaphor List is subjective, it suggests that the use of statistical data-driven
methods in general, and distributional clustering in particular, is a promising direction
for computational modeling of metaphor.

6. Conclusion and Future Directions

The 1980s and 1990s provided us with a wealth of ideas on the structure and mecha-
nisms of metaphor. The computational approaches formulated back then are still highly
influential, although their use of task-specific hand-coded knowledge is becoming in-
creasingly less popular. The last decade witnessed a significant technological leap in
natural language computation, whereby manually crafted rules gradually gave way
to more robust corpus-based statistical methods. This is also the case for metaphor
research. In this article, we presented the first integrated statistical system for metaphor
processing in unrestricted text. Our method is distinguished from previous work in that
it does not rely on anymetaphor-specific hand-coded knowledge (besides the seed set in
the identification experiments), operates on open-domain text, and produces interpreta-
tions in textual format. The system, consisting of independent metaphor identification
and paraphrasing modules, operates with a high precision (0.79 for identification, 0.81
for paraphrasing, and 0.67 as an integrated system). Although the system has been
tested only on verb–subject and verb–object metaphors at this stage, the described iden-
tification and paraphrasing methods should be similarly applicable to a wider range
of syntactic constructions. This expectation rests on the fact that both distributional

346



Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing

clustering and selectional preference induction techniques have been shown to model
the meanings of a range of word classes (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Boleda
Torrent and Alonso i Alemany 2003; Brockmann and Lapata 2003; Zapirain, Agirre,
and Màrquez 2009). Extending the system to deal with metaphors represented by other
word classes and constructions as well as multi-word metaphors is part of future work.

Such an extension of the identification system would require the creation of a
seed set exemplifying more syntactic constructions and the corpus search over fur-
ther grammatical relations (e.g., verb–prepositional phrase [PP] complement relations:
“Hillary leapt in the conversation;” adjectival modifier–noun relations “slippery mind,
deep unease, heavy loss;” noun–PP complement relations: “a fraction of self-control, a
foot of a mountain;” verb–VP complement relations: “aching to begin the day;” and
copula constructions: “Death is the sorry end of the human story, not a mysterious
prelude to a new one”). Besides noun and verb clustering, it would also be necessary
to perform clustering of adjectives and adverbs. Clusters of verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
and concrete nouns would then represent source domains within the model. The data
study of Shutova and Teufel (2010) suggested that it is sometimes difficult to choose the
optimal level of abstraction of domain categories that would generalize well over the
data. Although the system does not explicitly assign any domain labels, its domain
representation is still restricted by the fixed level of generality of source concepts,
defined by the chosen cluster granularity. To relax this constraint, one could attempt
to automatically optimize cluster granularity to fit the data more accurately and to
ensure that the generated clusters explain themetaphorical expressions in the data more
comprehensively. A hierarchical clustering algorithm, such as that of Yu, Yu, and Tresp
(2006) or Sun andKorhonen (2011), could be used for this purpose. Besides this, it would
be desirable to be able to generalize metaphorical associations learned from one type
of syntactic construction across all syntactic constructions, without providing explicit
seed examples for the latter. For instance, given the seed phrase “stir excitement,”
representing the conceptual mapping FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS, the system should be
able to discover not only that phrases such as “swallow anger” are metaphorical, but
that phrases such as “ocean of happiness” are as well.

The extension of the paraphrasing system to other syntactic constructions would
involve the extraction of further grammatical relations from the corpus, such as those
listed herein, and their incorporation into the context-based paraphrase selectionmodel.
Extending both the identification system and the paraphrasing system would require
the application of the selectional preference model to other word classes. Although
Resnik’s selectional association measure has been used to model selectional preferences
of verbs for their nominal arguments, it is in principle a generalizable measure of word
association. Information-theoretic word association measures (e.g., mutual information
[Church and Hanks 1990]) have been continuously successfully applied to a range of
syntactic constructions in a number of NLP tasks (Hoang, Kim, and Kan 2009; Baldwin
and Kim 2010). This suggests that applying a distributional association measure, such
as the one proposed by Resnik, to other part-of-speech classes should still result in a
realistic model of semantic fitness, which in our terms corresponds to a measure of
“literalness” of the paraphrases.

In addition, the selectional preference model can be improved by using an SP
acquisition algorithm that can handle word sense ambiguity (e.g., Rooth et al. 1999;
Ó Séaghdha 2010; Reisinger and Mooney 2010). The current approach relies on SP
classes produced by hard clustering and fails to accurately model word senses of gener-
ally polysemous words. This resulted in a number of errors in metaphor paraphrasing
and it therefore needs to be addressed in the future.

347



Computational Linguistics Volume 39, Number 2

The current version of the metaphor paraphrasing system still relies on some hand-
coded knowledge in the form of WordNet. WordNet has been criticized for a lack of
consistency, high granularity of senses, and negligence with respect to some important
semantic relations (Lenat, Miller, and Yokoi 1995). In addition, WordNet is a general-
domain resource, which is less suitable if one wanted to apply the system to domain-
specific data. For all of these reasons it would be preferable to develop a WordNet-free
fully automated approach to metaphor resolution. Vector space models of word mean-
ing (Erk 2009; Rudolph and Giesbrecht 2010; Van de Cruys, Poibeau, and Korhonen
2011) might provide a solution, as they have proved efficient in general paraphrasing
and lexical substitution settings (Erk and Padó 2009). The feature similarity component
of the paraphrasing system that is currently based on WordNet could be replaced by
such a model.

Another crucial problem that needs to be addressed is the coverage of the iden-
tification system. To enable high usability of the system it is necessary to perform
high-recall processing. One way to improve the coverage is the creation of a larger,
more diverse seed set. Although it is hardly possible to describe the whole variety of
metaphorical language, it is possible to compile a set representative of (1) all most com-
mon source–target domain mappings and (2) all types of syntactic constructions that
exhibit metaphoricity. The existing metaphor resources, primarily the Master Metaphor
List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991), and examples from the linguistic literature
about metaphor, could be a sensible starting point on a route to such a data set. Having
a diverse seed set should enable the identification system to attain a broad coverage of
the corpus.

The proposed text-to-text representation of metaphor processing is directly trans-
ferable to other NLP tasks and applications that could benefit from the inclusion of
a metaphor processing component. Overall, our results suggest that the system can
provide useful and accurate information about metaphor to other NLP tasks relying
on lexical semantics. In order to prove its usefulness for external applications, however,
an extrinsic task-based evaluation is outstanding. In the future, we intend to integrate
metaphor processing with NLP applications, exemplified by MT and opinion mining,
in order to demonstrate the contribution of this pervasive yet rarely addressed phe-
nomenon to natural language semantics.
