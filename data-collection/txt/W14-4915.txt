Abstract

When annotating non-standard languages, descriptively incomplete language phenomena (EA-
GLES, 1996) are often encountered. In this paper, we present examples of ambiguous forms
taken from a historical corpus and offer a classification of such descriptively incomplete lan-
guage phenomena and its rationale. We then discuss various approaches to the annotation of
these phenomena, arguing that multiple annotations provide the most appropriate encoding strat-
egy for the annotator. Finally, we show how multiple annotations can be encoded in existing
standards such as PAULA and GrAF.

1 Introduction

In grammatical annotations, a lack of ambiguity is of great benefit: The more distinctive the relationship
between a token and its morphological and syntactic attributes, the more successful and reliable the an-
notation. However, especially in corpora of non-standard language varieties annotators are confronted
with a significant number of cases of doubt and ambiguity. This problem has been more relevant in se-
mantic and syntactic analyses than in PoS tagging and morphological annotation, and consequently has
already been addressed in the former processes (Kountz et al., 2008; Bunt, 2007; Spranger and Kountz,
2007; Regneri et al., 2008) and incorporated into tools such as SALTO (Burchardt et al., 2006). With
respect to corpora of non-standard languages, ambiguous forms must be taken into consideration in mor-
phosyntactic tagging as well. This has been confirmed by current corpus projects of historical varieties
of German – for example, the “MERCURIUS Corpus of Early New High German” (ENHG1) (Pauly et
al., 2012) and the “Historical Tagset” (HiTS) (Dipper et al., 2013), which provide different options for
dealing with ambiguities at the level of part of speech. Below we will discuss examples of ambiguities
at the morphological level.
Within the extensive field of non-standard language annotations, we have concentrated on historical

linguistics, showcasing the kinds of ambiguities that historical corpus linguists must confront and how
they can be managed. Historical corpus linguistics based on annotation necessarily faces the challenge of
avoiding circular argumentation. The description of a historic language must be based on the annotated
texts of the corpus, since they are the only sources of linguistic material in historical grammatography.
However, no annotation of the material can be accomplished without a basic knowledge of the language
and its structure. Thus, an annotator confronted with a dubious case cannot know whether it is actu-
ally a case of ambiguity in the language system or whether the grammatical categories adopted for the
annotation do not fit the grammatical system of the non-standard language. Transferring the annotation
standards developed for a standardized language such as written New High German (NHG) to a historical
corpus might at first seem tempting, but this process would conceal the actual grammatical characteristics
of the language to be described.

2 Cases of descriptively incomplete phenomena

The project “Reference Corpus Middle Low German/ Low Rhenish (1200–1650)”2 transliterates and
grammatically annotates the Middle Low German (GML) texts from which we take our examples. Be-
cause GML is a non-standardized language that is not well described, ambiguous forms occur frequently,
and accurately interpreting them is a matter of high priority for any annotation. First, with regard to nouns
and pronouns, GML’s case syncretism3 should be mentioned. For personal pronouns, in particular the
syncretism of the dative and accusative forms in the first- and second-person singular and plural leads to
problems in annotation. However, in this section, we concentrate on the third person.
Table 1 illustrates the many identical forms of third person personal pronouns that are used for sev-

eral morphological feature values. Moreover, it reveals the distribution of case syncretism across the
three different genders of the third-person singular.4 While the neuter paradigm shows syncretism in
the nominative and accusative forms, for the feminine pronouns there are ambiguous forms not only for
nominative and accusative but also for genitive and dative. The masculine paradigm includes a partial
syncretism of dative and accusative for the pronoun en (‘him’).
In addition, there is syncretism in the dative forms of the third-person singular masculine and neuter

and in the third-person plural. Hence, in example (1),5 the word en could be either masculine or neuter if
there is no context providing reliable information on the gender of the referent, or it could even be plural
(where there is syncretism between the three genders). If en is plural or neuter, it can only be a dative
form, but if it is masculine, it could be either dative or accusative.

Even where the context provides additional information, often not all ambiguities can be resolved. In
example (1), the antecedent of en provides information on gender (masculine) and number (singular), but
the ambiguity with respect to case can only be resolved in a local context – here, the prepositional phrase.
The problem is that in GML the preposition dor (‘through’) can govern different cases. Consequently,
the case ambiguity in (1) cannot be resolved.
There are many other examples of ambiguous forms, for instance, the gender of nouns or the inflection

paradigm of verbs. For all these cases of ambiguity the annotation should provide as much grammatical
information on a given form as possible.

2The “Referenzkorpus Mittelniederdeutsch/ Niederrheinisch (1200–1650)” (“Reference Corpus Middle Low German/ Low
Rhenish”, or “ReN”), supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG)) and in development since February/ March
2013 at the universities of Hamburg and Münster, is part of the “Corpus of Historical German Texts”, together with the
corpora “Altdeutsch” (Old German), “Mittelhochdeutsch” (Middle High German), and “Frühneuhochdeutsch” (Early New
High German). More information on the structure of ReN can be found in Nagel and Peters (In print) and on the website
www.referenzkorpus-mnd-nrh.de. For information on the annotation used in ReN and possible grammatical analyses, see
Schröder (In print).

3Baerman (2006) asserts that “syncretism refers to the situation when a single inflectional form corresponds to multiple
morphosyntactic feature values” (363). With respect to the feature case, this means that identical forms are used for different
cases, e.g., for dative and accusative.

4The order of the pronouns was chosen for presentational reasons. The example en that we refer to in this paper is shown in
bold italics.

3 Types of descriptively incomplete language phenomena

In cases of descriptively incomplete language phenomena such as those described above, the annotator
(which could be a tool or a human) is unable to unambiguously assign an analysis to the language data.
This inability can have various causes. Consequently, EAGLES (1996) distinguishes between two types
of “descriptively incomplete phenomena”: underspecification and ambiguity. In the first case, the inabil-
ity arises because “the distinction between the different values of an attribute is not relevant”. The second
case is characterized as “the phenomenon of lack of information, where there is uncertainty between two
or more alternative descriptions”. For both of these types, EAGLES provides subtypes; however, in the
case of ambiguity, these subtypes also differ with respect to the reason for the uncertainty. In one subtype,
the apparent ambiguity could be resolved given more information. In the other, the uncertainty results
from a real ambiguity in the language or the given text and therefore cannot be resolved. Consequently, we
propose a differentiation between three types of descriptively incomplete language phenomena that can
occur during annotation: (i) uncertainty, i.e., incomplete information due to infrequent occurrence in the
training material (automatic annotation), incomplete treatment in annotation guidelines, or an incomplete
understanding of the language system (manual annotation); (ii) underspecification, i.e., incomplete in-
formation due to an undistinguished feature of the language system; and (iii) ambiguity, i.e., incomplete
information due to an ambiguity in the language data.
Returning to example (1), further analyses could provide evidence that the preposition dor (‘through’)

unambiguously takes the accusative case, such that this would represent a case of uncertainty. In English
personal pronouns, there is no distinction made between dative and accusative, both of which are repre-
sented by the objective case (Obj) (Quirk et al., 1985). If this were also true for GML, the example would
be a case of underspecification. However, it could also represent a true case of ambiguity. As long as
this categorization is unclear, the types cannot be distinguished.
Table 2 summarizes the distinction between these three types. Although all of them result in the same

situation for the annotator (machine or human), they differ with respect to the true analysis, which is
unknown to the annotator; it is therefore impossible for him or her to definitively assign a tag to the
token, as exemplified in Table 2. In situations of uncertainty or underspecification, an unambiguous,
true analysis exists. In the case of uncertainty, it is a matter of redefining the annotation guidelines to
help the annotating system to find this true analysis. In the case of underspecification, the tagset is too
fine-grained to provide the true analysis. Only by adjusting the tagset would the annotator be able to
determine the true analysis. Adjustments to the annotation guidelines and the tagset during the process of
annotation can be accomplished through the use of an annotation development cycle such as theMATTER
methodology (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012, 23–32). In the case of ambiguity, however, both analyses
are true. They should be retrievable for further interpretation and thus should both be assigned to the
token.
Optimally, the different types of incomplete information “should be distinguishable by different mark-

up” (EAGLES, 1996). But as we have argued, when annotating historical languages (or less-studied
languages in general), it is not always possible to decide at the time of annotation whether there is an
ambiguity, an underspecification, or an uncertainty, as all three result in the same problem for the an-
notator. Thus, in many cases, the annotator can only distinguish between the three types (if at all) after
the annotation has been completed and the quantitative results based on the annotated data have become
available. The three types must therefore be dealt with similarly during the annotation process, and the
possible interpretations should be retrievable from the annotations. Consequently, the annotator should
have the possibility to assign any number of annotations to every possible feature. This would require
special tools to create and retrieve these annotations, but existing standards to encode annotations are
already flexible enough to allow annotations. Some examples are shown in the next section.

4 Encoding multiple annotations in markup standards

This section presents three formats for encoding multiple annotations of descriptively incomplete struc-
tures in XML markup. We return to the ambiguous GML pronoun en ‘him/ it’ introduced in example (1)
in Section 2.

101



Our first option is TüPP-D/Z DTD (Ule, 2004), an inline-XML specification that was designed to
represent a ranked list of multiple competing tagger outputs resulting from ensemble tagging. Using the
same kind of structure, all possible interpretations of the pronoun en could be encoded and made available
for further analysis and disambiguation.
The other two options are generic XML-standoff formats that represent annotations as directed acyclic

graphs: PAULA (Dipper, 2005; Chiarcos et al., 2008), derived from early drafts of the Linguistic Anno-
tation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004), and GrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007), a more recent
specification of the LAF. Each level of annotation is represented separately, such that features are related
to annotation objects (“markables”) only by links. Markables themselves are defined on the basis of text
tokens or other markables. Multiple markables can be related to the same token, as each markable is
uniquely identified by its ID. These options also allow us to encode all interpretations of en.6

In certain cases, there are dependencies between multiple ambiguous features. Concerning ‘en’, if the
gender is Neut, the case is not ambiguous, but if the gender is Masc, the case could be either Dat or Acc
(cf. Table 1). The above strategies do not allow us to encode these dependencies. However, the generic
LAF-derived standoff formats can be employed to do this because they also allow us to define labels for
edges, such that they can be annotated and typed. Kountz et al. (2008) propose an extension to GrAF in
which such dependencies are explicitly modeled. As depicted in Figure 1, we make use of this property to
combine a choice structure with a collect structure. In this way, each token correlates with one MorphSet
object that can be instantiated by a set of MorphInst objects, thereby explicitly encoding the dependencies
between the multiple ambiguous features of gender and case.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

In order to avoid circular argumentation and to reveal the actual grammatical characteristics of the lan-
guage under investigation, historical corpus linguistics must go beyond simply adapting the rules of a
standardized language, both by disambiguating ambiguous forms but also by encoding ambiguities. By
means of data taken from the “ReN” corpus, we have demonstrated that in historical language corpora, an-
notators must deal with descriptively incomplete language phenomena. Furthermore, they need to decide
what type of phenomena these are, i.e., real ambiguities, underspecifications or uncertainties. Often this
decision is impossible at the time of the annotation, since all three types result in the same problem for the
annotator, as discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, we have shown that in markup formats such PAULA or
GrAF, the straightforward encoding of multiple annotations and their dependencies is possible. Neverthe-
less, linguists still lack sufficient tools to create, query, and visualize the multiple annotations represented
in the underlying data structure. For these reasons, corpus projects such as “ReN” are currently unable to
use multiple annotations, even though this is the most appropriate encoding strategy for the grammatical
annotation of historical languages.

6In addition, PAULA offers a multiFeat structure (Zeldes et al., 2013, 14f.) for linking sets of fully-specified features to one
markable. However, each piece of information must be unambiguous.
