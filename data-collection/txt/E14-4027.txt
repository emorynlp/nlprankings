Abstract 

In this paper, we investigate the problem of 

Ezafe recognition in Persian language. Ezafe is 

an unstressed vowel that is usually not written, 

but is intelligently recognized and pronounced 

by human. Ezafe marker can be placed into 

noun phrases, adjective phrases and some 

prepositional phrases linking the head and 

modifiers. Ezafe recognition in Persian is 

indeed a homograph disambiguation problem, 

which is a useful task for some language 

applications in Persian like TTS. In this paper, 

Part of Speech tags augmented by Ezafe 

marker (POSE) have been used to train a 

probabilistic model for Ezafe recognition. In 

order to build this model, a ten million word 

tagged corpus was used for training the 

system. For building the probabilistic model, 

three different approaches were used; 

Maximum Entropy POSE tagger, Conditional 

Random Fields (CRF) POSE tagger and also a 

statistical machine translation approach based 

on parallel corpus. It is shown that comparing 

to previous works, the use of CRF POSE 

tagger can achieve outstanding results.  

1 Introduction 

In Persian language, Ezafe is an unstressed 

short vowel /-e/ (or /-ye/ after vowels) which is 

used to link two words in some contexts. 

Although Ezafe is an important part of the 

Persian phonology and morphology, it does not 

have a specific character representation, and so is 

not usually written. However, it is pronounced as 

a short vowel /e/. Sometimes, for disambiguation 

purposes it is preferred to explicitly mark its 

presence by a written symbol (the diacritic Kasre) 

after some words in order to facilitate the correct 

pronunciation. 

The most important application of Ezafe 

recognition is a text to phoneme tool for Text To 

Speech (TTS) Systems. Other application of 

Ezafe recognition is identifying the dependency 

of a word in a Noun Phrase. (Oskouipour, 2011, 

Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012) 

In this research, we would like to investigate 

various approaches to correctly recognize 

genitive cases in Persian language. Shortly, the 

contributions of this paper are as follow: 

• Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as a 
sequence labeling system. 

• Using HMM and CRF as sequence labelers. 
• Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as a 

monotone translation problem which can be 

tackled by phrase based SMT approach. 

• Using a big amount of test and gold data, so 
the results are considerably reliable. 

• To enhance the results of the system, five 
Persian-specific features which discriminate 

the results in high-precision low-recall fashion, 

have been proposed. 

• The recognition rate has achieved outstanding 
results in comparison to the previous works.  

This task is closely related to the task of 

determining short vowels in Arabic language. So, 

although the aim of this paper is to recognize 

Ezafe in Persian language, but all the methods 

investigated here is applicable to determine short 

vowels in Arabic language. 

In the next section a clear definition of the 

problem is presented and the characteristics of 

Persian language are introduced. In Section 3 we 

will give a precise definition of Ezafe. Section 4 

provides an overview of previous works on 

Ezafe recognition. Our approach will be 

described in Section 5 followed by two sections 

including corpus selection process and 

implementation of proposed method. Conclusion 

and recommendations for future works will be 

presented in the last section.

2 An Overview of Persian Language 

Persian Language belongs to Arabic script-

based languages. This category of languages 

includes Kurdish, Urdu, Arabic, Pashtu and 

Persian. They all have common scripting, and 

somehow similar writing system. 

In Arabic script-based languages, the most 

common features are absence of capitalization, 

right to left direction, lack of clear word 

boundaries, complex word structure, encoding 

issues in computer environment, and a high 

degree of ambiguity due to non-representation of 

short vowels in writing (Farghaly, 2004). Note 

that Ezafe recognition and homograph 

disambiguation problem mostly deals with the 

last mentioned feature. 

One of the problems in Persian language 

processing is long-distance dependencies. This 

phenomenon complicates Ezafe recognition task 

even for humans (Ghomeshi, 1996). Another 

problem is how to determine phrase/word 

boundaries. In Persian language, affixes can be 

written in three formats; completely separated by 

a space delimiter, separated by half-space
1
, or 

can be attached to its main word. So, determining 

word and phrase boundaries are somehow a 

complicated task in Persian.The third challenge 

arises by pronoun drop due to the morphology of 

Persian language.  

3 Ezafe Definition 

Historically, Persian Ezafe had a 
demonstrative morpheme in old Iran (Estaji and 
Jahangiri, 2006). It was related to a demonstrative 
/hya/, which links the head noun to adjectival 
modifiers, to the possessor NP (Samvelian, P., 
2007). In evolution of Persian language, /hya/ 
became /–i/ in Middle Persian and progressively 
lost its demonstrative value to end as a simple 
linker. In recognizing Ezafe, we should consider 
all morphological, syntactic, semantic and 
discourse views (Parsafar, 2010). It should be 
noted that Ezafe can be iterated within the NP, 
occurring as many times as there are modifiers.  

4 Previous Works  

As a first attempt to recognize Ezafe in Persian 

text, Bijankhan (Bijankhan, 2005) used a pattern 

matching algorithm for Ezafe recognition. He 

has used POS tags and also semantic labels (such 

as place, time, ordinal numbers ...) to obtain a 

                                                           

1
A Non-Joint Zero Width (NJZW) letter 

statistical view of Ezafe markers. He manually 

derived 80 most frequent patterns such as Noun-

Noun and Noun-Adjective etc. The most 

frequent combinations were extracted based on a 

10 million-wordscorpus.  

In a research accomplished by (Isapour, et al., 

2007), the researchers rely on the fact that Ezafe 

can relate between head and its modifiers so as to 

help to build NPs. So by parsing sentences and 

finding Phrase borders, the location of Ezafe in 

the sentence can be found. In this work, the 

sentences were analyzed using a Probabilistic 

Context Free Grammar (PCFG) to derive phrase 

borders. Then based on the extracted parse tree, 

the head and modifiers in each phrase can be 

determined. In the last phase, a rule based 

approach was also applied to increase the 

accuracy in Ezafe marker labeling. For training 

the algorithm, 1000 sentences were selected and 

a parse tree was built for each of them. Because 

of the limited number of parsed sentences for 

training, the results cannot be extended for 

general applications. 

There were also other attempts to effectively 

recognize Ezafe marker in Persian text, such as 

(Zahedi, 1998) based on fuzzy sets. Also, 

(Oskouipour, 2011) developed a system based on 

Hidden Markove Model to correctly identify 

Ezafe markers. (Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012) had 

another attempt by syntactic analysis. There are 

also some implementations using neural 

networks (Razi and Eshqi, 2012). Some of the 

results can be seen in Table 4. 

5 Our Approach 

In this paper we have investigated two types 
of POS taggers, and also a MT-based approach. 
In the following section, these approaches will be 
explained and the results will be compared to 
previous work. 

A. Ezafe recognition as a POS tagging problem 

Part Of Speech tagging is an effective way for 

automatically assigning grammatical tags to 

words in a text. In Persian, POS tagging can be 

applied as a homograph disambiguation problem 

for correct pronunciation of words in a sentence 

(Yarowsky, 1996). There are powerful POS 

tagger algorithms such as statistical, rule based, 

transformation based and memory based learning 

methods. In this research we have used two 

schemes of statistical POS tagging for Ezafe 

recognition. The first one is a Maximum Entropy 

tagger that has been investigated by (Toutanova 

and Manning. 2000) and (Toutanova, et al. 

139



2003). In order to implement this approach, we 

have used Stanford toolkit as a MaxEnt tagger. 

The second approach is based on Conditional 

Random Fields (CRF) model, that was first 

introduced by (Lafferty, et al., 2001) and then 

(Sha and Pereira. 2003).  

B. Ezafe recognition as a translation problem 

We can consider the Ezafe recognition 
problem as a monotone translation problem. In 
other words, it can be considered as a noisy 
channel problem. The original training text 
without the Ezafe marker can be used as source 
language, and the tagged text can be used as 
destination language. So, we can apply these 
parallel corpora as inputs to a phrase-based 
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system.  

In the experiments, we have used monotone 
SMT with distortion limit equal to zero. For 
implementing SMT, we have used Moses toolkit. 
It should be mentioned that in the case of Ezafe 
recognition, we can use a SMT system without 
re-ordering. By using phrase-based SMT, the 
local dependencies between the neighboring 
words are handled by the phrase table. Also some 
of the dependencies between different phrases 
can be tackled by the language model. 

6 Data Preparation 

In this work, we have used Bijankhan corpus 
(Bijankhan, 2004, Amiri, et al, 2007). The 
content of this corpus is gathered from daily news 
and common texts, covering 4300 different 
subjects. It contains about 10 million tagged 
words in about 370000 sentences. The words in 
the corpus have been tagged by 550 tags based on 
a hierarchical order, with more fine-grained POS 
tags like ‘noun-plural-subj’. About 23% of words 
in the corpus are tagged with Ezafe. We have 
used an extended version of POS tags, named 
POSE (Part of Speech tags + Ezafe tag) that can 
be constructed by adding Ezafe markers to 
original first level tags. Table 1 shows the 
statistics of POSE tags.

Table 1 - Ezafe Statistics in Bijankhan Corpus 

7 Performance Metrics 

The ordinary measures that can be used based 
on confusion matrix are Precision, Recall and F1 
measure. Another measure that can be used in 
this binary classification problem is Mathews 
Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This measure 
indicates the quality of the classifier for binary 
class problems especially when two classes are of 
very different sizes.We have also considered two 
other measures; true positive rate as Ezafe 
presence accuracy, and false positive rate as 
Ezafe absence accuracy. The total average can be 
calculated using a weighted average of the two 
last mentioned measures.  

8 Experiments and Results 

As mentioned, the system was trained on 
Bijankhan corpus. Only the first level of POS 
tags was used for the training phase, except for 
the words with Ezafe, that the POS plus Ezafe 
marker was chosen. The more fine-grained POS 
tags were removed to achieve more accuracy. 

We used a ten-fold cross-validation scheme. 
For calculating the total accuracy, Ezafe presence 
accuracy and Ezafe absence accuracy should be 
weighted by 16.8% (ratio of words with Ezafe 
marker in test corpus) and 83.2% (ratio of words 
without Ezafe marker) respectively.  

A. Evaluating fine-grained tags 

The first experiment was done in order to test 
the ability of other fine grained POS tags in Ezafe 
recognition. In this test that was done on 30% of 
the corpus, all of the fine grained POS tags of the 
words plus Ezafe marker were used to train a 
Maximum Entropy POSE tagger.  As shown in 
Table 2, the accuracy of the system decreased 
when we used complete features hierarchy. So, in 
consequent experiments, we used only first level 
tag features.

97.21% was resulted. As shown in the Table 3, 

while we have a good recall rate, the precision

C. Using Persian-specific features 

Augmenting the system with some Persian
specific features to decrease FP and FN can 
significantly increase the total accuracy. As 
shown in Table 3, by using five 
accuracy can be increased by more than 0.6%. 
The features are as follow: 

• Punctuations cannot take Ezafe. B
feature, these FP errors will be removed

• Noun words which are followed by adjectives 
and adverbs should take Ezafe marker.

• Adjectives which are followed by nouns and 
adverbs should take Ezafe marker.

• Adverbs which are followed by nouns and 
adverbs should take Ezafe marker.

• Nouns, adverbs and adjectives which are 
followed by verbs do not take Ezafe.

9 Conclusions 

In this paper, we proposed a POSE tagging 
approach to recognize Ezafe in Persian sentences. 
Besides to this probabilistic approach, some 
features were extracted to increase the 
recognition accuracy. Experimental results show 
that CRF tagger acts pretty well in Persian Ezafe
recognition. The obtained 
outstanding performance compar
approaches and the accuracy is quite reliable 
because of training based on a 10 million
corpus.Future research can be done based on 
other taggers such as log-linear and TnT taggers. 
Moreover, Ezafe recognition can be viewed as a 
spell checking problem.So, a spell checker can 
also be used as another approach.
