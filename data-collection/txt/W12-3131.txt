Abstract

This paper describes the French-English trans-
lation system developed by the Avenue re-
search group at Carnegie Mellon University
for the Seventh Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (NAACL WMT12). We
present a method for training data selection,
a description of our hierarchical phrase-based
translation system, and a discussion of the im-
pact of data size on best practice for system
building.

1 Introduction

We describe the French-English translation sys-
tem constructed by the Avenue research group at
Carnegie Mellon University for the shared trans-
lation task in the Seventh Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. The core translation system
uses the hierarchical phrase-based model described
by Chiang (2007) with sentence-level grammars ex-
tracted and scored using the methods described by
Lopez (2008). Improved techniques for data selec-
tion and monolingual text processing significantly
improve the performance of the baseline system.

Over half of all parallel data for the French-
English track is provided by the Giga-FrEn cor-
pus (Callison-Burch et al., 2009). Assembled from
crawls of bilingual websites, this corpus is known to
be noisy, containing sentences that are either not par-
allel or not natural language. Rather than simply in-
cluding or excluding the resource in its entirety, we
use a relatively simple technique inspired by work in
machine translation quality estimation to select the

best portions of the corpus for inclusion in our train-
ing data. Including around 60% of the Giga-FrEn
chosen by this technique yields an improvement of
0.7 BLEU.

Prior to model estimation, we process all parallel
and monolingual data using in-house tokenization
and normalization scripts that detect word bound-
aries better than the provided WMT12 scripts. After
translation, we apply a monolingual rule-based post-
processing step to correct obvious errors and make
sentences more acceptable to human judges. The
post-processing step alone yields an improvement of
0.3 BLEU to the final system.

We conclude with a discussion of the impact of
data size on important decisions for system building.
Experimental results show that “best practice” deci-
sions for smaller data sizes do not necessarily carry
over to systems built with “WMT-scale” data, and
provide some explanation for why this is the case.

2 Training Data

Training data provided for the French-English trans-
lation task includes parallel corpora taken from Eu-
ropean Parliamentary proceedings (Koehn, 2005),
news commentary, and United Nations documents.
Together, these sets total approximately 13 million
sentences. In addition, a large, web-crawled parallel
corpus termed the “Giga-FrEn” (Callison-Burch et
al., 2009) is made available. While this corpus con-
tains over 22 million parallel sentences, it is inher-
ently noisy. Many parallel sentences crawled from
the web are neither parallel nor sentences. To make
use of this large data source, we employ data se-
lection techniques discussed in the next subsection.

Table 1: Parallel training data

Parallel data used to build our final system totals 27
million sentences. Precise figures for the number of
sentences in each data set, including selections from
the Giga-FrEn, are found in Table 1.

2.1 Data Selection as Quality Estimation

Drawing inspiration from the workshop’s featured
task, we cast the problem of data selection as one
of quality estimation. Specia et al. (2009) report
several estimators of translation quality, the most ef-
fective of which detect difficult-to-translate source
sentences, ungrammatical translations, and transla-
tions that align poorly to their source sentences. We
can easily adapt several of these predictive features
to select good sentence pairs from noisy parallel cor-
pora such as the Giga-FrEn.

We first pre-process the Giga-FrEn by removing
lines with invalid Unicode characters, control char-
acters, and insufficient concentrations of Latin char-
acters. We then score each sentence pair in the re-
maining set (roughly 90% of the original corpus)
with the following features:

Source language model: a 4-gram modified
Kneser-Ney smoothed language model trained on
French Europarl, news commentary, UN doc, and
news crawl corpora. This model assigns high scores
to grammatical source sentences and lower scores to
ungrammatical sentences and non-sentences such as
site maps, large lists of names, and blog comments.
Scores are normalized by number of n-grams scored
per sentence (length + 1). The model is built using
the SRILM toolkit (Stolke, 2002).

Target language model: a 4-gram modified
Kneser-Ney smoothed language model trained on
English Europarl, news commentary, UN doc, and
news crawl corpora. This model scores grammati-
cality on the target side.

Word alignment scores: source-target and
target-source MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008)
force-alignment scores using IBM Model 4 (Och
and Ney, 2003). Model parameters are estimated
on 2 million words of French-English Europarl and
news commentary text. Scores are normalized by
the number of alignment links. These features mea-
sure the extent to which translations are parallel with
their source sentences.

Fraction of aligned words: source-target and
target-source ratios of aligned words to total words.
These features balance the link-normalized align-
ment scores.

To determine selection criteria, we use this feature
set to score the news test sets from 2008 through
2011 (10K parallel sentences) and calculate the
mean and standard deviation of each feature score
distribution. We then select two subsets of the Giga-
FrEn, “1stdev” and “2stdev”. The 1stdev set in-
cludes sentence pairs for which the score for each
feature is above a threshold defined as the develop-
ment set mean minus one standard deviation. The
2stdev set includes sentence pairs not included in
1stdev that meet the per-feature threshold of mean
minus two standard deviations. Hard, per-feature
thresholding is motivated by the notion that a sen-
tence pair must meet all the criteria discussed above
to constitute good translation. For example, high
source and target language model scores are irrel-
evant if the sentences are not parallel.

As primarily news data is used for determining
thresholds and building language models, this ap-
proach has the added advantage of preferring par-
allel data in the domain we are interested in translat-
ing. Our final translation system uses data from both
1stdev and 2stdev, corresponding to roughly 60% of
the Giga-FrEn corpus.

2.2 Monolingual Data
Monolingual English data includes European Parlia-
mentary proceedings (Koehn, 2005), news commen-
tary, United Nations documents, news crawl, the En-
glish side of the Giga-FrEn, and the English Giga-
word Fourth Edition (Parker et al., 2009). We use all
available data subject to the following selection de-
cisions. We apply the initial filter to the Giga-FrEn
to remove non-text sections, leaving approximately
90% of the corpus. We exclude the known prob-

lematic New York Times section of the Gigaword.
As many data sets include repeated boilerplate text
such as copyright information or browser compat-
ibility notifications, we unique sentences from the
UN doc, news crawl, Giga-FrEn, and Gigaword sets
by source. Final monolingual data totals 4.7 billion
words before uniqueing and 3.9 billion after. Word
counts for all data sources are shown in Table 2.

2.3 Text Processing

All monolingual and parallel system data is run
through a series of pre-processing steps before
construction of the language model or translation
model. We first run an in-house normalization script
over all text in order to convert certain variably en-
coded characters to a canonical form. For example,
thin spaces and non-breaking spaces are normalized
to standard ASCII space characters, various types of
“curly” and “straight” quotation marks are standard-
ized as ASCII straight quotes, and common French
and English ligatures characters (e.g. œ, fi) are re-
placed with standard equivalents.

English text is tokenized with the Penn Treebank-
style tokenizer attached to the Stanford parser (Klein
and Manning, 2003), using most of the default op-
tions. We set the tokenizer to Americanize vari-
ant spellings such as color vs. colour or behavior
vs. behaviour. Currency-symbol normalization is
avoided.

For French text, we use an in-house tokenization
script. Aside from the standard tokenization based
on punctuation marks, this step includes French-
specific rules for handling apostrophes (French eli-
sion), hyphens in subject-verb inversions (includ-
ing the French t euphonique), and European-style
numbers. When compared to the default WMT12-

provided tokenization script, our custom French
rules more accurately identify word boundaries, par-
ticularly in the case of hyphens. Figure 1 highlights
the differences in sample phrases. Subject-verb in-
versions are broken apart, while other hyphenated
words are unaffected; French aujourd’hui (“today”)
is retained as a single token to match English.

Parallel data is run through a further filtering step
to remove sentence pairs that, by their length char-
acteristics alone, are very unlikely to be true parallel
data. Sentence pairs that contain more than 95 to-
kens on either side are globally discarded, as are sen-
tence pairs where either side contains a token longer
than 25 characters. Remaining pairs are checked for
length ratio between French and English, and sen-
tences are discarded if their English translations are
either too long or too short given the French length.
Allowable ratios are determined from the tokenized
training data and are set such that approximately the
middle 95% of the data, in terms of length ratio, is
kept for each French length.

3 Translation System

Our translation system uses cdec (Dyer et al.,
2010), an implementation of the hierarchical phrase-
based translation model (Chiang, 2007) that uses the
KenLM library (Heafield, 2011) for language model
inference. The system translates from cased French
to cased English; at no point do we lowercase data.

The Parallel data is aligned in both directions us-
ing the MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) imple-
mentation of IBM Model 4 and symmetrized with
the grow-diag-final heuristic (Och and Ney,
2003). The aligned corpus is then encoded as a
suffix array to facilitate sentence-level grammar ex-
traction and scoring (Lopez, 2008). Grammars are
extracted using the heuristics described by Chiang
(Chiang, 2007) and feature scores are calculated ac-
cording to Lopez (2008).

Modified Knesser-Ney smoothed (Chen and
Goodman, 1996) n-gram language models are built
from the monolingual English data using the SRI
language modeling toolkit (Stolke, 2002). We ex-
periment with both 4-gram and 5-gram models.

System parameters are optimized using minimum
error rate training (Och, 2003) to maximize the
corpus-level cased BLEU score (Papineni et al.,

velopment set is chosen for its known stability and
reliability.

Our baseline translation system uses Viterbi de-
coding while our final system uses segment-level
Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (Kumar and Byrne,
2004) over 500-best lists using 1 - BLEU as the loss
function.

3.1 Post-Processing

Our final system includes a monolingual rule-based
post-processing step that corrects obvious transla-
tion errors. Examples of correctable errors include
capitalization, mismatched punctuation, malformed
numbers, and incorrectly split compound words. We
finally employ a coarse cognate translation system
to handle out-of-vocabulary words. We assume that
uncapitalized French source words passed through
to the English output are cognates of English words
and translate them by removing accents. This fre-
quently leads to (in order of desirability) fully cor-
rect translations, correct translations with foreign
spellings, or correct translations with misspellings.
All of the above are generally preferable to untrans-
lated foreign words. Examples of cognate transla-
tions for OOV words in newstest 2011 are shown in
Figure 2.1

1Some OOVs are caused by misspellings in the dev-test
source sentences. In these cases we can salvage misspelled En-
glish words in place of misspelled French words

4 Experiments

Beginning with a baseline translation system, we in-
crementally evaluate the contribution of additional
data and components. System performance is eval-
uated on newstest 2011 using BLEU (uncased and
cased) (Papineni et al., 2002), Meteor (Denkowski
and Lavie, 2011), and TER (Snover et al., 2006).
For full consistency with WMT11, we use the NIST
scoring script, TER-0.7.25, and Meteor-1.3 to eval-
uate cased, detokenized translations. Results are
shown in Table 3, where each evaluation point is the
result of a full tune/test run that includes MERT for
parameter optimization.

The baseline translation system is built from 14
million parallel sentences (Europarl, news commen-
tary, and UN doc) and all monolingual data. Gram-
mars are extracted using the “tight” heuristic that
requires phrase pairs to be bounded by word align-
ments. Both 4-gram and 5-gram language models
are evaluated. Viterbi decoding is conducted with a
cube pruning pop limit (Chiang, 2007) of 200. For
this data size, the 4-gram model is shown to signifi-
cantly outperform the 5-gram.

Adding the 1stdev and 2stdev sets from the Giga-
FrEn increases the parallel data size to 27 million

sentences and further improves performance. These
runs require new grammars to be extracted, but
use the same 4-gram language model and decoding
method as the baseline system. With large training
data, moving to a 5-gram language model, increas-
ing the cube pruning pop limit to 1000, and using
Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (Kumar and Byrne,
2004) over 500-best lists collectively show a slight
improvement. Monolingual post-processing yields
further improvement. This decoding/processing
scheme corresponds to our final translation system.

4.1 Impact of Data Size

The WMT French-English track provides an oppor-
tunity to experiment in a space of data size that is
generally not well explored. We examine the impact
of data sizes of hundreds of millions of words on
two significant system building decisions: grammar
extraction and language model estimation. Compar-
ative results are reported on the newstest 2011 set.

In the first case, we compare the “tight” extrac-
tion heuristic that requires phrases to be bounded
by word alignments to the “loose” heuristic that al-
lows unaligned words at phrase edges. Lopez (2008)
shows that for a parallel corpus of 107 million
words, using the loose heuristic produces much
larger grammars and improves performance by a full
BLEU point. However, even our baseline system
is trained on substantially more data (587 million
words on the English side) and the addition of the
Giga-FrEn sets increases data size to 745 million
words, seven times that used in the cited work. For
each data size, we decode with grammars extracted
using each heuristic and a 4-gram language model.
As shown in Table 4, the differences are much
smaller and the tight heuristic actually produces the
best result for the full data scenario. We believe
this to be directly linked to word alignment quality:
smaller training data results in sparser, noisier word

745M 5-gram 29.8 28.9 34.4 51.7

Table 5: Results for language model order (dev-test)

alignments while larger data results in denser, more
accurate alignments. In the first case, accumulating
unaligned words can make up for shortcomings in
alignment quality. In the second, better rules are ex-
tracted by trusting the stronger alignment model.

We also compare 4-gram and 5-gram language
model performance with systems using tight gram-
mars extracted from 587 million and 745 million
sentences. As shown in Table 5, the 4-gram sig-
nificantly outperforms the 5-gram with smaller data
while the two are indistinguishable with larger data2.
With modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, a lower or-
der model will outperform a higher order model if
the higher order model constantly backs off to lower
orders. With stronger grammars learned from larger
parallel data, the system is able to produce output
that matches longer n-grams in the language model.

5 Summary

We have presented the French-English translation
system built for the NAACL WMT12 shared transla-
tion task, including descriptions of our data selection
and text processing techniques. Experimental re-
sults have shown incremental improvement for each
addition to our baseline system. We have finally
discussed the impact of the availability of WMT-
scale data on system building decisions and pro-
vided comparative experimental results.
