Abstract

Opinion mining is often regarded as a clas-
sification or segmentation task, involving
the prediction of i) subjective expressions,
ii) their target and iii) their polarity. In-
tuitively, these three variables are bidirec-
tionally interdependent, but most work has
either attempted to predict them in isolation
or proposing pipeline-based approaches
that cannot model the bidirectional interac-
tion between these variables. Towards bet-
ter understanding the interaction between
these variables, we propose a model that
allows for analyzing the relation of target
and subjective phrases in both directions,
thus providing an upper bound for the im-
pact of a joint model in comparison to a
pipeline model. We report results on two
public datasets (cameras and cars), show-
ing that our model outperforms state-of-
the-art models, as well as on a new dataset
consisting of Twitter posts.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the task of
identifying subjective statements about products,
their polarity (e. g. positive, negative or neutral)
in addition to the particular aspect or feature of
the entity that is under discussion, i. e., the so-
called target. Opinion analysis is thus typically
approached as a classification (Täckström and Mc-
Donald, 2011; Sayeed et al., 2012; Pang and Lee,
2004) or segmentation (Choi et al., 2010; Johans-
son and Moschitti, 2011; Yang and Cardie, 2012)
task by which fragments of the input are classi-
fied or labelled as representing a subjective phrase
(Yang and Cardie, 2012), a polarity or a target (Hu
and Liu, 2004; Li et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni,
2005; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010). As an example,
the sentence “I like the low weight of the camera.”

contains a subjective term “like”, and the target
“low weight”, which can be classified as a positive
statement.

While the three key variables (subjective phrase,
polarity and target) intuitively influence each other
bidirectionally, most work in the area of opinion
mining has concentrated on either predicting one
of these variables in isolation (e. g. subjective ex-
pressions by Yang and Cardie (2012)) or modeling
the dependencies uni-directionally in a pipeline ar-
chitecture, e. g. predicting targets on the basis of
perfect and complete knowledge about subjective
terms (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010). However, such
pipeline models do not allow for inclusion of bidi-
rectional interactions between the key variables. In
this paper, we propose a model that can include
bidirectional dependencies, attempting to answer
the following questions which so far have not been
addressed but provide the basis for a joint model:

• What is the impact of the performance loss
of a non-perfect subjective term extraction in
comparison to perfect knowledge?
• Further, how does perfect knowledge about

targets influence the prediction of subjective
terms?
• How is the latter affected if the knowledge

about targets is imperfect, i. e. predicted by a
learned model?

We study these questions using imperatively de-
fined factor graphs (IDFs, McCallum et al. (2008),
McCallum et al. (2009)) to show how these bi-
directional dependencies can be modeled in an ar-
chitecture which allows for further steps towards
joint inference. IDFs are a convenient way to define
probabilistic graphical models that make structured
predictions based on complex dependencies.

2 A Model for the Extraction of Target
Phrases and Subjective Expressions

This section gives a brief introduction to impera-
tively defined factor graphs and then introduces our
model.

2.1 Imperatively Defined Factor Graphs

A factor graph (Kschischang et al., 2001) is a bi-
partite graph over factors and variables. Let factor
graph G define a probability distribution over a
set of output variables y conditioned on input vari-
ables x. A factor Ψi computes a scalar value over
the subset of variables xi and yi that are neighbors
of Ψi in the graph. Often this real-valued function
is defined as the exponential of an inner product
over sufficient statistics {fik(xi,yi)} and parame-
ters {θik}, where k ∈ [1,Ki] and Ki is the number
of parameters for factor Ψi.

A factor template Tj consists of parameters
{θjk}, sufficient statistic functions {fjk}, and a
description of an arbitrary relationship between
variables, yielding a set of tuples {(xj ,yj)}. For
each of these tuples, the factor template instan-
tiates a factor that shares {θjk} and {fjk} with
all other instantiations of Tj . Let T be the set of
factor templates and Z(x) be the partition func-
tion for normalization. The probability distri-
bution can then be written as p(y|x) = 1Z(x)∏

Tj∈T
∏

(xi,yi)∈Tj exp
(∑Kj

k=1 θjkfjk(xi,yi)
)
.

defined factor graphs in the context of Markov

chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference, a common
approach for inference in very large graph struc-
tures (Culotta and McCallum, 2006; Richardson
and Domingos, 2006; Milch et al., 2006). The
term imperative is used to denote that actual code
in an imperative programming language is writ-
ten to describe templates and the relationship of
tuples they yield. This flexibility is beneficial for
modeling inter-dependencies as well as designing
information flow in joint models.

2.2 Model

Our model is similar to a semi-Markov conditional
random field (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004). It pre-
dicts the offsets for target mentions and subjective
phrases and can use the information of each other
during inference. In contrast to a linear chain con-
ditional random field (Lafferty et al., 2001), this al-
lows for taking distant dependencies of unobserved
variables into account and simplifies the design of
features measuring characteristics of multi-token
phrases. The relevant variables, i. e. target and sub-
jective phrase, are modelled via complex span vari-
ables of the form s = (l, r, c) with a left and right
offset l and r, and a class c ∈ {target, subjective}.
These offsets denote the span on a token sequence
t = (t1, . . . , tn).

We use two different templates to define factors
between variables: a single span template and an
inter-span template. The single span template de-
fines factors with scores based on features of the
tokens in the span and its vicinity. In our model,
all features are boolean. As token-based features
we use the POS tag, the lower-case representation
of the token as well as both in combination. The
actual span representation consists of these features
prefixed with “I” for all tokens in the span, with “B”
for the token at the beginning of the span, and with
“E” for the token at the end of the span. In addition,
the sequence of POS tags of all tokens in the span
is included as a feature.

The inter-span template takes three characteris-
tics of spans into account: Firstly, we measure if
a potential target span contains a noun which is
the closest noun to a subjective expression. Sec-
ondly, we measure for each span if a span of the
other class is in the same sentence. A third fea-
ture indicates whether there is only one edge in the
dependency graph between the tokens contained
in spans of a different class. These features are
to a great extent inspired by Jakob and Gurevych

849



(2010). For parsing, we use the Stanford parser
(Klein and Manning, 2003).

The features described so far, however, cannot
differentiate between a possible aspect mention
which is a target of a subjective expression and
one which is not. Therefore, the features of the
inter-span template are actually built by taking the
cross-product of the three described characteristics
with all single-span features. Spans which are not
in the context of a span of a different class are rep-
resented by a ‘negated’ feature (namely No-Close-
Noun, No-Single-Edge, and Not-Both-In-Sentence).
The example in Figure 1 shows features for two
spans which are in context of each other. All of
these features representing the text are taken into
account for each class, i. e., target and subjective
expression.

Inference is performed via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In each sampling step,
only the variables which actually change need to
be evaluated, and therefore the sampler directs the
process of unrolling the templates to factors. These
world changes are necessary to find the maximum
a posteriori (MAP) configuration as well as learn-
ing the parameters of the model. For each token
in the sequence, a span of length one of each class
is proposed if no span containing the token exists.
For each existing span, it is proposed to change
its label, shorten or extend it by one token if pos-
sible (all at the beginning and at the end of the
span, respectively). Finally, a span can be removed
completely.

In order to learn the parameters of our model, we
apply SampleRank (Wick et al., 2011). A crucial
component in the framework is the objective func-
tion which gives feedback about the quality of a
sample proposal during training. We use the follow-
ing objective function f(t) to evaluate a proposed
span t:

f(t) = max
g∈s

o(t,g)

|g| − α · p(t,g) ,

where s is the set of all spans in the gold standard.
Further, the function o calculates the overlap in
terms of tokens of two spans and the function p
returns the number of tokens in t that are not con-
tained in g, i. e., those which are outside the overlap
(both functions taking into account the class of the
span). Thus, the first part of the objective function
represents the fraction of correctly proposed con-
tiguous tokens, while the second part penalizes a

span for containing too many tokens that are out-
side the best span. Here, α is a parameter which
controls the penalty.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Experimental Setting

We report results on the J.D. Power and Associates
Sentiment Corpora2, an annotated data set of blog
posts in the car and in the camera domain (Kessler
et al., 2010). From the rich annotation set, we
use subjective terms and entity mentions which
are in relation to them as targets. We do not con-
sider comitter, negator, neutralizer,
comparison, opo, or descriptor annota-
tions to be subjective expressions. Results on these
data sets are compared to Jakob and Gurevych
(2010).

In addition, we report results on a Twitter data
set3 for the first time (Spina et al., 2012). Here,
we use a Twitter-specific tokenizer and POS tag-
ger4 (Owoputi et al., 2013) instead of the Stanford
parser. Hence, the single-edge-based feature de-
scribed in Section 2.2 is not used for this dataset. A
short summary of the datasets is given in Table 1.

As evaluation metric we use the F1 measure, the
harmonic mean between precision and recall. True
positive spans are evaluated in a perfect match and
approximate match mode, where the latter regards
a span as positive if one token within it is included
in a corresponding span in the gold standard. In this
case, other predicted spans matching the same gold
span do not count as false positives. In the objective
function, α is set to 0.01 to prefer spans which are
longer than the gold phrase over predicting no span.

Four different experiments are performed (all
via 10-fold cross validation): First, predicting sub-
jectivity expressions followed by predicting targets
while making use of the previous prediction. Sec-

diction can be with perfect knowledge of the other
variable as well as an estimate of how good the
prediction can be without any previous knowledge.

3.2 Results

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the results for the four
different settings compared to the results by Jakob
and Gurevych (2010) for cars and cameras. The
darker bars correspond to perfect match, the lighter
ones to the increase when taking partial matches
into account. In the following we only discuss the
perfect match.

Comparing the results (for the car and camera

data sets, Figure 2 and 3) for subjectivity predic-
tion, one can observe a limited performance when
targets are not known (0.54F1 for the camera set,
0.56F1 for the car set), an upper bound with per-
fect target information is much higher (0.65F1,
0.7F1). When first predicting targets followed by
subjective term prediction, we obtain results of
0.6F1 and 0.66F1. The results for target predic-
tion are much lower when not knowing subjec-
tive expressions in advance (0.32F1, 0.33F1), and
clearly increase with predicted subjective expres-
sions (0.48F1, 0.43F1) and outperform previous
results when compared to Jakob and Gurevych
(2010) (0.58F1, 0.55F1 in comparison to their
0.5F1 on both sets).

The results for the Twitter data set show the same
characteristics (in Figure 4). However, they are
generally much lower. In addition, the difference
between exact and partial match evaluation modes

is higher. This is due to the existence of many more
phrases spanning multiple tokens.

Exemplarily, the impact of the three features in
the inter-span templates for the camera data set is
depicted in Figure 5 for (a) given subjective terms
(b) given targets, respectively. Detecting the clos-
est noun is mainly of importance for target iden-
tification and only to a minor extent for detecting
subjective phrases. A short path in the dependency
graph and detecting if both phrases are in the same
sentence have a high positive impact for both sub-
jective and target phrases.

3.3 Conclusion and Discussion
The experiments in this paper show that target
phrases and subjective terms are clearly interde-
pendent. However, the impact of knowledge about
one type of entity for the prediction of the other
type of entity has been shown to be asymmetric.
The results clearly suggest that the impact of sub-

jective terms on target terms is higher than the other
way round. Therefore, if a pipeline architecture is
chosen, this order is to be preferred. However, the
results with perfect knowledge of the counterpart
entity show (in both directions) that the entities
influence each other positively. Therefore, the chal-
lenge of extracting subjective expressions and their
targets is a great candidate for applying supervised,
joint inference.
