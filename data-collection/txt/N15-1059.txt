Abstract

The semantic representation of individual
word senses and concepts is of fundamental
importance to several applications in Natu-
ral Language Processing. To date, concept
modeling techniques have in the main based
their representation either on lexicographic re-
sources, such as WordNet, or on encyclope-
dic resources, such as Wikipedia. We pro-
pose a vector representation technique that
combines the complementary knowledge of
both these types of resource. Thanks to its
use of explicit semantics combined with a
novel cluster-based dimensionality reduction
and an effective weighting scheme, our repre-
sentation attains state-of-the-art performance
on multiple datasets in two standard bench-
marks: word similarity and sense clustering.
We are releasing our vector representations at

1 Introduction

Obtaining accurate semantic representations of indi-
vidual word senses or concepts is vital for several
applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
such as, for example, Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012), Entity Linking
(Bunescu and Paşca, 2006; Rao et al., 2013), seman-
tic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), Informa-
tion Extraction (Banko et al., 2007), and resource
linking and integration (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014).
One prominent semantic representation approach is
the distributional semantic model, which represents
lexical items as vectors in a semantic space. The
weights in these vectors were traditionally computed

on the basis of co-occurrence statistics (Salton et al.,
1975; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Dinu and Lapata,
2010; Lappin and Fox, 2014), whereas for the more
recent generation of distributional models weight
computation is viewed as a context prediction prob-
lem, often to be solved by using neural networks
(Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010;
Mikolov et al., 2013). Unfortunately, unless they
are provided with large amounts of sense-annotated
data these corpus-based techniques cannot capture
polysemy in their representations, as they conflate
different meanings of a word into a single vector.
Therefore, most sense modeling techniques tend to
base their computation on the knowledge obtained
from various lexical resources. However, these tech-
niques mainly utilize the knowledge derived from
either WordNet (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002; Bu-
danitsky and Hirst, 2006; Pilehvar et al., 2013) or
Wikipedia (Medelyan et al., 2009; Mihalcea, 2007;
Dandala et al., 2013; Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2007; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), which are, re-
spectively, the most widely-used lexicographic and
encyclopedic resources in lexical semantics (Hovy
et al., 2013). This restriction to a single resource
brings about two main limitations: (1) the sense
modeling does not benefit from the complementary
knowledge of different resources, and (2) the ob-
tained representations are resource-specific and can-
not be used across settings.

In this paper we put forward a novel concept rep-
resentation technique, called NASARI, which ex-
ploits the knowledge available in both types of re-
source in order to obtain effective representations of
arbitrary concepts. The contributions of this paper
are threefold. First, we propose a novel technique

567



for rich semantic representation of arbitrary Word-
Net synsets or Wikipedia pages. Second, we provide
improvements over the conventional tf-idf weight-
ing scheme by applying lexical specificity (Lafon,
1980), a statistical measure mainly used for term
extraction, to the task of computing vector weights
in a vector representation. Third, we propose a
semantically-aware dimensionality reduction tech-
nique that transforms a lexical item’s representation
from a semantic space of words to one of Word-
Net synsets, simultaneously providing an implicit
disambiguation and a distribution smoothing. We
demonstrate that our representation achieves state-
of-the-art performance on two different tasks: (1)
word similarity on multiple standard datasets: MC-
30, RG-65, and WordSim-353 similarity, and (2)
Wikipedia sense clustering, in which our unsuper-
vised system surpasses the performance of a state-
of-the-art supervised technique that exploits knowl-
edge available in Wikipedia in several languages.

2 Semantic Representation of Concepts

Lexical resources and concepts. The gist of our
approach lies in its combination of knowledge from
two different lexical resources: (1) the expert-
based lexicographic WordNet, whose basic con-
stituents are synsets, i.e., concepts expressed by
sets of synonymous words (Miller et al., 1990),
and (2) the collaboratively-constructed encyclopedic
Wikipedia, whose articles can be considered as indi-
vidual concepts. Throughout the paper, by a concept
we mean a tuple b = (p, s) where p is a Wikipedia
page and s is the corresponding WordNet synset.
As a bridge between the two resources we use the
synset-to-article mappings provided by BabelNet1

(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), a high coverage mul-
tilingual encyclopedic dictionary and semantic net-
work that merges, among other resources, Wikipedia
and WordNet. Note that the concept b can also con-
tain a Wikipedia page or a WordNet synset only, if a
mapping is not provided by BabelNet.

Semantic representation: NASARI. Our concept
modeling approach consists of two phases. First,
for a given concept, we collect a set of relevant
Wikipedia pages by leveraging the structural infor-
mation in Wikipedia and WordNet (Section 2.1).

1http://www.babelnet.org/

Figure 1: The process of obtaining contextual informa-
tion for a WordNet synset or a Wikipedia article.

Then, we analyze the obtained contextual informa-
tion and construct two vector representations of the
concept (Section 2.2).

2.1 Collecting contextual information

Figure 1 illustrates the process of obtaining a set of
relevant Wikipedia pages Tb as contextual informa-
tion for a given concept b = (p, s). Let Lp be the
set containing p and all the Wikipedia pages hav-
ing an outgoing link to p, and Rs be the set con-
sisting of s and all other synsets that are in its di-
rect neighbourhood. We further enrich Rs by in-
cluding the coordinate synsets of s and the related
synsets from its disambiguated gloss2. Let B be a
function mapping each WordNet synset s′ to its cor-
responding Wikipedia page p, if such mapping ex-
ists in BabelNet, and to the empty set otherwise.
Hence, B(Rs) = ∪s′∈RsB(s′). Then, our con-
textual information is the set of Wikipedia pages
Tb = Lp ∪ B(Rs). In the case either p or s is not
present in the concept b, we take the contextual in-
formation as Tb = B(Rs) or Tb = Lp, respectively.

2.2 Vector construction

By processing the collected contextual information
Tb, NASARI represents the concept b as two vec-
tors in two semantic spaces: (1) word-based and (2)
synset-based. LetWb be the bag of words of all the
Wikipedia pages in Tb after lemmatization and stop-

word removal. We use lexical specificity in order to
extract the most representative words (Section 2.2.1)
and synsets (Section 2.2.2) ofWb.

Lexical specificity. Lexical specificity (Lafon,
1980) is a statistical measure that has been used
in a wide range of NLP applications, such as tex-
tual data analysis (Lebart et al., 1998), term ex-
traction (Drouin, 2003), and domain disambigua-
tion (Camacho Collados et al., 2014). However, to
our knowledge, it has never heretofore been used
to calculate weights in a vector-based representa-
tion (Turney and Pantel, 2010). Lexical specificity
is based on the hypergeometric distribution over
word frequencies. This statistical measure is partic-
ularly suitable for extracting an accurate set of rep-
resentative terms for a given subcorpus of a refer-
ence corpus (Lafon, 1980). Unlike the conventional
term frequency-inverse document frequency weight-
ing scheme (Jones, 1972, tf-idf ), lexical specificity
is not especially sensitive to different text lengths.

Assume a reference corpus of T words and a t-
words subcorpus of that corpus. The goal is to find
a set of terms that are peculiar to the subcorpus,
but not to the whole reference corpus. Formally,
given a word w that occurs f and k times in the
corpus and subcorpus, respectively, positive speci-
ficity computes the relevance of w to the subcorpus
as P (X ≥ k) if k ≥ ftT , where X is a random vari-
able following a hypergeometric distribution with
parameters f , t and T , and ftT is the expected value
of X . In our setting we are only interested in the pos-
itive specificity, i.e., the set of most relevant words
appearing in the contextual information. We ap-
ply the standard procedure of applying log10 and
then inverting the sign of the specificity probabili-
ties in order to re-scale them to the real line, which
is more easily interpretable (Drouin, 2003; Cama-
cho Collados et al., 2014). We only retain words
with specificity greater than two, which is equal to
−log10(0.01). This threshold leads to a set of repre-
sentative words that are relevant to the context with
a confidence of at least 99%, i.e., P (X ≥ k) ≤ 0.01
(Billami et al., 2014).

2.2.1 Word-based representation
This word-based representation models the con-

cept b in a conventional semantic space whose di-
mensions are individual words. We leverage lexical

specificity to compute a weighted set of most repre-
sentative words forWb with respect to the reference
corpus, i.e., the whole Wikipedia. As an example,
the obtained word-based vector for the edge of wa-
ter sense of shore has water, ocean, lake, beach and
sea among its most relevant dimensions.

2.2.2 Synset-based representation
Given that the amount of contextual informa-

tion gathered for a concept can be small, the re-
sulting word-based vector can be sparse and as a
consequence prone to noise, especially in the case
of less frequent concepts. Therefore, we put for-
ward a method that tackles the issue, providing rich
semantically-aware representations. To this end,
we group - and thereby generalize - similar dimen-
sions in the obtained word-based vector, to produce
a smaller vector in which dimensions are WordNet
synsets and weights are computed on the basis of the
combined information of the individual words in the
group. The generalization procedure can be summa-
rized in two main steps.

First, for each word w in Wb, we obtain from
WordNet the set Hw of all the direct hypernyms
of all the synsets containing w. For each synset
h ∈ Hw we check whether there exists another
word w′ from the contextual information that is a
hyponym of h, i.e., h ∈ Hw ∩ Hw′ . When such
is the case, letting Yh be the set of all words in the
hyponym synsets of h, we combine w, w′ and all
the other words in Yh into a single dimension repre-
sented by their common hypernym h. Thus for our
earlier example, the three words ocean, lake, and sea
are grouped into a single dimension represented by
their hypernym, i.e., the synset containing the body
of water sense of water (water2n in WordNet 3.0)

3.
Then, we compute the weight associated with the

new dimension by calculating the lexical specificity
of the word cluster. Formally, we calculate the lex-
ical specificity of h by setting the parameters k and
f as the total number of times the words in Yh occur
in Wb and the whole Wikipedia, respectively. The
values of t and T remain unchanged.

Our generalization procedure is similar to the di-
mensionality reduction that is performed using sin-
gular value decomposition in Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997, LSA). However,

3We denote the ith sense of word w with POS p as wip.

569



LSA is not applicable to our setting because, due
to the usage of lexical specificity, our vectors are
relatively small in size and different vectors usually
have few overlapping dimensions. Moreover, unlike
LSA, in which the size-reduced vectors have opaque
conflations of multiple words as their dimensions,
our new semantic space has human- and machine-
readable synsets as its dimensions. Our general-
ization procedure produces three advantages: (1) it
maps the vectors from a word-based semantic space
to a lower-dimensional space of synsets, (2) while
merging multiple words into a single synset an im-
plicit disambiguation of context words takes place,
providing better means for sense distinction, and
(3) the dimensionality reduction tackles the potential
noise and sparsity, resulting in smoother vectors.

3 NASARI for Semantic Similarity

So far we have explained how NASARI constructs
two types of representations, i.e., word-based and
synset-based, for arbitrary WordNet synsets and
Wikipedia pages. In this section we provide a
method that leverages NASARI representations for
effective measurement of concept and word simi-
larity. Semantic similarity between a pair of lexi-
cal items (e.g., words or concepts) lies at the core
of many applications in NLP and hence it has re-
ceived a considerable amount of research interest,
leading to a wide range of semantic similarity mea-
sures (Mohammad and Hirst, 2012).

3.1 Concept similarity

Given a pair of concepts, we first use the procedure
described in Section 2 to obtain for each concept
the two corresponding vector representations, i.e.,
word-based and synset-based. For each representa-
tion type, we then compute the similarity of the two
concepts by comparing their corresponding vectors.
This results in two similarity scores, one for each
representation type. The final similarity is computed
as the average of the two similarity scores. We use
Weighted Overlap for comparing vectors.

Weighted Overlap. Proposed by Pilehvar et al.
(2013), Weighted Overlap (WO) first sorts the el-
ements of each vector vi and then harmonically

weights the overlaps between the two vectors:

WO(v1, v2) =

∑
q∈O(r

q + r

q)
−1∑|O|

i=1(2i)−1
(1)

where O is the set of overlapping dimensions be-
tween the two vectors and rjq is the rank of dimen-
sion q in the vector vj . Given that our vectors are
significantly smaller than those in the original set-
ting of WO, the overlaps are also generally smaller
in size. Hence, we apply a square root operation
to the computed value in order to obtain a more
uniformly-distributed range of scores across the sim-
ilarity scale, i.e., [0, 1]. In our experiments we show
the advantage we gain by using WO in comparison
to the conventional cosine measure.

3.2 Word similarity

Algorithm 1 shows the procedure we devised for
measuring semantic similarity between two words.
There are three main steps:

1. Given a pair of words w1 and w2 the algorithm
first checks whether they are synonymous ac-
cording to our synonym set collection S. In
Section 3.2.1, we explain how we obtain this
set. If the words are defined as synonyms in S,

570



the algorithm returns the maximum similarity
score of one (lines 1-3).

2. If the words are not defined as synonyms, we
proceed by obtaining, for each word wi, its set
of possible senses (Cwi , lines 5-11). We accord-
ingly obtain the set of their respective NASARI
vector representations (Vi, lines 13-17), two
(word-based and synset-based) for each con-
cept in Cwi . Section 3.2.2 describes the concept
extraction process.

3. Finally, the algorithm returns the similarity
score Sim (line 19), calculated as the similarity
of the closest senses of w1 and w2. In our de-
fault setting, we linearly combine our two vec-
tor representations by averaging them (line 18).

3.2.1 Wiktionary synonyms S
Wiktionary is a rich collaboratively-constructed

lexical resource that provides a considerable amount
of multilingual lexical information for a large num-
ber of words. We use this resource in order to ob-
tain sets of synonymous words S. To this end, we
first extract all the pre-specified synonymy relations
in the English Wiktionary. This results in 17K sets
with an average size of 2.8 synonyms.

In order to enrich the set we introduce a method
that exploits the multilinguality of Wiktionary to
extract synonymous words. Our approach utilizes
translations of words in other languages as bridges
between synonymous words in English. Specifi-
cally, for each sense s of word w in Wiktionary, we
first get all the available translations. Assume that
the sense s of w translates into the word tl in lan-
guage l. If there is another word sense s′ of another
word w′ in Wiktionary that is also translated to tl in
language l, we hypothesize that w and w′ are syn-
onyms. In order to avoid ambiguity, as tl we only
consider words that are monosemous according to
language l.

This procedure results in around 9K additional
synonymous sets with an average size of 2.1. For in-
stance, the Finnish noun ammatti, which is monose-
mous according to Wiktionary, links seven English
words into a single set of synonyms: career, busi-
ness, profession, occupation, trade, calling, and vo-
cation. The final synonym set collection S contains
25K sets, each having, on average, 2.6 words.

3.2.2 Concept extraction
If the two input words w1 and w2 are not found in

the same synonym set in S , we proceed by obtain-
ing their sets of senses Cw1 and Cw2 , respectively.
Depending on the type of wi, we use two different
resources for obtaining Cwi : the WordNet sense in-
ventory and Wikipedia.

WordNet words. When the word wi is defined in
the WordNet sense inventory and is not a named
entity (line 6 in Algorithm 1), we set Cwi as all
the WordNet synsets that contain wi, i.e., Cwi =
{synset s ∈ WordNet : wi ∈ s}. We use Stan-
ford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005)
in our experiments.

WordNet OOV and named entities. For named
entities and words that do not exist in WordNet’s
vocabulary (OOV) we construct the set Cwi by ex-
ploiting Wikipedia’s piped links (line 10 in Algo-
rithm 1). To this end, we take as elements of Cwi
the Wikipedia pages of the hyperlinks which have
wi as their surface form, i.e., piped-links (wi). If
|Cwi | > 5, we prune Cwi to its top-5 pages in terms
of their number of ingoing links. Our choice of
Wikipedia as a source for named entities is due to
its higher coverage in comparison to WordNet.

4 Experiments

We evaluated NASARI on two different tasks that
require the computation of semantic similarity be-
tween words or concepts: word similarity (Section
4.1) and sense clustering (Section 4.2).

4.1 Word similarity
4.1.1 Datasets

We took as benchmark for our word similarity
experiments three standard datasets that are widely
used in the literature: RG-65 (Rubenstein and Good-
enough, 1965), MC-30 (Miller and Charles, 1991),
and WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002; Agirre
et al., 2009). WordSim-353 originally conflated
similarity and relatedness, leading to high similar-
ity scores for pairs such as computer-keyboard de-
spite the dissimilarity in their meanings. To correct
the conflation, Agirre et al. (2009) partitioned the
dataset into two subsets: relatedness and similarity.
Given that our similarity measure is targeted at se-
mantic similarity, we took the similarity subset of

571



WordSim-353 (WS-Sim) as test bed for our evalua-
tions. The subset comprises 203 word pairs.

4.1.2 Experimental setup
In this task, we assess the performance of dif-

ferent systems in terms of Pearson correlation. We
compare our system against six similarity measures
that have reported best performance on the three
datasets. Lin (Lin, 1998) and ADW (Pilehvar et al.,
2013) are WordNet-based approaches that leverage
the structural information of WordNet for the com-
putation of semantic similarity. Most similar to our
work are Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007, ESA), which represents a
word in a high-dimensional space of Wikipedia arti-
cles, and Salient Semantic Analysis (Hassan and Mi-
halcea, 2011, SSA), which leverages the linking of
concepts within Wikipedia articles for generating se-
mantic profiles of words. Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) and PMI-SVD are the best predictive and co-
occurrence models obtained by Baroni et al. (2014)
on a 2.8 billion-token corpus that also includes the
English Wikipedia.4 Word2Vec is based on neu-
ral network context prediction models (Mikolov et
al., 2013), whereas PMI-SVD is a traditional co-
occurrence based vector wherein weights are cal-
culated by means of Pointwise Mutual Information
(PMI) and the vector’s dimension is reduced to 500
by singular value decomposition (SVD). We use the
DKProSimilarity (Bär et al., 2013) implementation
of Lin and ESA in order to evaluate these measures
on the WS-Sim dataset.

4.1.3 Results
Table 1 shows the Pearson correlation of the dif-

ferent similarity measures on the three datasets con-
sidered. NASARI proves to be highly reliable on
the task of word similarity, providing state-of-the-
art performance on RG-65 and MC-30, and compet-
itive results on WS-Sim. Importantly, the improve-
ment we attain over measures that utilize as their
knowledge base either WordNet (i.e., ADW, Lin) or
Wikipedia (i.e., ESA and SSA) shows that our usage
of the complementary information of the two types
of resource has been helpful. We note that our Wik-
tionary module detects four additional synonymous
pairs (i.e., similarity = 1.0) in MC-30 (13%), eight in
RG-65 (12%), and thirteen in WS-Sim (6%) that are

not defined as synonyms in WordNet. We also ob-
tain competitive results according to the Spearman
correlation (a setting in which the absolute similarity
scores do not play a role and it is solely their ranking
that matters) on all the three datasets: MC-30 (0.89),
RG-65 (0.88), and WS-Sim (0.73).

WS-Sim is the only dataset on which we do not
report state-of-the-art performance. An analysis of
the outputs of our system on the WS-Sim dataset re-
vealed that there are pairs in this subset of WordSim-
353 that are not assigned proper scores according
to the similarity scale. Hill et al. (2014) had previ-
ously pointed out this deficiency of WS-Sim, mainly
due to its original relatedness-based scoring scale.
For instance, word pairs that are barely related (e.g.,
street-children) or antonyms (e.g., profit-loss and
smart-stupid) are assigned relatively high similar-
ity values (respectively, 4.9 for the former and 7.3
and 5.8 for the latter case, in the 0-10 scale). In
all these cases our system produces more appropri-
ate judgements according to the similarity scale. On
the other hand, there are highly similar pairs in the
dataset with relatively low gold scores. Examples in-
clude school-center5 and term-life6 with the respec-
tive gold similarity scores of 3.4 and 4.5, whereas

5School and center have a pair of highly similar senses in
WordNet 3.0: center3n: “a building dedicated to a particular
activity” and school2n: “a building where young people receive
education.”

6Term and life are in coordinate synsets (with time period as
their common hypernym) in WordNet 3.0.

annotated English datasets for sense clustering in

gual and multilingual systems of Dandala et al. (2013).

NASARI computes their similarities as 8.4 and 9.6.

4.2 Sense clustering
Our second set of experiments focuses on sense clus-
tering of the Wikipedia sense inventory. Wikipedia
can be considered as a sense inventory wherein the
different meanings of a word are denoted by the arti-
cles listed in its disambiguation page (Mihalcea and
Csomai, 2007). Given the high granularity of this
inventory, clustering of senses can be highly bene-
ficial to tasks that take this encyclopedic resource
as their sense inventory (Hovy et al., 2013), such as
Wikipedia-based Word Sense Disambiguation (Mi-
halcea, 2007; Dandala et al., 2013).

4.2.1 Datasets
For the sense clustering task, we take as our

benchmark the two datasets created by Dandala et
al. (2013). In these datasets, clustering has been
viewed as a binary classification problem in which
all possible pairings of senses of a word are anno-
tated whether they ought to be clustered or not. The
first dataset contains 500 pairs, 357 of which are
set to clustered and the remaining 143 to not clus-
tered. The second dataset, referred to as the Se-
mEval dataset, is based on a set of highly ambigu-
ous words taken from SemEval evaluations (Mihal-
cea, 2007) and consists of 925 pairs, 162 of which
are positively labeled, i.e., clustered.

4.2.2 Experimental setup
In this task we use the procedure explained in Sec-

tion 3.1 for measuring the similarity of concepts. A
pair of pages is set to belong to the same cluster
if their similarity exceeds the middle point in our
similarity scale, i.e., 0.5 in the scale of [0, 1]. We
compare our results with the state-of-the-art systems
of Dandala et al. (2013) that perform clustering by

exploiting the structure and content of an English
page (monolingual variant), or several pages in dif-
ferent languages (multilingual variant that uses En-
glish, German, Spanish and Italian pages). These
systems are essentially multi-feature Support Vec-
tor Machine classifiers that use an automatically-
labeled dataset for their training.

4.2.3 Results
Table 2 lists the results of NASARI as well as the

state-of-the-art systems of Dandala et al. (2013). We
also report the results for a baseline system that sets
all pairs as not clustered. As can be seen from the ta-
ble, our system proves to be highly robust and com-
petitive by outperforming, in an unsupervised set-
ting, the supervised monolingual and multilingual
systems of Dandala et al. (2013) on both datasets.
As regards the F1, we obtain 72.0% and 64.2% on
the 500-pair and SemEval datasets, respectively, a
measure that is not reported by Dandala et al. (2013).

4.3 Analysis

Recall from Section 2 that our system has two vec-
tor representations, for each of which we compute
vectors based on lexical specificity. We also men-
tioned in Section 3 that we opt for Weighted Overlap
as our vector comparison method. In order to ana-
lyze the impact of each of these elements, we carried
out a series of experiments with the conventional
logarithmically-scaled tf-idf weighting scheme and
the cosine vector comparison technique. For a word
w, we calculate the tf-idf by taking tf as the fre-
quency of w in the corresponding contextual infor-
mation, and idf = log(|D|/|{p ∈ D : w ∈ p}|),
where D is the set of all pages in Wikipedia.

Table 3 shows the performance of the NASARI-
based similarity system and its individual vector
representations for different weight computation
schemes, i.e., lexical specificity and tf-idf, and for
different vector comparison techniques, i.e., cosine
and WO, on word similarity and sense clustering
datasets. As can be seen from the Table, the perfor-
mance of the word-based representation consistently
improves on both tasks when combined with the ad-
ditional information from the synset-based vectors,
demonstrating that the sense distinctions offered by
the generalization process have been beneficial.

Between the two vector comparison methods,
WO proves to better suit our specificity-based vec-

tors by outperforming cosine in most cases. The
reason behind the lower performance of WO for the
synset-based vectors on the task of sense clustering
can be explained by the nature of the corresponding
datasets. Since the synset-based vectors and their
overlapping dimensions are small, their cosine sim-
ilarity scores also tend to be relatively low, unlike
WO whose range of values is not affected by the
number of overlapping dimensions. Given that in
the experiments the threshold is fixed to the mid-
dle point of the scale (cf. Section 4.2.2), gener-
ally low similarity values lead to a high-precision,
low-recall system, which is rewarded by higher ac-
curacy performance in datasets in which a large por-
tion of instances are negative. In fact, for the synset-
based vector representation weighted using speci-
ficity, the F1 performance of the cosine is signifi-
cantly lower than WO. On the SemEval dataset the
F1 performance of WO is 60.1%, whereas cosine at-
tains 37.1%. Similarly, on the 500-pair dataset, WO
leads cosine by 16.8%: 68.5% vs. 51.7%.

As far as the weighting scheme is concerned, lex-
ical specificity outperforms tf-idf on both tasks, ir-
respective of the vector comparison technique and
representation. We attribute the better performance
of lexical specificity to the probabilistic nature of

weights in its vectors. The tf-idf weighting scheme,
in contrast, suffers from insensitivity to the relative
size of the contextual information. Thus, subse-
quently, specificity-based vectors provide the advan-
tage of accurately reducing the vectors’ dimension,
unlike the tf-idf scheme in which the size-insensitive
weights are not comparable across vectors. As a re-
sult, the specificity-based vectors are substantially
smaller in size, bringing about better space utiliza-
tion and faster running time. In our experiments the
vectors obtained by using lexical specificity were,
on average, almost nine times (2505 vs. 21825) and
four times (335 vs. 1311) smaller than the tf-idf -
based vectors for the word-based and synset-based
vector representations, respectively.

We were also interested in verifying the advantage
gained by combining the complementary knowledge
of Wikipedia and WordNet. To this end, we carried
out an experiment in which NASARI uses Wikipedia
as its only knowledge source (i.e., without using
WordNet). The last row in the Table (highlighted
by †) shows the results for this setting. Note that
since WordNet is not used in this setting, we are
constrained to the word-based vector representation
only. The results show that the combination of the
types of resource leads to a consistent performance

improvement across tasks and datasets, with the av-
erage improvement being 5%.

5 Related Work

Given that in this work we focused mainly on simi-
larity for the evaluation of our semantic representa-
tion, in addition to concept representation, we also
briefly discuss related works for semantic similarity.

Concept representation. Distributional semantic
models are usually the first choice for represent-
ing textual items such as words or sentences (Tur-
ney and Pantel, 2010). These models have attracted
considerable research interest, resulting in various
co-occurrence based representations (Salton et al.,
1975; Evert, 2005; Pado and Lapata, 2007; Erk
and Padó, 2008) or predictive models (Collobert and
Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Mikolov et al.,
2013; Baroni et al., 2014). Although there have
been approaches proposed in the literature for learn-
ing sense-specific embeddings (Weston et al., 2013;
Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2014), their
coverage is limited only to those senses that are cov-
ered in the underlying corpus. Moreover, the ob-
tained sense representations are usually not linked
to any sense inventory, and therefore such linking
has to be carried out, either manually, or with the
help of sense-annotated data. Hence, unless they
are provided with large amounts of sense-annotated
data, these techniques cannot furnish an effective
representation of word senses in an existing standard
sense inventory.

Consequently, most sense modeling techniques
have based their representation on the knowledge
derived from resources such as WordNet (Mihal-
cea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Lopez, 2003;
Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004; Pilehvar et al., 2013),
or Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;
Mihalcea, 2007). None of these techniques, how-
ever, combine knowledge from multiple types of
resource, making their representations resource-
specific and also prone to sparsity. In contrast,
our method is based on the complementary knowl-
edge of two different resources and their interlink-
ing, leading to richer semantic representations that
are also applicable across resources. Most similar
to our combination of complementary knowledge is
the work of Franco-Salvador et al. (2014) for cross-
lingual document retrieval.

Concept similarity. Concept similarity tech-
niques are mainly limited to the knowledge that
their underlying lexical resources provide. For
instance, methods designed for measuring semantic
similarity of WordNet synsets (Banerjee and Peder-
sen, 2002; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Pilehvar et
al., 2013) usually leverage lexicographic or struc-
tural information in this lexical resource. Similarly,
Wikipedia-based approaches (Hassan and Mihalcea,
2011; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Milne and Witten,
2008) do not usually benefit from the expert-based
lexico-semantic knowledge provided in WordNet.
In contrast, our approach combines knowledge from
both resources, providing two advantages: (1) more
effective measurement of similarity based on rich
semantic representations, and (2) the possibility of
measuring cross-resource semantic similarity, i.e.,
between Wikipedia pages and WordNet synsets.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a novel semantic
approach, called NASARI, for effective vector
representation of arbitrary WordNet synsets and
Wikipedia pages. The strength of our approach
lies in its combination of complementary knowl-
edge from different types of resource, while at the
same time it also benefits from an effective vec-
tor representation with two novel features: lexi-
cal specificity for the calculation of vector weights
and a semantically-aware dimensionality reduc-
tion. NASARI attains state-of-the-art performance
on multiple standard benchmarks in word similarity
as well as Wikipedia sense clustering. We release
the representations obtained for all the Wikipedia
pages and WordNet synsets in http://lcl.uniroma1.it/
nasari/. As future work we plan to integrate NASARI
into BabelNet and apply our representation to a mul-
tilingual setting, enabling the comparison of pairs of
concepts across languages. We also intend to use
our approach on the task of multilingual Word Sense
Disambiguation.
