Abstract 

This paper presents a mixed deterministic 
model for coreference resolution in the 
CoNLL-2012 shared task. We separate the 
two main stages of our model, mention 
detection and coreference resolution, into 
several sub-tasks which are solved by 
machine learning method and  
deterministic rules based on multi-filters, 
such as lexical, syntactic, semantic, gender 
and number information. We participate in 
the closed track for English and Chinese, 
and also submit an open result for Chinese 
using tools to generate the required features. 
Finally, we reach the average F1 scores 
58.68, 60.69 and 61.02 on the English 
closed task, Chinese closed and open tasks.  

1 Introduction 
The coreference resolution task is a complicated 
and challenging issue of natural language 
processing. Although many sub-problems, such as 
noun phrase to noun phrase and pronouns to noun 
phrase, are contained in this issue, it is interesting 
that humans do not get too confused when they 
determine whether two mentions refer to the same 
entity. We also believe that automatic systems 
should copy the human behavior (Kai-Wei et al., 
2011). In our understanding, the basis for human 
making judgment on different sub-problems is 
different and limited. Although there are some 
complicated and ambiguous cases in this task, and 

we are not able to cover all the prior knowledge of 
human mind, which plays a vital role in his 
solution, the mixed deterministic model we 
constructed can solve a big part of this task. We 
present a mixed deterministic model for 
coreference resolution in the CoNLL-2012 shared 
task (Sameer et al., 2011). 

Different methods such as Relaxation labeling 
(Emili et al., 2011), Best-Link (Kai-Wei et al., 
2011), Entropy Guided Transformation Learning 
(Cicero et al., 2011) and deterministic models 
(Heeyoung et al., 2011), were attempted in the 
CoNLL-2011 shared task (Sameer et al., 2011). 
The system performance reported by the task 
shows that a big part of this task has been solved 
but some sub-problems need more exploration. 

We also participate in the Chinese closed and 
open tracks. However, the lack of linguistic 
annotations makes it more difficult to build a 
deterministic model. Basic solutions such as Hobbs 
Algorithm and Center Theory have been listed in 
(Wang et al., 2002; Jun et al., 2007). The recent 
research on Chinese contains non-anaphors 
detection using a composite kernel (Kong Fang, et 
al., 2012(a)) and a tree kernel method to anaphora 
resolution of pronouns (Kong Fang et al., 2012(b)). 

We accept the thought of Stanford (Karthik et al., 
2010; Heeyoung et al., 2011). In Stanford system 
the coreference resolution task is divided into 
several problems and each problem is solved by 
rule based methods. For English we did some 
research on mention detection which uses Decision 
Tree to decide whether the mention ‘it’ should 
refer to some other mention. For Chinese we 
submit closed and open result. The lack of gender, 

76



number and name entities make it more difficult 
for the Chinese closed task and we try to extract 
information from the training data to help enhance 
the performance. For the open task, we use some 
dictionaries such as appellation dictionary, gender 
dictionary, geographical name dictionary and 
temporal word dictionary (Bo et al., 2009), and 
some tools such as conversion of pinyin-to-
character and LTP which is a Chinese parser that 
can generate the features such as Part-of-Speech, 
Parse bit, Named Entities (Liu et al., 2011) to 
generate the similar information. 

We describe the system architecture in section 2. 
Section 3 illustrates the mention detection process. 
Section 4 describes the core process of coreference 
resolution. In section 5, we show the results and 
discussion of several experiments. Finally, we give 
the conclusion of our work in section 6.  

2 System Architecture 
Our system mainly contains mention detection and 
coreference resolution. Recall is the determining 
factor in mention detection stage. The reason is 
that if some mention is missed in this stage, the 
coreference resolution part will miss the chains 
which contain this mention. Yet some mentions 
still need to be distinguished because in some cases 
they refer to no entity. For example ‘it’, in the 
sentence ‘it + be + weather/ time’, ‘it’ should refer 
to no entity. But the ‘it’ in the phrase ‘give it to 
me’ might refer to some entity. The coreference 
resolution module of our system follows the idea 
of Stanford. In the English task we did some more 
exploration on mention detection, pronoun 
coreference and partial match of noun phrases. The 
Chinese task is more complicated and because 
gender, number and name entities are not provided, 
the feature generation from the training data has to 
be added before the coreference resolution process. 
Some Chinese idiomatic usages are also considered 
in this stage.  

3 Mention detection  
All the NPs, pronouns and the phrases which are 
indexed as named entities are selected as 
candidates. NPs are extracted from the parse tree. 
Yet some mentions do not refer to any entity in 
some cases. In our system we attempt to 
distinguish these mentions in this stage. The reason 
is that the deterministic rules in coreference 

resolution part are not complete to distinguish 
these mentions. The methods below can also be 
added to the coreference resolution part as a pre-
processing. For the conveniences of system design, 
we finish this work in this stage. 

For English, the pronoun ‘it’ and NPs ‘this, that, 
those and these’ need to be distinguished. We take 
‘it’ as an example to illustrate the process. First we 
use regular expressions to select ‘it’, which refers 
to no entity, such as ‘it + be + weather/ time’, ‘it 
happened that’ and ‘it makes (made) sense that’.  
Second we use Decision Tree (C4.5) to classify the 
two kinds of ‘it’ based on the training data. The 
features contain the Part-of-Speech, Parse bit, 
Predicate Arguments of ‘it’, the word before and 
after ‘it’. The number of total ‘it’ is 9697 and 4043 
of them have an entity to refer to in the training 
data.

Table 1: Results of ‘it’ classification using C4.5 
 

Table 1 shows the classification result of ‘it’ in 
the development data v4. The number of total ‘it’ 
is 1401 and 809 of them have an entity to refer to. 
The result is not perfect but can help enhance the 
performance of coreference resolution. However, 
the results of ‘this, that, those and these’ are not 
acceptable and we skip over these words. We did 
not do any process on ‘verb’ mention detection and 
coreference resolution. 

In addition, we divide mentions into groups in 
which they are nested in position. And for 
mentions which have the same head word in one 
group, only the mentions with the longest span 
should be left (for the English task and a set of 
Chinese articles). For some Chinese articles of 
which names contain ‘chtb’, both in the training 
data and the development data, the nest is 
permitted based on the statistic results.  

For Chinese we also attempt to train a model for 
pronouns ‘你’(you) and ‘那’(that). However, the 
results are not acceptable either since the features 
we select are not enough for the classifier. 

After the mentions have been extracted, the 
related features of each mention are also extracted. 
We transform the ‘conll’ document into mention 

77



document. Each mention has basic features such as 
position, part-of-speech, parse tree, head word, 
speaker, Arguments, and the gender and number of 
head word. The head word feature is very 
important and regular expression can almost 
accomplish the process but not perfectly. Firstly, 
we extract the key NPs of a mention based on 
parse feature. Then the regular expressions are to 
extract the head word. For example, the mention: 

 (NP (DNP (LCP (NP (NP (NR 中国)) (NP (NN 大地))) 
(LC 上)) (DEG 的)) (NP (NR 二战)) (NP (NN 标志))) (NP 
(DNP (LCP (NP (NP (NR 中国)) (NP (NN 大地))) (LC 上)) 
(DEG 的)) (NP (NR 二战)) (NP (NN 标志)))  

The key NPs of this mention is: 
(NP (NR 二战)) (NP (NN 标志)) .The head word of 

this mention is: NN 标志 
However, there are still some cases that need to 

be discussed. For example, the head word of ‘the 
leader of people’ should be ‘leader’, while the head 
word of ‘the city of Beijing’ should be ‘city’ and 
‘Beijing’ for the mentions of ‘the city’ and 
‘Beijing’ both have the same meaning with ‘the 
city of Beijing’. Finally, we only found the words 
of ‘city’ and ‘country’ should be processed. 

4 Coreference resolution  
The deterministic rules are the core methods to 
solve the coreference resolution task. All the 
mentions in the same part can be seen as a list. The 
mentions which refer to the same entity will be 
clustered based on the deterministic rules. After all 
the clusters have generated, the merge program 
will merge the clusters into chains based on the 
position information. The mentions in one chain 
cannot be reduplicative in position. Basically the 
nested mentions are not allowed. 

The process contains two parts NP-NP and NP-
pronoun. Each part has several sub-problems to be 
discussed. First, the same process of English task 
and Chinese task will be illustrated. Then the 
different parts will be discussed separately. 

4.1 NP-NP 
Exact match: the condition of exact match is the 

two NP mentions which have no other larger 
parent mentions in position are coreferential if they 
are exactly the same. The stop words such as ‘a’, 
‘the’, ‘this’ and ‘that’ have been removed.  

Partial match: there are two conditions for 
partial match which are the two mentions have the 

same head word and one of them is a part of the 
other in form simultaneously.  

Alias and abbreviation: some mentions have 
alias or abbreviation. For example the mentions 
‘USA’ and ‘America’ should refer to the mention 
‘the United States’. 

Similar match:  there are three forms of this 
match. The first one is all the modifiers of two NPs 
are same and the head words are similar based on 
WordNet1 which is provided for the English closed 
task. We only use the English synonym sets of the 
WordNet to solve the first form. The second one is 
the head words are same and the modifiers are not 
conflicted. The third form is that the head words 
and modifiers are all different. The result of similar 
match may be reduplicative with that of exact 
match and partial match. This would be eliminated 
by the merge process. 

4.2 Pronoun - NP 
There are seven categories of pronoun to NP in our 
system. For English second person, it is difficult to 
distinguish the plural form from singular form and 
we put them in one deterministic rule. For each 
kind of pronouns shown below, the first cluster is 
the English form and the second cluster is the 
Chinese form.  
First Person (singular) = {'I', 'my', 'me', 'mine', 
'myself'}{‘我’} 
Second Person= {'you', 'your', 'yours', 'yourself', 
'yourselves'}{‘你’， ‘你们’} 
Third Person (male) = {'he', 'him', 'his', 
'himself'}{‘他’} 
Third Person (female) = {'she', 'her', 'hers', 
'herself'}{‘她’} 
Third Person (object) = {'it', 'its', 'itself'}{‘它’} 
First Person (plural) = {'we', 'us', 'our', 'ours', 
'ourselves'}{‘我们’} 
Third Person (plural) = {'they', 'them', 'their', 
'theirs', 'themselves'}{‘他们’， ‘她们’，‘它们’} 

In the Chinese task the possessive form of 
pronoun is not considered. For example, the 
mention ‘我们  的 ’(our) is a DNP in the parse 
feature and it contains two words ‘我们’ and ‘的’. 
We only selected the NP ‘我们’as a mention. The 
reflexive pronouns are composed by two words 
which are the pronoun itself and the word ‘自己’.

For example, the mention ‘我  自己’(myself) is 
processed as ‘我’(I or me).  

Gender, number and distance between pronoun 
and NP are the most important features for this part 
(Shane et al., 2006). We only allow pronoun to 
find NPs at first. We find out the first mention of 
which all the features are satisfied ahead of the 
pronoun. If there is no matching mention, search 
backward from the pronoun. For the first person 
and second person, we merged all the pronouns 
with the same form and the same speaker. If the 
context is a conversation of two speakers, the 
second person of a speaker should refer to the first 
person of the other speaker. The scene of multi-
speakers conversation is too difficult to be solved. 

In the Chinese task there are some other 
pronouns. The pronoun ‘双方’(both sides) should 
refer to a plural mention which contain ‘和’(and) 
in the middle. The pronoun ‘ 其 ’ has similar 
meaning of third person and refers to the largest 
NP mention before it. The pronouns ‘这 ’(this), 
‘那 ’(that), ‘这里 ’(here), ‘那里 ’(there) are not 
processed for we did not find a good solution.  

However in some cases the provided gender and 
number are not correct or missing and we had to 
label these mentions based on the appellation 
words of the training data. For example, if the 
appellation word of a person is ‘Mr.’ or ‘sir’, the 
gender should be male.  

4.3 Chinese closed task  
For the Chinese closed task NE, the gender and 
number are not provided. We used regular patterns 
to generate these features from the training data. 

In the NE (named entities) feature ‘PERSON’ is 
a very important category because most pronouns 
will refer to the person entity. To extract 
‘PERSON’, we build a PERSON dictionary which 
contains all the PERSON mentions in training data, 
such as ‘先生’(Mr.) and ‘教授’(Professor).  If the 
same mention appears in the test data, we believe it 
is a person entity. However, the PERSON 
dictionary cannot cover all the PERSON mentions. 
The appellation words are extracted before or after 
the person entity. When some appellation word 
appears in the test data, the NP mention before or 
after the appellation word should be a person entity, 
if they compose a larger NP mention.  

The Gender feature was generated at the same 
time of the ‘PERSON’ generation. We separate the 

‘PERSON’ dictionary and appellation dictionary 
into male cluster and female cluster by the 
pronouns in the same chain.  

The generation of number feature is a little 
complicated. Since the Chinese word does not have 
plural form, the numerals and the quantifiers of the 
mention are the main basis to extract the number 
feature. We extract the numerals and the 
quantifiers from the training data and built regular 
expressions for determine the number feature of a 
mention in test data. Other determinative rules for 
number feature extraction are shown below: 

If the word ‘们’ appears in a mention tail, this 
mention is plural. For example ‘同学’(student) is 
singular and ‘同学们’(students) is plural. 

If the word ‘和’(and) appears in the middle of a 
mention A, and the two parts separated by ‘和’ are 
sub-mentions of A,  mention A should be plural. 
Other words which have the similar meaning of 
‘和’, such as ‘同’, ‘与’ and ‘跟’, are considered.  

The time and date coreference resolution is also 
considered. The NP mentions which contain 
temporal words are processed separately since 
these categories of name entity are not provided. 
These temporal words are also extracted from 
training data. Since the head words of these 
mentions are themselves, the two time or date 
mentions are coreferential if they are the same or 
one must be a part of the other’s tail. For example 
‘今年九月’(this September) and ‘九月’(September) 
which are not nested should be coreferential. 

4.4 Chinese open task 
For the Chinese open task we use several tools to 
generate features we need. 

NE generation: LTP is a Chinese parser that can 
generate the features such as Part-of-Speech, Parse 
bit, Named Entities (Liu et al., 2011). We only use 
LTP for the NE generation. However, the NE 
labels of LTP are different with that provided by 
the gold training data and need to be transformed. 
The difference of word segmentation between LTP 
and the provided data also made some errors. At 
last we find the NE feature from LTP does not 
perform well and it will be discussed in section 5. 

The conversion of pinyin-to-character is also 
used in the Chinese open task. The speaker 
provided in the training data is given in pinyin 
form. The speaker might be the ‘PERSON’ 
mention in the context. When we determine the 

79



pronoun coreference, we need to know whether the 
speaker and the ‘PERSON’ mention are same.  

Other tools used in open task contain appellation 
dictionary, gender dictionary, geographical name 
dictionary and temporal word dictionary (Bo et al., 
2009). These dictionaries are more complete than 
those used in the closed task, although the 
enhancements are also limited. 

5 Results and Discussion  
Table 2 to table 4 show the results of English 
coreference resolution on the gold and auto 
development and the test data. The results of the 
auto development data and the test data are close 
and lower than that of the gold data. Since the 
deterministic rules can not cover all the cases, 
there is still an improvement if we could make the 
deterministic rules more complete.

on F1 of coreference resolution. It means the 
Chinese results are also partly affected by the parse 
feature. In fact we attempted to revise the parse 
feature of the auto development data using regular 
expressions. Yet the complicacy and unacceptable 
results made us abandon that.

The results of the open Chinese performance on 
the gold and auto development and the test data are 
shown in table 8 to table 10. The performance is 
similar with that of the closed task. However, the 
improvement between F1 of the open task and F1 
of the closed task is limited. We also get the F1 of 
the closed and open test results using gold parser 
which are 66.46 and 66.38. The open result is even 

80



lower. This can be explained. The performance 
enhanced by the dictionaries we used for the open 
task are limited because the open dictionaries 
information which appears in the test data is not 
much more than that of the closed dictionaries 
which generated from the training data, although 
the total information of the former is much larger.  
The named entities generated by LTP have some 
errors such as person identification errors and will 
caused coreferential errors in Pronoun-NP stage. 
For the time we did not use LTP well and some 
other open tools such as Wikipedia and Baidu 
Baike should be applied in the open task.

space to enhance in the coreference resolution 
stage. The recall of mention detection of gold-

6 Conclusion 
In this paper we described a mixed deterministic 
model for coreference resolution of English and 
Chinese. We start the mention detection from 
extracting candidates based on the parse feature. 
The pre-processing which contains static rules and 
decision tree is applied to remove the defective 
candidates. In the coreference resolution stage the 
task is divided into several sub-problems and for 
each sub-problem the deterministic rules are 
constructed based on limited features. For the 
Chinese closed task we use regular patterns to 
generate named entities, gender and number from 
the training data. Several tools and dictionaries are 
applied for the Chinese open task. The result is not 
as good as we supposed since the feature errors 
caused by these tools also made the coreferential 
errors.  

However, a deeper error analysis is needed in 
the construction of deterministic rules. The feature 
of the predicate arguments is not used well. 
Although the open performance of the Chinese 
task is not good, we still believe that complete and 
accurate prior knowledge can help solve the task.
