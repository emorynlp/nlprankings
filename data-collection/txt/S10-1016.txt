1 Introduction 
There are seven cases of grapheme to phoneme in 
a text to speech  system (Yarowsky, 1997). Among 
them, the most difficult task is disambiguating the 
homograph word, which has the same POS but 
different pronunciation. In this case, different pro-
nunciations of the same word always correspond to 
different word senses. Once the word senses are 
disambiguated, the problem of GTP is resolved. 

There is a little different from traditional WSD, 
in this task two or more senses may correspond to 
one pronunciation. That is, the sense granularity is 
coarser than WSD. For example, the preposition 
“为”  has three senses: sense1 and sense2 have the 
same pronunciation {wei 4}, while sense3 corre-
sponds to {wei 2}. In this task, to the target word, 
not only the pronunciations but also the sense la-
bels are provided for training; but for test, only the 
pronunciations are evaluated. The challenge of this 
task is the much skewed distribution in real text: 
the most frequent pronunciation occupies usually 
over 80%. 

In this task, we will provide a large volume of 
training data (each homograph word has at least 
300 instances) accordance with the truly distribu-
tion in real text. In the test data, we will provide at 
least 100 instances for each target word. The 
senses distribution in test data is the same as in 
training data.All instances come from People Daily 
newspaper (the most popular newspaper in Manda-
rin). Double blind annotations are executed manu-
ally, and a third annotator checks the annotation. 

2 Participating Systems 
Two kinds of precisions are evaluated. One is 

micro-average:

N is the number of all target word-types. mi is 
the number of labeled correctly to one specific tar-
get word-type and ni is the number of all test in-
stances for this word-type. The other is macro-
average:

There are two teams participated in and submit-

ted nine systems. Table 1 shows the results, all sys-
tems are better than baseline (Baseline is using the 
most frequent sense to tag all the tokens).
