Abstract
In cross-lingual transfer, NLP models over one
or more source languages are applied to a low-
resource target language. While most prior
work has used a single source model or a
few carefully selected models, here we con-
sider a “massive” setting with many such mod-
els. This setting raises the problem of poor
transfer, particularly from distant languages.
We propose two techniques for modulating
the transfer, suitable for zero-shot or few-shot
learning, respectively. Evaluating on named
entity recognition, we show that our tech-
niques are much more effective than strong
baselines, including standard ensembling, and
our unsupervised method rivals oracle selec-
tion of the single best individual model.1

1 Introduction

Supervised learning remains king in natural lan-
guage processing, with most tasks requiring large
quantities of annotated corpora. The majority of
the world’s 6,000+ languages however have lim-
ited or no annotated text, and therefore much
of the progress in NLP has yet to be realised
widely. Cross-lingual transfer learning is a tech-
nique which can compensate for the dearth of
data, by transferring knowledge from high- to low-
resource languages, which has typically taken the
form of annotation projection over parallel corpora
or other multilingual resources (Yarowsky et al.,
2001; Hwa et al., 2005), or making use of trans-
ferable representations, such as phonetic transcrip-
tions (Bharadwaj et al., 2016), closely related lan-
guages (Cotterell and Duh, 2017) or bilingual dic-
tionaries (Mayhew et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018).

Most methods proposed for cross-lingual trans-
fer rely on a single source language, which lim-
its the transferable knowledge to only one source.

∗Both authors contributed equally to this work.

The target language might be similar to many
source languages, on the grounds of the script,
word order, loan words etc, and transfer would
benefit from these diverse sources of information.
There are a few exceptions, which use transfer
from several languages, ranging from multitask
learning (Duong et al., 2015; Ammar et al., 2016;
Fang and Cohn, 2017), and annotation projection
from several languages (Täckström, 2012; Fang
and Cohn, 2016; Plank and Agić, 2018). How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, none of these
approaches adequately account for the quality of
transfer, but rather “weight” the contribution of
each language uniformly.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for
zero-shot multilingual transfer, inspired by re-
search in truth inference in crowd-sourcing, a re-
lated problem, in which the ‘ground truth’ must be
inferred from the outputs of several unreliable an-
notators (Dawid and Skene, 1979). In this prob-
lem, the best approaches estimate each model’s
reliability, and their patterns of mistakes (Kim
and Ghahramani, 2012). Our proposed model
adapts these ideas to a multilingual transfer set-
ting, whereby we learn the quality of transfer, and
language-specific transfer errors, in order to infer
the best labelling in the target language, as part of
a Bayesian graphical model. The key insight is
that while the majority of poor models make lots
of mistakes, these mistakes are diverse, while the
few good models consistently provide reliable in-
put. This allows the model to infer which are the
reliable models in an unsupervised manner, i.e.,
without explicit supervision in the target language,
and thereby make accurate inferences despite the
substantial noise.

In the paper, we also consider a supervised set-
ting, where a tiny annotated corpus is available in
the target language. We present two methods to
use this data: 1) estimate reliability parameters of

the Bayesian model, and 2) explicit model selec-
tion and fine-tuning of a low-resource supervised
model, thus allowing for more accurate modelling
of language specific parameters, such as charac-
ter embeddings, shown to be important in previous
work (Xie et al., 2018).

Experimenting on two NER corpora, one with
as many as 41 languages, we show that single
model transfer has highly variable performance,
and uniform ensembling often substantially under-
performs the single best model. In contrast, our
zero-shot approach does much better, exceeding
the performance of the single best model, and our
few-shot supervised models result in further gains.

2 Approach

We frame the problem of multilingual transfer
as follows. We assume a collection of H mod-
els, all trained in a high resource setting, denoted
Mh = {Mhi , i ∈ (1, H)}. Each of these mod-
els are not well matched to our target data setting,
for instance these may be trained on data from dif-
ferent domains, or on different languages, as we
evaluate in our experiments, where we use cross-
lingual embeddings for model transfer. This is a
problem of transfer learning, namely, how best we
can use the H models for best results in the target
language.2

Simple approaches in this setting include a)
choosing a single model M ∈ Mh, on the
grounds of practicality, or the similarity between
the model’s native data condition and the target,
and this model is used to label the target data; or
b) allowing all models to ‘vote’ in an classifier en-
semble, such that the most frequent outcome is
selected as the ensemble output. Unfortunately
neither of these approaches are very accurate in
a cross-lingual transfer setting, as we show in §4,
where we show a fixed source language model
(en) dramatically underperforms compared to or-
acle selection of source language, and the same is
true for uniform voting.

Motivated by these findings, we propose novel
methods for learning. For the “zero-shot” setting
where no labelled data is available in the target,
we propose the BEAuns method inspired by work

2We limit our attention to transfer in a ‘black-box’ setting,
that is, given predictive models, but not assuming access to
their data, nor their implementation. This is the most flexible
scenario, as it allows for application to settings with closed
APIs, and private datasets. It does, however, preclude multi-
task learning, as the source models are assumed to be static.

in truth inference from crowd-sourced datasets or
diverse classifiers (§2.1). To handle the “few-shot”
case §2.2 presents a rival supervised technique,
RaRe, based on using very limited annotations in
the target language for model selection and classi-
fier fine-tuning.

2.1 Zero-Shot Transfer

One way to improve the performance of the en-
semble system is to select a subset of compo-
nent models carefully, or more generally, learn a
non-uniform weighting function. Some models do
much better than others, on their own, so it stands
to reason that identifying these handful of mod-
els will give rise to better ensemble performance.
How might we proceed to learn the relative qual-
ity of models in the setting where no annotations
are available in the target language? This is a clas-
sic unsupervised inference problem, for which we
propose a probabilistic graphical model, inspired
by Kim and Ghahramani (2012).

We develop a generative model, illustrated in
Figure 1, of the transfer models’ predictions, yij ,
where i ∈ [1, N ] is an instance (a token or an
entity span), and j ∈ [1, H] indexes a trans-
fer model. The generative process assumes a
‘true’ label, zi ∈ [1,K], which is corrupted
by each transfer model, in producing the predic-
tion, yij . The corruption process is described
by P (yij = l|zi = k, V (j)) = V (j)kl , where V

(j) ∈
RK×K is the confusion matrix specific to a trans-
fer model.

To complete the story, the confusion matri-
ces are drawn from vague row-wise independent
Dirichlet priors, with a parameter α = 1, and the
true labels are governed by a Dirichlet prior, π,
which is drawn from an uninformative Dirichlet
distribution with a parameter β = 1. This genera-
tive model is referred to as BEA.

Inference under the BEA model involves ex-



153

plaining the observed predictions Y in the most
efficient way. Where several transfer models have
identical predictions, k, on an instance, this can be
explained by letting zi = k,3 and the confusion
matrices of those transfer models assigning high
probability to V (j)kk . Other, less reliable, transfer
models will have divergent predictions, which are
less likely to be in agreement, or else are heav-
ily biased towards a particular class. Accordingly,
the BEAmodel can better explain these predictions
through label confusion, using the off-diagonal el-
ements of the confusion matrix. Aggregated over
a corpus of instances, the BEA model can learn to
differentiate between those reliable transfer mod-
els, with high V (j)kk and those less reliable ones,
with high V (j)kl , l 6= k. This procedure applies per-
label, and thus the ‘reliability’ of a transfer model
is with respect to a specific label, and may differ
between classes. This helps in the NER setting
where many poor transfer models have excellent
accuracy for the outside label, but considerably
worse performance for entity labels.

For inference, we use mean-field variational
Bayes (Jordan, 1998), which learns a variational
distribution, q(Z, V, π) to optimise the evidence
lower bound (ELBO),

logP (Y |α, β) ≥ Eq(Z,V,π) log
P (Y,Z, V, π|α, β)

q(Z, V, π)

assuming a fully factorised variational distribu-
tion, q(Z, V, π) = q(Z)q(V )q(π). This gives
rise to an iterative learning algorithm with update
rules:

logarithmic derivative of the gamma function. The
sets of rules (1) and (2) are applied alternately, to
update the values of Eq log πk, Eq log V

(j)
kl , and

q(zij = k) respectively. This repeats until conver-
gence, when the difference in the ELBO between
two iterations is smaller than a threshold.

The final prediction of the model is based
on q(Z), using the maximum a posteriori label
ẑi = argmaxz q(zi = z). This method is referred
to as BEAuns.

In our NER transfer task, classifiers are diverse
in their F1 scores ranging from almost 0 to around
80, motivating spammer removal (Raykar and Yu,
2012) to filter out the worst of the transfer models.
We adopt a simple strategy that first estimates the
confusion matrices for all transfer models on all
labels, then ranks them based on their mean recall
on different entity categories (elements on the di-
agonals of their confusion matrices), and then runs
the BEA model again using only labels from the
top k transfer models only. We call this method
BEAuns×2 and its results are reported in §4.

2.1.1 Token versus Entity Granularity
Our proposed aggregation method in §2.1 is based
on an assumption that the true annotations are in-
dependent from each other, which simplifies the
model but may generate undesired results. That
is, entities predicted by different transfer models
could be mixed, resulting in labels inconsistent
with the BIO scheme. Table 1 shows an exam-
ple, where a sentence with 4 words is annotated
by 5 transfer models with 4 different predictions,
among which at most one is correct as they over-
lap. However, the aggregated result in the token
view is a mixture of two predictions, which is sup-
ported by no transfer models.

To deal with this problem, we consider aggre-



154

gating the predictions in the entity view. As shown
in Table 1, we convert the predictions for tokens
to predictions for ranges, aggregate labels for ev-
ery range, and then resolve remaining conflicts. A
prediction is ignored if it conflicts with another
one with higher probability. By using this greedy
strategy, we can solve the conflicts raised in entity-
level aggregation. We use superscripts tok and
ent to denote token-level and entity-level aggre-
gations, i.e. BEAtokuns and BEA

ent
uns.

2.2 Few-Shot Transfer
Until now, we have assumed no access to anno-
tations in the target language. However, when
some labelled text is available, how might this
best be used? In our experimental setting, we
assume a modest set of 100 labelled sentences,
in keeping with a low-resource setting (Garrette
and Baldridge, 2013).4 We propose two models
BEAsup and RaRe in this setting.

Supervising BEA (BEAsup) One possibility is to
use the labelled data to find the posterior for the
parameters V (j) and π of the Bayesian model de-
scribed in §2.1. Let nk be the number of instances
in the labelled data whose true label is k, and njkl
the number of instances whose true label is k and
classifier j labels them as l. Then the quantities in
Equation (1) can be calculated as

E log πk =ψ(nk)− ψ(N)

E log vjkl =ψ(njkl)− ψ

(∑
l

njkl

)
.

These are used in Equation (2) for inference on the
test set. We refer to this setting as BEAsup.

Ranking and Retraining (RaRe) We also pro-
pose an alternative way of exploiting the lim-
ited annotations, RaRe, which first ranks the sys-
tems, and then uses the top ranked models’ out-
puts alongside the gold data to retrain a model
on the target language. The motivation is that the
above technique is agnostic to the input text, and
therefore is unable to exploit situations where reg-
ularities occur, such as common words or charac-
ter patterns that are indicative of specific class la-
bels, including names, titles, etc. These signals
are unlikely to be consistently captured by cross-
lingual transfer. Training a model on the target

4Garrette and Baldridge (2013) showed that about 100
sentences can be annotated with POS tags in two hours by
non-native annotators.

language with a character encoder component, can
distil the signal that are captured by the transfer
models, while relating this towards generalisable
lexical and structural evidence in the target lan-
guage. This on its own will not be enough, as
many tokens will be consistently misclassified by
most or all of the transfer models, and for this rea-
son we also perform model fine-tuning using the
supervised data.

The ranking step in RaRe proceeds by evalu-
ating each of the H transfer models on the tar-
get gold set, to produce scores sh (using the F1
score). The scores are then truncated to the top
k ≤ H values, such that sh = 0 for those sys-
tems h not ranked in the top k, and normalised
ωh =

sh∑k
j=1 sj

. The range of scores are quite wide,

covering 0.00 − 0.81 (see Figure 2), and accord-
ingly this simple normalisation conveys a strong
bias towards the top scoring transfer systems.

The next step is a distillation step, where a
model is trained on a large unannotated dataset in
the target language, such that the model predic-
tions match those of a weighted mixture of trans-
fer models, using ~ω = (ω1, . . . , ωH) as the mix-
ing weights. This process is implemented as mini-
batch scheduling, where the labels for each mini-
batch are randomly sampled from transfer model
h with probability ωh.5 This is repeated over the
course of several epochs of training.

Finally, the model is fine-tuned using the small
supervised dataset, in order to correct for phe-
nomena that are not captured from model trans-
fer, particularly character level information which
is not likely to transfer well for all but the most
closely related languages. Fine-tuning proceeds
for a fixed number of epochs on the supervised
dataset, to limit overtraining of richly parameterise
models on a tiny dataset. Note that in all stages,
the same supervised dataset is used, both in rank-
ing and fine-tuning, and moreover, we do not use
a development set. This is not ideal, and gener-
alisation performance would likely improve were
we to use additional annotated data, however our
meagre use of data is designed for a low resource
setting where labelled data is at a premium.

5We show that uniform sampling with few source lan-
guages achieves worse performance.

3 Experiments

3.1 Data

Our primarily evaluation is over a subset of the
Wikiann NER corpus (Pan et al., 2017), using
41 out of 282 languages, where the langauges
were chosen based on their overlap with multi-
lingual word embedding resources from Lample
et al. (2018).6 The NER taggs are in IOB2 format
comprising of LOC, PER, and ORG. The distribu-
tion of labels is highly skewed, so we created bal-
anced datasets, and partitioned into training, de-
velopment, and test sets, details of which are in
the Appendix. For comparison with prior work,
we also evaluate on the CoNLL 2002 and 2003
datasets (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang
and De Meulder, 2003), which we discuss further
in §4.

For language-independent word embedding
features we use fastText 300 dimensional
Wikipedia embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017),
and map them to the English embedding space
using character-identical words as the seed for
the Procrustes rotation method for learning bin-
gual embedding spaces from MUSE (Lample et al.,
2018).7 Similar to Xie et al. (2018) we don’t rely
on a bilingual dictionary, so the method can be
easily applied to other languages.

3.2 Model Variations

As the sequential tagger, we use a BiLSTM-CRF
(Lample et al., 2016), which has been shown to re-
sult in state-of-the-art results in high resource set-
tings (Ma and Hovy, 2016; Lample et al., 2016).
This model includes both word embeddings (for
which we used fixed cross-lingual embeddings)
and character embeddings, to form a parame-
terised potential function in a linear chain condi-
tional random field. With the exception of batch
size and learning rate which were tuned (details in
Appendix), we kept the architecture and the hyper-
parameters the same as the published code.8

6With ISO 639-1 codes: af, ar, bg, bn, bs, ca, cs, da, de,
el, en, es, et, fa, fi, fr, he, hi, hr, hu, id, it, lt, lv, mk, ms, nl,
no, pl, pt, ro, ru, sk, sl, sq, sv, ta, tl, tr, uk and vi.

7 We also experimented with other bilingual embedding
methods, including: supervised learning over bilingual dic-
tionaries, which barely affected system performance; and
pure-unsupervised methods (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe
et al., 2018), which performed substantially worse. For this
reason we use identical word type seeding, which is preferred
as it imposes no additional supervision requirement.

8https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/
sequence_tagging

We trained models on all 41 languages in both
high-resource (HSup) and naive supervised low-
resource (LSup) settings, where HSup pre-trained
models were used for transfer in a leave-one-out
setting, i.e., taking the predictions of 40 models
into a single target language. The same BiLSTM-
CRF is also used for RaRe.

To avoid overfitting, we use early stopping
based on a validation set for the HSup, and LSup
baselines. For RaRe, given that the model is al-
ready trained on noisy data, we stop fine-tuning
after only 5 iterations, chosen based on the perfor-
mance for the first four languages.

We compare the supervised HSup and LSup
monolingual baselines with our proposed transfer
models:

MV uniform ensemble, a.k.a.“majority vote”;
BEAuns×2, BEAuns unsupervised aggregation

models, applied to entities or tokens (see
§2.1);

BEAsup supervised estimation of BEA prior
(§2.2);

RaRe, RaRe uns supervised ranking and retrain-
ing model (§2.2), and uniform ranking with-
out fine-tuning, respectively; and

Oracle selecting the best performing single
transfer model, based on test performance.

We also compare with BWET (Xie et al., 2018)
as state-of-the-art in unsupervised NER trans-
fer. BWET transfers the source English training
and development data to the target language us-
ing bilingual dictionary induction (Lample et al.,
2018), and then uses a transformer architecture
to compensate for missing sequential information.
We used BWET in both CoNLL, and Wikiann
datasets by transferring from their corresponding
source English data to the target language.9

4 Results

We report the results for single source direct trans-
fer, and then show that our proposed multilingual
methods outperform majority voting. Then we
analyse the choice of source languages, and how
it affects transfer.10 Finally we report results on
CoNLL NER datasets.

9Because BWET uses identical characters for bilingual
dictionary induction, we observed many English loan words
in the target language mapped to the same word in the in-
duced bilingual dictionaries. Filtering such dictionary items
might improve BWET.

Figure 3: The mean and standard deviation for
the F1 score of the proposed unsupervised models
(BEAtokuns and BEA

BEAentsup t10) compared with state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised model BWET (Xie et al., 2018), high- and low-
resource supervised models HSup and LSup, and ma-
jority voting (MVtok) in terms of entity level F1 over
the 41 languages (40 for BWET) summarised from Ta-
ble 4. The x axis shows the annotation requirement of
each model in the target language where “200” means
100 sentences each for training and development, and
“5K+” means using all the available annotation for
training and development sets. Points with the same
colour/shape have equal data requirement.

Direct Transfer The first research question we
consider is the utility of direct transfer, and the
simple majority vote ensembling method. As
shown in Figure 2, using a single model for direct
transfer (English: en) is often a terrible choice.
The oracle choice of source language model does
much better, however it is not always a closely re-
lated language (e.g., Italian: it does best for In-
donesian: id, despite the target being closer to

Malay: ms). Note the collection of Cyrillic lan-
guages (bg, mk, uk) where the oracle is substan-
tially better than the majority vote, which is likely
due to script differences. The role of script ap-
pears to be more important than language family,
as seen for Slavic languages where direct transfer
works well between between pairs languages us-
ing the same alphabet (Cyrillic versus Latin), but
much more poorly when there is an alphabet mis-
match.11 The transfer relationship is not symmet-
ric e.g., Persian: fa does best for Arabic: ar, but
German: de does best for Persian. Figure 2 also
shows that ensemble voting is well below the ora-
cle best language, which is likely to be a result of
overall high error rates coupled with error correla-
tion between models, and little can be gained from
ensembling.

Multilingual Transfer We report the results
for the proposed low-resource supervised mod-
els (RaRe and BEAsup), and unsupervised models
(BEAuns and BEAuns×2), summarised as an aver-
age over the 41 languages in Figure 3 (see Ap-
pendix A for the full table of results). The figure
compares against high- and low-resource super-
vised baselines (HSup and LSup, respectively),
and BWET. The best performance is achieved with
a high supervision (HSup, F1 = 89.2), while very
limited supervision (LSup) results in a consider-
ably lower F1 of 62.1. The results for MVtok show
that uniform ensembling of multiple source mod-
els is even worse, by about 5 points.

Unsupervised zero-shot learning dramatically
improves upon MVtok, and BEAentuns outperforms
BEAtokuns, showing the effectiveness of inference

over entities rather than tokens. It is clear that hav-
ing access to limited annotation in the target lan-
guage makes a substantial difference in BEAentsup
and RaRe with F1 of 74.8 and 77.4, respectively.

Further analysis show that majority voting
works reasonably well for Romance and Ger-
manic languages, which are well represented in
the dataset, but fails miserably compared to single
best for Slavic languages (e.g. ru, uk, bg) where
there are only a few related languages. For most of
the isolated languages (ar, fa, he, vi, ta), explicitly
training a model in RaRe outperforms BEAentsup,
showing that relying only on aggregation of anno-
tated data has limitations, in that it cannot exploit
character and structural features.

Choice of Source Languages An important
question is how the other models, particularly the
unsupervised variants, are affected by the number
and choice of sources languages. Figure 4 charts
the performance of MV, BEA, and RaRe against
the number of source models, comparing the use
of ideal or realistic selection methods to attempt
to find the best source models. MVent, BEAentsup,
and RaRe use a small labeled dataset to rank the
source models. BEAentuns, oracle has the access to the
perfect ranking of source models based on their
real F1 on the test set. BEAuns×2 is completely
unsupervised in that it uses its own estimates to
rank all source models.
MV doesn’t show any benefit with more than 3

source models.12 In contrast, BEA and RaRe con-

tinue to improve with up to 10 languages. We
show that BEA in two realistic scenarios (unsu-
pervised: BEAentuns×2, and supervised: BEA

ent
sup) is

highly effective at discriminating between good
and bad source models, and thus filtering out the
bad models gives the best results. The BEAentuns×2
curve shows the effect of filtering using purely un-
supervised signal, which has a positive, albeit mild
effect on performance. In BEAentuns, oracle although
the source model ranking is perfect, it narrowly
outperforms BEA. Note also that neither of the
BEA curves show evidence of the sawtooth pat-
tern, i.e., they largely benefit from more inputs,
irrespective of their parity. Finally, adding super-
vision in the target language in RaRe further im-
proves upon the unsupervised models.

CoNLL Dataset Finally, we apply our model
to the CoNLL-02/03 datasets, to benchmark our
technique against related work. This corpus is
much less rich than Wikiann used above, as it
includes only four languages (en, de, nl, es), and
furthermore, the languages are closely related and
share the same script. Results in Table 2 show
that our methods are competitive with benchmark
methods, and, moreover, the use of 100 annotated
sentences in the target language (RaRe l) gives
good improvements over unsupervised models.13

Results also show that MV does very well, espe-
cially MVent, and its performance is comparable
to BEA’s. Note that there are only 3 source mod-
els and none of them is clearly bad, so BEA es-
timates that they are similarly reliable which re-
sults in little difference in terms of performance
between BEA and MV.

5 Related Work

Two main approaches for cross-lingual transfer are
representation and annotation projection. Rep-
resentation projection learns a model in a high-
resource source language using representations
that are cross-linguistically transferable, and then
directly applies the model to data in the target
language. This can include the use of cross-
lingual word clusters (Täckström et al., 2012)
and word embeddings (Ammar et al., 2016; Ni
et al., 2017), multitask learning with a closely
related high-resource language (e.g. Spanish for
Galician) (Cotterell and Duh, 2017), or bridging

13For German because of its capitalisation pattern, we low-
ercase all the source and target data, and also remove German
as a source model for other languages.

the source and target languages through phonemic
transcription (Bharadwaj et al., 2016) or Wikifi-
cation (Tsai et al., 2016). In annotation projec-
tion, the annotations of tokens in a source sen-
tence are projected to their aligned tokens in the
target language through a parallel corpus. An-
notation projection has been applied to POS tag-
ging (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov,
2011; Duong et al., 2014; Fang and Cohn, 2016),
NER (Zitouni and Florian, 2008; Ehrmann et al.,
2011; Agerri et al., 2018), and parsing (Hwa et al.,
2005; Ma and Xia, 2014; Rasooli and Collins,
2015a,b). The Bible, Europarl, and recently the
Watchtower has been used as parallel corpora,
which are limited in genre, size, and language
coverage, motivating the use of Wikipedia to cre-
ate weak annotation for multilingual tasks such
as NER (Nothman et al., 2013). Recent ad-
vances in (un)supervised bilingual dictionary in-
duction (Gouws and Søgaard, 2015; Duong et al.,
2016; Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018;
Schuster et al., 2019) have enabled cross-lingual
alignment with bilingual dictionaries (Mayhew
et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018). Most annotation pro-
jection methods with few exceptions (Täckström,
2012; Plank and Agić, 2018) use only one lan-
guage (often English) as the source language. In

multi-source language setting, majority voting is
often used to aggregate noisy annotations (e.g.
Plank and Agić (2018)). Fang and Cohn (2016)
show the importance of modelling the annotation
biases that the source language(s) might project to
the target language.

Transfer from multiple source languages:
Previous work has shown the improvements of
multi-source transfer in NER (Täckström, 2012;
Fang et al., 2017; Enghoff et al., 2018), POS tag-
ging (Snyder et al., 2009; Plank and Agić, 2018),
and parsing (Ammar et al., 2016) compared to sin-
gle source transfer, however, multi-source trans-
fer might be noisy as a result of divergence in
script, phonology, morphology, syntax, and se-
mantics between the source languages, and the tar-
get language. To capture such differences, var-
ious methods have been proposed: latent vari-
able models (Snyder et al., 2009), majority vot-
ing (Plank and Agić, 2018), utilising typological
features (Ammar et al., 2016), or explicitly learn-
ing annotation bias (Fang and Cohn, 2017). Our
work is also related to knowledge distillation from
multiple source models applied in parsing (Kun-
coro et al., 2016) and machine translation(Kim and
Rush, 2016; Johnson et al., 2017). In this work,
we use truth inference to model the transfer anno-
tation bias from diverse source models.

Finally, our work is related to truth inference
from crowd-sourced annotations (Whitehill et al.,
2009; Welinder et al., 2010), and most impor-
tantly from diverse classifiers (Kim and Ghahra-
mani, 2012; Ratner et al., 2017). Nguyen et al.
(2017) propose a hidden Markov model for ag-
gregating crowdsourced sequence labels, but only
learn per-class accuracies for workers instead of
full confusion matrices in order to address the data
sparsity problem in crowdsourcing.

6 Conclusion

Cross-lingual transfer does not work out of the
box, especially when using large numbers of
source languages, and distantly related target lan-
guages. In an NER setting using a collection
of 41 languages, we showed that simple meth-
ods such as uniform ensembling do not work
well. We proposed two new multilingual trans-
fer models (RaRe and BEA), based on unsuper-
vised transfer, or a supervised transfer setting with
a small 100 sentence labelled dataset in the tar-
get language. We also compare our results with



159

BWET (Xie et al., 2018), a state-of-the-art unsu-
pervised single source (English) transfer model,
and showed that multilingual transfer outperforms
it, however, our work is orthogonal to their work
in that if training data from multiple source mod-
els is created, RaRe and BEA can still combine
them, and outperform majority voting. Our un-
supervised method, BEAuns, provides a fast and
simple way of annotating data in the target lan-
guage, which is capable of reasoning under noisy
annotations, and outperforms several competitive
baselines, including the majority voting ensemble,
a low-resource supervised baseline, and the oracle
single best transfer model. We show that light su-
pervision improves performance further, and that
our second approach, RaRe, based on ranking
transfer models and then retraining on the target
language, results in further and more consistent
performance improvements.

A.1 Hyperparameters

We tuned the batch size and the learning rate
using development sets in four languages,14 and
then fixed these hyperparameters for all other lan-
guages in each model. The batch size was 1
sentence in low-resource scenarios (in baseline
LSup and fine-tuning of RaRe), and to 100 sen-
tences, in high-resource settings (HSup and the
pretraining phase of RaRe). The learning rate was
set to 0.001 and 0.01 for the high-resource and
low-resource baseline models, respectively, and to
0.005, 0.0005 for the pretraining and fine-tuning
phase of RaRe based on development results for
the four languages. For CoNLL datasets, we had
to decrease the batch size of the pre-training phase
from 100 to 20 (because of GPU memory issues).

A.2 Cross-lingual Word Embeddings

We experimented with Wiki and CommonCrawl
monolingual embeddings from fastText (Bo-
janowski et al., 2017). Each of the 41 languages is
mapped to English embedding space using three
methods from MUSE: 1) supervised with bilingual
dictionaries; 2) seeding using identical character
sequences; and 3) unsupervised training using ad-
versarial learning (Lample et al., 2018). The cross-
lingual mappings are evaluated by precision at
k = 1. The resulting cross-lingual embeddings are
then used in NER direct transfer in a leave-one-out
setting for the 41 languages (41×40 transfers), and
we report the mean F1 in Table 3. CommonCrawl
doesn’t perform well in bilingual induction despite
having larger text corpora, and underperforms in
direct transfer NER. It is also evident that using
identical character strings instead of a bilingual
dictionary as the seed for learning a supervised
bilingual mapping barely affects the performance.
This finding also applies to few-shot learning over
larger ensembles: running RaRe over 40 source
languages achieves an average F1 of 77.9 when
using embeddings trained with a dictionary, versus
76.9 using string identity instead. For this reason
we have used the string identity method in the pa-
per (e.g., Table 4), providing greater portability to
language pairs without a bilingual dictionary. Ex-
periments with unsupervised mappings performed
substantially worse than supervised methods, and
so we didn’t explore these further.

cross-lingual mapping on NER direct transfer. Word
translation accuracy, and direct transfer NER F1 are av-
eraged over 40 languages.

A.3 Direct Transfer Results
In Figure 5 the performance of an NER model
trained in a high-resource setting on a source lan-
guage applied on the other 40 target languages
(leave-one-out) is shown. An interesting finding
is that symmetry does not always hold (e.g. id vs.
ms or fa vs. ar).

A.4 Detailed Low-resource Results
The result of applying baselines, proposed mod-
els and their variations, and unsupervised transfer
model of Xie et al. (2018) are shown in Table 4.

Table 4: The size of training and test sets (development set size equals test set size) in thousand sentences, and
the precision at 1 for Bilingual dictionaries induced from mapping languages to the English embedding space
(using identical characters) is shown (BiDic.P@1). F1 scores on the test set, comparing baseline supervised
models (HSup, LSup), multilingual transfer from top k source languages (RaRe, 5 runs, k = 1, 10, 40), an
unsupervised RaRe with uniform expertise and no fine-tuning (RaRe uns), and aggregation methods: majority
voting (MVtok), BEAtokuns and BEA

ent
uns (Bayesian aggregation in token- and entity-level), and the oracle single best

annotation (Oracle). We also compare with BWET (Xie et al., 2018), an unsupervised transfer model with state-
of-the-art on CoNLL NER datasets. The mean and standard deviation over all 41 languages, µ, σ, are also reported.
