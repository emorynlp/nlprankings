Abstract

With the increasing amount of user gener-
ated reference texts in the web, automatic
quality assessment has become a key chal-
lenge. However, only a small amount
of annotated data is available for training
quality assessment systems. Wikipedia
contains a large amount of texts anno-
tated with cleanup templates which iden-
tify quality flaws. We show that the dis-
tribution of these labels is topically bi-
ased, since they cannot be applied freely
to any arbitrary article. We argue that it
is necessary to consider the topical restric-
tions of each label in order to avoid a sam-
pling bias that results in a skewed classifier
and overly optimistic evaluation results.
We factor out the topic bias by extracting
reliable training instances from the revi-
sion history which have a topic distribu-
tion similar to the labeled articles. This ap-
proach better reflects the situation a classi-
fier would face in a real-life application.

1 Introduction

User generated content is the main driving force
of the increasingly social web. Blogs, wikis and
forums make up a large amount of the daily infor-
mation consumed by web users. The main proper-
ties of user generated content are a low publication
threshold and little or no editorial control, which
leads to a high variance in quality. In order to nav-
igate through large repositories of information effi-
ciently and safely, users need a way to quickly as-
sess the quality of the content. Automatic quality
assessment has therefore become a key application
in today’s information society. However, there is
a lack of training data annotated with fine-grained
quality information.

Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia on the web,

contains so-called cleanup templates, which con-
stitute a sophisticated system of user generated la-
bels that mark quality problems in articles. Re-
cently, these cleanup templates have been used for
automatically identifying articles with particular
quality flaws in order to support Wikipedia’s qual-
ity assurance process in Wikipedia. In a shared
task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b), several systems
have shown that it is possible to identify the ten
most frequent quality flaws with high recall and
fair precision.

However, quality flaw detection based on
cleanup template recognition suffers from a topic
bias that is well known from other text classifica-
tion applications such as authorship attribution or
genre identification. We discovered that cleanup
templates have implicit topical restrictions, i.e.
they cannot be applied to any arbitrary article. As
a consequence, corpora of flawed articles based
on these templates are biased towards particular
topics. We argue that it is therefore not sufficient
for evaluating a quality flaw prediction systems to
measure how well they can separate (topically re-
stricted) flawed articles from a set of random out-
liers. It is rather necessary to determine reliable
negative instances with a similar topic distribution
as the set of positive instances in order to factor
out the sampling bias. Related studies (Brooke and
Hirst, 2011) have proven that topic bias is a con-
founding factor that results in misleading cross-
validated performance while allowing only near
chance performance in practical applications.

We present an approach for factoring out the
bias from quality flaw corpora by mining reliable
negative instances for each flaw from the article
revision history. Furthermore, we employ the ar-
ticle revision history to extract reliable positive
training instances by using the version of each
article at the time it has first been identified as
flawed. This way, we avoid including articles
with outdated cleanup templates, a frequent phe-

721



nomenon that can occur when a template is not
removed after fixing a problem in an article. In
our experiments, we focus on neutrality and style
flaws, since they are of particular high importance
within the Wikipedia community (Stvilia et al.,
2008; Ferschke et al., 2012a) and are recognized
beyond Wikipedia in applications such as uncer-
tainty recognition (Szarvas et al., 2012) and hedge
detection (Farkas et al., 2010).

2 Related Work

Topic bias is a known problem in text classifi-
cation. Mikros and Argiri (2007) investigate the
topic influence in authorship attribution. They
found that even simple stylometric features, such
as sentence and token length, readability mea-
sures or word length distributions show consider-
able correlations with topic. They argue that many
features that were largely considered to be topic
neutral are in fact topic-dependent variables. Con-
sequently, results obtained on multitopic corpora
are prone to be biased by the correlation of authors
with specific topics. Therefore, several authors in-
troduce topic-controlled corpora for applications
such as author identification (Koppel and Schler,
2003; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2005) or genre de-
tection (Finn and Kushmerick, 2006).

Brooke and Hirst (2011) measure the topic bias
in the International Corpus of Learner English
and found that it causes a substantial skew in clas-
sifiers for native language detection. In accor-
dance with Mikros et al., the authors found that
even non-lexicalized meta features, such as vo-
cabulary size or length statistics, depend on top-
ics and cause cross-validated performance evalua-
tions to be unrealistically high. In a practical set-
ting, these biased classifiers hardly exceed chance
performance.

As already noted above, a similar kind of topic
bias negatively influences quality flaw detection in
Wikipedia. Anderka et al. (2012) automatically
identify quality flaws by predicting the cleanup
templates in unseen articles with a one-class clas-
sification approach. Based on this work, a com-
petition on quality flaw prediction has been es-
tablished (Anderka and Stein, 2012b). The win-
ning team of the inaugural edition of the task
was able to detect the ten most common qual-
ity flaws with an average F1-Score of 0.81 us-
ing a PU learning approach (Ferretti et al., 2012).
With a binary classification approach, Ferschke et

al. (2012b) achieved an average F1-Score of 0.80,
while reaching a higher precision than the winning
team.

A closer examination of the aforementioned
quality flaw detection systems reveals a systematic
sampling bias in the training data, which leads to
an overly optimistic performance evaluation and
classifiers that are biased towards particular arti-
cle topics. Our approach factors out the topic bias
from the training data by mining topically con-
trolled training instances from the Wikipedia revi-
sion history. The results show that flaw detection
is a much harder problem in a real-life scenario.

3 Quality Flaws and
Flaw Recognition in Wikipedia

Quality standards in Wikipedia are mainly defined
by the featured article criteria1 and the Wikipedia
Manual of Style2. These policies define the char-
acteristics excellent articles have to exhibit. Other
sets of quality criteria are adaptations or relax-
ations of these standards, such as the good article
criteria or the quality grading schemes of individ-
ual interest groups in Wikipedia.

In this work, we focus on quality flaws regard-
ing neutrality and style problems. We chose these
categories due to their high importance within the
Wikipedia community (Stvilia et al., 2008; Fer-
schke et al., 2012a) and due to their relevance to
content outside of Wikipedia, such as blogs or on-
line news articles. According to the Wikipedia
policies3, an article has to be written from a neu-
tral point of view. Thus, authors must avoid stat-
ing opinions and seriously contested assertions as
facts, avoid presenting uncontested factual asser-
tions as mere opinions, prefer nonjudgmental lan-
guage and indicate the relative prominence of op-
posing views. Furthermore, authors have to adhere
to the stylistic guidelines defined in the Manual of
Style. While this subsumes a broad range of is-
sues such as formatting and article structure, we
focus on the style of writing and disregard mere
structural properties.

Any articles that violate these criteria can be
marked with cleanup templates4 to indicate their
need for improvement. These templates can
thus be regarded as proxies for quality flaws in
Wikipedia.

Table 1: Neutrality and style flaw corpora used in this work

Template Clusters Since several cleanup tem-
plates might represent different manifestations of
the same quality flaw, there is a 1 to n relation-
ship between quality flaws and cleanup templates.
For instance, the templates pov-check5, pov6 and
npov language7 can all be mapped to the same
flaw concerning the neutral point of view of an ar-
ticle. This aggregation of cleanup templates into
flaw-clusters is a subjective task. It is not al-
ways clear whether a particular template refers to
an existing flaw or should be regarded as a sep-
arate class. Too many clusters will cause defini-
tion overlaps (i.e. similar cleanup templates are
assigned to different clusters), while too few clus-
ters will result in unclear flaw definitions, since
each flaw receives a wide range of possible mani-
festations.

Template Scope Another important aspect to be
considered is the difference in the scope which
cleanup templates can have. Inline-templates are
placed directly in the text and refer to the sentence
or paragraph they are placed in. Templates with
a section parameter, refer to the section they are
placed in. The majority of templates, however, re-
fer to a whole page. The consideration of the tem-
plate scope is of particular importance for qual-
ity flaw recognition problems. For example, the
presence of a cleanup template which marks a sin-
gle section as not notable does not entail that the
whole article is not notable.

5The article has been nominated for a neutrality check
6The neutrality of the article is disputed
7The article contains a non-neutral style of writing

Topical Restriction A final aspect that has not
been taken into account by related work is that
many cleanup templates have restrictions concern-
ing the pages they may be applied to. A hard re-
striction is the page type (or namespace) a tem-
plate might be used in. For example, some tem-
plates can only be used in articles while others can
only be applied to discussion pages. This is usu-
ally enforced by maintenance scripts running on
the Wikimedia servers. A soft restriction, on the
other hand, are the topics of the articles a tem-
plate can be used in. Many cleanup templates can
only be applied to articles from certain subject ar-
eas. An example with a particularly obvious re-
striction is the template in-universe (see Table 1),
which should only be applied to articles about fic-
tion. This topical restriction is neither explicitly
defined nor automatically enforced, but it plays an
important role in the quality flaw recognition task,
as the remainder of this paper will show. While
flaws merely concerning the structural or linguis-
tic properties of an article are less restricted to
individual topics, they are still affected by a cer-
tain degree of topical preference. Many subject
areas in Wikipedia are organized in WikiProjects8,
which have their own ways of reviewing and en-
suring quality within their topical scope. Depend-
ing on the quality assurance processes established
in a WikiProject, different importance is given to
individual types of flaws. Thus, the distribution
of cleanup templates regarding structural or gram-
matical flaws is also biased towards certain topics.

723



We will henceforth subsume the concept of topical
preference under the term topical restriction.

Quality Flaw Recognition Based on the above
definition of quality flaws, we define the qual-
ity flaw recognition task similar to Anderka et
al. (2012) as follows: Given a sample of articles
in which each article has been tagged with any
cleanup template τi from a specific template clus-
ter T f thus marking all articles in the sample with
a quality flaw f , it has to be decided whether or
not an unseen article suffers from f .

4 Data Selection and Corpus Creation

For creating our corpora, we start with selecting all
cleanup templates listed under the categories neu-
trality and style in the typology of cleanup tem-
plates provided by Anderka and Stein (2012a).
Each of the selected templates serves as the nu-
cleus of a template cluster that potentially repre-
sents a quality flaw. To each cluster, we add all
templates that are synonymous to the nucleus. The
synonyms are listed in the template description
under redirects or shortcuts. Then we iteratively
add all synonyms of the newly added template un-
til no more redirects can be found. Furthermore,
we manually inspect the lists of similar templates
in the see also sections of the template descrip-
tions and include all templates that refer to the
same concept as the other templates in the cluster.
As mentioned earlier, this is a subjective task and
largely depends on the desired granularity of the
flaw definitions. We finally merge semantically
similar template clusters to avoid too fine grained
flaw distinctions.

As a result, we obtain a total number of 94
template clusters representing 60 style flaws and
34 neutrality flaws. From each of these clusters,
we remove templates with inline or section scope
due to the reasons outlined in Section 3. We also
remove all templates that are restricted to pages
other than articles (e.g. discussion or user pages).

We use the Java Wikipedia Library (Zesch et
al., 2008) to extract all articles marked with the
selected templates. We only regard flaws with
at least 500 affected articles in the snapshot of
the English Wikipedia from January 4, 2012.
Table 1 lists the final sets of flaws used in this
work. For each flaw, the nucleus of the template
cluster is provided along with a description, the
number of affected articles, and the cluster size.
We make the corpora freely available for down-

Agreement with Human Rater
Quality flaw detection in Wikipedia is based on the
assuption that cleanup templates are valid mark-
ers of quality flaws. In order to test the reliabil-
ity of these user assigned templates as quality flaw
markers, we carried out an annotation study in
which a human annotator was asked to perform the
binary flaw detection task manually. Even though
the human performance does not necessarily pro-
vide an upper boundary for the automatic classifi-
cation task, it gives insights into potentially prob-
lematic cases and ill-defined annotations. The an-
notator was provided with the template definitions
from the respective template information page as
instructions. For each of the 12 article scope flaws,
we extracted the plain text of 10 random flawed
articles and 10 random untagged articles. The an-
notator had to decide for each flaw individually
whether a given text belonged to a flawed article
or not. She was not informed about the ratio of
flawed to untagged articles.

Table 2 lists the chance corrected agreement
(Cohen’s κ) along with the F1 performance of the
human annotations against the gold standard cor-
pus. The templates copy-edit and trivia yielded
the lowest performance in the study. Even though
copy-edit templates are assigned to whole articles,
they refer to grammatical and stylistic problems of
relatively small portions of the text. This increases
the risk of overlooking a problematic span of text,
especially in longer articles. The trivia template,
on the other hand, designates sections that contain
miscellaneous information that are not well inte-
grated in the article. Upon manual inspection, we
found a wide range of possible manifestations of

724



this flaw ranging from an agglomeration of inco-
herent factoids to well-structured sections that did
not exactly match the focus of the article, which is
the main reason for the low agreement.

5 Selection of Reliable Training
Instances

Independent from the classification approach used
to identify flawed articles, reliable training data is
the most important prerequisite for good predic-
tions. On the one hand, we need a set of examples
that reliably represent a particular flaw, while on
the other hand, we need counterexamples which
reliably represent articles that do not suffer from
the same flaw. The latter aspect is most impor-
tant for discriminative classification approaches,
since they rely on negative instances for training
the classifier. However, reliable negative instances
are also important for one-class classification ap-
proaches, since it is only for the counterexam-
ples (or outliers) that the performance of one-class
classifiers can be sufficiently evaluated. It is fur-
thermore important that the positive and the neg-
ative instances do not differ systematically in any
respect other than the presence or absence of the
respective flaws, since any systematic difference
will bias the classifier. In this context, the topical
restrictions of cleanup templates have to be taken
into account. In the following, we describe our
approach to extracting reliable training instances
from the quality flaw corpora.

5.1 Reliable Positives

In previous work, the latest available versions of
flawed articles have been used as positive training
instances. However, we found upon manual in-
spection of the data that a substantial number of
articles has been significantly edited between the
time tτ, at which the template was first assigned,
and the time te, at which the articles have been ex-
tracted. Using the latest version at time te can thus
include articles in which the respective flaw has
already been fixed without removing the cleanup
template. Therefore, we use the revision of the ar-
ticle at time tτ to assure that the flaw is still present
in the training instance.

We use the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit (Fer-
schke et al., 2011), an enhancement of the Java
Wikipedia Library, to gain access to the revision
history of each article. For every article in the cor-
pus of positive examples for flaw f that is marked

with template τ ∈ T f , we backtrack the revision
history chronologically, until we find the first revi-
sion rtτ−1 that is not tagged with τ . We then add
the succeeding revision rtτ to the corpus of reliable
positives for flaw f . In Section 6, we show that
the classification performance improves for most
flaws when using reliable positives instead of the
latest available article versions.

5.2 Reliable Negatives and Topical
Restriction

A central problem of the quality flaw recognition
approach is the fact that there are no articles avail-
able that are tagged to not contain a particular
quality problem. So far, two solutions to this issue
have been proposed in related work. Anderka et al.
(2012) tackle the problem with a one-class classi-
fier that is trained on the positive instances alone
thus eradicating the need for negative instances in
the training phase. However, in order to evalu-
ate the classifier, a set of outliers is needed. The
authors circumvent this issue by evaluating their
classifiers on a set of random untagged instances
and a set of featured articles and argue that the
actual performance of predicting the quality flaws
lies between the two.

Ferretti et al. (2012) follow a two step classifica-
tion approach (PU learning) that first uses a Naive
Bayes classifier trained on positive instances and
random untagged articles to pre-classify the data.
In a second phase, they use the negatives identi-
fied by the Naive Bayes classifier to train a Sup-
port Vector Machine that produces the final predic-
tions. Even though the Naive Bayes classifier was
supposed to identify reliable negatives, the authors
found no significant improvement over a random
selection of negative instances, which effectively
renders the PU learning approach redundant.

None of the above approaches consider the
issue of topical restriction mentioned in Sec-
tion 3, which introduces a systematic bias to the
data. Both approaches sample random negative in-
stances Arnd for any given set of flawed articles A f
from a set of untagged articles Au (see Fig. 1a).
In order to factor out the article topics as a ma-
jor characteristic for distinguishing flawed articles
from the set of outliers, reliable negative instances
Arel have to be sampled from the restricted topic
set Atopic that contains articles with a topic dis-
tribution similar to the flawed articles in A f (see
Fig. 1b). This will avoid the systematic bias and

Figure 1: Sampling of negative instances for a given set of flawed articles (A f ). Random negatives (Arnd)
are sampled from articles without any cleanup templates (Au). Reliable negatives (Arel) are sampled from
the set of articles (Atopic) with the same topic distribution as A f

result in a more realistic performance evaluation.
In the following, we present our approach

to extracting reliable negative training instances
that conform with the topical restrictions of the
cleanup templates. Without loss of generality, we
assume that an article, from which a cleanup tem-
plate τ ∈ T f is deleted at a point in time dτ, the
article no longer suffers from flaw f at that point
in time. Thus, the revision rdτ is a reliable negative
instance for the flaw f . Additionally, since the ar-
ticle was once tagged with τ ∈ T f , it belongs to the
the same restricted topic set Atopic as the positive
instances for flaw f .

We use the Apache Hadoop9 framework and
WikiHadoop10, an input format for Wikipedia
XML dumps, for crawling the whole revision his-
tory of the English Wikipedia on a compute clus-
ter. WikiHadoop allows each Hadoop mapper to
receive adjacent revision pairs, which makes it
possible to compare the changes made from one
revision to the next. For every template τ ∈ T f ,
we extract all adjacent revision pairs (rdτ−1, rdτ), in
which the first revision contains τ and the second
does not contain τ. Since there are occasions in
which a template is replaced by another template
from the same cluster, we ensure that rdτ does also
not contain any other template from cluster T f be-
fore we finally add the revision to the set of reli-
able negatives for flaw f .

In the remainder of this section, we evaluate the
topical similarity between the positive and the neg-
ative set of articles for each flaw using both our
method and the original approach. In Wikipedia,

9
http://hadoop.apache.org

10
https://github.com/whym/wikihadoop

the topic of an article is captured by the categories
assigned to it. In order to compare two sets of arti-
cles with respect to their topical similarity, we rep-
resent each article set as a category frequency vec-
tor. Formally, we calculate for each set the vector
~C = (wc1 ,wc2 , . . . ,wcn) with wci being the weight
of category ci, i.e. the number of times it occurs in
the set, and n being the total number of categories
in Wikipedia. We can then estimate the topical
similarity of two article sets by calculating the co-
sine similarity of their category frequency vectors
~C1 B A and ~C2 B B as

sim(A, B) =
A · B
‖A‖ ‖B‖ =

i=1

Table 3 gives an overview of the similarity
scores between each positive training set and the
corresponding reliable negative set as well as be-
tween each positive set and a random set of un-
tagged articles. We can see that the topics of arti-
cles in the positive training sets are highly similar
to the topics of the corresponding reliable negative
articles while they show little similarity to the ar-
ticles in the random set. This implies that the sys-
tematic bias introduced by the topical restriction
has largely been eradicated by our approach.

Individual flaws have differently strong topical
restrictions. The strength of this restriction de-
pends on the size of Atopic. That is, a flaw such as
in-universe is restricted to a very narrow selection
of articles, while a flaw such as copy edit can be
applied to most articles and rather shows a topical
preference due to reasons outlined in Section 3. It

6 Experiments

In the following, we describe our system architec-
ture and the setup of our experiments. Our system
for quality flaw detection follows the approach by
Ferschke et al. (2012b), since it has been particu-
larly designed as a modular system based on the
Unstructured Information Management Architec-
ture11, which makes it easy to extend. Instead
of using Mallet (McCallum, 2002) as a machine
learning toolkit, we employ the Weka Data Min-
ing Software (Hall et al., 2009) for classification,
since it offers a wider range of state-of-the-art ma-
chine learning algorithms. For each of the 12 qual-
ity flaws, we employ three different dataset config-
urations. The BASE configuration uses the newest
version of each flawed article as positive instances
and a random set of untagged articles as negative
instances. The RELP configuration uses reliable
positives, as described in Section 5.1, in combi-
nation with random outliers. Finally, the RELALL
configuration employs reliable positives in com-
bination with the respective reliable negatives as
described in Section 5.2.

Features
An extensive survey of features for quality flaw
recognition has been provided by Anderka et al.
(2012). We selected a subset of these features for
our experiments and grouped them into four fea-
ture sets in order to determine how well differ-
ent combinations of features perform in the task.

Table 4: Feature sets used in the experiments

Table 4 lists all feature types used in our experi-
ments.

Since the feature space becomes large due to the
ngram features, we prune it in two steps. First,
we filter the ngrams according to their document
frequency in the training corpus. We discard all
ngrams that occur in less than x% and more than
y% of all documents. Several values for x and
y have been evaluated in parameter tuning ex-
periments. The best results have been achieved
with x=2 and y=90. In a second step, we apply
the Information Gain feature selection approach
(Mitchell, 1997) to the remaining set to determine
the most useful features.

Learning Algorithms

We evaluated several learning algorithms from the
Weka toolkit with respect to their performance on

a parameter optimization run and list the results of

performed the other algorithms on every flaw. We
used a sequential minimal optimization (SMO) al-
gorithm (Platt, 1998) to train the SVMs and used
different γ-values for the RBF kernel function. In
contrast to Ferretti et al. (2012), we did not see sig-
nificant improvements when optimizing γ for each
individual flaw, so we determined one best setting
for each dataset. Since SVMs with RBF kernels
are a special case of RBF networks that fit a sin-
gle basis function to the data, we also used gen-
eral RBF networks that can employ multiple ba-
sis functions, but we did not achieve better results
with that approach.

One-class classification, as proposed by An-
derka et al. (2012), did not perform well within
our setup. Even though we used an out-of-the-
box one class classifier, we achieve similar re-
sults as Anderka et al. in their pessimistic setting,
which best resembles our configuration. However,
the performance still lacks behind the other ap-
proaches in our experiments. The best perform-
ing algorithm reported by Ferschke et al. (2012b),
AdaBoost with decision stumps as a weak learner,
showed the second best results in our experiments.

7 Evaluation and Discussion

The SVMs achieve a similar cross-validated per-
formance on all feature sets containing ngrams,
showing only minor improvements for individ-
ual flaws when adding non-lexical features. This
suggests that the classifiers largely depend on
the ngrams and that other features do not con-
tribute significantly to the classification perfor-
mance. While structural quality flaws can be
well captured by special purpose features or in-
tensional modeling, as related work has shown,
more subtle content flaws such as the neutrality
and style flaws are mainly captured by the word-
ing itself. Textual features beyond the ngram level,
such as syntactic and semantic qualities of the
text, could further improve the classification per-
formance of these flaws and should be addressed
in future work. Table 6 shows the performance of
the SVMs with RBF kernel12 on each dataset us-
ing the NGRAM feature set. The average perfor-
mance based on NOWIKI is slightly lower while
using ALL features results in slightly higher aver-
age F1-scores. However, the differences are not
statistically significant and thus omitted. Classi-
fiers using the NONGRAM feature set achieved av-
erage F1-scores below 0.50 on all datasets. The
results have been obtained by 10-fold cross vali-
dation on 2,000 documents per flaw.

The classifiers trained on reliable positives and
random untagged articles (RELP) outperform the
respective classifiers based on the BASE dataset
for most flaws. This confirms our original hy-
pothesis that using the appropriate revision of each
tagged article is superior to using the latest avail-
able version from the dump. The performance on
the RELALL dataset, in which the topic bias has
been factored out, yields lower F1-scores than the
two other approaches. Flaws that are restricted to
a very narrow set of topics (i.e. Atopic in Fig. 1b
is small), such as the in-universe flaw, show the
biggest drop in performance. Since the topic
bias plays a major role in the quality flaw de-
tection task, as we have shown earlier, the topic-
controlled classifier cannot take advantage of the
topic information, while the classifiers trained on
the other corpora can make use of these charac-
teristic as the most discriminative features. In the
RELALL setting, however, the differences between
the positive and negative instances are largely de-
termined by the flaws alone. Classifiers trained on

such a dataset therefore come closer to recogniz-
ing the actual quality flaws, which makes them
more useful in a practical setting despite lower
cross-validated scores.

In addition to cross-validation, we performed a
cross-corpus evaluation of the classifiers for each
flaw. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of
the unbiased classifiers (trained on RELALL) on
the biased data (RELP) and vice versa. Hereby,
the positive training and test instances remain the
same in both settings, while the unbiased data con-
tains negative instances sampled from Arel and the
unbiased data from Arnd (see Figure 1). With the
NGRAM feature set, the reliable classifiers outper-
formed the unreliable classifiers on all flaws that
can be well identified with lexical cues, such as
Advert or Technical. In the biased case, we found
both topic related and flaw specific ngrams among
the most highly ranked ngram features. In the un-
biased case, most of the informative ngrams were
flaw specific expressions. Consequently, biased
classifiers fail on the unbiased dataset in which
the positive and negative class are sampled from
the same topics, which renders the highly ranked
topic ngrams unusable. Flaws that do not largely
rely on lexical cues, however, cannot be predicted
more reliably with the unbiased classifier. This
means that additional features are needed to de-
scribe these flaw. We tested this hypothesis by us-
ing the full feature set ALL and saw a substantial
improvement on the side of the unbiased classifier,
while the performance of the biased classifier re-
mained unchanged.

A direct comparison of our results to related
work is difficult, since neutrality and style flaws
have not been targeted before in a similar manner.
However, the Advert flaw was also part of the ten
flaw types in the PAN Quality Flaw Recognition
Task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b). The best system
achieved an F1 score of 0.839, which is just be-
low the results of our system on the BASE dataset,
which is similar to the PAN setup.

8 Conclusions

We showed that text classification based on
Wikipedia cleanup templates is prone to a topic
bias which causes skewed classifiers and overly
optimistic cross-validated evaluation results. This
bias is known from other text classification appli-
cations, such as authorship attribution, genre de-
tection and native language detection. We demon-

strated how to avoid the topic bias when creat-
ing quality flaw corpora. Unbiased corpora are
not only necessary for training unbiased classi-
fiers, they are also invaluable resources for gaining
a deeper understanding of the linguistic properties
of the flaws. Unbiased classifiers reflect much bet-
ter the performance of quality flaw recognition “in
the wild”, because they detect actual flawed ar-
ticles rather than identifying the articles that are
prone to certain quality due to their topic or subject
matter. In our experiments, we presented a system
for identifying Wikipedia articles with style and
neutrality flaws, a novel category of quality prob-
lems that is of particular importance within and
outside of Wikipedia. We showed that selecting
a reliable set of positive training instances mined
from the revision history improves the classifica-
tion performance. In future work, we aim to ex-
tend our quality flaw detection system to not only
find articles that contain a particular flaw, but also
to identify the flaws within the articles, which can
be achieved by leveraging the positional informa-
tion of in-line cleanup templates.
