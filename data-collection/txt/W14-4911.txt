Abstract
This paper presents the semi-semantic part of speech annotation and its evaluation via Krip-
pendorff’s α for the URDU.KON-TB treebank developed for the South Asian language Urdu.
The part of speech annotation with the additional subcategories of morphology and semantics
provides a treebank with sufficient encoded information. The corpus used is collected from the
Urdu Wikipedia and news papers. The sentences were annotated manually to ensure a high an-
notational quality. The inter-annotator agreement obtained after evaluation is 0.964, which lies
in the range of perfect agreement on a scale. Urdu is comparatively an under-resourced language
and the development of the treebank with rich part of speech annotation will have significant
impact on the state-of-the-art for Urdu language processing.

1 Introduction

Urdu, an invariant of Hindavi came into existence during the muslim rule from 1206 AD to 1858
AD (Khan, 2006). They used Persian/Urdu script for Urdu in contrast of the Devanagari script for Hin-
davi. Urdu became a literary language after existence of an increasing number of literature during 18th
and 19th century (McLane, 1970). Hindi/Hindavi is a close language to Urdu except the script writing
style and the differences in the formal and informal versions. Urdu is the national language of Pakistan
and an official language in India. According to a report by SIL Ethnologue (Lewis, 2013), Urdu/Hindi
has 456.2 million speakers in the whole world. Urdu is a morphologically rich language (MRL) and in
need of a number of resources to compete in the race of computational resources.

The design of the part of speech (POS) annotation scheme depends upon the need. If the people
want to do text processing, text mining, etc., then they might be interested in a limited POS annotation
scheme. However, the people who are interested in language parsing, then a POS annotation scheme
with rich information is needed. Getting state-of-the-art parsing results for a MRL is a challenge till to
date. According to Tsarfaty et. al. (2013; 2010), without proper handling of morphological entities in
the sentences, promising results for MRLs can not be achieved and the depth of information encoded
in an annotation correlates with the parsing performance. The best broad coverage and robust parsers
to date have grammars extracted from the treebanks, which are a collection of syntactically annotated
sentences by humans. The problem statement described requires an explicit encoding of morphological
information at the POS level and the treebanks with sufficient encoding of morphology, POS, syntactic
and functional information are the best candidates to provide the state-of-the-art parsing results in case of
MRLs. The work presented here is the part of a large effort made for the construction of the URDU.KON-
TB treebank, which was built by considering the parsing needs of Urdu. The annotation scheme of the
treebank contains semi-semantic POS (SSP), semi-semantic syntactic (SSS) and functional (F) tag sets,
from which only the SSP tag set is presented here along with its annotation evaluation.

The relevant resources of Urdu are now growing but most of the resources lack in morphological and
functional information. The initial corpus developed in the EMILLE project (McEnery et al., 2000) com-
prised multi-lingual corpora for the South Asian languages. Its Urdu part was annotated according to a

POS annotation scheme devised by Hardie (2003), which contained 350 morpho-syntactic tags based
on the gender, number agreement. It was so detailed that the Urdu computational linguists avoided it
to practice in statistical parsing, even it was a good effort. However, now the computational linguists
are realizing and attempting morphological information in their annotation (Manning, 2011). In (2007),
Urdu ParGram project introduced a resource that lied in the domain of tree-banking. In this project, Urdu
lexical functional grammar (LFG) was encoded, which is still in progress. The LFG grammar encoded
has rich morphological information, but unfortunately, the annotation scheme is not published yet due
to their different motives towards the parallel treebank development. Similarly, in (2009), Sajjad and
Schmid presented a new POS annotation scheme, which lacks in morphological, syntactical and func-
tional information. Due to which, it can only be used for the training of POS taggers and is not suitable
for the parsing purpose. Moreover, the explicit annotation evaluation was not performed. Another POS
tag set was devised by Muaz et. al. in (2009), which contained 32 general POS tags. The devised
scheme has the same issues as mentioned in the work of Sajjad and Schmid (2009). In (2009), Abbas et.
al. built the first NU-FAST treebank for Urdu with the POS and syntactic labels only. The design of that
treebank neither contained detailed morphological and functional information nor any information about
the displaced constituents, empty arguments, etc. Another Hindi-Urdu tree-banking (HUTB) (Bhatt et
al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2009) effort was done in a collaborative project1. However, the Urdu treebank
being developed was comparatively small and was being done as a part of a larger effort at establish-
ing a treebank for Hindi. Moreover, many of the issues with respect to Urdu were not quite addressed
and the project is still in progress. To continue this effort, another treebank for Urdu was designed by
Abbas in (2012), which comprised of 600 annotated sentences and it was done without the annotation
evaluation.

The current work presented in this paper, not only enhances the size of the proposed treebank by
Abbas (2012), but also resolves the annotation issues along with the complete annotation guidelines and
its evaluation. The development of the URDU.KON-TB treebank starts with the collection of a corpus
discussed briefly in Section 2. The semi-semantic (partly or partially semantic) POS (SSP) annotation
scheme is described in Section 3. Similarly, the evaluation of the SSP annotation is presented in Section 4
along with a brief presentation of annotation issues. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 5 and the
detailed version of the SSP tag set is given in Appendix.

2 Corpus Collection

One thousand (1000) sentences taken from the corpus (Ijaz and Hussain, 2007) are extensively modified
to get rid of licensing constraints, because we want to share our corpus freely under a Creative-Commons-
Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 or higher. The next four hundred (400) sentences are collected from
the Urdu Wikipedia2, which is already under the same license. Thus the size of the corpus is limited to
fourteen hundred (1400) sentences. The corpus contains text of local & international news, social stories,
sports, culture, finance, history, religion, traveling, etc.

3 Semi-Semantic POS (SSP) Annotation

After the annotation evaluation presented in Section 4, the revised annotation scheme of the
URDU.KON-TB treebank has a semi-semantic POS (SSP), semi-semantic syntactic (SSS) and a func-
tional (F) tag set. The term semi-semantic (partly or partially semantic) is used with the POS because
the tags are compounded with the semantic tags partially e.g. a noun house with spatial semantics tagged
as N.SPT, an adjective previous in the previous year with temporal semantics tagged as ADJ.TMP, etc.
The same concept is applied on the SSS annotation. The details of SSS and F labeling is beyond the
scope of this paper. At POS level, a dot ‘.’ is used to add morphological and semantical subcategories
into the main POS categories displayed in Table 1 of Appendix. The POS, morphological and semantical
information all together, make a rich SSP annotation scheme for the URDU.KON-TB treebank. The
need for such type of schemes is highly advocated in (Clark et al., 2010; Skut et al., 1997), etc.

A simple POS tag set was devised first, which had twenty two (22) main POS-tag categories described
in Table 1 of Appendix, which includes some non-familiar tags like HADEES and M to represent the
Arabic statements of prophets in Urdu text and a phrase or a sentence marker, respectively. The labels
for morphological and semantic subcategories are presented in Tables 2 and 3 of Appendix, respectively,
which can be added to the 22 main POS tag categories by using a dot ‘.’ symbol in the form of compound
tags like N.SPT and ADJ.TMP mentioned earlier. In case of morphology, if a verb V has a perfective
morphology, then the compound tag becomes V.PERF. The SSP tag set was refined during the manual
annotation process of the sentences and further refined after the annotation evaluation process discussed
in Section 4. The final refined form of the SSP tag set depicted in Table 4 of Appendix is the revised form
of the POS tag set presented in the initial version of the URDU.KON-TB treebank by Abbas in (2012).

As an example, consider the ADJ (adjective) from the final refined form of the SSP tag set given in
Appendix, which is divided into five subcategories of tags DEG (Degree), ECO (Echo), MNR (Manner),
SPT (Spatial) and TMP (Temporal). Relevant examples are provided in 1 of Appendix. The example 1(a)
of Appendix is a simple case of ADJ, while 1(b) of Appendix is the case of a degree adjective3 annotated
with ADJ.DEG. The example 1(c) of Appendix is the case of reduplication4 (Abbi, 1992; Bögel et al.,
2007). Reduplication has two versions. First Echo Reduplication is discussed in the footnote, while the
other Full Word Reduplication is the repetition of the original word e.g. sAtH sAtH ‘with/alongwith’.
These are adopted in our annotation as ECO (echo) and the REP (repetition), respectively. The example
1(d) of Appendix is the case of adjective having a sense of manner annotated as ADJ.MNR. If an adjective
qualifies an action noun, then a sense of action or something is produced, whose behavior or the way
to do that action is exploited through ADJ.MNR e.g. z4AlemAnah t2abdIlIyAN ‘brutal changes’. An
exercise of manner adjectives and manner adverbs for English can be seen at Cambridge University5. The
example 1(e) of Appendix is the case of an adjective having a temporal sense discussed earlier. Finally,
the example 1(f) of Appendix is the case of an adjective having a spatial sense. The adjective used here
is the derivational form of a city name ‘Multan’, but it appears here as an adjective and annotated as
ADJ.SPT6 like in this sentence e.g. voh Ek pAkistAnI laRkA hE ‘He is a pakistani boy’.

Example 1 of Appendix exploited the POS tags for adjectives along with the semantic tagging like
TMP, SPT, MNR, etc. However, to give an introduction about morphology and verb functions, another
POS category of verb V given in Appendix is presented. It is divided into 11 subcategories, which include
COP (copula verb), IMPERF (imperfective morphological form of verb), INF (infinitive form of verb),
LIGHT (1st light verb with nouns and adjectives), LIGHTV (2nd light verb with verbs), MOD (modal
verb), PERF (perfective morphology), ROOT (root form), SUBTV (subjunctive form), PAST (past tense
of a verb) and PRES (present tense of a verb). These tags have further subcategories. All tags represents
different morphological forms and the function of a verb that it governs. A few high quality studies were
adopted to identify different forms and functions of Urdu verbs (Butt, 2003; Butt, 1995; Butt and Rizvi,
2010; Butt and Ramchand, 2001; Butt, 2010; Abbas and Raza, 2014; Abbas and Nabi Khan, 2009) and
some annotated sentences from the URDU.KON-TB treebank are given in example 2 of Appendix.

The sentence in example 2(a) of Appendix is the case of adjective-verb complex verb predicate. These
adjective/noun-verb complex predicates were first proposed by Ahmed and Butt (2011). The adjective
dubHar ‘hard’ and the verb kiyA ‘did’ with a perfective morphology yA at the end are annotated as a ADJ
and a V.LIGHT.PERF, respectively. Similarly, a perfective verb liyA ‘took’ after a root form of verb kar
‘do’ is an example of the verb-verb complex predicate depicted in 2(d) of Appendix. This construction
is adopted from the studies given in (Butt, 2010). The next sentence in 2(b) of Appendix has a passive
construction, which can be inferred from the inflected form of a verb or a verb auxiliary jAnA ‘to go’
preceded by another verb with perfective morphology. To explore some unusual tags, a long sentence

3This division is used to represent absolute, comparative and superlative degree in adjectives and adverbs.
4In Urdu like other South Asian languages, the reduplication of a content word is frequent. Its effect is only to strengthen

the proceeding word or to expand the specific idea of a proceeding word into a general form e.g. kAm THIk-THAk karnA ’Do
the work right’ or kOI kapRE-vapRE dE dO ‘Give me the clothes or something like those’.

6Spatial adjectives are used to describe a place/location, direction or distance e.g. multAnI ‘Multani’, aglI ‘next’, and dUr
‘far’ respectively.

is presented in 2(c) of Appendix. After the name of prophets or righteous religious-personalities, some
specific and limited prayers called s3alAvAt ‘prayers’ like sal-lal-la-ho-a2lEhE-va-AlEhI-salam ‘May
Allah grant peace and honor on him and his family‘, a2lEh salAm ‘peace be upon him’, etc., in Arabic is
the most likely in Urdu text and annotated as the PRAY. Similarly, the statements of prophet Muhammad
(PBUH) known as h2adIs2 ‘narration’ like In-namal-aa2mAlo-bin-niyAt ‘The deeds are considered by
the intensions’ in Arabic script is also a tradition in Urdu text and annotated as the HADEES. The phrase
markers like comma, double quotes, single quotes, etc. are annotated with the M.P and sentence marker
like full-stop, question mark, etc., are annotated with the M.S as presented in the same example.

4 SSP Annotation Evaluation

The SSP annotation evaluation was performed via Krippendorff’s α coefficient (Krippendorff, 2004),
which is a statistical measure to evaluate the reliability annotation or the inter-annotator agreement (IAA).
Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 1970; Krippendorff, 2004) satisfies all our needs including random
nominal data and five number of annotators in contrast to multi-π (Fleiss, 1971) and multi-κ (Cohen
and others, 1960), which can handle only fixed nominal data and they are basically not designed for
more than two annotators (Artstein and Poesio, 2008; Carletta et al., 1997). The nominal data given to
annotators for the SSP annotation was not fixed. In this situation, the general form of the Krippendorff’s
α coefficient was selected to meet this requirement.

For the reliability evaluation of the SSP annotation guidelines, it was essential that the annotators
should be the native speakers of Urdu along with the linguistics skills. To fulfill this purpose, an un-
dergraduate class of 25 linguistic students was trained at the Department of English, University of Sar-
godha7, Pakistan. During this training, thirty two lectures on annotation guidelines with practical ses-
sions were delivered. The duration of each lecture was of 3 hours. The class was further divided into
five groups and during their initial practical sessions, one student with a high caliber of understanding
from each group was selected (but not informed) secretly for the final annotation. The annotation task
of 100 random sentences was divided into 10 home assignments, which were then given to all students
(including 5 secret students) periodically with an instruction not to discuss it with each other. The anno-
tation performed by the selected 5 students was then recorded and evaluated. The value of α coefficient
obtained after evaluation is 0.964 for the SSP annotation, which is narrated as a good reliability in (Krip-
pendorff, 2004) and lies in the category of perfect agreement according to a scale in (Landis and Koch,
1977). It also means that the IAA is 0.964 and the SSP annotation guidelines are reliable.

The issues found before and after the annotation evaluation concludes the addition, deletion or revision
of several tags. For example, the continuous auxiliary rahA/VAUX.PROG.PERF and its inflected forms
can behave as a copula verb as V.COP.PERF, which was not considered in the initial work. The annotators
did not respond well during the annotation of complex predicates, so their identification rules are revised
which includes tense, passive, modal, etc., auxiliaries or verbs can not behave as complex predicate e.g.
VAUX.LIGHT.MOD is not possible in the updated version. Similarly, the KER tag for identification of
a special clause ending with kar/V.KER kE/KER ‘after doing’, was found to be ambiguous and deleted.
It was updated with their genuine tags as kar/V.ROOT kE/CM.

5 Conclusion

Sufficient rich information in the SSP annotation was encoded to meet the parsing needs of MRL Urdu.
The α coefficient value obtained advocates the quality of the SSP annotation along with the complete
annotation guidelines for the URDU.KON-TB treebank. Such kind of annotated corpus with rich mor-
phology and semantics is not only useful for the parsing purpose but can be used for the training of POS
taggers, text mining, language identification (Abbas et al., 2010) and in many other applications as well.
