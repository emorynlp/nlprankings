Abstract

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT; Devlin et al. 2019) rep-
resents the latest incarnation of pretrained lan-
guage models which have recently advanced
a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. In this paper, we showcase how BERT
can be usefully applied in text summariza-
tion and propose a general framework for both
extractive and abstractive models. We intro-
duce a novel document-level encoder based on
BERT which is able to express the semantics
of a document and obtain representations for
its sentences. Our extractive model is built on
top of this encoder by stacking several inter-
sentence Transformer layers. For abstractive
summarization, we propose a new fine-tuning
schedule which adopts different optimizers for
the encoder and the decoder as a means of al-
leviating the mismatch between the two (the
former is pretrained while the latter is not). We
also demonstrate that a two-staged fine-tuning
approach can further boost the quality of the
generated summaries. Experiments on three
datasets show that our model achieves state-
of-the-art results across the board in both ex-
tractive and abstractive settings.1

1 Introduction

Language model pretraining has advanced the
state of the art in many NLP tasks ranging from
sentiment analysis, to question answering, natu-
ral language inference, named entity recognition,
and textual similarity. State-of-the-art pretrained
models include ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), GPT
(Radford et al., 2018), and more recently Bidirec-
tional Encoder Representations from Transform-
ers (BERT; Devlin et al. 2019). BERT combines
both word and sentence representations in a single
very large Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017); it is

pretrained on vast amounts of text, with an unsu-
pervised objective of masked language modeling
and next-sentence prediction and can be fine-tuned
with various task-specific objectives.

In most cases, pretrained language models have
been employed as encoders for sentence- and
paragraph-level natural language understanding
problems (Devlin et al., 2019) involving various
classification tasks (e.g., predicting whether any
two sentences are in an entailment relationship; or
determining the completion of a sentence among
four alternative sentences). In this paper, we ex-
amine the influence of language model pretrain-
ing on text summarization. Different from previ-
ous tasks, summarization requires wide-coverage
natural language understanding going beyond the
meaning of individual words and sentences. The
aim is to condense a document into a shorter ver-
sion while preserving most of its meaning. Fur-
thermore, under abstractive modeling formula-
tions, the task requires language generation ca-
pabilities in order to create summaries containing
novel words and phrases not featured in the source
text, while extractive summarization is often de-
fined as a binary classification task with labels in-
dicating whether a text span (typically a sentence)
should be included in the summary.

We explore the potential of BERT for text sum-
marization under a general framework encom-
passing both extractive and abstractive model-
ing paradigms. We propose a novel document-
level encoder based on BERT which is able to
encode a document and obtain representations
for its sentences. Our extractive model is built
on top of this encoder by stacking several inter-
sentence Transformer layers to capture document-
level features for extracting sentences. Our ab-
stractive model adopts an encoder-decoder archi-
tecture, combining the same pretrained BERT en-
coder with a randomly-initialized Transformer de-

coder (Vaswani et al., 2017). We design a new
training schedule which separates the optimizers
of the encoder and the decoder in order to accom-
modate the fact that the former is pretrained while
the latter must be trained from scratch. Finally,
motivated by previous work showing that the com-
bination of extractive and abstractive objectives
can help generate better summaries (Gehrmann
et al., 2018), we present a two-stage approach
where the encoder is fine-tuned twice, first with
an extractive objective and subsequently on the ab-
stractive summarization task.

We evaluate the proposed approach on three
single-document news summarization datasets
representative of different writing conventions
(e.g., important information is concentrated at the
beginning of the document or distributed more
evenly throughout) and summary styles (e.g., ver-
bose vs. more telegraphic; extractive vs. abstrac-
tive). Across datasets, we experimentally show
that the proposed models achieve state-of-the-art
results under both extractive and abstractive set-
tings. Our contributions in this work are three-
fold: a) we highlight the importance of document
encoding for the summarization task; a variety
of recently proposed techniques aim to enhance
summarization performance via copying mecha-
nisms (Gu et al., 2016; See et al., 2017; Nallap-
ati et al., 2017), reinforcement learning (Narayan
et al., 2018b; Paulus et al., 2018; Dong et al.,
2018), and multiple communicating encoders (Ce-
likyilmaz et al., 2018). We achieve better results
with a minimum-requirement model without using
any of these mechanisms; b) we showcase ways to
effectively employ pretrained language models in
summarization under both extractive and abstrac-
tive settings; we would expect any improvements
in model pretraining to translate in better summa-
rization in the future; and c) the proposed models
can be used as a stepping stone to further improve
summarization performance as well as baselines
against which new proposals are tested.

2 Background

2.1 Pretrained Language Models

Pretrained language models (Peters et al., 2018;
Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Dong
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) have recently
emerged as a key technology for achieving im-
pressive gains in a wide variety of natural lan-
guage tasks. These models extend the idea of

word embeddings by learning contextual repre-
sentations from large-scale corpora using a lan-
guage modeling objective. Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT; De-
vlin et al. 2019) is a new language representation
model which is trained with a masked language
modeling and a “next sentence prediction” task on
a corpus of 3,300M words.

The general architecture of BERT is shown in
the left part of Figure 1. Input text is first prepro-
cessed by inserting two special tokens. [CLS] is
appended to the beginning of the text; the output
representation of this token is used to aggregate in-
formation from the whole sequence (e.g., for clas-
sification tasks). And token [SEP] is inserted after
each sentence as an indicator of sentence bound-
aries. The modified text is then represented as a
sequence of tokens X = [w1, w2, · · · , wn]. Each
token wi is assigned three kinds of embeddings:
token embeddings indicate the meaning of each
token, segmentation embeddings are used to dis-
criminate between two sentences (e.g., during a
sentence-pair classification task) and position em-
beddings indicate the position of each token within
the text sequence. These three embeddings are
summed to a single input vector xi and fed to a
bidirectional Transformer with multiple layers:

h̃l = LN(hl−1 +MHAtt(hl−1)) (1)

hl = LN(h̃l + FFN(h̃l)) (2)

where h0 = x are the input vectors; LN is the layer
normalization operation (Ba et al., 2016); MHAtt
is the multi-head attention operation (Vaswani
et al., 2017); superscript l indicates the depth of
the stacked layer. On the top layer, BERT will gen-
erate an output vector ti for each token with rich
contextual information.

Pretrained language models are usually used to
enhance performance in language understanding
tasks. Very recently, there have been attempts
to apply pretrained models to various generation
problems (Edunov et al., 2019; Rothe et al., 2019).
When fine-tuning for a specific task, unlike ELMo
whose parameters are usually fixed, parameters in
BERT are jointly fine-tuned with additional task-
specific parameters.

2.2 Extractive Summarization
Extractive summarization systems create a sum-
mary by identifying (and subsequently concate-
nating) the most important sentences in a doc-
ument. Neural models consider extractive sum-

Original BERT BERT for Summar ization

Figure 1: Architecture of the original BERT model (left) and BERTSUM (right). The sequence on top is the input
document, followed by the summation of three kinds of embeddings for each token. The summed vectors are used
as input embeddings to several bidirectional Transformer layers, generating contextual vectors for each token.
BERTSUM extends BERT by inserting multiple [CLS] symbols to learn sentence representations and using interval
segmentation embeddings (illustrated in red and green color) to distinguish multiple sentences.

marization as a sentence classification problem:
a neural encoder creates sentence representations
and a classifier predicts which sentences should be
selected as summaries. SUMMARUNNER (Nal-
lapati et al., 2017) is one of the earliest neural
approaches adopting an encoder based on Recur-
rent Neural Networks. REFRESH (Narayan et al.,
2018b) is a reinforcement learning-based system
trained by globally optimizing the ROUGE metric.
More recent work achieves higher performance
with more sophisticated model structures. LA-
TENT (Zhang et al., 2018) frames extractive sum-
marization as a latent variable inference problem;
instead of maximizing the likelihood of “gold”
standard labels, their latent model directly max-
imizes the likelihood of human summaries given
selected sentences. SUMO (Liu et al., 2019) capi-
talizes on the notion of structured attention to in-
duce a multi-root dependency tree representation
of the document while predicting the output sum-
mary. NEUSUM (Zhou et al., 2018) scores and se-
lects sentences jointly and represents the state of
the art in extractive summarization.

2.3 Abstractive Summarization

Neural approaches to abstractive summarization
conceptualize the task as a sequence-to-sequence
problem, where an encoder maps a sequence of
tokens in the source document x = [x1, ..., xn]
to a sequence of continuous representations z =
[z1, ..., zn], and a decoder then generates the target
summary y = [y1, ..., ym] token-by-token, in an
auto-regressive manner, hence modeling the con-
ditional probability: p(y1, ..., ym|x1, ..., xn).

Rush et al. (2015) and Nallapati et al. (2016)
were among the first to apply the neural encoder-
decoder architecture to text summarization. See
et al. (2017) enhance this model with a pointer-
generator network (PTGEN) which allows it to
copy words from the source text, and a coverage
mechanism (COV) which keeps track of words that
have been summarized. Celikyilmaz et al. (2018)
propose an abstractive system where multiple
agents (encoders) represent the document together
with a hierarchical attention mechanism (over the
agents) for decoding. Their Deep Communicat-
ing Agents (DCA) model is trained end-to-end
with reinforcement learning. Paulus et al. (2018)
also present a deep reinforced model (DRM) for
abstractive summarization which handles the cov-
erage problem with an intra-attention mechanism
where the decoder attends over previously gen-
erated words. Gehrmann et al. (2018) follow a
bottom-up approach (BOTTOMUP); a content se-
lector first determines which phrases in the source
document should be part of the summary, and a
copy mechanism is applied only to preselected
phrases during decoding. Narayan et al. (2018a)
propose an abstractive model which is particu-
larly suited to extreme summarization (i.e., single
sentence summaries), based on convolutional neu-
ral networks and additionally conditioned on topic
distributions (TCONVS2S).

3 Fine-tuning BERT for Summarization

3.1 Summarization Encoder
Although BERT has been used to fine-tune vari-
ous NLP tasks, its application to summarization



3733

is not as straightforward. Since BERT is trained
as a masked-language model, the output vectors
are grounded to tokens instead of sentences, while
in extractive summarization, most models ma-
nipulate sentence-level representations. Although
segmentation embeddings represent different sen-
tences in BERT, they only apply to sentence-
pair inputs, while in summarization we must en-
code and manipulate multi-sentential inputs. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates our proposed BERT architecture
for SUMmarization (which we call BERTSUM).

In order to represent individual sentences, we
insert external [CLS] tokens at the start of each
sentence, and each [CLS] symbol collects features
for the sentence preceding it. We also use in-
terval segment embeddings to distinguish multi-
ple sentences within a document. For senti we
assign segment embedding EA or EB depending
on whether i is odd or even. For example, for
document [sent1, sent2, sent3, sent4, sent5], we
would assign embeddings [EA, EB, EA, EB, EA].
This way, document representations are learned
hierarchically where lower Transformer layers
represent adjacent sentences, while higher lay-
ers, in combination with self-attention, represent
multi-sentence discourse.

Position embeddings in the original BERT
model have a maximum length of 512; we over-
come this limitation by adding more position em-
beddings that are initialized randomly and fine-
tuned with other parameters in the encoder.

3.2 Extractive Summarization
Let d denote a document containing sentences
[sent1, sent2, · · · , sentm], where senti is the i-th
sentence in the document. Extractive summariza-
tion can be defined as the task of assigning a label
yi ∈ {0, 1} to each senti, indicating whether the
sentence should be included in the summary. It
is assumed that summary sentences represent the
most important content of the document.

With BERTSUM, vector ti which is the vector
of the i-th [CLS] symbol from the top layer can
be used as the representation for senti. Several
inter-sentence Transformer layers are then stacked
on top of BERT outputs, to capture document-level
features for extracting summaries:

h̃l = LN(hl−1 +MHAtt(hl−1)) (3)

hl = LN(h̃l + FFN(h̃l)) (4)

where h0 = PosEmb(T ); T denotes the sen-
tence vectors output by BERTSUM, and func-

tion PosEmb adds sinusoid positional embed-
dings (Vaswani et al., 2017) to T , indicating the
position of each sentence.

The final output layer is a sigmoid classifier:

ŷi = σ(Woh
L
i + bo) (5)

where hLi is the vector for senti from the top
layer (the L-th layer ) of the Transformer. In
experiments, we implemented Transformers with
L = 1, 2, 3 and found that a Transformer with
L = 2 performed best. We name this model
BERTSUMEXT.

The loss of the model is the binary classifica-
tion entropy of prediction ŷi against gold label yi.
Inter-sentence Transformer layers are jointly fine-
tuned with BERTSUM. We use the Adam opti-
mizer with β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999). Our learn-
ing rate schedule follows (Vaswani et al., 2017)
with warming-up (warmup = 10, 000):

lr = 2e−3 ·min (step−0.5, step · warmup−1.5)

3.3 Abstractive Summarization
We use a standard encoder-decoder framework for
abstractive summarization (See et al., 2017). The
encoder is the pretrained BERTSUM and the de-
coder is a 6-layered Transformer initialized ran-
domly. It is conceivable that there is a mis-
match between the encoder and the decoder, since
the former is pretrained while the latter must be
trained from scratch. This can make fine-tuning
unstable; for example, the encoder might overfit
the data while the decoder underfits, or vice versa.
To circumvent this, we design a new fine-tuning
schedule which separates the optimizers of the en-
coder and the decoder.

We use two Adam optimizers with β1 = 0.9 and
β2 = 0.999 for the encoder and the decoder, re-
spectively, each with different warmup-steps and
learning rates:

lrE = l̃rE ·min(step−0.5, step ·warmup−1.5E ) (6)
lrD = l̃rD ·min(step−0.5, step ·warmup−1.5D ) (7)

where l̃rE = 2e−3, and warmupE = 20, 000 for
the encoder and l̃rD = 0.1, and warmupD =
10, 000 for the decoder. This is based on the
assumption that the pretrained encoder should
be fine-tuned with a smaller learning rate and
smoother decay (so that the encoder can be trained
with more accurate gradients when the decoder is
becoming stable).

Table 1: Comparison of summarization datasets: size of training, validation, and test sets and average document
and summary length (in terms of words and sentences). The proportion of novel bi-grams that do not appear in
source documents but do appear in the gold summaries quantifies corpus bias towards extractive methods.

In addition, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning
approach, where we first fine-tune the encoder on
the extractive summarization task (Section 3.2)
and then fine-tune it on the abstractive summariza-
tion task (Section 3.3). Previous work (Gehrmann
et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018) suggests that using
extractive objectives can boost the performance
of abstractive summarization. Also notice that
this two-stage approach is conceptually very sim-
ple, the model can take advantage of information
shared between these two tasks, without funda-
mentally changing its architecture. We name the
default abstractive model BERTSUMABS and the
two-stage fine-tuned model BERTSUMEXTABS.

4 Experimental Setup

In this section, we describe the summarization
datasets used in our experiments and discuss vari-
ous implementation details.

4.1 Summarization Datasets
We evaluated our model on three benchmark
datasets, namely the CNN/DailyMail news high-
lights dataset (Hermann et al., 2015), the New
York Times Annotated Corpus (NYT; Sandhaus
2008), and XSum (Narayan et al., 2018a). These
datasets represent different summary styles rang-
ing from highlights to very brief one sentence
summaries. The summaries also vary with respect
to the type of rewriting operations they exemplify
(e.g., some showcase more cut and paste opera-
tions while others are genuinely abstractive). Ta-
ble 1 presents statistics on these datasets (test set);
example (gold-standard) summaries are provided
in the supplementary material.

CNN/DailyMail contains news articles and as-
sociated highlights, i.e., a few bullet points giving
a brief overview of the article. We used the stan-
dard splits of Hermann et al. (2015) for training,
validation, and testing (90,266/1,220/1,093 CNN
documents and 196,961/12,148/10,397 DailyMail
documents). We did not anonymize entities. We

first split sentences with the Stanford CoreNLP
toolkit (Manning et al., 2014) and pre-processed
the dataset following See et al. (2017). Input doc-
uments were truncated to 512 tokens.
NYT contains 110,540 articles with abstractive
summaries. Following Durrett et al. (2016), we
split these into 100,834/9,706 training/test exam-
ples, based on the date of publication (the test
set contains all articles published from January 1,
2007 onward). We used 4,000 examples from the
training as validation set. We also followed their
filtering procedure, documents with summaries
less than 50 words were removed from the dataset.
The filtered test set (NYT50) includes 3,452 ex-
amples. Sentences were split with the Stanford
CoreNLP toolkit (Manning et al., 2014) and pre-
processed following Durrett et al. (2016). Input
documents were truncated to 800 tokens.
XSum contains 226,711 news articles accompa-
nied with a one-sentence summary, answering the
question “What is this article about?”. We used the
splits of Narayan et al. (2018a) for training, valida-
tion, and testing (204,045/11,332/11,334) and fol-
lowed the pre-processing introduced in their work.
Input documents were truncated to 512 tokens.

Aside from various statistics on the three
datasets, Table 1 also reports the proportion of
novel bi-grams in gold summaries as a measure
of their abstractiveness. We would expect mod-
els with extractive biases to perform better on
datasets with (mostly) extractive summaries, and
abstractive models to perform more rewrite op-
erations on datasets with abstractive summaries.
CNN/DailyMail and NYT are somewhat extrac-
tive, while XSum is highly abstractive.

4.2 Implementation Details
For both extractive and abstractive settings, we
used PyTorch, OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) and
the ‘bert-base-uncased’2 version of BERT to im-
plement BERTSUM. Both source and target texts

were tokenized with BERT’s subwords tokenizer.

Extractive Summarization All extractive mod-
els were trained for 50,000 steps on 3 GPUs (GTX
1080 Ti) with gradient accumulation every two
steps. Model checkpoints were saved and evalu-
ated on the validation set every 1,000 steps. We
selected the top-3 checkpoints based on the evalu-
ation loss on the validation set, and report the av-
eraged results on the test set. We used a greedy al-
gorithm similar to Nallapati et al. (2017) to obtain
an oracle summary for each document to train ex-
tractive models. The algorithm generates an oracle
consisting of multiple sentences which maximize
the ROUGE-2 score against the gold summary.

When predicting summaries for a new docu-
ment, we first use the model to obtain the score
for each sentence. We then rank these sentences
by their scores from highest to lowest, and select
the top-3 sentences as the summary.

During sentence selection we use Trigram
Blocking to reduce redundancy (Paulus et al.,
2018). Given summary S and candidate sen-
tence c, we skip c if there exists a trigram over-
lapping between c and S. The intuition is simi-
lar to Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR; Car-
bonell and Goldstein 1998); we wish to minimize
the similarity between the sentence being consid-
ered and sentences which have been already se-
lected as part of the summary.

Abstractive Summarization In all abstractive
models, we applied dropout (with probability 0.1)
before all linear layers; label smoothing (Szegedy
et al., 2016) with smoothing factor 0.1 was also
used. Our Transformer decoder has 768 hidden
units and the hidden size for all feed-forward lay-
ers is 2,048. All models were trained for 200,000
steps on 4 GPUs (GTX 1080 Ti) with gradient ac-
cumulation every five steps. Model checkpoints
were saved and evaluated on the validation set ev-
ery 2,500 steps. We selected the top-3 checkpoints
based on their evaluation loss on the validation set,
and report the averaged results on the test set.

During decoding we used beam search (size 5),
and tuned the α for the length penalty (Wu et al.,
2016) between 0.6 and 1 on the validation set; we
decode until an end-of-sequence token is emitted
and repeated trigrams are blocked (Paulus et al.,
2018). It is worth noting that our decoder ap-
plies neither a copy nor a coverage mechanism
(See et al., 2017), despite their popularity in ab-
stractive summarization. This is mainly because

we focus on building a minimum-requirements
model and these mechanisms may introduce ad-
ditional hyper-parameters to tune. Thanks to the
subwords tokenizer, we also rarely observe is-
sues with out-of-vocabulary words in the out-
put; moreover, trigram-blocking produces diverse
summaries managing to reduce repetitions.

5 Results

5.1 Automatic Evaluation
We evaluated summarization quality automati-
cally using ROUGE (Lin, 2004). We report
unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and
ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing informa-
tiveness and the longest common subsequence
(ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency.

Table 2 summarizes our results on the
CNN/DailyMail dataset. The first block in the ta-
ble includes the results of an extractive ORACLE
system as an upper bound. We also present the
LEAD-3 baseline (which simply selects the first
three sentences in a document).

The second block in the table includes various
extractive models trained on the CNN/DailyMail
dataset (see Section 2.2 for an overview). For

comparison to our own model, we also imple-
mented a non-pretrained Transformer baseline
(TransformerEXT) which uses the same architec-
ture as BERTSUMEXT, but with fewer parameters.
It is randomly initialized and only trained on the
summarization task. TransformerEXT has 6 lay-
ers, the hidden size is 512, and the feed-forward
filter size is 2,048. The model was trained with
same settings as in Vaswani et al. (2017).

The third block in Table 2 highlights the per-
formance of several abstractive models on the
CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section 2.3 for an
overview). We also include an abstractive Trans-
former baseline (TransformerABS) which has the
same decoder as our abstractive BERTSUM mod-
els; the encoder is a 6-layer Transformer with 768
hidden size and 2,048 feed-forward filter size.

The fourth block reports results with fine-tuned
BERT models: BERTSUMEXT and its two vari-
ants (one without interval embeddings, and one
with the large version of BERT), BERTSUM-
ABS, and BERTSUMEXTABS. BERT-based mod-
els outperform the LEAD-3 baseline which is not
a strawman; on the CNN/DailyMail corpus it
is indeed superior to several extractive (Nalla-
pati et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018b; Zhou
et al., 2018) and abstractive models (See et al.,
2017). BERT models collectively outperform
all previously proposed extractive and abstractive
systems, only falling behind the ORACLE upper
bound. Among BERT variants, BERTSUMEXT
performs best which is not entirely surprising;

Results for comparison systems are taken from the au-

CNN/DailyMail summaries are somewhat extrac-
tive and even abstractive models are prone to copy-
ing sentences from the source document when
trained on this dataset (See et al., 2017). Perhaps
unsurprisingly we observe that larger versions of
BERT lead to performance improvements and that
interval embeddings bring only slight gains.

Table 3 presents results on the NYT dataset.
Following the evaluation protocol in Durrett et al.
(2016), we use limited-length ROUGE Recall,
where predicted summaries are truncated to the
length of the gold summaries. Again, we report
the performance of the ORACLE upper bound and
LEAD-3 baseline. The second block in the table
contains previously proposed extractive models as
well as our own Transformer baseline. COM-
PRESS (Durrett et al., 2016) is an ILP-based model
which combines compression and anaphoricity
constraints. The third block includes abstractive
models from the literature, and our Transformer
baseline. BERT-based models are shown in the
fourth block. Again, we observe that they out-
perform previously proposed approaches. On this
dataset, abstractive BERT models generally per-
form better compared to BERTSUMEXT, almost
approaching ORACLE performance.

Table 4 summarizes our results on the XSum
dataset. Recall that summaries in this dataset are
highly abstractive (see Table 1) consisting of a sin-
gle sentence conveying the gist of the document.
Extractive models here perform poorly as corrob-
orated by the low performance of the LEAD base-
line (which simply selects the leading sentence
from the document), and the ORACLE (which se-
lects a single-best sentence in each document) in
Table 4. As a result, we do not report results
for extractive models on this dataset. The second

block in Table 4 presents the results of various ab-
stractive models taken from Narayan et al. (2018a)
and also includes our own abstractive Transformer
baseline. In the third block we show the results
of our BERT summarizers which again are supe-
rior to all previously reported models (by a wide
margin).

5.2 Model Analysis
Learning Rates Recall that our abstractive
model uses separate optimizers for the encoder
and decoder. In Table 5 we examine whether
the combination of different learning rates (l̃rE
and l̃rD) is indeed beneficial. Specifically, we re-
port model perplexity on the CNN/DailyMail val-
idation set for varying encoder/decoder learning
rates. We can see that the model performs best
with l̃rE = 2e− 3 and l̃rD = 0.1.

Position of Extracted Sentences In addition to
the evaluation based on ROUGE, we also ana-
lyzed in more detail the summaries produced by
our model. For the extractive setting, we looked at
the position (in the source document) of the sen-
tences which were selected to appear in the sum-
mary. Figure 2 shows the proportion of selected
summary sentences which appear in the source
document at positions 1, 2, and so on. The analysis
was conducted on the CNN/DailyMail dataset for
Oracle summaries, and those produced by BERT-
SUMEXT and the TransformerEXT. We can see
that Oracle summary sentences are fairly smoothly
distributed across documents, while summaries
created by TransformerEXT mostly concentrate on
the first document sentences. BERTSUMEXT out-
puts are more similar to Oracle summaries, indi-
cating that with the pretrained encoder, the model
relies less on shallow position features, and learns
deeper document representations.

Novel N-grams We also analyzed the output of
abstractive systems by calculating the proportion
of novel n-grams that appear in the summaries but
not in the source texts. The results are shown in
Figure 3. In the CNN/DailyMail dataset, the pro-

portion of novel n-grams in automatically gener-
ated summaries is much lower compared to refer-
ence summaries, but in XSum, this gap is much
smaller. We also observe that on CNN/DailyMail,
BERTEXTABS produces less novel n-ngrams than
BERTABS, which is not surprising. BERTEXTABS
is more biased towards selecting sentences from
the source document since it is initially trained as
an extractive model.

The supplementary material includes examples
of system output and additional ablation studies.

5.3 Human Evaluation

In addition to automatic evaluation, we also evalu-
ated system output by eliciting human judgments.
We report experiments following a question-
answering (QA) paradigm (Clarke and Lapata,
2010; Narayan et al., 2018b) which quantifies
the degree to which summarization models retain
key information from the document. Under this
paradigm, a set of questions is created based on
the gold summary under the assumption that it
highlights the most important document content.
Participants are then asked to answer these ques-
tions by reading system summaries alone without
access to the article. The more questions a sys-
tem can answer, the better it is at summarizing the
document as a whole.

Moreover, we also assessed the overall qual-
ity of the summaries produced by abstractive sys-
tems which due to their ability to rewrite content
may produce disfluent or ungrammatical output.
Specifically, we followed the Best-Worst Scal-
ing (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2017) method
where participants were presented with the output
of two systems (and the original document) and

asked to decide which one was better according to
the criteria of Informativeness, Fluency, and Suc-
cinctness.

Both types of evaluation were conducted on
the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. For the
CNN/DailyMail and NYT datasets we used the
same documents (20 in total) and questions from
previous work (Narayan et al., 2018b; Liu et al.,
2019). For XSum, we randomly selected 20
documents (and their questions) from the release
of Narayan et al. (2018a). We elicited 3 re-
sponses per HIT. With regard to QA evaluation,
we adopted the scoring mechanism from Clarke
and Lapata (2010); correct answers were marked
with a score of one, partially correct answers
with 0.5, and zero otherwise. For quality-based
evaluation, the rating of each system was com-
puted as the percentage of times it was chosen as
better minus the times it was selected as worse.
Ratings thus range from -1 (worst) to 1 (best).

cells are filled with — whenever system output is not

Results for extractive and abstractive systems
are shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. We
compared the best performing BERTSUM model
in each setting (extractive or abstractive) against
various state-of-the-art systems (whose output is
publicly available), the LEAD baseline, and the
GOLD standard as an upper bound. As shown
in both tables participants overwhelmingly pre-
fer the output of our model against comparison
systems across datasets and evaluation paradigms.
All differences between BERTSUM and compari-
son models are statistically significant (p < 0.05),
with the exception of TCONVS2S (see Table 7;
XSum) in the QA evaluation setting.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we showcased how pretrained BERT
can be usefully applied in text summarization. We
introduced a novel document-level encoder and
proposed a general framework for both abstrac-
tive and extractive summarization. Experimental
results across three datasets show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art results across the board
under automatic and human-based evaluation pro-
tocols. Although we mainly focused on docu-
ment encoding for summarization, in the future,
we would like to take advantage the capabilities of
BERT for language generation.
