Abstract 

This paper presents a method for cleaning 
and evaluating parallel corpora using 
word alignments and machine learning 
algorithms. It is based on the assumption 
that parallel sentences have many word 
alignments while non-parallel sentences 
have few or none. We show that it is 
possible to build an automatic classifier, 
which identifies most of non-parallel 
sentences in a parallel corpus. This 
method allows us to do (1) automatic 
quality evaluation of parallel corpus, and 
(2) automatic parallel corpus cleaning. 
The method allows us to get cleaner 
parallel corpora, smaller statistical 
models, and faster MT training, but this 
does not always guarantee higher BLEU 
scores. 

An open-source implementation of the 
tool described in this paper is available 
from https://github.com/tilde-nlp/c-eval. 

1 Introduction 
In statistical machine translation, translation 
quality is largely dependent on the amount of 
parallel data available. In practice, a large chunk 
of data considered parallel might not be so, and it 
can interfere with good data and reduce 
translation quality. 

The problem of low quality parallel corpora is 
getting more and more important because it is 
becoming popular to build parallel corpora from 
web data using fully automatic methods. The 
quality of such corpora often is very low, 
especially in case of multilingual corpora, which 
are built by people who do not know the 
languages they are working with. As a result, we 
get corpora with broken encoding, many 

alignment errors and even texts in different 
languages. 

The problem can be mitigated by removing 
blatantly obvious non-parallel text that can be 
detected with handwritten rules. But that does not 
help in cases where there are alignment errors or 
two sentences are kind-of parallel but the 
translation is wrong or incomplete. The cleaning 
of such parallel text would require human 
involvement since devising rules for catching 
such errors would be nearly impossible. 

The idea presented in this work is to compare 
word alignments in a parallel text with those 
found in a non-parallel text. The intuition being 
that truly parallel text should have many 
alignments on word level while unrelated non-
parallel text should have few to no alignments. 

Since word alignment computation is already a 
step in the training process of many phrase-based 
statistical machine translation systems, it can be 
used as input data for the corpus evaluation and 
cleaning method that we propose. 

Another benefit of cleaning a corpus is a 
reduced size, which leads to smaller storage and 
computational costs of statistical machine 
translation systems. 

2 Related Work 

This paper is about evaluation and cleaning of 
parallel corpora, which has been researched from 
different aspects before. Typically corpus 
evaluation and cleaning are separate steps in the 
corpus development process, and corpus 
development goes through several cycles of 
evaluation and cleaning while corpus quality 
reaches acceptable level. 

Corpus quality is evaluated by both calculating 
quantitative measurements and assessing its 
suitability for the purpose. One of the most 
important quality aspects of a parallel corpus is 
sentence alignment quality, which shows how 
accurately a corpus is broken into sentences and 

185



whether aligned sentences are translations of each 
other. It is common to use the same metrics for 
corpus quality evaluation as for sentence 
alignment evaluation. The sentence alignment 
evaluation has been well established in ARCADE 
project/shared task (Langlais et al., 1998), where 
quality is assessed calculating precision, recall 
and F-measure both in segment and sub-segment 
levels. In the same way precision is also used for 
corpora evaluation. To calculate the precision we 
need an annotated subset of the corpus where each 
sentence alignment is marked as correct or not. 
There are different ways how to get such 
annotations, Smith et al. (2013), Skadiņš et al. 
(2014) and Seljan et al. (2010) use a human 
annotated random subset of corpus, while Kaalep 
and Veskis (2007) obtain annotations from two 
different but similar versions of the corpus. 
Another approach in corpora quality assessment 
has been used by Steinberger et al. (2012), they 
tested alignment in a production setting where 
translators were confronted with the automatically 
aligned translations and were encouraged to notify 
any alignment errors.  

Although many parallel corpora have been 
declared to be suitable for different purposes, 
many of them have not been formally evaluated 
(Steinberger et al., 2012; Tiedemann, 2012; 
Callison-Burch, 2009, Chapter 2.2.) and many 
have been just partially evaluated only for 
suitability for MT (Koehn, 2005; Eisele & Chen, 
2010; Smith et al., 2013; Skadiņš et al., 2014), i.e., 
authors build MT systems to illustrate that corpus 
is useful for MT. 

Corpus cleaning in practice has often been 
limited to applying a set of handwritten rules 
(regular expressions) to detect blatantly obvious 
cases where two sentences are not parallel 
(Rueppel et al., 2011; Ruopp, 2010; etc.). More 
advanced corpora cleaning includes filters that 
check text language (Lui & Baldwin, 2012) and 
spelling, and filter out machine translated content 
(Rarrick et al., 2011). And there are corpora 
cleaning methods that automatically identifies 
sentences that are not in conformity with the rest 
of the corpus; Okita (2009) removes outliers by 
the literalness score between a pair of sentences, 
Jiang et al. (2010) introduce lattice score-based 
data cleaning method, and Taghipour et al. (2011) 
use density estimators to detect the outliers. These 
methods allow to identify potentially non-parallel 
sentences and to filter out sentences with 
conformity level below a certain threshold; these 
methods filter out specified amount of data, but 
they do not estimate how much data should be 

filtered out. The method proposed in this paper 
deals with both issues: (1) automatic quality 
evaluation of parallel corpus and (2) automatic 
parallel corpus cleaning. Similar word alignment 
based corpus cleaning method is used by Stymne 
et al. (2013), but unlike this work they use 
alignment based heuristics to filter out bad 
sentence pairs. 

3 Proposed Method 

3.1 Intuition 

Word alignment is a task in natural language 
processing of identifying translation relationships 
among the words in a parallel text. It is commonly 
used in phrase-based statistical machine 
translation (Koehn et al., 2003) where word 
alignments are used to extract phrases. One of the 
commonly used phrase extraction algorithms is to 
take sequential word alignments in a sentence and 
expand them as much as possible. The better the 
word alignments, the better the phrases. 

Alignments in a parallel text can be computed 
with the Expectation Maximization algorithm 
which means that alignments in a sentence are 
dependent on similar alignments elsewhere in the 
corpus. These are called IBM Models 1-5 (Brown 
et al., 1993). 

We can presume that if a corpus is good then 
there should be many word alignments in 
sentences. If there are mostly correct sentences in 
a parallel corpus then the sentences where there 
are few or no alignments might not be parallel. 
While comparing good alignments with bad 
alignments for large data is a daunting task for a 
human, it is perfectly suited for machine learning, 
which we explore in this paper. 

The idea is to develop a model with machine 
learning for classifying a pair of sentences as 
either parallel or not. As such, it is necessary to 
train such a model with positive and negative 
examples. Positive examples can be an approved 
parallel corpus while negative examples can be 
generated from a good corpus by shuffling 
translations or artificially generating bad 
translations. 

For machine learning algorithms to do their job 
it is necessary to convert text into set of features 
(numbers), each feature representing a clue for the 
algorithm how to classify the input data.  

3.2 Features 

Fast Align word aligner (Dyer et al, 2013) which 
implements modified IBM Model 2 was used. It 

186



provides us with the alignments and the statistical 
likelihood of each token-to-token translation. 
From this data we obtain the features that are used 
for machine learning.  

We generated various probable features. For 
example, we calculate the Threshold score by 
dividing the count of alignments that are present 
in both alignment directions (intersection of 
alignment count) with the total count of 
alignments in the respective line (for each 
language direction). Further features were 
calculated from the alignment probability scores 
for each token that are provided by Fast Align in 
the alignment process.  

From the list of probable features the most 
relevant ones were chosen that provide statistical 
significance for the machine learning.  

We used WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) for 10-fold 
cross validation with a constant seed to evaluate 
all the features. Correlation-based Feature Subset 
Selection for Machine Learning by 
M. A. Hall (1999) with the best first search 
method was used to evaluate the significance of 
all features in the DGT-TM 2007 (Steinberger et 
al., 2012) English to Latvian corpus of 100,000 
correct and 100,000 incorrect lines. 

The most significant alignment feature proved 
to be the fourth dealing with the nth root of the 
multiplication of the probabilities of n tokens 
(geometric mean). The formulae of the selected 
features can be seen below (n represents the 
number of tokens in a line).  
 

1) 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒  = 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡  
2) 𝑆𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏.  𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑛  
3) 𝑙𝑔(|𝑆𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏.  𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒|𝑛 ) 
4) √|𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏. 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒|𝑛  
5) 𝑙𝑔(√|𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏. 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒|)𝑛  

 
In addition to word alignments, we explored the 
possibility to enhance the accuracy by including 
features that are derived from the text itself. For 
example, the ratio of source sentence token count 
and target sentence token count, division of 
common number count and all unique number 
count in source and target sentences, etc. We 
calculate features from tokens, numbers, symbols, 
words and symbols in both source and target 
sentences – total 43 textual features. 

The computation of textual features for a large 
amount of input data was about two times slower 

that the computation of alignment features. More 
importantly, the result quality including textual 
features together with alignment features 
increased the precision only by 0.2%. For these 
reasons, text features were discarded. 

3.3 Machine Learning  

Once we finalized a list of possible features and 
selected the most relevant ones, we moved on to 
the next step of putting them to use with the help 
of machine learning algorithms.  

In order to employ machine learning algorithms 
and to train a model, we had to provide good 
(correctly aligned parallel corpora) and bad 
(aligned corpora with shuffled lines) data. The 
algorithms then go through each good and bad 
features and produce a statistical model against 
which another corpus can be benchmarked.   

We evaluated several machine learning 
algorithms and set out to find those that achieved 
the highest precision with acceptable performance 
time as well as a high rate of true positives – an 
important point when evaluating machine 
learning algorithms (Flach, 2012). 

According to Hill et al. (1998) decision-tree 
based algorithms would be very suited for 
working with large data and finding the 
distinguishing line between data from good and 
bad corpus. As a result, a data model would be 
obtained that could be used in filtering each line 
of a given corpus.

Accuracy as well as training and classification 
run times of several machine learning algorithms 
were evaluated on the first 100,000 lines of the 
DGT-TM 2007 EN-LV corpus. The results are 
summarized in Table 1. 

As can be seen, the algorithms perform rather 
similarly, though the performance time greatly 
varies from 15.8 seconds up to 7.5 minutes for a 
corpus containing 100,000 lines. The REPTree 
algorithm was chosen because of its high 
precision paired with relatively good speed.

4 Evaluation 

Firstly, we evaluated the tool by looking at the 
BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) changes, 
qualitative changes and the quality score of 
EUBokshop (OPUS edition) corpus, which is 
known to be cluttered with bad data. It has been 
automatically extracted from web data (PDF files), 
containing parallel corpora for 24 official 
European Union languages (Skadiņš et al., 2014). 
For testing we chose the Latvian, English and 
French language pairs. 

We evaluated several well-known corpora with 
the Corpus Cleaner tool as well as whether the 
results were consistent with qualitative evaluation. 
The chosen corpora consisted of: EN-FR 109 
parallel corpus (Callison-Burch, 2009, Chapter 
2.2.), EN-DE and EN-FR versions of 
CommonCrawl (Smith et al., 2013), DGT-TM 
2012 (Steinberger et al., 2012), EMEA 
(Tiedemann, 2012), Europarl (Koehn, 2005), 
JRC-Aquis (Steinberger et al., 2006), WIT3 
(Cettolo et al., 2012). 

A number of different models were built and 
used to test if models were language independent. 

4.1 Evaluation in MT 

Since the main use for this cleaning method is 
machine translation, we evaluated how the 
cleaning method affects the BLEU score. 

For the MT evaluation we trained an SMT 
system with the original EU Bookshop corpus and 
noted the BLEU score.  

We applied the same procedure to the cleaned 
version of the corpus. Table 2 summarizes the 
BLEU scores and the amount of good lines after 
cleaning for the explored language pairs can be 
seen. 

The BLEU score for both the original and 
cleaned MT systems was nearly identical with the 
cleaned corpus having a slightly lower BLEU 
score than the original. However, this does not 
necessarily mean no improvement.  

Generally, in MT systems the less data you 
have, the less likely you are to have correct 
translations, and as it has been shown by Goutte 
et al. (2012), phrase-based SMT is quite robust to 
noise. Therefore bigger corpus despite containing 
more corrupt lines is not that detrimental to 
machine translation since it gets lost in translation 
anyway.

Table 2. BLEU score for original and cleaned EU 
Bookshop corpora (OPUS), good line amount after 

cleaning. 

While the BLEU score nearly did not change 
for the cleaned corpora, the corpus size, however, 
did. The cleaned corpora was respectively about 
70% and 40% the size of the original. This means 
that training and memory costs were much lower 
than the original corpus required. Moreover, the 
huge difference in cleaned corpus size in 
comparison with the original producing the same 
BLEU score indicates that indeed the corrupt lines 
that the MT system also had deemed unfit were
filtered out. 

4.2 Qualitative Evaluation 

To qualitatively evaluate the cleaning method, we 
randomly took 200 lines from the original as well 
as the cleaned corpora for Latvian-English and 
Latvian-French language pairs. We manually 
evaluated them for incorrect or erroneous 
alignment. The results are shown in Table 3. The 
manual evaluation was done by one evaluator.

The qualitative results clearly show the 
improvement in corpus quality. Taking into 
account that the size of corpora was 
approximately 30% smaller after cleaning and 
performance rate of about 90%, it can be 
concluded that a significant part of bad data was 
removed. 

4.3 Corpora Evaluation with Different 
Models 

As a part of the corpora cleaning process, we 
implemented a corpus evaluation solution. The 
percentage score of a corpus shows the amount of 
good lines in the text.  

As models for cleaning could be constructed 
from any corpora that is recognized of good 
quality, we set to determine if the models are 
language independent. That is, if different models 
(made from approximately equal quality corpora) 
would produce the same results for a given 
parallel corpus.  

The models were trained on the DGT-TM 2007 
corpus consisting of EN-LV, EN-FR, EN-LT, and 
FR-LV language pairs. The graph lines represent 
the score of each corpus using the corresponding 
model (along the X axis). Models themselves 
were evaluated using WEKA tool. The results are 
shown below in Figure 1. 

 

Figure 1. Corpora evaluation with different models. 

The results show, overall, that the lower the 
quality of corpus, the more varied the cleaning 
results from different models will be.  

It can be concluded that while there is a 
difference in the performance of the models 
(worst case up to 20%), it evens out with the 
increase of the quality of the corpora (approx. 5% 
variation). To sum up, for precise corpus 
evaluation, it would be best to use a model that 
has been built for the particular language pair.  

To see how the method fares with already good 
data, we evaluated the DGT-TM English-
Lithuanian corpus with the DGT-TM English-
Latvian model as well as the DGT-TM French-
English corpus with the DGT-TM Latvian-
English model. It removed approximately 3% of 
good sentences, which we think is acceptable. 
Similarly OPUS EU Constitution corpus, which is 
considered fairly accurate, saw about 5% cut and 
showed considerably more stable results across all 
models than EU Bookshop corpora signaling 
reliable performance in case of high quality 
corpora.  

4.4 Evaluated Corpora Comparison 

Initially we started our evaluations using well 
known good quality corpora. As can be seen in 
Table 4, all of the evaluated corpora are of high 
quality (around 98%) corresponding with 
previous evaluations and qualitative evaluations 
of 100 sentences randomly taken from the English 
to Latvian language pair. The quality of the above 
corpora was measured with corresponding models 
built from the first 100,000 lines of the DGT-TM-
2007 corpus.

We also evaluated less credible corpora (See

between EUBookshop Tilde and OPUS editions 
with approximately 20% increase in quality. This 
result is understandable as Tilde has considerably 
improved the quality of EUBookshop by filtering 
and manually editing it (Skadiņš et al., 2014).

In order to compare the results of the 
CommonCrawl EN-DE corpus quality with the 
work done by Stymne et al. (2013), it was 
additionally cleaned by removing sentence pairs 
with larger than three ratio, sentences with more 
than 60 tokens as well as the corpus was 
lowercased. This reduced the corpus by 4.28%. 
Consequently filtering the original 
CommonCrawl reduced the amount by 16%, 
while 13% was removed from the cleaned version 
of the CommonCrawl corpus.

Stymne’s et al. research shows a considerably 
larger corpus reduction (27%) based on alignment 
evaluation, 5.3% reduction by cleaning the text 
and in addition 8.8% by removing sentences with 
wrong detected language. The approach taken by 
Stymne et al. looks at a manually annotated gold 
corpus of 100 lines, and extrapolates from that 
good calculated values from alignment 
intersection against sentence length, similarly as 
Threshold score described previously. This 
manual method generates more strict results and 
consequently marks more lines as bad. However, 
the qualitative evaluation of CommonCrawl both 
original and cleaned versions correspond to that in 
Stymne’s et al. work signaling that the used 
methods should be looked into more thoroughly.  

Language detection as employed by Stymne et 
al. produced high quality results. While, wrong 
language use shows up in the alignment quality up 
to a certain level producing a small intersection set, 
it could, nevertheless, be considered as an 
additional feature in the corpus cleaner tool.  

English-French109 and CommonCrawl EN-FR 
corpora show a moderate level of accuracy as 
well as the qualitative evaluation confirms this 
result deviating by 5% and 10% respectively. 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 

We have shown that by using word alignment 
features we can build an automatic classifier, 
which identifies most non-parallel sentences in a 
parallel corpus. This method allows us to do (1) 
automatic quality evaluation of a parallel corpus, 
and (2) automatic parallel corpus cleaning. The 
method allows us to get cleaner parallel corpora, 
smaller statistical models, and faster MT training, 
but unfortunately this does not always guarantee 
higher BLEU scores. 

In this paper, we are reporting our first results. 
It is still necessary, however, to test the method 
for a much wider range of languages and corpora 
to verify that the method is applicable for other 
language pairs and to see whether the automatic 
corpora quality evaluation correlates with human 
judgment. 

We used Fast Align, which is based on IBM 
Model 2; but IBM Model 1, which requires less 
computation power, may prove just as effective. 
Similarly, it would be useful to evaluate higher 
IBM Models to see how much the results are 
improved at the cost of longer running time. 

We discarded text features for use as the input 
data for the classifier, but that does not mean that 
they are not useful. They might as well be used 
with handwritten rules as an additional step in the 
cleaning pipeline, either before this method is 
applied or afterwards. We are planning to revise 
textual features. In this research, we focused on 
identifying alignment errors, but textual features 
can be useful to identify broken encoding, texts in 
wrong language and other corpora quality issues. 

More consistent results across language models 
could be achieved improving bad training data 
generation. It is possible that during the shuffling 
process some lines are aligned in a way that 
produces a somewhat valid translation, therefore 
yielding inconsistent data for the machine-
learning algorithm.
