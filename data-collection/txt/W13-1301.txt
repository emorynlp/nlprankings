Abstract

We are interested in the task of image an-
notation using noisy natural text as training
data. An image and its caption convey dif-
ferent information, but are generated by the
same underlying concepts. In this paper, we
learn latent mixtures of topics that generate
image and product descriptions on shopping
websites by adapting a topic model for multi-
lingual data (Mimno et al., 2009). We use the
trained model to annotate test images without
corresponding text. We capture visual prop-
erties such as color, texture, shape, and ori-
entation by computing low-level image fea-
tures, and measure the contribution of each
type of visual feature towards the accuracy of
the model. Our model significantly outper-
forms both a competitive baseline and a pre-
vious topic model-based system.

1 Introduction

Image annotation is a classic problem in Computer
Vision. Given a query image, the task is to gen-
erate a set of textual labels that describe the visual
content. The typical approach to these problems is
to use supervised models, which require large num-
bers of hand-annotated examples for each of the la-
bels. However, the amount of information available
on the web continues to grow, the task of organiz-
ing and describing visual data becomes increasingly
complex. For example, a shopping website might ar-
range products into broad categories such as “shoes”
and “handbags” with each category containing tens
of thousands of products that are difficult for users

to search and navigate. It is often infeasible to dis-
cover all of the attributes within those categories that
are relevant to users and create labeled training ex-
amples for each of them.

Instead, we approach this problem by discovering
visual attributes from noisy natural language cap-
tions. That is, given a collection of images and cap-
tions found on the web, we learn a model of visual
and textual features. Then given a query image with
no text, we can generate likely descriptive words.
This is a difficult task because image captions on the
web are often noisy and incomplete: some captions
might not describe a particular visual feature, might
use a synonym for that feature, or might describe in-
formation that is not visual in the image at all.

A secondary motivation for this work is to use the
image annotations as a component in language gen-
eration systems such as for automatic image caption-
ing. We point to examples of previous work such
as Feng and Lapata (2010a) where image annota-
tions generated from a topic model are used to help
generate full sentences to describe images. Much of
the current research in image captioning is limited
by the current technology for object recognition in
Computer Vision. For example, SBU-Flickr dataset
(Ordonez et al., 2011) with 1 million images and
captions, is considered to be general-domain but is
actually built by querying Flickr using a pre-defined
term list related to visual attributes that there are
trained recognition systems for. While these sys-
tems can accurately generate descriptions for com-
mon visual objects and attributes, they are not as
well-suited for describing the “long-tail” of visual
attributes which appear in many domain-specific

datasets.
In this paper, we model image and text features

from the training data using a generative model. We
adapt the Polylingual topic model from Mimno et
al. (2009) to train on multi-modal data, and then use
the trained model to generate annotations for test im-
ages. We evaluate our model on two categories of
shopping images using a variety of types of com-
puted image features. For image annotation we out-
perform both a difficult baseline and previous work.

2 Related Work

We use the polylingual topic model from Mimno et
al. (2009), which was developed to model multi-
lingual corpora that are topically comparable be-
tween languages – the documents are not direct
translations, but they cover the same ideas. For ex-
ample, English and Finnish Wikipedia pages about
skiing are roughly similar, but the subject is covered
more thoroughly in Finnish. Therefore, the number
of tokens assigned to the Finnish topic for skiing is
much higher than it is in the English. While Mimno
et al. (2009) show that the model is effective in tasks
such as modeling topically comparable documents
across languages, our work is the first to show that
this model can be used to model data of different
modalities. Another quality of the polylingual topic
model is that words in different languages do not di-
rectly correspond with each other. This is a feature

of other multi-lingual topic models but would not
work for multi-modal data because a textual word
can carry more meaning by itself than an image fea-
ture can.

Countless approaches have been proposed for the
use of topic models in image annotation, but the
vast majority of these approaches consider the text
modality merely as labels for the image modality.
The most highly cited of these is the Correspon-
dence LDA (corr-LDA) model of Blei et al. (2003),
where topics are learned using the image modality
alone, and each textual word must be generated by a
specific region in the image. However, more recent
work has started to recognize the textual modality
as a source of information in its own right. Jia et
al. (2011) present a model that allows different in-
formation to be emphasized in each modality, but it
requires very clean text; they do not use documents
with captions that cannot be easily parsed or pro-
cessed. Then, they stem all words, and disregard
sparse word tokens. This works when working with
sources such as Wikipedia, where text captions are
highly edited and consistently formatted. In compar-
ision, our work can be trained on corpra where the
text has poor or inconsistant quality. Additionally,
their work was for the task of image retrieval from a
text query, while we are generating text annotations
for a query image.

Our work is most similar to the MixLDA model
of Feng and Lapata (2010b), except MixLDA mod-

2



els images and their related text as a single bag-
of-features, with visual and textual features coming
from the same vocabulary. This means that some
topics should have a greater proportion of features
from one of modalities, if there is an idea that is bet-
ter expressed in one over the other. Their model was
developed for finding descriptive words given both
an image and a news article, and can also be used
on large and noisy amounts of data, so we compare
MixLDA against our model in the experiments.

Although we use the Attribute Discovery Dataset
of Berg et al. (2010), their work is different from
ours in both problem formulation and the types of
attributes discovered. Their primary interest is to
characterize attributes according to how they are vi-
sually represented: global or local; color, texture, or
shape. Their work does not address the task of pre-
dicting attributes for unseen images. Additionally,
they do not work with individual descriptive words,
but cluster them using mutual information of vi-
sual attributes, creating a smaller number of “visual
synsets”. For example, one of their visual synsets
for images and descriptions of womens handbags is
{mesh, interior, metal} and another is {silver, metal-
lic}. In comparison, in the topic model the same
word can be generated by more than one topic.

Liu et al. (2010) examine the use of a variety of
image features in a Bayesian model in order to mea-
sure which are the best for classifying diverse ma-
terials such as stone, glass, and plastic. They found
that the image features they used for shape and color
were better indicators of the material of an object
than texture features, and their best combined model
did not include texture as a feature at all. We are also
interested in finding out whether our performance on
generating descriptive words is affected by different
types of image features.

3 Dataset

We use the Attribute Discovery Dataset from Berg
et al. (2010).1 The dataset consists of pairs of im-
ages and captions taken from the shopping website
like.com. The data has four categories: women’s
shoes, handbags, earrings, and neckties. We run our
model on two categories, shoes and handbags, due

1http://tamaraberg.com/
attributesDataset/index.html

to their larger sizes – 14764 and 9145 image-caption
pairs respectively – and diversity of features. This is
a reasonable amount of data in the shopping images
domain; more than half of the number of compa-
rable products sold on large retail websites such as
Zappos.com or Amazon.com.

Compared to general datasets such as Pascal
Sentences, the images in the Attribute Discovery
Dataset are more uniform. All image files are
280x280 pixel JPEGs, and images of products are
typically taken from similar angles against a white
or a light-colored solid background. Only rarely do
the images have noisy backgrounds, such as a per-
son wearing the item, or the same item displayed in
multiple colors in one image. However, this does not
necessarily make our task much easier, since the vi-
sual attributes we wish to learn are not pre-defined as
they are in a general-domain dataset. And the lack of
hand-annotated data means no negative examples of
when an attribute is not present, which are typically
used to train visual classifiers.

Furthermore, the captions are extremely noisy in
this dataset. Compared to the 20 object types in the
Pascal Sentences dataset, or about one hundred in
COREL, here there are thousands of words that can
be used to describe features in the images, includ-
ing synonyms, multiple stems of words, and mis-
spellings. In addition to explicit visual descriptions
of the products, the captions describe “less visual”
features such as details about the construction of the
item, during which season or activity it would be ap-
propriate to wear, or feelings that could be evoked
by looking at the item. These features are difficult
to represent as specific visual attributes, but can be
identified visually by domain-experts. Captions can
also include information that is non-visual such as
sizing and shipping information, or whether the item
is on sale.

The captions can be either full English sentences,
a list of features, or sometimes just a few words.
Longer captions in the dataset are truncated to 250
characters in length.

From our own obervations, we estimate about
10% of the captions in the shoes dataset contain
few or no descriptive words. At least 3.7% of the
shoes captions are entirely Javascript code, have sig-
nificant portions of code, or very long URLs. An-
other 5-6% either contain no information besides

3



sizing or shipping information, only the brand name
or model number of the shoe, or the caption is so
short that there are only one or two descriptive words
that could be used in our model. In the womens’
shoes category, we take some simple steps to remove
URLs and code to avoid learning accidental correla-
tion with legitimate features.2 However, we still use
all image and caption pairs in the training set, in-
cluding those which end up having empty captions,
since they are still useful for learning topics for vi-
sual features. For the handbags captions, we did not
try to remove code or long URLs since it seemed to
be less of a problem in that category.

4 Feature Representation

4.1 Text Features
The bag-of-words model is used for text. We use
Mxterminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) to
split sentences in the captions (in many instances,
nothing is done in this step becuase there are no
full sentences in the caption), Stanford POS Tag-
ger(Toutanova et al., 2003) to tag words, then in-
clude adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and nouns in the
topic model (except for proper nouns and common
background English words from a stoplist). How-
ever, these tags are really more a rough estimate of
parts of speech due to the number of incomplete sen-
tences and phrases, and the fact that many of the
words used to describe styles or attributes of cloth-
ing have different meanings in colloqueal English.3

All tokens are converted to lower case, but there is
no stemming or lemmatization. After preprocessing,
the size of the shoes text vocabulary is 9578 words,
with an average of 16.33 descriptive words per im-
age, while the bags have a text vocabulary of 6309
word types with 15.41 descriptive words per image
on average.

4.2 Visual Features
The bag-of-features model is used for visual features
as well. Most of these features are standard in com-
puter vision research, and are also used in work we
cited in Section 2.

2Tokens removed: URLs, all tokens that end in “.sh”, and a
few tokens obviously related to Javascript eg script, src, typeof,
var.

3Some examples of domain-specific words used in shopping
image descriptions: www.zappos.com/glossary

Shape: A SIFT descriptor describes which way
edges are oriented at a certain point in an image
(Lowe, 1999). It was develped to recognize the same
object under different scales and rotations. How-
ever, it is also commonly used for recognizing more
generalized types or features of objects. We use the
VLFeat open source library (Vedaldi and Fulkerson,
2008) to compute SIFT features at points of interest
and to cluster the SIFT features into discrete “visual
terms” using the k-means algorithm. There are 750
visual terms for SIFT features.

Color: We use two representations for color,
RGB (red, green, blue) and HSV (hue, satura-
tion, value). 25 pixels are sampled from the cen-
ter 100x100 pixels of the image (to avoid sampling
from the background of the image). Those pixel val-
ues are also clustered to visual terms using k-means,
with 100 visual terms each.

Texture: Images are convolved with Gabor filters
at multiple orientations and scales, sampled at ran-
dom locations, then clustered to form texton features
for texture (Leung and Malik, 2001). We convert all
images to grayscale, then sample 25 locations from
the center of the image, and cluster to 100 visual
terms. We also have a color texton feature, where
we sample and cluster textons separately for the red,
green, and blue color channels.

Reflectance/Curvature:4 We use three types of
related features for gradients and curvature. The
first is a bag-of-HOG (histogram of gradients) fea-
ture set (Dalal and Triggs, 2005) computed over a
regular grid on the image to measure changes in in-
tensity.5 The most significant of those features (as
determined by L2 norm) are selected for each im-
age, and like previous features are clustered into vi-
sual terms using k-means. The second two types are
derivatives of HOG which include information about
the amount of curvature at each orientation of the
HOG descriptor.6

5 Model

We model textual and visual features using the
polylingual topic model by Mimno et al. (2009). In
this section, we describe how the generative process
and inference of this model is adapted to topically
comparable multi-modal data.

Figure 1 shows the original polylingual topic
model. We model multi-modal data using two “lan-
guages”: txt for the bag-of-words captions, and img
for the combined visual terms. The generative pro-
cess is defined for an image and caption pair, w =<
wimg, wtxt >:

θ ∼ Dir(θ, αm)

zimg ∼ P (zimg|θ) =
∏
n

θ
zimgn

ztxt ∼ P (ztxt|θ) =
∏
n

θztxtn

wimg ∼ P (wimg|zimg,Φimg) = φimg
wimgn |zimgn

wtxt ∼ P (wtxt|ztxt,Φtxt) = φtxtwtxtn |ztxtn
First, a topic distribution for w is drawn from an
asymmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration pa-
rameter α and base measure m. Then a latent topic
assignment is drawn for each word token in wtxt,
and each discrete image feature in wimg. Once the
topic assignments are sampled, the observed tokens
are sampled according to their probability in the
modality-specific topics Φimg = {φimg1 , ..., φ

img
T }

and Φtxt = {φtxt1 , ..., φtxtT }.
4Note: These features are implemented using code from

(Felzenszwalb et al., ).
5There is significant overlap between these features, al-

though the benefits of overlap are lost due to the bag-of-features
model.

6Personal correspondance, work in progress.

To find the most probable descriptive words for an
unseen image, the first step is to estimate the topic
distribution that generated the image. Gibbs sam-
pling is used to sample topic assignments for visual
terms in the test image dimg:

P (zn = t|dimg, z\n,Φimg, αm)

∝ φimg
dimgn |t

(Nt)\n + αmt∑
tNt − 1 + α

Assuming that the descriptive words are indepen-
dent, the probability of text word wi given dimg is:

P (wi|dimg) =
∑

t

P (wi|ztxtt )P (zt|dimg)

summing over all topics t ∈ T .
For training the model, we used the Polylingual

topic model implementation from the Mallet toolkit
(McCallum, 2002) (with some small modifcations
to use it for generation). We use 1000 iterations for
inference, with hyperparameter optimization every
10 iterations. In both shoes and bags categories, the
number of topics is 200, which was minimally tuned
by hand on the shoes data.

6 Experimental Setup and Evaluation

We first run our model on the larger category, shoes.
For both systems and baselines, we find the 10, 15,
and 20 most likely words for the test images. We
evaluate by computing precision and recall against
descriptive words from the held-out captions for
those images.7 We compute macro-averages of these
scores because there is a lot of variation between the
sizes of the captions in the dataset. The split between
training and test instances is 80/20%.

We also evaluate the contributions of different
types of image features. We evaluate the model for
each image feature individually (along with the text
features), as well as combinations of image features.

We compare against the MixLDA system and a
strong baseline. We choose MixLDA because it
is relatively easy to re-implement and because it

7We find descriptive words for test instances in the exact
same way we did for training instances in Section 4.1. Instances
where we did not find any useable descriptive words did not
count towards the evaluation.

has previously outperformed other image annota-
tion systems when trained on natural language cap-
tions. Because the MixLDA model originally only
used SIFT features, we compare it against the SIFT-
only version of our model, with each system using
the same computed image and text features. We
re-implement the MixLDA system mostly as it is
described in Feng and Lapata (2010b), with a few
changes to make it more comparable to our model:
Obviously in our version of MixLDA the test in-
stances are only the unseen image as there is no other
surrounding text. The number of topics is 200 (the
original MixLDA had more but that did not seem to
help here), and the α and β hyperparameters are op-
timized every 10 iterations.8

We also compare our model against corpus fre-
quency of words in the training set. Although this
may seem like a trivial baseline, previous work

8We used the Mallet toolkit’s Parallel LDA sampler for in-
ference, while a variational approach is used in the original.
However, we do not believe this would change the outcome of
this experiment. We also tried MixLDA without hyperparam-
eter optimization but we do not show those results as they are
significantly worse.

on image annotation from both computer vision
(Müller et al., 2002; Monay and Gatica-Perez, 2003;
Barnard et al., 2003) and natural language process-
ing (Mason and Charniak, 2012) has shown that a
large portion of the keyword probability mass can
often be accounted for by a very small number of
words, allowing systems to game better-looking re-
sults by simply guessing the frequency distribution
of the text vocabulary. We find this to be espe-
cially true in the domain-specific case, where com-
mon terms (eg shoe, sole, heel, upper) are used in
almost every caption, and in some captions account
for most words used (such as the second example
in Table 1). While domain-frequent words are also
needed for generating new captions, we don’t want
them to account for all of the words our system gen-
erates. Of course, a human evaluation would be
another possible way of addressing this issue, but
it would be difficult and expensive to find enough
people who have sufficient knowledge of womens’
clothing and would be able to accurately say whether
the generated words are appropriate or not (words
such as hobo, PU, stacked, upper, and vamp). Also,

ber of test documents is very large so we can find
significance on precision and recall using bootstrap
resampling.

We also ran the baseline system and our system
on the handbags category of the dataset. We did not
modify the system in any way when using the bags
dataset, just gave it different file for input.

7 Results and Discussion

The results of our evaluations are in Table 2. As
we expected, the corpus frequency baseline does
very well. It is comparable to MixLDA for 10
and 15 words, and significantly better than MixLDA
for over 20 words. However, the Polylingual topic
model using only SIFT features and text is much bet-
ter than both. The trained MixLDA model has topics
with both image and text features, so when estimat-
ing topics given only an image, it estimates that it
was generated by topics that have a high proportion
of image features. Though it also estimates some

topics that have a mix of visual and text features,
being able to generate good text descriptions from
those topics, the topics that have less text features
will be mainly determined by the smoothing param-
eter – the uniform distribution, worse than guessing
the corpus distribution.

Out of the single attribute models, all except three
of the single feaure models were significantly higher
than corpus frequency on both precision and recall
at 10, 15, and 20 words. The exceptions are the two
color features and grayscale texture. For grayscale
texture, we had expected it would correlate well with
the material of the shoe; but either the low resolu-
tion of the images makes it difficult to distinguish
materials by their texture, or materials don’t corre-
late with the “less visual” features as much as we
expected. Interestingly, since the material of an item
tends to correlate strongly with other attributes such
as shape and color, so our model still generates cor-
rect descriptive words for material in many cases.

While neither color nor texture were useful fea-

tures on their own, RGB Texture did very well as a
single attribute, and was within signficance of both
the combined color and combined texture models.
This may be related to the fact that RGB Textons
have a larger number of visual terms than those other
features, 100 for each of the three color channels.
Unlike material, we observed that the color of an
object is often not mentioned in the human-written
caption (as seen in the examples in Table 1), or sev-
eral colors are described in the caption where only
one is seen in the image (seen in some of the exam-
ples in Table 3). We also observed that our system
generates very few color words.

The gradient and shape-based features have the
best single-attribute performance by far. Both SIFT
and HOG capture shape at local points, but while
SIFT features are invariant to differences in position
or scale, HOG features are more sensitive to the way
the item is oriented in the image. Although the cur-
vature features TriHOG and TriHog-Polar are nearly
as good as HOG on their own, combining the three
HOG features does not significantly improve perfor-
mance of the model over HOG alone.

Not all of the single-attribute models performed
as well as others, but there was no case where re-
moving one of the features improved the perfor-
mance of the combined model. The fewest num-
ber of image attributes that our model could use
and still get within significance to the full combined
model is three – SIFT, RGB Texture, and HOG.
However, we found that each image attribute does
slightly improve, the model, even if not by a signifi-
cant amount.

Our results on the handbags category of the
dataset are shown in Table 4. Although our scores
are not as high as they were in the shoes category,
the scores of the corpus frequency baseline are not
as high either, and our model does about as well over
the baseline in each category. But is worth reiterat-

8 Conclusion and Future Work

In conclusion, we have shown that the polylingual
topic model works well for modeling topically com-
parable images and related text, and obtain competi-
tive results for the image annotation task. Our model
is trained on noisy image captions from the web,
rather than hand-labeled data.

For future work, we would like to further adapt
the polylingual topic model for multi-modal data by
allowing some topics to be generated only by one
modality or the other. We are also interested in char-
acterizing the image annotations in order to generate
a single most likely annotation for different types of
features such as texture or color. Finally, we are in-
terested in extending this model to use with other do-
mains of data. For natural images, we could use im-
age segmentation algorithms to separate the object
of interest from the background of the image, or we
could use scene classifcation to cluster the training
images by their background scene and train seprate
models for each.
