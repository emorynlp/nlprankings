Abstract 

This report documents the details of the Trans-

literation Mining Shared Task that was run as 

a part of the Named Entities Workshop 

(NEWS 2010), an ACL 2010 workshop.  The 

shared task featured mining of name translite-

rations from the paired Wikipedia titles in 5 

different language pairs, specifically, between 

English and one of Arabic, Chinese, Hindi 

Russian and Tamil.  Totally 5 groups took part 

in this shared task, participating in multiple 

mining tasks in different languages pairs.  The 

methodology and the data sets used in this 

shared task are published in the Shared Task 

White Paper [Kumaran et al, 2010]. We meas-

ure and report 3 metrics on the submitted re-

sults to calibrate the performance of individual 

systems on a commonly available Wikipedia 

dataset.  We believe that the significant contri-

bution of this shared task is in (i) assembling a 

diverse set of participants working in the area 

of transliteration mining, (ii) creating a base-

line performance of transliteration mining sys-

tems in a set of diverse languages using com-

monly available Wikipedia data, and (iii) pro-

viding a basis for meaningful comparison and 

analysis of trade-offs between various algo-

rithmic approaches used in mining.  We be-

lieve that this shared task would complement 

the NEWS 2010 transliteration generation 

shared task, in enabling development of prac-

tical systems with a small amount of seed data 

in a given pair of languages. 

1 Introduction  

Proper names play a significant role in Machine 

Translation (MT) and Information Retrieval (IR) 

systems.  When the systems involve multiple 

languages, The MT and IR system rely on Ma-

chine Transliteration systems, as the proper 

names are not usually available in standard trans-

lation lexicons. The quality of the Machine 

Transliteration systems plays a significant part in 

determining the overall quality of the system, 

and hence, they are critical for most multilingual 

application systems.  The importance of Machine 

Transliteration systems has been well understood 

by the community, as evidenced by significant 

publication in this important area. 

While research over the last two decades has 

shown that reasonably good quality Machine 

Transliteration systems may be developed easily, 

they critically rely on parallel names corpora for 

their development.  The Machine Transliteration 

Shared Task of the NEWS 2009 workshop 

(NEWS 2009) has shown that many interesting 

approaches exist for Machine Transliteration, 

and about 10-25K parallel names is sufficient for 

most state of the art systems to provide a practic-

al solution for the critical need.  The traditional 

source for crosslingual parallel data – the bilin-

gual dictionaries – offer only limited support as 

they do not include proper names (other than 

ones of historical importance).  The statistical 

dictionaries, though they contain parallel names, 

do not have sufficient coverage, as they depend 

on some threshold statistical evidence
1
. New 

names and many variations of them are intro-

duced to the vocabulary of a language every day 

that need to be captured for any good quality 

end-to-end system such as MT or CLIR.   So 

there is a perennial need for harvesting parallel 

names data, to support end-user applications and 

systems well and accurately. 

This is the specific focus of the Transliteration 

Mining Shared Task in NEWS 2010 workshop 

(an ACL 2010 Workshop): To mine accurately 

parallel names from a popular, ubiquitous source, 

the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia exists in more than 

250 languages, and every Wikipedia article has a 

link to an equivalent article in other languages
2
.  

We focused on this specific resource – the Wiki-

pedia titles in multiple languages and the inter-

linking between them – as the source of parallel 

names.  Any successful mining of parallel names 

from title would signal copious availability of 

parallel names data, enabling transliteration gen-

eration systems in many languages of the world. 

                                                 
1
 In our experiments with Indian Express news corpo-

ra over 2 years shows that 80% of the names occur 

less than 5 times in the entire corpora. 
2
 Note that the titles contain concepts, events, dates, 

etc., in addition to names.  Even when the titles are 

names, parts of them may not be transliterations.

2 Transliteration Mining Shared Task 

In this section, we provide details of the shared 

task, and the datasets used for the task and results 

evaluation.  

2.1 Shared Task: Task Details 

The task featured in this shared task was to de-

velop a mining system for identifying single 

word transliteration pairs from the standard inter-

linked Wikipedia topics (aka, Wikipedia Inter-

Language Links, or WIL
3
) in one or more of the 

specified language pairs. The WIL’s link articles 

on the same topic in multiple languages, and are 

traditionally used as a parallel language resource 

for many natural language processing applica-

tions, such as Machine Translation, Crosslingual 

Search, etc.  Specific WIL’s of interest for our 

task were those that contained proper names – 

either wholly or partly – which can yield rich 

transliteration data.   

The task involved transliteration mining in the 

language pairs summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Language Pairs in the shared task 

 

Each WIL consisted of a topic in the source 

and target language pair, and the task was to 

identify parts of the topic (in the respective lan-

guage titles) that are transliterations of each oth-

er. A seed data set (of about 1K transliteration 

pairs) was provided for each language pair, and 

was the only resource to be used for developing a 

mining system.  The participants were expected 

to produce a paired list of source-target single 

word named entities, for every WIL provided. At 

the evaluation time, a random subset of WIL’s 

(about 1K WIL’s) in each language pair were 

hand labeled, and used to test the results pro-

duced by the participants.  

Participants were allowed to use only the 1K 

seed data provided by the organizers to produce 

“standard” results; this restriction is imposed to 

provide a meaningful way of comparing the ef-

“non-standard” runs were permitted where par-

ticipants were allowed to use more seed data or 

any language-specific resource available to them.

run results, only this seed data was to be used, 

though for non-standard runs, more data or other 

linguistics resources were allowed.

as test-set, and manually extracted the single 

word transliteration pairs associated with each of 

these WILs.  Please note that a given WIL can 

provide 0, 1 or more single-word transliteration 

pairs.  To keep the task simple, it was specified 

that only those transliterations would be consi-

dered correct that were clear transliterations 

word-per-word (morphological variations one or 

both sides are not considered transliterations) 

These 1K test set was be a subset of Wikipedia

2.3 Evaluation: 

The participants were expected to mine such sin-

gle-word transliteration data for every specific 

WIL, though the evaluation was done only 

against the randomly selected, hand-labeled test 

set.  A participant may submit a maximum of 10 

runs for a given language pair (including a min-

imum of one mandatory “standard” run).  There 

could be more standard runs, without exceeding 

10 (including the non-standard runs). 

At evaluation time, the task organizers 

checked every WIL in test set from among the 

user-provided results, to evaluate the quality of 

the submission on the 3 metrics described later.  

3 Evaluation Metrics 

We measured the quality of the mining task us-

ing the following measures:  

1. PrecisionCorrectTransliterations(PTrans) 
2. RecallCorrectTransliteration  (RTrans) 
3. F-ScoreCorrectTransliteration (FTrans).   

Please refer to the following figures for the ex-

planations: 
 

A = True Positives (TP) = Pairs that were identi-

fied as "Correct Transliterations" by the partici-

pant and were indeed "Correct Transliterations" 

as per the gold standard 

B = False Positives (FP) = Pairs that were identi-

fied as "Correct Transliterations" by the partici-

pant but they were "Incorrect Transliterations" as 

per the gold standard. 

C = False Negatives (FN) = Pairs that were iden-

tified as "Incorrect Transliterations" by the par-

ticipant but were actually "Correct Translitera-

tions" as per the gold standard. 

D = True Negatives (TN) = Pairs that were iden-

tified as "Incorrect Transliterations" by the par-

ticipant and were indeed "Incorrect Translitera-

tions" as per the gold standard.

  Table 9: Participants in the Shared Task  

The approaches used by the 4 participating 

groups can be broadly classified as discrimina-

tive and generation based approaches. Discri-

minative approaches treat the mining task as a 

binary classification problem where the goal is to 

build a classifier that identifies whether a given 

pair is a valid transliteration pair or not. Genera-

tion based approaches on the other hand generate 

transliterations for each word in the source title 

and measure their similarity with the candidate 

words in the target title. Below, we give a sum-

mary of the various participating systems. 

The CMIC team (Darwish et. al., 2010) used a 

generative transliteration model (HMM) to trans-

literate each word in the source title and com-

pared the transliterations with the words appear-

ing in the target title. For example, for a given 

word Ei in the source title if the model generates 

a transliteration Fj which appears in the target 

title then (Ei, Fj) are considered as transliteration 

pairs. The results are further improved by using 

phonetic conflation (PC) and iteratively training 

(IterT) the generative model using the mined 

transliteration pairs. For phonetic conflation a 

modified SOUNDEX scheme is used wherein 

vowels are discarded and phonetically similar 

characters are conflated. Both, phonetic confla-

tion and iterative training, led to an increase in 

24



recall which was better than the corresponding 

decline in precision. 

The Alberta team (Jiampojamarn et. al., 2010) 

fielded 5 different systems in the shared task. 

The first system uses a simple edit distance based 

method where a pair of strings is classified as a 

transliteration pair if the Normalized Edit Dis-

tance (NED) between them is above a certain 

threshold. To calculate the NED, the target lan-

guage string is first Romanized by replacing each 

target grapheme by the source grapheme having 

the highest conditional probability. These condi-

tional probabilities are obtained by aligning the 

seed set of transliteration pairs using an M2M-

aligner approach (Jiampojamarn et. al., 2007). 

The second system uses a SVM based discrimin-

ative classifier trained using an improved feature 

representation (BK 2007) (Bergsma and Kon-

drak, 2007). These features include all substring 

pairs up to a maximum length of three as ex-

tracted from the aligned word pairs. The transli-

teration pairs in the seed data provided for the 

shared task were used as positive examples. The 

negative examples were obtained by generating 

all possible source-target pairs in the seed data 

and taking those pairs which are not translitera-

tions but have a longest common subsequence 

ratio above a certain threshold. One drawback of 

this system is that longer substrings cannot be 

used due to the combinatorial explosion in the 

number of unique features as the substring length 

increases. To overcome this problem they pro-

pose a third system which uses a standard n-gram 

string kernel (StringKernel) that implicitly em-

beds a string in a feature space that has one co-

ordinate for each unique n-gram (Shawe-Taylor 

and Cristianini, 2004). The above 3 systems are 

essentially discriminative systems. In addition, 

they propose a generation based approach (DI-

RECTL+) which determines whether the gener-

ated transliteration pairs of a source word and 

target word are similar to a given candidate pair. 

They use a state-of-the-art online discriminative 

sequence prediction model based on many-to-

many alignments, further augmented by the in-

corporation of joint n-gram features (Jiampoja-

marn et. al., 2010). Apart from the four systems 

described above, they propose an additional sys-

tem for English Chinese, wherein they formulate 

the mining task as a matching problem (Match-

ing) and greedily extract the pairs with highest 

similarity. The similarity is calculated using the 

alignments obtained by training a generation 

model (Jiampojamarn et. al., 2007) using the 

seed data. 

The IBM Cairo team (Noemans et. al., 2010) 

proposed a generation based approach which 

takes inspiration from Phrase Based Statistical 

Machine Translation (PBSMT) and learns a cha-

racter-to-character alignment model between the 

source and target language using GIZA++. This 

alignment table is then represented using a finite 

state automaton (FSA) where the input is the 

source character and the output is the target cha-

racter. For a given word in the source title, can-

didate transliterations are generated using this 

FST and are compared with the words in the tar-

get title. In addition they also submitted a base-

line run which used phonetic edit distance. 

The Groningen (Nabende et. al., 2010) team 

used a generation based approach that uses pair 

HMMs (P-HMM) to find the similarity between 

a given pair of source and target strings. The 

proposed variant of pair HMM uses transition 

parameters that are distinct between each of the 

edit states and emission parameters that are also 

distinct. The three edits states are substitution 

state, deletion state and insertion state. The pa-

rameters of the pair HMM are estimated using 

the Baum-Welch Expectation Maximization al-

gorithm (Baum et. al. 1970).  

Finally, as a reference, results of a previously 

published system – MINT (Udupa et. al., 2009) – 

were also included in this report as a reference.  

MINT is a large scalable mining system for min-

ing transliterations from comparable corpora, 

essentially multilingual news articles in the same 

timeline.  While MINT takes a two step approach 

– first aligning documents based on content simi-

larity, and subsequently mining transliterations 

based on a name similarity model – for this task, 

only the transliteration mining step is employed. 

For mining transliterations a logistic function 

based similarity model (LFS) trained discrimina-

tively with the seed parallel names data was em-

ployed.  It should be noted here that the MINT 

algorithm was used as-is for mining translitera-

tions from Wikipedia paired titles, with no fine-

tuning.  While the standard runs used only the 

data provided by the organizers, the non-standard 

runs used about 15K (Seed
+
) parallel names be-

tween the languages. 

5 Results & Analysis 

The results for EnAr, EnCh, EnHi, EnRu and 

EnTa are summarized in Tables 10, 11, 12, 13 

and 14 respectively. The results clearly indicate 

that there is no single approach which performs 

well across all languages. In fact, there is even 

25



no single genre (discriminative v/s generation 

based) which performs well across all languages. 

We, therefore, do a case by case analysis of the 

results and highlight some important observa-

tions. 

 The discriminative classifier using string 
kernels proposed by Jiampojamarn et. al. 

(2010) consistently performed well in all the 

4 languages that it was tested on. Specifical-

ly, it gave the best performance for EnHi and 

EnTa. 

 The simple discriminative approach based on 
Normalized Edit Distance (NED) gave the 

best result for EnRu. Further, the authors re-

port that the results of StringKernel and BK-

2007 were not significantly better than NED. 

 The use of phonetic conflation consistently 
performed better than the case when phonet-

ic conflation was not used.  

 The results for EnCh are significantly lower 
when compared to the results for other lana-

guge pairs. This shows that mining translite-

ration pairs between alphabetic languages 

(EnRu, EnAr, EnHi, EnTa) is relatively easi-

er as compared to the case when one of the 

languages is non-alphabetic (EnCh) 

6 Plans for the Future Editions 

This shared task was designed as a comple-

mentary shared task to the popular NEWS 

Shared Tasks on Transliteration Generation; suc-

cessful mining of transliteration pairs demon-

strated in this shared task would be a viable 

source for generating data for developing a state 

of the art transliteration generation system.    

We intend to extend the scope of the mining in 

3 different ways: (i) extend mining to more lan-

guage pairs, (ii) allow identification of near 

transliterations where there may be changes do to 

the morphology of the target (or the source) lan-

guages, and, (iii) demonstrate an end-to-end 

transliteration system that may be developed 

starting with a small seed corpora of, say, 1000 

paired names.
