Abstract

Current metrics for evaluating machine trans-
lation quality have the huge drawback that
they require human-quality reference transla-
tions. We propose a truly automatic evalua-
tion metric based on IBM1 lexicon probabili-
ties which does not need any reference transla-
tions. Several variants of IBM1 scores are sys-
tematically explored in order to find the most
promising directions. Correlations between
the new metrics and human judgments are cal-
culated on the data of the third, fourth and fifth
shared tasks of the Statistical Machine Trans-
lation Workshop. Five different European lan-
guages are taken into account: English, Span-
ish, French, German and Czech. The results
show that the IBM1 scores are competitive
with the classic evaluation metrics, the most
promising being IBM1 scores calculated on
morphemes and POS-4grams.

1 Introduction

Currently used evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005), etc. are based on the comparison between
human reference translations and the automatically
generated hypotheses in the target language to be
evaluated. While this scenario helps in the design
of machine translation systems, it has two major
drawbacks. The first one is the practical criticism
that using reference translations is inefficient and ex-
pensive: in real-life situations, the quality of ma-
chine translation must be evaluated without having
to pay humans for producing reference translations
first. The second criticism is methodological: in

using reference translation, the problem of evalu-
ating translation quality (e.g., completeness, order-
ing, domain fit, etc.) is transformed into a kind of
paraphrase evaluation in the target language, which
is a very difficult problem itself. In addition, the
set of selected references always represents only a
small subset of all good translations. To remedy
these drawbacks, we propose a truly automatic eval-
uation metric which is based on the IBM1 lexicon
scores (Brown et al., 1993).

The inclusion of IBM1 scores in translation sys-
tems has shown experimentally to improve transla-
tion quality (Och et al., 2003). They also have been
used for confidence estimation for machine transla-
tion (Blatz et al., 2003). To the best of our knowl-
edge, these scores have not yet been used as an eval-
uation metric.

We carry out a systematic comparison between
several variants of IBM1 scores. The Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficients on the document (sys-
tem) level between the IBM1 metrics and the hu-
man ranking are computed on the English, French,
Spanish, German and Czech texts generated by var-
ious translation systems in the framework of the
third (Callison-Burch et al., 2008), fourth (Callison-
Burch et al., 2009) and fifth (Callison-Burch et al.,
2010) shared translation tasks.

2 IBM1 scores

The IBM1 model is a bag-of-word translation model
which gives the sum of all possible alignment proba-
bilities between the words in the source sentence and
the words in the target sentence. Brown et al. (1993)
defined the IBM1 probability score for a translation

99



pair fJ
1

and eI
1

in the following way:

P (fJ1 |e
I
1) =

1

(I + 1)J

J∏

j=1

I∑

i=0

p(fj |ei) (1)

where fJ
1

is the source language sentence of length
J and eI

1
is the target language sentence of length I .

As it is a conditional probability distribution, we
investigated both directions as evaluation metrics. In
order to avoid frequent confusions about what is the
source and what the target language, we defined our
scores in the following way:

• source-to-hypothesis (sh) IBM1 score:

IBM1sh =
1

(H + 1)S

S∏

j=1

H∑

i=0

p(sj|hi) (2)

• hypothesis-to-source (hs) IBM1 score:

IBM1hs =
1

(S + 1)H

H∏

i=1

S∑

j=0

p(hi|sj) (3)

where sj are the words of the original source lan-
guage sentence, S is the length of this sentence, hi
are the words of the target language hypothesis, and
H is the length of this hypothesis.

In addition to the standard IBM1 scores calculated
on words, we also investigated:

• MIBM1 scores – IBM1 scores of word mor-
phemes in each direction;

• PnIBM1 scores – IBM1 scores of POS n-grams
in each direction.

A parallel bilingual corpus for the desired lan-
guage pair and a tool for training the IBM1 model
are required in order to obtain IBM1 probabilities
p(fj|ei). For the POS n-gram scores, appropriate
POS taggers for each of the languages are necessary.
The POS tags cannot be only basic but must have
all details (e.g. verb tenses, cases, number, gender,
etc.). For the morpheme scores, a tool for splitting
words into morphemes is necessary.

3 Experiments on WMT 2008, WMT 2009
and WMT 2010 test data

3.1 Experimental set-up

The IBM1 probabilities necessary for the IBM1
scores are learnt using the WMT 2010 News
Commentary bilingual corpora consisting of the
Spanish-English, French-English, German-English
and Czech-English parallel texts. Spanish, French,
German and English POS tags were produced using
the TreeTagger1, and the Czech texts are tagged us-
ing the COMPOST tagger (Spoustová et al., 2009).
The morphemes for all languages are obtained us-
ing the Morfessor tool (Creutz and Lagus, 2005).
The tool is corpus-based and language-independent:
it takes a text as input and produces a segmenta-
tion of the word forms observed in the text. The
obtained results are not strictly linguistic, however
they often resemble a linguistic morpheme segmen-
tation. Once a morpheme segmentation has been
learnt from some text, it can be used for segment-
ing new texts. In our experiments, the splitting are
learnt from the training corpus used for the IBM1
lexicon probabilities. The obtained segmentation is
then used for splitting the corresponding source texts
and hypotheses. Detailed corpus statistics are shown
in Table 1.

Using the obtained IBM1 probabilities of words,
morphemes and POS n-grams, the scores de-
scribed in Section 2 are calculated for the
Spanish-English, French-English, German-English
and Czech-English translation outputs from each
translation direction. For each of the IBM1 scores,
the system level Spearman correlation coefficients ρ
with the human ranking are calculated for each doc-
ument. In total, 32 correlation coefficients are ob-
tained for each score – four English outputs from
the WMT 2010 task, four from the WMT 2009 and
eight from the WMT 2008 task, together with six-
teen outputs in other four target languages. The ob-
tained correlation results were then summarised into
the following three values:

• mean
a correlation coefficient averaged over all trans-
lation outputs;

• rank>
percentage of documents where the particular
score has better correlation than the other IBM1
scores;

score has better or equal correlation than the
other IBM1 scores.

3.2 Comparison of IBM1 scores

The first step towards deciding which IBM1 score
to submit to the WMT 2011 evaluation task was a
comparison of the average correlations i.e. mean
values. These values for each of the IBM1 scores
are presented in Table 2. The left column shows
average correlations of the source-hypothesis (sh)
scores, and the right one of the hypothesis-source
(hs) scores.

mean IBM1sh IBM1hs
words 0.066 0.308
morphemes 0.227 0.445
POS tags 0.006 0.337
POS-2grams 0.058 0.337
POS-3grams 0.172 0.376
POS-4grams 0.196 0.442

Table 2: Average correlations of source-hypothesis (left
column) and hypothesis-source (right column) IBM1
scores.

It can be seen that the morpheme, POS-3gram and
POS-4gram scores have the best correlations in both
directions. Apart from that, it can be observed that
all the hs scores have better correlations than sh

scores. Therefore, all the further experiments will
deal only with the hs scores, and the subscript hs is
omitted.

In the next step, all the hs scores are sorted ac-
cording to each of the three values described in
Section 3.1, i.e. average correlation mean, rank>
and rank≥, and the results are shown in Table 3.
The most promising scores according to each of
the three values are morpheme score MIBM1, POS-
3gram score P3IBM1 and POS-4gram score P4IBM1.

3.2.1 Combined IBM1 scores

The last experiment was to combine the most
promising IBM1 scores in order to see if the correla-
tion with human rankings can be further improved.
In general, a combined IBM1 score is defined as
arithmetic mean of various individual IBM1hs scores
described in Section 2:

COMBIBM1 =
K∑

k=1

wk · IBM1k (4)

The following combinations were investigated:

• P1234IBM1
combination of all POS n-gram scores;

• MP1234IBM1
combination of all POS n-gram scores and the
morpheme score;

• MP34IBM1
combination of the most promising individual
scores, i.e. POS-3gram, POS-4gram and mor-
pheme scores;

101



mean rank> rank≥
0.445 morphemes 60.6 POS-4grams 71.3 POS-4grams
0.442 POS-4grams 54.4 morphemes 61.3 POS-3grams
0.376 POS-3grams 50.6 POS-3grams 56.3 morphemes
0.337 POS-2grams 39.4 POS tags 48.1 POS tags
0.337 POS tags 36.3 words 43.7 POS-2grams
0.308 words 35.6 POS-2grams 42.5 words

Table 3: IBM1hs scores sorted by average correlation (column 1), rank> value (column 2) and rank≥ value (column
3). The most promising scores are those calculated on morphemes (MIBM1), POS-3grams (P3IBM1) and POS-4grams
(P4IBM1).

• MP4IBM1
combination of the two most promising indi-
vidual scores, i.e. POS-4gram score and mor-
pheme score.

For each of the scores, two variants were investi-
gated, with and without (i.e. with uniform) weights
wk. The weigths were choosen proportionally to
the average correlation of each individual score. Ta-
ble 4 contains average correlations for all combined
scores, together with the weight values.

combined score mean
P1234IBM1 0.403

+weights (0.15, 0.15, 0.3, 0.4) 0.414
MP1234IBM1 0.466
+weights (0.2, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5) 0.486
MP34IBM1 0.480

+weights (0.25, 0.25, 0.5) 0.498
MP4IBM1 0.494

+weights (0.4, 0.6) 0.496

Table 4: Average correlations of the investigated IBM1hs
combinations. The weight values are choosen accord-
ing to the average correlation of the particular individual
IBM1 score.

The POS n-gram combination alone does not yield
any improvement over the best individual scores.
Introduction of the morpheme score increases the
average correlation, especially when only the best
n-gram scores are chosen. Apart from that, intro-
ducing weights improves the average correlation for
each of the combined scores.

The final step in our experiments consists of rank-
ing the weighted combined scores. The rank> and
rank≥ values for these scores are presented in Ta-

ble 5. According to the rank> values, the MP4IBM1
score clearly outperforms all other scores. This
score also has the highest mean value together with
the MP34IBM1 score. As for rank≥ values, all
morpheme-POS scores have similar values signifi-
cantly outperforming the P1234IBM1 score.

combined score rank> rank≥
P1234IBM1 25.0 36.4
MP1234IBM1 44.8 68.7
MP34IBM1 39.6 64.6
MP4IBM1 55.2 65.7

Table 5: rank> (column 1) and rank≥ (column 2) values
of the weighted IBM1hs combinations.

Following all these observations, we decided to
submit the MP4IBM1 score to the WMT 2011 evalu-
ation task.

4 Conclusions and outlook

The results presented in this article show that the
IBM1 scores have the potential to be used as replace-
ment of current evaluation metrics based on refer-
ence translations. Especially the scores abstracting
away from word surface particularities (i.e. vocabu-
lary, domain) based on morphemes, POS-3grams and
4grams show a high average correlation of about 0.5
(the average correlation of the BLEU score on the
same data is 0.566).

An important point for future optimisation is to
investigate effects of the selection of training data
for the IBM1 models (and its similarity to the train-
ing data of the involved statistical translation sys-
tems). Furthermore, investigation of how to assign
the weights for combining the corresponding indi-

102



vidual scores, as well as of the possible impact of
different morpheme splittings should be carried out.
Other direction for future work is combination with
other features (i.e. POS language models).

This method is currently being tested and fur-
ther developed in the framework of the TARAXÜ
project2. In this project, three industry and one re-
search partners develop a hybrid machine transla-
tion architecture that satisfies current industry needs,
which includes a number of large-scale evalua-
tion rounds involving various languages: English,
French, German, Czech, Spanish, Russian, Chinese
and Japanese. By the time of writing this article, the
first human evaluation round in TARAXÜ on a pilot
set of about 7000 sentences is running. The metrics
proposed in this paper will be tested on the TARAXÜ
data as soon as they are available. First results will
be reported in the presentation of this paper.
