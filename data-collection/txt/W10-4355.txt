Abstract

We develop a method to detect erroneous
interpretation results of user utterances
by exploiting utterance histories of indi-
vidual users in spoken dialogue systems
that were deployed for the general pub-
lic and repeatedly utilized. More specifi-
cally, we classify barge-in utterances into
correctly and erroneously interpreted ones
by using features of individual users’ utter-
ance histories such as their barge-in rates
and estimated automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) accuracies. Online detection
is enabled by making these features ob-
tainable without any manual annotation
or labeling. We experimentally compare
classification accuracies for several cases
when an ASR confidence measure is used
alone or in combination with the features
based on the user’s utterance history. The
error reduction rate was 15% when the ut-
terance history was used.

1 Introduction

Many researchers have tackled the problem of
automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors by
developing ASR confidence measures based on
utterance-level (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000)
or dialogue-level information (Litman et al., 1999;
Walker et al., 2000; Hazen et al., 2000). Especially
in systems deployed for the general public such as
those of (Komatani et al., 2005; Raux et al., 2006),
the systems need to correctly detect interpretation
errors caused by various utterances made by var-
ious users, including novices. Error detection us-
ing individual user models would be a promising
way of improving performance in such systems

because users often access them repeatedly (Ko-
matani et al., 2007).

We choose to detect interpretation errors of
barge-in utterances, mostly caused by ASR er-
rors, as a task for showing the effectiveness of
the user’s utterance histories. We try to improve
the accuracy of classifying barge-in utterances into
correctly and erroneously interpreted ones with-
out any manual labeling. By classifying utter-
ances accurately, the system can reduce erroneous
responses caused by the errors and unnecessary
confirmations. Here, a “barge-in utterance” is a
user utterance that interrupts the system’s prompt.
In this situation, the system stops its prompt and
starts recognizing the user utterance.

In this study, we combine the ASR confidence
measure with features obtained from the user’s ut-
terance history, i.e., the estimated ASR accuracy
and the barge-in rate, to detect interpretation er-
rors of barge-in utterances. We show that the fea-
tures are still effective when they are used together
with the ASR confidence measure, which is usu-
ally used to detect erroneous ASR results. The
characteristics of our method are summarized as
follows:

1. The user’s utterance history used as his/her
profile: The user’s current barge-in rate and
ASR accuracy are used for error detection.

2. Online user modeling: We try to obtain the
user profiles listed above without any man-
ual labeling after the dialogue has been com-
pleted. This means that the system can im-
prove its performance while it is deployed.

In our earlier report (Komatani and Rudnicky,
2009), we defined the estimated ASR accuracy
and showed that it is helpful in improving the ac-
curacy of classifying barge-in utterances into cor-
rectly and erroneously interpreted ones, by using it
in conjunction with the user’s barge-in rate. In this

report, we verify our approach when the ASR con-
fidence measure is also incorporated into it. Thus,
we show the individual user’s utterance history is
helpful as a user profile and works as prior infor-
mation for the ASR confidence.

2 Barge-in Utterance and its Errors

Barge-in utterances were often incorrectly inter-
preted mainly because of ASR errors in our data
as shown in Table 1. The table lists the ASR
accuracy per utterance for two cases: when the
system prompts were played to the end (denoted
as “w/o barge-in”) and when the system prompts
were barged in (“w/ barge-in”). Here, an utter-
ance is assumed to be correct only when all con-
tent words in the utterance are correctly recog-
nized; one is counted as an error if any word in it
is misrecognized. Table 1 shows that barge-in ut-
terances amounted to 26.2% (7,193/27,499) of all
utterances, and half of those utterances contained
ASR errors in their content words.

This result implies that many false barge-ins oc-
curred despite the user’s intention. Specifically,
the false barge-ins included instances when back-
ground noises were incorrectly regarded as barge-
ins and the system’s prompt stopped. Such in-
stances often occur when the user accesses the
system using mobile phones in crowded places.
Breathing and whispering were also prone to be
incorrectly regarded as barge-ins. Moreover, dis-
fluency in one utterance may be unintentionally di-
vided into two portions, which causes further mis-
recognitions and unexpected system actions. The
abovementioned phenomena, except background
noises, are caused by the user’s unfamiliarity with
the system. That is, some novice users are not
unaware of the timing at which to utter, and this
causes the system to misrecognize the utterance.
On the other hand, users who have already become
accustomed to the system often use the barge-
in functions intentionally and, accordingly, make
their dialogues more efficient.

The results in Table 2 show the relationship be-
tween barge-in rate per user and the correspond-
ing ASR accuracies of barge-in utterances. We

here ignore a small number of users whose barge-
in rates were greater than 0.8, which means al-
most all utterances were barge-ins, because most
of their utterances were misrecognized because
of severe background noises and accordingly they
gave up using the system. We thus focus on users
whose barge-in rates were less than 0.8. The ASR
accuracy of barge-in utterances was high for users
who frequently barged-in. This suggests that the
barge-ins were intentional. On the other hand, the
ASR accuracies of barge-in utterances were less
than 20% for users whose barge-in rates were less
than 0.4. This suggests that the barge-ins of these
users were unintentional.

A user study conducted by Rose and
Kim (2003) revealed that there are many more
disfluencies when users barge in compared with
when users wait until the system prompt ends.
Because such disfluencies and resulting utterance
fragments are parts of human speech, it is difficult
to select erroneous utterances to be rejected by
using a classifier that distinguishes speech from
noise on the basis of the Gaussian Mixture Model
(Lee et al., 2004). These errors cannot be detected
by using only bottom-up information obtained
from single utterances such as acoustic features
and ASR results.

To cope with the problem, we use individual
users’ utterance histories as their profiles. More
specifically, we use each user’s average barge-in
rate and ASR accuracy from the time the user
started using the system until the current utterance.
The barge-in rate intuitively corresponds to the de-
gree to which the user is accustomed to using the
system, especially to using its barge-in function.
That is, this reflects the tendency shown in Table
2; that is, the ASR accuracy of barge-in utterances
is higher for users whose barge-in rates are higher.
Each user’s ASR accuracy also indicates the user’s
habituation. This corresponds to an empirical ten-
dency that ASR accuracies of more accustomed

users are higher (Komatani et al., 2007; Levow,
2003). To account for another fact that some ex-
pert users have low barge-in rates, and, accord-
ingly, not all expert users barge in frequently (Ko-
matani et al., 2007), we use both the user’s barge-
in rate and ASR accuracy to represent degree of
habituation, and verify their effectiveness as prior
information for detecting erroneous interpretation
results when they are used together with an ASR
confidence measure.

To obtain the user’s ASR accuracy without any
manual labeling, we exploit certain dialogue pat-
terns indicating that ASR results at certain po-
sitions are reliable. For example, Sudoh and
Nakano (2005) proposed a “post-dialogue con-
fidence scoring” in which ASR results corre-
sponding to the user’s intention upon dialogue
completion are assumed to be correct and are
used for confidence scoring. Bohus and Rud-
nicky (2007) proposed “implicitly supervised
learning” in which user responses following the
system’s explicit confirmations are used for confi-
dence scoring. If the ASR results can be regarded
as reliable after the dialogue, machine learning al-
gorithms can use them as teacher signals. This ap-
proach does not need any manual labeling or tran-
scription, a task which requires much time and la-
bor when spoken dialogue systems are being de-
veloped. We focus on users’ affirmative and neg-
ative responses to the system’s explicit confirma-
tions, and estimated the user’s ASR accuracy on
the basis of his or her history of responses (Ko-
matani and Rudnicky, 2009). This estimated ASR
accuracy can be also used as an online feature rep-
resenting a user’s utterance history.

3 Detecting Errors by using the User’s
Utterance History

We detect interpretation errors of barge-in utter-
ances by using the following three information
sources:

1. the current user’s barge-in rate,

2. the current user’s ASR accuracy, and

3. ASR confidence of the current utterance.

The error detection method is depicted in Figure
1. Barge-in rate and ASR accuracy are accumu-
lated and averaged from the beginning until the
current utterance and are used as each user’s ut-
terance history. Then, at every point a user makes
an utterance, the barge-in utterances are classified
into correctly or erroneously interpreted ones by
using a logistic regression function:

P =
1

1 + exp(−(a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + b)) ,
(1)

where x1, x2 and x3 denote the barge-in rate, the
ASR accuracy until the current utterance, and the
ASR confidence measure of the current utterance,
respectively. Coefficients ai and b are determined
by 10-fold cross validation on evaluation data. In
the following subsections, we describe how to ob-
tain these features.

3.1 Barge-In Rate

The barge-in rate is defined as the ratio of the num-
ber of barge-in utterances to all the user’s utter-
ances until the current utterance. Note that the
current utterance itself is included in this calcula-
tion. We confirmed that the barge-in rate changes
as the user becomes accustomed to the system

291



U1: 205. (Number 100)
S1: Will you use bus number 100?
U2: No. (No)
S2: Please tell me your bus stop or bus route number.
U3: Nishioji Matsu... [disfluency] (Rejected)
S3: Please tell me your bus stop or bus route number.
U4: From Nishioji Matsubara. (From Nishioji Matsubara)
S4: Do you get on a bus at Nishioji Matsubara?
U5: Yes. (Yes)

Initial characters ‘U’ and ‘S’ denote the user and system utterance.
A string in parentheses denotes the ASR result of the utterance.

Figure 2: Example dialogue

(Komatani et al., 2007). To take these tempo-
ral changes into consideration, we set a window
when calculating the rate (Komatani et al., 2008).
That is, when the window width is N , the rate is
calculated on the basis of only the last N utter-
ances, and utterances before those ones are dis-
carded. When the window width exceeds the total
number of utterances by the user, the barge-in rate
is calculated on the basis of all the user’s utter-
ances. Thus, when the width exceeds 2,838, the
maximum number of utterances made by one user
in our data, the barge-in rates equal the average
rates of all utterances by the user.

3.2 ASR Accuracy

ASR accuracy is calculated per utterance. It is de-
fined as the ratio of the number of correctly rec-
ognized utterances to all the user’s utterances until
the previous utterance. Note that the current utter-
ance is not included in this calculation. The “cor-
rectly recognized” utterance denotes a case when
every content word in the ASR result of the ut-
terance was correctly recognized and no content
word was incorrectly inserted. The ASR accuracy
of the user’s initial utterance is regarded as 0, be-
cause there is no utterance before it. We do not set
any window when calculating the ASR accuracies,
because classification accuracy did not improve as
a result of setting one (Komatani and Rudnicky,
2009). This is because each users’ ASR accura-
cies tend to converge faster than the barge-in rates
do (Komatani et al., 2007), and the changes in the
ASR accuracies are relatively small in comparison
with those of the barge-in rates.

We use two kinds of ASR accuracies:

1. actual ASR accuracy and

2. estimated ASR accuracy (Komatani and Rud-
nicky, 2009).

The actual ASR accuracy is calculated from man-
ual transcriptions for investigating the upper limit
of improvement of the classification accuracy
when ASR accuracy is used. Thus, it cannot be
obtained online because manual transcriptions are
required.

The estimated ASR accuracy is calculated on
the basis of the user’s utterance history. This is
obtainable online, that is, without the need for
manual transcriptions after collecting the utter-
ances. We focus on users’ affirmative or negative
responses following the system’s explicit confir-
mations, such as “Leaving from Kyoto Station. Is
that correct?” To estimate the accuracy, we make
three assumptions as follows:

1. The ASR results of the users’ affirmative or
negative responses are correctly recognized.
This assumption will be verified in Section
4.2.

2. A user utterance corresponding to the content
of the affirmative responses is also correctly
recognized, because the user affirms the sys-
tem’s explicit confirmation for it.

3. The remaining utterances are not correctly
recognized. This corresponds to when users
do not just say “no” in response to explicit
confirmations with incorrect content and in-
stead use other expressions.

To summarize the above, we assume that the
ASR results of the following utterances are cor-
rect: an affirmative response, its corresponding ut-
terance which is immediately preceded by it, and

a negative response. All other utterances are as-
sumed to be incorrect. We thus calculate the user’s
estimated ASR accuracy as follows:

(Estimated ASR accuracy)

=
2 × (#affirmatives) + (#negatives)

(#all utterances)
(2)

Here is an example of the calculation for the ex-
ample dialogue shown in Figure 2. U2 is a neg-
ative response, and U5 is an affirmative response.
When the dialogue reaches the point of U5, U2
and U5 are regarded as correctly recognized on the
basis of the first assumption. Next, U4 is regarded
as correct on the basis of the second assumption,
because the explicit confirmation for it (S4) was
affirmed by the user as U5. Then, the remaining
U1 and U3 are regarded as misrecognized on the
basis of the third assumption. As a result, the esti-
mated ASR accuracy at U5 is 60%.

The estimated ASR accuracy is updated for ev-
ery affirmative or negative response by the user.
For a neither affirmative nor negative response, the
latest estimated accuracy before it was used in-
stead.

3.3 ASR Confidence Measure

We use an ASR confidence measure calculated per
utterance. Specifically, we use the one derived
from the ASR engine in the Voice Web Server, a
product of Nuance Communications, Inc.1

Table 3 shows the distribution of ASR confi-
dence measures for barge-in utterances. By us-
ing this ASR confidence, even a naive method can
have high classification accuracy (90.8%) in which
just one threshold (θ = 0.516) is set and utter-
ances whose confidence measure is greater than

the threshold are accepted. This accuracy is re-
garded as the baseline.

4 Experimental Evaluation

4.1 Data

We used data collected by the Kyoto City Bus In-
formation System (Komatani et al., 2005). This
system locates a bus that a user wants to ride and
tells the user how long it will be before the bus
arrives. The system was accessible to the public
by telephone. It adopted the safest strategy to pre-
vent erroneous responses; that is, it makes explicit
confirmations for every user utterance except for
affirmative or negative responses such as “Yes” or
“No”.

We used 27,499 utterances that did not involve
calls whose phone numbers were not recorded or
those the system developer used for debugging.
The data contained 7,988 valid calls from 671
users. Out of these, there were 7,193 barge-in ut-
terances (Table 1). All the utterances were manu-
ally transcribed for evaluation; human annotators
decided whether every content word in the ASR
results was correctly recognized or not.

The phone numbers of most of the calls were
recorded, and we assumed that each number cor-
responded to one individual. Most of the numbers
were those of mobile phones, which are usually
not shared; thus, the assumption seems reasonable.

4.2 Verifying Assumption in Calculating
Estimated ASR Accuracy

We confirmed our assumption that the ASR re-
sults of affirmative or negative responses follow-
ing explicit confirmations are correct. We clas-
sified the user utterances into affirmatives, nega-
tives, and other, and calculated the ASR accura-
cies (precision rates) per utterance as shown in Ta-
ble 4. Affirmatives include hai (‘yes’), soudesu
(‘that’s right’), OK, etc; and negatives include iie
(‘no’), chigaimasu (‘I don’t agree’), dame (‘No
good’), etc. The table indicates that the ASR ac-
curacies of affirmatives and negatives were high.
One of the reasons for the high accuracy was that

mated ASR accuracy

these utterances are much shorter than other con-
tent words, so they were less confused with other
content words. Another reason was that the system
often gave help messages such as “Please answer
yes or no.”

We then analyzed the correlation between the
actual ASR accuracy and the estimated ASR accu-
racy based on Equation 2. We plotted the two ASR
accuracies (Figure 3) for 26,231 utterances made
after at least one affirmative/negative response by
the user. The correlation coefficient between them
was 0.806. Although the assumption that all ASR
results of affirmative/negative responses are cor-
rect might be rather strong, the estimated ASR ac-
curacy had a high correlation with the actual ASR
accuracy.

4.3 Comparing Classification Accuracies
When the Used Features Vary

We investigated the classification accuracy of the
7,193 barge-in utterances. The classification accu-
racies are shown in Table 5 in descending order for
various sets of features xi used as input into Equa-
tion 1. The conditions for when barge-in rates are
used also show the window width w for the high-
est classification accuracy. The mean average er-
ror (MAE) is also listed, which is the average of
the differences between an output of the logistic
regression function Xj and a reference label man-
ually given X̂j (0 or 1):

tributes. Regarding Condition (12) in Table 5 (ma-
jority baseline), the MAE was calculated by as-
suming Xj = 0.456, which is the average ASR
accuracy, for all j. Its classification accuracy is
the majority baseline; that is, all interpretation re-
sults are regarded as incorrect.

4.4 Experimental Results

The results are shown in Table 5. First, we can see
that the classification accuracies for Conditions (1)
to (6) are high because the ASR confidence mea-
sure (CM) works well (Table 3). The MAEs are
also small, which means the outputs of the logis-
tic regression functions are good indicators of the
reliability of the interpretation result.

Upon comparing Condition (6) with Conditions
(1) to (5), we can see that the classification accura-
cies improve as a result of incorporating the user’s
utterance histories such as barge-in rates and ASR
accuracies. Table 6 lists p-values of the differences
when the barge-in rate and the estimated ASR ac-
curacy were used in addition to the CM. The sig-
nificance test was based on the McNemar test. As
shown in the table, all the differences were statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.01). That is, it was exper-
imentally shown that these utterance histories of
users are different information sources from those
of single utterances and that they contribute to
improving the classification accuracy even when
used together with ASR confidence measures. The
relative improvement in the error reduction rate
was 15.2% between Conditions (2) and (6), that is,
by adding the barge-in rate and the estimated ASR
accuracy, both of which can be obtained without
manual labeling.

Figure 4 shows the results in more detail; the
classification accuracies for Conditions (1), (2),
(4), and (6) are shown for various window widths.
Under Condition (6), the classification accuracy
does not depend on the window width because the
barge-in rate is not used. Under Conditions (1),
(2), and (4), the accuracies depend on the window
width for the barge-in rate and are highest when
the width is 30 or 40. These results show the effec-
tiveness of the window, which indicates that tem-
poral changes in user behaviors should be taken
into consideration, and match those of our earlier
reports (Komatani et al., 2008; Komatani and Rud-
nicky, 2009): the user’s utterance history becomes
effective after he/she uses the system about ten
times because the average number of utterances
per dialogue is around five.

By comparing Conditions (2) and (4), we can
see that the classification accuracy improves af-
ter adding the estimated ASR accuracy to Condi-
tion (4). This shows that the estimated ASR accu-
racy also contributes to improving the classifica-
tion accuracy. By comparing Conditions (1) and
(2), we can see that Condition (1), in which the ac-

tual ASR accuracy is used, outperforms Condition
(2), in which the estimated one is used. This sug-
gests that the classification accuracy, whose upper
limit is Condition (1), can be improved by making
the ASR accuracy estimation shown in Section 3.2
more accurate.

5 Conclusion

We described a method of detecting interpretation
errors of barge-in utterances by exploiting the ut-
terance histories of individual users, such as their
barge-in rate and ASR accuracy. The estimated
ASR accuracy as well as the barge-in rate and
the ASR confidence measure is obtainable online.
Thus, the detection method does not require man-
ual labeling. We showed through experiments that
the utterance history of each user is helpful for de-
tecting interpretation errors even when the ASR
confidence measure is used.

The proposed method is effective in systems
that are repeatedly used by the same user over 10
times, as indicated by the results of Figure 4. It is
also assumed that the user’s ID is known (we used
their telephone number). The part of our method
that estimates the user’s ASR accuracy assumes
that the system’s dialogue strategy is to make ex-
plicit confirmations about every utterance by the
user and that all affirmative and negative responses
followed by explicit confirmations are correctly
recognized. Our future work will attempt to re-
duce or remove these assumptions and to enhance
the generality of our method. The experimental

295



result was shown only in the Kyoto City Bus do-
main, in which dialogues were rather well struc-
tured. Experimental evaluations in other domains
will assure the generality.
