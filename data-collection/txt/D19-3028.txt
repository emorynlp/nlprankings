Abstract

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been
widely employed in industry to address vari-
ous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, many engineers find it a big over-
head when they have to choose from multi-
ple frameworks, compare different types of
models, and understand various optimization
mechanisms. An NLP toolkit for DNN models
with both generality and flexibility can greatly
improve the productivity of engineers by sav-
ing their learning cost and guiding them to find
optimal solutions to their tasks. In this pa-
per, we introduce NeuronBlocks1 2, a toolkit
encapsulating a suite of neural network mod-
ules as building blocks to construct various
DNN models with complex architecture. This
toolkit empowers engineers to build, train, and
test various NLP models through simple con-
figuration of JSON files. The experiments on
several NLP datasets such as GLUE, WikiQA
and CoNLL-2003 demonstrate the effective-
ness of NeuronBlocks.

1 Introduction
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely
employed in industry for solving various Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text
classification, sequence labeling, question answer-
ing, etc. However, when engineers apply DNN
models to address specific NLP tasks, they often
face the following challenges.

• Multiple DNN frameworks, including Tensor-
Flow, PyTorch, Keras, etc. It is a big overhead
to learn how to program under the frameworks.

• Diverse and fast evolving DNN models, such as
CNN, RNN, and Transformer. It takes big ef-
forts to understand the intuition and maths be-
hind these models.

• Various regularization and optimization mech-
anisms. To tune model performance for both
quality and efficiency, model developers have
to gain experience in Dropout, Normalization,
Mixed precision training, etc.

• Coding and debugging complexity. Program-
ming under DNN frameworks requires devel-
opers to be familiar with the built-in packages
and interfaces. It needs much expertise to de-
velop, debug, and optimize code.

• Platform compatibility. It requires extra cod-
ing work to run on different platforms, such as
Linux/Windows, GPU/CPU.

The above challenges often hinder the produc-
tivity of engineers, and result in less optimal so-
lutions to their given tasks. This motivates us to
develop an NLP toolkit for DNN models. Before
designing this NLP toolkit, we conducted a sur-
vey among engineers and identified a spectrum of
three typical personas.

• The first type of engineers prefer off-the-shelf
networks. Given a specific task, they expect
the toolkit to suggest several end-to-end net-
work architectures, and then they simply focus
on collecting the training data, and tuning the
model parameters. They hope the whole pro-
cess to be extremely agile and easy.

• The second type of engineers would like to
build the networks by themselves. However, in-
stead of writing each line of code from scratch,
they hope the toolkit to provide a rich gallery
of reusable modules as building blocks. Then
they can compare various model architectures
constructed by the building blocks.

• The last type of engineers are advanced users.
They want to reuse most part of the exist-
ing networks, but for critical components, they
would like to make innovations and create their
own modules. They hope the toolkit to have

an open infrastructure, so that customized mod-
ules can be easily plugged in.

To satisfy the requirements of all the above
three personas, the NLP toolkit has to be generic
enough to cover as many tasks as possible. At the
same time, it also needs to be flexible enough to
allow alternative network architectures as well as
customized modules. Therefore, we analyzed the
NLP jobs submitted to a commercial centralized
GPU cluster. Table 1 showed that about 87.5%
NLP related jobs belong to a few common tasks,
including sentence classification, text matching,
sequence labeling, machine reading comprehen-
sion (MRC), etc. It further suggested that more
than 90% of the networks were composed of sev-
eral common components, such as embedding,
CNN/RNN, Transformer and so on.

Tasks Ratio
Text matching 39.4%

Sentence classification 27.3%
Sequence labeling 14.7%

MRC 6.0%
Others 12.5%

Table 1: Task analysis of NLP DNN jobs submitted to a
commercial centralized GPU cluster.

Based on the above observations, we developed
NeuronBlocks, a DNN toolkit for NLP tasks. The
basic idea is to provide two layers of support to
the engineers. The upper layer targets common
NLP tasks. For each task, the toolkit contains
several end-to-end network templates, which can
be immediately instantiated with simple configu-
ration. The bottom layer consists of a suite of
reusable and standard components, which can be
adopted as building blocks to construct networks
with complex architecture. By following the in-
terface guidelines, users can also contribute to this
gallery of components with their own modules.

The technical contributions of NeuronBlocks
are summarized into the following three aspects.

• Block Zoo: categorize and abstract the most
commonly used DNN components into stan-
dard and reusable blocks. The blocks within
the same category can be used exchangeably.

• Model Zoo: identify the most popular NLP
tasks and provide alternative end-to-end net-
work templates (in JSON format) for each task.

• Platform Compatibility: support both Linux
and Windows machines, CPU/GPU chips, as
well as GPU platforms such as PAI3.

2 Related Work

There are several general-purpose deep learning
frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and
Keras, which have gained popularity in NLP com-
munity. These frameworks offer huge flexibil-
ity in DNN model design and support various
NLP tasks. However, building models under these
frameworks requires a large overhead of master-
ing these framework details. Therefore, higher
level abstraction to hide the framework details is
favored by many engineers.

There are also several popular deep learning
toolkits in NLP, including OpenNMT (Klein et al.,
2017), AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018) etc. Open-
NMT is an open-source toolkit mainly target-
ing neural machine translation or other natural
language generation tasks. AllenNLP provides
several pre-built models for NLP tasks, such as
semantic role labeling, machine comprehension,
textual entailment, etc. Although these toolkits re-
duce the development cost, they are limited to cer-
tain tasks, and thus not flexible enough to support
new network architectures or new components.

3 Design

Neuronblocks is built on PyTorch. The overall
framework is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of
two layers: the Block Zoo and the Model Zoo. In
Block Zoo, the most commonly used components
of neural networks are categorized into several
groups according to their functions. Within each
category, several alternative components are en-
capsulated into standard and reusable blocks with
a consistent interface. These blocks serve as basic
and exchangeable units to construct complex net-
work architectures for different tasks. In Model
Zoo, the most popular NLP tasks are identified.
For each task, several end-to-end network tem-
plates are provided in the form of JSON configu-
ration files. Users can simply browse these config-
urations and choose one to instantiate. The whole
task can be completed without any coding efforts.

3.1 Block Zoo
We recognize the following major functional cat-
egories of neural network components. Each cat-
egory covers as many commonly used modules as
possible. The Block Zoo is an open framework,
and more modules can be added in the future.

ding and extra handcrafted feature embedding

such as pos-tagging are supported.
• Neural Network Layers: Block zoo provides

common layers like RNN, CNN, QRNN (Brad-
bury et al., 2017), Transformer (Vaswani et al.,
2017), Highway network, Encoder Decoder ar-
chitecture, etc. We also support multiple atten-
tion layers, such as Linear/Bi-linear Attention,
Bidirectional attention flow (Seo et al., 2017),
etc. Meanwhile, regularization layers such as
Dropout, Layer Norm, etc are also supported.

• Loss Function: All built-in loss functions in
PyTorch are supported.

• Metrics: For classification task, Area Un-
der Curve (AUC), Accuracy, F1 metrics
are supported. For sequence labeling task,
F1/Accuracy are supported. For knowledge
distillation task, MSE/RMSE are supported.
For MRC task, ExactMatch/F1 are supported.

3.2 Model Zoo
In NeuronBlocks, we identify four types of most
popular NLP tasks. For each task, we provide var-
ious end-to-end network templates.

• Text Classification and Matching. Tasks such
as domain/intent classification, question an-
swer matching are supported.

• Sequence Labeling. Predict each token in a
sequence into predefined types. Common tasks
include NER, POS tagging, Slot tagging, etc.

• Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).
Teacher-Student based knowledge distillation
is one common approach for model com-
pression. NeuronBlocks provides knowledge

distillation template to train light-weight stu-
dent model to imitate heavy DNN models like
BERT/GPT.

• Extractive Machine Reading Comprehen-
sion. Given question and passage, this task is
to predict the start and end positions of the an-
swer spans in the passage.

3.3 User Interface
NeuronBlocks provides convenient user interface4

for users to build, train, and test DNN models. The
details are described in the following.

• I/O interface. This part defines model in-
put/output, such as training data, pre-trained
models/embeddings, model saving path, etc.

• Model Architecture interface. This is the key
part of the configuration file, which defines the
whole model architecture. Figure 2 shows an
example of how to specify a model architecture
using the blocks in NeuronBlocks. To be more
specific, it consists of a list of layers/blocks to
construct the architecture, where the blocks are
supplied in the gallery of Block Zoo.

• Training Parameters interface. In this part,
the model optimizer as well as all other training
hyper parameters are indicated.

3.4 Workflow
Figure 3 shows the workflow of building DNN
models in NeuronBlocks. Users only need to write
a JSON configuration file. They can either instan-
tiate an existing template from Model Zoo, or con-
struct a new architecture based on the blocks from
Block Zoo. This configuration file is shared across
training, test, and prediction.

For model hyper-parameter tuning or architec-
ture modification, users just need to change the
JSON configuration file. Advanced users can also
contribute novel customized blocks5 into Block
Zoo, as long as they follow the same interface
guidelines with the existing blocks. These new
blocks can be further shared across all users for
model architecture design. Moreover, Neuron-
Blocks has flexible platform support, such as
GPU/CPU, GPU management platforms like PAI.

4 Experiments
To verify the performance of NeuronBlocks, we
conducted extensive experiments for common

NLP tasks on public data sets including CoNLL-
2003 (Sang and Meulder, 2003), GLUE bench-
mark (Wang et al., 2019), and WikiQA cor-
pus (Yang et al., 2015). The experimental results
showed that the models built with NeuronBlocks
can achieve reliable and competitive results on

various tasks, with productivity greatly improved.

4.1 Sequence Labeling
We evaluated NeuronBlocks on CoNLL-
2003 (Sang and Meulder, 2003) English NER
dataset, following most works on the same task.
This dataset includes four types of named entities,
namely, PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZA-
TION, and MISC. We adopted BIOES tagging
scheme instead of IOB, as many previous works
indicated meaningful improvement with BIOES
scheme (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). Table 2 shows
the results on CoNLL-2003 Englist testb dataset,
with 12 different combinations of network lay-
ers/blocks, such as word/character embedding,
CNN/LSTM and CRF. The results suggest that

ronBlocks can easily reproduce the performance
of original models, with comparative or slightly
better performance.

4.2 GLUE Benchmark
The General Language Understanding Evaluation
(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) is a col-
lection of natural language understanding tasks.
We experimented on the GLUE benchmark tasks
using BiLSTM and Attention based models. As
shown in Table 3, the models built by Neuron-
Blocks can achieve competitive or even better re-
sults on GLUE tasks with minimal coding efforts.

4.3 Knowledge Distillation
In teacher-student based knowledge distillation, a
lightweight student model is trained by imitating
the output of heavy teacher model like BERT. We
evaluated on a binary classification dataset called
Domain Classification Dataset, which was col-
lected from a commercial search engine. Each
sample in this dataset consists of two parts, i.e.,
a query and a binary label indicating whether
the query belongs to a specific domain. Table 4
shows the results, where AUC is used as the eval-
uation criteria and Queries per Second (QPS) is
used to measure inference speed. By leveraging
knowledge distillation, the student model by Neu-
ronBlocks managed to get 24.8 times inference
speedup with only small performance regression
compared with BERTbase6 fine-tuned classifier.

4.4 WikiQA
The WikiQA corpus (Yang et al., 2015) is a pub-
licly available dataset for open-domain question
answering. This dataset contains 3,047 questions
from Bing query logs, each associated with some
candidate answer sentences from Wikipedia. We
conducted experiments on WikiQA dataset using
CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention based models. The
results are shown in Table 5. The models built in
NeuronBlocks achieved competitive or even better
results with simple model configurations.

In this paper, we introduce NeuronBlocks, a DNN
toolkit for NLP tasks built on PyTorch, targeting

three types of engineers, and provides a two-layer
solution to satisfy the requirements from all three
types of users. To be more specific, the Model Zoo
consists of various templates for the most com-
mon NLP tasks, while the Block Zoo supplies a
gallery of alternative layers/modules for the net-
works. Such design achieves a balance between
generality and flexibility. Extensive experiments
have verified the effectiveness of this approach.
NeuronBlocks has been widely used in a product
team of a commercial search engine, and signif-
icantly improved the productivity for developing
NLP DNN approaches.

As an open-source toolkit, we will further ex-
tend it in various directions. The following names
a few examples.

• Multi-task learning (MTL). In MTL, multiple
related tasks are jointly trained so that knowl-
edge learned in one task can benefit other tasks.

• Pre-training and fine-tuning. Deep pre-training
models such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018),
GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019) are new directions in NLP.

• Sequence generation task. Sequence genera-
tion is widely used in NLP fields such as ma-
chine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), text
summarization (See et al., 2017), and dialogue
systems (Wen et al., 2015).

• AutoML (Elsken et al., 2019). NeuronBlocks
facilitates users to build models on top of
Model Zoo and Block Zoo. With the integra-
tion of AutoML, the toolkit can further support
automatic model architecture design.
