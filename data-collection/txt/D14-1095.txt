Abstract

We explore the impact of morpholog-
ical segmentation on keyword spotting
(KWS). Despite potential benefits, state-
of-the-art KWS systems do not use mor-
phological information. In this paper,
we augment a state-of-the-art KWS sys-
tem with sub-word units derived from su-
pervised and unsupervised morphological
segmentations, and compare with phonetic
and syllabic segmentations. Our exper-
iments demonstrate that morphemes im-
prove overall performance of KWS sys-
tems. Syllabic units, however, rival the
performance of morphological units when
used in KWS. By combining morphologi-
cal, phonetic and syllabic segmentations,
we demonstrate substantial performance
gains.

1 Introduction

Morphological analysis plays an increasingly im-
portant role in many language processing appli-
cations. Recent research has demonstrated that
adding information about word structure increases
the quality of translation systems and alleviates
sparsity in language modeling (Chahuneau et al.,
2013b; Habash, 2008; Kirchhoff et al., 2006; Stal-
lard et al., 2012).

In this paper, we study the impact of morpho-
logical analysis on the keyword spotting (KWS)
task. The aim of KWS is to find instances of a
given keyword in a corpus of speech data. The
task is particularly challenging for morphologi-
cally rich languages as many target keywords are
unseen in the training data. For instance, in the
Turkish dataset (Babel, 2013) we use, from the
2013 IARPA Babel evaluations, 36.06% of the test
words are unseen in the training data. However,
81.44% of these unseen words have a morpholog-
ical variant in the training data. Similar patterns

are observed in other languages used in the Babel
evaluations. This observation strongly supports
the use of morphological analysis to handle out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) words in KWS systems.

Despite this potential promise, state-of-the-art
KWS systems do not commonly use morphologi-
cal information. This surprising fact can be due to
multiple reasons, ranging from the accuracy of ex-
isting morphological analyzers to the challenge of
integrating morphological information into exist-
ing KWS architectures. While using morphemes
is likely to increase coverage, it makes recogni-
tion harder due to the inherent ambiguity in the
recognition of smaller units. Moreover, it is not
clear a priori that morphemes, which are based on
the semantics of written language, are appropriate
segmentation units for a speech-based application.

We investigate the above hypotheses in the
context of a state-of-the-art KWS architec-
ture (Karakos et al., 2013). We augment word
lattices with smaller units obtained via segmenta-
tion of words, and use these modified lattices for
keyword spotting. We consider multiple segmen-
tation algorithms, ranging from near-perfect su-
pervised segmentations to random segmentations,
along with unsupervised segmentations and purely
phonetic and syllabic segmentations. Our exper-
iments show how sub-word units can be used ef-
fectively to improve the performance of KWS sys-
tems. Further, we study the extent of impact of the
subwords, and the manner in which they can be
used in KWS systems.

2 Related Work

Prior research on applications of morphological
analyzers has focused on machine translation, lan-
guage modeling and speech recognition (Habash,
2008; Chahuneau et al., 2013a; Kirchhoff et al.,
2006). Morphological analysis enables us to link
together multiple inflections of the same root,
thereby alleviating word sparsity common in mor-

880



phologically rich languages. This results in im-
proved language model perplexity, better word
alignments and higher BLEU scores.

Recent work has demonstrated that even mor-
phological analyzers that use little or no supervi-
sion can help improve performance in language
modeling and machine translation (Chahuneau et
al., 2013b; Stallard et al., 2012). It has also been
shown that segmentation lattices improve the qual-
ity of machine translation systems (Dyer, 2009).

In this work, we leverage morphological seg-
mentation to reduce OOV rates in KWS. We in-
vestigate segmentations produced by a range of
models, including acoustic sub-word units. We in-
corporate these subword units into a lattice frame-
work within the KWS system. We also demon-
strate the value of using alternative segmentations
instead of or in combination with morphemes. In
addition to improving the performance of KWS
systems, this finding may also benefit other appli-
cations that currently use morphological segmen-
tation for OOV reduction.

3 Segmentation Methods

Supervised Morphological Segmentation Due
to the unavailability of gold morphological seg-
mentations for our corpus (Babel, 2013), we use
a resource-rich supervised system as a proxy. As
training data for this system, we use the Mor-
phoChallenge 2010 corpus1 which consists of
1760 gold segmentations for Turkish.

We consider two supervised frameworks, both
made up of two stages. In the first stage, com-
mon to both systems, we use a FST-based mor-
phological parser (Çöltekin, 2010) that generates a
set of candidate segmentations, leveraging a large
database of Turkish roots and affixes. This stage
tends to overgenerate, segmenting each word in
eight different ways on average. In the next stage,
we filter the resulting segmentations using one of
two supervised filters (described below) trained on
the MorphoChallenge corpus.

In the first approach, we use a binary log-linear
classifier to accept/reject each segmentation hy-
pothesis. For each word, this classifier may ac-
cept multiple segmentations, or rule out all the al-
ternatives. In the second approach, to control the
number of segmentations per word, we train a log-
linear ranker that orders the segmentations for a
word in decreasing order of likelihood. In our

training corpus, each word has on average 2.5 gold
segmentations. Hence, we choose the top two seg-
mentations per word from the output of the ranker
to use in our KWS system. In both filters, we
use several features like morpheme unigrams, bi-
grams, lengths, number of morphemes, and phone
sequences corresponding to the morphemes.

In our supervised systems, we can encode fea-
tures that go beyond individual boundaries, like
the total number of morphemes in the segmenta-
tion. This global view distinguishes our classi-
fier/ranker from traditional approaches that model
segmentation as a sequence tagging task (Ruoko-
lainen et al., 2013; Kudo et al., 2004; Kru-
engkrai et al., 2006). Another departure of our
approach is the use of phonetic information, in
the form of phonetic sequences corresponding to
the morpheme unigrams and bigrams. The hy-
pothesis is that syllabic boundaries are correlated
with morpheme boundaries to some extent. The
phonetic sequences for words are obtained using
a publicly available Text-to-Phone (T2P) system
(Lenzo, 1998).

Unsupervised Morphological Segmentation
We employ a widely-used unsupervised sys-
tem Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) which
achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised perfor-
mance in the MorphoChallenge evaluation. Mor-
fessor uses probabilistic generative models with
sparse priors which are motivated by the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) principle. The system
derives segmentations from raw data, without re-
liance on extra linguistic sources. It outputs a sin-
gle segmentation per word.

Random Segmentation As a baseline, we in-
clude sub-word units from random segmentations,
where we mark a segmentation boundary at each
character position in a word with a fixed probabil-
ity p. For comparison purposes, we consider two

types of random segmentations that match the su-
pervised morphological segmentations in terms of
the number of uniques morphemes and the average
morpheme length, respectively. These segmenta-
tions are obtained by adjusting the segmentation
probability p appropriately.

Phones and Syllables In addition to letter-
based segmentation, we also consider other sub-
word units that stem from word acoustics. In par-
ticular, we consider segmentation using phones
and syllables, which are available for the Babel
data we work with.

Table 2 shows examples of different segmenta-
tions for the Turkish word takacak.

4 Keyword Spotting

The keyword spotting system used in this work
follows, to a large extent, the pipeline of (Bulyko
et al., 2012). Using standard speech recognition
machinery, the system produces a detailed lattice
of word hypotheses. The resulting lattice is used to
extract keyword hits with nominal posterior prob-
ability scores.

We modify this basic architecture in two ways.
First, we use subwords instead of whole-words in
the decoding lexicon. Second, we represent key-
words using all possible paths in a lattice of sub-
words. For each sequence of matching arcs in the
lattice, the posteriors of these arcs are multiplied
together to form the score of detection (hit). A
post-processing step adds up (or takes the max of)
the scores of all hits of each keyword which have
significant overlap in time. Finally, the hit lists are
processed by the score normalization and combi-
nation method described in (Karakos et al., 2013).

We use whole-word extraction for words in vo-
cabulary, but rely on subword models for OOV
words. Since we combine the hits separately for
IV and OOV keywords, using subwords can only
improve the performance of the overall system.

5 Experimental Setup

Data The segmentation algorithms described in
Section 3 are tested using the setup of the KWS
system described in Section 4. Our experiments
are conducted using the IARPA Babel Program
language collections for Turkish, Assamese, Ben-
gali, Haitian, Lao, Tamil and Zulu (Babel, 2013)2.
The dataset contains audio corpora and a set of
keywords. The training corpus for KWS consists
of 10 hours of speech, while the development and
test sets have durations of 10 and 5 hours, respec-
tively. We evaluate KWS performance over the
OOV keywords in the data, which are unseen in
the training set, but appear in the development/test
set. Table 3 contains statistics on the number of
OOV keywords in the data for each language.

In our experiments, we consider the pre-indexed
condition, where the keywords are known only af-
ter the decoding of the speech has taken place.

Evaluation Measures We consider two differ-
ent evaluation metrics. To evaluate the accuracy
of the different segmentations, we compare them
against gold segmentations from the MorphoChal-
lenge data for Turkish. This set consists of 1760
words, which are manually segmented. We use
a measure of word accuracy (WordAcc), which
captures the accuracy of all segmentation deci-
sions within the word. If one of the segmenta-
tion boundaries is wrong in a proposed segmen-
tation, then that segmentation does not contribute
towards the WordAcc score. We use 10-fold cross-
validation for the supervised segmentations, while
we use the entire set for unsupervised and acoustic
cases.

We evaluate the performance of our KWS sys-
tem using a widely used metric in KWS, the Ac-

tion only on Turkish, due to the lack of gold morphological
data for the other languages.

tual Term Weighted Value (ATWV) measure, as
described in (Fiscus et al., 2007). This measure
uses a combination of penalties for misses and
false positives to score the system. The maximum
score achievable is 1.0, if there are no misses and
false positives, while the score can be lower than
0.0 if there are a lot of misses or false positives.

6 Results

Table 4 summarizes the performance of all con-
sidered segmentation systems in the KWS task on
Turkish. The quality of the segmentations com-
pared to the gold standard is also shown. Table 5
shows the OOV ATWV performance on the six
other languages, used in the second year of the
IARPA Babel project. We summarize below our
conclusions based on these results.

Using sub-word units improves overall KWS
performance If we use a word-based KWS sys-
tem, the ATWV score will be 0.0 since the OOV
keywords are not present in the lexicon. En-
riching our KWS system with sub-word segments
yields performance gains for all the segmentation
methods, including random segmentations. How-
ever, the observed gain exhibits significant vari-
ance across the segmentation methods. For in-
stance, the gap between the performance of the
KWS system using the best supervised classifier-
based segmenter (CP) and that using the unsuper-
vised segmenter (U) is 0.059, which corresponds
to a 43.7% in relative gain. Table 4 also shows that
while methods with shorter sub-units (U, P) yield
lower OOV rate, they do not necessarily fare better
in the KWS evaluation.

Syllabic units rival the performance of mor-
phological units A surprising discovery from our
experiments is the good performance of the syl-
labic segmentation-based KWS system (S). It out-
performs all the alternative segmentations on the
test set, and ranks second on the development set
behind the CP system. These units are particularly
attractive as they can easily be computed from
acoustic input and do not require any prior linguis-
tic knowledge. We hypothesize that the granular-
ity of this segmentation is crucial to its success.
For instance, a finer-grained phone-based segmen-
tation (P) performs substantially worse than other
segmentation algorithms as the derived sub-units
are shorter and hence, harder to recognize.

Improving morphological accuracy beyond a
certain level does not translate into improved

KWS performance We observe that the segmen-
tation accuracy and KWS performance are not
positively correlated. Clearly, bad segmentations
translate into poor ATWV scores, as in the case
of random and unsupervised segmentations. How-
ever, gains on segmentation accuracy do not al-
ways result in better KWS performance. For in-
stance, the ranker systems (RP, RNP) have better
accuracies on MC2010, while the classifier sys-
tems (CP, CNP) perform better on the KWS task.
This discrepancy in performance suggests that fur-
ther gains can be obtained by optimizing segmen-
tations directly with respect to KWS metrics.

Adding phonetic information improves mor-
phological segmentation For all the morpholog-
ical systems, adding phonetic information results
in consistent performance gains. For instance,
it increases segmentation accuracy by 4% when
added to the classifier (CNP and CP in table 4).
The phonetic information used in our experiments
is computed automatically using a T2P system
(Lenzo, 1998), and can be easily obtained for a
range of languages. This finding sheds new light
on the relation between phonetic and morphologi-
cal systems, and can be beneficial for morpholog-
ical analyzers developed for other applications.

Combining morphological, phonetic and syl-
labic segmentations gives better results than ei-
ther in isolation As table 4 shows, the best KWS
results are achieved when syllabic and morphemic
systems are combined. The best combination sys-
tem (CP+P+S) outperforms the best individual
system (S) by 5.5%. This result suggests that mor-
phemic, phonemic and syllabic segmentations en-
code complementary information which benefits
KWS systems in handling OOV keywords.

Morphological segmentation helps KWS
across different languages Table 5 demonstrates
that we can obtain gains in KWS performance
across different languages using unsupervised seg-
mentation. The improvement is significant in 3 of
the 6 languages - as high as 3.2% for Assamese
and Bengali, and 2.7% for Tamil (absolute per-
centages). As such, the results of Table 2 can-
not be directly compared to those of Table 1 since
the system architecture is slightly different3. How-

by the Babelon team in the 2014 NIST evaluation (Tsakalidis,
2014). The pipeline was much more involved than the one de-
scribed for Turkish; multiple search methods (with/without
fuzzy search) and data structures (lattices, confusion net-
works and generalized versions of these) were all used in
combination (Karakos and Schwartz, 2014). The recognition

tained through unsupervised morphology, on top
of a very good combined phonetic/syllabic system.

7 Conclusion

We explore the extent of impact of morphological
segmentation on keyword spotting (KWS). To in-
vestigate this issue, we augmented a KWS system
with sub-word units derived by multiple segmen-
tation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate
that morphemes improve the overall performance
of KWS systems. Syllabic units, however, rival the
performance of morphemes in the KWS task. Fur-
thermore, we demonstrate that substantial perfor-

phonetic information improves the quality of mor-
