Abstract 

We propose a method for using discourse rela-
tions for polarity detection of tweets. We have 

focused on unstructured and noisy text like 

tweets on which linguistic tools like parsers and 

POS-taggers don’t work properly. We have 

showed how conjunctions, connectives, modals 

and conditionals affect the sentiments in tweets. 

We have also handled the commonly used ab-

breviations, slangs and collocations which are 

usually used in short text messages like tweets. 

This work focuses on a Web based application 

which produces results in real time. This ap-

proach is an extension of the previous work 

(Mukherjee et al. 2012). 

1. Introduction 

Discourse relation is an important component of 
natural language processing which connects 

phrases and clauses together to establish a cohe-
rent relation. Linguistic constructs like conjunc-

tions, connectives, modals, conditionals and ne-

gation do alter the sentiments of a sentence. For 

example, the movie had quite a few memorable 
moments but I still did not like it. The overall 

polarity of the sentence is negative even though 

it has one positive and one negative clause. This 
is because of the presence of the conjunction but 

which gives more weightage to the clause fol-

lowing the conjunction.  

Traditional works in discourse analysis use a 
discourse parser (Marcu  et al., 2003; Polanyi et 

al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2005; Welner et al., 2006; 

Narayanan et al., 2009; Prasad et al., 2010). 

Many of these works and some other works in 
discourse (Taboada et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 

2011) build on the Rhetorical Structure Theory 

(RTS) proposed by Mann et al. (1988) which 
tries to identify the relations between the nucleus 

 

 

and satellite in the sentence. 

 
Most of the work is based on well-structured text 

and the methods applied on that text is not suita-

ble for the discourse analysis on micro-blogs 

because of the following reasons: 
 

1. Micro-blogs like Twitter restricts a post 
(tweet) to be of only 140 characters. Thus, users 
do not use formal language to discuss their 

views. Thus, there are abundant spelling mis-

takes, abbreviations, slangs, collocations, discon-

tinuities and grammatical errors. 
These differences cause NLP tools like POS-

taggers and parsers to fail frequently, as these 

tools are built for well-structured text. Thus, 
most of the methods described in the previous 

works are not well suited for discourse analysis 

on Micro-blogs like text. 
2. The web-based applications require a 
fast response time. Using a heavy linguistic re-

source like parsing increases the processing time 

and slows down the application. 
  

Most of the previous work on discourse analysis 

does not take into consideration the conjunc-
tions, connectives, modals, conditionals etc and 

are based on bag-of-words model with features 

like part-of-speech information, unigrams, bi-
grams etc. along with other domain-specific fea-

tures like emoticons, hashtags etc. Our work 

harness the importance of discourse connectives 

like conjunctions, connectives, modals, condi-
tionals etc and show that along with bag-of-

words model, it gives better sentiment classifica-

tion accuracy. This work is the extension of 
(Mukherjee et al. 2012). 

 

The roadmap for the rest of the paper is as fol-

lows: Section 2 studies the effect of discourse 
relations on sentiment analysis and identifies the  

 

495



critical ones. Section 3 talks about the semantic 

operators which influence the discourse rela-
tions. Section 4 discusses the lexicon based clas-

sification approach. Section 5 describes the fea-

ture engineering of the important features. Sec-

tion 6 gives the list of experiments conducted 
and analysis of the results. Conclusion and Fu-

ture Work is presented in Section 7. 

 

2. Discourse Relations Critical for Sen-
timent Analysis 

(Mukherjee et al. 2012) showed that that the fol-

lowing discourse relations are critical for SA as 

all relations are not useful for SA. Table 1 pro-
vides examples of various discourse relations. 

 

Violated Expectations and Contrast: In Exam-

ple 2, a simple bag-of-words feature based clas-
sifier will classify it as positive. However, it ac-

tually represents a negative sentiment. Such cas-

es need to be handled separately. In Example 5, 
“memorable" has (+1) score and “not like" has (-

1) score and overall polarity is 0 or objective 

whereas it should be negative as the final verdict 
following “but" is the deciding factor. 

 

These kinds of sentences refute the neighboring 

clause. They can be classified as Conj_Prev in 
which the clause preceding the conjunction is 

preferred and Conj_Fol in which the clause fol-

lowing the conjunction is preferred. 

 

Conclusive or Inferential Conjunctions: These 

are the set of conjunctions, Conj_infer, that tend 

to draw a conclusion or inference. Hence, the 
discourse segment following them (subsequently 

in Example 11) should be given more weight. 

 
Conditionals: In Example 3, “amazing" 

represent a positive sentiment. But the final po-

larity should be objective as we are talking of a 
hypothetical situation. 

 

Other Discourse Relations: Sentences under 

Cause-Effect, Similarity, Temporal Sequence, 
Attribution, Example, Generalization and Elabo-

ration, provide no contrasting, conflicting or hy-

pothetical information. They can be handled by 

taking a simple bag-of-words model.  

3. Semantic Operators Influencing Dis-
course Relations 

There are connectives or semantic operators 

present in the sentences which influence the dis-

course relation within a sentence. For example, 

in the sentence the cannon camera may bad de-
spite good battery life. The connective despite 

increases the weightage of the previous dis-

course element i.e. bad is weighted up but may 
introduces a certain kind of uncertainty which 

cannot be ignored.  

 

1.  (I did not study anything throughout the seme-

ster), so (I failed in the exams). 

2.  (Sourav failed to deliver in the penultimate test) 

despite (great expectations). 

3. If (I had bought the amazing Nokia phone), I 

would not be crying). 

4. (I love Cannon) and (I also love Sony). 

5. (The movie had quite a few memorable moments) 

but (I still did not like it). 

6. (The theater became interesting) after a while. 

7. According (to the reviews), (the movie must be 

bad). 

8. (Salman is a bad guy), for instance (he is always 

late). 

9. In addition (to the bad battery life), (the camera 

is also very costly). 

10. In general, (cameras from cannon (take great 

pictures). 

11. (They were not in favour of that camera) and 
subsequently (decided not to buy it). 

Table 1:  Examples of Discourse Coherent 

Relations 

Similarity, in the sentence He gave his best in 

the movie, but still it was not good enough to win 
an Oscar. The connective but increases the 

weight of the following discourse i.e. good and 

win are weighted up but presence of negation 
operator also cannot be ignored.

1. Modals: Events that are happening or are 

bound to happen are called realis events. And 
those events that have possibly occurred or have 

some probability to occur in distant future are 

known as irrealis events. And it is important to 

distinguish between the two as it also alters the 
sentiments in a piece of text. Modals depict ir-

realis events and just cannot be handled by sim-

ple majority valence model. 
 

(Mukherjee et al. 2012) divided modals into two 

categories: Strong_Mod and Weak_Mod. 
 

Strong_Mod is the set of modals that express a 

higher degree of uncertainty in any situation. 

Weak_Mod is the set of modals that express 
lesser degree of uncertainty and more emphasis 

on certain events or situations.  

 
Like conditionals, sentences with strong modals 

express higher degree of uncertainty, thus dis-

course elements near strong modals are weighted 
down. Thus, in the previous example the cannon 

camera may bad despite good battery life bad is 

toned down.

Table 2: Discourse Relations and Semantic 

Operators Essential for Sentiment Analysis 

 

2. Negation: The negation operator inverts the 

polarity of the sentence following it. Usually, to 
handle negation a window (typically 3-5 words) 

is considered and the polarities of all the words 

are reversed. We have considered the window 

size to be 5 and reverse the polarities of all the 
words within the window, till either a conjunc-

tion comes or window size exceeds. For example 

In the sentence He gave his best in the movie, 
but still it was not good enough to win an Oscar 

polarities of good and win are reversed. 
  

4. Lexicon Based Classification 

We have used Senti-WordNet (Esuli et al. 2006), 

Inquirer (Stone et. al 1996) and the Bing Liu 

sentiment lexicon (Hu et al. 2004) to find out the 
word polarities. To compensate the bias effects 

introduced by the individual lexicons, we have 

used three different lexicons. The polarities of 
the reviews are given by (Mukherjee et al. 2012) 

 

𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 (   𝑓𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑝𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝑝(𝑤𝑖𝑗 ))

𝑛𝑖

𝑖=1

𝑚

𝑖=1

 

 

𝑤𝑕𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑝 𝑤𝑖𝑗  =  𝑝𝑜𝑙 𝑤𝑖𝑗   𝑖𝑓 𝑕𝑦𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 0 

                        

                             =  
𝑝𝑜𝑙 𝑤𝑖𝑗  

2
 𝑖𝑓 𝑕𝑦𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 1  

   

Above equation finds the weighted, signed po-

larity of a review. The polarity of each word, 
pol(wij) being +1 or -1, is multiplied with its dis-

course weight fij and all the weighted polarities 

are added. Flipij indicates if the polarity of wij is 
to be negated. 

In case there is any conditional or strong modal 

in the sentence (indicated by 𝑕𝑦𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 1 ), then 
the polarity of every word in the sentence is 

toned down, by considering half of its assigned 

polarity (
+1

2
 ,
−1

2
) 

Thus, if good occurs in the user post twice, it 

will contribute a polarity of +1 × 2 = +2 to the 

overall review polarity, if 𝑕𝑦𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 0. In the 
presence of a strong modal or conditional, it will 

contribute a polarity of 
+1

2
∗ 2 =  +1. 

497



All the stop words, discourse connectives and 

modals are ignored during the classification 
phase, as they have a zero polarity in the lexicon.  

We have handled commonly used slangs, ab-

breviations and collocations by manually tagging 

them as positive, negative or neutral.  

5. Feature Engineering 

The features specific for lexicon based classifi-
cation for the task sentiment Analysis, identified 

in Section 2.4, are handled as follows: 

 

a) The words following the Conj_Fol (Table 2) 
are given more weightage. Hence their frequency 

count is incremented by 1. 

We follow a naive weighting scheme whereby 
we give a (+1) weightage to every word we con-

sider important. In Example 5, “memorable" gets 

(+1) score, while “did not like" gets a (-2) score, 
making the overall score (-1) i.e. the example 

suggests a negative sentiment. 

 

b) The weightage of the words occurring before 
the Conj_Prev (Table 2) is increased by 1. In 

Example 2, “failed" will have polarity (-2) in-

stead of (-1) and “great expectations" will have 
polarity (+1), making the overall polarity (-1), 

which conforms to the overall sentiment. 

 
c) The weightage of the words in the sentences 

containing conditionals (if) and strong modals 

(might, could, can, would, may) are toned down. 

 
e) The polarity of all words appearing within a 

window of 5 from the occurrence of a negation 

operator (not, neither, nor, no, never) and before 
the occurrence of a violating expectation con-

junction is reversed. 

  

f) Exploiting sentence position information, the 
words appearing in the first k and last k sen-

tences, are given more weightage. The value of k 

is set empirically. 
 

g) The Negation Bias factor is treated as a para-

meter which is learnt from a small set of nega-
tive polarity tagged documents. The frequency 

count of all the negative words (in a rule based 

system) is multiplied with this factor to give 

negative words more weightage than positive 
words. 

6. Experiments and Evaluation 

For the lexicon-based approach, we performed 
two types of experiments- sentiment pertaining 

to a particular instance in a tweet (SemEval-

2013 Task A) and generic sentiment analysis of 
a tweet (SemEval-2013 Task B). We treat both 

the tasks similarly. 

 

6.1 Dataset 
 

We performed experiments on two Datasets: 

 
1) SemEval-2013-task 2 Twitter Dataset A con-

taining 4435 tweets without any external data. 

2) SemEval-2013-task 2 Twitter Dataset B con-
taining 3813 tweets without any external data. 

 

6.2 Results on the Twitter Dataset A and B 
 
The system performs best for the positive class 

tweets as shown in Table 3 and Table 4 and per-

forms badly for the negative class which is due 
to the fact that negative tweets can contain sar-

casm which is a difficult phenomenon to capture. 

Also the results of the neutral category are very 
less which suggests that our system is biased 

towards subjective tweets and we wish to give 

the majority sentiment in the tweets.

6.3 Discussion 
 

The lexicon based classifier suffers from the 

problem of lexeme space where it is not able 

handle all the word senses. Also, short-noisy text 

like tweets often contain various spelling mis-
takes like great can be grt, g8t etc. or tomorrow 

can be tom, tomm, tommrrw etc. which will not 

be detected and handled properly.  
 

We suggest that a supervised approach compris-

ing of the discourse features along with the bag-
of-words model and the sense based features will 

improve the results. 

 

7. Conclusion and Future Work 

We have showed that discourse connectives, 

conjunctions, negations and conditionals do alter 
the sentiments of a piece of text. Most of the 

work on Micro-blogs like twitter is build on bag-

of-words model and does not incorporate dis-

course relations. We discussed an approach 
where we can incorporate discourse relations 

along-with bag-of-words model for a web-

application where parsers and taggers cannot be 
used as the results are required in real time. 

 

We need to take into consideration word senses 
and a supervised approach to use all the features 

collectively. Also, a spell checker would really 

help in the noisy text like in tweets.
