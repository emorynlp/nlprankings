Abstract

A primary motivation of the Dialog State
Tracking Challenge (DSTC) is to allow
for direct comparisons between alterna-
tive approaches to dialog state tracking.
While results from DSTC 1 mention per-
formance limitations, an examination of
the errors made by dialog state trackers
was not discussed in depth. For the new
challenge, DSTC 2, this paper describes
several techniques for examining the er-
rors made by the dialog state trackers in or-
der to refine our understanding of the lim-
itations of various approaches to the track-
ing process. The results indicate that no
one approach is universally superior, and
that different approaches yield different er-
ror type distributions. Furthermore, the
results show that a pairwise comparative
analysis of tracker performance is a useful
tool for identifying dialogs where differ-
ential behavior is observed. These dialogs
can provide a data source for a more care-
ful analysis of the source of errors.

1 Introduction

The Dialog State Tracking Challenge (Henderson
et al., 2013) provides a framework for compari-
son of different approaches to tracking dialog state
within the context of an information-seeking dia-
log, specifically information about restaurants in
the Cambridge, UK, area. The challenge makes
available an annotated corpus that includes system
logs from actual human-machine dialog interac-
tions. These logs include information about the
system dialog acts, the N-best speech recognition
hypotheses, and the hypothesized interpretation
(including confidence estimates) of the user’s spo-
ken utterances as provided by the dialog system’s
Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) module.

Consequently, standalone algorithms for track-
ing the state of the dialog can be developed and
tested. While performance as part of an actual
dialog interaction cannot easily be evaluated (be-
cause differing results produced by different track-
ers may lead to different choices for system dialog
acts in a real-time interaction), performance on a
turn-by-turn basis can be evaluated and compared.

Results from the first challenge were presented
in several papers at SIGDial 2013 (general refer-
ence Williams et al. (2013)) and highlighted sev-
eral different approaches. These papers focused
on comparative performance as well as a descrip-
tion of the various techniques for tracking dialog
state that were employed. However, there was no
detailed error analysis about tracker performance,
either within or across trackers. Such analysis can
help further our understanding of the sources and
impact of dialog miscommunication. This paper
presents such an analysis from the current Dia-
log State Tracking Challenge (DSTC 2) using the
publicly available results of the challenge (http:
//camdial.org/˜mh521/dstc/). This pa-
per describes techniques for examining the follow-
ing aspects of performance as it relates to tracking
errors and their potential impact on effective com-
munication in dialog.

• Estimating an upper bound on accuracy.

• Error distribution as a function of tracker—
both globally and subdivided by acoustic
model or attribute type.

• Pairwise comparative accuracy of trackers—
for what types of dialogs does one tracker
perform better than another?

Initial results based on application of these tech-
niques are also presented.

2 Data Source: DSTC 2

DSTC 2 is based on corpora collected on dialogs
about restaurant information for Cambridge, UK.
Besides introducing a different domain from the
original DSTC (that dealt with bus timetables)
DSTC 2 is structured in such a way as to allow
for the possibility of changing user goals and thus
represents a more significant challenge for dialog
state tracking. An overview of the current chal-
lenge and results can be found in Henderson et al.
(2014).

2.1 Nature of Dialogs

Unlike the dialogs of the original DSTC that were
based on actual uses of the bus timetable informa-
tion system, the dialogs for DSTC 2 were collected
in the more traditional experimental paradigm
where system users were given a dialog scenario
to follow. Example scenario descriptions extracted
from two of the log files are given below.

• Task 09825: You want to
find a cheap restaurant and
it should be in the south part
of town. Make sure you get
the address and phone number.

• Task 05454: You want to find
an expensive restaurant and it
should serve malaysian food.
If there is no such venue how
about korean type of food.
Make sure you get the address
and area of the venue.

The basic structure of the dialogs has the fol-
lowing pattern.

1. Acquire from the user a set of constraints
about the type of restaurant desired. Users
may supply constraint information about
area, food, name, and price range. This phase
may require multiple iterations as user goals
change.

2. Once the constraints have been acquired, pro-
vide information about one or more restau-
rants that satisfy the constraints. Users
may request that additional attributes about
a restaurant be provided (such as address and
phone number).

2.2 Measuring Task Performance
Because of the complex nature of statistical dia-
log state tracking there are many different reason-
able ways to measure tracker performance. Be-
sides evaluating the accuracy of the 1-best hypoth-
esis there are also a number of possible measures
based on the quality of the estimate for dialog state
(see Henderson et al. (2013) for details).

For the purpose of this paper the analysis will be
based on tracker performance on accuracy (1-best
quality) for the joint goal based on the four previ-
ously mentioned constraint attributes (area, food,
name, and price range). The reason for this choice
is that in an actual human-system dialog in an
information-seeking domain, the dialog manager
must choose an action based on the system’s be-
liefs about the constraining attributes. While level
of belief might positively influence when to en-
gage in explicit or implicit confirmation, ultimate
success depends on correct identification of values
for the constraining attributes. Having too much
confidence in inaccurate information has always
been a major error source in dialog systems. Con-
sequently, 1-best joint goal accuracy is the focus
of study in this paper.

2.3 Description of Error Types
Since we are focused on joint goal accuracy, er-
ror type classification will be based on the follow-
ing three types of possible deviations from the true
joint goal label for a given turn.

1. Missing Attributes (MA) - these are situa-
tions where a value for an attribute has been
specified in the actual data (e.g. “belgian”
for the attribute “food”), but the dialog state
tracker has no value for the attribute in the
joint belief state.1

2. Extraneous Attributes (EA) - these are situ-
ations where the tracker has a value for the
attribute in the joint belief state, but the at-
tribute has not been mentioned in the actual
dialog.

1The format of DSTC 2 allows for automatic compilation
of the joint belief state by the scoring software. The probabil-
ity mass for a given attribute that is not assigned to specific
values for attributes is assigned to a special value None. If no
value for the attribute has a probability estimate exceeding
None, then no value for that attribute is included in the joint
belief state. It is also possible for a dialog state tracker to ex-
plicitly provide a joint belief state. In DSTC 2 some systems
do explicitly provide a joint belief state while others use the
default.

301



3. False Attributes (FA) - these are situations
where a value for an attribute has been spec-
ified in the actual data (e.g. “catalan” for the
attribute “food”), but the dialog state tracker
has a different value (such as “fusion” for
“food”).

For turns where there are errors, it is certainly
possible that multiple errors occur, both multiple
errors of a given type, and multiple errors of dif-
ferent types. This is taken into consideration as
described next.

2.4 Recording Tracker Performance

For each tracker a data file consists of a sequence
of tuples of the form (Correct,EA,MA,FA) that
were generated for each turn for which there was a
valid joint goal label.2. The meaning of each value
in the tuple is given below.

• Correct - has the value 1 if the tracker joint
goal label is correct and 0 if it was incorrect.

• EA - a count of the number of different ex-
traneous attributes that occurred in the turn.
Will always be 0 if Correct = 1.

• MA - a count of the number of different
missing attributes that occurred in the turn.
Will always be 0 if Correct = 1.

• FA - a count of the number of different false
attributes that occurred in the turn. Will al-
ways be 0 if Correct = 1.

Consequently, whenever Correct is 1, the tuple
will always be of the form (1,0,0,0). If Correct is
0, at least one of the three following entries in the
tuple will have a non-zero value.

These files were generated by modifying the
scoring script provided by the DSTC organizing
committee. The modification causes the neces-
sary information to be output for each relevant
turn. These data files represent the result of tracker
performance on 1117 dialogs over a total of 9689
turns.

2In some cases at the start of dialogs, no SLU hypothe-
ses have yet to mention any values for any of the joint goal
attributes. As mentioned in Henderson et al. (2013), those
turns are not included in the joint-goal accuracy evaluation.
This occurred in a total of 201 turns over 193 dialogs.

2.5 Mapping Labels to Dialogs

Another modified version of the scoring script was
used to iterate through the dialogs to produce a
template that associates each of the 9689 labeled
turns with the specific (dialog ID, turn within dia-
log) pair that the turn represents. This information
was used in the error analysis process to identify
specific dialogs for which tracking was not partic-
ularly accurate (see section 4).

2.6 Choice of Trackers

There were a total of 9 different teams that sub-
mitted a total of 31 trackers for DSTC 2. For this
study, one tracker from each team is being used.
The choice of tracker is the one that performed
the best on 1-best joint goal accuracy, one of the
overall “featured metrics” of the challenge (Hen-
derson et al., 2013). Their performance on this
metric ranged from 50.0% to 78.4%. Seven of the
nine trackers had performance of better than 69%,
while there were two performance outliers at 50%
and 60%.

For purposes of this study, it seemed best to
include a tracker from all groups since part of
the intent of the challenge is to carefully exam-
ine the impact of different approaches to dialog
state tracking. Based on the optional descrip-
tions that teams submitted to the challenge, there
were quite a variety of approaches taken (though
not all teams provided a description). Some sys-
tems used the original SLU results. Other sys-
tems ignored the original SLU results and fo-
cused on the ASR hypotheses. Some systems cre-
ated their own modified versions of the original
SLU results. Modeling approaches included Max-
imum Entropy Markov model, Deep Neural Net-
work model, rule-based models, Hidden Informa-
tion State models, and conditional random fields.
Hybrid approaches were used as well. A few more
details about our submitted tracker will be pro-
vided in section 4.

One of the purposes of this study was to look
at the distribution of errors based on the different
types discussed in section 2.3, both in absolute and
relative terms. Consequently, one intended inves-
tigation is to see if there is a difference in error
type distribution depending on a number of param-
eters, including the approach used to dialog state
tracking. Thus, examining the results from the top
trackers of all teams can provide valuable infor-
mation regardless of the absolute accuracy of the

302



tracker. As it turned out, each tracker studied had
multiple turns where it was the only tracker to pro-
vide a correct joint goal label. This happened on
about 4% of all the turns. The number of turns for
which a tracker was the only tracker to provide a
correct joint goal label ranged from 5 to 89 and
tended to follow the general ranking of accuracy
(i.e., more accurate trackers tended to have more
turns where it was the only tracker correct). How-
ever, it did not follow the relative rankings pre-
cisely.

3 Analysis: Global Tracker Performance

3.1 How much misunderstanding can be
expected?

Another way to ask this question would be, “what
error rate should be expected from a high perfor-
mance tracker? For example, there were 21 di-
alogs consisting of 8 user turns or more where
none of the trackers under study correctly repre-
sented the joint goal for any turn.

Looking more broadly, there were 1332 turns
over the entire set of dialogs for which none of
the trackers had a correct representation of the
joint goal. Thus, if we could construct an “oracle”
tracker that could always select the correct repre-
sentation of the joint goal from among the nine
trackers under study (when at least one of them
had the correct representation), this would imply
an error rate of 13.7%.3 This contrasts with an er-
ror rate of 21.6% for the best performing tracker
submitted as part of DSTC 2. If we look at tracker
performance as a function of acoustic model (ar-
tificially degraded (A0), and optimized (A1)), the
error rate estimate for the oracle tracker is 17.0%
using model A0 and 10.3% using model A1.

3.2 Global Error Type Distribution

Using the classification of error types described
in section 2.3: Extraneous Attributes (EA), Miss-
ing Attributes (MA), and False Attributes (FA),
we can explore the distribution of error types as
a function of the dialog tracker. Table 1 provides a
summary view of the distributions over all the di-
alogs of the test set. For comparison, the baseline
focus tracker provided by the DSTC 2 organizers

3Note that this is not any sort of an absolute estimate.
For example, if provided baseline trackers are included (one
provided by the DSTC 2 organizers and another by Zhuoran
Wang of Heriot-Watt University), the number of turns where
no tracker correctly represents the joint goal reduces to 1325
turns.

(see Henderson et al. (2013)) and the HWU base-
line tracker provided by Zhuoran Wang of Heriot-
Watt University (see http://camdial.org/
˜mh521/dstc/) are also included. While track-
ers 1 and 9 are also presented for completeness,
the main focus of the analysis is on trackers 2
through 8, the trackers with higher levels of per-
formance on the featured metric of 1-best joint
goal accuracy. Each row represents the relative
distribution of errors by a given tracker. For ex-
ample, for our tracker, tracker 3, there were 2629
turns (out of the total 9689 turns) where the tracker
made one or more errors for the attributes of the
joint goal. There were a total of 3075 different
attribute errors of which 545 or 17.7% of the er-
rors were of type EA, 1341 or 43.6% were of type
MA, and 1189 or 38.7% of type FA. A visual rep-
resentation of this information is provided in the
Appendix in figure 1. Some general observations
are the following.

• Other than tracker 5, the relative number of
errors of type MA exceeded the relative num-
ber of errors of type FA. For attributes actu-
ally mentioned by the user, trackers in gen-
eral were more likely to reject a correct hy-
pothesis (leading to a type MA error) than
accept an incorrect hypothesis (leading to a
type FA error).

• Based on the brief description provided with
submission of the tracker, tracker 5 uses a hy-
brid approach for tracking the different goals
(one of the baseline trackers for the food at-
tribute, but an n-best approach to the oth-
ers). This approach seemed to lead to the
acceptance of more spurious hypotheses than
the other trackers (hence the higher EA rate).
Tracker 8 also had a slightly higher error rate
for EA. Its submission description indicates
the combined use of several models, at least
one of which used the training data for devel-
oping model parameters.

3.3 Error Type Distribution as a Function of
Acoustic Model

Since publicly available spoken dialog systems
cannot control the environment in which they are
used, speech recognition rates can vary widely.
One of the general goals of the DSTC is to eval-
uate tracker performance for varying levels of
speech recognition accuracy. Hence the use in

Table 1: Error Distribution: all dialogs

DSTC 2 of two acoustic models: model A1 which
is a model optimized for the domain, and model
A0 which has artificially degraded acoustic mod-
els (Henderson et al., 2013). For the test set, there
were 542 dialogs yielding 4994 turns with joint
goal labels for model A0, and 575 dialogs yielding
4695 turns with joint goal labels for model A1. It
is unsurprising that the average number of turns in
a dialog was shorter for the dialogs using the more
accurate speech recognizer.

The previous table looked at the global behav-
ior combining all the dialogs. An interesting ques-
tion to examine is if the error distributions change
as a function of acoustic model. Tables 2 and 3
give some insight into that question. Table 2, the
results using the optimized model A1, unsurpris-
ingly shows that when the speech signal is bet-
ter and by implication the SLU confidence scores
are stronger and more accurate, the relative rate
of type FA errors declines while the relative rate
of type MA errors increases (when compared to
the overall results of Table 1). For errors of type
EA it is about an even split—for some the relative
number of EA errors decreases, and for some it in-
creases. The results in Table 3 for the A0 model
show the opposite trend for the relative errors of
type MA compared to type FA.

3.4 Error Type Distribution as a Function of
Attribute

While it is future work to do an exact count to de-
termine the frequency with which the four differ-
ent constraining attributes (area, food, name, and
price range) are actually mentioned in the dialogs,
it is clear from the data that the primary objects

of conversation are area, food, and price range.
This makes sense, since there are often alterna-
tive effective ways to access information about a
restaurant other than to interact with a dialog sys-
tem given that the name has already been deter-
mined by the user.4 Consequently, for the remain-
ing three attributes, an investigation into the rela-
tive distribution of errors as a function of attribute
type within error type was conducted. The results
are presented in Table 4. This table is looking at
all the test data combined and not separating by
acoustic model. Again the focus of discussion will
be trackers 2 through 8. For brevity, the results for
error type FA are omitted as they are pretty similar
for all trackers.

relative error rate for food >> than rel-
ative error rate for area >> than relative
error rate for price range.

This follows naturally from the fact that there are
91 possible values for food, 5 possible values for
area, and only 3 possible values for price range.
Thus, there are many more possibilities for confu-
sion for the value for the food attribute. When we
examine the results in Table 4, there are a variety
of interesting observations.

• Within error type EA, the only trackers for
which the relative error rate for price range
exceeds the relative error rate for area are
trackers 5 and 7.

• Trackers 3 and 4 are more prone to have EA
errors for the food attribute.

4One of the anonymous reviewers pointed out that the
choice of scenarios used in the data collection process is also
a factor.

• Trackers 2, 6, 7, and 8 all have a noticeable
jump in the relative error rate for the food at-
tribute for type MA errors over type EA er-
rors. In contrast, trackers 3, 4, and 5 show a
noticeable decrease.

What of course is missing from these obser-
vations is any conjecture of causality based on
a careful analysis of individual tracker behav-
ior. Given the lack of accessibility to the details
of system implementations for all the trackers,
other techniques of investigation are needed. The
next section explores another potentially valuable
technique—comparing the results of two trackers
on a turn-by-turn basis, and using these results
to identify particular dialogs that exhibit radically
different outcomes in performance.

4 Analysis: Pairwise Comparative
Accuracy

Another avenue of analysis is to directly compare
the performance of two trackers. How do they dif-
fer in terms of the types of dialog situations that
they handle effectively? We will examine these
issues through comparison of the top performing

tracker in the challenge (with respect to the fea-
tured metric 1-best joint goal accuracy) with our
tracker entry, Pirate.5

4.1 Pirate methodology: what should dialog
expectation mean?

The overarching philosophy behind the develop-
ment of Pirate is simply the following.

There is belief about what we think we
know, but there should also be an expec-
tation about what comes next if we are
correct.

One of the first dialog systems to make use of
a hierarchy of dialog expectations was the Circuit
Fix-It Shop (Smith et al., 1995) which was also
one of the first working dialog systems to be care-
fully and extensively evaluated (Smith and Gor-
don, 1997) and (Smith, 1998). However, at the
time, the ability to make use of large corpora in
system development was largely non-existent.6

Our approach in DSTC 2 for making use of
the extensive training data combined the SLU hy-
potheses with confidence scores (interpreted as
probabilities) with a simple statistical model of
dialog expectation to create modified SLU con-
fidence scores. The model of dialog expectation
was based on a simple bigram model using fre-
quency counts for (system dialog act, user speech
act) pairs. This can be normalized into a prob-
abilistic model that gives the probability of a user
speech act given the context of the most recent sys-
tem dialog act to which the user is responding. The
equation used to modify SLU confidence scores is
the following. Let Prob(SLU) represent the con-
fidence score (expressed as a probability) for the
hypothesis SLU , and let V al(SLU) represent the
actual hypothesis (e.g. inform(food = belgian)).

Prob(SLUmod) = 0.7∗Prob(SLU)+0.3∗Expct
where Prob(SLU) is the original confidence
score for the hypothesis, and Expct is the prob-
ability of the occurrence of the speech act used

5The mascot name of East Carolina sports teams is the
Pirates. In addition, the code development process for our
tracker was based on modification of the simple baseline
tracker provided by the DSTC 2 organizers.

6Moody (1988) used the Wizard-of-Oz paradigm to col-
lect dialogs relevant to the Circuit Fix-It Shop domain as
part of her research into the effects of restricted vocabulary
on discourse structure, but the total number of dialogs was
about 100. In contrast, DSTC 2 provided 1612 actual human-
computer dialogs for the training set, 506 dialogs for the de-
velopment set, and 1117 dialogs for the test set.

in the SLU hypothesis given the current system
speech act (i.e., the probability that comes from
the statistical model of dialog expectation). The
0.3 weighting factor was determined through trial
and error to perform the best given the training
data (basing performance on 1-best joint goal ac-
curacy).7

After calculating the modified values, the scores
are renormalized so that the confidence values
sum to 1. Given the renormalized values for
Prob(SLUmod), dialog state was updated by us-
ing the following rules. Let V al(HypCur) repre-
sent the current hypothesis in the dialog state for
the value of an attribute, and its confidence score
be denoted by Prob(HypCur).

1. Increase Prob(SLUmod) by Prob(X)
where V al(X) == NULL (i.e. the default
NULL hypothesis for the SLU), whenever
Prob(X) is < 0.5. Reset Prob(X) to 0.

2. Replace HypCur with the highest scoring
SLUmod for that attribute if the user speech
act is an inform, and the following relation-
ship holds.

Prob(SLUmod) + Tol ≥ Prob(HypCur)

where Tol is an experimentally determined
tolerance value (currently set at 0.1).

3. If the system speech act was a canthelp
act that specifies particular attribute values
(e.g. food = belgian), and the current cho-
sen hypothesis (SLUmod) provides informa-
tion about that attribute, overwrite the state

combining dialog history with the current utterance to calcu-
late probabilities, see Raux and Ma (2011).

information for the attribute listed in canthelp
even if the confidence score is less.

The motivation for these rules comes from the
assumption that the Gricean Cooperative Principle
for conversation (Grice, 1975) applies to this di-
alog environment. Given this assumption, rule 1
is based on the belief that the human dialog par-
ticipant is attempting to make an appropriate dia-
log contribution at every turn. Consequently when
reasonable, we will augment the top hypothesized
SLU’s confidence score with any weight given to
the NULL hypothesis. Rule 2 is based on the idea
that an intended new contribution should replace
a previous contribution and that some allowance
should be made for “signal noise” in calculating
SLU confidence. Rule 3 reflects the idea that when
the system cannot provide assistance about a spec-
ified attribute value, any new information about
the attribute should be considered a replacement.

The above rules are for updating choices for
the individual attributes that are possible compo-
nents of the goal state (area, food, name and price
range). In our modeling of dialog state, we only
maintain the top actual hypothesis for each at-
tribute, For producing the joint goal, we used the
default that the joint goal is the product of the
marginal goals.8

With this fairly simple approach, Pirate had a
1-best joint goal accuracy of 72.9%. This accu-
racy rate exceeded the performance of all baseline
trackers, and was 13th out of 31 for the trackers
submitted.9

8Consequently, if our confidence score for the top hypoth-
esis is < 0.5, that hypothesis will not be included in the joint
goal, as the default “None” is associated with higher confi-
dence.

9The set of 12 trackers that performed better is comprised
of 4 trackers each from 3 other teams.

4.2 Comparison to the Best Performing
Tracker

An entry from team2 achieved 78.4% accuracy on
the 1-best joint goal accuracy metric. A compar-
ative analysis was conducted whereby the perfor-
mance of each tracker was compared on a turn-by-
turn basis. Highlights of this analysis include the
following.

• The two trackers were both correct 70.6% of
the time and both incorrect 19.3% of the time.

• 7.8% of the time Pirate was incorrect when
the team2 tracker was correct.

• 2.2% of the time, Pirate was correct when the
team2 tracker was incorrect.

Further exploration examined performance
within dialogs. It was discovered that there
were 18 dialogs where Pirate was incorrect for
at least 8 turns where the team2 tracker was cor-
rect. Furthermore, there were no turns in those di-
alogs where the team2 tracker was incorrect when
Pirate was correct. Given that the team2 tracker
performed several percentage points better over-
all, this is not surprising. What might be surprising
is that there are 7 dialogs where the opposite was
true, and Pirate performed better than the team2
tracker. An initial glance at an actual dialog from
each situation indicated the following.

• While team2 did not offer a description of
their methodology in their submission, it can
be inferred that they used the original ASR
hypotheses as part of its dialog state track-
ing. Pirate was unable to detect in the 2nd
turn that the goal (area=dontcare) was being
communicated because it did not show up in
the SLU hypotheses. However, the top ASR
hypothesis was “area”. Integrating SLU with
dialog context is known to be a good idea
when technically feasible, and is borne out by
this example. This missing attribute for goal
state was propagated throughout all subse-
quent turns of the dialog. However, it should
be noted that omitting an attribute where the
correct value is “dontcare” is a somewhat be-
nign error as discussed in the next example.

• The dialog reviewed where the team2 tracker
had trouble that Pirate did not revolved
around the fact that at an important mo-
ment in the dialog, the team2 tracker

added an unstated hypothesis of the form
(food=dontcare) to its joint goal. This was
retained for the duration of the dialog. It can
be readily argued that this is a benign error.
If the user never explicitly gave a constraint
about food (implying that None is the correct
value for the attribute), the dialog manager
is not likely to make a wrong decision if it’s
basing its action instead on (food=dontcare).

Time constraints have prohibited further exam-
ination of the other dialogs, but clearly this is a
fruitful area of exploration for understanding be-
havioral differences between approaches to dialog
state tracking.

5 Conclusion

A primary motivation of the DSTC is to allow
for direct comparisons between alternative ap-
proaches to dialog state tracking. The results from
DSTC 1 focused on performance aspects with-
out providing a detailed analysis of errors sources.
This paper describes several techniques for exam-
ining the errors made by the dialog state trackers in
order to refine our understanding of the limitations
of various approaches to the tracking process.

Though the analysis at this point is incomplete,
one immediate observation is that no one approach
is universally superior to other approaches with re-
spect to the performance metric 1-best joint goal
accuracy. However, being able to carefully de-
termine the conditions under which one approach
outperforms another and determining if there are
ways to combine alternative techniques into a
more effective but sufficiently efficient tracking
model is very much an unsolved problem. The
results from this paper suggest that a careful anal-
ysis of errors can provide further insight into our
knowledge about the difficult challenge of dialog
state tracking. We would like to explore some
of the trends observed with appropriate statisti-
cal tests as well as look more carefully at di-
alogs where pairwise comparative analysis indi-
cates highly differential behavior.

Figure 1: Error Distribution: all dialogs

Appendix

Figure 1 displays in a graphical fashion the er-
ror counts for the different types of missing at-
tributes for the trackers listed in Table 1. For
clarity, the data for trackers 1 and 9 are omitted.
“Focus” is the baseline focus tracker provided by
the DSTC 2 organizers (Henderson et al., 2013),
and “HWU” is the baseline tracker provided by
Zhuoran Wang (see http://camdial.org/
˜mh521/dstc/). “Trk 3” is our tracker, Pirate.
As a reminder, the best overall performing tracker
is the one labeled “Trk 2”. One observation from
the figure is that its best performance is in mini-
mizing False Attribute (FA) errors.
