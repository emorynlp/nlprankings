Abstract

We introduce a spectral learning algorithm for
latent-variable PCFGs (Petrov et al., 2006).
Under a separability (singular value) condi-
tion, we prove that the method provides con-
sistent parameter estimates.

1 Introduction
Statistical models with hidden or latent variables are
of great importance in natural language processing,
speech, and many other fields. The EM algorithm is
a remarkably successful method for parameter esti-
mation within these models: it is simple, it is often
relatively efficient, and it has well understood formal
properties. It does, however, have a major limitation:
it has no guarantee of finding the global optimum of
the likelihood function. From a theoretical perspec-
tive, this means that the EM algorithm is not guar-
anteed to give consistent parameter estimates. From
a practical perspective, problems with local optima
can be difficult to deal with.

Recent work has introduced polynomial-time
learning algorithms (and consistent estimation meth-
ods) for two important cases of hidden-variable
models: Gaussian mixture models (Dasgupta, 1999;
Vempala and Wang, 2004) and hidden Markov mod-
els (Hsu et al., 2009). These algorithms use spec-
tral methods: that is, algorithms based on eigen-
vector decompositions of linear systems, in particu-
lar singular value decomposition (SVD). In the gen-
eral case, learning of HMMs or GMMs is intractable
(e.g., see Terwijn, 2002). Spectral methods finesse
the problem of intractibility by assuming separabil-
ity conditions. For example, the algorithm of Hsu
et al. (2009) has a sample complexity that is polyno-
mial in 1/σ, where σ is the minimum singular value
of an underlying decomposition. These methods are
not susceptible to problems with local maxima, and
give consistent parameter estimates.

In this paper we derive a spectral algorithm
for learning of latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs)
(Petrov et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2005). Our

method involves a significant extension of the tech-
niques from Hsu et al. (2009). L-PCFGs have been
shown to be a very effective model for natural lan-
guage parsing. Under a separation (singular value)
condition, our algorithm provides consistent param-
eter estimates; this is in contrast with previous work,
which has used the EM algorithm for parameter es-
timation, with the usual problems of local optima.

The parameter estimation algorithm (see figure 4)
is simple and efficient. The first step is to take
an SVD of the training examples, followed by a
projection of the training examples down to a low-
dimensional space. In a second step, empirical av-
erages are calculated on the training example, fol-
lowed by standard matrix operations. On test ex-
amples, simple (tensor-based) variants of the inside-
outside algorithm (figures 2 and 3) can be used to
calculate probabilities and marginals of interest.

Our method depends on the following results:
• Tensor form of the inside-outside algorithm.

Section 5 shows that the inside-outside algorithm for
L-PCFGs can be written using tensors. Theorem 1
gives conditions under which the tensor form calcu-
lates inside and outside terms correctly.
• Observable representations. Section 6 shows

that under a singular-value condition, there is an ob-
servable form for the tensors required by the inside-
outside algorithm. By an observable form, we fol-
low the terminology of Hsu et al. (2009) in referring
to quantities that can be estimated directly from data
where values for latent variables are unobserved.
Theorem 2 shows that tensors derived from the ob-
servable form satisfy the conditions of theorem 1.
• Estimating the model. Section 7 gives an al-

gorithm for estimating parameters of the observable
representation from training data. Theorem 3 gives a
sample complexity result, showing that the estimates
converge to the true distribution at a rate of 1/

√
M

where M is the number of training examples.
The algorithm is strikingly different from the EM

algorithm for L-PCFGs, both in its basic form, and
in its consistency guarantees. The techniques de-

223



veloped in this paper are quite general, and should
be relevant to the development of spectral methods
for estimation in other models in NLP, for exam-
ple alignment models for translation, synchronous
PCFGs, and so on. The tensor form of the inside-
outside algorithm gives a new view of basic calcula-
tions in PCFGs, and may itself lead to new models.

2 Related Work
For work on L-PCFGs using the EM algorithm, see
Petrov et al. (2006), Matsuzaki et al. (2005), Pereira
and Schabes (1992). Our work builds on meth-
ods for learning of HMMs (Hsu et al., 2009; Fos-
ter et al., 2012; Jaeger, 2000), but involves sev-
eral extensions: in particular in the tensor form of
the inside-outside algorithm, and observable repre-
sentations for the tensor form. Balle et al. (2011)
consider spectral learning of finite-state transducers;
Lugue et al. (2012) considers spectral learning of
head automata for dependency parsing. Parikh et al.
(2011) consider spectral learning algorithms of tree-
structured directed bayes nets.

3 Notation
Given a matrix A or a vector v, we write A⊤ or v⊤

for the associated transpose. For any integer n ≥ 1,
we use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, . . . n}. For any
row or column vector y ∈ Rm, we use diag(y) to
refer to the (m×m) matrix with diagonal elements
equal to yh for h = 1 . . . m, and off-diagonal ele-
ments equal to 0. For any statement Γ, we use [[Γ]]
to refer to the indicator function that is 1 if Γ is true,
and 0 if Γ is false. For a random variable X, we use
E[X] to denote its expected value.

We will make (quite limited) use of tensors:

Definition 1 A tensor C ∈ R(m×m×m) is a set of
m3 parameters Ci,j,k for i, j, k ∈ [m]. Given a ten-
sor C , and a vector y ∈ Rm, we define C(y) to be
the (m × m) matrix with components [C(y)]i,j =
∑

k∈[m]Ci,j,kyk. Hence C can be interpreted as a

function C : Rm → R(m×m) that maps a vector
y ∈ Rm to a matrix C(y) of dimension (m×m).

In addition, we define the tensor C∗ ∈ R(m×m×m)
for any tensor C ∈ R(m×m×m) to have values

[C∗]i,j,k = Ck,j,i

Finally, for vectors x, y, z ∈ Rm, xy⊤z⊤ is the
tensor D ∈ Rm×m×m where Dj,k,l = xjykzl (this
is analogous to the outer product: [xy⊤]j,k = xjyk).

4 L-PCFGs: Basic Definitions
This section gives a definition of the L-PCFG for-
malism used in this paper. An L-PCFG is a 5-tuple
(N ,I,P,m, n) where:
• N is the set of non-terminal symbols in the

grammar. I ⊂ N is a finite set of in-terminals.
P ⊂ N is a finite set of pre-terminals. We assume
that N = I ∪ P, and I ∩ P = ∅. Hence we have
partitioned the set of non-terminals into two subsets.
• [m] is the set of possible hidden states.
• [n] is the set of possible words.
• For all a ∈ I , b ∈ N , c ∈ N , h1, h2, h3 ∈ [m],

we have a context-free rule a(h1) → b(h2) c(h3).
• For all a ∈ P, h ∈ [m], x ∈ [n], we have a

context-free rule a(h) → x.
Hence each in-terminal a ∈ I is always the left-

hand-side of a binary rule a → b c; and each pre-
terminal a ∈ P is always the left-hand-side of a
rule a → x. Assuming that the non-terminals in
the grammar can be partitioned this way is relatively
benign, and makes the estimation problem cleaner.

We define the set of possible “skeletal rules” as
R = {a → b c : a ∈ I, b ∈ N , c ∈ N}. The
parameters of the model are as follows:
• For each a→ b c ∈ R, and h ∈ [m], we have

a parameter q(a → b c|h, a). For each a ∈ P,
x ∈ [n], and h ∈ [m], we have a parameter
q(a → x|h, a). For each a → b c ∈ R, and
h, h′ ∈ [m], we have parameters s(h′|h, a → b c)
and t(h′|h, a→ b c).

These definitions give a PCFG, with rule proba-
bilities

p(a(h1) → b(h2) c(h3)|a(h1)) =
q(a→ b c|h1, a)× s(h2|h1, a→ b c)× t(h3|h1, a→ b c)

and p(a(h) → x|a(h)) = q(a→ x|h, a).
In addition, for each a ∈ I , for each h ∈ [m], we

have a parameter π(a, h) which is the probability of
non-terminal a paired with hidden variable h being
at the root of the tree.

An L-PCFG defines a distribution over parse trees
as follows. A skeletal tree (s-tree) is a sequence of
rules r1 . . . rN where each ri is either of the form
a → b c or a → x. The rule sequence forms
a top-down, left-most derivation under a CFG with
skeletal rules. See figure 1 for an example.

A full tree consists of an s-tree r1 . . . rN , together
with values h1 . . . hN . Each hi is the value for

Each hi can take any value in [m].

Define ai to be the non-terminal on the left-hand-
side of rule ri. For any i ∈ {2 . . . N} define pa(i)
to be the index of the rule above node i in the tree.
Define L ⊂ [N ] to be the set of nodes in the tree
which are the left-child of some parent, and R ⊂
[N ] to be the set of nodes which are the right-child of
some parent. The probability mass function (PMF)
over full trees is then

In the remainder of this paper, we make use of ma-
trix form of parameters of an L-PCFG, as follows:
• For each a→ b c ∈ R, we define Qa→b c ∈

R
m×m to be the matrix with values q(a → b c|h, a)

for h = 1, 2, . . . m on its diagonal, and 0 values for
its off-diagonal elements. Similarly, for each a ∈ P,
x ∈ [n], we define Qa→x ∈ Rm×m to be the matrix
with values q(a→ x|h, a) for h = 1, 2, . . . m on its
diagonal, and 0 values for its off-diagonal elements.
• For each a → b c ∈ R, we define Sa→b c ∈

R
m×m where [Sa→b c]h′,h = s(h′|h, a→ b c).
• For each a → b c ∈ R, we define T a→b c ∈

R
m×m where [T a→b c]h′,h = t(h′|h, a→ b c).
• For each a ∈ I , we define the vector πa ∈ Rm

where [πa]h = π(a, h).

5 Tensor Form of the Inside-Outside
Algorithm

Given an L-PCFG, two calculations are central:

Inputs: s-tree r1 . . . rN , L-PCFG (N , I,P ,m, n), parameters

• Ca→b c ∈ R(m×m×m) for all a→ b c ∈ R
• c∞a→x ∈ R

(1×m) for all a ∈ P , x ∈ [n]

• c1a ∈ R
(m×1) for all a ∈ I.

Algorithm: (calculate the f i terms bottom-up in the tree)

• For all i ∈ [N ] such that ai ∈ P , f i = c∞ri
• For all i ∈ [N ] such that ai ∈ I, f i = fγCri(fβ) where
β is the index of the left child of node i in the tree, and γ
is the index of the right child.

Return: f1c1a1 = p(r1 . . . rN)

p(r1 . . . rN ).

2. For a given input sentence x = x1 . . . xN , cal-
culate the marginal probabilities

µ(a, i, j) =
∑

τ∈T (x):(a,i,j)∈τ

p(τ)

for each non-terminal a ∈ N , for each (i, j)
such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N .

Here T (x) denotes the set of all possible s-trees for
the sentence x, and we write (a, i, j) ∈ τ if non-
terminal a spans words xi . . . xj in the parse tree τ .

The marginal probabilities have a number of uses.
Perhaps most importantly, for a given sentence x =
x1 . . . xN , the parsing algorithm of Goodman (1996)
can be used to find

arg max
τ∈T (x)

∑

(a,i,j)∈τ

µ(a, i, j)

This is the parsing algorithm used by Petrov et al.
(2006), for example. In addition, we can calcu-
late the probability for an input sentence, p(x) =
∑

τ∈T (x) p(τ), as p(x) =
∑

a∈I µ(a, 1, N).
Variants of the inside-outside algorithm can be

used for problems 1 and 2. This section introduces a
novel form of these algorithms, using tensors. This
is the first step in deriving the spectral estimation
method.

The algorithms are shown in figures 2 and 3. Each
algorithm takes the following inputs:

1. A tensor Ca→b c ∈ R(m×m×m) for each rule
a→ b c.

2. A vector c∞a→x ∈ R(1×m) for each rule a→ x.

225



3. A vector c1a ∈ R(m×1) for each a ∈ I .
The following theorem gives conditions under

which the algorithms are correct:

Theorem 1 Assume that we have an L-PCFG with
parameters Qa→x, Qa→b c, T a→b c, Sa→b c, πa, and
that there exist matrices Ga ∈ R(m×m) for all a ∈
N such that each Ga is invertible, and such that:

1. For all rules a→ b c, Ca→b c(y) =
GcT a→b cdiag(yGbSa→b c)Qa→b c(Ga)−1

2. For all rules a→ x, c∞a→x = 1⊤Qa→x(Ga)−1

3. For all a ∈ I , c1a = Gaπa

Then: 1) The algorithm in figure 2 correctly com-
putes p(r1 . . . rN ) under the L-PCFG. 2) The algo-
rithm in figure 3 correctly computes the marginals
µ(a, i, j) under the L-PCFG.

Proof: See section 9.1.

6 Estimating the Tensor Model
A crucial result is that it is possible to directly esti-
mate parameters Ca→b c, c∞a→x and c

1
a that satisfy the

conditions in theorem 1, from a training sample con-
sisting of s-trees (i.e., trees where hidden variables
are unobserved). We first describe random variables
underlying the approach, then describe observable
representations based on these random variables.

6.1 Random Variables Underlying the Approach

Each s-tree with N rules r1 . . . rN has N nodes. We
will use the s-tree in figure 1 as a running example.

Each node has an associated rule: for example,
node 2 in the tree in figure 1 has the rule NP→ D N.
If the rule at a node is of the form a→ b c, then there
are left and right inside trees below the left child and
right child of the rule. For example, for node 2 we
have a left inside tree rooted at node 3, and a right
inside tree rooted at node 4 (in this case the left and
right inside trees both contain only a single rule pro-
duction, of the form a → x; however in the general
case they might be arbitrary subtrees).

In addition, each node has an outside tree. For
node 2, the outside tree is

Data structures:

• Each αa,i,j ∈ R1×m for a ∈ N , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N is a
row vector of inside terms.

• Each βa,i,j ∈ Rm×1 for a ∈ N , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N is a
column vector of outside terms.

• Each µ(a, i, j) ∈ R for a ∈ N , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N is a
marginal probability.

Figure 3: The tensor form of the inside-outside algorithm,
for calculation of marginal terms µ(a, i, j).

The outside tree contains everything in the s-tree
r1 . . . rN , excluding the subtree below node i.

Our random variables are defined as follows.
First, we select a random internal node, from a ran-
dom tree, as follows:

• Sample an s-tree r1 . . . rN from the PMF
p(r1 . . . rN ). Choose a node i uniformly at ran-
dom from [N ].

If the rule ri for the node i is of the form a→ b c,
we define random variables as follows:
• R1 is equal to the rule ri (e.g., NP→ D N).
• T1 is the inside tree rooted at node i. T2 is the

inside tree rooted at the left child of node i, and T3
is the inside tree rooted at the right child of node i.
• H1,H2,H3 are the hidden variables associated

with node i, the left child of node i, and the right
child of node i respectively.

226



• A1, A2, A3 are the labels for node i, the left
child of node i, and the right child of node i respec-
tively. (E.g., A1 = NP, A2 = D, A3 = N.)
• O is the outside tree at node i.
• B is equal to 1 if node i is at the root of the tree

(i.e., i = 1), 0 otherwise.
If the rule ri for the selected node i is of

the form a → x, we have random vari-
ables R1, T1,H1, A1, O,B as defined above, but
H2,H3, T2, T3, A2, and A3 are not defined.

We assume a function ψ that maps outside trees o
to feature vectors ψ(o) ∈ Rd′ . For example, the fea-
ture vector might track the rule directly above the
node in question, the word following the node in
question, and so on. We also assume a function φ
that maps inside trees t to feature vectors φ(t) ∈ Rd.
As one example, the function φ might be an indica-
tor function tracking the rule production at the root
of the inside tree. Later we give formal criteria for
what makes good definitions of ψ(o) of φ(t). One
requirement is that d′ ≥ m and d ≥ m.

In tandem with these definitions, we assume pro-
jection matices Ua ∈ R(d×m) and V a ∈ R(d′×m)
for all a ∈ N . We then define additional random
variables Y1, Y2, Y3, Z as

Y1 = (U
a1)⊤φ(T1) Z = (V

a1)⊤ψ(O)

Y2 = (U
a2)⊤φ(T2) Y3 = (U

a3)⊤φ(T3)

where ai is the value of the random variable Ai.
Note that Y1, Y2, Y3, Z are all in Rm.

6.2 Observable Representations

Given the definitions in the previous section, our
representation is based on the following matrix, ten-
sor and vector quantities, defined for all a ∈ N , for
all rules of the form a→ b c, and for all rules of the
form a→ x respectively:

Σa = E[Y1Z
⊤|A1 = a]

Da→b c = E
[

[[R1 = a→ b c]]Y3Z⊤Y ⊤2 |A1 = a
]

d∞a→x = E
[

[[R1 = a→ x]]Z⊤|A1 = a
]

Assuming access to functions φ and ψ, and projec-
tion matrices Ua and V a, these quantities can be es-
timated directly from training data consisting of a
set of s-trees (see section 7).

Our observable representation then consists of:

Ca→b c(y) = Da→b c(y)(Σa)−1 (2)

c∞a→x = d
∞
a→x(Σ

a)−1 (3)

c1a = E [[[A1 = a]]Y1|B = 1] (4)

We next introduce conditions under which these
quantities satisfy the conditions in theorem 1.

The following definition will be important:

Definition 2 For all a ∈ N , we define the matrices
Ia ∈ R(d×m) and Ja ∈ R(d′×m) as

[Ia]i,h = E[φi(T1) | H1 = h,A1 = a]

[Ja]i,h = E[ψi(O) | H1 = h,A1 = a]
In addition, for any a ∈ N , we use γa ∈ Rm to
denote the vector with γah = P (H1 = h|A1 = a).

The correctness of the representation will rely on
the following conditions being satisfied (these are
parallel to conditions 1 and 2 in Hsu et al. (2009)):

Condition 1 ∀a ∈ N , the matrices Ia and Ja are
of full rank (i.e., they have rank m). For all a ∈ N ,
for all h ∈ [m], γah > 0.
Condition 2 ∀a ∈ N , the matrices Ua ∈ R(d×m)
and V a ∈ R(d′×m) are such that the matrices Ga =
(Ua)⊤Ia and Ka = (V a)⊤Ja are invertible.

The following lemma justifies the use of an SVD
calculation as one method for finding values for Ua

and V a that satisfy condition 2:

Lemma 1 Assume that condition 1 holds, and for
all a ∈ N define

Ωa = E[φ(T1) (ψ(O))
⊤ |A1 = a] (5)

Then if Ua is a matrix of the m left singular vec-
tors of Ωa corresponding to non-zero singular val-
ues, and V a is a matrix of the m right singular vec-
tors of Ωa corresponding to non-zero singular val-
ues, then condition 2 is satisfied.

Proof sketch: It can be shown that Ωa =
Iadiag(γa)(Ja)⊤. The remainder is similar to the
proof of lemma 2 in Hsu et al. (2009).

The matrices Ωa can be estimated directly from a
training set consisting of s-trees, assuming that we
have access to the functions φ and ψ.

We can now state the following theorem:

227



Theorem 2 Assume conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied.
For all a ∈ N , define Ga = (Ua)⊤Ia. Then under
the definitions in Eqs. 2-4:

1. For all rules a→ b c, Ca→b c(y) =
GcT a→b cdiag(yGbSa→b c)Qa→b c(Ga)−1

2. For all rules a→ x, c∞a→x = 1⊤Qa→x(Ga)−1.

3. For all a ∈ N , c1a = Gaπa

Proof: The following identities hold (see sec-
tion 9.2):

Da→b c(y) = (6)

GcT a→b cdiag(yGbSa→b c)Qa→b cdiag(γa)(Ka)⊤

d∞a→x = 1
⊤Qa→xdiag(γa)(Ka)⊤ (7)

Σa = Gadiag(γa)(Ka)⊤ (8)

c1a = G
aπa (9)

Under conditions 1 and 2, Σa is invertible, and
(Σa)−1 = ((Ka)⊤)−1(diag(γa))−1(Ga)−1. The
identities in the theorem follow immediately.

7 Deriving Empirical Estimates
Figure 4 shows an algorithm that derives esti-
mates of the quantities in Eqs 2, 3, and 4. As
input, the algorithm takes a sequence of tuples
(r(i,1), t(i,1), t(i,2), t(i,3), o(i), b(i)) for i ∈ [M ].

These tuples can be derived from a training set
consisting of s-trees τ1 . . . τM as follows:
• ∀i ∈ [M ], choose a single node ji uniformly at

random from the nodes in τi. Define r(i,1) to be the
rule at node ji. t(i,1) is the inside tree rooted at node
ji. If r(i,1) is of the form a→ b c, then t(i,2) is the
inside tree under the left child of node ji, and t(i,3)

is the inside tree under the right child of node ji. If
r(i,1) is of the form a → x, then t(i,2) = t(i,3) =
NULL. o(i) is the outside tree at node ji. b(i) is 1 if
node ji is at the root of the tree, 0 otherwise.

Under this process, assuming that the s-trees
τ1 . . . τM are i.i.d. draws from the distribution
p(τ) over s-trees under an L-PCFG, the tuples
(r(i,1), t(i,1), t(i,2), t(i,3), o(i), b(i)) are i.i.d. draws
from the joint distribution over the random variables
R1, T1, T2, T3, O,B defined in the previous section.

The algorithm first computes estimates of the pro-
jection matrices Ua and V a: following lemma 1,
this is done by first deriving estimates of Ωa,
and then taking SVDs of each Ωa. The matrices
are then used to project inside and outside trees

t(i,1), t(i,2), t(i,3), o(i) down to m-dimensional vec-
tors y(i,1), y(i,2), y(i,3), z(i); these vectors are used to
derive the estimates of Ca→b c, c∞a→x, and c

1
a.

We now state a PAC-style theorem for the learning
algorithm. First, for a given L-PCFG, we need a
couple of definitions:
• Λ is the minimum absolute value of any element

The condition that Ûa and V̂ a are derived from
Ωa, as opposed to the sample estimate Ω̂a, follows
Foster et al. (2012). As these authors note, similar
techniques to those of Hsu et al. (2009) should be

228



applicable in deriving results for the case where Ω̂a

is used in place of Ωa.
Proof sketch: The proof is similar to that of Foster

et al. (2012). The basic idea is to first show that
under the assumptions of the theorem, the estimates
ĉ1a, d̂

∞
a→x, D̂

a→b c, Σ̂a are all close to the underlying
values being estimated. The second step is to show
that this ensures that p̂(r1...rN′ )

p(r1...rN′ )
is close to 1.

The method described of selecting a single tuple
(r(i,1), t(i,1), t(i,2), t(i,3), o(i), b(i)) for each s-tree en-
sures that the samples are i.i.d., and simplifies the
analysis underlying theorem 3. In practice, an im-
plementation should most likely use all nodes in all
trees in training data; by Rao-Blackwellization we
know such an algorithm would be better than the
one presented, but the analysis of how much better
would be challenging. It would almost certainly lead
to a faster rate of convergence of p̂ to p.

8 Discussion
There are several potential applications of the
method. The most obvious is parsing with L-
PCFGs.1 The approach should be applicable in other
cases where EM has traditionally been used, for ex-
ample in semi-supervised learning. Latent-variable
HMMs for sequence labeling can be derived as spe-
cial case of our approach, by converting tagged se-
quences to right-branching skeletal trees.

The sample complexity of the method depends on
the minimum singular values of Ωa; these singular
values are a measure of how well correlated ψ and
φ are with the unobserved hidden variable H1. Ex-
perimental work is required to find a good choice of
values for ψ and φ for parsing.

9 Proofs
This section gives proofs of theorems 1 and 2. Due
to space limitations we cannot give full proofs; in-
stead we provide proofs of some key lemmas. A
long version of this paper will give the full proofs.

9.1 Proof of Theorem 1

First, the following lemma leads directly to the cor-
rectness of the algorithm in figure 2:

1Parameters can be estimated using the algorithm in
figure 4; for a test sentence x1 . . . xN we can first
use the algorithm in figure 3 to calculate marginals
µ(a, i, j), then use the algorithm of Goodman (1996) to find
arg maxτ∈T (x)

∑
(a,i,j)∈τ µ(a, i, j).

Inputs: Training examples (r(i,1), t(i,1), t(i,2), t(i,3), o(i), b(i))
for i ∈ {1 . . .M}, where r(i,1) is a context free rule; t(i,1),
t(i,2) and t(i,3) are inside trees; o(i) is an outside tree; and
b(i) = 1 if the rule is at the root of tree, 0 otherwise. A function
φ that maps inside trees t to feature-vectors φ(t) ∈ Rd. A func-

tion ψ that maps outside trees o to feature-vectors ψ(o) ∈ Rd
′

.
Algorithm:
Define ai to be the non-terminal on the left-hand side of rule
r(i,1). If r(i,1) is of the form a→ b c, define bi to be the non-
terminal for the left-child of r(i,1), and ci to be the non-terminal
for the right-child.

(Step 1: Projection)

(Ûci)⊤φ(t(i,3)).

• For all i ∈ [M ], compute z(i) = (V̂ ai)⊤ψ(o(i)).

Lemma 2 Assume that conditions 1-3 of theorem 1
are satisfied, and that the input to the algorithm in
figure 2 is an s-tree r1 . . . rN . Define ai for i ∈ [N ]
to be the non-terminal on the left-hand-side of rule
ri, and ti for i ∈ [N ] to be the s-tree with rule ri
at its root. Finally, for all i ∈ [N ], define the row
vector bi ∈ R(1×m) to have components

bih = P (Ti = ti|Hi = h,Ai = ai)

for h ∈ [m]. Then for all i ∈ [N ], f i = bi(G(ai))−1.
It follows immediately that

f1c1a1 = b
1(G(a1))−1Ga1πa1 = p(r1 . . . rN )

This lemma shows a direct link between the vec-
tors f i calculated in the algorithm, and the terms bih,
which are terms calculated by the conventional in-
side algorithm: each f i is a linear transformation
(through Gai) of the corresponding vector bi.
Proof: The proof is by induction.

First consider the base case. For any leaf—i.e., for
any i such that ai ∈ P—we have bih = q(ri|h, ai),
and it is easily verified that f i = bi(G(ai))−1.

The inductive case is as follows. For all i ∈ [N ]
such that ai ∈ I , by the definition in the algorithm,

f i = fγCri(fβ)

= fγGaγT ridiag(fβGaβSri)Qri(Gai)−1

Assuming by induction that fγ = bγ(G(aγ ))−1 and
fβ = bβ(G(aβ))−1, this simplifies to

f i = κrdiag(κl)Qri(Gai)−1 (10)

where κr = bγT ri , and κl = bβSri . κr is a row
vector with components κrh =

∑

h′∈[m] b

h′,h =

h′,h =

h′∈[m] b

κrdiag(κl)Qri is a row vector with components

hq(ri|h, ai).

But bih = q(ri|h, ai)×

(

= q(ri|h, ai)κrhκlh, hence
κrdiag(κl)Qri = bi and the inductive case follows
immediately from Eq. 10.

Next, we give a similar lemma, which implies the
correctness of the algorithm in figure 3:

Lemma 3 Assume that conditions 1-3 of theorem 1
are satisfied, and that the input to the algorithm in
figure 3 is a sentence x1 . . . xN . For any a ∈ N , for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N , define ᾱa,i,j ∈ R(1×m) to have
components ᾱa,i,jh = p(xi . . . xj|h, a) for h ∈ [m].
In addition, define β̄a,i,j ∈ R(m×1) to have compo-
nents β̄a,i,jh = p(x1 . . . xi−1, a(h), xj+1 . . . xN ) for
h ∈ [m]. Then for all i ∈ [N ], αa,i,j = ᾱa,i,j(Ga)−1
and βa,i,j = Gaβ̄a,i,j . It follows that for all (a, i, j),

µ(a, i, j) = ᾱa,i,j(Ga)−1Gaβ̄a,i,j = ᾱa,i,j β̄a,i,j

=
∑

h

ᾱa,i,jh β̄
a,i,j
h =

∑

τ∈T (x):(a,i,j)∈τ

p(τ)

Thus the vectors αa,i,j and βa,i,j are linearly re-
lated to the vectors ᾱa,i,j and β̄a,i,j , which are the
inside and outside terms calculated by the conven-
tional form of the inside-outside algorithm.

The proof is by induction, and is similar to the
proof of lemma 2; for reasons of space it is omitted.

9.2 Proof of the Identity in Eq. 6

We now prove the identity in Eq. 6, used in the proof
of theorem 2. For reasons of space, we do not give
the proofs of identities 7-9: the proofs are similar.

The following identities can be verified:

P (R1 = a→ b c|H1 = h,A1 = a) = q(a→ b c|h, a)
E [Y3,j|H1 = h,R1 = a→ b c] = Ea→b cj,h
E [Zk|H1 = h,R1 = a→ b c] = Kak,h
E [Y2,l|H1 = h,R1 = a→ b c] = F a→b cl,h

where Ea→b c = GcT a→b c, F a→b c = GbSa→b c.
Y3, Z and Y2 are independent when conditioned

on H1, R1 (this follows from the independence as-
sumptions in the L-PCFG), hence

E [[[R1 = a→ b c]]Y3,jZkY2,l | H1 = h,A1 = a]
= q(a→ b c|h, a)Ea→b cj,h Kak,hF a→b cl,h
Hence (recall that γah = P (H1 = h|A1 = a)),

Da→b cj,k,l = E [[[R1 = a→ b c]]Y3,jZkY2,l | A1 = a]
=

∑

h

γahE [[[R1 = a→ b c]]Y3,jZkY2,l | H1 = h,A1 = a]

=
∑

h

γahq(a→ b c|h, a)Ea→b cj,h Kak,hF a→b cl,h (11)

from which Eq. 6 follows.
