Abstract

Supervised methods have been the domi-
nant approach for Chinese word segmen-
tation. The performance can drop signif-
icantly when the test domain is different
from the training domain. In this paper,
we study the problem of obtaining par-
tial annotation from freely available data
to help Chinese word segmentation on dif-
ferent domains. Different sources of free
annotations are transformed into a unified
form of partial annotation and a variant
CRF model is used to leverage both fully
and partially annotated data consistently.
Experimental results show that the Chi-
nese word segmentation model benefits
from free partially annotated data. On the
SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010 data, we achieve
results that are competitive to the best re-
ported in the literature.

1 Introduction

Statistical Chinese word segmentation gains high
accuracies on newswire (Xue and Shen, 2003;
Zhang and Clark, 2007; Jiang et al., 2009; Zhao
et al., 2010; Sun and Xu, 2011). However, man-
ually annotated training data mostly come from
the news domain, and the performance can drop
severely when the test data shift from newswire
to blogs, computer forums and Internet literature
(Liu and Zhang, 2012).

Several methods have been proposed for solv-
ing the domain adaptation problem for segmenta-
tion, which include the traditional token- and type-
supervised methods (Song et al., 2012; Zhang et
al., 2014). While token-supervised methods rely
on manually annotated target-domain sentences,
type-supervised methods leverage manually as-
sembled domain-specific lexicons to improve
target-domain segmentation accuracies. Both

Figure 1: The segmentation problem, illustrated
using the sentence “浦东 (Pudong) 开发 (devel-
opment) 与 (and) 法制 (legal) 建设 (construc-
tion)”. Possible segmentation labels are drawn un-
der each character, where b, m, e, s stand for the
beginning, middle, end of a multi-character word,
and a single character word, respectively. The path
shows the correct segmentation by choosing one
label for each character.

methods are competitive given the same amount of
annotation effects (Garrette and Baldridge, 2012;
Zhang et al., 2014). However, obtaining manually
annotated data can be expensive.

On the other hand, there are free data which
contain limited but useful segmentation informa-
tion over the Internet, including large-scale un-
labeled data, domain-specific lexicons and semi-
annotated web pages such as Wikipedia. In the
last case, word-boundary information is contained
in hyperlinks and other markup annotations. Such
free data offer a useful alternative for improving
the segmentation performance, especially on do-
mains that are not identical to newswire, and for
which little annotation is available.

In this paper, we investigate techniques for
adopting freely available data to help improve the
performance on Chinese word segmentation. We
propose a simple but robust method for construct-
ing partial segmentation from different sources
of free data, including unlabeled data and the
Wikipedia. There has been work on making use
of both unlabeled data (Sun and Xu, 2011; Wang
et al., 2011) and Wikipedia (Jiang et al., 2013)

to improve segmentation. However, no empiri-
cal results have been reported on a unified ap-
proach to deal with different types of free data.
We use a conditional random fields (Lafferty et al.,
2001; Tsuboi et al., 2008) variant that can lever-
age the partial annotations obtained from different
sources of free annotation. Training is achieved by
a modification to the learning objective, incorpo-
rating partial annotation likelihood, so that a single
model can be trained consistently with a mixture
of full and partial annotation.

Experimental results show that our method of
using partially annotated data can consistently im-
proves cross-domain segmentation performance.
We obtain results which are competitive to the
best reported in the literature. Our segmentor
is freely released at https://github.com/
ExpResults/partial-crfsuite.

2 Obtaining Partially Annotated Data

We model the Chinese word segmentation task as
a character sequence tagging problem, which is to
give each character in a sentence a word-boundary
tag (Xue and Shen, 2003). We adopt four tags, b,
m, e and s, which represent the beginning, middle,
end of a multi-character word, and a single char-
acter word, respectively. A manually segmented
sentence can be represented as a tag sequence, as
shown in Figure 1.

We investigate two major sources of freely-
available annotations: lexicons and natural anno-
tation, both with the help of unannotated data.
To make use of the first source of informa-
tion, we incorporate words from a lexicon into
unannotated sentences by matching of character
sequences, resulting in partially annotated sen-
tences, as shown in Figure 2a. In this example,
the word “狐岐山 (the Huqi Mountain)” in the
unannotated sentence matches an item in the lex-
icon. As a result, we obtain a partially-annotated
sentence, in which the segmentation ambiguity of
the characters “狐 (fox)”, “岐 (brandy road)” and
“山 (mountain)” are resolved (“狐” being the be-
ginning, “岐” being the middle and “山” being the
end of the same word). At the same time, the seg-
mentation ambiguity of the surrounding characters
“在 (at)” and “救 (save)” are reduced (“在” be-
ing either a single-character word or the end of
a multi-character word, and “救” being either a
single-character word or the beginning of a multi-
character word).

where “乳铁蛋白” is a hyperlink.

Figure 2: Examples of partially annotated data.
The paths show possible correct segmentations.

Natural annotation, which refers to word
boundaries that can be inferred from URLs, fonts
or colors on web pages, also result in partially-
annotated sentences. Taking a web page shown
in Figure 2b for example. It can be inferred from
the URL tags on “乳铁蛋白” that “乳” should be
either the beginning of a multi-character word or
a single-character word, and “白” should be either
the end a multi-character word or single-character
word. Similarly, possible tags of the surrounding
character “如” and “、” can also be inferred.

We turn both lexicons and natural annotation
into the same form of partial annotation with
same unresolved ambiguities, as shown in Figure
2, and use them together with available full anno-
tation (Figure 1) as the training data for the seg-
mentor. In this section, we describe in detail how
to obtain partially annotated sentences from each
resource, respectively.

2.1 Lexicons

In this scenario, we assume that there are unla-
beled sentences along with a lexicon for the target
domain. We obtain partially segmented sentences
by extracting word boundaries from the unlabeled
sentences with the help of the lexicon. Previous
matching methods (Wu and Tseng, 1993; Wong
and Chan, 1996) for Chinese word segmentation
largely rely on the lexicons, and are generally con-
sidered being weak in ambiguity resolution (Gao

et al., 2005). But for obtaining the partial labeled
data with lexicon, the matching method can still be
a solution. Since we do not aim to recognize every
word from sentence, we can select a lexicon with
smaller coverage but less ambiguity to achieve rel-
atively precise matching result.

In this paper, we apply two matching schemes
to the same raw sentences to obtain partially an-
notated sentences. The first is a simple forward-
maximum matching (FMM) scheme, which is
very close to the forward maximum matching al-
gorithm of Wu and Tseng (1993) for Chinese word
segmentation. This scheme scans the input sen-
tence from left to right. At each position, it at-
tempts to find the longest subsequence of Chi-
nese characters that matches a lexicon entry. If
such an entry is found, the subsequence is tagged
with the corresponding tags, and its surrounding
characters are also constrained to a smaller set of
tags. If no subsequence is found in the lexicon, the
character is left with all the possible tags. Taking
the sentence in Figure 2a for example. When the
algorithm scans the second character, “狐”, and
finds the entry “狐岐山” in the lexicon, the sub-
sequence of characters is recognized as a word,
and tagged with b, m and e, respectively. At the
same time, the previous character “在” can be in-
ferred as only end of a multi-character word (e) or
a single-character word (s). The second matching
scheme is backward maximum matching, which
can be treated as the application of FMM on the
reverse of unlabeled sentences using a lexicon of
reversed words.

To mitigate the errors resulting from one single
matching scheme, we combine the two matching
results by agreement. The basic idea is that if a
subsequence of sentence is recognized as word by

multiple matching results, it can be considered as a
more precise annotation. Our algorithm reads par-
tial segmentation by different methods and selects
the subsequences that are identified as word by all
methods as annotated words.

2.2 Natural Annotation

We use the Chinese Wikipedia for natural anno-
tation. Partially annotated sentences are readily
formed in Wikipedia by markup syntax, such as
URLs. However, some subtle issues exist if the
sentences are used directly. One problem is in-
compatibility of segmentation standards between
the annotated training data and Wikipedia. Jiang
et al. (2009) discuss this incompatibility problem
between two corpora — the CTB and the Peo-
ple’s Daily; the problem is even more severe on
Wikipedia because it can be edited by any user.
Table 1a shows a case of incompatible annota-
tion between the People’s Daily data and natural
annotation in Wikipedia, where the three charac-
ters “旅游业” are segmented differently. Both can
be treated as correct, although they have different
segmentation granularities.

Another problem is the intrinsic ambiguity of
segmentation. The same character sequence can
be segmented into different words under differ-
ent contexts. If the training and test data contain
different contexts, the learned model can give in-
correct results on the test data. This is particu-
larly true across different domains. Table 1b gives
such an example, where the character sequence
“字段” is segmented differently in two of our test
domains, but both cases exist in Wikipedia.

In summary, Wikipedia introduces both use-
ful information for domain adaptation and harm-
ful noise with negative effects on the model. To

866



achieve better performance of domain adaptation
using Wikipedia, one intuitive approach is to se-
lect more domain-related data and less irrelevant
data to minimize the risks that result from incom-
patible annotation and domain difference.

To this end, we assume that there are some raw
sentences on the target domain, which can be used
to evaluate the relevance between Wikipedia and
target domain test data. We assume that URL-
tagged entries reflect the segmentation standards
of Wikipedia sentence, and use them to match
Wikipedia sentences with the raw target domain
data. If the character sequence of any URL-tagged
entry in a Wikipedia sentence matches the target
domain data, the Wikipedia sentence is selected
for training. Another advantage of such data se-
lection is that the training time consumption can
be reduced by reducing the size of training data.

3 CRF for Word Segmentation

We follow the work of Zhao et al. (2010) and Sun
and Xu (2011), and adopt the Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001) for the
sequence labeling problem of word segmentation.
Given an input characters sequence, the task is to
assign one segmentation label from {b,m, e, s} on
each character. Let x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ) be the
sequence of characters in sentence whose length
is T , and y = (y1, y2, ..., yT ) be the correspond-
ing label sequence, where yi ∈ Y . The linear-
chain conditional random field for Chinese word
segmentation can be formalized as

p(y|x) = 1
Z

exp
T∑

t=1

∑
k

λkfk(yt, yt−1,x) (1)

where λk are the model parameters, fk are the fea-
ture functions and Z is the probability normalizer.

Z =
∑
y

exp
T∑

t=1

∑
k

λkfk(yt, yt−1,x) (2)

We follow Sun and Xu (2011) and use the fea-
ture templates shown in Table 2 to model the seg-
mented task. For ith character in the sentence, the
n-gram features represent the surrounding charac-
ters of this character; Type categorizes the charac-
ter it into digit, punctuation, english and other;
Identical indicates whether the input character is
the same with its surrounding characters. This
feature captures repetition patterns such as “试
试 (try)” or “走走 (stroll)”.

Type Template

s < i)

Table 2: Feature templates for the ith character.

For fully-annotated training data, the learning
problem of conditional random fields is to maxi-
mize the log likelihood over all the training data
(Lafferty et al., 2001)

L =
N∑

n=1

log p(y(n)|x(n))

Here N is the number of training sentences. Both
the likelihood p(y(n)|x(n)) and its gradient can be
calculated by performing the forward-backward
algorithm (Baum and Petrie, 1966) on the se-
quence, and several optimization algorithm can be
adopted to learn parameters from data, including
L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) and SGD (Bot-
tou, 1991).

4 Training a CRF with partially
annotated data

For word segmentation with partially annotated
data, some characters in a sentence can have
a definite segmentation label, while some can
have multiple labels with ambiguities remain-
ing. Taking the partially annotated sentence
in Figure 2a for example, the corresponding
potential label sequence for “在狐岐山救” is
{(e, s), (b), (m), (e), (b, s)}, where the characters
“狐”, “岐” and “山” have fixed labels but for “在”
and “救”, some ambiguities exist. Note that the
full annotation in Figure 1 can be regarded as a
special case of partial annotation, where the num-
ber of potential labels for each character is one.

We follow Tsuboi et al. (2008) and model
marginal probabilities over partially annotated
data. Define the possible labels that correspond
to the partial annotation as L = (L1, L2, ..., LT ),
where each Li is a non-empty subset of Y that cor-
responds to the set of possible labels for xi. Let

867



YL be the set of all possible label sequences where
∀y ∈ YL, yi ∈ Li. The marginal probability of
YL can be modeled as

p(YL|x) = 1
Z

∑
y∈YL

exp

T∑

∑

Defining the unnormalized marginal probability as

ZYL =
∑

y∈YL
exp

T∑
t=1

∑
k

λkfk(yt, yt−1,x),

and the normalizer Z being the same as Equation
2, the log marginal probability of YL over N par-
tially annotated training examples can be formal-
ized as

LYL =
N∑

n=1

log p(YL|x) =
N∑

n=1

(log ZYL − log Z)

The gradient of the likelihood can be written as

Both ZYL and its gradient are similar in form to
Z. By introducing a modification to the forward-
backward algorithm, ZYL and LYL can be calcu-
lated. Define the forward variable for partially an-
notated data αYL,t(j) = pYL(x⟨1,...,t⟩, yt = j). A
modification on the forward algorithm can be for-
malized as

αYL,t(j) =

{
0 j /∈ Lt∑

i∈Lt−1 Ψt(j, i, xt)αYL,t−1(i) j ∈ Lt

where Ψt(j, i, x) is a potential function that equals∑
k λkfk(yt = j, yt−1 = i, xt). Similarly, for the

backward variable βYL,t,

βYL,t(i) =

{
0 i /∈ Lt∑

j∈Lt+1 Ψt(j, i, xt+1)βYL,t+1(j) i ∈ Lt

ZYL can be calculated by αYL(T ),
and pYL(y, y

′|x) can be calculated by
αYL,t−1(y

′)Ψt(y, y′, xt)βYL,t(y).
Note that if each element in YL is constrained

to one single label, the CRF model in Equation 3

degrades into Equation 1. So we can train a unified
model with both fully and partially annotated data.
We implement this CRF model based on a open
source toolkit CRFSuite.1 In our experiments, we
use the L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) algo-
rithm to learn parameters from both fully and par-
tially annotated data.

5 Experiments

We perform our experiments on the domain adap-
tation test data from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010 (Zhao
et al., 2010), adapting annotated training sentences
from People’s Daily (PD) (Yu et al., 2001) to
different test domains. The fully annotated data
is selected from the People’s Daily newspaper
in January of 1998, and the four test domains
from the SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010 include finance,
medicine, literature and computer. Sample seg-
mented data in the computer domain from this
bakeoff is used as development set. Statistics of
the data are shown in first half of Table 3. We
use wikidump201404192 for the Wikipedia data.
All the traditional Chinese pages in Wikipedia are
converted to simplified Chinese. After filtering
functional pages like redirection and removing du-
plication, 5.45 million sentences are reserved.

For comparison with related work on using a
lexicon to improve segmentation, another set of
test data is chosen for this setting. We use the Chi-
nese Treebank (CTB) as the source domain data,
and Zhuxian (a free Internet novel, also named as
“Jade dynasty”, referred to as ZX henceforth) as
the target domain data.3 The ZX data are written
in a different style from newswire, and contains
many out-of-vocabulary words. This setting has
been used by Liu and Zhang (2012) and Zhang et
al. (2014) for domain adaptation of segmentation
and POS-tagging. We use the standard training,
development and test split. Statistics of the test
data annotated by Zhang et al. (2014) are shown
in the second half of Table 3.

The data preparation method in Section 2 and
the CRF method in Section 4 are used for all
the experiments. Both recall of out-of-vocabulary
words (Roov) and F-score are used to evaluate the

segmentation performance. There is a mixture of
Chinese characters, English words and numeric
expression in the test data from SIGHAN Bakeoff
2010. To test the influence of Wikipedia data on
Chinese word segmentation alone, we apply reg-
ular expressions to detect English words and nu-
meric expressions, so that they are marked as not
segmented. After performing this preprocessing
step, cleaned test input data are fed to the CRF
model to give a relatively strong baseline.

5.1 Free Lexicons

5.1.1 Obtaining lexicons
For domain adaption from CTB to ZX, we use
a lexicon released by Zhang et al. (2014). The
lexicon is crawled from a online encyclopedia4,
and contains the names of 159 characters and ar-
tifacts in the Zhuxian novel. We follow Zhang et
al. (2014) and name it NR for convenience of fur-
ther discussion. The NR lexicon can be treated
as a strongly domain-related, high quality but rel-
atively small lexicon. It’s a typical example of
freely available lexicon over the Internet.

For domain adaptation from PD to medicine and
computer, we collect a list of page titles under
the corresponding categories in Wikipedia. For
medicine, entries under essential medicines, bi-
ological system and diseases are collected. For
computer, entries under computer network, Mi-
crosoft Windows and software widgets are se-
lected. These lexicons are typical freely available
lexicons that we can access to.

5.1.2 Obtaining Unlabeled Sentences
For ZX, partially annotated sentences are obtained
using the NR lexicon and unlabeled ZX sentences
by applying the matching scheme described in

Section 2. The CTB5 training data and the par-
tially annotated data are mixed as the final train-
ing data. Different amounts of unlabeled data are
applied to the development test set, and results are
shown in Figure 3. From this figure we can see
that incorporating 16K sentences gives the high-
est accuracy, and adding more partial labeled data
does not change the accuracy significantly. So for
the ZX experiments, we choose the 16K sentences
as the unlabeled data.

For the medicine and computer experiments, we
selected domain-specific sentences by matching
with the domain-specific lexicons. About 46K out
of the 5.45 million wiki sentences contain subse-
quences in the medicine lexicon and 22K in the
case of the computer domain. We randomly se-
lect 16K sentences as the unlabeled data for each
domain, respectively.

5.1.3 Final results

We incorporate the partially annotated data ob-
tained with the help of lexicon for each of the
test domain. For adaptation from CTB to ZX, we
trained our baseline model on the CTB5 training
data with the feature templates in Table 2. For
adaptation from PD to medicine and computer, we

trained our baseline model on the PD training data
with the same feature template setting.

Previous research makes use of a lexicon by
adding lexicon features directly into a model (Sun
and Xu, 2011; Zhang et al., 2014), rather than
transforming them into partially annotated sen-
tences. To make a comparison, we follow Sun and
Xu (2011) and add three lexicon features to repre-
sent whether ci is located at the beginning, middle
or the end of a word in the lexicon, respectively.
For each test domain, the lexicon for the lexi-
con feature model consists of the most frequent
words in the source domain training data (about
6.7K for CTB5 and 8K for PD, respectively) and
the domain-specific lexicon we obtained in Sec-
tion 5.1.1.

The results are shown in Table 4, where the first
row shows the performance of the baseline mod-
els and the second row shows the performance
of the model incorporating lexicon feature. The
third row shows our method using partial anno-
tation. On the ZX test set, our method outper-
forms the baseline by more than 3 absolute per-
centage. The model with partially annotated data
performs better than the one with additional lexi-
con features. Similar conclusion is obtained when
adapting from PD to medicine and computer. By
incorporating the partially annotated data, the seg-
mentation of lexicon words, along with the con-
text, is learned.

We also compare our method with the work of
Zhang et al. (2014), who reported results only on
the ZX test data. We use the same lexicon settings.
Our method gives better result than Zhang et al.
(2014), showing that the combination of a lexicon
and unannotated sentence into partially annotated
data can lead to better performance than using a
dictionary alone in type-supervision. Given that
we only explore the use of free resource, combin-
ing a lexicon with unannotated sentences is a bet-
ter option than using the lexicon directly. Zhang
et al.’s concern, on the other hand, is to compare

type- and token-annotation. Our partial annota-
tion can thus be treated as a compromise to obtain
some pseudo partial token-annotations when full
token annotations are unavailable. Another thing
to note is that the model of Zhang et al. (2014) is
a joint model for segmentation and POS-tagging,
which is generally considered stronger than a sin-
gle segmentation model.

5.2 Free Natural Annotation

When extracting word boundaries from Wikipedia
sentences, we ignore natural annotations on En-
glish words and digits because these words are rec-
ognized by the preprocessor. Following Jiang et
al. (2013), we also recognize a naturally annotated
two-character subsequence as a word.

5.2.1 Effect of data selection
To make better use of more domain-specific data,
and to alleviate noise in partial annotation, we ap-
ply the selection method proposed in Section 2
to the Wikipedia data. On the computer domain
development test data, this selection method re-
sults in 9.4K computer-related sentences with par-
tial annotation. A model is trained with both the
PD training data and the partially annotated com-
puter domain Wikipedia data. For comparison, we
also trained a model with 160K randomly selected
Wikipedia sentences. The experimental result is
shown in Table 5. The model incorporating se-
lected data achieves better performance compared
to the model with randomly sampled data, demon-
strating that data selection is helpful to improving

the domain adaption accuracy.

5.2.2 Final Result
The final results on the four test domains are
shown in Table 6. From this table, we can see
that significant improvements are achieved with
the help of the partially annotated Wikipedia data,
when compared to the baseline. The models
trained with selected partial annotation perform
better than those trained with random partial an-
notation. Our F-scores are competitive to those re-
ported by Jiang et al. (2013). However, since their
model is trained on a different source domain, the
results are not directly comparable.

5.2.3 Analysis
In this section, we study the effect of Wikipedia on
domain adaptation when no data selection is per-
formed, in order to analyze the effect of partially
annotated data. We randomly sample 10K, 20K,
40K, 80K and 160K sentences from the 5.45 mil-
lion Wikipedia sentences, and incorporate them
into the training process, respectively. Five models
are obtained adding the baseline, and we test their
performances on the four test domains. Figure 4
shows the results.

From the figure we can see that for the medicine
and computer domains, where the OOV rate is rel-
atively high, the F-score generally increases when
more data from Wikipedia are used. The trends
of F-score and OOV recall against the volume of
Wikipedia data are almost identical. However, for
the finance and literature domains, which have low
OOV rates, such a relation between data size and
accuracy is not witnessed. For the literature do-
main, even an opposite trends is shown.

We can draw the following conclusions: (1)
Natural annotation on Wikipedia data contributes
to the recognition of OOV words on domain adap-
tation; (2) target domains with more OOV words
benefit more from Wikipedia data. (3) along with

the positive effect on OOV recognition, Wikipedia
data can also introduce noise, and hence data se-
lection can be useful.

5.3 Combining Lexicon and Natural
Annotation

To make the most use of free annotation, we com-
bine available free lexicon and natural annotation
resources by joining the partially annotated sen-
tences derived using each resource, training our
CRF model with these partially annotated sen-
tences and the fully annotated PD sentences. The
tests are performed on medicine and computer do-
mains. Table 7 shows the results, where further
improvements are made on both domains when the
two types of resources are combined.

6 Related Work

There has been a line of research on making use of
unlabeled data for word segmentation. Zhao and
Kit (2008) improve segmentation performance by
mutual information between characters, collected
from large unlabeled data; Li and Sun (2009) use
punctuation information in a large raw corpus to
learn a segmentation model, and achieve better
recognition of OOV words; Sun and Xu (2011) ex-
plore several statistical features derived from un-
labeled data to help improve character-based word
segmentation. These investigations mainly focus
on in-domain accuracies. Liu and Zhang (2012)

study domain adaptation using an unsupervised
self-training method. In contrast to their work,
we make use of not only unlabeled data, but also
leverage any free annotation to achieve better re-
sults for domain adaptation.

There has also been work on making use of a
dictionary and natural annotation for segmenta-
tion. Zhang et al. (2014) study type-supervised do-
main adaptation for Chinese segmentation. They
categorize domain difference into two types: dif-
ferent vocabulary and different POS distributions.
While the first type of difference can be effec-
tively resolved by using lexicon for each domain,
the second type of difference needs to be resolved
by using annotated sentences. They found that
given the same manual annotation time, a com-
bination of the lexicon and sentence is the most
effective. Jiang et al. (2013) use 160K Wikipedia
sentences to improves segmentation accuracies on
several domains. Both Zhang et al. (2014) and
Jiang et al. (2013) work on discriminative mod-
els using the structure perceptron (Collins, 2002),
although they study two different sources of infor-
mation. In contrast to their work, we unify both
types of information under the CRF framework.

CRF has been used for Chinese word segmenta-
tion (Tseng, 2005; Shi and Wang, 2007; Zhao and
Kit, 2008; Wang et al., 2011). However, most pre-
vious work train a CRF by using full annotation
only. In contrast, we study CRF based segmenta-
tion by using both full and partial annotation.

Several other variants of CRF model has been
proposed in the machine learning literature, such
as the generalized expectation method (Mann and
McCallum, 2008), which introduce knowledge by
incorporating a manually annotated feature dis-
tribution into the regularizer, and the JESS-CM
(Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008), which use a EM-like
method to iteratively optimize the parameter on
both the annotated data and unlabeled data. In
contrast, we directly incorporate the likelihood of
partial annotation into the objective function. The
work that is the most similar to ours is Tsuboi et
al. (2008), who modify the CRF learning objec-
tive for partial data. They focus on Japanese lexi-
cal analysis using manually collected partial data,
while we investigate the effect of partial annota-
tion from freely available sources for Chinese seg-
mentation.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the problem of do-
main adaptation for word segmentation, by trans-
ferring various sources of free annotations into a
consistent form of partially annotated data and ap-
plying a variant of CRF that can be trained using
fully- and partially-annotated data simultaneously.
We performed a large set of experiments to study
the effectness of free data, finding that they are
useful for improving segmentation accuracy. Ex-
periments also show that proper data selection can
further benefit the model’s performance.
