Abstract

We present 5 systems of the Munich-
Edinburgh-Stuttgart1 joint submissions to
the 2013 SMT Shared Task: FR-EN, EN-
FR, RU-EN, DE-EN and EN-DE. The
first three systems employ inflectional gen-
eralization, while the latter two employ
parser-based reordering, and DE-EN per-
forms compound splitting. For our ex-
periments, we use standard phrase-based
Moses systems and operation sequence
models (OSM).

1 Introduction

Morphologically complex languages often lead to
data sparsity problems in statistical machine trans-
lation. For translation pairs with morphologically
rich source languages and English as target lan-
guage, we focus on simplifying the input language
in order to reduce the complexity of the translation
model. The pre-processing of the source-language
is language-specific, requiring morphological anal-
ysis (FR, RU) as well as sentence reordering (DE)
and dealing with compounds (DE). Due to time
constraints we did not deal with inflection for DE-
EN and EN-DE.

The morphological simplification process con-
sists in lemmatizing inflected word forms and deal-
ing with word formation (splitting portmanteau
prepositions or compounds). This needs to take
into account translation-relevant features (e.g. num-
ber) which vary across the different language pairs:
while French only has the features number and
gender, a wider array of features needs to be con-
sidered when modelling Russian (cf. table 6). In
addition to morphological reduction, we also apply
transliteration models learned from automatically

in collaboration with the Qatar Computing Research Institute
and the University of Szeged.

mined transliterations to handle out-of-vocabulary
words (OOVs) when translating from Russian.

Replacing inflected word forms with simpler
variants (lemmas or the components of split com-
pounds) aims not only at reducing the general com-
plexity of the translation model, but also at decreas-
ing the amount of out-of-vocabulary words in the
input data. This is particularly the case with Ger-
man compounds, which are very productive and
thus often lack coverage in the parallel training
data, whereas the individual components can be
translated. Similarly, inflected word forms (e.g. ad-
jectives) benefit from the reduction to lemmas if
the full inflection paradigm does not occur in the
parallel training data.

For EN-FR, a translation pair with a morpho-
logically complex target language, we describe a
two-step translation system built on non-inflected
word stems with a post-processing component for
predicting morphological features and the genera-
tion of inflected forms. In addition to the advantage
of a more general translation model, this method
also allows the generation of inflected word forms
which do not occur in the training data.

2 Experimental setup

The translation experiments in this paper are car-
ried out with either a standard phrase-based Moses
system (DE-EN, EN-DE, EN-FR and FR-EN) or
with an operation sequence model (RU-EN, DE-
EN), cf. Durrani et al. (2013b) for more details.
An operation sequence model (OSM) is a state-
of-the-art SMT-system that learns translation and
reordering patterns by representing a sentence pair
and its word alignment as a unique sequence of
operations (see e.g. Durrani et al. (2011), Durrani
et al. (2013a) for more details). For the Moses sys-
tems we used the old train-model perl scripts rather
than the EMS, so we did not perform Good-Turing
smoothing; parameter tuning was carried out with
batch-mira (Cherry and Foster, 2012).

The development data consists of the concate-
nated news-data sets from the years 2008-2011.
Unless otherwise stated, we use all constrained data
(parallel and monolingual). For the target-side lan-
guage models, we follow the approach of Schwenk
and Koehn (2008) and train a separate language
model for each corpus and then interpolate them
using weights optimized on development data.

3 French to English

French has a much richer morphology than English;
for example, adjectives in French are inflected with
respect to gender and number whereas adjectives
in English are not inflected at all. This causes data
sparsity in coverage of French inflected forms. We
try to overcome this problem by simplifying French
inflected forms in a pre-processing step in order to
adapt the French input better to the English output.

Processing of the training and test data The
pre-processing of the French input consists of two
steps: (1) normalizing not well-formed data (cf.
table 1) and (2) morphological simplification.

In the second step, the normalized training data
is annotated with Part-of-Speech tags (PoS-tags)
and word lemmas using RFTagger (Schmid and
Laws, 2008) which was trained on the French tree-
bank (Abeillé et al., 2003). French forms are then
simplified according to the rules given in table 2.

Data and experiments We trained a French to
English Moses system on the preprocessed and

simplified constrained parallel data.
Due to tractability problems with word align-

ment, the 109 French-English corpus and the UN
corpus were filtered to a more manageable size.
The filtering criteria are sentence length (between
15 and 25 words), as well as strings indicating that
a sentence is neither French nor English, or other-
wise not well-formed, aiming to obtain a subset of
good-quality sentences. In total, we use 9M par-
allel sentences. For the English language model
we use large training data with 287.3M true-cased
sentences (including the LDC Giga-word data).

We compare two systems: a baseline with reg-
ular French text, and a system with the described
morphological simplifications. Results for the
WMT-2012 test set are shown in table 3. Even
though the baseline is better than the simplified
system in terms of BLEU, we assume that the trans-
lation model of the simplified system benefits from
the overall generalization – thus, human annotators
might prefer the output of the simplified system.

For the WMT-2013 set, we obtain BLEU scores
of 29,97 (cs) and 31,05 (ci) with the system built
on simplified French (mes-simplifiedfrench).

4 English to French

Translating into a morphologically rich language
faces two problems: that of asymmetry of mor-
phological information contained in the source and
target language and that of data sparsity.

In this section we describe a two-step system de-
signed to overcome these types of problems: first,
the French data is reduced to non-inflected forms
(stems) with translation-relevant morphological fea-
tures, which is used to built the translation model.
The second step consists of predicting all neces-
sary morphological features for the translation out-
put, which are then used to generate fully inflected
forms. This two-step setup decreases the complex-
ity of the translation task by removing language-
specific features from the translation model. Fur-
thermore, generating inflected forms based on word
stems and morphological features allows to gener-

233



ate forms which do not occur in the parallel training
data – this is not possible in a standard SMT setup.

The idea of separating the translation into two
steps to deal with complex morphology was in-
troduced by Toutanova et al. (2008). Fraser et
al. (2012) applied this method to the language
pair English-German with an additional special
focus on word formation issues such as the split-
ting and merging of portmanteau prepositions and
compounds. The presented inflection prediction
systems focuses on nominal inflection; verbal in-
flection is not addressed.

Morphological analysis and resources The
morphological analysis of the French training data
is obtained using RFTagger, which is designed
for annotating fine-grained morphological tags
(Schmid and Laws, 2008). For generating inflected
forms based on stems and morphological features,
we use an extended version of the finite-state mor-
phology FRMOR (Zhou, 2007). Additionally, we
use a manually compiled list of abbreviations and
named entities (names of countries) and their re-
spective grammatical gender.

Stemming For building the SMT system, the
French data (parallel and monolingual) is trans-
formed into a stemmed representation. Nouns,
i.e. the heads of NPs or PPs, are marked with
inflection-relevant features: gender is considered
as part of the stem, whereas number is determined
by the source-side input: for example, we expect
source-language words in plural to be translated by
translated by stems with plural markup. This stem-
markup is necessary in order to guarantee that the
number information is not lost during translation.
For a better generalization, portmanteaus are split
into separate parts: au → à+le (meaning, “to the”).

Predicting morphological features For predict-
ing the morphological features of the SMT output
(number and gender), we use a linear chain CRF
(Lavergne et al., 2010) trained on data annotated
with these features using n-grams of stems and part-
of-speech tags within a window of 4 positions to
each side of the current word. Through the CRF,
the values specified in the stem-markup (number
and gender on nouns) are propagated over the rest
of the linguistic phrase, as shown in column 2 of
table 4. Based on the stems and the morphological
features, inflected forms can be generated using
FRMOR (column 3).

Post-processing As the French data has been
normalized, a post-processing step is needed in or-
der to generate correct French surface forms: split
portmanteaus are merged into their regular forms
based on a simple rule set. Furthermore, apostro-
phes are reintroduced for words like le, la, ne, ... if
they are followed by a vowel. Column 4 in table 4
shows post-processing including portmanteau for-
mation. Since we work on lowercased data, an
additional recasing step is required.

Experiments and evaluation We use the same
set of reduced parallel data as the FR-EN system;
the language model is built on 32M French sen-
tences. Results for the WMT-2012 test set are given
in table 5. Variant 1 shows the results for a small
system trained only on a part of the training data
(Europarl+News Commentary), whereas variant 2
corresponds to the submitted system. A small-scale
analysis indicated that the inflection prediction sys-
tem tends to have problems with subject-verb agree-
ment. We trained a factored system using addi-
tional PoS-tags with number information which
lead to a small improvement on both variants.

While the small model is significantly better than
the baseline2 as it benefits more from the general-
ization, the result for the full system is worse than
the baseline3. Here, given the large amount of
data, the generalization effect has less influence.
However, we assume that the more general model
from the inflection prediction system produces bet-
ter translations than a regular model containing a
large amount of irrelevant inflectional information,
particularly when considering that it can produce
well-formed inflected sequences that are inaccessi-
ble to the baseline. Even though this is not reflected
in terms of BLEU, humans might prefer the inflec-
tion prediction system.

For the WMT-2013 set, we obtain BLEU scores
of 29.6 (ci) and 28.30 (cs) with the inflection pre-
diction system mes-inflection (marked in table 5).

5 Russian-English

The preparation of the Russian data includes the
following stages: (1) tokenization and tagging and
(2) morphological reduction.

Tagging and tagging errors For tagging, we use
a version of RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008)

2Pairwise bootstrap resampling with 1000 samples.
3However, the large inflection-prediction system has a

slightly better NIST score than the baseline (7.63 vs. 7.61).

that has been developed based on data tagged with
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) using a model from
Sharoff et al. (2008). The data processed by Tree-
Tagger contained errors such as wrong definition
of PoS for adverbs, wrong selection of gender for
adjectives in plural and missing features for pro-
nouns and adverbs. In order to train RFTagger, the
output of TreeTagger was corrected with a set of
empirical rules. In particular, the morphological
features of nominal phrases were made consistent
to train RFTagger: in contrast to TreeTagger, where
morphological features are regarded as part of the
PoS-tag, RFTagger allows for a separate handling
of morphological features and POS tags.

Despite a generally good tagging quality, some
errors seem to be unavoidable due to the ambiguity
of certain grammatical forms in Russian. A good
example of this are neuter nouns that have the same
form in all cases, or feminine nouns, which have
identical forms in singular genitive and plural nom-
inative (Sharoff et al., 2008). Since Russian has no
binding word order, and the case of nouns cannot
be determined on that basis, such errors cannot be
corrected with empirical rules implemented as post-

processing. Similar errors occur when specifying
the case of adjectives, since the suffixes of adjec-
tives are even less varied as compared to the nouns.
In our application, we hope that this type of error
does not affect the result due to the following sup-
pression of a number of morphological attributes
including the case of adjectives.

Morphological reduction In comparison to
Slavic languages, English is morphologically poor.
For example, English has no morphological at-
tributes for nouns and adjectives to express gender
or case; verbs have no gender either. In contrast,
Russian is morphologically very rich – there are
e.g. 6 cases and 3 grammatical genders, which
manifest themselves in different suffixes for nouns,
pronouns, adjectives and some verb forms. When
translating from Russian into English, many of
these attributes are (hopefully) redundant and are
therefore deleted from the training data. The mor-
phological reduction in our system was applied to
nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions
and conjunctions. The rest of the POS (adverbs,
particles, interjections and abbreviations) have no
morphological attributes. The list of the original
and the reduced attributes is given in Table 6.

Transliteration mining to handle OOVs The
machine translation system fails to translate out-of-
vocabulary words (OOVs) as they are unknown to
the training data. Most of the OOVs are named en-
tities and transliterating them to the target language
script could solve this problem. The transliteration
system requires a list of transliteration pairs for
training. As we do not have such a list, we use
the unsupervised transliteration mining system of
Sajjad et al. (2012) that takes a list of word pairs for

training and extracts transliteration pairs that can
be used for the training of the transliteration system.
The procedure of mining transliteration pairs and
transliterating OOVs is described as follows: We
word-align the parallel corpus using GIZA++ and
symmetrize the alignments using the grow-diag-
final-and heuristic. We extract all word pairs which
occur as 1-to-1 alignments (Sajjad et al., 2011) and
later refer to them as a list of word pairs. We train
the unsupervised transliteration mining system on
the list of word pairs and extract transliteration
pairs. We use these mined pairs to build a transliter-
ation system using the Moses toolkit. The translit-
eration system is applied as a post-processing step
to transliterate OOVs.

The morphological reduction of Russian (cf. sec-
tion 5) does not process most of the OOVs as they
are also unknown to the POS tagger. So OOVs that
we get are in their original form. When translit-

erating them, the inflected forms generate wrong
English transliterations as inflectional suffixes get
transliterated too, specially OOV named entities.
We solved this problem by stemming the OOVs
based on a list of suffixes ( , , , , , ) and
transliterating the stemmed forms.

Experiments and results We trained the sys-
tems separately on GIZA++ and transliteration
augmented-GIZA++ (TA-GIZA++) to compare
their results; for more details see Sajjad et al.
(2013). All systems are tuned using PROv1 (Nakov
et al., 2012). The translation output is post-
processed to transliterate OOVs.

Table 7 summarizes the results of RU-EN trans-
lation systems trained on the original corpus and
on the morph-reduced corpus. Using TA-GIZA++
alignment gives the best results for both WMT-
2012 and WMT-2013, leading to an improvement
of 0.4 BLEU points.

The system built on the morph-reduced data
leads to decreased BLEU results. However, the per-
centage of OOVs is reduced for both test sets when
using the morph-reduced data set compared to the
original data. An analysis of the output showed
that the morph-reduced system makes mistakes in
choosing the right tense of the verb, which might
be one reason for this outcome. In the future, we
would like to investigate this issue in detail.

6 German to English and English to
German

We submitted systems for DE-EN and EN-DE
which used constituent parses for pre-reordering.
For DE-EN we also deal with word formation is-
sues such as compound splitting. We did not per-
form inflectional normalization or generation for
German due to time constraints, instead focusing

236



our efforts on these issues for French and Russian
as previously described.

German to English German has a wider diver-
sity of clausal orderings than English, all of which
need to be mapped to the English SVO order. This
is a difficult problem to solve during inference, as
shown for hierarchical SMT by Fabienne Braune
and Fraser (2012) and for phrase-based SMT by
Bisazza and Federico (2012).

We syntactically parsed all of the source side
sentences of the parallel German to English data
available, and the tuning, test and blindtest sets.
We then applied reordering rules to these parses.
We use the rules for reordering German constituent
parses of Collins et al. (2005) together with the
additional rules described by Fraser (2009). These
are applied as a preprocess to all German data.

For parsing the German sentences, we used the
generative phrase-structure parser BitPar with opti-
mizations of the grammar, as described by Fraser
et al. (2013). The parser was trained on the Tiger
Treebank (Brants et al., 2002) along with utilizing
the Europarl corpus as unlabeled data. At the train-
ing of Bitpar, we followed the targeted self-training
approach (Katz-Brown et al., 2011) as follows. We
parsed the whole Europarl corpus using a grammar
trained on the Tiger corpus and extracted the 100-
best parse trees for each sentence. We selected the
parse tree among the 100 candidates which got the
highest usefulness scores for the reordering task.
Then we trained a new grammar on the concatena-
tion of the Tiger corpus and the automatic parses
from Europarl.

The usefulness score estimates the value of a
parse tree for the reordering task. We calculated
this score as the similarity between the word order
achieved by applying the parse tree-based reorder-
ing rules of Fraser (2009) and the word order indi-
cated by the automatic word alignment between
the German and English sentences in Europarl.
We used the Kendall’s Tau Distance as the simi-
larity metric of two word orderings (as suggested
by Birch and Osborne (2010)).

Following this, we performed linguistically-
informed compound splitting, using the system of
Fritzinger and Fraser (2010), which disambiguates
competing analyses from the high-recall Stuttgart
Morphological Analyzer SMOR (Schmid et al.,
2004) using corpus statistics. We also split German
portmanteaus like zum → zu dem (meaning to the).

English to German The task of mapping En-
glish SVO order to the different clausal orders in
German is difficult. For our English to German
systems, we solved this by parsing the English and
applying the system of Gojun and Fraser (2012) to
reorder English into the correct German clausal or-
der (depending on the clause type which is detected
using the English parse, see (Gojun and Fraser,
2012) for further details).

We primarily used the Charniak-Johnson gener-
ative parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) to parse
the English Europarl data and the test data. How-
ever, due to time constraints we additionally used
Berkeley parses of about 400K Europarl sentences
and the other English parallel training data. We
also left a small amount of the English parallel
training data unparsed, which means that it was
not reordered. For tune, test and blindtest (WMT-
2013), we used the Charniak-Johnson generative
parser.

Experiments and results We used all available
training data for constrained systems; results for
the WMT-2013 set are given in table 8. For the
contrastive BitPar results, we reparsed WMT-2013.

7 Conclusion

We presented 5 systems dealing with complex mor-
phology. For two language pairs with a morpho-
logically rich source language (FR and RU), the
input was reduced to a simplified representation
containing only translation-relevant morphologi-
cal information (e.g. number on nouns). We also
used reordering techniques for DE-EN and EN-DE.
For translating into a language with rich morphol-
ogy (EN-FR), we applied a two-step method that
first translates into a stemmed representation of
the target language and then generates inflected
forms based on morphological features predicted
on monolingual data.
