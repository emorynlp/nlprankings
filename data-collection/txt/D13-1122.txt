Abstract

Hypernym discovery aims to extract such
noun pairs that one noun is a hypernym of
the other. Most previous methods are based
on lexical patterns but perform badly on open-
domain data. Other work extracts hypernym
relations from encyclopedias but has limited
coverage. This paper proposes a simple yet ef-
fective distant supervision framework for Chi-
nese open-domain hypernym discovery. Giv-
en an entity name, we try to discover its hy-
pernyms by leveraging knowledge from mul-
tiple sources, i.e., search engine results, ency-
clopedias, and morphology of the entity name.
First, we extract candidate hypernyms from
the above sources. Then, we apply a statistical
ranking model to select correct hypernyms. A
set of novel features is proposed for the rank-
ing model. We also present a heuristic strate-
gy to build a large-scale noisy training data for
the model without human annotation. Exper-
imental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a
manually labeled test dataset.

1 Introduction

Hypernym discovery is a task to extract such noun
pairs that one noun is a hypernym of the other (S-
now et al., 2005). A noun H is a hypernym of an-
other noun E if E is an instance or subclass of H. In
other word, H is a semantic class of E. For instance,
“actor” is a hypernym of “Mel Gibson”; “dog” is a
hypernym of “Caucasian sheepdog”; “medicine” is
a hypernym of “Aspirin”. Hypernym discovery is
an important subtask of semantic relation extraction

and has many applications in ontology construction
(Suchanek et al., 2008), machine reading (Etzion-
i et al., 2006), question answering (McNamee et al.,
2008), and so on.

Some manually constructed thesauri such as
WordNet can also provide some semantic relations
such as hypernyms. However, these thesauri are lim-
ited in its scope and domain, and manual construc-
tion is knowledge-intensive and time-consuming.
Therefore, many researchers try to automatically ex-
tract semantic relations or to construct taxonomies.

Most previous methods on automatic hypernym
discovery are based on lexical patterns and suffer
from the problem that such patterns can only cov-
er a small part of complex linguistic circumstances
(Hearst, 1992; Turney et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,
2011). Other work tries to extract hypernym rela-
tions from large-scale encyclopedias like Wikipedia
and achieves high precision (Suchanek et al., 2008;
Hoffart et al., 2012). However, the coverage is limit-
ed since there exist many infrequent and new entities
that are missing in encyclopedias (Lin et al., 2012).
We made similar observation that more than a half
of entities in our data set have no entries in the en-
cyclopedias.

This paper proposes a simple yet effective distan-
t supervision framework for Chinese open-domain
hypernym discovery. Given an entity name, our goal
is to discover its hypernyms by leveraging knowl-
edge from multiple sources. Considering the case
where a person wants to know the meaning of an un-
known entity, he/she may search it in a search engine
and then finds out the answer after going through the
search results. Furthermore, if he/she finds an en-
try about the entity in an authentic web site, such as
Wikipedia, the information will help him/her under-

stand the entity. Also, the morphology of the enti-
ty name can provide supplementary information. In
this paper, we imitate the process. The evidences
from the above sources are integrated in our hyper-
nym discovery model.

Our approach is composed of two major steps:
hypernym candidate extraction and ranking. In the
first step, we collect hypernym candidates from mul-
tiple sources. Given an entity name, we search it in
a search engine and extract high-frequency nouns as
its main candidate hypernyms from the search re-
sults. We also collect the category tags for the entity
from two Chinese encyclopedias and the head word
of the entity as the candidates.

In the second step, we identify correct hypernyms
from the candidates. We view this task as a rank-
ing problem and propose a set of effective features
to build a statistical ranking model. For the param-
eter learning of the model, we also present a heuris-
tic strategy to build a large-scale noisy training data
without human annotation.

Our contributions are as follows:

• We are the first to discover hypernym for Chi-
nese open-domain entities by exploiting mul-
tiple sources. The evidences from different
sources can authenticate and complement each
other to improve both precision and recall.

• We manually annotate a dataset containing
1,879 Chinese entities and their hypernyms,
which will be made publicly available. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset
for Chinese hypernyms.

• We propose a set of novel and effective fea-
tures for hypernym ranking. Experimental re-
sults show that our method achieves the best
performance.

Furthermore, our approach can be easily ported
from Chinese to English and other languages, except
that a few language dependent features need to be
changed.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 discusses the related work. Section
3 introduces our method in detail. Section 4 de-
scribes the experimental setup. Section 5 shows the
experimental results. Conclusion and future work
are presented in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Previous methods for hypernym discovery can be
summarized into two major categories, i.e., pattern-
based methods and encyclopedia-based methods.

Pattern-based methods make use of manually
or automatically constructed patterns to mine hyper-
nym relations from text corpora. The pioneer work
by Hearst (1992) finds that linking two noun phras-
es (NPs) via certain lexical constructions often im-
plies hypernym relations. For example, NP1 is a hy-
pernym of NP2 in the lexical pattern “such NP1 as
NP2”. Similarly, succeeding researchers follow her
work and use handcrafted patterns to extract hyper-
nym pairs from corpora (Caraballo, 1999; Scott and
Dominic, 2003; Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Tur-
ney et al., 2003; Pasca, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2005;
Ritter et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011).

Evans (2004) considers the web data as a large
corpus and uses search engines to identify hyper-
nyms based on lexical patterns. Given an arbitrary
document, he takes each capitalized word sequence
as an entity and aims to find its potential hypernyms
through pattern-based web searching. Suppose X is
a capitalized word sequence. Some pattern queries
like “such as X” are threw into the search engine.
Then, in the retrieved documents, the nouns that im-
mediately precede the pattern are recognized as the
hypernyms of X. This work is most related to ours.
However, the patterns used in his work are too strict
to cover many low-frequency entities, and our ex-
periments show the weakness of the method.

Snow et al. (2005) for the first time propose to au-
tomatically extract large numbers of lexico-syntactic
patterns and then detect hypernym relations from
a large newswire corpus. First, they use some
known hypernym-hyponym pairs from WordNet as
seeds and collect many patterns from a syntactical-
ly parsed corpus in a bootstrapping way. Then, they
consider all noun pairs in the same sentence as po-
tential hypernym-hyponym pairs and use a statistical
classifier to recognize the correct ones. All patterns
corresponding to the noun pairs in the corpus are
fed into the classifier as features. Their method re-
lies on accurate syntactic parsers and it is difficult to
guarantee the quality of the automatically extracted
patterns. Our experiments show that their method is
inferior to ours.

1225



Encyclopedia-based methods extract hyper-
nym relations from encyclopedias like Wikipedia
(Suchanek et al., 2008; Hoffart et al., 2012). The
user-labeled information in encyclopedias, such as
category tags in Wikipedia, is often used to derive
hypernym relations.

In the construction of the famous ontology YA-
GO, Suchanek et al. (2008) consider the title of each
Wikipedia page as an entity and the corresponding
category tags as its potential hypernyms. They ap-
ply a shallow semantic parser and some rules to dis-
tinguish the correct hypernyms. Heuristically, they
find that if the head of the category tag is a plural
word, the tag is most likely to be a correct hyper-
nym. However, this method cannot be used in Chi-
nese because of the lack of plurality information.

The method of Suchanek et al. (2008) cannot han-
dle the case when the entity is absent in Wikipedia.
To solve this problem, Lin et al. (2012) connect the
absent entities with the entities present in Wikipedia
sharing common contexts. They utilize the Freebase
semantic types to label the present entities and then
propagate the types to the absent entities. The Free-
base contains most of entities in Wikipedia and as-
signs them semantic types defined in advance. But
there are no such resources in Chinese.

Compared with previous work, our approach tries
to identify hypernyms from multiple sources. The
evidences from different sources can authenticate
and complement each other to improve both preci-
sion and recall. Our experimental results show the
effectiveness of our method.

3 Method

Our method is composed of two steps. First, we col-
lect candidate hypernyms from multiple sources for
a given entity. Then, a statistical model is built for
hypernym ranking based on a set of effective fea-
tures. Besides, we also present a heuristic strategy
to build a large-scale training data.

3.1 Candidate Hypernym Collection from
Multiple Sources

In this work, we collect potential hypernyms from
four sources, i.e., search engine results, two ency-
clopedias, and morphology of the entity name.

We count the co-occurrence frequency between

the target entities and other words in the returned
snippets and titles, and select top N nouns (or noun
phrases) as the main candidates. As the experiments
show, this method can find at least one hypernym
for 86.91% entities when N equals 10 (see Section
5.1). This roughly explains why people often can in-
fer semantic meaning of unknown entities after go-
ing through several search results.

Furthermore, the user-generated encyclopedia
category tags are important clues if the entity exist-
s in a encyclopedia. Thus we add these tags into
the candidates. In this work, we consider two Chi-
nese encyclopedias, Baidubaike and Hudongbaike1,
as hypernym sources.

In addition, the head words of entities are also
their hypernyms sometimes. For example, the head
word of “2è� (Emperor Penguin)” indicates
that it’s a kind of “è� (penguins)”. Thus we put
head words into the hypernym candidates. In Chi-
nese, head words are often laid after their modifiers.
Therefore, we try to segment a given entity. If it can
be segmented and the last word is a noun, we take
the last word as the head word. In our data set, the
head words of 41.35% entities are real hypernyms
(see Section 5.1).

We combine all of these hypernym candidates to-
gether as the input of the second stage. The final
coverage rate reaches 93.24%.

3.2 Hypernym Ranking

After getting the candidate hypernyms, we then
adopt a ranking model to determine the correct hy-
pernym. In this section, we propose several effective
features for the model. The model needs training da-
ta for learning how to rank the data in addition to
parameter setting. Considering that manually anno-
tating a large-scale hypernym dataset is costly and
time-consuming, we present a heuristic strategy to
collect training data. We compare three hypernym
ranking models on this data set, including Support
Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, SVM
with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and Logis-
tic Regression (LR).

1Baidubaike (http://baike.baidu.com) and
Hudongbaike (http://www.baike.com) are two largest
Chinese encyclopedias containing more than 6.26 million and
7.87 million entries respectively, while Chinese Wikipedia
contains about 0.72 million entries until September, 2013.

Table 1: The features for ranking

3.2.1 Features for Ranking
The features for hypernym ranking are shown in

Table 1. We illustrate them in detail in the following.
Hypernym Prior: Intuitively, different words

have different probabilities as hypernyms of some
other words. Some are more probable as hypernyms,
such as animal, plant and fruit. Some other words
such as sun, nature and alias, are not usually used
as hypernyms. Thus we use a prior probability to
express this phenomenon. The assumption is that if
the more frequent that a noun appears as category
tags, the more likely it is a hypernym. We extract
category tags from 2.4 million pages in Baidubaike,
and compute the prior probabilities prior(w) for a
word w being a potential hypernym using Equation
1. countCT (w) denotes the times a word appeared
as a category tag in the encyclopedia pages.

prior(w) =
countCT (w)∑
w′ countCT (w

′)
(1)

In Titles: When we enter a query into a search
engine, the engine returns a search result list, which
contains document titles and their snippet text. The
distributions of hypernyms and non-hypernyms in ti-
tles are compared with that in snippets respectively
in our training data. We discover that the average
frequency of occurrence of hypernyms in titles is
15.60 while this number of non-hypernyms is only
5.18, while the difference in snippets is very small
(Table 2). Thus the frequency of candidates in titles
can be used as features. In this work the frequency

Avg. Frequency in
titles snippets

Hypernym 15.60 33.69
Non-Hypernym 5.18 30.61

Table 2: Distributions of candidate hypernyms in titles
and snippets

is divided into three cases: greater than 15.60, less
than 5.18, and between 5.18 and 15.60. Three binary
features are used to represent these cases.

Synonyms: If there exist synonyms of a candi-
date hypernym in the candidate list, the candidate is
probably correct answer. For example, when “¬
(medicine)” and “Ô (medicine)” both appear in
the candidate list of an entity, the entity is probably
a kind of medicine. We get synonyms of a candidate
from a Chinese semantic thesaurus – Tongyi Cilin
(Extended) (CilinE for short)2 and compute the s-
core as a feature using Equation 2.

ratiosyn(h, le) =
countsyn(h, le)

len(le)
(2)

Given a hypernym candidate h of an entity e and
the list of all candidates le, we compute the ratio of
the synonyms of h in le. countsyn(h, le) denotes the
count of the synonyms of h in le. len(le) is the total
count of candidates.

2CilinE contains synonym and hypernym relations among
77 thousand words, which is manually organized as a hierarchy
of five levels.

1227



Radicals: Chinese characters are a form of
ideogram. By far, the bulk of Chinese characters
were created by linking together a character with a
related meaning and another character to indicate its
pronunciation. The character with a related meaning
is called radical. Sometimes, it is a important clue to
indicate the semantic class of the whole character.
For example, the radical “Á” means insects, so it
hints “|n (dragonfly)” is a kind of insects. Simi-
larly “û” hints “�nJ (lymphoma)” is a kind of
diseases. Thus we use radicals as a feature the value
of which is computed by using Equation 3.

radical(e, h) =
countRM (e, h)

len(h)
(3)

Here radical(e, h) denotes the ratio of characters
radical-matched with the last character of the entity
e in the hypernym h. countRM (e, h) denotes the
count of the radical-matched characters in h. len(h)
denotes the total count of the characters in h.

3.2.2 Training Data Collection
Now training data is imperative to learn the

weights of the features in Section 3.2.1. Hence, we
propose a heuristic strategy to collect training data
from encyclopedias.

Firstly, we extract a number of open-domain enti-
ties from encyclopedias randomly. Then their hyper-
nym candidates are collected by using the method
proposed in Section 3.1. We select positive training
instances following two principles:

• Principle 1: Among the four sources used for
candidate collection, the more sources from
which the hypernym candidate is extracted, the
more likely it is a correct one.

• Principle 2: The higher the prior of the candi-
date being a hypernym is, the more likely it is a
correct one.

We select the best candidates following Principle
1 and then select the best one in them as a positive
instance following Principle 2. And we select a can-
didate as a negative training instance when it is from
only one source and its prior is the lowest. If there
are synonyms of training instances in the candidates
list, the synonyms are also extended into the training
set.

Table 3: The evaluation data

In this way, we collect training data automatically,
which are used to learn the feature weights of the
ranking models.

4 Experimental Setup

In this work, we use Baidu3 search engine, the most
popular search engine for Chinese, and get the top
100 search results for each entity. The Chinese seg-
mentation, POS tagging and dependency parsing is
provided by an open-source Chinese language pro-
cessing platform LTP4 (Che et al., 2010).

4.1 Experimental Data

In our experiments, we prepare open-domain enti-
ties from dictionaries in wide domains, which are
published by a Chinese input method editor soft-
ware Sogou Pinyin5. The domains include biology,
health care, food, movie, industry, and so on. We
sample 1,879 entities from these domain dictionaries
and randomly split them into 1/5 for developmen-
t and 4/5 for test (Table 3). We find that only 865
(46.04%) entities exist in Baidubaike or Hudong-
baike. Then we extract candidate hypernyms for the
entities and ask two annotators to judge each hyper-
nym relation pair true or false manually. A pair (E,
H) is annotated as true if the annotators judge “E is a
(or a kind of) H” is true. Finally, we get 12.53 candi-
date hypernyms for each entity on average in which
about 2.09 hypernyms are correct. 4,330 hypernym
relation pairs are judged by both the annotators. We
measure the agreement of the judges using the Kap-
pa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan Jr, 1988). The

Our training data, containing 11,481 positive in-

Baidubaike and Hudongbaike using the heuristic s-
trategy proposed in Section 3.2.2.

4.2 Experimental Metrics

The evaluation metrics for our task include:
Coverage Rate: We evaluate coverage rate of the

candidate hypernyms. Coverage rate is the number
of entities for which at least one correct hypernym is
found divided by the total number of all entities.

Precision@1: Our method returns a ranked list
of hypernyms for each entity. We evaluate precision
of top-1 hypernyms (the most probable ones) in the
ranked lists, which is the number of correct top-1
hypernyms divided by the number of all entities.

R-precision: It is equivalent to Precision@R
where R is the total number of candidates labeled
as true hypernyms of an entity.

Precision, Recall, and F-score: Besides, we can
convert our ranking models to classification models
by setting thresholds. Varying the thresholds, we can
get different precisions, recalls, and F-scores.

5 Results and Analysis

5.1 The Coverage of Candidate Hypernyms

In this section, we evaluate the coverage rate of the
candidate hypernyms. We check the candidate hy-
pernyms of the whole 1,879 entities in the develop-
ment and test sets and see how many entities we can
collect at least one correct hypernym for.

SR10 + HW 0.9117 9.75
ET + HW 0.7073 3.92
SR10 + ET + HW 0.9324 12.53

Table 4: Coverage evaluation of the candidate hypernym
extraction

There are four different sources to collect candi-
dates as described in Section 3.1, which can be di-
vided into three kinds: search results (SR for short),
encyclopedia tags (ET) and head words (HW). For
SR, we select top N frequent nouns (SRN ) in the
search results of an entity as its hypernym candi-
dates. The effect of coverage rate while varying N
is shown in Figure 1. As we can see from the fig-
ure, the coverage rate is improved significantly by
increasing N until N reaches 10. After that, the
improvement becomes slight. When the candidates
from all sources are merged, the coverage rate is fur-
ther improved.

Thus we set N as 10 in the remaining experi-
ments. The detail evaluation is shown in Table 4.
We can see that top 10 frequent nouns in the search
results contain at least one correct hypernym for
86.91% entities in our data set. This coincides with
the intuition that people usually can infer the seman-
tic classes of unknown entities by searching them in
web search engines.

The coverage rate of ET merely reaches 39.38%.
We find the reason is that more than half of the enti-
ties have no encyclopedia pages. The average num-
ber of candidate hypernyms from ET is 3.07. Note
that the number is calculated among all the enti-
ties. We also calculate the average number only for
the present entities in encyclopedias. The number
reaches 6.68. The reason is that for many present en-
tities, the category tags include not only hypernyms
∗For some of entities are rare, there may be less than 10

nouns in the search results. So the average count of candidates
is less than 10.
†Not all of the entities can be segmented. We cannot get the

head words of the ones that cannot be segmented.

but also related words. For example, “Ù.�|¥
% (Bradley Center)” in Baidubaike have 5 tags, i.e.,
“NBA”, “N (sports)”, “N$Ä (sports)”, “;
¥ (basketball)”, and “|, (arena)”. Among them,
only “|, (arena)” is a proper hypernym whereas
the others are some related words indicating mere-
ly thematic vicinity. Comparing the results of SR10
and SR10 + ET, we can see that collecting candidates
from ET can improve coverage, although many in-
correct candidates are added in at the same time.

The HW source provides 0.87 candidates on av-
erage with 41.35% coverage rate. That is to say, for
these entities, people can infer the semantic classes
when they see the surface lexicon.

At last, we combine the candidates from all of the
three sources as the input of the ranking methods.
The coverage rate reaches 93.24%.

We also compare with the manually construct-
ed semantic thesaurus CilinE mentioned in Section
3.2.1. Only 29 entities exist in CilinE (coverage rate
is only 1.54%). That is why we try to automatically
extract hypernym relations.

5.2 Evaluation of the Ranking

5.2.1 Overall Performance Comparison

In this section, we compare our proposed methods
with other methods. Table 5 lists the performance
measured by precision at rank 1 and R-precision of
some key methods. The precision-recall curves of
all the methods are shown in Figure 2. Table 7 lists
the maximum F-scores.

MPattern refers to the pattern-based method of
Hearst (1992). We craft Chinese Hearst-style
patterns (Table 6), in which E represents an entity
and H represents one of its hypernyms. Following

Pattern Translation
E´(/«) H E is a (a kind of) H
E (!)� H E(,) and other H
H (§)�() E H(,) called E
H (§)()X E H(,) such as E
H (§)AO´ E H(,) especially E

Table 6: Chinese Hearst-style lexical patterns

Evans (2004), we combine each pattern and each en-
tity and submit them into the Baidu search engine.
For example, for an entity E, we search “E ´
 (E is a)”, “E � (E and other)”, and so on. We
select top 100 search results of each query and get
1,285,209 results in all for the entities in the test set.
Then we use the patterns to extract hypernyms from
the search results. The result shows that 508 cor-
rect hypernyms are extracted for 568 entities (1,529
entities in total). Only a small part of the entities
can be extracted hypernyms for. This is mainly be-
cause only a few hypernym relations are expressed
in these fixed patterns in the web, and many ones are
expressed in more flexible manners. The hypernyms
are ranked based on the count of evidences where
the hypernyms are extracted.

MSnow is the method originally proposed by S-
now et al. (2005) for English but we adapt it for Chi-
nese. We consider the top 100 search results for each
known hypernym-hyponym pairs as a corpus to ex-
tract lexico-syntactic patterns. Then, an LR classi-
fier is built based on this patterns to recognize hy-
pernym relations. This method considers all noun-
s co-occurred with the focused entity in the same
sentences as candidate hypernyms. So the number
of candidates is huge, which causes inefficiency. In

our corpus, there are 652,181 candidates for 1,529
entities (426.54 for each entity on average), most of
which are not hypernyms. One possible reason is
that this method relies on an accurate syntactic pars-
er and it is difficult to guarantee the quality of the
automatically extracted patterns. Even worse, the
low quality of the language in the search results may
make this problem more serious.

MPrior refers to the ranking method based on on-
ly the prior of a candidate being a hypernym. As
Table 5 shows, it outperforms MSnow and achieves
comparable results with MPattern on Precision@1
and R-Precision.

Based on the features proposed in Section 3.2.1,
we train several statistical models based on SVM
and LR on the training data. MSV M−linear and
MSV M−rbf refer to the SVM models based on linear
kernels and RBF kernels respectively. MLR refers
to the LR model. The probabilities6 output by the
models are used to rank the candidate hypernyms.
All of the parameters which need to be set in the
models are selected on the development set. Table
5 shows the best models based on each algorithm.
These supervised models outperform the previous
methods. MLR achieves the best performance.

The precision-recall plot of the methods on the
test set is presented in Figure 2. MHeuristic refers
to the heuristic approach, proposed in Section 3.2.2,
to collect training data. Because this method cannot

6The output of an SVM is the distance from the decision
hyper-plane. Sigmoid functions can be used to convert this un-
calibrated distance into a calibrated posterior probability (Platt,
1999).

ble 5. For fair comparison of R-precision and recall,
we add the extra correct hypernyms from MPattern
and MSnow to the test data set. The models based
on SVM and LR still perform better than the other
methods. MPattern and MSnow suffer from low re-
call and precision. MHeuristic get a high precision
but a low recall, because it can only deal with a part
of entities appearing in encyclopedias. The preci-
sion of MHeuristic reflects the quality of our training
data. We summarize the maximum F-score of dif-
ferent methods in Table 7.

5.2.2 Feature Effect
Table 8 shows the impact of each feature on the

performance of LR models. When we remove any
one of the features, the performance is degraded
more or less. The most effective features are Is Tag
and Is Head. The last line in Table 8 shows the
performance when we remove all features about
the source information, i.e., Is Tag, Is Head, and

This indicates the importance of the source informa-
tion for hypernym ranking.

5.2.3 The Performance in Each Domain
In this section, we evaluate the performance of

MLR method in various domains. We can see from
Table 9 that the performance in movie domain is best
while the performance in industry domain is worst.
That is because the information about movies is
abundant on the web. Furthermore, most of movies
have encyclopedia pages. It is easy to get the hy-
pernyms. In contrast, the entities in industry domain
are more uncommon. On the whole, our method is
robust for different domains. In Table 10, some in-
stances in various domains are presented.

5.3 Error Analysis

The uncovered entities7 and the false positives8 are
analyzed after the experiments. Some error exam-
ples are shown in Table 10 (in red font).

7Uncovered entities are entities which we do not collect any
correct hypernyms for in the first step.

8False positives are hypernyms ranked at the first places, but
actually are not correct hypernyms.

Uncovered entities: About 34% of the errors are
caused by uncovered entities. It is found that many
of the uncovered entities are rare entities. Nearly
36% of them are very rare and have only less than
100 search results in all. When we can’t get enough
information of an unknown entity from the search
engine, it’s difficult to know its semantic meaning,
such as “@U= (mastigium)”, “Ä!Ï (coxal cav-
ity)”, “Þu (coma)”. The identification of their hy-
pernyms requires more human-crafted knowledge.
The ranking models we used are unable to select
them, as the true synonyms are often below rank 10.

False positives: The remained 66% errors are
false positives. They are mainly owing to the
fact that some other related words in the candi-
date lists are more likely hypernyms. For exam-
ple, “)Ô (organism)” is wrongly recognized as
the most probable hypernym of “¯UX�=
£s (Ethanolamine phosphotransferase)”, because
the entity often co-occurs with word “)Ô (organ-
ism)” and the latter is often used as a hypernym of
some other entities. The correct hypernyms actu-
ally are “s (enzyme)”, “zÆÔ (chemical sub-
stance)”, and so on.

6 Conclusion

This paper proposes a novel method for finding
hypernyms of Chinese open-domain entities from
multiple sources. We collect candidate hypernyms
with wide coverage from search results, encyclope-
dia category tags and the head word of the entity.
Then, we propose a set of features to build statisti-
cal models to rank the candidate hypernyms on the
training data collected automatically. In our exper-
iments, we show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best preci-

1232



sion of 76.32% on a manually labeled test dataset.
All of the features which we propose are effective,
especially the features of source information. More-
over, our method works well in various domains, e-
specially in the movie and biology domains. We al-
so conduct detailed analysis to give more insights
on the error distribution. Except some language de-
pendent features, our approach can be easily trans-
fered from Chinese to other languages. For future
work, we would like to explore knowledge from
more sources to enhance our model, such as seman-
tic thesauri and infoboxes in encyclopedias.
