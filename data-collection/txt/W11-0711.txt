Abstract

Email is an important way of communication
in our daily life and it has become the subject
of various NLP and social studies. In this pa-
per, we focus on email formality and explore
the factors that could affect the sender’s choice
of formality. As a case study, we use the En-
ron email corpus to test how formality is af-
fected by social distance, relative power, and
the weight of imposition, as defined in Brown
and Levinson’s model of politeness (1987).
Our experiments show that their model largely
holds in the Enron corpus. We believe that
the methodology proposed in the paper can be
applied to other social media domains and be
used to test other linguistic or social theories.

1 Introduction

Email has become an important way of communica-
tion in our daily life. Because of its wide usage,
it has been the subject of various studies such as
social network analysis (e.g., (Leuski, 2004; Dies-
ner et al., 2005; Carvalho et al., 2007)), deception
detection (e.g., (Zhou et al., 2004; Keila and Skill-
corn, 2005)), information extraction (e.g., (Culotta
et al., 2004; Minkov et al., 2005)), and topic discov-
ery (e.g., (McCallum et al., 2007)). In this study, we
focus on email formality in various social settings;
that is, we want to determine whether the choice of
formality in email communication is affected by fac-
tors such as the social distance and relative power
between the senders and the recipients.

While an early perspective of email communica-
tion held that email is a lean medium which lacks vi-
tal social cues (Daft and Lengel, 1986), other work

has shown that senders of email exhibit a wide range
of language and form choices which vary in differ-
ent social contexts (Orlikowski and Yates, 1994).
Through various theories of sociolinguistics, it is
proposed that these changes take place in a pre-
dictable manner.

Brown and Levinson (1987) have proposed a
model where in order to save the “face” or public
self image of the hearer of a message, a speaker can
employ a range of verbal strategies. Their model
of politeness states that in social situations there
are three factors which are considered in a decision
whether or when to use communication techniques
such as formality:

1. The “social distance” between the participants
as a symmetric relation

2. The relative “power” between the participants
as an asymmetric relation

3. The weight of an imposition such as a request

Abdullah (2006) examines email interactions
from the perspective of Brown and Levinson’s po-
liteness model in a Malaysian corporation from over
180 participants and a corpus of 770 email mes-
sages. This work directly examines the factors men-
tioned previously which influence email formality.
Unfortunately, the methodology and data were not
provided for this study.

The goal of our work is to test whether Brown
and Levinson’s model holds in a real setting with a
much larger data set. In this study, we chose the En-
ron Email Corpus as our dataset. We first built two
classifiers: one labels an email as formal or informal

86



and the other determines whether an email contains
a request. Next, we used the classifiers to label ev-
ery email in the Enron corpus. Finally, we tested
whether the three factors in Brown and Levinson’s
theory indeed affect formality in email communica-
tion. While we consider the work a case study, we
believe that the methodology proposed in the paper
can be applied to other social media domains and be
used to test other linguistic or social theories.1

2 Overview of the Enron email corpus

The Enron email corpus, which consists of hundreds
of thousands of emails from over a hundred Enron
employees over a period of 3.5 years (1998 to 2002),
was made public during the US government’s legal
investigation of Enron. The corpus was first pro-
cessed and released by Klimt and Yang (2004) at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and this CMU
dataset has later been re-processed by several other
research groups. In this section, we briefly introduce
the datasets that we used in our experiments.

2.1 The ISI dataset

The CMU dataset contains many duplicates. It was
later processed and cleaned by Shetty and Adibi
at ISI and released as a relational database. The
ISI database comprises 252,759 messages from the
email folders of 150 employees (Shetty and Adibi,
2004).2 We use the ISI dataset as the starting point
for all of our experiments except for the one in Sec-
tion 5.1.

2.2 The Sheffield dataset

The Enron email corpus contains both personal and
business emails. In 2006, Jabbari and his colleagues
at the University of Sheffield manually annotated
a subset of the emails in the CMU dataset with
“Business” or “Personal” categories (Jabbari et al.,
2006). The subset contains 14,818 emails and 3,598
of them (24.2%) are labeled as “personal”.3 We use
this dataset in the personal vs. business experiment

as described in Section 5.1.4

2.3 The ISI Enron employee position table
In addition to the ISI database, ISI also provided a
table of 161 employees and their positions in the
company.5 In Section 5.3, we study the effect of
seniority on the formality of a message, and we use
this table to determine the relative seniority between
senders and recipients of a given email.

3 Creating the gold standard

In this study, we build two classifiers: a formality
classifier that determines whether an email is formal,
and a request classifier that determines whether an
email contains a request. In order to train and eval-
uate the classifiers, 400 email messages were ran-
domly chosen from the Enron corpus and manually
labeled for formality and request.

3.1 Formality annotation
Formality is a concept which is difficult to define
precisely and human judgment on whether an email
is formal can be subjective. To determine how much
human annotators can agree on the concept, we
asked three annotators to label 100 out of the 400
emails with four labels: “very formal”, “somewhat
formal”, “somewhat informal”, and “very informal”.

Because formality is hard to define, we did not
give annotators a concrete definition. Instead, we
provided a few guidelines and asked annotators to
follow the guidelines and their intuition. One of
these guidelines was that the formality of an email
should not necessarily be dictated by the relationship
between the sender and the recipient if their rela-
tionship can be inferred from the message. Another
guideline stressed that the nature of an email being
business or personal should not necessarily dictate
its formality. Other than these guidelines, annota-
tors were asked to come up with their own criteria
for formality while doing the annotation.

Table 1 shows the agreement between each anno-
tator pair and the average score of the three pairs.
For agreement, we calculated the accuracy, which

4The ISI dataset and the Sheffield dataset contain significant
overlap as both were derived from the CMU dataset, but the
former is not necessarily a superset of the latter.

A vs. C 85.4/77.2 40.6
B vs. C 84.5/72.9 36.1
Pairwise Ave 85.7/76.0 43.5

Table 1: Inter-annotator agreement for formality annota-
tion

is the percentage of emails that receive the same
label from the two annotators. 2-way agreement
means the agreement is calculated after the label
very formal has been merged with somewhat formal,
and very informal with somewhat informal; 4-way
agreement means that the agreement is calculated
with the four formality labels used by the annota-
tors. With the 2-way distinction (formal vs. infor-
mal), we also calculate the f-score for identifying
informal emails, treating one annotation as the gold
standard and the other as the system output. This
table shows that, although the concept of formality
is intuitive, the inter-annotator agreement on formal-
ity is pretty low (especially when making the 4-way
distinction).

Finally, Annotator A, who had the highest agree-
ment with other annotators, annotated the remain-
ing 300 emails, and his annotation was treated as the
gold standard for our formality classifier.

3.2 Request annotation

In order to train and evaluate our request classifier,
we asked two annotators to go over the same 400
emails and label each message as containing-request
or no-request. A message is considered to contain a
request if it is clear that the sender of the message
expects the recipient to take some action to respond
to the message. For instance, if a message includes
a question such as what do you think? or a request
such as please call me tomorrow, it should be la-
beled as containing-request as the sender expects the
recipient to call the sender or answer the question.
Our definition is slightly different from the defini-
tion of request used in speech acts, and it can be
seen as a synonym of require-action.

While some emails clearly contain requests and
others clearly do not, there is some gray area in be-

tween, which results in the disagreement between
the annotators. Many of the disagreed emails in-
clude sentences such as Let me know if you have
any questions. This very commonly used expression
is itself ambiguous between the meanings “Let me
know whether you have any questions” and “If you
have any questions, please inform me of that fact”.
Furthermore, this sentence often appears as a marker
of politeness or an offer to clarify further, rather than
a request for action. So the correct label of an email
containing this expression depends on the context.
For the 400 messages, the two annotators agreed
on 361 messages, for an inter-annotator agreement
of 90.3% and a F1-score of 87.9% for identifying
emails that contain requests.

4 Building classifiers

In this section, we discuss the feature sets used for
the two classifiers and report their performances.

4.1 Data pre-processing

Before forming the feature vectors for the classi-
fiers, we preprocessed all the emails in the ISI and
Sheffield dataset in several steps. First, we removed
any replied or forwarded message from the email
body as we want to use only the text written by the
sender. If the email body becomes empty after this
step, the email is excluded from the analysis con-
ducted in Section 5. After this step, the size of the
ISI dataset reduces from 252,759 to 232,815 emails,
and the size of the Sheffield dataset changes from
14,818 to 13,882 emails. Second, the email mes-
sages were segmented into sentences and tokenized
with tools in the NLTK package (Bird et al., 2009).

4.2 Formality classifier

For the formality classifier, we use two labels: for-
mal and informal.

4.2.1 Features for formality
During formality annotation, after the 100 emails

had been annotated, the three annotators were asked
to provide a few paragraphs describing their criteria
for formality. In these criteria, more cues are indi-
cators of informality (e.g., the use of vulgar words)
than indicators of formality. We use the follow-
ing features to capture the informal “style” of the

88



emails:6

F1: Informal Word Features, which check the oc-
currences of informal words (see the next sec-
tion for detail)

F2: Punctuation Features:
• Exclamation Points (‘!’)
• Absence of sentence final punctuation
• Frequency of ellipsis (‘. . . ’)

F3: Case features:
• All lowercase Subject line
• Frequency of sentences which were en-

tirely lower case
• Frequency of sentences whose first word

is lower case

4.2.2 Informal words
We designed a simple heuristic method to ex-

tract a list of informal words from the Enron cor-
pus. First, we collect all the unigrams in the Enron
corpus. Second, we retrieve the information about
each unigram from Wordnik,7 a website that pro-
vides access to retrieve word definitions from mul-
tiple source dictionaries. Among the several dictio-
naries crawled by Wordnik, we find Wiktionary to be
the best source for our task since its labels on word
definitions such as ‘informal’, ‘offensive’, ‘vulgar’,
‘colloquial’ and ‘misspelling’ were the most con-
sistent and relevant to our definition of “formality”.
In addition to these labels, the part of speech cate-
gory for ‘interjection’ was also used to determine if
a word might be considered informal in email com-
munication. Third, we use the gathered word defini-
tions to determine whether a word is informal.

One issue with the last step is that words often
have multiple meanings and some meanings are in-
formal and others are not. For instance, the word
bloody can be formal or informal depending on
which meaning is used in an email. As word sense
disambiguation is out of the scope of this work, we
use some simple heuristics to determine whether
a word should be treated as informal or not. In
essence, the process treats a word as informal if a

6We did not use ngram features as they might be too specific
to the small training data we have and might not work well when
applied to other emails in the Enron corpus or emails in other
domain.

large percentage of definitions for the word have cer-
tain labels (e.g., vulgar, offensive, and misspelling)
or certain part-of-speech tags (e.g., interjection).8

4.2.3 Performance of the formality classifier

We trained a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classi-
fier in the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002). Table
2 shows classification accuracy and precision, recall,
and F1-score for identifying informal emails. The
baseline system labels every email as formal because
62.7% of the emails in the dataset were annotated
as formal; its F1-score is zero as the recall is zero.
The numbers for the inter-annotator agreement row
are copied from the pairwise average of the 2-way
agreement in Table 1. The table shows that, with
very few features, the performance of the formal-
ity classifier is much better than the baseline and is
close to inter-annotator agreement. All three types
of features beat the baselines and combining them
provides additional improvement.

10-fold cross validation on the 400 emails. Baseline: la-
bel every email as formal.

4.3 Request classifier

The request classifier uses two labels: containing-
request and no-request.

8We manually checked the list of informal words extracted
and estimated that the number the false positives is less than 1%.
However, the list is definitely not complete as many informal
words in the Enron corpus do not appear in the dictionaries used
by Wordnik.

4.3.1 Features for request
There has been considerable research into cate-

gorizing email messages by function. Cohen, Car-
valho, and Mitchell (2004) described the classifica-
tion of email into ‘email speech acts’, building on
the speech act theory of Searle (1975). Carvalho and
Cohen (2006) achieved high-precision results cate-
gorizing messages into categories such as ’request’
and ’proposal’ when preprocessing the text in cer-
tain ways and using unigram, bigram, and trigram
features only.

Unlike formality, which is more about the style of
the messages (e.g., whether the email is all in lower-
case), the content words are more relevant for iden-
tifying requests. Following the work in (Carvalho
and Cohen, 2006), we used word ngrams as features.
To prevent the features from being too specific to
the small training data, we experimented with two
ways of feature selection: by feature counts and by
chi-square scores. N-grams were extracted from the
email body only. For pre-processing, in addition to
the pre-processing step mentioned in 4.1, we also re-
placed some name entities (e.g., numbers and dates)
with special labels and lowercased the text.

4.3.2 Performance of the request classifier
We trained a MaxEnt classifier and ran 10-fold

cross validation on the 400-email dataset. Figure
1 shows the accuracy of the classifier with differ-
ent feature sets. The bottom dotted line is the base-
line result. In the 400 emails, 244 are labeled as no-
request, so a baseline system that labels everything
as no-request has an accuracy of 61%. The middle
two lines are the accuracy with features that occur no

fewer than 5 or 10 times. For the top two curves, fea-
tures are sorted according to the chi-square scores,
and the top one thousand or five thousand are kept.
X-axis shows the value of n for word ngrams; e.g.,
3-gram means features include word unigrams, bi-
grams, and trigrams. Figure 1 shows that chi-square
scores outperform feature counts for feature selec-
tion, and varying the value of n does not affect the
accuracy very much.

Table 3 shows classification accuracy and preci-
sion, recall, and F1-score for identifying request-
containing emails when n is set to 3. The table
shows that our classifier, regardless of methods used
for feature selection, greatly outperforms the base-
line system, and there is a small gap between the
performance of our classifier and the inter-annotator
agreement. For the rest of our experiment, we will
use 3-gram, Top5000 as the feature set for the re-
quest classifier.

5 Factors influencing formality

As mentioned in Section 1, Brown and Levinson
(1987) proposed three factors that influence commu-
nication choices such as formality: social distance,
relative power, and the weight of an imposition. In
this section, we test whether these factors indeed af-
fect formality in emails.

We measure social distance in two ways: one is
based on the nature of emails (personal vs. busi-
ness), and the other is based on the number of emails
sent from the sender to the recipient. While these
aspects do not directly define the social distance be-
tween individuals, they are employed to illustrate

90



related social properties in absence of data which
outlines the social distance of all Enron employees.
For relative power, we use the rank difference of the
positions that the sender and the recipient held in
Enron. Since relative power is complex to define
without more data, this definition of rank difference
serves as one dimension in which we can study rel-
ative power. For the weight of imposition, we com-
pare emails that contain requests and the ones that
do not.

5.1 Social distance: Personal vs. Business

In general, friends, family and other such personal
contacts are presumably closer in social distance
than business colleagues. Therefore, it is possible
that email messages of a personal nature will be
more likely to be informal than those of a business
nature. To test the hypothesis, we compare the de-
gree of formality in business vs. personal emails.
We use the Sheffield dataset, which contains 13,822
non-empty emails that have been manually labeled
as “personal” or “business”. We ran the formality
classifier on the data, and the results are in Table 4.
The first and second columns show the number of
emails that are labeled as formal or informal by our
formality classifier, and the last column shows the
percentage of emails in that row that are labeled in-
formal (a.k.a. the rate of informality).

The table demonstrates that the rate of informal-
ity in personal emails (56.0%) is indeed much higher
than that of business emails (21.3%). We have run
the Chi-square test and G test with the counts in the
table, and both tests indicate that formality (formal
vs. informal) is not independent from the business
nature of an email message (business vs. personal) at
p=0.0001. The same is true for formality and other
social factors that we tested in this section (see Ta-
bles 5, 7, 8, and 9).9

9There are two caveats for using these statistical tests to de-
termine whether two random variables (formality and a social
factor) are independent. First, the counts in the tables are based
on the output of the two classifiers, which could be different
from the real counts. Second, the data points in some experi-
ments were not chosen randomly from the whole email corpus;
for instance, the emails in Table 7 were from a small set of peo-
ple whose ranks at Enron were known.

Business 8409 2270 21.3%
Total 9819 4063 29.3%

Table 4: Formality in personal vs business emails, p <
0.0001

5.2 Social distance: Amount of contact

Besides the difference in personal and business mat-
ters, another way to measure social distance is the
amount of contact that two individuals have with
each other. People with more email exchange are
likely to be closer in social distance than those with
less email exchange, and are therefore likely to have
a higher rate of informality. To test this hypothesis,
we started with the ISI dataset and looked at the sub-
set of emails where an email has exactly one recipi-
ent, and both the sender and the recipient are in the
enron.com domain. The emails were then grouped
into several buckets based on the number of emails
from a sender to a recipient.

The results are in Table 5. The first column is
the range of the numbers of emails from a sender
to a recipient, and the last column is the number of
(sender, recipient) pairs where the number of emails
that the sender sent to the recipient is in the range
specified in the first column. The second column is
the total number of formal emails from the senders
to the recipients in those pairs. The third column is
defined similarly, and the 4th column is the rate of
informality. Note that the rates of informality in the
first two rows are about the same; it might be due to
the fact that the Enron corpus contains emails only
in a 3.5-year period. The rate of formality does go
up in the third and fourth rows.

5.3 Relative power: Rank difference

Another factor that could affect the sender’s choice
of formality is the relative difference in power or
rank between sender and recipient. For example, if
a manager sends an email to the CEO of an organi-
zation, the email is more likely to be formal than if
the recipient has a lower rank than the sender.

To investigate this, we started with the emails in
the ISI dataset whose senders are employees appear-
ing in the ISI Enron employee position table and re-
cipients are in the enron.com domain. We grouped
the emails by the sender’s position and calculated
the rate of informality in each group. The results are
in Table 6: the first two columns are the title and
the rank of the positions in Enron; the third column
is the number of employees with that position; the
fourth column is the total number of emails sent by
these employees; the fifth column is the rate of infor-
mality; the last column is the percentage of emails
that contain requests according to our request classi-
fier. It is interesting to see that the rates of informal-
ity and request vary a lot for different positions; for
instance, lawyers are more formal and make more
requests than traders.

Table 6: The set of Enron employees used in the formality
vs. rank study

To study the effect of rank difference on formal-
ity, we used the first six rows in Table 6 as the rel-
ative ranks of the next three rows are not so clearly
defined (Diesner et al., 2005). In total, there are 77
employees with rank 1-6, and we call this set of peo-

ple RankSet. We then extracted from the ISI dataset
only those emails that have exactly one recipient and
both sender and recipient are members of RankSet.
We grouped this small set, 3999 emails in total, ac-
cording to the rank difference (which is defined to
be the rank of the recipient minus the rank of the
sender). The results are in Table 7: the last column is
the number of (sender, recipient) pairs with that rank
difference. For instance, the -2 row indicates that,
among those messages addressed two ranks lower in
the organizational hierarchy, 24.7% are informal.

In general, Table 7 shows a lower rate of informal-
ity when an email is addressed to a recipient of su-
perior rank. For example, the informality rate of an
email addressed to someone 4 or more ranks higher
than the sender (15.6%) is less than half that of an
email addressed to someone 4 or more ranks lower
(31.6%). We do not know what causes the increase
of informality from +1 to +2; nevertheless, from
+2 to +4 (in emails addressing someone 2-4 ranks
higher), there is another decrease in informality rate.

diff is equal to recipient rank minus sender rank.

5.4 Weight of imposition: Requests

According to Brown and Levinson’s model of polite-
ness, the greater weight of an imposition, the greater
the usage of polite speech acts including formality.
In this model, a request is one of the most imposing
speech acts. Therefore, when a request is made, we
would expect a lower rate of informality.

To investigate this, we used the ISI dataset and
the results of our request classifier to determine the

92



rate of informality for request and no-request emails.
Table 8 shows that there is indeed a lower rate of
informality when a request is being made.

No-request 128,958 51,616 28.6%
Total 171,271 61,544 26.4%

5.5 Number of recipients
Another hypothesis we considered is the assumption
that a sender is less likely to be informal when there
are more recipients on an email since he does not
want to broadcast a style which is more personal
and could be perceived as unprofessional. To test
this hypothesis, we started with the ISI dataset and
looked at the subset of emails where an email has at
least one recipient.10 The emails were then grouped
based on the number of recipients in the emails.

Table 9 shows the rate of informality with differ-
ent numbers of recipients. For the most part in these
results, a greater number of recipients results in a
lower rate of informality. For instance, the rate of
informality is nearly cut in half when there are 3 to 5
recipients as opposed to a single recipient. However,
at the upper end of this scale, the rate of informality
rises again slightly. One possible explanation is that
when an email is addressed to a very large number of
recipients, the strategies employed (e.g., the model
of saving face) might differ from those employed in
an email addressed to a small audience.

6 Discussion

In this study, we explored the relation between for-
mality and five factors: (1) personal vs. business,
(2) amount of contact, (3) rank difference, (4) re-
quest, and (5) number of recipients. The experi-
ments show that the general patterns between the
rate of informality and the five factors are consistent
with Brown and Levinson’s model and our intuition;

10Some emails in the ISI dataset do not contain any recipi-
ent information. We suspect that the recipient information has
been somehow removed before the data was released to the pub-
lic. With the at-least-one-recipient requirement, the number of
non-empty emails in the ISI dataset is reduced from 232,815 to
180,757.

for instance, an email tends to be more formal if it
is about business matter, it is sent to someone with
a higher rank, or it contains a request. But the ex-
periments did produce some unexpected results; for
instance, the rate of informality increased slightly
when the number of recipients is more than 10.

There are several possible reasons for the unex-
pected results. One is due to the limitation of our
dataset. For instance, the social interaction between
two people could easily go beyond the 3.5 years cov-
ered by the Enron corpus, and people could choose
other ways of communication besides email. There-
fore, the Enron corpus alone may not be sufficient
to capture the social distance between two people in
the corpus. Another possible reason is that the errors
made by our classifiers could contribute to some of
the unexpected results.

The third possible reason, the one that is most in-
teresting to us, is that there are indeed some inter-
esting phenomena which can explain away the un-
expectedness of the results. For instance, an email
sent to a large number of strangers (e.g., an adver-
tisement sent to a large mailing list) may choose to
use an informal and entertaining style in order to
catch the recipients’ attention. Therefore, a theory
that intends to account for people’s email behavior
may need to distinguish emails sent to a large num-
ber of strangers from those sent to a small group of
friends. The benefit of a study like ours is that it
allows researchers to test a linguistic or social the-
ory on a large data set in a real setting. The study
can either provide supporting evidence for a theory
or reveal certain discrepancies between the predic-
tion made by the theory and the statistics in the real
data, which could lead to revision or refinement of
the theory.

While this case study has concentrated on email

93



communication, it would be interesting to study for-
mality behavior in other communication media such
as Facebook and Twitter. By applying our method-
ology to other media, it would be possible to deter-
mine whether there are other social factors that in-
fluence formality on these media. For example, it
would be useful to determine whether there is a dif-
ference in formality with respect to the number of
’friends’ or ’followers’ that a person has. Similarly,
it would be interesting to examine correlations on
the basis of whether a Facebook profile is config-
ured as ’public’ or ’private’ since the potential view-
ing audience would be reduced in the case of ’pri-
vate’ profiles. Since Facebook also contains profiles
which are associated with both individuals and busi-
nesses, it would be interesting to compare these as
we did with personal and business emails. Finally, it
remains to be seen whether requests could be exam-
ined in these media but other social factors (includ-
ing whether posts related to personal matters, social
causes, or event promotion) could be explored to ex-
amine formality behavior.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We believe that NLP techniques can be used to test
linguistic or social theories. As a case study, we
choose Brown and Levinson’s model of politeness
(1987), which states that three factors are considered
in a decision whether or when to use communication
techniques such as formality. We test the theory on
the Enron email corpus, and our experimental results
are largely consistent with the theory and human in-
tuition.

For future work, we plan to improve the perfor-
mance of our formality and request classifier by
adding additional features such as the ones that look
at the layout and zoning of an email (e.g., greetings
and signoffs). We also plan to apply our methodol-
ogy to other genres of data (e.g., blogs, Facebook,
Twitter) or to test other theories.

Another direction for future work is to explore
what communication techniques such as formality
can reveal about the culture of a particular social net-
work. For instance, among all the positions listed in
the ISI Enron employee position table, lawyers have
the lowest rate of informality (7.0%), compared to
other positions (e.g., 33.1% for traders). This im-

plies that the workplace behavior of lawyers (at least
with respect to emails) is very different from that
of traders. It will be interesting to compare the be-
haviors of people from different occupations or from
different social networks. Furthermore, if we could
define the norm of behavior within a social group,
we could then identify the outliers who might de-
serve special attention for various reasons.
