Abstract
The CoNLL-2013 shared task focuses on
correcting grammatical errors in essays
written by non-native learners of English.
In this paper, we describe the University
of Illinois system that participated in the
shared task. The system consists of five
components and targets five types of com-
mon grammatical mistakes made by En-
glish as Second Language writers. We de-
scribe our underlying approach, which re-
lates to our previous work, and describe
the novel aspects of the system in more de-
tail. Out of 17 participating teams, our sys-
tem is ranked first based on both the orig-
inal annotation and on the revised annota-
tion.

1 Introduction

The task of correcting grammar and usage mis-
takes made by English as a Second Language
(ESL) writers is difficult for several reasons. First,
many of these errors are context-sensitive mistakes
that confuse valid English words and thus can-
not be detected without considering the context
around the word. Second, the relative frequency
of mistakes is quite low: for a given type of mis-
take, an ESL writer will typically make mistakes
in only a small proportion of relevant structures.
For example, determiner mistakes usually occur
in 5% to 10% of noun phrases in various anno-
tated ESL corpora (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a).
Third, an ESL writer may make multiple mistakes
in a single sentence, which may give misleading
local cues for individual classifiers. In the exam-
ple shown in Figure 1, the agreement error on the
verb “tend” interacts with the noun number error
on the word “equipments”.

Therefore , the *equipments/equipment of bio-
metric identification *tend/tends to be in-
expensive .

Figure 1: Representative ESL errors in a sample
sentence from the training data.

The CoNLL-2013 shared task (Ng et al., 2013)
focuses on the following five common mistakes
made by ESL writers:

• article/determiner
• preposition
• noun number
• subject-verb agreement

• verb form

Errors outside this target group are present in the
task corpora, but are not evaluated.

In this paper, we present a system that combines
a set of statistical models, where each model spe-
cializes in correcting one of the errors described
above. Because the individual error types have
different characteristics, we use several different
approaches. The article system builds on the el-
ements of the system described in (Rozovskaya
and Roth, 2010c). The preposition classifier uses
a combined system, building on work described
in (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011) and (Rozovskaya
and Roth, 2010b). The remaining three models are
all Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers trained on the Google
Web 1T 5-gram corpus (henceforth, Google cor-
pus, (Brants and Franz, 2006)).

We first briefly discuss the task (Section 2) and
give the overview of our system (Section 3). We
then describe the error-specific components (Sec-
tions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). The sections describ-
ing individual components quantify their perfor-
mance on splits of the training data. In Section 4,

13



we evaluate the complete system on the training
data using 5-fold cross-validation (hereafter, “5-
fold CV”) and in Section 5 we show the results we
obtained on test.

We close with a discussion focused on error
analysis (Section 6) and our conclusions (Sec-
tion 7).

2 Task Description

The CoNLL-2013 shared task focuses on correct-
ing five types of mistakes that are commonly made
by non-native speakers of English. The train-
ing data released by the task organizers comes
from the NUCLE corpus (Dahlmeier et al., 2013),
which contains essays written by learners of En-
glish as a foreign language and is corrected by
English teachers. The test data for the task con-
sists of an additional set of 50 student essays. Ta-
ble 1 illustrates the mistakes considered in the task
and Table 2 illustrates the distribution of these er-
rors in the released training data and the test data.
We note that the test data contains a much larger
proportion of annotated mistakes. For example,
while only 2.4% of noun phrases in the training
data have determiner errors, in the test data 10%
of noun phrases have mistakes.

Error type Percentage of errors
Training Test

Articles 2.4% 10.0%
Prepositions 2.0% 10.7%
Noun number 1.6% 6.0%
Subject-verb agreement 2.0% 5.2%
Verb form 0.8% 2.5%

Table 2: Statistics on error distribution in train-
ing and test data. Percentage denotes the erro-
neous instances with respect to the total number of
relevant instances in the data. For example, 10%
of noun phrases in the test data have determiner
errors.

Since the task focuses on five error types, only
annotations marking these mistakes were kept.
Note that while the other error annotations were
removed, the errors still remain in the data.

3 System Components

Our system consists of five components that ad-
dress individually article1, preposition, noun verb

1We will use the terms ‘article-’ and ‘determiner errors’
interchangeably: article errors constitute the majority of de-

form and subject-verb agreement errors.
Our article and preposition modules build on the

elements of the systems described in Rozovskaya
and Roth (2010b), Rozovskaya and Roth (2010c)
and Rozovskaya and Roth (2011). The article sys-
tem is trained using the Averaged Perceptron (AP)
algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999), imple-
mented within Learning Based Java (Rizzolo and
Roth, 2010). The AP system is trained using the
inflation method (Rozovskaya et al., 2012). Our
preposition system is a Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) classi-
fier trained on the Google corpus and with prior
parameters adapted to the learner data.

The other modules – those that correct noun and
verb errors – are all NB models trained on the
Google corpus.

All components take as input the corpus doc-
uments preprocessed with a part-of-speech tag-
ger2 and shallow parser3 (Punyakanok and Roth,
2001). Note that the shared task data already
contains comparable pre-processing information,
in addition to other information, including depen-
dency parse and constituency parse, but we chose
to run our own pre-processing tools. The article
module uses the POS and chunker output to gen-
erate some of its features and to generate candi-
dates (likely contexts for missing articles). The
other system components use the pre-processing
tools only as part of candidate generation (e.g., to
identify all nouns in the data for the noun classi-
fier) because these components are trained on the
Google corpus and thus only employ word n-gram
features.

During development, we split the released train-
ing data into five parts. The results in Sections 3.1,
3.2, and 3.3 give performance of 5-fold CV on the
training data. In Section 4 we report the develop-
ment 5-fold CV results of the complete model and
the performance on the test data. Note that the per-
formance reported for the overall task on the test
data in Section 4 reflects the system that makes use
of the entire training corpus. It is also important to
remark that only the determiner system is trained
on the ESL data. The other models are trained on
native data, and the ESL training data is only used
to optimize the decision thresholds of the models.

Error type Examples
Article “It is also important to create *a/∅ better material that can support

*the/∅ buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes.”
Preposition “As the number of people grows, the need *of /for habitable environ-

ment is unquestionably essential.
Noun number Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for

their *citizen/citizens as they tend to get overpopulated.”
Subject-verb agreement “Therefore , the equipments of biometric identification *tend/tends

to be inexpensive.

Verb form
“...countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase
their habitable land and *using/use irrigation..”
“it was not *surprised/surprising to observe an increasing need for a
convenient and cost effective platform.”

Table 1: Example errors. Note that only the errors exemplifying the relevant phenomena are marked
in the table; the sentences may contain other mistakes. Errors marked as verb form include multiple
grammatical phenomena that may characterize verbs.

3.1 Determiners

There are three types of determiner error: omitting
a determiner; choosing an incorrect determiner;
and adding a spurious determiner. Even though
the majority of determiner errors involve article
mistakes, some of these errors involve personal
and possessive pronouns.4 Most of the determiner
errors, however, involve omitting an article (these
make up over 60% in the training data). Similar er-
ror patterns have been observed in other ESL cor-
pora (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a).

Our system focuses on article errors. The sys-
tem first extracts from the data all articles, and all
spaces at the beginning of a noun phrase where an
article is likely to be omitted (Han et al., 2006; Ro-
zovskaya and Roth, 2010c). Then we train a multi-
class classifier with features described in Table 3.
These features were used successfully in previous
tasks in error correction (Rozovskaya et al., 2012;
Rozovskaya et al., 2011).

The original word choice (the source article)
used by the writer is also used as a feature. Since
the errors are sparse, this feature causes the model
to abstain from flagging a mistake, which results
in low recall. To avoid this problem, we adopt the
approach proposed in (Rozovskaya et al., 2012),
the error inflation method, and add artificial arti-
cle errors in the training data based on the error
distribution on the training set. This method pre-
vents the source feature from dominating the con-
text features, and improves the recall of the sys-

4e.g. “Pat apologized to me for not keeping the*/my se-
crets.”

tem.
We experimented with two types of classifiers:

Averaged Perceptron (AP) and an L1-generalized
logistic regression classifier (LR). Since the arti-
cle system is trained on the ESL data, of which
we have a limited amount, we also experimented
with adding a language model (LM) feature to the
LR learner. This feature indicates if the correc-
tion is accepted by a language model trained on
the Google corpus. The performance of each clas-
sifier on 5-fold CV on the training data is shown in
Table 4. The results show that AP performs better
than LR. We observed that adding the LM feature
improves precision but results in lower F1, so we
chose the AP classifier without the LM feature for
our final system.

Model Precision Recall F1
AP (inflation) 0.17 0.31 0.22
AP (inflation+LM) 0.26 0.15 0.19
LR (inflation) 0.17 0.29 0.22
LR (inflation+LM) 0.24 0.21 0.22

Table 4: Article development results Results on 5-fold
CV. AP With Inflation achieves the best development using an
inflation constant of 0.85. AP achieves higher performance
without using the language model feature.

3.2 Prepositions

The most common preposition errors are replace-
ments, i.e., where the author correctly recognized
the need for a preposition, but chose the wrong one
to use.

Table 3: Features used in the article error correction system. wB and wA denote the word immediately before and after
the target, respectively; and pB and pA denote the POS tag before and after the target. headWord denotes the head of the NP
complement. NC stands for noun compound and is active if second to last word in the NP is tagged as a noun. Verb features are
active if the NP is the direct object of a verb. Preposition features are active if the NP is immediately preceded by a preposition.
adj feature is active if the first word (or the second word preceded by an adverb) in the NP is an adjective. npWords and npTags
denote all words (POS tags) in the NP.

3.2.1 Preposition Features

All features used in the preposition module are
lexical: word n-grams in the 4-word window
around the target preposition. The NB-priors clas-
sifier, which is part of our model, can only make
use of the word n-gram features; it uses n-gram
features of lengths 3, 4, and 5. Note that since the
NB model is trained on the Google corpus, the an-
notated ESL training data is used only to replace
the prior parameters of the model (see Rozovskaya
and Roth, 2011 for more details).

3.2.2 Training the Preposition System

Correcting preposition errors requires more data
to achieve performance comparable to article er-
ror correction due to the task complexity (Gamon,
2010). We found that training an AP model on
the ESL training data with more sophisticated fea-
tures is not as effective as training on a native En-
glish dataset of larger size. The ESL training data
contains slightly over 100K preposition examples,
which is several orders of magnitude smaller than
the Google n-gram corpus. We use the shared
task training data to replace the prior parameters
of the model (see Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011 for
more details). The NB-priors model does not tar-
get preposition omissions and insertions: it cor-
rects only preposition replacements that involve
the 12 most common English prepositions. The
task includes mistakes that cover 36 prepositions
but we found that the model performance drops
once the confusion set becomes too large. Table
5 shows the performance of the system on the 5-
fold CV on the training data, where each time the
classifier was trained on 80% of the documents.

Model Precision Recall F1
NB-priors 0.14 0.14 0.14

Table 5: Preposition results: NB with priors. Results on
5-fold CV. The model is trained on the Google corpus.

3.3 Correcting Nouns and Verbs

The three remaining types of errors – noun num-
ber errors, subject-verb agreement, and the various
verb form mistakes – are corrected using separate
NB models also trained on the Google corpus. We
focus here on the selection of candidates for cor-
rection, as this strongly affects performance.

3.3.1 Candidate Selection
This stage selects the set of words that are pre-
sented as input to the classifier. This is a crucial
step because it limits the performance of any sys-
tem: those errors that are missed at this stage have
no chance of being detected by the later stages.
This is also a challenging step as the class of
verbs and nouns is open, with many English verbs
and nouns being compatible with multiple parts of
speech. This problem does not arise in preposi-
tion and article error correction, where candidates
are determined by surface form (i.e. can be deter-
mined using a closed list of prepositions or arti-
cles).

We use the POS tag and the shallow parser out-
put to identify the set of candidates that are input
to the classifiers. In particular, for nouns, we col-
lect all words tagged as NN or NNS. Since pre-
processing tools are known to make more mis-
takes on ESL data than on native data, this pro-
cedure does not have a perfect result on the iden-
tification of all noun mistakes. For example, we

16



miss about 10% of noun errors due to POS/shallow
parser errors. For verbs, we compared several
candidate selection methods. Method (1) ex-
tracts all verbs heading a verb phrase, as iden-
tified by the shallow parser. Method (2) ex-
pands this set to words tagged with one of the
verb POS tags {VB,VBN,VBG,VBD,VBP,VBZ}.
However, generating candidates by selecting only
those tagged as verbs is not good enough, since the
POS tagger performance on ESL data is known to
be suboptimal (Nagata et al., 2011), especially for
verbs containing errors. For example, verbs lack-
ing agreement markers are likely to be mistagged
as nouns (Lee and Seneff, 2008). Erroneous verbs
are exactly the cases that we wish to include.
Method (3) adds words that are in the lemma list of
common English verbs compiled using the Giga-
word corpus. The last method has the highest re-
call on the candidate identification; it misses only
5% of verb errors, and also has better performance
in the complete model. We thus use this method.

3.3.2 Noun-Verb Correction Performance
Table 6 shows the performance of the systems
based on 5-fold CV on the training data. Each
model is trained individually on the Google cor-
pus, and is individually processed to optimize the
respective thresholds.

Model Precision Recall F1
Noun number 0.17 0.38 0.23
Subject-verb agr. 0.19 0.24 0.21
Verb form 0.07 0.20 0.10

Table 6: Noun, subject-verb agreement and
verb form results. Results on 5-fold CV. The
models are trained on the Google corpus.

4 Combined Model

In the previous sections, we described the individ-
ual components of the system developed to target
specific error types. The combined model includes
all of these modules, which are each applied to
examples individually: there is no pipeline, and
the individual predictions of the modules are then
pooled.

The combined system also includes a post-
processing step where we remove certain correc-
tions of noun and verb forms that we found oc-
cur quite often but are never correct. This hap-
pens when both choices – the writer’s selection

and the correction – are valid but the latter is ob-
served more frequently in the native training data.
For example, the phrase “developing country” is
changed to “developed country” even though both
are legitimate English expressions. If a correction
is frequently proposed but always results in a false
alarm, we add it to a list of changes that is ignored
when we generate the system output. When we
generate the output on Test set, 8 unique pairs of
such changes are ignored (36 pairs of changes in
total).

We now show the combined results on the train-
ing data by conducting 5-fold CV, where we add
one component at a time. Table 8 shows that the
recall and the F1 scores improve when each com-
ponent is added to the system. The final system
achieves an F1 score of 0.21 on the training data
in 5-fold CV.

+Prepositions 0.16 0.14 0.15

+Verb form (All) 0.18 0.27 0.21

Table 7: Results on 5-fold CV on the training
data. The article model is trained on the ESL
data using AP. The other models are trained on the
Google corpus. The last line shows the results,
when all of the five modules are included.

5 Test Results

The previous section showed the performance of
the system on the training data. In this section,
we show the results on the test set. As previously,
the performance improves when each component
is added into the final system. However, we also
note that the precision is much higher while the
recall is only slightly lower. We attribute this in-
creased precision to the observed differences in
the percentage of annotated errors in training vs.
test (see Section 3) and hypothesize that the train-
ing data may contain additional relevant errors that
were not included in the annotation.

Besides the original official annotations an-
nounced by the organizers, another set of anno-
tations is offered based on the combination of re-
vised official annotations and accepted alternative
annotations proposed by participants. We show in
Table 8 when our system is scored based on the

17



revised annotations, both the precision and the re-
call are higher. Our system achieves the highest
scores out of 17 participating teams based on both
the original and revised annotations.

6 Discussion and Error Analysis

Here, we present some interesting errors that our
system makes.

6.1 Error Analysis

Incorrect verb form correction: Safety is one of
the crucial problems that many countries and com-
panies *concerned/concerns.

Here, the phrasing requires multiple changes;
to maintain the same word order, this correction
would be needed in tandem with the insertion of
the auxiliary “have” to create a passive construc-
tion.

Incorrect determiner insertion: In this era,
Engineering designs can help to provide more
habitable accommodation by designing a stronger
material so it’s possible to create a taller and safer
building, a better and efficient sanitation system
to prevent *∅/ the disease, and also by designing
a way to change the condition of the inhabitable
environment.

This example requires a model of discourse at
the level of recognizing when a specific disease
is a focus of the text, rather than disease in gen-
eral. The use of a singular construction “a taller
and safer building” in this context is somewhat un-
conventional and potentially makes this distinction
even harder to detect.

Incorrect verb number correction:

One current human *need/needs that should
be given priority is the search for renewable re-
sources.

This appears to be the result of the system
heuristics intended to mitigate POS tagging errors
on ESL text, where the word “need” is considered
as a candidate verb rather thana noun; this results
in an incorrect change to make the “verb” agree in
number with the phrase “one human”.

Incorrect determiner deletion: This had
shown that the engineering design process is es-
sential in solving problems and it ensures that the
problem is thoroughly looked into and ensure that
the engineers are generating ideas that target the
main problem, *the/∅ depletion and harmful fuel.

In this example, local context may suggest a list
structure, but the wider context indicates that the
comma represents an appositive structure.

6.2 Discussion

Note that the presence of multiple errors can have
very negative effects on preprocessing. For exam-
ple, when an incorrect verb form is used that re-
sults in a word form commonly used as a noun,
the outputs of the parsers tend to be incorrect. This
limits the potential of rule-based approaches.

Machine learning approaches, on the other
hand, require sufficient examples of each error
type to allow robust statistical modeling of contex-
tual features. Given the general sparsity of ESL
errors, together with the additional noise intro-
duced into more sophisticated preprocessing com-
ponents by errors with overlapping contexts, it ap-
pears hard to leverage these more sophisticated
tools to generate features for machine learning ap-
proaches. This motivates our use of just POS and
shallow parse analysis, together with language-
modeling approaches that can use counts derived
from very large native corpora, to provide robust
inputs for machine learning algorithms.

The interaction between errors suggests that
constraints could be used to improve results by en-
suring, for example, that verb number, noun num-
ber, and noun phrase determiner are consistent.
This is more difficult than it may first appear for
two reasons. First, the noun that is the subject
of the verb under consideration may be relatively
distant in the sentence (due to the presence of in-
tervening relative clauses, for example). Second,
the constraint only limits the possible correction
options: the correct number for the noun in fo-

18



cus may depend on the form used in the preceding
sentences – for example, to distinguish between a
general statement about some type of entity, and a
statement about a specific entity.

These observations suggest that achieving very
high performance in the task of grammar correc-
tion requires sophisticated modeling of deep struc-
ture in natural language documents.

7 Conclusion

We have described our system that participated in
the shared task on grammatical error correction
and ranked first out of 17 participating teams. We
built specialized models for the five types of mis-
takes that are the focus of the competition. We
have also presented error analysis of the system
output and discussed possible directions for future
work.
