 Abstract 

We present a novel segmentation approach for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation 
(PB-SMT) to languages where word boundaries are not obviously marked by using both 
monolingual and bilingual information and demonstrate that (1) unsegmented corpus is able to 
provide the nearly identical result compares to manually segmented corpus in PB-SMT task 
when a good heuristic character clustering algorithm is applied on it, (2) the performance of 
PB-SMT task has significantly increased when bilingual information are used on top of 
monolingual segmented result. Our technique, instead of focusing on word separation, mainly 
concentrate on character clustering. First, we cluster each character from the unsegmented 
monolingual corpus by employing character co-occurrence statistics and orthographic insight. 
Secondly, we enhance the segmented result by incorporating the bilingual information which 
are character cluster alignment, co-occurrence frequency and alignment confidence into that 
result. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on PB-SMT task using English-Thai 
language pair and report the best improvement of 8.1% increase in BLEU score. There are two 
main advantages of our approach. First, our method requires less effort on developing the 
corpus and can be applied to unsegmented corpus or poor-quality manually segmented corpus. 
Second, this technique does not only limited to specific language pair but also capable of 
automatically adjust the character cluster boundaries to be suitable for other language pairs.  

1 Introduction 
Nowadays, it is admitted that word segmentation is a crucial part of Statistical Machine Translation 
(SMT) especially in the languages where there are no explicit word boundaries such as Chinese, 
Japanese or Thai. The writing system of these languages allow each word can be written continuously 
with no space appearing between words. Consequently, word ambiguities will arise if word boundary 
has been misplace which finally lead to an incorrect translation. Thus, the effective word segmentator 
is required to disambiguate each word separator before processing another task in SMT. Several word 
segmentators which focusing on word, character [1] or both [2] and [3] have been implemented to 
accomplish this goal.  

In order to retrieve a useful information to segment or cluster the word, most of word 
segmentators are trained on a manually segmented monolingual corpus by using various approaches 
such as dictionary-based, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), support vector machine (SVM) or 
conditional random field (CRF). Although, a number of segementators are able to yield very 
promising results, certain of them might be unsuitable for SMT task due to the influence of 
segmentation scheme [4]. Therefore, instead of solely rely on monolingual corpus, various researches 
make use of either manually segmented [4]  or unsegment1ed bilingual corpus [5] as a guideline 
information to perform a word segmentation task and improve the performance of SMT system.

In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation approach for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine 
Translation (PB-SMT) to languages where word boundaries are not obviously marked by using both 
monolingual and bilingual information on English-Thai language pair and demonstrate that (1) 
unsegmented corpus is able to provide the nearly identical result to manually segmented corpus in PB-
SMT task when the good heuristics character clustering algorithm is applied on it, (2) the performance 
of PB-SMT task has significantly increased when bilingual information are used on top of 
monolingual segmented result. Our technique, instead of focusing on word separation, mainly 
concentrate on character clustering. First, we cluster each character from the unsegmented 
monolingual corpus by employing heuristic algorithm and language insight. Secondly, we enhance the 
segmented result by incorporating the bilingual information which are character cluster (CC) 
alignment, CC co-occurrence frequency and alignment confidence into that result. These two tasks can 
be performed repeatedly. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some information related 
to our work. Section 3 describes the methodology of our approach. Section 4 present the experiments 
setting. Section 5 present the experimental results and empirical analysis. Section 6 and 7 gives a 
conclusion and future work respectively. 

 

2 Related Work 
2.1 Thai Character Clustering  
In Thai writing system, there are no explicit word boundaries as in English, and a single Thai character 
does not have specific meanings like Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Thai characters could be 
consonants, vowels and tone marks and a word can be formed by combining these characters. From 
our observation, we found that the average length of Thai words on BEST2010 corpus (National 
Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand 2010) is 3.855. This makes the search space 
of Thai word segmentation very large. 
To alleviate this issue, the notion of Thai character cluster (TCC), is introduced [1] to reduce the 
search space with predetermined unambiguious constraints for cluster formation. A cluster may not be 
meaningful and has to combine with other consecutive clusters to form a word. Characters in the 
cluster cannot be separated according to the Thai orthographic rules. For example, a vowel and tone 
mark cannot stand alone and a tone marker is always required to be placed next to a previous character 
only. [6] applied TCC to word segmentation technique which yields an interesting result. 
 

2.2 Bilingually Word Segmentation 
Bilingual information has also been shown beneficial for word segmentation. Several methods have 
used the information from bilingual corpora to perform word segmentation. As in [5], it focuses on 
unsegmented bilingual corpus and builds a self-learned dictionary using alignment statistics between 
English and Chinese language pair. On the other hands, [4] is based on the manually segmented 
bilingual corpus and then try to “repack” the word from existing alignment by using alignment 
confidence. Both works evaluated the performance in BLEU metric and reported the promising result 
of PB-SMT task.   
 

3 Methodology 
This paper aim to compare translation quality based on SMT task between the systems trained on 
bilingual corpus that contains both segmented source and target, and on the same bilingual corpus with 
segmented source but unsegmented target. First, we make use of monolingual information by 
employing several character cluster algorithms on unsegmented data. Second, we use bilingual-guided 
alignment information retrieved from alignment extraction process for improving character cluster 
segmentation. Then, we evaluate our performance based on translation accuracy by using BLEU 
metric. We want to prove that (1) the result of PB-SMT task using unsegmented corpus (unsupervised) 

95



is nearly identical result to manually segmented (supervised) data and (2) when bilingual information 
are also applied, the performance of PB-SMT is also improved. 

3.1 Notation 

Given a target 𝑇ℎ𝑎𝑖    sentence 𝑡!
! consisting of 𝐽 clusters   𝑡!,… , 𝑡! , where 𝑡! ≥ 1. If 𝑡! = 1, we 

call 𝑡!as a single character  𝑆. Otherwise, we call is as a character cluster 𝑇 . In addition, given a 
English sentence 𝑒!!  consisting of 𝐼 words   𝑒,… , 𝑒! ,  𝐴!→! denotes a set of English-to-Thai language 
word alignments between 𝑒!!  and  𝑡!

!. In addition, since we concentrate on one-to-many alignments, 
𝐴!→!  , can be rewritten as a set of pairs 𝑎! and 𝑎! =  < 𝑒! , 𝑡! > noting a link between one single 
English word and several Thai characters that are formed to one cluster 𝑇 
	 

3.2 Monolingual Information 
Due to the issue mentioned in section 2.1, we apply character clustering (CC) technique on target text 
in order to reduce the search space. After performing CC, it will yield several character clusters 
𝑇which can be grouped together to obtain a larger unit which approaches the notion of word. 
However, for Thai and Lao, we do not only receive 𝑇 but also 𝑆 which usually has no meaning by 
itself. Moreover, Thai, Burmese and Lao writing rule does not allow 𝑆 to stand alone in most case. 
Thus, we are required to develop various adapted versions of CC by using orthographic insight and 
heuristic algorithm to automatically pack the characters that reside in a pre-defined grammatical word 
list handcrafted by linguists. Then, all of single consonants in Thai Burmese, and Lao are forced to 
group with either left or right cluster due to the Thai writing system. The decision has been made by 
consulting on character co-occurrence statistics (unigram and bigram frequency). 
Eventually, we obtain different character cluster alignments from the system trained on various CC 
approaches which effect to translation quality as shown in section 5.1 

3.3 Bilingually-Guided Alignment Information 
We begin with the sequence of small clusters resulting from previous character clustering process.  
These small clusters can be grouped together in order to form “word” using bilingually-guided 
alignment information. Generally, small consecutive clusters in target side which are aligned to the 
same word in source data should be grouped together. Therefore, this section describes our one-to-
many alignment extraction process.   

For one-to-many alignment, we applied processes similar to those in phrase extraction 
algorithm [7] which is described as follows.  

With English sentence 𝑒!!  and a Thai character cluster  𝑇!, we apply IBM model 1-5 to extract 
word-to-cluster translation probability of source-to-target 𝑃(𝑡|𝑒) and target-to-source  𝑃(𝑒|𝑡). Next, 
the alignment points which have the highest probability are greedily selected from both 𝑃(𝑡|𝑒) and 
𝑃(𝑒|𝑡). Figure 1.a and 1.b show examples of alignment points of source-to-target and target-to-source 
respectively. After that we selected the intersection of alignment pairs from both side. Then, additional 
alignment points are added according to the growing heuristic algorithm (grow additional alignment 
points, [8])

alignment (c) Intersection between (a) and (b).  (d) Result of (c) after applying the growing heuristic algorithm.  
 
Finally, we select consecutive clusters which are aligned to the same English word as candidates. 
From the Figure 1.d, we obtain these candidates (red, สีแดง) and (bicycle, จัก ร ยา น). 

3.4 Character Cluster Repacking  
Although the alignment information obtained from the previous step is very helpful for the PB-SMT 
task, there is still plenty of room to enhance the PB-SMT performance. One way of doing that is by 
using word repacking [4]. However, in this paper, we perform a character cluster repacking (CCR) 
instead of word. The main purpose of repacking technique is to group all small consecutive clusters 
(or word) in target side that frequently align with one word in source data. Repacking approaches uses 
two simple calculations which are a co-occurrence frequency (𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶  (𝑒! ,𝑇!)) and alignment 
confidence (𝐴𝐶(  𝑎!)). (𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶  (𝑒! ,𝑇!)) is the number of times 𝑒! and  𝑇! co-occurr in the bilingual 
corpus [4] [9] and 𝐴𝐶(  𝑎!) is a measure of how often the aligner aligns 𝑒! and  𝑇!  when they co-occur. 
AC is defined as 

 

𝐴𝐶(𝑎!)   =   
𝐶(𝑎!)

𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶  (𝑒! ,𝑇!)
   

 
where 𝐶(𝑎!) denotes the number of alignments suggested by the previous-step word aligner. 

 
Unfortunately, due to the limited memory in our experiment machine, we cannot 

find  𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶  (𝑒! ,𝑇!)) for all possible < 𝑒! ,𝑇! >  pairs. We, therefore, slightly modified the above 
equation by finding 𝐶(𝑎!) first. Secondly, we begin searching  𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶  (𝑒! ,𝑇!)) from all possible 
alignments in  𝑎! instead of finding all occurrences in corpus. By applying this modification, we 
eliminate < 𝑒! ,𝑇! >  pairs that co-occur together but never align to each other by previous-step aligner 
(𝐴𝐶 𝑎!   equals to zero) so as to reduce the search space and complexity in our algorithm. Thirdly, we 
choose 𝑎! with the highest 𝐴𝐶(𝑎!) and repack all character clusters in target side that similar to 𝑇! to 
be a new single cluster unit. This process can be done repeatedly. However, we have run this task less 
than twice since there are few new cluster unit appear after two iterations have passed. The running 
example of this algorithm is described as follows 

 
Suppose previous step aligner (GIZA++) produce two alignments  𝑎! =  < 𝑒!,𝑇!,! > and 𝑎! =  <
𝑒!,𝑇!,!,! >  CCR will find the frequency of each aligment and number of times 𝑒! and  𝑇! co-occurr in 
the bilingual corpus ( 𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶   𝑒!,𝑇!,!  and  𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶   𝑒!,𝑇!,!,!   ). Then, we will have 𝐴𝐶(𝑎!)   score for 
each alignment and the aligment with the highest 𝐴𝐶 will  be selected. The CCR will group these 
cluster ( e.g. 𝑇!,! ) to be a new single cluster unit.

4 Experimental Setting 
4.1 Data 
The bilingual corpus1 we used in our experiment is constructed from several sources and consists of 
multiple domains (e.g news, travel, article, entertainment, computer, etc.). We divided this corpus into 
three sets plus one additional test set as shown below 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 1. Information of bilingual corpus 
 

4.2 Tools and Evaluation 
We evaluate our system in term of translation quality based on phrase-based SMT.  Source 

sentences are sequence of English words while target sentences are sequences of Thai character 
clusters and each cluster size depends on which approach used in the experiment.   

Translation model and language model are train based on the standard phrase-based SMT. 
Alignments of source (English word) and target (Thai Character Cluster) are extracted using GIZA++ 
[8] and the phrase extraction algorithm [7] is applied using Moses SMT package. We apply SRILM 
[10] to train the 3-gram language model of target side. We use the default parameter settings for 
decoding. 

In testing process, we use another two test sets difference to the training data.  Then we compared 
the translation result with the reference in term of BLEU score instead of F-score because of two main 
reasons. First, it is cumbersome to construct a reliable gold standard since their annotation schemes are 
different. Second, there is no strong correlation with SMT translation quality in terms of BLEU score 
[11]. Therefore, we re-segment the reference data (manually segmented) and the translation result data 
based on TCC. Some may concern about using TCC will lead to over estimation (higher than actual) 
due to the BLEU score is design based on word and not based on character. However, we used this 
BLEU score only for comparing translation quality among our experiments. Comparing to other SMT 
system still require running BLEU score based on the same segmentation guideline. 

5 Results and Discussion 
We conducted all experiments on PB-SMT task and reported the performance of PB-SMT system 
based on the BLEU measure. First, we use a method proposed in section 3.2 followed by the approach 
in section 3.3 in order to the receive first translation result set (without CCR). Then, we perform a 
method describe in 3.4 and also follow by approach in section 3.3 in order to receive another 
translation result set (with CCR). Table 1 shows the number of character clusters that are decreasing 
over time when several different character clustering approaches are applied.

Figure 2. The BLEU score of (a) test set no.1 and (b) test set no.2 
 
 

As seen from Table 3, when we apply the enhanced version of TCCs into the data with no CCR, 
BLEU score have gradually increased and almost reached the same level as original in test set #2. 
Furthermore, when CCR have been also deployed on each training dataset, the results of BLEU are 
also rise in the same manner with Without CCR method. There are certain significant points that 
should be noticed. First, CCR method is able to yield maximum of 8.1 % BLEU score increase. 
Second, when we apply the CCR methods and reach at some point, few improvement or minor 
degradation is received as shown in TCC-FN-B without and with CCR result. This is because the 
number of clusters produced by this character clustering algorithm is almost equal to number of words 
in original data as shown in Table 2 and this approach might suffer from the word boundary 
misplacement problem. Third, character clustering that use TCC with orthographic insight and 
heuristic algorithm combined with CCR approach is able to overcome the translation result from 
original data for the first time.  
 

6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we introduce a new approach for performing word segmentation task for SMT. Instead 
of starting with word level, we focus on character cluster level because this approach can perform on 
unsegmented corpus or multiple-guideline manually segmented corpus. First, we apply several 
adapted versions of TCC on unsegmented data. Next, we use a bilingual corpus to find alignment 
information for all < 𝑒! ,𝑇! >    pairs and then employ character cluster repacking method in order to 
form the large cluster of Thai characters.  
 We evaluate our approach on translation task on several sources and different domain corpus 
and report the result in BLEU metric. Our technique demonstrates that (1) we can achieve a 
dramatically improvement of BLUE as of 8.1% when we apply adapted TCC with CCR and (2) it is 
possible to overcome the manually segmented corpus by using TCC with orthographic insight and 
heuristic algorithm character clustering method combined with CCR. The advantage of our approach 
is a reduction in time and effot for construct a billinugal corpus because we are no longer required to 
manually segment all sentences in target side. In addition, our approach is able to cope with larger data 
information (e.g. 1 million sentences pairs) and adaptable to other language pairs (e.g. English-
Chinese, English-Japanese or English-Lao)

7 Future Work 
There are some tasks that can be added into this approaches. Firstly, we can make use of trigram (and 
n-gram) statistics, maximum entropy or conditional random field on heuristic algorithm in adapted 
version of TCC. Secondly, we might report the result from another language pair in order to confirm 
our approach.Thirdly, we can modify CCR process to be able to rerank the alignment confidence by 
using discriminative approach. Lastly, name entity recognition system can be integrated with our 
approach in order to improve the SMT performance.
