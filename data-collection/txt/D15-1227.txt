Abstract

We propose to automatically summarize
student responses to reflection prompts
and introduce a novel summarization algo-
rithm that differs from traditional methods
in several ways. First, since the linguis-
tic units of student inputs range from sin-
gle words to multiple sentences, our sum-
maries are created from extracted phrases
rather than from sentences. Second, the
phrase summarization algorithm ranks the
phrases by the number of students who
semantically mention a phrase in a sum-
mary. Experimental results show that
the proposed phrase summarization ap-
proach achieves significantly better sum-
marization performance on an engineering
course corpus in terms of ROUGE scores
when compared to other summarization
methods, including MEAD, LexRank and
MMR.

1 Introduction

Educational research has demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of reflection prompts (Boud et al., 2013)
to enhance interaction between instructors and stu-
dents (Van den Boom et al., 2004; Menekse et al.,
2011). However, summarizing student responses
to these prompts for large courses (e.g., introduc-
tory STEM, MOOCs) is an onerous task for hu-
mans and poses challenges for existing summa-
rization methods. First, the linguistic units of stu-
dent inputs range from single words to multiple
sentences. Second, we assume that the concepts
(represented as phrases) mentioned by more stu-
dents should get more attention from the instruc-
tor. Based on this assumption, we introduce the
notion of student coverage, defined as the number
of students who semantically mention a particular
phrase. The more student coverage a phrase has,

Reflection prompt:
Describe what was confusing or needed more detail.

Student Responses:
S1: Graphs of attraction/repulsive & interatomic separation
S2: Property related to bond strength
S3: The activity was difficult to comprehend as the text

fuzzing and difficult to read.
S4: Equations with bond strength and Hooke’s law
S5: I didn’t fully understand the concept of thermal

expansion
S6: The activity ( Part III)
S7: Energy vs. distance between atoms graph and what

it tells us
S8: The graphs of attraction and repulsion were confusing

to me...(rest omitted, 53 student responses in total.)

Human Reference Summary:
1) Graphs of attraction/ repulsive & atomic separation [10]
2) Properties and equations with bond strength [7]
3) Coefficient of thermal expansion [6]
4) Activity part III [4]

dent responses and a gold-standard summary. The

the more important it is. To illustrate the new task,
an example is shown in Table. 1.

In this work, we propose a phrase summariza-
tion method that addresses the above challenges.
First, our summaries are created from extracted
phrases rather than from sentences. Phrases are
easy to read and browse like keywords, and fit bet-
ter on small devices when compared to sentences.
For example, including phrases such as “I didn’t
fully understand” (S5) and “were confusing to me”
(S8) in the summary is a waste of space. Second,
we adopt a metric clustering paradigm with a se-
mantic distance to estimate the student coverage
of each phrase in the summary; a semantic metric
allows similar phrases to be grouped together even
if they are in different textual forms. Experimental

results demonstrate the utility of our approach.
Although not the focus of this paper, we have

also built a mobile application called CourseMIR-
ROR1 that utilizes the proposed summarization al-
gorithm (Luo et al., 2015). Fan et al. (2015) report
a preliminary study about the usage of the applica-
tion.

2 Related Work

While summarization systems that extract sen-
tences are dominant, others have published in
“summarization” at other levels besides the sen-
tence. For example, Ueda et al. (2000) de-
veloped an “at-a-glance” summarization method
with handcrafted rules. Recently, keyphrase ex-
traction (Hasan and Ng, 2014; Liu et al., 2009;
Medelyan et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2005) has re-
ceived considerable attention, aiming to select im-
portant phrases from input documents, which is
similar to phrase summarization. In this paper,
we propose a general framework to adapt sentence
summarization to phrase summarization.

Clustering has been used to score sentences and
has shown good improvement in text summariza-
tion (Yang et al., 2012; Li and Li, 2014; Gung
and Kalita, 2012). In this work, we are using a
metric clustering with semantic similarity to esti-
mate the student coverage at a phrase level. Sim-
ilarly, both diversity-based summarization (Car-
bonell and Goldstein, 1998; Zhang et al., 2005;
Zhu et al., 2007) and our proposed method aim to
estimate and maximize student coverage by mini-
mizing redundancy in the output phrases. Differ-
ently, our method performs the redundancy reduc-
tion at a cluster level (a group of phrases) rather
than penalize redundancy with a greedy iterative
procedure sentence by sentence, and not only the
information content is considered, but also the in-
formation source.

3 Data

Our data consists of student responses collected
from 53 undergraduates enrolled in an introduc-
tion to materials science and engineering class.
The students were asked to complete a survey at
the end of each of 25 lectures during a semester,
consisting of three carefully designed reflection

prompts: 1) “Describe what you found most in-
teresting in today’s class.” 2) “Describe what was
confusing or needed more detail.” 3) “Describe
what you learned about how you learn.”

In total, more than 900 responses were collected
for each prompt. Currently, gold-standard sum-
maries of 12 out of 25 lectures are created by the
teaching assistant for that course for each reflec-
tion prompt. The summaries include not only the
important phrases, but also the number of students
who mentioned them (i.e., student coverage). 4
lectures are randomly selected as a development
set and the remaining data used as a test set, yield-
ing 12 sets of development data and 24 sets of
testing data, each with a prompt, the students’ re-
sponses and the gold-standard summary. 2

The statistics of the student responses and the
TA’s summary are shown in Table 2. The phrases
summarized by the TA are significantly shorter
than the student responses (7.1 vs. 9.2, p<0.001).

4 Proposed Method

We formulate our task as a standard extrac-
tive summarization problem. Unlike standard
sentence-level extraction where the input and out-
put are sentences, the input of our task ranges from
words or phrases to full sentences. The output is a
list of important phrases and the summary length
(either # of phrases or words) is no more than L.

The proposed algorithm involves three stages:
candidate phrase extraction, phrase clustering,
and phrase ranking.

4.1 Candidate phrase extraction
We extract noun phrases (NPs) from the input us-
ing a syntax parser from the Senna toolkit (Col-
lobert, 2011), preserving the most important con-

tent from the original responses without losing too
much context information compared to keywords.
For example, “the concept of thermal expansion”
(S5) is extracted as a candidate phrase. Only NPs
are considered because all reflection prompts used
in the task are asking about “what”, and knowl-
edge concepts are usually represented as NPs.3

Due to the noisy data, malformed phrases are
excluded, including single stop words (e.g. “it”,
“I”, “there”, “nothing”) and phrases starting with
a punctuation mark (e.g. “’t”, “+ indexing”).

4.2 Phrase clustering

Although phrases are more meaningful and less
ambiguous compared to keywords, they suffer
from the sparsity problem, especially in our data
set when 89.9% of the phrases appeared only once.
The challenge is the fact that students use different
words for the same meaning (e.g., “bicycle parts”
and “bike elements”).

We use a clustering paradigm with a seman-
tic distance metric to address this issue. Among
different clustering algorithms, K-Medoids (Kauf-
man and Rousseeuw, 1987) fits well for our prob-
lem. First, it works with an arbitrary distance
matrix between datapoints. It allows to use pair-
wise semantic similarity-based distance between
phrases, yielding metric clustering. Second, it is
robust to noise and outliers because it minimizes a
sum of pairwise dissimilarities instead of squared
Euclidean distances. It shows better performance
than an LDA-based approach to group students’
short answers for the purpose of semi-automated
grading (Basu et al., 2013). Since K-Medoids
picks a random set of seeds to initialize as the clus-
ter centers (called medoids), the clustering algo-
rithm runs 100 times and the cluster with the min-
imal within-cluster sum of the distances is retained
to reduce random effects.

Distance metric. The semantic similarity is
implemented using SEMILAR (Rus et al., 2013),
using the latent semantic analysis trained on the
Touchstone Applied Science Associates corpus
(Ştefănescu et al., 2014). The distance matrix D
is constructed from the similarity matrix S by ap-
plying the following transformation: D = e−S ,
which is similar to the common heat kernel but
without normalization4.

3In our data, no advantage is observed by including other
constituents like verb and prepositional phrases.

4This is not normalized to the range between 0 and 1 since
we only care about the relative distance.

Number of clusters. For setting the number of
clusters without tuning, we adopted a method from
Wan and Yang (2008), by letting K =

√
V . where

K is the number of clusters and V is the number
of candidate phrases instead of the number of sen-
tences.

4.3 Phrase ranking

In order to estimate the student coverage, phrases
are clustered with the algorithm introduced above.
We assume the phrases in a cluster are semanti-
cally similar to each other and any phrase in a clus-
ter can represent it as a whole. Therefore the cov-
erage of a phrase is assumed to be the same as the
coverage of a cluster, which is a union of the stu-
dents covered by each phrase in the cluster.

To select the most representative phrase in a
cluster, LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), a
graph-based algorithm for computing relative im-
portance of textual units (working for both sen-
tences and phrases), is used to score the extracted
candidate phrases. The top ranked phrase in the
cluster is added to the output summary. This pro-
cess starts from the cluster that has the most es-
timated student coverage and repeats for the next
cluster until the length limit is reached.

Note that when the student coverage is the same
between two clusters, the score of the top-ranked
phrases in the clusters according to LexRank is
used to break the tie: the higher, the better.

5 Experiments

We use the ROUGE evaluation metric (Lin, 2004)
and report R-1 (unigrams), R-2 (bigrams), and R-
SU4 (bigrams with skip distance up to 4 words),
including the recall (R), precision (P) and F-
Measure (F). These scores measure the over-
lap between human-generated summaries and a
machine-generated summary.

We design and compare a number of other
summarization methods to evaluate the proposed
phrase summarization approach.

Keyphrase extraction. Maui (Medelyan et al.,
2009) is selected as the baseline, which is one of
the state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction methods.

Sentence to phrase summarization. Existing
sentence summarization techniques can be used
for phrase summarization by extracting candidate
phrases and treating them as sentences. Within
this framework, we adapt MEAD (Radev et al.,
2004) and LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) to

our task. We also include the original MEAD5 for
comparison (named as OriMEAD).

Diversity-based summarization. We ap-
plied the MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein,
1998), a popular diversity-based summa-
rization method as a post-processing step to
the MEAD (MEAD+MMR) and LexRank
(LexRank+MMR) baselines.6

Clustering+Medoid. To show the performance
using the clustering alone, this baseline selects the
medoid phrase instead of using LexRank to rank
the phrases in a cluster to form the summary.

Results. The performance on the test set is
shown in Table 3 with the length limit L as 4
phrases (the average phrase number in the TA’s
summary). Similar results can be observed when
the length limit is based on the number of words,
but cannot be reported here due to page limit.

First, our proposed method (last row), which
clusters the extracted phrases and uses LexRank to
score them, can outperform all the baselines over
all three ROUGE scores in terms of F-measure.
In addition, the proposed model performs better
than the clustering and LexRank alone. Through
a paired t-test, our model outperforms LexRank
statistically in terms of precision for all three
ROUGE scores and significantly improves Clus-
tering+Medoid on all R-2 scores (except the pre-
cision with 0.06 p-value). We believe that the
semantic similarity based clustering complements
LexRank in two ways: 1) LexRank depends on

5The default Length parameter in MEAD is changed to 1
from its default value 9 and the position feature is removed,
yielding better performance.

mized with a grid search on the development data set.

the cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors to build
the graph while the clustering takes semantic sim-
ilarity into account. 2) The clustering performed
a global selection to form a summary by group-
ing similar phrases and ranking them by the num-
ber of covered students (similar to what the hu-
man did). Compared to LexRank, our approach
captures the student coverage explicitly. While
modifying LexRank by using semantic similarity
is possible, estimating the student coverage is not
straightforward.

Second, OriMEAD tends to select long sen-
tences, resulting in a high recall but a low preci-
sion. The phrase version (MEAD) improves both
the P and F scores by removing unnecessary parts
in the original sentences.

Lastly, the proposed method outperforms the
MMR based baselines on the precision and F-
measure of all three ROUGE scores. We observed
that the MMR baselines suffer from the issue of di-
verse expressions used the students (e.g., “graphs”
and “charts”).

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel application to
summarize student feedback to reflection prompts
by a combination of phrase extraction, phrase
clustering and phrase ranking. It makes use of
metric clustering to rank the phrases by their
student coverage, taking the information source
into account. Experimental results demonstrate
the good effectiveness of the model. While
the proposed method improved the performance
against MMR, other summarization methods with-
out an additional MMR component do exist, in-

1958



cluding SumBasic (Vanderwende et al., 2007),
KLSUM and TopicSUM (Haghighi and Vander-
wende, 2009). An initial experiment shows they
do not yield better performance with default pa-
rameters. However, we will revisit it since these
methods are meant for full sentences and are not
optimized within the phrase framework.

In the future, we plan to have additional an-
notation to evaluate the relative importance us-
ing the student coverage numbers. We also de-
ployed CourseMIRROR in a statistics class in
Spring 2015 and have created gold-standard sum-
maries, which will allow us to both replicate the
intrinsic evaluation of this paper with a new and
larger dataset as well conduct an extrinsic evalua-
tion beyond ROUGE scores. Finally, we are inter-
ested in applying our summarization approach to
other types of user-generated content from mobile-
applications (e.g., review comments).
