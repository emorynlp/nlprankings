Abstract

Recent human evaluation of machine
translation has focused on relative pref-
erence judgments of translation quality,
making it difficult to track longitudinal im-
provements over time. We carry out a
large-scale crowd-sourcing experiment to
estimate the degree to which state-of-the-
art performance in machine translation has
increased over the past five years. To fa-
cilitate longitudinal evaluation, we move
away from relative preference judgments
and instead ask human judges to provide
direct estimates of the quality of individ-
ual translations in isolation from alternate
outputs. For seven European language
pairs, our evaluation estimates an aver-
age 10-point improvement to state-of-the-
art machine translation between 2007 and
2012, with Czech-to-English translation
standing out as the language pair achiev-
ing most substantial gains. Our method
of human evaluation offers an economi-
cally feasible and robust means of per-
forming ongoing longitudinal evaluation
of machine translation.

1 Introduction

Human evaluation provides the foundation for em-
pirical machine translation (MT), whether human
judges are employed directly to evaluate system
output, or via the use of automatic metrics –
validated through correlation with human judg-
ments. Achieving consistent human evaluation
is not easy, however. Annual evaluation cam-
paigns conduct large-scale human assessment but
report ever-decreasing levels of judge consistency
– when given the same pair of translations to
repeat-assess, even expert human judges will wor-
ryingly often contradict both the preference judg-

ment of other judges and their own earlier prefer-
ence (Bojar et al., 2013). For this reason, human
evaluation has been targeted within the commu-
nity as an area in need of attention, with increased
efforts to develop more reliable methodologies.

One standard platform for human evaluation is
WMT shared tasks, where assessments have (since
2007) taken the form of ranking five alternate sys-
tem outputs from best to worst (Bojar et al., 2013).
This method has been shown to produce more con-
sistent judgments compared to fluency and ade-
quacy judgments on a five-point scale (Callison-
Burch et al., 2007). However, relative preference
judgments have been criticized for being a sim-
plification of the real differences between trans-
lations, not sufficiently taking into account the
large number of different types of errors of vary-
ing severity that occur in translations (Birch et al.,
2013). Relative preference judgments do not take
into account the degree to which one translation is
better than another – there is no way of knowing if
a winning system produces far better translations
than all other systems, or if that system would have
ranked lower if the severity of its inferior transla-
tion outputs were taken into account.

Rather than directly aiming to increase human
judge consistency, some methods instead increase
the number of reference translations available to
automatic metrics. HTER (Snover et al., 2006)
employs humans to post-edit each system out-
put, creating individual human-targeted reference
translations which are then used as the basis for
computing the translation error rate. HyTER, on
the other hand, is a tool that facilitates creation
of very large numbers of reference translations
(Dreyer and Marcu, 2012). Although both ap-
proaches increase fairness compared to automatic
metrics that use a single generic reference transla-
tion, even human post-editors will inevitably vary
in the way they post-edit translations, and the pro-
cess of creating even a single new reference trans-

443



lation for each system output is often too resource-
intensive to be used in practice.

With each method of human evaluation, a trade-
off exists between annotation time and the number
of judgments collected. At one end of the spec-
trum, the WMT human evaluation collects large
numbers of quick judgments (approximately 3.5
minutes per screen, or 20 seconds per label) (Bojar
et al., 2013).1 In contrast, HMEANT (Lo and Wu,
2011) uses a more time-consuming fine-grained
semantic-role labeling analysis at a rate of approx-
imately 10 sentences per hour (Birch et al., 2013).
But even with this detailed evaluation methodol-
ogy, human judges are inconsistent (Birch et al.,
2013).

Although the trend appears to be toward more
fine-grained human evaluation of MT output, it
remains to be shown that this approach leads to
more reliable system rankings – with a main rea-
son to doubt this being that far fewer judgments
will inevitably be possible. We take a counter-
approach and aim to maintain the speed by which
assessments are collected in shared task evalua-
tions, but modify the evaluation set-up in two main
ways: (1) we structure the judgments as monolin-
gual tasks, reducing the cognitive load involved
in assessing translation quality; and (2) we ap-
ply judge-intrinsic quality control and score stan-
dardization, to minimize noise introduced when
crowd-sourcing is used to leverage numbers of as-
sessments and to allow for the fact that human
judges will vary in the way they assess transla-
tions. Assessors are regarded as reliable as long
as they demonstrate consistent judgments across a
range of different quality translations.

We elicit direct estimates of quality from
judges, as a quantitative estimate of the magni-
tude of each attribute of interest (Steiner and Nor-
man, 1989). Since we no longer look for rela-
tive preference judgments, we revert back to the
original fluency and adequacy criteria last used in
WMT 2007 shared task evaluation. Instead of five-
point fluency/adequacy scales, however, we use
a (100-point) continuous rating scale, as this fa-
cilitates more sophisticated statistical analyses of
score distributions for judges, including worker-
intrinsic quality control for crowd-sourcing. The
latter does not depend on agreement with ex-
perts, and is made possible by the reduction in

labels, with approximately one screen of five pairwise com-
parisons each yielding a set of 10 labels.

information-loss when a continuous scale is used.
In addition, translations are assessed in isolation
from alternate system outputs, so that judgments
collected are no longer relative to a set of five
translations. This has the added advantage of elim-
inating the criticism made of WMT evaluations
that systems sometimes gain advantage from luck-
of-the-draw comparison with low quality output,
and vice-versa (Bojar et al., 2011).

Based on our proposed evaluation methodology,
human judges are able to work quickly, on average
spending 18 and 13 seconds per single segment ad-
equacy and fluency judgment, respectively. Addi-
tionally, when sufficiently large volumes of such
judgments are collected, mean scores reveal sig-
nificant differences between systems. Further-
more, since human evaluation takes the form of di-
rect estimates instead of relative preference judg-
ments, our evaluation introduces the possibility
of large-scale longitudinal human evaluation. We
demonstrate the value of longitudinal evaluation
by investigating the improvement made to state-
of-the-art MT over a five year time period (be-
tween 2007 and 2012) using the best participating
WMT shared task system output. Since it is likely
that the test data used for shared tasks has varied
in difficulty over this time period, we additionally
propose a simple mechanism for scaling system
scores relative to task difficulty.

Using the proposed methodology for measur-
ing longitudinal change in MT, we conclude that,
for the seven European language pairs we evalu-
ate, MT has made an average 10% improvement
over the past 5 years. Our method uses non-expert
monolingual judges via a crowd-sourcing portal,
with fast turnaround and at relatively modest cost.

2 Monolingual Human Evaluation

There are several reasons why the assessment of
MT quality is difficult. Ideally, each judge should
be a native speaker of the target language, while
at the same time being highly competent in the
source language. Genuinely bilingual people are
rare, however. As a result, judges are often peo-
ple with demonstrated skills in the target language,
and a working knowledge – often self-assessed –
of the source language. Adding to the complexity
is the discipline that is required: the task is cog-
nitively difficult and time-consuming when done
properly. The judge is, in essence, being asked to
decide if the supplied translations are what they

444



would have generated if they were asked to do the
same translation.

The assessment task itself is typically structured
as follows: the source segment (a sentence or
a phrase), plus five alternative translations and a
“reference” translation are displayed. The judge
is then asked to assign a rank order to the five
translations, from best to worst. A set of pairwise
preferences are then inferred, and used to generate
system rankings, without any explicit formation of
stand-alone system “scores”.

This structure introduces the risk that judges
will only compare translations against the refer-
ence translation. Certainly, judges will vary in
the degree they rely on the reference translation,
which will in turn impact on inter-judge inconsis-
tency. For instance, even when expert judges do
assessments, it is possible that they use the ref-
erence translation as a substitute for reading the
source input, or do not read the source input at
all. And if crowd-sourcing is used, can we really
expect high proportions of workers to put the ad-
ditional effort into reading and understanding the
source input when a reference translation (proba-
bly in their native language) is displayed? In re-
sponse to this potential variability in how annota-
tors go about the assessment task, we trial assess-
ments of adequacy in which the source input is not
displayed to human judges. We structure assess-
ments as a monolingual task and pose them in such
a way that the focus is on comparing the meaning
of reference translations and system outputs.2

We therefore ask human judges to assess the de-
gree to which the system output conveys the same
meaning as the reference translation. In this way,
we focus the human judge indirectly on the ques-
tion we wish to answer when assessing MT: does
the translation convey the meaning of the source?
The fundamental assumption of this approach is
that the reference translation accurately captures
the meaning of the source; once that assumption
is made, it is clear that the source is not required
during the evaluation.

Benefits of this change are that the task is both
easier to describe to novice judges, and easier
to answer, and that it requires only monolingual
speakers, opening up the evaluation to a vastly
larger pool of genuinely qualified workers.

With this set-up in place for adequacy, we also
2This dimension of the assessment is similar but not iden-

tical to the monolingual adequacy assessment in early NIST
evaluation campaigns (NIST, 2002).

re-introduce a fluency assessment. Fluency rat-
ings can be carried out without the presence of a
reference translation, reducing any remnant bias
towards reference translations in the evaluation
setup. That is, we propose a judgment regime in
which each task is presented as a two-item fluency
and adequacy judgment, evaluated separately, and
with adequacy restructured into a monolingual
“similarity of meaning” task.

When fluency and adequacy were originally
used for human evaluation, each rating used a 5-
point adjective scale (Callison-Burch et al., 2007).
However, adjectival scale labels are problematic
and ratings have been shown to be highly depen-
dent on the exact wording of descriptors (Seymour
et al., 1985). Alexandrov (2010) provides a sum-
mary of the extensive problems associated with the
use of adjectival scale labels, including bias result-
ing from positively- and negatively-worded items
not being true opposites of one another, and items
intended to have neutral intensity in fact proving
to have specific conceptual meanings.

It is often the case, however, that the question
could be restructured so that the rating scale no
longer requires adjectival labels, by posing the
question as a statement such as The text is fluent
English and asking the human assessor to specify
how strongly they agree or disagree with that state-
ment. The scale and labels can then be held con-
stant across experimental set-ups for all attributes
evaluated – meaning that if the scale is still biased
in some way it will be equally so across all set-ups.

3 Assessor Consistency

One way of estimating the quality of a human
evaluation regime is to measure its consistency:
whether or not the same outcome is achieved if
the same question is asked a second time. In
MT, annotator consistency is commonly measured
using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or some variant
thereof (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). Originally de-
veloped as a means of establishing assessor inde-
pendence, it is now commonly used in the reverse
sense, with high numeric values being used as ev-
idence of agreement. Two different measurements
can be made – whether a judge is consistent with
other judgments performed by themselves (intra-
annotator agreement), and whether a judge is con-
sistent with other judges (inter-annotator agree-
ment).

Cohen’s kappa is intended for use with categor-

445



ical judgments, but is also commonly used with
five-point adjectival-scale judgments, where the
set of categories has an explicit ordering. One
particular issue with five-point assessments is that
score standardization cannot be applied. As such,
a judge who assigns two neighboring intervals is
awarded the same “penalty” for being “different”
as the judge who chooses the extremities. The
kappa coefficient cannot be directly applied to
many-valued interval or continuous data.

This raises the question of how we should eval-
uate assessor consistency when a continuous rat-
ing scale is in place. No judge, when given the
same translation to judge twice on a continuous
rating scale, can be expected to give precisely the
same score for each judgment (where repeat as-
sessments are separated by a considerable number
of intervening ones). A more flexible tool is thus
required. We build such a tool by starting with two
core assumptions:

A: When a consistent assessor is presented with
a set of repeat judgments, the mean of the
initial set of assessments will not be signifi-
cantly different from the mean score of repeat
assessments.

B: When a consistent judge is presented with a
set of judgments for translations from two
systems, one of which is known to produce
better translations than the other, the mean
score for the better system will be signifi-
cantly higher than that of the inferior system.

Assumption B is the basis of our quality-control
mechanism, and allows us to distinguish between
Turkers who are working carefully and those who
are merely going through the motions. We use a
100-judgment HIT structure to control same-judge
repeat items and deliberately-degraded system
outputs (bad reference items) used for worker-
intrinsic quality control (Graham et al., 2013).
bad reference translations for fluency judgments
are created as follows: two words in the translation
are randomly selected and randomly re-inserted
elsewhere in the sentence (but not as the initial or
final words of the sentence).

Since adding duplicate words will not degrade
adequacy in the same way, we use an alternate
method to create bad reference items for adequacy
judgments: we randomly delete a short sub-string
of length proportional to the length of the origi-
nal translation to emulate a missing phrase. Since

A 542 283 (52%) 282 (99.6%) 102k 62k (61%)

Table 1: Total quality control filtered workers and
assessments (F = fluency; A = adequacy).

this is effectively a new degradation scheme, we
tested against experts. For low-quality transla-
tions, deleting just two words from a long sentence
often made little difference. The method we even-
tually settled on removes a sequence of k words,
as a function of sentence length n:

2 ≤ n ≤ 3 → k = 1
4 ≤ n ≤ 5 → k = 2
6 ≤ n ≤ 8 → k = 3

9 ≤ n ≤ 15 → k = 4
16 ≤ n ≤ 20 → k = 5

n > 20 → k = ⌈n
5
⌉

To filter out careless workers, scores for
bad reference pairs are extracted, and a
difference-of-means test is used to calculate
a worker-reliability estimate in the form of a
p-value. Paired tests are then employed using the
raw scores for degraded and corresponding system
outputs, using a reliability significance threshold
of p < 0.05. If a worker does not demonstrate
the ability to reliably distinguish between a bad
system and a better one, the judgments from
that worker are discarded. This methodology
means that careless workers who habitually rate
translations either high or low will be detected,
as well as (with high probability) those that click
(perhaps via robots) randomly. It also has the
advantage of not filtering out workers who are
internally consistent but whose scores happen not
to correspond particularly well to a set of expert
assessments.

Having filtered out users who are unable to reli-
ably distinguish between better and worse sets of
translations (p ≥ 0.05), we can now examine how
well Assumption A holds for the remaining users,
i.e. the extent to which workers apply consistent
scores to repeated translations. We compute mean
scores for the initial and repeat items and look for
even very small differences in the two distribu-
tions for each worker. Table 1 shows numbers of
workers who passed quality control, and also that

the vast majority (around 99%) of reliable work-
ers have no significant difference between mean
scores for repeat items.

4 Five Years of Machine Translation

To estimate the improvement in MT that took
place between 2007 and 2012, we asked work-
ers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to rate
the quality of translations produced by the best-
reported participating system for each of WMT
2007 and WMT 2012 (Callison-Burch et al., 2007;
Callison-Burch et al., 2012). Since it is likely that
the test set has changed in difficulty over this time
period, we also include in the evaluation the orig-
inal test data for 2007 and 2012, translated by a
single current MT system. We use the latter to cal-
ibrate the results for test set difficulty, by calcu-
lating the average difference in rating, ∆, between
the 2007 and 2012 test sets. This is then added
to the difference in rating for the best-reported
systems in 2012 and 2007, to arrive at an over-
all evaluation of the 5-year gain in MT quality for
a given language pair, separately for fluency and
adequacy.

Experiments were carried out for each of Ger-
man, French and Spanish into and out of English,
and also for Czech-to-English. English-to-Czech
was omitted because of a low response rate on
MTurk. For language pairs where two systems tied
for first place in the shared task, a random selec-
tion of translations from both systems was made.

HIT structure
To facilitate quality control, we construct each
HIT on MTurk as an assessment of 100 trans-
lations. Each individual translation is rated in
isolation from other translations with workers re-
quired to iterate through 100 translations without
the opportunity to revisit earlier assessments. A
100-translation HIT contains the following items:

70 randomly selected system outputs made up of
roughly equal proportions of translations for each
evaluated system, 10 bad reference translations
(each based on one of the 70 system outputs), 10
exact repeats and 10 reference translations. We di-
vide a 100-translation HIT into 10 sets of 10 trans-
lations. Table 2 shows how the content of each set
is determined. Translations are then randomized
only within each set (of 10 translations), with the
original sequence order of the sets preserved. In
this way, the order of quality control items is un-
predictable but controlled so pairs are separated by
a minimum of 40 intervening assessments (4 sets
of translations). The HIT structure results in 80%
of assessed translations corresponding to genuine
outputs of a system (including exact repeat assess-
ments), which is ultimately what we wish to ob-
tain, with 20% of assessments belonging to quality
control items (bad reference or reference transla-
tions).

Assessment set-up
Separate HITs were provided for evaluation of flu-
ency and adequacy. For fluency, a single system
output was displayed per screen, with a worker re-
quired to rate the fluency of a translation on a 100-
point visual analog scale with no displayed point
scores. A similar set-up was used for adequacy but
with the addition of a reference translation (dis-
played in gray font to distinguish it from the sys-
tem output being assessed). The Likert-type state-
ment that framed the judgment was Read the text
below and rate it by how much you agree that:

• [for fluency] the text is fluent English
• [for adequacy] the black text adequately ex-

presses the meaning of the gray text.

In neither case was the source language string pro-
vided to the workers.

Tasks were published on MTurk, with no re-
gion restriction but the stipulation that only na-
tive speakers of the target language should com-
plete HITs, and with a qualification of an MTurk
prior HIT-approval rate of at least 95%. Instruc-
tions were always presented in the target language.
Workers were paid US$0.50 per fluency HIT, and
US$0.60 per adequacy HIT.3

3Since insufficient assessments were collected for French
and German evaluations in the initial run, a second and ulti-
mately third set of HITs were needed for these languages with
increased payment per HIT of US$1.0 per 100-judgment ade-
quacy HIT, US$0.65 per 100-judgment fluency HIT and later
again to US$1.00 per 100-judgment fluency HIT.

447



Close to one thousand individual Turkers con-
tributed to this experiment (some did both flu-
ency and adequacy assessments), providing a to-
tal of more than 220,000 translations, of which
140,000 were provided by workers meeting the
quality threshold.

In general, it cost approximately US$30 to as-
sess each system, with low-quality workers ap-
proximately doubling the cost of the annotation.
We rejected HITs where it was clear that random-
clicking had taken place, but did not reject solely
on the basis of having not met the quality control
threshold, to avoid penalizing well-intentioned but
low-quality workers.

Overall change in performance
Table 3 shows the overall gain made in five years,
from WMT 07 to WMT 12. Mean scores for the
two top-performing systems from each shared task
(BEST07, BEST12) are included, as well as scores
for the benchmark current MT system on the two
test sets (CURR07, CURR12). For each language
pair, a 100-translation HIT was constructed by
randomly selecting translations from the pool of
(3003+2007)×2 that were available, and this re-
sults in apparently fewer assessments for the 2007
test set. In fact, numbers of evaluated translations
are relative to the size of each test set. Average z
scores for each system are also presented, based on
the mean and standard deviation of all assessments
provided by an individual worker, with positive
values representing deviations above the mean of
workers. In addition, we include mean BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2001) and METEOR (Banerjee and
Lavie, 2005) automatic scores for the same system
outputs.

The CURR benchmark shows fluency scores
that are 5.9 points higher on the 2007 data set than
they are on the 2012 test data, with a larger dif-
ference in adequacy of 8.3 points. As such, the
2012 test data is more challenging than the 2007
test data. Despite this, both fluency and adequacy
scores for the best system in 2012 have increased
by 4.5 and 2.0 points respectively, amounting to
estimated average gains of 10.4 points in fluency
and 10.3 points in adequacy for state-of-the-art
MT across the seven language pairs.

Looking at the standardized scores, it is appar-
ent that the presence of the CURR translations for
the 2007 test set pushes the mean score for the
2007 best systems below zero. The presence in
the HITs of reference translations also shifts stan-

dardized system evaluations below zero, because
they are not attributable to any of the systems be-
ing assessed.4

Results for automatic metrics lead to similar
conclusions: that the test set has indeed increased
in difficulty; and that, in spite of this, substantial
improvements have been made according to auto-
matic metrics, +13.5 using BLEU, and +7.1 on
average using METEOR.

Language pairs
Table 4 shows mean fluency and adequacy scores
by language pair for translation into English. Rel-
ative gains in both adequacy and fluency for the to-
English language pairs are in agreement with the
estimates generated through the use of the two au-
tomatic metrics. Most notably, Czech-to-English
translation appears to have made substantial gains
across the board, achieving more than double the
gain made by some of the other language pairs; re-
sults for best participating 2007 systems show that
this may in part be caused by the fact that Czech-
to-English translation had a lower 2007 baseline
to begin with (BEST07 F:40.8; A:41.7) in compar-
ison to, for example, Spanish-to-English transla-
tion (BEST07 F:56.7; A:59.0).

Another notable result is that although the test
data for each year’s shared task is parallel across
five languages, test set difficulty increases by dif-
ferent degrees according to human judges and au-
tomatic metrics, with BLEU scores showing sub-
stantial divergence across the to-English language
pairs. Comparing BLEU scores achieved by the
benchmark system for Spanish to English and
Czech-to-English, for example, the benchmark
system achieves close scores on the 2007 test data
with a difference of only |52.3 − 51.2| = 1.1,
compared to the score difference for the bench-
mark scores for translation of the 2012 test data of
|25.0 − 38.3| = 13.3. This may indicate that the
increase in test set difficulty that has taken place
over the years has made the shared task dispro-
portionately more difficult for some language pairs
than for others. It does seem that some language
pairs are harder to translate than others, and the
differential change may be a consequence of the
fact that increasing test set complexity for all lan-
guages in parallel has a greater impact on transla-
tion difficulty for language pairs that are intrinsi-
cally harder to translate between.

4Scores for reference translations can optionally be omit-
ted for score standardization.

fluency and 7.4 points for adequacy. English-to-
German translation achieves the lowest gain of
all languages, with apparently no improvement
in fluency, as the human fluency evaluation of
the benchmark system on the supposedly easier
2007 data receives a substantially lower score than
the same system over the 2012 data. This result
demonstrates why fluency, evaluated without a ref-
erence translation, should not be used to evalu-
ate MT systems without an adequacy assessment,
since it is entirely possible for a low-adequacy
translation to achieve a high fluency score.

For all language pairs, Figure 1 plots the net
gain in fluency, adequacy and F1 against increase
in test data difficulty.

5 Conclusion

We carried out a large-scale human evaluation
of best-performing WMT 2007 and 2012 shared
task systems in order to estimate the improvement
made to state-of-the-art machine translation over
this five year time period. Results show significant
improvements have been made in machine trans-
lation of European language pairs, with Czech-
to-English recording the greatest gains. It is also
clear from our data that the difficulty of the task
has risen over the same period, to varying degrees
