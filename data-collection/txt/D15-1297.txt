Abstract 

Cross-domain sentiment classification 

(CSC) aims at learning a sentiment 

classifier for unlabeled data in the target 

domain based on the labeled data from a 

different source domain. Due to the 

differences of data distribution of two 

domains in terms of the raw features, the 

CSC problem is difficult and challenging. 

Previous researches mainly focused on 

concepts mining by clustering words 

across data domains, which ignored the 

importance of authors’ emotion contained 

in data, or the different representations of 

the emotion between domains. In this 

paper, we propose a novel framework to 

solve the CSC problem, by modelling the 

emotion across domains. We first develop 

a probabilistic model named JEAM to 

model author’s emotion state when 

writing. Then, an EM algorithm is 

introduced to solve the likelihood 

maximum problem and to obtain the latent 

emotion distribution of the author. Finally, 

a supervised learning method is utilized to 

assign the sentiment polarity to a given 

online review. Experiments show that our 

approach is effective and outperforms 

state-of-the-art approaches. 

1 Introduction 

Cross-domain sentiment classification (CSC) is 

the task that learns a sentiment classifier for 

unlabeled data in the target domain based on the 

labeled data from the source domain. With the 

increasing amount of opinion information

available on the Internet, CSC has become a hot 

spot in recent years. Traditional machine learning 

algorithms often train a classifier utilizing the 

labeled data for CSC. However, in some practical 

cases, we may have many labeled data for some 

domains (source domains) but very few or no 

labeled data for other domains (target domains). 

Due to the differences of the distribution of two 

domains in terms of raw features, e.g. raw term 

frequency, the classifier trained from the source 

domain often performs badly on the target domain. 

To overcome this issue, several feature-based 

studies have been proposed to improve the 

sentiment classification domain adaptation   

[Zhuang et al., 2013; He et al., 2011; Gao and Li, 

2011; Li et al., 2012; Dai et al., 2007; Zhuang et 

al., 2010; Pan et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Long 

et al., 2012; Lin and He, 2009]. 

 Existing studies build various generative 

models to solve the domain adaptation problems 

for CSC. In most cases, the models are trained by 

using the whole corpora without specifying on the 

sentiment of the texts. For example, [Zhuang et al., 

2013] propose a general framework HIDC to mine 

high-level concepts (e.g. word clusters) across 

various domains. However, their learned concepts 

contain many topics not restricted to the sentiment. 

On the other hand, some researchers focus on the 

usage of the sentiment in CSC study [Mitra et al., 

2013a; Mitra et al., 2013b; He et al., 2011]. [He et 

al., 2011] modify JST model [Lin and He, 2009] 

by incorporating word polarity priors through 

adjusting the topic-word Dirichlet priors. 

However, they fail to consider the expression 

differences among various domains.  

To overcome the above issues, we employ 

“emotion”, for its ubiquity among domains. The 

sentiment words in different domains might vary 

2503



significantly, but the emotion can be effectively 

transferred. For example, when expressing the 

emotion “happiness”, one uses “bravo” in the 

domain of sport, while “yummy” in the domain of 

food. Therefore, we propose an EA framework to 

model the latent emotions which are commonly 

contained in subjective articles and expressed by 

“emotional words”. We infer the sentiment 

polarity of a document based on the emotion state. 

The hierarchy of EA is composed by four layers: 

(1) Sentiment Layer 

Normally, the sentiment of a document is the 

general opinion towards a certain event or object. 

For example, a movie review in IMDB might 

voice the feeling about the movie by a reviewer 

[Yu et al., 2013].  

(2) Emotion Layer 

Based on the emotion classification theories 

in psychology [Plutchik, 2002], the emotion can 

be classified into the basic ones influenced by the 

physiological factors, e.g. happiness, sadness, 

anger, etc., and dozens of complicated ones 

formed under some specific social conditions, e.g. 

shame, guilt, abashment, etc. Additionally, the 

emotion can be classified as positive and negative 

(similar to the sentiment classification) based on 

dimensional models of emotion [Schlosberg, 

1954; Plutchik, 2002; Rubin and Talerico, 2009]. 

Intuitively, we assume that a document tends to 

contain the emotions of similar polarity.  

(3) Lexicon Layer 

To build the connection between words and 

the emotion, we introduce emotional words 

instead of raw word features into our model. By 

utilizing the emotional lexicon MPQA [Wiebe et 

al., 2005], we select groups of strong polar words, 

which get high scores in the emotional lexicon. 

These words are considered highly correlated to 

the certain emotion of the same polarity. And 

these strong polar words have invariant polarity 

across domains. Therefore, the emotion can be 

substantialized by a series of emotional words 

drawn from corresponding probability distribution. 

(4) Expression Layer 

In many practical cases, data come from 

different domains. We suppose that the 

correlation between emotion state and sentiment 

orientation is stable over domains, but one 

emotion may have different expressions when 

domain varies. E.g., “satisfaction” may be 

expressed as “interesting” or “attractive” for a 

book; meanwhile, it may be expressed “efficient” 

for an electronics device. Formally, we have 

𝑝(𝑒|𝑦, 𝑟1) = 𝑝(𝑒|𝑦, 𝑟2) = 𝑝(𝑒|𝑦)     (1) 
𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟1) ≠ 𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟2)         (2) 

where 𝑒  denotes the emotion, y denotes the 
author’s sentiment orientation, 𝑟1  and 𝑟2 
denotes two different domains, and 𝑤𝑒  denotes 
the emotional words.  

 Along this line, we propose the Joint 

Emotion Analysis Model (named JEAM for 

abbreviation) utilizing the probabilistic methods. 

See details in the next section. 

2 Proposed Model 

2.1 Problem Formulation 

The CSC problem can be formulated as follows: 

Suppose we have two sets of data, denoted as 𝐷𝑠 
and 𝐷𝑡, which represent the source domain data 
and the target domain data respectively. In the 

CSC problem, the source domain data consist of 

labeled instances, denoted by  𝐷𝑠 =

{(𝑥𝑖
(𝑠)

, 𝑦𝑖
(𝑠)

)}|𝑖=1
𝑛𝑠 , where 𝑥𝑖

(𝑠)
∈ ℝ𝑘  is an input 

vector, 𝑦𝑖
(𝑠)

∈ {0,1} is the output label, and 𝑛𝑠 

is the number of documents in 𝐷𝑠. Unlike that of 
the source domain, the target domain data consists 

of samples without any label information, denoted 

by 𝐷𝑡 = {𝑥𝑖
(𝑡)

}|𝑖=1
𝑛𝑡 , where 𝑥𝑖

(𝑡)
∈ ℝ𝑘 is an input 

vector, and 𝑛𝑡 is the number of documents in 𝐷𝑡. 
The task of CSC is to leverage the training data of 

source domain 𝐷𝑠  to predict the label 𝑦𝑖
(𝑡)

 

corresponding to input vector 𝑥𝑖
(𝑡)

 of target 

domain 𝐷𝑡.  

2.2 The JEAM Model 

To model the author’s emotion state contained in 

the document, we propose the JEAM model based 

on the probabilistic graphical principle. Note that 

all the factors and edges in JEAM are derived 

from the specific concepts and relations in EA, 

e.g., Eq(1) and Eq(2). We draw the graphical 

representation of JEAM in Figure 1, and show the 

notations of this paper in Table 1. 

In Figure 1, y denotes the sentiment 

orientation of the author, which is a latent variable 

in this model. 𝑒   denotes any emotion (topic) 
generated by y from a conditional 

probability 𝑝(𝑒|𝑦). 𝑒 is also a latent variable in 
this model. 𝑟  denotes any data domain, e.g., 
books, dvd, kitchen, and electronics etc. 𝑑 
denotes any document chosen from domain r with 

label y. For documents from the source domain, 

the conditional probability 𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦) is known, 
which can be used to supervise the modeling 

process. 𝑢 denotes the prior sentiment polarity of 
the corresponding emotional word. In practice, 𝑢 
can be obtained from the emotional lexicon,  

2504

All the latent variables are marked in white, and 

all the observed variables are marked in gray. 

 

Table 1.  Means of Symbols 

 

which classifies a series of words into positive and 

negative categories.  𝑤𝑒 denotes any emotional 
word with polarity u, which is chosen over words 

conditioned on emotion e and domain r from 

conditional probability 𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢) . In this 
paper, we only select emotional words with strong 

sentiment polarities to represent the vector of the 

document. Therefore, we rebuild the data with the 

help of emotional lexicon cutting out the non-

emotional words. As a result, any word chosen 

from the rebuilt data will be an emotional word, 

which is supposed not to change its polarity in 

different domains. Additionally, the joint 

probability over all the observed variables can be 

defined as follows based on the hidden variables: 

𝑝(𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢) = ∑ 𝑝(𝑒, 𝑦, 𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢)𝑒,𝑦   (3) 

Based on the graphical model, we have: 

𝑝(𝑒, 𝑦, 𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢) = 

𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢)𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦)𝑝(𝑒|𝑦)𝑝(𝑟)𝑝(𝑦)𝑝(𝑢) (4) 

We need to learn the unobservable 

probabilities (e.g.,  𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢), 𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦),  
𝑝(𝑒|𝑦), 𝑝(𝑦) ) to infer the hidden emotion 
distribution. Therefore, we develop an 

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to 

maximize the log likelihood of generating the 

whole dataset and obtain the iterative formula in 

E-step as follows: 

𝑝(𝑒, 𝑦|𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢) =  

𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢)𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦)𝑝(𝑒|𝑦)𝑝(𝑟)𝑝(𝑦)𝑝(𝑢)
∑ 𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢)𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦)𝑝(𝑒|𝑦)𝑝(𝑟)𝑝(𝑦)𝑝(𝑢)𝑒,𝑦

 (5) 

where all the factors are calculated in M-step 

similar to PLSA and HIDC (Hoffman, 1999; 

Zhuang et al., 2013). 

2.3 CSC via JEAM 

To use JEAM to solve CSC problems, we adopt 

two optimizations: 

First, we supervise the EM optimization with 

the polarity information of emotional words and 

instances respectively in the source domain. On 

the one hand, we estimate 𝑝(𝑒, 𝑦|𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢) 
utilizing the polarity label of the emotional words.  

Let the emotion set 𝐸 be divided into positive set 
𝐸𝑝  and negative set  𝐸𝑛 . We set 

𝑝(𝑒𝑖 , 𝑦|𝑤𝑒 , 𝑑, 𝑟, 𝑢𝑤𝑒) = 0 during the whole EM 

process when the polarities of the emotion and 

current emotional word are different. On the other 

hand, we estimate the probability 𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦) with 
the label information of instances in the source 

domain. When the document is from the source 

domain, we set 𝑝(𝑑|𝑟, 𝑦) = 0  if  𝑦   is 
different with the ground truth. 

Second, we reconstruct the document as 

follows, 

𝑑∗ = [𝑒1, 𝑒2, … 𝑒𝑚], 𝑒𝑖 = {
    1 +

|𝑊𝑒𝑖
𝑟|

∑ |𝑊𝑒𝑗
𝑟|𝑚𝑗=1

, 𝑖𝑓 𝑊𝑒𝑖
𝑟 ≠ ∅

 
0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠

     (6) 

where [𝑒1, 𝑒2, … 𝑒𝑚]  is the distribution over 
emotions, 𝑊𝑒𝑖

𝑟 = {𝑤𝑒|𝑒𝑤𝑒
𝑟 = 𝑖} , 𝑒𝑤𝑒

𝑟 =

𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑒  𝑝(𝑒|𝑤𝑒 , 𝑟) , and 𝑝(𝑒|𝑤𝑒 , 𝑟)  can be 
computed based on  𝑝(𝑤𝑒|𝑒, 𝑟, 𝑢) , 𝑝(𝑒|𝑦), 𝑝(𝑢) 
and 𝑝(𝑟) obtained after EM algorithm. The main 
function of this step is to process a new given 

document faster, avoiding training JEAM again 

with the new input. Finally, a machine learning 

method Support Vector Machine (SVM) is 

introduced to train a classifier with the labeled 

data from the source domain and assign polarities 

to documents from the target domain based on our 

reconstructed data.  

3 Experiments 

3.1 Experimental Setup 

We demonstrate the effectiveness of JEAM on the 

Multi-Domain sentiment data set [Blitzer et al., 

2007] which contains four types (domains) of 

real-world product documents taken from 

Amazon.com, which are books, dvd, electronics 

and kitchen. We randomly select 1800 documents 

from the one domain (source domain) and 200 

documents from another domain (target domain). 

Then, we train a sentiment classifier using 

documents selected from the source domain and 

𝑒 Emotion 
𝑤𝑒 Emotional word 
𝑟 Domain 
𝑑 Document  
𝑢 Prior sentiment polarity of the emotional word 
𝑦 Sentiment polarity of the document 
𝑋 All the observed variables 
𝜃 All the model parameters 

2505



assign labels to documents selected from the 

target domain, which generates 12 classification 

tasks. We preform 10 random selections and 

report the average results over 10 different runs. 

We use MPQA subjective lexicon 1  as the 

emotional lexicon. In our experiments, only 

strongly subjective clues are considered as 

emotional words, consisting of 1717 positive and 

3621 negative words. We rebuild the dataset by 

cutting out the non-emotional words. For 

experiment parameters, we set 𝑝 = 25, 𝑛 = 25, 
and 𝑇 = 100  after plenty of experiments. 
Considering the data in practice, the sentiment 

orientation y has only two forms, positive or 

negative. Note that we do neither instance 

selection nor complicated feature selection (only 

filter the low-frequency words) to our proposed 

method and other methods in comparison. 

3.2 Experimental Result 

Performance of Emotional Words 
We show the effectiveness of introducing 

emotional words to solve the CSC problem. In 

JEAM, we reconstruct the documents by cutting 

out the non-emotional words. To compare the 

classification accuracy on the original documents 

and the reconstructed (emotional) documents, we 

choose two common classification algorithms, 

linear SVM and PLSA (topic size=10) for 

experiment respectively. The experiment results 

shows that both SVM and PLSA perform better 

on the emotional documents (60.43% and 60.48%) 

than on the original documents (57.73% and 

56.69%) for the average accuracy over 12 

classification tasks.  

Effectiveness of using domain information 
and word polarity 
We show the effectiveness of using domain 

information and word polarity, which are 

employed in our approach. For this purpose, we 

repeat the experiment without introducing domain 

and word polarity (node u and node r) into the 

model. Figure 2 shows the results. As it is clear, 

the highest performance can be achieved when 

domain information and word polarity are both 

used, while the lowest performance is obtained 

when neither of them is used.  

Comparison with the Baselines 

We compare our proposed approach with PLSA, 

SVM, SFA [Pan et al., 2010], JST [He et al., 2011] 

and HIDC [Zhuang et al., 2013]. The 

experimental results of the 12 classification tasks 

are shown in Figure 3. It can be observed that our

proposed approach outperforms all the other 

approaches in general. Note that in order to obtain 

a more precise comparison of the algorithms, we 

do neither the instance selection nor the 

complicated feature selection. The result of our 

proposed approach can possibly be improved with 

the help of these selection strategies. 

4 Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to 

solve the CSC problem, by modelling emotions 

across domains. We deeply analyze the relation 

between the author and the document based on the 

emotion theories in the field of psychology. Along 

this line, we propose a framework named EA, 

which takes the emotions and domains into 

account. Based on EA, we propose a novel model 

named JEAM to model the author’s emotion state 

for Cross-domain sentiment classification. We 

conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to 

evaluate JEAM. The experiment results show that 

emotion plays an important role in CSC and 

JEAM outperforms existing state-of-the-art 

methods on the task of CSC.
