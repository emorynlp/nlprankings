Abstract

We introduce a supervised model
for predicting word importance that
incorporates a rich set of features. Our
model is superior to prior approaches
for identifying words used in human
summaries. Moreover we show
that an extractive summarizer using
these estimates of word importance is
comparable in automatic evaluation with
the state-of-the-art.

1 Introduction

In automatic extractive summarization, sentence
importance is calculated by taking into account,
among possibly other features, the importance
of words that appear in the sentence. In this
paper, we describe experiments on identifying
words from the input that are also included in
human summaries; we call such words summary
keywords. We review several unsupervised
approaches for summary keyword identification
and further combine these, along with features
including position, part-of-speech, subjectivity,
topic categories, context and intrinsic importance,
in a superior supervised model for predicting word
importance.

One of the novel features we develop aims
to determine the intrinsic importance of words.
To this end, we analyze abstract-article pairs in
the New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008)
to identify words that tend to be preserved in
the abstracts. We demonstrate that judging word
importance just based on this criterion leads to
significantly higher performance than selecting
sentences at random. Identifying intrinsically
important words allows us to generate summaries
without doing any feature computation on the
input, equivalent in quality to the standard baseline
of extracting the first 100 words from the latest

article in the input. Finally, we integrate the
schemes for assignment of word importance into
a summarizer which greedily optimizes for the
presence of important words. We show that our
better estimation of word importance leads to
better extractive summaries.

2 Prior work

The idea of identifying words that are descriptive
of the input can be dated back to Luhn’s earliest
work in automatic summarization (Luhn, 1958).
There keywords were identified based on the
number of times they appeared in the input,
and words that appeared most and least often
were excluded. Then the sentences in which
keywords appeared near each other, presumably
better conveying the relationship between the
keywords, were selected to form a summary.

Many successful recent systems also estimate
word importance. The simplest but competitive
way to do this task is to estimate the word
probability from the input (Nenkova and
Vanderwende, 2005). Another powerful method
is log-likelihood ratio test (Lin and Hovy, 2000),
which identifies the set of words that appear in
the input more often than in a background corpus
(Conroy et al., 2006; Harabagiu and Lacatusu,
2005).

In contrast to selecting a set of keywords,
weights are assigned to all words in the input
in the majority of summarization methods.
Approaches based on (approximately) optimizing
the coverage of these words have become widely
popular. Earliest such work relied on TF*IDF
weights (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004),
later approaches included heuristics to identify
summary-worthy bigrams (Riedhammer et al.,
2010). Most optimization approaches, however,
use TF*IDF or word probability in the input as
word weights (McDonald, 2007; Shen and Li,
2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011).

712



Word weights have also been estimated by
supervised approaches, with word probability and
location of occurrence as typical features (Yih et
al., 2007; Takamura and Okumura, 2009; Sipos et
al., 2012).

A handful of investigations have productively
explored the mutually reinforcing relationship
between word and sentence importance, iteratively
re-estimating each in either supervised or
unsupervised framework (Zha, 2002; Wan et
al., 2007; Wei et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2011).
Most existing work directly focuses on predicting
sentence importance, with emphasis on the
formalization of the problem (Kupiec et al., 1995;
Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010; Litvak et al.,
2010). There has been little work directly focused
on predicting keywords from the input that will
appear in human summaries. Also there has been
only a few investigations of suitable features
for estimating word importance and identifying
keywords in summaries; we address this issue by
exploring a range of possible indicators of word
importance in our model.

3 Data and Planned Experiments

We carry out our experiments on two datasets from
the Document Understanding Conference (DUC)
(Over et al., 2007). DUC 2003 is used for training
and development, DUC 2004 is used for testing.
These are the last two years in which generic
summarization was evaluated at DUC workshops.

There are 30 multi-document clusters in DUC
2003 and 50 in DUC 2004, each with about 10
news articles on a related topic. The task is
to produce a 100-word generic summary. Four
human abstractive summaries are available for
each cluster.

We compare different keyword extraction
methods by the F-measure1 they achieve against
the gold-standard summary keywords. We do not
use stemming when calculating these scores.

In our work, keywords for an input are defined
as those words that appear in at least i of the
human abstracts, yielding four gold-standard sets
of keywords, denoted by Gi. |Gi| is thus the
cardinality of the set for the input. We only
consider the words in the summary that also
appear in the original input2, with stopwords

in the four abstracts never appear in the input.

excluded3. Table 1 shows the average number of
unique content words for the respective keyword
gold-standard.

i 1 2 3 4
Mean |Gi| 102 32 15 6

Table 1: Average number of words in Gi

For the summarization task, we compare results
using ROUGE (Lin, 2004). We report ROUGE-1,
-2, -4 recall, with stemming and without removing
stopwords. We consider ROUGE-2 recall as
the main metric for this comparison due to its
effectiveness in comparing machine summaries
(Owczarzak et al., 2012). All of the summaries
were truncated to the first 100 words by ROUGE4.

We use Wilcoxon signed-rank test to examine
the statistical significance as advocated by Rankel
et al. (2011) for both tasks, and consider
differences to be significant if the p-value is less
than 0.05.

4 Unsupervised Word Weighting

In this section we describe three unsupervised
approaches of assigning importance weights to
words. The first two are probability and
log-likelihood ratio, which have been extensively
used in prior work. We also apply a markov
random walk model for keyword ranking, similar
to Mihalcea and Tarau (2004). In the next
section we describe a summarizer that uses these
weights to form a summary and then describe
our regression approach to combine these and
other predictors in order to achieve more accurate
predictions for the word importance in Section 7.

The task is to assign a score to each word in the
input. The keywords extracted are thus the content
words with highest scores.

4.1 Word Probability (Prob)

The frequency with which a word occurs in the
input is often considered as an indicator of its
importance. The weight for a word is computed
as p(w) = c(w)N , where c(w) is the number of
times word w appears in the input and N is the
total number of word tokens in the input.

3We use the stopword list from the SMART system
(Salton, 1971), augmented with punctuation and symbols.

4.2 Log-likelihood Ratio (LLR)

The log-likelihood ratio test (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
compares the distribution of a word in the input
with that in a large background corpus to identify
topic words. We use the Gigaword corpus (Graff et
al., 2007) for background counts. The test statistic
has a χ2 distribution, so a desired confidence level
can be chosen to find a small set of topic words.

4.3 Markov Random Walk Model (MRW)

Graph methods have been successfully applied to
weighting sentences for generic (Wan and Yang,
2008; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Erkan and
Radev, 2004) and query-focused summarization
(Otterbacher et al., 2009).

Here instead of constructing a graph with
sentences as nodes and edges weighted by
sentence similarity, we treat the words as vertices,
similar to Mihalcea and Tarau (2004). The
difference in our approach is that the edges
between the words are defined by syntactic
dependencies rather than depending on the
co-occurrence of words within a window of k. We
use the Stanford dependency parser (Marneffe et
al., 2006). In our approach, we consider a word
w more likely to be included in a human summary
when it is syntactically related to other (important)
words, even if w itself is not mentioned often.
The edge weight between two vertices is equal to
the number of syntactic dependencies of any type
between two words within the same sentence in
the input. The weights are then normalized by
summing up the weights of edges linked to one
node.

We apply the Pagerank algorithm (Lawrence
et al., 1998) on the resulting graph. We set the
probability of performing random jump between
nodes λ=0.15. The algorithm terminates when
the change of node weight between iterations is
smaller than 10−4 for all nodes. Word importance
is equal to the final weight of its corresponding
node in the graph.

5 Summary Generation Process

In this section, we outline how summaries
are generated by a greedy optimization system
which selects the sentence with highest weight
iteratively. This is the main process we use in all
our summarization systems. For comparison we
also use a summarization algorithm based on KL
divergence.

5.1 Greedy Optimization Approach

Our algorithm extracts sentences by weighting
them based on word importance. The approach is
similar to the standard word probability baseline
(Nenkova et al., 2006) but we explore a range
of possibilities for assigning weights to individual
words. For each sentence, we calculate the
sentence weight by summing up the weights of
all words, normalized by the number of words in
the sentence. We sort the sentences in descending
order of their scores into a queue. To create a
summary, we iteratively dequeue one sentence,
check if the sentence is more than 8 words (as
in Erkan and Radev (2004)), then append it to
the current summary if it is non-redundant. A
sentence is considered non-redundant if it is not
similar to any sentences already in the summary,
measured by cosine similarity on binary vector
representations with stopwords excluded. We use
the cut-off of 0.5 for cosine similarity. This value
was tuned on the DUC 2003 dataset, by testing the
impact of the cut-off value on the ROUGE scores
for the final summary. Possible values ranged
from 0.1 to 0.9 with step of 0.1.

5.2 KL Divergence Summarizer

The KLSUM summarizer (Haghighi and
Vanderwende, 2009) aims at minimizing the KL
divergence between the probability distribution
over words estimated from the summary and
the input respectively. This summarizer is a
component of the popular topic model approaches
(Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Celikyilmaz and
Hakkani-Tür, 2011; Mason and Charniak, 2011)
and achieves competitive performance with
minimal differences compared to a full-blown
topic model system.

6 Global Indicators from NYT

Some words evoke topics that are of intrinsic
interest to people. Here we search for global
indicators of word importance regardless of
particular input.

6.1 Global Indicators of Word Importance

We analyze a large corpus of original documents
and corresponding summaries in order to identify
words that consistently get included in or excluded
from the summary. In the 2004-2007 NYT corpus,
many news articles have abstracts along with the
original article, which makes it an appropriate

Table 2: Top 30 words by three metrics from NYT corpus

resource to do such analysis. We identified
160, 001 abstract-original pairs in the corpus.
From these, we generate two language models,
one estimated from the text of all abstracts (LMA),
the other estimated from the corpus of original
articles (LMG). We use SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)
with Ney smoothing.

We denote the probability of word w in LMA as
PrA(w), the probability in LMG as PrG(w), and
calculate the difference PrA(w)−PrG(w) and the
ratio PrA(w)/PrG(w) to capture the change of
probability. In addition, we calculate KL-like
weighted scores for words which reflect both the
change of probabilities between the two samples
and the overall frequency of the word. Here
we calculate both KL(A ∥ G) and KL(G ∥
A). Words with high values for the former score
are favored in the summaries because they have
higher probability in the abstracts than in the
originals and have relatively high probability in
the abstracts. The later score is high for words that
are often not included in summaries.

KL(A ∥ G)(w) = PrA(w) · ln PrA(w)
PrG(w)

KL(G ∥ A)(w) = PrG(w) · ln PrG(w)
PrA(w)

Table 2 shows examples of the global
information captured from the three types
of scores—KL(A ∥ G), KL(G ∥ A) and
PrA(w)—listing the 30 content words with
highest scores for each type. Words that tend to
be used in the summaries, characterized by high
KL(A ∥ G) scores, include locations (York, NJ,
Iraq), people’s names and titles (Bush, Sen, John),
some abbreviations (pres, corp, dept) and verbs of
conflict (contends, dies). On the other hand, from
KL(G ∥ A), we can see that it is unlikely for
writers to include courtesy titles (Mr, Ms, Jr.) and
relative time reference in summaries. The words
with high PrA(w) scores overlaps with those
ranked highly by KL(A ∥ G) to some extent,

but also includes a number of generally frequent
words which appeared often both in the abstracts
and original texts, such as million and percent.

6.2 Blind Sentence Extraction

In later sections we include the measures of
global word importance as a feature of our
regression model for predicting word weights for
summarization. Before turning to that, however,
we report the results of an experiment aimed to
confirm the usefulness of these features. We
present a system, BLIND, which uses only weights
assigned to words by KL(A ∥ G) from NYT,
without doing any analysis of the original input.
We rank all non-stopword words from the input
according to this score. The top k words are given
weight 1, while the others are given weight 0.
The summaries are produced following the greedy
procedure described in Section 5.1.

Systems R-1 R-2 R-4
RANDOM 30.32 4.42 0.36

BLIND (80 keywords) 30.77 5.18 0.53
BLIND (300 keywords) 32.91 5.94 0.61

LASTESTLEAD 31.39 6.11 0.63
FIRST-SENTENCE 34.26 7.22 1.21

Table 3: Blind sentence extraction system,
compared with three baseline systems (%)

Table 3 shows that the BLIND system has R-2
recall of 0.0594 using the top 300 keywords,
significantly better than picking sentences from
the input randomly. It also achieves comparable
performance with the baseline in DUC 2004,
formed by selecting the first 100 words from
the latest article in the input (LASTESTLEAD).
However it is significantly worse than another
baseline of selecting the first sentences from the
input. Table 4 gives sample summaries generated
by these three approaches. These results confirm
that the information gleaned from the analysis

Random Summary
It was sunny and about 14 degrees C(57 degrees F) in Tashkent on Sunday. The president is a strong person, and he has been
through far more difficult political situations, Mityukov said, according to Interfax. But Yeltsin’s aides say his first term,
from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current
constitution took effect. He must stay in bed like any other person, Yakushkin said. The issue was controversial earlier this
year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election.
NYT Summary from global keyword selection, KL(A ∥ G), k = 300
Russia’s constitutional court opened hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. Yeltsin’s growing
health problems would also seem to rule out another election campaign. The Russian constitution has a two-term limit for
presidents. Russian president Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that
revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. The upper house of
parliament was busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The start of the meeting was shown on Russian television.
First Sentence Generated Summary
President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday. President Boris Yeltsin’s
doctors have pronounced his health more or less normal, his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. President
Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday
because he wasn’t feeling well, his spokesman said. Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central
Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.

of NYT abstract-original pairs encodes highly
relevant information about important content
independent of the actual text of the input.

7 Regression-Based Keyword Extraction

Here we introduce a logistic regression model
for assigning importance weights to words in the
input. Crucially, this model combines evidence
from multiple indicators of importance. We have
at our disposal abundant data for learning because
each content word in the input can be treated as
a labeled instance. There are in total 32, 052
samples from the 30 inputs of DUC 2003 for
training, 54, 591 samples from the 50 inputs of
DUC 2004 for testing. For a word in the input,
we assign label 1 if the word appears in at least
one of the four human summaries for this input.
Otherwise we assign label 0.

In the rest of this section, we describe the rich
variety of features included in our system. We also
analyze and discuss the predictive power of those
features by performing Wilcoxon signed-rank test
on the DUC 2003 dataset. There are in total 9, 261
features used, among them 1, 625 are significant
(p-value < 0.05). We rank these features in
increasing p-values derived from Wilcoxon test.
Apart from the widely used features of word
frequency and positions, some other less explored
features are highly significant.

7.1 Frequency Features

We use the Probability, LLR chi-square statistic
value and MRW scores as features. Since prior
work has demonstrated that for LLR weights in

particular, it is useful to identify a small set of
important words and ignore all other words in
summary selection (Gupta et al., 2007), we use
a number of keyword indicators as features. For
these indicators, the value of feature is 1 if the
word is ranked within top ki, 0 otherwise. Here ki
are preset cutoffs5. These cutoffs capture different
possibilities for defining the keywords in the input.
We also add the number of input documents that
contain the word as a feature. There are a total of
100 features in this group, all of which are highly
significant, ranked among the top 200.

7.2 Standard features
We now describe some standard features which
have been applied in prior work on summarization.

Word Locations: Especially in news articles,
sentences that occur at the beginning are often the
most important ones. In line with this observation,
we calculate several features related to the position
in which a word appears. We first compute
the relative positions for word tokens, where
the tokens are numbered sequentially in order of
appearance in each document in the input. The
relative position for one word token is therefore
its corresponding number, divided by total number
of tokens minus one in the document, e.g., 0
for the first token, 1 for the last token. For
each word, we calculate its earliest first location,
latest last location, average location and average
first location for tokens of this word across all
documents in the input. In addition we have a
binary feature indicating if the word appears in the

510, 15, 20, 30, 40, · · · , 190, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280,
300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700 (in total 33 values)

716



first sentence and the number of times it appears
in a first sentence among documents in one input.
There are 6 features in this group. All of them are
very significant, ranked within the top 100.

Word type: These features include Part of
Speech (POS) tags, Name Entity (NE) labels and
capitalization information. We use the Stanford
POS-Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) and Name
Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). We have
one feature corresponding to each possible POS
and NE tag. The value of this feature is the
proportion of occurrences of the word with this
tag; in most cases only one feature gets a non-zero
value. We have two features which indicate if
one word has been capitalized and the ratio of its
capitalized occurrences.

Most of the NE features (6 out of 8) are
significant: there are more Organizations and
Locations but fewer Time and Date words in the
human summaries. Of the POS tags, 11 out of 41
are significant: there are more nouns (NN, NNS,
NNPS); fewer verbs (VBG, VBP, VB) and fewer
cardinal numbers in the abstracts compared to the
input. Capitalized words also tend to be included
in human summaries.

KL: Prior work has shown that having estimates
of sentence importance can also help in estimating
word importance (Wan et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2011; Wei et al., 2008). The summarizer based
on KL-divergence assigns importance to sentences
directly, in a complex function according to the
word distribution in the sentence. Therefore,
we use these summaries as potential indicators
of word importance. We include two features
here, the first one indicates if the word appears
in a KLSUM summary of the input, as well as
a feature corresponding to the number of times
the word appeared in that summary. Both of the
features are highly significant, ranked within the
top 200.

7.3 NYT-weights as Features

We include features from the relative rank of
a word according to KL(A ∥ G), KL(G ∥
A), PrA(w)−PrG(w), PrA(w)/PrG(w) and
PrA(w), derived from the NYT as described in
Section 6. If the rank of a word is within top-k
or bottom-k by one metric, we would label it as
1, where k is selected from a set of pre-defined
values6. We have in total 70 features in this

6100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 in this case.

category, of which 56 are significant, 47 having
a p-value less than 10−7. The predictive power of
those global indicators are only behind the features
which indicates frequency and word positions.

7.4 Unigrams
This is a binary feature corresponding to each
of the words that appeared at least twice in the
training data. The idea is to learn which words
from the input tend to be mentioned in the human
summaries. There are in total 8, 691 unigrams,
among which 1, 290 are significant. Despite the
high number of significant unigram features, most
of them are not as significant as the more general
ones we described so far. It is interesting to
compare the significant unigrams identified in the
DUC abstract/input data with those derived from
the NYT corpus. Unigrams that tend to appear in
DUC summaries include president, government,
political. We also find the same unigrams among
the top words from NYT corpus according to
KL(A ∥ G) . As for words unlikely to appear in
summaries, we see Wednesday, added, thing, etc,
which again rank high according to KL(G ∥ A).
7.5 Dictionary Features: MPQA and LIWC
Unigram features are notoriously sparse. To
mitigate the sparsity problem, we resort to
more general groupings to words according to
salient semantic and functional categories. We
employ two hand-crafted dictionaries, MPQA for
subjectivity analysis and LIWC for topic analysis.

The MPQA dictionary (Wiebe and Cardie,
2005) contains words with different polarities
(positive, neutral, negative) and intensities (strong,
weak). The combinations correspond to six
features. It turns out that words with strong
polarity, either positive or negative, are seldomly
included in the summaries. Most strikingly,
the p-value from significance test for the strong
negative words is less than 10−4—these words
are rarely included in summaries. There is no
significant difference on weak polarity categories.

Another dictionary we use is LIWC (Tausczik
and Pennebaker, 2007), which contains manually
constructed dictionaries for multiple categories
of words. The value of the feature is 1 for
one word if the word appears in the particular
dictionary for the category. 34 out of 64 LIWC
features are significant. Interesting categories
which appear at higher rate in summaries include
events about death, anger, achievements, money

717



and negative emotions. Those that appear at lower
rate in the summaries include auxiliary verbs, hear,
pronouns, negation, function words, social words,
swear, adverbs, words related to families, etc.

7.6 Context Features
We use context features here, based on the
assumption that context importance around a word
affects the importance of this word. For context
we consider the words before and after the target
word. We extend our feature space by calculating
the weighted average of the feature values of the
context words. For word w, we denote Lw as the
set of words before w, Rw as the set of words
after w. We denote the feature for one word as
w.fi, the way of calculating the newly extended
word-before feature w.lfi could be written as:

w.lfi =
∑

i

p(wl) · wl.fi, ∀wl ∈ Lw

Here p(wl) is the probability word wl appears
before w among all words in Lw.

For context features, we calculate the weighted
average of the most widely used basic features,
including frequency, location and capitalization
for surrounding contexts. There are in total
220 features of this kind, among which 117 are
significant, 74 having a p-value less than 10−4.

8 Experiments

The performance of our logistic regression model
is evaluated on two tasks: keyword identification
and extractive summarization. We name our
system REGSUM.

8.1 Regression for Keyword Identification
For each input, we define the set of keywords
as the top k words according to the scores
generated from different models. We compare
our regression system with three unsupervised
systems: PROB, LLR, MRW. To show the
effectiveness of new features, we compare our
results with a regression system trained only
on word frequency and location related features
described in Section 7. Those features are the
ones standardly used for ranking the importance
of words in recent summarization works (Yih et
al., 2007; Takamura and Okumura, 2009; Sipos et
al., 2012), and we name this system REGBASIC.

Figure 1 shows the performance of systems
when selecting the 100 words with highest weights

Figure 1: Precision, Recall and F-score of
keyword identification, 100 words selected, G1 as
gold-standard

as keywords. Each word from the input that
appeared in any of the four human summaries is
considered as a gold-standard keyword. Among
the unsupervised approaches, word probability
identifies keywords better than LLR and MRW
by at least 4% on F-score. REGBASIC does not
give better performance at keyword identification
compared with PROB, even though it includes
location information. Our system gets 2.2%
F-score improvement over PROB, 5.2% over
REGBASIC, and more improvement over the
other approaches. All of these improvements are
statistically significant by Wilcoxon test.

Table 5 shows the performance of keyword
identification for different Gi and different
number of keywords selected. The regression
system has no advantage over PROB when
identifying keywords that appeared in all of the
four human summaries. However our system
achieves significant improvement for predicting
words that appeared in more than one or two
human summaries.7

8.2 Regression for Summarization

We now show that the performance of extractive
summarization can be improved by better
estimation of word weights. We compare our
regression system with the four models introduced
in Section 8.1. We also include PEER-65, the best
system in DUC-2004, as well as KLSUM for
comparison. Apart from these, we compare our
model with two state-of-the-art systems, including
the submodular approach (SUBMOD) (Lin and

similar to the pyramid method for summarization. Still
our system shows significant improvement over the others.

(DPP) summarizer (Kulesza and Taskar, 2012).
The summaries were kindly provided by the
authors of these systems (Hong et al., 2014).

As can been seen in Table 6, our system
outperforms PROB, LLR, MRW, PEER-65,
KLSUM and REGBASIC. These improvements
are significant on ROUGE-2 recall. Interestingly,
although the supervised system REGBASIC which
uses only frequency and positions achieve
low performance in keyword identification, the
summaries it generates are of high quality. The
inclusion of position features negatively affects the
performance in summary keyword identification
but boosts the weights for the words which appear
close to the beginning of the documents, which is
helpful for identifying informative sentences. By
including other features we greatly improve over
REGBASIC in keyword identification. Similarly
here the richer set of features results in better
quality summaries.

We also examined the ROUGE-1, -2, -4
recall compared with the SUBMOD and DPP
summarizers8. There is no significant difference
on R-2 and R-4 recall compared with these
two state-of-the-art systems. DPP performed
significantly better than our system on R-1 recall,
but that system is optimizing on R-1 F-score in
training. Overall, our conceptually simple system
is on par with the state of the art summarizers and
points to the need for better models for estimating
word importance.

8The results are slightly different from the ones reported
in the original papers due to the fact that we truncated to 100
words, while they truncated to 665 bytes.

9 Conclusion

We presented a series of experiments which
show that keyword identification can be improved
in a supervised framework which incorporates
a rich set of indicators of importance. We
also show that the better estimation of word
importance leads to better extractive summaries.
Our analysis of features related to global
importance, sentiment and topical categories
reveals rather unexpected results and confirms that
word importance estimation is a worthy research
direction. Success in the task is likely to improve
sophisticated summarization approaches too, as
well as sentence compression systems which use
only crude frequency related measures to decide
which words should be deleted from a sentence.9
