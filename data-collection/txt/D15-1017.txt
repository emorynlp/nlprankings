Abstract

Opinion summarization is the task of pro-
ducing the summary of a text, such that the
summary also preserves the sentiment of
the text. Opinion Summarization is thus a
trade-off between summarization and sen-
timent analysis. The demand of com-
pression may drop sentiment bearing sen-
tences, and the demand of sentiment de-
tection may bring in redundant sentences.
We harness the power of submodularity
to strike a balance between two conflict-
ing requirements. We investigate an in-
cipient class of submodular functions for
the problem, and a partial enumeration
based greedy algorithm that has perfor-
mance guarantee of 63%. Our functions
generate summaries such that there is good
correlation between document sentiment
and summary sentiment along with good
ROUGE score, which outperforms the-
state-of-the-art algorithms.

1 Introduction

Sentiment Analysis is often addressed as a classi-
fication task, which aims at determining the sen-
timent of a word, sentence, paragraph or a docu-
ment as a whole into positive, negative or neutral
classes (Pang et al., 2002). Summarization, on the
other hand is the task of aggregating and represent-
ing information content from a single document or
multiple documents in a brief and fluent manner.
Due to the explosive growth of data, fine grained
sentiment analysis as well as summarization on the
whole chunk of data can be a very time-consuming
task. Sentiment Analysis also requires filtering of
text portions as either objective (factual informa-
tion) or subjective (expressing some sentiment or
opinion) during pre-processing and then, classify-
ing the subjective extracts as positive or negative.

Subjective extracts can also be provided to users
as a summary of the sentiment-oriented content
of the reviews in search engines. In this paper,
we address the problem of generic extractive sum-
marization of reviews, a task commonly known as
Opinion Summarization (Liu, 2012). The goals of
opinion summarization are:

1. Present a short summary that conveys the
essence as well as the sentiment of the review

2. Provide a short subjective extract to NLP
pipeline for faster execution (e.g. sentiment
analysis, review clustering etc.).

In this paper, we use movie reviews for opinion
summarization task as they often have the follow-
ing parts:

1. Plot - Description of the story, which is fac-
tual in nature

2. Critique - Opinion about the movie, which is
sentiment bearing

Clearly, opinion summary to be generated will
have a trade-off between the two opposing parts
- subjective critique and objective plot. Our goal
is to strike a balance through linear combination of
suitable submodular functions in our paper. Joint
models of relevance and subjectivity have a great
benefit in that they have a large degree of freedom
as far as controlling redundancy goes. In con-
trast, conventional two-stage approach Pang and
Lee (2004), which first generate candidate sub-
jective sentences using min-cut and then selects
top subjective sentences within budget to generate
a summary, have less computational complexity
than joint models. However, two-stage approaches
are suboptimal for text summarization. For ex-
ample, when we select subjective sentences first,
the sentiment as well information content may be-
come redundant for a particular aspect. On the

169



other hand, when we extract sentences first, an im-
portant subjective sentence may fail to be selected,
simply because it is long. The two stage conflict
in the sense that the demand of compression may
drop sentiment bearing sentences, and the demand
of sentiment detection may bring in redundant sen-
tences. We then, use partial enumeration based
greedy algorithm (Khuller et al., 1999), which
gives performance guarantee of (1− e−1)≈ 0.632
(Sviridenko, 2004). The performance guarantee
reported is better than simple greedy algorithm,
used by Lin and Bilmes (2010) as their proof is
erroneous (Morita et al., 2013). Further, the same
greedy algorithm, which was used again in Lin and
Bilmes (2011) gives only performance guarantee
of 12(1− e1) ≈ 0.316 (Khuller et al., 1999).

The rest of the paper is as follows - in the next
section, we look at previous work and establish
further motivation for our work. Following that,
we build the theory and formulate suitable objec-
tives for opinion summarization task. In the final
section, we present results based on implementa-
tion and testing of the functions. Experimental re-
sults show that the functions outperform the-state-
of-the-art methods.

2 Previous Work

Automatically generating opinion summaries
from large review text corpora has long been stud-
ied in both information retrieval and natural lan-
guage processing.

In (Pang and Lee, 2004), a mincut-based algo-
rithm was proposed to classify each sentence as
being subjective or objective. The purpose of this
work was to remove objective sentences from re-
views to improve document level sentiment classi-
fication. Interestingly, the cut functions are sym-
metrical and submodular, and the problem of find-
ing min-cut is equivalent to minimizing a symmet-
ric submodular function.

Lerman et al. (2009) proposed three different
models - sentiment match (SM), sentiment match
+ aspect coverage (SMAC) and sentiment-aspect
match (SAM) to perform summarization of re-
views of a product. The first model is called sen-
timent match (SM), which extracts sentences so
that the average sentiment of the summary is as
close as possible to the average sentiment rating
of reviews of the entity i.e. low MISMATCH
but with high sentiment INTENSITY. The sec-
ond model, called sentiment match + aspect cov-

erage (SMAC), builds a summary that trades-off
between DIVERSITY, maximally covering impor-
tant aspects and MISMATCH, matching the over-
all sentiment of the entity along with high INTEN-
SITY. The third model, called sentiment-aspect
match (SAM), not only attempts to cover impor-
tant aspects, but cover them with appropriate sen-
timent using KL-Divergence function. Here, IN-
TENSITY and DIVERSITY in the first two mod-
els are linear monotone submodular functions,
while KL-Divergence function i.e. relative en-
tropy in last model, unlike entropy is not mono-
tone submodular.

In (Nishikawa et al., 2010b), a more sophis-
ticated summarization technique was proposed,
which generates a traditional text summary by se-
lecting and ordering sentences taken from multi-
ple reviews, considering both informativeness and
readability of the final summary. The readability
score in this paper would have been linear mono-
tone submodular function, if the negative polarity
was not penalizing. In (Nishikawa et al., 2010a),
the authors further studied this problem using an
integer linear programming formulation.

On the other hand, Lin et al .(2011) treated the
task of generic summarization as monotone sub-
modular function maximization. Further, they ar-
gued that monotone non-decreasing submodular
functions are an ideal class of functions to inves-
tigate for document summarization. They also
show, in fact, that many well-established meth-
ods for summarization (Carbonell and Goldstein,
1998; Filatova, 2004; Riedhammer et al., 2010)
correspond to submodular function optimization,
a property not explicitly mentioned in these publi-
cations. Since many authors either in summariza-
tion or opinion summarization have used functions
similar to submodular functions as objective, we
can take this fact as testament to the value of sub-
modular functions for opinion summarization.

3 Theoretical Background

3.1 Introduction to Submodular Functions
A submodular function is a set function (f : 2V →
R) having a natural diminishing returns property.
Diminishing returns property holds if the differ-
ence in the value of the function that a single ele-
ment makes when added to an input set decreases
as the size of the input set increases i.e. for every
A,B ⊆ V with A ⊆ B and every x ∈ V \B, we
have that f(A∪{x})−f(A) ≥ f(B∪{x})−f(B).

170



A submodular function f is monotone if for every
A ⊆ B, we have that f(A) ≤ f(B).

The extractive summarization task can be mod-
eled as optimization problem i.e. finding a set
S ⊆ V (S is set of sentences in summary, V is
set of sentences in Document) which maximizes a
submodular function f(S) subject to budget con-
straints. In the following section, we will justify
the use of submodular function for opinion sum-
marization. Another advantage of choosing mono-
tone submodular function is that there exists a
polynomial-time greedy algorithm for constrained
monotone submodular objective. The greedy al-
gorithm guarantees that the summary solution ob-
tained is almost as good as (63%) the best possi-
ble summary solution according to the objective
(Sviridenko, 2004; Wolsey, 1982).

3.2 Submodularity in Opinion
Summarization

Opinion Summarization should be modeled as
a monotone submodular optimization problem,
since opinion summary also holds following prop-
erties:

1. Monotonicity - As more sentences are added
to opinion summary, subjectivity increases
along with information content as opinion-
ated words are being added.

2. Diminishing Return - If multiple sentences of
varying intensity are added to opinion sum-
mary, the effect of a lower intensity polarity
bearing sentence is diluted in the presence of
a higher intensity one.

To show that opinion summarization inherently
follow the diminishing return property, consider
the following sentences1 with positive polarity:
A: “Even the acting in From Hell is solid, with the
dreamy Depp turning in a typically strong perfor-
mance and deftly handling a British accent.”
B: “Worth mentioning are the supporting roles by
Ians Holm and Richardsonlog.”
(A ∪ B) : “Even the acting in From Hell is solid,
with the dreamy Depp turning in a typically strong
performance and deftly handling a British accent.
Worth mentioning are the supporting roles by Ians
Holm and Richardsonlog.” Compare A and its su-
perset, A ∪ B as candidate summaries. Sentence
A and B convey positive sentiment, but sentence

1http://www.imdb.com/reviews/295/29590.html

B has less intensity compared to sentence A. After
reading the text (A∪B), it is clear that the effect of
sentence B has diminished in front of sentence A,
though both are of same polarity. B can be thus,
removed from the candidate summary as it does
a diminishing addition in presence of sentence A
to the positive sentiment over the "acting" aspect
of the entity "movie". The diminishing return not
only holds for same polarity but also, for opposite
polarity. Consider another example2:
A: “The movie is predictive with foreseeable end-
ing.”
B: “Still it’s very well-done that no movie in this
entire year has a scene that evokes pure joy as this
does.”
(A ∪ B) : “The movie is predictive with foresee-
able ending. Still it’s very well-done that no movie
in this entire year has a scene that evokes pure joy
as this does.” Compare B and its superset, A ∪
B as candidate summaries. Sentence A has neg-
ative sentiment whereas sentence B conveys posi-
tive sentiment with more intensity. When we read
the text (A ∪ B), it is clear that the effect of sen-
tence A has diminished in front of sentence B in
text , as usually polarity of higher intensity dom-
inates over the polarity of lower intensity. Now,
consider a general example3,
“Laurence plays Neo’s mentor Morpheus and he
does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with con-
fidence and style that makes his acting unique and
interesting. The movie has lot of special effects
and action-packed scenes with part of the appeal
has philosophical and religious underpinnings.”

If the budget for summary had been only two
subjective sentences, then picking up first two
would have redundantly captured only single as-
pect (i.e. acting) and the redundancy of the con-
cept (acting) also causes a diminishing return of
the second sentence because of the difference in
sentiment intensity. However, picking the last
sentence with either one of the first two would
have not just covered both the aspects (i.e. acting
and visual effects) but since, the sentences are not
overlapping in aspects, there would not have been
any diminishing return of sentiment on shared as-
pect (acting). Thus, it can be verified that opinion
polarity also holds submodular property of dimin-
ishing return, if they are on the same aspect of a
distinct entity.

4 Formulation

Let V represent the set of the sentences in a doc-
ument. The task of extractive opinion summariza-
tion is to select a subset S ∈ V to represent the
entirety (ground set V ) . Obviously, we should
have |S| ≤ |V | as it is a summary and should be
small. Therefore, constraints on S can naturally be
modeled as knapsack constraints:∑

i∈S
ci ≤ b (1)

where ci is the non-negative cost of selecting
unit i (e.g., the number of words in the sentence)
and b is our budget. If we use a set function
F : 2V → R to measure the quality of the sum-
mary set S, the summarization problem can then
be formalized as the following combinatorial opti-
mization problem:

S∗ ∈ argmaxS⊂V F (S) s.t.
∑
i∈S

ci ≤ b (2)

where F (S) , total utility of summary is given as
a linear combination of L(S), relevance and A(S),
subjective coverage of aspects.

F (S) = αL(S) + βA(S) (3)

This formulation clearly brings out the trade-off
between the subjective and the objective part. The
intuition behind the combination of sentiment and
aspect coverage in same function A(S) is that opin-
ion polarity holds submodular property of dimin-
ishing return only if the set of sentences talk about
common aspect of the same entity as discussed
in previous section. L(S) , relevance is modeled
same as in (Lin and Bilmes, 2011) as it captures
the summary property, while our novel function,
A(S) has been modeled differently through a suit-
able submodular function such that it captures the
subjectivity property.

L(S) =
∑
i∈V

min{ci(S), γci(V )} (4)

ci(S) =
∑
j∈S

wi,j (5)

Here, wi,j > 0 measures the similarity between
ith and jth sentences and ci(S) measures the sim-
ilarity of summary with the document.

Since, A(S), subjective coverage of aspects has
to be modeled as monotone submodular function,
it has been formulated as :

1. A1 : Modular Function
A1(S) is simple linear function, which is sum
of weighted subjective scores for each sen-
tence. No budgeting constraints are added to
this formulation.

A1(S) =
∑

i

∑
j∈(Pi∩S)

sj ∗ wi (6)

Here Pi; i = 1...K is a partition of the ground
set V (i.e., ∪iPi = V ), which contains sen-
tences pertaining to different distinct aspects.
wi are the weights of the partitions, based on
the corresponding aspects. sj is the subjec-
tive score of the sentence j in summary. The
subjective score sj is calculated using senti-
wordnet as sum of the positive score ∈ [0, 1]
and negative score ∈ [0, 1] (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2006).

sj =
∑

word∈j
(pos(word) + neg(word))

(7)

2. A2 : Budget-additive Function
A2(S) is an extension to A1(S), where max-
imum subjectivity score is restricted with
budget based on aspect. Here, λ ∈ [0, 1]
is threshold coefficient for budget additive
function to avoid redundancy of high senti-
ment on same aspect. When aspect i is satu-
rated by S (min(

∑
j∈(Pi∩S) sj , λ) = λ), any

new sentence j cannot further improve cov-
erage over i and thus, other aspects, which
are not yet saturated will have a better chance
of being covered. This formulation ensures
that produced summary is diverse enough and
conveys sentiment about different aspects by
budgeting.

A2(S) =
∑

i

min(
∑

j∈(Pi∩S)
sj , λi) ∗ wi (8)

3. A3 : Polarity Partitioned Budget-additive
Function
In previous formulation we have not consid-
ered the polarity of the sentences. For ex-
ample, if an aspect have many positive sen-
tences with more intensity but few negative

172



sentences with less intensity, A2 more likely
to reward more positive sentences because of
intensity. In this formulation budgeting ap-
plied not only on aspect but polarity scores
too. This ensures that both positive and neg-
ative polarity sentences are part of summary.

A3(S) =
∑

i

min(
∑

j∈(Pi∩S∩Ppos)
sj , λi) ∗ wi

+min(
∑

j∈(Pi∩S∩Pneg)
sj , λi) ∗ wi

(9)

Ppos and Pneg are the partition of the sen-
tences in the ground set V , based on their
sign of polarity score. The polarity score polj
for partitioning sentences into Ppos and Pneg
is calculated as difference of the positive and
negative score.

polj =
∑

word∈j
(pos(word)− neg(word))

(10)

Polarity based partitions bring out contrast
view on a particular aspect, which is simi-
lar to contrast view opinion summarization to
give the reader a direct comparative view of
different strong opinions.

4. A4 : Facility Location Function

In this formulation, we model the facil-
ity location objective function (Krause and
Golovin, 2014) for opinion summarization as
choosing possible sentences (facilities) out
of document (set of locations) to serve as-
pects (customers) giving service of value sj .
If each aspect (customer) chooses the sen-
tences (facility) with the highest value, the to-
tal value provided to all aspects (customers)
is modeled by this set function.

A4(S) =
∑

i

maxj∈(Pi∩S)sj ∗ wi (11)

So A4 rewards only a sentence which has
maximum subjectivity score in each aspect.

5. A5 : Polarity Partitioned Facility Location
Function
A5 is similar to A4, but for each aspect, A5
rewards two sentences with positive and neg-
ative polarity but with maximum subjectivity
scores in those polarity partitions.

A5(S) =
∑

i

maxj∈(Pi∩S∩Ppos)sj ∗ wi

+
∑

i

maxj∈(Pi∩S∩Pneg)sj ∗ wi
(12)

Each of the above functions are monotone sub-
modular as the parameters sj and wi are positive.
Since the first function is linear, it is both submod-
ular and supermodular, thus modular. Budget ad-
ditive and facility location functions (Krause and
Golovin, 2014) are special types of monotone sub-
modular functions. Since, monotone submodular-
ity is preserved under non-negative linear combi-
nations, polarity based partitioned function, whose
sub-parts are monotone submodular is also mono-
tone submodular.

5 Experiment

We have created Movie ontology tree manually
(figure 1). Further the ontology is enriched by
adding clue words to all aspects using wordnet
sense propagation algorithm (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006) for three iterations. The algorithm does a
hard clustering of the sentences by assigning the
sentence aspect, which has maximum number of
clue words in that sentence. Clue words for ‘Plot’
aspect are story, script, storyline, chief, commu-
nicative, explain, narrate, narration, narrative,
narrator, report, reporter, scheme, schemer, script,
scriptural, storyteller, tell, write up..,.

For the experiments, we have used the polar-
ity dataset from Pang et al. (2004). The dataset
contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie
reviews with size varying between 700 to 1000
words. As summary generation is time consum-
ing task (DUC4 only used 25 summaries to eval-
uate the performance of systems), we picked 100
positive and 100 negative reviews randomly from
the dataset and their abstract summaries are gener-
ated manually with 200 words limit as budget for

evaluation. These 200 summaries are used as gold
standard for estimating ROUGE scores of system
generated summaries.

In the experiment, the partial enumeration based
greedy algorithm (Khuller et al., 1999) is used for
summary generation of 200 test documents within
budget of 200 words. The algorithm has two parts.
In the first part, the algorithm compares function
values of all feasible solutions (sets) of cardinal-
ity one or two. Let Summ1 be a feasible set of
cardinality one or two that has the largest value of
the objective function F (S). In the second part,
the algorithm enumerates all feasible sets of cardi-
nality three. The algorithm, then completes each
such set greedily and keeps the current solution
feasible with respect to the knapsack constraint.
Let Summ2 be the solution obtained in the second
part that has the largest value of objective function
over all choices of the starting set for the greedy
algorithm. Finally, the algorithm outputs Summ1
if F (Summ1) > F (Summ2) else Summ2 oth-
erwise. The algorithm does O(n2) function cal-
culations in first part, while O(n5) in second part.
This algorithm gives a performance guarantee of

(1−e−1) for solving monotone submodular objec-
tive with knapsack constraint (Khuller et al., 1999;
Sviridenko, 2004). As far as we know, the algo-
rithm has not been implemented for such prob-
lems because of complexity constraints (Lin and
Bilmes, 2011).

In the algorithm, the sentences are clustered in
different partitions, corresponding to different as-
pects in the ontology tree using the clue words.
In the experiment, hard clustering of the sentences
in aspect-based partitions is considered but soft-
clustering of the sentences will also work with this
approach, which has been left out to avoid further
parameter tuning for soft clustering assigments.
The weights of the partitions as well as the thresh-
old parameters for the A(S) are currently kept pro-
portional to the inverse of the depth of that aspect
in the ontology-tree as sentiment expressed on the
concepts at higher level in the ontology tree should
have more weightage.

The linear combination parameter β is set as 1−

subjective coverage of aspects andα is varied from
0 to 1 with step size 0.05 to find optimal α. γ in
L(S) is set to 0.5. The parameter learning, esp. α
and its impact have been already studied in (Lin
and Bilmes, 2011) and thus, is not addressed in
the paper. We have used the same approach of grid
search to find the optimal value of α.

6 Results

We use ROUGE (Lin, 2004) for evaluating the
content of summaries. We have used the 200 test
documents that are manually summarized as gold
standard data for ROUGE evaluation. For figuring
out the sentiment correlation between manual and
system generated summaries, we trained Naive
Bayes sentiment classifier (Pang et al., 2002) on
training data using bag of words approach with
features as unigrams and bigrams and then, us-
ing minimum Pearson’s chi-square score of 3 for
feature extraction (Pecina and Schlesinger, 2006)
before calculating the sentiment. The measure
of sentiment preservation is calculated as Pear-
son correlation between the sentiment score of the
document and the corresponding summary senti-
ment, both calculated by the Naive Bayes senti-
ment classifier while the measure of coverage of
information content is given by ROUGE-1 and
ROUGE-2 f-scores. Mathematically,

Correlation(X,Y ) =
Covariance(X,Y )

std.dev(X) ∗ std.dev(Y )
(13)

Here, random variable X is the sentiment score
of the document sample and random variable
Y is the sentiment score of the correspond-
ing summary sample. For 200 documents, it
will be [(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ..., (X200, Y200)] sam-
ple points for the above correlation function.

Following five baselines are used for compari-
son:

1. Baseline-1/TOP : Sentences selected con-
secutively from the start of the review within
the budget.

2. Baseline-2/TOP-SUBJ : Sentences ranked
based on their subjectivity and then, selected
with in the budget.

3. Baseline-3/LER-SM : (Lerman et al., 2009)
Sentences which have sentiment close to doc-
ument sentiment are chosen as Summary. We

have used same NaiveBayes classifier (Pang
et al., 2002) trained on imdb corpus to predict
the sentiment of a sentence and document.

minS⊂V
∑
j∈S

(|senti(V )− senti(j)|) (14)

4. Baseline-4/TEXTRANK : TextRank sum-
marizer is based on Graph based unsuper-
vised algorithm. Graph is constructed by cre-
ating a vertex for each sentence in the docu-
ment and edges between vertices based on the
number of words two sentences (of vertices)
have in common and then, ranking them by
applying PageRank to the resulting graph.
Summary is generated with sentences hav-
ing more vertex score (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004).

5. Baseline-5/MINCUT : Mincut algorithm
(Pang and Lee, 2004) classifies the sentences
as subjective and objective sentences, by
finding minimum s-t cuts in graph of sen-
tences using maximum flow algorithm. In
the graph, each sentence is a vertex and the
edge between the vertex to the source or sink
is taken as probability of the sentence being
subjective or objective (individual scores).
To ensure the graph connectivity, edges are
drawn between every pair of sentence ver-
tices, with edge weights taken proportional to
the degree of proximity (association scores).
After maximum flow algorithm, the cut in
which source vertex lies is classified as sub-
jective and vice-versa. We pick top subjective
sentences within the budget as summary.

Among the five baselines, TOP and TOP-SUBJ
are simplistic. Though both TEXTRANK and
MINCUT were not originally proposed for opin-
ion summarization but a number of papers in opin-
ion summarization have built over these two meth-
ods and also, used them as baselines and thus,
comparing with the "well-known" baselines will
give the readers from the sentiment analysis field
an intuitive idea of the performance of our sys-
tem. MINCUT, however was reproposed specif-
ically for subjective summarization by Pang and
Lee (2004) and we use that formulation for com-
parison.

Table 1 compares the five functions with the
above baselines based on optimal values of trade-
off α. From the table, it can be inferred that all the

proposed functions not only outperform the base-
lines in terms of ROUGE scores for optimal pa-
rameters but also, give better correlation with the
document sentiment. This can be quantitively ver-
ified by test of significance, unpaired one-tailed
t-test without assuming equal variance between
the baselines and the systems. The p-values are
0.0203 and 0.0066 respectively for ROUGE-1 F
Score and Sentiment Correlation, justifying that
the performance improvement by our system over
the baselines is statistically significant at p <
0.05. The main reason being that the functions
with optimal values of trade-off parameter α strike
out a balance between relevance and subjectivity.
Clearly, the facility location based monotone sub-
modular functions are the best choice as objective
for opinion summarization task as they select sen-
tences with maximum subjectivity (facilities giv-
ing best service).

Our system is able to access the information of
aspect and polarity of each sentence, while some
baselines do not. So, the improvement over the
baselines may be attributed to those additional in-
formation rather than the optimality of the par-
tial enumeration greedy algorithm over submodu-
lar functions. So, we therefore, introduced the fol-
lowing baseline to question this misdoubt on the
experiment:

6. Baseline-6/LIN :

In this baseline, the greedy algorithm (Lin and
Bilmes, 2010) is used for summary generation, us-
ing the same functions and information in the for-
mulation. This algorithm fills the empty summary
set greedily by adding a single sentence in each

len(s) ), ensuring that current solution

is feasible with respect to the knapsack constraint
(cost(S ∪ {newSentence}) ≤ B). This algorithm
has a complexity of O(n2) but gives only perfor-
mance guarantee of 12(1− e1) ≈ 0.316 (Khuller et
al., 1999).

Table 2 compares the same five functions in our
system with (Lin and Bilmes, 2010) system based
on optimal values of tradeoff α. From the table,
it can be inferred that our system also outperforms
this baseline both in terms of ROUGE scores and
sentiment correlation, which can be quantitively
verified by test of significance, unpaired one-tailed
t-test without assuming equal variance between
the baselines and the systems. The p-values are
0.02517 and 0.003965 respectively for ROUGE-1
F Score and Sentiment Correlation, justifying that
the performance improvement by our system over
LIN system is statistically significant at p < 0.05.

ment correlation and ROUGE-1 F score for the
formulated submodular functions with respect to
the trade-off parameter, α respectively. Looking at
the graph 2, we can observe that more weightage
to relevance over subjective coverage of aspects
decreases the sentiment correlation, which was ex-
pected because the summary generated misses out
on subjective sentiment due to trade-off. Simi-
larly, by looking at the graph 3, we also observe
that more weightage to relevance over subjective
coverage of aspects increases the ROUGE score
as expected. The erratic behaviour in figure 3 can
be explained by arguing that subjective words are
also important for summary and thus, giving less
weightage to them over relevance, ROUGE score
will increase but not properly.

The table 3 presents the value of sentiment
correlation corresponding to maximum ROUGE
score (for α ≈ 1). Clearly, A4 and A2 have maxi-
mum ROUGE scores as they neglect polarities and
instead, reward on aspect based partitions, thus in-
creasing coverage. The table 4 presents the value
of ROUGE score corresponding to maximum sen-
timent correlation (for α≈ 0). Clearly,A4 also has
maximum sentiment correlation as it rewards max-
imum subjectivity, irrespective of polarities and

the corresponding ROUGE-2 F-score is also high-

the ROUGE F-score and sentiment correlation for
optimal values of α, found after grid search while
tables 3 and 4 contain the peak values in the fig-
ures 2 and 3. For example, table 3 contains the
peak value of ROUGE-1 F score from figure 3 and
the corresponding value of Sentiment Correlation
from figure 2, at the same α.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we show that conflict between sub-
jectivity and relevance naturally arises in opinion
summarization. To address this problem, we intro-
duce new monotone submodular functions that are
well suited to document summarization (Lin and
Bilmes, 2010; Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Morita et
al., 2013) by modeling two important properties of
opinion summary - relevance and subjective cover-
age of aspects. We then, design different possible
combinations of objective functions to model the
task. To solve the algorithm effectively, we use
the partial enumeration based algorithm, which
is though computationally expensive (O(n5) func-
tion calls), gives a performance guarantee of 63%
for an NP-hard problem like summarization (Mc-
Donald, 2007). We have justified the submodular
property of opinion summary through examples
and significant performance of the system over the
baselines. Further, this optimal trade-off between
relevance and subjectivity can be used to design
an evaluation framework for opinion summariza-
tion task as both part of the objective functions are
proportional to the ROUGE and Sentiment Corre-
lation respectively, which are widely used evalua-
tion measures (Kim et al., 2011). As opinion sum-
marization task lies in the intersection of opinion
mining and summarization problems, both IR and
NLP communities will benefit from our work.
