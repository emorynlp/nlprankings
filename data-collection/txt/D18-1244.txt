Abstract

Dependency trees help relation extraction
models capture long-range relations between
words. However, existing dependency-based
models either neglect crucial information (e.g.,
negation) by pruning the dependency trees
too aggressively, or are computationally inef-
ficient because it is difficult to parallelize over
different tree structures. We propose an ex-
tension of graph convolutional networks that
is tailored for relation extraction, which pools
information over arbitrary dependency struc-
tures efficiently in parallel. To incorporate rel-
evant information while maximally removing
irrelevant content, we further apply a novel
pruning strategy to the input trees by keeping
words immediately around the shortest path
between the two entities among which a rela-
tion might hold. The resulting model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale
TACRED dataset, outperforming existing se-
quence and dependency-based neural models.
We also show through detailed analysis that
this model has complementary strengths to se-
quence models, and combining them further
improves the state of the art.

1 Introduction

Relation extraction involves discerning whether a
relation exists between two entities in a sentence
(often termed subject and object, respectively).
Successful relation extraction is the cornerstone of
applications requiring relational understanding of
unstructured text on a large scale, such as ques-
tion answering (Yu et al., 2017), knowledge base
population (Zhang et al., 2017), and biomedical
knowledge discovery (Quirk and Poon, 2017).

Models making use of dependency parses of
the input sentences, or dependency-based models,

have proven to be very effective in relation ex-
traction, because they capture long-range syntac-
tic relations that are obscure from the surface form
alone (e.g., when long clauses or complex scop-
ing are present). Traditional feature-based models
are able to represent dependency information by
featurizing dependency trees as overlapping paths
along the trees (Kambhatla, 2004). However, these
models face the challenge of sparse feature spaces
and are brittle to lexical variations. More re-
cent neural models address this problem with dis-
tributed representations built from their computa-
tion graphs formed along parse trees. One com-
mon approach to leverage dependency information
is to perform bottom-up or top-down computation
along the parse tree or the subtree below the low-
est common ancestor (LCA) of the entities (Miwa
and Bansal, 2016). Another popular approach, in-
spired by Bunescu and Mooney (2005), is to re-
duce the parse tree to the shortest dependency path
between the entities (Xu et al., 2015a,b).

However, these models suffer from several



2206

drawbacks. Neural models operating directly on
parse trees are usually difficult to parallelize and
thus computationally inefficient, because aligning
trees for efficient batch training is usually non-
trivial. Models based on the shortest dependency
path between the subject and object are compu-
tationally more efficient, but this simplifying as-
sumption has major limitations as well. Figure 1
shows a real-world example where crucial infor-
mation (i.e., negation) would be excluded when
the model is restricted to only considering the de-
pendency path.

In this work, we propose a novel extension
of the graph convolutional network (Kipf and
Welling, 2017; Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017) that
is tailored for relation extraction. Our model
encodes the dependency structure over the input
sentence with efficient graph convolution opera-
tions, then extracts entity-centric representations
to make robust relation predictions. We also ap-
ply a novel path-centric pruning technique to re-
move irrelevant information from the tree while
maximally keeping relevant content, which further
improves the performance of several dependency-
based models including ours.

We test our model on the popular SemEval 2010
Task 8 dataset and the more recent, larger TAC-
RED dataset. On both datasets, our model not
only outperforms existing dependency-based neu-
ral models by a significant margin when combined
with the new pruning technique, but also achieves
a 10–100x speedup over existing tree-based mod-
els. On TACRED, our model further achieves the
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing a compet-
itive neural sequence model baseline. This model
also exhibits complementary strengths to sequence
models on TACRED, and combining these two
model types through simple prediction interpola-
tion further improves the state of the art.

To recap, our main contributions are: (i) we pro-
pose a neural model for relation extraction based
on graph convolutional networks, which allows it
to efficiently pool information over arbitrary de-
pendency structures; (ii) we present a new path-
centric pruning technique to help dependency-
based models maximally remove irrelevant infor-
mation without damaging crucial content to im-
prove their robustness; (iii) we present detailed
analysis on the model and the pruning technique,
and show that dependency-based models have
complementary strengths with sequence models.

2 Models

In this section, we first describe graph convo-
lutional networks (GCNs) over dependency tree
structures, and then we introduce an architecture
that uses GCNs at its core for relation extraction.

2.1 Graph Convolutional Networks over
Dependency Trees

The graph convolutional network (Kipf and
Welling, 2017) is an adaptation of the convolu-
tional neural network (LeCun et al., 1998) for en-
coding graphs. Given a graph with n nodes, we
can represent the graph structure with an n ⇥ n
adjacency matrix A where Aij = 1 if there is an
edge going from node i to node j. In an L-layer
GCN, if we denote by h(l�1)i the input vector and
h(l)i the output vector of node i at the l-th layer, a
graph convolution operation can be written as

h(l)i = �
� nX

j=1

AijW
(l)h(l�1)j + b

(l)
�
, (1)

where W (l) is a linear transformation, b(l) a bias
term, and � a nonlinear function (e.g., ReLU).
Intuitively, during each graph convolution, each
node gathers and summarizes information from its
neighboring nodes in the graph.

We adapt the graph convolution operation to
model dependency trees by converting each tree
into its corresponding adjacency matrix A, where
Aij = 1 if there is a dependency edge between to-
kens i and j. However, naively applying the graph
convolution operation in Equation (1) could lead
to node representations with drastically different
magnitudes, since the degree of a token varies a
lot. This could bias our sentence representation
towards favoring high-degree nodes regardless of
the information carried in the node (see details
in Section 2.2). Furthermore, the information in
h(l�1)i is never carried over to h

(l)
i , since nodes

never connect to themselves in a dependency tree.
We resolve these issues by normalizing the acti-

vations in the graph convolution before feeding it
through the nonlinearity, and adding self-loops to
each node in the graph:

h(l)i =�
� nX

j=1

ÃijW
(l)h(l�1)j /di + b

(l)
�
, (2)

where Ã = A+ I with I being the n⇥ n identity
matrix, and di =

Pn
j=1 Ãij is the degree of token

i in the resulting graph.

while on the right side, we only show the detailed graph convolution computation for the word “relative” for

Stacking this operation over L layers gives us
a deep GCN network, where we set h(0)1 , . . . , h

to be input word vectors, and use h(L)1 , . . . , h
(L)
n as

output word representations. All operations in this
network can be efficiently implemented with ma-
trix multiplications, making it ideal for batching
computation over examples and running on GPUs.
Moreover, the propagation of information between
tokens occurs in parallel, and the runtime does not
depend on the depth of the dependency tree.

Note that the GCN model presented above uses
the same parameters for all edges in the depen-
dency graph. We also experimented with: (1) us-
ing different transformation matrices W for top-
down, bottom-up, and self-loop edges; and (2)
adding dependency relation-specific parameters
for edge-wise gating, similar to (Marcheggiani and
Titov, 2017). We found that modeling directions
does not lead to improvement,1 and adding edge-
wise gating further hurts performance. We hypoth-
esize that this is because the presented GCN model
is usually already able to capture dependency edge
patterns that are informative for classifying rela-
tions, and modeling edge directions and types does
not offer additional discriminative power to the
network before it leads to overfitting. For exam-
ple, the relations entailed by “A’s son, B” and “B’s
son, A” can be readily distinguished with “’s” at-
tached to different entities, even when edge direc-
tionality is not considered.

1We therefore treat the dependency graph as undirected,
i.e. 8i, j, Aij = Aji.

2.2 Encoding Relations with GCN

We now formally define the task of relation ex-
traction. Let X = [x1, ..., xn] denote a sentence,
where xi is the ith token. A subject entity and an
object entity are identified and correspond to two
spans in the sentence: Xs = [xs1 , . . . , xs2 ] and
Xo = [xo1 , . . . , xo2 ]. Given X , Xs, and Xo, the
goal of relation extraction is to predict a relation
r 2 R (a predefined relation set) that holds be-
tween the entities or “no relation” otherwise.

After applying an L-layer GCN over word vec-
tors, we obtain hidden representations of each to-
ken that are directly influenced by its neighbors no
more than L edges apart in the dependency tree.
To make use of these word representations for re-
lation extraction, we first obtain a sentence repre-
sentation as follows (see also Figure 2 left):

hsent = f
�
h(L)

�
= f

�
GCN(h(0))

�
, (3)

where h(l) denotes the collective hidden represen-
tations at layer l of the GCN, and f : Rd⇥n ! Rd
is a max pooling function that maps from n output
vectors to the sentence vector.

We also observe that information close to entity
tokens in the dependency tree is often central to
relation classification. Therefore, we also obtain a
subject representation hs from h(L) as follows

hs = f
�
h(L)s1:s2

�
, (4)

as well as an object representation ho similarly.
Inspired by recent work on relational learning

between entities (Santoro et al., 2017; Lee et al.,
2017), we obtain the final representation used
for classification by concatenating the sentence
and the entity representations, and feeding them



2208

through a feed-forward neural network (FFNN):

hfinal = FFNN
�
[hsent;hs;ho]

�
. (5)

This hfinal representation is then fed into a linear
layer followed by a softmax operation to obtain a
probability distribution over relations.

2.3 Contextualized GCN

The network architecture introduced so far learns
effective representations for relation extraction,
but it also leaves a few issues inadequately ad-
dressed. First, the input word vectors do not con-
tain contextual information about word order or
disambiguation. Second, the GCN highly depends
on a correct parse tree to extract crucial informa-
tion from the sentence (especially when pruning
is performed), while existing parsing algorithms
produce imperfect trees in many cases.

To resolve these issues, we further apply a Con-
textualized GCN (C-GCN) model, where the input
word vectors are first fed into a bi-directional long
short-term memory (LSTM) network to gener-
ate contextualized representations, which are then
used as h(0) in the original model. This BiL-
STM contextualization layer is trained jointly with
the rest of the network. We show empirically in
Section 5 that this augmentation substantially im-
proves the performance over the original model.

We note that this relation extraction model is
conceptually similar to graph kernel-based mod-
els (Zelenko et al., 2003), in that it aims to utilize
local dependency tree patterns to inform relation
classification. Our model also incorporates crucial
off-path information, which greatly improves its
robustness compared to shortest dependency path-
based approaches. Compared to tree-structured
models (e.g., Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015)), it
not only is able to capture more global informa-
tion through the use of pooling functions, but also
achieves substantial speedup by not requiring re-
cursive operations that are difficult to parallelize.
For example, we observe that on a Titan Xp GPU,
training a Tree-LSTM model over a minibatch of
50 examples takes 6.54 seconds on average, while
training the original GCN model takes only 0.07
seconds, and the C-GCN model 0.08 seconds.

3 Incorporating Off-path Information
with Path-centric Pruning

Dependency trees provide rich structures that one
can exploit in relation extraction, but most of the

information pertinent to relations is usually con-
tained within the subtree rooted at the lowest com-
mon ancestor (LCA) of the two entities. Previous
studies (Xu et al., 2015b; Miwa and Bansal, 2016)
have shown that removing tokens outside this
scope helps relation extraction by eliminating ir-
relevant information from the sentence. It is there-
fore desirable to combine our GCN models with
tree pruning strategies to further improve perfor-
mance. However, pruning too aggressively (e.g.,
keeping only the dependency path) could lead to
loss of crucial information and conversely hurt ro-
bustness. For instance, the negation in Figure 1 is
neglected when a model is restricted to only look-
ing at the dependency path between the entities.
Similarly, in the sentence “She was diagnosed with
cancer last year, and succumbed this June”, the
dependency path She diagnosed!cancer is not
sufficient to establish that cancer is the cause of
death for the subject unless the conjunction depen-
dency to succumbed is also present.

Motivated by these observations, we propose
path-centric pruning, a novel technique to incor-
porate information off the dependency path. This
is achieved by including tokens that are up to dis-
tance K away from the dependency path in the
LCA subtree. K = 0, corresponds to pruning
the tree down to the path, K = 1 keeps all nodes
that are directly attached to the path, and K = 1
retains the entire LCA subtree. We combine this
pruning strategy with our GCN model, by directly
feeding the pruned trees into the graph convolu-
tional layers.2 We show that pruning with K = 1
achieves the best balance between including rele-
vant information (e.g., negation and conjunction)
and keeping irrelevant content out of the resulting
pruned tree as much as possible.

4 Related Work

At the core of fully-supervised and distantly-
supervised relation extraction approaches are sta-
tistical classifiers, many of which find syntac-
tic information beneficial. For example, Mintz
et al. (2009) explored adding syntactic features to
a statistical classifier and found them to be use-
ful when sentences are long. Various kernel-based
approaches also leverage syntactic information to
measure similarity between training and test ex-
amples to predict the relation, finding that tree-

the full sentence regardless of the pruning.

based kernels (Zelenko et al., 2003) and depen-
dency path-based kernels (Bunescu and Mooney,
2005) are effective for this task.

Recent studies have found neural models ef-
fective in relation extraction. Zeng et al. (2014)
first applied a one-dimensional convolutional neu-
ral network (CNN) with manual features to encode
relations. Vu et al. (2016) showed that combin-
ing a CNN with a recurrent neural network (RNN)
through a voting scheme can further improve per-
formance. Zhou et al. (2016) and Wang et al.
(2016) proposed to use attention mechanisms over
RNN and CNN architectures for this task.

Apart from neural models over word sequences,
incorporating dependency trees into neural models
has also been shown to improve relation extrac-
tion performance by capturing long-distance rela-
tions. Xu et al. (2015b) generalized the idea of de-
pendency path kernels by applying a LSTM net-
work over the shortest dependency path between
entities. Liu et al. (2015) first applied a recur-
sive network over the subtrees rooted at the words
on the dependency path and then applied a CNN
over the path. Miwa and Bansal (2016) applied a
Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015), a generalized form
of LSTM over dependency trees, in a joint entity
and relation extraction setting. They found it to be
most effective when applied to the subtree rooted
at the LCA of the two entities.

More recently, Adel et al. (2016) and Zhang
et al. (2017) have shown that relatively simple
neural models (CNN and augmented LSTM, re-
spectively) can achieve comparable or superior
performance to dependency-based models when
trained on larger datasets. In this paper, we study
dependency-based models in depth and show that
with a properly designed architecture, they can
outperform and have complementary advantages
to sequence models, even in a large-scale setting.

Finally, we note that a technique similar to path-
centric pruning has been applied to reduce the
space of possible arguments in semantic role la-
beling (He et al., 2018). The authors showed prun-
ing words too far away from the path between the
predicate and the root to be beneficial, but reported
the best pruning distance to be 10, which almost
always retains the entire tree. Our method differs
in that it is applied to the shortest dependency path
between entities, and we show that in our tech-
nique the best pruning distance is 1 for several
dependency-based relation extraction models.

5 Experiments

5.1 Baseline Models
We compare our models with several competitive
dependency-based and neural sequence models.

Dependency-based models. In our main ex-
periments we compare with three types of
dependency-based models. (1) A logistic regres-
sion (LR) classifier which combines dependency-
based features with other lexical features. (2)
Shortest Dependency Path LSTM (SDP-LSTM)
(Xu et al., 2015b), which applies a neural sequence
model on the shortest path between the subject
and object entities in the dependency tree. (3)
Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015), which is a recursive
model that generalizes the LSTM to arbitrary tree
structures. We investigate the child-sum variant of
Tree-LSTM, and apply it to the dependency tree
(or part of it). In practice, we find that modifying
this model by concatenating dependency label em-
beddings to the input of forget gates improves its
performance on relation extraction, and therefore
use this variant in our experiments. Earlier, our
group compared (1) and (2) with sequence models
(Zhang et al., 2017), and we report these results;
for (3) we report results with our own implemen-
tation.

Neural sequence model. Our group presented
a competitive sequence model that employs a
position-aware attention mechanism over LSTM
outputs (PA-LSTM), and showed that it outper-
forms several CNN and dependency-based models
by a substantial margin (Zhang et al., 2017). We
compare with this strong baseline, and use its open
implementation in further analysis.3

5.2 Experimental Setup
We conduct experiments on two relation extrac-
tion datasets: (1) TACRED: Introduced in (Zhang
et al., 2017), TACRED contains over 106k men-
tion pairs drawn from the yearly TAC KBP4 chal-
lenge. It represents 41 relation types and a spe-
cial no relation class when the mention pair does
not have a relation between them within these cat-
egories. Mentions in TACRED are typed, with
subjects categorized into person and organization,
and objects into 16 fine-grained types (e.g., date
and location). We report micro-averaged F1 scores
on this dataset as is conventional. (2) SemEval

2010 Task 8: The SemEval dataset is widely used
in recent work, but is significantly smaller with
8,000 examples for training and 2,717 for testing.
It contains 19 relation classes over untyped men-
tion pairs: 9 directed relations and a special Other
class. On SemEval, we follow the convention and
report the official macro-averaged F1 scores.

For fair comparisons on the TACRED dataset,
we follow the evaluation protocol used in (Zhang
et al., 2017) by selecting the model with the me-
dian dev F1 from 5 independent runs and report-
ing its test F1. We also use the same “entity mask”
strategy where we replace each subject (and ob-
ject similarly) entity with a special SUBJ-<NER>
token. For all models, we also adopt the “multi-
channel” strategy by concatenating the input word
embeddings with POS and NER embeddings.

Traditionally, evaluation on SemEval is con-
ducted without entity mentions masked. However,
as we will discuss in Section 6.4, this method en-
courages models to overfit to these mentions and
fails to test their actual ability to generalize. We
therefore report results with two evaluation proto-
cols: (1) with-mention, where mentions are kept
for comparison with previous work; and (2) mask-
mention, where they are masked to test the gener-
alization of our model in a more realistic setting.

Due to space limitations, we report model train-
ing details in the supplementary material.

outperforms all dependency-based models by at
least 1.6 F1. By using contextualized word rep-
resentations, the C-GCN model further outper-
forms the strong PA-LSTM model by 1.3 F1, and
achieves a new state of the art. In addition, we
find our model improves upon other dependency-
based models in both precision and recall. Com-
paring the C-GCN model with the GCN model,
we find that the gain mainly comes from improved
recall. We hypothesize that this is because the C-
GCN is more robust to parse errors by capturing
local word patterns (see also Section 6.2).

As we will show in Section 6.2, we find that
our GCN models have complementary strengths
when compared to the PA-LSTM. To leverage this
result, we experiment with a simple interpolation
strategy to combine these models. Given the out-
put probabilities PG(r|x) from a GCN model and
PS(r|x) from the sequence model for any relation
r, we calculate the interpolated probability as

P (r|x) = ↵ · PG(r|x) + (1� ↵) · PS(r|x)
where ↵ 2 [0, 1] is chosen on the dev set and set to
0.6. This simple interpolation between a GCN and
a PA-LSTM achieves an F1 score of 67.1, outper-
forming each model alone by at least 2.0 F1. An
interpolation between a C-GCN and a PA-LSTM
further improves the result to 68.2.

5.4 Results on the SemEval Dataset

To study the generalizability of our proposed
model, we also trained and evaluated our best C-
GCN model on the SemEval test set (Table 2). We
find that under the conventional with-entity eval-
uation, our C-GCN model outperforms all exist-
ing dependency-based neural models on this sep-

off-path information, our model outperforms the
previous shortest dependency path-based model
(SDP-LSTM). Under the mask-entity evaluation,
our C-GCN model also outperforms PA-LSTM by
a substantial margin, suggesting its generalizabil-
ity even when entities are not seen.

5.5 Effect of Path-centric Pruning

To show the effectiveness of path-centric prun-
ing, we compare the two GCN models and the
Tree-LSTM when the pruning distance K is var-
ied. We experimented with K 2 {0, 1, 2,1}
on the TACRED dev set, and also include results
when the full tree is used. As shown in Figure 3,
the performance of all three models peaks when
K = 1, outperforming their respective depen-
dency path-based counterpart (K = 0). This con-
firms our hypothesis in Section 3 that incorporat-
ing off-path information is crucial to relation ex-
traction. Miwa and Bansal (2016) reported that
a Tree-LSTM achieves similar performance when
the dependency path and the LCA subtree are used
respectively. Our experiments confirm this, and
further show that the result can be improved by
path-centric pruning with K = 1.

We find that all three models are less effective
when the entire dependency tree is present, indi-
cating that including extra information hurts per-
formance. Finally, we note that contextualizing
the GCN makes it less sensitive to changes in the
tree structures provided, presumably because the

pendency structure (i.e., setting Ã to I), the score
drops by 3.2 F1. (3) F1 drops by 10.3 when we
remove the feedforward layers, the LSTM compo-
nent and the dependency structure altogether. (4)
Removing the pruning (i.e., using full trees as in-
put) further hurts the result by another 9.7 F1.

6.2 Complementary Strengths of GCNs and
PA-LSTMs

To understand what the GCN models are capturing
and how they differ from a sequence model such
as the PA-LSTM, we compared their performance

Benoit B. Mandelbrot, a maverick 
mathematician who developed an innovative 
theory of roughness and applied it to physics, 
biology, finance and many other fields, died 
Thursday in Cambridge, Mass.

Anil Kumar, a former director at the consulting 
firm McKinsey & Co, pleaded guilty on 
Thursday to providing inside information to Raj 
Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group, 
in exchange for payments of at least $ 175 
million from 2004 through 2009.

In a career that spanned seven decades, Ginzburg
authored several groundbreaking studies in various 
fields -- such as quantum theory, astrophysics,

in the Earth's atmosphere -- that were of “Nobel 
Prize caliber,” said Gennady Mesyats, the director 
of the Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow, where 
Ginzburg worked .

Table 4: The three dependency edges that contribute the most to the classification of different relations in the
TACRED dev set. For clarity, we removed edges which 1) connect to common punctuation (i.e., commas, periods,
and quotation marks), 2) connect to common prepositions (i.e., of, to, by), and 3) connect between tokens within
the same entity. We use PER, ORG for entity types of PERSON, ORGANIZATION. We use S- and O- to denote
subject and object entities, respectively. We also include edges for more relations in the supplementary material.

over examples in the TACRED dev set. Specifi-
cally, for each model, we trained it for 5 indepen-
dent runs with different seeds, and for each exam-
ple we evaluated the model’s accuracy over these
5 runs. For instance, if a model correctly classifies
an example for 3 out of 5 times, it achieves an ac-
curacy of 60% on this example. We observe that
on 847 (3.7%) dev examples, our C-GCN model
achieves an accuracy at least 60% higher than that
of the PA-LSTM, while on 629 (2.8%) examples
the PA-LSTM achieves 60% higher. This comple-
mentary performance explains the gain we see in
Table 1 when the two models are combined.

We further show that this difference is due to
each model’s competitive advantage (Figure 4):
dependency-based models are better at handling
sentences with entities farther apart, while se-
quence models can better leverage local word pat-
terns regardless of parsing quality (see also Fig-
ure 6). We include further analysis in the supple-
mentary material.

6.3 Understanding Model Behavior
To gain more insights into the C-GCN model’s be-
havior, we visualized the partial dependency tree

it is processing and how much each token’s final
representation contributed to hsent (Figure 5). We
find that the model often focuses on the depen-
dency path, but sometimes also incorporates off-
path information to help reinforce its prediction.
The model also learns to ignore determiners (e.g.,
“the”) as they rarely affect relation prediction.

To further understand what dependency edges
contribute most to the classification of different re-
lations, we scored each dependency edge by sum-
ming up the number of dimensions each of its con-
nected nodes contributed to hsent. We present the
top scoring edges in Table 4. As can be seen in
the table, most of these edges are associated with
indicative nouns or verbs of each relation.5

6.4 Entity Bias in the SemEval Dataset

In our study, we observed a high correlation be-
tween the entity mentions in a sentence and its
relation label in the SemEval dataset. We exper-
imented with PA-LSTM models to analyze this

5We do notice the effect of dataset bias as well: the name
“Buffett” is too often associated with contexts where share-
holder relations hold, and therefore ranks top in that relation.

phenomenon.6 We started by simplifying every
sentence in the SemEval training and dev sets to
“subject and object”, where subject and object are
the actual entities in the sentence. Surprisingly,
a trained PA-LSTM model on this data is able to
achieve 65.1 F1 on the dev set if GloVe is used
to initialize word vectors, and 47.9 dev F1 even
without GloVe initialization. To further evaluate
the model in a more realistic setting, we trained
one model with the original SemEval training set
(unmasked) and one with mentions masked in the
training set, following what we have done for
TACRED (masked). While the unmasked model
achieves a 83.6 F1 on the original SemEval dev
set, F1 drops drastically to 62.4 if we replace dev
set entity mentions with a special <UNK> token
to simulate the presence of unseen entities. In con-
trast, the masked model is unaffected by unseen
entity mentions and achieves a stable dev F1 of
74.7. This suggests that models trained without
entities masked generalize poorly to new examples
with unseen entities. Our findings call for more
careful evaluation that takes dataset biases into ac-
count in future relation extraction studies.

7 Conclusion

We showed the success of a neural architecture
based on a graph convolutional network for re-
lation extraction. We also proposed path-centric
pruning to improve the robustness of dependency-
based models by removing irrelevant content with-
out ignoring crucial information. We showed
through detailed analysis that our model has com-
plementary strengths to sequence models, and that
the proposed pruning technique can be effectively
applied to other dependency-based models.
