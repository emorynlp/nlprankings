Abstract

The problem of the acquisition of Phono-
tactics in OT is shown to be not tractable
in its strong formulation, whereby con-
straints and generating function vary arbi-
trarily as inputs of the problem.

Tesar and Smolensky (1998) consider the ba-
sic ranking problem in Optimality Theory (OT).
According to this problem, the learner needs to
find a ranking consistent with a given set of data.
They show that this problem is solvable even in its
strong formulation, namely without any assump-
tions on the generating function or the constraint
set. Yet, this basic ranking problem is too sim-
ple to realistically model any actual aspect of lan-
guage acquisition. To make the problem more re-
alistic, we might want, for instance, to require the
learner to find not just any ranking consistent with
the data, rather one that furthermore generates a
smallest language (w.r.t. set inclusion). Prince and
Tesar (2004) and Hayes (2004) note that this com-
putational problem models the task of the acquisi-
tion of phonotactics within OT. This paper shows
that, contrary to the basic ranking problem consid-
ered by Tesar and Smolensky, this more realistic
problem of the acquisition of phonotactics is not
solvable, at least not in its strong formulation. I
conjecture that this complexity result has nothing
to do with the choice of the OT framework, namely
that an analogous result holds for the correspond-
ing problem within alternative frameworks, such
as Harmonic Grammar (Legendre et al., 1990b;
Legendre et al., 1990a). Furthermore, I conjec-
ture that the culprit lies with the fact that gener-
ating function and constraint set are completely
unconstrained. From this perspective, this paper
motivates the following research question: to find
phonologically plausible assumptions on generat-
ing function and constraint set that make the prob-
lem of the acquisition of phonotactics tractable.

1 Statement of the main result

Let the universal specifications of an OT typology
be a 4-tuple (X ,Y, Gen, C), as illustrated in (1):
X and Y are the sets of underlying and surface
forms; Gen is the generating function; and C is
the constraint set.

X = Y = {ta, da, rat, rad}
Gen =

ˆ
ta, da→ {ta, da} rat, rad→ {rat, rad} ˜

C =
8<:Fpos = IDNT[VCE]/ONSET,F = IDNT[VCE],M = ∗[+VCE, −SON]

9=;
(1)

Let�,�′, . . . be rankings over the constraint set,
as illustrated in (2) for the constraint set in (1).

Fpos �M � F Fpos �′ F �′ M (2)

Let OT� be the OT-grammar corresponding to a
ranking� (Prince and Smolensky, 2004), as illus-
trated in (3) for the ranking� in (2).

OT�(/ta/) = [ta] OT�(/da/) = [da]
OT�(/rat/) = [rat] OT�(/rad/) = [rat]

(3)

Let L(�) be the language corresponding to a
ranking�, illustrated in (4) for the rankings (2).

L(�) = {ta, da, rat}
L(�′) = {ta, da, rat, rad} (4)

A data set D is a finite set of pairs (x, ŷ) of an
underlying form x ∈ X and an intended winner
surface form ŷ∈Gen(x)⊆Y , as illustrated in (5).

D = {(/da/, [da]), (/rat/, [rat])} (5)

A data set D is called OT-compatible with a rank-
ing� iff the corresponding OT-grammar accounts
for all the pairs in D, namely OT�(x)= ŷ for ev-
ery pair (x, ŷ) ∈ D. A data set D is called OT-
compatible iff it is OT-compatible with at least a
ranking. Suppose that the actual universal specifi-
cations (X ,Y, Gen, C) are fixed and known. The

19



basic Ranking problem (Rpbm) is (6). The learner
is provided with a set of data D corresponding to
some target language; and has to come up with a
ranking compatible with those data D.

given: an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;
find: a ranking� over the constraint set

C that is OT-compatible with D.

(6)

At the current stage of the development of the
field, we have no firm knowledge of the actual
universal specifications. Thus, the Rpbm (6) is
of little interest. It is standard practice in the OT
computational literature to get around this diffi-
culty by switching to the strong formulation (7),
whereby the universal specifications vary arbitrar-
ily as an input to the problem (Wareham, 1998;
Eisner, 2000; Heinz et al., 2009). Switching from
(6) to (7) presupposes that the learner does not rely
on peculiar properties of the actual universal spec-
ifications.

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking� over the constraint set
C that is OT-compatible with D.

(7)

To complete the statement of the Rpbm (7), we
need to specify the size of its instances, that de-
termines the time that a solution algorithm is al-
lowed to take. Let width(D) be the cardinality of
the largest candidate set over all underlying forms
that appear in D, as stated in (8).

width(D) def= max(x,ŷ)∈D |Gen(x)| (8)
Of course, the size of an instance of the Rpbm (7)
depends on the cardinality |C| of the constraint set
and on the cardinality |D| of the data set. Tesar
and Smolensky (1998) (implicitly) assume that it
also depends on width(D), as stated in (9). 1

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking� of the constraint set C
that is OT-compatible with D;

size: max {|C|, |D|, width(D)}.

(9)

1A potential difficulty with the latter assumption is as
follows: width(D) could be very large, namely super-
polynomial in the number of constraints |C|; thus, letting the
size of an instance of the Rpbm depend on width(D) might
make the problem too easy, by loosening up too much the
tight dependence on |C|. Yet, this potential difficulty is harm-
less in the case of the strong formulation of the Rpbm, since
that formulation requires an algorithm to work for any univer-
sal specifications, and thus also for universal specifications
where |C| is large but width(D) small.

Tesar and Smolensky (1998) prove claim 1. This
claim is important because it shows that no harm
comes from switching to the strong formulation,
at least in the case of the Rpbm.
Claim 1 The Rpbm (9) is tractable.
Yet, the Rpbm (9) is way too simple to realisti-
cally model any aspect of acquisition. Here is a
way to appreciate this point. The two rankings
� and �′ in (2) are both solutions of the in-
stance of the Rpbm (9) corresponding to the uni-
versal specifications in (1) and to the data set in
(5). As noted in (4), the language correspond-
ing to � is a proper subset of the language cor-
responding to �′. A number of authors have
suggested that the ranking � that corresponds to
the subset language is a “better” solution than the
ranking �′ that corresponds to the superset lan-
guage (Berwick, 1985; Manzini and Wexler, 1987;
Prince and Tesar, 2004; Hayes, 2004). This intu-
ition is captured by problem (10): it asks not just
for any ranking OT-compatible with the data D;
rather, for one such ranking whose corresponding
language is as small as possible (w.r.t. set inclu-
sion). The latter condition requires the learner to
rule out as illicit any form which is not entailed by
the data. Problem (10) thus realistically models
the task of the acquisition of phonotactics, namely
the knowledge of licit vs. illicit forms.

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking � OT-comp. with D s.t.
there is no ranking �′ OT-comp.
with D too s.t. L(�′) $ L(�).

(10)

The Problem of the Acquisition of Phonotactics
(APpbm) in (10) involves the language L(�),
which in turn depends on the number of forms
in X and on the cardinality of the candidate set
Gen(x) for all underlying forms x∈X . Thus, (11)
lets the size of an instance of the APpbm depend
generously on |X | and width(X ), rather than on
|D| and width(D) as in the case of the Rpbm (9).2

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking � OT-comp. with D s.t.
there is no ranking �′ OT-comp.
with D too s.t. L(�′) $ L(�);

size: max {|C|, |X |, width(X )}.

(11)

2Letting the size of an instance of the APpbm depend on
|C|, |X | and width(X ) ensures that the problem is in NP ,
namely that it admits an efficient verification algorithm.

20



Prince and Tesar (2004) offer an alternative for-
mulation of the APpbm. They define a strictness
measure as a function µ that maps a ranking� to
a number µ(�) that provides a relative measure
of the cardinality of the corresponding language
L(�), in the sense that any solution of the prob-
lem (12) is a solution of the APpbm (10).3

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking with minimal measure µ
among those OT-comp. with D.

(12)

As usual, assume that the constraint set Con =
F ∪ M is split up into the subset F of faith-
fulness constraints and the subset M of marked-
ness constraints. Consider the function µPT de-
fined in (13): it pairs a ranking�with the number
µPT(�) of pairs of a faithfulness constraint and a
markedness constraint such that the former is�-
ranked above the latter. Prince and Tesar (2004)
conjecture that the function µPT in (13) is a strict-
ness measure. The intuition is that faithfulness
(markedness) constraints work toward (against)
preserving underlying contrasts and thus a small
language is likely to arise by having few pairs of a
faithfulness constraint ranked above a markedness
constraint.

µPT(�) def= |{(F,M)∈F×M|F �M}| (13)

Let me dub (12) with the mesure µPT in (13)
Prince and Tesar’s reformulation of the APpbm
(PTAPpbm), as in (14). The core idea of strictness
measures is to determine the relative strictness of
two rankings without reference to the entire set of
forms X . Thus, (14) lets the size of an instance
of PTAPpbm depend on |D| and width(D), rather
than on |X | and width(X ) as for the APpbm (11).

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;

find: a ranking with minimal measure
µPT among those OT-comp.withD;

size: max{|C|, |D|, width(D)}.

(14)

The APpbm (11) and the PTAPpbm (14) have fig-
ured prominently in the recent computational OT
literature. The main result of this paper is claim

3The Rpbm (7) corresponds to Empirical Risk Minimiza-
tion in the Statistical Learning literature, while problem (12)
corresponds to a regularized version thereof, with regulariza-
tion function µ.

2. This claim says that there is no efficient al-
gorithm for the APpbm nor for the PTAPpbm. I
conjecture that the culprit lies in the switch to
the strong formulation. Comparing with claim
1, I thus conclude that the switch is harmless for
the easy Rpbm, but harmful for the more realistic
APpbm and PTAPpbm.

Claim 2 The APpbm (11) and the PTAPpbm (14)
are intractable.

In the next section, I prove NP-completeness of
PTAPpbm by showing that the Cyclic Ordering
problem can be reduced to PTAPpbm. I then prove
NP-completeness of APpbm by showing that
PTAPpbm can be reduced to it. NP-completeness
of APpbm holds despite the generous dependence
of its size on |X | and width(X ). Furthermore, the
proof actually shows that the PTAPpbm remains
NP-complete even when the data have the sim-
plest “disjunctive structure”, namely for each un-
derlying/winner/loser form there are at most two
winner-preferring constrains.4 And furthermore
even when the data have the property that the faith-
fulness constraints are never loser-preferring.

2 Proof of the main result

Given a data set D, for every pair (x, ŷ) ∈ D of
an underlying form x and a corresponding winner
form ŷ, for every loser candidate y ∈Gen(x) dif-
ferent from ŷ, construct a row a with |C| entries as
follows: the kth entry is an L if constraint Ck as-
signs more violations to the winner pair (x, ŷ) than
to the loser pair (x, y); it is a W if the opposite
holds; it is an E if the two numbers of violations
coincide. Organize these rows one underneath the
other into a tableau A(D), called the comparative
tableau corresponding toD. To illustrate, I give in
(15) the tableau corresponding to the data set (5).

A(D) =
[ F Fpos M

W W L

W E W

]
(15)

Generalizing a bit, let A ∈ {L, E, W}m×n be a
tableau withm rows, n columns, and entries taken
from the three symbols L, E or W, called a compar-
ative tableau. Let me say that A is OT-compatible
with a ranking � iff the tableau obtained by re-
ordering the columns of A from left-to-right in

4Of course, if there were a unique winner-preferring con-
straint per underlying/winner/loser form triplet, then the data
would be OT-compatible with a unique ranking, and thus the
PTAPpbm would reduce to the Rpbm.

21



decreasing order according to� has the property
that the left-most entry different from E is a W in
every row. Tesar and Smolensky (1998) note that
a data set D is OT-compatible with a ranking �
iff the corresponding comparative tableau A(D)
is OT-compatible with it. Thus, the PTAPpbm
(14) is tractable iff the problem (16) is tractable.
Note that this equivalence crucially depends on
two facts. First, that the size of an instance of the
PTAPpbm depends not only on |C| and |D|, but
also on width(D). Second, that we are consider-
ing the strong formulation of the PTAPpbm, and
thus no assumptions need to be imposed on the
given comparative tableau in (16), besides it being
OT-compatible. The set F provided with an in-
stance of (16) says which one of the n columns of
the comparative tableau A correspond to faithful-
ness constraints. The size of an instance of prob-
lem (16) of course depends on the numbers m and
n of rows and columns of A.

given: a OT-comp. tabl.A∈{L, E,W}m×n,
a set F ⊆ {1, . . . , n};

find: a ranking � with minimal measure
µPT among those OT-comp. with A;

size: max{m, n}.

(16)

The decision problem corresponding to (16) is
stated in (17). As it is well known, intractability
of the decision problem (17) entails intractability
of the original problem (16). In fact, if the original
problem (16) can be solved in polynomial time,
then the corresponding decision problem (17) can
be solved in polynomial time too: given an in-
stance of the decision problem (17), find a solution
� of the corresponding instance of (16) and then
just check whether µPT(�) ≤ k. From now on, I
will refer to (17) as the PTAPpbm.

given: a OT-comp. tabl. A∈{L, E,W}m×n,
a set F ⊆ {1, . . . , n},
an integer k;

output: “yes” iff there is a ranking� OT-
comp. with A s.t. µPT(�) ≤ k;

size: max{m, n}.

(17)

Let me now introduce the problem I will reduce
to PTAPpbm. Given a finite set A = {a, b, . . .}
with cardinality |A|, consider a set S ⊆ A×A of
pairs of elements of A. The set S is called linearly
compatible iff there exists a one-to-one function
π : A → {1, 2, . . . , |A|} such that for every pair
(a, b) ∈ S we have π(a) < π(b). It is useful to

let S be not just a set but a multiset, namely to
allow S to contain multiple instances of the same
pair. The notion of cardinality and the subset re-
lation are trivially extended from sets to multisets.
Consider the problem (18), that I will call the Max-
ordering problem (MOpbm).

given: a finite set A,
a multiset P ⊆ A×A,
an integer k ≤ |P |;

output: “yes” iff there is a linearly compat-
ible multiset S ⊆ P with |S| ≥ k;

size: max {|A|, |P |}.

(18)

The PTAPpbm (17) is clearly in NP , namely it
admits a verification algorithm. Claim 3 ensures
that MOpbm (18) is NP-complete. Claim 4 shows
that MOpbm can be reduced to PTAPpbm (17). I
can thus conclude that PTAPpbm is NP-complete.

Claim 3 The MOpbm (18) is NP-complete.5

Proof. The MOpbm is obviously in NP . To show
that it is NP-complete, I need to exhibit an NP-
complete problem that can be reduced to it. Given
a finite set A = {a, b, . . .} with cardinality |A|,
consider a set T ⊆ A × A × A of triplets of el-
ements of A. The set T is called linearly cycli-
cally compatible iff there exists a one-to-one func-
tion π : A → {1, 2, . . . , |A|} such that for ev-
ery triplet (a, b, c) ∈ T either π(a)< π(b)< π(c)
or π(b) < π(c) < π(a) or π(c) < π(a) < π(b).
Consider the Cyclic Ordering problem (COpbm)
in (19).6 Galil and Megiddo (1977) prove NP-
completeness of COpbm by reduction from the
3-Satisfability problem; the COpbm is problem
[MS2] in (Garey and Johnson, 1979, p. 279).

input: a finite set A;
a set T ⊆ A×A×A;

output: “yes” iff T is linearly cyclically
compatible;

size: |A|

(19)

Given an instance (A, T ) of the COpbm (19), con-
sider the corresponding instance (A,P, k) of the
MOpbm (18) defined as in (20). For every triplet

5A similar claim appears in (Cohen et al., 1999).
6It makes sense to let the size of an instance of the COpbm

(19) be just the cardinality of the setA. In fact, the cardinality
of the set T can be at most |A|3. On the other hand, it makes
sense to let the size of an instance of the MOpbm (18) depend
also on the cardinality of the multiset P rather than only on
the cardinality of the set A, since P is a multiset and thus its
cardinality cannot be bound by the cardinality of A.

22



(a, b, c) in the set T , we put in the multiset P
the three pairs (a, b), (b, c) and (c, a). Further-
more, we set the threshold k to twice the number
of triplets in the set T . Note that P is a multiset
because it might contain two instances of the same
pair coming from two different triplets in T .

P =
{

(a, b), (b, c), (c, a)
∣∣∣ (a, b, c) ∈ T}

k = 2|T |
(20)

Assume that the instance (A, T ) of the COpbm
admits a positive answer. Thus, T is cyclically
compatible with a linear order π on A. Thus, for
every triplet (a, b, c) ∈ T , there are at least two
pairs in P compatible with π. Hence, there is a
multiset S of pairs of P with cardinality at least
k = 2|T | linearly compatible with π,7 namely the
instance of the MOpbm defined in (20) admits a
positive answer. Vice versa, assume that the in-
stance (A,P, k) of the MOpbm in (20) admits a
positive answer. Thus, there exists a linear order
π on A compatible with 2|T | pairs in P . Since
the three pairs that come from a given triplet are
inconsistent, then each triplet must contribute two
pairs to the total of 2|T | compatible pairs. Hence,
π is cyclically compatible with all triplets in T . �
Claim 4 The MOpbm (18) can be reduced to the
PTAPpbm (17).

Proof. Given an instance (A,P, k) of the MOpbm,
construct the corresponding instance (A,F ,K) of
the PTAPpbm as follows. Let n = |A|, ` = |P |;
pick an integer d as in (21).

d > (`− k)n (21)

Let the threshold K and the numbers N and M of
columns and rows of the tableau A be as in (22).

K = (`− k)(n+ d)
N = `+ n+ d
M = `+ nd

(22)

Let the sets F andM of faithfulness and marked-
ness constraints be as in (23). There is a faith-
fulness constraint F(i,j) for every pair (ai, aj)
in the multiset P in the given instance of the
MOpbm. Markedness constraints come in two
varieties. There are the markedness constraints

7Note that, in order for the latter claim to hold, it is cru-
cial that P be a multiset, namely that the same pair might be
counted twice. In fact, T might contain two different triplets
that share some elements, such as (a, b, c) and (a, b, d).

M1, . . . ,Mn, one for every element in the set A in
the given instance of the MOpbm; and then there
are d more markedness constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d,
that I’ll call the ballast markedness constraints.

F = {F(i,j) | (ai, aj) ∈ P}
M = {M1, . . . ,Mn} ∪ {M ′1, . . . ,M ′d}

(23)

The comparative tableau A is built by assembling
one underneath the other various blocks. To start,
let A be the block with ` rows and N = `+n+d
columns described in (24). It has a row for every
pair (ai, aj)∈P . This row has all E’s but for three
entries: the entry corresponding to the faithfulness
constraint F(i,j) corresponding to that pair, which
is a W; the entry corresponding to the markedness
constraintMi corresponding to the first element ai
in the pair, which is an L; the entry corresponding
to the markedness constraint Mj corresponding to
the second element aj in the pair, which is a W.

Next, let Ai be the block with d rows and N =
` + n + d columns described in (25), for every
i = 1, . . . , n. All entries corresponding to the
faithfulness constraints are equal to E. All en-
tries corresponding to the the markedness con-
straints M1, . . . ,Mn are equal to E, but for those
in the column corresponding to Mi, that are in-
stead equal to W. All entries corresponding to the
ballast constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d are equal to E, but
for the diagonal entries that are instead equal to L.

(26)

Since the markedness constraints M1, . . . ,Mn
correspond to the elements a1, . . . , an of A, a lin-
ear order π over A defines a ranking � of the
markedness constraintM1, . . . ,Mn as in (27), and
viceversa. Thus, π is linearly compatible with a
pair (ai, aj) ∈ P iff the row of the block A in
(24) corresponding to that pair is accounted for
by ranking Mj above Mi, with no need for the
corresponding faithfulness constraint F(i,j) to do
any work. Suppose instead that Mj is not ranked
above Mi, so that the corresponding faithfulness
constraint F(i,j) needs to be ranked above Mi in
order to protect its L. What consequences does this
fact have for the measure µPT in (13)? Without
the ballast constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d, not much: all
I could conclude is that the faithfulness constraint
F(i,j) has at least the two markedness constraints
Mi and Mj ranked below it. The ballast marked-
ness constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d ensure a more dra-
matic effect. In fact, the block Ai forces each of
them to be ranked below Mi. Thus, if the faithful-
ness constraint F(i,j) needs to be ranked aboveMi,
then it also needs to be ranked above all the ballast
markedness constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d. If the num-
ber d of these ballast constraints is large enough,
as in (21), then the corresponding effect on the
measure µPT in (13) is rather dramatic.

Mj �Mi ⇐⇒ π(aj) > π(ai) (27)
Assume that the given instance (A,P, k) of
MOpbm admits a positive answer. Thus, there ex-
ists a multitset S of k pairs of P that is compatible
with a linear order π on A. Consider a ranking�
over the constraint set (23) that satisfies the con-
ditions in (28): � assigns the k faithfulness con-
straints F(i,j) that correspond to pairs in S to the k
bottom strata, in any order;� assigns the d ballast

markedness constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d to the next d
strata, in any order; � assigns the n markedness
constraints M1, . . . ,Mn to the next n strata, or-
dered according to π through (27); finally, � as-
signs the remaining ` − k faithfulness constraints
F(i,j) that correspond to pairs in P \ S to the top
`− k strata, in any order.

{F(i,j) | (ai, aj) 6∈ S}
Mπ−1(n)

. . .

Mπ−1(1)

{M ′1, . . . ,M ′d}
{F(i,j) | (ai, aj) ∈ S}

(28)

This ranking � is OT-compatible with the com-
parative tableau A in (26). In fact, it is OT-
compatible with the n blocks A1, . . . ,An in (25),
since the markedness constraints M1, . . . ,Mn
are �-ranked above the ballast markedness con-
straints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d. It is OT-compatible with
each row of the block A in (24) that corresponds
to a pair (ai, aj) 6∈ S, since the corresponding
faithfulness constraint F(i,j) is �-ranked above
the corresponding markedness constraints Mi. Fi-
nally, it is OT-compatible with each row of the
block A that corresponds to a pair (ai, aj) ∈ S,
since π(aj)> π(ai) and thus Mj � Mi by (27).
The measure µPT(�) of the ranking� is (29): in
fact, the faithfulness constraints F(i,j) correspond-
ing to pairs (ai, aj)∈S have no markedness con-
straints�-ranked below them; and each one of the
`− k faithfulness constraints F(i,j) corresponding
to pairs (ai, aj) 6∈S has all the n + d markedness
constraints�-ranked below it. In conclusion, the
instance (A,F ,K) of the PTAPpbm constructed
in (21)-(26) admits a positive answer.

µPT(�) = (`− k)(n+ d) = K (29)
Vice versa, assume that the instance (A, F , K)
of the PTAPpbm constructed in (21)-(26) admits
a positive answer. Thus, there exists a ranking�
over the constraint set (23) OT-compatible with the
tableau A in (26) such that µPT(�) ≤ K. Con-
sider the multiset S ⊆ P defined in (30). Clearly,
S is compatible with the linear order π univocally
defined on A = {a1, . . . , an} through (27).

(ai, aj) ∈ P

To prove that the given instance (A,P, k) of the
MOpbm has a positive answer, I thus only need
to show that |S| ≥ k. Assume by contradiction
that |S| < k. I can then compute as in (31). In
step (31a), I have used the definition (22) of the
threshold K. In step (31b), I have used the hy-
pothesis that the ranking � is a solution of the
instance (A, F , K) of the PTAPpbm and thus its
mesure µPT does not exceed K. By (13), µPT(�)
is the total number of pairs of a faithfulness con-
straint and a markedness constraint such that the
former is�-ranked above the latter. In step (31c),
I have thus lower bounded µPT(�) by only con-
sidering those faithfulness constraints F(i,j) cor-
responding to pairs (ai, aj) not in S. For each
such constraint F(i,j), we have Mi � Mj , by
the definition (30) of S. Thus, F(i,j) needs to
be �-ranked above Mi in order to ensure OT-
compatibility with the corresponding row of the
block A in (24). Since Mi needs to be�-ranked
above the d ballast constraints M ′1, . . . ,M ′d in or-
der to ensure OT-compatibility with the block Ai
in (25), then F(i,j) needs to be �-ranked above
those d ballast markedness constraints too. In con-
clusion, each faithfulness constraint F(i,j) corre-
sponding to a pair (ai, aj) not in S needs to be
�-ranked at least above dmarkedness constraints.
Since there are `−|S| such faithfulness constraint
F(i,j) corresponding to a pair (ai, aj) 6∈S, then we
get the inequality in (31d). In step (31e), I have
used the absurd hypothesis that |S| < k or equiv-
alently that |S| ≤ k − 1. The chain of inequalities
in (31) entails that d ≤ (` − k)n, which contra-
dicts the choice (21) of the number d of ballast
constraints.

The preceding considerations show that given
an arbitrary instance (A,P, k) of the MOpbm
(18), the corresponding instance (A,F ,K) of the
PTAPpbm (17) defined in (21)-(26) admits a pos-
itive solution iff the original instance (A,P, k) of

the MOpbm does. I conclude that the MOpbm can
be reduced to the PTAPpbm. �
Let me now turn to the APpbm (11). Once again,
in order to show that it is intractable, it is sufficient
to show that the corresponding decision problem
(32) is intractable. In fact, if problem (11) can be
solved, then (32) can be solved too: given an in-
stance of the latter, find a solution � of the cor-
responding instance of the problem (11) and then
just check whether |L(�)| ≤ k.8 From now on, I
will refer to (32) as the APpbm.

given: univ. specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y ,
an integer k;

output: “yes” iff there is a ranking � OT-
comp. with D s.t. the correspond-
ing language L(�) has cardinality
at most k;

size: max {|C|, |X |, width(X )}.

(32)

The APpbm (32) is clearly in NP , namely it
admits a verification algorithm. The following
claim 5 together with the NP-completeness of
PTAPpbm, entails that the APpbm is NP-complete
too, thus completing the proof of claim 2.

Claim 5 The PTAPpbm (17) can be reduced to the
APpbm (32).

Proof. Given an instance (A, F , k) of the
PTAPpbm (17), construct the corresponding in-
stance ((X , Y, Gen, C), D, K) of the APpbm
(32) as follows. Let m and n be the number of
rows and of columns of the comparative tableau
A; let ` be the cardinality of the set F ; let d =
`(n− `). Define the threshold K as in (33).

K = m+ k + d (33)

Define the sets X and Y of underlying and surface
forms as in (34).

X = {x1, . . . , xm} ∪ {x′1, . . . , x′d} ∪ {x′′1, . . . , x′′d}| | |
X1 X2 X3

Y =
{
y1, . . . , ym
z1, . . . , zm

}
∪
{
u1, . . . , ud
v1, . . . , vd

}
∪
{
u1, . . . , ud
w1, . . . , wd

}
| | |
Y1 Y2 Y3

(34)
8The generous dependence of the size of the APpbm (11)

on |X | andwidth(X ) provides us with sufficient time to triv-
ially compute the language L(�).

Define the generating function Gen as in (35).

Gen(xi) = {yi, zi} ⊆ Y1 for xi ∈ X1
Gen(x′i) = {ui, vi} ⊆ Y2 for x′i ∈ X2
Gen(x′′i ) = {ui, wi} ⊆ Y3 for x′′i ∈ X3

(35)

Define the data set D as in (36).

D = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)} (36)

Let the constraint set C contain a total of n con-
straints C1, . . . , Cn; let Ch be a faithfulness con-
straint iff h ∈ F , and a markedness constraint oth-
erwise. Since, Gen(Xi) ⊆ Yi, constraints need
only be defined on Xi × Yj with i = j. The set
X1 contains m underlying forms x1, . . . xm, one
for every row of the given comparative tableau A.
Each of these underlying forms xi comes with the
two candidates yi and zi. The data set D in (36)
is a subset of X1 × Y1. Define the constraints
C1, . . . , Cn overX1×Y1 as in (37). This definition
ensures that A is the comparative tableau corre-
sponding to D, so that (40) holds for any ranking.

� is OT-comp. with A iff� is OT-
comp. with D

(40)

The set X2 contains a total of d = `(n − `) un-
derlying forms x′1, . . . , x′2, one for every pair of
a faithfulness constraint and a markedness con-
straint. Pair up (in some arbitrary but fixed way)
each of these underlying forms with a unique pair
of a faithfulness constraint and a markedness con-
straint. Thus, I can speak of “the” markedness
constraint and “the” faithfulness constraint “cor-
responding” to a given underlying form x′i ∈X2.
Each of these underlying forms x′i comes with
two candidates ui and vi. Define the constraints
C1, . . . , Cn over X2 × Y2 as in (38). This defini-
tion ensures that the grammar OT� corresponding
to an arbitrary ranking�maps x′i to vi rather than
to ui iff the faithfulness constraint corresponding

to the underlying form x′i is �-ranked above the
markedness constraint corresponding to x′i. Since
µPT(�) is defined in (13) as the total number of
pairs of a faithfulness and a markedness constraint
such that the former is ranked above the latter, then
condition (41) holds for any ranking.

µPT(�) = |{x′i∈X2 |OT�(x′i) = vi}| (41)
Finally, define the constraints C1, . . . , Cn over
X3 × Y3 as in (38). This definition ensures that
the forms u1, . . . , ud are unmarked — as the forms
[ta] and [rat] in the typology in (1). Thus, they be-
long to the language corresponding to any ranking
�, as stated in (42).

{u1, . . . , ud} ⊆ L(�) (42)
Assume that the instance (A,F , k) of the
PTAPpbm admits a positive answer. Thus, there
exists a ranking � OT-compatible with the com-
parative tableau A such that µPT(�) ≤ k. Since
� is OT-compatible with A, then � is OT-
compatible with D, by (40). Furthermore, the lan-
guage L(�) corresponding to the ranking� con-
tains at most K = m + k + d surface forms,
namely: the m surface forms y1, . . . , ym ∈ Y1,
because� is OT-compatible withD; the d surface
forms u1, . . . , ud, by (42); and at most k of the sur-
face forms v1, . . . , vd, by (41) and the hypothesis
that µPT(�) ≤ k. Thus, � is a solution of the
instance ((X , Y, Gen, C), D, K) of the APpbm
(32) constructed in (33)-(39). The same reasoning
shows that the vice versa holds too. �
