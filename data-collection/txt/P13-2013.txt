Abstract

We present a reformulation of the word
pair features typically used for the task
of disambiguating implicit relations in the
Penn Discourse Treebank. Our word pair
features achieve significantly higher per-
formance than the previous formulation
when evaluated without additional fea-
tures. In addition, we present results
for a full system using additional features
which achieves close to state of the art per-
formance without resorting to gold syntac-
tic parses or to context outside the relation.

1 Introduction

Discourse relations such as contrast and causal-
ity are part of what makes a text coherent. Be-
ing able to automatically identify these relations
is important for many NLP tasks such as gener-
ation, question answering and textual entailment.
In some cases, discourse relations contain an ex-
plicit marker such as but or because which makes
it easy to identify the relation. Prior work (Pitler
and Nenkova, 2009) showed that where explicit
markers exist, the class of the relation can be dis-
ambiguated with f-scores higher than 90%.

Predicting the class of implicit discourse rela-
tions, however, is much more difficult. Without an
explicit marker to rely on, work on this task ini-
tially focused on using lexical cues in the form
of word pairs mined from large corpora where
they appear around an explicit marker (Marcu and
Echihabi, 2002). The intuition is that these pairs
will tend to represent semantic relationships which
are related to the discourse marker (for example,
word pairs often appearing around but may tend
to be antonyms). While this approach showed
some success and has been used extensively in
later work, it has been pointed out by multiple
authors that many of the most useful word pairs

are pairs of very common functional words, which
contradicts the original intuition, and it is hard to
explain why these are useful.

In this work we focus on the task of identi-
fying and disambiguating implicit discourse rela-
tions which have no explicit marker. In particular,
we present a reformulation of the word pair fea-
tures that have most often been used for this task
in the past, replacing the sparse lexical features
with dense aggregated score features. This is the
main contribution of our paper. We show that our
formulation outperforms the original one while re-
quiring less features, and that using a stop list of
functional words does not significantly affect per-
formance, suggesting that these features indeed
represent semantically related content word pairs.

In addition, we present a system which com-
bines these word pairs with additional features to
achieve near state of the art performance without
the use of syntactic parse features and of context
outside the arguments of the relation. Previous
work has attributed much of the achieved perfor-
mance to these features, which are easy to get in
the experimental setting but would be less reliable
or unavailable in other applications.1

2 Related Work

This line of research began with (Marcu and Echi-
habi, 2002), who used a small number of unam-
biguous explicit markers and patterns involving
them, such as [Arg1, but Arg2] to collect sets of
word pairs from a large corpus using the cross-
product of the words in Arg1 and Arg2. The au-
thors created a feature out of each pair and built a
naive bayes model directly from the unannotated
corpus, updating the priors and posteriors using
maximum likelihood. While they demonstrated

1Reliable syntactic parses are not always available in do-
mains other than newswire, and context (preceding relations,
especially explicit relations) is not always available in some
applications such as generation and question answering.

some success, their experiments were run on data
that is unnatural in two ways. First, it is balanced.
Second, it is constructed with the same unsuper-
vised method they use to extract the word pairs -
by assuming that the patterns correspond to a par-
ticular relation and collecting the arguments from
an unannotated corpus. Even if the assumption is
correct, these arguments are really taken from ex-
plicit relations with their markers removed, which
as others have pointed out (Blair-Goldensohn et
al., 2007; Pitler et al., 2009) may not look like true
implicit relations.

More recently, implicit relation prediction has
been evaluated on annotated implicit relations
from the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al.,
2008). PDTB uses hierarchical relation types
which abstract over other theories of discourse
such as RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987) and
SDRT (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). It contains
40, 600 annotated relations from the WSJ corpus.
Each relation has two arguments, Arg1 and Arg2,
and the annotators decide whether it is explicit or
implicit.

The first to evaluate directly on PDTB in a re-
alistic setting were Pitler et al. (2009). They used
word pairs as well as additional features to train
four binary classifiers, each corresponding to one
of the high-level PDTB relation classes. Although
other features proved to be useful, word pairs were
still the major contributor to most of these clas-
sifiers. In fact, their best system for comparison
included only the word pair features, and for all
other classes other than expansion the word pair
features alone achieved an f-score within 2 points
of the best system. Interestingly, they found that
training the word pair features on PDTB itself was
more useful than training them on an external cor-
pus like Marcu and Echihabi (2002), although in
some cases they resort to information gain in the
external corpus for filtering the word pairs.

Zhou et al. (2010) used a similar method and
added features that explicitly try to predict the
implicit marker in the relation, increasing perfor-
mance. Most recently to the best of our knowl-
edge, Park and Cardie (2012) achieved the highest
performance by optimizing the feature set. An-
other work evaluating on PDTB is (Lin et al.,
2009), who are unique in evaluating on the more
fine-grained second-level relation classes.

3 Word Pairs

3.1 The Problem: Sparsity
While Marcu and Echihabi (2002)’s approach of
training a classifier from an unannotated corpus
provides a relatively large amount of training data,
this data does not consist of true implicit relations.
However, the approach taken by Pitler et al. (2009)
and repeated in more recent work (training directly
on PDTB) is problematic as well: when training a
model with so many sparse features on a dataset
the size of PDTB (there are 22, 141 non-explicit
relations overall), it is likely that many important
word pairs will not be seen in training.

In fact, even the larger corpus of Marcu and
Echihabi (2002) may not be quite large enough
to solve the sparsity issue, given that the num-
ber of word pairs is quadratic in the vocabulary.
Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) report that using
even a very small stop list (25 words) significantly
reduces performance, which is counter-intuitive.
They attribute this finding to the sparsity of the
feature space. An analysis in (Pitler et al., 2009)
also shows that the top word pairs (ranked by
information gain) all contain common functional
words, and are not at all the semantically-related
content words that were imagined. In the case
of some reportedly useful word pairs (the-and; in-
the; the-of...) it is hard to explain how they might
affect performance except through overfitting.

3.2 The Solution: Aggregation
Representing each word pair as a single feature has
the advantage of allowing the weights for each pair
to be learned directly from the data. While pow-
erful, this approach requires large amounts of data
to be effective.

Another possible approach is to aggregate some
of the pairs together and learn weights from the
data only for the aggregated sets of words. For this
approach to be effective, the pairs we choose to
group together should have similar meaning with
regard to predicting the relation.

Biran and Rambow (2011) is to our knowledge
the only other work utilizing a similar approach.
They used aggregated word pair set features to
predict whether or not a sentence is argumentative.
Their method is to group together word pairs that
have been collected around the same explicit dis-
course marker: for every discourse marker such
as therefore or however, they have a single fea-
ture whose value depends only on the word pairs

70



collected around that marker. This is reasonable
given the intuition that the marker pattern is unam-
biguous and points at a particular relation. Using
one feature per marker can be seen as analogous
(yet complementary) to Zhou et al. (2010)’s ap-
proach of trying to predict the implicit connective
by giving a score to each marker using a language
model.

This work uses binary features which only in-
dicate the appearance of one or more of the pairs.
The original frequencies of the word pairs are not
used anywhere. A more powerful approach is to
use an informed function to weight the word pairs
used inside each feature.

3.3 Our Approach

Our approach is similar in that we choose to ag-
gregate word pairs that were collected around the
same explicit marker. We first assembled a list of
all 102 discourse markers used in PDTB, in both
explicit and implicit relations.2

Next, we extract word pairs for each marker
from the Gigaword corpus by taking the cross
product of words that appear in a sentence around
that marker. This is a simpler approach than us-
ing patterns - for example, the marker because can
appear in two patterns: [Arg1 because Arg2] and
[because Arg1, Arg2], and we only use the first.
We leave the task of listing the possible patterns
for each of the 102 markers to future work because
of the significant manual effort required. Mean-
while, we rely on the fact that we use a very large
corpus and hope that the simple pattern [Arg1
marker Arg2] is enough to make our features use-
ful. There are, of course, markers for which this
pattern does not normally apply, such as by com-
parison or on one hand. We expect these features
to be down-weighted by the final classifier, as ex-
plained at the end of this section. When collect-
ing the pairs, we stem the words and discard pairs
which appear only once around the marker.

We can think of each discourse marker as hav-
ing a corresponding unordered “document”, where
each word pair is a term with an associated fre-
quency. We want to create a feature for each
marker such that for each data instance (that is,
for each potential relation in the PDTB data) the
value for the feature is the relevance of the marker
document to the data instance.

2in implicit relations, there is no marker in the text but the
implicit marker is provided by the human annotators

Each data instance in PDTB consists of two ar-
guments, and can therefore also be represented
as a set of word pairs extracted from the cross-
product of the two arguments. To represent the rel-
evance of the instance to each marker, we set the
value of the marker feature to the cosine similarity
of the data instance and the marker’s “document”,
where each word pair is a dimension.

While the terms (i.e. word pairs) of the
data instance are weighted by simple occurence
count, we weight the terms in each marker’s
document with tf-idf, where tf is defined in
one of two ways: normalized term frequency
( count(t)max{count(s,d):s∈d}) and pointwise mutual infor-

mation (log count(t)count(w1)∗count(w2)), where w1 and w2
are the member words of the pair. Idf is calculated
normally given that the set of all documents is de-
fined as the 102 marker documents.

We then train a binary classifier (logistic regres-
sion) using these 102 features for each of the four
high-level relations in PDTB: comparison, con-
tingency, expansion and temporal. To make sure
our results are comparable to previous work, we
treat EntRel relations as instances of expansion
and use sections 2-20 for training and sections 21-
22 for testing. We use a ten fold stratified cross-
validation of the training set for development. Ex-
plicit relations are excluded from all data sets.

As mentioned earlier, there are markers that do
not fit the simple pattern we use. In particular,
some markers always or often appear as the first
term of a sentence. For these, we expect the list of
word pairs to be empty or almost empty, since in
most sentences there are no words on the left (and
recall that we discard pairs that appear only once).
Since the features created for these markers will
be uninformative, we expect them to be weighted
down by the classifier and have no significant ef-
fect on prediction.

4 Evaluation of Word Pairs

For our main evaluation, we evaluate the perfor-
mance of word pair features when used with no
additional features. Results are shown in Table 1.
Our word pair features outperform the previous
formulation (represented by the results reported by
(Pitler et al., 2009), but used by virtually all previ-
ous work on this task). For most relation classes,
tf is significantly better than pmi. 3

We also show results using a stop list of 50 com-
mon functional words. The stop list has only a
small effect on performance except in the tempo-
ral class. This may be because of functional words
like was and will which have a temporal effect.

5 Other Features

For our secondary evaluation, we include addi-
tional features to complement the word pairs. Pre-
vious work has relied on features based on the gold
parse trees of the Penn Treebank (which overlaps
with PDTB) and on contextual information from
relations preceding the one being disambiguated.
We intentionally limit ourselves to features that do
not require either so that our system can be readily
used on arbitrary argument pairs.
WordNet Features: We define four features
based on WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) - Synonyms,
Antonyms, Hypernyms and Hyponyms. The values
are the counts of word pairs in the cross-product of
the words in the arguments that have the particular
relation (synonymy, antonymy etc) between them.
Verb Class: This is the count of pairs of verbs
from Arg1 and Arg2 that share the same class, de-

fined as the highest level Levin verb class (Levin,
1993) from the LCS database (Dorr, 2001).
Money, Percentages and Numbers (MPN): The
counts of currency symbols/abbreviations, per-
centage signs or cues (“percent”, “BPS”...) and
numbers in each argument.
Modality: Presence or absence of each English
modal in each argument.
Polarity: Based on MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005).
We include the counts of positive and negative
words according to the MPQA subjectivity lexicon
for both arguments. Unlike Pitler et al. (2009), we
do not use neutral polarity features. We also do not
explicitly group negation with polarity (although
we do have separate negation features).
Affect: Based on the Dictionary of Affect in Lan-
guage (Whissell, 1989). Each word in the DAL
gets a score for three dimensions - pleasantness
(pleasant - unpleasant), activation (passive - ac-
tive) and imagery (hard to imagine - easy to imag-
ine). We use the average score for each dimension
in each argument as a feature.
Content Similarity: We use the cosine similarity
and word overlap of the arguments as features.
Negation: Presence or absence of negation terms
in each of the arguments.
Length: The ratio between the lengths (counts of
words) of the arguments.

6 Evaluation of Additional Features

For our secondary evaluation, we present results
for each feature category on its own in Table 3 and
for our best system for each of the relation classes
in Table 2. We show results for the best systems
from (Pitler et al., 2009), (Zhou et al., 2010) and

72



(Park and Cardie, 2012) for comparison.

7 Conclusion

We presented an aggregated approach to word pair
features and showed that it outperforms the previ-
ous formulation for all relation types but contin-
gency. This is our main contribution. With this
approach, using a stop list does not have a major
effect on results for most relation classes, which
suggests most of the word pairs affecting perfor-
mance are content word pairs which may truly be
semantically related to the discourse structure.

In addition, we introduced the new and useful
WordNet, Affect, Length and Negation feature cat-
egories. Our final system outperformed the best
system from Pitler et al. (2009), who used mostly
similar features, for comparison and temporal and
is competitive with the most recent state of the
art systems for contingency and expansion with-
out using any syntactic or context features.
