Abstract

We investigate methods for evaluating
agreement among a relatively large group
of annotators who have not received exten-
sive training and differ in terms of ability
and motivation. We show that it is possi-
ble to isolate a reliable subgroup of anno-
tators, so that aspects of the difficulty of
the underlying task can be studied. Our
task is to annotate the argumentative struc-
ture of short texts.

1 Introduction

Scenarios for evaluating annotation experiments
differ in terms of the difficulty of the task, the
number of annotators, and the amount of training
that annotators receive. For simple tasks, crowd-
sourcing involving very many annotators has re-
cently attracted attention.1 For more difficult
tasks, the standard setting still is to work with
two or a few more annotators, train them well,
and compute agreement, usually in terms of the
kappa measure. In this paper, we study a dif-
ferent scenario, which may be called ‘classroom
annotation’: The group of annotators is bigger
(in our example, 26), and there are no extensive
training sessions: Students receive detailed writ-
ten guidelines, there is a brief QA period, and an-
notation starts. In such a setting, one has to expect
some agreement problems that are due to different
abilities and different motivation of the students.
Our goal is to develop methods for systematically
studying the annotation results in such groups, to
identify more or less competent subgroups, yet at
the same time also learn about the difficulty of var-
ious aspects of the underlying annotation task. To
this end, we investigate ways of ranking and clus-
tering annotators.

1See, for instance, Snow et al. (2008) or Bhardwaj et al.
(2010) for strategies to analyse and cope with diverging per-
formance of annotators in that scenario.

Our task is the annotation of argumentation in
short texts, which is somewhat similar to mark-
ing the rhetorical structure, e.g. in terms of RST
(Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al., 2003).
Thus we are dealing with a relatively difficult task
involving text interpretation. We devised an an-
notation scheme (which is more fully described
elsewhere), and in order to study the feasibility,
first ran experiments with short hand-crafted texts
that collectively cover all the relevant phenom-
ena. This is the setting we report in this paper. A
separate step for future work is guideline revision
on the basis of the results, and then applying the
scheme to authentic argumentative text (e.g., user
generated content on various websites).

2 A theory of argumentation structure

Following up on Toulmin’s (1958) influential anal-
ysis of argument, Freeman (1991; 2011) worked
on integrating those ideas into the argument dia-
graming techniques of the informal logic tradition.
Freeman’s central idea is to model argumentation
as a hypothetical dialectical exchange between a
proponent, who presents and defends claims, and
a challenger (the ‘opponent’), who critically ques-
tions them in a regimented fashion. Every move
in such a basic dialectical situation corresponds
to a structural element in the argument diagram.
The analysis of an argumentative text is thus con-
ceived as finding the corresponding critical ques-
tion of the challenger that is answered by a partic-
ular segment of the text.

Since the focus of this paper is on the evalu-
ation methodology, we provide here only a brief
sketch of the scheme; for a detailed description
with many examples, see Peldszus and Stede (to
appear). Premises and conclusions are proposi-
tions expressed in the text segments. We can
graphically present an argument as an argument
diagram, with propositions as nodes and the vari-
ous relations as arrows linking either two nodes or

196

a node and a link2. See figure 1 for an example.
Notice that segments in favor of the proponent’s
position are drawn in circles, whereas the chal-
lenger’s perspective is given in boxes. The root
of an argument tree is the central statement made
in the text. In the example, it is expressed both in
segment 1 and in segment 8; the = indicates that
the annotator judges the contributions of the two
segments as equivalent, which can happen for any
node in the tree. Segments 2, 4, and 9 provide
support to the central statement, which is the most
simple configuration.

(1) [We should tear the building down.]1 [It is full
of asbestos.]2

Support can be serial (transitive), when a support-
ing statement in turn receives support from an-
other one. E.g., example (1) could be continued
with . . . [The report of the commission made that
very clear.]3.

If an argument involves multiple premises that
support the conclusion only if they are taken to-
gether, we have a linked structure in Freeman’s ter-
minology. On its own none of the linked premises
would be able to support the conclusion. In the
basic dialectical situation, a linked structure is in-
duced by the challenger’s question as to why a
premise is relevant to the claim. The proponent
then answers by presenting another premise expli-
cating the connection. Building linked structure is
thus to be conceived as completing an argument.
As an example, consider the following continu-
ation of example (1) . . . [All buildings with haz-
ardous materials should be demolished.]3 . Linked
support is shown in the diagram by connecting the
premises before they link to the conclusion.

Two more configurations, which turn up in Fig-
ure 1, are the attacking relations (all with a cir-
cled arrowhead): undercut and rebuttal. The for-

standard tree representation results.

mer (segment 5) denies the relevance of a stated
relation, here: the support that 4 lends to 1=8. The
opponent does not dispute the truth of 4 itself but
challenges the idea that it can in fact lend support
to 1=8. We draw it as an attack arrow pointing
at the relation in question. In contrast, a rebut-
tal directly challenges the truth of a statement. In
the example, the annotator first decided that seg-
ments 6 and 7 play a joint role for the argumen-
tation (this is the step of merging two segments)
and then marked them as the proponent’s rebuttal
of the challenger’s statement 5.

3 Annotation Experiment

3.1 Guidelines

We developed annotation guidelines based on the
theory presented in Section 2. The guidelines
(6 pages) contain text examples and the cor-
responding graphs for all basic structures, and
they present different combinations of attack and
counter-attack. The annotation process is divided
into three steps: First, one segment is identified as
the central claim of the text. The annotator then
chooses the dialectical role (proponent or oppo-
nent) for all remaining segments. Finally, the argu-
mentative function of each segment (is it support-
ing or attacking) and the corresponding subtypes
have to be determined, as well as the targeted seg-
ment.

3.2 Data

Applying the scheme demands a detailed, deep un-
derstanding of the text, which is why we choose
to first evaluate this task on short and controlled
instances of argumentation. For this purpose we
built a set of 23 constructed German texts, where
each text consists of only five discourse segments.
While argumentative moves in authentic texts are
often surrounded by material that is not directly
relevant to the argumentation, such as factual
background information, elaborations or rhetori-
cal decoration, in the constructed texts all seg-
ments are clearly argumentative, i.e. they either
presents the central claim, a reason, an objection
or a counter-attack. Merging segments and identi-
fying restatements is thus not necessary. The texts
cover several combinations of the basic constructs
in different linearisations, typically one central
claim, two (simple, combined or exemplifying)
premises, one objection (rebutting a premise, re-
butting the conclusion or undercutting the link be-

197



tween them) and a possible reaction (rebutting or
undercutting counter-attacks, or a new reason that
renders the objection uncountered). A (translated)
example of a micro text is given in (2). In the
questionaire the order of the texts has been ran-
domized.

(2) [Energy-saving light bulbs contain a con-
siderable amount of toxic substances.]1 [A
customary lamp can for instance contain
up to five milligrams of quicksilver.]2 [For
this reason, they should be taken off the
market,]3 [unless they are virtually unbreak-
able.]4 [This, however, is simply not case.]5

3.3 Procedure

The annotation experiment was carried out in the
context of an undergraduate university course with
26 students, participation was obligatory. The an-
notators only received minimal training: A short
introduction (5 min.) was given to set the topic.
After studying the guidelines (∼30 min.) and a
very brief question-answering, the subjects anno-
tated the 23 texts (∼45 min.), writing their analysis
as an argumentative graph in designated areas of
the questionaire.

4 Evaluation

4.1 Preparations

Since the annotators were asked to assign one and
only one function to each segment, every node in
the argumentative graph has exactly one out-going
arc. The graph can thus be reinterpreted as a list
of segment labels.

Every segment is labeled on different levels:
The ‘role’-level specifies the dialectical role (pro-
ponent or opponent). The ‘typegen’-level specifies
the general type, i.e. whether the segment presents
the central claim (thesis) of the text, supports or
attacks another segment. The ‘type’-level addi-
tionally specifies the kind of support (normal or
example) and the kind of attack (rebutter or un-
dercutter). Whether a segment’s function holds
only in combination with that of another segment
(combined) or not (simple) is represented on the
‘combined’-level.3 The target is finally specified
by the segment identifier (1 . . . 5) or relation iden-
tifier (a . . . d) on the ‘target’-level.

The labels of each separate level can be merged
to form a complex tagset. We interpret the result

3This is roughly equivalent to Freeman’s ‘linked
premises’.

as a hierarchical tagset as it is presented in Fig-
ure 2.4 The label ‘PSNC(3)’ for example stands
for a proponent’s segment, giving normal support
to segment 3 in combination with another seg-
ment, while ‘OAUS(b)’ represents an opponent’s
segment, undercutting a relation b, not combined.

Due to space and readability constraints, we fo-
cus the detailed discussion of the experiment’s re-
sult on the ‘role+type’-level. Still, general results
will be reported for all levels.

Another question that arises before evaluation,
especially in our setting, is how to deal with miss-
ing annotations, since measuring inter-annotator
agreement with a κ-like coefficient requires a deci-
sion of every annotator (or at least the same num-
ber of annotators) on each item. One way to cope
with this is to exclude annotators with missing an-
notations, another to exclude items that have not
been annotated by every subject. In our exper-
iment only 11 of the 26 subjects annotated ev-
ery segment. Another 10 annotated at least 90%
of the segments, five annotated less. Excluding
some annotators would be possible in our setting,
but keeping only 11 of 26 is unacceptable. Ex-
cluding items is also inconvenient given the small
dataset. We thus chose to mark segments with
missing annotations as such in the data, augment-
ing the tagset with the label ‘?’ for missing anno-
tations. We are aware of the undesired possibility
that two annotators ‘agree’ on not assigning a cat-
egory to a segment. Still, we can decide to only
exclude those annotators who omitted many deci-
sions, and to measure agreement for the remaining
ones, thereby reducing the risk of false agreement.

4.2 IAA over all annotators

The agreement in terms of Fleiss’s κ (Fleiss,
1971)5 of all annotators on the different levels is
shown in Table 1. For the complex levels we ad-
ditionally report Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff,
1980) as a weighted measure of agreement. We
use the distance between two tags in the tag hier-
archy to weigh the confusion (similar to Geertzen
and Bunt (2006)), in order to capture the intuition
that confusing, e.g., PSNC with PSNS is less se-
vere than confusing it with OAUS.

According to the scale of Krippendorff (1980),

4Notice that this hierarchy is implicit in the annotation
process, yet the annotators were neither confronted with a
decision-tree version nor the labels of this tag hierarchy.

two annotators, as Artstein and Poesio (2008) pointed out.

on each level (without ‘?’) is shown in the second column (possible target categories depend on text
length). We report Fleiss’s κ with the associated observed (AO) and expected agreement (AE). Weighted
scores were calculated using Krippendorff’s α, with observed (DO) and expected disagreement (DE).

the annotators in our experiment did neither
achieve reliable (κ ≥ 0.8) nor marginally reli-
able (0.67 ≤ κ < 0.8) agreement. On the scale
of Landis and Koch (1977), most results can be
interpreted to show moderate correlation (0.4 <
κ ≤ 0.6), only the two most complex levels fall
out. Considering weighted scores for those com-
plex levels, all fall into the window of moderate
correlation.

While typical results in discourse structure tag-
ging usually reach or exceed the 0.7 threshold6 ,
we expected lower results for three reasons: first
the minimal training of the naive annotators only
based on the guidelines, second the varying com-
mitment to the task of the annotators in the con-
strained setting and finally the nature of the task,
which requires a precise specification of the anno-
tators interpretation of the texts.

When it comes to investigation of the reasons
of disagreement, the informativeness of a single
inter-annotator agreement value is limited. We
want to identify sources of disagreement in both
the set of annotators as well as the categories. To

6Agreement of professional annotators on 16 rhetorical
relations was κ=0.64 in the beginning and 0.82 after extensive
training (Carlson et al., 2003). Agreement on ‘argumentative
zones’ is reported κ=0.71 for trained annotators with detailed
guidelines, another study for untrained annotators with only
minimalistic guidelines reported values varying between 0.35
and 0.72 (depending on the text), see Teufel (2010).

this end, contingency tables (confusion matrices)
are studied, which show the number of category
agreements and confusions for a pair of annota-
tors. However, the high number of annotators in
our study makes this strategy infeasible, as there
are 325 different pairs of annotators. One solution
to still get an overview of typical category con-
fusions, is to build an aggregated confusion ma-
trix, which sums up the values of category pairs
across all 325 normal confusion matrices. As pro-
posed in Cinková et al. (2012), we derive a confu-
sion probability matrix from this aggregated ma-
trix, which is shown in Table 2. It specifies the
conditional probability that one annotator will an-
notate an item with categorycolumn , given that an-
other has chosen categoryrow , so the rows sum up
to 1. The diagonal cells display the probability of
agreement for each category.

Table 4: Krippendorff’s category distinction diag-
nostic for the level ‘role+type’, base κ=0.45.

Krippendorff (1980) proposed another way to
investigate category confusions by systematically
comparing the agreement on the original category
set with the agreement on a reduced category set.
There are two different methods to collapse cat-
egories: The first is the category definition test,
where all but the one category of interest are col-
lapsed together, yielding a binary category distinc-
tion. When measuring the agreement with this bi-
nary distinction only confusions between the cat-
egory of interest and the rest count, but no confu-
sions between the collapsed categories. If agree-
ment increases for the reduced set compared to the
original set, that category of interest is better dis-
tinguished than the rest of the categories. As Ta-
ble 3 shows, the highest distinguishability is found
for PT, PSN and PSE. Rebutters are better distin-
guished for the opponent role than for the propo-
nent role. Undercutters seem equally problematic
for both roles. The extreme value for OSE is not
surprising, given that this category was not sup-
posed to be found in the dataset and was only used
twice. It shows, though, that the results of this test
have to be interpreted with caution for rare cate-
gories, since in these cases the collapsed rest al-
ways leads to a very high chance agreement.

The other of Krippendorff’s diagnostics is the
category distinction test, where two categories are
collapsed in order to measure the impact of con-
fusions between them on the overall agreement
value. The higher the difference, the greater the

confusion between the two collapsed categories.
Table 4 shows the result for some category pairs.
The highest gain is found between rebutting and
undercutting attacks on the opponents side: Given
the base κ=0.45, the +0.048 increase means a po-
tential improvement of 10% if these confusions
could be reduced. However, distingishing rebut-
ters and undercutters often depends on interpreta-
tion and we consider it unlikely to reach perfect
agreement on that decision.

4.3 Comparison with gold data

We now compare the result of the annotation ex-
periment with the gold annotation. For each an-
notator and for each level of annotation, we cal-
culated the F1 score, macro-averaged over the cat-
egories of that level. Figure 3 shows the distri-
bution of those values as boxplots. We observe
varying degrees of difficulty on the basic levels:
While the scores on the ‘role’ and ‘typegen’ are
relatively dense between 0.8 and 0.9, the distribu-
tion is much wider and also generally lower for
‘type’, ‘comb’ and ‘target’. Especially remarkable
is the drop of the median when comparing ‘type-
gen’ with ‘type’: For the simpler level, all values
of the better half of annotators lie above 0.85, but
for the more complex level, which also requires
the distinction between rebutters and undercutters,
the median drops to 0.67. The figure also shows
the pure F1 score for identifying the central claim
(PT). While the larger part of the annotators per-
forms well in this task, there are still some be-
low 0.7. This is remarkable, since identifying one
segment as the central claim of a five-segment text
does not appear to be a challenging task.

4.4 Ranking and clustering the annotators

Until now we have mainly investigated the tagset
as a factor in measuring agreement. The
widespread distribution of annotator scores in the
comparison with gold data however showed that

their performance differs greatly. As described in
Section 3.3, participation in the study was obliga-
tory for our subjects (students in class). We thus
want to make sure that the differences in perfor-
mance are a result of the annotator’s varying com-
mitment to the task, rather than a result of pos-
sible ambiguities or flaws of the guidelines. The
inter-annotator agreement values presented in Ta-
ble 1 are not so helpful for answering this ques-
tion, as they only provide us with an average mea-
sure, but not with an upper and lower bound of
what is achievable with our annotators. Conse-
quently, the goal of this section is to give structure
to the set of annotators, to impose a (partial) or-
der on it or even divide it into different groups and
investigate their characteristic confusions.

Central claim: During the conversion of the
written graphs into segment label squences, it be-
came obvious that certain annotators nearly al-
ways chose the first segment of the text as the
central claim, even in cases where it was fol-
lowed by a consecutive clause with a discourse
marker. Therefore, our first heuristic was to im-
pose an order on the set of annotators according
to their F1 score in identifying the central claim.
This not only identifies those outliers but can ad-
ditionally serve as a rough indicator of text un-
derstanding. Although this ordering requires gold
data, producing gold data for the central claim of a
text is relatively simple and using them only gives
minimal bias in the evaluation (in contrast to e.g.

‘role+type’ F1 score as a sorting criterion). With
this ordering we can then calculate agreement on
different subsets of the annotators, e.g. only for
the two best annotators, for the ten best or for all.
Figure 4 shows κ on the different levels for all n-
best groups of annotators: From the two best to the
six best annotators the results are quite stable. The
six best annotators achieve an encouraging κ=0.74
on the ‘role+type’ level and likewise satisfactory
κ=0.69 for the full task, i.e. on the maximally
complex ‘role+type+comb+target’ level. For in-
creasingly larger n-best groups, the agreement de-
creases steadily with only minor fluctuations. Al-
though the central claim F1 score proves to be a
useful sorting criterion here, it might not work as
well for authentic texts, due to the possibility of
restated, or even implicit central claims.

Category distributions: Investigating the an-
notator bias is also a promising way to impose
structure onto the group of annotators. A look
on the individual distribution of categories per an-
notator quickly reveals that there are some devia-
tions. Table 5 shows the individual distributions
for the ‘role+type’-level, as well as the average
annotator distribution and that found in the gold
data. We focus on three peculiarities here. First,
both annotators A18 and A21 refrain from classi-
fying segments as attacking. Although they make
the distinction between the roles, they give only
supporting segments. Checking the annotations
shows that they must have mixed the concepts of
dialectical role and argumentative function. An-
other example is the group of A04, A20 and A23,
who refrain from using proponent attacks. Al-

though they make the distinction between the ar-
gumentative functions of supporting and attack-
ing, they do not systematically attribute counter-
attacks to the proponent. Finally, as pointed out
before, there are several annotators with a different
amount of missing annotations. Note, that missing
annotations must not necessarily signal an unmo-
tivated annotator (who skips an item if deciding on
it is too tedious). It could very well also be a dili-
gent but slow annotator. Still, missing annotations
lead to lower agreement in most cases, so filtering
out the severe cases might be a good idea. Most
of the annotators showing deviations in category
distribution could be identified, if annotators are
sorted by deviation from average distribution ∆∅,
which is shown in the last column of Table 5. Fil-
tering out the 7 worst annotators in terms of ∆∅,
the resulting κ increases from 0.45 to 0.54 on the
‘role+type’-level, which is nearly equal to the 0.53
achieved when using the same size of annotator set
in the central claim ordering. Although this order-
ing suffices to detect outliers in the set of annota-
tors without relying on gold data, it still has two
drawbacks: It only maximizes to the average and
will thus not garantuee best agreement scores for
the smaller n-best sets. Furthermore a more gen-
eral critique on total orders of annotators: There
are various ways in which a group agrees or dis-

agrees simultaneously that might not be linearized
this way. Luckily, a better solution is at hand.

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering: We
apply hierarchical clustering in order to investi-
gate the structure of agreement in the set of an-
notators. The clusters are initialized as singletons
for each annotator. Then agreement is calculated
for all possible pairs of those clusters. The pair of
clusters with highest agreement is merged. This
procedure is iterated until there is only one cluster
left. In contrast to normal clustering, the linkage

criterion does not determine the distance between
complex clusters indirectly as function of the dis-
tance between singleton clusters, but directly mea-
sures agreement for the unified set of annotators of
both clusters. Figure 5 shows the clustering on the
‘role+type’-level. It not only gives an impression
of the possible range of agreement, but also allows
us to check for ambiguities in the guidelines: If
there were stable alternative readings in the guide-
lines, we would expect multiple larger clusters that
can only be merged at a lower level of κ. As the
Figure shows, the clustering grows steadily, maxi-
mally incorporating clusters of two annotators, so
we do not see the threat of ambiguity in the guide-
lines. Furthermore, the clustering conforms with
central claim ordering in picking out the same set
of six reliable and good annotators (with an aver-
age F1 of 0.76 for ‘role+type’ and of 0.67 for the
full task compared to gold) and it conforms with
both orderings in picking out similar sets of worst
annotators.

With this clustering we now have the possibility
to investigate the agreement for subgroups of an-
notators. Since the growth of the clusters is rather
linear, we choose to track the confusion over the
best path of growing clusters, i.e. starting from
the best scoring {A24,A03} cluster to the maximal
cluster. It would be interesting to see the change in
Krippendorff’s category distinction diagnostic for
selected confusion pairs. However, this value not
only depends on the amount of confusion but also
on the frequency of that categories7, which cannot
be assume to be identical for different sets of an-
notators. We thus investigate the confusion rate
confc1,c2 , i.e. the ratio of confusing assigments
pairs |c1 ◦ c2| in the total set of agreeing and con-
fusing assignments pairs for these two categories:

confc1,c2 =
|c1 ◦ c2|

|c1 ◦ c1|+ |c1 ◦ c2|+ |c2 ◦ c2|

Figure 6 shows the confusion rate for selected
category pairs over the path from the best scoring
to the maximal cluster. The confusion between re-
butters and undercutters is already at a high level
for the best six best annotators, but increases when
worse annotators enter the cluster. A constant
and relatively low confusion rate has PSN+PAU,
which means that distinguishing counter-attacks
from new premises is equally ‘hard’ for all annota-
tors. Distinguishing normal and example support,

720% confusion of frequent categories have a larger im-
pact on agreement than that of less frequent categories.

as well as central claims and supporting segments
is not a problem for the six best annotators. It be-
comes slightly more confusing for more annota-
tors, yet ends at a relatively low level around 0.08
and 0.13 respectively. Confusing undercutters and
support on the opponents side is only a problem
of the low-agreeing annotators, the confusion rate
is nearly 0 for the first 21 annotators on the clus-
ter path. Finally note, that there is no confusion
typical for the high-agreeing annotators only.

5 Conclusions

We presented methods to systematically study the
agreement in a larger group of annotators. To
this end, we evaluated an annotation study, where
26 untrained annotators marked the argumentation
structure of small texts. While the overall agree-
ment showed only moderate correlation (as one
could expect from naive annotators in a text in-
terpretation task) we could identify a subgroup of
annotators reaching a reliable level of agreement
and good F1 scores in comparison with gold data
by different ranking and clustering approaches and
investigated which category confusions were char-
acteristic for the different subgroups.
