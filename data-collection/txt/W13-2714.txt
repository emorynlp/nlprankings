Abstract

In this paper we look at a task at border
of natural language processing, historical
linguistics and the study of language de-
velopment, namely that of identifying the
time when a text was written. We use
machine learning classification using lexi-
cal, word ending and dictionary-based fea-
tures, with linear support vector machines
and random forests. We find that lexical
features are the most helpful.

1 Introduction

Text dating, or determination of the time period
when it was written, proves to be a useful com-
ponent in NLP systems that can deal with such
diachronistically dynamic inputs (Mourão et al.,
2008). Besides this, the models that can perform
such classification can shine light on less than ob-
vious changes of certain features.

The knowledge captured in such systems can
prove useful in transferring modern language re-
sources and tools to historical domains (Meyer,
2011). Automatic translation systems between
and across language stages, as in the corpus in-
troduced by (Magaz, 2006), can benefit from the
identification of feature variation over time.

In this paper we study the problem of super-
vised temporal text classification across genres
and authors. The problem turns out to be solvable
to a very high degree of accuracy.

2 Related Work

The influence of the temporal effects in automatic
document classification is analyzed in (Mourão et
al., 2008) and (Salles et al., 2010). The authors

state that a major challenge in building text clas-
sification models may be the change which occurs
in the characteristics of the documents and their
classes over time (Mourão et al., 2008). There-
fore, in order to overcome the difficulties which
arise in automatic classification when dealing with
documents dating from different epochs, identify-
ing and accounting for document characteristics
changing over time (such as class frequency, rela-
tionships between terms and classes and the sim-
ilarity among classes over time (Mourão et al.,
2008)) is essential and can lead to a more accurate
discrimination between classes.

In (Dalli and Wilks, 2006) a method for clas-
sification of texts and documents based on their
predicted time of creation is successfully applied,
proving that accounting for word frequencies and
their variation over time is accurate. In (Kumar
et al., 2012) the authors argue as well for the ca-
pability of this method, of using words alone, to
determine the epoch in which a text was written or
the time period a document refers to.

The effectiveness of using models for individu-
als partitions in a timeline with the purpose of pre-
dicting probabilities over the timeline for new doc-
uments is investigated in (Kumar et al., 2011) and
(Kanhabua and Nørvåg, 2009). This approach,
based on the divergence between the language
model of the test document and those of the time-
line partitions, was successfully employed in pre-
dicting publication dates and in searching for web
pages and web documents.

In (de Jong et al., 2005) the authors raise the
problem of access to historical collections of doc-
uments, which may be difficult due to the differ-
ent historical and modern variants of the text, the
less standardized spelling, words ambiguities and

102



other language changes. Thus, the linking of cur-
rent word forms with their historical equivalents
and accurate dating of texts can help reduce the
temporal effects in this regard.

Recently, in (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012), the
authors introduced the task of identifying changes
in word usage over time, disambiguating the epoch
at word-level.

3 Approach

3.1 Datasets used

In order to investigate the diachronic changes and
variations in the Romanian lexicon over time, we
used copora from five different stages in the evo-
lution of the Romanian language, from the 16th

to the 20th century. The 16th century represents
the beginning of the Romanian writing. In (Dim-
itrescu, 1994, p. 13) the author states that the mod-
ern Romanian vocabulary cannot be completely
understood without a thorough study of the texts
written in this period, which should be consid-
ered the source of the literary language used to-
day. In the 17th century, some of the most im-
portant cultural events which led to the develop-
ment of the Romanian language are the improve-
ment of the education system and the establish-
ing of several printing houses (Dimitrescu, 1994,
p. 75). According to (Lupu, 1999, p. 29), in
the 18th century a diversification of the philologi-
cal interests in Romania takes place, through writ-
ing the first Romanian-Latin bilingual lexicons,
the draft of the first monolingual dictionary, the
first Romanian grammar and the earliest transla-
tions from French. The transition to the Latin al-
phabet, which was a significant cultural achieve-
ment, is completed in the 19th century. The Cyril-
lic alphabet is maintained in Romanian writing
until around 1850, afterwards being gradually re-
placed with the Latin alphabet (Dimitrescu, 1994,
p. 270). The 19th century is marked by the conflict
(and eventually the compromise) between etymol-
ogism and phonetism in Romanian orthography.
In (Maiorescu, 1866) the author argues for apply-
ing the phonetic principle and several reforms are
enforced for this purpose. To represent this pe-
riod, we chose the journalism texts of the leading
Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu. He had a cru-
cial influence on the Romanian language and his
contribution to modern Romanian development is
highly appreciated. In the 20th century, some vari-
ations regarding the usage of diacritics in Roma-

nian orthography are noticed.

Table 1: Romanian corpora: words

For preprocessing our corpora, we began by re-
moving words that are irrelevant for our investiga-
tion, such as numbers. We handled word bound-
aries and lower-cased all words. We computed,
for each text in our corpora, the number of words
(type and token). The results are listed in Table
1. For identifying words from our corpora in dic-
tionaries, we performed lemmatization. The in-
formation provided by the machine-readable dic-
tionary dexonline 1 regarding inflected forms al-
lowed us to identify lemmas (where no semantic
or part-of-speech ambiguities occurred) and to fur-
ther lookup the words in the dictionaries. In our
investigations based on dexonline we decided to
use the same approach as in (Mihalcea and Nas-
tase, 2012) and to account only for unambiguous
words. For example, the Romanian word ai is
morphologically ambiguous, as we identified two
corresponding lemmas: avea (verb, meaning to
have) and ai (noun, meaning garlic). The word
amânare is semantically ambiguous, having two
different associated lemmas, both nouns: amânar
(which means flint) and amâna (which means to
postpone). We do not use the POS information di-

rectly, but we use dictionary occurrence features
only for unambiguous words.

The database of dexonline aggregates informa-
tion from over 30 Romanian dictionaries from dif-
ferent periods, from 1929 to 2012, enabling us to
investigate the diachronic evolution of the Roma-
nian lexicon. We focused on four different sub-
features:

• words marked as obsolete in dexonline defi-
nitions (we searched for this tag in all dictio-
naries)

• words which occur in the dictionaries of ar-
chaisms (2 dictionaries)

• words which occur in the dictionaries pub-
lished before 1975 (7 dictionaries)

• words which occur in the dictionaries pub-
lished after 1975 (31 dictionaries)

As stated before, we used only unambiguous
words with respect to the part of speech, in order to
be able to uniquely identify lemmas and to extract
the relevant information. The aggregated counts
are presented in table 2.

3.2 Classifiers and features
The texts in the corpus were split into chunks of
500 sentences in order to increase the number of
sample entries and have a more robust evaluation.
We evaluated all possible combinations of the four
feature sets available:

• lengths: average sentence length in words,
average word length in letters

• stopwords: frequency of the most common
50 words in all of the training set:

de s, i ı̂n a la cu au no o să că se pe
din s ca i lui am este fi l e dar pre ar
vă le al după fost ı̂ntr când el dacă

tures and aggregating over 50 trees

• endings: frequency of all word suffixes of
length up to three, that occur at least 5 times
in the training set

• dictionary: proportion of words matching
the dexonline filters described above

The system was put together using the scikit-
learn machine learning library for Python (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011), which provides an imple-
mentation of linear support vector machines based
on liblinear (Fan et al., 2008), an implementation
of random forests using an optimised version of
the CART algorithm.

4 Results

The hyperparameters (number of trees, in the ran-
dom forest case, and C, for the SVM) were op-
timized using 3 fold cross-validation for each of
the feature sets. For the best feature sets, denoted
with an asterisk in table 3, the test results and hy-
perparameter settings are presented in tables 4 and
5.

The results show that the nonlinear nature of
the random forest classifier is important when us-
ing feature sets so different in nature. However, a
linear SVM can perform comparably, using only
the most important features. The misclassifica-
tions that do occur are not between very distant
centuries.

5 Conclusions

We presented two classification systems, a linear
SVM one and a nonlinear random forest one, for
solving the temporal text classification problem on
Romanian texts. By far the most helpful features
turn out to be lexical, with dictionary-based histor-
ical information less helpful than expected. This is
probably due to inaccuracy and incompleteness of

might need to be dealt with better.

We plan to further investigate feature impor-
tances and feature selection for this task to ensure
that the classifiers do not actually fit authorship or
genre latent variables.
