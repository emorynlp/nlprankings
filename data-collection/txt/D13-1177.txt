Abstract

Biological processes are complex phenom-
ena involving a series of events that are re-
lated to one another through various relation-
ships. Systems that can understand and rea-
son over biological processes would dramat-
ically improve the performance of semantic
applications involving inference such as ques-
tion answering (QA) – specifically “How?”
and “Why?” questions. In this paper, we
present the task of process extraction, in
which events within a process and the rela-
tions between the events are automatically ex-
tracted from text. We represent processes by
graphs whose edges describe a set of temporal,
causal and co-reference event-event relations,
and characterize the structural properties of
these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected).
Then, we present a method for extracting rela-
tions between the events, which exploits these
structural properties by performing joint in-
ference over the set of extracted relations.
On a novel dataset containing 148 descrip-
tions of biological processes (released with
this paper), we show significant improvement
comparing to baselines that disregard process
structure.

1 Introduction

A process is defined as a series of inter-related
events that involve multiple entities and lead to an
end result. Product manufacturing, economical de-
velopments, and various phenomena in life and so-
cial sciences can all be viewed as types of processes.
Processes are complicated objects; consider for ex-
ample the biological process of ATP synthesis de-
scribed in Figure 1. This process involves 12 en-
tities and 8 events. Additionally, it describes rela-
tions between events and entities, and the relation-
ship between events (e.g., the second occurrence of
the event ‘enter’, causes the event ‘changing’).

∗Both authors equally contributed to the paper

Automatically extracting the structure of pro-
cesses from text is crucial for applications that re-
quire reasoning, such as non-factoid QA. For in-
stance, answering a question on ATP synthesis, such
as “How do H+ ions contribute to the production
of ATP?” requires a structure that links H+ ions
(Figure 1, sentence 1) to ATP (Figure 1, sentence
4) through a sequence of intermediate events. Such
“How?” questions are common on FAQ websites
(Surdeanu et al., 2011), which further supports the
importance of process extraction.

Process extraction is related to two recent lines
of work in Information Extraction – event extrac-
tion and timeline construction. Traditional event ex-
traction focuses on identifying a closed set of events
within a single sentence. For example, the BioNLP
2009 and 2011 shared tasks (Kim et al., 2009; Kim
et al., 2011) consider nine events types related to
proteins. In practice, events are currently almost al-
ways extracted from a single sentence. Process ex-
traction, on the other hand, is centered around dis-
covering relations between events that span multiple
sentences. The set of possible event types in process
extraction is also much larger.

Timeline construction involves identifying tem-
poral relations between events (Do et al., 2012; Mc-
Closky and Manning, 2012; D’Souza and Ng, 2013),
and is thus related to process extraction as both fo-
cus on event-event relations spanning multiple sen-
tences. However, events in processes are tightly cou-
pled in ways that go beyond simple temporal order-
ing, and these dependencies are central for the pro-
cess extraction task. Hence, capturing process struc-
ture requires modeling a larger set of relations that
includes temporal, causal and co-reference relations.

In this paper, we formally define the task of
process extraction and present automatic extraction
methods. Our approach handles an open set of event
types and works over multiple sentences, extract-
ing a rich set of event-event relations. Furthermore,

H+ ions flowing down their gradient enter a half channel in a stator, which is anchored in the membrane.

H+ ions enter binding sites within a rotor, changing the shape of each subunit so that the rotor spins within the membrane.

Spinning of the rotor causes an internal rod to spin as well.

Turning of the rod activates catalytic sites in the knob that can produce ATP from ADP and P_i.

we characterize a set of global properties of process
structure that can be utilized during process extrac-
tion. For example, all events in a process are some-
how connected to one another. Also, processes usu-
ally exhibit a “chain-like” structure reflecting pro-
cess progression over time. We show that incor-
porating such global properties into our model and
performing joint inference over the extracted rela-
tions significantly improves the quality of process
structures predicted. We conduct experiments on a
novel dataset of process descriptions from the text-
book “Biology” (Campbell and Reece, 2005) that
were annotated by trained biologists. Our method
does not require any domain-specific knowledge and
can be easily adapted to non-biology domains.

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. We define process extraction and characterize
processes’ structural properties.

2. We model global structural properties in pro-
cesses and demonstrate significant improve-
ment in extraction accuracy.

3. We publicly release a novel data set of 148
fully annotated biological process descrip-
tions along with the source code for our sys-
tem. The dataset and code can be down-
loaded from http://nlp.stanford.edu/
software/bioprocess/.

2 Process Definition and Dataset

We define a process description as a paragraph or
sequence of tokens x = {x1, . . . x|x|} that describes

a series of events related by temporal and/or causal
relations. For example, in ATP synthesis (Figure 1),
the event of rotor spinning causes the event where
an internal rod spins.

We model the events within a process and their
relations by a directed graph P = (V,E), where
the nodes V = {1, . . . , |V |} represent event men-
tions and labeled edges E correspond to event-event
relations. An event mention v ∈ V is defined by a
trigger tv, which is a span of words xi, xi+1, . . . , xj ;
and by a set of argument mentions Av, where each
argument mention av ∈ Av is also a span of words
labeled by a semantic role l taken from a set L. For
example, in the last event mention of ATP synthesis,
tv = produce, and one of the argument mentions is
av = (ATP, RESULT). A labeled edge (u, v, r) in the
graph describes a relation r ∈ R between the event
mentions u and v. The task of process extraction is
to extract the graph P from the text x.1

A natural way to break down process extraction
into sub-parts is to first perform semantic role label-
ing (SRL), that is, identify triggers and predict ar-
gument mentions with their semantic role, and then
extract event-event relations between pairs of event
mentions. In this paper, we focus on the second
step, where given a set of event triggers T , we find
all event-event relations, where a trigger represents
the entire event. For completeness, we now describe
the semantic roles L used in our dataset, and then

tions, but we neglect that since it is not central in this paper.

present the set of event-event relationsR.
The setL contains standard semantic roles such as

AGENT, THEME, ORIGIN, DESTINATION and LO-
CATION. Two additional semantic roles were em-
ployed that are relevant for biological text: RESULT
corresponds to an entity that is the result of an event,
and RAW-MATERIAL describes an entity that is used
or consumed during an event. For example, the last
event ‘produce’ in Figure 1, has ‘ATP’ as the RE-
SULT, and ‘ADP’ as the RAW-MATERIAL.

The event-event relation set R contains the fol-
lowing (assuming a labeled edge (u, v, r)):

1. PREV denotes that u is an event immediately
before v. Thus, the edges (u, v, PREV) and
(v, w, PREV), preclude the edge (u,w, PREV).
For example, in “When a photon strikes
. . . energy is passed . . . until it reaches . . . ”,
there is no edge (strikes, reaches, PREV) due
to the intervening event ‘passed’.

2. COTEMP denotes that events u and v overlap in
time (e.g., the first two event mentions flowing
and enter in Figure 1).

3. SUPER denotes that event u includes event
v. For instance, in “During DNA replica-
tion, DNA polymerases proofread each nu-
cleotide. . . ” there is an edge (DNA replication,
proofread, SUPER).

4. CAUSES denotes that event u causes event v
(e.g., the relation between changing and spins
in sentence 2 of Figure 1).

5. ENABLES denotes that event u creates precon-
ditions that allow event v to take place. For
example, the description “. . . cause cancer cells
to lose attachments to neighboring cells. . . , al-
lowing them to spread into nearby tissues” has
the edge (lose, spread, ENABLES). An in-
tuitive way to think about the difference be-
tween Causes and Enables is the following: if
u causes v this means that if u happens, then
v happens. If u enables v, then if u does not
happen, then v does not happen.

6. SAME denotes that u and v both refer to the
same event (spins and Spinning in Figure 1).

Early work on temporal logic (Allen, 1983) con-
tained more temporal relations than are used in our

relation set R. We chose a relation set R that cap-
tures the essential aspects of temporal relations be-
tween events in a process, while keeping the annota-
tion as simple as possible. For instance, we include
the SUPER relation that appears in temporal anno-
tations such as the Timebank corpus (Pustejovsky
et al., 2003) and Allen’s work, but in practice was
not considered by many temporal ordering systems
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Yoshikawa et al.,
2009; Do et al., 2012). Importantly, our relation set
also includes the relations CAUSES and ENABLES,
which are fundamental to modeling processes and
go beyond simple temporal ordering.

We also added event coreference (SAME) to R.
Do et al. (2012) used event coreference information
in a temporal ordering task to modify probabilities
provided by pairwise classifiers prior to joint infer-
ence. In this paper, we simply treat SAME as an-
other event-event relation, which allows us to easily
perform joint inference and employ structural con-
straints that combine both coreference and temporal
relations simultaneously. For example, if u and v are
the same event, then there can exist no w, such that
u is before w, but v is after w (see Section 3.3)

We annotated 148 process descriptions based on
the aforementioned definitions. Further details on
annotation and data set statistics are provided in Sec-
tion 4 and Table 1.

Structural properties of processes Coherent pro-
cesses exhibit many structural properties. For ex-
ample, two argument mentions related to the same
event cannot overlap – a constraint that has been
used in the past in SRL (Toutanova et al., 2008). In
this paper we focus on three main structural prop-
erties of the graph P . First, in a coherent pro-
cess, all events mentioned are related to one another,
and hence the graph P must be connected. Sec-
ond, processes tend to have a “chain-like” structure
where one event follows another, and thus we expect

nodes’ degree to generally be ≤ 2. Indeed, 90% of
event mentions have degree ≤ 2, as demonstrated
by the Gold column of Table 2. Last, if we consider
relations between all possible triples of events in a
process, clearly some configurations are impossible,
while others are common (illustrated in Figure 2).
In Section 3.3, we show that modeling these proper-
ties using a joint inference framework improves the
quality of process extraction significantly.

3 Joint Model for Process Extraction

Given a paragraph x and a trigger set T , we wish
to extract all event-event relations E. Similar to Do
et al. (2012), our model consists of a local pairwise
classifier and global constraints. We first introduce
a classifier that is based on features from previous
work. Next, we describe novel features specific for
process extraction. Last, we incorporate global con-
straints into our model using an ILP formulation.

3.1 Local pairwise classifier

The local pairwise classifier predicts relations be-
tween all event mention pairs. In order to model
the direction of relations, we expand the set R to
include the reverse of four directed relations: PREV-
NEXT, SUPER- SUB, CAUSES-CAUSED, ENABLES-
ENABLED. After adding NONE to indicate no rela-
tion, and including the undirected relations COTEMP
and SAME,R contains 11 relations. The classifier is
hence a function f : T × T → R. As an example,
f(ti, tj) = PREV iff f(tj , ti) = NEXT. Let n be the
number of triggers in a process, and ti be the i-th
trigger in its description. Since f(ti, tj) completely
determines f(tj , ti), it suffices to consider only pairs
with i < j. Note that the process graph P is undi-
rected under the new definition ofR.

Table 3 describes features from previous

work (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Do et al.,
2012) extracted for a trigger pair (ti, tj). Some
features were omitted since they did not yield
improvement in performance on a development set
(e.g., lemmas and part-of-speech tags of context
words surrounding ti and tj), or they require gold
annotations provided in TimeBank, which we do
not have (e.g., tense and aspect of triggers). To
reduce sparseness, we convert nominalizations into
their verbal forms when computing word lemmas,
using WordNet’s (Fellbaum, 1998) derivation links.

3.2 Classifier extensions
A central source of information to extract event-
event relations from text are connectives such as af-
ter, during, etc. However, there is variability in the
occurrence of these connectives as demonstrated by
the following two sentences (connectives in bold-
face, triggers in italics):

1. Because alleles are exchanged during gene flow, ge-
netic differences are reduced.

2. During gene flow, alleles are exchanged, and genetic
differences are hence reduced.

Even though both sentences express the same re-
lation (exchanged, reduced,CAUSES), the connec-
tives used and their linear position with respect to the
triggers are different. Also, in sentence 1, gene flow
intervenes between exchanged and reduced. Since
our dataset is small, we wish to identify the trig-
gers related to each connective, and share features
between such sentences. We do this using the syn-
tactic structure and by clustering the connectives.

Sentence 1 presents a typical case where by walk-
ing up the dependency tree from the marker because,
we can find the triggers related by this marker:
because mark←−−− exchanged advcl←−−− reduced. When-
ever a trigger is the head of an adverbial clause and
marked by a mark dependency label, we walk on the
dependency tree and look for a trigger in the main
clause that is closest to the root (or the root itself
in this example). By utilizing the syntactic struc-
ture, we can correctly spot that the trigger gene flow
is not related to the trigger exchanged through the
connective because, even though they are linearly
closer. In order to reduce sparseness of connectives,
we created a hand-made clustering of 30 connectives
that maps words into clusters2 (e.g., because, since
and hence to a “causality” cluster). After locating
the relevant pair of triggers, we use these clusters
to fire the same feature for connectives belonging to
the same cluster. We perform a similar procedure
whenever a trigger is part of a prepositional phrase
(imagine sentence 1 starting with “due to allele ex-
change during gene flow . . . ”) by walking up the
constituency tree, but details are omitted for brevity.
In sentence 2, the connective hence is an adverbial
modifier of the trigger reduced. We look up the clus-
ter for the connective hence and fire the same feature
for the adjacent triggers exchanged and reduced.

We further extend our features to handle the rich
relation set necessary for process extraction. The
first event of a process is often expressed as a nom-
inalization and includes subsequent events (SUPER
relation), e.g., “The Calvin cycle begins by incor-
porating...”. To capture this, we add a feature that
fires when the first event of the process description
is a noun. We also add two features targeted at the

2The full set of connectives and their clustering are provided
as part of our publicly released package.

SAME relation: one indicating if the lemmas of ti
and tj are the same, and another specifying the de-
terminer of tj , if it exists. Certain determiners in-
dicate that an event trigger has already been men-
tioned, e.g., the determiner this hints a SAME rela-
tion in “The next steps decompose citrate back to
oxaloacetate. This regeneration makes . . . ”. Last,
we add as a feature the dependency path between ti
and tj , if it exists, e.g., in “meiosis produces cells
that divide . . . ”, the feature dobj−−→ rcmod−−−→ is fired for
the trigger pair produces and divide. In Section 4.1
we empirically show that our extensions to the local
classifier substantially improve performance.

For our pairwise classifier, we train a maximum
entropy classifier that computes a probability pijr
for every trigger pair (ti, tj) and relation r. Hence,
f(ti, tj) = arg maxr pijr.

3.3 Global Constraints

Naturally, pairwise classifiers are local models that
can violate global properties in the process structure.
Figure 3 (left) presents an example for predictions
made by the pairwise classifier, which result in two
triggers (deleted and dupcliated) that are isolated
from the rest of the triggers. In this section, we dis-
cuss how we incorporate constraints into our model
to generate coherent global process structures.

Let θijr be the score for a relation r between the
trigger pair (ti, tj) (e.g., θijr = log pijr), and yijr be
the corresponding indicator variable. Our goal is to
find an assignment for the indicators y = {yijr | 1 ≤
i < j ≤ n, r ∈ R}. With no global constraints this
can be formulated as the following ILP:

1714

∑

s.t.∀i,j
∑

yijr = 1

where the constraint ensures exactly one relation be-
tween each event pair. We now describe constraints
that result in a coherent global process structure.

Connectivity Our ILP formulation for enforcing
connectivity is a minor variation of the one sug-
gested by Martins et al. (2009) for dependency pars-
ing. In our setup, we want P to be a connected undi-
rected graph, and not a directed tree. However, an
undirected graph P is connected iff there exists a
directed tree that is a subgraph of P when edge di-
rections are ignored. Thus the resulting formulation
is almost identical and is based on flow constraints
which ensure that there is a path from a designated
root in the graph to all other nodes.

Let R̄ be the set R \ NONE. An edge (ti, tj) is
in E iff there is some non-NONE relation between
ti and tj , i.e. iff yij :=

∑
r∈R̄ yijr is equal to 1.

For each variable yij we define two auxiliary binary
variables zij and zji that correspond to edges of the
directed tree that is a subgraph of P . We ensure that
the edges in the tree exist also in P by tying each
auxiliary variable to its corresponding ILP variable:

∀i<j zij ≤ yij , zji ≤ yij (2)

Next, we add constraints that ensure that the graph
structure induced by the auxiliary variables is a tree
rooted in an arbitrary node 1 (The choice of root
does not affect connectivity). We add for every i 6= j
a flow variable φij which specifies the amount of
flow on the directed edge zij .

φjk = 1 (5)

∀i 6=j φij ≤ n · zij (6)

Equation 3 says that all nodes in the graph have
exactly one parent, except for the root that has no
parents. Equation 4 ensures that the outgoing flow
from the root is n−1, and Equation 5 states that each
of the other n − 1 nodes consume exactly one unit
of flow. Last, Equation 6 ties the auxiliary variables
to the flow variables, making sure that flow occurs
only on edges. The combination of these constraints
guarantees that the graph induced by the variables
zij is a directed tree and consequently the graph in-
duced by the objective variables y is connected.

Chain structure A chain is a connected graph
where the degree of all nodes is ≤ 2. Table 2
presents nodes’ degree and demonstrates that indeed
process graphs are close to being chains. The fol-
lowing constraint bounds nodes’ degree by 2:

∀j(
∑
i<j

∑

yjk ≤ 2) (7)

Since graph structures are not always chains, we
add this as a soft constraint, that is, we penalize the
objective for each node with degree > 2. The chain
structure is one of the several soft constraints we
enforce. Thus, our modified objective function is∑

ijr θijryijr +
∑

k∈K αkCk, where K is the set of
soft constraints, αk is the penalty (or reward for de-
sirable structures), and Ck indicates whether a con-
straint is violated (or satisfied). Note that under this
formulation our model is simply a constrained con-
ditional model (wei Chang et al., 2012). The param-
eters αk are tuned on a development set (see Sec-
tion 4).

Relation triads A relation triad (or a re-
lation triangle) for any three triggers ti, tj
and tk in a process is a 3-tuple of relations
(f(ti, tj), f(tj , tk), f(ti, tk)). Clearly, some triads
are impossible while others are quite common. To
find triads that could improve process extraction, the
frequency of all possible triads in both the training
set and the output of the pairwise classifier were
found, and we focused on those for which the clas-
sifier and the gold standard disagree. We are inter-
ested in triads that never occur in training data but
are predicted by the classifier, and vice versa. Fig-
ure 2 illustrates some of the triads found and Equa-

1715



tions 8-12 provide the corresponding ILP formula-
tions. Equations 8-10 were formulated as soft con-
straints (expanding the setK) and were incorporated
by defining a reward αk for each triad type.3 On
the other hand, Equations 11-12 were formulated as
hard constraints to prevent certain structures.

1. SAME transitivity (Figure 2a, Eqn. 8): Co-
reference transitivity has been used in past
work (Finkel and Manning, 2008) and we in-
corporate it by a constraint that encourages tri-
ads that respect transitivity.

2. CAUSE-COTEMP (Figure 2b, Eqn. 9): If ti
causes both tj and tk, then often tj and tk are
co-temporal. E.g, in “genetic drift has led to
a loss of genetic variation and an increase in
the frequency of . . .”, a single event causes two
subsequent events that occur simultaneously.

3. COTEMP transitivity (Figure 2c, Eqn. 10): If
ti is co-temporal with tj and tj is co-temporal
with tk, then usually ti and tk are either co-
temporal or denote the same event.

4. SAME contradiction (Figure 2d, Eqn. 11): If
ti is the same event as tk, then their tempo-
ral ordering with respect to a third trigger tj
may result in a contradiction, e.g., if tj is af-
ter ti, but before tk. We define 5 temporal
categories that generate

(

)
possible contradic-

tions, but for brevity present just one represen-
tative hard constraint. This constraint depends
on prediction of temporal and co-reference re-
lations jointly.

5. PREV contradiction (Figure 2e, Eqn. 12): As
mentioned (Section 3.3), if ti is immediately
before tj , and tj is immediately before tk, then
ti cannot be immediately before tk.

3We experimented with a reward for certain triads or a
penalty for others and empirically found that using rewards re-
sults in better performance on the development set.

We used the Gurobi optimization package4 to
find an exact solution for our ILP, which contains
O(n2|R|) variables and O(n3) constraints. We also
developed an equivalent formulation amenable to
dual decomposition (Sontag et al., 2011), which is a
faster approximation method. But practically, solv-
ing the ILP exactly with Gurobi was quite fast (av-
erage/median time per process: 0.294 sec/0.152 sec
on a standard laptop).

4 Experimental Evaluation

We extracted 148 process descriptions by going
through chapters from the textbook ”Biology” and
marking any contiguous sequence of sentences that
describes a process, i.e., a series of events that lead
towards some objective. Then, each process descrip-
tion was annotated by a biologist. The annotator was
first presented with annotation guidelines and anno-
tated 20 descriptions. The annotations were then
discussed with the authors, after which all process
descriptions were annotated. After training a sec-
ond biologist, we measured inter-annotator agree-
ment κ = 0.69, on 30 random process descriptions.

Process descriptions were parsed with Stanford
constituency and dependency parsers (Klein and
Manning, 2003; de Marneffe et al., 2006), and 35
process descriptions were set aside as a test set
(number of training set trigger pairs: 1932, number
of test set trigger pairs: 906). We performed 10-
fold cross validation over the training set for feature
selection and tuning of constraint parameters. For
each constraint type (connectivity, chain-structure,
and five triad constraints) we introduced a param-
eter and tuned the seven parameters by coordinate-
wise ascent, where for hard constraints a binary pa-
rameter controls whether the constraint is used, and
for soft constraints we attempted 10 different re-
ward/penalty values. For our global model we de-
fined θijr = log pijr, where pijr is the probability at
edge (ti, tj) for label r, given by the pairwise clas-
sifier.

We test the following systems: (a) All-Prev: Since
the most common process structure was chain-like,
we simply predict PREV for every two adjacent trig-
gers in text. (b) Localbase: A pairwise classifier with

the edges. (e) Global: Our full model that uses ILP

To evaluate system performance we compare the
set of predictions on all trigger pairs to the gold stan-
dard annotations and compute micro-averaged pre-
cision, recall and F1. We perform two types of eval-
uations: (a) Full: evaluation on our full set of 11
relations (b) Temporal: Evaluation on temporal re-
lations only, by collapsing PREV, CAUSES, and EN-
ABLES to a single category and similarly for NEXT,
CAUSED, and ENABLED (inter-annotator agreement
κ = 0.75). We computed statistical significance
of our results with the paired bootstrap resampling
method of 2000 iterations (Efron and Tibshirani,
1993), where the units resampled are trigger-trigger-
relation triples.

4.1 Results

Table 4 presents performance of all systems. We see
that using global constraints improves performance
almost invariably on all measures in both full and
temporal evaluations. Particularly, in the full eval-
uation Global improves recall by 12% and overall
F1 improves significantly by 3.7 points against Lo-
cal (p < 0.01). Recall improvement suggests that
modeling connectivity allowed Global to add cor-
rect relations in cases where some events were not
connected to one another.

The Local classifier substantially outperforms

Localbase. This indicates that our novel features
(Section 3.2) are important for discriminating be-
tween process relations. Specifically, in the full eval-
uation Local improves precision more than in the
temporal evaluation, suggesting that designing syn-
tactic and semantic features for connectives is useful
for distinguishing PREV, CAUSES, and ENABLES
when the amount of training data is small.

The Chain baseline performs only slightly worse
than our global model. This demonstrates the strong
tendency of processes to proceed linearly from one
event to the other, which is a known property of dis-
course structure (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973). How-
ever, since the structure is deterministically fixed,
Chain is highly inflexible and does not allow any
extensions or incorporation of other structural con-
straints or domain knowledge. Thus, it can be used
as a simple and efficient approximation but is not a
good candidate for a real system. Further support
for the linear nature of process structure is provided
by the All-Prev baseline, which performs poorly in
the full evaluation, but in temporal evaluation works
reasonably well.

Table 2 presents the degree distribution of Local
and Global on the development set comparing to the
gold standard. The degree distribution of Global is
more similar to the gold standard than Local. In par-
ticular, the connectivity constraint ensures that there
are no isolated nodes and shifts mass from nodes
with degree 0 and 1 to nodes with degree 2.

Table 5 presents the order in which constraints
were introduced into the global model using coor-
dinate ascent on the development set. Connectivity
is the first constraint to be introduced, and improves
performance considerably. The chain constraint, on
the other hand, is included third and the improve-
ment in F1 score is relatively smaller. This can be
explained by the distribution of degrees in Table 2
which shows that the predictions of Local does not
have many nodes with degree > 2. As for triad con-
straints, we see that four constraints are important
and are included in the model, but one is discarded.

Last, we examined the results of Global when
macro-averaging over processes, i.e., assigning each
process the same weight by computing recall, pre-
cision and F1 for each process and averaging those
scores. We found that results are quite similar
(with a slight improvement): in the full evalua-

in the temporal evaluation Global obtains R/P/F1 of
63.8/62.3/63.1.

4.2 Qualitative Analysis

Figure 3 shows two examples where global con-
straints corrected the predictions of Local. In Fig-
ure 3, left, Local failed to predict the causal rela-
tions skipped-deleted and used-duplicated, possibly
because they are not in the same sentence and are not
adjacent to one another. By enforcing the connectiv-
ity constraint, Global correctly adds the correct re-
lations and connects deleted and duplicated to the
other triggers in the process.

In Figure 3, right, Local predicts a structure that
results in a “SAME contradiction” structure. The
triggers bind and binds cannot denote the same event
if a third trigger secrete is temporally between them.
However, Local predicts they are the same event, as
they share a lemma. Global prohibits this structure
and correctly predicts the relation as NONE.

To better understand the performance of Local,
we analyzed the confusion matrix generated based
on its predictions. Although this is a challenging
11-class classification task, most of the mass is con-
centrated on the matrix diagonal, as desired. Error
analysis reveals that 17.5% of all errors are con-
fusions between NONE and PREV, 11.1% between
PREV and CAUSES, and 8.6% between PREV and
COTEMP. This demonstrates that distinguishing the
classes PREV, CAUSES and COTEMP is challenging
for Local. Our current global constraints do not ad-
dress this type of error, and thus an important direc-
tion for future work is to improve the local model.

The global model depends on the predictions of
the local classifier, and so enforcing global con-
straints does not guarantee improvement in perfor-
mance. For instance, if Local produces a graph that
is disconnected (e.g., deleted in Figure 3, left), then
Global will add an edge. However, the label of the
edge is determined by scores computed based on
the local classifier, and if this prediction is wrong,
we will now be penalized for both the false nega-
tive of the correct class (just as before), and also for
the false positive of the predicted class. Despite that
we see that Global improves overall performance by
3.7 F1 points on the test set.

5 Related Work

A related line of work is biomedical event extrac-
tion in recent BioNLP shared tasks (Kim et al.,
2009; Kim et al., 2011). Earlier work employed a
pipeline architecture where first events are found,
and then their arguments are identified (Miwa et al.,
2010; Björne et al., 2011). Subsequent methods pre-
dicted events and arguments jointly using Markov
logic (Poon and Vanderwende, 2010) and depen-
dency parsing algorithms (McClosky et al., 2011).
Riedel and McCallum (2011) further improved per-
formance by capturing correlations between events
and enforcing consistency across arguments.

Temporal event-event relations have been ex-
tensively studied (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;
Yoshikawa et al., 2009; Denis and Muller, 2011;
Do et al., 2012; McClosky and Manning, 2012;
D’Souza and Ng, 2013), and we leverage such
techniques in our work (Section 3.1). However,
we extend beyond temporal relations alone, and
strongly rely on dependencies between process
events. Chambers and Jurafsky (2011) learned event
templates (or frames), where events that are related
to one another and their semantic roles are extracted.
Recently, Cheung et al. (2013) proposed an unsuper-
vised generative model for inducing such templates.
A major difference in our work is that we do not
learn typical event relations from a large and redun-
dant corpus, but are given a paragraph and have a
“one-shot” chance to extract the process structure.

We showed in this paper that global structural
properties lead to significant improvements in ex-
traction accuracy, and ILP is an effective framework

for modeling global constraints. Similar observa-
tions and techniques have been proposed in other
information extraction tasks. Reichart and Barzi-
lay (2012) tied information from multiple sequence
models that describe the same event by using global
higher-order potentials. Berant et al. (2011) pro-
posed a global inference algorithm to identify entail-
ment relations. There is an abundance of examples
of enforcing global constraints in other NLP tasks,
such as in coreference resolution (Finkel and Man-
ning, 2008), parsing (Rush et al., 2012) and named
entity recognition (Wang et al., 2013).

6 Conclusion

Developing systems that understand process de-
scriptions is an important step towards building ap-
plications that require deeper reasoning, such as bi-
ological process models from text, intelligent tutor-
ing systems, and non-factoid QA systems. In this
paper we have presented the task of process extrac-
tion, and developed methods for extracting relations
between process events. Processes contain events
that are tightly coupled through strong dependen-
cies. We have shown that exploiting these structural
dependencies and performing joint inference over all
event mentions can significantly improve accuracy
over several baselines. We have also released a new
dataset containing 148 fully annotated descriptions
of biological processes. Though the models we built
were trained on biological processes, they do not en-
code domain specific information, and hence should
be extensible to other domains.

In this paper we assumed that event triggers are

given as input. In future work, we want to perform
trigger identification jointly with extraction of event-
event relations. As explained in Section 4.2, the
performance of our system is confined by the per-
formance of the local classifier, which is trained on
relatively small amounts of data. Since data annota-
tion is expensive, it is important to improve the lo-
cal classifier without increasing the annotation bur-
den. For example, one can use unsupervised meth-
ods that learn narrative chains (Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2011) to provide some prior on the typical
order of events. Alternatively, we can search on the
web for redundant descriptions of the same process
and use this redundancy to improve classification.
Last, we would like to integrate our method into QA
systems and allow non-factoid questions that require
deeper reasoning to be answered by matching the
questions against the learned process structures.
