Abstract

The paper discuses problems in annotating
a corpus containing Polish clinical data with
low level linguistic information. We propose
an approach to tokenization and automatic
morphologic annotation of data that uses ex-
isting programs combined with a set of do-
main specific rules and vocabulary. Finally
we present the results of manual verification
of the annotation for a subset of data.

1 Introduction

Annotated corpora are knowledge resources indis-
pensable to the design, testing and evaluation of
language tools. Medical language differs signifi-
cantly from the everyday language used in newspa-
pers, magazines or fiction. Therefore, general lan-
guage corpora are insufficient when creating tools
for (bio)medical text processing.

There are several biomedical corpora available for
English such as GENIA (Kim et al., 2010) — the
best known and most used one, containing MED-
LINE abstracts annotated on several levels; BioInfer
(Pyysalo et al., 2007) targeted at protein, gene, and
RNA relationships annotation; or CLEF (Roberts et
al., 2009) containing 20,000 cancer patient records
annotated with clinical relations. Medical corpora
are also collected for lesser spoken languages, e.g.
MEDLEX— Swedish medical corpus (Kokkinakis,
2006); IATROLEXI project for Greek (Tsalidis et
al., 2007); or Norwegian corpus of patients’ histories
(Røst et al., 2008). The paper (Cohen et al., 2005)
contains a survey of 6 biomedical corpora. The au-
thors emphasize the importance of a standard format

and give guidelines for careful annotation and eval-
uation of corpora.

The immediate goal of the paper is to estab-
lish and test a method of annotating Polish clini-
cal data with low level linguistic information, i.e.
token and morpheme descriptions. The research is
done on a relatively small set of data (more than
450,000 tokens) but to gain the experience neces-
sary to create a much larger annotated corpus of Pol-
ish medical texts. We would like to use our cor-
pus to refine and test domain tools for: tagging,
Named Entity Recognition or annotation of nominal
phrases. We have already annotated the corpus with
semantic information (Marciniak and Mykowiecka,
2011) using an existing rule based extraction sys-
tem (Mykowiecka et al., 2009) and performed exper-
iments with machine learning approaches to seman-
tic labeling (Mykowiecka and Marciniak, 2011).
Thus, to enable the realization of various scientific
goals, a detailed and universal morphologic annota-
tion of the corpus was introduced.

The division into tokens is the first level of text
analysis. It is frequently performed without paying
special attention to potential problems, just by di-
viding text on spaces, line breaks and punctuation
marks. In many applications this is quite a satis-
factory solution, but in case of texts that contain a
lot of non-letter characters, using universal tokeniza-
tion rules frequently causes problems. Some exam-
ples, in the case of using the Penn Treebank tok-
enization scheme in annotating the GENIA corpus
were pointed out in (Teteisi and Tsujii, 2006). Jiang
and Zhai (2007) show the importance of tokeniza-
tion strategies in the biomedical domain, and the in-

92



fluence of this process on the results of information
retrieval. Our approach consists of dividing text into
simple tokens which can be grouped at subsequent
levels of analysis using domain specific knowledge.

For languages with rich inflection, like Polish,
morphological annotation is indispensable for fur-
ther text analysis. As there are no Polish taggers
which can analyze medical texts, nor medical lexi-
cons containing inflected forms, we combine a gen-
eral purpose tagger with a set of domain specific
rules referring to a small data induced vocabulary.
A portion of the automatically annotated data was
checked by two linguists to assess data quality. The
results obtained are given in 8. Currently, the entire
dataset is undergoing manual verification.

2 Linguistic Characteristics of Texts

The corpus consists of 460 hospital discharge re-
ports of diabetic patients, collected between the
years 2001 and 2006 in one of Warsaw’s hospi-
tals. These documents are summaries of hospital
treatment and are originally written in MS Word
with spelling correction turned on, so the errors ob-
served are mainly in words that are not included in
the dictionary. The documents are converted into
plain text files to facilitate their linguistic analysis
and corpus construction. Clinical data include infor-
mation serving identification purposes (names and
addresses) which are substituted by symbolic codes
before making the documents accessible for further
analysis. The annonymization task was performed
in order to make the data available for scientific pur-
poses. We plan to inspect the data manually, to re-
move all indirect information enabling a patient’s
identification, and negotiate the terms for making
the corpus publicly available.

Each document is 1.5 – 2.5 pages long, and be-
gins with the identification information of the pa-
tient and his/her visit in hospital. Next, the follow-
ing information is given in short form: significant
past and current illnesses, diagnoses and patient’s
health at the beginning of the hospitalization. Af-
ter these data, the document describes results of ex-
aminations such as height, weight, BMI and blood
pressure, ophthalmology examinations, blood tests,
lipid profile tests, radiology or ultrasound. This part
of the document may also contain descriptions of at-

tempts to select the best treatment for the patient.
The summary of the document starts from the word
Epikryza ‘Discharge abstract’. Its length is about
half a page of text. It contains: data about a pa-
tient’s diabetes, a description of diabetic complica-
tions, and other illnesses, selected examination re-
sults and surgical interventions, information about
education, diet observed, self monitoring, patient’s
reactions, and other remarks. Finally, all recommen-
dations are mentioned, including information about
prescribed diet, insulin treatment (type and doses)
and oral medication.

Most information is given as free-form text, but
the vocabulary of these documents is very spe-
cific, and significantly differs from texts included
in corpora of general Polish like IPIPAN Corpus
(Przepiórkowski, 2004) or NKJP (National Corpus
of Polish, http://nkjp.pl). The texts con-
tain many dates in different formats, and a lot of
test results with numerical values, whose descrip-
tions are omitted in NKJP. The texts contains also
a lot of medication names, like Cefepime or Ac-
ard not present in any general Polish dictionary.
Some of them are multi-word names like Diaprel
MR, Mono Mack Depot, Mixtard 10. The same
medication can be referred to in different ways de-
pending on international or Polish spelling rules
(e.g. Amitriptylinum and its Polish equivalent Amit-
ryptylina). Polish names could be inflected by cases
(e.g. Amitryptylinygen).
In documents, many diagnoses are written in

Latin. In the following examples the whole phrases
are in Latin: Retinopathia diabetica simplex cum
maculopathia oc. sin. ‘simple diabetic retinopathy
with maculopathy of the left eye’; or Laryngitis
chronica. Otitis media purulenta chronica dex.
‘Chronic laryngitis. Chronic purulent inflammation
of the middle right ear’. Sometimes foreign expres-
sions are thrown into a Polish sentences: Ascites
duża ilość płynu w jamie brzusznej między pętlami
jelit . . . ‘Ascites a lot of fluid in abdominal cavity
between intestinal loops . . . ’ — only the first word
is not in Polish.

3 Corpus description

The corpus is annotated with morphological and se-
mantic information. The standard of annotation fol-

93



lows the TEI P5 guidelines advised for annotation of
biomedical corpora, see (Erjavec et al., 2003). Our
corpus format is based on the one accepted for the
NKJP corpus (Przepiórkowski and Bański, 2009).
According to this scheme, every annotation is de-
scribed in a separate file. Each discharge document
is represented by a catalog containing the following
five files:

• xxx.txt – plain text of the original annonymized
document;

• xxx.xml – text of the document (in the form as
in xxx.txt file) divided into numbered sections
which are in turn divided into paragraphs;

• xxx_segm.xml – token limits and types (29
classes);

• xxx_morph.xml – morphological information
(lemmas and morphological feature values);

• xxx_sem.xml – semantic labels and limits.
4 Tokenization

The first level of text analysis is its segmentation
into tokens. In general, most tokens in texts are
lowercase words, words beginning with a capital let-
ter and punctuation marks. The most common (thus
the most important) tokenization problem is then to
decide whether a particular dot ends a sentence or
belongs to the preceding abbreviation (or both). In
some texts there are also many numbers represent-
ing dates, time points, time intervals or various nu-
merical values. For texts in which uniform standards
of expressing these notions are obeyed, recognizing
such complex tokens is much easier and simplifies
further text analysis.

In medical texts the problem of non-word tokens
is harder than in the case of newspapers or novel
content as they constitute a much larger portion
of the text itself. Apart from descriptions of time
(dates, hours, periods of time) there are numbers that
refer to values of different medical tests or medicine
doses and sizes. There are also many specific
names which sometimes contain non-letter charac-
ters (e.g. Na+) as well as locally used abbreviations
and acronyms. An additional difficulty is caused by
the lack of will to obey writing standards. Physi-
cians use different ways of describing dates (e.g.

02.09.2004, 30.09/1.10.2003, 06/01/2004, 14.05.05,
28 .04. 05, 12.05.2005r.) or time (8:00 vs 8.00).
They also do not pay enough attention to punctu-
ation rules and mix Polish and English standards of
writing decimal numbers. In Polish we use a comma
not a dot, but the influence of English results in com-
mon usage of the decimal point. Sometimes both
notations can be found in the same line of text. Fur-
ther, the sequence ‘2,3’ may mean either ‘2.3’ or two
separate values: ‘2’ and ‘3’.

Two tools used in the process of constructing
the corpus have embedded tokenizers. The first
one is a part of the information extraction system
SProUT (Drożdżyński et al., 2004) which was used
to write grammars identifying semantically impor-
tant pieces of text. The general assumption adopted
while building its tokenizer was “not to interpret too
much”, which means that tokens are relatively sim-
ple and do not rely on any semantic interpretation.
Their self explanatory names, together with token
examples and their frequencies in the entire input
data set, are listed in table 1.

Two other tokenization modules are embedded in
the TaKIPI tagger used to disambiguate the morpho-
logical descriptions of word forms (Piasecki, 2007).
The first one divides all character sequences into
words and non-words which are assigned the ign la-
bel. The second tokenizer interprets these non-word
sequences and assigns them ttime, tdate, turi (for se-
quences with dots inside) and tsym labels. It also
applies a different identification strategy for token
limits – for all non-word tokens only a space or a
line break ends a token. Although treating a date
(15.10.2004r) or a range (1500-2000) as one token
is appropriate, in the case of sequences where spaces
are omitted by mistake, the resulting tokens are of-
ten too long (e.g. ‘dnia13/14.07.04’, ‘iVS-1,5’).

After analyzing the results given by three differ-
ent tokenizers we decided to use the token classes
identified by the SProUT tokenizer and align its
results with the results of the ‘simple’ TaKIPI to-
kenizer. SProUT tokens which were longer than
TaKIPI tokens, e.g. ‘1x2mg’, ‘100mg’, ’50x16x18’,
were divided into smaller onces. The changes
introduced to token limits concern those tokens
of the other_symbol type which contain punctua-
tion marks. The other_symbol class comprises se-
quences which do not fit into any other class, i.e.

94



symbols for which separate classes are not defined
(e.g. ‘=’) and mixed sequences of letters and digits.
In this latter case a token ends only when a space or
a line break is encountered. The most typical case
when this strategy fails in our data is the sequence
‘HbA1c:’ as the name of the test according to the
tokenizer rules is classified as an ‘other_symbol’
the following colon is not separated. There are
also other similar sequences: ‘HbA1c=9,1%:’ or
‘(HbA1C’. To make the results more uniform we di-
vided these tokens on punctuation characters. This
process resulted in replacing 1226 complex tokens
by 4627 simple ones. Among these newly cre-
ated tokens the most numerous class was lower-
case_word and numbers which were formed after
separating numbers and unit names, e.g. 10g, 100cm
and sequences describing repetitions or sizes, like
2x3, 2mmx5mm. The longest sequence of this kind
was ‘ml/min.,GFR/C-G/-37,5ml/min/1,73m2’. This
string was divided into 18 tokens by TAKIPI but fi-
nally represented as 23 tokens in the corpus. Finally,
in the entire data set 465004 tokens (1802864 char-
acters) were identified. The most numerous class
represents numbers – 18.8% (9% of characters), all
punctuation characters constitute 25% of the total
number of tokens (6.5% characters).

5 Morphological analysies

Morphological annotation was based on the results
obtained by the publicly available Polish POS tag-
ger TaKIPI that cooperates with Morfeusz SIAT
(Woliński, 2006) — a general-purpose morpholog-
ical analyzer of Polish. For each word, it assigns
all possible interpretations containing: its base form,
part of speech, and complete morphological charac-
terization (e.g. case, gender, number, aspect if rel-
evant). The description is exhaustive and aimed at
further syntactic analyses of texts.

The annotation is done in three steps. In the
first one the documents are analyzed and disam-
biguated by TaKIPI. TaKIPI can be combined with
the Guesser module (Piasecki and Radziszewski,
2007) which suggests tags for words which are not
in the dictionary. We decided to use this module
because otherwise 70600 tokens representing words
and acronyms that occur in the documents would be
assigned an unknown description. The gain from its

usage is however not so evident, as tags and base
forms suggested by Guesser are quite often incor-
rect – in one test set, only 272 forms out of 1345
were analyzed correctly.

The analyses of TaKIPI results shows that there
are many systematic errors. They can be corrected
globally. An example of such an error is the de-
scription of medication names produced by Guesser.
Their morphologic tags are often correct, but the
problem is with gender assignment in case of mascu-
line forms. In Polish there are three subtypes of mas-
culine gender: personal, animate and inanimate, and
Guesser quite often uses personal masculine gender
instead of the inanimate one while analyzing med-
ication names. The second most common problem
concerns base forms, because all base forms created
by the module are written with a small letter. So in
the case of proper names, all base forms have to be
corrected. Moreover, TaKIPI do not disambiguate
all tags – certain forms still have more than one pos-
sible description.

95



Thus, to limit the number of manual changes
needed in the final version of the corpus, we post-
process the results with a set of rules (see section 7)
created on the basis of a list of all different token
descriptions. The rules mainly correct the annota-
tions of domain related tokens like acronyms and
units: BMI, HbA1c, RR, USG, Hz or kcal; medi-
cation names e.g. Diaprel, its diaprel base form is
changed into Diaprel; and other domain terms like
dekarboksylazie (‘decarboxylaseloc’) for which the
masculine base form was suggested dekarboksylaz
instead of feminine dekarboksylaza. Moreover, tags
of misspelled tokens and foreign words are assigned
to tokens during this stage and if there is more than
one description attached to a token, then the more
probable in the domain is chosen.

Finally, the morphology analyses are manually
corrected. This is done by two linguists. The re-
sults are compared and corrected by a third annota-
tor. The first results are described in section 8.

6 Tags

For each token, TaKIPI assigns its base form,
POS, and full morphological description. For
example, the token badania that has the base
form badanie ‘examination’ is classified in all 579
occurrences as a neutral noun. In 566 cases
it is classified as a singular form in genitive
and is assigned the tag subst:sg:gen:n (substan-
tive:singular:genitive:neutral); in 13 cases as a plu-
ral noun including 8 nominative forms, 4 accusative
and even one vocative (unreliable in medical texts).
TaKIPI assigns the unknown tag (ign) to numbers,
so we introduced the number tag to represent nu-
merical values in the corpus. It is assigned to 18.8%
of tokens.

The set of potential morphological tags consists
of more than 4000 elements. In our corpus only 450
different tags are represented, in comparison to over
1000 tags used in the general Polish IPIPAN corpus
(Przepiórkowski, 2005).

In the rest of this section we describe tags used
for the classification of strings that are not properly
classified by TaKIPI. If no tag described in the sec-
tion suits a token, the tag tsym is assigned to it. In
particular, all patient codes (like d2005_006) have
the tsym tag.

6.1 Errors

Spelling errors in the corpus are left as they are. Mis-
spelled tokens are assigned the base form equal to
the token, and one of the following tags depending
on the type of error:

• err_spell describes misspelled tokens like
bia3ko instead of białko (‘protein’). In the cor-
pus we provide additional information with the
corrected input token, its base form and mor-
phological tag.

• err_conj describes concatenations like cukrzy-
cowej2000 (‘diabetic2000’). In this case we
add the correct form cukrzycowej 2000 to the
corpus but do not add its description.

• err_disj_f describes the first part of an in-
correctly disjointed word. For example the
word ciśnienie (‘pressure’) was divided into
two parts ci and śnienie, (by chance, both are
valid Polish words).

• err_disj_r describes the second part of the in-
correctly disjointed word.

The last three categories can be supplemented
with spell description if necessary. For example the
token Bylaw is a concatenation of the misspelled
word Była (‘was’) with the preposition w (‘in’). This
token has the tag err_conj_spell, and the Była w
correction is added.

6.2 Abbreviations

There are many abbreviations in the documents.
Some of them are used in general Polish like prof
(‘professor’) or dr (‘doctor), but there are many ab-
breviations that are specific to the medical domain.
For example in the descriptions of USG examina-
tions the letter t denotes tętnica (‘artery’), while tt
refers to the same word in plural, although usu-
ally there is no number related difference e.g. wit
(‘vitamin’) can be used in plural and singular con-
text. Sometimes it is not a single word but the
whole phrase which is abbreviated, e.g. NLPZ is
the acronym of the noun phrase Niesterydowe Leki
PrzeciwZapalne ‘Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory
Drugs’, and wpw is an abbreviation of the prepo-
sitional phrase w polu widzenia ‘in field of view’.

96



Abbreviations and acronyms obtain the tag acron.
Moreover, it is possible to insert the full form corre-
sponding to them.

Acronyms denoting units obtain the tag unit.
Units in common usage are not explained: mm, kg,
h, but if a unit is typical to the medical domain, its
full form is given (e.g. HBD means tydzień ciaży
‘week of pregnancy’).

We also distinguish two tags describing prefixes
and suffixes. The token makro (‘macro’) in the
phrase makro i mikroangiopatia (‘macro and mi-
croangiopathy’) has the tag prefix, while the suffix
tag describes, for example, the part ma of the string
10-ma which indicates instrumental case of number
10, like in: cukrzyca rozpoznana przed 10-ma laty
(‘diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago’).

6.3 Foreign Words

Foreign words receive the foreign tag. This tag can
be elaborated with information on the part of speech,
so for example, Acne has the tag foreign_subst. It
is possible to attach a Polish translation to foreign
words.

7 Correction Rules

Correction rules are created on the basis of a list
of different tokens, their base form, and tags that
occurred in the corpus. Each rule is applied to all
matching form descriptions of tokens in the already
tagged data.

We use the method of global changes because we
want to decrease the number of manual corrections
in the corpus on the final, manual stage. It should
be noted that without context it is impossible to cor-
rect all morphological tags. We can only eliminate
evident errors but we cannot decide, for example,
if a particular description of a token badanie ‘ex-
amination’ (see section 6) is correct or not. All
these tags can be verified only if we know the con-
text where they occurred. However, quite a lot of
changes can be made correctly in any context, e.g.
changes of gender of a medication name (Lorindenf
into Lorindenm3), or in the prevailing number of
cases, e.g. assigning to zwolnienie the gerund tag
‘slowing’ (11 occurrences) instead of less frequent
in the texts noun ‘sick leave’ only one occurrence
(TaKIPI leaves both descriptions).

There are two main types of correction rules of
which syntax is given in (1–2). ‘#’ is a separator;
the character ‘>’ indicates the new token description
that is applied to the corpus; after || additional in-
formation can be noted. In case of rule (1) it could
be a text that explains the meaning of acronyms, ab-
breviations or foreign words, while for rule (2), a
corrected token, base form and tag can be given.
This additional information might be used for creat-
ing a corpus without spelling errors, dictionaries of
abbreviations or foreign words used in the medical
domain.

(1) token#base form#tag#>
token#new base form#new tag#
|| ‘string’ (optionally)

(2) token#base form#tag#>
token#token#error_spell# ||
corr. token#corr. base form#new tag#

The first scheme is useful for changing the base
form or the tag of a token. See example (3) where
the first letter of the base form is capitalized and per-
sonal masculine gender m1 is changed into inani-
mate masculine gender m3.

(3) Insulatard#insulatard#subst:sg:nom:m1#>
Insulatard#Insulatard#subst:sg:nom:m3#

The second scheme is applied to a token grani-
ach ‘ridges’ (in mountain) that represents the exist-
ing but unreliable word in the medical domain. For
all of its occurrences in our data (3 cases) it is sub-
stituted by granicach ‘limits’ by the following cor-
rection rule:

(4) graniach#grań#subst:pl:loc:f#>
granicach#granicach#err_spell# ||
granicach#granica#subst:pl:loc:f#

If there is more than one interpretation left by
TaKIPI, all are mentioned before the character ‘>’.
See example (5) where two different base forms are
possible for the token barku and both have the same
tag assigned. The first base form bark (‘shoulder’)
is definitely more probable in the medical domain
than the second one barek (‘small bar’ or ‘cocktail
cabinet’), so the rule chooses the first description.

(5) barku#bark#subst:sg:gen:m3##barek#
subst:sg:gen:m3#>barku#bark#subst:sg:gen:m3#

Table 2 presents the frequencies of top level mor-
phological classes: directly after running the tagger,
after changing the token limits and after applying au-
tomatic changes. In the last column the number of
different forms in every POS class is presented.

Most part of speech names are self explanatory,
the full list and description of all morphological tags
can be found in (Przepiórkowski, 2004), the newly
introduced tags are marked with ∗. Of all words
(all tags apart form interpunction, number and tsym)
the most numerous groups are nouns (substantive)
– 54% and adjectives – 15% of wordform occur-
rences.

If we don’t take into account number, tsym and
the punctuation tokens, we have a corpus of 348461
tokens (TW) out of which 78854 (29.81%) were
changed. The most frequent changes concerned in-
troducing domain related unit and acronym classes
(nearly 72% of changes). Quite a number of changes

8 Manual Correction

The process of manual correction of the corpus is
now in progress. It is performed using an editor
specially prepared for visualization and facilitation
of the task of correcting the corpus annotation at all
levels. In this section we present conclusions on the
bases of 8 documents corrected by two annotators
(highly experienced linguists). In the case of incon-
sistent corrections the opinion of a third annotator
was taken into account. The process of annotation
checking took about 2x20 hours.

From a total number of 8919 tokens in the dataset,
the verification of 4972 (words, acronyms, units)
was essential, the remaining 3947 tokens represent
numbers, punctuation and tsym tokens. The correc-
tion rules changed the descriptions of 1717 (34%)
tokens, only 87 cases were limited to the change
of a lowercase letter into a capital letter of the
base form. Manual verification left 4497 token de-
scriptions unchanged, while 10.6% of descriptions
were modified (evaluation of TaKIPI by Karwińska
and Przepiórkowski (2009) reports 91.3% accuracy).
Kappa coefficient was equal to 0.983 for part of

98



speech and 0.982 for case assignment (when it is ap-
plicable). The results of manual correction are given
in table 4. The ‘basic tags’ column gives the number
of changes of the base form and tag, while the ‘all
tags’ column takes into account all changes, includ-
ing descriptions of the correct word form in case of
spelling errors, explanations of acronyms or units.

More detailed analysis of annotation inconsisten-
cies shows two main sources of errors:

• lack of precision in guidelines resulted in
choosing different base forms in case of
spelling errors and different labeling of cases
with the lack of diacritics which resulted in cor-
rect but not the desired forms;

• some errors were unnoticed by one of the an-
notators (just cost of manual work), e.g. in the
data there are many strings ‘W’ and ‘w’ which
may be either acronyms or prepositions.

There are only a few cases that represent real
morphological difficulties, e.g. differentiating adjec-
tives and participles (5 cases among the annotators).
Some examples of different case and gender assign-
ments were also observed. They are mostly errors
consisting in correcting only one feature instead of
two, or a wrong choice of a case for long phrases.

9 Conclusions and Further Work

The problems described in the paper are twofold,
some of them are language independent like tok-
enization, description of: abbreviations, acronyms,
foreign expressions and spelling errors; while the
others are specific for rich-morphology languages.
Our experiment showed that analyzing specialized
texts written in highly inflected language with a gen-
eral purpose morphologic analyzer can give satis-
factory results if it is combined with manually cre-
ated global domain dependent rules. Our rules were
created on the basis of a sorted list of all token de-
scriptions. That allowed us to analyze a group of to-
kens with the same base form e.g. an inflected noun.
Additional information concerning the frequency of
each description, indicated which token corrections
would be important.

Unfortunately, the process of rule creation is time-
consuming (it took about 90 hours to create them).
To speed up the process we postulate to prepare

three sets of tokens for which rules will be created
separately. The first one shall contain tokens which
are not recognized by a morphological analyzer, and
hence requiring transformation rules to be created
for them. The second set shall contain tokens with
more than one interpretation, for which a decision is
necessary. Finally we propose to take into account
the set of frequent descriptions. Infrequent tokens
can be left to the manual correction stage as it is eas-
ier to correct them knowing the context.

At the moment our corpus contains three annota-
tion levels – segmentation into tokens, morpholog-
ical tags and semantic annotation. After the first
phase of corpus creation we decided to introduce
an additional level of annotation — extended tok-
enization, see (Marcus Hassler, 2006). Current tok-
enization divides text into simple unstructured frag-
ments. This solution makes it easy to address any
important fragment of a text, but leaves the inter-
pretation of all complex strings to the next levels of
analysis. A new extended tokenization is planned to
create higher level tokens, semantically motivated.
It will allow the annotation of complex strings like:
dates (02.12.2004, 02/12/2004); decimal numbers;
ranges (10 - 15, 10-15); sizes and frequencies (10
x 15, 10x15); complex units (mm/h);abbreviations
with full stops (r. – rok ‘year’); acronyms contain-
ing non-letter characters (K+); complex medication
names (Mono Mack Depot).

Extended tokens can be recognized by rules tak-
ing into account two aspects: specificity of the
domain and problems resulting from careless typ-
ing. In the case of abbreviations and acronyms,
the best method is to use dictionaries, but some
heuristics can be useful too. Electronic dictionar-
ies of acronyms and abbreviations are not available
for Polish, but on the basis of annotated data, a do-
main specific lexicon can be created. Moreover, we
want to test ideas from (Kokkinakis, 2008), the au-
thor presents a method for the application of the
MeSH lexicon (that contains English and Latin data)
to Swedish medical corpus annotation. We will use
a similar approach for acronyms and complex medi-
cation name recognition.
