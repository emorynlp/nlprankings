Abstract

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one
of the toughest problems in NLP, and in
WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to
be extremely difficult, because of high de-
gree of polysemy, too fine grained senses,
absence of deep verb hierarchy and low in-
ter annotator agreement in verb sense an-
notation. Unsupervised WSD has received
widespread attention, but has performed
poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an
unsupervised bilingual EM based algo-
rithm has been proposed, which makes
use only of the raw counts of the transla-
tions in comparable corpora (Marathi and
Hindi). But the performance of this ap-
proach is poor on verbs with accuracy
level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica-
tion to this mentioned formulation, using
context and semantic relatedness of neigh-
boring words. An improvement of 17% -
35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is ob-
tained compared to the existing EM based
approach. On a general note, the work
can be looked upon as contributing to the
framework of unsupervised WSD through
context aware expectation maximization.

1 Introduction

The importance of unsupervised approaches in
WSD is well known, because they do not need
sense tagged corpus. In multilingual unsuper-
vised scenario, either comparable or parallel cor-
pora have been used by past researchers for disam-
biguation (Dagan et al., 1991; Diab and Resnik,
2002; Kaji and Morimoto, 2002; Specia et al.,
2005; Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Khapra et al.,
2011). Recent work by Khapra et al., (2011) has
shown that, in comparable corpora, sense distribu-
tion of a word in one language can be estimated

using the raw counts of translations of the target
words in the other language; such sense distribu-
tions contribute to the ranking of senses. Since
translations can themselves be ambiguous, Expec-
tation Maximization based formulation is used to
determine the sense frequencies. Using this ap-
proach every instance of a word is tagged with the
most probable sense according to the algorithm.

In the above formulation, no importance is
given to the context. That would do, had the ac-
curacy of disambiguation on verbs not been poor
25-35%. This motivated us to propose and inves-
tigate use of context in the formulation by Khapra
et al. (2011).

For example consider the sentence in chem-
istry domain, “Keep the beaker on the flat table.”
In this sentence, the target word ‘table’ will be
tagged as ‘the tabular array’ sense since it is dom-
inant in the chemistry domain by their algorithm.
But its actual sense is ‘a piece of furniture’ which
can be captured only if context is taken into con-
sideration. In our approach we tackle this problem
by taking into account the words from the context
of the target word. We use semantic relatedness
between translations of the target word and those
of its context words to determine its sense.

Verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely
difficult (Jean, 2004), because of high degree of
polysemy (Khapra et al., 2010), too fine grained
senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low in-
ter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation.
On the other hand, verb disambiguation is very
important for NLP applications like MT and IR.
Our approach has shown significant improvement
in verb accuracy as compared to Khapra’s (2011)
approach.

The roadmap of the paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents related work. Section 3 covers the
background work. Section 4 explains the modified
EM formulation using context and semantic relat-
edness. Section 5 presents the experimental setup.

2 Related work

Word Sense Disambiguation is one of the hard-
est problems in NLP. Successful supervised WSD
approaches (Lee et al., 2004; Ng and Lee, 1996)
are restricted to resource rich languages and do-
mains. They are directly dependent on availabil-
ity of good amount of sense tagged data. Creat-
ing such a costly resource for all language-domain
pairs is impracticable looking at the amount of
time and money required. Hence, unsupervised
WSD approaches (Diab and Resnik, 2002; Kaji
and Morimoto, 2002; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Jean,
2004; Khapra et al., 2011) attract most of the re-
searchers.

3 Background

Khapra et al. (2011) dealt with bilingual unsuper-
vised WSD. It uses EM algorithm for estimating
sense distributions in comparable corpora. Ev-
ery polysemous word is disambiguated using the
raw counts of its translations in different senses.
Synset aligned multilingual dictionary (Mohanty
et al., 2008) is used for finding its translations.
In this dictionary, synsets are linked, and after
that the words inside the synsets are also linked.
For example, for the concept of ‘boy’, the Hindi
synset {ladakaa, balak, bachhaa} is linked with
the Marathi synset {mulagaa, poragaa, por}. The
Marathi word ‘mulagaa’ is linked to the Hindi
word ‘ladakaa’ which is its exact lexical substi-
tution.

Suppose words u in language L1 and v in lan-
guage L2 are translations of each other and their
senses are required. The EM based formulation is
as follows:

E-Step:

P (SL1 |u) =

∑

v

P (π
L2
(SL1)|v) ·#(v)

∑

S
L1
i

∑

x

P (π
L2
(SL1i )|x) ·#(x)

where, SL1i ∈ synsetsL1 (u)
v ∈ crosslinks

L2
(u, SL1)

x ∈ crosslinks
L2
(u, SL1i )

M-Step:

P (SL2 |v) =

∑

u

P (π
L1
(SL2)|u) ·#(u)

∑

S
L2
i

∑

y

P (π
L1
(SL2i )|y) ·#(y)

where, SL2i ∈ synsetsL2 (v)
u ∈ crosslinks

L1
(v, SL2)

y ∈ crosslinks
L1
(v, SL2i )

Here,

• ‘#’ indicates the raw count.

• crosslinks
L1
(a, SL2) is the set of possible

translations of the word ‘a’ from language L1
to L2 in the sense SL2 .

• π
L2
(SL1) means the linked synset of the

sense SL1 in L2.

E and M steps are symmetric except for the
change in language. In both the steps, we esti-
mate sense distribution in one language using raw
counts of translations in another language. But
this approach has following limitations:
Poor performance on verbs: This approach gives
poor performance on verbs (25%-38%). See sec-
tion 6.
Same sense throughout the corpus: Every oc-
currence of a word is tagged with the single sense
found by the algorithm, throughout the corpus.
Closed loop of translations: This formulation
does not work for some common words which
have the same translations in all senses. For ex-
ample, the verb ‘karna’ in Hindi has two differ-
ent senses in the corpus viz., ‘to do’ (S1) and ‘to
make’ (S2). In both these senses, it gets trans-
lated as ‘karne’ in Marathi. The word ‘karne’ also
back translates to ‘karna’ in Hindi through both its
senses. In this case, the formulation works out as
follows:

The probabilities are initialized uniformly.
Hence, P (S1|karna) = P (S2|karna) = 0.5.
Now, in first iteration the sense of ‘karne’ will be
estimated as follows (E-step):

P (S1|karne) =
P (S1|karna) ∗#(karna)

#(karna)

= 0.5,

539



P (S2|karne) =
P (S2|karna) ∗#(karna)

#(karna)

= 0.5

Similarly, in M-step, we will get P (S1|karna) =
P (S2|karna) = 0.5. Eventually, it will end up
with initial probabilities and no strong decision
can be made.

To address these problems we have introduced
contextual clues in their formulation by using se-
mantic relatedness.

4 Modified Bilingual EM approach

We introduce context in the EM formulation stated
above and treat the context as a bag of words. We
assume that each word in the context influences
the sense of the target word independently. Hence,

p(S|w,C) =
∏

ci∈C
p(S|w, ci)

where, w is the target word, S is one of the candi-
date synsets of w, C is the set of words in context
(sentence in our case) and ci is one of the context
words.

Suppose we would have sense tagged data,
p(S|w, c) could have been computed as:

p(S|w, c) = #(S,w, c)
#(w, c)

But since the sense tagged corpus is not avail-
able, we cannot find #(S,w, c) from the corpus
directly. However, we can estimate it using the
comparable corpus in other language. Here, we
assume that given a word and its context word
in language L1, the sense distribution in L1 will
be same as that in L2 given the translation of a
word and the translation of its context word in L2.
But these translations can be ambiguous, hence
we can use Expectation Maximization approach
similar to (Khapra et al., 2011) as follows:

E-Step:

P (SL1 |u, a) =

∑

v,b

P (π
L2
(SL1)|v, b) · σ(v, b)

∑

S
L1
i

∑

x,b

P (π
L2
(SL1i )|x, b) · σ(x, b)

where, SL1i ∈ synsetsL1(u)
a ∈ context(u)
v ∈ crosslinks

L2
(u, SL1)

b ∈ crosslinks
L2
(a)

x ∈ crosslinks
L2
(u, SL1i )

crosslinks
L1
(a) is the set of all possible transla-

tions of the word ‘a’ from L1 to L2 in all its senses.
σ(v, b) is the semantic relatedness between the

senses of v and senses of b. Since, v and b go over
all possible translations of u and a respectively.
σ(v, b) has the effect of indirectly capturing the
semantic similarity between the senses of u and
a. A symetric formulation in the M-step below
takes the computation back from language L2 to
language L1. The semantic relatedness comes as
an additional weighing factor, capturing context,
in the probablistic score.
M-Step:

P (SL2 |v, b) =

∑

u,a

P (π
L1
(SL2)|u, a) · σ(u, a)

∑

S
L2
i

∑

y,b

P (π
L1
(SL2i )|y, a) · σ(y, a)

where, SL2i ∈ synsetsL2 (v)
b ∈ context(v)
u ∈ crosslinks

L1
(v, SL2)

a ∈ crosslinksL1(b)
y ∈ crosslinks

L1
(v, SL2i )

σ(u, a) is the semantic relatedness between the
senses of u and senses of a and contributes to the
score like σ(v, b).

Note how the computation moves back and
forth between L1 and L2 considering translations
of both target words and their context words.

In the above formulation, we could have con-
sidered the term #(word, context word) (i.e.,
the co-occurrence count of the translations of
the word and the context word) instead of
σ(word, context word). But it is very unlikely
that every translation of a word will co-occur with

every translation of its context word considerable
number of times. This term may make sense only
if we have arbitrarily large comparable corpus in
the other language.

4.1 Computation of semantic relatedness

The semantic relatedness is computed by taking
the inverse of the length of the shortest path among
two senses in the wordnet graph (Pedersen et al.,
2005). All the semantic relations (including cross-
part-of-speech links) viz., hypernymy, hyponymy,
meronymy, entailment, attribute etc., are used for
computing the semantic relatedness.

Sense scores thus obtained are used to disam-
biguate all words in the corpus. We consider all
the content words from the context for disam-
biguation of a word. The winner sense is the one
with the highest probability.

5 Experimental setup

We have used freely available in-domain compa-
rable corpora1 in Hindi and Marathi languages.
These corpora are available for health and tourism
domains. The dataset is same as that used in
(Khapra et al., 2011) in order to compare the per-
formance.

6 Results

Table 1 and Table 2 compare the performance of
the following two approaches:

1. EM-C (EM with Context): Our modified ap-
proach explained in section 4.

2. EM: Basic EM based approach by Khapra et
al., (2011).

1http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wsd/annotated corpus/

3. WFS: Wordnet First Sense baseline.

4. RB: Random baseline.

Results clearly show that EM-C outperforms EM
especially in case of verbs in all language-domain
pairs. In health domain, verb accuracy is increased
by 35% for Hindi and 17% for Marathi, while in
tourism domain, it is increased by 23% for Hindi
and 17% for Marathi. The overall accuracy is in-
creased by (1.8-2.8%) for health domain and (1.5-
1.7%) for tourism domain. Since there are less
number of verbs, the improved accuracy is not di-
rectly reflected in the overall performance.

7 Error analysis and phenomena study

Our approach tags all the instances of a word de-
pending on its context as apposed to basic EM ap-
proach. For example, consider the following sen-
tence from the tourism domain:

vh p� х�l rh� T�।
(vaha patte khel rahe the)

(They were playing cards/leaves)

Here, the word p� (plural form of pA) has two
senses viz., ‘leaf’ and ‘playing card’. In tourism
domain, the ‘leaf’ sense is more dominant. Hence,
basic EM will tag p� with ‘leaf’ sense. But it’s
true sense is ‘playing card’. The true sense is cap-
tured only if context is considered. Here, the word
х�lnA (to play) (root form of х�l) endorses the
‘playing card’ sense of the word pA. This phe-
nomenon is captured by our approach through se-
mantic relatedness.

But there are certain cases where our algorithm
fails. For example, consider the following sen-
tence:

541



vh p�X к� Enc� p� х�l rh� T�।
(vaha ped ke niche patte khel rahe the)

(They were playing cards/leaves below the tree)

Here, two strong context words p�X (tree) and
х�l (play) are influencing the sense of the word
p�. Semantic relatedness between p�X (tree) and
pA (leaf) is more than that ofх�l (play) and pA
(playing card). Hence, the ‘leaf sense’ is assigned
to pA.

This problem occurred because we considered
the context as a bag of words. This problem can
be solved by considering the semantic structure
of the sentence. In this example, the word pA
(leaf/playing card) is the subject of the verbх�lnA
(to play) while p�X (tree) is not even in the same
clause with pA (leaf/playing cards). Thus we
could consider х�lnA (to play) as the stronger clue
for its disambiguation.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a context aware EM formula-
tion building on the framework of Khapra et al
(2011). Our formulation solves the problems of
“inhibited progress due to lack of translation diver-
sity” and “uniform sense assignment, irrespective
of context” that the previous EM based formula-
tion of Khapra et al. suffers from. More impor-
tantly our accuracy on verbs is much higher and
more than the state of the art, to the best of our
knowledge. Improving the performance on other
parts of speech is the primary future work. Fu-
ture directions also point to usage of semantic role
clues, investigation of familialy apart pair of lan-
guages and effect of variation of measures of se-
mantic relatedness.
