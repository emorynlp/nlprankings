Abstract

We study the challenges raised by Ara-
bic verb and subject detection and re-
ordering in Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT). We show that post-verbal sub-
ject (VS) constructions are hard to trans-
late because they have highly ambiguous
reordering patterns when translated to En-
glish. In addition, implementing reorder-
ing is difficult because the boundaries of
VS constructions are hard to detect accu-
rately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic
dependency parser. We therefore propose
to reorder VS constructions into SV or-
der for SMT word alignment only. This
strategy significantly improves BLEU and
TER scores, even on a strong large-scale
baseline and despite noisy parses.

1 Introduction

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a morpho-
syntactically complex language, with different
phenomena from English, a fact that raises many
interesting issues for natural language processing
and Arabic-to-English statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT). While comprehensive Arabic prepro-
cessing schemes have been widely adopted for
handling Arabic morphology in SMT (e.g., Sa-
dat and Habash (2006), Zollmann et al. (2006),
Lee (2004)), syntactic issues have not received
as much attention by comparison (Green et
al. (2009), Crego and Habash (2008), Habash
(2007)). Arabic verbal constructions are par-
ticularly challenging since subjects can occur in
pre-verbal (SV), post-verbal (VS) or pro-dropped
(“null subject”) constructions. As a result, training
data for learning verbal construction translations
is split between the different constructions and
their patterns; and complex reordering schemas
are needed in order to translate them into primarily

pre-verbal subject languages (SVO) such as En-
glish.

These issues are particularly problematic in
phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003). Standard
phrase-based SMT systems memorize phrasal
translation of verb and subject constructions as ob-
served in the training bitext. They do not cap-
ture any generalizations between occurrences in
VS and SV orders, even for the same verbs. In
addition, their distance-based reordering models
are not well suited to handling complex reorder-
ing operations which can include long distance
dependencies, and may vary by context. Despite
these limitations, phrase-based SMT systems have
achieved competitive results in Arabic-to-English
benchmark evaluations.1 However, error analysis
shows that verbs are still often dropped or incor-
rectly translated, and subjects are split or garbled
in translation. This suggests that better syntactic
modeling should further improve SMT.

We attempt to get a better understanding of
translation patterns for Arabic verb constructions,
particularly VS constructions, by studying their
occurrence and reordering patterns in a hand-
aligned Arabic-English parallel treebank. Our
analysis shows that VS reordering rules are not
straightforward and that SMT should therefore
benefit from direct modeling of Arabic verb sub-
ject translation. In order to detect VS construc-
tions, we use our state-of-the-art Arabic depen-
dency parser, which is essentially the CATIBEX
baseline in our subsequent parsing work in Mar-
ton et al. (2010), and is further described there. We
show that VS subjects and their exact boundaries
are hard to identify accurately. Given the noise
in VS detection, existing strategies for source-side
reordering (e.g., Xia and McCord (2004), Collins
et al. (2005), Wang et al. (2007)) or using de-

Table 1: How are Arabic SV and VS translated in
the manually word-aligned Arabic-English paral-
lel treebank? We check whether V and S are trans-
lated in a “monotone” or “inverted” order for all
VS and SV constructions. “Overlap” represents
instances where translations of the Arabic verb
and subject have some English words in common,
and are not monotone nor inverted.

pendency parses as cohesion constraints in decod-
ing (e.g., Cherry (2008); Bach et al. (2009)) are
not effective at this stage. While these approaches
have been successful for language pairs such as
German-English for which syntactic parsers are
more developed and relevant reordering patterns
might be less ambiguous, their impact potential on
Arabic-English translation is still unclear.

In this work, we focus on VS constructions
only, and propose a new strategy in order to bene-
fit from their noisy detection: for the word align-
ment stage only, we reorder phrases detected as
VS constructions into an SV order. Then, for
phrase extraction, weight optimization and decod-
ing, we use the original (non-reordered) text. This
approach significantly improves both BLEU and
TER on top of strong medium and large-scale
phrase-based SMT baselines.

2 VS reordering in gold Arabic-English
translation

We use the manually word-aligned parallel
Arabic-English Treebank (LDC2009E82) to study
how Arabic VS constructions are translated into
English by humans. Given the gold Arabic syn-
tactic parses and the manual Arabic-English word
alignments, we can determine the gold reorder-
ings for SV and VS constructions. We extract VS
representations from the gold constituent parses
by deterministic conversion to a simplified depen-
dency structure, CATiB (Habash and Roth, 2009)

(see Section 3). We then check whether the En-
glish translations of the Arabic verb and the Ara-
bic subject occur in the same order as in Arabic
(monotone) or not (inverted). Table 1 summa-
rizes the reordering patterns for each category. As
expected, 98% of Arabic SV are translated in a
monotone order in English. For VS constructions,
the picture is surprisingly more complex. The
monotone VS translations are mostly explained
by changes to passive voice or to non-verbal con-
structions (such as nominalization) in the English
translation.

In addition, Table 1 shows that verb subjects oc-
cur more frequently in VS order (70%) than in SV
order (30%). These numbers do not include pro-
dropped (“null subject”) constructions.

3 Arabic VS construction detection

Even if the SMT system had perfect knowledge
of VS reordering, it has to accurately detect VS
constructions and their spans in order to apply
the reordering correctly. For that purpose, we
use our state-of-ther-art parsing model, which is
essentially the CATIBEX baseline model in Mar-
ton et al. (2010), and whose details we summa-
rize next. We train a syntactic dependency parser,
MaltParser v1.3 with the Nivre “eager” algorithm
(Nivre, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006; Nivre, 2008) on
the training portion of the Penn Arabic Treebank
part 3 v3.1, hereafter PATB3 (Maamouri et al.,
2008; Maamouri et al., 2009). The training / de-
velopment split is the same as in Zitouni et al.
(2006). We convert the PATB3 representation into
the succinct CATiB format, with 8 dependency
relations and 6 POS tags, which we then extend
to a set of 44 tags using regular expressions of
the basic POS and the normalized surface word
form, similarly to Marton et al. (2010), following
Habash and Roth (2009). We normalize Alif Maq-
sura to Ya, and Hamzated Alifs to bare Alif, as is
commonly done in Arabic SMT.

For analysis purposes, we evaluate our subject
and verb detection on the development part of
PATB3 using gold POS tags. There are various
ways to go about it. We argue that combined de-
tection statistics of constructions of verbs and their
subjects (VATS), for which we achieve an F-score
of 74%, are more telling for the task at hand.2

2We divert from the CATiB representation in that a non-
matrix subject of a pseudo verb (An and her sisters) is treated
as a subject of the verb that is under the same pseudo verb.
This treatment of said subjects is comparable to the PATB’s.

179



These scores take into account the spans of both
the subject and the specific verb it belongs to, and
potentially reorder with. We also provide statistics
of VS detection separately (F-score 63%), since
we only handle VS here. This low score can be
explained by the difficulty in detecting the post-
verbal subject’s end boundary, and the correct verb
the subject belongs to. The SV construction scores
are higher, presumably since the pre-verbal sub-
ject’s end is bounded by the verb it belongs to. See
Table 2.

Although not directly comparable, our VS
scores are similar to those of Green et al. (2009).
Their VS detection technique with conditional
random fields (CRF) is different from ours in by-
passing full syntactic parsing, and in only detect-
ing maximal (non-nested) subjects of verb-initial
clauses. Additionally, they use a different train-
ing / test split of the PATB data (parts 1, 2 and 3).
They report 65.9% precision and 61.3% F-score.
Note that a closer score comparison should take
into account their reported verb detection accuracy
of 98.1%.

structions of Arabic verbs and their subjects, eval-

4 Reordering Arabic VS for SMT word
alignment

Based on these analyses, we propose a new
method to help phrase-based SMT systems deal
with Arabic-English word order differences due to
VS constructions. As in related work on syntactic
reordering by preprocessing, our method attempts
to make Arabic and English word order closer to
each other by reordering Arabic VS constructions
into SV. However, unlike in previous work, the re-
ordered Arabic sentences are used only for word
alignment. Phrase translation extraction and de-

coding are performed on the original Arabic word
order. Preliminary experiments on an earlier ver-
sion of the large-scale SMT system described in
Section 6 showed that forcing reordering of all
VS constructions at training and test time does
not have a consistent impact on translation qual-
ity: for instance, on the NIST MT08-NW test set,
TER slightly improved from 44.34 to 44.03, while
BLEU score decreased from 49.21 to 49.09.

Limiting reordering to alignment allows the sys-
tem to be more robust and recover from incorrect
changes introduced either by incorrect VS detec-
tion, or by incorrect reordering of a correctly de-
tected VS. Given a parallel sentence (a, e), we
proceed as follows:

1. automatically tag VS constructions in a
2. generate new sentence a′ = reorder(a) by

reordering Arabic VS into SV
3. get word alignment wa′ on new sentence pair

(a′, e)

4. using mapping from a to a′, get correspond-
ing word alignment wa = unreorder(wa′)
for the original sentence pair (a, e)

5 Experiment set-up

We use the open-source Moses toolkit (Koehn et
al., 2007) to build two phrase-based SMT systems
trained on two different data conditions:

• medium-scale the bitext consists of 12M
words on the Arabic side (LDC2007E103).
The language model is trained on the English
side of the large bitext.

• large-scale the bitext consists of several
newswire LDC corpora, and has 64M words
on the Arabic side. The language model is
trained on the English side of the bitext aug-
mented with Gigaword data.

Except from this difference in training data, the
two systems are identical. They use a standard
phrase-based architecture. The parallel corpus is
word-aligned using the GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003), which sequentially learns word alignments
for the IBM1, HMM, IBM3 and IBM4 models.
The resulting alignments in both translation di-
rections are intersected and augmented using the
grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2007).
Phrase translations of up to 10 words are extracted
in the Moses phrase-table. We apply statistical
significance tests to prune unreliable phrase-pairs

180



and score remaining phrase-table entries (Chen et
al., 2009). We use a 5-gram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Feature weights
are tuned to maximize BLEU on the NIST MT06
test set.

For all systems, the English data is tokenized
using simple punctuation-based rules. The Arabic
side is segmented according to the Arabic Tree-
bank (PATB3) tokenization scheme (Maamouri et
al., 2009) using the MADA+TOKAN morpholog-
ical analyzer and tokenizer (Habash and Rambow,
2005). MADA-produced Arabic lemmas are used
for word alignment.

6 Results

We evaluate translation quality using both BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al.,
2006) scores on three standard evaluation test
sets from the NIST evaluations, which yield more
than 4400 test sentences with 4 reference transla-
tions. On this large data set, our VS reordering
method remarkably yields statistically significant
improvements in BLEU and TER on the medium
and large SMT systems at the 99% confidence
level (Table 3).

Results per test set are reported in Table 4. TER
scores are improved in all 10 test configurations,
and BLEU scores are improved in 8 out of the 10
configurations. Results on the MT08 test set show
that improvements are obtained both on newswire
and on web text as measured by TER (but not
BLEU score on the web section.) It is worth noting
that consistent improvements are obtained even on
the large-scale system, and that both baselines are
full-fledged systems, which include lexicalized re-
ordering and large 5-gram language models.

Analysis shows that our VS reordering tech-
nique improves word alignment coverage (yield-
ing 48k and 330k additional links on the medium
and large scale systems respectively). This results
in larger phrase-tables which improve translation
quality.

7 Related work

To the best of our knowledge, the only other ap-
proach to detecting and using Arabic verb-subject
constructions for SMT is that of Green et al.
(2009) (see Section 3), which failed to improve
Arabic-English SMT. In contrast with our reorder-
ing approach, they integrate subject span informa-
tion as a log-linear model feature which encour-

ages a phrase-based SMT decoder to use phrasal
translations that do not break subject boundaries.

Syntactically motivated reordering for phrase-
based SMT has been more successful on language
pairs other than Arabic-English, perhaps due to
more accurate parsers and less ambiguous reorder-
ing patterns than for Arabic VS. For instance,
Collins et al. (2005) apply six manually defined
transformations to German parse trees which im-
prove German-English translation by 0.4 BLEU
on the Europarl task. Xia and McCord (2004)
learn reordering rules for French to English trans-
lations, which arguably presents less syntactic dis-
tortion than Arabic-English. Zhang et al. (2007)
limit reordering to decoding for Chinese-English
SMT using a lattice representation. Cherry (2008)
uses dependency parses as cohesion constraints in
decoding for French-English SMT.

For Arabic-English phrase-based SMT, the im-
pact of syntactic reordering as preprocessing is
less clear. Habash (2007) proposes to learn syntac-
tic reordering rules targeting Arabic-English word
order differences and integrates them as deter-
ministic preprocessing. He reports improvements
in BLEU compared to phrase-based SMT limited
to monotonic decoding, but these improvements
do not hold with distortion. Instead of apply-
ing reordering rules deterministically, Crego and
Habash (2008) use a lattice input to represent alter-
nate word orders which improves a ngram-based
SMT system. But they do not model VS construc-
tions explicitly.

Most previous syntax-aware word alignment
models were specifically designed for syntax-
based SMT systems. These models are often
bootstrapped from existing word alignments, and
could therefore benefit from our VS reordering ap-
proach. For instance, Fossum et al. (2008) report
improvements ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 BLEU on
Arabic translation by learning to delete alignment

links if they degrade their syntax-based translation
system. Departing from commonly-used align-
ment models, Hermjakob (2009) aligns Arabic and
English content words using pointwise mutual in-
formation, and in this process indirectly uses En-
glish sentences reordered into VS order to collect
cooccurrence counts. The approach outperforms
GIZA++ on a small-scale translation task, but the
impact of reordering alone is not evaluated.

8 Conclusion and future work

We presented a novel method for improving over-
all SMT quality using a noisy syntactic parser: we
use these parses to reorder VS constructions into
SV for word alignment only. This approach in-
creases word alignment coverage and significantly
improves BLEU and TER scores on two strong
SMT baselines.

In subsequent work, we show that matrix (main-
clause) VS constructions are reordered much more
frequently than non-matrix VS, and that limit-
ing reordering to matrix VS constructions for
word alignment further improves translation qual-
ity (Carpuat et al., 2010). In the future, we plan to
improve robustness to parsing errors by using not
just one, but multiple subject boundary hypothe-
ses. We will also investigate the integration of VS
reordering in SMT decoding.
