Abstract

This paper describes the statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems developed by
RWTH Aachen University for the translation
task of the EMNLP 2011 Sixth Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation. Both phrase-
based and hierarchical SMT systems were
trained for the constrained German-English
and French-English tasks in all directions. Ex-
periments were conducted to compare differ-
ent training data sets, training methods and op-
timization criteria, as well as additional mod-
els on dependency structure and phrase re-
ordering. Further, we applied a system com-
bination technique to create a consensus hy-
pothesis from several different systems.

1 Overview

We sketch the baseline architecture of RWTH’s se-
tups for the WMT 2011 shared translation task by
providing an overview of our translation systems in
Section 2. In addition to the baseline features, we
adopted several novel methods, which will be pre-
sented in Section 3. Details on the respective se-
tups and translation results for the French-English
and German-English language pairs (in both trans-
lation directions) are given in Sections 4 and 5. We
finally conclude the paper in Section 6.

2 Translation Systems

For the WMT 2011 evaluation we utilized RWTH’s
state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical trans-
lation systems as well as our in-house system com-
bination framework. GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)

was employed to train word alignments, language
models have been created with the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002).

2.1 Phrase-Based System

We applied a phrase-based translation (PBT) system
similar to the one described in (Zens and Ney, 2008).
Phrase pairs are extracted from a word-aligned bilin-
gual corpus and their translation probability in both
directions is estimated by relative frequencies. The
standard feature set moreover includes an n-gram
language model, phrase-level single-word lexicons
and word-, phrase- and distortion-penalties. To lexi-
calize reordering, a discriminative reordering model
(Zens and Ney, 2006a) is used. Parameters are opti-
mized with the Downhill-Simplex algorithm (Nelder
and Mead, 1965) on the word graph.

2.2 Hierarchical System

For the hierarchical setups described in this paper,
the open source Jane toolkit (Vilar et al., 2010) was
employed. Jane has been developed at RWTH and
implements the hierarchical approach as introduced
by Chiang (2007) with some state-of-the-art exten-
sions. In hierarchical phrase-based translation, a
weighted synchronous context-free grammar is in-
duced from parallel text. In addition to contiguous
lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases with up to two
gaps are extracted. The search is typically carried
out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang and
Chiang, 2007). The standard models integrated into
our Jane systems are: phrase translation probabil-
ities and lexical translation probabilities on phrase
level, each for both translation directions, length

405



penalties on word and phrase level, three binary fea-
tures marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule, and
rules with non-terminals at the boundaries, source-
to-target and target-to-source phrase length ratios,
four binary count features and an n-gram language
model. The model weights are optimized with stan-
dard MERT (Och, 2003) on 100-best lists.

2.3 System Combination

System combination is used to produce consensus
translations from multiple hypotheses produced with
different translation engines that are better in terms
of translation quality than any of the individual hy-
potheses. The basic concept of RWTH’s approach
to machine translation system combination has been
described by Matusov et al. (Matusov et al., 2006;
Matusov et al., 2008). This approach includes an
enhanced alignment and reordering framework. A
lattice is built from the input hypotheses. The trans-
lation with the best score within the lattice according
to a couple of statistical models is selected as con-
sensus translation.

3 Translation Modeling

We incorporated several novel methods into our sys-
tems for the WMT 2011 evaluation. This section
provides a short survey of three of the methods
which we suppose to be of particular interest.

3.1 Language Model Data Selection

For the English and German language models,
we applied the data selection method proposed in
(Moore and Lewis, 2010). Each sentence is scored
by the difference in cross-entropy between a lan-
guage model trained from in-domain data and a lan-
guage model trained from a similar-sized sample of
the out-of-domain data. As in-domain data we used
the news-commentary corpus. The out-of-domain
data from which the data was selected are the news
crawl corpus for both languages and for English the
109 corpus and the LDC Gigaword data. We used a
3-gram trained with the SRI toolkit to compute the
cross-entropy. For the news crawl corpus, only 1/8
of the sentences were discarded. Of the 109 corpus
we retained 1/2 and of the LDC Gigaword data we
retained 1/4 of the sentences to train the language
models.

3.2 Phrase Model Training

For the German→English and French→English
translation tasks we applied a forced alignment pro-
cedure to train the phrase translation model with the
EM algorithm, similar to the one described in (DeN-
ero et al., 2006). Here, the phrase translation prob-
abilities are estimated from their relative frequen-
cies in the phrase-aligned training data. The phrase
alignment is produced by a modified version of the
translation decoder. In addition to providing a statis-
tically well-founded phrase model, this has the ben-
efit of producing smaller phrase tables and thus al-
lowing more rapid experiments. A detailed descrip-
tion of the training procedure is given in (Wuebker
et al., 2010).

3.3 Soft String-to-Dependency

Given a dependency tree of the target language,
we are able to introduce language models that span
over longer distances than the usual n-grams, as in
(Shen et al., 2008). To obtain dependency structures,
we apply the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning,
2003) on the target side of the training material.
RWTH’s open source hierarchical translation toolkit
Jane has been extended to include dependency infor-
mation in the phrase table and to build dependency
trees on the output hypotheses at decoding time from
this information.

Shen et al. (2008) use only phrases that meet cer-
tain restrictions. The first possibility is what the au-
thors call a fixed dependency structure. With the
exception of one word within this phrase, called
the head, no outside word may have a dependency
within this phrase. Also, all inner words may only
depend on each other or on the head. For a second
structure, called a floating dependency structure, the
head dependency word may also exist outside the
phrase. If the dependency structure of a phrase con-
forms to these restrictions, it is denoted as valid.

In our phrase table, we mark those phrases that
possess a valid dependency structure with a binary
feature, but all phrases are retained as translation op-
tions. In addition to storing the dependency informa-
tion, we also memorize for all hierarchical phrases
if the content of gaps has been dependent on the left
or on the right side. We utilize the dependency in-
formation during the search process by adding three

features to the log-linear model: merging errors to
the left, merging errors to the right, and the ratio of
valid vs. non-valid dependency structures. The de-
coder computes the corresponding costs when it tries
to construct a dependency tree of a (partial) hypothe-
sis on-the-fly by merging the dependency structures
of the used phrase pairs.

In an n-best reranking step, we compute depen-
dency language model scores on the dependencies
which were assembled on the hypotheses by the
search procedure. We apply one language model
for left-side dependencies and one for right-side de-
pendencies. For head structures, we also compute
their scores by exploiting a simple unigram language
model. We furthermore include a language count
feature that is incremented each time we compute
a dependency language model score. As trees with
few dependencies have less individual costs to be
computed, they tend to obtain lower overall costs
than trees with more complex structures in other
sentences. The intention behind this feature is thus
comparable to the word penalty in combination with
a normal n-gram language model.

4 French-English Setups

We set up both hierarchical and standard phrase-
based systems for the constrained condition of the
WMT 2011 French→English and English→French
translation tasks. The English→French RWTH pri-
mary submission was produced with a single hierar-
chical system, while a system combination of three
systems was used to generate a final hypothesis for
the French→English primary submission.

Besides the Europarl and news-commentary cor-
pora, the provided parallel data also comprehends

the large French-English 109 corpus and the French-
English UN corpus. Since model training with
such a huge amount of data requires a consider-
able computational effort, RWTH decided to select
a high-quality part of altogether about 2 Mio. sen-
tence pairs from the latter two corpora. The selec-
tion of parallel sentences was carried out according
to three criteria: (1) Only sentences of minimum
length of 4 tokens are considered, (2) at least 92%
of the vocabulary of each sentence occurs in new-
stest2008, and (3) the ratio of the vocabulary size
of a sentence and the number of its tokens is mini-
mum 80%. Word alignments in both directions were
trained with GIZA++ and symmetrized according to
the refined method that was proposed in (Och and
Ney, 2003). The phrase tables of the translation
systems are extracted from the Europarl and news-
commentary parallel training data as well as the se-
lected high-quality parts the 109 and UN corpora
only. The only exception is the hierarchical system
used for the English→French RWTH primary sub-
mission which comprehends a second phrase table
with lexical (i.e. non-hierarchical) phrases extracted
from the full parallel data (approximately 30 Mio.
sentence pairs).

Detailed statistics of the high-quality parallel
training data (Europarl, news-commentary, and the
selected parts of the 109 and UN corpora) are given
in Table 1, the corpus statistics of the full parallel
data from which the second phrase table with lexi-
cal phrases for the English→French RWTH primary
system was created are presented in Table 2.

The translation systems use large 4-gram lan-
guage models with modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing. The French language model was trained on
most of the provided French data including the
monolingual LDC Gigaword corpora, the English

language model was trained on automatically se-
lected English data (cf. Section 3.1) from the pro-
vided resources including the 109 corpus and LDC
Gigaword.

The scaling factors of the log-linear model com-
bination are optimized towards BLEU on new-
stest2009, newstest2010 is used as an unseen test set.

4.1 Experimental Results French→English

The results for the French→English task are given in
Table 3. RWTH’s three submissions – one primary
and two contrastive – are labeled accordingly in the
table. The first contrastive submission is a phrase-
based system with a standard feature set plus an ad-
ditional triplet lexicon model (Mauser et al., 2009).
The triplet lexicon model was trained on in-domain
news commentary data only. The second contrastive
submission is a hierarchical Jane system with three
syntax-based extensions: A parse match model (Vi-
lar et al., 2008), soft syntactic labels (Stein et al.,
2010), and the soft string-to-dependency extension
as described in Section 3.3. The primary submis-
sion combines the phrase-based contrastive system,
a hierarchical system that is very similar to the Jane
contrastive submission but with a slightly worse lan-
guage model, and an additional PBT system that has
been trained with forced alignment (Wuebker et al.,

2010) on WMT 2010 data only.

4.2 Experimental Results English→French
The results for the English→French task are given
in Table 4. We likewise submitted two contrastive
systems for this translation direction. The first con-
trastive submission is a phrase-based system, en-
hanced with a triplet lexicon model and a discrim-
inative word lexicon model (Mauser et al., 2009) –
both trained on in-domain news commentary data
only – as well as a sentence-level single-word lex-
icon model and a discriminative reordering model
(Zens and Ney, 2006a). The second contrastive sub-
mission is a hierarchical Jane system with shallow
rules (Iglesias et al., 2009), a triplet lexicon model, a
discriminative word lexicon, the parse match model,
and a second phrase table extracted from in-domain
data only. Our primary submission is very similar
to the latter Jane setup. It does not comprise the ex-
tended lexicon models and the parse match exten-
sion, but instead includes lexical phrases from the
full 30 Mio. sentence corpus as described above.

5 German-English Setups

tion systems for both translation directions of the

tics can be found in Table 5. Word alignments were
generated with GIZA++ and symmetrized as for the
French-English setups.

The language models are 4-grams trained on the
bilingual data as well as the provided News crawl
corpus. For the English language model the 109

French-English and LDC Gigaword corpora were
used additionally. For the 109 French-English and
LDC Gigaword corpora RWTH applied the data se-
lection technique described in Section 3.1. We ex-
amined two different language models, one with
LDC data and one without.

Systems were optimized on the newstest2009 data
set, newstest2008 was used as test set. The scores
for newstest2010 are included for completeness.

5.1 Morpho-Syntactic Analysis
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for
the German→English translation, the source side
was preprocessed by splitting German compound
words with the frequency-based method described
in (Koehn and Knight, 2003). To further reduce
translation complexity, we performed the long-range
part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by
(Popović et al., 2006). For additional experiments
we used the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) to produce
a lemmatized version of the German source.

5.2 Optimization Criterion
We studied the impact of different optimization cri-
teria on tranlsation performance. The usual prac-
tice is to optimize the scaling factors to maximize
BLEU. We also experimented with two different
combinations of BLEU and Translation Edit Rate
(TER): TER−BLEU and TER−4BLEU. The first
denotes the equally weighted combination, while for
the latter BLEU is weighted 4 times as strong as
TER.

5.3 Experimental Results German→English

For the German→English task we conducted ex-
periments comparing the standard phrase extraction
with the phrase training technique described in Sec-
tion 3.2. For the latter we applied log-linear phrase-
table interpolation as proposed in (Wuebker et al.,
2010). Further experiments included the use of addi-
tional language model training data, reranking of n-
best lists generated by the phrase-based system, and
different optimization criteria. We also carried out
a system combination of several systems, including
phrase-based systems on lemmatized German and
on source data without compound splitting and two
hierarchical systems optimized for different criteria.
The results are given in Table 6.

A considerable increase in translation quality can
be achieved by application of German compound
splitting. The system that operates on German
surface forms without compound splitting (SUR)
clearly underperforms the baseline system with mor-
phological preprocessing. The system on lemma-
tized German (LEM) is at about the same level as
the system on surface forms.

In comparison to the standard heuristic phrase ex-
traction technique, performing phrase training (FA)
gives an improvement in BLEU on newstest2008
and newstest2009, but a degradation in TER. The
addition of LDC Gigaword corpora (+GW) to the
language model training data shows improvements
in both BLEU and TER. Reranking was done on
1000-best lists generated by the the best available
system (PBT (FA)+GW). Following models were
applied: n-gram posteriors (Zens and Ney, 2006b),
sentence length model, a 6-gram LM and single-
word lexicon models in both normal and inverse di-
rection. These models are combined in a log-linear
fashion and the scaling factors are tuned in the same
manner as the baseline system (using TER−4BLEU
on newstest2009).

The table includes three identical Jane systems
which are optimized for different criteria. The one
optimized for TER−4BLEU offers the best balance
between BLEU and TER, but was not finished in
time for submission. As primary submission we
chose the reranked PBT system, as secondary the
system combination.

5.4 Experimental Results English→German
We likewise studied the effect of using BLEU only
versus using TER−4BLEU as optimization crite-
rion in the English→German translation direction.
Moreover, we tested the impact of the discriminative
reordering model (Zens and Ney, 2006a). The re-
sults can be found in Table 7. For the phrase-based
system, optimizing towards TER−4BLEU leads to
slightly better results both in BLEU and TER than
optimizing towards BLEU. Using the discriminative
reordering model yields some improvements both on
newstest2008 and newstest2010. In the case of the
hierarchical system, the effect of the optimization
criterion is more pronounced than for the phrase-
based system. However, in this case it clearly leads
to a tradeoff between BLEU and TER, as the choice
of TER−4BLEU harms the translation results of
test2010 with respect to BLEU.

6 Conclusion

For the participation in the WMT 2011 shared trans-
lation task, RWTH experimented with both phrase-
based and hierarchical translation systems. We used
all bilingual and monolingual data provided for the
constrained track. To limit the size of the lan-
guage model, a data selection technique was applied.
Several techniques yielded improvements over the
baseline, including three syntactic models, extended
lexicon models, a discriminative reordering model,
forced alignment training, reranking methods and
different optimization criteria.
