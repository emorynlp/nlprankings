Abstract 

This paper presents the Lexicon-Grammar classification of Italian idioms that has been constructed on 
formal principles and, as such, can be exploited in information extraction. Among MWEs, idioms are 
those fixed constructions which are hard to automatically detect, given their syntactic flexibility and 
lexical variation. The syntactic properties of idioms have been formally represented and coded in bi-
nary matrixes according to the Lexicon-Grammar framework. The research takes into account idioms 
with ordinary verbs as well as support verb idiomatic constructions. The overall classification counts 
7,000+ Italian idioms. In particular, two binary matrixes of two classes of idioms will be presented. 
The class C1 refers to the Verb + Object constructions, whereas the class EPC refers to the preposi-
tional constructions with the support verb essere. Pre-constructed lexical resources facilitate idioms 
retrieval both in the case of "hybrid" and "knowledge-based" approaches to Natural Language Pro-
cessing. 

 

1 Introduction 
Idioms, and multi-word expressions in general, have always been "a pain in the neck", as Sag et al. 
(2001) state in the title of their paper. The formal representation and the construction of a computa-
tional linguistic model of idioms is not an easy task as shown by Gazdar et al. (1985), Pulman (1993), 
Abeillé (1995), Villavicencio et al. (2004), Muzny and Zettlemoyer (2013) to name a few of the many 
(computational) linguists who have carried out research on this topic. 

It has always been pointed out that the main problem concerning the automatic analysis of idioms 
is the difficulty to disambiguate such constructions which are ambiguous by definition (Fothergill and 
Baldwin 2012, Li and Sporlender 2009, Fazly et al. 2009, McShane and Nirenburg 2014). However, 
given the flexibility of idioms, a more basic and still unsolved problem has to be taken into account: 
that is, the extraction and annotation of such constructions (Fellbaum 2011).  

As Fazly et al. (2009, p. 61) point out "despite a great deal of research on the properties of idioms in 
the linguistics literature, there is not much agreement on which properties are characteristics of these 
expressions". The distinction drawn by Nunberg et al. (1994) between idiomatic phrases and idiomati-
cally combining expressions has been adopted by most of the research on idioms. However, many 
problems still remain and they are due to two basic reasons. On one hand, idioms can be considered 
lexical units, given the fact that their "special meaning" is associated to a particular verb and one or 
more particular complements. On the other hand, idioms syntactically behave as non-idiomatic con-
structions. Passive is the syntactic construction more frequently analyzed by the linguistic research on 
idioms since it involves the occurrence of the fixed object to the left of the verb. However, idioms 
show a great deal of other syntactic constructions where the fixed object may not necessarily occur in 
postverbal position (see Vietri 2014, forthcoming). 

It is for these peculiarities that idioms have also aroused the interest of the psycholinguistic re-
searchers who have advanced several hypothesis on the processing of idioms (Swinney and Cutler,

1979; Gibbs, 1995; Cacciari and Tabossi, 1988; Cutting and Bock, 1997; Sprenger et al., 2006). 
The systematic description of French idiomatic and non-idiomatic constructions has been carried 

out by Gross (1982, 1988) and his colleagues (Leclère, 2002) on the basis of the formal principles of 
the Lexicon-Grammar methodology, as developed by Gross (1975, 1979). According to Gross, the 
basic syntactic unit is not the word but the simple or elementary sentence, and the Lexicon-Grammar 
of a language is organized into three main components: free sentences, frozen sentences (or idioms), 
support verbs sentences (Gross 1981, 1998). For each component, Gross and his colleagues built ex-
haustive classifications, systematically organized and represented by binary matrixes (named Lexicon-
Grammar tables), where each syntactic and/or distributional property is marked "+" or "-" if accepted 
or not by a certain lexical unit. In the Lexicon-Grammar methodology, idiomatic and non-idiomatic 
constructions are built according to the same formal principles. The difference between these two 
types of constructions mainly concerns the distribution: idioms show a higher level of restricted distri-
bution than non-idioms. The French Lexicon-Grammars are available at http://infolingu.univ-
mlv.fr/english/. 

A classification of English idioms and phrasal verbs has been carried out according to the same 
formal principles and criteria, respectively, by Freckleton (1985) and Machonis (1985). A Lexicon-
Grammar of European Portuguese idioms has been built by Baptista (2005a, 2005b). 

The Lexicon-Grammar classification of Italian idioms has been implemented on the basis of Gross' 
methodology. It includes more than 30 Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms with ordinary verbs (sec. 
2) and support verbs (sec. 3), for a total of more than 7,000 lexical entries1. The binary matrixes are 
created in Excel format. 

2 The Lexicon-Grammar of Italian Idioms with Ordinary Verbs 
The Lexicon-Grammar of idioms using ordinary verbs includes 12 classes for a total of 3,990 entries 
(sec. 2.1, Table 1). Each class of idioms contains those constructions which share the same definitional 
structure. In the Lexicon-Grammar framework, the definitional structure is identified on the basis of 
the arguments required by the operators (see Harris 1982). In the case of idioms, the operator consists 
of the Verb and the Fixed element(s), while the argument may be the subject and/or a free comple-
ment. This section shows only the main differences between the idioms' classes C1 and CAN.  

For example, idioms in (1) and (2) have two different definitional structures. On one hand, an idiom 
such as tagliare la corda in (1) is an operator that requires only one argument, i.e. the subject. On the 
other hand, an idiom such as rompere le balle in (2) is an operator that requires two arguments, the 
subject and the noun Amy within the prepositional complement. The prepositions a and di alternate 
and can be considered fixed: 
 

1.   Amy ha tagliato la corda   "to sneak off" 
  Amy-has-cut-the-rope 
2.  Joe ha rotto le balle (a + di) Amy  "to annoy sb." 
  Joe-has-broken-the-balls-(to + of)-Amy 

 
Idioms such as (1) have been listed and analyzed in a class named C1, that counts about 1,200 entries. 
Furthermore, C indicates the "constrained" or "fixed" noun and 1 refers to its position in the sentence, 
in this case, the object position. These idioms have only one argument, that is the (non-fixed noun) in 
subject position. The definitional structure of the class C1 is N0 V C1 where N indicates the free noun, 
V the verb and C, as previously stated, the fixed element. The subscripts 0 and 1 indicate the position 
of the noun within the sentence in a linear order, in this case, the subject and the object position. 

Idioms such as (2) have been listed and analyzed in the class named CAN, that counts 320 entries. 
The definitional structure of this class is N0 V C1 (a + di) N2, since these idioms have two arguments, 

                                                 
1 Vietri (1984) includes the very first classification of Italian idioms. Since then, the classification has been widely en-
riched, updated and completely re-examined. For a semantic study of Italian idioms, see Casadei (1996). A Lexicon-
Grammar classification of Verb-particle constructions has been developed by Guglielmo (2013). From a different per-
spective, Masini (2005) provides a synchronic and diacronic analysis of Italian verb-particle constructions found in a 
corpus.

i.e. the subject N0 and the noun N2. The alternation of the prepositions a and di is represented between 
brackets, and the "+" sign indicates "either/or". 

Each class, formally represented by a table in the form of a binary matrix, contains a specific num-
ber of idiomatic entries associated with a specific number of distributional and syntactic properties. In 
particular, each row of the matrix corresponds to an idiom, and each column to a property (or a con-
struction). If the idiom accepts that particular property, a "+" sign is placed at the intersection between 
the row and the column; otherwise a "-" sign occurs. 

As a sample of this type of lexical resource, I will give an excerpt of the class C1 in Figure 1. The 
central non-numbered columns indicate the "part of speech" assigned to each lexical element that con-
stitutes the idiomatic construction. In an idiom like non alzare un dito (lit. not lift a finger), the nega-
tion non is obligatory. On the other hand, the si-pronominal form is obligatory in idioms like leccarsi i 
baffi (lit. lick-si the moustaches). The determiner can be Definite (Def), Indefinite (Ind), or null (Zero). 
As previously pointed out, V refers to the verb and C to the fixed noun. 

The properties from [1] to [3] indicate the distribution of N0, i.e. the subject. It can be expressed by 
[± human] noun or a by a sentence [Ch F]. 

The distributional property [4] indicates if C1 is expressed by a body-part noun, whereas the mor-
phological property [5] indicates if C1 can be in the plural form. Property [4] showed that 1,700+ idi-
oms involve a body-part noun, at least the 24% of the overall classification. Property [5] is a useful 
piece of information because it refers to the possible variation of the fixed noun and, consequently, of 
the determiner.

The syntactic properties are numbered from [6] to [10]. In particular, [6] and [7] refer, respectively, to 
the unaccusative (3b) and the adjectival passive (3c) constructs in which some idioms may occur, as in 
the following:  
 

3a.  Liv ha dipanato la matassa   "to solve a problem" 
  Liv-has-unraveled-the-skein 
3b.  La matassa si è dipanata 
  The skein-si-is-unraveled 
3c.  La matassa è dipanata 
  The-skein-is-unraveled 

 
Properties [8] and [9] indicate two more sentence structures in which idioms may occur. In particular, 
[8] refers to a sentence structure involving the verb avere ('to have') as in (4b): 
 

4a.  Gli operai incrociano le braccia  "to go on strike" 
  The-workers-cross-the-arms 
4b.  Gli operai hanno le braccia incrociate 
  The-workers-have-the-arms-crossed 

 
The syntactic property [9] indicates a particular structure where the verb is in the infinitive form and 
introduced by the preposition da, as in (5b): 
 

5a.  Joe ingoiò un rospo   "to swallow a bitter pill" 
  Joe-swalled-a-toad 
5b.  Joe ha un rospo da ingoiare 
  Joe-has-a-toad-to-swallow 

 
Notice that, in the constructions defined by properties [6]-[9], C1 does not occur in its canonical posi-
tion but to the left of the verb. 

Property [10] concerns the possibility of having a nominalization, as in (6b). Finally, the morpho-
syntactic property [11] shows the formation of a VC compound, as in (7b). The VC compound is ex-
plicitly indicated in the corresponding column. 
 

6a.  Joe ha alzato la testa   "to rebel" 
  Joe-has-raised-the-head 
6b.  L'alzata di testa (di + che ha fatto) Joe 
  The-raising-of-the-head (of + that-has-made)-Joe 
7a.  Joe vende fumo    "to be a snake oil salesman" 
  Joe-sells-smoke 
7b.  Joe è un vendifumo 
  Joe-is-a-sell.smoke 

2.1 The Classes of Idioms with Ordinary Verbs 
Table 1 contains all the classes of idioms with ordinary verbs. The first column indicates the name of 
the Lexicon Grammar class, while the second column refers to the definitional structure of the idioms 
belonging to the corresponding class. The third column contains an idiomatic example for each class. 
Finally, the fourth column refers to the number of idioms listed in each class. The last class of Table 1, 
i.e. PVCO, contains those idioms where the fixed verb is followed by a comparative clause introduced 
by come2. 

The figures in the fourth column are to be taken as an approximate quantity, since this is an ongo-
ing research. Therefore, the classes are subject to updating. Although approximate, the figures are an 
important piece of information because they show the idioms' distribution throughout the syntactic 
patterns.

Table 1. Idioms with Ordinary Verbs 

3 The Lexicon-Grammar of the Italian Idiomatic Support Verb Constructions 
Idioms may be not only formed by an ordinary verb but also by support verbs, the most common of 
which are, in Italian, avere ('to have'), essere ('to be'), fare ('to make'). The main difference between 
support verbs (hereafter SV) and ordinary verbs constructions is linked to their meaning. That is, sup-
port verbs are semantically empty, while ordinary verbs are not. Therefore, support verbs are not pred-
icates. 

The idiomatic constructions formed by such verbs show a high degree of lexical and syntactic flex-
ibility due to the semantic "emptiness" of the support verb. Such a flexibility of SV idioms is shown 
by (a) the alternation of support verbs with aspectual variants, (b) the production of causative con-
structions, (c) the deletion of the support verb itself that can trigger the formation of complex nominal 
groups and adverbials. 

The Lexicon-Grammar of SV idioms (sec. 3.1, Table 2) includes 16 classes for a total of about 
3,300 entries. I will present one of the classes defined by the general structure N0 essere Prep C Ω, 
where it is the prepositional complement that is fixed and necessary to sub-categorize a possible fur-
ther argument Ω, as in the following3: 
 

8.  Nelly è al settimo cielo   "to be in seventh heaven" 
  Nelly-is-at-the-seventh-sky 
9.  Joe è ai ferri corti con Nelly "to be at loggerheads with sb." 
  Joe-is-at-the-short-irons-with-Nelly 

 
In example (8), the fixed prepositional complement PC does not require a further argument besides the 
subject, whereas a free prepositional complement PN is required in the case of (9). Therefore, idioms 
like (8) and (9) have been listed in two different classes, respectively, EPC and EPCPN, where E in-
dicates the verb essere ('to be'), P the preposition, C indicates the constrained noun, and N the free 
noun. Figure 2 is an excerpt of the class EPC which includes 500+ entries. 
                                                 

3 The Lexicon-grammar of the French être Prep constructions has been built by Danlos (1988). The Portuguese con-
structions were analyzed by Ranchod (1983). A first classification of the Italian essere Prep constructions has been built 
by Vietri (1996). This early classification has been completely revised.

Figure 2. The class EPC 

The distributional properties [1]-[4] have been previously illustrated (sec. 2, Figure 1). The properties 
from [5] to [8] indicate the possibility for the EPC constructions to occur with verbs other than essere. 
The verbs considered are stare4, in [5], restare and rimanere ('remain'), in [6], diventare ('become, 
get') in [7]. The property [8] indicates that a construction with the verb of motion andare ('to go') may 
be acceptable. 

However, the acceptability of all these constructions is lexically dependant, as in the following ex-
amples: 
 

10.  Nelly (sta+ resta + *diventa + va) al settimo cielo   "to be in seventh heaven" 
  Nelly-(stays + remains + *becomes + goes)-at-the-seventh-sky 
11.  Joe (*sta + resta + diventa + *va) in gamba  "to be smart" 
  Joe-(*stays + remains + becomes + *goes)-in-leg 

 
EPC constructions can also enter complex sentence structures with causative verbs (see properties [9]-
-[10]) such as mandare ('send'), mettere ('to put'), ridurre ('make'), as in the following: 
 
                                                 

4 I will literally translate this verb as "to stay". However, there is no equivalent in English since this verb is to be found 
in Romance languages like Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. 

142



12.  Joe (mandò + *mise + *ridusse) Nelly al settimo cielo "to be in seventh heaven" 
  Joe-(sent  + *put + *reduced)-Nelly-at-the-seventh-sky 
13.  Joe (mandò + mise + ridusse) Nelly sul lastrico  "to be on the skids" 
  Joe-(sent + put + reduced)-Nelly-on-the-pavement 

 
Finally, property [12] indicates that the link operator (see Gross 1981) avere ('to have') may produce 
an acceptable sentence, as in (14b): 
 

14a. La situazione in Ukraina è sott'occhio   "to monitor N" 
  The-situation-in-Ukraine-is-under-eye 
14b. Obama ha sott'occhio la situazione in Ukraina 
  Obama-has-under-eye-the-situation-in-Ukraine 

3.1 The Classes of Idioms with Support Verbs 
Table 2 lists only those classes of SV idioms containing at least 50 idiomatic entries5. As a general 
rule, the classes of idioms with the verb essere start with E, those ones with the verb avere start 
with A, and finally, those classes involving the verb fare start with F. The only exception is the 
class PECO which refers to the idioms of comparison where the verb essere is followed by a 
clause introduced by come6.

4 Annotating and Parsing Idioms 
The Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms can be exploited by the hybrid as well as the symbolic ap-
proach to Natural Language Processing. Some experimentation in this direction has already been car-
ried out by Machonis (2011), who used NooJ to retrieve and disambiguate English phrasal verbs. NooJ 
is an NLP application developed by Silberztein (2003) that relies heavily on linguistic resources.  

NooJ has been used to carry out experimentation on some of the Lexicon-Grammar classes of Ital-
ian idioms. The experimentation, still in progress, concerns the annotation and parsing of idioms. This 
application allows the construction of lexicons/dictionaries whose entries contain information such as 
the distributional and syntactic properties indicated in the Lexicon-Grammar classes. The Lexicon-
Grammar classes of idioms can be converted in a NooJ dictionary of idioms. This dictionary, which 
contains thousands of entries, has to be linked to a grammar that describes the syntactic behaviour of 
idioms. By applying to a text such a dictionary/grammar pair, NooJ successfully annotates and parses 
idioms, also in case the constituents Verb + Fixed element(s) are discontinuous. An example of this is 
the sentence John ha vuotato subito il sacco (lit. John-has-immediately-emptied-the bag, "to spill the 
beans"), where the underlined adverb occurs between the verb and the fixed object. 

However, the current NooJ version does not yet handle easily the syntactic flexibility and the lexi-
cal variation of idioms 7. 

5 Conclusion 
The Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms are a manually-built linguistic resource that provides infor-
mation about variation and flexibility of idioms. These classes, being formally coded, constitute an 
invaluable linguistic resource that can be used for research in (psycho)linguistics, and computational 
linguistics. The overall classification, as illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, outlines the syntactic patterns of 
the idiomatic constructions. This is a piece of information that can be regarded as the syntactic map of 
Italian idioms8. Furthermore, the lexico-syntactic information provided by the idioms' classes can also 
integrate the automatic Machine Translation evaluation methods9. 

The Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms can be exploited by the hybrid as well as the symbolic ap-
proach to Natural Language Processing. Some experimentation in this direction has already been car-
ried out by Machonis (2011) and by Vietri (2014, forthcoming). Both authors used the knowledge-
based system NooJ. On the other hand, Baptista et al. (2014) used the Lexicon-Grammar classes of 
Portuguese idioms to test the hybrid system STRING. 

Further experimentation will be conducted to evaluate the benefit of using the LG distributional 
and syntactic information in order to extract idioms from corpora. However, very huge corpora (con-
sisting of documents in an informal language style) are needed, together with powerful tools able to 
perform complex searches on massive textual data.
