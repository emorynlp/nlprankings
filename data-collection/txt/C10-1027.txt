Abstract

We present a framework where auxiliary
MT systems are used to provide lexical
predictions to a main SMT system.
In
this work, predictions are obtained by
means of pivoting via auxiliary languages,
and introduced into the main SMT sys-
tem in the form of a low order language
model, which is estimated on a sentence-
by-sentence basis. The linear combination
of models implemented by the decoder
is thus extended with this additional lan-
guage model. Experiments are carried out
over three different translation tasks using
the European Parliament corpus. For each
task, nine additional languages are used
as auxiliary languages to obtain the trian-
gulated predictions. Translation accuracy
results show that improvements in trans-
lation quality are obtained, even for large
data conditions.

Introduction

Important improvements are yet to come regard-
ing the performance of Statistical Machine Trans-
lation systems. Dependence on training data and
limited modelling expressiveness are the focus of
many research efforts, such as using monolingual
corpora for the former and syntactic models for
the latter.

Another promising approach consists in ex-
ploiting complementary sources of information
in order to build better translations, as done by
consensus-based system combination (e.g. (Ma-
tusov et al., 2008)). This, however, requires to

have several systems available for the same lan-
guage pair. Considering that the same training
data would be available to all systems, differences
in translation modelling are expected to produce
redundant and complementary hypotheses. Mul-
tisource translation (e.g.
(Och and Ney, 2001;
Schwartz, 2008)) is a variant, involving source
texts available in several languages which can be
translated by systems for different language pairs
and whose outputs can be successfully combined
into better translations (Schroeder et al., 2009).
One theoretical expectation of multisource trans-
lation is that it can successfully reduce ambiguity
of the original source text, but does so under the
rare conditions of availability of existing (accu-
rate) translations. In contrast, pivot-based system
combination (e.g.
(Utiyama and Isahara, 2007;
Wu and Wang, 2007)) aims at compensating the
lack of training data for a given language pair by
producing translation hypotheses obtained by piv-
oting via an intermediary language for which bet-
ter systems are available.

These techniques generally produce a search
space that differs from that of the direct transla-
tion systems. As such, they create a new transla-
tion system out of various systems for which di-
agnosis becomes more difﬁcult.

This paper instead focusses on improving a sin-
gle system, which should be state-of-the-art as
regards data and models. We propose a frame-
work in which information coming from external
sources is used to boost lexical choices and guide
the decoder into making more informed choices.1

1We performed initial experiments where the comple-
mentary information was exploited during n-best list rerank-
ing (Max et al., 2010), but except for the multisource condi-
tion the list of hypotheses contained too little useful variation

233

Complementary sources can be of different na-
ture:
they can involve other automatic systems
(for the same or different language pairs) and/or
human knowledge. Furthermore, complementary
information is injected at the lexical level, thus
making targeted ﬁne-grained lexical predictions
useful.
those predictions are ex-
ploited at the sentence level2, so as to allow for
efﬁcient use of source contextual information.

Importantly,

The second contribution of this paper is an in-
stantiation of the proposed framework. Auto-
matically pivoting via auxiliary languages is used
to make complementary predictions that are ex-
ploited through language model adaptation by the
decoder for a given language pair. For this appar-
ently difﬁcult condition, where predictions result
from automatic translations involving two sys-
tems, we manage to report signiﬁcant improve-
ments, measured with respect to the target and the
source text, under various conﬁgurations.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst re-
view related work in section 2.1, and describe the
distinctive characteristics of our approach in Sec-
tion 2.2. Section 2.3 presents our instantiation of
the framework based on lexical boosting via aux-
iliary language triangulation. Experiments involv-
ing three language pairs of various complexity and
different amounts of training data are described in
Section 3. We ﬁnally conclude by discussing the
prospects offered by our proposed framework in
Section 4.

boosting

2.1 Related work
The idea of using more than one translation sys-
tem to improve translation performance is not new
and has been implemented in many different ways
which we brieﬂy review here.

System combination An often used strategy
consists in combining the output of several sys-
tems for a ﬁxed language pair, and to rescore the
resulting set of hypotheses taking into account
all the available translations and scores. Various
to lead to measurable improvements.

2We plan to experiment next on using predictions at the

document level.

proposals have been made to efﬁciently perform
such a combination, using auxiliary data struc-
tures such as n-best lists, word lattices or con-
sensus networks (see for instance (Kumar and
Byrne, 2004; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al.,
2008; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008; Tromble et al.,
2008)). Theses techniques have proven extremely
effective and have allowed to deliver very signiﬁ-
cant gains in several recent evaluation campaigns
(Callison-Burch et al., 2008).

Multisource translation A related, yet more re-
sourceful approach, consists in trying to combine
several systems providing translations from differ-
ent sources into the same target, provided such
multilingual sources are available. (Och and Ney,
2001) propose to select the most promising trans-
lation amongst the hypotheses produced by sev-
eral Foreign→English systems, where output se-
lection is based on the translation scores. The
intuition that if a system assigns a high ﬁgure
of merits to the translation of a particular sen-
tence, then this translation should be preferred,
is implemented in the MAX combination heuris-
tics, whose relative (lack of) success is discussed
in (Schwartz, 2008). A similar idea is explored in
(Nomoto, 2004), where the sole target language
model score is used to rank competing outputs.
(Schroeder et al., 2009) propose to combine the
available sources prior to translation, under the
form of a multilingual lattice, which is decoded
with a multisource phrase table.
(Chen et al.,
2008) integrate the available auxiliary information
in a different manner, and discuss how to improve
the translation model of the primary system: the
idea is to use the entries in the phrase table of
the auxiliary system to ﬁlter out those acciden-
tal correspondences that pollute the main transla-
tion model. The most effective implementation of
multisource translation to date however consists
in using mono-source system combination tech-
niques (Schroeder et al., 2009).

Translation through pivoting The use of aux-
iliary systems has also been proposed in another
common situation, as a possible remedy to the
lack of parallel data for a particular language pair,
or for a particular domain. Assume, for instance,
that one wishes to build a translation system for

234

the pair A → B, for which the parallel data
is sparse; assuming further that such parallel re-
sources exist for pairs A → C and for C → B,
it is then tempting to perform the translation in-
directly through pivoting, by ﬁrst translating from
A to C, then from C to B. Direct implementa-
tions of this idea are discussed e.g. in (Utiyama
and Isahara, 2007). Pivoting can also intervene
earlier in the process, for instance as a means
to automatically generate the missing parallel re-
source, an idea that has also been considered to
adapt an existing translation systems to new do-
mains (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009). Pivoting can
ﬁnally be used to ﬁx or improve the translation
model: (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) augments the
phrase table for a baseline bilingual system with
supplementary phrases obtained by pivoting into
a third language.

Triangulation in translation Triangulation
techniques are somewhat more general and only
require the availabily of one auxiliary system (or
one auxiliary parallel corpus). For instance, the
authors of (Chen et al., 2008) propose to use the
translation model of an auxiliary C → B system
to ﬁlter-out the phrase-table of a primary A → B
system.

2.2 Our framework
As in other works, we propose to make use of sev-
eral MT systems (of any type) to improve trans-
lation performance, but contrarily to these works
we concentrate on improving one particular sys-
tem. Our framework is illustrated on Figure 1.
The main system (henceforth, direct system), cor-
responding to conﬁguration 1, is a SMT system,
translating from German to English in the exam-
ple. Auxiliary information may originate from
various sources (2-6) and enter into the decoder.
A new model is dynamically built and is used to
guide the exploration of the search space to the
best hypothesis. Several auxiliary models can be
used at once and can be weighted by standard op-
timization techniques using development data, so
that bad sources are not used in practice, or by
exploiting a priori information. In the implemen-
tation described in section 2.3, this information is
updated by the auxiliary source at each sentence.

Figure 1: Lexical boosting framework with vari-
ous conﬁgurations for auxiliary predictions

We now brieﬂy describe various possible con-
ﬁgurations to make some links to previous works
explicit. Conﬁguration 2 translates the same
source text by means of another system for the
same language pair, as would be done in system
combination, except that here a new complete de-
coding is performed by the direct system. Con-
ﬁguration 3, which will be detailed in section 2.3,
uses translations obtained by triangulating via an
auxiliary language (Spanish in the example). Us-
ing this two-step translation is common to pivot
approaches, but our approach is different in that
the result of the triangulation is only used as aux-
iliary information for the decoding of the direct
system. Conﬁgurations 4 and 5 are instances of
multisource translation, where a paraphrase or a
translation of the source text is available. Lastly,
conﬁguration 6 illustrates the case where a human
translator, with knowledge of the target language
and at least of one of the available source lan-
guages, could inﬂuence the decoding by provid-
ing desired3 words (e.g. only for source words or
phrases that would be judged difﬁcult to translate).
This human supervision through a feedback text in
real time is similar to the proposal of (Dymetman
et al., 2003).

Given this framework, several questions arise,

3The proposal as it is limits the hypotheses produced by
the system to those that are attainable given its training data.
It is conceivable, however, to ﬁnd ways of introducing new
knowledge in this framework.

235

the most important underlying this work being
whether the performance of SMT systems can be
improved by using other SMT systems. Another
point of interest is whether improvements made
to auxiliary systems can yield improvement to the
direct system, without the latter undergoing any
modiﬁcation.

2.3 Lexical boosting via triangulation
Auxiliary translations obtained by pivoting can be
viewed as a source of adaptation data for the target
language model of the direct system. Assuming
we have computed n-best translation hypotheses
of a sentence in the target language, we can then
boost the likeliness of the words and phrases oc-
curring in these hypotheses by deriving an auxil-
iary language model for each test sentence. This
allows us to integrate this auxiliary information
during the search and thus provides a tighter in-
tegration with the direct system. This idea has
successfully been used in speech recognition, us-
ing for instance close captions (Placeway and Laf-
ferty, 1996) or an imperfect translation (Paulik et
al., 2005) to provide auxiliary in-domain adap-
tation data for the recognizer’s language model.
(Simard and Isabelle, 2009) proposed a similar ap-
proach in Machine Translation in which they use
the target-side of an exact match in a translation
memory to build language models on a per sen-
tence basis used in their decoder.

This strategy can be implemented in a straight-
forward manner, by simply training a language
model using the n-best list as an adaptation cor-
pus. Being automatically generated, hypotheses
in the n-best list are not entirely reliable: in par-
ticular, they may contain very unlikely target se-
quences at the junction of two segments. It is how-
ever straightforward to ﬁlter these out using the
available phrase alignment information.

This conﬁguration is illustrated on Figure 2: the
direct system (conﬁguration 1) makes use of pre-
dictions from pivoting through an auxiliary lan-
guage (conﬁguration 2), where n-best lists can be
used to produce several hypotheses. In order to
get a upper bound on the potential gains of this ap-
proach, we can run the artiﬁcial experiment (con-
ﬁguration 3) where a reference in the target lan-
guage is used as a “perfect” source of information.

Furthermore, we are interested in the performance
of the simple pivot system alone (conﬁguration 4),
as it gives an indication of the quality of the data
used for LM adaptation.

3 Experiments and results
3.1 Translation engine
In this study, we used our own machine trans-
lation engine, which implements the n-gram-
based approach to statistical machine translation
(Mariño et al., 2006). The translation model
is implemented as a stochastic ﬁnite-state trans-
ducer trained using a n-gram language model of
(source,target) pairs.

In addition to a bilingual n-gram model, our
SMT system uses six additional models which
are linearly combined following a discriminative
modeling framework:
two lexicalized reorder-
ing (Tillmann, 2004) models,a target-language
model, two lexicon models, a ’weak’ distance-
based distortion model, a word bonus model and
a translation unit bonus model. Coefﬁcients in
this linear combination are tuned over develop-
ment data with the MERT optimization toolkit4,
slightly modiﬁed to use our decoder’s n-best lists.
For this study, we used 3-gram bilingual and
3-gram target language models built using modi-
ﬁed Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman,
1996); model estimation was performed with the
SRI language modeling toolkit.5 Target language

models were trained on the target side of the bi-
text corpora.

After preprocessing the corpora with standard
tokenization tools, word-to-word alignments are
performed in both directions, source-to-target and
target-to-source.
In our system implementation,
the GIZA++ toolkit6 is used to compute the word
alignments. Then, the grow-diag-ﬁnal-and heuris-
tic is used to obtain the ﬁnal alignments from
which translation units are extracted. Convergent
studies have showed that systems built accord-
ing to these principles typically achieve a per-
formance comparable to that of the widely used
MOSES phrase-based system for the language
pairs under study.

3.2 Corpora
We have used the Europarl corpus7 for our main
and auxiliary languages. The eleven languages
are: Danish (da), German (de), English (en),
Spanish (es), Finnish (ﬁ), French (fr), Greek
(el), Italian (it), Dutch (nl), Portuguese (pt) and
Swedish (sv).

We focussed on three translation tasks: one
for which translation accuracy, as measured by
automatic metrics, is rather high (f r → en),
and two for which translation accuracy is lower
(de → en) and (f r → de). This will allow us
to check whether the improvements provided by
our method carry over even in situations where the
baseline is strong; conversely, it will allow us to
assess whether the proposed techniques are appli-
cable when the baseline is average or poor.

In order to measure the contribution of each of
the auxiliary languages we used a subset of the
training corpus that is common to all language
pairs, hereinafter referred to as the intersection
data condition. We used the English side of all
training language pairs to collect the same sen-
tences in all languages, summing up to 320, 304
sentence pairs. Some statistics on the data used in
this study are reported in Table 1. Finally, in order
to assess the impact of the training data size over
the results obtained, we also considered a much
more challenging condition for the f r → de pair,
where we used the entire Europarl data (V5) made

6http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html
7http://www.statmt.org/europarl

available for the ﬁfth Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation8 for training, and test our sys-
tem on out-of-domain news data. The training
corpus in this condition contains 43.6M French
words and 37.2M German words.

Development and test data for the ﬁrst con-
dition (intersection) were obtained by leaving
out respectively 500 and 1000 sentences from
the common subset (same sentences for all lan-
guages), while the ﬁrst 500 sentences of news-
test2008 and the entire newstest2009 ofﬁcial test
sets were used for the full data condition.

For each triplet of languages (src, aux, trg),
columns 4th to 6th show BLEU scores for systems
performing (src → aux), (aux → trg) and pivot
translations using aux as the bridge language.

the same system augmented with the additional
language model. Additional language models are
built from hypotheses obtained by means of pivot
translations, using aux as auxiliary language. The
last score is shown in the form of the difference
(improvement) with respect to the score of the

This table additionally displays the BLEU re-
sults obtained when building the additional lan-
guage models directly from the English reference

the additional

As detailed above,

language
models are built using trg hypotheses obtained by
pivoting via an auxiliary language: (src → aux)
+ (aux → trg). Hence, column pivot shows the
quality (measured in terms of BLEU) of the hy-
potheses used to estimate the additional model.
Note that we did not limit the language model to
be estimated from the 1-best pivot hypotheses. In-
stead, we uses n-best translation hypotheses of the
(src → aux) system and m-best hypotheses of
the (aux → trg) system. Hence, n × m target
hypotheses were used as training data to estimate
the additional models. Column +auxLM shows
BLEU scores over the test set after performing
four system optimizations on the development set
to select the best combination of values used for n
and m among: (1, 1), (10, 1), (10, 1) and (10, 10).
All hypotheses used to estimate a language model
are considered equally likely. Language models
are learnt using Witten-Bell discounting. Approx-
imately ±1.0 point must be added to BLEU scores
shown in the last 2 columns for 95% conﬁdence
levels.

As expected, pivot

translations yield lower
quality scores than the corresponding direct trans-
lations hypotheses. However, pivot hypotheses
may contain better lexical predictions, that the ad-
ditional model helps transfer into the baseline sys-
tem, yielding translations with a higher quality, as
shown in many cases the +auxLM systems results.
The case of using Finnish as an auxiliary language
is particularly remarkable. Even though pivot hy-
potheses obtained through Finnish have the low-
est scores9, they help improve the baseline perfor-
mance as additional language models.

As expected, the translation results of the pair
9Given the agglutinative nature of morphological pro-
cesses in Finnish, reﬂected in a much lower number of words
per sentence, and a higher number of types (see Table 1),
BLEU scores for this language do not compare directly with
the ones obtained for other languages.

238

with a highest baseline (f r → en) were on av-
erage less improved than those of the pairs with
lower baselines.

As can also be seen, the contribution of each
auxiliary language varies for each of the three
translation tasks. For instance, Danish (da) pro-
vides a clear improvement to (de → en) transla-
tions, while no gain is observed for (f r → en).
No clear patterns seems to emerge, though, and
the correlation between the quality of the pivot
translation and the boost provided by using these
pivot hypotheses remains to be better analyzed.

In order to assess whether the improvements
obtained carry over larger data conditions, we
trained our (f r → de), (f r → es) and (es → de)
systems over the entire EPPS data. Results are re-
ported in the bottom part of Table 2. As can be
seen, the (f r → de) system is still improved by
using the additional language model. However,
the absolute value of the gain under the full condi-
tion (+0.61) is lower than that of the intersection
data condition (+0.96).

3.4 Contrastive evaluation of lexical

translation

In some cases, automatic metrics such as BLEU
cannot show signiﬁcant differences that can be re-
vealed by ﬁne-grained focussed human evaluation
(e.g. (Vilar et al., 2006)). Furthermore, comput-
ing some similarity between a system’s hypothe-
ses and gold standard references puts a strong
focus on the target side of translation, and does
not allow evaluating translation performance from
the source words that were actually translated.
We therefore use the evaluation methodology de-
scribed in (Max et al., 2010) for a complementary
measure of translation performance that focuses
on the contrastive ability of two systems to ade-
quately translate source words.

Source words from the test corpus were ﬁrst
aligned with target words in the reference, by au-
tomatically aligning the union of the training and
test corpus using GIZA++.10 The test corpus was
analyzed by the TREETAGGER11 so as to identify

10The obtained alignments are thus strongly inﬂuenced by
alignments from the training corpus. It could be noted that
alignments could be manually corrected.

Table 3:
Contrastive lexical evaluation re-
sults per part-of-speech between the baseline
French→English system and our systems using
various auxiliary languages.
’+’) val-
ues indicate numbers of words that only the base-
line system (resp. our system) correctly translated
with respect to the reference translation.

’-’ (resp.

content words, which have a more direct impact
on translation adequacy. When source words are
aligned to several target words, each target word
should be individually searched for in the candi-
date translation, and words from the reference can
only be matched once.

Table 3 shows contrastive results per part-of-
speech between the baseline fr→en system and
systems using various auxiliary languages. Val-
ues in the ’-’ row indicate the number of words
that only the baseline system translated as in the
reference translation, and values in the ’+’ row
the number of words that only our corresponding
system translated as in the reference. The most
striking result is the contribution of Greek, which,
while giving no gain in terms of BLEU, improved
the translation of 82 content words. This could
be explained, in addition to the lower Bleu3 and
Bleu4 precision, by the fact that the quality of
the translation of grammatical words may have
decreased. On the contrary, Italian brings little
improvement for content words save for nouns.
The mostly negative results on the translation of
pronouns were expected, because this depends on
their antecedent in English and is not the object of
speciﬁc modelling from the systems. The trans-
lation of nouns and adjectives beneﬁts the most
from auxiliary translations.

Figure 3 illustrates this evaluation by means of
two examples. It should be noted that a recurrent
type of improvement was that of avoiding missing
words, which is here a direct result of their being
boosted in the auxiliary hypotheses.

4 Conclusions and future work

We have presented a framework where auxiliary
MT systems are used to provide useful informa-
tion to a main SMT system. Our experiments
on auxiliary language triangulation have demon-
strated its validity on a difﬁcult conﬁguration and
have shown that improvements in translation qual-
ity could be obtained even under large training
data conditions.

The fact that low quality sources such as pivot
translation can provide useful complementary in-
formation calls for a better understanding of the
phenomena at play.
It is very likely that, look-
ing at our results on the contribution of auxiliary
languages, improving the quality of an auxiliary
source can also be achieved by identifying what
a source is good for. For example, in the stud-
ied language conﬁgurations predictions of transla-
tions for pronouns in the source text by auxiliary
triangulation does not give access to useful infor-
mation. On the contrary, triangulation with Greek
when translating from French to English seems to
give useful information regarding the translation
of adjectives, a result which was quite unexpected.
Also, it would be interesting to use richer pre-
dictions than short n-grams, such as syntactic
dependencies, but this would require signiﬁcant
changes on the decoders used. Using dynamic
models at the discourse level rather than only at
the sentence level would also be a useful improve-
ment. Besides the improvements just mentioned,
our future work includes working on several con-
ﬁgurations of the framework described in sec-
tion 2.2, in particular investigating the new type
of system combination.
