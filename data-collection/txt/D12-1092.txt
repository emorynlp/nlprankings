Abstract 

Current Chinese event extraction systems suffer 

much from two problems in trigger 

identification: unknown triggers and word 

segmentation errors to known triggers. To 

resolve these problems, this paper proposes two 

novel inference mechanisms to explore special 

characteristics in Chinese via compositional 

semantics inside Chinese triggers and discourse 

consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. 

Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus 

justifies the effectiveness of our approach over 

a strong baseline. 

1 Introduction 

Event extraction, a classic information extraction 

task, is to identify instances of a predefined event 

type and can be typically divided into four subtasks: 

trigger identification, trigger type determination, 

argument identification and argument role 

determination. In the literature, most studies focus 

on English event extraction and have achieved 

certain success (e.g. Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 

2006; Hardy et al., 2006; Maslennikov and Chua, 

2007; Finkel et al., 2005; Ji and Grishman, 2008; 

Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009, 2011; Liao and 

Grishman 2010; Hong et al., 2011).  

In comparison, there are few successful stories 

regarding Chinese event extraction due to special 

characteristics in Chinese trigger identification. In 

particular, there are two major reasons for the low 

performance: unknown triggers

 and word 

segmentation errors to known triggers. Table 1 

gives the statistics of unknown triggers and word 

segmentation errors to known triggers in both the

data is called a known trigger and otherwise, an unknown 

trigger.

 using 10-

fold cross-validation. In each validation, we leave 

10% trigger mentions as the test set and the 

remaining ones as the training set. If a mention in 

the test set doesn’t occurred in the training set, we 

regard it as an unknown trigger. It shows that these 

two cases cover almost 30% of Chinese trigger 

mentions while this figure reduces to only about 

9% in English. It also shows that given the same 

number of event mentions, there are 30% more 

different triggers in Chinese than that in English. 

This justifies the low performance (specifically, 

the recall) of a Chinese event extraction system, 

which normally extracts those known triggers 

occurring in the training data as candidate 

instances and uses a classifier to distinguish correct 

triggers from wrong ones.

Note that word segmentation only applies to Chinese. 

 

In this paper, we propose two novel inference 

mechanisms to Chinese trigger identification by 

employing compositional semantics inside Chinese 

triggers and discourse consistency between 

Chinese trigger mentions.  

The first mechanism is motivated by the 

compositional nature of Chinese words, whose 

semantics can be often determined by the 

component characters. Hence, it is natural to infer

mentions. For the sake of fair comparison, we choose the same 

number of event mentions from the English corpus as the 

cross-validation data.

unknown triggers by employing compositional 

semantics inside Chinese triggers.  

The second mechanism is enlightened by the 

wide use of discourse consistency in natural 

languages, particularly for Chinese, due to its 

discourse-driven nature (Zhu, 1980). Very often, 

distinguishing true trigger mentions from pseudo 

ones is only possible with contextual information.  

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 

Section 2 overviews the related work. Section 3 

introduces a state-of-the-art baseline system for 

Chinese event extraction. Sections 4 and 5 describe 

two novel inference mechanisms to Chinese trigger 

identification by employing compositional 

semantics inside Chinese triggers and discourse 

consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. 

Section 6 presents the experimental results. Section 

7 concludes the paper and points out future work. 

2 Related Work 

Almost all the existing studies on event extraction 

concern English. While earlier studies focus on 

sentence-level extraction (Grishman et al., 2005; 

Ahn, 2006; Hardy et al., 2006), later ones turn to 

employ high-level information, such as document 

(Maslennikov and Chua, 2007; Finkel et al., 2005; 

Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009), cross-document (Ji 

and Grishman, 2008), cross-event (Liao and 

Grishman, 2010; Gupta and Ji, 2009) and cross-

entity (Hong et al., 2011) information. 

2.1 Chinese Event Extraction  

Compared with tremendous efforts in English 

event extraction, there are only a few studies on 

Chinese event extraction.  

Tan et al. (2008) modeled event extraction as a 

pipeline of classification tasks. Specially, they used 

a local feature selection approach to ensure the 

performance of trigger classification (trigger 

identification + trigger type determination) and 

applied multiple levels of patterns to improve the 

coverage of patterns in argument classification 

(argument identification + argument role 

determination). Chen and Ji (2009a) proposed a 

bootstrapping framework, which exploited extra 

information captured by an English event 

extraction system. Chen and Ji (2009b) applied 

various kinds of lexical, syntactic and semantic 

features to address the specific issues in Chinese. 

They also constructed a global errata table to 

record the inconsistency in the training set and 

used it to correct the inconsistency in the test set. Ji 

(2009) extracted cross-lingual predicate clusters 

using bilingual parallel corpora and a cross-lingual 

information extraction system, and then used the 

derived clusters to improve the performance of 

Chinese event extraction. 

2.2 Compositional Semantics 

Almost all the related studies on compositional 

semantics focus on how to combine words together 

to convey complex meanings, such as semantic 

parser (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and 

Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2011). However, the 

compositional semantics mentioned in this paper is 

more fined-grained and focuses on how to 

construct Chinese characters into a word and mine 

the semantics of words from the word structures, 

especially of verbs as event triggers.  

To our knowledge, there is only one paper 

associated with compositional semantics inside 

Chinese words. Li (2011) discussed the internal 

structures inside Chinese nouns and used it in word 

segmentation.  

2.3 Discourse Consistency 

Discourse consistency is an important hypothesis 

in natural languages and has been applied to many 

natural language processing applications, such as 

named entity recognition and coreference 

resolution. Specially, several studies have 

successfully incorporated trigger or entity 

consistency constraint into event extraction.  

Yarowsky (1995) and Yangarber et al. 

(Yangarber and Jokipii, 2005; Yangarber et al., 

2007) applied cross-document inference to refine 

local extraction results for disease name, location 

and start/end time. Mann (2007) proposed some 

specific inference rules to improve extraction of 

personal information. Ji and Grishman (2008) 

employed a rule-based approach to propagate 

consistent triggers and arguments across topic-

related documents. Gupta and Ji (2009) used a 

similar approach to recover implicit time 

information for events. Liao and Grishman (2011) 

also used a similar approach and a self-training 

strategy to extract events. Liao and Grishman 

(2010) employed cross-event consistency 

information to improve sentence-level event 

extraction. Hong et al. (2011) regarded entity type 

1007



consistency as a key feature to predict event 

mentions and adopted this inference method to 

improve the traditional event extraction system.  

3 Baseline 

As a baseline, we re-implement a state-of-the-art 

system, which consists of four typical components 

(trigger identification, trigger type determination, 

argument identification and argument role 

determination), in a pipeline way and employ the 

same set of features as described in Chen and Ji 

(2009b). 

Besides, the Maximum-Entropy (ME) model is 

employed to train individual component classifiers 

for the above four components. During testing, 

each word in the test set is first scanned for 

instances of known triggers from the training set. 

When an instance is found, the trigger identifier is 

applied to distinguish true trigger mentions from 

pseudo ones. If true, the trigger type determiner is 

then applied to recognize its event type. For any 

entity mentions in the sentence, the argument 

identifier is employed to assign possible arguments 

to them afterwards. Finally, the argument role 

determiner is introduced to assign a role to each 

argument.  

One problem with Chen and Ji’s system is its 

ignoring effective long-distance features. In order 

to resolve this problem and provide a stronger 

baseline, we introduce more refined and 

dependency features in four components:  

 Trigger Identification and Trigger Type 
Determination: 1) syntactic features: path to 

the root of the governing clause, 2) nearest 

entity information: entity type of left 

syntactically/physically nearest entity to the 

trigger + entity, entity type of right 

syntactically/physically nearest entity to the 

trigger mention in the sentence + entity; 3) 

dependency features: the subject and the object 

of the trigger when they are entities. 

 Argument Identification and Argument Role 
Determination: 1) basic features: POS of 

trigger; 2) neighboring words: left neighboring 

word of the entity + its POS, right neighbor 

word of the entity + its POS, left neighbor word 

of the trigger + its POS, right neighbor word of 

the trigger + its POS; 3) dependency feature: 

dependency path from the entity to the trigger; 

4) semantic role features: Arg0 and Arg1 which 

tagged by semantic role labeling tool (Li, et al., 

2010). 

3.1 Experimental Setting 

The ACE 2005 Chinese corpus (only the training 

data is available) is used in all our experiments. 

The corpus contains 633 Chinese documents 

annotated with 8 predefined event types and 33 

predefined subtypes. Similar to previous studies, 

we treat these subtypes simply as 33 separate event 

types and do not consider the hierarchical structure 

among them. 

Following Chen and Ji (2009b), we randomly 

select 567 documents as the training set and the 

remaining 66 documents as the test set. Besides, 

we reserve 33 documents in the training set as the 

development set, and follow the setting of ACE 

diagnostic tasks and use the ground truth entities, 

times and values for our training and testing. 

For evaluation, we follow the standards as 

defined in Ji (2009):  

 A trigger is correctly identified if its position in 
the document matches a reference trigger; 

 A trigger type is correctly determined if its 
event type and position in the document match 

a reference trigger; 

 An argument is correctly identified if its 
involved event type and position in the 

document match any of the reference argument 

mentions; 

 An argument role is correctly determined if its 
involved event type, position in the document, 

and role match any of the reference argument 

mentions. 

Finally, all sentences in the corpus are divided 

into words using a word segmentation tool 

ICTCLAS

 with all entities annotated in the corpus 

kept. Besides, we use Stanford Parser (Levy and 

Manning, 2003, Chang, et al., 2009) to create the 

constituent and dependency parse trees and employ 

the ME model to train individual component 

classifiers. 

3.2 Experimental Results 

Table 2 and 3 show the Precision (P), Recall (R) 

and F1-Measure (F) on the held-out test set. It 

shows that our baseline system outperforms Chen 

and Ji (2009b) by 1.8, 2.2, 3.9 and 2.3 in F1-

measure on trigger identification, trigger type

determination, argument identification and 

argument role determination, respectively, with 

both gains in precision and recall. This is simply 

due to contribution of the newly-added refined and 

dependency features.

For our baseline system, given the small 

performance gaps between trigger identification 

and trigger type determination (3.7 in F1-measure: 

61.5 vs. 57.8) and between argument identification 

and argument role determination (3.9 in F1-

measure: 49.3 vs. 45.4), the performance 

bottlenecks of our baseline system mainly exist in 

trigger identification and argument identification, 

particularly for the former one. While argument 

identification has the performance gap of 8.5 in 

F1-measure compared to trigger type 

determination (49.3 vs. 57.8), the former one, 

trigger identification, can only achieve the 

performance of 61.5 in F1-measure (in particular 

the recall with only 52.0). In this paper, we will 

focus on trigger identification to improve its 

performance, particularly for the recall, via 

compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers 

and discourse consistency between Chinese trigger 

mentions.  

4 Employing Compositional Semantics 
inside Chinese Triggers  

Language is perhaps the only communicative 

system in nature, which compositionally builds 

structured meanings from smaller pieces, and this 

compositionality is the cognitive mechanism that 

allows for what Humboldt called language’s 

“infinite use of finite means.” As usual, the lexical 

semantics is the smallest piece in most Chinese 

language processing applications. In this section, 

we introduce a more fine-grained semantics - the 

compositional semantics in Chinese verb structure 

- and unveil its effect and usage in Chinese 

language processing by employing it into Chinese 

event extraction. 

4.1 Compositional Semantics inside Chinese 
Triggers 

In English, a component character is just the basic 

unit to form a word instead of a semantics unit. In 

comparison, almost all Chinese characters have 

their own meanings and can be formed as SCWs 

(Single Character Words) themselves. If a Chinese 

word contains more than one character, its 

meaning can be often inferred from the meanings 

of its component characters (Yuan, 1998). Actually, 

it is the normal way of understanding a new 

Chinese word in everyday life of a Chinese native 

speaker. A general method to this problem is to 

systematically explore the morphological 

structures in Chinese words. In this paper, 

compositional semantics provides a simple but 

effective compromise to the general method and 

we leave the general method in the future work. 

Table 4 shows samples of such compositional 

semantics in Chinese words. For example, “会见” 

is composed of two characters: “会” and “见” 
which have their own semantics and the semantics 

of “ 会见 ” comes from that of its component 

characters “会” and “见”.  
 

Words Characters 

会见 (interview4) 会 (meet) 见(meet) 

击毙 (shoot and kill) 击(shoot) 毙 (kill) 

来到(come)  

私信 (private letter) 

来 (come) 到 (to) 

私(private) 信(letter) 
Table 4. Examples of compositional semantics in 

Chinese words 

 

Therefore, it is natural to infer unknown triggers 

by employing compositional semantics inside 

Chinese triggers. Take following two sentences as 

examples: 

(1) 4 名学生被玻璃划伤。(Known trigger) 
                                                           
4  Most Chinese words have more than one sense. Here, we 

just give the one when it acts as a trigger. 

1009



(Four students were scratched by the glass.) 

(2)  1 名乘客被刺伤。(Unknown trigger) 
(A passenger was stabbed.) 

where “划伤” is a known trigger and “刺伤” is an 
unknown one.  

In above examples, the semantics of “划伤” 
(injure by scratching) can be largely determined 

from those of its component characters “ 划 ” 

(scratch) and “伤” (injure) while the semantics of 

“刺伤 ” (injure by stabbing) from those of its 

component characters “刺” (stab) and “伤” (injure). 
Since these two triggers have similar internal 

structures, we can easily infer that “刺伤” is a 

trigger of injure event if “划伤” is known as a 
trigger of injure event. Similarly, we can infer 

more triggers for injure event, such as “灼伤” 

(injure by burning), “撞伤” (injure by hitting), “压

伤 ” (injure by pressing), all with component 

character “伤” (injure) as the head and the other 
component character as the way of causing injury.  

Since most triggers in Chinese event extraction 

are verbs
5

, we focus on the compositional 

semantics in the verb structure. Statistics on the 

training set shows that 3.3% triggers (e.g. “公开

信” (open letter), “事件” (event), “病情” (patient's 
condition), etc.) don’t contain a BV and all of them 

are nouns. Normally, almost all verbs contain one 

or more single-character verbs as the basic element 

to construct a verb (we call it basic verb, shorted as 

BV) and the semantics of such a verb thus can be 

inferred from its BV. There are some studies on the 

Chinese verb structure in linguistics. However, 

their structures are much more complex and there 

are no annotated corpora available. We define 

following six main structures from our empirical 

observations: 

(1) BV (e.g. “看” (see), “杀” (kill)) 

(2) BV + verb (e.g. “会见” (meet)) 

(3) verb + BV (e.g. “解雇” (fire) ) 

(4) BV + complementation (e.g. “杀了” (kill) ) 

(5) BV + noun/adj. (e.g. “回家” (go to home)) 

(6) noun/adj. +BV (e.g. “枪击” (shoot using 
gun)). 

                                                           
5 Actually, in the ACE 2005 Chinese (training) corpus, more 

than 90% of triggers are either verbs al or verbal nouns (those 

verbs which act as nouns). For simplicity, we don’t 

differentiate these two types in this paper. 

From above structures, a BV plays an important 

role in the verb structure and most of semantics of 

a verb can be interred from its contained BV and 

two words normally have very similar semantics if 

they have the same BV (e.g. “会见” (meet) and 

“会晤” (meet)). Actually, sometime the verb can 

be shortened to its contained BV (e.g. “我见王教

授 ” and “ 我 会 见 王 教 授 ” have the same 
semantics.).  

4.2 Inferring via Compositional Semantics 
inside Chinese Triggers 

Here a simple rule is employed to infer triggers via 

compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers: a 

verb is a trigger if it contains a BV which occurs 

as a known trigger or is contained in a known 

trigger. Table 5 shows the distribution of the set of 

triggers (contains the same BV
6
) classified by 

number of triggers.  

From Table 5, we can find out that 85.3% of 

BVs occur in more than one trigger and 56.2% of 

them in more than 4 triggers. As for trigger 

mentions, these percentages become 89.1% and 

65.2% respectively. A extreme example is that 

85.2% (75/88) of triggers of Trial-Hearing event 

mentions contain “审” (trial) and 85.4% (117/138) 

of triggers of injure event mentions contains “伤” 
(injure).

5~9 28.1% 32.9% 

>=10 28.1% 32.3% 

Table 5. Distribution of BVs in the number of 

triggers/trigger mentions  

 

In this paper, the inference is done as follows: 

 Add all single-character triggers into the BV set 

if it’s a verb; 

 Split all other triggers in the training set into a 

set of single characters and include all single 

characters into the BV set if it’s a verb; 

 For each word in the test set, it is identified as a 

trigger if it contains a BV. 

It is worthwhile to note that such inference 

works for unknown triggers and word 

                                                           
6 We didn’t tag BVs in the training set and regards all single-

character verbs contained in triggers as BVs. 

1010



segmentation errors to known triggers since in both 

cases, their BVs will always exist as either a SCW 

or a component of a word. 

4.3 Noise Filtering  

One problem with above inference is that while it 

is able to recover some true triggers and increase 

the recall, it may introduce many pseudo ones and 

harm the precision. To filter out those pseudo 

triggers, we propose following rules according to 

our intuition and statistics over the training set. 

Non-trigger Filtering 

A Chinese word will not be a trigger if it 

appears in the training set but never trigger an 

event. Statistics on the training set shows that this 

rule applies at 99.7% of cases. 

POS filtering 

A Chinese word will not be a trigger if it has a 

different POS from that of the same known 

trigger or similar known triggers
7

 in the 

training set. In Chinese, a single-character verb 

has very high probability of composing words (e.g. 

“到” (come), “为” (act as), “并” (combine), etc) 
with different POS from the single-character verb 

itself, such as preposition (e.g. “为了 ” (for)), 

conjunction (e.g. “并且” (and)), etc. Statistics on 
the training set shows that this rule applies at 

97.3% of cases.  

Verb structure filtering 

A Chinese word will not be a trigger if its verb 

structure is different from that of the same 

known trigger or similar known triggers in the 

training set. Figure 1 shows different distributions 

of three BVs over six verb structures as described 

in subsection 4.1. For example, we can find that all 

triggers including “解” (unbind) (e.g. “解聘” (fire), 

“解雇” (fire), “解散” (disband)) just have one verb 

structure (BV + verb) and those of “杀” (kill) have 
4 structures. Obviously, we can use such 

distribution information to filter out pseudo 

triggers. For example, although both word “劝解” 

(console) and “分解” (decompose) are constructed 

form verb “解”, their verb structure (verb + BV) 
does not appear in the training set. Therefore, they 

will be filtered our via verb structure filtering. 

                                                           
7 Similar triggers are those ones which have the same BV and 

verb structure. 

Statistics on the training set shows that this rule 

applies at 95.5% of cases.

5 Employing Discourse Consistency 
between Chinese Trigger Mentions  

Chinese event extraction may suffer much from the 

errors propagated from upstream processing such 

as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, especially 

word segmentation. To alleviate word 

segmentation errors to known triggers, Chen and Ji 

(2009b) constructed a global errata table to record 

the inconsistency in the training set and proved its 

effectiveness. In this paper, a merge and split 

method is applied to recover those known triggers. 

In this way, word segmentation errors can be 

alleviated to certain extent.  

For unknown triggers, we can merge two or 

more neighboring short words or single characters 

as a trigger candidate. In this paper, for each 

single-character verb in a document after word 

segmentation, this single-character verb can be 

merged with either previous SCW or next SCW to 

form a trigger candidate if this single-character 

verb has occurred in the training set with the same 

verb structure. 

Given above recovered triggers for both known 

and unknown triggers, the key issue here is how to 

distinguish true triggers from pseudo ones. In this 

paper, we employ discourse consistency between 

Chinese trigger mentions for Chinese event 

extraction. Previous studies on English event 

extraction have proved the effectiveness of both 

cross-entity and cross-document consistency.  

5.1 Discourse Consistency between Chinese 
Trigger Mentions  

As a discourse-driven language, the syntax of 

1011



Chinese is not as strict as English and sometime 

we must infer from the discourse-level information 

to understand the meaning of a sentence. Kim 

(2000) compared the use of overt subjects in 

English and Chinese and he found that overt 

subjects occupy over 96% in English, while this 

percentage drops to only 64% in Chinese. 

Similarly, argument missing is another issue in 

Chinese event extraction and almost 55% of 

arguments are missing in the ACE 2005 Chinese 

corpus. Normally, using a feature-based approach 

to distinguish true triggers from pseudo ones is 

very difficult from the sentence level if some of 

related arguments are missing from the trigger-

occurring sentence. Take following two contingent 

sentences as examples: 

(3) 美国与北韩 3 号在吉隆坡结束飞弹会谈。  
(The United States and the Democratic 

People's Republic of Korea finished missile 

talks in Kuala Lumpur.) 

(4) 会谈的气氛严肃。 
(The talks are serious.) 

While it is relatively easy to determine that 

mention “会谈” in sentence (3) indicates a meet 
event from the contained information in itself 

(there are many entities, such as agents, time and 

place in the sentence) and difficult to determine 

that mention “会谈” in sentence (4) is a meet event 
from the contained information in itself, we can 

easily infer from sentence (3) that sentence (4) also 

indicates a meet event, using discourse consistency:

Table 6. Comparison of discourse consistency between 

Chinese and English trigger mentions 

 

Table 6 compares the probabilities of discourse 

consistency between Chinese and English trigger 

mentions in the ACE 2005 Chinese and English 

corpora. A trigger may appear many times in a 

discourse. It’s considered discourse-consistent 

when all the appearances of a trigger have the 

same event type while instance-based consistency 

refers to pair-wired cases. It shows that within the 

discourse, there is a strong consistency in both 

Chinese and English between trigger mentions: if 

one instance of a word is a trigger, other instances 

in the same discourse will be a trigger of the same 

event type with very high probability.

Figure 2. Probabilities of discourse-level consistency of 

top 10 frequent triggers 

It also shows that discourse consistency in 

Chinese triggers holds much more likely than the 

English counterpart. Figure 2 give the probabilities 

of discourse-level consistency of top 10 frequent 

triggers, which occupy 18% of event mentions in 

the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus. 

5.2 Inference via Discourse Consistency 
between Chinese Trigger Mentions  

Given a discourse and different mentions of a 

trigger returned by the trigger identifier, we can 

simply accept those mentions with high probability 

as true mentions of the trigger and discard those 

with low probability8. However, for those mentions 

in-between, an additional discourse-level trigger 

identifier is further employed to determine whether 

a trigger mention is true or not from the discourse 

level by augmenting the normal trigger identifier 

with several features to explore the consistency 

information between trigger mentions in the 

discourse (first three features) and the related 

information returned from the trigger type 

identifier (last two features).  

 Probability of the discourse consistency of the 
candidate trigger mention in the training set. If 

it doesn’t exist in the training set, we infer its 

probability from that of all of its similar triggers 

 Number of candidate trigger mentions being a 
trigger in the same discourse via trigger 

identification 

 Number of candidate trigger mentions being a 
non-trigger in the same discourse via trigger 

identification 

                                                           
8 The high and low probability thresholds are fine-tuned to 

95% and 5% respectively, using the development set.

6 Experiments 

In this section, we evaluate our two inference 

mechanisms in Chinese trigger identification and 

its application to overall Chinese event extraction, 

using the same experimental settings as described 

in Subsection 3.1. 

6.1 Chinese Trigger Identification 

Table 7 shows the impact of compositional 

semantics in trigger identification. Here, the 

baseline just extracts those triggers occurring in the 

training data. It justifies the effectiveness of our 

compositional semantics-based inference 

mechanism in recovering true triggers and its three 

filtering rules in removing pseudo triggers.

Table 7. Impact of compositional semantics in trigger 

identification 

 

To reduce those pseudo triggers after above 

inference process, three rules are introduced.  

The first rule, the non-trigger filtering rule, 

filters out those pseudo ones in the test set which 

do not frequently occur as trigger mentions in the 

training set. In particular, to keep true triggers in 

our candidate set as many as possible, we just filter 

out those candidates which occur as non-triggers 

more than 5 times in the training set according to 

our validation on the development set. Table 7 

shows that 43.7% (823) of pseudo triggers are 

filtered out while only 1.8% (6) of true ones is 

wrongly filtered out.  

The second rule, the POS filtering rule, just 

filters out 8.3% (88) of pseudo triggers, due to 

POS errors in word segmentation and constituent 

parsing (e.g. 9.4% of candidate triggers have 

wrong POS tags in the development set.). Manual 

inspection shows that if we correct those wrong 

POS tags, that percentage will be increased to 

14.5%. 

The third rule, the verb structure filtering rule, is 

deployed in following steps: 1) keeping all 

candidates if they act as a trigger in the training set; 

2) if the candidate is a SCW, removing it when it 

does not occur as a BV in any triggers in the 

training set; 3) if the candidate is not a SCW, 

calculating the condition probability of its similar 

trigger words as triggers in the training set
9
 and 

then deleting all candidates whose conditional 

probabilities are less than a threshold θ , which is 

fine-tuned to 0.5. Figure 3 shows the effect on 

precision, recall and F1-measure of varying the 

thresholdθ  on the development set.

Table 8. Contribution to Chinese triggers identification 

(incremental) 

 

Table 8 shows the contribution of employing 

compositional semantics and discourse consistency 

to trigger identification on the held-out test set. We 

can find out that our approach dramatically 

enhances F1-measure by 9.0 units, largely due to a 

dramatic increase of 11.5% in recall, benefiting 

from both compositional semantics and discourse 

consistency mechanisms. We expect that the 

precision will also increase since our filtering 

approach successfully filters out almost 30% more

the average one.

non-triggers and the number of non-trigger 

mentions is less than that of the baseline. 

Unfortunately, the resulting set of 444 non-trigger 

mentions (after all filtering) is not a subset of 

original 629 non-trigger ones. Our observation 

shows that our compositional semantics inference 

adds almost 10% new non-triggers into candidates 

which are very hard to distinguish.  

Table 8 also justifies the impact of the discourse 

consistency between trigger mentions in trigger 

identification and the effect of the additional 

discourse-level trigger identifier, with a big gain of 

5.8% in precision and a small gain of 1.4% in 

recall. 

6.2 Chinese Event Extraction 

Table 9 shows the contribution of trigger 

identification with compositional semantics and 

discourse consistency to overall event extraction 

on the held-out test set. In addition, we also report 

the performance of two human annotators (The 

human annotator 1 is a first year postgraduate 

student with no background to Chinese event 

extraction while the human annotator 2 is a third 

year postgraduate student working on Chinese 

event extraction) on 33 texts (a subset of the held-

out test set). From the results presented in Table 9, 

we can find that our approach can improve the F1-

measure for trigger identification by 9.0 units, 

trigger type determination by 9.1 units, argument 

identification by 6.0 units and argument role 

determination (i.e. overall event extraction) by 5.4 

units, largely due to the dramatic increase in recall 

of 11.5%, 11.2%, 7.5% and 7.2%.

Table 9: Overall contribution to Chinese event extraction  

 

In addition, the results of two annotators show 

that Chinese event extraction is really challenging 

even for a well-educated human being. As shown 

in Table 9, the inter-annotator agreement on trigger 

identification and trigger type determination is 

even less than 45%. Although this figure is very 

low, it is not surprising: the results on the English 

ACE 2005 corpus show that the inter-annotator 

agreement on trigger identification is only about 

40% (Ji and Grishman, 2008). Detailed analysis 

shows that a human annotator tends to make more 

mistakes in trigger identification for two reasons. 

The first reason is that a human annotator always 

misses some event mentions when a sentence 

contains more than one event mention. The second 

reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention 

due to the failure of following specified annotation 

guidelines, as mentioned in Ji and Grishman 

(2008). Table 9 also shows the performance gaps 

of human annotators between trigger identification 

and trigger type determination is very small (2.5% 

and 3.8% in F1-measure). It ensures that trigger 

identification is the most important step in Chinese 

event extraction for a human being. For human 

annotators, it’s much easier to determine the event 

type of a trigger, identify its arguments and 

determine the role of each argument, all with more 

than 90% in accuracy, once a trigger is identified 

correctly.  

6.3 Discussion 

Compared with English, the word structures in 

Chinese are much more complex and diverse, 

causing a lot of troubles in Chinese language 

processing. We ensure that compositional 

semantics in Chinese words is very useful for 

many Chinese language processing applications, 

such as machine translation, semantic parser, etc. 

For example, many actions (e.g. “砍” (hack), “咬” 

(bite), “踢” (kick), etc) can combine with “伤” 
(injure) to form words and most of those words 

have similar semantics. The results in table 8 show 

its contribution in Chinese event extraction. 

Although our approach is simple, the result is 

1014



promising enough for further efforts in this 

direction.  

This paper shows that the compositional 

semantics in the verb structure provides an ideal 

way to expand the coverage of triggers. As a 

discourse-driven language, ellipsis is very common 

in Chinese, causing inference from the discourse-

level information is a fundamental requirement to 

understand the meaning of a clause, sentence or 

discourse. 

7 Conclusion 

In this paper we propose two novel inference 

mechanisms to Chinese trigger identification. In 

particular, compositional semantics inside Chinese 

triggers and discourse consistency between 

Chinese trigger mentions are used to resolve two 

critical issues in Chinese trigger identification: 

unknown triggers and word segmentation errors to 

known triggers. We give good reasons why this 

should be done, and present effective methods how 

this could be done. It shows that such novel 

inference mechanisms for Chinese event extraction 

are linguistically justified and pragmatically 

beneficial to real world applications.  

In future work, we will focus on how to 

introduce the discourse information into the 

individual classifiers to capture those long-distance 

features and joint learning of subtasks in Chinese 

event extraction.
