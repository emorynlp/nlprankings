Abstract

In this work, we present SAMAR, a sys-
tem for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis
(SSA) for Arabic social media genres. We
investigate: how to best represent lexical in-
formation; whether standard features are use-
ful; how to treat Arabic dialects; and, whether
genre specific features have a measurable im-
pact on performance. Our results suggest that
we need individualized solutions for each do-
main and task, but that lemmatization is a fea-
ture in all the best approaches.

1 Introduction

In natural language, subjectivity refers to aspects of
language used to express opinions, feelings, eval-
uations, and speculations (Banfield, 1982) and, as
such, it incorporates sentiment. The process of sub-
jectivity classification refers to the task of classify-
ing texts as either objective (e.g., The new iPhone
was released.) or subjective. Subjective text can
further be classified with sentiment or polarity. For
sentiment classification, the task consists of iden-
tifying whether a subjective text is positive (e.g.,
The Syrians continue to inspire the world with their
courage!), negative (e.g., The bloodbaths in Syria
are horrifying!), neutral (e.g., Obama may sign the
bill.), or, sometimes, mixed (e.g., The iPad is cool,
but way too expensive).

In this work, we address two main issues in Sub-
jectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA): First, SSA
has mainly been conducted on a small number of
genres such as newspaper text, customer reports,

and blogs. This excludes, for example, social me-
dia genres (such as Wikipedia Talk Pages). Second,
despite increased interest in the area of SSA, only
few attempts have been made to build SSA systems
for morphologically-rich languages (Abbasi et al.,
2008; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011b), i.e. languages
in which a significant amount of information con-
cerning syntactic units and relations is expressed at
the word-level, such as Finnish or Arabic. We thus
aim at partially bridging these two gaps in research
by developing an SSA system for Arabic, a mor-
phologically highly complex languages (Diab et al.,
2007; Habash et al., 2009). We present SAMAR, a
sentence-level SSA system for Arabic social media
texts. We explore the SSA task on four different gen-
res: chat, Twitter, Web forums, and Wikipedia Talk
Pages. These genres vary considerably in terms of
their functions and the language variety employed.
While the chat genre is overridingly in dialectal Ara-
bic (DA), the other genres are mixed between Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA) and DA in varying de-
grees. In addition to working on multiple genres,
SAMAR handles Arabic that goes beyond MSA.

1.1 Research Questions
In the current work, we focus on investigating four
main research questions:

• RQ1: How can morphological richness be
treated in the context of Arabic SSA?

• RQ2: Can standard features be used for SSA
for social media despite the inherently short
texts typically used in these genres?

• RQ3: How do we treat dialects?
19



• RQ4: Which features specific to social media
can we leverage?

RQ1 is concerned with the fact that SSA has
mainly been conducted for English, which has lit-
tle morphological variation. Since the features used
in machine learning experiments for SSA are highly
lexicalized, a direct application of these methods is
not possible for a language such as Arabic, in which
one lemma can be associated with thousands of sur-
face forms. For this reason, we need to investigate
how to avoid data sparseness resulting from using
lexical features without losing information that is
important for SSA. More specifically, we concen-
trate on two questions: Since we need to reduce
word forms to base forms to combat data sparseness,
is it more useful to use tokenization or lemmatiza-
tion? And given that the part-of-speech (POS) tagset
for Arabic contains a fair amount of morphological
information, how much of this information is useful
for SSA? More specifically, we investigate two dif-
ferent reduced tagsets, the RTS and the ERTS. For
more detailed information see section 4.

RQ2 addresses the impact of using two stan-
dard features, frequently employed in SSA studies
(Wiebe et al., 2004; Turney, 2002), on social media
data, which exhibit DA usage and text length vari-
ations, e.g. in twitter data. First, we investigate the
utility of applying a UNIQUE feature (Wiebe et al.,
2004) where low frequency words below a thresh-
old are replaced with the token ”UNIQUE”. Given
that our data includes very short posts (e.g., twitter
data has a limit of only 140 characters per tweet),
it is questionable whether the UNIQUE feature will
be useful or whether it replaces too many content
words. Second, we test whether a polarity lexicon
extracted in a standard domain using Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA) transfers to social media data.
Third, given the inherent lack of a standardized or-
thography for DA, the problem of replacing content
words is expected to be increased since many DA
content words would be spelled in different ways.

RQ3 is concerned with the fact that for Arabic,
there are significant differences between dialects.
However, existing NLP tools such as tokenizers and
POS taggers are exclusively trained on and for MSA.
We thus investigate whether using an explicit feature
that identifies the dialect of the text improves SSA

performance.
RQ4 is concerned with attempting to improve

SSA performance, which suffers from the problems
described above, by leveraging information that is
typical for social media genres, such as author or
gender information.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, we review related work. Section 3 de-
scribes the social media corpora and the polarity lex-
icon used in the experiments, Section 4 describes
SAMAR, the SSA system and the features used in
the experiments. Section 5 describes the experi-
ments and discusses the results. In Section 6, we
give an overview of the best settings for the differ-
ent corpora, followed by a conclusion in Section 7.

2 Related Work

The bulk of SSA work has focused on movie and
product reviews (Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu,
2004; Turney, 2002). A number of sentence- and
phrase-level classifiers have been built: For exam-
ple, whereas Yi et al. (2003) present a system that
detects sentiment toward a given subject, Kim and
Hovy’s (2004) system detects sentiment towards a
specific, predefined topic. Our work is similar to Yu
and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) and Wiebe et al. (1999)
in that we use lexical and POS features.

Only few studies have been performed on Arabic.
Abbasi et al. (2008) use a genetic algorithm for both
English and Arabic Web forums sentiment detection
on the document level. They exploit both syntactic
and stylistic features, but do not use morphological
features. Their system is not directly comparable to
ours due to the difference in data sets.More related to
our work is our previous effort (2011b) in which we
built an SSA system that exploits newswire data. We
report a slight system improvement using the gold-
labeled morphological features and a significant im-
provement when we use features based on a polarity
lexicon from the news domain. In that work, our
system performs at 71.54% F for subjectivity classi-
fication and 95.52% F for sentiment detection. This
current work is an extension on our previous work
however it differs in that we use automatically pre-
dicted morphological features and work on data be-
longing to more genres and DA varieties, hence ad-
dressing a more challenging task.

3 Data Sets and Annotation

To our knowledge, no gold-labeled social media
SSA data exist. Thereby, we create annotated data
comprising a variety of data sets:

DARDASHA (DAR): (Arabic for “chat”) com-
prises the first 2798 chat turns collected from a ran-
domly selected chat session from “Egypt’s room” in
Maktoob chat chat.mymaktoob.com. Maktoob
is a popular Arabic portal. DAR is an Egyptian Ara-
bic subset of a larger chat corpus that was harvested
between December 2008 and February 2010.

TAGREED (TGRD): (“tweeting”) is a corpus
of 3015 Arabic tweets collected during May 2010.
TRGD has a mixture of MSA and DA. The MSA
part (TRGD-MSA) has 1466 tweets, and the dialec-
tal part (TRGD-DA) has 1549 tweets.

TAHRIR (THR): (“editing”) is a corpus of 3008
sentences sampled from a larger pool of 30 MSA
Wikipedia Talk Pages that we harvested.

MONTADA (MONT): (“forum”) comprises of
3097 Web forum sentences collected from a larger
pool of threaded conversations pertaining to differ-
ent varieties of Arabic, including both MSA and DA,
from the COLABA data set (Diab et al., 2010). The
discussions covered in the forums pertain to social
issues, religion or politics. The sentences were au-
tomatically filtered to exclude non-MSA threads.

Each of the data sets was labeled at the sentence
level by two college-educated native speakers of
Arabic. For each sentence, the annotators assigned
one of 3 possible labels: (1) objective (OBJ), (2)
subjective-positive (S-POS), (3) subjective-negative
(S-NEG), and (3) subjective-mixed (S-MIXED).
Following (Wiebe et al., 1999), if the primary goal
of a sentence is judged as the objective reporting
of information, it was labeled as OBJ. Otherwise, a
sentence was a candidate for one of the three SUBJ
classes. We also labeled the data with a number of
other metadata1 tags. Metadata labels included the
user gender (GEN), the user identity (UID) (e.g. the
user could be a person or an organization), and the
source document ID (DID). We also mark the lan-
guage variety (LV) (i.e., MSA or DA) used, tagged
at the level of each unit of analysis (i.e., sentence,
tweet, etc.). Annotators were instructed to label a

features are more related to social interaction phenomena.

tweet as MSA if it mainly employs MSA words and
adheres syntactically to MSA rules, otherwise it is
treated as dialectal. Table 1 shows the annotations
for each data set. Data statistics, distribution of
classes, and inter-annotator agreement in terms of
Kappa (K) are provided in Table 2.

Polarity Lexicon: We manually created a lexicon
of 3982 adjectives labeled with one of the following
tags {positive, negative, neutral}, as is reported in
our previous work (2011b). We focus on adjectives
since they are primary sentiment bearers. The ad-
jectives pertain to the newswire domain, and were
extracted from the first four parts of the Penn Arabic
Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004).

4 SAMAR

4.1 Automatic Classification

SAMAR is a machine learning system for Arabic
SSA. For classification, we use SVMlight (Joachims,
2008). In our experiments, we found that linear ker-
nels yield the best performance. We perform all ex-
periments with presence vectors: In each sentence
vector, the value of each dimension is binary, regard-
less of how many times a feature occurs.

In the current study, we adopt a two-stage clas-
sification approach. In the first stage (i.e., Subjec-
tivity), we build a binary classifier to separate objec-
tive from subjective cases. For the second stage (i.e.,
Sentiment) we apply binary classification that distin-
guishes S-POS from S-NEG cases. We disregard the
neutral and mixed classes for this study. SAMAR
uses different feature sets, each of which is designed
to address an individual research question:

4.2 Morphological Features

Word forms: In order to minimize data sparse-
ness as a result of the morphological richness of
Arabic, we tokenize the text automatically. We
use AMIRA (Diab, 2009), a suite for automatic

processing of MSA, trained on Penn Arabic Tree-
bank (Maamouri et al., 2004) data, which consists
of newswire text. We experiment with two different
configurations to extract base forms of words: (1)
Token (TOK), where the stems are left as is with no
further processing of the morpho-tactics that result
from the segmentation of clitics; (2) Lemma (LEM),
where the words are reduced to their lemma forms,
(citation forms): for verbs, this is the 3rd person
masculine singular perfective form and for nouns,
this corresponds to the singular default form (typi-
cally masculine). For example, the word Ñî�EA 	Jm�'. ð
(wbHsnAtHm) is tokenized as ð + H. +

�
HA

	
Jk + Ñë

(w+b+HsnAt+Hm) (note that in TOK, AMIRA does
not split off the pluralizing suffix �H@ (At) from the
stem 	ák (Hsn)), while in the lemmatization step

by AMIRA, the lemma rendered is é 	Jk (Hsnp).
Thus, SAMAR uses the form of the word as Hsnp
in the LEM setting, and HsnAt in the TOK setting.

POS tagging: Since we use only the base forms
of words, the question arises whether we lose mean-
ingful morphological information and consequently
whether we could represent this information in the
POS tags instead. Thus, we use two sets of POS
features that are specific to Arabic: the reduced
tag set (RTS) and the extended reduced tag set
(ERTS) (Diab, 2009). The RTS is composed of 42
tags and reflects only number for nouns and some
tense information for verbs whereas the ERTS com-
prises 115 tags and enriches the RTS with gender,
number, and definiteness information. Diab (2007b;
2007a) shows that using the ERTS improves re-
sults for higher processing tasks such as base phrase
chunking of Arabic.

4.3 Standard Features

This group includes two features that have been em-
ployed in various SSA studies.

Unique: Following Wiebe et al. (2004), we ap-
ply a UNIQUE (Q) feature: We replace low fre-
quency words with the token ”UNIQUE”. Exper-
iments showed that setting the frequency threshold
to 3 yields the best results.

Polarity Lexicon (PL): The lexicon (cf. section
3) is used in two different forms for the two tasks:
For subjectivity classification, we follow Bruce and
Wiebe (1999; 2011b) and add a binary has adjective
feature indicating whether or not any of the ad-
jectives in the sentence is part of our manually
created polarity lexicon. For sentiment classifica-
tion, we apply two features, has POS adjective and
has NEG adjective. These binary features indicate
whether a POS or NEG adjective from the lexicon
occurs in a sentence.

4.4 Dialectal Arabic Features
Dialect: We apply the two gold language variety
features, {MSA, DA}, on the Twitter data set to rep-
resent whether the tweet is in MSA or in a dialect.

4.5 Genre Specific Features
Gender: Inspired by gender variation research ex-
ploiting social media data (e.g., (Herring, 1996)),
we apply three gender (GEN) features correspond-
ing to the set {MALE, FEMALE, UNKNOWN}.
Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2012a) suggest that there
is a relationship between politeness strategies and
sentiment expression. And gender variation research
in social media shows that expression of linguistic
politeness (Brown and Levinson, 1987) differs based
on the gender of the user.

User ID: The user ID (UID) labels are inspired
by research on Arabic Twitter showing that a consid-
erable share of tweets is produced by organizations
such as news agencies (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011a)
as opposed to lay users. We hence employ two fea-
tures from the set {PERSON, ORGANIZATION} to

22



classification of the Twitter data set. The assumption
is that tweets by persons will have a higher correla-
tion with expression of sentiment.

Document ID: Projecting a document ID (DID)
feature to the paragraph level was shown to im-
prove subjectivity classification on data from the
health policy domain (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011c).
Hence, by employing DID at the instance level, we
are investigating the utility of this feature for social
media as well as at a finer level of analysis, i.e., the
sentence level.

5 Empirical Evaluation

For each data set, we divide the data into 80% train-
ing (TRAIN), 10% for development (DEV), and
10% for testing (TEST). The classifier was opti-
mized on the DEV set; all results that we report be-
low are on TEST. In each case, our baseline is the
majority class in the training set. We report accu-
racy as well as the F scores for the individual classes
(objective vs. subjective and positive vs. negative).

5.1 Impact of Morphology on SSA

We run two experimental conditions: 1. A compari-
son of TOK to LEM (cf. sec. 4.2); 2. A combination
of RTS and ERTS with TOK and LEM.

TOK vs. LEM: Table 3 shows the results for the
morphological preprocessing conditions. The base-
line, Base, is the majority class in the training data.
For all data sets, Subjective is the majority class.
For subjectivity classification we see varying per-
formance. DAR: TOK outperforms LEM for all
metrics, yet performance is below Base. TGRD:
LEM preprocessing yields better accuracy results
than Base. LEM is consistently better than TOK
for all metrics. THR: We see the opposite perfor-
mance compared to the TGRD data set where TOK
outperforms LEM and also outperforming Base. Fi-
nally for MONT: the performance of LEM and TOK
are exactly the same yielding the same results as in
Base.

For sentiment classification, the majority class
is positive for DAR and MONT and negative for
TGRD and THR. We note that there are no obvi-
ous trends between TOK and LEM. DAR: we ob-
serve better performance of LEM over Base and

TOK. TGRD: Both preprocessing schemes outper-
form Base on all metrics with TOK outperforming
LEM across the board. THR: LEM outperforms
TOK for all metrics of sentiment, yet they are be-
low Base performance. MONT: TOK outperforms
LEM in terms of accuracy, and positive sentiment,
yet LEM slightly outperforms TOK for negative sen-
timent classification. Both TOK and LEM are beat
by Base in terms of accuracy and positive classifica-
tion. Given the observed results, we observe no clear
trends for the impact for morphological preprocess-
ing alone on performance.

Adding POS tags: Table 4 shows the results of
adding POS tags based on the two tagsets RTS
and ERTS. Subjectivity classification: The results
show that adding POS information improves ac-
curacy and F score for all the data sets except
MONT which is still at Base performance. RTS
outperforms ERTS with TOK, and the opposite with
LEM where ERTS outperforms RTS, however, over-
all TOK+RTS yields the highest performance of
91.49% F score on subjectivity classification for the
DAR dataset. For the TGRD and THR data sets, we
note that TOK+ERTS is equal to or outperforms the
other conditions on subjectivity classification. For
MONT there is no difference between experimental
conditions and no impact for adding the POS tag in-
formation. In the sentiment classification task:

The sentiment task shows a different trend: here,
the highest performing systems do not use POS tags.
This is attributed to the variation in genre between
the training data on which AMIRA is trained (MSA
newswire) and the data sets we are experimenting
with in this work. However in relative compari-

son between RTS and ERTS for sentiment shows
that in a majority of the cases, ERTS outperforms
RTS, thus indicating that the additional morpholog-
ical features are helpful. One possible explanation
may be that variations of some of the morphologi-
cal features (e.g., existence of a gender, person, ad-
jective feature) may correlate more frequently with
positive or negative sentiment.

5.2 Standard Features for Social Media Data

RQ2 concerns the question whether standard fea-
tures can be used successfully for classifying social
media text characterized by the usage of dialect and
by differing text lengths. We add the standard fea-
tures, polarity (PL) and UNIQUE (Q), to the two to-
kenization schemes and the POS tag sets. We report
only the best performing conditions here.

Table 5 shows the best performing settings per
corpus from the previous section as well as the best
performing setting given the new features. The re-
sults show that apart from THR and TGRD for sen-
timent, all corpora gain in accuracy for both sub-
jectivity and sentiment. In the case of subjectiv-
ity, while considerable improvements are gained for
both DAR (11.51% accuracy) and THR (32.90% ac-
curacy), only slight improvements (< 1% accuracy)
are reached for both TGRD and MONT. For sen-
timent classification, the improvements in accuracy
are less than the case of subjectivity: 1.84% for DAR

and 6.81% for MONT. The deterioration on THR is
surprising and may be a result of the nature of sen-
timent as expressed in the THR data set: Wikipedia
has a ’Neutral Point of View’ policy based on which
users are required to focus their contributions not
on other users but content, and as such sentiment is
expressed in nuanced indirect ways in THR. While
the subjectivity results show that it is feasible to use
the combination of the UNIQUE feature and the po-
larity lexicon features successfully, even for shorter
texts, such as in the twitter data (TGRD), this con-
clusion does not always hold for sentiment classi-
fication. However, we assume that the use of the
polarity lexicon would result in higher gains if the
lexicon were adapted to the new domains.

5.3 SSA Given Arabic Dialects

RQ3 investigates how much the results of SSA are
affected by the presence or absence of dialectal Ara-
bic in the data. For this question, we focus on the
TGRD data set because it contains a non-negligible
amount (i.e., 48.62%) of tweets in dialect.

First, we investigate how our results change when
we split the TGRD data set into two subsets, one
containing only MSA, the other one containing only
DA. We extract the 80-10-10% data split, then train
and test the classifier exclusively on either MSA or
dialect data. The subjectivity results for this exper-
iment are shown in Table 6, and the sentiment re-

sults are shown in Table 7. For both tasks, the re-
sults show considerable differences between MSA
and DA: For TGRD-MSA, the results are lower than
for TGRD-DA, which is a direct consequence of
the difference in distribution of subjectivity between
the two subcorpora. TGRD-DA is mostly subjective
while TGRD-MSA is more balanced. With regard
to sentiment, TGRD-DA consists of mostly negative
tweets while TGRD-MSA again is more balanced.
These results suggest that knowing whether a tweet
is in dialect would help classification.

For subjectivity, we can see that TGRD-MSA im-
proves by 13.5% over the baseline while for TGRD-
DA, the improvement is more moderate, < 3%. We
assume that this is partly due to the higher skew in
TGRD-DA, moreover, it is known that our prepro-
cessing tools yield better performance on MSA data
leading to better tokenization and lemmatization.

For sentiment classification on TGRD-MSA, nei-
ther tokenization nor lemmatization improve over
the baseline. This is somewhat surprising since we
expect AMIRA to work well on this data set and thus
to lead to better classification results. However, a
considerable extent of the MSA tweets are expected
to come from news headlines (Abdul-Mageed et
al., 2011a), and headlines usually are not loci of ex-
plicitly subjective content and hence are difficult to
classify and in essence harder to preprocess since
the genre is different from regular newswire even if
MSA. For the TGRD-DA data set, both lemmatiza-
tion and tokenization improve over the baseline.

The results for both subjectivity and sentiment on
the MSA and DA sets suggest that processing errors
by AMIRA trained exclusively on MSA newswire
data) result in deteriorated performance. However
we do not observe such trends on the TGRD-DA
data sets. This is not surprising since the TGRD-
DA is not very different from the newswire data on
which AMIRA was trained: Twitter users discuss
current events topics also discussed in newswire.
There is also a considerable lexical overlap between
MSA and DA. Furthermore, dialectal data may be
loci for more sentiment cues like emoticons, certain
punctuation marks (e.g. exclamation marks), etc.
Such clues are usually absent (or less frequent) in
MSA data and hence the better sentiment classifica-
tion on TGRD-DA.

We also experimented with adding POS tags and
standard features. These did not have any positive
effect on the results with one exception, which is
shown in Table 8: For sentiment, adding the RTS
tagset has a positive effect on the two data sets.

In a second experiment, we used the original
TGRD corpus but added the language variety (LV)
(i.e., MSA and DA) features. For both subjectiv-
ity and sentiment, the best results are acquired us-
ing the LEM+PL+LV settings. However, for subjec-
tivity, we observe a drop in accuracy from 72.52%
(LEM+ERTS+PL) to 69.54%. For sentiment, we
also observe a performance drop in accuracy, from
65.32% (LEM+ERTS+PL) to 64.52%. This means
that knowing the language variety does not provide

differences between those varieties.

5.4 Leveraging Genre Specific Features

RQ4 investigates the question whether we can lever-
age features typical for social media for classifica-
tion. We apply all GENRE features exhaustively.We
report the best performance on each data set.

Table 9 shows the results of adding the genre fea-
tures to the subjectivity classifier. For this task, no
data sets profit from these features.

Table 10 shows the results of adding the genre fea-
tures to the sentiment classifier. Here, all the data
sets, with the exception of MONT, profit from the
new features. In the case of DAR, adding gender
information improves classification by 1.73% in ac-
curacy. For TGRD, the combination of the gender
(GN), language variety (LV), and user ID slightly

(0.52%) improves classification over previous best
settings. For THR, adding the gender and user ID
information improves classification by 4.07%.

Our results thus show the utility of the gender,
LV, and user ID features for sentiment classification.
The results for both subjectivity and sentiment show
that the document ID feature is not a useful feature.

6 Overall Performance

Table 8 provides the best results reached by
SAMAR. For subjectivity classification, SAMAR
improves on all data sets when the POS features are
combined with the standard features. For sentiment
classification, SAMAR also improves over the base-
line on all the data sets, except MONT. The results
also show that all optimal feature settings for sub-
jectivity, except with the MONT data set, include
the ERTS POS tags while the results in Section 5.1
showed that adding POS information without addi-
tional features, while helping in most cases with sub-
jectivity, does not help with sentiment classification.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented SAMAR, an SSA system
for Arabic social media. We explained the rich fea-
ture set SAMAR exploits and showed how complex
morphology characteristic of Arabic can be handled
in the context of SSA. For the future, we plan to
carry out a detailed error analysis of SAMAR in an
attempt to improve its performance, use a recently-
developed wider coverage polarity lexicon (Abdul-
Mageed and Diab, 2012b) together with another DA
lexicon that we are currently developing.
