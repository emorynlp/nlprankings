Abstract

To avoid a sarcastic message being understood
in its unintended literal meaning, in microtexts
such as messages on Twitter.com sarcasm is
often explicitly marked with the hashtag ‘#sar-
casm’. We collected a training corpus of about
78 thousand Dutch tweets with this hashtag.
Assuming that the human labeling is correct
(annotation of a sample indicates that about
85% of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we
train a machine learning classifier on the har-
vested examples, and apply it to a test set of
a day’s stream of 3.3 million Dutch tweets.
Of the 135 explicitly marked tweets on this
day, we detect 101 (75%) when we remove the
hashtag. We annotate the top of the ranked list
of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not
have the explicit hashtag. 30% of the top-250
ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis
shows that sarcasm is often signalled by hy-
perbole, using intensifiers and exclamations;
in contrast, non-hyperbolic sarcastic messages
often receive an explicit marker. We hypothe-
size that explicit markers such as hashtags are
the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-
verbal expressions that people employ in live
interaction when conveying sarcasm.

1 Introduction

In the general area of sentiment analysis, sarcasm
plays a role as an interfering factor that can flip the
polarity of a message. Unlike a simple negation, a
sarcastic message typically conveys a negative opin-
ion using only positive words – or even intensified
positive words. The detection of sarcasm is there-
fore important, if not crucial, for the development

and refinement of sentiment analysis systems, but
is at the same time a serious conceptual and tech-
nical challenge. In this paper we introduce a sar-
casm detection system for tweets, messages on the
microblogging service offered by Twitter.1

In doing this we are helped by the fact that sar-
casm appears to be a well-understood concept by
Twitter users, as seen by the relatively accurate use
of an explicit marker of sarcasm, the hashtag ‘#sar-
casm’. Hashtags in messages on Twitter (tweets) are
explicitly marked keywords, and often act as cate-
gorical labels or metadata in addition to the body
text of the tweet. By using the explicit hashtag any
remaining doubt a reader may have is taken away:
the message is intended as sarcastic.

In communication studies, sarcasm has been
widely studied, often in relation with, or encom-
passed by concepts such as irony as a broader cate-
gory term, and in particular in relation with (or syn-
onymous to) verbal irony. A brief overview of def-
initions, hypotheses and findings from communica-
tion studies regarding sarcasm and verbal irony may
help clarify what the hashtag ‘#sarcasm’ conveys.

1.1 Definitions
Many researchers treat irony and sarcasm as
strongly related (Attardo, 2007; Brown, 1980; Gibbs
and O’Brien, 1991; Kreuz and Roberts, 1993;
Muecke, 1969; Mizzau, 1984), and sometimes even
equate the terms in their studies in order to work
with an usable definition (Grice, 1978; Tsur et al.,
2010). We are interested in sarcasm as a linguistic
phenomenon, and how we can detect it in social me-

dia messages. Yet, Brown (1980) warns that sarcasm
‘is not a discrete logical or linguistic phenomenon’
(p. 111), while verbal irony is; we take the liberty
of using the term sarcasm while verbal irony would
be the more appropriate term. Even then, according
to Gibbs and Colston (2007) the definition of ver-
bal irony is still a ‘problem that surfaces in the irony
literature’ (p. 584).

There are many different theoretical approaches
to verbal irony. Burgers (2010), who provides an
overview of approaches, distinguishes a number of
features in ironic utterances that need to be included
in an operational definition of irony: (1) irony is al-
ways implicit (Giora, 1995; Grice, 1978), (2) irony
is evaluative (Attardo, 2000; Kotthoff, 2003; Sper-
ber and Wilson, 1995), it is possible to (3) distin-
guish between a non-ironic and an ironic reading of
the same utterance (Grice, 1975; Grice, 1978), (4)
between which a certain type of opposition may be
observed (see also Kawakami, 1984, 1988, summa-
rized in (Hamamoto, 1998; Partington, 2007; Seto,
1998). Burgers’ own definition of verbal irony is ‘an
evaluative utterance, the valence of which is implic-
itly reversed between the literal and intended evalu-
ation’ (Burgers, 2010, p. 19).

Thus, a sarcastic utterance involves a shift in eval-
uative valence, which can go two ways: it could be
a shift from a literally positive to an intended neg-
ative meaning, or a shift from a literally negative
to an intended positive evaluation. Since Reyes et
al. (2012b) also argue that users of social media of-
ten use irony in utterances that involve a shift in
evaluative valence, we use Burgers’ (2010) defini-
tion of verbal irony in this study on sarcasm, and
we use both terms synonymously. The definition of
irony as saying the opposite of what is meant is com-
monly used in previous corpus-analytic studies, and
is reported to be reliable (Kreuz et al., 1996; Leigh,
1994; Srinarawat, 2005).

Irony is used relatively often in dialogic interac-
tion. Around 8% of conversational turns between
American college friends contains irony (Gibbs,
2007). According to Gibbs (2007), group members
use irony to ‘affirm their solidarity by directing com-
ments at individuals who are not group members and
not deemed worthy of group membership’ (p. 341).
When an individual sees a group’s normative stan-
dards violated, he uses sarcasm to vent frustration.

Sarcasm is also used when someone finds a situa-
tion or object offensive (Gibbs, 2007). Sarcasm or
irony is always directed at someone or something;
its target. A target is the person or object against
whom or which the ironic utterance is directed (Liv-
nat, 2004). Targets can be the sender himself, the
addressee or a third party (or a combination of the
three). Burgers (2010) showed that in Dutch written
communication, the target of the ironic utterance is
often a third party. These findings may be interest-
ing for our research, in which we study microtexts
of up to 140 characters from Twitter.

Sarcasm in written and spoken interaction may
work differently (Jahandarie, 1999). In spoken in-
teraction, sarcasm is often marked with a special
intonation (Attardo et al., 2003; Bryant and Tree,
2005; Rockwell, 2007) or an incongruent facial ex-
pression (Muecke, 1978; Rockwell, 2003; Attardo
et al., 2003). Burgers (2010) argues that in writ-
ten communication, authors do not have clues like ‘a
special intonation’ or ‘an incongruent facial expres-
sion’ at their disposal. Since sarcasm is more diffi-
cult to comprehend than a literal utterance (Gibbs,
1986; Giora, 2003; Burgers, 2010), it is likely that
addressees do not pick up on the sarcasm and in-
terpret the utterances literally. Acoording to Gibbs
and Izett (2005), sarcasm divides its addressees into
two groups; a group of people who understand sar-
casm (the so-called group of wolves) and a group
of people who do not understand sarcasm (the so-
called group of sheep). In order to ensure that the ad-
dressees detect the sarcasm in the utterance, senders
use linguistic markers in their utterances. According
to Attardo (2000) those markers are clues a writer
can give that ‘alert a reader to the fact that a sen-
tence is ironical’ (p. 7). On Twitter, the hashtag
‘#sarcasm’ is a popular marker.

1.2 Intensifiers

There are sarcastic utterances which would still be
qualified as sarcastic when all markers were re-
moved from it (Attardo et al., 2003), for example
the use of a hyperbole (Kreuz and Roberts, 1995).
It may be that a sarcastic utterance with a hyper-
bole (‘fantastic weather’ when it rains) is identi-
fied as sarcastic with more ease than a sarcastic ut-
terance without a hyperbole (‘the weather is good’
when it rains). While both utterances convey a lit-

30



erally positive attitude towards the weather, the ut-
terance with the hyperbolic ‘fantastic’ may be eas-
ier to interpret as sarcastic than the utterance with
the non-hyperbolic ‘good’. Such hyperbolic words
which strengthen the evaluative utterance are called
intensifiers. Bowers (1964) defines language inten-
sity as ‘the quality of language which indicates the
degree to which the speaker’s attitude toward a con-
cept deviates from neutrality’ (p. 416). According
to Van Mulken and Schellens (2012), an intensifier
is a linguistic element that can be removed or re-
placed while respecting the linguistic correctness of
the sentence and context, but resulting in a weaker
evaluation. A commonly used way to intensify ut-
terances is by using word classes such as adverbs
(‘very’) or adjectives (‘fantastic’ instead of ‘good’).
It may be that senders use such intensifiers in their
tweets to make the utterance hyperbolic and thereby
sarcastic, without using a linguistic marker such as
‘#sarcasm’.

1.3 Outline

In this paper we describe the design and imple-
mentation of a sarcasm detector that marks unseen
tweets as being sarcastic or not. We analyse the pre-
dictive performance of the classifier by testing its ca-
pacity on test tweets that are explicitly marked with
the hashtag #sarcasme (Dutch for ‘sarcasm’), left
out during testing, and its capacity to rank likely sar-
castic tweets that do not have the #sarcasme mark.
We also provide a qualitative linguistic analysis of
the features that the classifier thinks are the most
discriminative. In a further qualitative analysis of
sarcastic tweets in the test set we find that the use
of an explicit hashtag marking sarcasm occurs rela-
tively often without other indicators of sarcasm such
as intensifiers or exclamations.

2 Related Research

The automatic classification of communicative con-
structs in short texts has become a widely researched
subject in recent years. Large amounts of opinions,
status updates and personal expressions are posted
on social media platforms such as Twitter. The au-
tomatic labeling of their polarity (to what extent a
text is positive or negative) can reveal, when aggre-
gated or tracked over time, how the public in gen-

eral thinks about certain things. See Montoyo et al.
(2012) for an overview of recent research in senti-
ment analyis and opinion mining.

A major obstacle for automatically determining
the polarity of a (short) text are constructs in which
the literal meaning of the text is not the intended
meaning of the sender, as many systems for the de-
tection of polarity primarily lean on positive and
negative words as markers. The task to identify
such constructs can improve polarity classification,
and provide new insights into the relatively new
genre of short messages and microtexts on social
media. Previous works describe the classification
of irony (Reyes et al., 2012b), sarcasm (Tsur et al.,
2010), satire (Burfoot and Baldwin, 2009), and hu-
mor (Reyes et al., 2012a).

Most common to our research are the works by
Reyes et al. (2012b) and Tsur et al. (2010). Reyes et
al. (2012b) collect a training corpus of irony based
on tweets that consist of the hashtag #irony in order
to train classifiers on different types of features (sig-
natures, unexpectedness, style and emotional sce-
narios) and try to distinguish #irony-tweets from
tweets containing the hashtags #education, #hu-
mour, or #politics, achieving F1-scores of around
70. Tsur et al. (2010) focus on product reviews on
the World Wide Web, and try to identify sarcastic
sentences from these in a semi-supervised fashion.
Training data is collected by manually annotating
sarcastic sentences, and retrieving additional train-
ing data based on the annotated sentences as queries.
Sarcasm is annotated on a scale from 1 to 5. As fea-
tures, Tsur et al. look at the patterns in these sen-
tences, consisting of high-frequency words and con-
tent words. Their system achieves an F1-score of 79
on a testset of product reviews, after extracting and
annotating a sample of 90 sentences classified as sar-
castic and 90 sentences classified as not sarcastic.

In the two works described above, a system is
tested in a controlled setting: Reyes et al. (2012b)
compare irony to a restricted set of other topics,
while Tsur et al. (2010) took from the unlabeled
test set a sample of product reviews with 50% of
the sentences classified as sarcastic. In contrast, we
apply a trained sarcasm detector to a real-world test
set representing a realistically large sample of tweets
posted on a specific day of which the vast majority is
not sarcastic. Detecting sarcasm in social media is,

31



arguably, a needle-in-a-haystack problem (of the 3.3
million tweets we gathered on a single day, 135 are
explicitly marked with the hashtag #sarcasm), and it
is only reasonable to test a system in the context of a
typical distribution of sarcasm in tweets. Like in the
research of (Reyes et al., 2012b), we train a classifier
based on tweets with a specific hashtag.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Data

For the collection of tweets for this study we make
use of a database provided by the Netherlands e-
Science Centre, consisting of a substantial portion
of all Dutch tweets posted from December 2010 on-
wards.2 From this database, we collected all tweets
that contained the marker ‘#sarcasme’, the Dutch
word for sarcasm with the hashtag prefix. This re-
sulted in a set of 77,948 tweets. We also collected
all tweets posted on a single day, namely February
1, 2013.3 This set of tweets contains approximately
3,3 million tweets, of which 135 carry the hashtag
#sarcasme.

3.2 Winnow classification

Both the collected tweets with a #sarcasme hash-
tag and the tweets that were posted on a single day
were tokenized and stripped of punctuation. Capi-
tals were not removed, as they might be used to sig-
nal sarcasm (Burgers, 2010). We made use of word
uni-, bi- and trigrams as features. Terms that oc-
curred three times or less or in two tweets or less in
the whole set were removed, as well as the hashtag
#sarcasme. Features were weighted by the χ2 met-
ric.

As classification algorithm we made use of Bal-
anced Winnow (Littlestone, 1988) as implemented
in the Linguistic Classification System.4 This algo-
rithm is known to offer state-of-the-art results in text
classification, and produces interpretable per-class
weights that can be used to, for example, inspect
the highest-ranking features for one class label. The
α and β parameters were set to 1,05 and 0,95 re-
spectively. The major threshold (θ+) and the minor

from the set of sarcasm tweets.

threshold (θ−) were set to 2,5 and 0,5. The number
of iterations was bounded to a maximum of three.

3.3 Experiment

In order to train the classifier on distinctive features
of sarcasm in tweets, we combined the set of 78
thousand sarcasm tweets with a random sample of
other tweets posted on February 1, 2013 as back-
ground corpus. We made sure the background cor-
pus did not contain any of the 135 explicitly marked
sarcasm tweets posted that day. As the size of a
background corpus can influence the performance of
the classifier (in doubt, a classifier will be biased by
the skew of the distribution of classes in the training-
data), we performed a comparitive experiment with
two distributions between sarcasm-labeled tweets
and background tweets: in the first variant, the di-
vision between the two is 50%–50%, in the second,
25% of the tweets are sarcasm-labeled, and 75% are
background.

4 Results

To evaluate the outcome of our machine learning ex-
periment, we ran two evaluations. The first evalu-
ation focuses on the 135 tweets with explicit #sar-
casme hastags posted on February 1, 2013. We mea-
sured how well these tweets were identified using
the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR,
also known as recall), and their joint score, the area
under the curve (AUC). AUC is a common evalua-
tion metric that is argued to be more resistant to skew
than F-score, due to using TPR rather than precision
(Fawcett, 2004). Results are displayed in Table 1.
The first evaluation, on the variant with a balanced
distribution of the two classes, leads to a retrieval of
101 of the 135 sarcasm-tweets (75%), while nearly
500 thousand tweets outside of these were also clas-
sified as being sarcastic. When a quarter of the train-
ing tweets has a sarcasm label, a smaller amount of
76 sarcasm tweets are retrieved. The AUC scores for
the two ratios indicates that the 50%–50% balance
leads to the highest AUC score (0.79) for sarcasm.
Our subsequent analyses are based on the outcomes
when using this distribution in training.

Besides generating an absolute winner-take-all
classification, our Balanced Winnow classifier also
assigns scores to each label that can be seen as its

confidence in that label. We can rank its predictions
by the classifier’s confidence on the ‘sarcasm’ la-
bel and inspect manually which of the top-ranking
tweets is indeed sarcastic. We generated a list of the
250 most confident ‘sarcasm’-labeled tweets. Three
annotators (the authors of this paper) made a judge-
ment for these tweets as being either sarcastic or not.
In order to test for intercoder reliability, Cohen’s
Kappa was used. In line with Siegel and Castellan
(1988), we calculated a mean Kappa based on pair-
wise comparisons of all possible coder pairs. The
mean intercoder reliability between the three possi-
ble coder pairs is substantial (κ = .79).

When taking the majority vote of the three an-
notators as the golden label, a curve of the preci-
sion at all points in the ranking can be plotted. This
curve is displayed in Figure 1. As can be seen, the
overall performance is poor (the average precision
is 0.30). After peaking at 0.50 after 22 tweets, pre-
cision slowly decreases when descending to lower
rankings. During the first five tweets, the curve is at
0.0; these tweets, receiving the highest overall con-
fidence scores, are relatively short and contain one
strong sarcasm feature in the classifier without any
negative feature.

5 Analysis

Our first closer analysis of our results concerns the
reliability of the user-generated hastag #sarcasme as
a golden label, as Twitter users cannot all be as-
sumed to be experts in sarcasm or understand what
sarcasm is. The three annotators who annotated the
ranked classifier output also coded a random sam-
ple of 250 tweets with the #sarcasme hashtag from
the training set. The average score of agreement be-
tween the three possible coder pairs turned out to be
moderate (κ = .54). Taking the majority vote over

Figure 1: Precision at {1 . . . 250} on the sarcasm class

the three annotations as the reference labeling, 85%
(212) of the 250 annotated #sarcasme tweets were
found to be sarcastic.

While the classifier performance gives an impres-
sion of its ability to distinguish sarcastic tweets, the
strong indicators of sarcasm as discovered by the
classifier may provide additional insight into the us-
age of sarcasm by Twitter users: in particular, the
typical targets of sarcasm, and the different linguis-
tic markers that are used. We thus set out to ana-
lyze the feature weights assigned by the Balanced
Winnow classifier ranked by the strength of their
connection to the sarcasm label, taking into account
the 500 words and n-grams with the highest positive
weight towards the sarcasm class. These words and
n-grams provide insight into the topics Twitter users
are talking about: their targets. People often talk
about school and related subjects such as homework,
books, exams, classes (French, chemistry, physics),
teachers, the school picture, sports day, and (return-
ing from) vacation. Another popular target of sar-

33



casm is the weather: the temperature, rain, snow,
and sunshine. Apart from these two common top-
ics, people tend to be sarcastic about social media
itself, holidays, public transport, soccer, television
programs (The Voice of Holland), celebrities (Justin
Bieber), the church, the dentist and vacuum clean-
ing. Many of these topics are indicative of the young
age, on average, of Twitter users.

The strongest linguistic markers of sarcastic ut-
terances are markers that can be seen as syn-
onyms for #sarcasme, such as sarcasme (without
#), #ironie and ironie (irony), #cynisme and cynisme
(cynicism), or words that are strongly related to
those concepts by marking the opposite of the ex-
pressed utterance: #humor, #LOL, #joke (grapje),
and #NOT.

Second, the utterances contain much positive ex-
clamations that make the utterance hyperbolic and
thereby sarcastic. Examples of those markers in
Dutch are (with and without # and/or capitals): jip-
pie, yes, goh, joepie, jeej, jeuj, yay, woehoe, and
wow.

We suspected that the sarcastic utterances con-
tained intensifiers to make the tweets hyperbolic.
The list of strongest predictors show that some inten-
sifiers are indeed strong predictors of sarcasm, such
as geweldig (awesome), heerlijk (lovely), prachtig
(wonderful), natuurlijk (of course), gelukkig (for-
tunately), zoooo (soooo), allerleukste (most fun),
fantastisch (fantastic), and heeel (veeery). Besides
these intensifiers many unmarked positive words oc-
cur in the list of strongest predictors as well, such
as fijn (nice), gezellig (cozy), leuk (fun), origi-
neel (original), slim (smart), favoriet (favorite), nut-
tig (useful), and chill. Considerably less negative
words occur as strong predictors. This supports our
hypothesis that the utterances are mostly positive,
while the opposite meaning is meant. This find-
ing corresponds with the results of Burgers (2010),
who show that 77% of the ironic utterances in Dutch
communication are literally positive.

To inspect whether sarcastic tweets are always in-
tensified to be hyperbolic, we need to further analyse
the sarcastic tweets our classifier correctly identifies.
Analyzing the 76 tweets that our classifier correctly
identifies in the top-250 tweets the classifier rates as
sarcastic, we see that intensifiers do not dominate
in occurrence; supporting numbers are listed in Ta-

Relative

ble 2. About one in three sarcastic tweets, 34.2%,
are not hyperbolic at all: they are only explicitly
marked, most of the times with a hashtag. A major-
ity of 59.2% of the tweets does contain hyperbole-
inducing elements, such as an intensifier or an ex-
clamation, or combinations of these elements. A full
combination of explicit markers, intensifiers, and ex-
clamations only rarely occurs, however (2.6%). The
three categories of predictive word types do cover
93.4% of the tweets.

6 Conclusion

In this study we developed and tested a system that
detects sarcastic tweets in a realistic sample of 3.3
million Dutch tweets posted on a single day, trained
on a set of nearly 78 thousand tweets, harvested
over time, marked by the hashmark #sarcasme by
the senders. The classifier is able to correctly detect
101 of the 135 tweets among the 3.3 million that
were explicitly marked with the hashtag, with the
hashtag removed. Testing the classifier on the top
250 of the tweets it ranked as most likely to be sar-
castic, it attains only a 30% average precision. We
can conclude that it is fairly hard to distinguish sar-
castic tweets from literal tweets in an open setting,
though the top of the classifier’s ranking does iden-
tify many sarcastic tweets which were not explicitly
marked with a hashtag.

An additional linguistic analysis provides some
insights into the characteristics of sarcasm on Twit-
ter. We found that most tweets contain a literally

34



positive message, take common teenager topics as
target (school, homework, family life) and further
contain three types of words: explicit markers (the
word sarcasme and pseudo-synonyms, with or with-
out the hashmark #), intensifiers, and exclamations.
The latter two categories of words induce hyper-
bole, but together they only occur in about 60%
of sarcastic tweets; in 34% of the cases, sarcastic
tweets are not hyperbolic, but only have an explicit
marker, most of which hashtags. This indicates that
the hashtag can and does replace linguistic markers
that otherwise would be needed to mark sarcasm.
Arguably, extralinguistic elements such as hashtags
can be seen as the social media equivalent of non-
verbal expressions that people employ in live inter-
action when conveying sarcasm. As Burgers (2010)
show, the more explicit markers an ironic utterance
contains, the better the utterance is understood, the
less its perceived complexity is, and the better it is
rated. Many Twitter users already seem to apply this
knowledge.

Although in this research we focused on the
Dutch language, our findings may also apply to lan-
guages similar to Dutch, such as English and Ger-
man. Future research would be needed to chart the
prediction of sarcasm in languages that are more dis-
tant to Dutch. Sarcasm may be used differently in
other cultures (Goddard, 2006). Languages may use
the same type of marker in different ways, such as
a different intonation in spoken sarcasm by English
and Cantonese speakers (Cheang and Pell, 2009).
Such a difference between languages in the use of
the same marker may also apply to written sarcastic
utterances.

Another strand of future research would be to ex-
pand our scope from sarcasm to other more sub-
tle variants of irony, such as understatements, eu-
phemisms, and litotes. Based on Giora et al. (2005),
there seems to be a spectrum of degrees of irony
from the sarcastic ‘Max is exceptionally bright’ via
the ironic ‘Max is not exceptionally bright’, the un-
derstatement ‘Max is not bright’ to the literal ‘Max
is stupid’. In those utterances, there is a gap between
what is literally said and the intended meaning of the
sender. The greater the gap or contrast, the easier it
is to perceive the irony. But the negated not bright
is still perceived as ironic; more ironic than the lit-
eral utterance (Giora et al., 2005). We may need to

combine the sarcasm detection task with the prob-
lem of the detection of negation and hedging mark-
ers and their scope (Morante et al., 2008; Morante
and Daelemans, 2009) in order to arrive at a compre-
hensive account of polarity-reversing mechanisms,
which in sentiment analysis is still highly desirable.
