Abstract

Recommendation dialog systems help
users navigate e-commerce listings by ask-
ing questions about users’ preferences to-
ward relevant domain attributes. We
present a framework for generating and
ranking fine-grained, highly relevant ques-
tions from user-generated reviews. We
demonstrate our approach on a new dataset
just released by Yelp, and release a new
sentiment lexicon with 1329 adjectives for
the restaurant domain.

1 Introduction

Recommendation dialog systems have been devel-
oped for a number of tasks ranging from product
search to restaurant recommendation (Chai et al.,
2002; Thompson et al., 2004; Bridge et al., 2005;
Young et al., 2010). These systems learn user re-
quirements through spoken or text-based dialog,
asking questions about particular attributes to fil-
ter the space of relevant documents.

Traditionally, these systems draw questions
from a small, fixed set of attributes, such as cuisine
or price in the restaurant domain. However, these
systems overlook an important element in users’
interactions with online product listings: user-
generated reviews. Huang et al. (2012) show that
information extracted from user reviews greatly
improves user experience in visual search inter-
faces. In this paper, we present a dialog-based in-
terface that takes advantage of review texts. We
demonstrate our system on a new challenge cor-
pus of 11,537 businesses and 229,907 user reviews
released by the popular review website Yelp1, fo-
cusing on the dataset’s 4724 restaurants and bars
(164,106 reviews).

This paper makes two main contributions. First,
we describe and qualitatively evaluate a frame-

work for generating new, highly-relevant ques-
tions from user review texts. The framework
makes use of techniques from topic modeling and
sentiment-based aspect extraction to identify fine-
grained attributes for each business. These at-
tributes form the basis of a new set of questions
that the system can ask the user.

Second, we use a method based on information-
gain for dynamically ranking candidate questions
during dialog production. This allows our system
to select the most informative question at each di-
alog step. An evaluation based on simulated di-
alogs shows that both the ranking method and the
automatically generated questions improve recall.

2 Generating Questions from Reviews

2.1 Subcategory Questions

Yelp provides each business with category labels
for top-level cuisine types like Japanese, Coffee
& Tea, and Vegetarian. Many of these top-level
categories have natural subcategories (e.g., ramen
vs. sushi). By identifying these subcategories, we
enable questions which probe one step deeper than
the top-level category label.

To identify these subcategories, we run Latent
Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) on
the reviews of each set of businesses in the twenty
most common top-level categories, using 10 top-
ics and concatenating all of a business’s reviews
into one document.2 Several researchers have used
sentence-level documents to model topics in re-
views, but these tend to generate topics about fine-
grained aspects of the sort we discuss in Section
2.2 (Jo and Oh, 2011; Brody and Elhadad, 2010).
We then manually labeled the topics, discarding
junk topics and merging similar topics. Table 1
displays sample extracted subcategories.

Using these topic models, we assign a business

to a subcategory based on the topic with high-
est probability in that business’s topic distribution.
Finally, we use these subcategory topics to gen-
erate questions for our recommender dialog sys-
tem. Each top-level category corresponds to a sin-
gle question whose potential answers are the set of
subcategories: e.g., “What type of Japanese cui-
sine do you want?”

2.2 Questions from Fine-Grained Aspects

Our second source for questions is based on as-
pect extraction in sentiment summarization (Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2008; Brody and Elhadad,
2010). We define an aspect as any noun-phrase
which is targeted by a sentiment predicate. For
example, from the sentence “The place had great
atmosphere, but the service was slow.” we ex-
tract two aspects: +atmosphere and –service.

Our aspect extraction system has two steps.
First we develop a domain specific sentiment lex-
icon. Second, we apply syntactic patterns to iden-
tify NPs targeted by these sentiment predicates.

2.2.1 Sentiment Lexicon
Coordination Graph We generate a list of
domain-specific sentiment adjectives using graph
propagation. We begin with a seed set combin-
ing PARADIGM+ (Jo and Oh, 2011) with ‘strongly
subjective’ adjectives from the OpinionFinder lex-
icon (Wilson et al., 2005), yielding 1342 seeds.
Like Brody and Elhadad (2010), we then construct
a coordination graph that links adjectives modify-
ing the same noun, but to increase precision we

require that the adjectives also be conjoined by
and (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997). This
reduces problems like propagating positive sen-
timent to orange in good orange chicken. We
marked adjectives that follow too or lie in the
scope of negation with special prefixes and treated
them as distinct lexical entries.

Sentiment Propagation Negative and positive
seeds are assigned values of 0 and 1 respectively.
All other adjectives begin at 0.5. Then a stan-
dard propagation update is computed iteratively
(see Eq. 3 of Brody and Elhadad (2010)).

In Brody and Elhadad’s implementation of this
propagation method, seed sentiment values are
fixed, and the update step is repeated until the non-
seed values converge. We found that three modifi-
cations significantly improved precision. First, we
omit candidate nodes that don’t link to at least two
positive or two negative seeds. This eliminated
spurious propagation caused by one-off parsing er-
rors. Second, we run the propagation algorithm for
fewer iterations (two iterations for negative terms
and one for positive terms). We found that addi-
tional iterations led to significant error propaga-
tion when neutral (italian) or ambiguous (thick)
terms were assigned sentiment.3 Third, we update
both non-seed and seed adjectives. This allows us
to learn, for example, that the negative seed deca-
dent is positive in the restaurant domain.

Table 2 shows a sample of sentiment adjectives
3Our results are consistent with the recent finding of Whit-

ney and Sarkar (2012) that cautious systems are better when
bootstrapping from seeds.

Negative Sentiment
institutional, underwhelming, not nice, burn-
tish, unidentifiable, inefficient, not attentive,
grotesque, confused, trashy, insufferable,
grandiose, not pleasant, timid, degrading,
laughable, under-seasoned, dismayed, torn
Positive Sentiment
decadent, satisfied, lovely, stupendous,
sizable, nutritious, intense, peaceful,
not expensive, elegant, rustic, fast, affordable,
efficient, congenial, rich, not too heavy,
wholesome, bustling, lush

Table 2: Sample of Learned Sentiment Adjectives

derived by this graph propagation method. The
final lexicon has 1329 adjectives4, including 853
terms not in the original seed set. The lexicon is
available for download.5

Evaluative Verbs In addition to this adjective
lexicon, we take 56 evaluative verbs such as love
and hate from admire-class VerbNet predicates
(Kipper-Schuler, 2005).

2.2.2 Extraction Patterns

To identify noun-phrases which are targeted by
predicates in our sentiment lexicon, we develop
hand-crafted extraction patterns defined over syn-
tactic dependency parses (Blair-Goldensohn et al.,
2008; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) generated
by the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).
Table 3 shows a sample of the aspects generated by
these methods.

Adj + NP It is common practice to extract any
NP modified by a sentiment adjective. However,
this simple extraction rule suffers from precision
problems. First, reviews often contain sentiment
toward irrelevant, non-business targets (Wayne is
the target of excellent job in (1)). Second, hypo-
thetical contexts lead to spurious extractions. In
(2), the extraction +service is clearly wrong–in
fact, the opposite sentiment is being expressed.

(1) Wayne did an excellent job addressing our
needs and giving us our options.

(2) Nice and airy atmosphere, but service could be
more attentive at times.

4We manually removed 26 spurious terms which were
caused by parsing errors or propagation to a neutral term.

5http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/
yelp.shtml

We address these problems by filtering out sen-
tences in hypothetical contexts cued by if, should,
could, or a question mark, and by adopting the fol-
lowing, more conservative extractions rules:

i) [BIZ + have + adj. + NP] Sentiment adjec-
tive modifies NP, main verb is have, subject
is business name, it, they, place, or absent.
(E.g., This place has some really great yogurt
and toppings).

ii) [NP + be + adj.] Sentiment adjective linked
to NP by be—e.g., Our pizza was much too
jalapeno-y.

“Good For” + NP Next, we extract aspects us-
ing the pattern BIZ + positive adj. + for + NP, as in
It’s perfect for a date night. Examples of extracted
aspects include +lunch, +large groups, +drinks,
and +quick lunch.

Verb + NP Finally, we extract NPs that appear
as direct object to one of our evaluative verbs (e.g.,
We loved the fried chicken).

2.2.3 Aspects as Questions
We generate questions from these extracted as-
pects using simple templates. For example, the as-
pect +burritos yields the question: Do you want a
place with good burritos?

3 Question Selection for Dialog

To utilize the questions generated from reviews in
recommendation dialogs, we first formalize the di-
alog optimization task and then offer a solution.

3.1 Problem Statement

We consider a version of the Information Retrieval
Dialog task introduced by Kopeček (1999). Busi-
nesses b ∈ B have associated attributes, coming
from a set Att. These attributes are a combination
of Yelp categories and our automatically extracted
aspects described in Section 2. Attributes att ∈ Att
take values in a finite domain dom(att). We denote
the subset of businesses with an attribute att tak-
ing value val ∈ dom(att), as B|att=val. Attributes
are functions from businesses to subsets of values:
att : B → P(dom(att)). We model a user in-
formation need I as a set of attribute/value pairs:
I = {(att1, val1), . . . , (att|I|, val|I|)}.

Given a set of businesses and attributes, a rec-
ommendation agent π selects an attribute to ask

501



Chinese: Mexican:
+beef +egg roll +sour soup +orange chicken +salsa bar +burritos +fish tacos +guacamole
+noodles +crab puff +egg drop soup +enchiladas +hot sauce +carne asade +breakfast burritos
+dim sum +fried rice +honey chicken +horchata +green salsa +tortillas +quesadillas

Japanese: American (New)
+rolls +sushi rolls +wasabi +sushi bar +salmon +environment +drink menu +bar area +cocktails +brunch
+chicken katsu +crunch +green tea +sake selection +hummus +mac and cheese +outdoor patio +seating area
+oysters +drink menu +sushi selection +quality +lighting +brews +sangria +cheese plates

Select an attribute: att = π(B,H)

Restrict set of businesses: B = B|att=val
Append answer: H = H ∪ {(att, val)}

end
Return (H,B)

mendation agent

the user about, then uses the answer value to nar-
row the set of businesses to those with the de-
sired attribute value, and selects another query.
Algorithm 1 presents this process more formally.
The recommendation agent can use both the set of
businesses B and the history of question and an-
swers H from the user to select the next query.
Thus, formally a recommendation agent is a func-
tion π : B × H → Att. The dialog ends after a
fixed number of queries K.

3.2 Information Gain Agent

The information gain recommendation agent
chooses questions to ask the user by selecting
question attributes that maximize the entropy of
the resulting document set, in a manner similar to
decision tree learning (Mitchell, 1997). Formally,
we define a function infogain : Att× P(B)→ R:

infogain(att, B) =

−
∑

vals∈P(dom(att))

|Batt=vals|
|B| log

|Batt=vals|
|B|

The agent then selects questions att ∈ Att that
maximize the information gain with respect to the

set of businesses satisfying the dialog history H:
π(B,H) = argmax

att∈Att
infogain(att, B|H)

4 Evaluation

4.1 Experimental Setup

We follow the standard approach of using the at-
tributes of an individual business as a simulation
of a user’s preferences (Chung, 2004; Young et al.,
2010). For every business b ∈ B we form an in-
formation need composed of all of b’s attributes:

Ib =
⋃

{att∈Att|att(b)6=∅}
(att, att(b))

To evaluate a recommendation agent, we use
the recall metric, which measures how well an in-
formation need is satisfied. For each information
need I , let BI be the set of businesses that satisfy
the questions of an agent. We define the recall of
the set of businesses with respect to the informa-
tion need as

recall(BI , I) =

∑
b∈BI

∑
(att,val)∈I 1[val ∈ att(b)]
|BI ||I|

We average recall across all information needs,
yielding average recall.

We compare against a random agent baseline
that selects attributes att ∈ Att uniformly at ran-
dom at each time step. Other recommendation di-
alog systems such as Young et al. (2010) select
questions from a small fixed hierarchy, which is
not applicable to our large set of attributes.

4.2 Results

Figure 1 shows the average recall for the ran-
dom agent versus the information gain agent with
varying sets of attributes. ‘Top-level’ repeatedly
queries the user’s top-level category preferences,
‘Subtopic’ additionally uses our topic modeling
subcategories, and ‘All’ uses these plus the as-
pects extracted from reviews. We see that for suf-
ficiently long dialogs, ‘All’ outperforms the other
systems. The ‘Subtopic’ and ‘Top-level’ systems
plateau after a few dialog steps once they’ve asked

all useful questions. For instance, most businesses
only have one or two top-level categories, so af-
ter the system has identified the top-level cate-
gory that the user is interested in, it has no more
good questions to ask. Note that the information
gain agent starts dialogs with the top-level and ap-
propriate subcategory questions, so it is only for
longer dialogs that the fine-grained aspects boost
performance.

5 Conclusion

We presented a system for extracting large sets
of attributes from user reviews and selecting rel-
evant attributes to ask questions about. Using
topic models to discover subtypes of businesses, a
domain-specific sentiment lexicon, and a number
of new techniques for increasing precision in sen-
timent aspect extraction yields attributes that give
a rich representation of the restaurant domain. We
have made this 1329-term sentiment lexicon for
the restaurant domain available as useful resource
to the community. Our information gain recom-
mendation agent gives a principled way to dynam-
ically combine these diverse attributes to ask rele-
vant questions in a coherent dialog. Our approach
thus offers a new way to integrate the advantages
of the curated hand-build attributes used in statisti-
cal slot and filler dialog systems, and the distribu-
tionally induced, highly relevant categories built
by sentiment aspect extraction systems.
