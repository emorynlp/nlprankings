Abstract

In this paper, we propose a review se-
lection approach towards accurate esti-
mation of feature ratings for services on
participatory websites where users write
textual reviews for these services. Our
approach selects reviews that compre-
hensively talk about a feature of a service
by using information distance of the re-
views on the feature. The rating estima-
tion of the feature for these selected re-
views using machine learning techniques
provides more accurate results than that
for other reviews. The average of these
estimated feature ratings also better rep-
resents an accurate overall rating for the
feature of the service, which provides
useful feedback for other users to choose
their satisfactory services.

1 Introduction
Most of participatory websites such as Amazon
(amazon.com) do not collect from users feature1
ratings for services, simply because it may cost
users too much effort to provide detailed feature
ratings. Even for a very few websites that do col-
lect feature ratings such as a popular travel web-
site TripAdvisor (tripadvisor.com), a big portion
(approximately 43%) of users may still not pro-
vide them. However, feature ratings are useful
for users to make informed consumption deci-
sions especially in the case where users may be
interested more in some particular features of the
services. Machine learning techniques have been
proposed for sentiment classiﬁcation (Pang et al.,
2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004) based on anno-
tated samples from experts, but they have limited

service.

performance especially when estimating ratings
of a multi-point scale (Pang and Lee, 2005).

In this paper, we propose a novel review se-
lection approach for accurate feature rating es-
timation. More speciﬁcally, our approach se-
lects reviews written by the users who compre-
hensively talk about a certain feature of a ser-
vice - that are comprehensive on this feature, us-
ing information distance of reviews on the fea-
ture based on Kolmogorov complexity (Li and
Vit´anyi, 1997). This feature is obviously impor-
tant to the users. People tend to be more knowl-
edgable in the aspects they consider important.
These users therefore represent a subset of ex-
perts. Statistical analysis reveals that these ex-
pert users are more likely to agree on a common
rating for the feature of the service. The rating
estimation of the feature for these selected re-
views based on annotated samples from experts
using machine learning techniques is thus able to
provide more accurate results than that for other
reviews. This statistical evidence also allows us
to use the average of the estimated feature rat-
ings to better represent an overall opinion of ex-
perts for the feature of the service, which will
be particularly useful for assisting other users to
correctly make their consumption decisions.

We verify our approach and arguments based
on real data collected from the TripAdvisor web-
site. First, our approach is shown to be able to
effectively select reviews that comprehensively
talk about features of a service. We then adopt
the machine learning method proposed in (Pang
and Lee, 2005) and the Bayesian Network clas-
siﬁer (Russell and Norvig, 2002) for feature rat-
ing estimation. Our experimental results show
that the accuracy of estimating feature ratings
for these selected reviews is higher than that
for other reviews, for both the machine learning

767

methods. And, the average of these estimated
ratings is testiﬁed to closely represent the over-
all feature rating of the service. Our approach is
therefore veriﬁed to be a successful step towards
accurate feature rating estimation.

2 Related Work

Our work aims at estimating feature ratings of a
service based on its textual reviews. It is related
to sentiment classiﬁcation. The task of sentiment
classiﬁcation is to determine the semantic orien-
tations of words, sentences or documents. (Pang
et al., 2002) is the earliest work of automatic
sentiment classiﬁcation at document level, using
several machine learning approaches with com-
mon textual features to classify movie reviews.
Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004)
integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors
and some syntactic relations into the features of
SVM. Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2004) pro-
posed another machine learning method based
on subjectivity detection and minimum-cut in
graph. However, these approaches focus only on
binary classiﬁcation of reviews.

In 2005, Pang and Lee extended their ear-
lier work in (Pang and Lee, 2004) to determine
a reviewer’s evaluation with respect to multi-
scales (Pang and Lee, 2005). The rating esti-
mation is viewed as multi-class sentiment cate-
gorization on documents. They used SVM re-
gression as the multi-class classiﬁer, and also ap-
plied a meta-algorithm based on a metric label-
ing formulation of the problem, which alters a
given n-ary classiﬁer’s output in an explicit at-
tempt to ensure that similar items receive sim-
ilar labels. They collected movie reviews from
a website named IMDB and tested the perfor-
mance of their classiﬁer under both four-class
and ﬁve-class categorization. The ﬁve-class sen-
timent classiﬁcation is adopted in the evaluation
of our method (see Section 5). The performance
of their approach is limited. One important rea-
son is that their method considers every review
when estimating a feature rating of a movie.
However, some reviews do not contain much of
the users’ opinions about a certain feature sim-
ply because the users do not care much or are

not knowledgable about the feature. In our work,
we study the characteristics of reviews’ feature
ratings. We investigate which reviews are more
useful for us to estimate feature ratings. From
some observations stated in the next section, we
will see that reviews written by different users
reﬂect their own preferred features of a service.

3 Accurate Feature Rating Estimation

Participatory websites allow users to write tex-
tual reviews to discuss features of services that
they have consumed. These reviews usually con-
tain words that strongly express the users’ opin-
ions about the corresponding features. These
words contain important information for estimat-
ing a numerical rating for the feature. The es-
timated ratings can be used for assisting other
users when they need to choose which services
to consume. Machine learning techniques are
often used for training a learner based on an-
notated samples from experts and estimating a
rating for a feature discussed in a review. How-
ever, for a review that does not mention a fea-
ture or discusses it only in a limited sense, the
estimation accuracy is expected to be very low.
Besides, the opinion expressed by the user who
writes this kind of review is not representative
because this user obviously does not care much
about the feature. We believe that if we carefully
select reviews for estimating feature ratings, the
accuracy will be increased and the estimated rat-
ings will be more representative.

We then statistically analyze real data col-
lected from the TripAdvisor website. The results
reveal that users who comprehensively discuss
a feature of a service in their reviews are more
likely to agree on a common rating for this fea-
ture of the service. This phenomenon can also
be intuitively explained as follows. For the users
who comprehensively discuss about a feature,
the feature is obviously more important to them.
People tend to be more knowledgable in the as-
pects they consider important. These users there-
fore represent a subset of experts. Experts likely
provide more objective and representative feed-
back about the feature, and therefore the ratings
from them for the feature contain less noise and

768

are more similar.

Based on the above discussion that experts
tend to have similar opinions on a feature of a
service, a learner trained by a machine learning
technique based on annotated samples from ex-
perts should then be able to more accurately esti-
mate the feature ratings from reviews written by
other experts. Since the opinions of experts con-
verge, the average of the estimated feature rat-
ings also better represents an overall rating for
the feature of the service.

We propose a review selection approach us-
ing information distance of reviews on the fea-
ture based on Kolmogorov complexity, to select
reviews that comprehensively discuss a feature
of a service. We rank the reviews based on the
comprehensiveness on the feature. The top re-
views will be selected for the estimation of fea-
ture ratings. Also, the average of these estimated
feature ratings will be used for representing the
overall rating for the feature. Next, we will ﬁrst
describe in detail how our approach selects com-
prehensive reviews on a given feature.

4 Our Review Selection Approach

Our review selection approach selects reviews
that comprehensively talk about a feature. Ac-
cording to this deﬁnition, a review’s comprehen-
siveness depends on the amount of information
discussed on a feature. We use Kolmogorov
complexity and information distance to measure
the amount of information. Kolmogorov com-
plexity was introduced almost half a century ago
by R. Solomonoff, A.N. Kolmogorov and G.
Chaitin, see (Li and Vit´anyi, 1997).
It is now
widely accepted as an information theory for in-
dividual objects parallel to that of Shannon’s in-
formation theory which is deﬁned on an ensem-
ble of objects.

4.1 Theory
Fix a universal Turing machine U. The Kol-
mogorov complexity (Li and Vit´anyi, 1997) of a
binary string x condition to another binary string
y, KU (x|y), is the length of the shortest (preﬁx-
free) program for U that outputs x with input y.
It can be shown that for different universal Tur-

ing machine U0, for all x, y

KU (x|y) = KU0(x|y) + C,

where the constant C depends only on U0. Thus
KU (x|y) can be simply written as K(x|y). They
write K(x|), where  is the empty string, as
K(x).
It has also been deﬁned in (Bennett et
al., 1998) that the energy to convert between x
and y to be the smallest number of bits needed to
convert from x to y and vice versa. That is, with
respect to a universal Turing machine U, the cost
of conversion between x and y is:
E(x, y)=min{|p|: U (x, p)=y, U (y, p)=x}(1)
It is clear that E(x, y) ≤ K(x|y) + K(y|x).
From this observation, the following theorem has
been proved in (Bennett et al., 1998):
Theorem 1 E(x, y) = max{K(x|y), K(y|x)}.
Thus, the max distance was deﬁned in (Ben-
nett et al., 1998):

Dmax(x, y) = max{K(x|y), K(y|x)}.

(2)

This distance is shown to satisfy the basic
distance requirements such as positivity, sym-
metricity, triangle inequality and is admissible.

Here for an object x, we can measure its in-
formation by Kolmogorov complexity K(x); for
two objects x and y, their shared information can
be measured by information distance D(x, y).
In (Long et al., 2008), the authors generalize
the theory of information distance to more than
two objects. Similar to Equation 1, given strings
x1, . . . , xn, they deﬁne the minimum amount of
thermodynamic energy needed to convert from
any xi to any xj as:
Em(x1, .., xn)=min{|p|:U (xi, p, j)=xj for all i,j}

Then it is proved in (Long et al., 2008) that:

Theorem 2 Modulo to an O(log n) additive fac-
tor,

min

i

K(x1 . . . xn|xi) ≤ Em(x1, . . . , xn)

Given n objects, the left-hand side of Equa-
tion 3 may be interpreted as the most compre-
hensive object that contains the most information
about all of the others.

769

4.2 Review Selection Method
Our review selection method is based on the in-
formation distance discussed in the previous sec-
tion. However, our problem is that neither the
Kolmogorov complexity K(·,·) nor Dmax(·,·)
is computable. Therefore, we ﬁnd a way to “ap-
proximate” these two measures. The most use-
ful information in a review article is the English
words that are related to the features. If we can
extract all of these related words from the review
articles, the size of the word set can be regarded
as a rough estimation of information content (or
Kolmogorov complexity) of the review articles.
In Section 5 we will see that this gives very good
practical results.

4.2.1 Outline

Our method is outlined in the following. First,
for each type of product or service (such as a ho-
tel), a small set of core feature words (such as
price and room) is generated through statistics.
Then, these feature words are used to generate
the expanded words. Third, a parser is used to
ﬁnd the dependent words associated with the oc-
currence of the core feature words and expanded
words in a review. For each review-feature pair,
the union of the core feature words, expanded
words and dependent words in the review deﬁnes
the related word set of the review on the feature.
Lastly, information distance is used to select the
most comprehensive reviews on a feature.

4.2.2 Word Extraction

Feature words are the most direct and frequent
words describing a feature, for example, price,
room or service of a hotel. Given a feature, the
core feature words are the very few most com-
mon English words that are used to refer to that
feature. For example, both “value” and “price”
are used to refer to the same feature of a ho-
tel. In (Hu and Liu, 2004), the authors indicate
that when customers comment on product fea-
tures, the words they use converge.
If we re-
move the feature words with frequency lower
than 1% of the total frequency of all feature
words, the remaining words, which are just core
feature words, can still cover more than 90%
occurrences. So ﬁrstly we extract those words

through statistics; then some of those with the
same meaning (such as “value” and “price”) are
grouped into one feature. They are just “core fea-
ture words”.

Apart from core feature words, many other
less-frequently used words that are connected
to the feature also contribute to the information
content of the feature. For example, “price” is
an important feature of a hotel, but the word
“price” is usually dropped from a sentence. In-
stead, words such as “$”, “dollars”, “USD”, and
“CAD” are used. We use information distance
d(., .) based on Google to expand words (Cili-
brasi and Vit´anyi, 2007). Let α be a feature and
A be the set of its core feature words. The dis-
tance between a word w and the feature α is then
deﬁned to be

d(w, α) = min
v∈A

d(w, v)

A distance threshold is then used to determine
which words should be in the set of expanded
words for a given feature.

If a core feature word or an expanded word is
found in a sentence, the words which have gram-
matical dependent relationship with it are called
the dependent words (de Marneffe et al., 2006).
For example, in sentence “It has a small, but
beautiful room”, the words “small” and “beauti-
ful” are both dependent words of the core feature
word “room”. All these words also contribute to
the reviews and are important to determine the
reviewer’s attitude towards a feature.

The Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006)
is used to parse each review. For review i and
feature j, the core feature words and expanded
words in the review are ﬁrst computed. Then the
parsing result is examined to ﬁnd all the depen-
dent words for the core feature words and ex-
panded words, all of which are called “related
words”.

4.2.3 Computing Information Distance

If there are m reviews x1, x2, . . . , xm, n fea-
tures u1, u2, . . . , un, and the related word set Si
is deﬁned to be the union of all the related words
that occur in the review xi. From the left-hand
side of Equation 3, the most comprehensive xi

770

on feature uk is such that

i = arg min

i

K(S1 . . . Sn|Si, uk).

(3)

Let Si and Sj be two sets of words,

K(SiSj|uk) = K(Si ∪ Sj|uk),
K(Si|Sj, uk) = K(Si \ Sj|uk),

and

(K(w, uk)−K(uk))

K(w|uk)≈Xw

K(Si|uk)=Xw
where w ∈ Si and w is in xi’s related word set on
feature uk. For each word w in a set S, the Kol-
mogorov complexity can be estimated through
coding theorem (Li and Vit´anyi, 1997):

K(w, uk)=− logP (w, uk), K(uk)=− logP (uk)
where P (w, uk) can be estimated by df (w, uk),
which is the document frequency of word w and
feature uk co-exist on the whole corpus. Sim-
ilarly, P (uk) can be estimated by feature uk’s
document frequency on the corpus. In the next
section, Equation 3 will be used to select reviews
that comprehensively talk about a feature.

5 Experimental Veriﬁcation
In this section, we present a set of experimen-
tal results to support our work. Our experiments
are carried out using real data collected from the
travel website TripAdvisor. This website indexes
hotels from cities across the world.
It collects
feedback from travelers. Feedback of each trav-
eler consists of a textual review written by the
traveler and numerical ratings (from 1, lowest,
to 5, highest) for different features of hotels (e.g.,
value, service, rooms).

We crawled this website to collect travelers’
feedback for hotels in three cities: Boston, Syd-
ney and Las Vegas. Note that during this crawl-
ing process, we carefully removed information
about travelers and hotels to protect their privacy.
For users’ feedback, we recorded only the tex-
tual reviews and the numerical ratings on four
features: Value(V), Rooms(R), Service(S) and
Cleanliness(C). These features are rated by a sig-
niﬁcant number of users. Table 1 summarizes
our data set. For each one of the cities, this table
contains information about the number of hotels,
the total amount of feedback and the amount of
feedback with feature ratings. In general, each
hotel has sufﬁcient amount of feedback with fea-
ture ratings for us to evaluate our work.

5.1 Evaluation of Review Selection
We ﬁrst evaluate the performance of our re-
view selection approach using manually anno-
tated data. More speciﬁcally, in our data set,
for one city, 40 reviews (120 reviews in total)
are selected for manual annotation. The annota-
tor looks over each review and decides whether
the review is comprehensive on a given feature.
Comprehensive reviews on the feature are anno-
tated as “Y”, and the reviews that are not com-
prehensive on this feature are annotated as “N”.
For the review set of each city, the number of re-
views annotated as comprehensive is equal to or
less than 20% of the total number of the selected
reviews for this city (eight in this experiment).
Note that it is possible that one review can be
comprehensive on more than one features.

We then use our review selection approach

771

discussed in Section 4 to rank the reviews for ho-
tels in each city, according to their comprehen-
siveness on each feature. For example, the most
comprehensive review on the feature “Value”,
which has the minimal information distance to
this feature (see Equation 3), is ranked No.1. Ta-
ble 2 shows the annotated reviews for Boston ho-
tels that are ranked on top six on each feature. It
can be obviously seen from the table that most
of these top reviews are labeled as comprehen-
sive reviews on respective features. Our com-
prehensive review selection approach generally
performs well.

To clearly present the performance of our
comprehensive review selection approach, we
use the measures of precision, recall and f-score.
The measure f-score is a single value that can
represent the result of our evaluation. It is the
harmonic mean of precision and recall. Suppose
there are n reviews in total. Let pjk (1 ≤ k ≤ n)
be the review ranked the kth comprehensive on
feature j. Deﬁne

zjk =‰ 1 if pjk is labelled comprehensive on j;

0 otherwise.

The precision P , recall R, and f-score F of top k
comprehensive reviews on feature j are formal-
ized as follows

Pjk = Pk

l=1 zjl

, Rjk = Pk
PN

,

Fjk =

2PjkRjk
Pjk + Rjk

For each ranked review set on feature j, the
maximum Fjk and its associated Pjk and Rjk are
listed in Table 3. From this table, it can be seen
that for the best f-scores, the precision and recall
values are mostly larger than 70%, that is, a great
part of reviews that are labeled as comprehensive
receive top rankings from our comprehensive re-
view selection approach. Our approach is thus
carefully veriﬁed to be able to accurately select
comprehensive reviews on any given feature.

5.2 Statistical Analysis
A group of users who comprehensively discuss
a certain feature are more likely to agree on a
common rating for that feature. In this experi-
ment, we use our review selection approach to
verify this argument.

More speciﬁcally, for each city, hotels that re-
ceive no less than 10 reviews with feature ratings
are selected. We use our comprehensive review
selection approach to select top 20% and 50%
comprehensive reviews on each feature for ho-
tels in each city. We calculate the standard devi-
ation of their feature ratings, as well as that of all
feature ratings, for each hotel in a city. We then
average these standard deviations over the hotels
in the same city. The average values are listed
in Table 4. The feature ratings of comprehensive
reviews on the feature have smaller average stan-

772

dard deviations. Standard T-test is used to mea-
sure the signiﬁcance of the results between top
20% comprehensive reviews and all reviews, city
by city and feature by feature. Their p-values are
shown in the braces, and they are signiﬁcant at
the standard 0.05 signiﬁcance threshold. It can
be seen from the table that although for some
items there does not seem to be a signiﬁcant dif-
ference, the results are signiﬁcant for the entire
data set.

Therefore, when these travelers write reviews
that are comprehensive on one feature, their rat-
ings for this feature tend to converge. This evi-
dence indicates that the estimation of ratings for
the feature from these comprehensive reviews
can provide better results, which will be con-
ﬁrmed in Section 5.3. These estimated feature
ratings can also be averaged to represent a spe-
ciﬁc opinion of these travelers on the feature,
which will be veriﬁed in Section 5.4.

5.3 Feature Rating Estimation
In this section, we carry out experiments to tes-
tify that the estimation of feature ratings for com-
prehensive reviews using our review selection
approach provides better performance than that
for all reviews. We adopt the approach of Pang
and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2005) described in Sec-
tion 2 for feature rating estimation. In short, they
applied a meta-algorithm, based on a metric la-
beling formulation of the problem to alter a given
n-ary SVM’s output in an explicit attempt. We
also adopt a Baysian Network classiﬁer for fea-
ture rating estimation.

Similar to the method of Pang and Lee, we
build up a feature rating classiﬁcation system to
estimate reviews’ feature ratings. However, the
method of Pang and Lee focuses only on sin-
gle rating classiﬁcation for a review and assumes
that every word of the review can contribute to
this single rating. While it comes to feature rat-
ing classiﬁcation, the system has to decide which
terms or phrases in the review are talking about
this feature. We train a Naive Bayes classiﬁer
to retrieve all the sentences related to a feature.
Then all the core feature words, expanded words
and dependent words are extracted to train a
SVM classiﬁer and the Bayesian Network clas-

siﬁer for ﬁve-class classiﬁcation (1 to 5). The
eight-fold cross-validation is used to train and
test the performance of feature rating estimation
on all the reviews and the top 20% comprehen-
sive reviews, respectively.

Figure 1: Average Error of Feature Rating Esti-
mation for the Adopted Method of Pang and Lee

Figure 2: Average Error of Feature Rating Esti-
mation for the Bayesian Network classiﬁer

We formalize a performance measure as fol-
lows. Suppose there are n reviews in total. For a
test review i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), its real feature rating
(given by the review writer) is fi, and its predi-
cated feature rating (predicted by our classiﬁca-
tion system) is gi. Both fi and gi are integers
between 1 and 5. The performance of the classi-
ﬁcation on all n reviews can be measured by the
average of the absolute difference (d) between
each fi and gi pair,

d = Pn

i=1 |fi − gi|

n

.

(4)

The lower d is, the better performance the clas-
siﬁer can provide.

mance of feature rating estimation on all reviews

It
can be seen that the average difference between
real feature ratings and estimated feature ratings
on each feature when using selected comprehen-
sive reviews is signiﬁcantly lower than that when
using all reviews, for both the approaches. On
average, the performance of feature rating esti-
mation is improved by more than 12.5% using
our review selection approach. And, our review
selection approach is generally applicable to dif-
ferent classiﬁers.

5.4 Estimating Overall Feature Rating
Supported by the statistical evidence veriﬁed in
Section 5.2 that the users who write compre-
hensive reviews on one feature will more likely
agree on a common rating for this feature, we
can then use an average of the feature ratings for
top 20% comprehensive reviews to reﬂect a gen-
eral opinion of knowledgable/expert users.
In
this section, we show directly the performance
of estimating an overall feature rating for a ho-
tel using ratings for the selected comprehensive
reviews, and compare it with that for all reviews.

Suppose there are m hotels. For each hotel
j, we ﬁrst select the top 20% comprehensive re-
views on each feature using our review selection
approach. We average the real ratings of one fea-

ture provide by travelers for these reviews, de-
noted as ¯fj. We then estimate the feature rat-
ings for these comprehensive reviews using the
adopted machine learning method of Pang and
Lee. The average of these estimated ratings is
denoted as ¯gj. Similar to Equation 4, the av-
erage difference between all ¯fj and ¯gj pairs on
each feature for hotels in each city are calculated
and listed in Table 5. From this table, we can
see that the average difference between the es-
timated average feature rating and real average
feature rating is only about 0.53. Our review
selection approach produces fairly good perfor-
mance for estimating an overall feature rating for
a hotel. We then also calculate the average dif-
ference for all reviews. The results are listed in
Table 6. We can see that the average difference
is larger (about 0.69) in this case. The perfor-
mance of estimating an overall feature rating is
increased by nearly 23.2% through our review
selection approach.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a novel review selec-
tion approach to improve the accuracy of feature
rating estimation. We select reviews that com-
prehensively talk about a feature of one service,
using information distance of reviews on the fea-
ture based on Kolmogorov complexity. As eval-
uated using real data, the rating estimation for
the feature from these reviews provides more ac-
curate results than that for other reviews, inde-
pendent of which classiﬁers are used. The aver-
age of these estimated feature ratings also better
represents an accurate overall rating for the fea-
ture of the service.

In future work, we will further improve the ac-
curacy of estimating a general rating for a feature
of a service based on the selected comprehensive
reviews on this feature using our review selec-
tion approach. Comprehensive reviews may con-
tribute differently to the estimation of an overall
feature rating. In our next step, a more sophisti-
cated model will be developed to assign different
weights to these different reviews.
