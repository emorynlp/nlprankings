Abstract 

This paper describes the specifications and 

results of UMCC_DLSI-(EPS) system, which 

participated in the first Evaluating Phrasal 

Semantics of SemEval-2013. Our supervised 

system uses different kinds of semantic 

features to train a bagging classifier used to 

select the correct similarity option. Related to 

the different features we can highlight the 

resource WordNet used to extract semantic 

relations among words and the use of different 

algorithms to establish semantic similarities. 

Our system obtains promising results with a 

precision value around 78% for the English 

corpus and 71.84% for the Italian corpus. 

1 Introduction 

It is well known finding words similarity, even 

when it is lexical or semantic can improve 

entailment recognition and paraphrase 

identification; and ultimately lead to improvements 

in a wide range of applications in Natural 

Language Processing (NLP). Several areas like 

question answering, query expansion, information 

retrieval, and many others, depend on phrasal 

semantics (PS). PS, is concerned with how the 

meaning of a sentence is composed both from the 

meaning of the constituent words, and from extra 

meaning contained within the structural 

organization of the sentence itself (Dominey, 

2005). 

The aim of SemEval 2013 competition is also 

discovering similarity, specifically in Evaluating 

Phrasal Semantics (EPS). The goal of this task is to 

evaluate how well systems can judge the semantic 

similarity of a word and a short sequence of words. 

That is, given a set of pairs of this type; classify it 

on negative (if the meaning of the word is 

semantically different to the meaning of the 

sequence) or positive (if the meaning of the 

sequence, as a whole, is semantically close to the 

meaning of the word).  

Based on this, we developed a system capable to 

detect if two phrases are semantically close. 

The rest of this paper, specifically section 2 is a 

brief Related Work. Section 3 describes the system 

architecture and our run. Continuing with section 4 

we describe the training phase. Following that, 

section 5 presents the results and discussion for our 

Machine Learning System. Finally we conclude 

and propose our future works (Section 6). 

2 Related Work 

There have been many WordNet-based similarity 

measures, among other highlights the work of 

researchers like (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; 

Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Mihalcea et al., 

2006; Richardson et al., 1994). 

On the other hand, WordNet::Similarity1 

(Pedersen et al., 2004) has been used by other 

researchers in an interesting array of domains. 

WordNet::Similarity implements measures of 

similarity and relatedness between a pair of 

concepts (or synsets2) based on the structure and 

content of WordNet. According to (Pedersen et al., 

2004), three of the six measures of similarity are 

based on the information content of the least

common subsumer (LCS). These measures include 

res (Resnik, 1995), lin (Lin, 1998), and jcn (Jiang 

and Conrath, 1997). 

Pursuant to Pedersen, there are three other 

similarity measures based on path lengths between 

a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow, 

1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. 

Our proposal differs from those of 

WordNet::Similarity and other measures of 

similarity in the way we selected the relevant 

WordNet relations (see section 3.2 for detail). 

Unlike others, our measure assign weight to 

WordNet relations (any we consider relevant) 

depending to the place they occupy in the 

minimum path and the previously visited relations. 

Besides these, the novelty of our approach is 

using the weights as a function of semantic 

relations in a minimal distance path and also the 

method we used to arrive to those weight functions 

or rules. 

3 System Architecture and description of 
the run 

As we can see in Figure 1 our run begin with the 

pre-processing of SemEval 2013’s training set. 

Every sentence pair is tokenized, lemmatized and 

POS-tagged using Freeling 2.2 tool (Atserias et al., 

2006). Afterwards, several methods and algorithms 

are applied in order to extract all features for our 

Machine Learning System (MLS). The system 

trains the classifier using a model based on 

bagging (using JRip3). The training corpus has 

been provided by SemEval-2013 competition, in 

concrete by the EPS task. As a result, we obtain a 

trained model capable to detect if one phrase 

implies other. Finally, we test our system with the 

SemEval 2013 test set (see Table 2 with the results 

of our run). The following section describes the 

features extraction process. 

3.1 Description of the features used in the 

Machine Learning System 

In order to detect entailment between a pair of 

phrases, we developed an algorithm that searches a 

semantic distance, according to WordNet (Miller et 

al., 1990), between each word in the first phrase 

with each one in the second phrase. 

We used four features which intend to measure 

the level of proximity between both sentences: 

                                                      
3 JRip is an inference and rules-based learner. 

 The minimum distance to align the first 
phrase with the second (MinDist). See section 

3.2 for details. 

 The maximal distance to align the first phrase 
with the second (MaxDist). 

 The average of all distances results to align 
the first phrase with the second one. 

(AverageDistance). 

 The absolute relative error of all distances 
results to align the first phrase with the 

second respect to the average of them. 

 
Figure 1. System Architecture. 

Other features included are the most frequent 

relations contained in the shorted path of the 

minimum distance; result to align the first phrase 

with the second one. Following table shows the 

relations selected as most frequent. 

A weight was added to each of them, according 

to the place it occupy in the shortest path between 

two synsets. The shortest path was calculated using 

Breadth -First-Search algorithm (BFS) (Cormen et 

al., 2001). 

In addition, there is one feature that takes into 

account any other relationship that is not 

previously considered. 

Finally, as a result we obtain 22 features from 

this alignment method.

3.2 Semantic Distance 

As aforementioned, our distance depends on 

calculating the similarity between sentences, based 

on the analysis of WordNet relations, and we only 

took into account the most frequent ones. When 

searching the shortest path between two WordNet 

synsets, frequents relations were considered the 

ones extracted according to the analysis made in 

the training corpus, provided by SemEval-2013. 

The distance between two synsets is calculated 

with the relations found; and simply it is the sum 

of the weights assigned to each connection. 

𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑃(𝑃, 𝑄) =  𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆(𝑃𝑋, 𝑄𝑌), ∀ (𝑋, 𝑌) (1) 

𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆(𝑋, 𝑌) = 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑋𝑖 , 𝑌𝑗), ∀(𝑖, 𝑗) (2) 

𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑋𝑖; 𝑌𝑗) = ∑ 𝑊(𝑅𝑒𝑙(𝐿[𝑘], 𝐿[𝑘 + 1]))

𝑘=𝑚

𝑘=0

 (3) 

𝐿 = 𝐵𝐹𝑆(𝑋𝑖; 𝑌𝑗) (4) 

Where 𝑖 and 𝑗 represents the i-th and j-th sense of 
the word; P and Q represents words collections; 𝑃𝑋 
is the X-th word of 𝑃; 𝑄𝑌 is the Y-th word of 𝑄; 
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑃 obtains a value that represents a 

minimal semantic distance across WordNet (Miller 

et al., 2006) resource (this resource is involved into 

the integrator resource, ISR-WN (Gutiérrez et al., 

2011a; 2010a); 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆  the minimal semantic 
distance between two words; 𝑀𝑖𝑛 represents the 
minimal semantic distance between two senses 

collections; 𝐿 is a collection of synsets that 
represents the minimal path between two synsets 

using BFS; 𝑅𝑒𝑙 obtains semantic relation types 
between two synsets; W is a functions that apply 

the rules described in Table 1. The maximum and 

average distance is calculated in a similar fashion 

but using the maximum and average instead of the 

minimum. 

3.3 Semantic Alignment 

First, the two sentences are pre-processed with 

Freeling 2.2 and the words are classified according 

to their parts-of-speech. Then, all senses of every 

word are taken and treated as a group. Distance 

between two groups will be the minimal distance 

(described in 3.1) between senses of any pair of 

words belonging to the group. 

In the example of Figure 2, Dist=280 is selected 

for the pair “Balance-Culture” (minimal cost).  

Following the explanation on section 3.1 we 

extract the features guided to measure the level of 

proximity between both sentences. 

 
Figure 2. Distance between “Balance” and “Culture”. 

A maximum and average distance is calculated in a 

similar fashion, but using the maximum and 

average instead of the minimum. 

4 Description of the training phase 

For the training process, we used a supervised 

learning framework (based on Weka4), including 

all the training set (positive and negative instances) 

as a training corpus. We conduct several 

experiments in order to select the correct classifier, 

the best result being obtained with a model based 

on bagging (using JRip algorithm). Finally, we 

used 10-fold cross validation technique with the 

selected classifier, obtaining a classification value 

of 73.21%.

5 Results and discussion 

EPS task of SemEval-2013 offered many official 

measures to rank the systems. Some of them are 

the following: 

o F-Measure (FM): Correct Response (CR), 
Instances correctly classified, True positives 

(TP), Instances correctly classified as 

positive. False Positives (FP), Instances 

incorrectly classified as positive, True 

Negatives (TN), Instances correctly 

classified as negative, False Negatives (FN), 

Instances incorrectly classified as negative. 

Corpus FM CR TP FP TN FN 

English 0.6892 2826 1198 325 1628 755 

Italian 0.6396 574 245 96 329 180 

Table 2. Official SemEval 2013 results. 

The behavior of our system, for English and 

Italian corpus is shown in Table 2. 

The only thing that changes to process the 

Italian corpus is that Freeling is used as input to 

identify Italian words and it returns the English 

WN synsets. The process continues in the same 

way as English. 

Figure 3: Semantic Distance distribution between 

negative and positive instances.  

As shown in Table 2, our main drawback is to 

classify positive instances. Sometimes, the distance 

between positive phrases is very far. This is due to 

the relations found in the minimum path are very 

similar to the one found in other pairs of negatives 

instances; this can be the cause of our MLS 

classifies them as negatives (see Figure 3). 

Figure 3 shows a distributional graphics that 

take a sample of 200 negative and positive 

instances. The graphics illustrate how close to zero 

value the positive instances are, while the 

negatives are far away from this value. However, 

in the approximate range between 80 and 200, we 

can see values of positive and negative instances 

positioning together. This can be the cause that our 

MLS misclassified some positive instances as 

negative. 

6 Conclusion and future work 

This paper introduced a new framework for EPS, 

which depends on the extraction of several features 

from WordNet relations. We have conducted the 

semantic features extraction in a multidimensional 

context using the resource ISR-WN(Gutiérrez et 

al., 2010a). 

Our semantic distance provides an appealing 

approach for dealing with phrasal detection based 

on WordNet relation. Our team reached the sixth 

position of ten runs for English corpus, with a 

small difference of 0.07 points compared to the 

best results with respect to accuracy parameter. 

Despite the problems caused by poorly selected 

positive instances, our distance (labeled as Our) 

obtained very similar results to those obtained by 

the best team (labeled as First5), which indicates 

that our work is well underway (see Table 3 for 

details).

Table 3. Comparative results (English corpus). 

It is important to remark that our system has 

been the only competitor to evaluate Italian texts. 

It has been possible due to our system include 

Freeling in the preprocessing stage. 

Our future work will aim to resolve instances 

misclassified by our algorithm. In addition, we will 

introduce lexical substitutions (synonyms) to 

expand the corpus, we will also apply conceptual 

semantic similarity using relevant semantic trees 

(Gutiérrez et al., 2010b; Gutiérrez et al., 2011b).
