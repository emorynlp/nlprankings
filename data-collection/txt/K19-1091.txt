Abstract

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to
predict the sentiment polarity towards a partic-
ular aspect in a sentence. Recently, this task
has been widely addressed by the neural at-
tention mechanism, which computes attention
weights to softly select words for generating
aspect-specific sentence representations. The
attention is expected to concentrate on opin-
ion words for accurate sentiment prediction.
However, attention is prone to be distracted by
noisy or misleading words, or opinion words
from other aspects. In this paper, we pro-
pose an alternative hard-selection approach,
which determines the start and end positions
of the opinion snippet, and selects the words
between these two positions for sentiment pre-
diction. Specifically, we learn deep associa-
tions between the sentence and aspect, and the
long-term dependencies within the sentence
by leveraging the pre-trained BERT model.
We further detect the opinion snippet by self-
critical reinforcement learning. Especially, ex-
perimental results demonstrate the effective-
ness of our method and prove that our hard-
selection approach outperforms soft-selection
approaches when handling multi-aspect sen-
tences.

1 Introduction

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee,
2008; Liu, 2012) is a fine-grained sentiment anal-
ysis task which has gained much attention from
research and industries. It aims at predicting the
sentiment polarity of a particular aspect of the
text. With the rapid development of deep learning,
this task has been widely addressed by attention-
based neural networks (Wang et al., 2016; Ma
et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2018;

Aspect: place Label: Negative Prediction: Positive

the food is usually good but it certainly is not a relaxing place to go

Figure 1: Example of attention visualization. The at-
tention weights of the aspect place are from the model
ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016), a typical attention
mechanism used for soft-selection.

Wang et al., 2018a). To name a few, Wang et al.
(2016) learn to attend on different parts of the
sentence given different aspects, then generates
aspect-specific sentence representations for sen-
timent prediction. Tay et al. (2018) learn to at-
tend on correct words based on associative rela-
tionships between sentence words and a given as-
pect. These attention-based methods have brought
the ABSA task remarkable performance improve-
ment.

Previous attention-based methods can be cate-
gorized as soft-selection approaches since the at-
tention weights scatter across the whole sentence
and every word is taken into consideration with
different weights. This usually results in atten-
tion distraction (Li et al., 2018b), i.e., attending on
noisy or misleading words, or opinion words from
other aspects. Take Figure 1 as an example, for the
aspect place in the sentence “the food is usually
good but it certainly is not a relaxing place to go”,
we visualize the attention weights from the model
ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016). As we can see,
the words “good” and “but” are dominant in at-
tention weights. However, “good” is used to de-
scribe the aspect food rather than place, “but”
is not so related to place either. The true opin-
ion snippet “certainly is not a relaxing place” re-
ceives low attention weights, leading to the wrong
prediction towards the aspect place.

Therefore, we propose an alternative hard-
selection approach by determining two positions



971

in the sentence and selecting words between these
two positions as the opinion expression of a given
aspect. This is also based on the observation that
opinion words of a given aspect are usually dis-
tributed consecutively as a snippet (Wang and Lu,
2018). As a consecutive whole, the opinion snip-
pet may gain enough attention weights, avoid be-
ing distracted by other noisy or misleading words,
or distant opinion words from other aspects. We
then predict the sentiment polarity of the given as-
pect based on the average of the extracted opin-
ion snippet. The explicit selection of the opinion
snippet also brings us another advantage that it can
serve as justifications of our sentiment predictions,
making our model more interpretable.

To accurately determine the two positions of
the opinion snippet of a particular aspect, we
first model the deep associations between the sen-
tence and aspect, and the long-term dependen-
cies within the sentence by BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018), which is a pre-trained language model and
achieves exciting results in many natural language
tasks. Second, with the contextual representations
from BERT, the two positions are sequentially de-
termined by self-critical reinforcement learning.
The reason for using reinforcement learning is that
we do not have the ground-truth positions of the
opinion snippet, but only the polarity of the corre-
sponding aspect. Then the extracted opinion snip-
pet is used for sentiment classification. The details
are described in the model section.

The main contributions of our paper are as fol-
lows:

• We propose a hard-selection approach to
address the ABSA task. Specifically, our
method determines two positions in the sen-
tence to detect the opinion snippet towards
a particular aspect, and then uses the framed
content for sentiment classification. Our ap-
proach can alleviate the attention distrac-
tion problem in previous soft-selection ap-
proaches.

• We model deep associations between the sen-
tence and aspect, and the long-term depen-
dencies within the sentence by BERT. We
then learn to detect the opinion snippet by
self-critical reinforcement learning.

• The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and also our

approach significantly outperforms soft-
selection approaches on handling multi-
aspect sentences.

2 Related Work

Traditional machine learning methods for aspect-
based sentiment analysis focus on extracting a
set of features to train sentiment classifiers (Ding
et al., 2009; Boiy and Moens, 2009; Jiang et al.,
2011), which usually are labor intensive. With the
development of deep learning technologies, neu-
ral attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014)
has been widely adopted to address this task (Tang
et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016;
Ma et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Cheng et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018a; Tay
et al., 2018; Hazarika et al., 2018; Majumder et al.,
2018; Fan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b). Wang
et al. (2016) propose attention-based LSTM net-
works which attend on different parts of the sen-
tence for different aspects. Ma et al. (2017) utilize
the interactive attention to capture the deep asso-
ciations between the sentence and the aspect. Hi-
erarchical models (Cheng et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2018a; Wang et al., 2018a) are also employed to
capture multiple levels of emotional expression
for more accurate prediction, as the complexity
of sentence structure and semantic diversity. Tay
et al. (2018) learn to attend based on associative
relationships between sentence words and aspect.

All these methods use normalized attention
weights to softly select words for generating
aspect-specific sentence representations, while the
attention weights scatter across the whole sentence
and can easily result in attention distraction. Wang
and Lu (2018) propose a hard-selection method to
learn segmentation attention which can effectively
capture the structural dependencies between the
target and the sentiment expressions with a linear-
chain conditional random field (CRF) layer. How-
ever, it can only address aspect-term level senti-
ment prediction which requires annotations for as-
pect terms. Compared with it, our method can
handle both aspect-term level and aspect-category
level sentiment prediction by detecting the opinion
snippet.

3 Model

We first formulate the problem. Given a sen-
tence S = {w1, w2, ..., wN} and an aspect A =
{a1, a2, ..., aM}, the ABSA task is to predict the

Figure 2: Network Architecture. We leverage BERT to
model the relationships between sentence words and a
particular aspect. The sentence and aspect are packed
together into a single sequence and fed into BERT, in
which E represents the input embedding, and Ti rep-
resents the contextual representation of token i. With
the contextual representations from BERT, the start and
end positions are sequentially sampled and then the
framed content is used for sentiment prediction. Re-
inforcement learning is adopted for solving the non-
differentiable problem of sampling.

sentiment of A. In our setting, the aspect can be
either aspect terms or an aspect category. As as-
pect terms, A is a snippet of words in S, i.e., a
sub-sequence of the sentence, while as an aspect
category, A represents a semantic category with
M = 1, containing just an abstract token.

In this paper, we propose a hard-selection ap-
proach to solve the ABSA task. Specifically,
we first learn to detect the corresponding opinion
snippet O = {wl, wl+1..., wr}, where 1 ≤ l ≤
r ≤ N , and then use O to predict the sentiment
of the given aspect. The network architecture is
shown in Figure 2.

3.1 Word-Aspect Fusion

Accurately modeling the relationships between
sentence words and an aspect is the key to the
success of the ABSA task. Many methods have
been developed to model word-aspect relation-
ships. Wang et al. (2016) simply concatenate
the aspect embedding with the input word em-
beddings and sentence hidden representations for
computing aspect-specific attention weights. Ma
et al. (2017) learn the aspect and sentence interac-
tively by using two attention networks. Tay et al.

(2018) adopt circular convolution of vectors for
performing the word-aspect fusion.

In this paper, we employ BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018) to model the deep associations between the
sentence words and the aspect. BERT is a power-
ful pre-trained model which has achieved remark-
able results in many NLP tasks. The architec-
ture of BERT is a multi-layer bidirectional Trans-
former Encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017), which uses
the self-attention mechanism to capture complex
interaction and dependency between terms within
a sequence. To leverage BERT to model the rela-
tionships between the sentence and the aspect, we
pack the sentence and aspect together into a sin-
gle sequence and then feed it into BERT, as shown
in Figure 2. With this sentence-aspect concatena-
tion, both the word-aspect associations and word-
word dependencies are modeled interactively and
simultaneously. With the contextual token repre-
sentations TS = T[1:N ] ∈ RN×H of the sentence,
where N is the sentence length and H is the hid-
den size, we can then determine the start and end
positions of the opinion snippet in the sentence.

3.2 Soft-Selection Approach
To fairly compare the performance of soft-
selection approaches with hard-selection ap-
proaches, we use the same word-aspect fusion re-
sults TS from BERT. We implement the attention
mechanism by adopting the approach similar to
the work (Lin et al., 2017).

α = softmax(v1tanh(W1TS
T))

g = αTS
(1)

where v1 ∈ RH and W1 ∈ RH×H are the parame-
ters. The normalized attention weights α are used
to softly select words from the whole sentence and
generate the final aspect-specific sentence repre-
sentation g. Then we make sentiment prediction
as follows:

ŷ = softmax(W2g + b) (2)

where W2 ∈ RC×H and b ∈ RC are the weight
matrix and bias vector respectively. ŷ is the prob-
ability distribution on C polarities. The polarity
with highest probability is selected as the predic-
tion.

3.3 Hard-Selection Approach
Our proposed hard-selection approach determines
the start and end positions of the opinion snippet



973

and selects the words between these two positions
for sentiment prediction. Since we do not have the
ground-truth opinion snippet, but only the polarity
of the corresponding aspect, we adopt reinforce-
ment learning (Williams, 1992) to train our model.
To make sure that the end position comes after the
start position, we determine the start and end se-
quentially as a sequence training problem (Rennie
et al., 2017). The parameters of the network, Θ,
define a policy pθ and output an action that is the
prediction of the position. For simplicity, we only
generate two actions for determining the start and
end positions respectively. After determining the
start position, the “state” is updated and then the
end is conditioned on the start.

Specifically, we define a start vector s ∈ RH
and an end vector e ∈ RH . Similar to the prior
work (Devlin et al., 2018), the probability of a
word being the start of the opinion snippet is com-
puted as a dot product between its contextual token
representation and s followed by a softmax over
all of the words of the sentence.

βl = softmax(TSs) (3)

We then sample the start position l based on the
multinomial distribution βl. To guarantee the end
comes after the start, the end is sampled only in the
right part of the sentence after the start. Therefore,
the state is updated by slicing operation TSr =
TS [l :]. Same as the start position, the end position
r is also sampled based on the distribution βr:

βr = softmax(T
r
Se) (4)

Then we have the opinion snippet TO = TS [l : r]
to predict the sentiment polarity of the given as-
pect in the sentence. The probabilities of the start
position at l and the end position at r are p(l) =
βl[l] and p(r) = βr[r] respectively.

3.3.1 Reward
After we get the opinion snippet TO by the sam-
pling of the start and end positions, we compute
the final representation go by the average of the
opinion snippet, go = avg(TO). Then, equation 2
with different weights is applied for computing the
sentiment prediction ŷo. The cross-entropy loss
function is employed for computing the reward.

R = −
∑
c

yc log ŷoc (5)

where c is the index of the polarity class and y is
the ground truth.

3.3.2 Self-Critical Training
In this paper, we use reinforcement learning to
learn the start and end positions. The goal of train-
ing is to minimize the negative expected reward as
shown below.

L(Θ) = −R · p(l) · p(r) (6)

where Θ is all the parameters in our architecture,
which includes the base method BERT, the posi-
tion selection parameters {s, e}, and the parame-
ters for sentiment prediction and then for reward
calculation. Therefore, the state in our method is
the combination of the sentence and the aspect.
For each state, the action space is every position
of the sentence.

To reduce the variance of the gradient estima-
tion, the reward is associated with a reference re-
ward or baseline Rb (Rennie et al., 2017). With the
likelihood ratio trick, the objective function can be
transformed as.

L(Θ) = −(R−Rb) ·(log(p(l))+ log(p(r))) (7)

The baseline Rb is computed based on the snippet
determined by the baseline policy, which selects
the start and end positions greedily by the argmax
operation on the softmax results. As shown in
Figure 2, the reward R is calculated by sampling
the snippet, while the baseline Rb is computed by
greedily selecting the snippet. Note that in the test
stage, the snippet is determined by argmax for
inference.

4 Experiments

In this section, we compare our hard-selection
model with various baselines. To assess the ability
of alleviating the attention distraction, we further
conduct experiments on a simulated multi-aspect
dataset in which each sentence contains multiple
aspects.

4.1 Datasets

We use the same datasets as the work by Tay et al.
(2018), which are already processed to token lists
and released in Github1. The datasets are from Se-
mEval 2014 task 4 (Pontiki et al., 2014), and Se-
mEval 2015 task 12 (Pontiki et al., 2015), respec-
tively. For aspect term level sentiment classifica-
tion task (denoted by T), we apply the Laptops and

mEval 2014 and a composed dataset from both Se-
mEval 2014 and SemEval 2015. The statistics of
the datasets are shown in Table 1.

4.2 Implementation Details

Our proposed models are implemented in Py-
Torch2. We utilize the bert-base-uncased model,
which contains 12 layers and the number of all pa-
rameters is 100M. The dimension H is 768. The
BERT model is initialized from the pre-trained
model, other parameters are initialized by sam-
pling from normal distribution N (0, 0.02). In our
experiments, the batch size is 32. The reported
results are the testing scores that fine-tuning 7
epochs with learning rate 5e-5.

4.3 Compared Models

• LSTM: it uses the average of all hidden states
as the sentence representation for sentiment
prediction. In this model, aspect information
is not used.

• TD-LSTM (Tang et al., 2015): it employs
two LSTMs and both of their outputs are ap-
plied to predict the sentiment polarity.

2https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-
BERT

• AT-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016): it uti-
lizes the attention mechanism to produce an
aspect-specific sentence representation. This
method is a kind of soft-selection approach.

• ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016): it also
uses the attention mechanism. The difference
with AT-LSTM is that it concatenates the as-
pect embedding to each word embedding as
the input to LSTM.

• AF-LSTM(CORR) (Tay et al., 2018): it
adopts circular correlation to capture the deep
fusion between sentence words and the as-
pect, which can learn rich, higher-order re-
lationships between words and the aspect.

• AF-LSTM(CONV) (Tay et al., 2018): com-
pared with AF-LSTM(CORR), this method
applies circular convolution of vectors for
performing word-aspect fusion to learn rela-
tionships between sentence words and the as-
pect.

• BERT-Original: it makes sentiment predic-
tion by directly using the final hidden vector
C from BERT with the sentence-aspect pair
as input.

4.4 Our Models
• BERT-Soft: as described in Section 3.2, the

contextual token representations from BERT
are processed by self attention mechanism
(Lin et al., 2017) and the attention-weighted
sentence representation is utilized for senti-
ment classification.

• BERT-Hard: as described in Section 3.3,
it takes the same input as BERT-Soft. It is
called a hard-selection approach since it em-
ploys reinforcement learning techniques to
explicitly select the opinion snippet corre-
sponding to a particular aspect for sentiment
prediction.

4.5 Experimental Results
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our
models by comparing them with various baseline
models. Experimental results are illustrated in Ta-
ble 2, in which 3-way represents 3-class sentiment
classification (positive, negative and neutral) and
Binary denotes binary sentiment prediction (posi-
tive and negative). The best score of each column
is marked in bold.

Table 2: Experimental results (accuracy %) on all the datasets. Models in the first part are baseline methods. The
results in the first part (except BERT-Original) are obtained from the prior work (Tay et al., 2018). Avg column
presents macro-averaged results across all the datasets.

Firstly, we observe that BERT-Original,
BERT-Soft, and BERT-Hard outperform all
soft attention baselines (in the first part of
Table 2), which demonstrates the effective-
ness of fine-tuning the pre-trained model
on the aspect-based sentiment classification
task. Particularly, BERT-Original outper-
forms AF-LSTM(CONV) by 2.63%∼9.57%,
BERT-Soft outperforms AF-LSTM(CONV)
by 2.01%∼9.60% and BERT-Hard improves
AF-LSTM(CONV) by 3.38%∼11.23% in terms
of accuracy. Considering the average score
across eight settings, BERT-Original outper-
forms AF-LSTM(CONV) by 6.46%, BERT-Soft
outperforms AF-LSTM(CONV) by 6.47% and
BERT-Hard outperforms AF-LSTM(CONV) by
7.19% respectively.

Secondly, we compare the performance of
three BERT-related methods. The performance
of BERT-Original and BERT-Soft are similar by
comparing their average scores. The reason may
be that the original BERT has already modeled
the deep relationships between the sentence and
the aspect. BERT-Original can be thought of as
a kind of soft-selection approach as BERT-Soft.
We also observe that the snippet selection by re-
inforcement learning improves the performance
over soft-selection approaches in almost all set-
tings. However, the improvement of BERT-Hard
over BERT-Soft is marginal. The average score of
BERT-Hard is better than BERT-Soft by 0.68%.
The improvement percentages are between 0.36%
and 1.49%, while on the Laptop dataset, the per-
formance of BERT-Hard is slightly weaker than

BERT-Soft. The main reason is that the datasets
only contain a small portion of multi-aspect sen-
tences with different polarities. The distraction of
attention will not impact the sentiment prediction
much in single-aspect sentences or multi-aspect
sentences with the same polarities.

4.6 Experimental Results on Multi-Aspect
Sentences

On the one hand, the attention distraction issue be-
comes worse in multi-aspect sentences. In addi-
tion to noisy and misleading words, the attention is
also prone to be distracted by opinion words from
other aspects of the sentence. On the other hand,
the attention distraction impacts the performance
of sentiment prediction more in multi-aspect sen-
tences than in single-aspect sentences. Hence, we
evaluate the performance of our models on a test
dataset with only multi-aspect sentences.

A multi-aspect sentence can be categorized by
two dimensions: the Number of aspects and the
Polarity dimension which indicates whether the
sentiment polarities of all aspects are the same or
not. In the dimension of Number, we categorize
the multi-aspect sentences as 2-3 and More. 2-3
refers to the sentences with two or three aspects
while More refers to the sentences with more than
three aspects. The statistics in the original dataset
shows that there are much more sentences with 2-
3 aspects than those with More aspects. In the di-
mension Polarity, the multi-aspect sentences can
be categorized into Same and Diff. Same indicates
that all aspects in the sentence have the same senti-
ment polarity. Diff indicates that the aspects have

different polarities.
Multi-aspect test set. To evaluate the perfor-

mance of our models on multi-aspect sentences,
we construct a new multi-aspect test set by se-
lecting all multi-aspect sentences from the original
training, development, and test sets of the Restau-
rants term-level task. The details are shown in Ta-
ble 3.

Multi-aspect training set. Since we use all
multi-aspect sentences for testing, we need to
generate some “virtual” multi-aspect sentences
for training. The simulated multi-aspect training
set includes the original single-aspect sentences
and the newly constructed multi-aspect sentences,
which are generated by concatenating multiple
single-aspect sentences with different aspects. We
keep the balance of each subtype in the new train-
ing set (see Table 4). The number of Neutral sen-
tences is the least among three sentiment polarities
in all single-aspect sentences. We randomly se-
lect the same number of Positive and Negative sen-
tences. Then we construct multi-aspect sentences
by combining single-aspect sentences in different
combinations of polarities. The naming for dif-
ferent combinations is simple. For example, 2P-
1N indicates that the sentence has two positive as-
pects and one negative aspect, and P-N-Nu means
that the three aspects in the sentence are positive,
negative, and neutral respectively. For simplicity,

we only construct 2-asp and 3-asp sentences which
are also the majority in the original dataset.

Results and Discussions. The results on dif-
ferent types of multi-aspect sentences are shown
in Table 5. The performance of BERT-Hard is
better than BERT-Original and BERT-Soft over all
types of multi-aspect sentences. BERT-Hard out-
performs BERT-Soft by 2.11% when the aspects
have the same sentiment polarities. For multi-
aspect sentences with different polarities, the im-
provements are more significant. BERT-Hard out-
performs BERT-Soft by 7.65% in total of Diff. The
improvements are 5.07% and 12.83% for the types
2-3 and More respectively, which demonstrates the
ability of our model on handling sentences with
More aspects. Particularly, BERT-Soft has the
poorest performance on the subset Diff among the
three methods, which proves that soft attention is
more likely to cause attention distraction.

Intuitively, when multiple aspects in the sen-
tence have the same sentiment polarities, even the
attention is distracted to other opinion words of
other aspects, it can still predict correctly to some
extent. In such sentences, the impact of the at-
tention distraction is not obvious and difficult to
detect. However, when the aspects have differ-
ent sentiment polarities, the attention distraction
will lead to catastrophic error prediction, which
will obviously decrease the classification accu-
racy. As shown in Table 5, the accuracy of Diff
is much worse than Same for all three methods.
It means that the type of Diff is difficult to han-
dle. Even though, the significant improvement
proves that our hard-selection method can alle-
viate the attention distraction to a certain extent.
For soft-selection methods, the attention distrac-
tion is inevitable due to their way in calculating
the attention weights for every single word. The
noisy or irrelevant words could seize more atten-
tion weights than the ground truth opinion words.
Our method considers the opinion snippet as a

consecutive whole, which is more resistant to at-
tention distraction.

4.7 Visualization

In this section, we visualize the attention weights
for BERT-Soft and opinion snippets for BERT-
Hard. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the multi-
aspect sentence “the appetizers are OK, but the
service is slow” belongs to the category Diff.
Firstly, the attention weights of BERT-Soft scat-
ter among the whole sentence and could attend to
irrelevant words. For the aspect service, BERT-
Soft attends to the word “ok” with relatively high
score though it does not describe the aspect ser-
vice. This problem also exists for the aspect appe-
tizers. Furthermore, the attention distraction could
cause error prediction. For the aspect appetizers,
“but” and “slow” gain high attention scores and
cause the wrong sentiment prediction Negative.

Secondly, our proposed method BERT-Hard can
detect the opinion snippet for a given aspect. As
illustrated in Figure 3, the opinion snippets are se-
lected by BERT-Hard accurately. In the sentence
“the appetizers are ok, but the service is slow”,
BERT-Hard can exactly locate the opinion snip-
pets “ok” and “slow” for the aspect appetizers
and service respectively.

At last, we enumerate some opinion snippets
detected by BERT-Hard in Table 6. Our method
can precisely detect snippets even for latent opin-
ion expression and alleviate the influence of noisy
words. For instance, “cannot be beat for the qual-
ity” is hard to predict using soft attention because
the sentiment polarity is transformed by the neg-
ative word “cannot”. Our method can select the
whole snippet without bias to any word and in this
way the attention distraction can be alleviated. We
also list some inaccurate snippets in Table 7. Some
meaningless words around the true snippet are in-
cluded, such as “are”, “and” and “at”. These

words do not affect the final prediction. A possi-
ble explanation to these inaccurate words is that
the true snippets are unlabeled and our method
predicts them only by the supervisory signal from
sentiment labels.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a hard-selection ap-
proach for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which
determines the start and end positions of the opin-
ion snippet for a given input aspect. The deep as-
sociations between the sentence and aspect, and
the long-term dependencies within the sentence
are taken into consideration by leveraging the pre-
trained BERT model. With the hard selection
of the opinion snippet, our approach can alle-
viate the attention distraction problem of tradi-
tional attention-based soft-selection methods. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. Especially, our hard-selection ap-
proach outperforms soft-selection approaches sig-
nificantly when handling multi-aspect sentences
with different sentiment polarities.
