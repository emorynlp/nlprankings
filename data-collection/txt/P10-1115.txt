Abstract
Probabilistic latent topic models have re-
cently enjoyed much success in extracting
and analyzing latent topics in text in an un-
supervised way. One common deficiency
of existing topic models, though, is that
they would not work well for extracting
cross-lingual latent topics simply because
words in different languages generally do
not co-occur with each other. In this paper,
we propose a way to incorporate a bilin-
gual dictionary into a probabilistic topic
model so that we can apply topic models to
extract shared latent topics in text data of
different languages. Specifically, we pro-
pose a new topic model called Probabilis-
tic Cross-Lingual Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (PCLSA) which extends the Proba-
bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA)
model by regularizing its likelihood func-
tion with soft constraints defined based on
a bilingual dictionary. Both qualitative and
quantitative experimental results show that
the PCLSA model can effectively extract
cross-lingual latent topics from multilin-
gual text data.

1 Introduction

As a robust unsupervised way to perform shallow
latent semantic analysis of topics in text, prob-
abilistic topic models (Hofmann, 1999a; Blei et
al., 2003b) have recently attracted much atten-
tion. The common idea behind these models is the
following. A topic is represented by a multino-
mial word distribution so that words characteriz-
ing a topic generally have higher probabilities than
other words. We can then hypothesize the exis-
tence of multiple topics in text and define a gener-
ative model based on the hypothesized topics. By
fitting the model to text data, we can obtain an es-
timate of all the word distributions corresponding

to the latent topics as well as the topic distributions
in text. Intuitively, the learned word distributions
capture clusters of words that co-occur with each
other probabilistically.

Although many topic models have been pro-
posed and shown to be useful (see Section 2 for
more detailed discussion of related work), most
of them share a common deficiency: they are de-
signed to work only for mono-lingual text data and
would not work well for extracting cross-lingual
latent topics, i.e. topics shared in text data in
two different natural languages. The deficiency
comes from the fact that all these models rely on
co-occurrences of words forming a topical cluster,
but words in different language generally do not
co-occur with each other. Thus with the existing
models, we can only extract topics from text in
each language, but cannot extract common topics
shared in multiple languages.

In this paper, we propose a novel topic model,
called Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (PCLSA) model, which can be used to
mine shared latent topics from unaligned text data
in different languages. PCLSA extends the Proba-
bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model
by regularizing its likelihood function with soft
constraints defined based on a bilingual dictio-
nary. The dictionary-based constraints are key to
bridge the gap of different languages and would
force the captured co-occurrences of words in
each language by PCLSA to be “synchronized”
so that related words in the two languages would
have similar probabilities. PCLSA can be esti-
mated efficiently using the General Expectation-
Maximization (GEM) algorithm. As a topic ex-
traction algorithm, PCLSA would take a pair of
unaligned document sets in different languages
and a bilingual dictionary as input, and output a
set of aligned word distributions in both languages
that can characterize the shared topics in the two
languages. In addition, it also outputs a topic cov-

1128



erage distribution for each language to indicate the
relative coverage of different shared topics in each
language.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous work
has attempted to solve this topic extraction prob-
lem and generate the same output. The closest
existing work to ours is the MuTo model pro-
posed in (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009) and the
JointLDA model published recently in (Jagarala-
mudi and Daumé III, 2010). Both used a bilingual
dictionary to bridge the language gap in a topic
model. However, the goals of their work are dif-
ferent from ours in that their models mainly focus
on mining cross-lingual topics of matching word
pairs and discovering the correspondence at the
vocabulary level. Therefore, the topics extracted
using their model cannot indicate how a common
topic is covered differently in the two languages,
because the words in each word pair share the
same probability in a common topic. Our work fo-
cuses on discovering correspondence at the topic
level. In our model, since we only add a soft con-
straint on word pairs in the dictionary, their prob-
abilities in common topics are generally different,
naturally capturing which shows the different vari-
ations of a common topic in different languages.

We use a cross-lingual news data set and a re-
view data set to evaluate PCLSA. We also propose
a “cross-collection” likelihood measure to quanti-
tatively evaluate the quality of mined topics. Ex-
perimental results show that the PCLSA model
can effectively extract cross-lingual latent topics
from multilingual text data, and it outperforms a
baseline approach using the standard PLSA on text
data in each language.

2 Related Work

Many topic models have been proposed, and the
two basic models are the Probabilistic Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (PLSA) model (Hofmann, 1999a)
and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model
(Blei et al., 2003b). They and their extensions
have been successfully applied to many prob-
lems, including hierarchical topic extraction (Hof-
mann, 1999b; Blei et al., 2003a; Li and McCal-
lum, 2006), author-topic modeling (Steyvers et al.,
2004), contextual topic analysis (Mei and Zhai,
2006), dynamic and correlated topic models (Blei
and Lafferty, 2005; Blei and Lafferty, 2006), and
opinion analysis (Mei et al., 2007; Branavan et al.,
2008). Our work is an extension of PLSA by in-

corporating the knowledge of a bilingual dictio-
nary as soft constraints. Such an extension is sim-
ilar to the extension of PLSA for incorporating so-
cial network analysis (Mei et al., 2008a) but our
constraint is different.

Some previous work on multilingual topic mod-
els assume documents in multiple languages are
aligned either at the document level, sentence level
or by time stamps (Mimno et al., 2009; Zhao and
Xing, 2006; Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Ni et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2007). However, in many ap-
plications, we need to mine topics from unaligned
text corpus. For example, mining topics from
search results in different languages can facilitate
summarization of multilingual search results.

Besides all the multilingual topic modeling
work discussed above, comparable corpora have
also been studied extensively (e.g. (Fung, 1995;
Franz et al., 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat
et al., 2003; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006)), but
most previous work aims at acquiring word trans-
lation knowledge or cross-lingual text categoriza-
tion from comparable corpora. Our work differs
from this line of previous work in that our goal is
to discover shared latent topics from multi-lingual
text data that are weakly comparable (e.g. the data
does not have to be aligned by time).

3 Problem Formulation

In general, the problem of cross-lingual topic ex-
traction can be defined as to extract a set of com-
mon cross-lingual latent topics covered in text col-
lections in different natural languages. A cross-
lingual latent topic will be represented as a multi-
nomial word distribution over the words in all
the languages, i.e. a multilingual word distri-
bution. For example, given two collections of
news articles in English and Chinese, respectively,
we would like to extract common topics simul-
taneously from the two collections. A discov-
ered common topic, such as the terrorist attack
on September 11, 2001, would be characterized
by a word distribution that would assign relatively
high probabilities to words related to this event in
both English and Chinese (e.g. “terror”, “attack”,
“afghanistan”, “taliban”, and their translations in
Chinese).

As a computational problem, our input is a
multi-lingual text corpus, and output is a set of
cross-lingual latent topics. We now define this
problem more formally.

1129



Definition 1 (Multi-Lingual Corpus) A multi-
lingual corpus C is a set of text collections
{C1, C2, . . . , Cs}, where Ci = {di1, di2, . . . , diMi}
is a collection of documents in language Li with
vocabulary Vi = {wi1, wi2, . . . , wiNi}. Here, Mi is
the total number of documents in Ci, Ni is the to-
tal number of words in Vi, and dij is a document in
collection Ci.

Following the common assumption of bag-of-
words representation, we represent document dij
with a bag of words {wij1 , w

i
j2

, . . . , wijd}, and use
c(wik, d

i
j) to denote the count of word w

i
k in docu-

ment dij .

Definition 2 (Cross-Lingual Topic): A cross-
lingual topic θ is a semantically coherent multi-
nomial distribution over all the words in the vo-
cabularies of languages L1, ..., Ls. That is, p(w|θ)
would give the probability of a word w which can
be in any of the s languages under consideration. θ
is semantically coherent if it assigns high probabil-
ities to words that are semantically related either in
the same language or across different languages.
Clearly, we have

∑s
i=1

∑
w∈Vi p(w|θ) = 1 for any

cross-lingual topic θ.

Definition 3 (Cross-Lingual Topic Extrac-
tion) Given a multi-lingual corpus C, the task of
cross-lingual topic extraction is to model and ex-
tract k major cross-lingual topics {θ1, θ2, . . . , θk}
from C, where θi is a cross-lingual topic, and k is
a user specified parameter.

The extracted cross-lingual topics can be di-
rectly used as a summary of the common con-
tent of the multi-lingual data set. Note that once
a cross-lingual topic is extracted, we can eas-
ily obtain its representation in each language Li
by “splitting” the cross-lingual topic into multi-
ple word distributions in different languages. For-
mally, the word distribution of a cross-lingual
topic θ in language Li is given by pi(wi|θ) =

p(wi|θ)∑
w∈Vi

p(w|θ) .

These aligned language-specific word distribu-
tions can directly review the variations of topics
in different languages. They can also be used to
analyze the difference of the coverage of the same
topic in different languages. Moreover, they are
also useful for retrieving relevant articles or pas-
sages in each language and aligning them to the
same common topic, thus essentially also allow-
ing us to integrate and align articles in multiple
languages.

4 Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent
Semantic Analysis

In this section, we present our probabilistic cross-
lingual latent semantic analysis (PCLSA) model
and discuss how it can be used to extract cross-
lingual topics from multi-lingual text data.

The main reason why existing topic models
can’t be used for cross-lingual topic extraction is
because they cannot cross the language barrier.
Intuitively, in order to cross the language barrier
and extract a common topic shared in articles in
different languages, we must rely on some kind
of linguistic knowledge. Our PCLSA model as-
sumes the availability of bi-lingual dictionaries for
at least some language pairs, which are generally
available for major language pairs. Specifically,
for text data in languages L1, ..., Ls, if we rep-
resent each language as a node in a graph and
connect those language pairs for which we have a
bilingual dictionary, the minimum requirement is
that the whole graph is connected. Thus, as a min-
imum, we will need s− 1 distinct bilingual dictio-
naries. This is so that we can potentially cross all
the language barriers.

Our key idea is to “synchronize” the extraction
of monolingual “component topics” of a cross-
lingual topic from individual languages by forcing
a cross-lingual topic word distribution to assign
similar probabilities to words that are potential
translations according to a Li-Lj bilingual dictio-
nary. We achieve this by adding such preferences
formally to the likelihood function of a probabilis-
tic topic model as “soft constraints” so that when
we estimate the model, we would try to not only
fit the text data well (which is necessary to extract
coherent component topics from each language),
but also satisfy our specified preferences (which
would ensure the extracted component topics in
different languages are semantically related). Be-
low we present how we implement this idea in
more detail.

A bilingual dictionary for languages Li and Lj
generally would give us a many-to-many map-
ping between the vocabularies of the two lan-
guages. With such a mapping, we can construct
a bipartite graph Gij = (Vij , Eij) between the
two languages where if one word can be poten-
tially translated into another word, the two words
would be connected with an edge. An edge can
be weighted based on the probability of the cor-
responding translation. An example graph for

1130



Chinese-English dictionary is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: A Dictionary based Word Graph

With multiple bilingual dictionaries, we can
merge the graphs to generate a multi-partite graph
G = (V, E). Based on this graph, the PCLSA
model extends the standard PLSA by adding a
constraint to the likelihood function to “smooth”
the word distributions of topics in PLSA on the
multi-partite graph so that we would encourage the
words that are connected in the graph (i.e. pos-
sible translations of each other) to be given simi-
lar probabilities by every cross-lingual topic. Thus
when a cross-lingual topic picks up words that co-
occur in mono-lingual text, it would prefer pick-
ing up word pairs whose translations in other lan-
guages also co-occur with each other, giving us a
coherent multilingual word distribution that char-
acterizes well the content of text in different lan-
guages.

Specifically, let Θ = {θj} (j = 1, ..., k) be a set
of k cross-lingual topic models to be discovered
from a multilingual text data set with s languages
such that p(w|θi) is the probability of word w ac-
cording to the topic model θi.

If we are to use the regular PLSA to model our
data, we would have the following log-likelihood
and we usually use a maximum likelihood estima-
tor to estimate parameters and discover topics.

L(C) =
s∑

i=1

∑
d∈Ci

∑
w

c(w, d) log
k∑

j=1

p(θj |d)p(w|θj)

Our main extension is to add to L(C) a cross-
lingual constraint term R(C) to incorporate the
knowledge of bilingual dictionaries. R(C) is de-
fined as

R(C) = 1
2

∑
⟨u,v⟩∈E

w(u, v)

k∑
j=1

(
p(wu|θj)
Deg(u)

− p(wv|θj)
Deg(v)

)2

where w(u, v) is the weight on the edge between
u and v in the multi-partite graph G = (V, E),
which in our experiments is set to 1, and Deg(u)

is the degree of word u, i.e. the sum of the weights
of all the edges ending with u.

Intuitively, R(C) measures the difference be-
tween p(wu|θj) and p(wv|θj) for each pair (u, v)
in a bilingual dictionary; the more they differ, the
larger R(C) would be. So it can be regarded as
a “loss function” to help us assess how well the
“component word distributions” in multiple lan-
guages are correlated semantically. Clearly, we
would like the extracted topics to have a small
R(C). We choose this specific form of loss func-
tion because it would make it convenient to solve
the optimization problem of maximizing the cor-
responding regularized maximum likelihood (Mei
et al., 2008b). The normalization with Deg(u)
and Deg(v) can be regarded as a way to compen-
sate for the potential ambiguity of u and v in their
translations.

Putting L(C) and R(C) together, we would
like to maximize the following objective function
which is a regularized log-likelihood:

O(C, G) = (1− λ)L(C)− λR(C) (1)

where λ ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter to balance the
likelihood and the regularizer. When λ = 0, we
recover the standard PLSA.

Specifically, we will search for a set of values
for all our parameters that can maximize the ob-
jective function defined above. Our parameters
include all the cross-lingual topics and the cov-
erage distributions of the topics in all documents,
which we denote by Ψ = {p(w|θj), p(θj |d)}d,w,j
where j = 1, ..., k, w varies over the entire vo-
cabularies of all the languages , d varies over
all the documents in our collection. This opti-
mization problem can be solved using a General-
ized Expectation-Maximization (GEM) algorithm
as described in (Mei et al., 2008a).

Specifically, in the E-step of the algorithm, the
distribution of hidden variables is computed using
Eq. 2.

z(w, d, j) =
p(θj |d)p(w|θj)∑
j′ p(θj′ |d)p(w|θj′)

(2)

Then in the M-step, we need to maximize the
complete data likelihood Q(Ψ;Ψn):

Q(Ψ;Ψn) = (1− λ)L′(C)− λR(C)

1131



where

L

(C) =

∑
d

∑
w

c(w, d)

∑
j

z(w, d, j) log p(θj |d)p(w|θj), (3)

with the constraints that
∑

j p(θj |d) = 1 and∑
w p(w|θj) = 1.
There is a closed form solution if we only want

to maximize the L′(C) part:

p(n+1)(θj |d) =
∑

w c(w, d)z(w, d, j)∑
w

∑
j′ c(w, d)z(w, d, j

′)

p(n+1)(w|θj) =
∑

d c(w, d)z(w, d, j)∑
d

∑′
w c(w

′, d)z(w′, d, j)
(4)

However, there is no closed form solution in the
M-step for the whole objective function. Fortu-
nately, according to GEM we do not need to find
the local maximum of Q(Ψ;Ψn) in every M-step,
and we only need to find a new value Ψn+1 to im-
prove the complete data likelihood, i.e. to make
sure Q(Ψn+1; Ψn) ≥ Q(Ψn; Ψn). So our method
is to first maximize the L′(C) part using Eq. 4 and
then use Eq. 5 to gradually increase the R(C) part.

p(t+1)(wu|θj) = (1− α)p(t)(wu|θj) (5)

+ α
∑

⟨u,v⟩∈E

w(u, v)

Deg(v)
p(t)(wv|θj)

Here, parameter α is the length of each smooth-
ing step. Obviously, after each smoothing step,
the sum of the probabilities of all the words in one
topic is still equal to 1. We smooth the parameters
until we cannot get a better parameter set Ψn+1.
Then, we continue to the next E-step. If there is
no Ψn+1 s.t. Q(Ψn+1; Ψn) ≥ Q(Ψn; Ψn), then
we consider Ψn to be the local maximum point of
the objective function Eq. 1.

5 Experiment Design

5.1 Data Set

The data set we used in our experiment is collected
from news articles of Xinhua English and Chi-
nese newswires. The whole data set is quite big,
containing around 40,000 articles in Chinese and
35,000 articles in English. For different purpose of
our experiments, we randomly selected different
number of documents from the whole corpus, and
we will describe the concrete statistics in each ex-
periment. To process the Chinese corpus, we use

a simple segmenter1 to split the data into Chinese
phrases. Both Chinese and English stopwords are
removed from our data.

The dictionary file we used for our PCLSA
model is from mandarintools.com2. For each Chi-
nese phrase, if it has several English meanings, we
add an edge between it and each of its English
translation. If one English translation is an En-
glish phrase, we add an edge between the Chinese
phrase and each English word in the phrase.

5.2 Baseline Method
As a baseline method, we can apply the standard
PLSA (Hofmann, 1999a) directly to the multi-
lingual corpus. Since PLSA takes advantage of
the word co-occurrences in the document level to
find semantic topics, directly using it for a multi-
lingual corpus will result in finding topics mainly
reflecting a single language (because words in dif-
ferent languages would not co-occur in the same
document in general). That is, the discovered top-
ics are mostly monolingual. These monolingual
topics can then be aligned based on a bilingual dic-
tionary to suggest a possible cross-lingual topic.

6 Experimental Results

6.1 Qualitative Comparison
To qualitatively compare PCLSA with the baseline
method, we compare the word distributions of top-
ics extracted by them. The data set we used in this
experiment is selected from the Xinhua News data
during the period from Jun. 8th, 2001 to Jun. 15th,
2001. There are totally 1799 English articles and
1485 Chinese articles in the data set. The num-
ber of topics to be extracted is set to 10 for both
methods.

Table 1 shows the experimental results. To
make it easier to understand, we add an English
translation to each Chinese phrase in our results.
The first ten rows show sample topics of the mod-
eling results of traditional PLSA model. We can
see that it only contains mono-language topics,
i.e. the topics are either in Chinese or in En-
glish. The next ten rows are the results from
our PCLSA model. Compared with the base-
line method, PCLSA can not only find coherent
topics from the cross-lingual corpus, but it can
also show the content about one topic from both
two language corpora. For example, in ’Topic 2’

2http://www.mandarintools.com/cedict.html

1132



Table 2: Synthetic Data Set from Xinhua News
English Shrine Olympic Championship

Chinese CPC Anniversary Afghan War Championship

which is about ’Israel’ and ’Palestinian’, the Chi-
nese corpus mentions a lot about ’Arafat’ who is
the leader of ’Palestinian’, while the English cor-
pus discusses more on topics such as ’cease fire’
and ’women’. Similarly, in ’Topic 9’, the topic
is related to Philippine, the Chinese corpus men-
tions some environmental situation in Philippine,
while the English corpus mentions a lot about
’Abu Sayyaf’.

6.2 Discovering Common Topics

To demonstrate the ability of PCLSA for finding
common topics in cross-lingual corpus, we use
some event names, e.g. ’Shrine’ and ’Olympic’,
as queries and randomly select a certain number of
documents from the whole corpus, which are re-
lated to the queries. The number of documents for
each query in the synthetic data set is shown in Ta-
ble 2. In either the English corpus or the Chinese
corpus, we select a smaller number of documents
about topic ’Championship’ combined with the
other two topics in the same corpus. In this way,
when we want to extract two topics from either En-
glish or Chinese corpus, the ’Championship’ topic
may not be easy to extract, because the other two
topics have more documents in the corpus. How-
ever, when we use PCLSA to extract four topics
from the two corpora together, we expect that the
topic ’Championship’ will be found, because now
the sum of English and Chinese documents related
to ’Championship’ is larger than other topics. The
experimental result is shown in Table 3. The first
two columns are the two topics extracted from En-
gish corpus, the third and the forth columns are
two topics from Chinese corpus, and the other four
columns are the results from cross-lingual cor-
pus. We can see that in either the Chinese sub-
collection or the English sub-collection, the topic
’Championship’ is not extracted as a significant
topic. But, as expected, the topic ’Championship’
is extracted from the cross-lingual corpus, while
the topic ’Olympic’ and topic ’Shrine’ are merged
together. This demonstrate that PCLSA is capable
of extracting common topics from a cross-lingual
corpus.

6.3 Quantitative Evaluation

We also quantitatively evaluate how well our
PCLSA model can discover common topics
among corpus in different languages. We pro-
pose a “cross-collection” likelihood measure for
this purpose. The basic idea is: suppose we got
k cross-lingual topics from the whole corpus, then
for each topic, we split the topic into two sepa-
rate set of topics, English topics and Chinese top-
ics, using the splitting formula described before,
i.e. pi(wi|θ) = p(w

i|θ)∑
w∈Vi

p(w|θ) . Then, we use the

word distribution of the Chinese topics (translating
the words into English) to fit the English Corpus
and use the word distribution of the English top-
ics (translating the words into Chinese) to fit the
Chinese Corpus. If the topics mined are common
topics in the whole corpus, then such a “cross-
collection” likelihood should be larger than those
topics which are not commonly shared by the En-
glish and the Chinese corpus. To calculate the
likelihood of fitness, we use the folding-in method
proposed in (Hofmann, 2001). To translate topics
from one language to another, e.g. Chinese to En-
glish, we look up the bilingual dictionary and do
word-to-word translation. If one Chinese word has
several English translations, we simply distribute
its probability mass equally to each English trans-
lation.

For comparison, we use the standard PLSA
model as the baseline. Basically, suppose PLSA
mined k semantic topics in the Chinese corpus and
k semantic topics in the English corpus. Then, we
also use the “cross-collection” likelihood measure
to see how well those k semantic Chinese topics fit
the English corpus and those k semantic English
topics fit the Chinese corpus.

We totally collect three data sets to compare the
performance. For the first data set, (English 1,
Chinese 1), both the Chinese and English corpus
are chosen from the Xinhua News Data during
the period from 2001.06.08 to 2001.06.15, which
has 1799 English articles and 1485 Chinese ar-
ticles. For the second data set, (English 2, Chi-
nese 2), the Chinese corpus Chinese 2 is the same
as Chinese 1, but the English corpus is chosen
from 2001.06.14 to 2001.06.19 which has 1547
documents. For the third data set, (English 3, Chi-
nese 3), the Chinese corpus is the same as in data
set one, but the English corpus is chosen from
2001.10.02 to 2001.10.07 which contains 1530
documents. In other words, in the first data set,

the English corpus and Chinese corpus are com-
parable with each other, because they cover simi-
lar events during the same period. In the second
data set, the English and Chinese corpora share
some common topics during the overlap period.
The third data is the most tough one since the two
corpora are from different periods. The purpose of
using these three different data sets for evaluation
is to test how well PCLSA can mine common top-
ics from either a data set where the English corpus
and the Chinese corpus are comparable or a data
set where the English corpus and the Chinese cor-
pus rarely share common topics.

The experimental results are shown in Table 4.
Each row shows the “cross-collection” likelihood
of using the “cross-collection” topics to fit the data
set named in the first column. For example, in
the first row, the values are the “cross-collection”
likelihood of using Chinese topics found by differ-
ent methods from the first data set to fit English 1.
The last collum shows how much improvement we
got from PCLSA compared with PLSA. From the
results, we can see that in all the data sets, our
PCLSA has higher “cross-collection” likelihood
value, which means it can find better common top-
ics compared to the baseline method. Notice that
the Chinese corpora are the same in all three data
sets. The results show that both PCLSA and PLSA
get lower “cross-collection” likelihood for fitting
the Chinese corpora when the data set becomes
“tougher”, i.e. less topic overlapping, but the im-

Topic Finding (“cross-collection” log-likelihood)

provement of PCLSA over PLSA does not drop
much. On the other hand, the improvement of
PCLSA over PLSA on the three English corpora
does not show any correlation with the difficulty
of the data set.

6.4 Extracting from Multi-Language Corpus

In the previous experiments, we have shown the
capability and effectiveness of the PCLSA model
in latent topic extraction from two language cor-
pora. In fact, the proposed model is general and
capable of extracting latent topics from multi-
language corpus. For example, if we have dic-
tionaries among multiple languages, we can con-
struct a multi-partite graph based on the corre-
spondence between those vocabularies, and then
smooth the PCLSA model with this graph.

To show the effectiveness of PCLSA in min-
ing multiple language corpus, we first construct a
simulated data set based on 1115 reviews of three
brands of laptops, namely IBM (303), Apple(468)
and DELL(344). To simulate a three language cor-

pus, we use an ’IBM’ word, an ’Apple’ word, and
a ’Dell’ word to replace an English word in their
corpus. For example, we use ’IBM10’, ’Apple10’,
’Dell10’ to replace the word ’CD’ whenever it ap-
pears in an IBM’s, Apple’s, or Dell’s review. Af-
ter the replacement, the reviews about IBM, Ap-
ple, and Dell will not share vocabularies with each
other. On the other hand, for any three created
words which represent the same English word, we
add three edges among them, and therefore we
get a simulated dictionary graph for our PCLSA
model.

The experimental result is shown in Table 5, in
which we try to extract 8 topics from the cross-
lingual corpus. The first ten rows show the re-
sult of our PCLSA model, in which we set a very
small value to the weight parameter λ for the reg-
ularizer part. This can be used as an approxima-
tion of the result from the traditional PLSA model
on this three language corpus. We can see that
the extracted topics are mainly written in mono-
language. As we set the value of parameter λ
larger, the extracted topics become multi-lingual,
which is shown in the next ten rows. From this
result, we can see the difference between the re-
views of different brands about the similar topic.
In addition, if we set the λ even larger, we will
get topics that are mostly made of the same words
from the three different brands, which means the
extracted topics are very smooth on the dictionary
graph now.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we study the problem of cross-
lingual latent topic extraction where the task is to
extract a set of common latent topics from multi-
lingual text data. We propose a novel probabilistic
topic model (i.e. the Probabilistic Cross-Lingual
Latent Semantic Analysis (PCLSA) model) that
can incorporate translation knowledge in bilingual
dictionaries as a regularizer to constrain the pa-
rameter estimation so that the learned topic models
would be synchronized in multiple languages. We
evaluated the model using several data sets. The
experimental results show that PCLSA is effec-
tive in extracting common latent topics from mul-
tilingual text data, and it outperforms the baseline
method which uses the standard PLSA to fit each
monolingual text data set.

Our work opens up some interesting future re-
search directions to further explore. First, in
this paper, we have only experimented with uni-
form weighting of edge in the bilingual graph.
It should be very interesting to explore how to
assign weights to the edges and study whether
weighted graphs can further improve performance.
Second, it would also be interesting to further
extend PCLSA to accommodate discovering top-
ics in each language that aren’t well-aligned with
other languages.
