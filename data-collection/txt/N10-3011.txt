Abstract 

This paper describes an experiment designed 
to evaluate the development of a Statistical 
Transfer-based Brazilian Portuguese to Eng-
lish Machine Translation system. We compare 
the performance of the system with the inclu-
sion of new syntactic written rules concerning 
verbal tense between the Brazilian Portuguese 
and English languages. Results indicate that 
the system performance improved compared 
with an initial version of the system. However 
significant adjustments remain to be done. 

1 Introduction 

Recently, Statistical Machine Translation systems 
have received much attention because they are 
fully automated and have shown significant im-
provements over other types of approaches. Ex-
periments with string-to-string and syntax-based 
systems have shown better results when linguistic 
features are added to Machine Translation systems 
(Chiang et al., 2009). The Statistical Transfer 
(Stat-XFER) approach presented in this paper was 
designed as a Statistical approach with a grammar 
module, which encodes syntactic transfer rules, 
i.e., rules which encode constituent structures from 
the source language to the target language struc-
ture. 

Verbal tenses vary among natural languages. 
Each language has its typical verbal form, and they 
share mood, voice, aspect and person qualities 
(Comrie, 1993). Some languages, such as Portu-

guese and English do not share the same properties 
and the number of verbal tenses may present di-
vergences. Our goal is to test the development of 
the Statistical Transfer-based system under the 
application of syntactic transfer rules of verbal 
tenses involving this pair of languages. 

2 The Statistical Transfer-based system  

The hybrid Stat-XFER system uses a transfer-
based method and statistical paradigm for the 
translation process and it is composed of the fol-
lowing main components: the Bilingual Phrasal 
Lexicon, Morphology, Transfer Engine and the 
Decoder. Given one sentence in the source lan-
guage, this input will go through all those compo-
nents until the system outputs a set of pairs 
mapping candidate translations to probabilities. 
The Stat-XFER framework is shown in the figure 1 
below.

Bilingual Phrasal Lexicon. The Portuguese-
English lexicon is made up of a word-level lexi-
con. The lexicon was automatically extracted from 
the EUROPARL corpus1 and in order to adjust it 
to this system’s needs, this lexicon has been modi-
fied with new entries and deleted of the repeated 
entries.  

Morphology. The system uses the Jspell2 mor-
phology analyzer, which was developed by the 
Minho University in Portugal. Jspell produces all 
possible labels for a lexical entry in the input and it 
provides a stem for each word with a different la-
bel. Upon each sentence in the lexicon input, the 
Morphology Analyzer examines each lexical entry 
and performs its analysis. 

Transfer Engine. This component was devel-
oped by the AVENUE group from Carnegie Mel-
lon University (Probst et al., 2002, Lavie et al., 
2003, Lavie et al., 2004, Lavie 2008) and applies 
the lexical transfer rules specified by the Lexicon 
component, i.e. the lexical entries in Portuguese 
are substituted by their translations in English. 
This component also applies the transfer grammar 
rules from Portuguese into English producing con-
stituents translated into the English structure. 
When the transfer stage has completed, we have a 
chart (hypergraph) in which each key contains an 
n-best beam for each non-terminal type of each 
source span. Each entry in the beam has a unifica-
tion feature structure and log-linear feature scores 
associated with it. 

Before decoding, the chart is turned into a lattice 
by removing hierarchical structure and respecting 
only the target-side ordering of the constituents 
produced by the grammar. The unification features 
and unification constraints on each rule can re-
move ungrammatical hypotheses from the search 
space. 

Decoder. For each sentence, the Decoder does a 
monotonic left-to-right decoding on the Transla-
tion Lattice with no reordering beyond what the 
grammar produced. For each source span, the de-
coder keeps the n most likely hypotheses.

According to Ma and McKeown (2009), in transla-
tions the main verb of a sentence is the most im-
portant element for the sentence comprehension. In 
Machine Translation, the goal is to produce under-
standable translations. Therefore, we started our 
experiment by adjusting the verbal tense rules be-
tween the Brazilian Portuguese and English. 

 Natural languages do not share the same prop-
erties concerning verbs. The pair of languages Por-
tuguese and English for example, has different 
systems of modality.  According to Palmer (1986), 
the English language has its system of modal verbs 
defined by can, could, will, would, may, must, 
might, ought, shall, should, need and dare. How-
ever, the Portuguese language has a system of 
mood consisting of indicative and subjunctive 
moods (Bechara, 2002).  

Moreover, the Brazilian Portuguese and the 
English languages present morphological differ-
ences between verbal forms. For example, many 
verbs in English have the following form: Base + 
{-s form (3rd person singular present)/PAST/-ing/-
ed} (Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973). Nonetheless, in 
Brazilian Portuguese the verbs present the follow-
ing form in most case: Base + thematic vowel + 
number/person agreement + tense/mood agree-
ment.  This verbal form is present in every tense in 
the indicative and subjunctive moods. 

In order not to lose any information concerning 
the distinction between verbal tenses from Brazil-
ian Portuguese to English, we built a corpus with 
sentences in all verbal tenses in Portuguese (Be-
chara, 2002) and manually mapped them into 
English. Each Portuguese verbal form was mapped 
into English in all their conceivable translations. 
This corpus is a sentence-level parallel corpus with 
original sentences in the Portuguese language and 
their respective translations. The main goal of 
building this corpus was to verify all possible 
translations between Portuguese and English ver-
bal tenses.  

3.1 Methodology 

Since this was a pilot experiment, we were inter-
ested in verifying if our changes improved the sys-
tem. This pilot experiment consists of translating a 
corpus containing all three verb conjugation 
classes in Portuguese: 1) First conjugation class: 
verbs ending in –AR; 2) Second conjugation class: 

59



verbs which end in –ER; and 3) Third Conjugation 
class: verbs ending in –IR, respecting each tense, 
mood and number in Stat-XFER system and then 
evaluating their results. 

To construct the three corpora – one corpus for 
each conjugation class – we extracted the 100 most 
frequent Portuguese verbs appearing in Google’s 
search engine3 in all three conjugation classes in 
Portuguese. The search for the most frequent Por-
tuguese verbs was done using a tool developed in 
Python and followed the following constrains: a) a 
result had to be an infinitive verb; b) had to be in 
the Portuguese language and c) had to be found in 
a Brazilian Web page. 

 From the one hundred most frequent Portu-
guese verbs in each conjugation class we manually 
built three corpora of all three verb conjugation 
classes in Portuguese, respecting each tense, mood, 
number, and person, and then a human translator 
mapped them into English through manual transla-
tion. Each corpus contains no more than three ex-
amples of each most frequent verb selected, 
resulting in 163 sentences. 

Once all verbal tenses were translated into Eng-
lish, we applied these three corpora to the Stat-
XFER system and evaluated all resulting transla-
tions using Meteor. Meteor is a metric for the eval-
uation of Machine Translation output. The metric 
is based on the harmonic mean of unigram preci-
sion and recall (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007). The 
Meteor scores are in a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 
means the translation is the farthest from the ref-
erence translation and 1 means the translation is 
most similar to a human translation.  

  After the evaluation, we initiated the improve-
ment of the grammar module with new syntactic 
transfer rules in order to deal with the problems 
presented by the differences between the verbal 
tenses. The transfer rules were manually developed 
and encoded how constituent structures in the 
source language transfer to the target language. In 
the beginning of our research, the system had 113 
such rules in its grammar, but with some modifica-
tions the system now has 152 rules concerning the 
mapping from Portuguese to English.  We add a 
rule for each tense in each conjugation class. Few 
rules address more than one tense. A Stat-XFER 
syntactic rule example is shown below.

3 ;;TL: WALK 
4 VP::VP [V]  [V] 
5 ( 
6 (X1::Y1) 
7 ((X1 tense) = c pres) 
8 ((X1 mood) =c (*NOT* subj)) 
9 ((Y1 tense) = pres) 
10 ((X0 number) = (X1 number)) 
11 ((X0 person) = (X1 person)) 
12 ) 

The first line is the name of rule, in this case 
VP, 2. The second and third lines are examples of 
transference between both languages, which means 
a source language (SL) will be encoded into a re-
spective target language (TL). The forth line indi-
cates that a simple verb in SL will be translated as 
a simple verb in TL as well.  

The condition of application of that rules is be-
tween parenthesis, shown in the fifth and twelfth 
lines.  In line six, inside these parentheses, it is 
indicated that the first element of the verbal phrase 
from source language, i.e. X1, will be converted as 
the first element of the verbal phrase in the target 
language, i.e. Y1. Line seven says that X1 must be 
in the present tense and line eight says it must not 
be a subjunctive mood. Line nine states that Y1 
must be in the present tense. Lines ten and eleven 
indicate that X1 will receive the number and per-
son from an element in the source language, X0 in 
this case. 

Another significant modification concerns the 
Bilingual phrasal lexicon. In the beginning of our 
research, the system had 56.665 entries with their 
respective translations. However, many of these 
lexical items presented improper translations, repe-
titions and lack of correct meanings. To help im-
prove the development of our system some 
modifications in this lexicon were required.  This 
word level lexicon is in constant modification with 
the inclusion of missing lexicon items, cleaning of 
repeated items and correction of the inappropriate 
ones. The Stat-XFER word-level lexicon has now 
57.315 entries with their respective translations. 

3.2 Results 

After the insertion of new syntactic rules, adjust-
ment of the existing (old) rules and the modifica-

60



tions in the lexicon, we translated the same three 
corpora again to evaluate the performance one 
more time. The comparative results of these two 
evaluations are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 be-
low.

Figure 2.The graphic shows evaluation results of a sam-
ple of 489 sentences distributed across all verbal tense, 
mood, number and person in English during the initial 
stage and the current stage of the development of the 
Stat-XFER system. Results are in a scale of 0 to 1. 0 
means the translation is the farthest from the reference 
translation and 1 means the translation is most corre-
lated to a human translation. Each entry in the picture 
corresponds to one sentence evaluated according to the 
Meteor metric, distributed in the x-axis (initial evalua-
tion) and the y-axis (current evaluation). The 45o line 
distinguishes those cases where performance of one 
evaluation was better than the other.  
 

Interesting results were collected in this experi-
ment. The new results show improvements in cor-
relation with translation references on the second 
and third conjugations (Table 1). The system 
modifications we have done so far yielded some 
improvements. The inclusion and correction of 
syntactic rules according to the differences be-
tween linguistic parameters of the languages is the 
natural way to improve the results of Meteor eval-
uation in Stat-XFER system. 

  However, it is also noticeable that in the first con-
jugation we observed a decline in the performance 
of the system. This was one of the interesting ob-
servations we made based on this study.  

To better study the effect of the inclusion of 
new grammar rules between verbal tenses, we per-
form a second evaluation of our system, now using 
a previously unseen corpus. This new corpus was 
build from FAPESP Magazine4, which is a bilin-
gual online publication designed for the Brazilian 
scientific community. We extracted 415 sentences 
from the Humanities section and translated them 
with the old and new syntactic rules to evaluate the 
performance of the system. The comparative re-
sults of these two evaluations are shown in Table 2 
below.

the system  
 

The two evaluations of the FAPESP Magazine 
corpus indicate that the insertion of new grammar 
rules presents significant improvement compared 
to the system in its initial state. It is important to 
note that these results validate our experiment and 
confirm the improvement of the system. We dis-
cuss our results in Section 4. 

4 Discussion  

An interesting observation is that in the corpus 
manually built for the experiment, the score of the 
first conjugation decreased (Table 1), while we 
expected that it should increase. We were surprised 
by this phenomenon and started investigating its 
causes. After preliminary studies, we now believe 
that this is due to a greater number of possible 
meanings that verbs from the first conjugation in 
Portuguese can assume, thus producing several 
translations in English, with smaller a correlation 
with respective human reference translations. 

According to Williams (1962), the endings of 
infinitive verbs in Portuguese are derived from 
Classical Latin. The first conjugation in Brazilian 
Portuguese also contains verbs borrowed from dif-

ferent languages, e.g. the English verb to delete 
has its correspondent deletar in Portuguese. 
Moreover, the creation of new verbs in Portuguese 
is always included in the first conjugation, sharing 
a common set of characteristic of verbs ended in –
AR. While the second and third conjugation 
classes tend to have a finite number of verbs given 
from Classical Latin, the first conjugation class is 
still increasing, unlike the second and third conju-
gations. These changes in verbs from the first 
conjugation classes may impact the development 
and evaluation of the system. 

Note that the corpora used to evaluate our sys-
tem are very small compared to corpora recom-
mend for Machine Translation evaluations. Since 
this was a pilot experiment, we were only inter-
ested in verifying if the questions we wanted to ask 
were answerable. Further validation will be per-
formed once more rules are added to the system 
and new human translations are included in the 
reference corpus. 

Lavie et al. (2004) applied a transfer-rule learn-
ing approach to this system in order to learn auto-
matically the transfer rules from Hebrew to 
English. We believe that this approach can be ap-
plied to the Portuguese-to-English system and it 
can improve the coverage of grammar rules.  

5 Conclusion 

The results of our experiment are very promising. 
We could observe a clear improvement in the per-
formance of the system after syntactic rules were 
added to its grammar module. The new syntactic 
rules concerning the verbal tenses improved sys-
tem performance, but also indicated that there is 
significant room for improvements in the Stat-
XFER system. In particular, improving the transfer 
rules in other aspects beyond the Verbal tense is a 
promising area of future research. 

Although this research is in a preliminary stage, 
we already made interesting linguistic observations 
about Portuguese verbs from first conjugation con-
cerning the development of Machine Translation 
systems. We believe this is a general issue that 
should concern every designer of Machine Trans-
lation system of the Brazilian Portuguese lan-
guage. We are very excited about the future stages 
of this study, and its potential contribution to the 

linguistic perspective of the field of Machine 
Translation.
