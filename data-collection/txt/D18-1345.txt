Abstract

Character-level patterns have been widely
used as features in English Named Entity
Recognition (NER) systems. However, to date
there has been no direct investigation of the
inherent differences between name and non-
name tokens in text, nor whether this property
holds across multiple languages. This paper
analyzes the capabilities of corpus-agnostic
Character-level Language Models (CLMs) in
the binary task of distinguishing name to-
kens from non-name tokens. We demonstrate
that CLMs provide a simple and powerful
model for capturing these differences, identi-
fying named entity tokens in a diverse set of
languages at close to the performance of full
NER systems. Moreover, by adding very sim-
ple CLM-based features we can significantly
improve the performance of an off-the-shelf
NER system for multiple languages.1

1 Introduction

In English, there is strong empirical evidence that
the character sequences that make up proper nouns
tend to be distinctive. Even divorced of con-
text, a human reader can predict that “hoeksten-
berger” is an entity, but “abstractually”2 is not.
Some NER research explores the use of character-
level features including capitalization, prefixes
and suffixes (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999; Rati-
nov and Roth, 2009), and character-level models
(CLMs) (Klein et al., 2003) to improve the perfor-
mance of NER, but to date there has been no sys-
tematic study isolating the utility of CLMs in cap-
turing distinctions between name and non-name
tokens in English or across other languages.

We conduct an experimental assessment of the
discriminative power of CLMs for a range of lan-

tity CLM for both sides. The graphs show the percent-
age of tokens (y axis) with different levels of CLM per-
plexities (x axis). The entity CLM gives a low aver-
age perplexity and small variance to entity tokens (left),
while giving non-entity tokens much higher perplexity
and higher variance (right).

guages: English, Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, Farsi,
Hindi, Somali, and Tagalog. These languages use
a variety of scripts and orthographic conventions
(for example, only three use capitalization), come
from different language families, and vary in their
morphological complexity. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLMs in distinguishing name to-
kens from non-name tokens, as illustrated by Fig-
ure 1, which shows perplexity histograms from a
CLM trained on entity tokens. Our models use
only individual tokens, but perform extremely well
in spite of taking no account of word context.

We then assess the utility of directly adding sim-
ple features based on this CLM implementation to
an existing NER system, and show that they have a
significant positive impact on performance across
many of the languages we tried. By adding very
simple CLM-based features to the system, our
scores approach those of a state-of-the-art NER
system (Lample et al., 2016) across multiple lan-
guages, demonstrating both the unique importance
and the broad utility of this approach.

2 Methods

2.1 Character Language Models

We propose a very simple model in which we train
an entity CLM on a list of entity tokens, and a non-
entity CLM on a list of non-entity tokens. Both
lists are unordered, with all entries treated inde-
pendently. Each token is split into characters and
treated as a “sentence” where the characters are
the “words.” For example, “Obama” is an entity
token, and is split into “O b a m a”. From these
examples we learn a score measuring how likely it
is that a sequence of characters forms an entity. At
test time, we also split each word into characters
and determine perplexity using the entity and non-
entity CLMs. We assign the label corresponding
to the lower perplexity CLM.

We experiment with four different kinds of lan-
guage model: N-gram model, Skip-gram model,
Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW), and
Log-Bilinear model (LB). We demonstrate that the
N-gram model is best suited for this task.

Following Peng and Roth (2016), we implement
N-gram using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) with order
6 and Witten-Bell discounting.3 For Skip-Gram
and CBOW CLMs, we use the Gensim implemen-
tation (Rehurek and Sojka, 2010) for training and
inference, and we build the LB CLM using the
OxLM toolkit (Baltescu et al., 2014).

2.2 Data

To determine whether name identifiability applies
to languages other than English, we conduct ex-
periments on a range of languages for which
we had previously gathered resources (such as
Brown clusters): English, Amharic, Arabic, Ben-
gali, Farsi, Hindi, Somali, and Tagalog.

3We experimented with different orders on development
data, but found little difference between them.

For English, we use the original splits from
the ubiquitous CoNLL 2003 English dataset
(Sang and Meulder, 2003), which is a newswire
dataset annotated with Person (PER), Organiza-
tion (ORG), Location (LOC) and Miscellaneous
(MISC). To collect the list of entities and non-
entities as the training data for the Entity and
Non-Entity CLMs, we sample a large number of
PER/ORG/LOC and non-entities from Wikipedia,
using types derived from their corresponding Free-
Base entities (Ling and Weld, 2012).

For all other languages, we use a subset of the
corpora from the LORELEI project annotated for
the NER task (Strassel and Tracey, 2016). We
build our entity list using the tokens labeled as en-
tities in the training data, and our non-entity list
from the remaining tokens. These two lists are
then used to train two CLMs, as described above.

Our datasets vary in size of entity and non-entity
tokens, as shown in Table 1. The smallest, Farsi,
has 4.5K entity and 50K non-entity tokens; the
largest, English, has 29K entity and 170K non-
entity tokens.

3 CLM for Named Entity Identification

In this section, we first show the power of CLMs
for distinguishing between entity and non-entity
tokens in English, and then that this power is ro-
bust across a variety of languages.

We refer to this task as Named Entity Identifi-
cation (NEI), because we are concerned only with
finding an entity span, not its label. We differen-
tiate it from Named Entity Recognition (NER), in
which both span and label are required. To avoid
complicating this straightforward approach by re-
quiring a separate mention detection step, we eval-
uate at the token-level, as opposed to the more
common phrase-level evaluation. We also apply
one heuristic: if a word has length 1, we automat-
ically predict ‘O’ (or non-entity). This captures
most punctuation and words like ‘I’ and ‘a’.

Figure 1 shows that for the majority of entity
tokens, the entity CLM computes a relatively low
perplexity compared to non-entity tokens. Though
there also exist some non-entities with low entity
CLM perplexity, we can still reliably identify a
large proportion of non-entity words by setting a
threshold value for entity CLM perplexity. If a to-
ken perplexity lies above this threshold, we label
it as a non-entity token. The threshold is tuned on
development data.

baselines are also compared here: Capitalization tags a token in test as entity if it is capitalized; and Exact Match
keeps track of entities seen in training, tagging tokens in Test that exactly match some entity in Train. The bottom
section shows state-of-the-art models which use complex features for names, including contextual information.
Languages in order are: English, Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, Farsi, Hindi, Somali, and Tagalog. The rightmost
column is the average of all columns excluding English.

Since we also build a CLM for non-entities, we
can also compare the entity and non-entity per-
plexity scores for a token. For those tokens not
excluded using the threshold as described above,
we compare the perplexity scores of the two mod-
els and assign the label corresponding to the model
yielding the lower score.

We compare SRILM against Skip-gram and
CBOW, as implemented in Gensim, and the Log-
Bilinear (LB) model. We trained both CBOW and
Skip-gram with window size 3, and size 20. We
tuned LB, and report results with embedding size
150, and learning rate 0.1. Despite tuning the neu-
ral models, the simple N-gram model outperforms
them significantly, perhaps because of the rela-
tively small amount of training data.4

We compare the CLM’s Entity Identification
against two state-of-the-art NER systems: Cog-
CompNER (Khashabi et al., 2018) and LSTM-
CRF (Lample et al., 2016). We train the NER sys-
tems as usual, but at test time we convert all pre-
dictions into binary token-level annotations to get
the final score. As Table 2 shows, the result of N-
gram CLM, which yields the highest performance,
is remarkably close to the result of state-of-the-
art NER systems (especially for English) given the
simplicity of the model.

4 Improving NER with CLM features

standard NER system with simple features based

found that the results were underwhelming.

on our entity/non-entity CLMs to improve perfor-
mance in many languages. Based on their superior
performance as reported in Section 3, we use the
N-gram CLMs.

4.1 Features

We define three simple features that capture infor-
mation provided by CLMs and which we expect to
be useful for NER.

Entity Feature We define one “isEntity” fea-
ture based on the perplexities of the entity and
non-entity CLMs. We compare the perplexity cal-
culated by entity CLM and non-entity CLM de-
scribed in Section 3, and return a boolean value
indicating whether the entity CLM score is lower.

Language Features We define two language-
related features: “isArabic” and “isRussian”. We
observe that there are many names in English
text that originate from other languages, result-
ing in very different orthography than native En-
glish names. We therefore build two language-
based CLMs for Arabic and Russian. We collect a
list of Arabic names and a list of Russian names
by scraping name-related websites, and train an
Arabic CLM and a Russian CLM. For each to-
ken, when the perplexity of either the Arabic or
the Russian CLM is lower than the perplexity of
the Non-Entity CLM, we return True, indicating
that this entity is likely to be a name from Ara-
bic/Russian. Otherwise, we return False.

Table 3: NER results on 8 languages show that even a simplistic addition of CLM features to a standard NER
model boosts performance. CogCompNER is run with standard features, including Brown clusters; (Lample et al.,
2016) is run with default parameters and pre-trained embeddings. Unseen refers to performance on named entities
in Test that were not seen in the training data. Full is performance on all entities in Test. Averages are computed
over all languages other than English.

4.2 Experiments

We use CogCompNER (Khashabi et al., 2018) as
our baseline NER system because it allows easy
integration of new features, and evaluate on the
same datasets as before. For English, we add all
features described above. For other languages, due
to the limited training data, we only use the “isEn-
tity” feature. We compare with the state-of-the-
art character-level neural NER system of (Lample
et al., 2016), which inherently encodes compara-
ble information to CLMs, as a way to investigate
how much of that system’s performance can be at-
tributed directly to name-internal structure.

The results in Table 3 show that for six of the
eight languages we studied, the baseline NER can
be significantly improved by adding simple CLM
features; for English and Arabic, it performs bet-
ter even than the neural NER model of (Lample
et al., 2016). For Tagalog, however, adding CLM
features actually impairs system performance.

In the same table, the rows marked “unseen”
report systems’ performance on named entities in
Test that were not seen in the training data. This
setting more directly assesses the robustness of a
system to identify named entities in new data. By
this measure, Farsi NER is not improved by name-
only CLM features and Tagalog is impaired. Ben-
efits for English, Hindi, and Somali are limited,
but are quite significant for Amharic, Arabic, and
Bengali.

5 Discussion

Our results demonstrate the power of CLMs for
recognizing named entity tokens in a diverse range
of languages, and that in many cases they can im-
prove off-the-shelf NER system performance even

when integrated in a simplistic way.
However, the results from Section 4.2 show that

this is not true for all languages, especially when
only considering unseen entities in Test: Tagalog
and Farsi do not follow the trend for the other lan-
guages we assessed even though CLM performs
well for Named Entity Identification.

While the end-to-end model developed by
(Lample et al., 2016) clearly includes informa-
tion comparable to that in the CLM, it requires
a fully annotated NER corpus, takes significant
time and computational resources to train, and is
non-trivial to integrate into a new NER system.
The CLM approach captures a very large fraction
of the entity/non-entity distinction capacity of full
NER systems, and can be rapidly trained using
only entity and non-entity token lists – i.e., it is
corpus-agnostic. For some languages it can be
used directly to improve NER performance; for
others (such as Tagalog), the strong NEI perfor-
mance indicates that while it does not immediately
boost performance, it can ultimately be used to im-
prove NER there too.

6 Related Work

Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) is one of the earli-
est works to use character-based features (charac-
ter tries) for NER. The approach of Klein et al.
(2003) was one of the original papers in the
CoNLL 2003 NER shared task. Their approach,
which ranked in the top 3 for both English and
German shared tasks, used character-based fea-
tures for NER. They do two experiments: one with
a character-based HMM, another with using char-
acter n-grams as features to a maximum entropy
model. The focus on character-level patterns is

similar to our work, but without the specific ex-
ploration of language models alone.

Using character-based models similar to ours,
Smarr and Manning (2002) show that unseen noun
phrases can be accurately classified into a small
number of categories using only a character-based
model independent of context. We tackle a some-
what more challenging task of distinguishing enti-
ties from non-entities. Lample et al. (2016) use
character embeddings in an LSTM-CRF model.
Their ablation studies show that character-level
features improve performance significantly.

We are not aware of any work that directly eval-
uates CLMs for identifying name tokens, nor of
work that demonstrates the utility of character-
level information for identifying names in multi-
ple languages.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We have shown, in a series of simple experiments,
that in many languages names are identifiable by
character patterns alone, and that character level
patterns have strong potential for building better
NER systems.

In the future, we plan to make a more thorough
analysis of reasons for the high variance in NER
performance. In particular, we will study why it is
possible, as with Tagalog, to have high Named En-
tity Identification results but lose points in NER.
