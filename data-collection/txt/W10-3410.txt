Abstract 
We report on a user needs investigation 
carried out in the framework of the pro-
ject EKFRASIS1 that developed a plat-
form for supporting authoring work in 
Modern Greek. The platform had as a 
backbone a conceptually organised dic-
tionary enhanced with rich lexicographic 
and morphosyntactic information. Or-
ganisation of information and encoding 
drew on Semantic Web technologies (on-
tologies). Users were all professional au-
thors (of literature, editors, translators, 
journalists) working for well-established 
firms. They were all familiar with 
printed conceptually organized dictionar-
ies while most of them used a computer. 
They were asked to specify how the plat-
form would be helpful to them when 
they searched for a word for which they 
had only vague or few clues, a situation 
that was familiar to all of them. Users 
preferred to have, in a first step, easy ac-
cess to limited but to-the-point lexical in-
formation while access to rich semantic 
information should be provided at a sec-
ond step. They were interested in rich 
lexical material although they were not 
really able to identify the relations that 
would help them retrieve it.  They 
strongly preferred an organization of ma-
terial by concept and PoS and appreci-

ated easy access to normative informa-
tion. 

1 Introduction 
We present an investigation of user needs that 

was conducted in the process of developing a 
platform for supporting authoring work in Mod-
ern Greek. One main component of this platform 
is the dictionary “EKFRASIS” (literally ‘expres-
sion’). EKFRASIS exploits technology and ideas 
developed for the Semantic Web (Guarino and 
Welty, 2002) to encode a conceptually organized 
dictionary enriched with translations as well as a 
wealth of lexicographic and morphosyntactic 
information. The overall organisation of the dic-
tionary and, partially of the platform, aims at 
helping the user who needs a word but has few 
clues or just guesses about it and about its way 
of use.   
The interviewed users were all professionals: 

journalists, translators, editors and authors of 
literature.  
In this survey, we aimed to map user expecta-

tions concerning interaction with the dictionary 
rather than to look for appropriate ways for 
populating it. Of course, some of the conclusions 
reached here may be useful for collecting lin-
guistic material as well.  
2 The “recollection problem” 
Authors (of any type of text) often find them-

selves in the uncomfortable position whereby 
they remember or feel that the “right” word ex-
ists but they can not recall it.  Here, we will call 
this situation the “recollection problem”. Alpha-
betically organised dictionaries are of little help 

66



in such situations. Of course, the recollection 
problem is a well known one (for a discussion, 
see Zock and Bilac, 2004; Zock and Schwab, 
2008).  Works with an international reputation 
have tried to face it and, of course, Roget’s The-
saurus, a printed dictionary, and WordNet and 
EuroWordNet, both digital ones, spring easily to 
mind. An interesting difference between the two 
dictionaries is exactly about the interaction with 
the user: while in Roget’s lexical relations are 
left implicit and material is explicit, in WordNet 
one has to go via lexical relations such as “hy-
ponymy” and “sister term” to find the material. 
In short, in Roget’s one is given the material di-
rectly and no previous familiarity with taxono-
mies is required while in WordNet one has to 
guess what taxonomic labels can offer in each 
case. 
Furthermore, just finding a word is often not 

enough to guarantee confidence in its usage, so 
information provided by an assortment of rele-
vant sources is indispensable.  Of course, printed 
dictionaries would expand to unmanageable vol-
ume if they accommodated all necessary infor-
mation, but digital dictionaries are not subject to 
such limitations. For instance, Roget’s does not 
provide syntactic information but WordNet does. 
Digital lexica that have been compiled for NLP 
purposes such as Acquilex (Briscoe et al., 1993) 
and Simple have tried to accommodate semantic, 
syntactic, morphological and pragmatic informa-
tion structured in a principled way and make it 
available to machines. In the Semantic Web era, 
efforts to better axiomatise the established re-
sources have been made (Gangemi et al., 200; 
Old, 2004) as well as to combine detailed lin-
guistic with ontological information for the pur-
poses of Machine Translation (Nirenburg and 
Raskin, 2004). Such efforts were oriented to 
NLP mainly. 
 As regards human users, Roget’s success 

suggests that while wealth of material and good 
organisation of it matters, it is not necessary to 
present explicitly the relations among words in a 
‘concept’2 in order to provide a good solution to 
the recollection problem. On the other hand, 
humans do instinctively look for words on the

that are conceptually related. Such sets are defined in 
Roget’s Thesaurus and the “Onomasticon”. 

basis of domain relations several of which can 
be argued to mirror (aspects of) human cognition 
(Gaume et al., 2003; Kremer et al., 2008). Fur-
thermore, the data we will present here indicate 
that searching for a word is also a matter of habit 
and training, having a lot to do with one’s pro-
fession and familiarity with certain types of dic-
tionary.  
As already said, we report on a user require-

ment survey that was conducted in the frame-
work of the project EKFRASIS. Our aim was 
primarily to see how the lexicographic material 
should be presented to the user; however, we 
were also interested in fine-tuning our ideas 
about the nature of the material required. We 
start with a brief presentation of the main ideas 
behind the dictionary EKFRASIS. Next, we talk 
about how we organized the survey. For each 
group of questions addressed to the users, we 
present and comment their responses. Finally, 
we present our conclusions and decisions as re-
gards the architecture of the dictionary EKFRA-
SIS. 
3 About EKFRASIS 
A few words about the dictionary EKFRASIS 

are in order to set the context of the survey dis-
cussed in this paper. 
EKFRASIS is a digital lexicon of Modern 

Greek (MG). 3  MG market makes available 
mainly alphabetically ordered printed dictionar-
ies and, more recently, dictionaries of synonyms 
and antonyms. There is no dictionary of MG that 
combines lexicographic with semantic and mor-
phosyntactic information.  
There is one excellent thesaurus of Modern 

Greek, the “Onomasticon” by Theofilos 
Vostantzoglou, published back in 1962. “Ono-
masticon” enjoys great reputation among Greek 
intellectuals. T. Vostantzoglou drew a lot on Ro-
get’s Thesaurus. His material is organized in 
concepts and each concept is further structured 
into smaller groups of words. Notably, he intro-
duced certain innovations of his own: contrastive 
presentation of concepts, eg “Joking” and 
“Speaking seriously” are presented contrastively 
on the same page using a special format, short 
definition of groups of words that form a con-
cept and information on style. In addition, spe-

cial attention is given to expressions and prov-
erbs.  Links between concepts exist at lexical 
level introducing, in this way, relations among 
words in different concepts. There is no actual 
typology of these relations which remain im-
plicit to the user. Very much like Roget’s, all the 
words in the conceptually organized part of the 
Onomasticon are also listed in alphabetical order 
in the second half of the book. Each word is in-
dexed for the set of concepts it belongs.  
In EKFRASIS we understand “conceptual” 

organization as the result of the interplay of a set 
of domain relations. In addition, EKFRASIS is 
planned to help with the usage of words by pro-
viding definition of concepts, glosses and trans-
lation of words, usage examples and full mor-
phosyntactic information. In our survey, we ex-
posed the users to large amounts of information 
organized in more than one ways and asked 
them whether such a tool would be useful to 
them in their professional lives. Throughout the 
present discussion, we ask the reader to keep in 
mind that we aim at developing a resource that 
would be of use to a wide audience. 
4 The Survey 
Although the project EKFRASIS is addressed to 
anyone who writes in Modern Greek, we thought 
that professionals would have a clearer view of 
the authoring procedure and its needs.  

 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 1. Composition of the user group 
 
Table 1 shows the composition of the user 

group. Each group of professionals works under 
different conditions and has different require-
ments. In general, journalists and translators 
work under time pressure while authors of litera-
ture and editors are more concerned with linguis-
tic and aesthetic quality. In the user group, au-
thors, literature translators and editors are well 
known intellectuals of the country publishing 
with the publishing house “Kastaniotis” 
(http://www. kastaniotis.com/), industrial 
translators work for a medium size firm ( 
http://www.orco.gr/ loc/frameset-gr.html? 

navbar-gr.html&0) and journalists work for the 
prestigious daily newspaper “I Kathimerini” 
(http://www.kathimerini.gr/). 
Users were interviewed by teams of research-

ers and 
• each of the literature authors and editors 
were interviewed personally  

• industrial translators and journalists were 
interviewed in groups according to their 
own requirement. 

To each person or group a presentation of the 
aims of the project was given and then, a spe-
cially developed mock-up of a couple of usage 
cases of the authoring tool was presented. We 
used a different mock-up (.ppt file) for each au-
thor and editor and for each of the journalist and 
translator groups because EKFRASIS is a novel 
application by Modern Greek standards and, 
since no user had some relevant experience, ver-
bal description would not help at all. The presen-
tations were followed by discussion and an in-
terview that was taped and, finally, the users 
were asked to fill a questionnaire. Each user (au-
thor, editor, translator, journalist) filled in a 
separate questionnaire.  
For the first part of the mock-up, pieces of 

text produced by each one of the authors, a piece 
of Greek translation from the site of Nokia and a 
piece from “I Kathimerini” were selected to de-
velop the presentation that relied on the follow-
ing scenario: hypothetically, when they devel-
oped the particular text, the authors experienced 
the recollection problem and used EKFRASIS to 
find a couple of words. They started their search 
with an input word of somehow related meaning 
to the intended one but not necessarily of the 
same PoS. We present as an example extracts 
from the mock-up developed for one of the au-
thors of literature.  
In Figure 1 the author uses the noun mania as 

an input word.  EKFRASIS returns the names 
and definitions of all the concepts where the in-
put word occurs (gray area on the left). The con-
cepts are not necessarily related to each other. 
Here, the first one corresponds to ‘proclivity, 
propensity’, the second to ‘urge’, the third to 
‘mania’ as a disorder, the fourth to ‘mania, pas-
sion’, the fifth to ‘fury’, the sixth to ‘wrath’ and 
the seventh to ‘love’. On the right, for each con-
cept a set of semantically relevant words are

given, all of the same PoS with the input one 
(here, a noun). For instance, concept 6 is labeled 
οργή ‘wrath’ and the words given are οργή

αγανάκτηση (being indignant), µανία ‘mania’.

Figure 2.  The right hand column consists of 
the set of related concepts within  

a PoS (noun here) 
 

In this screen, the concepts are related to each 
other as they all are about wrath. The concepts 
in successive order are ‘wrath’, ‘sudden expres-
sion of wrath’, ‘strong wrath’, ‘luck of wrath’, 
‘what causes wrath’, ‘to become furious easily’, 
’extreme wrath’ and are listed on the right hand 
column. The list of PoS (noun, verb, adjective, 
adverb, expressions) is on the left hand column. 
In Figure 2, the activated PoS is ‘noun’, how-
ever, the user could activate any other PoS, an 
option he picks in Figure 4, where he activates 
the PoS ‘verb’. In our hypothetical scenario, the 

user selects the 7th concept (extreme wrath) and 
receives the set of synonyms and antonyms, en-
closed in the boxes in Figure 3. Antonyms are 
given in the box at the bottom of the screen. The 
user stores these findings and carries on with the 
PoS ‘verb’ (Figure 4).

‘extreme wrath’ 
 

This PoS comprises only one concept, so the 
system shows the box with the lexical material. 
There is plenty of lexical material so the indica-
tion ‘more’ guides the user who would require 
access to more information.  
Two series of user responses were elicited -- 

one with the questionnaire and one with the in-
terviews. The results of the interviews were not 
directly measurable but they greatly helped to 
clarify the picture. In what follows we will pre-
sent the measurable results but in the conclu-
sions, we will draw on the interviews as well. 
The questionnaire included different types of 

question (multiple choice questions, questions 
with graded answers, open questions). In this 
report we are interested in the parts of the ques-

69



tionnaire on (i) the contribution of dictionaries 
and spelling checkers to authoring work (ii) how 
authors experience the recollection problem and 
(iii) efficient searching for words. 
5 Questioning the users 
5.1 Contribution of technology and dic-

tionaries to authoring work 
We first asked if professionals used computers 
and authoring aids.  
Nearly 100% of users worked on a computer. 
All users with the exception of journalists used 
general language dictionaries or specialized ones 
including dictionaries of synonyms (Table 2). 
Journalists, on the other hand, seemed to pay 
attention mainly in word spelling.

Table 2. Usage of authoring aids 
 
Why do users use dictionaries and spelling 

checkers? We asked the users to give a yes/no 
answer to two contradictory statements. So, to 
the statement “I can find easily what I look for in 
dictionaries and spelling checkers” all other us-
ers and 2 journalists answered “yes”. However, 
to the opposite statement “I can not find easily 
what I look for in dictionaries and spelling 
checkers” no journalists replied while one editor 
and 3 authors replied “yes”. So, the picture is 
somehow messed up but in the overall it shows 
that people have formed expectations about dic-
tionaries and look for certain types of informa-
tion that they more or less find. In addition, 1 
editor, 4 translators, 3 authors and 4 journalists 
stated that dictionaries and spelling checkers 
speed up their work.  
So, there is some kind of information in the 

dictionaries and the spelling checkers that helps 
and speeds up authoring work. Certainly, these 
resources provide little help with the recollection 
problem. So, in the next parts of the question-

naire we set out to make clear what kind of in-
formation users considered useful in the diction-
aries and  what else they would like to find and 
how. Mock-up presentations were of crucial help 
in this task. 
5.2 Experiencing the recollection problem 
We asked how often and in which way users ex-
perienced the recollection problem. Users turned 
out to be quite familiar with experiences such as 
the following: (i) looking for a synonym (ii) en-
tertaining the belief that a word exists but not 
being able to identify it (iii) having a general 
notion in mind but not being able to find words 
that ground it properly (Table 3).

Table 3. The recollection problem 

 
It is clear that professional demands influence 

authoring behavior at work: authors of literature, 
editors and translators are more into searching 
for the appropriate word than journalists. Ac-
cording to the users, two are the main motives 
for searching words: (i) precision (ii) aesthetics 
(the example put forward by the users was the 
repetition of a word). 
It is also interesting that the answers already 

point to some important lexical relations, namely 
synonymy and hypernymy / hyponymy,   which 
can be used for both constructing and navigating 
a resource (and have been used in many diction-
aries, for instance in WordNet).  
 

5.3 Searching for lexical information 
Despite the fact that answers such as “heard in 
the past” and “general notion” (Table 3) indicate 
that a variety of semantic relations can be used 
for searching for a word, it was not easy for the 
users to imagine which those relations would be. 
This became obvious because 

• users were able to fill in the part of the 
questionnaire on searching only after they 

70



had seen the mock-up that presented them 
with searching strategies other than al-
phabetical listing 

• although they had twice in the question-
naire the opportunity to describe some 
way of searching for words other than the 
ones suggested in the mock-up (see be-
low) they did not do it –despite the fact 
that interviews lasted for about 2.00 hours 
each on the average. 

Although they did not identify alternative 
searching strategies, they in the overall wel-
comed the possibility of using morphologically 
(Table 4) and pragmatically (Table 5) related 
words for dealing with the recollection problem.  
The example given to the users for illustrating 

morphologically related words was the triple 
adopt->adoption->adopted. The users were 
asked whether they would like the dictionary to 
ensure that such sequences would be automati-
cally offered.

Of the relations named explicitly in the ques-

likely one to be used for helping with the recol-
lection problem (Table 6).  
Hypernymy/hyponymy (Table 7) and an-

tonymy (Table 8) were in the overall considered 
less useful for the recollection problem than 
synonymy, but still a high percentage voted for 
them.

• B. Only the linguistic material in the same

betical order

• C. All linguistic material pops up in the 
form of a semantic tree4 together with PoS

tual organization of the dictionary 

• D. Only the part of the tree that belongs to 
the PoS of the input word pops up 

In fact, options A and C are opposed to op-
tions B and D in that the first pair offers imme-
diate access to the whole lot of the related lexical 
material while the second pair only to the se-
mantically related words in the same PoS with 
the input word---practically, its synonyms. In 
Table 9.a. we sum the answers according to this 
division. While the A&C option was preferred 
by 62% of the users, the fact that a good 38% 
has chosen the B&D option had to be taken into 
account.

A compromising solution to this split of re-
quirements is to present first the minimal neces-
sary information, practically the synonyms of the 
input word, and then allow users navigate 
through the whole lot of it.   
Organisation of information in the form of a 

‘semantic tree’ seems more popular than 
simple alphabetical presentation of material. 
Still, some users prefer information to be pre-
sented as it always had, in alphabetical order, 
without any other complication.

4 ‘Semantic tree’ is a description of the situation in 
Figure 2 where words are organized in concepts indi-
cated with the labels on the left hand column). 

The recollection problem concerns both one 
word units and expressions or collocates as is 
clearly indicated in Table 10 and Table 11. The 
question asked here was “How often do you look 
for an expression / a collocate?”.  
We must note here that, ahead of its time, 
Onomasticon puts special emphasis on both 
types of information. Usage examples (Table 12) 
were requested mainly by translators and authors 
while glosses (Table 13) turned out to be of me-
dium interest.

On the other hand, users were interested in in-

flection (Table 14) and spelling (Table 15) in-
formation, as well as “the right context of usage” 
(Table 16) of words or expressions.

This comes as no surprise because Modern 
Greek reflects the long history of the language in 
several, often confusing ways: 

• by providing more than one spellings for a 
word, eg µείγµα / µίγµα (mixture) 

• by being heavily inflected with many 
types for the same set of PoS and gram-
matical features, eg  
έτρωγαν, τρώγαν, τρώγανε 
eat – 3rd, plural, past continuous 

 
Furthermore, the different forms are related 

with different styles, for instance in the example 
above the first form is considered the standard 
and the last the colloquial one.

Table 16. Right context of usage 
 
Naturally, editors need the particular facilities 

less than the other groups given their specialty. 
6 Conclusions and decisions 
The professional occupation of the users 
seemed to determine the kind of available au-
thoring aids they preferred. This may be due to 
the fact that they work under serious time pres-
sure. However, they too experienced the recol-
lection problem and would take advantage of 
domain relations to solve it. Editors require the 
least normative and usage information. Authors 
and translators seem to appreciate all types of 
information. Translators also stressed that effi-
cient presentation of information is important, 
probably because they use translation aids regu-
larly. 

On the basis of the questionnaire and the inter-
views, we conclude that the features of the dic-
tionary that would be attractive to the majority 
of users are: 

• Easy access to limited but to-the-point 
lexical information: the most usable 
synonyms and the most useful derivatives   

• Access to rich semantic information 
must be provided to those interested, al-
though at a second step. Users are more 
interested in the lexical material than 
the labeling of semantic relations 

• Categorisation of lexical material by 
PoS. The PoS of the input word pops up 
first but all the other PoS in the same con-
cept are available 

• Easy access to normative information 
given the particularities of Modern Greek 
in morphology and syntax  

On the basis of the above general conclusions, 
EKFRASIS interface design would satisfy the 
following minimum requirements: 

• All concepts to which an input word be-
longs are shown at the first step of the 
search,  together with the synonyms of the 
word in each concept 

• Once a concept is selected, all existing 
sub-concepts are presented  

• If no sub-concepts exist, all PoS in a con-
cept are made available to the user who 
sees the concept definition and the set of 
synonyms for each PoS (if they exist) 

• Once a word is selected all material about 
it pops up: gloss, example of usage, lexi-
cal relations, inflection, syntactic proper-
ties, collocations, translation  

Figure 5 is an extract from a mock-up where 
the hypothetical user has retrieved the multiword 
expression φέρνω στο φως ‘bring to light’. In-
formation given includes: gloss, synonyms 
(‘present’, ‘give away’, ‘make something visi-
ble’, ‘make something obvious’),  inflection in-
formation (concerning tense formation) and hints 
on its the usage. Users agreed that for each word 
an exhaustive summary of its properties should 
be provided.
