Abstract

We invent referential translation machines
(RTMs), a computational model for identify-
ing the translation acts between any two data
sets with respect to a reference corpus se-
lected in the same domain, which can be used
for automatically grading student answers.
RTMs make quality and semantic similarity
judgments possible by using retrieved rele-
vant training data as interpretants for reach-
ing shared semantics. An MTPP (machine
translation performance predictor) model de-
rives features measuring the closeness of the
test sentences to the training data, the diffi-
culty of translating them, and the presence of
acts of translation involved. We view question
answering as translation from the question to
the answer, from the question to the reference
answer, from the answer to the reference an-
swer, or from the question and the answer to
the reference answer. Each view is modeled
by an RTM model, giving us a new perspective
on the ternary relationship between the ques-
tion, the answer, and the reference answer. We
show that all RTM models contribute and a
prediction model based on all four perspec-
tives performs the best. Our prediction model
is the 2nd best system on some tasks according
to the official results of the Student Response
Analysis (SRA 2013) challenge.

1 Automatically Grading Student Answers

We introduce a fully automated student answer
grader that performs well in the student response
analysis (SRA) task (Dzikovska et al., 2013) and es-
pecially well in tasks with unseen answers. Auto-

matic grading can be used for assessing the level of
competency for students and estimating the required
tutoring effort in e-learning platforms. It can also
be used to adapt questions according to the average
student performance. Low scored topics can be dis-
cussed further in classrooms, enhancing the overall
coverage of the course material.

The quality estimation task (QET) (Callison-
Burch et al., 2012) aims to develop quality indica-
tors for translations at the sentence-level and pre-
dictors without access to the reference. Bicici et
al. (2013) develop a top performing machine transla-
tion performance predictor (MTPP), which uses ma-
chine learning models over features measuring how
well the test set matches the training set relying on
extrinsic and language independent features.

The student response analysis (SRA)
task (Dzikovska et al., 2013) addresses the fol-
lowing problem. Given a question, a known correct
reference answer, and a student answer, assess the
correctness of the student’s answer. The student
answers are categorized as correct, partially correct
incomplete, contradictory, irrelevant, or non do-
main, in the 5-way task; as correct, contradictory,
or incorrect in the 3-way task; and as correct or
incorrect in the 2-way task.

The student answer correctness prediction prob-
lem involves finding a function f approximating the
student answer correctness given the question (Q),
the answer (A), and the reference answer (R):

f(Q,A,R) ≈ q(A,R). (1)

We approach f as a supervised learning problem
with (Q, A, R, q(A,R)) tuples being the training

585



data and q(A,R) being the target correctness score.
We model the problem as a translation task where

one possible interpretation is translating Q (source
to translate, S) to R (target translation, T) and evalu-
ating with A (as reference target, RT) (QRA). Since
the information appearing in the question may be re-
peated in the reference answer or may be omitted in
the student answer, it also makes sense to concate-
nate Q and A when translating to R (QARQA). We
obtain 4 different perspectives on the ternary rela-
tionship between Q, A, and R depending on how we
model their relationship as an instance of translation:

QAR : S = Q, T = A, RT = R.
QRA : S = Q, T = R, RT = A.
ARA : S = A, T = R, RT = A.

QARQA : S = Q+A, T = R, RT = Q+A.

2 The Machine Translation Performance
Predictor (MTPP)

In machine translation (MT), pairs of source and tar-
get sentences are used for training statistical MT
(SMT) models. SMT system performance is af-
fected by the amount of training data used as well
as the closeness of the test set to the training set.
MTPP (Biçici et al., 2013) is a top performing ma-
chine translation performance predictor, which uses
machine learning models over features measuring
how well the test set matches the training set to pre-
dict the quality of a translation without using a ref-
erence translation. MTPP measures the coverage of
individual test sentence features and syntactic struc-
tures found in the training set and derives feature
functions measuring the closeness of test sentences
to the available training data, the difficulty of trans-
lating the sentence, and the presence of acts of trans-
lation involved.

Features for Translation Acts

MTPP uses n-gram features defined over text or
common cover link (CCL) (Seginer, 2007) struc-
tures as the basic units of information over which
similarity calculations are made. Unsupervised
parsing with CCL extracts links from base words
to head words, which allow us to obtain structures
representing the grammatical information instanti-
ated in the training and test data. Feature functions
use statistics involving the training set and the test

sentences to determine their closeness. Since they
are language independent, MTPP allows quality es-
timation to be performed extrinsically. Categories
for the 283 features used are listed below and their
detailed descriptions are presented in (Biçici et al.,
2013) where the number of features are given in {#}.

• Coverage {110}: Measures the degree to
which the test features are found in the train-
ing set for both S ({56}) and T ({54}).
• Synthetic Translation Performance {6}: Calcu-

lates translation scores achievable according to
the n-gram coverage.
• Length {4}: Calculates the number of words

and characters for S and T and their ratios.
• Feature Vector Similarity {16}: Calculates the

similarities between vector representations.
• Perplexity {90}: Measures the fluency of the

sentences according to language models (LM).
We use both forward ({30}) and backward
({15}) LM based features for S and T.
• Entropy {4}: Calculates the distributional sim-

ilarity of test sentences to the training set.
• Retrieval Closeness {24}: Measures the de-

gree to which sentences close to the test set are
found in the training set.
• Diversity {6}: Measures the diversity of co-

occurring features in the training set.
• IBM1 Translation Probability {16}: Calculates

the translation probability of test sentences us-
ing the training set (Brown et al., 1993).
• Minimum Bayes Retrieval Risk {4}: Calculates

the translation probability for the translation
having the minimum Bayes risk among the re-
trieved training instances.
• Sentence Translation Performance {3}: Calcu-

lates translation scores obtained according to
q(T,R) using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
NIST (Doddington, 2002), or F1 (Biçici and
Yuret, 2011b) for q.

3 Referential Translation Machine (RTM)

Referential translation machines (RTMs) we de-
velop provide a computational model for quality and
semantic similarity judgments using retrieval of rel-
evant training data (Biçici and Yuret, 2011a; Biçici,
2011) as interpretants for reaching shared seman-
tics (Biçici, 2008). We show that RTM achieves

586



very good performance in judging the semantic sim-
ilarity of sentences (Biçici and van Genabith, 2013)
and we can also use RTM to automatically assess
the correctness of student answers to obtain better
results than the baselines proposed by (Dzikovska et
al., 2012), which achieve the best performance on
some tasks (Dzikovska et al., 2013).

RTM is a computational model for identifying the
acts of translation for translating between any given
two data sets with respect to a reference corpus se-
lected in the same domain. RTM can be used for
automatically grading student answers. An RTM
model is based on the selection of common train-
ing data relevant and close to both the training set
and the test set where the selected relevant set of
instances are called the interpretants. Interpretants
allow shared semantics to be possible by behaving
as a reference point for similarity judgments and
providing the context. In semiotics, an interpretant
I interprets the signs used to refer to the real ob-
jects (Biçici, 2008). RTMs provide a model for com-
putational semantics using interpretants as a refer-
ence according to which semantic judgments with
translation acts are made. Each RTM model is a data
translation model between the instances in the train-
ing set and the test set. We use the FDA (Feature De-
cay Algorithms) instance selection model for select-
ing the interpretants (Biçici and Yuret, 2011a) from a
given corpus, which can be monolingual when mod-
eling paraphrasing acts, in which case the MTPP
model is built using the interpretants themselves as
both the source and the target side of the parallel cor-
pus. RTMs map the training and test data to a space
where translation acts can be identified. We view
that acts of translation are ubiquitously used during
communication:

Every act of communication is an act of
translation (Bliss, 2012).

Translation need not be between different languages
and paraphrasing or communication also contain
acts of translation. When creating sentences, we use
our background knowledge and translate informa-
tion content according to the current context.

Given a training set train, a test set test, and
some monolingual corpus C, preferably in the same
domain as the training and test sets, the RTM steps
are:

1. T = train ∪ test.
2. select(T, C)→ I
3. MTPP(I,train)→ Ftrain
4. MTPP(I,test)→ Ftest

Step 2 selects the interpretants, I, relevant to the
instances in the combined training and test data.
Steps 3 and 4 use I to map train and test to
a new space where similarities between the transla-
tion acts can be derived more easily. RTM relies on
the representativeness of I as a medium for building
translation models for translating between train
and test.

Our encouraging results in the SRA task provides
a greater understanding of the acts of translation we
ubiquitously use when communicating and how they
can be used to predict the performance of trans-
lation, judging the semantic similarity of text, and
evaluating the quality of student answers. RTM and
MTPP models are not data or language specific and
their modeling power and good performance are ap-
plicable across different domains and tasks. RTM
expands the applicability of MTPP by making it fea-
sible when making monolingual quality and simi-
larity judgments and it enhances the computational
scalability by building models over smaller but more
relevant training data as interpretants.

4 Experiments

SRA involves the prediction on Beetle (student
interactions when learning conceptual knowledge
in the basic electricity and electronics domain)
and SciEntsBank (science assessment questions)
datasets. SciEntsBank is harder due to contain-
ing questions from multiple domains (Dzikovska
et al., 2012). SRA challenge results are eval-
uated with the weighted average F1, Fw1 =

c∈C NcF1(c) and the macro average F1, F

m
1 =

|C|

∑
c∈C F1(c) (Dzikovska et al., 2012).

The lexical baseline system is based on measures
of lexical overlap using 4 features: the number of
overlapping words, F1, Lesk (Lesk, 1986), and co-
sine scores over the words when comparing A and
R ({4}) and Q and R ({4}). Lesk score is calculated
as: L(A,R) =

∑
p∈M |p|2/(|A||R|), where M con-

tains the maximal overlapping phrases that match in

587



A and R and |p| is the length of a phrase 1. This lex-
ical baseline is highly competitive: no submission
performed better in the 2-way Beetle unseen ques-
tions task.

4.1 RTM Models
We obtain CNGL results for the SRA task as fol-
lows. For each perspective described in Section 1,
we build an RTM model. Each RTM model views
the SRA task from a different perspective using the
283 features extracted dependent on the interpre-
tants using MTPP. We extract the features both on
the training set of 4155 and the test set of 1258 (Q,
A, R) sentence triples for the Beetle task and the
training set of 5251 and the test set of 5835 (Q, A,
R) sentence triples for the SciEntsBank task. The
addition of lexical overlap baseline features slightly
helps. We use the best reference answer if the refer-
ence answer is not identified in the training set.

The training corpus used is the English side of
an out-of-domain corpus on European parliamen-
tary discussions, Europarl (Callison-Burch et al.,
2012) 2, to which we also add the unique sentences
from R. In-domain corpora are likely to improve the
performance. We do not perform any linguistic pro-
cessing or use other external resources. We use only
extrinsic features, or features that are ignorant of any
information intrinsic to, and dependent on, a given
language or domain. We use the training corpus to
build a 5-gram target LM. We use ridge regression
(RR) and support vector regression (SVR) with RBF
kernel (Smola and Schölkopf, 2004). Both of these
models learn a regression function using the features
to estimate a numerical target value. The parameters
that govern the behavior of RR and SVR are the reg-
ularization λ for RR and the C, �, and γ parameters
for SVR. At testing time, the predictions are bound
so as to have scores in the range [0, 1], [0, 2], or [0, 4]
and rounded for finding the predicted category.

4.2 Training Results
Table 1 lists the 10-fold cross-validation (CV) re-
sults on the training set for RR and SVR for dif-
ferent RTM systems without the parameter op-
timization. As we combine different perspec-
tives, the performance improves and we use the

sions using RR for run 1, SVR for run 2. ARA per-
forms the best among individual perspectives. Each

We perform tuning on a subset of the Beetle
and SciEntsBank datasets separately after including
the baseline lexical overlap features and optimize
against the performance evaluated withR2, the coef-
ficient of determination. SVR performance is given
in Table 2. The CNGL system significantly outper-
forms the lexical overlap baseline in all tasks for
Beetle and in the 2-way task for SciEntsBank. For
3-way and 5-way, CNGL performs slightly better.

than the lexical baseline and the mean result in the
Beetle task but performs worse in the SciEntsBank.
The lower performance is likely to be due to using an
out-of-domain training corpus for building the RTM
models and on the uQ and uD tasks, it may also be
due to optimizing on the uA task only. The lower
performance in SciEntsBank is also due to multiple
question domains (Dzikovska et al., 2012).

We improve the RTM model with the expansion of

• Character n-grams {4}: Calculates the cosine

between the character n-grams (for n=2,3,4,5)
obtained for S and T (Bär et al., 2012).
• LIX {2}: Calculates the LIX readability

score (Wikipedia, 2013; Björnsson, 1968) for
S and T. 4

Table 4 lists the improved results on the training set
after tuning, which shows about 0.04 increase in all
scores when compared with Table 1 and Table 2.

overall) on the uQ Beetle task.

We observe that decision tree regression (Hastie
et al., 2009) (TREE) generalizes to uQ and uD do-
mains better than the RR or SVR models especially
in the SciEntsBank corpus. Table 6 presents TREE
results on the SRA SciEntsBank test set, which
shows significant increase in uQ and uD tasks when
compared with Table 5.

5 Conclusion

Referential translation machines provide a clean
and intuitive computational model for automatically
grading student answers by measuring the acts of
translation involved and achieve to be the 2nd best
system on some tasks in the SRA challenge. RTMs
make quality and semantic similarity judgments
possible based on the retrieval of relevant training
data as interpretants for reaching shared semantics.
