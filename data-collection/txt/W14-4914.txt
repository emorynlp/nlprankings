Abstract

This project aims to develop linguistic resources to support computational NLP research on the
Igbo language. The starting point for this project is the development of a new part-of-speech tag-
ging scheme based on the EAGLES tagset guidelines, adapted to incorporate additional language
internal features. The tags are currently being used in a part-of-speech annotation task for the
development of POS tagged Igbo corpus. The proposed tagset has 59 tags.

1 Introduction

Supervised machine learning methods in NLP require an adequate amount of training data. The first
crucial step for a part-of-speech (POS) tagging system for a language is a well designed, consistent, and
complete tagset (Bamba Dione et al., 2010) which must be preceded by a detailed study and analysis of
the language. Our tagset was developed from scratch through the study of linguistics and electronic texts
in Igbo, using the EAGLES recommendations.

This initial manual annotation is important. Firstly, information dealing with challenging phenomena
in a language is expressed in the tagging guideline; secondly, computational POS taggers require anno-
tated text as training data. Even in unsupervised methods, some annotated texts are still required as a
benchmark in evaluation. With this in mind, our tagset design follows three main goals: to determine
the tagset size, since a smaller granularity provides higher accuracy and less ambiguity (de Pauwy et al.,
2012); to use a sizeable scheme to capture the grammatical distinctions at a word level suited for further
grammatical analysis, such as parsing; and to deliver good accuracy for automatic tagging, using the
manually tagged data. We discuss the development of the tagset and corpus for Igbo. This work is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first published work attempting to develop statistical NLP resources for Igbo.

2 Some Grammatical Features of the Igbo Language

2.1 Language family and speakers
The Igbo language has been classified as a Benue-Congo language of the Kwa sub-group of the Niger-
Congo family1 and is one of the three major languages in Nigeria, spoken in the eastern part of Nigeria,
with about 36 million speakers2. Nigeria is a multilingual country having around 510 living languages1,
but English serves as the official language.

2.2 Phonology
Standard Igbo has eight vowels and thirty consonants. The 8 vowels are divided into two harmony groups
that are distinguished on the basis of the Advanced Tongue Root (ATR) phenomenon. They are -ATR: i.
[I], u. [U], a [A], o. [O] and +ATR: i [i], u [u], e [e], o [o] (Uchechukwu, 2008). Many Igbo words select
their vowels from the same harmony group. Also, Igbo is a tonal language. There are three distinct tones

recognized in the language viz; High, Low, and Downstep. The tones are represented as High [H] =
[´ ], Low [L] = [` ], downstep = [¯ ] (Emenanjo, 1978; Ikekeonwu, 1999) and are placed above the tone
bearing units (TBU) of the language.

There are two tone marking systems, either: all high tones are left unmarked and all low tones and
downsteps are marked (Green and Igwe, 1963; Emenanjo, 1978), or only contrastive tones are marked
(Welmers and Welmers, 1968; Nwachukwu, 1995). We used the first system to illustrate the importance
of tonal feature in the language’s lexical or grammatical structure. For example, at the lexical level the
word akwa without a tone mark can be given the equivalent of ‘bed/bridge’, ‘cry’, ‘cloth’, or ‘egg’.
But these equivalents can be properly distinguished when tone marked, as follows: akwa “cry”, akwà
“cloth”, àkwà “bed or brigde”, àkwa “egg”. At the grammatical level, an interrogative sentence can be
distinguished from a declarative sentence through a change in tone of the person pronouns from a high
tone (e.g. O. nà-àbi.a “He is coming”) to a low tone (e.g. Ò. nà-àbi.a “Is he coming?”). Also, there are
syllabic nasal consonants, which are tone bearing units in the language. The nasal consonants always
occur before a consonant. For example: ǹdo ‘Sorry’ or explicitly tone marked as ǹdó.

2.3 Writing System

The Igbo orthography is based on the Standard Igbo by the O. nwu. Committee (O. nwu. Committee, 1961).
There are 28 consonants: b gb ch d f g gh gw h j k kw kp l m n nw ny ṅ p r s sh t v w y z, and 8 vowels
(see phonology section). Nine of the consonants are digraphs: ch, gb, gh, gw, kp, kw, nw, ny, sh.

Igbo is an agglutinative language in which its lexical categories undergo affixation, especially the
verbs, to form a lexical unit. For example, the word form erichari.ri. is a verbal structure with four
morphemes: verbal vowel prefix e-, verb root -ri-, extensional suffix -cha-, and a second extensional
suffix -ri.ri. . Its occurrence in the sentence “Obi must eat up that food” is Obi ga-erichari.ri. nri ahu. ,
that is, Obi aux-eat.completely.must food DET. Igbo word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), with a
complement to the right of the head.

2.4 Grammatical Classes

Generally, Emenanjo (1978) identified the following broad word classes for Igbo: verbal, nominal, nom-
inal modifier, conjunction, preposition, suffixes, and enclitics. The verbal is made up of verbs, auxiliaries
and participles, while the nominal is made up of nouns, numerals, pronouns and interrogatives. Nouns are
further classified into five lexical classes, viz; proper, common, qualificative, adverbial and ideophones.
However, we identified extra five in the tagset design phase (see the appendix). Nominal modifiers occur
in a noun phrase. Its four classes are adjectives, demonstratives, quantifiers and pronominal modifiers.
Conjunctions link words or sentences together, while prepositions are found preceding nominals and ver-
bals and cannot be found in isolation. Suffixes and enclitics are the only bound elements in the language.
Suffixes are primarily affixed to verbals only, while enclitics are used with both verbals and other word
classes. Suffixes are found in verb phrase slots and enclitics can be found in both verb phrase and noun
phrase slots. The language does not have a grammatical gender system.

3 Language Resources

The development of NLP resources for any language is based on the linguistics resources available for the
language. This includes appropriate fonts and text processing software as well as the available electronic
texts for the work. The font and software problems of the language have been addressed through the
Unicode development (Uchechukwu, 2005; Uchechukwu, 2006). The next is the availability of Igbo
texts.

Any effort towards the Igbo corpus development is a non-trivial task. There are basic issues connected
with the nature of the language. The first major surprise is that Igbo texts ‘by native speakers’ written
‘for native speakers’ vary in forms due to dialectal difference and are usually not tone-marked. Indeed,
the tone marking used in the sections above are usually found in academic articles. It would be strange
to find an Igbo text (literary work) that is fully tone marked and no effort has been made to undertake a
tone marking of existing Igbo texts. Such an effort looks impossible as more Igbo texts are written and

94



published. Such is the situation that confronts any effort to develop an Igbo corpus. Hence, developing
NLP resources for the language has to start with the available resources; otherwise, such an endeavour
would have to first take a backward step of tone marking all the texts to be added to its corpus and
normalizing the dialectal differences. This is a no mean task.

It is for this reason that we chose the New World Translation (NWT) Bible version for Igbo corpus
with its English parallel text3. The NWT Bible does not adopt a particular tone marking system, neither
is there a consistent use of tone marks for all the sentences in the Bible. Instead, there is narrow use
of tone marks in specific and restricted circumstances throughout the book. An example is when there
is a need to disambiguate a particular word. For instance, ihe without tone mark could mean ‘thing’ or
‘light’. These two are always tone marked in the Bible to avoid confusion; hence ìhè ‘light’ and íhé
‘thing’. The same applies to many other lexical items. Another instance is the placement of a low tone
on the person pronouns to indicate the onset of an interrogative sentence, which otherwise would be
read as a declarative sentence. This particular example has already been cited as one of the uses of tone
mark in the language. Apart from such instances, the sentences in the Bible are not tone marked. As
such, one cannot rely on such restricted use of tone marks for any major conclusions on the grammar of
the language. With regard to corpus work in general, the Bible has been described as consistent in its
orthography, most easily accessible, carefully translated (most translators believe it is the word of God),
and well structured (books, chapters, verses), etc. (Resnik et al., 1999; Kanungo and Resnik, 1999; Chew
et al., 2006). The NWT Bible is generally written in standard Igbo.

4 Tokenization

We outline here the method we used in the tokenization of the text. For the sake of a start-up, we
tokenized based on the whitespace. The Igbo language uses whitespace to represent lexical boundaries;
we used the following regex:

Separate characters if the string matches:

• “ga-” or “n”’ or “N”’ or “na-” or “Na-” or “ana-” or “i.na-”; for example, the following
samples n’elu, na–erughari., i.na-akwa, ana-egbu in the Bible will be separated into n’,
elu, na–, erughari., i.na-, akwa, ana-, egbu tokens.

• Any non-zero length sequence consisting of a–z, A–Z, 0–9, combining grave accent
(` ), combining acute accent (´ ), combining dot below (.); for example, these words
ìhè, ahú. , ájá in the corpus will be separated as tokens with their diacritics.

• Any single character from: left double-quotation mark (“), right double-quotation
mark (”), comma (,), colon (:), semicolon (;), exclamation (!), question (?), dot (.).

• Any single non-whitespace character.
In place of sentence splitting, we use verses since all 66 books of the Bible is written in verse level. Our
major aim is to use this Igbo corpus to implement our new tagset, which will capture all the inflected and
non-inflected tokens in the corpus. For lack of space, issues with tokenization with respect to morphemes,
manual annotation implemetations and platform used will not be discussed in this paper.

5 Tagset Design

We adopt the (Leech, 1997) definition of a POS tagset as a set of word categories to be applied to the
tokens of a text. We designed our tagset following the standard EAGLES guidelines, diverging where
necessary (e.g. EAGLES, which favours European languages, specifies articles at the obligatory level,
but this category does not apply for Igbo). A crucial question in tagset design is the extent of fine-grained
distinctions to encode within the tagset. A too coarsely grained tagset may fail to capture distinctions that
would be valuable for subsequent analysis, e.g. syntactic parsing; too fine-grained may make automatic
(and manual) POS tagging difficult, resulting in errors that lead to different problems for later processing.
In what follows, we introduce a sizeable tagset granularity with the intention of providing a basis for
practical POS tagging.

Table 1: Selected distinctive tags from the tagset scheme

The tagset is intended to strike an appropriate balance for practical purposes regarding granularity,
capturing what we believe will be the key lexico-grammatical distinctions of value for subsequent pro-
cessing, such as parsing. Further subcategorization of the grammatical classes, as described in section
2.4, results in 59 tags which apply to whole tokens (produced by the tokenisation stage described above).
An important challenge comes from the complex morphological behaviour of Igbo. Thus, a verb such
as bi.a, which we assign the tag VSI (a verb in its simple or base form), can combine with extensional
suffixes, such as ghi. and kwa, to produce variants such as bi.aghi. , bi.akwa and bi.aghi.kwa, which exhibit
similar grammatical behaviour to the base form. As such, we might have assigned these variants the VSI
tag also, but have instead chosen to assign VSI_XS, which serves to indicate both the core grammatical
behaviour and the presence of extensional suffixes. In abi.akwa, we find the same base form bi.a, plus a
verbal vowel prefix a, resulting in the verb being a participle, which we assign the tag VPP_XS. For the
benefit of cross-lingual training and other NLP tasks, a smaller tagset that captures only the grammatical
distinctions between major classes is required. The present 59 tags can easily be simplified to a coarse-
grained tagset of 15 tags, which will principally preserve just the core distinctions between word classes,
such as nouns, verb, adjective, etc.

Athough Emenanjo (1978) classified ideophones as a form of noun, we have assigned them a sepa-
rate tag IDEO, as these items can be found performing many grammatical functions. For instance, the
ideophone ko. i. , “to say that someone walks ko. i. ko. i.” has no nominal meaning, rather its function here is
adverbial. A full enumeration of this scheme is given in the appendix.

5.1 The developement of an POS tagged Igbo Corpus

Here we analyse the manual POS tagging process that is ongoing based on the tagset scheme. The
Bible books were allocated randomly to six groups, producing six corpora portions of approximately
45,000 tokens each. Our plan was for each human annotator to tag at least 1000 tokens per day, resulting
in complete POS tagging in 45 days. The overall corpus size allocated is 264,795 tokens of the new
testament Bible. There are six human annotators, who are students of the Department of Linguistics at
Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, supervised by a senior lecturer in the same department; giving an
effective total of seven human annotators. Additionally, a common portion of the corpus (38,093 tokens)
was given to all the annotators, as a basis for calculating inter-annotator agreement.

6 Conclusions

We have outlined our current progress in the development of a POS tagging scheme for Igbo from scratch.
Our project aims to build linguistic computational resources to support research in natural language
processing (NLP) for Igbo. It is important to note that these tags are applicable on unmarked, not fully
marked, and fully tone marked Igbo texts, since the fully tone marked tokens play the same grammatical
roles as in the none tone marked texts, written by native speakers for fellow native speakers.

Our method of tagset design could be used for other African or under-resourced languages. African
languages are morphologically rich, and of around 2000 languages in the continent, only a small number
have featured in NLP research.

A A Tagset Design for the Igbo Language

Noun Class
Tag Description/Example
NNP Noun Proper. Chineke ‘God’, Onyeka, Okonkwo, Osita.
NNC Noun Common. Oku. ‘fire’, u. wa ‘earth’, osisi ‘tree, stick’, ala ‘ground’, eluigwe ‘sky, heaven’
NNM Number Marking Noun. Ndi. ‘people’, nwa ‘child’, u. mu. ‘children’. ndi. is classified as a common noun with

an attached phrase of “thing/person associated with” (Emenanjo, 1978). ndi. preceding a noun marks plurality
of that noun, nwa marks it singular (e.g. nwa agbo. gho. ‘a maiden’), and u. mu. also indicate plurality (e.g. u. mu.
agbo. gho. ‘maidens’).

NNQ Qualificative noun. Nouns that are inherently semantically descriptive. E.g. ogologo [height, long, tall]
NND Adverbial noun. This lexical class function to modify verbals, e.g. O ji nwayo. o. eri nri ya
NNH Inherent Complement. Igbo verb has a [verb + NP/PP] structure. NP/PP are the verb complement. They

cooccur with the verb, at times quite distant from the verb, e.g. (1) i.gu. egwu ‘to sing’ , (2) iti i.gba ‘to drum’, (3)
igwu ji ‘harvest yam’.

NNA Agentive Noun. Nouns are formed through verbs nominalization. Compare (1) with o. go. egwu ‘singer’ and (2)
with oti i.gba ‘drummer’. For links NNAV . . . NNAC.

NNT Instrumental Noun. Refer to instruments and are formed via nominalization. Compare (3) with ngwu ji
‘digger’. For links NNTV . . . NNTC.

NOTE: We introduced link indicators in NNA and NNT, V and C, Where V and C stand for verbal and Complementary
respectively. So, NNAV indicates derivation from the verbal component of the inherent complement verb and NNAC is the
inherent complement of the whole verbal complex. E.g., o. gu. /NNAV egwu/NNAC. Also, NNTV and NNTC, where NNTV
is derived from the verbal component of the inherent complement verb and NNTC is the inherent complement of the whole
verbal complex. E.g. , ngwu/NNTV ji/NNTC

97



Verb Class
VIF Infinitive. Marked through the addition of the vowel [i] or [i.] to the verb root.
VSI Simple verb. Has only one verb root.
VCO Compound Verb. Involves a combination of two verb roots.
VIC Inherent Complement Verb (ICV). Involves the combination of a simple or compound verb with a noun phrase

or a prepositional phrase. It gives rise to the structures (1) V + NP, or (2) V + PP
VMO Modal Verb. Its formed by inherent complement verbs and simple verbs. [See the section on suffixes]
VAX Auxiliary Verb. ga [Future marking], na [progressive]
VPP Participle. Always occurs after the auxiliary, and prefixed e/a to the verb root using vowel harmony.
VCJ Conjunctional Verb. A verb that has a conjuntional meaning, especially in narratives: wee
VBC
(BVC)

Bound Verb Complment or Bound Cognate Noun. Its formed by harmonizing prefix a/e to the verb root. It
looks like the participle but occurs after the participle in same sentence as the verb. It can be formed from every
verb.

VGD Gerund. Reduplication of the verb root plus harmonizing vowel o/o. . Also, internal vowel changes can occur.
E.g. ba ‘enter’ [o. + bu. + ba ]=o. bu. ba ‘the entering’

Inflectional Class
VrV −rV (e.g. -ra). If attached to an active verb, it means simple past; but a stative meaning with a stative verb.
VPERF Perfect (e.g. -la/-le, -go). Describes the ‘perfect tense’. -la/-le obeys vowel harmony and the variant -go does

not.
Other part-of-speech tags

ADJ Adjective. The traditional part of speech ‘adjective’ that qualifies a noun. Igbo has very few of them.
PRN Pronoun. The 3 persons are 1st (sing + pl), 2nd (sing + pl), and 3rd (sing + pl) person Pronouns.
PRNREF Reflexive Pronoun. Formed by combination of the personal pronouns with the noun onwe ‘self’.
PRNEMP Emphatic pronoun. This involves the structure [pronoun+onwe+pronoun].
ADV Adverb. Changes or simplifies the meaning of a verb. They are few in Igbo.
CJN Conjunction. There are complex and simple conjunctions distinguish based on grammatical functions viz;

co-rodinators, sub-ordinators and correlatives. Link indicators CJN1...CJN2 are for “correlative CJN”. E.g.
ma/CJN1...ma/CJN2.

PREP Preposition. The preposition na is realised as n’ if the modified word begins with a vowel.
WH Interrogative. Questions that return useful data through explanation. Ònye, gi.ni., olee, ...
PRNYNQ Pronoun question. Questions that return YES or NO answer. E.g. m̀, à, hà, ò, `o. , ...
IDEO Ideophone. This is used for sound-symbolic realization of various lexico-grammatical function. E.g. ni.gani.ga,

mu. ri.i., ko. i., etc.
QTF Quantifier. This can be found after their nominals in the NP structure. E.g. dum, naabo. , nille.

INTJ Interjection.Ee
FW Borrowed word. amen.
SYM Punctuation. It includes all symbols.
CD Number. This includes all digits 1,2,3, ... and otu, mbu. , abu. a, ato. , ...
DIGR Digraph. All combined graphemes that represent a character in Igbo, which occur in the text. gb, gw, kp, nw, ...

NOTE: Tags with affixes identify inflected token forms in the corpus for use in further analysis, e.g. morphology. For
practical POS tagging, such tags may be simplified, i.e. α_XS⇒ α.

Any type of Enclitics
ENC Collective. cha, si. nu. , ko. – means all, totality forming a whole or aggregate.
