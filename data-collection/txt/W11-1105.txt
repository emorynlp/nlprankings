Abstract

A graph-based distance between Wikipedia ar-
ticles is defined using a random walk model,
which estimates visiting probability (VP) be-
tween articles using two types of links: hy-
perlinks and lexical similarity relations. The
VP to and from a set of articles is then com-
puted, and approximations are proposed to
make tractable the computation of semantic
relatedness between every two texts in a large
data set. The model is applied to document
clustering on the 20 Newsgroups data set. Pre-
cision and recall are improved in comparison
with previous textual distance algorithms.

1 Introduction

Many approaches have been proposed to compute
similarity between texts, from lexical overlap mea-
sures to statistical topic models that are learned from
large corpora. In this paper, we propose a method for
using knowledge from a structured, collaborative re-
source – the Wikipedia hypertext encyclopedia – in
order to build a measure of semantic relatedness that
we test on a text clustering task.

The paper first describes the document graph de-
rived from Wikipedia (Section 2), and then defines
a network-based distance using visiting probability
(Section 3), along with algorithms for its applica-
tion to text clustering (Section 4). Results over the
20 Newsgroups dataset are shown to be competitive
(Section 5), and the relative contributions of cosine
lexical similarity and visiting probability are ana-
lyzed. Our proposal is discussed in the light of pre-
vious work in Section 6.

2 The Document Network

In the present proposal, knowledge about seman-
tic relatedness is embodied into a document net-
work, whose nodes are intended to represent con-
cepts, while the links between nodes stand for var-
ious relations between concepts. The nodes of the
network correspond to articles from the Wikipedia
hypertext encyclopedia, and are derived as follows.

The network was built from Wikipedia, using the
WEX dataset (Metaweb Technologies, 2010). All
articles from the following categories were removed,
as they do not correspond to proper concepts: Talk,
File, Image, Template, Category, Portal, and List.
Moreover, disambiguation pages and articles shorter
than 100 non-stopwords were filtered out as well.
Out of 4,327,482 articles in WEX, 1,264,611 articles
were kept, forming the nodes of our network.

The first type of links in our document network
are the hyperlinks between articles, because, in prin-
ciple, each link between two articles indicates some
form of relatedness between them. There are more
than 35 million such links in our network.

The second type of links is derived from the sim-
ilarity of lexical content between articles. This is
computed using cosine similarity between the lexi-
cal vectors corresponding to the articles’ texts, after
stopword removal and stemming. Then, links are
created by connecting every article to the 10 arti-
cles that are most similar to it, each link receiving
a weight which is the normalized lexical similarity
score. The number 10 was chosen to ensure compu-
tational tractability, and is in the same range as the
average number of hyperlinks per node (30).

29



Computing semantic relatedness between two
texts requires: (1) to estimate relatedness between
two sets of nodes in the network, as described in
Sections 3 and 4; and (2) to project each text onto
a set of nodes, as we briefly explain here. The pro-
jection of a text onto the network is found by com-
puting the text’s lexical similarity with all articles,
again using cosine distance over stemmed words,
without stopwords. The text is mapped to the 10
closest articles, resulting in a probability distribution
over the 10 corresponding nodes. Again, this value
was chosen to be similar to the number of hyperlinks
and content links per node, and to keep computation
tractable. In fact, the numerous Wikipedia articles
are scattered in the space of words, therefore tuning
these values does not seem to bring crucial changes.

3 Computing Relatedness in the Network
Using Visiting Probability (VP)

We have previously defined a random walk model
(Yazdani and Popescu-Belis, 2010) to compute re-
latedness of sets of nodes as the visiting probability
(VP ) of a random walker from one set to another
one, and we will review the model in this section. In
the next section, we will explain how the model was
extended for application to document clustering.

3.1 Notations

Let S = {si|1 ≤ i ≤ n} be the set of n nodes
in the graph. Any two nodes si and sj can be con-
nected by one or more directed and weighted links,
which can be of L different types (L = 2 in our
case: hyperlinks and lexical similarity links). Links
between nodes can thus be represented by L matri-
ces Al (1 ≤ l ≤ L) of size n × n, where Al(i, j)
is the weight of the link of type l between si and sj .
The transition matrix Cl gives the probability of a
direct transition between nodes si and sj , using only
links of type l. This matrix can be built from the Al
matrix as follows:

Cl(i, j) =
Al(i, j)∑n
k=1Al(i, k)

.

In the random walk process using all link types
(1 ≤ l ≤ L), let the weight wl denote the impor-
tance of link type l. Then, the overall transition ma-
trix C giving the transition probability Ci,j between

nodes si and sj is : C =
∑L

l=1wlCl.
One of the main parameters in this computation

is the relative weight of the two types of links (lex-
ical similarity and hyperlinks) in the random walk
over the network. The settings for the experiments
on document clustering (0.6 vs. 0.4) are explained in
Section 5.1 below.

3.2 VP from a Set of Nodes to a Node

Let us consider a probability distribution ~r over
nodes, corresponding to the projection of a text frag-
ment onto the network of articles (Section 2). Given
a new node sj in the network, our model first esti-
mates the probability of visiting sj for the first time
when a random walker starts from ~r in the graph.
The model considers the state St of the random
walker (its position node) and provides a procedure
which, executed until termination, yields the value
of VP . Namely, the initial state is chosen at random
with probability P (S0 = si|~r) = ri (where the ri
are the components of ~r). Then, from state St−1, ei-
ther St−1 = sj and the procedure is finished, or the
next node is chosen using the transition matrix C.
Moreover, it is also possible to ‘fail’ the walk with
a small probability, called ‘absorption probability’,
which makes longer paths less probable.

3.3 Differences between VP and PageRank or
Hitting Time

The VP of sj starting from the distribution ~r, as
computed here, is different from the probability as-
signed to sj after running Personalized PageRank
(Haveliwala, 2003) with a teleport vector equal to ~r.
In the computation of VP , the loops starting from sj
and ending to the same sj do not have any effect on
the final score, unlike for PPR, for which such loops
boost the probability of sj . If some pages have this
type of loops (typically, very “popular” pages), then
after using PPR they will have high probability al-
though they might not be very close to the teleport
vector ~r.

The VP of sj is also different from the hitting
time to sj , defined as the average number of steps
a random walker would take to visit sj for the first
time in the graph starting from ~r. Hitting time is
more sensitive to long paths in comparison to VP ,
a fact that might introduce more noise.The perfor-
mance of these three algorithms in computing se-

30



mantic similarity has been compared in (Yazdani
and Popescu-Belis, 2010).

3.4 VP between Sets of Nodes

Generalizing now to the computation of VP from
a weighted set of nodes ~r1 (a probability distribu-
tion) to another set ~r2, the model first constructs a
virtual node representing ~r2 in the network, named
by convention sR, and then connects all nodes si to
sR according to their weights in ~r2. The transition
matrix for the random walk is updated accordingly.

To compute relatedness of two texts projected
onto the network as ~r1 and ~r2, the VP of ~r1 given
~r2 is averaged with the converse probability, of ~r2
given ~r1 – a larger probability indicating closer se-
mantic relatedness.

3.5 Truncated VP

The computation of VP can be done iteratively and
can be truncated after a number of steps, as the im-
portance of longer paths grows smaller due to the
absorption probability, leading thus to a T -truncated
visiting probability noted VPT . Besides making
computation more tractable, truncation reduces the
effect of longer paths, which seem to be less reliable
indicators of relatedness.

We have computed an upper bound on the trun-
cation error, which helps to control and minimize
the number of steps actually computed in a random
walk. To compute the upper bound of the truncation
error we compute the probability of returning neither
success (reaching sj) nor failure (absorption) in first
t steps, which can be computed as

∑n
i 6=j α

t(~rC ′t)i.
This is in fact the probability mass at time t at all
nodes except sj , the targeted node. C ′ is the transi-
tion matrix that gives the probability of a transition
between two nodes, modified to include the virtual
node sR in the network, and 1− α is the absorption
probability.

If pt(success) denotes the probability of success
(reaching sj) considering paths of length at most t,
and εt the error made by truncating after step t, then
we have:

εt = p(success)− pt(success) ≤
∑n

i 6=j α
t(~rC ′t)i

So, if pt(success) is used as an approximation for
p(success) then an upper bound for this approxima-
tion error εt is the right term of the above inequality.

4 Application of VP to Text Clustering

In this section, we describe the additional modeling
that was done so that semantic relatedness based on
VP could be applied efficiently to text clustering.
Indeed, it is not tractable to individually compute
the average VP between any two texts in the set of
documents to be clustered, because the numbers of
pairs is very large – e.g., 20,000 documents in the
experiments in Section 5. Instead, we propose two
solutions for computing, respectively, VP to a set of
nodes (from all documents in the network), and re-
spectively VP from a set of nodes to all documents.

4.1 Computing VP from All Nodes to a Subset

To compute the T -truncated visiting probability
(noted VPT ) from all nodes in the network to a node
sR at the same time, the following recursive pro-
cedure is defined. Here, T is the number of steps
before truncation, and sR is a virtual node repre-
senting a probability distribution ~r from a text. The
procedure is based on the definition of VP between
nodes in Section 3 and uses the transition matrix C ′

that gives the probability of a transition between two
nodes, modified to include the virtual node sR in the
network. If 1− α is the absorption probability, then
the recursive definition of VPT from a node si to
the virtual node sR is:

VPT (si, sR) = α
∑

k C
′(si, sk)VPT−1(sk, sR)

Using dynamic programming, it is possible to
compute VPT from all nodes to sR inO(ET ) steps,
where E is the number of links in the network.
The initialization of the procedure is done using
VPT (sR, sR) = 1 and VP0(si, sR) = 0 for any
i 6= R.

4.2 Computing VP from a Subset to All Nodes

To compute the truncated VP from ~r to all nodes
in the network, the total computation time using
the definition of VPT from Section 3 is O(ETN ),
where N is the number of nodes in the network, be-
cause VPT must be computed for each node sepa-
rately. For a large data set, this is not tractable.

The proposed solution is based on a sampling
method over the random walks to approximate
VPT . The sampling involves running M indepen-
dent random walks of length T from ~r. For a given

31



node sj and a sample walk m, the first time (if any)
when sj is visited on each random walk starting
from ~r is noted tjm . Then, VP

T can be estimated
by the following average over sample walks, where
1− α is again the absorption probability:

ˆVPT (~r, sj) = (
∑

m α
tjm )/M.

As a result, the estimate of VPT can be computed
in O(MT ) steps, where M is the number of sample
paths.

Moreover, it is possible to compute a bound on the
error of the estimation, |VPT− ˆVPT |, depending on
the number of sample paths M . It can be shown that
the error is lower than ε, with a probability larger
than 1 − δ, on condition that the number of sample
paths is greater than α2 ln(2/δ)/2ε2.

To prove this bound, we use inspiration from a
proof by Sarkar et al. (2008). If the estimation of a
variableX is noted X̂ , let us suppose that concept sj
has been visited for the first time at {tj1 , · · · , tjm}
time steps in the M sample walks. We define the
random variable X l by αtjl/M , where tjl indicates
the time step at which sj was visited for the first
time in lth sampling. If sj was not visited at all,
then X l = 0 by convention. The l random variables
X l (j1 ≤ l ≤ jm) are independent and bounded by
0 and 1 (0 ≤ X l ≤ 1). We have:

ˆVPT (~r, sj) =
∑

lX
l = (

∑
l α

tjl )/M and

E( ˆVPT (~r, sj)) = VPT (~r, sj).

So, by applying Hoeffding’s inequality, we have:

P (| ˆVPT − E( ˆVPT )| ≥ �) ≤ 2exp(−2M�2
α2

).

If the probability of error must be at most δ, then
setting the right side lower than δ gives the bound
for M that is stated in our theorem.

As a consequence, we have the following lower
bound forM if we want ε-approximation for all pos-
sible sj with probability at least 1− δ. We use union
bound and Hoeffding’s inequality:

P (∃j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, | ˆVPT − E( ˆVPT )| ≥ �) ≤ 2n×
exp(−2M�2

α2
)

which gives the lower bound M ≥ α
2 ln(2n/δ)

2�2
.

5 Document Clustering

This section describes the experimental setting and
the results of applying the text relatedness measure
defined above to the problem of document cluster-
ing over the 20 Newsgroups dataset.1 The dataset
contains about 20,000 postings to 20 news groups,
hence 20 document classes, with about 1,000 docu-
ments per class. We aim here at finding these classes
automatically, using for testing the entire data set
without using any part of it as a training set. The
knowledge of our system comes entirely from the
document network and the techniques for comput-
ing distances between two texts projected onto it.

5.1 Setup of the Experiment
We first compute a similarity matrix for the entire 20
Newsgroups data set, with the relatedness score be-
tween any two documents being VPT . For tractabil-
ity, we fixed T = 5 that gives sufficient precision; a
larger value only increased computation time. In-
stead of computing VPT between all possible pairs
separately, we fill one row of the matrix at a time
using the approximations above.

We set the absorption probability of the random
walk 1 − α = 0.2 for this experiment. Given α
and T by using the formula in section 3.5, it is pos-
sible to compute the error bound of the truncation,
and noting that for a smaller α, fewer steps (T ) are
needed to achieve the same approximation precision
because of the penalty set to longer paths. Con-
versely, a larger α decreases the penalty for longer
paths and requires more computation.2

For comparison purposes, four similarity matri-
ces were computed. Indeed, the theoretical appara-
tus described above can be applied to various types
of links in the document network. In Section 2, we
introduced two types of links, namely lexical simi-
larity and actual hyperlinks, and these can be used
separately in the model, or as a weighted combina-
tion. The following similarities will be compared:

1. VP over hyperlinks only (noted VPHyp);

2. VP over lexical similarity links (VPLex);

2Note that in the extreme case when α = 0, similarity to all
nodes except the node itself is zero.

32



3. VP over a combination of hyperlinks (0.4) and
lexical links (0.6) (noted VPComb) – these val-
ues gave the best results in our previous appli-
cations to word and document similarity tasks
(Yazdani and Popescu-Belis, 2010);

4. no random walk, only cosine similarity be-
tween the tf-idf vectors of the documents to be
clustered (noted LS , for lexical similarity).

5.2 Clustering Performance

Clustering is performed using a k-means algorithm
over each of the four similarity matrices.3 The qual-
ity of the clustering is first measured using the Rand
Index (RI), which counts the proportion of pairs of
documents that are similarly grouped, i.e. either in
the same, or in different clusters, in the reference
vs. candidate clusterings. Other methods exist (Pan-
tel and Lin, 2002), including a Rand Index adjusted
for chance (Vinh et al., 2009), but the RI suffices
for comparative judgments in this subsection. How-
ever, in Subsection 5.3, we will also look at preci-
sion and recall, and in Subsection 5.4 we will use
purity. As the clustering is performed over the entire
data set, because there is no training vs. test data,
confidence intervals are not available, though they
could be computed by splitting the data. As a result,
comparison with other scores on the same test set is
absolute.

The scores in terms of Rand Index are, in decreas-
ing order:

1. 90.8% for VPComb

2. 90.6% for VPHyp

3. 90.4% for VPLex

4. and only 86.1% for the LS cosine similarity.

The random walk model thus clearly outperforms
the baseline LS approach. If counting only wrongly
clustered document pairs, VPComb has 6.6% of such
pairs, while VPLex has 8.4%, confirming the lower
performance of the model using only lexical similar-
ity links, i.e. the utility of hyperlinks.

3The semantic relatedness measure proposed here could be
used with other clustering algorithms, such as the committee-
based method proposed by Pantel and Lin (2002).

5.3 Comparison to Other Methods

To obtain a better understanding of the performance
of the proposed method, we computed the clustering
precision and recall of several well-known methods
for statistical text representation, shown in Table 1.
For Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deer-
wester et al., 1990), we first mapped the documents
in the latent space and then computed the cosine
similarity between the documents in the latent space.
The number of topics for LSA and LDA is set to 100
to make the computation tractable. Precision and re-
call are used, rather than the Rand Index, to show in
more detail the performance of each method. The
use of VP over our document network clearly in-
creases both precision and recall in comparison to
other tested approaches.

Similarity method Precision Recall
LS 7.50 18.38
LSA 8.63 9.99
LDA 19.93 31.50

VPComb 23.81 35.32

the 20 Newsgroups using several well-known methods to
compute text similarity, in comparison to the present pro-
posal.

5.4 Analysis of the Impact of VP with Respect
to Cosine Similarity

To find out in which cases the proposed method im-
proves over a simple cosine similarity measure, we
considered a linear combination of the cosine simi-
larity and VP , noted w×VPComb+(1−w)×LS ,
and varied the weight w from 0 to 1. Considering
the k-nearest neighbors of every document accord-
ing to this combined similarity, we define k-purity
as the number of documents with the correct label
over the total number of documents k in the com-
puted neighborhood. The variation of k-purity with
w, for several values of k, is shown in Figure 1.

The best purity appears to be obtained for a com-
bination of the two methods, for all values of k that
were tested. This shows that VPComb brings valu-
able additional information about document relat-
edness that cannot be found in LS only. Further-

33



Figure 1: Values of k-purity (vertical axis) averaged over all documents, for neighborhoods of different sizes k. The
horizontal axis indicates the weightw of visiting probability vs. cosine lexical similarity in the formula: w×VPComb+
(1− w)× LS .

more, when the size of the examined neighborhood
k increases (lower curves in Figure 1), the effect of
VPComb becomes more important, i.e. its weight in
the optimal combination increases. For very small
neighborhoods, LS is almost sufficient to ensure op-
timal purity, but for larger ones (k = 10 or 15),
VPComb used alone (w = 1) outperforms LS used
alone (w = 0). Their optimal combination leads to
scores that are higher than those obtained for each
of them used separately, and, as noted, the weight of
VPComb in the optimal combination increases for
larger neighborhoods.

These results can be explained as follows. For
very small neighborhoods, the cosine lexical simi-
larity score with the nearest 1–5 documents is very
high, as they have many words in common, so LS is
a good measure of text relatedness. However, when
looking at larger neighborhoods, for which related-
ness is less based on identical words, then VPComb
becomes more effective, and LS performs poorly.
Therefore, we can predict that VPComb will be most
relevant when looking for larger neighborhoods, or

in order to increase recall. VPComb should also be
relevant when there is low diversity among docu-
ment words, for instance when all documents are
very short.

6 Related Work

Many attempts have been made to improve the
overlap-based lexical similarity distance, for various
applications to HLT. One approach is to construct
a taxonomy of concepts and relations (manually or
automatically) and to map the text fragments to be
compared onto the taxonomy. For instance, Word-
net (Fellbaum, 1998) and Cyc (Lenat, 1995) are two
well-known knowledge bases that can be used for
enriching pure lexical matching. However, building
and maintaining such resources requires consider-
able effort, and they might cover only a fraction of
the vocabulary of a language, as they usually include
few proper names or technical terminology.

Another approach makes use of unsupervised
methods to construct a semantic representation of

34



documents by analyzing mainly co-occurrence rela-
tionships between words in a corpus. Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990), Probabilistic
LSA (Hofmann, 1999) and Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (Blei et al., 2003) are unsupervised methods that
construct a low-dimensional feature representation
or concept space, in which words are no longer sup-
posed to be independent.

Mihalcea et al. (2006) compared knowledge-
based and corpus-based methods, using word sim-
ilarity and word specificity to define one general
measure of text semantic similarity. Because it com-
putes word similarity values between all word pairs,
the proposed method appears to be suitable mainly
to compute similarity between short fragments, oth-
erwise the computation becomes intractable.

WikiRelate! (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006) com-
putes semantic relatedness between two words by
using Wikipedia. Each word is mapped to the corre-
sponding Wikipedia article by using article titles. To
compute relatedness, several methods are proposed,
namely, using paths in the Wikipedia category struc-
ture or the articles’ content. Our method, by compar-
ison, also uses the knowledge embedded in the hy-
perlinks between articles, as well as the entire con-
tents of articles, but unlike WikiRelate! it has been
extended to texts of arbitrary lengths.

Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007), instead of mapping a text to a
node or a small group of nodes in a taxonomy, maps
the text to the entire collection of available con-
cepts, by computing the degree of affinity of each
concept to the input text. Similarity is measured
in the new concept space. ESA does not use the
link structure or other structured knowledge from
Wikipedia. Moreover, by walking over a content
similarity graph, our method benefits from a non-
linear distance measure according to the paths con-
sisting of small neighborhoods.

In the work of Yeh et al. (2009), a graph of docu-
ments and hyperlinks is computed from Wikipedia,
then a Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2003) is
computed for each text fragment, with the teleport
vector being the one resulting from the ESA algo-
rithm cited above. To compute semantic relatedness
between two texts, Yeh et al. (2009) simply compare
their personalized page rank vectors. By compari-
son, in our method, we also consider in addition to

hyperlinks the effect of word co-occurrence between
article contents. The use of visiting probability also
gives different results over personalized page rank,
as it measures different properties of the network.

There are many studies on measuring distances
between vertices in a graph. Two measures that are
close to the visiting probability proposed here are
hitting time and Personalized PageRank mentioned
in Section 3.3. Hitting time has been used in var-
ious studies as a distance measure in graphs, e.g.
for dimensionality reduction (Saerens et al., 2004)
or for collaborative filtering in a recommender sys-
tem (Brand, 2005). Hitting time was also used for
link prediction in social networks along with other
distances (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2003), or
for semantic query suggestion using a query/URL
bipartite graph (Mei et al., 2008). As for Personal-
ized PageRank, it was used for word sense disam-
biguation (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), and for measur-
ing lexical relatedness of words in a graph built from
WordNet (Hughes and Ramage, 2007).

7 Conclusion

We proposed a model for measuring text seman-
tic relatedness based on knowledge embodied in
Wikipedia, seen here as document network with two
types of links – hyperlinks and lexical similarity
ones. We have used visiting probability to mea-
sure proximity between weighted sets of nodes, and
have proposed approximation algorithms to make
computation efficient for large graphs (more than
one million nodes and 40 million links) and large
text clustering datasets (20,000 documents in 20
Newsgroups). Results on the document clustering
task showed an improvement using both word co-
occurrence information and user-defined hyperlinks
between articles over other methods for text repre-
sentation.
