Abstract

Knowledge-based multilingual language processing benefits from having access to correctly es-
tablished relations between semantic lexicons, such as the links between different WordNets.
WordNet linking is a process that can be sped up by the use of computational techniques. Manual
evaluations of the partly automatically established synonym set (synset) relations between Dutch
and English in Cornetto, a Dutch lexical-semantic database associated with the EuroWordNet
grid, have confronted us with a worrisome amount of erroneous links. By extracting transla-
tions from various bilingual resources and automatically assigning a confidence score to every
pre-established link, we reduce the error rate of the existing equivalence relations between both
languages’ synsets (section 2). We will apply this technique to reuse the connection of Sclera
and Beta pictograph sets and Cornetto synsets to Princeton WordNet and other WordNets, allow-
ing us to further extend an existing Dutch text-to-pictograph translation tool to other languages
(section 3).

1 Introduction

The connections between WordNets, large semantic databases grouping lexical units into synonym
sets or synsets, are an important resource in knowledge-based multilingual language processing.
EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1997) aims to build language-specific WordNets among the same lines as the
original WordNet1 (Miller et al., 1990), using Inter-Lingual-Indexes to weave a web of equivalence re-
lations between the synsets contained within the databases. Cornetto2 (Vossen et al., 2007), a Dutch
lexical-semantic collection of data associated with the Dutch EuroWordNet3, consists of more than 118
000 synsets. The equivalence relations establish connections between Dutch and English synsets in
Princeton WordNet version 1.5 and 2.0. We update these links to Princeton WordNet version 3.0 by the
mappings among WordNet versions made available by TALP-UPC 4. The equivalence relations between
Cornetto and Princeton have been established semi-automatically by Vossen et al. (1999). Manual cod-
ing was carried out for the 14 749 most important concepts in the database. These include the most
frequent concepts, the concepts having a large amount of semantic relations and the concepts occupying
a high position in the lexical hierarchy. Automatic linkage was done by mapping the bilingual Van Dale
database5 to WordNet 1.5. For every WordNet synset containing a dictionary’s translation for a particular
Dutch word, all its members were proposed as alternative translations. In the case of only one transla-
tion, the synset relation was instantly assumed correct, while multiple translations were weighted using
several heuristics, such as measuring the conceptual distance in the WordNet hierarchy. We decided to
verify the quality of these links and noticed that they were highly erroneous, making them not yet very
reliable for multilingual processing.

2 Improving the equivalence relations between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet

We manually evaluated the quality of the links between 300 randomly selected Cornetto synsets and
their supposedly related Princeton synsets. A Cornetto synset is often linked to more than one Princeton
synset. We found an erroneous link in 35.27% of the 998 equivalence relations we evaluated.

Each Cornetto synset has about 3.3 automatically derived English equivalents, allowing to roughly
compare our evaluation to an initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen et
al. (1999). They note that, in the case of synsets with three to nine translations, the percentages of
correct automatically derived equivalents went down to 65% and 49% for nouns and verbs respectively.
Our manual evaluations are in line with these results, showing that only 64.73% of all the connections
in our sample are correct. An example of where it goes wrong is the Cornetto synset for the animal tor
”beetle”, which is not only appropriately linked to correct synsets (such as beetle and bug), but also
mistakenly to the Princeton synset for the computational glitch. This flaw is most probably caused by
the presence of the synonym bug, which is a commonly used word for errors in computer programs.
Examples like these are omnipresent in our data6 and led us to conclude that the synset links between
Cornetto and Princeton WordNet definitely could be improved.

We build a bilingual dictionary for Dutch and English and use these translations as an automatic
indicator of the quality of equivalence relations. In order to create a huge list of translations we merge
several translation word lists, removing double entries. Some are manually compiled dictionaries, while
others are automatically derived word lists from parallel corpora: we extracted the 1-word phrases from
the phrase tables built with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) based on the GIZA++ word alignments (Och and
Ney, 2003). Table 1 gives an overview.

This resulted in a coverage of 52.18% (43 970 out of 84 264) of the equivalence relations for which
translation information was available in order to possibly confirm the relation.

Table 1: The used translation sources

Figure 1 visualizes how we used the bilingual dictionaries to automatically evaluate the quality of the
pre-established links between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet. We retrieve all the lemmas of the lexical
units that were contained within a synset Si (in our example, snoepgoed ”confectionary” and snoep
”candy” extracted from S1). Each of these lemmas is looked up in the bilingual dictionary, resulting
in a dictionary words list of English translations.7 This list is used to estimate the correctness of the
equivalence relation between the Cornetto and the Princeton synset.

We retrieve the lexical units list from the English synset Tj (in our example candy and confect extracted
from T1). We count the number of words in the lexical units list also appearing in the dictionary words
list (the overlap being represented as the multiset Q). Translations appearing more than once are given
more importance. For example, candy occurs twice, putting our overlap counter on 2. This overlap is
normalized. In the example it is divided by 3 (confect + candy + candy, as the double count is taken into
account), leaving us with a score of 66.67%. For the gloss words list we remove the stop words8 and
make an analogous calculation. In our example, sweet is counted twice (the overlap being represented
as the multiset R) and this number is divided by the total number of gloss words available (again taking

6Other examples: nederig ”humble” was linked to the synset for flexible (as a synonym for elastic), waterachtig ”aquatic”
was linked to the synsets for grey and mousy, rocker (hardrocker) was linked to the synset for rocking chair, etc.

7Note that this list can contain doubles (such as candy and delicacy), as these translations would provide additional evidence
to our scoring algorithm. It is therefore not the case that the dictionary words list represents a set. It represents a multiset.

into account the double count). Averaging this score of 25% with our first result, we obtain a confidence
score of 45.83% for this equivalence relation. We calculated this confidence score for every equivalence
relation in Cornetto.

We checked whether the automatic scoring algorithm (section 2) (dis)agreed with the manual judge-
ments in order to determine a satisfactory threshold value for the acceptance of synset links. Evaluation
results are shown in figure 2. While the precision (the proportion of accurate links that the system got
right) went slightly up as our criterium for link acceptance became stricter, the recall (the proportion of
correct links that the system retrieved) quickly made a rather deep dive. The F-score reveals that the best
trade-off is reached when synset links getting a score of 0% are rejected, retaining any link with a higher
confidence score. The results in Table 3 shows that we were able to reduce the error rate to 21.09%,
which is a relative improvement of 40.20% over the baseline.

3 Improving the equivalence relations in the context of text-to-pictograph translation

Being able to use the currently available technological tools is becoming an increasingly important factor
in today’s society. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to the whole of commu-
nication methods which aim to assist people that are suffering from cognitive disabilities, helping them to
become more socially active in various domains of daily life. Text-to-pictograph translation is a particular
form of AAC technology that enables linguistically-impaired people to use the Internet independently.

Filtering away erroneous synset links in Cornetto has proven to be a useful way to improve the quality
of a text-to-pictograph translation tool. Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) have connected pictograph
sets to Cornetto synsets to enable text-to-pictograph translation. Equivalence relations are important to
allow reusing these connections in order to link pictographs to synsets for other languages than Dutch.

of link acceptance.

Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) released Sclera2Cornetto, a resource linking Sclera9 pictographs
to Cornetto synsets. Currently, over 13 000 Sclera pictographs are made available online, 5 710 of which
have been manually linked to Cornetto synsets. We want to build a text-to-pictograph conversion with
English and Spanish as source languages, reusing the Sclera2Cornetto data.

By improving Cornetto’s pre-established equivalence relations with Princeton synsets, we can connect
the Sclera pictographs with Princeton WordNet for English. The latter, in turn, will then be used as the
intermediate step in our process of assigning pictographs to Spanish synsets.

Manual evaluations were made for a randomly generated subset of the synsets that were previously
used by Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) for assigning Sclera and Beta10 pictographs to Cornetto.
Beta pictographs are another pictograph set for which a link between the pictographs and Cornetto was
provided by Vandeghinste (2014).

Table 2 presents the coverage of our bilingual dictionary for synsets being connected to Sclera and
Beta pictographs, which is clearly higher than the coverage over all synsets.

Covered Total Difference with All synsets
All synsets 43 970 (52.18%) 84 264 -
Sclera baseline 5 294 (88.80%) 5 962 36.62%
Beta synsets 3 409 (88.94%) 3 833 36.76%

Table 2: Dictionary Coverage for different sets of synsets

Table 3 shows that the error rate of Cornetto’s equivalence relations on the Sclera and Beta subsets
is much lower than the error rate on the whole set (section 2). We attribute this difference to the fact
that Vossen et al. (1999) carried out manual coding for the most important concepts in the database (see
section 1), as the Sclera and Beta pictographs tend to belong to this category. In these cases, every
synset has between one and two automatically derived English equivalents on the average, allowing us
to roughly compare with the initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen et al.
(1999) showing that, in the event of a Dutch synset having only one English equivalent, 86% of the nouns
and 78% of the verbs were correctly linked, while the ones having two equivalents were appropriate in
68% and 71% of the cases respectively.

The F-score in Figure 3 reveals that the best trade-off between precision and recall is reached at the
> 0% threshold value, improving the baseline precision for both Sclera and Beta. We now retrieve all
English synsets for which a non-zero score was obtained in order to assign Sclera and Beta pictographs
to Princeton WordNet.

4 Related work

Using bilingual dictionaries to initiate or improve WordNet linkage has been applied elsewhere. Linking
Chinese lemmata to English synsets (Huang et al., 2003) to create the Chinese WordNet is one such
example. The 200 most frequent Chinese words and the 10 most frequent adjectives were taken as
a starting set and found as translation equivalences for 496 English lemmata, making each Chinese
lemma corresponding to 2.13 English synsets on average. Evaluations showed that 77% of the 496
equivalent pairs were synonymous. This accuracy rate dropped to 62.7% when the list of equivalence
pairs was extended by including all WordNet synonyms. Sornlertlamvanich et al. (2008) assign synsets
to bilingual dictionaries for Asian languages by considering English equivalents and lexical synonyms,
listing all English translations and scoring synsets according to the amount of matching translations
found, yielding an average accuracy rate of 49.4% for synset assignment to a Thai-English dictionary
and an accuracy rate of 93.3% for synsets that are attributed the highest confidence score. Joshi et
al. (2012) generate candidate synsets in English, starting with synsets in Hindi. For each Hindi synset, a
bag of words is obtained by parsing its gloss, examples and synonyms. Using a bilingual dictionary, these
Hindi words are translated to English. Various heuristics are used to calculate the intersection between
the translated bag of words and the synset words, concepts or relations of the target language, such as
finding the closest hyperonym synset (accuracy rate of 79.76%), the closest common synset word bag
(accuracy rate of 74.48%) and the closest common concept word bag (accuracy rate of 55.20%). Finally,
Soria et al. (2009) develop a mechanism for enriching monolingual lexicons with new semantic relations
by relying on the use of Inter-Lingual-Indexes to link WordNets of different languages. However, the
quality of these links is not evaluated.

5 Conclusions and future work

We have shown that a rather large reduction in error rates (a relative improvement of 40.20% on the
whole set) concerning the equivalence relations between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet can be ac-
quired by applying a scoring algorithm based on bilingual dictionaries. The method can be used to create
new equivalence relations as well. Contrasting our results with related work shows that we reach at least
the same level of correctness, although results are hard to compare because of conceptual differences
between languages. An accuracy rate of 78.91% was obtained for the general set of Cornetto’s equiva-
lence relations, while its subset of Sclera and Beta synsets (denoting frequent concepts) acquired final

124



precision rates of 90.05% and 86.53% respectively (compare with section 4).
One advantage of our method is that it could easily be reused to automatically build reliable links

between Princeton WordNet and brand-new WordNets. Unsupervised clustering methods can provide us
with synonym sets in the source language, after which the bilingual dictionary technique and the scoring
algorithm can be applied in order to provide us with satisfactory equivalence relations between both
languages. Semantic relations between synsets can then also be transferred from Princeton to the source
language’s WordNet.

Our improved links will be integrated in the next version of Cornetto. Future work will consist of
scaling to other languages through other relations between WordNets.
