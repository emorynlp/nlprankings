Abstract 

We explore a semi-supervised approach for 
improving the portability of time expression 
recognition to non-newswire domains: we 
generate additional training examples by 
substituting temporal expression words with 
potential synonyms. We explore using 
synonyms both from WordNet and from the 
Latent Words Language Model (LWLM), 
which predicts synonyms in context using 
an unsupervised approach. We evaluate a 
state-of-the-art time expression recognition 
system trained both with and without the 
additional training examples using data from 
TempEval 2010, Reuters and Wikipedia. 
We find that the LWLM provides substan-
tial improvements on the Reuters corpus, 
and smaller improvements on the Wikipedia 
corpus. We find that WordNet alone never 
improves performance, though intersecting 
the examples from the LWLM and WordNet 
provides more stable results for Wikipedia.  

1 Introduction 

The recognition of time expressions such as April 
2011, mid-September and early next week is a cru-
cial first step for applications like question answer-
ing that must be able to handle temporally 
anchored queries. This need has inspired a variety 
of shared tasks for identifying time expressions, 
including the Message Understanding Conference 
named entity task (Grishman and Sundheim, 
1996), the Automatic Content Extraction time 

normalization task (http://fofoca.mitre.org/tern.html) 
and the TempEval 2010 time expression task 
(Verhagen et al., 2010). Many researchers com-
peted in these tasks, applying both rule-based and 
machine-learning approaches (Mani and Wilson, 
2000; Negri and Marseglia, 2004; Hacioglu et al., 
2005; Ahn et al., 2007; Poveda et al., 2007; 
Strötgen and Gertz 2010; Llorens et al., 2010), and 
achieving F1 measures as high as 0.86 for recog-
nizing temporal expressions. 

Yet in most of these recent evaluations, models 
are both trained and evaluated on text from the 
same domain, typically newswire.  Thus we know 
little about how well time expression recognition 
systems generalize to other sorts of text. We there-
fore take a state-of-the-art time recognizer and eva-
luate it both on TempEval 2010 and on two new 
test sets drawn from Reuters and Wikipedia. 

At the same time, we are interested in helping 
the model recognize more types of time expres-
sions than are available explicitly in the newswire 
training data. We therefore introduce a semi-
supervised approach for expanding the training 
data, where we take words from temporal expres-
sions in the data, substitute these words with likely 
synonyms, and add the generated examples to the 
training set. We select synonyms both via Word-
Net, and via predictions from the Latent Words 
Language Model (LWLM) (Deschacht and Moens, 
2009). We then evaluate the semi-supervised mod-
el on the TempEval, Reuters and Wikipedia test 
sets and observe how well the model has expanded 
its temporal vocabulary.

2 Related Work 

Semi-supervised approaches have been applied to a 
wide variety of natural language processing tasks, 
including word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 
1995), named entity recognition (Collins and 
Singer, 1999), and document classification (Sur-
deanu et al., 2006). 

The most relevant research to our work here is 
that of (Poveda et al., 2009), which investigated a 
semi-supervised approach to time expression rec-
ognition. They begin by selecting 100 time expres-
sions as seeds, selecting only expressions that are 
almost always annotated as times in the training 
half of the Automatic Content Extraction corpus. 
Then they begin an iterative process where they 
search an unlabeled corpus for patterns given their 
seeds (with patterns consisting of surrounding to-
kens, parts-of-speech, syntactic chunks etc.) and 
then search for new seeds given their patterns. The 
patterns resulting from this iterative process 
achieve F1 scores of up to 0.604 on the test half of 
the Automatic Content Extraction corpus. 

Our approach is quite different from that of (Po-
veda et al., 2009) – we use our training corpus for 
learning a supervised model rather than for se-
lecting high precision seeds, we generate addi-
tional training examples using synonyms rather 
than bootstrapping based on patterns, and we 
evaluate on Reuters and Wikipedia data that differ 
from the domain on which our model was trained. 

3 Method 

The proposed method implements a supervised 
machine learning approach that classifies each 
chunk-phrase candidate top-down starting at the 
parse tree root provided by the OpenNLP parser. 
Time expressions are identified as phrasal chunks 
with spans derived from the parse as described in 
(Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010).  

3.1 Basic TempEval Model 
We implemented a logistic regression model with 
the following features for each phrase-candidate: 
• The head word of the phrase 
• The part-of-speech tag of the head word 
• All tokens and part-of-speech tags in the 

phrase as a bag of words 

• The word-shape representation of the head 
word and the entire phrase, e.g. Xxxxx 99 
for the expression April 30  

• The condensed word-shape representation for 
the head word and the entire phrase, e.g. 
X(x) (9) for the expression April 30 

• The concatenated string of the syntactic types 
of the children of the phrase in the parse tree 

• The depth in the parse tree  

3.2 Lexical Resources for Bootstrapping 
Sparsity of annotated corpora is the biggest chal-
lenge for any supervised machine learning tech-
nique and especially for porting the trained models 
onto other domains. To overcome this problem we 
hypothesize that knowledge of semantically similar 
words, like temporal triggers, could be found by 
associating words that do not occur in the training 
set to similar words that do occur in the training 
set. Furthermore, we would like to learn these 
similarities automatically to be independent of 
knowledge sources that might not be available for 
all languages or domains. The first option is to use 
the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM) 
(Deschacht and Moens, 2009) – a language model 
that learns from an unlabeled corpus how to pro-
vide a weighted set of synonyms for words in con-
text. The LWLM model is trained on the Reuters 
news article corpus of 80 million words.  

WordNet (Miller, 1995) is another resource for 
synonyms widely used in research and applications 
of natural language processing. Synonyms from 
WordNet seem to be very useful for bootstrapping 
as they provide replacement words to a specific 
word in a particular sense. For each synset in 
WordNet there is a collection of other “sister” syn-
sets, called coordinate terms, which are topologi-
cally located under the same hypernym.  

3.3 Bootstrapping Strategies 
Having a list of synonyms for each token in the 
sentence, we can replace one of the original tokens 
by its synonym while still mostly preserving the 
sentence semantics. We choose to replace just the 
headword, under the assumption that since tempo-
ral trigger words usually occur at the headword 
position, adding alternative synonyms for the 
headword should allow our model to learn tempo-
ral triggers that did not appear in the training data.  

272



We designed the following bootstrapping strate-
gies for generating new temporal expressions: 
• LWLM: the phrasal head is replaced by one of 

the LWLM synonyms. 
• WordNet 1st Sense: Synonyms and coordinate 

terms for the most common sense of the 
phrasal head are selected and used for generat-
ing new examples of time expressions. 

• WordNet Pseudo-Lesk: The synset for the 
phrasal head is selected as having the largest 
intersection between the synset’s words and 
the LWLM synonyms. Then, synonyms and 
coordinate terms are used for generating new 
examples of time expressions. 

• LWLM+WordNet: The intersection of the 
LWLM synonyms and the WordNet synset 
found by pseudo-Lesk are used. 

In this way for every annotated time expression we 
generate n new examples (n∈[1,10]) and use them 
for training bootstrapped classification models.  

4 Experimental Setup 

The tested model is trained on the official Tem-
pEval 2010 training data with 53450 tokens and 
2117 annotated TIMEX3 tokens. For testing the 
portability of the model to other domains we anno-
tated two small target domain document collec-
tions with TIMEX3 tags. The first corpus is 12 
Reuters news articles from the Reuters corpus 

(Lewis et al., 2004), containing 2960 total tokens 
and 240 annotated TIMEX3 tokens (inter-
annotator agreement 0.909 F1-score). The second 
corpus is the Wikipedia article for Barak Obama 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama), containing 
7029 total tokens and 512 annotated TIMEX3 to-
kens (inter-annotator agreement 0.901 F1-score). 

The basic TempEval model is evaluated on the 
source domain (TempEval 2010 evaluation set – 
9599 tokens in total and 269 TIMEX3 annotated 
tokens) and target domain data (Reuters and 
Wikipedia) using the TempEval 2010 evaluation 
metrics. Since porting the model onto other do-
mains usually causes a performance drop, our ex-
periments are focused on improving the results by 
employing different bootstrapping strategies1. 

5 Results 

The recognition performance of the model is re-
ported in Table 1 (column “Basic TempEval Mod-
el”) for the source and the target domains. The 
basic TempEval model itself achieves F1-score of 
0.834 on the official TempEval 2010 evaluation 
corpus and has a potential rank 8 among 15 par-
ticipated systems. The top seven TempEval-2 sys-
tems achieved F1-score between 0.83 and 0.86.

However, this model does not port well to the 
Reuters corpus (0.773 vs. 0.834 F1-score). For the 
Wikipedia-based corpus, the basic TempEval mod-
el actually performs a little better than on the 
source domain (0.859 vs. 0.834 F1-score). 

Four bootstrapping strategies were proposed and 
evaluated. Table 1 shows the maximum F1 score 
achieved by each of these strategies, along with the 
number of generated synonyms (between one and 
ten) at which this maximum was achieved. None of 
the bootstrapped models outperformed the basic 
TempEval model on the TempEval 2010 evalua-
tion data, and the WordNet 1st Sense strategy and 
the WordNet Pseudo-Lesk strategy never outper-
formed the basic TempEval model on any corpus. 

However, for the Reuters and Wikipedia cor-
pora, the LWLM and LWLM+WordNet bootstrap-
ping strategies outperformed the basic TempEval 
model. The LWLM strategy gives a large boost to 
model performance on the Reuters corpus from 
0.773 up to 0.826 (a 23.3% error reduction) when 
using the first 5 synonyms. This puts performance 
on Reuters near performance on the TempEval 
domain from which the model was trained (0.834). 
This suggests that the (Reuters-trained) LWLM is 
finding exactly the right kinds of synonyms: those 
that were not originally present in the TempEval 
data but are present in the Reuters test data. On the 
Wikipedia corpus, the LWLM bootstrapping strat-
egy results in a moderate boost, from 0.859 up to 
0.874 (a 10.6% error reduction) when using the 
first three synonyms. Figure 1 shows that using 
more synonyms with this strategy drops perform-

ance on the Wikipedia corpus back down to the 
level of the basic TempEval model. 

The LWLM+WordNet strategy gives a moderate 
boost on the Reuters corpus from 0.773 up to 0.796 
(a 10.1% error reduction) when four synonyms are 
used. Figure 2 shows that using six or more syno-
nyms drops this performance back to just above the 
basic TempEval model. On the Wikipedia corpus, 
the LWLM+WordNet strategy results in a moder-
ate boost, from 0.859 up to 0.877 (a 12.8% error 
reduction), with five synonyms. Using additional 
synonyms results in a small decline in perform-
ance, though even with ten synonyms, the per-
formance is better than the basic TempEval model. 

In general, the LWLM strategy gives the best 
performance, while the LWLM+WordNet strategy 
is less sensitive to the exact number of synonyms 
used when expanding the training data. 

6 TempEval Error Analysis 

We were curious why synonym-based boot-
strapping did not improve performance on the 
source-domain TempEval 2010 data. An error 
analysis suggested that some time expressions 
might have been left unannotated by the human 
annotators. Two of the authors re-annotated the 
TempEval evaluation data, finding inter-annotator 
agreement of 0.912 F1-score with each other, but 
only 0.868 and 0.887 F1-score with the TempEval 
annotators, primarily due to unannotated time ex-
pressions such as 23-year, a few days and third-
quarter.

egy, generating from zero to ten additional training 
examples per instance.

ping strategy, generating from zero to ten additional

Using this re-annotated TempEval 2010 data2, 
we re-evaluated the proposed bootstrapping tech-
niques. Figure 3 and Figure 4 compare perform-
ance on the original TempEval data to performance 
on the re-annotated version. We now see the same 
trends for the TempEval data as were observed for 
the Reuters and Wikipedia corpora: using a small 
number of synonyms from the LWLM to generate 
new training examples leads to performance gains. 
The LWLM bootstrapping model using the first 
synonym achieves 0.861 F1 score, a 22.8% error 
reduction over the baseline of 0.820 F1 score. 

7 Discussion and Conclusions 

We have presented model-portability experiments 
on time expression recognition with a number of 
bootstrapping strategies. These bootstrapping strat-
egies generate additional training examples by 
substituting temporal expression words with poten-
tial synonyms from two sources: WordNet and the 
Latent Word Language Model (LWLM). 

Bootstrapping with LWLM synonyms provides 
a large boost for Reuters data and TempEval data 
and a decent boost for Wikipedia data when the top 
few synonyms are used. Additional synonyms do 
not help, probably because they are too newswire-
specific: both the contexts from the TempEval 
training data and the synonyms from the Reuters-
trained LWLM come from newswire text, so the

lower synonyms are probably more domain-
specific. 

Intersecting the synonyms generated by the 
LWLM and by WordNet moderates the LWLM, 
making the bootstrapping strategy less sensitive to 
the exact number of synonyms used. However, 
while the intersected model performs as well as the 
LWLM model on Wikipedia, the gains over the 
non-bootstrapped model on Reuters and TempEval 
data are smaller. 

Overall, our results show that when porting time 
expression recognition models to other domains, a 
performance drop can be avoided by synonym-
based bootstrapping. Future work will focus on 
using synonym-based expansion in the contexts 
(not just the time expressions headwords), and on 
incorporating contextual information and syntactic 
transformations.
