Abstract 

Based on a lexicon of Portuguese MWE, this 

presentation focuses on an ongoing work that 

aims at the creation of a typology that de-

scribes these expressions taking into account 

their semantic, syntactic and pragmatic prop-

erties. We also plan to annotate each MWE-

entry in the mentioned lexicon according to 

the information obtained from that typology. 

Our objective is to create a valuable resource, 

which will allow for the automatic identifica-

tion MWE in running text and for a deeper 

understanding of these expressions in their 

context. 

1 Introduction 

As it is widely known, the lexicon does not consist 

mainly of simple lexical items but appears to be 

populated with numerous chunks, more or less 

predictable, though not fixed (Firth, 1955). In fact, 

the development of computer technologies and 

corpus-based approaches has enabled the identifi-

cation of complex patterns of word associations, 

proving that the speakers use a large number of 

preconstructed phrases that constitute single choic-

es (Sinclair, 1991:110). Several studies have also 

shown that great part of a speaker’s lexicon is 

composed by these word associations (Jackendoff, 

1997; Fellbaum, 1998). These multiword expres-

sions (MWE)
1
 appear in every kind of spoken and 

                                                           
1 The term multiword expression will be used to refer to any 

sequence of words that act as a single unit, embracing all dif-

ferent types of word combinations (collocations, compound 

nouns, light verbs, institutionalized phrases, idioms, etc.). 

written discourse and, despite the fact that they 

don’t pose any problems from the speaker’s point 

of view (we easily recognize that they function as a 

single unit that may have a specific meaning), nat-

ural language processing (NLP) applications, on 

the other hand, find notorious difficulties when 

dealing with them (Sag et al., 2000). 

Bearing in mind the extreme importance of the 

study of this linguistic phenomenon for the im-

provement of NLP systems, this paper will address 

an ongoing analysis that aims to create a typology 

for MWE in Portuguese (based on a MWE lexicon 

previously extracted from a 50 million word writ-

ten corpus) that will be used to enrich that lexicon 

with extensive information regarding these expres-

sions. This annotated lexicon will be a resource 

that will allow for the annotation of these expres-

sions in running text (Hendrickx et al., 2010a). 

This presentation will briefly discuss compila-

tion of the lexicon and the methodology adopted 

for MWE selection and organization (section 2), 

the typology based on syntactic, semantic and sta-

tistic criteria (section 3), the annotation proposal of 

the lexicon (section 4) and applications of the work 

(section 5). 

2 MWE: Corpus and Lexicon 

The work we are going to present used the lexicon 

of word combinations
2
 that was created within the 

scope of the project COMBINA-PT – Word Com-

binations in Portuguese Language
3
. The corpus 

used for their extraction was 50 million word writ-

 The MWE in the lexicon are organized in order 

to identify a main lemma (from which the MWE 

was selected) and a group lemma, which corre-

sponds to the canonical form of the MWE and 

covers all the variants that occurred in the corpus. 

Concordances lines for each MWE are also avail-

able in KIWIC format. Table 2 illustrates some 

MWE that were identified when analyzing the 

lemma fogo ‘fire’. 
 

Main Lemma

4 CRPC is a monitor corpus of 311 million words, constituted 

by sampling from several types of written and spoken text and 

comprising all the national and regional varieties of Portu-

guese (https://www.clul.ul.pt/en/research-teams/183-

reference-corpus-of-contemporary-portuguese-crpc). 

In all, the lexicon comprises 1.180 main lemmas, 

14.153 group lemmas and 48.154 word combina-

tions. 

 Mendes et al. (2006) describe the criteria used 

for MWE selection: following the results of previ-

ous studies (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Pereira and 

Mendes, 2002), the authors first selected groups 

with MI
5
 values between 8 and 10, and, throughout 

manual validation, applied several criteria upon 

which usually relies the definition of a MWE: 

a) lexical and syntactic fixedness that can be ob-

served through the possibility of replacing ele-

ments, inserting modifiers, changing the 

syntagmatic structure or gender/number features; 

b) total or partial loss of compositional meaning, 

which means that the meaning of the expressions 

can not be predicted by the meaning of the parts; 

c) frequency of occurrence, which means that the 

expressions may be semantically compositional but 

occur with high frequency, revealing sets of fa-

voured co-occurring forms, which could tell that 

they may be in their way to a possible fixedness. 

3 Data Analysis: Towards a Typology 

In contrast to languages for which there is a wide 

range of studies regarding MWE both from a lin-

guistic and a computational point of view, for Por-

tuguese little work has been done so far. Great part 

of the existing studies had paid more attention to 

idiomatic expressions and compound nouns in 

general, relegating the analysis of other types of 

expressions to the morphossyntactic properties of 

its elements (Macário Lopes, 1992; Chacoto, 1994; 

Baptista, 1994; Vilela, 2002; Ranchhod, 2003)
6
. 

Considering the existence of different types of 

MWE with different degrees of syntactic and se-

mantic cohesion, our analysis tries to categorize 

these expressions taking into account their lexical, 

syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties. Thus, 

from a semantic standpoint, three major classes 

were considered: (i) expressions with composition-

al meaning (pão de centeio ‘rye bread’); (ii) ex-
pressions with partial idiomatic meaning, i.e., at 

least one of the elements keeps its literal meaning 

                                                           
5 Statistical association measure (Church and Hanks, 1990). 
6 Some research has been carried out regarding the identifica-

tion and annotation of Complex Predicates, usually called in 

the literature Light Verb Constructions or Support Verb Con-

structions (Hendrickx et al., 2010b; Duran et al., 2011; Zeller 

and Padó, 2012). 

88



(vontade de ferro ‘iron will’); (iii) expressions with 
total idiomatic meaning (pés de galinha ‘crow’s 
feet’). 

 Note, however, that one may find notorious dif-

ficulties regarding the evaluation of the meaning of 

certain expressions that seems to be linked to two 

major factors: (i) the polysemous nature of the 

words (it is necessary to establish a boundary be-

tween compositional and figurative meanings. If 

we consider the literal meaning to be the first pro-

totypical meaning of a word, this restrictive defini-

tion will trigger us to consider a large number of 

MWE as idiomatic); (ii) the awareness of the se-

mantic motivation that had led to the idiomatic 

meanings, which depends on cultural and social 

factors. 

 This semantic criterion implies that the same 

type of MWE may occur in different classes. It is 

the case with compound nouns. Although we tried 

to accentuate the different degrees of lexicalization 

of this type of expressions, we are acutely aware 

that drawing this dividing line neither is easy nor 

allows for accurate definitions and divisions. 

 Within each of these three semantic categories, 

the expressions are also analyzed according to their 

grammatical category and lexical and syntactic 

fixedness. Regarding the latest aspect, the expres-

sions may be: (i) fixed (no variation); (ii) semi-

fixed (nominal/verbal inflection)
7
; (iii) with varia-

tion: lexical (permutation, replacement of ele-

ments, insertion of modifiers) and/or syntactic 

(constructions with passives, relatives, pronouns, 

extraction, adjectival vs. prepositional modifiers). 

 Our typology relies, then, on several categories, 

some of which we will briefly present. 

 

Expressions with Compositional Meaning 
� Favoured co-occurring forms – expressions that 
occurred with high frequency in the corpus, reveal-

ing a tendency to co-occur in certain contexts (pão 
seco ‘dry bread’, desvendar o mistério ‘unravel the 
mystery’). Expressions with full lexical and syn-

tactic variation
8
. 

� Compound nouns – expressions that represent a 
single concept (noite de núpcias ‘wedding night’, 
cama de casal ‘double bed’, cavalo alazão9 ‘chest-
nut horse’, Idade do Ferro ‘Iron Age’). Usually, 
                                                           
7 Since Portuguese is a highly inflectional language, practical-

ly all the verbs and nouns that occur in MWE inflect. 
8 More examples of variation will be included in Section 4. 
9 “Lexikalische Solidaritäten” (Coseriu, 1967). 

these expressions are semi-fixed. However, we 

also observed that some combinations may occur 

in a small distributional paradigm (cama de 
solteiro ‘single bed’) that allows for predicative 
constructions (a cama é de solteiro lit. ‘the bed is 
single’). Entities are fixed. 

� Institutionalized expressions – expressions ob-
served with higher frequency than any alternative 

lexicalization of the same concept (lufada de ar 
fresco ‘breath of fresh air’, condenar ao fracasso 
‘doomed to failure’, abrir um precedente ‘set a 
precedent’). Apart from inflection, since there are 

alternative expressions, we also observed lexical 

variation, such as substitution (rajada de ar fresco 
‘rush of fresh air’), insertion of modifiers 

(condenar este projecto ao fracasso lit. ‘to doom 
this project to failure’) and change in the syntag-

matic structure (o precedente foi aberto ‘a prece-
dent has been set’, abertura de um precedente lit. 
‘the opening of a precedent’). 

� Ligh verb constructions – expressions where 
the noun is used in a normal sense and the verb 

meaning appears to be bleached (dar um passeio 
‘take a walk’). Expressions with lexical and syn-

tactic variation (substitution, insertion of modifi-

ers, change in the syntagmatic structure). 

� proverbs (no poupar é que está o ganho ‘profit 
is in saving’). Despite our conception of proverbs 

as frozen expressions, the fact is that speakers’ lex-

ical creativity may result in the production of ex-

pressions such as no 
anunciar/atacar/descontar/esperar/comparar é 
que está o ganho ‘profit is in announc-
ing/attacking/discounting/waiting/comparing’. 

 

Expressions with Partial Idiomatic Meaning 
� Expressions with an additional meaning that 
can not be derived from the meaning of its parts

10
, 

(cinturão negro ‘black belt’ + martial arts expert, 
abrir a boca ‘open the mouth’ + to speak/to yawn, 
deitar as mãos à cabeça lit. ‘throw the hands in the 
head’ (throw one’s hands up) + despair). Nominal 

expressions are semi-fixed while verbal expres-

sions may undergo inflection and lexical variation, 

such as substitution (levar/lançar as mãos à 
cabeça lit. ‘put/lay the hands in the head’) and in-
sertion of modifiers (deitou logo as mãos à cabeça 
lit. ‘put immediately his hands in his head’). 

                                                           
10 Quasi-phrasemes or quasi-idioms (Mel’cuk, 1998). 

89



� Compound nouns: (i) the meaning does not oc-
cur in any other combination (sorriso amarelo lit. 
‘yellow smile’ → yellow = wry); (ii) the meaning 

may occur in different combinations (café fresco 
‘fresh coffe’, pão fresco ‘fresh bread’ → fresh = 
recent); (iii) periphrastic nouns

11
 (continente negro 

‘black continent’ = Africa); (iv) entities (dama de 
ferro ‘iron lady’). Apart from inflection, some ex-
pressions are subject to lexical and syntactic varia-

tion, namely insertion of modifiers (sorriso muito 
amarelo lit. ‘smile very yellow’), alternation be-
tween simple elements and elements with suffixes 

(sorrisinho amarelo lit. ‘little yellow smile’) and 
alternation between adjectival and prepositional 

modifiers (silêncio mortal ‘deadly silence’, 
silêncio de morte ‘silence of death’). Entities are 
fixed. 

 

Expressions with Total Idiomatic Meaning 
� Expressions transposed to another semantic 
field by metaphoric process (balde de água fria 
‘cold shower’, faca de dois gumes ‘double-edge 
knife’, esticar o pernil ‘kick the bucket’, deitar 
água na fervura ‘pour oil on troubled waters’, a 
sangue frio ‘in cold blood’). Adverbial expressions 
are fixed. Some of the nominal and verbal struc-

tures may undergo lexical and syntactic variation, 

such as substitution (arma/espada/pau de dois 
gumes ‘double-edge weapon/sword/stick’), inser-
tion of modifiers (deitar mais água na fervura 
‘pour more oil on troubled waters’), permutation 

(estar de mãos e pés atados ‘bound hand and foot’, 
estar de pés e mãos atados ‘bound foot and hand’ 
(helpless)) and occurrence both in negative and 

affirmative sentences (ter olhos na cara lit. ‘have 
eyes in the face’ (put things in perspective), não ter 
olhos na cara lit. ‘do not have eyes in the face’). 
� Compound nouns (flor de estufa ‘greenhouse 
plant’ (delicate person); mão de ferro ‘iron fist’). 
Apart from inflection, we observed alternation be-

tween simple elements and elements with suffixes. 

� Proverbs (grão a grão enche a galinha o papo 
lit. ‘grain by grain the hen fills its belly’ (little 

strokes fell great oaks)). As in compositional prov-

erbs, we also observed lexical variation (grão a 
grão enche muita gente o papo lit. ‘grain by grain 
lots of people fill their bellies’). 

 

                                                           
11 Cf. Sanromán, 2000. 

 In what idiomatic expressions are concerned, it 

is important to note the fact that the transposition 

of an expression to another semantic field is a syn-

chronic process that usually implies that at some 

point in time (including the present day) the ex-

pressions may simultaneously present composi-
tional and idiomatic meanings (porto de abrigo 
‘harbor’; ‘safe haven’). Curiously, from a statisti-

cal point of view, our study showed that the idio-

matic meaning is the one that usually presents high 

frequency of occurrence. This information, togeth-

er with the interpretation of the context, may help 

the automatic systems to decide whether they face 

a compositional or idiomatic expression. 

 In a sweeping look at the data, we observed that 

MWE show particular properties according to their 

syntactic pattern. Thus, at the sentence level (prov-

erbs and aphorisms), MWE usually do not accept 

syntactic changes (the possible change seems to be 

lexical, when speakers substitute one or more ele-

ments), while verb phrases admit much more 

morphossyntactic variation. Noun phrases, on the 

other hand, raise specific issues. Compositional 

groups can behave as idiomatic ones and it is not 

always easy to distinguish them. The modifiers of 

the noun can express different semantic relations 

(part of, made of, used for) that may interact with 

the meaning (literal or idiomatic) of the noun. 

4 Annotation of the Lexicon 

The information presented on our typology will 

allow us to enrich the lexicon mentioned in Section 

2. Our purpose is to have each MWE entry in the 

lexicon labeled regarding: (i) canonical form of the 

expression; (ii) definition of idiomatic expressions 

through synonyms or literal paraphrases; (iii) 

grammatical category of both the expression and 

its elements; (iv) idiomatic property and additional 

meanings; (v) possible variation; (vi) function of 

MWE parts (e.g., obligatory, optional, free). 

 As we have seen before, MWE have different 

types of variation for which we have to account 

for. We will briefly discuss our proposal for han-

dling the annotation of some cases of lexical and 

syntactic variation in the lexicon. 

 

Lexical Variation 
� Insertion of modifiers – lexical elements (usual-
ly with an emphatic function) that do not belong to 

the canonical form are not part of the MWE and 

90



are not labeled (sorriso muito amarelo lit. ‘smile 
very yellow’). 

� Lexical substitution – This variation is restrict-
ed to limited set of alternatives. This set is record-

ed in the MWE lexicon as ‘obligatory parts of the 
MWE and member of a set list’ (com-
er/vender/comprar/impingir/levar gato por lebre 
lit. ‘eat/sell/buy/impose/take a cat instead of a 

hare’ (buy a pig in a poke)). 

� Free lexical elements – These elements are 
marked in the lexicon with, e. g., a pronoun 

(ALGUÉM ‘someone’, ALGUM ‘something’) or a 
particular phrase (NP, PP) (estar nas mãos de 
ALGUÉM  ‘to be in the hands of someone’). 
There are also cases where parts of the MWE may 

freely vary, while other parts remain fixed (a 
educação é a mãe de todas as civilizações ‘educa-
tion is the mother of all civilizations’, a liberdade é 
a mãe de todas as virtudes ‘liberty is the mother of 
all virtues’). These cases are treated likewise 

(ALGO é a mãe de todas as NOUN-PL ‘something 
is the mother of all NOUN-PL’) 

Also, since creative use of language can lead to 

MWEs that only partly match the canonical MWE 

(cf. proverbs), we label these parts as 'different 
from canonical form'. 
 

Syntactic Variation 
� Pronouns/Possessives – These elements will be 
marked up as part of the MWE, but will have an 

additional label to signal that they are optional 

(estar nas mãos dele/estar nas suas mãos ‘to be in 
the hands of him’/’to be in his hands’). 

� From active to passive voice – Auxiliary verbs 
are not labeled as part of the MWE (passar ALGO 
a pente fino/ALGO foi passado a pente fino lit. 
‘pass something with a fine tooth-

comb’/‘something was passed with a fine tooth-

comb’ (to scrutinize)). 

 

 According to Hendrickx et al. (2010a), this an-

notated lexicon could be the basis for the annota-

tion of idiomatic MWE in running text
12

. Each 

MWE encountered in the corpus would be annotat-

ed with a link to the corresponding entry in the 

lexicon. Linking each MWE to its canonical form 

                                                           
12

 The authors’ approach is to annotate CINTIL corpus, a 1M 
word corpus of both spoken and written data from different 

sources that has been previously annotated with linguistic 

information such as part-of-speech, lemma, inflection, proper 

names, etc. (http://cintil.ul.pt/pt/). 

would allow for an easier detection of all occur-

rences of one particular MWE and check its varia-

tion in the corpus. The annotation process would 

combine automatic retrieval with manual valida-

tion in order to better account for variable expres-

sions. Without doubt, the corpus would contain 

many MWE that were not yet listed in the lexicon. 

Therefore, each sentence would need to be checked 

manually for new MWE and the newly discovered 

expression would be manually added to the lexi-

con. 

5 Conclusion 

This paper has shown the ongoing research that 

aims to describe, as detailed as possible, the syn-

tactic and semantic properties of different types of 

Portuguese MWE. During our analysis, we en-

countered two major problems: (i) the evaluation 

of the meaning of certain expressions (composi-

tional or idiomatic); (ii) the attempt to account for 

all possible lexical and syntactic variation. The 

information obtained from the typology will be 

used to annotate a MWE lexicon. Having a re-

source with such information (that includes addi-

tional meanings, possible variation that accounts 

for obligatory and optional elements, etc.) will be 

of extreme value for the development and evalua-

tion of automatic MWE identification systems.
