Abstract

We create an open multilingual wordnet
with large wordnets for over 26 languages
and smaller ones for 57 languages. It is
made by combining wordnets with open li-
cences, data from Wiktionary and the Uni-
code Common Locale Data Repository.
Overall there are over 2 million senses
for over 100 thousand concepts, linking
over 1.4 million words in hundreds of lan-
guages.

1 Introduction

We wish to create a lexicon covering as many lan-
guages as possible, with as much useful informa-
tion as possible. Generally, language resources, to
be useful, must be both accessible (legal to use)
and usable (of sufficient quality, size and with a
documented interface) (Ishida, 2006). We address
both of these concerns in this paper.

One of the many attractions of the semantic net-
work WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), is that there are
numerous wordnets being built for different lan-
guages. There are, in addition, many projects
for groups of languages: Euro WordNet (Vossen,
1998), BalkaNet (Tufiş et al., 2004), Asian Word-
net (Charoenporn et al., 2008) and more. Al-
though there are over 60 languages for which
wordnets exist in some state of development (Fell-
baum and Vossen, 2012, 316), less than half of
these have released any data, and for those that
have, the data is often not freely accessible (Bond
and Paik, 2012). For those wordnets that are avail-
able, they are of widely varying size and quality,
both in terms of accuracy and richness. Further,
there is very little standardization in terms of for-
mat, what information is included, or license.

The goal of the research outlined in this paper
is to make it possible for a researcher interested in
working on the lexical semantics of a language or

languages to be able to access wordnets for those
languages with a minimum of legal and technical
barriers. In practice this means making it possible
to access multiple wordnets with a common inter-
face. We also use sources of semi-structured data
that have minimal legal restrictions to automati-
cally extend existing freely available wordnets and
to create additional wordnets which can be added
to our open wordnet grid.

Previous studies have leveraged multiple word-
nets and Wiktionary (Wikimedia, 2013) to extend
existing wordnets or create new ones (de Melo and
Weikum, 2009; Hanoka and Sagot, 2012). These
studies passed over the valuable sense groupings
of translations within Wiktionary and merely used
Wiktionary as a source of translations that were
not disambiguated according to sense. The present
study built and extended wordnets by directly link-
ing Wiktionary senses to WordNet senses.

Meyer and Gurevych (2011) demonstrated the
ability to automatically identify many matching
senses in Wiktionary and WordNet based on the
similarity of monolingual features. Our study
combines monolingual features with the disam-
biguating power of multiple languages. In ad-
dition to differences in linking methodology, our
project gives special attention to ensuring the max-
imum re-usability and accessibility of the data and
software released.

Other large scale multilingual lexicons have
been made by linking wordnet to Wikipedia
(Wikipedia, 2013; de Melo and Weikum, 2010;
Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). Our approach is
complementary to these: in general Wikipedia has
more entities than classes, while Wiktionary has
more classes.

In Section 2 we discuss linking freely available
wordnets to form a single multilingual semantic
network. In Section 3 we extend the wordnets with
data from two sources. We show the results in
Section 4 and then discuss them and outline future

work in Section 5.

2 Linking Multiple Wordnets

In order to make the data from existing wordnet
projects more accessible, we have built a simple
database with information from those wordnets
with licenses that allow redistribution of the data.
These wordnets, their licenses and recent activity
are summarized in Table 1 (sizes for most of them
are shown in Table 2).1

Table 1: Linked Open Wordnets

The first wordnet developed is the Princeton
WordNet (PWN: Fellbaum, 1998). It is a large
lexical database of English. Open class words
(nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) are grouped
into concepts represented by sets of synonyms
(synsets). Synsets are linked by semantic relations
such as hyponomy and meronomy. PWN is re-
leased under an open license (allowing one to use,
copy, modify and distribute it so long as you prop-
erly acknowledge the copyright).

The majority of freely available wordnets take
the basic structure of the PWN and add new lem-
mas (words) to the existing synsets: the extend
model (Vossen, 2005). For example, dogn:1 is
linked to the lemmas chien in French, anjing in
Malay, and so on. It is widely realized that this

1We have now added Mandarin Chinese.

model is imperfect as different languages lexical-
ize different concepts and link them in different
ways (Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012). Nevertheless,
many projects have found that the overall structure
of PWN serves as a useful scaffold. The fact that,
for example, a dogn:1 is an animaln:1 is language
independent.

In theory, such wordnets can easily be com-
bined into a single resource by using the PWN
synsets as pivots. All languages are linked through
the English wordnet. Because they are linked at
the synset level, the problem of ambiguity one gets
when linking bilingual dictionaries through a com-
mon language is resolved: we are linking senses to
senses.

In practice, linking a new language’s wordnet
into the grid could be problematic for three rea-
sons. The first problem was that the wordnets were
linked to various versions of the Princeton Word-
Net. In order to combine them into a single multi-
lingual structure, we had to map to a common ver-
sion. The second problem was the incredible va-
riety of formats that the wordnets are distributed
in. Almost every project uses a different format.
Even different versions of the same project often
had slightly different formats. The final problem
was legal: not all wordnets have been released un-
der licenses that allow reuse.

The first problem can largely be overcome us-
ing the mapping scripts from Daude et al. (2003).
Mapping introduces some distortions, in particu-
lar, when a synset is split, we chose to only map
the translations to the most probable mapping, so
some new synsets will have no translations.

The second problem we are currently solving
through brute force, writing a new script for ev-
ery new project we add. We make these scripts,
along with the reformatted wordnets, freely avail-
able for download. Any problems or bugs found
when converting the wordnets have been reported
back to the original projects, with many of them
fixed in newer releases. We consider this feedback
to be an important part of our work: it means that
other researchers and users do not have to suffer
from the same problems and it encourages projects
to release updates.

The third, legal, problem is being solved by
an ongoing campaign to encourage projects to
(re-)release their data under open licenses. Since
Bond and Paik (2012) surveyed wordnet licenses
in 2011, six projects have newly released data un-

1353



der open licenses and eight projects have updated
their data.

Our combined wordnet includes English (Fell-
baum, 1998); Albanian (Ruci, 2008); Arabic
(Black et al., 2006); Chinese (Huang et al., 2010);
Danish (Pedersen et al., 2009); Finnish (Lindén
and Carlson., 2010); French (Sagot and Fišer,
2008); Hebrew (Ordan and Wintner, 2007); In-
donesian and Malaysian (Nurril Hirfana et al.,
2011); Italian (Pianta et al., 2002); Japanese
(Isahara et al., 2008); Norwegian (Bokmål and
Nynorsk: Lars Nygaard 2012, p.c.); Persian (Mon-
tazery and Faili, 2010); Portuguese (de Paiva
and Rademaker, 2012); Polish (Piasecki et al.,
2009); Thai (Thoongsup et al., 2009) and Basque,
Catalan, Galician and Spanish from the Multilin-
gual Common Repository (Gonzalez-Agirre et al.,
2012).

On our server, the wordnets are all in a shared
sqlite database using the schema produced by
the Japanese WordNet project (Isahara et al.,
2008). The database is based on the logical struc-
ture of the Princeton WordNet, with an additional
language attribute for lemmas, examples, defini-
tions and senses. It is a single open multilingual
resource. When we redistribute the data, each
project’s data is made available separately, with a
common format, but separate licenses.

The Scandinavian and Polish wordnets are
based on the merge approach, where indepen-
dent language specific structures are built and then
some synsets linked to PWN. Typically only a
small subset will be linked (due more to resource
limitations than semantic incompatibility).

2.1 Core Concepts

Boyd-Graber et al. (2006) created a list of 5,000
core word senses in Princeton WordNet which
represent approximately the 5,000 most frequently
used word senses.2 We use this list to evaluate the
coverage of the wordnets: do they contain words
for the most common concepts? As a very rough
measure of useful coverage, we report the percent-
age of synsets covered from this core list. Because
the list is based on English data, it is of course not
a perfect measure for other languages and cultures.
Note that some wordnet projects have deliberately
targeted the core concepts, which of course boosts
their coverage scores.

2The original list is here from http://wordnetcode.
princeton.edu/standoff-files/core-wordnet.txt;
we converted it to wn30 synsets.

2.2 License Types

The licenses fall into four broad categories: (u)
completely unrestricted, (a) attribution required,
(s) share alike, and (n) non-commercial. The first
category includes any work that is in the public
domain or that the author has released without any
restrictions. The second category allows anyone
to use, adapt, improve, and redistribute the work as
long as one attributes the work in the manner spec-
ified by the copyright holder (without suggesting
an endorsement). The WordNet, MIT, and CC BY
licenses are all in this category. The third category
allows anyone to adapt and improve the licensed
work and redistribute it, but the redistributed work
must be released under the same license. The CC
BY-SA, GPL, GFDL, and CeCILL-C licenses are
of this type. Because derivative works can only
be redistributed under the same license, works li-
censed under any two of these licenses cannot
be combined with each other and legally redis-
tributed. In general, a work formed from the com-
bination of works in category (u) and (a) with a
work in category (s) will be subject to the more re-
strictive terms of the the share alike license. How-
ever, the GPL, GFDL and CeCILL-C are incom-
patible with CC BY.3 The fourth type of license
further forbids the commercial use of a work. The
CC BY-NC and the CC BY-NC-SA licenses are in
this category, they are also incompatible with li-
censes in category (s).

Releasing a work under the more restrictive li-
censes in categories (s) and (n) above substantially
limit and complicate the ability to extend and com-
bine a work into other useful forms. By maintain-
ing a separation of databases released under in-
compatible licenses, we avoid any possible legal
problems. Due to license incompatibilities, it is
impossible to release a single database with all the
wordnets, even though individually they are redis-
tributable. We can currently combine those with
licenses in groups (u) and (a) and the CC BY-
SA wordnets (now everything except French and
Basque).

3 Extending with non-wordnet data

We looked at two sources for automatically adding
new entries. The Unicode Common Locale Data
Repository (CLDR) has reliable information on
languages, territories and dates. Wiktionary is a

html\#ccby

1354



general purpose lexicon with much more informa-
tion for many words.

3.1 Unicode Common Locale Data
Repository (CLDR)

We added information on languages, territories
and dates from the Unicode Common Locale Data
Repository (CLDR).4 This is a collection of data
maintained by the Unicode Consortium to support
software internationalization and localization with
locale information on formatting dates, numbers,
currencies, times, and time zones, as well as help
for choosing languages and countries by name. It
has this data for over 194 languages. It is released
under an open license that allows redistribution
with proper attribution (Unicode, Inc., 2012).5

We found data for 122 languages. Most had
around 550 senses (synsets and their lemmas): for
example, for Portuguese: Englishn:1 inglês. Some
had only 40 or 50, such as Assamese, which only
has the week days, month names and a few lan-
guage names. The linked data was small enough
to check by hand. When the original CLDR data
is correct the data we generate should be correct.

The idea of using such data is not new. Quah
et al. (2001) for example, use Linux locale data
to extend a proprietary English-Malay lexicon.
de Melo and Weikum (2009) also use this data
(and data from a variety of other sources) to build
an enhanced wordnet, in addition adding new
synsets for concepts that are not in not wordnet.
However, when they released the data as LEXVO
(data about languages: CC BY-SA) and UWN (the
universal multilingual wordnet: CC BY-NC-SA),
they added additional license restrictions which
complicate the reuse of the data and make it im-
possible to integrate the data back into the original
wordnet project.

3.2 Wiktionary

Searches for a publicly-available source of Wik-
tionary in a preprocessed, machine-readable for-
mat did not turn up any sources that were recent
and publicly-available.6 Although there are sev-

4http://cldr.unicode.org/
5With the extra requirement that “there is clear notice in

each modified Data File or in the Software as well as in the
documentation associated with the Data File(s) or Software
that the data or software has been modified.”

6We later learned that McCrae et al. (2012) made a release
of Wiktionary in the lemon format (http://datahub.io/
en/dataset/dbnary). They did not, however, release the
code they used to parse Wiktionary.

eral freely-available software programs that are
capable of parsing portions of the English Wik-
tionary, none of the programs that were evaluated
appeared to extract the precise set of information
desired for our task in an easy-to-use format. So
the authors decided to build a custom parser capa-
ble of extracting the information needed for build-
ing open wordnets.

3.2.1 Wiktionary Parser

Since each language edition of Wiktionary is for-
matted in a somewhat unique way, parsers must
be tailored to recognize the structure and format-
ting of each edition on a case-by-case basis. The
authors created a parser tailored to the English
Wiktionary, although it can be extended to handle
other language versions as well. We are releasing
this code under the MIT license.7

The current version of the parser is capable of
extracting headwords, parts of speech, definitions,
synonyms and translations from the XML Wik-
tionary database dumps provided by the Wikime-
dia Foundation.8 Within these large XML files,
the main body of Wiktionary articles are stored in
a Wikitext format, which is a semi-structured for-
mat. Although anyone can edit a Wiktionary page
and use any style of formatting they desire, the
community of users encourages adhering to estab-
lished guidelines, which produces a format that is
generally predictable.

Within the English Wiktionary, synonyms and
translations are both grouped into sense groups
that correspond with definitions in the main sec-
tion. These sense groups are marked by a short
text gloss (short gloss), which is usually an abbre-
viated version of one of the full definitions (full
definition). The parser makes no attempt to match
these short glosses with the full definitions. Data
is simply extracted, cleaned, and then stored in a
relational database or flat file.

Translations proved to be easy to extract due
to the fairly consistent use of a specifically for-
matted translation template. These templates in-
clude a language code derived from ISO standards,
the translation, and optional additional informa-
tion such as gender, transliteration, script, and al-
ternate forms. The parser extracts and retains all
of this potentially valuable information.

Examples of translation templates:

• Finnish: {{t+|fi|sanakirja}}

• French: {{t+|fr|dictionnaire|m}}

To enable later processing, it is necessary to tie
synonyms and translations to their corresponding
short gloss via a unique key. Most parsers simply
use an automatically generated surrogate key or a
key based on the ordered position of data within
a Wiktionary article. Since Wiktionary is con-
stantly changing, the side effect of this approach
is that data extracted from a specific snapshot of
the Wiktionary database can only be meaningfully
used in connection with other data extracted by
the same parser from the exact same snapshot. To
overcome this, we use a unique key that can be
recreated from the data itself, which we call the
defkey. To generate this key, we concatenate the
language code, headword, part of speech, and the
short gloss and use the sha1 hash function (NIST,
2012) to create a unique 40-character hexadecimal
string from the resulting text.

These defkeys are time and technology indepen-
dent, so they allow the ability for researchers to
efficiently share and compare results. Once a link
is established between this defkey and a particu-
lar synset, translations added to Wiktionary at a
later data can be automatically integrated into our
multilingual wordnet. Conversely, if a Wiktionary
contributor changes a short gloss, historical data
connected to the old defkey is preserved while new
data imported at a later time will not be incorrectly
linked to an older definition.

Another feature of our parser is a feedback
mode, which generates a report about poorly for-
mated data that was encountered. These automat-
ically generated reports can be used to create a
quality-enhancing feedback loop with Wiktionary.

3.2.2 Linking Senses

Meyer and Gurevych (2011) showed that auto-
matic alignments between Wiktionary senses and
PWN can be established with reasonable accuracy
and recall by combining multiple text similarity
scores to compare a bag of words based on several
pieces of information linked to a WordNet sense
with another bag of words obtained from a Wik-
tionary entry. In our study we evaluated the poten-
tial for aligning senses based on common transla-
tions in combination with monolingual similarity
features.

In this study we used 20 of the wordnets de-

scribed in Section 2,9 and the Wiktionary data ob-
tained using the parser described in Section 3.2.1.
Before searching for translation matches, we nor-
malized the data to ensure the most accurate pos-
sible overlap count. First, article headwords were
included as English translations of Wiktionary
senses (along with synonyms). Then differences
in language codes were rectified and translations
containing symbolic characters or a mixture of ro-
man and non-roman characters were marked to be
ignored, save a few exceptions. This left approx-
imately 1.4 million sense translations in 20 lan-
guages in our wordnet grid, and nearly 1.3 million
Wiktionary translations in over 1,000 languages.

We then created a list of all possible align-
ments where at least one translation of a wordnet
sense matched a translation of a Wiktionary sense.
This represented a small percentage of the possi-
ble alignments, because definitions in Wiktionary
that do not contain any translations were ignored
in our study. Of more than 500,000 English defini-
tions in Wiktionary, only about 130,000 presently
have associated translations. The resulting graph
contained over 700,000 possible sense alignments.

We calculated a number of similarity scores, the
first two based on similarity in the number of lem-
mas, calculated using the Jaccard index:

sime(sn,sk) =
|E(sk)∩E(sn)|
|E(sk)∪E(sn)|

(1)

sima(sn,sk) =
|L(sk)∩L(sn)|
|L(sk)∪L(sn)|

(2)

Where sk,sn are concepts in Wiktionary and word-
net respectively,10 E(s) is the set of English lem-
mas for sense s and L(s) is the set of lemmas in all
languages.

As an initial pruning, we kept only matches
where either: sima ≥ 0.7 or (sime ≥ 0.5 and
sima ≥ 0.5) or, if (|L(sk) ∩ L(sn)| > 5) then
(sime ≥ 0.5 and sima ≥ 0.45). After apply-
ing these filters, approximately 220,000 alignment
candidates remained.

We reviewed a random sample of 551 alignment
candidates. Of these 136 were deemed correctly
aligned. Another 48 we considered possibly close
enough to produce valid translations for wordnet.
All others were marked as incorrect alignments.

9We didn’t use Chinese or Polish, as the wordnets were
added after we had started the evaluation.

10Precisely, synsets in wordnet and senses in Wiktionary.

1356



This development dataset was used to tune re-
fined similarity scores.

simt(sn,sk) =
|L(sk)∩L(sn)|√
α |L(sk)∪L(sn)|

(3)

simd(sn,sk) =
BoW(wndef)·BoW(wkdef)

‖BoW(wndef)‖‖BoW(wkdef)‖ (4)

simc(sn,sk) = simt+β simc (5)

simt gives higher weight to concepts that link
through more lemmas, not just a higher proportion
of lemmas.

simd measures the similarity of the definitions
in the two resources, using a cosine similarity
score. We initially used the WordNet gloss and
example sentence(s) for wndef and the short gloss
from Wiktionary for wkdef. This improved the ac-
curacy of the combined ranking score (simc), but
since many of the short glosses are only one or
two words, the sparse input often produced a simd
score of zero even when the candidate alignment
was correct. To improve the accuracy of the simd
component, we also added in the long definitions.

Short glosses were aligned with long definitions
using a similar approach to McCrae et al. (2012).
First we search for a match where the short gloss
was a substring of the full definition. If that failed
to produce a single possible alignment, we aligned
the short gloss with the full definition that pro-
duced the greatest cosine similarity score. Finally,
where the short definition was blank and only a
long definition was present, we aligned the two.
The results of this alignment were less than 90%
accurate, so to offset the effects of this noise we in-
cluded both the full definition and the short gloss
in wkdef. For wndef we used the WordNet gloss,
example sentence(s), and synonyms. Even though
the linking of definitions within Wiktionary left
much to be desired, the increased amount of text
improved the accuracy of the definition based sim-
ilarity component of our ranking score.

Our combined ranking score (simc), based on
both overlapping translations and a monolingual
lexical similarity score, was able to outperform
ranking based on either component in isolation.
We expect that an improved alignment of short
glosses to full definitions together with more ac-
curate measures of lexical similarity such as de-
scribed by Meyer and Gurevych (2011) would fur-
ther improve the accuracy of a combined ranking
score. We employed our combined ranking score
first as a filter, where simc ≥ τc. The ranking score

is then used to select the best match among com-
peting alignments. Alignments are based on the
belief that a definition within Wiktionary should
only map to a single WordNet synset (if any at
all). In theory, each WordNet synset should rep-
resent a meaning distinguishable from all other
synsets. Because Wiktionary is organized accord-
ing to lemma first, and sense second, multiple def-
initions in separate articles often map to the same
synset. For example mortal “A human; someone
susceptible to death”, individual “A person con-
sidered alone . . . ”, and person “A single human
being; an individual” all align with someonen:1
(00007846-n). However, two distinct definitions
within the same Wiktionary entry should not map
to the same WordNet sense. When there are mul-
tiple possible alignments where only one can be
valid, simc is used to determine the best match.

In addition to using the combined ranking score
as a filter, we found that we could obtain a small
additional increase in accuracy without reducing
recall by also requiring simt ≥ τt or simd ≥ τd .

To determine ideal values for the weights and
thresholds, we performed several grid searches.
The parameters are interdependent and can pro-
duce reasonable results at a variety of points. Ideal
values also depend on whether we wish to maxi-
mize accuracy or recall. α is set at 3.2 in order to
achieve an ideal target threshold of τt = 1. We fi-
nally chose values of β = 0.7 and τc = 0.71 which
gave a reasonable balance between accuracy and
recall.

4 Results and Evaluation

We give the data for the 26 wordnets with more
than 10,000 synsets in Table 2. There are a further
57 with more than 1,000; 133 with more than 100,
200 with more than 10 and 645 with more than 1
(although most of the very small languages appear
to be simple errors in the language code entered
into Wiktionary). Individual totals are shown for
synsets and senses from the original wordnets, the
data extracted from Wiktionary, and the merged
data of the wordnets, Wiktionary and CLDR. We
do not show the CLDR data in the table as it is
so small, generally 500-600 synsets for the top
languages. Overall there are 2,040,805 senses for
117,659 concepts, using over 1,400,000 words in
over 1,000 languages.

The smaller wordnets are not of much practi-
cal use, but can still serve as the core of new

projects. The bigger wordnets show the data from
Wiktionary (and to a lesser extent CLDR) having
only a small increase in the number of senses. The
biggest change is for the medium size projects,
such as Persian or Arabic, which end up with
much better coverage of the most frequent core
concepts. Major languages such as German or
Russian, which currently do not have open word-
nets get good coverage as well.

The size of the mapping table is the same as the
number of English senses linked (49,951 senses).
We evaluated a random sample of 160 alignments
and found the accuracy to be 90% (Wiktionary
sense maps to the best possible wordnet sense).

We then evaluated samples of the wordnet cre-
ated from Wiktionary for several languages. For
each language we choose 100 random senses, then
checked them against existing wordnets.11 For all
unmatched entries, we then had them checked by
native speakers. The results are given in Table 3.
The sense accuracy is higher than the mapping ac-
curacy: in general, entries with more translations
are linked more accurately, thus raising the av-
erage precision. During the extraction and eval-

11For Chinese we use the wordnet from Xu et al. (2008),
which is free for research but cannot be redistributed. For
German we used Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998).

uation, we noticed several language specific fea-
tures: for example, Serbo-Croatian had a mixture
of Cyrillic and Latin entries. For languages where
one script was clearly dominant, we kept only that,
but really these decisions should be done for each
language by a native speaker.

We make the data available in two ways. The
first is a set of downloads. Each language has up
to three files: the data from the wordnet project
(if it exists), the data from the CLDR and the data
from Wiktionary. They are kept separate in order

1358



to keep the licenses as free as possible. The sec-
ond is as two on-line searches: one using only the
data from the projects, and one with all the data
combined. The combination is done by simple
union.12 We maintain this separation as we can-
not guarantee the quality of the automatically ex-
tracted data. Because the raw data is there it is pos-
sible to combine them in other ways. The simple
structure is easy to manipulate, and there is code
to use this style of data with the popular tool kit
NLTK (Bird et al., 2010).

5 Discussion and Future Work

We have created a large open wordnet of high
quality (85%–99% measured on senses). Twenty
six languages have more than 10,000 concepts
covered, with 42–100% coverage of the most com-
mon core concepts. The data is easily download-
able with minimal restrictions. The overall ac-
curacy is estimated at over 94%, as most of the
original wordnets are hand verified (and so should
be 100% accurate). The high accuracy is largely
thanks to the disambiguating power of the multi-
ple translations, made possible by the many open
wordnets we have access to.

Because we link senses between wordnet and
Wiktionary and then use the translations of the
sense, manually validating this mapping will im-
prove the entries in multiple languages simultane-
ously. As the Wiktionary-wordnet alignment map-
ping is linked to persistent keys it will remain use-
ful even as the resources change. Further, it can be
used to identify and add missing senses to word-
net: unmapped Wiktionary entries are candidates
for new concepts.

The Universal Wordnet (UWN: de Melo and
Weikum, 2009) brings in data from even more re-
sources, and combines them to make a larger re-
source, choosing parameters with slightly lower
precision (just under 90%). It is further linked to
Wikipedia, adding many named entities. We ex-
pect that our work is complementary. Because
we use a different approach, it would be possi-
ble to merge the two if the licenses allowed us
to. However, since the CC BY-SA and CC-BY-
NC-SA licenses are mutually exclusive, the two
works cannot be combined and rereleased unless
relevant parties can relicense the works. There is
no easy way to improve UWN beyond checking
each and every entry, which is expensive. An ad-

12http://casta-net.jp/~kuribayashi/multi/

vantage of our approach, noted above, is that we
can validate the sense matches for English and the
accuracy percolates down to all the languages.

Integrating data from the most recent version
of Wiktionary can be done simply and takes a
few hours. It is therefore feasible to update the
downloadable data regularly. Improvements in ei-
ther the wordnet projects or Wiktionary (or both)
can also result in improved mappings. We further
hope to take advantage of ongoing initiatives in the
global wordnet grid to add new concepts not in the
Princeton WordNet, so that we can expand beyond
an English-centered world view.

By making the data from multiple sources eas-
ily available with minimal restrictions, we hope
that it will be easier to do research that exploits
lexical semantics. In particular, we make the data
easily accessible to the original wordnet projects,
some of whom have already started to merge it
into their own resources. We cannot check the
accuracy of data in all languages, nor, for exam-
ple, check that synsets have the most appropriate
lemmas associated with them. Many languages
have their own orthographic issues (for example
a choice of scripts, or the choice to include vow-
els or not). Our automatic extraction does not deal
with these issues at all. This kind of language spe-
cific quality control is best done by the individual
wordnet projects.

We also consider it important to keep feeding
data back to the individual wordnet projects, as
much of the innovative research comes from them:
the class/instance distinction from PWN; the dis-
tinction between rigid and non-rigid synsets from
the Kyoto Project; domain mappings from the
MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002); representing
orthographic variation from the Japanese Wordnet
(Kuroda et al., 2011); combining close languages
from the Wordnet Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana et al.,
2011); and so on. For all of these reasons, we
do not consider automatic extraction from/linking
to Wiktionary a substitute for building languages
specific wordnets.

Further work that this data should allow us to
do include: automatically producing a list of bad
data found in Wiktionary that can be used by Wik-
tionary editors to correct errors; and finding gaps
in wordnet by identifying senses in Wiktionary
that have a large number of translations, but fail to
have any significant alignment with existing word-
net synsets.

1359



We currently only link through the English Wik-
tionary and its translations. It should be possible to
expand the multilingual wordnet in the same way
using Wiktionaries in other languages, which we
would expect to improve coverage.

Finally, Wiktionary contains a lot of useful in-
formation we are not currently using (information
on gender, transliterations, pronunciations, alter-
native spellings and so forth). We can also think
of the aligned definitions as a paraphrase corpus
for English.

We have devoted more space than is usual for
a computational linguistics paper to issues of li-
censing and sustainability. This is deliberate: we
feel papers about lexical resources should be clear
about licensing, and that it should be considered
early on when creating new resources. There are
strong arguments that open data leads to better sci-
ence (Pederson, 2008), and it has been shown that
open resources are cited more (Bond and Paik,
2012). In addition, how to maintain resources over
time is a major unsolved problem. We consider it
important that our wordnet is not just large and ac-
curate but also maintainable and as accessible as
possible.

6 Conclusions

We have created an open multilingual wordnet
with over 26 languages. It is made by combining
wordnets with open licences, data from the Uni-
code Common Locale Data Repository and Wik-
tionary. Overall there are over 2 million senses for
117,659 concepts, using over 1.4 million words in
hundreds of languages.
