Abstract

This paper discusses a machine translation
evaluation task conducted using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk. We present a translation ade-
quacy assessment task for untrained Arabic-
speaking annotators and discuss several tech-
niques for normalizing the resulting data. We
present a novel 2-stage normalization tech-
nique shown to have the best performance on
this task and further discuss the results of all
techniques and the usability of the resulting
adequacy scores.

1 Introduction

Human judgments of translation quality play a vital
role in the development of effective machine trans-
lation (MT) systems. Such judgments can be used
to measure system quality in evaluations (Callison-
Burch et al., 2009) and to tune automatic metrics
such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) which
act as stand-ins for human evaluators. However, col-
lecting reliable human judgments often requires sig-
nificant time commitments from expert annotators,
leading to a general scarcity of judgments and a sig-
nificant time lag when seeking judgments for new
tasks or languages.

Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service fa-
cilitates inexpensive collection of large amounts of
data from users around the world. However, Turk-
ers are not trained to provide reliable annotations for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and some
Turkers attempt to game the system by submitting
random answers. For these reasons, NLP tasks must
be designed to be accessible to untrained users and

data normalization techniques must be employed to
ensure that the data collected is usable.

This paper describes a MT evaluation task for
translations of English into Arabic conducted us-
ing MTurk and compares several data normaliza-
tion techniques. A novel 2-stage normalization tech-
nique is demonstrated to produce the highest agree-
ment between Turkers and experts while retaining
enough judgments to provide a robust tuning set for
automatic evaluation metrics.

2 Data Set

Our data set consists of human adequacy judgments
for automatic translations of 1314 English sentences
into Arabic. The English source sentences and Ara-
bic reference translations are taken from the Arabic-
English sections of the NIST Open Machine Trans-
lation Evaluation (Garofolo, 2001) data sets for 2002
through 2005. Selected sentences are between 10
and 20 words in length on the Arabic side. Arabic
machine translation (MT) hypotheses are obtained
by passing the English sentences through Google’s
free online translation service.

2.1 Data Collection

Human judgments of translation adequacy are col-
lected for each of the 1314 Arabic MT output hy-
potheses. Given a translation hypothesis and the
corresponding reference translation, annotators are
asked to assign an adequacy score according to the
following scale:

4 – Hypothesis is completely meaning equivalent
with the reference translation.

57



3 – Hypothesis captures more than half of meaning
of the reference translation.

2 – Hypothesis captures less than half of meaning
of the reference translation.

1 – Hypothesis captures no meaning of the refer-
ence translation.

Adequacy judgments are collected from untrained
Arabic-speaking annotators using Amazon’s Me-
chanical Turk (MTurk) service. We create a human
intelligence task (HIT) type that presents Turkers
with a MT hypothesis/reference pair and asks for
an adequacy judgment. To make this task accessi-
ble to non-experts, the traditional definitions of ad-
equacy scores are replaced with the following: (4)
excellent, (3) good, (2) bad, (1) very bad. Each rat-
ing is accompanied by an example from the data set
which fits the corresponding criteria from the tradi-
tional scale. To make this task accessible to the Ara-
bic speakers we would like to complete the HITs,
the instructions are provided in Arabic as well as En-
glish.

To allow experimentation with various data nor-
malization techniques, we collect judgments from
10 unique Turkers for each of the translations. We
also ask an expert to provide “gold standard” judg-
ments for 101 translations drawn uniformly from the
data. These 101 translations are recombined with the
data and repeated such that every 6th translation has
a gold standard judgment, resulting in a total of 1455
HITs. We pay Turkers $0.01 per HIT and Ama-
zon fees of $0.005 per HIT, leading to a total cost
of $218.25 for data collection and an effective cost
of $0.015 per judgment. Despite requiring Arabic
speakers, our HITs are completed at a rate of 1000-
3000 per day. It should be noted that the vast ma-
jority of Turkers working on our HITs are located in
India, with fewer in Arabic-speaking countries such
as Egypt and Syria.

3 Normalization Techniques

We apply multiple normalization techniques to the
data set and evaluate their relative performance.
Several techniques use the following measures:

• ∆: For judgments (J = j1...jn) and gold stan-
dard (G = g1...gn), we define average distance:

∆(J,G) =
∑n

i=1 |gi − ji|
n

• K: For two annotators, Cohen’s kappa coeffi-
cient (Smeeton, 1985) is defined:

K =
P (A)− P (E)

1− P (E)

where P (A) is the proportion of times that an-
notators agree and P (E) is the proportion of
times that agreement is expected by chance.

3.1 Straight Average

The baseline approach consists of keeping all judg-
ments and taking the straight average on a per-
translation basis without additional normalization.

3.2 Removing Low-Agreement Judges

Following Callison-Burch et al. (2009), we calcu-
late pairwise inter-annotator agreement (P (A)) of
each annotator with all others and remove judgments
from annotators with P (A) below some threshold.
We set this threshold such that the highest overall
agreement can be achieved while retaining at least
one judgment for each translation.

3.3 Removing Outlying Judgments

For a given translation and human judgments
(j1...jn), we calculate the distance (δ) of each judg-
ment from the mean (j̄):

δ(ji) = |ji − j̄|

We then remove outlying judgments with δ(ji) ex-
ceeding some threshold. This threshold is also set
such that the highest agreement is achieved while
retaining at least one judgment per translation.

3.4 Weighted Voting

Following Callison-Burch (2009), we treat evalua-
tion as a weighted voting problem where each anno-
tator’s contribution is weighted by agreement with
either a gold standard or with other annotators. For
this evaluation, we weigh contribution by P (A) with
the 101 gold standard judgments.

58



3.5 Scaling Judgments
To account for the notion that some annotators judge
translations more harshly than others, we apply per-
annotator scaling to the adequacy judgments based
on annotators’ signed distance from gold standard
judgments. For judgments (J = j1...jn) and gold
standard (G = g1...gn), an additive scaling factor is
calculated:

λ+(J,G) =
∑n

i=1 gi − ji
n

Adding this scaling factor to each judgment has the
effect of shifting the judgments’ center of mass to
match that of the gold standard.

3.6 2-Stage Technique
We combine judgment scaling with weighted vot-
ing to produce a 2-stage normalization technique
addressing two types of divergence in Turker judg-
ments from the gold standard. Divergence can be
either consistent, where Turkers regularly assign
higher or lower scores than experts, or random,
where Turkers guess blindly or do not understand
the task.

Stage 1: Given a gold standard (G = g1...gn),
consistent divergences are corrected by calculat-
ing λ+(J,G) for each annotator’s judgments (J =
ji...jn) and applying λ+(J,G) to each ji to produce
adjusted judgment set J ′. If ∆(J ′, G) < ∆(J,G),
where ∆(J,G) is defined in Section 3, the annotator
is considered consistently divergent and J ′ is used
in place of J . Inconsistently divergent annotators’
judgments are unaffected by this stage.

Stage 2: All annotators are considered in a
weighted voting scenario. In this case, annotator
contribution is determined by a distance measure
similar to the kappa coefficient. For judgments (J =
j1...jn) and gold standard (G = g1...gn), we define:

K∆(J,G) =
(max ∆−∆(J,G))− E(∆)

max ∆− E(∆)
where max ∆ is the average maximum distance be-
tween judgments and E(∆) is the expected distance
between judgments. Perfect agreement with the gold
standard produces K∆ = 1 while chance agreement
produces K∆ = 0. Annotators with K∆ ≤ 0 are re-
moved from the voting pool and final scores are cal-
culated as the weighted averages of judgments from
all remaining annotators.

Type ∆ K∆
Uniform-a 1.02 0.184
Uniform-b 1.317 -0.053
Gaussian-2 1.069 0.145
Gaussian-2.5 0.96 0.232
Gaussian-3 1.228 0.018

4 Results

Table 1 outlines the performance of all normaliza-
tion techniques. To calculate P (A) and K with the
gold standard, final adequacy scores are rounded to
the nearest whole number. As shown in the table, re-
moving low-agreement annotators or outlying judg-
ments greatly improves Turker agreement and, in
the case of removing judgments, decreases distance
from the gold standard. However, these approaches
remove a large portion of the judgments, leaving a
skewed data set. When removing judgments, 1172
of the 1314 translations receive a score of 3, making
tasks such as tuning automatic metrics infeasible.

Weighing votes by agreement with the gold stan-
dard retains most judgments, though neither Turker
agreement nor agreement with the gold standard im-
proves. The scaling approach retains all judgments
and slightly improves correlation and ∆, though K
decreases. As scaled judgments are not whole num-
bers, Turker P (A) and K are not applicable.

The 2-stage approach outperforms all other tech-
niques when compared against the gold standard,
being the only technique to significantly raise cor-
relation. Over 90% of the judgments are used, as
shown in Figure 1. Further, the distribution of fi-
nal adequacy scores (shown in Figure 2) resembles
a normal distribution, allowing this data to be used
for tuning automatic evaluation metrics.

4.1 Resistance to Randomness

To verify that our 2-stage technique handles prob-
lematic data properly, we simulate user data from
5 unreliable Turkers. Turkers “Uniform-a” and
“Uniform-b” draw answers randomly from a uni-
form distribution. “Gaussian” Turkers draw answers
randomly from Gaussian distributions with σ = 1
and µ according to name. Each “Turker” contributes
one judgment for each translation. As shown in Ta-

ble 2, only Gaussian-2.5 receives substantial weight
while the others receive low or zero weight. This fol-
lows from the fact that the actual data follows a sim-
ilar distribution, and thus the random Turkers have
negligible impact on the final distribution of scores.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented an Arabic MT evaluation task
conducted using Amazon MTurk and discussed
several possibilities for normalizing the collected
data. Our 2-stage normalization technique has been
shown to provide the highest agreement between
Turkers and experts while retaining enough judg-
ments to avoid problems of data sparsity and appro-
priately down-weighting random data. As we cur-
rently have a single set of expert judgments, our fu-
ture work involves collecting additional judgments
from multiple experts against which to further test
our techniques. We then plan to use normalized
