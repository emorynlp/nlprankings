Abstract
We propose a Bayesian method of esti-
mating a conditional distribution of data
given metadata (e.g., the usage of a di-
alectal variant given a location) based
on queries from a big data/social me-
dia source, such as Twitter. This distri-
bution is structurally equivalent to those
built from traditional experimental meth-
ods, despite lacking negative examples.
Tests using Twitter to investigate the ge-
ographic distribution of dialectal forms
show that this method can provide distri-
butions that are tightly correlated with ex-
isting gold-standard studies at a fraction of
the time, cost, and effort.

1 Introduction

Social media provides a linguist with a new data
source of unprecedented scale, opening novel av-
enues for research in empirically-driven areas,
such as corpus and sociolinguistics. Extracting the
right information from social media, though, is not
as straightforward as in traditional data sources, as
the size and format of big data makes it too un-
wieldy to observe as a whole. Researchers often
must interact with big data through queries, which
produce only positive results, those matching the
search term. At best, this can be augmented with
a set of “absences” covering results that do not
match the search term, but explicit negative data
(e.g., confirmation that a datapoint could never
match the search term) does not exist. In addition
to the lack of explicit negative data, query-derived
data has a conditional distribution that reverses the
dependent and independent variables compared to
traditional data sources, such as sociolinguistic in-
terviews.

This paper proposes a Bayesian method for
overcoming these two difficulties, allowing query-
derived data to be applied to traditional problems

without requiring explicit negative data or the abil-
ity to view the entire dataset at once. The test case
in this paper is dialect geography, where the pos-
itive data is the presence of a dialectal word or
phrase in a tweet, and the metadata is the location
of the person tweeting it. However, the method
is general and applies to any queryable big data
source that includes metadata about the user or set-
ting that generated the data.

The key to this method lies in using an indepen-
dent query to estimate the overall distribution of
the metadata. This estimated distribution corrects
for non-uniformity in the data source, enabling the
reversal of the conditionality on the query-derived
distribution to convert it to the distribution of in-
terest.

Section 2 explains the mathematical core of the
Bayesian analysis. Section 3 implements this anal-
ysis for Twitter and introduces an open-source
program for determining the geographic distri-
bution of tweets. Section 4 tests the method on
problems in linguistic geography and shows that
its results are well-correlated with those of tradi-
tional sociolinguistic research. Section 5 addresses
potential concerns about noise or biases in the
queries.

2 Reversing the conditionality of query
data

2.1 Corpora and positive-only data

In traditional linguistic studies, the experimenter
has control over the participants’ metadata, but
not over their data. For instance, a sociolinguist
may select speakers with known ages or locations,
but will not know their usages in advance. Cor-
pus queries reverse the direction of investigation;
the experimenter selects a linguistic form to search
for, but then lacks control over the metadata of the
participants who use the query. The direction of
conditionality must be reversed to get compara-

ble information from query-derived and traditional
data.

Queries also complicate the problem by pro-
viding only positive examples. This lack of ex-
plicit negative data is common in language ac-
quisition, as children encounter mostly grammat-
ical statements during learning, and receive few
explicitly ungrammatical examples, yet still de-
velop a consistent grammaticality classification
system as they mature. Similar positive-only prob-
lems abound in cognitive science and artificial in-
telligence, and a variety of proposals have been
offered to overcome it in different tasks. These
include biases like the Size Principle (Tenen-
baum and Griffiths, 2001), heuristics like gen-
erating pseudo-negatives from unobserved data
(Okanohara and Tsujii, 2007; Poon et al., 2009),
or innate prespecifications like Universal Gram-
mar in the Principles and Parameters framework.

For query-derived data, Bayesian reasoning can
address both problems by inverting the condi-
tionality of the distribution and implying negative
data. The key insight is that a lack of positive ex-
amples where positive examples are otherwise ex-
pected is implicit negative evidence. This method
allows a researcher to produce an estimated distri-
bution that approximates the true conditional dis-
tribution up to a normalizing factor. This condi-
tional distribution is that of data (e.g., a dialectal
form) conditioned on metadata (e.g., a location).

This distribution can be written as p(D|M),
where D and M are random variables represent-
ing the data and metadata. A query for a data value
d returns metadata values m distributed according
to p(M |D = d). All of the returned results will
have the searched-for data value, but the metadata
can take any value.

For most research, p(M |D = d) is not the dis-
tribution of interest, as it is conflated with the over-
all distribution of the metadata. For instance, if
the query results indicate that 60% of users of the
linguistic form d live in urban areas, this seems
to suggest that the linguistic form is more likely
in urban areas. But if 80% of people live in ur-
ban areas, the linguistic form is actually underrep-
resented in these areas, and positively associated
with rural areas. An example of the effect of such
misanalysis is shown in Sect. 4.2.

2.2 Reversing the conditionality

Bayesian reasoning allows a researcher to move
from the sampled p(M |D) distribution to the de-
sired p(D|M). We invoke Bayes’ Rule:

p(D|M) = p(M |D)p(D)
p(M)

In some situations, these underlying distribu-
tions will be easily obtainable. For small corpora,
p(D) and p(M) can be calculated by enumeration.
For data with explicit negative examples available,
p(D) can be estimated as the ratio of positive ex-
amples to the sum of positive and negative exam-
ples.1 But for queries in general, neither of these
approximations is possible. Instead, we estimate
p(M) through the querying mechanism itself.

This is done by choosing a “baseline” query
term q whose distribution is approximately inde-
pendent of the metadata – that is, a query q such
that p(q|m) is approximately constant for all meta-
data values m ∈M . If p(q|m) is constant, then by
Bayes’ Rule:

p(m|q) = p(q|m)p(m)
p(q)

≈ p(m), ∀m ∈M

Thus we can treat results from a baseline query
as though they are draws directly from p(M), and
estimate the denominator from this distribution.
The remaining unknown distribution p(d) is con-
stant for a given data value d, so combining the
above equations yields the unnormalized probabil-
ity p̃(d|M):

p(d|M) ∝ p̃(d|M) = p(M |d)
p(M |q) . (1)

This switch to the unnormalized distribution can
improve interpretability as well. If p̃(d|m) = 1,
then p(m|d) = p(m|q), which means that the
metadata m is observed for the linguistic form d
just as often as it is for the baseline query. When
p̃(d|m) > 1, the linguistic form is more common
for metadata m than average, and when p̃(d|m) <
1, the form is less common for that metadata.2

1This can be extended to multi-class outcomes; if D has
more than two outcomes, each possible outcome is an implicit
negative example for the other possible outcomes.

2If a normalized distribution is needed, p(d) may be es-
timable, depending on the data source. In the Twitter data pre-
sented here, tweets are sequentially numbered, so p(d) could
be estimated using these index numbers. This paper only uses
unnormalized distributions.

2.3 Coverage and confidence
Due to the potentially non-uniform distribution
of metadata, the amount of error in the estimate
in Eq. 1 can vary with m. Intuitively, the confi-
dence in the conditional probability estimates de-
pends on the amount of data observed for each
metadata value. Because queries estimate p(M |d)
by repeated draws from that distribution, the er-
ror in the estimate decreases as the number of
draws increases. The overall error in the estimate
of p̃(d|m) decreases as the number of datapoints
observed at m increases. This suggests estimating
confidence as the square root of the count of ob-
servations of the metadata m, as the standard error
of the mean decreases in proportion to the square
root of the number of observations. More complex
Bayesian inference can be used improve error es-
timates in the future.

3 Sample Implementation: SeeTweet

This section implements the method described in
the previous section on a case study of the ge-
ographic distributions of linguistic forms, calcu-
lated from recent tweets. It is implemented as
a suite of novel open-source Python/R programs
called SeeTweet, which queries Twitter, obtains
tweet locations, performs the mathematical anal-
ysis, and maps the results. The suite is avail-
able at http://github.com/gabedoyle/
seetweet.

3.1 SeeTweet goals
Traditionally, sociolinguistic studies are highly
time-intensive, and broad coverage is difficult to
obtain at reasonable costs. Two data sources that
we compare SeeTweet to are the Atlas of North
American English (Labov et al., 2008, ANAE)
and the Harvard Dialect Survey (Vaux and Golder,
2003, HDS), both of which obtained high-quality
data, but over the course of years. Such studies
remain the gold-standard for most purposes, but
SeeTweet presents a rapid, cheap, and surprisingly
effective alternative for broad coverage on some
problems in dialect geography.

3.2 Querying Twitter
SeeTweet queries Twitter through its API, us-
ing Mike Verdone’s Python Twitter Tools3. The
API returns the 1000 most recent query-matching
tweets or all query-matching tweets within the

3http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

last week, whichever is smaller, and can be ge-
ographically limited to tweets within a certain
radius of a center point. In theory, the contigu-
ous United States are covered by a 2500km ra-
dius (Twitter’s maximum) around the geographic
center, approximately 39.8◦N, 98.6◦W, near the
Kansas-Nebraska border. In practice, though, such
a query only returns tweets from a non-circular re-
gion within the Great Plains.

Through trial-and-error, four search centers
were found that span the contiguous U.S. with
minimal overlap and nearly complete coverage,4

located near Austin, Kansas City, San Diego, and
San Francisco. All results presented here are based
on these four search centers. Tweets located out-
side the U.S. or with unmappable locations are dis-
carded.

The need for multiple queries and the API’s
tweet limit complicate the analysis. The four
searches must be balanced against each other to
avoid overrepresenting certain areas, especially in
constructing the baseline p(M). If any searches
reach the 1000-tweet limit, only the search with
the most recent 1000th tweet has all of its tweets
used. All tweets before that tweet are removed,
balancing the searches by having them all span the
same timeframe. Due to the seven-day limit for re-
cent tweets, many searches do not return 1000 hits;
if none of the searches max out, all returned tweets
are accepted.

3.3 Establishing the baseline

For the baseline query (used to estimate p(M)),
SeeTweet needs a query with approximately uni-
form usage across the country. Function or stop
words are reasonable candidates for this task. We
use the word I here, which was chosen as it is
common in all American English dialects but not
other major languages of the U.S., and it has few
obvious alternative forms. Other stop words were
tested, but the specific baseline query had little im-
pact on the learned distribution; correlations be-
tween maps with I, of, the or a baselines were all
above .97 on both baseline distributions and esti-
mated conditional distributions.

Each tweet from the target query requires its
own baseline estimate, as the true distribution of
metadata varies over time. For instance, there will
be relatively more tweets on the East Coast in

Mountain West returns little data outside the major cities.

the early morning (when much of the West Coast
is still asleep). Thus, SeeTweet builds the base-
line distribution by querying the baseline term I,
and using the first 50 tweets preceding each tar-
get tweet. This query is performed for each search
center for each tweet, with the centers balanced as
discussed in the previous section.5

3.4 Determining coordinates and mapping

A tweet’s geographic information can be specified
in many ways. These include coordinates specified
by a GPS system (“geotags”), user-specified coor-
dinates, or user specification of a home location
whose coordinates can be geocoded. Some tweets
may include more that one of these, and SeeTweet
uses this hierarchy: geotags are accepted first, fol-
lowed by user-specified coordinates, followed by
user-specified cities. This hierarchy moves from
sources with the least noise to the most.

Obtaining coordinates from user-specified loca-
tions is done in two steps. First, if the user’s loca-
tion follows a “city, state” format, it is searched
for in the US Board on Geographic Names’s
Geographic Names Information System6, which
matches city names to coordinates. Locations that
do not fit the “city, state” format are checked
against a manually compiled list of coordinates
for 100 major American cities. This second step
catches many cities that are sufficiently well-
known that a nickname is used for the city (e.g.,
Philly) and/or the state is omitted.

Tweets whose coordinates cannot be deter-
mined by these methods are discarded; this is ap-
proximately half of the returned tweets in the ex-
periments discussed here.

This process yields a database of tweet coor-
dinates for each query. To build the probability
distributions, SeeTweet uses a two-dimensional
Gaussian kernel density estimator. Gaussian distri-
butions account for local geographic dependency
and uncertainty in the exact location of a tweeter
as well as smoothing the distributions. The stan-
dard deviation (“bandwidth”) of the kernels is a
free parameter, and can be scaled to supply ap-
propriate coverage/granularity of the map. We use

5An alternative baseline, perhaps even more intuitive,
would be to use some number of sequential tweets preced-
ing the target tweet. However, the Twitter API query mecha-
nism subsamples from the overall set of tweets, so sequential
tweets may not follow the same distribution as the queries
and would provide an inappropriate baseline.

3 degrees (approximately 200 miles) of band-
width for all maps in this paper, but found con-
sistently high correlation (at least .79 by Hosmer-
Lemeshow) to the ANAE data in Sect. 4.1 with
bandwidths between 0.5 and 10 degrees.

The KDE estimates probabilities on a grid over-
laid on the map; we make each grid box a square
one-tenth of a degree on each side and calculate
p̃(d|m) for each box m. SeeTweet maps plot the
value of p̃(d|M) on a color gradient with approxi-
mately constant luminosity. Orange indicates high
probability of the search term, and blue low prob-
ability. Constant luminosity is used so that confi-
dence in the estimate can be represented by opac-
ity; regions with higher confidence in the esti-
mated probability appear more opaque.7 Unfortu-
nately, this means that the maps will not be infor-
mative if printed in black and white.

4 Experiments in dialect geography

Our first goal is to test the SeeTweet results against
an existing gold standard in dialect geography;
for this, we compare SeeTweet distributions of
the needs done construction to those found by
long-term sociolinguistic studies and show that the
quick-and-dirty unsupervised SeeTweet distribu-
tions are accurate reflections of the slow-and-clean
results. Our second goal is show the importance of
using the correct conditional distribution, by com-
paring it to the unadjusted distribution. With these
points established, we then use SeeTweet to create
maps of previously uninvestigated problems.

4.1 Method verification on need + past
participle

The Atlas of North American English (Labov et
al., 2008) is the most complete linguistic atlas of
American English dialect geography. It focuses on
phonological variation, but also includes a small
set of lexical/syntactic alternations. One is the
needs + past participle construction, as in The car
needs (to be) washed. This construction has a lim-
ited geographic distribution, and ANAE provides
the first nationwide survey of its usage.

We compare SeeTweet’s conditional probabili-
ties for this construction to the ANAE responses to
see how the relatively uncontrolled Twitter source
compares to the tightly controlled telephone sur-
vey data that ANAE reports. We create a SeeTweet

number of tweets in a grid box m, p(m|d) ∗ C(d).

map and visually compare this to the ANAE map,
along with a Hosmer-Lemeshow-style analysis.
The SeeTweet map is not calibrated to the ANAE
map; they are each built independently.

The ANAE map (Fig. 1a) shows the responses
of 577 survey participants who were asked about
needs done. Three possible responses were consid-
ered: they used the construction themselves, they
did not use it but thought it was used in their area,
or they neither used it nor believed it to be used in
their area.

The SeeTweet map (Fig. 1b) is built from five
searches for the phrase “needs done”, yielding 480
positive tweets and 32275 baseline tweets.8 The
component distributions p(M |d) and p(M) are es-
timated by Gaussian kernels with bandwidth 3.
The log of p̃(f |M), calculated as in Eq. 1, de-
termines the color of a region; orange indicates a
higher value, purple a middle (approx. 1) value,
and blue a low value. Confidence in the estimate
is reflected by opacity; higher opacity indicates
higher confidence in the estimate. Confidence val-
ues above 3 (corresponding to 9 tweets per bin) are

fully opaque. This description holds for all other
maps in this paper.

We start with a qualitative comparison of the
maps. Both maps show the construction to be most
prominent in the area between the Plains states and
central Pennsylvania (the North Midland dialect
region), with minimal use in New England and
Northern California and limited use elsewhere.
SeeTweet lacks data in the Mountain West and
Great Plains, and ANAE lacks data for Minnesota
and surrounding states.9 The most notable devia-
tion between the maps is that SeeTweet finds the
construction more common in the Southeast than
ANAE does.

Quantitative comparison is possible by compar-
ing SeeTweet’s estimates of the unnormalized con-
ditional probability of needs done in a location
with the ANAE informants’ judgments there. Two
such comparisons are shown in Fig. 2.

The first comparison (Fig. 2a) is a violin
plot with the ANAE divided into the three re-
sponse categories. The vertical axis represents
the SeeTweet estimates, and the width of a vi-
olin is proportional to the likelihood of that
ANAE response coming from a region of the
given SeeTweet estimate. The violins’ mass shifts
toward regions with lower SeeTweet estimates
(down in the graph) as the respondents report
decreasing use/familiarity with the construction
(moving left to right).

Users of the construction are most likely to
come from regions with above-average condi-
tional probability of needs done, as seen in the left-
most violin. Non-users, whether familiar with the
construction or not, are more likely to come from
regions with below-average conditional probabil-
ity. Non-users who are unfamiliar with it tend to
live in regions with the lowest conditional prob-
abilities of the three groups. This shows the ex-
pected correspondence trend between the ANAE
responses and the estimated prevalence of the con-
struction in an area; the mean SeeTweet estimates
for the three groups are 0.45, −0.34, and −0.61,
respectively.

The second comparison (Fig. 2b) is a Hosmer-
Lemeshow plot. The respondents are first divided
into deciles based on the SeeTweet estimate at
their location. Two mean values are calculated for
each decile: the mean SeeTweet log-probability

9Murray et al. (1996)’s data suggest that these untested
areas would not use the construction; the SeeTweet data sug-
gests this as well.

estimate (increasing with each decile) and the log-
proportion of respondents in that decile who use
the construction.10 If SeeTweet estimates of the
conditional distribution are an adequate reflection
of the ANAE survey data, we should see a tight
correlation between the SeeTweet and ANAE val-
ues in each decile. The correlation between the
two is R2 = 0.90. This is an improvement over the
inappropriate conditional distribution p(M |d) that
is obtained by smoothing the tweet map without
dividing by the overall tweet distribution p(M).
Its Hosmer-Lemeshow correlation is R2 = 0.79

These experiments verify two important points:
the SeeTweet method can generate data that is
tightly correlated with gold-standard data from
controlled surveys, and conditionality inversion
establishes a more appropriate distribution to cor-
rect for different baseline frequencies in tweeting.
This second point will be examined further with
double modals in the next section.

4.2 Double modals and the importance of the
baseline

The double modal construction provides a second
test case. While ungrammatical in Standard Amer-
ican English, forms like I might could use your
help are grammatical and common in Southern
American dialects. This construction is interesting
both for its theoretical syntax implications on the
nature of modals as well as the relationship be-
tween its sociolinguistic distribution and its prag-
matics (Hasty, 2011).

The ANAE does not have data on double
modals’ distribution, but another large-scale soci-
olinguistic experiment does: the Harvard Dialect
Survey (Vaux and Golder, 2003). This online sur-
vey obtained 30788 responses to 122 dialect ques-
tions, including the use of double modals. Katz
(2013) used a nearest-neighbor model to create a
p(d|M) distribution over the contiguous U.S. for
double modal usage, mapped in Fig. 3a.11 Lighter
colors indicate higher rates of double modal ac-
ceptance.

SeeTweet generates a similar map (Fig. 3b),
based on three searches with 928 positive and
66272 baseline tweets. As with the ANAE test, the

10We remove all respondents who do not use the construc-
tion but report it in their area. Such respondents are fairly
rare (slightly over 10% of the population), and removing this
response converts the data to a binary classification problem
appropriate to Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis.

SeeTweet map is built independently of the HDS
data and is not calibrated to it.

The notable difference between the maps is
that SeeTweet does not localize double modals as
sharply to the Southeast, with pockets in cities
throughout the country. This may reflect the dif-
ference in the meaning of locations on Twitter and
in the HDS; Twitter locations will be a user’s cur-
rent home, whereas the HDS explicitly asks for a
respondent’s location during their formative years.
SeeTweet may partly capture the spread of dialec-
tal features due to migration.

Double modals also provide an illustration of
the importance of the Bayesian inversion in Eqn.
1, as shown in Fig. 3c. This map, based on
the inappropriate distribution p(M |d), which does
not account for the overall distribution p(M),
disagrees with general knowledge of the double
modal’s geography and the HDS map. Although
both maps find double modals to be prominent
around Atlanta, the inappropriate distribution find

New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles to be
the next most prominent double modal regions,
with only moderate probability in the rest of the
Southeast. This is not incorrect, per se, as these
are the sources of many double modal tweets; but
these peaks are incidental, as major cities produce
more tweets than the rest of the country. This is
confirmed by their absence in the HDS map as
well as the appropriate SeeTweet map.

4.3 Extending SeeTweet to new problems

Given SeeTweet’s success in mapping needs done
and double modals, it can also be used to test new
questions. An understudied issue in past work on
the need + past participle construction is its rela-
tionship with alternative forms need to be + past
participle and need + present participle. Murray
et al. (1996) suggest that their need + past par-
ticiple users reject both alternatives, although it
is worth noting that their informants are more ac-
cepting of the to be alternative, calling it merely
“too formal”, as opposed to an “odd” or “ungram-
matical” opinion about the present participle form.
Their analysis of the opinions on alternative forms
does not go beyond this anecdotal evidence.

SeeTweet provides the opportunity to examine
this issue, and finds that the to be form is per-
sistent across the country (Fig. 4c), both in areas
with and without the need + past participle form,
whereas the present participle alternant (Fig. 4b)
is strongest in areas where need + past participle is
not used. Although further analysis is necessary to
see if the same people use both the past participle
forms, the current data suggests that the bare past
participle and bare present participle forms are in
complementary distribution, while the to be form
is acceptable in most locations.

We also compare the alternative constructions
to the ANAE data. Using Hosmer-Lemeshow
analysis, we find negative correlations: R2 =
−.65 for needs doing and R2 = −.25 for needs
to be done. In addition, mean SeeTweet estimates
of needs doing usage were lower for regions where
respondents use needs done than for regions where
they do not: −.93 versus −.49.12 Thus, SeeTweet
provides evidence that needs done and needs do-
ing are in a geographically distinct distribution,
while needs done and needs to be done are at most
weakly distinct.

12SeeTweet estimates of needs to be done usage were com-
parable in both regions, −.018 against .019.

5 The appropriateness of Twitter as a
data source

A possible concern with this analysis is that Twit-
ter could be a biased and noisy dataset, inappropri-
ate for sociolinguistic investigation. Twitter skews
toward the young and slightly toward urbanites
(Duggan and Brenner, 2013). However, as young
urbanites tend to drive language change (Labov
et al., 2008), any such bias would make the re-
sults more useful for examining sociolinguistic
changes and emergent forms. The informality of
the medium also provides unedited writing data
that is more reflective of non-standard usage than
most corpora, and its large amounts of data in short
timescales offers new abilities to track emerging
linguistic change.

As for noise in the tweet data and locations, the
strong correlations between the gold-standard and
SeeTweet results show that, at least for these fea-
tures, the noise is mitigated by the size of dataset.
We examined the impact of noise on the needs
done dataset by manually inspecting the data for
false positives and re-mapping the clean data. Al-
though the false positive rate was 12%, the con-

ditional distribution learned with and without the
false positives removed remained tightly corre-
lated, at R2 = .94. The SeeTweet method ap-
pears to be robust to false positives, although nois-
ier queries may require manual inspection.

A final point to note is that while the datasets
used in constructing these maps are relatively
small, they are crucially derived from big data. Be-
cause the needs done and double modal construc-
tions are quite rare, there would be very few ex-
amples in a standard-sized corpus. Only because
there are so many tweets are we able to get the
hundreds of examples we used in this study.

6 Conclusion

We have shown that Bayesian inversion can be
used to build conditional probability distributions
over data given metadata from the results of
queries on social media, connecting query-derived
data to traditional data sources. Tests on Twitter
show that such calculations can provide dialect
geographies that are well correlated with exist-
ing gold-standard sources at a fraction of the time,
cost, and effort.
