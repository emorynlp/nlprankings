Abstract

This paper summarizes our participation
in task #17 of SemEval–2 (All–words
WSD on a specific domain) using a su-
pervised class-based Word Sense Disam-
biguation system. Basically, we use Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) as learning
algorithm and a set of simple features to
build three different models. Each model
considers a different training corpus: Sem-
Cor (SC), examples from monosemous
words extracted automatically from back-
ground data (BG), and both SC and
BG (SCBG). Our system explodes the
monosemous words appearing as mem-
bers of a particular WordNet semantic
class to automatically acquire class-based
annotated examples from the domain text.
We use the class-based examples gathered
from the domain corpus to adapt our tra-
ditional system trained on SemCor. The
evaluation reveal that the best results are
achieved training with SemCor and the
background examples from monosemous
words, obtaining results above the first
sense baseline and the fifth best position
in the competition rank.

1 Introduction

As empirically demonstrated by the last SensEval
and SemEval exercises, assigning the appropriate
meaning to words in context has resisted all at-
tempts to be successfully addressed. In fact, super-
vised word-based WSD systems are very depen-
dent of the corpora used for training and testing
the system (Escudero et al., 2000). One possible
reason could be the use of inappropriate level of
abstraction.

Most supervised systems simply model each
polysemous word as a classification problem

where each class corresponds to a particular synset
of the word. But, WordNet (WN) has been widely
criticized for being a sense repository that often
provides too fine–grained sense distinctions for
higher level applications like Machine Translation
or Question & Answering. In fact, WSD at this
level of granularity has resisted all attempts of in-
ferring robust broad-coverage models. It seems
that many word–sense distinctions are too subtle
to be captured by automatic systems with the cur-
rent small volumes of word–sense annotated ex-
amples.

Thus, some research has been focused on deriv-
ing different word-sense groupings to overcome
the fine–grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and
Schütze, 1993), (Peters et al., 1998), (Mihalcea
and Moldovan, 2001), (Agirre and LopezDeLa-
Calle, 2003), (Navigli, 2006) and (Snow et al.,
2007). That is, they provide methods for grouping
senses of the same word, thus producing coarser
word sense groupings for better disambiguation.

In contrast, some research have been focused on
using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learn-
ing class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al.,
1997), (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003), (Villarejo
et al., 2005), (Curran, 2005), (Kohomban and Lee,
2005) and (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006). That is,
grouping senses of different words into the same
explicit and comprehensive semantic class. Most
of the later approaches used the original Lexico-
graphical Files of WN (more recently called Su-
perSenses) as very coarse–grained sense distinc-
tions.

We suspect that selecting the appropriate level
of abstraction could be on between both levels.
Thus, we use the semantic classes modeled by the
Basic Level Concepts1 (BLC) (Izquierdo et al.,
2007). Our previous research using BLC empiri-
cally demonstrated that this automatically derived

set of meanings groups senses into an adequate
level of abstraction in order to perform class-based
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Izquierdo et
al., 2009). Now, we also show that class-based
WSD allows to successfully incorporate monose-
mous examples from the domain text. In fact,
the robustness of our class-based WSD approach
is shown by our system that just uses the Sem-
Cor examples (SC). It performs without any kind
of domain adaptation as the Most Frequent Sense
(MFS) baseline.

This paper describes our participation in
SemEval-2010 Task 17 (Agirre et al., 2010). In
section 2 semantic classes used and selection al-
gorithm used to obtain them automatically from
WordNet are described. In section 3 the technique
employed to extract monosemous examples from
background data is described. Section 4 explains
the general approach of our system, and the ex-
periments designed, and finally, in section 5, the
results and some analysis are shown.

2 Semantic Classes

The set of semantic classes used in this work are
the Basic Level Concepts2 (BLC) (Izquierdo et
al., 2007). These concepts are small sets of mean-
ings representing the whole nominal and verbal
part of WN. BLC can be obtained by a very simple
method that uses basic structural WordNet proper-
ties. In fact, the algorithm only considers the rel-
ative number of relations of each synset along the
hypernymy chain. The process follows a bottom-
up approach using the chain of hypernymy rela-
tions. For each synset in WN, the process selects
as its BLC the first local maximum according to
the relative number of relations. The local maxi-
mum is the synset in the hypernymy chain having
more relations than its immediate hyponym and
immediate hypernym. For synsets having multi-
ple hypernyms, the path having the local maxi-
mum with higher number of relations is selected.
Usually, this process finishes having a number of
preliminary BLC. Figure 1 shows an example of
selection of a BLC. The figure represents the hy-
pernymy hierarchy of WordNet, with circles rep-
resenting synsets, and links between them repre-
senting hypernym relations. The algorithm selects
the D synset as BLC for J, due to D is the first
maximum in the hypernymy chain, according to
the number of relations (F has 2 hyponyms, D has

2http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/BLC

3, and A has 2, so D is the first maximum).

Obviously, while ascending through this chain,
more synsets are subsumed by each concept. The
process finishes checking if the number of con-
cepts subsumed by the preliminary list of BLC is
higher than a certain threshold. For those BLC
not representing enough concepts according to the
threshold, the process selects the next local max-
imum following the hypernymy hierarchy. Thus,
depending on the type of relations considered to
be counted and the threshold established, different
sets of BLC can be easily obtained for each WN
version.

We have selected the set which considers WN
version 3.0, the total number of relations per
synset, and a minimum threshold of 20 concepts to
filter out not representative BLC (BLC–20). This
set has shown to reach good performance on previ-
ous SensEval and SemEval exercices (Izquierdo et
al., 2009). There are 649 different BLC for nouns
on WordNet 3.0, and 616 for verbs. Table 2 shows
the three most frequent BLC per POS, with the
number of synsets subsumed by each concept, and
its WordNet gloss.

3 Using Monosemous Examples from the
Domain

We did not applied any kind of specific domain
adaptation technique to our class-based supervised
system. In order to adapt our supervised system to
the environmental domain we only increased the
training data with new examples of the domain. To
acquire these examples, we used the environmen-
tal domain background documents provided by the
organizers. Specifically, we used the 122 back-

ground documents3. TreeTagger has been used
to preprocess the documents, performing PoS tag-
ging and lemmatization. Since the background
documents are not semantically annotated, and our
supervised system needs labeled data, we have se-
lected only the monosemous words occurring in
the documents. In this way, we have obtained au-
tomatically a large set of examples annotated with
BLC. Table 3 presents the total number of training
examples extracted from SemCor (SC) and from
the background documents (BG). As expected, by
this method a large number of monosemous ex-
amples can be obtained for nouns and verbs. Also
as expected, verbs are much less productive than
nouns. However, all these background examples
correspond to a reduced set of 7,646 monosemous
words.

4 System Overview

Our system applies a supervised machine learn-
ing approach. We apply a feature extractor to
represent the training examples of the examples
acquired from SemCor and the background doc-
uments. Then, a machine learning engine uses
the annotated examples to train a set of classi-
fiers. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been
proven to be robust and very competitive in many
NLP tasks, and in WSD in particular (Màrquez et
al., 2006). We used the SVM-Light implementa-
tion4 (Joachims, 1998).

We create a classifier for each semantic class.
This approach has several advantages compared to
word–based approach. The training data per clas-
sifier is increased (we can use examples of dif-
ferent target words for a single classifier, when-
ever all examples belong to the same semantic
class), the polysemy is reduced (some different
word senses can be collapsed into the same se-
mantic class), and, finally, semantic classes pro-
vide higher levels of abstraction.

For each polysemous word occurring in the test
corpus, we obtain its potential BLC–20 classes.
Then, we only apply the classifiers corresponding
to the BLC-20 classes of the polysemous word. Fi-
nally, our system simply selects the BLC–20 class
with the greater prediction.

In order to obtain the correct WordNet 3.0
synset required by the task, we apply a simple
heuristic that has shown to be robust and accurate
(Kohomban and Lee, 2005). Our classifiers ob-
tain first the semantic class, and then, the synset of
the first WordNet sense that fits with the semantic
class is assigned to the word.

We selected a simple feature set widely used in
many WSD systems. In particular, we use a win-
dow of five tokens around the target word to ex-
tract word forms, lemmas; bigrams and trigrams
of word forms and lemmas; trigrams of PoS tags,

and also the most frequent BLC–20 semantic class
of the target word in the training corpus.

Our system is fully described in (Izquierdo et
al., 2009). The novelty introduced here is the use
of semantic classes to obtain monosemous exam-
ples from the domain corpus.

Following the same framework (BLC–20 se-
mantic architecture and basic set of features) we
designed three runs, each one using a different
training corpus.

• SC: only training examples extracted from
SemCor

• BG: only monosemous examples extracted
from the background data

• SCBG: training examples extracted from
SemCor and monosemous background data

The first run shows the behavior of a supervised
system trained on a general corpus, and tested in a
specific domain. The second one analyzes the con-
tribution of the monosemous examples extracted
from the background data. Finally, the third run
studies the robustness of the approach when com-
bining the training examples from SemCor and
from the background.

5 Results and Discussion

A total of 29 runs has been submitted for the En-
glish All–words WSD on a Specific Domain. Ta-
ble 5 shows the ranking results of our three runs
with respect to the other participants. The figures
for the first sense (1sense) and random sense (Ran-
dom) baselines are included.

In general, the results obtained are not very
high. The best system only achieves a precision of
0.570, and the first sense baseline reaches a preci-
sion of 0.505. This shows that the task is hard to
solve, and the domain adaptation of WSD systems
is not an easy task.

Interestingly, our worst result is obtained by the
system using only the monosemous background
examples (BG). This system ranks 23th with a Pre-
cision and Recall of 0.380 (0.385 for nouns and
0.366 for verbs). The system using only SemCor
(SC) ranks 6th with Precision and Recall of 0.505
(0.527 for nouns and 0.443 for verbs). This is also
the performance of the first sense baseline. As ex-
pected, the best result of our three runs is obtained
when combining the examples from SemCor and
the background (SCBG). This supervised system

obtains the 5th position with a Precision and Re-
call of 0.513 (0.534 for nouns, 0.454 for verbs)
which is slightly above the baseline.

Table 4: Results of task#17

Possibly, the reason of low performance of the
BG system is the high correlation between the fea-
tures of the target word and its semantic class. In
this case, these features correspond to the monose-
mous word while when testing corresponds to the
target word. However, it also seems that class-
based systems are robust enough to incorporate
large sets of monosemous examples from the do-
main text. In fact, to our knowledge, this is the first
time that a supervised WSD algorithm have been
successfully adapted to an specific domain. Fur-
thermore, our system trained only on SemCor also
achieves a good performance, reaching the first
sense baseline, showing that class-based WSD ap-
proaches seem to be robust to domain variations.
