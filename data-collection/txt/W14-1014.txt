 Abstract 

Linguistic resources available in the pub-
lic domain, such as lemmatisers, part-of-
speech taggers and parsers can be used 
for the development of MT systems: as 
separate processing modules or as anno-
tation tools for the training corpus. For 
SMT this annotation is used for training 
factored models, and for the rule-based 
systems linguistically annotated corpus is 
the basis for creating analysis, generation 
and transfer dictionaries from corpora. 
However, the annotation in many cases is 
insufficient for rule-based MT, especially 
for the generation tasks. In this paper we 
analyze a specific case when the part-of-
speech tagger does not provide infor-
mation about de/het gender of Dutch 
nouns that is needed for our rule-based 
MT systems translating into Dutch. We 
show that this information can be derived 
from large annotated monolingual corpo-
ra using a set of context-checking rules 
on the basis of co-occurrence of nouns 
and determiners in certain morphosyntac-
tic configurations. As not all contexts are 
sufficient for disambiguation, we evalu-
ate the coverage and the accuracy of our 
method for different frequency thresholds

in the news corpora. Further we discuss 
possible generalization of our method, 
and using it to automatically derive other 
types of linguistic information needed for 
rule-based MT: syntactic subcategoriza-
tion frames, feature agreement rules and 
contextually appropriate collocates. 

1 Introduction 
This paper evaluates a methodology for deriving 
gender classification of nouns based on their con-
textual features and light-weight linguistic anno-
tation of a corpus. We approach the problem as 
reconstructing an enriched set of linguistic fea-
tures for RBMT generation lexicon from com-
bining implicit information available in corpora 
with a set of general linguistic principles imple-
mented as a small set of simple hand-crafted con-
textual rules.  

These rules are specified as configurations of 
part-of-speech codes and operate over configura-
tions of part-of-speech codes designed to capture 
certain disambiguating linguistic constructions. 
Theoretically, the rules can be made highly-
accurate if the list of disambiguating construc-
tions is exhaustive, but there is a well-known 
trade-off between Precision, Recall and the de-
velopment effort for hand-crafted sets of rules. 
Additional factors to be taken into account are 
the quality and size of the annotated corpus. In 
our experiment we take a practical approach, us-
ing a minimal set of contextual rules that cover 
most typical constructions.

We evaluate Precision and coverage for this 
set of rules for different frequency thresholds of 
nouns in the corpus. The results indicate the po-
tential of the proposed methodology for a larger 
set of similar tasks, where we intend to enrich 
linguistic resources for rule-based MT tasks us-
ing implicit linguistic information, which can be 
discovered in annotated corpora. 

The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 
discusses linguistic aspects of the gender disam-
biguation task for Dutch nouns; Section 3 de-
scribes the set-up of our experiment on automati-
cally deriving the lexicon for Dutch nouns en-
riched with gender information; Section 4 pre-
sents evaluation results for Precision and cover-
age for different frequency thresholds; Section 4 
gives interpretation of the results; Section 6 dis-
cusses the development context, generalisation of 
our methodology for rule-based MT and some 
ideas for future work. 
 

2 Linguistic aspects of gender disam-
biguation task for Dutch nouns 

Predicting gender of Dutch nouns from their 
context is a simple and clearly defined contextual 
disambiguation task, and we can evaluate three 
aspects of the performance of our method: (a) 
what coverage and accuracy can be achieved on 
this task compared to the gold standard; (b) how 
do the coverage and accuracy change in different 
frequency thresholds; (c) what is the proportion 
of contexts which can be used for disambiguation 
in different frequency thresholds (since some 
contexts will not disambiguate the features of 
interest). 

Nouns in Dutch belong to one of the two gen-
der classes which determine the choice of the 
definite articles (used with singular nouns) and 
other determiners: neuter nouns take determiners 
het, dat, dit, ons, and nouns with the common 
gender, which historically is the merged mascu-
line and feminine, take de, die, deze, onze. Nouns 
can only be disambiguated when used as singular 
and take a definite determiner, so not all contexts 
in corpus which contain nouns can be useful for 
disambiguation.  

The information about het/de classification for 
nouns is a non-interpretable (in terms of the gen-
erative grammar) system-internal morphological 
feature: it characterises only combinatorial prop-
erties of nouns, but does not directly influence 
their syntactic functions in a structure of a sen-
tence or their semantic interpretation (unlike the 

part-of-speech/Noun category, morphological 
case and number). Therefore, this feature is much 
more useful for text generation than for analysis, 
and belongs to the family of other similar sys-
tem-internal features, like inflection classes, sub-
categorisation frames, lexical functions (colloca-
tional restrictions), etc. Interestingly, this feature 
normally operates in the local context of several 
words within a limited number of possible part-
of-speech sequences. 

For machine translation task this information 
needs to be supplied by the target language gen-
eration rules, or by the target language model, 
since it is normally not present in the source text, 
and cannot be derived from application of trans-
fer rules or the translation model. 

There are several wide-coverage part-of-
speech taggers and lemmatisers for Dutch in the 
public domain (open source and/or freely availa-
ble), such as Dutch parameter files for the Tree-
Tagger (Schmid, 1994), TiMBL / Frog tagger / 
lemmatiser / dependency parser (Van den Bosch 
et al., 2007), Alpino system (Bouma et al., 2001). 
Some of them provide only plain high-level an-
notation of part-of-speech codes, without gender 
information for nouns. However, some do gener-
ate enriched part-of-speech codes for nouns spec-
ifying their gender. Because of this we can 
benchmark our methodology using this enriched 
information as gold-standard and calculate Preci-
sion in addition to coverage.  

3 Set-up of the experiment 
In our experiment TiMBL / Frog was used to 
automatically annotate a 60-million-word section 
of the balanced Dutch SoNaR corpus (Oostdijk et 
al., 2008). 

TiMBL/Frog provides gold-standard diction-
ary-based information about these classes for 
identified lemmas. For the prediction task we 
ignored the gold-standard gender class infor-
mation, and used only the generic part-of-speech 
information and the number category for nouns. 
In the evaluation stage, we compared these au-
tomatically predicted gender classes with the 
gold-standard classes. 

Prediction of the de/het classes was performed 
by a set of regular expressions, which cover most 
typical contexts, where these determiners are 
distinguished. If both types of determiners were 
found in different contexts for the same noun, 
then the class that has the majority of contexts 
was assigned. Regular expressions covered sim-
ple contexts, e.g.: Det (Adj)? Noun:

or cases where het is not a determiner, but is mis-
tagged as such: we assumed that such contexts 
are less frequent and error rate will be limited, so 
we can save the development effort for our hand-
crafted rule set relying on the signal being 
stronger than noise introduced by such complex 
cases.  

The results reported in this paper were gener-
ated using the following two multilevel regular 
expressions (expressions which operate on the 
levels of lemmas and parts-of-speech: 

 
 
de/det__art   /(adj|conjcoord)* 
(.*)/nounsg 
 
het/det__art   /(adj|conjcoord)* 
(.*)/nounsg 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
These regular expressions describe 
configurations that allow several optional 
adjectives or coordinative conjunctions between 
the definite determiner and a singular noun. The 
noun is captured if the configuration matches the 
piece of text and classified according to the type 
of the determiner. 
 

4 Evaluation results 
The results are presented in Table 1 and Charts 1 
and 2, which visualise some of the data from 
Table 1. 

Rows in Table 1 represent different frequency 
cut-off points, e.g: None = no frequency cut-off, 
Frq>1 = noun types with frequency greater than 
one, etc. Columns represent: 

 
- Gold standard: the number of noun types 

identified in the gold-standard above the 
specified frequency 

- Predicted: the number of noun types for 
which prediction of the gender on the ba-
sis of the context in the corpus was made 
(for the rest prediction was not possible 
since no disambiguating contexts were 
found for those noun types) 

- Wrong, %/100: the number and the pro-
portion of wrongly predicted noun types 
(of the total number of Predicted types)

- Correct, %/100: the number and the pro-
portion of correctly predicted noun types 
(of the total number of Predicted types) 

- Missed, %/100: the number and the pro-
portion of noun types where prediction of 
gender was not possible (of the total 
number of nouns in the Gold standard). 

- Contexts, %/100: the proportion of con-
texts for noun tokens, which were useful 
for disambiguation 
 

For instance, the first row shows the figures 
when no frequency cut-off is applied, e.g.: there 
were 157066 types labeled as Nouns in our sec-
tion of SoNaR corpus, of which 74505 Nouns 
were found in a specific context with a definite 
determiner that allowed to disambiguate gender. 
Out of these, 2417 types (3.2%) were disambigu-
ated wrongly for different reasons, 72088 types 
(96.8%) were disambiguated correctly. However, 
there still remain 84978 noun types (or 54.1% of 
the total number of 157066 in the gold standard), 
which were not disambiguated. In total, in the 
corpus 75.2% of contexts were useful for de/het 
disambiguation (contained a definite determiner 
in the immediate left context, or in a one-word-
apart position, being separated by an adjective). 

The second row in Table 1 presents the subset 
of 70006 noun types out of the results presented 
in the first row for 157066 noun types, i.e., the 
results only for nouns with frequency more than 
one; the third row – for noun types with frequen-
cies more than two, etc. The intuition is that pre-
diction for more frequent nouns should be more 
accurate since more token contexts become 
available for disambiguation of a specific noun 
type.

Chart 1 visualizes correct, missing and wrong 
proportion of noun types in the total count of 
these types for different frequency cut-off points. 
On the vertical axis there is a number of noun 
types, on the horizontal axis – not greater than 
frequencies. 

It can be seen from the chart that the propor-
tion of non-disambiguated noun types declines 
with increasing frequency threshold.

biguation (evidence), not predicted (missing) and

Chart 2 examines the relation between frequency 
cut-off points and Evidence (top yellow/light 
line) – the proportions of contexts available for 
disambiguation; Missing (middle red/medium 
line) – the proportion of nouns where de/het dis-
ambiguation was not possible and Wrong (bot-
tom blue/dark line) – the error rate. 

5 Interpretation of the results 
The following conclusions can be derived from 
the evaluation data: 

 
1. The Precision even for simple contextual 

disambiguation rules is surprisingly 
high: 96.8% for nouns where the 
prediction was possible. This indicates 
that simple disambiguation patterns are 
sufficiently frequent to outweigh more 
complex patterns which were not 
covered by the rule and may have lead to 
errors. 

2. For the whole data set (without 
frequency cut-off) the Recall is much 
lower: automatic prediction procedure 
missed 54% of noun tokens that were 
found in the corpus and a contained

gold-standard gender class, since no 
disambiguation context was found for 
these nouns in corpus. However, since 
more frequent nouns have more chances 
of occurring in a disambiguation context, 
mostly low frequent nouns are missed: if 
we exclude nouns which occurred only 
once, the procedure misses 37% of 
nouns; in frequency threshold Frq> 2 it 
misses even less – 28%, etc. 

3. Error rate (proportion of wrongly 
disambiguated nouns) is relatively stable 
(3.2% on the whole data set), and does 
not depend too much on the frequency of 
nouns: it declines very slowly when the 
frequency increases (much slower that 
the coverage of the certain threshold). 

4. The proportion of contexts which are 
useful for disambiguation declines 
slowly with the increase in frequency 
threshold, but stabilises around 40% for 
highly frequent nouns. Interestingly, 
when the proportion of such contexts 
goes down, the error rate stays the same. 

In general, the results indicate that for practical 
purposes of rule-based MT development – a suf-
ficiently large list of gender-disambiguated 
Dutch nouns (around 75000) can be successfully 
collected from a medium-size corpus (60MW) 
with very high Precision (96.8%). The method 
will provide gender disambiguation information 
for around 46% of all nouns found in the corpus; 
and for higher frequency threshold the percent-
age of gender-disambiguated nouns goes up rap-
idly, flattening at around 90% for Frq>10. This 
performance reaches the quality standards for 
creating wide-coverage generation dictionaries 
for rule-based MT. 

6 Development context and generaliza-
tion of the methodology 

The task of predicting gender classes for nouns 
gives indication how other types of similar mor-
phosyntactic resources and representations can 
be developed and enhanced. 

Our methodology is part of a larger develop-
ment infrastructure for creating a corpus-based 
development environment for industry-standard 
rule-based MT systems enhanced with statistical 
tools and data. The infrastructure uses large 
monolingual corpora annotated by openly availa-
ble part-of-speech taggers and lemmatisers, and 
semi-automatically derives a set of morphologi-
cal and syntactic patterns for the lexical items 

found there. These patterns represent advanced 
linguistic features for the lexicon, such as classi-
fication by inflectional morphological paradigms, 
derivational classes (e.g., gender for nouns), lex-
ical valencies (subcategorisation and case 
frames), attachment preferences and lexical col-
locates. 

For individual lexical items these patterns do 
not need to be fully specified from the training 
corpus: missing forms are reconstructed on the 
basis of evidence from other lexemes that fit the 
same pattern, so the system recognises and gen-
erates correct output also for unseen forms.  

In the context of our hybrid MT development 
infrastructure this approach particularly targets 
creation of linguistically-rich resources that gen-
erate correct target language forms and phrases. 
The generation aspect is usually not covered by 
the annotation tools available in the public do-
main, so parsers, part-of-speech taggers and 
lemmatisers usually work only in the direction of 
analysis, and do not deal with generation).  

In a more general context the described infra-
structure develops lexical and morphosyntactic 
resources in a systematic way, so they can be 
used in a wider range of applications and tasks. It 
also attempts to bridge the gap between rule-
based and statistical techniques in MT by creat-
ing rich and highly accurate linguistic representa-
tions using corpus-based statistical techniques 
and integrating them within processing models 
for hybrid MT architecture. 

The central principle of the proposed infra-
structure is that advanced morphosyntactic fea-
tures and representations are derived from corpo-
ra annotated with light-weight linguistic features.  

The interpretation of this principle is that the 
tools like part-of-speech taggers and lemmatisers 
implement a unidirectional functional perspec-
tive on the morphosyntactic system, which only 
partially covers the network of linguistic rela-
tions involved in the analysis and generation as-
pects of the language. Rule-based MT applica-
tion instead need to rely on the alternative rela-
tional perspective of morphosyntactic representa-
tions. Our infrastructure aims at reconstructing 
this perspective by combining large corpora and 
unidirectional annotation tools. It derives a range 
of generation-oriented morphosyntactic features 
and representations using local context and 
standard analysis-oriented annotation features in 
corpora. 

The main motivation is that from the point of 
view of rule-based MT there is a certain imbal-
ance between resources for analysis and annota-

79



tion of texts on the one hand, and resources for 
language generation on the other hand. Text an-
notation resources, such as part-of-speech tag-
gers, lemmatisers, parsers, chunkers – have a 
longer history of research and development, e.g., 
(Greene and Rubin, 1971), have created common 
standards and are more widely available in the 
public domain, e.g., (Schmid, 1994; Brants, 
2000). In their existing form they can be applied 
to new languages and are more widely used in 
practical applications. On the other hand, genera-
tion-oriented tools are much less accessible, of-
ten propitiatory, and lack common standards and 
shared frameworks for integration of new lan-
guages. The predominant unidirectional text-
annotation focus might be explained by a historic 
reason that text annotation was seen as an inter-
esting computational problem with a clearly de-
fined evaluation procedure, which was much 
harder to develop for the generation tasks. 

The idea behind the infrastructure is that if at 
least some unidirectional annotation tools are 
available for a certain language, the relational 
morphosyntactic resources can be automatically 
developed from large annotated corpora. This 
will include automatic acquisition of inflectional 
paradigms for lexical items, attachment prefer-
ence detection, automatic acquisition of lexical 
functions. Our infrastructure aims at developing 
standards and building openly available re-
sources for a number of languages, including 
under-resourced languages, such as Portuguese, 
Russian and Ukrainian, in order to carry out the 
following morphosyntacitc tasks: 

 
1. word form generation: for a given lem-

ma, part-of-speech and inflectional fea-
ture values to generate the correct word 
form, e.g.: drive~V + Person(3rd); Num-
ber(singular) → drives  

2. generation of paradigms: for a given 
lemma and part-of-speech to generate a 
set of all word forms and their inflec-
tional feature values, e.g., drive~V → 
drive~VV; drives~VVZ; driving~VVG; 
drove~VVD; driven~VVN 

3. feature agreement generation: for a given 
sequence of lemmas with their part-of-
speech codes to generate a correct se-
quence of inflected word forms, where 
inflectional features, e.g., in a language 
with adjectives and nouns marked for 
gender to generate a correct gender 
agreement between the two: in Spanish, 
e.g., nuestro~A.Gender(_).Number(_) 

En:'our' + profesora~ 
N.Gender(fem).Number(plur) 
En:'professors(female)' → nuestras 
profesoras 

4. lexical feature generation: to select cor-
rect lemmas for lexically underspecified 
structures, e.g., in a language with the 
gender feature marked on determiners 
and nouns to select the correct deter-
miner to go with a given noun: Dutch: 
[Determiner.Def(definite)] + 
beroep~N.Number(singular) → het 
beroep 

5. subcategorisation frame generation: to 
generate the correct prepositional phrase 
and/or morphological case features for a 
given verb and a noun (or a noun 
phrase), e.g.: dispence~V + N → dis-
pense with + N; dispose~V + N → dis-
pose of +N 

6. collocate / lexical function generation (in 
terms of Mel’čuk, 1998): to select the 
correct lemma or ranked set of lemmas 
for a given word and semantic features 
of its context, e.g., '[not-real/true] + 
[Noun]': mock trial; false assumption; 
counterfeit goods; fake name 

7. word order generation: to generate cor-
rect linear sequence of words for a given 
dependency structure, e.g.:  

 
I ← find → issues → certain  

 difficult 
è 
 I find certain issues difficult 
 

The first two functions are performed on internal 
features of a word, while the other five require 
contextual input in addition. The described func-
tionality has applications for rule-based MT and 
Natural Language Generation, which could both 
benefit from shared standards and the infrastruc-
ture of relation-oriented linguistic resources.
