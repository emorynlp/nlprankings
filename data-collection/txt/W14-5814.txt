Abstract

A new collection of semantically related word pairs in German is presented, which was compiled
via human judgement experiments and comprises (i) a representative selection of target lexi-
cal units balanced for semantic category, polysemy, and corpus frequency, (ii) a set of human-
generated semantically related word pairs based on the target units, and (iii) a subset of the
generated word pairs rated for their relation strength, including positive and negative relation
evidence. We address the three paradigmatic relations antonymy, hypernymy and synonymy, and
systematically work across the three word classes of adjectives, nouns, and verbs.
A series of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrates that (i) antonyms are more canon-
ical than hypernyms and synonyms, (ii) relations are more or less natural with regard to the spe-
cific word classes, (iii) antonymy is clearly distinguishable from hypernymy and synonymy, but
hypernymy and synonymy are often confused. We anticipate that our new collection of seman-
tic relation pairs will not only be of considerable use in computational areas in which semantic
relations play a role, but also in studies in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics.

1 Introduction

This paper describes the collection of a database of paradigmatically related word pairs in German which
was compiled via human judgement experiments hosted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. While paradig-
matic relations (such as synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, and hyponymy) have been extensively re-
searched in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics, they are still notoriously difficult to identify
and distinguish computationally, because their distributions in text tend to be very similar. For example,
in The boy/girl/person loves/hates the cat, the nominal co-hyponyms boy, girl and their hypernym per-
son as well as the verbal antonyms love and hate occur in identical contexts, respectively. A dataset of
paradigmatic relation pairs would thus represent a valuable test-bed for research on semantic relatedness.

For the compilation of the relation dataset we aimed for a sufficiently large amount of human-labelled
data, which may both serve as seeds for a computational approach, and provide a gold-standard for evalu-
ating the resulting computational models. This paper describes our efforts to create such a paradigmatic
relation dataset in a two-step process, making use of two types of human-generated data: (1) human sug-
gestions of semantically related word pairs, and (2) human ratings of semantic relations between word
pairs. Furthermore, we are the first to explicitly work across word classes (covering adjective, noun
and verb targets), and to incorporate semantic classes, corpus frequency and polysemy as balancing
criteria into target selection. The resulting dataset1 consists of three parts:

1. A representative selection of target lexical units drawn from GermaNet, a broad-coverage lexical-
semantic net for German, using a principled sampling technique and taking into account the three
major word classes adjectives, nouns, and verbs, which are balanced according to semantic category,
polysemy, and type frequency.

2. A set of human-generated semantically related word pairs, based on the target lexical units.
3. A subset of semantically related word pairs, rated for the strength of the relation between them.

We anticipate that our new collection of semantic relation pairs will not only be of considerable use in
computational areas in which semantic relations play a role (such as Distributional Semantics, Natural
Language Understanding/Generation, and Opinion Mining), but also in studies in theoretical linguistics
and psycholinguistics. In addition, our dataset may be of major interest for research groups working on
automatic measures of semantic relatedness, as it allows a principled evaluation of such tools. Finally,
since the target lexical units are drawn from the GermaNet database, our results will be directly relevant
for assessing, developing, and maintaining this resource.

2 Related work

Over the years a number of datasets have been made available for studying and evaluating semantic
relatedness. For English, Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) obtained similarity judgements from 51
subjects on 65 noun pairs, a seminal study which was later replicated by Miller and Charles (1991), and
Resnik (1995). Finkelstein et al. (2002) created a set of 353 English noun-noun pairs rated by 16 subjects
according to their semantic relatedness on a scale from 0 to 10. For German, Gurevych (2005) replicated
Rubenstein and Goodenough’s experiments by translating the original 65 word pairs into German. In
later work, she used the same experimental setup to increase the number of word pairs to 350 (Gurevych,
2006).

The dataset most similar to ours is BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), a freely available dataset that
includes 200 distinct English concrete nouns as target concepts, equally divided between living and non-
living entities, and grouped into 17 broad classes such as bird, fruit. For each target concept, BLESS con-
tains several relata, connected to it through a semantic relation (hypernymy, co-hyponymy, meronymy,
attribute, event), or through a null-relation. BLESS thus includes two paradigmatic relations (hypernymy,
co-hyponymy) but does not focus on paradigmatic relations. Furthermore, it is restricted to concrete
nouns, rather than working across word classes.

3 Paradigmatic relations

The focus of this work is on semantic relatedness, and in particular on paradigmatic semantic relations.
This section discusses the theoretical background of the notion of paradigmatic semantic relations. The
term paradigmatic goes back to de Saussure (1916), who introduced a distinction between linguistic
elements based on their position relative to each other. This distinction derives from the linear nature of
linguistic elements, which is reflected in the fact that speech sounds follow each other in time. Saussure
refers to successive linguistic elements that combine with each other as ‘syntagma’, and thus the relation
between these elements is called ‘syntagmatic’. On the other hand, elements that can be found in the
same position in a syntagma, and which could be substituted for each other, are in a ‘paradigmatic’
relationship. While syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations can hold between a variety of linguistic units
(such as morphemes, phonemes, clauses, or sentences), the focus of this research is on the relations
between words.

Many studies in computational linguistics work on the assumption that paradigmatic semantic relations
hold between words. As will become apparent in the course of this work, it is necessary to move beyond
these definitions for an appropriate investigation of paradigmatic semantic relations. According to Cruse
(1986), sense is defined as “the meaning aspect of a lexical unit”, and he states that “semantic relations”
hold between lexical units, not between lexemes.

The goal of this work is to create a database of semantic relations for German adjectives, nouns and
verbs, focussing on the three types of paradigmatic relations referred to as sense-relations by Lyons
(1968) and Lyons (1977): synonymy, antonymy, and hypernymy.

4 Experimental setup

Our aim was to collect semantically related word pairs for the paradigmatic relations antonymy, syn-
onymy, and hypernymy for the three word classes nouns, verbs, and adjectives. For this purpose we
implemented two experiments involving human participants. Starting with a set of target words, in the
first experiment participants were asked to propose suitable antonyms, synonyms and hypernyms for

112



each of the targets. For example, for the target verb befehlen (‘to command’), participants proposed
antonyms such as gehorchen (‘to obey’), synonyms such as anordnen (‘to order’), and hypernyms such
as sagen (‘to say’).

In the second experiment, participants were asked to rate the strength of a given semantic relation with
respect to a word pair on a 6-point scale. For example, workers would be presented with a pair “wild –
free” and asked to rate the strength of antonymy between the two words. All word pairs were assessed
with respect to all three relation types.

Both experiments will be described in further detail in Sections 5 and 6. The current section aims to
provide an overview of GermaNet, a lexical-semantic word net for German, from which the set of target
words was drawn (4.1). We then describe the selection of target words from GermaNet, which used a
stratified sampling approach (4.2). Finally, we introduce the platform used to implement the experiments,
Amazon Mechanical Turk (4.3).

4.1 Target source: GermaNet
GermaNet is a lexical-semantic word net that aims to relate German nouns, verbs, and adjectives seman-
tically. GermaNet has been modelled along the lines of the Princeton WordNet for English (Miller et al.,
1990; Fellbaum, 1998) and shares its general design principles (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997; Kunze and
Wagner, 1999; Lemnitzer and Kunze, 2007). For example, lexical units denoting the same concept are
grouped into synonym sets (‘synsets’). These are in turn interlinked via conceptual-semantic relations
(such as hypernymy) and lexical relations (such as antonymy). For each of the major word classes, the
databases further take a number of semantic categories into consideration, expressed via top-level nodes
in the semantic network (such as ‘Artefakt/artifact’, ‘Geschehen/event’, ‘Gefühl/feeling’). However, in
contrast to WordNet, GermaNet also includes so-called ‘artificial concepts’ to fill lexical gaps and thus
enhance network connectivity, and to avoid unsuitable co-hyponymy (e.g. by providing missing hyper-
nyms or hyponyms). GermaNet also differs from WordNet in the way in which it handles part of speech.
For example, while WordNet employs a clustering approach to structuring adjectives, GermaNet uses a
hierarchical structure similar to the one employed for the noun and verb hierarchies. Finally, the latest
releases of WordNet and GermaNet also differ in size: While WordNet 3.0 contains at total of 117,659
synsets and 155,287 lexical units, the respective numbers for GermaNet 6.0 are considerably lower, with
69,594 synsets and 93,407 lexical units.

Since GermaNet is the largest database of its kind for German, and as it encodes all types of relations
that are of interest for us (synonymy, antonymy, and hypernymy), it represents a suitable starting point
for our purposes.

4.2 Target selection
The purpose of collecting the set of targets was to acquire a broad range of lexical items which could
be used as input for generating semantically related word pairs (cf. Section 5). Relying on GermaNet
version 6.0 and the respective JAVA API, we used a stratified sampling technique to randomly select 99
nouns, 99 adjectives and 99 verbs from the GermaNet files. The random selection was balanced for

1. the size of the semantic classes,2 accounting for the 16 semantic adjective classes and the 23 se-
mantic classes for both nouns and verbs, as represented by the file organisation;

2. three polysemy classes according to the number of GermaNet senses:
I) monosemous, II) two senses and III) more than two senses;

3. three frequency classes according to type frequency in the German web corpus SdeWaC (Faaß and
Eckart, 2013), which contains approx. 880 million words:
I) low (200–2,999), II) mid (3,000–9,999) and III) high (≥10,000).

The total number of 99 targets per word class resulted from distinguishing 3 sense classes and 3 frequency
classes, 3×3 = 9 categories, and selecting 11 instances from each category, in proportion to the semantic
class sizes.

2For example, if an adjective GermaNet class contained 996 word types, and the total number of adjectives over all semantic
classes was 8,582, and with 99 stimuli collected in total, we randomly selected 99∗996/8, 582 = 11 adjectives from this class.

4.3 Experimental platform: Mechanical Turk

The experiments described below were implemented in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)3, a web-based
crowdsourcing platform which allows simple tasks (so-called HITs) to be performed by a large number
of people in return for a small payment. In our first experiment, human associations were collected
for different semantic relation types, where AMT workers were asked to propose suitable synonyms,
antonyms, and hypernyms for each of the targets. The second experiment was based on a subset of the
generated synonym/antonym/hypernym pairs and asked the workers to rate each pair for the strength
of antonymy, synonymy, and hypernymy between them, on a scale between 1 (minimum strength) and
6 (maximum strength). To control for non-native speakers of German and spammers, each batch of
HITs included two examples of ‘non-words’ (invented words following German morphotactics such as
Blapselheit, gekortiert) in a random position. If participants did not recognise the invented words, we
excluded all their ratings from consideration. While we encouraged workers to complete all HITs in a
given batch, we also accepted a smaller number of submitted HITs, as long as the workers had a good
overall feedback score.

5 Generation experiment

5.1 Method

The goal of the generation experiment was to collect human associations for the semantic relation types
antonymy, hypernymy, and synonymy. For each of our 3×99 adjective, noun, and verb targets, we asked
10 participants to propose a suitable synonym, antonym, and hypernym. Targets were bundled randomly
in 9 batches per word class, each including 9 targets plus two invented words. The experiment consisted
of separate runs for each relation type to avoid confusion between them, with participants first generating
synonyms, then antonyms, and finally hypernyms for the targets, resulting in 3 word classes× 99 targets
× 3 relations × 10 participants = 8, 910 target–response pairs.
5.2 Results and discussion

(a) Total number of responses:
Table 1 illustrates how the number of generated word pairs distributes across word classes and relations.
The total number per class and relation is 990 tokens (99 targets × 10 participants). From the maximum
number of generated pairs, a total of 131 types (211 tokens) were discarded because the participants
provided no response. These cases had been accepted via AMT nevertheless because the participants
were approved workers and we assumed that the empty responses showed the difficulty of specific word–
relation constellations, see below. For example, six out of ten participants failed to provide a synonym
for the adjective bundesrepublikanisch ’federal republic’.

(b) Number of ambiguous responses:
An interesting case is provided by pairs that were generated with regard to different relations but for the
same target word. Table 2 lists the number of types of such ambiguous pairs, and the intersection of
the tokens. For example, if five participants generated a pair with regard to a target and relation x, and
two participants generated the same pair with regard to relation y, the intersection is 2. The intersection

is more indicative of ambiguity here, because in most cases of ambiguity the intersection is only 1,
which might as well be the result of an erroneously generated pair (e.g., because the participant did
not pay attention to the task), rather than genuine ambiguity. Examples of ambiguous responses with an
intersection > 1 are Gegenargument–Argument ‘counter argument – argument’, which was provided five
times as an antonymy pair and twice as a hypernymy pair; freudlos–traurig ‘joyless – sad’, which was
provided four times as a synonymy pair and five times as a hypernymy pair; and beseitigen–entfernen
‘eliminate – remove’, which was provided five times as a synonymy pair and five times as a hypernymy
pair.

Table 2: Number of ambiguous relation pairs across word classes.

The ambiguities in Table 2 indicate that humans are quite clear about what distinguishes antonyms
from synonyms, and what distinguishes antonyms from hypernyms. On the other hand, the line dividing
hypernymy and synonymy is less clear, and the large amount of confusion between the two relations
lends support to theories claiming that hypernymy should be considered a type of synonymy, and that
real synonymy does not exist in natural languages for economical reasons. Furthermore, the confusion
is most obvious for adjectives and verbs, for which the relation is considered less natural than for nouns,
cf. Miller and Fellbaum (1991).

(c) Number of (different) responses across word classes and relations:
An analysis of the number of different antonyms, hypernyms and synonyms generated for a given target
shows no noticeable difference at first glance: on average, 6.04 different antonyms were generated for
the targets, while the number is minimally higher for synonyms with 6.08 different responses on average;
hypernyms received considerably more (6.78) different responses on average. However, the distribution
of the numbers of different antonym, hypernym, and synonym responses across the targets shows that the
antonymy generation task results in more targets with a small number of different responses compared
to the synonymy and the hypernym task (Figure 1): there are 10 targets for which all ten participants
generated the same antonym (x = number of different responses = 1), such as dunkel–hell ‘dark – light’
and verbieten–erlauben ‘to forbid – to allow’, while there are 17 targets where they generated exactly two
(x=2), and 29 targets where they suggested three different antonyms (x=3). In contrast, for hypernymy
and synonymy, there are 0/3 targets where all participants agreed on the same response, and there are
only 5/10 targets where they generated exactly two, and 8/21 targets where they generated only three
different hypernyms/synonyms.

These results are in line with previous findings for English and Swedish by Paradis and Willners (2006)
and Paradis et al. (2009), who argue against the strict contrast between ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ antonyms
which has been assumed in the literature (see, for example, Gross et al. (1989)) in favour of a scale of
‘canonicity’ where some word pairs are perceived as more antonymic than others. In particular, they
propose that the weaker the degree of canonicity, the more different responses the target items will yield
in an elicitation experiment. Similar to the current findings for German, they found that for English
and Swedish there is a small core of highly opposable couplings which have been conventionalised as
antonym pairs in text and discourse, while all other couplings form a scale from more to less strongly
related. The ten targets for which all participants generated the same antonym response are thus likely
to represent highly “canonical” pairings. The fact that the hypernymy and synonymy generation exper-
iments results in fewer targets with only one or two different responses suggests that hypernymy and
synonymy have a lower level of canonicity than antonymy.

115



Figure 1: Number of targets plotted against the number of different responses.

Figure 2 demonstrates that the overall distributions of the frequency of responses are, however, very
similar for antonyms, hypernyms and synonyms: between 72% and 77% of the responses were only
given once, with the curves following a clear downward trend. Note that a strength of 10 in Figure 2
refers to the case of one different response (x=1) in Figure 1.

Figure 2: Response magnitude.

Finally, Figure 3 compares the number of blank responses (types and tokens) regarding antonyms,
hypernyms and synonyms. Across word classes, 74/115 targets (types/tokens) received blank antonym
responses, while only 25/34 targets received blank hypernym responses and only 32/62 targets received
blank synonym responses. These numbers indicate that participants find it harder to come up with
antonyms than hypernyms or synonyms. Breaking the proportions down by word class, Figure 3 demon-
strates that in each case the number of missing antonyms (left panel: types; right panel: tokens) is larger
than those of missing hypernyms/synonyms. Figure 3 also shows that the difficulty to provide rela-
tion pairs varies across word classes. While antonyms are the most difficult relation in general, there
are more blank responses regarding adjectives and nouns, in comparison to verbs. Hypernymy seems
similarly difficult across classes, and synonymy is more difficult for nouns than for adjectives or verbs.

(d) Comparison with GermaNet:
The results of the generation experiment can be used to extend and develop GermaNet, the resource the
targets were drawn from: a large proportion of responses are not covered in GermaNet. Table 3 below
shows for the three parts of speech and the three relation types how many responses were covered by both
the generation experiment (EXP) and GermaNet (GN) (column ‘Both’), how many of them only appear
in the generation experiment (column ‘EXP’), and how many are only listed in GermaNet (‘GN’). Blank
and multi-word responses in the experimental results were excluded from consideration. The comparison
shows that the variety of semantic relation types in our experimental dataset is considerably larger than in
GermaNet, while the overlap is marginal. Especially for antonyms, the coverage in GermaNet seems to
be quite low, across word classes. For hypernymy and synonymy, the semantic relation types complement
each other to a large extent, with each resource containing relations that are not part of the other resource.
In sum, the tables confirm that extending GermaNet with our relation types should enrich the manual
resource.

6 Rating experiment

6.1 Method

In the second experiment, Mechanical Turk workers were asked to rate the strength of a given semantic
relation with respect to a word pair on a 6-point scale. The main purpose of this experiment was to
identify and distinguish between “strong” and “weak” examples of a specific relation. The number
of times a specific response was given in the generation experiment does not necessarily indicate the
strength of the relation. This is especially true for responses that were suggested by only one or two
participants, where it is difficult to tell if the response is an error, or if it relates to a idiosyncratic sense
of the target word that the other participants did not think of in the first instance. Crucially, in the rating
experiment all word pairs were assessed with respect to all three relation types, thus asking not only for
positive but also negative evidence of semantic relation instances.

The set of word pairs used as input is a carefully selected subset of responses acquired in the generation
experiment.4 For each of the 99 targets and each of the semantic relations antonymy, synonymy, and
hypernymy two responses were included (if available): the response with the highest frequency (random
choice if several available), and a response with a lower frequency (2, if available, otherwise 1; random
choice if several available). Multi-word responses and blanks were excluded from consideration. A
manual post-processing step aimed to address the issue of duplicate pairs in the randomly generated
dataset, where the same responses had been generated for two of the relations.

In theory, each target should have 6 associated pairs (2xANT, 2xHYP, 2xSYN). In practice, there are
sometimes fewer than 6 pairs per target in the dataset, because (i) for some targets, only one response
is available for a given relation (e.g., if all 10 participants provided the same response), or (ii) no valid
response of the required frequency type is available. The resulting dataset includes 1,684 target-response
pairs altogether, 546 of which are adjective pairs, 574 noun pairs, and 564 verb pairs. To avoid confusion,
the ratings were collected in separate experimental settings, i.e., for each word class and each relation
type, all generated pairs were first judged for their strength of one relation, and then for their strength of
another relation.

4For time and money reasons, we could not collect the 8, 910× 3× 10 = 267, 300 ratings for all responses.

117



6.2 Results and discussion
In the following, we present the results of the rating experiment in terms of mean rating scores for each
word pair. The mean rating scores were calculated across all ten ratings per pair. The purpose of the
analysis was to verify that the responses generated in the generation experiment are in fact perceived as
examples of the given relation type by other raters. We thus looked at all responses for a given relation
type in the data set and calculated the average value of all mean ratings for this relation type. For example,
Figure 4 (left panel) shows that the responses generated as antonyms are clearly perceived as antonyms
in the case of adjectives, with an average rating score of 4.95. Verb antonyms are also identified as such
with a rating of 4.38. The situation for nouns, however, is less clear: an average rating of 3.70 is only
minimally higher than the middle point of the rating scale (3.50). These findings support the common
assumption that antonymy is a relation that applies well to adjectives and verbs, but less so to nouns.
Responses generated as synonyms (plot omitted for space reasons), on the other hand, are identified as
such for all three words classes, with average rating values of 4.78 for adjectives, 4.48 for nouns, and
4.66 for verbs.

Figure 4: Average ratings of antonym/hypernym responses as ANT or SYN, across word classes.

Finally, Figure 4 (right panel) shows the average ratings as synonyms/antonyms for responses gener-
ated as hypernyms. The findings corroborate our analysis of synonym/hypernym confusion in Section 5:
the distribution looks fairly similar to the one for synonyms, with low antonymy ratings, but an average
synonymy rating of 4.43 for adjectives, 3.08 for nouns, and 3.89 for verbs. The results suggest that
hypernymy is particularly difficult to distinguish from synonymy in the case of adjectives.

7 Conclusion

This article presented a new collection of semantically related word pairs in German which was compiled
via human judgement experiments. The database consists of three parts:

1. A representative selection of target lexical units drawn from GermaNet, using a principled sampling
technique and taking into account the three major word classes adjectives, nouns, and verbs, which
are balanced according to semantic category, polysemy, and type frequency.

2. A set of 8,910 human-generated semantically related word pairs, based on the target lexical units.
3. A subset of 1,684 semantically related word pairs, rated for the strengths of relations.

To our knowledge, our dataset is the first that (i) focuses on multiple paradigmatic relations, (ii) system-
atically works across word classes, (iii) explicitly balances the targets according to semantic category,
polysemy and type frequency, and (iv) explicitly provides positive and negative rating evidence. We de-
scribed the generation and the rating experiments, and presented a series of quantitative and qualitative
analyses. The analyses showed that (i) antonyms are more canonical than hypernyms and synonyms,
(ii) relations are more or less natural with regard to the specific word classes, (iii) antonymy is clearly
distinguishable from hypernymy and synonymy, and (iv) hypernymy and synonymy are often confused.
