Abstract

This article shows how the automatic dis-
ambiguation of discourse connectives can
improve Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) from English to French. Connec-
tives are firstly disambiguated in terms of
the discourse relation they signal between
segments. Several classifiers trained using
syntactic and semantic features reach state-
of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of
0.6 to 0.8 over thirteen ambiguous English
connectives. Labeled connectives are then
used into SMT systems either by mod-
ifying their phrase table, or by training
them on labeled corpora. The best modi-
fied SMT systems improve the translation
of connectives without degrading BLEU
scores. A threshold-based SMT system us-
ing only high-confidence labels improves
BLEU scores by 0.2–0.4 points.

1 Introduction

Current approaches to Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) have difficulties in modeling long-
range dependencies between words, including
those that are due to discourse-level phenomena.
Among these, discourse connectives are words
that signal rhetorical relations between clauses or
sentences. Their translation often depends on the
exact relation signaled in context, a feature that
current SMT systems were not designed to cap-
ture, hence their frequent mistranslations of con-
nectives (see Section 2 below).

In this paper, we present a series of experiments
that aim to use, in SMT systems, data with au-
tomatically labeled discourse connectives. Sec-
tion 3 first presents the data sets used in our ex-
periments. We designed classifiers that attempt to

assign sense labels to ambiguous discourse con-
nectives, and their scores compare favorably with
the state-of-the-art for this task, as shown in Sec-
tion 4. In particular, we consider WordNet rela-
tions and temporal expressions as well as candi-
date translations of connectives as additional fea-
tures (Section 4.2).

However, our main goal is not the disambigua-
tion of connectives per se, but the use of the labels
assigned to connectives as additional input to an
SMT system. To the best of our knowledge, our
experiments are the first attempts to combine con-
nective disambiguation and SMT. Three solutions
to this combination are compared in Section 5:
modifying phrase tables, and training on data la-
beled manually, or automatically, with senses of
connectives. We further show that a modified
SMT system is best used when the confidence for
a given label is high (Section 6). The paper con-
cludes with a comparison to related work (Sec-
tion 7) and an outline of future work (Section 8).

2 Discourse Connectives in Translation

Discourse connectives such as although, however,
since or while form a functional category of
lexical items that are frequently used to mark
coherence or discourse relations such as expla-
nation, synchrony or contrast between units of
text or discourse. For example, in the Europarl
corpus from years 199x (Koehn, 2005), the
following nine lexical items, which are often
(though not always) discourse connectives, are
among the 400 most frequent tokens over a
total of 12,846,003 (in parentheses, rank and
number of occurrences): after (244th/6485),
although (375th/4062), however (110th/12,857),
indeed (334th/4486), rather (316th/4688),

129



since (190th/8263), still (168th/9195), while
(390th/3938), yet (331st/4532) – see also (Car-
toni et al., 2011). Discourse connectives can
be difficult to translate, because many of them
can signal different relations between clauses in
different contexts. Moreover, if a wrong connec-
tive is used in translation, then a text becomes
incoherent, as in the two examples below, taken
from Europarl and translated (EN/FR) with
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) trained on the entire
corpus:

1. EN: This tax, though [contrast], does not come
without its problems.

FR-SMT: *Cette taxe, même si [concession],
ne se présente pas sans ses problèmes.

2. EN: Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President,
with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the
regulations will have to be reviewed since
[causal] I think that the aid system will have
to continue beyond 2002 . . .

FR-SMT: *Enfin, et en conclusion, Monsieur
le président, à l’expiration du traité CECA,
la réglementation devra être revu depuis que
[temporal] je pense que le système d’aides
devront continuer au-delà de 2002 . . .

In the first example, the connective generated
by SMT (même si, literally “even if”) signals a
concession and not a contrast, for which the con-
nective mais should have been used (as in the ref-
erence). In the second example, the connective
depuis que (literally “from the time”) generated
by SMT expresses a temporal relation and not a
causal one, which should have been conveyed e.g.
by the French car.

Such examples suggest that the disambiguation
of connectives prior to translation could help SMT
systems to generate a correct connective in the tar-
get language. Of course, depending on the lan-
guage pair, some ambiguities can be carried over
from the source to the target language, so they
need not be solved. Still, improving the over-
all translation of discourse connectives should in-
crease the overall coherence of MT output, with a
potential large impact on perceived quality.

3 Data Used in Our Experiments

For both tasks, the disambiguation of connectives
and SMT, different training and testing data sets

are available. This section shows how we made
use of these resources and how we augmented
them by manual and automated annotation of the
senses of discourse connectives.

3.1 Data for the Disambiguation of
Discourse Connectives

One of the most important resources for discourse
connectives in English is the Penn Discourse
Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008). The PDTB pro-
vides a discourse-layer annotation over the Wall
Street Journal Corpus (WSJ) and the Penn Tree-
bank syntactic annotation. The discourse anno-
tation consists of manually annotated senses for
about 100 types of explicit connectives, for im-
plicit ones, and their clause spans. For the en-
tire WSJ corpus of about 1,000,000 tokens there
are 18,459 instances of annotated explicit connec-
tives. The senses that discourse connectives can
signal are organized in a hierarchy with 4 toplevel
senses, followed by 16 subtypes on the second
level and 23 detailed subsenses on the third level.
Studies making use of the PDTB to build classi-
fiers usually split the WSJ corpus into Sections
02–21 for training and Section 23 for testing (as
we did for our disambiguation experiments, see
Section 4).

From the PDTB, we extracted the 13 most fre-
quent and most ambiguous connectives: after, al-
though, however, indeed, meanwhile, neverthe-
less, nonetheless, rather, since, still, then, while,
and yet. This set shows in particular that connec-
tives signaling contrastive or temporal senses are
the most ambiguous ones, hence they are also po-
tentially difficult to translate, as this ambiguity is
often not preserved across languages (Danlos and
Roze, 2011). We used the senses from the sec-
ond PDTB hierarchy level (as the third level is too
fine-grained for EN/FR translation) and generated
the training and testing sets listed with statistics in
Table 1 (Section 4).

In principle, classifiers trained on PDTB data
can be applied directly to label connectives over
the English side of the Europarl corpus (Koehn,
2005) used for training and testing SMT. How-
ever, to control the difference in register from
newswire texts to formal political speech, and to
allow for future studies of other languages, we
also performed manual annotation (Cartoni et al.,
2011) of five connectives over the Europarl corpus
(although, even though, since, though and while).

130



The manual annotation was performed on sub-
sets of Europarl v5 (years 199x) for the first few
hundred occurrences of each connective. Instead
of a potentially difficult and costly annotation of
senses, as in the PDTB, we performed translation
spotting, asking annotators to highlight the trans-
lation of each of the five connectives in the French
side of the corpus. From the list of all observed
translations one can then cluster the necessary
sense labels, as some target language connectives
clearly signal only one sense or, in cases where
ambiguity is preserved, one can group the equally
ambiguous connectives under one composite la-
bel. For example, while is sometimes translated
to the French discourse connectives tandis que or
alors que which both preserve the ambiguity of
while signaling a temporal or contrastive sense.
With this method we built the data sets listed with
statistics in Table 2 below (Section 4).

3.2 Data for Statistical Machine Translation

The translation data for our SMT experiments has
been often used in other MT research work and is
freely distributed for the shared tasks of the Work-
shop on Machine Translation (WMT)1.

For training our SMT systems, the EN/FR Eu-
roparl corpus v5 was used in three ways to inte-
grate data with labeled discourse connectives into
SMT: no changes (for MT phrase table modifica-
tions), integration of manually annotated data and
integration of automatically labeled data. These
methods are described below in Section 5 – here,
we gather descriptions of the corresponding data.

a: Modification of the phrase table: Europarl
(346,803 sentences), labeling the translation
model after training.

b: Integration of manual annotation: Europarl
(346,803 sentences), minus all 8,901 sen-
tences containing one of the above 5 connec-
tive types, plus 1,147 sentences with manu-
ally sense-labeled connectives.

c: Integration of automated annotation: Europarl
– years 199x (58,673 sentences), all occur-
rences of the 13 PDTB subset connective
types have been labeled by classifiers (in
6,961 sentences).

For Minimum Error Rate tuning (MERT) (Och,
2003) of the SMT systems, we used the 2009

1statmt.org/wmt10/translation-task.html

News Commentary (NC) EN/FR development set
with the following modifications:

d: Phrase table: NC 2009 (2,051 sentences), no
modifications.

e: Manual annotation: NC 2009 (2,051 sen-
tences), minus all 123 sentences containing
one of the above 5 connective types, plus 102
sentences with manually sense-labeled con-
nectives.

f: Automated annotation: NC 2009 (2,051 sen-
tences), all occurrences of the 13 PDTB sub-
set connective types have been labeled by
classifiers (in 340 sentences).

For testing our modified SMT systems, three
test sets were extracted in the following way:

g: 35 sentences from NC 2007, with 7 occur-
rences for each of the 5 connective types
above, manually labeled.

h: 62 sentences from NC 2007 and 2006 with oc-
currences for the 13 PDTB connective types,
automatically labeled with classifiers.

i: 10,311 sentences from the EN/FR UN corpus,
all occurrences of the five Europarl connec-
tive types, automatically labeled with classi-
fiers.

These test sets might appear small compared to
the amount of data normally used for SMT system
testing. In our system evaluation however, apart
from automated scoring, we also had to perform
manual counts of improved translations, which is
why we could not evaluate more than a hundred
sentences (Section 5). When counting manually
for test set (i), it was downsampled to the same
amount of 35 and 62 sentences as for sets (g)
and (h), by extracting the first occurrences of each
connective.

In all experiments, we use the Moses Phrase-
based SMT decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) and a 5-
gram language model built over the entire French
part of the Europarl corpus v5.

specialized classifier, by using the Stanford Max-
imum Entropy classifier package (Manning and
Klein, 2003). Maximum Entropy is known to han-
dle discrete features well and has been applied
successfully to connective disambiguation before
(see Section 7).

An initial set of features can directly be ob-
tained from the PDTB (and must hence be con-
sidered as oracle features): the (capitalized) con-
nective token, its POS tag, first word of clause 1,
last word of clause 1, first word of clause 2 (the
one containing the explicit connective), last word
of clause 2, POS tag of the first word of clause 2,
type of first word of clause 2, parent syntactical
categories of the connective, punctuation pattern
of the sentences. Apart from these standard fea-
tures in discourse connective disambiguation we
used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to compute lexical
similarity scores with the lesk metric (Baner-
jee and Pedersen, 2002) for all the possible com-
binations of nouns, verbs and adjectives in the
two clauses, as well as antonyms found for these
word groups. In addition, we used features that
are likely to help detecting temporal relations and
were obtained from the Tarsqi Toolkit (Verhagen

and Pustejovsky, 2008), which annotates English
sentences automatically with the TimeML anno-
tation language for temporal expressions. For ex-
ample, in the sentence The crimes may appear
small, but the prices can be huge (PDTB Sec-
tion 2, WSJ file 0290), for example, our features
would indicate the antonyms small vs. huge that
signal the contrast, along with a temporal order-
ing of the event appear before the event can.

We report the classifier performances as F1
scores for each connective (weighting precision
and recall equally) in Table 1, testing on Section
23 of the PDTB. This sense classifier will be re-
ferred to as Classifier PT in the rest of the paper,
in particular when used for the SMT experiments.

4.2 Classifier PT+: With Candidate
Translations as Features

In an attempt to improve Classifier PT, we added
a new type of feature, resulting in Classifier PT+.
Namely, we used candidate translations of dis-
course connectives from a baseline SMT system
(not adapted to connectives). To find these values,
a Moses baseline decoder was used to translate the
PDTB data, which was then word-aligned (En-

glish source with target French) by using GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003). In this alignment, we
searched for the translation equivalents of the 13
PDTB connectives by using a hand-crafted dic-
tionary of possible French translations. When the
translation candidate is not ambiguous – e.g. bien
que as a translation for while clearly signals a con-
cession – its specific sense label was added as the
value of an additional feature. In some cases,
however, the values of the features are not de-
termined (and are set to NONE): either when the
SMT system or GIZA++ failed in translating or
aligning a connective, or when the target connec-
tive was just as ambiguous as the source one (e.g.
while translated as tandis que, which can be la-
beled both temporal or contrast). Overall, this
procedure led to an accuracy gain of Classifier
PT+ with respect to Classifier PT of about 0.1 to
0.6 F1 score for some of the connectives, as can
be seen in the last column of Table 1.

4.3 Classifier EU: Trained on Europarl Data

As explained in Section 3.1, we performed man-
ual annotation of connective senses in Europarl
as well, to provide labeled instances directly in
the data used for SMT training and to account for
the register change. For the Europarl data sets,
we built a new MaxEnt classifier (called Classi-
fier EU) using the same feature set as Classifier
PT. However, all features were this time extracted
automatically (no oracle). In particular, we used
Charniak and Johnson’s (2005) parser to then ex-
tract the syntactic features. In Table 2, we re-
port the results of Classifier EU, again in terms
of F1 scores. For all three classifiers, PT, PT+
and EU, the F1 scores are in a range of 0.6 and
0.8, thus comparing favorably to the state-of-the-

art for discourse connective disambiguation with
detailed senses (Section 7). Classifier EU also
compares favorably to PT and PT+, as seen for in-
stance for since (0.80 vs. 0.78) or although (0.67
vs. 0.60–0.66).

5 Use of Labeled Connectives for SMT

In this section, we report on experiments that
study the effect of discourse connective labeling
on SMT. The experiments differ with respect to
the method used for taking advantage of the la-
bels, but also with respect to the data sets and the
sense classifiers that are used.

5.1 Evaluation Metrics for MT

The variation in MT quality can be estimated in
several ways. On the one hand, we use the BLEU
metric (Papineni et al., 2002) with one reference
translation as is most often done in current SMT
research2. To improve confidence in the BLEU
scores, especially when test sets are small, we
also compute BLEU scores using bootstrapping
of data sets (Zhang and Vogel, 2010); the test
sets are re-sampled a thousand times and the av-
erage BLEU score is computed from individual
sample scores. The BLEU approach is not likely,
however, to be sensitive enough to the small dif-
ferences due to the correction of discourse con-
nectives (less than one word per sentence). We
therefore additionally resort to a manual evalua-
tion metric, referred to as ∆Connectives, which
counts the occurrences of connectives that are bet-
ter translated by our modified systems compared
to the baseline ones.

2The scores are generated by the NIST MTeval script
version 11b, available from www.itl.nist.gov/iad/
mig/tools/.

scores (including bootstrapped ones) and variation in the translation of individual connectives (∆Connectives,

5.2 Phrase Table Modification

A first way of using labeled connectives is to
modify the phrase table of an SMT system previ-
ously trained/tuned on data sets (a)/(d) from Sec-
tion 3.2, in order to force it to translate each spe-
cific sense of a discourse connective (as indicated
by its label) with an acceptable equivalent se-
lected among those learned from the training data.
Of course, this only handles cases when connec-
tives are translated by explicit lexical items (typ-
ically, target connectives) and not by more com-
plex grammatical constructs.

The phrase table modification is done as fol-
lows. Based on a small dictionary of the five con-
nective types of Table 2, their acceptable French
equivalents and the possible senses, the initial
phrase table is searched for phrases containing a
connective and each occurrence is inspected to
find out which sense is reflected in the transla-
tion. If the sense is non-ambiguous, then the ta-
ble entry is modified to include the label, and the
probability score is set to 1 in order to maximize
the chance that the respective translation is found
during decoding. For instance, for every phrase
table entry where while is translated as alors que,
this corresponds to a contrastive use and while is
changed into while CONTRAST. Or, for the en-
tries where while is translated as bien que, the
lexical entry is changed into while CONCESSION.
However, when the source entry is as ambiguous
as the target one, no modification is made. This
means that during decoding (testing) with labeled
sentences, these entries will never be used.

The results of the SMT system are shown in
experiments 1 and 2 in Table 3, respectively test-

ing over data set (g) (7 manually annotated sen-
tences for each of the 5 connectives) and over
set (i), in which the 5 connectives were automat-
ically labeled with Classifier EU. In the first test,
the translations of 29% of the connectives are im-
proved by the modified system, while 20% are
degraded and 51% remain unchanged – thus re-
flecting an overall 10% improvement in the trans-
lations of connectives (∆Connectives). How-
ever, for this test set, the BLEU score is about 3
points below the baseline SMT system that used
the same phrase table without modification of la-
bels and scores (not shown in Table 3). In exper-
iment 2, however, the BLEU score of the modi-
fied system is in the same range as the baseline
one (22.13 vs. 22.76). As for ∆Connectives,
as it was not possible to score manually all the
10,311 connectives, we sampled 35 sentences and
found that 34% of the connectives are improved,
20% are degraded and 46% remain unchanged,
again reflecting an improvement in the translation
of connectives. This shows that piping automatic
labeling and SMT with a modified phrase table
does not degrade the overall BLEU score, while
increasing ∆Connectives.

5.3 Training on Tagged Corpora

We explored a more principled way to integrate
external labels into SMT, by using labeled data
(manually or automatically) for training, so that
the system directly learns a modified phrase table
which allows the translation of labeled data (auto-
matically) when testing.

134



5.3.1 Manual Gold Annotation
We report first two experiments using the man-

ual gold annotation for the five connective types
over Europarl excerpts, used for training. When
used also for testing (experiment 3 in Table 3),
this can be seen as an oracle experiment, measur-
ing the translation improvement when connective
sense labeling is perfect. However, in experiment
4, the SMT system uses the output of an auto-
matic labeler. For training/tuning we used data
sets (b)/(e), Section 3.2.

In experiment 3, for test set (g), 32% of the
connectives were translated better by the modi-
fied system, 57% remained the same, and 11%
were degraded. In experiment 4, over a 35 sen-
tence sample of the bigger test set (i), 26% were
improved, 66% remained the same, and only
8% were degraded. The baseline SMT system
(not shown in Table 3) was built with the same
amounts of unlabeled training and tuning data.
Overall, the BLEU scores of our modified systems
are similar to the baseline ones, though still lower
– 41.58 vs. 42.77 for experiment 3, and 22.43
vs. 22.76 for experiment 4, also confirmed by the
bootstrapped scores.

Another comparison shows that the system
trained on manual annotations (exp. 4) outper-
forms the system using a modified phrase ta-
ble (exp. 2) in terms of BLEU scores (22.43 vs.
22.13) and bootstrapped ones (24.00 vs. 23.63).

5.3.2 Automated Annotation
We evaluated an SMT system trained on data

that was automatically labeled using the classi-
fiers in Section 4. This method provides a large
amount of imperfect training data, and uses no
manual annotations at all, except for the initial
training of the classifiers. For these experiments
(5 and 6 in Table 3), the BLEU scores as well
as the manual counts of improved connectives are
lower than in the preceding experiments because,
overall, less training/tuning data was used – about
15% of Europarl, data sets (c) and (f) in Sec-
tion 3.2. The baseline system was built over the
same amount of data, with no labels.

Testing here was performed over the slightly
bigger test set (h) with 62 sentences (13 connec-
tive types). The occurrences were tagged with
Classifier PT prior to translation (exp. 5). Com-
pared to the baseline system, the translations of
16% of the connectives were improved, while

60% remained the same and 24% were degraded.
In experiment 6, the 10,311 UN occurrences for 5
connective types were first tagged with Classifier
EU. Evaluated on a sample of 62 sentences, 16%
of the connectives were improved, while 66% re-
mained the same and 18% were degraded. De-
spite less training data, in terms of BLEU, the dif-
ference to the respective baseline system (scores
not shown in Table 3) is similar in both experi-
mental settings: 19.78 vs. 20.11 for experiment
6 (automated annotation), compared to 22.43 vs.
22.76 for experiment 4 (manual annotation).

Finally, we carried out two experiments (7
and 8) with Classifier PT+, which uses as addi-
tional features the translation candidates and has a
higher accuracy than PT (Section 4.2). As a result,
the translation of connectives (∆Connectives) is
indeed improved compared (respectively) to ex-
periments 5 and 6, as it appears from lines 7–8
of Table 3. Also, the BLEU scores of the corre-
sponding SMT systems are increased in experi-
ments 7 vs. 5 and in 8 vs. 6, and are now equal
to the baseline ones (for experiment 8: 20.14 vs.
20.11, or, bootstrapped, 21.55 vs. 21.55).

The results of experiments 7/8 vs. 5/6 in-
dicate that improved classifiers for connec-
tives also improve SMT output as measured by
∆Connectives, with BLEU remaining fairly
constant, and therefore are worth investigating
in more depth in the future. When compar-
ing manual (experiments 3/4) vs. automated an-
notation (experiments 5/6/7/8) and their use in
SMT, the differences in the scores (BLEU and
∆Connectives) highlight a trade-off: manually
annotated data used for training leads to better
scores, but noisier and larger training data that is
annotated automatically is an acceptable solution
when manual annotations are not available.

6 Classifier Confidence Scores

As shown with the above experiments, the accu-
racy of the connective classifiers influences SMT
quality. We therefore hypothesize that an SMT
system dealing with labeled connectives would
best be used when the confidence of the classi-
fier is high, while a generic SMT system could be
used for lower confidence values.

We experimented with the confidence scores of
Classifier EU, which assigns a score between 0
and 1 to each of its decisions on the connectives’
labels. (All processing is automatic in these ex-

labeled corpus (TTC) or to a baseline one (BASE), depending on the confidence of the connective classifier. The

periments, and the evaluation is done solely in
terms of BLEU). We defined a threshold-based
procedure to combine SMT systems: if the con-
fidence for a sense label is above a certain thresh-
old, then the sentence is translated by an SMT
system trained on labeled data from experiment
4 (or “tagged corpus”, hence noted TTC), and if it
is below the threshold, it is sent to a baseline sys-
tem (noted BASE). The resulting BLEU scores of
the combined system (COMB) obtained for vari-
ous threshold values are shown in Figure 1 for two
connectives.

Firstly, we considered all the 1,572 sentences
from the UN corpus which contained the connec-
tive although, labeled either as contrast or con-
cession. We show BLEU scores of the COMB
system for several thresholds in the interval of ob-
served confidence scores, along with the scores of
BASE and TTC, in Figure 1(a). The results show
that the scores of COMB increase with the value
of the threshold, and that for at least one value
of the threshold (0.95) COMB outperforms both
TTC and BASE by 0.20 BLEU points.

To confirm this finding with another connec-
tive, we took the first 1,572 sentences containing
the connective since from the UN corpus. The
BLEU scores for COMB are shown for the range
of observed confidence values (0.4–1.0) in Fig-
ure 1(b). For several values of the threshold,
COMB outperforms both BASE and TTC, in par-

ticular for 0.85, with a difference of 0.39 BLEU
points.

The significance of the observed improvement
was tested as follows. For each of the two con-
nectives, we split the test sets of 1,572 sentences
each in five folds, and compared for each fold the
scores of COMB for the best performing thresh-
old (0.95 or 0.85) with the highest of BASE or
TTC (i.e. BASE for although and TTC for since).
We performed a paired t-test to compute the sig-
nificance of the difference, and found p = 0.12 for
although. This value, although slightly above the
conventional boundary of 0.1, shows that the five
pairs of scores reflect a significant difference in
quality. Similarly, when performing a t-test for
since, the difference in scores is found significant
at the 0.01 level (p = 0.005). Of course, COMB
is always significantly better than the lower of
BASE or TTC (p < 0.05). In the future, the sys-
tem combination will be tested for all connectives,
and the respective values of the thresholds will be
set on tuning, not on test data.

7 Related Work

Discourse parsing (Marcu, 2000) has proven to
be a difficult task, even when complex models
(CRFs, SVMs) are used (Wellner, 2009; Her-
nault et al., 2010). The performance of discourse
parsers is in a range of 0.4 to 0.6 F1 score.

With the release of the PDTB, recent research
focused on the disambiguation of discourse con-
nectives as a task in its own right. For the disam-
biguation of explicit connectives, the state-of-the-
art performance for labeling all types of connec-
tives in English is quite high. In the PDTB data,
the disambiguation of discourse vs. non-discourse
uses of connectives reaches 97% accuracy (Lin et
al., 2010). The labeling of the four main senses
from the PDTB sense hierarchy (temporal, contin-
gency, comparison, expansion) reaches 94% ac-
curacy (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009) – however, the
baseline accuracy is already around 85% when us-
ing only the connective token as a feature. Vari-
ous methods for classification and feature analy-
sis have been proposed (Wellner et al., 2006; El-
well and Baldridge, 2008). Other studies have
focused on the analysis of highly ambiguous dis-
course connectives only. Miltsakaki et al. (2005)
report classification results for the connectives
since, while and when. Using a Maximum En-
tropy classifier, they reach 75.5% accuracy for
since, 71.8% for while and 61.6% for when. As
the PDTB was not completed at that time, the data
sets and labels are not exactly identical to the ones
that we used above (see Section 4).

The disambiguation of senses signaled by dis-
course connectives can be seen as a word sense
disambiguation (WSD) problem for functional
words (as opposed to WSD for content words,
which is more frequently studied). The integra-
tion of WSD into SMT has especially been stud-
ied by Carpuat and Wu (2007), who used the
translation candidates output by a baseline SMT
system as word sense labels. This is similar to
our use of translation candidates as an additional
feature for classification in Section 4.2. Then,
the output of several classifiers based on linguis-
tic features was weighed against the translation
candidates output by the baseline SMT system.
With this procedure, their WSD+SMT system im-
proved the BLEU scores by 0.4–0.5 for the En-
glish/Chinese pair.

Chang et al. (2009) use a LogLinear classi-
fier with linguistic features in order to disam-
biguate the Chinese particle ‘DE’ that has five dif-
ferent context-dependent uses (modifier, preposi-
tion, relative clause etc.). When the classifier is
used to annotate the particle prior to SMT, the
output of the translation system improves by up
to 1.49 BLEU score for phrase-based Chinese to

English translation. Ma et al. (2011) use a Maxi-
mum Entropy model to POS tag English colloca-
tional particles (e.g. come down/by, turn against,
inform of ) more specifically than a usual POS tag-
ger does (where only one label is given to all par-
ticles). The authors claim the usefulness of such
a particle tagger for English/Chinese translation,
but do not show its actual integration into an MT
system.

These approaches, as well as ours, show that
integrating discourse information into SMT is
promising and deserves future examination. The
disambiguation of word senses, including func-
tion words, can improve SMT output when the
senses are annotated in a pre-processing step that
uses classifiers based on linguistic features at
the semantic and discourse levels, which are not
available to a state-of-the-art SMT systems.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper has presented methods and results for
the disambiguation of temporal and contrastive
discourse connectives using MaxEnt classifiers
with syntactic and semantic features, in English
texts, in terms of senses intended to help SMT.
These classifiers have been used to perform exper-
iments with connective-annotated data applied to
EN/FR SMT systems. The results have shown an
improvement in the translation of connectives for
fully automatic systems trained on either hand-
labeled or automatically-labeled data. Moreover,
BLEU scores were significantly improved by 0.2–
0.4 when such systems were only used for con-
nectives that had been disambiguated with high
confidence.

In future work we plan to improve the sense
classifiers using additional features, to improve
their integration with SMT, and to unify our data
sets through additional manual annotations over
Europarl. The applicability of the method to other
languages will also be demonstrated experimen-
tally.
