Abstract

In a previous work of ours Chinnakotla
et al. (2010) we introduced a novel
framework for Pseudo-Relevance Feed-
back (PRF) called MultiPRF. Given a
query in one language called Source, we
used English as the Assisting Language to
improve the performance of PRF for the
source language. MulitiPRF showed re-
markable improvement over plain Model
Based Feedback (MBF) uniformly for 4
languages, viz., French, German, Hungar-
ian and Finnish with English as the as-
sisting language. This fact inspired us
to study the effect of any source-assistant
pair on MultiPRF performance from out
of a set of languages with widely differ-
ent characteristics, viz., Dutch, English,
Finnish, French, German and Spanish.
Carrying this further, we looked into the
effect of using two assisting languages to-
gether on PRF.

The present paper is a report of these in-
vestigations, their results and conclusions
drawn therefrom. While performance im-
provement on MultiPRF is observed what-
ever the assisting language and whatever
the source, observations are mixed when
two assisting languages are used simul-
taneously. Interestingly, the performance
improvement is more pronounced when
the source and assisting languages are
closely related, e.g., French and Spanish.

1 Introduction
The central problem of Information Retrieval (IR)
is to satisfy the user’s information need, which is
typically expressed through a short (typically 2-3
words) and often ambiguous query. The problem
of matching the user’s query to the documents is
rendered difficult by natural language phenomena

like morphological variations, polysemy and syn-
onymy. Relevance Feedback (RF) tries to over-
come these problems by eliciting user feedback
on the relevance of documents obtained from the
initial ranking and then uses it to automatically
refine the query. Since user input is hard to ob-
tain, Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) (Buckley
et al., 1994; Xu and Croft, 2000; Mitra et al., 1998)
is used as an alternative, wherein RF is performed
by assuming the top k documents from the initial
retrieval as being relevant to the query. Based on
the above assumption, the terms in the feedback
document set are analyzed to choose the most dis-
tinguishing set of terms that characterize the feed-
back documents and as a result the relevance of
a document. Query refinement is done by adding
the terms obtained through PRF, along with their
weights, to the actual query.

Although PRF has been shown to improve re-
trieval, it suffers from the following drawbacks:
(a) the type of term associations obtained for query
expansion is restricted to co-occurrence based re-
lationships in the feedback documents, and thus
other types of term associations such as lexical and
semantic relations (morphological variants, syn-
onyms) are not explicitly captured, and (b) due to
the inherent assumption in PRF, i.e., relevance of
top k documents, performance is sensitive to that
of the initial retrieval algorithm and as a result is
not robust.

Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
(MultiPRF) (Chinnakotla et al., 2010) is a novel
framework for PRF to overcome both the above
limitations of PRF. It does so by taking the help of
a different language called the assisting language.
In MultiPRF, given a query in source language
L1, the query is automatically translated into
the assisting language L2 and PRF performed
in the assisting language. The resultant terms
are translated back into L1 using a probabilistic
bi-lingual dictionary. The translated feedback

1346



model, is then combined with the original feed-
back model of L1 to obtain the final model which
is used to re-rank the corpus. MulitiPRF showed
remarkable improvement on standard CLEF
collections over plain Model Based Feedback
(MBF) uniformly for 4 languages, viz., French,
German, Hungarian and Finnish with English as
the assisting language. This fact inspired us to
study the effect of any source-assistant pair on
PRF performance from out of a set of languages
with widely different characteristics, viz., Dutch,
English, Finnish, French, German and Spanish.
Carrying this further, we looked into the effect of
using two assisting languages together on PRF.

The present paper is a report of these in-
vestigations, their results and conclusions drawn
therefrom. While performance improvement on
PRF is observed whatever the assisting language
and whatever the source, observations are mixed
when two assisting languages are used simulta-
neously. Interestingly, the performance improve-
ment is more pronounced when the source and as-
sisting languages are closely related, e.g., French
and Spanish.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2,
discusses the related work. Section 3, explains the
Language Modeling (LM) based PRF approach.
Section 4, describes the MultiPRF approach. Sec-
tion 5 discusses the experimental set up. Section 6
presents the results, and studies the effect of vary-
ing the assisting language and incorporates mul-
tiple assisting languages. Finally, Section 7 con-
cludes the paper by summarizing and outlining fu-
ture work.

2 Related Work
PRF has been successfully applied in various IR
frameworks like vector space models, probabilis-
tic IR and language modeling (Buckley et al.,
1994; Jones et al., 2000; Lavrenko and Croft,
2001; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001). Several ap-
proaches have been proposed to improve the per-
formance and robustness of PRF. Some of the rep-
resentative techniques are (i) Refining the feed-
back document set (Mitra et al., 1998; Sakai et
al., 2005), (ii) Refining the terms obtained through
PRF by selecting good expansion terms (Cao et
al., 2008) and (iii) Using selective query expan-
sion (Amati et al., 2004; Cronen-Townsend et al.,
2004) and (iv) Varying the importance of docu-
ments in the feedback set (Tao and Zhai, 2006).
Another direction of work, often reported in the

TREC Robust Track, is to use a large external col-
lection like Wikipedia or the Web as a source of
expansion terms (Xu et al., 2009; Voorhees, 2006).
The intuition behind the above approach is that
if the query does not have many relevant docu-
ments in the collection then any improvements in
the modeling of PRF is bound to perform poorly
due to query drift.

Several approaches have been proposed for
including different types of lexically and se-
mantically related terms during query expansion.
Voorhees (1994) use Wordnet for query expan-
sion and report negative results. Recently, random
walk models (Lafferty and Zhai, 2001; Collins-
Thompson and Callan, 2005) have been used to
learn a rich set of term level associations by com-
bining evidence from various kinds of information
sources like WordNet, Web etc. Metzler and Croft
(2007) propose a feature based approach called la-
tent concept expansion to model term dependen-
cies.

All the above mentioned approaches use the re-
sources available within the language to improve
the performance of PRF. However, we make use of
a second language to improve the performance of
PRF. Our proposed approach is especially attrac-
tive in the case of resource-constrained languages
where the original retrieval is bad due to poor cov-
erage of the collection and/or inherent complexity
of query processing (for example term conflation)
in those languages.

Jourlin et al. (1999) use parallel blind relevance
feedback, i.e. they use blind relevance feedback on
a larger, more reliable parallel corpus, to improve
retrieval performance on imperfect transcriptions
of speech. Another related idea is by Xu et al.
(2002), where a statistical thesaurus is learned us-
ing the probabilistic bilingual dictionaries of Ara-
bic to English and English to Arabic. Meij et
al. (2009) tries to expand a query in a differ-
ent language using language models for domain-
specific retrieval, but in a very different setting.
Since our method uses a corpus in the assisting
language from a similar time period, it can be
likened to the work by Talvensaari et al. (2007)
who used comparable corpora for Cross-Lingual
Information Retrieval (CLIR). Other work pertain-
ing to document alignment in comparable corpora,
such as Braschler and Schäuble (1998), Lavrenko
et al. (2002), also share certain common themes
with our approach. Recent work by Gao et al.

1347



(2008) uses English to improve the performance
over a subset of Chinese queries whose transla-
tions in English are unambiguous. They use inter-
document similarities across languages to improve
the ranking performance. However, cross lan-
guage document similarity measurement is in it-
self known to be an hard problem and the scale of
their experimentation is quite small.

3 PRF in the LM Framework
The Language Modeling (LM) Framework allows
PRF to be modelled in a principled manner. In the
LM approach, documents and queries are modeled
using multinomial distribution over words called
document language model P (w|D) and query lan-
guage model P (w|ΘQ) respectively. For a given
query, the document language models are ranked
based on their proximity to the query language
model, measured using KL-Divergence.

KL(ΘQ||D) =
X
w

P (w|ΘQ) · log
P (w|ΘQ)
P (w|D)

Since the query length is short, it is difficult to es-
timate ΘQ accurately using the query alone. In
PRF, the top k documents obtained through the ini-
tial ranking algorithm are assumed to be relevant
and used as feedback for improving the estima-
tion of ΘQ. The feedback documents contain both
relevant and noisy terms from which the feedback
language model is inferred based on a Generative
Mixture Model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).

Let DF = {d1, d2, . . . , dk} be the top k docu-
ments retrieved using the initial ranking algorithm.
Zhai and Lafferty (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001) model
the feedback document setDF as a mixture of two
distributions: (a) the feedback language model and
(b) the collection model P (w|C). The feedback
language model is inferred using the EM Algo-
rithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which iteratively
accumulates probability mass on the most distin-
guishing terms, i.e. terms which are more fre-
quent in the feedback document set than in the
entire collection. To maintain query focus the fi-
nal converged feedback model, ΘF is interpolated
with the initial query model ΘQ to obtain the final
query model ΘFinal.

ΘF inal = (1− α) ·ΘQ + α ·ΘF

ΘFinal is used to re-rank the corpus using the
KL-Divergence ranking function to obtain the fi-
nal ranked list of documents. Henceforth, we refer

4 Multilingual PRF (MultiPRF)
The schematic of the MultiPRF approach is shown
in Figure 1. Given a query Q in the source lan-
guage L1, we automatically translate the query
into the assisting language L2. We then rank the
documents in the L2 collection using the query
likelihood ranking function (John Lafferty and
Chengxiang Zhai, 2003). Using the top k doc-
uments, we estimate the feedback model using
MBF as described in the previous section. Simi-
larly, we also estimate a feedback model using the
original query and the top k documents retrieved
from the initial ranking in L1. Let the resultant
feedback models be ΘFL2 and Θ

F
L1

respectively.
The feedback model estimated in the assisting lan-
guage ΘFL2 is translated back into language L1
using a probabilistic bi-lingual dictionary t(f |e)
from L2 → L1 as follows:

P (f |ΘT ransL1 ) =
X

∀ e in L2

t(f |e) · P (e|ΘFL2 ) (1)

Table 3: Top Translation Alternatives for some sample words
in Probabilistic Bi-Lingual Dictionary

learned from a parallel sentence-aligned corpora
in L1−L2 based on word level alignments. Tiede-
mann (Tiedemann, 2001) has shown that the trans-
lation alternatives found using word alignments
could be used to infer various morphological and
semantic relations between terms. In Table 3,
we show the top translation alternatives for some
sample words. For example, the French word
américain (american) brings different variants of
the translation like american, america, us, united,
state, america which are lexically and semanti-
cally related. Hence, the probabilistic bi-lingual
dictionary acts as a rich source of morphologically
and semantically related feedback terms. Thus,
during this step, of translating the feedback model
as given in Equation 1, the translation model adds
related terms in L1 which have their source as the
term from feedback model ΘFL2 . The final Multi-
PRF model is obtained by interpolating the above
translated feedback model with the original query
model and the feedback model of language L1 as
given below:

Θ
Multi
L1

= (1− β − γ) ·ΘQ + β ·ΘFL1 + γ ·Θ
T rans

(2)

Since we want to retain the query focus during

back translation the feedback model in L2 is inter-
polated with the translated query before transla-
tion of the L2 feedback model. The parameters β
and γ control the relative importance of the orig-
inal query model, feedback model of L1 and the
translated feedback model obtained from L1 and
are tuned based on the choice of L1 and L2.

5 Experimental Setup
We evaluate the performance of our system us-
ing the standard CLEF evaluation data in six lan-
guages, widely varying in their familial relation-
ships - Dutch, German, English, French, Span-
ish and Finnish using more than 600 topics. The
details of the collections and their corresponding
topics used for MultiPRF are given in Table 1.
Note that, in each experiment, we choose assist-
ing collections such that the topics in the source
language are covered in the assisting collection so
as to get meaningful feedback terms. In all the top-
ics, we only use the title field. We ignore the top-
ics which have no relevant documents as the true
performance on those topics cannot be evaluated.

We demonstrate the performance of MultiPRF
approach with French, German and Finnish as
source languages and Dutch, English and Span-
ish as the assisting language. We later vary the
assisting language, for each source language and
study the effects. We use the Terrier IR platform
(Ounis et al., 2005) for indexing the documents.
We perform standard tokenization, stop word re-
moval and stemming. We use the Porter Stemmer
for English and the stemmers available through the
Snowball package for other languages. Other than
these, we do not perform any language-specific
processing on the languages. In case of French,

Table 4: Results comparing the performance of MultiPRF over baseline MBF on CLEF collections with English (EN), Spanish
(ES) and Dutch (NL) as assisting languages. Results marked as ‡ indicate that the improvement was found to be statistically
significant over the baseline at 90% confidence level (α = 0.01) when tested using a paired two-tailed t-test.

since some function words like l’, d’ etc., occur as
prefixes to a word, we strip them off during index-
ing and query processing, since it significantly im-
proves the baseline performance. We use standard
evaluation measures like MAP, P@5 and P@10
for evaluation. Additionally, for assessing robust-
ness, we use the Geometric Mean Average Preci-
sion (GMAP) metric (Robertson, 2006) which is
also used in the TREC Robust Track (Voorhees,
2006). The probabilistic bi-lingual dictionary used
in MultiPRF was learnt automatically by running
GIZA++: a word alignment tool (Och and Ney,
2003) on a parallel sentence aligned corpora. For
all the above language pairs we used the Europarl
Corpus (Philipp, 2005). We use Google Trans-
late as the query translation system as it has been
shown to perform well for the task (Wu et al.,
2008). We use the MBF approach explained in
Section 3 as a baseline for comparison. We use
two-stage Dirichlet smoothing with the optimal
parameters tuned based on the collection (Zhai and
Lafferty, 2004). We tune the parameters of MBF,
specifically λ and α, and choose the values which
give the optimal performance on a given collec-
tion. We uniformly choose the top ten documents
for feedback. Table 4 gives the overall results.

6 Results and Discussion

In Table 4, we see the performance of the Multi-
PRF approach for three assisting languages, and
how it compares with the baseline MBF meth-
ods. We find MultiPRF to consistently outperform

the baseline value on all metrics, namely MAP
(where significant improvements range from 4.4%
to 7.1%); P@5 (significant improvements range
from 4.9% to 39.5% and P@10 (where MultiPRF
has significant gains varying from 4% to 22.8%).
Additionally we also find MultiPRF to be more ro-
bust than the baseline, as indicated by the GMAP
score, where improvements vary from 4.2% to
730%. Furthermore we notice these trends hold
across different assisting languages, with Span-
ish and Dutch outperforming English as the as-
sisting language on some of the French and Ger-
man collections. On performing a more detailed
study of the results we identify the main reason
for improvements in our approach is the ability to
obtain good feedback terms in the assisting lan-
guage coupled with the introduction of lexically
and semantically related terms during the back-
translation step.

In Table 5, we see some examples, which illus-
trates the feedback terms brought by the MultiPRF
method. As can be seen by these example, the
gains achieved by MultiPRF are primarily due to
one of three reasons: (a) Good Feedback in As-
sisting Language: If the feedback model in the
assisting language contains good terms, then the
back-translation process will introduce the corre-
sponding feedback terms in the source language,
thus leading to improved performance. As an
example of this phenomena, consider the French
Query “Maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob”. In this
case the original feedback model also performs

negative results were observed in French and German collections.

quite strongly with a MAP score of 0.507. Al-
though there is no significant topic drift in this
case, there are not many relevant terms apart from
the query terms. However the same query per-
forms very well in English with all the documents
in the feedback set of the English corpus being rel-
evant, thus resulting in informative feedback terms
such as {bovin, scientif, recherch}. (b) Finding
Synonyms/Morphological Variations: Another sit-
uation in which MultiPRF leads to large improve-
ments is when it finds semantically/lexically re-
lated terms to the query terms which the origi-
nal feedback model was unable to. For example,
consider the French query “Ingénierie g´n´tique”.
While the feedback model was unable to find
any of the synonyms of the query terms, due to
their lack of co-occurence with the query terms,
the MultiPRF model was able to get these terms,
which are introduced primarily during the back-
translation process. Thus terms like {genetic, gen,
engineering}, which are synonyms of the query
words, are found thus resulting in improved per-
formance. (c) Combination of Above Factors:
Sometimes a combination of the above two factors
causes improvements in the performance as in the
German query “Ölkatastrophein Sibirien”. For
this query, MultiPRF finds good feedback terms
such as {russisch, russland} while also obtaining
semantically related terms such as {olverschmutz,
erdol, olunfall}.

Although all of the previously described exam-
ples had good quality translations of the query
in the assisting language, as mentioned in (Chin-

nakotla et al., 2010), the MultiPRF approach is
robust to suboptimal translation quality as well.
To see how MultiPRF leads to improvements even
with errors in query translation consider the Ger-
man Query “Siegerinnen von Wimbledon”. When
this is translated to English, the term “Lady” is
dropped, this causes only “Wimbledon Champi-
ons” to remain. As can be observed, this causes
terms like sampras to come up in the MultiPRF
model. However, while the MultiPRF model has
some terms pertaining to Men’s Winners of Wim-
bledon as well, the original feedback model suf-
fers from severe topic drift, with irrelevant terms
such as {telefonbuch, telekom} also amongst the
top terms. Thus we notice that despite the er-
ror in query translation MultiPRF still manages to
correct the drift of the original feedback model,
while also introducing relevant terms such as
{verfecht, steffi, martina, novotna, navratilova}
as well. Thus as shown in (Chinnakotla et al.,
2010), having a better query translation system
can only lead to better performance. We also
perform a detailed error analysis and found three
main reasons for MultiPRF failing: (i) Inaccura-
cies in query translation (including the presence of
out-of-vocabulary terms). This is seen in the Ger-
man Query AI in Lateinamerika, which wrongly
translates to Avian Flu in Latin America in Span-
ish thus affecting performance. (ii) Poor retrieval
in Assisting Language. Consider the French query
Les droits de l’enfant, for which due to topic drift
in English, MultiPRF performance reduces. (iii)
In a few rare cases inaccuracy in the back transla-

tion affects performance as well.

6.1 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

The MultiPRF parameters β and γ in Equation
2 control the relative importance assigned to the
original feedback model in source language L1,
the translated feedback model obtained from as-
sisting language L2 and the original query terms.
We varied the β and γ parameters for French, Ger-
man and Finnish collections with English, Dutch
and Spanish as assisting languages and studied its
effect on MAP of MultiPRF. The results are shown
in Figure 2. The results show that, in all the three
collections, the optimal value of the parameters
almost remains the same and lies in the range of
0.4-0.48. Due to the above reason, we arbitrarily
choose the parameters in the above range and do
not use any technique to learn these parameters.

6.2 Effect of Assisting Language Choice

In this section, we discuss the effect of varying
the assisting language. Besides, we also study
the inter and intra familial behaviour of source-
assisting language pairs. In order to ensure that
the results are comparable across languages, we
indexed the collections from the years 2002, 2003
and use common topics from the topic range 91-
200 that have relevant documents across all the six
languages. The number of such common topics
were 67. For each source language, we use the
other languages as assisting collections and study
the performance of MultiPRF. Since query trans-
lation quality varies across language pairs, we an-

alyze the behaviour of MultiPRF in the following
two scenarios: (a) Using ideal query translation
(b) Using Google Translate for query translation.
In ideal query translation setup, in order to elim-
inate its effect, we skip the query translation step
and use the corresponding original topics for each
target language instead. The results for both the
above scenarios are given in Tables 6 and 7.

From the results, we firstly observe that besides
English, other languages such as French, Spanish,
German and Dutch act as good assisting languages
and help in improving performance over mono-
lingual MBF. We also observe that the best as-
sisting language varies with the source language.
However, the crucial factors of the assisting lan-
guage which influence the performance of Multi-
PRF are: (a) Monolingual PRF Performance: The
main motivation for using a different language was
to get good feedback terms, especially in case of
queries which fail in the source language. Hence,
an assisting language in which the monolingual
feedback performance itself is poor, is unlikely
to give any performance gains. This observation
is evident in case of Finnish, which has the low-
est Monolingual MBF performance. The results
show that Finnish is the least helpful of assist-
ing languages, with performance similar to those
of the baselines. We also observe that the three
best performing assistant languages, i.e. English,
French and Spanish, have the highest monolingual
performances as well, thus further validating the
claim. One possible reason for this is the relative

ease of processing in these languages. (b) Familial
Similarity Between Languages: We observe that
the performance of MultiPRF is good if the as-
sisting language is from the same language fam-
ily. Birch et al. (2008) show that the language
family is a strong predictor of machine transla-
tion performance. Hence, the query translation
and back translation quality improves if the source
and assisting languages belong to the same family.
For example, in the Germanic family, the source-
assisting language pairs German-English, Dutch-
English, Dutch-German and German-Dutch show
good performance. Similarly, in Romance family,
the performance of French-Spanish confirms this
behaviour. In some cases, we observe that Multi-
PRF scores decent improvements even when the
assisting language does not belong to the same
language family as witnessed in French-English
and English-French. This is primarily due to their
strong monolingual MBF performance.

6.3 Effect of Language Family on Back
Translation Performance

As already mentioned, the performance of Multi-
PRF is good if the source and assisting languages
belong to the same family. In this section, we ver-
ify the above intuition by studying the impact of
language family on back translation performance.
The experiment designed is as follows: Given a
query in source language L1, the ideal translation
in assisting language L2 is used to compute the
query model in L2 using only the query terms.
Then, without performing PRF the query model

is directly back translated from L2 into L1 and
finally documents are re-ranked using this trans-
lated feedback model. Since the automatic query
translation and PRF steps have been eliminated,
the only factor which influences the MultiPRF per-
formance is the back-translation step. This means
that the source-assisting language pairs for which
the back-translation is good will score a higher
performance. The results of the above experiment
is shown in Table 8. For each source language,
the best performing assisting languages have been
highlighted.

The results show that the performance of
closely related languages like French-Spanish and
German-Dutch is more when compared to other
source-assistant language pairs. This shows that
in case of closely related languages, the back-
translation step succeeds in adding good terms
which are relevant like morphological variants,
synonyms and other semantically related terms.
Hence, familial closeness of the assisting language
helps in boosting the MultiPRF performance. An
exception to this trend is English as assisting lan-

guage which shows good performance across both
families.

6.4 Multiple Assisting Languages

So far, we have only considered a single assist-
ing language. However, a natural extension to
the method which comes to mind, is using mul-
tiple assisting languages. In other words, com-
bining the evidence from all the feedback mod-
els of more than one assisting language, to get a
feedback model which is better than that obtained
using a single assisting language. To check how
this simple extension works, we performed exper-
iments using a pair of assisting languages. In these
experiments for a given source language (from
amongst the 6 previously mentioned languages)
we tried using all pairs of assisting languages (for
each source language, we have 10 pairs possible).
To obtain the final model, we simply interpolate all
the feedback models with the initial query model,
in a similar manner as done in MultiPRF. The re-
sults for these experiments are given in Table 9.
As we see, out of the 60 possible combinations
of source language and assisting language pairs,
we obtain improvements of greater than 3% in 16
cases. Here the improvements are with respect to
the best model amongst the two MultiPRF mod-
els corresponding to each of the two assisting lan-
guages, with the same source language. Thus we
observe that a simple linear interpolation of mod-
els is not the best way of combining evidence from
multiple assisting languages. We also observe than
when German or Spanish are used as one of the
two assisting languages, they are most likely to

lead to improvements. A more detailed study of
this observation needs to be done to explain this.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
We studied the effect of different source-assistant
pairs and multiple assisting languages on the per-
formance of MultiPRF. Experiments across a wide
range of language pairs with varied degree of fa-
milial relationships show that MultiPRF improves
performance in most cases with the performance
improvement being more pronounced when the
source and assisting languages are closely related.
We also notice that the results are mixed when two
assisting languages are used simultaneously. As
part of future work, we plan to vary the model
interpolation parameters dynamically to improve
the performance in case of multiple assisting lan-
guages.
