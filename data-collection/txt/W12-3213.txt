Abstract

In this paper we describe our participation
in the contributed task at ACL Special work-
shop 2012. We contribute to the goal of en-
riching the textual content of ACL Anthology
by identifying the citation contexts in a paper
and linking them to their corresponding ref-
erences in the bibliography section. We use
Parscit, to process the Bibliography of each
paper. Pattern matching heuristics are then
used to connect the citations with their ref-
erences. Furthermore, we prepared a small
evaluation dataset, to test the efficiency of our
method. We achieved 95% precision and 80%
recall on this dataset.

1 Introduction

ACL Anthology represents the enduring effort to
digitally archive all the publications related to CL
and NLP, over the years. Recent work by (Bird
et al., 2008) to standardize the corpus in ACL An-
thology, makes it more than just a digital reposi-
tory of research results. The corpus has metadata
information such as ‘title’, ‘author (s)’, ‘publication
venue’ and ‘year’ about each paper along with their
extracted text content. However it lacks vital in-
formation about a scientific article such as position
of footnote (s), table (s) and figure captions, biblio-
graphic references, italics/emphasized text portions,
non-latin scripts, etc.

We would like to acknowledge funding support in part by
the Global Asia Institute under grant no. GAI-CP/20091116
and from the National Research Foundations grant no. R-252-
000-325-279.

The special workshop at ACL 2012, celebrates
50 years of ACL legacy by gathering contributions
about the history, evolution and future of compu-
tational linguistics. Apart from the technical pro-
gramme, the workshop also hosts a contributed task
to enrich the current state of Anthology corpus. A
rich-text format of the corpus will serve as a source
of study for research applications like citation anal-
ysis, summarization, argumentative zoning among
many others.

We contribute to this effort of enriching the An-
thology, by providing a means to link citations in
an article to their corresponding bibliographic refer-
ences. Robert Dale 1 defines citation, as a text string
in the document body that points to a reference at the
end of the document. Several citations may co-refer
to a single reference string. As an example consider
the following sentence,

Few approaches to parsing have tried to handle
disfluent utterances (notable exceptions are Core
& Schubert, 1999; Hindle, 1983; Nakatani &
Hirschberg, 1994).

The portion of texts in italics are the citations and
we intend to annotate each citation with an unique
identifier of their bibliographic reference.

<ref target="BI10">Hindle, 1983</ref>

Such annotations are useful for navigating be-
tween research articles and creating citation net-
works among them. These networks can be used to
understand the bibliometric analysis of a corpus.

2 Design

The task organizers distribute the entire Anthol-
ogy in two different XML formats, ‘paperXML’
that is obtained from Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) software and ‘TEI P5 XML’ that is generated
by PDFExtract (φyvind Raddum Berg, 2011). We
chose to process the PDFExtract format as it has no
character recognition errors. Since the expected out-
put should also follow ‘TEI P5’ guidelines, the lat-
ter input simplifies the process of target XML gen-
eration. The task of linking citations to references
primarily consists of three modules.

1. Processing the ‘Bibliography’ section of a pa-
per using Parscit.

2. Formatting the Parscit output to TEI P5 guide-
lines and merging it with the input XML.

3. Generating an identifier and citation marker for
each reference and annotating the text.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall design of our work.
Below we describe in detail about the modules used
to accomplish this task.

ences

Bibliography Parser: Parscit (Councill et al.,
2008) is a freely available, open-source implementa-
tion of a reference string parsing package. It formu-
lates this task as a sequence labelling problem that is
common to a large set of NLP tasks including POS
tagging and chunking. Parscit uses a conditional
random field formalism to learn a supervised model

and apply it on unseen data. During training, each
reference is represented using different classes of
features such as n-gram, token identity, punctuation
and other numeric properties. Parscit can label each
reference with 13 classes that correspond to com-
mon fields used in bibliographic reference manage-
ment software. Unlike heuristic methods, Parscit’s
supervised learning model can handle different stan-
dards followed by different communities and inad-
vertent manual errors in the Bibliography. Prior to
processing, Parscit segments the Bibliography sec-
tion from the rest of the paper using SectLabel (Lu-
ong et al., 2010), its extension for logical document
structure discovery.

Parscit works either with plain text or the Omni-
page output of a paper. Omnipage 2 is a state of
the art OCR engine that provides detailed informa-
tion about the layout of a document. Omnipage also
handles older, scanned papers. It gives the logical
index of every line in terms of page, column, para-
graph, and line number. The layout information is
used by Parscit to remove noise such as page num-
bers and footnotes between references and properly
divide them. Following is the Omnipage output for
the word “Rahul Agarwal” in the original pdf,

<ln l="558" t="266" r="695" b="284"
bold=true superscript="none"
fontSize="1250" fontFamily="roman">

<wd l="558" t="266" r="609" b="284">
Rahul </wd> <space/>

<wd l="619" t="266" r="695" b="283">
Agarwal </wd>

</ln>

The ‘l’ (left), ‘r’ (right), ‘t’ (top), ‘b’ (bottom) at-
tributes gives the exact location of an element in a
page. Further, features such as ‘bold’, ‘underlined’,
‘superscript/ subscript’ and ‘fontFamily’ contribute
towards an accurate identification and parsing of ref-
erences. For example, the change from one font
family to another usually serves as a separator be-
tween two different fields like ‘author’ and ‘title’ of
the paper. As PDFExtract currently does not provide
such information, we processed the original ‘pdf’
file using Omnipage and then finally parsed it us-
ing Parscit. Below is the XML output from Parscit
for a single reference,

<citation valid="true">
<authors>
<author>R Agarwal</author>
<author>L Boggess</author>
</authors>
<title>A simple but useful approach
to conjunct identification.</title>
<date>1992</date>
<marker>Agarwal, Boggess, 1992
</marker> </citation>

We used Parscit to segment the Bibliography
section into individual references. Additionally we
use the author, title, publication year information
together with the original marker of each reference
to generate citation markers that are used to find the
context of each reference (explained later). During
this process, we generated the Omnipage output
for the present Anthology that consists of 21,107
publications. As the ACL ARC has Omnipage
outputs only till 2007, our contribution will help to
update the corpus.

XML Merger: The original XML output from
Parscit doesn’t conform with the TEI P5 guidelines.
The ‘XML Merger’ module formats the Parscit
output into a ‘listBibl’ element and merges it with
the PDFExtract. The ‘listBibl’ element contains a
list of ‘biblStruct’ elements, in which bibliographic
sub-elements of each reference appear in a specified
order. Each reference is also assigned a ‘unique
id’ within the paper to link them with their citation
texts. The Bibliography section in the PDFExtract
is replaced with the TEI compatible Parscit output
such as below,

<listBibl>
<bibl xml:id="BI2">
<monogr>
<author>R Agarwal</author>
<author>L Boggess</author>
<title>A simple but useful approach
to conjunct identification.</title>

<imprint>
<date>1992</date>

</imprint>
</monogr>
</bibl>

To ensure a proper insertion, we search for labels
such as “References”, “Bibliography”, “References
and Notes”, or common variations of those strings.

In the case of having more than one match, the
context of first reference is used to resolve the
ambiguity. The match is considered as the starting
point of the Bibliography section, and the terminal
reference string from the Parscit output is used to
mark the end of it. After validating the matched
portion based on the position of its starting and
ending markers, it is replaced with the formatted
‘listBibl’ element.

Context Annotator: The final step is to bridge the
links between references and citation strings in the
merged XML. Several morphologically different
markers are generated for each reference based
on the ‘author’ and ‘publication year’ information
provided by Parscit. These markers are used to
find the corresponding citation string in the merged
XML. The markers may vary depending upon the
number of authors in a reference or the bibliography
style of the paper. Sample markers for a reference
with multiple authors are listed below,

Author1, Author2, Author3, Year
Author1 et.al, Year
Author1 and Author2, Year

Although Parscit provide the citation markers for
each reference, the recall is very low. We extended
these citation markers to make them more robust and
thus improve the overall recall. Below are the exten-
sions we made to the default markers.

1. Additional marker to allow square brackets and
round brackets in the parentheses. Such mark-
ers help to identify citations such as (Author,
Year), [Author, Year], (Author, [year])

2. Parscit markers only identify the citations with
the 4-digit format of the year. We modified it to
recognize both 4-digit and 2-digit format of the
year. e.g. Lin, 1996 and Lin, 96

3. Parscit doesn’t differentiate between identical
reference strings with same author and year in-
formation. We resolved it by including the ver-
sion number of the reference in the marker. e.g.
Lin, 2004a and Lin, 2004b

4. Heuristics are added to accommodate the de-
fault citation texts as specified in the reference
strings. For example in the reference string,

112



[Appelt85] Appelt, D. 1985 Planning English
Referring Expressions. Artificial Intelligence
26: 1-33.

[Appelt85] is identified as the citation marker. Each
marker is represented using a regular expression.
These regular expressions are applied on the text
from merged XML. The matches are annotated with
the unique id of its corresponding reference such as
‘<ref target= BI10>’

3 Challenges

The accuracy of Parscit is a bottle-neck for the per-
formance of this task. The false negatives produced
by Parscit leads to erroneous linkage between cita-
tion texts and reference ids. In certain cases Parscit
fails to identify portions of Bibliography section and
skips them while processing. This results in an in-
correct parsing and thus faulty linkage. Apart from
Parscit, we faced problems due to the character mis-
matching between Omnipage and PDFExtract out-
puts of a paper. For example the string ‘Pulman’
is recognized as Pullan by Omnipage and as Pul-
man by PDFExtract. The citation markers generated
from Parscit output in this case fails to identify the
context in the PDFExtract.

4 Evaluation

As there is no dataset to test the efficiency of our
method, we prepared a small dataset for evaluation
purposes. We manually sampled 20 papers from
the Anthology, making sure that all the publication
venues are included. The citation strings in each
paper are manually listed out along with the corre-
sponding reference id. For citation styles where no
Author and Year information is present, we used the
contextual words to identify the citation text. The
citation strings are listed in the same order as they
appear in the paper. Below we provide an extract of
the dataset, consisting of papers with three different
citation styles,

P92-1006 proposed [13] BI13
T87-1018 Mann&Thompson83 BI6
W00-0100 Krymolowski 1998 BI9

The first column is the Anthology id of the paper,
second column is the citation string from the paper
and third column is the unique id of the reference.

We measure the performance in terms of precision
and recall of the recognized citations. There are a to-
tal of 330 citation strings in the dataset. Our method
identified 280 strings as citations, out of which 266
are correct. Hence the precision is 0.95 (266/280)
and the recall is 0.801 (266/330). The low recall is
due to the incorrect recognition of author and year
strings by Parscit which lead to erroneous marker
generation. The precision is affected due to the flaws
in Parscit while differentiating citations with naked
numbers.

In future we plan to devise more flexible mark-
ers which can handle spelling mistakes, using edit
distance metric. Partial matches and sub-sequence
matches need to be incorporated to support long dis-
tance citations. Parscit can further be improved to
accurately parse and identify the reference strings.
