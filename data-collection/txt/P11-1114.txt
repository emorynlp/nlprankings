Abstract

The goal of our research is to improve
event extraction by learning to identify sec-
ondary role filler contexts in the absence
of event keywords. We propose a multi-
layered event extraction architecture that pro-
gressively “zooms in” on relevant informa-
tion. Our extraction model includes a docu-
ment genre classifier to recognize event nar-
ratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and
noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers.
These modules are organized as a pipeline to
gradually zero in on event-related information.
We present results on the MUC-4 event ex-
traction data set and show that this model per-
forms better than previous systems.

1 Introduction

Event extraction is an information extraction (IE)
task that involves identifying the role fillers for
events in a particular domain. For example, the
Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) chal-
lenged NLP researchers to create event extraction
systems for domains such as terrorism (e.g., to iden-
tify the perpetrators, victims, and targets of terrorism
events) and management succession (e.g., to iden-
tify the people and companies involved in corporate
management changes).

Most event extraction systems use either a
learning-based classifier to label words as role
fillers, or lexico-syntactic patterns to extract role
fillers from pattern contexts. Both approaches, how-
ever, generally tackle event recognition and role
filler extraction at the same time. In other words,

most event extraction systems primarily recognize
contexts that explicitly refer to a relevant event. For
example, a system that extracts information about
murders will recognize expressions associated with
murder (e.g., “killed”, “assassinated”, or “shot to
death”) and extract role fillers from the surround-
ing context. But many role fillers occur in contexts
that do not explicitly mention the event, and those
fillers are often overlooked. For example, the per-
petrator of a murder may be mentioned in the con-
text of an arrest, an eyewitness report, or specula-
tion about possible suspects. Victims may be named
in sentences that discuss the aftermath of the event,
such as the identification of bodies, transportation
of the injured to a hospital, or conclusions drawn
from an investigation. We will refer to these types of
sentences as “secondary contexts” because they are
generally not part of the main event description. Dis-
course analysis is one option to explicitly link these
secondary contexts to the event, but discourse mod-
elling is itself a difficult problem.

The goal of our research is to improve event ex-
traction by learning to identify secondary role filler
contexts in the absence of event keywords. We cre-
ate a set of classifiers to recognize role-specific con-
texts that suggest the presence of a likely role filler
regardless of whether a relevant event is mentioned
or not. For example, our model should recognize
that a sentence describing an arrest probably in-
cludes a reference to a perpetrator, even though the
crime itself is reported elsewhere.

Extracting information from these secondary con-
texts can be risky, however, unless we know that
the larger context is discussing a relevant event. To

1137



address this, we adopt a two-pronged strategy for
event extraction that handles event narrative docu-
ments differently from other documents. We define
an event narrative as an article whose main purpose
is to report the details of an event. We apply the role-
specific sentence classifiers only to event narratives
to aggressively search for role fillers in these sto-
ries. However, other types of documents can men-
tion relevant events too. The MUC-4 corpus, for ex-
ample, includes interviews, speeches, and terrorist
propaganda that contain information about terrorist
events. We will refer to these documents as fleet-
ing reference texts because they mention a relevant
event somewhere in the document, albeit briefly. To
ensure that relevant information is extracted from all
documents, we also apply a conservative extraction
process to every document to extract facts from ex-
plicit event sentences.

Our complete event extraction model, called
TIER, incorporates both document genre and role-
specific context recognition into 3 layers of analy-
sis: document analysis, sentence analysis, and noun
phrase (NP) analysis. At the top level, we train a
text genre classifier to identify event narrative doc-
uments. At the middle level, we create two types
of sentence classifiers. Event sentence classifiers
identify sentences that are associated with relevant
events, and role-specific context classifiers identify
sentences that contain possible role fillers irrespec-
tive of whether an event is mentioned. At the low-
est level, we use role filler extractors to label indi-
vidual noun phrases as role fillers. As documents
pass through the pipeline, they are analyzed at dif-
ferent levels of granularity. All documents pass
through the event sentence classifier, and event sen-
tences are given to the role filler extractors. Docu-
ments identified as event narratives additionally pass
through role-specific sentence classifiers, and the
role-specific sentences are also given to the role filler
extractors. This multi-layered approach creates an
event extraction system that can discover role fillers
in a variety of different contexts, while maintaining
good precision.

In the following sections, we position our research
with respect to related work, present the details of
our multi-layered event extraction model, and show
experimental results for five event roles using the
MUC-4 data set.

2 Related Work

Some event extraction data sets only include doc-
uments that describe relevant events (e.g., well-
known data sets for the domains of corporate ac-
quisitions (Freitag, 1998b; Freitag and McCallum,
2000; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004), job postings
(Califf and Mooney, 2003; Freitag and McCallum,
2000), and seminar announcements (Freitag, 1998b;
Ciravegna, 2001; Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finn and
Kushmerick, 2004; Gu and Cercone, 2006). But
many IE data sets present a more realistic task where
the IE system must determine whether a relevant
event is present in the document, and if so, extract
its role fillers. Most of the Message Understand-
ing Conference data sets represent this type of event
extraction task, containing (roughly) a 50/50 mix
of relevant and irrelevant documents (e.g., MUC-3,
MUC-4, MUC-6, and MUC-7 (Hirschman, 1998)).
Our research focuses on this setting where the event
extraction system is not assured of getting only rele-
vant documents to process.

Most event extraction models can be character-
ized as either pattern-based or classifier-based ap-
proaches. Early event extraction systems used hand-
crafted patterns (e.g., (Appelt et al., 1993; Lehn-
ert et al., 1991)), but more recent systems gener-
ate patterns or rules automatically using supervised
learning (e.g., (Kim and Moldovan, 1993; Riloff,
1993; Soderland et al., 1995; Huffman, 1996; Fre-
itag, 1998b; Ciravegna, 2001; Califf and Mooney,
2003)), weakly supervised learning (e.g., (Riloff,
1996; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Yangarber et al.,
2000; Sudo et al., 2003; Stevenson and Greenwood,
2005)), or unsupervised learning (e.g., (Shinyama
and Sekine, 2006; Sekine, 2006)). In addition, many
classifiers have been created to sequentially label
event role fillers in a sentence (e.g., (Freitag, 1998a;
Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004;
Li et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2005)). Research has
also been done on relation extraction (e.g., (Roth
and Yih, 2001; Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu and
Mooney, 2007)), but that task is different from event
extraction because it focuses on isolated relations
rather than template-based event analysis.

Most event extraction systems scan a text and
search small context windows using patterns or a
classifier. However, recent work has begun to ex-

1138



Figure 1: TIER: A Multi-Layered Architecture for Event Extraction

plore more global approaches. (Maslennikov and
Chua, 2007) use discourse trees and local syntactic
dependencies in a pattern-based framework to incor-
porate wider context. Ji and Grishman (2008) en-
force event role consistency across different docu-
ments. (Liao and Grishman, 2010) use cross-event
inference to help with the extraction of role fillers
shared across events. And there have been several
recent IE models that explore the idea of identify-
ing relevant sentences to gain a wider contextual
view and then extracting role fillers. (Gu and Cer-
cone, 2006) created HMMs to first identify relevant
sentences, but their research focused on eliminating
redundant extractions and worked with seminar an-
nouncements, where the system was only given rel-
evant documents. (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007) de-
veloped a system that learns to recognize event sen-
tences and uses patterns that have a semantic affinity
for an event role to extract role fillers. GLACIER
(Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009) jointly considers sen-
tential evidence and phrasal evidence in a unified
probabilistic framework. Our research follows in
the same spirit as these approaches by performing
multiple levels of text analysis. But our event ex-
traction model includes two novel contributions: (1)
we develop a set of role-specific sentence classifiers
to learn to recognize secondary contexts associated
with each type of event role , and (2) we exploit text
genre to incorporate a third level of analysis that en-
ables the system to aggressively hunt for role fillers
in documents that are event narratives. In Section 5,
we compare the performance of our model with both
the GLACIER system and Patwardhan & Riloff’s
semantic affinity model.

3 A Multi-Layered Approach to Event
Extraction

The main idea behind our approach is to analyze
documents at multiple levels of granularity in order
to identify role fillers that occur in different types of
contexts. Our event extraction model progressively
“zooms in” on relevant information by first identi-
fying the document type, then identifying sentences
that are likely to contain relevant information, and
finally analyzing individual noun phrases to identify
role fillers. The key advantage of this architecture is
that it allows us to search for information using two
different principles: (1) we look for contexts that di-
rectly refer to the event, as per most traditional event
extraction systems, and (2) we look for secondary
contexts that are often associated with a specific type
of role filler. Identifying these role-specific contexts
can root out important facts would have been oth-
erwise missed. Figure 1 shows the multi-layered
pipeline of our event extraction system.

An important aspect of our model is that two dif-
ferent strategies are employed to handle documents
of different types. The event extraction task is to
find any description of a relevant event, even if the
event is not the topic of the article.1 Consequently,
all documents are given to the event sentence recog-
nizers and their mission is to identify any sentence
that mentions a relevant event. This path through the
pipeline is conservative because information is ex-
tracted only from event sentences, but all documents
are processed, including stories that contain only a
fleeting reference to a relevant event.

1Per the MUC-4 task definition (MUC-4 Proceedings,
1992).

1139



The second path through the pipeline performs
additional processing for documents that belong to
the event narrative text genre. For event narratives,
we assume that most of the document discusses a
relevant event so we can more aggressively hunt for
event-related information in secondary contexts.

In this section, we explain how we create the two
types of sentence classifiers and the role filler extrac-
tors. We will return to the issue of document genre
and the event narrative classifier in Section 4.

3.1 Sentence Classification

We have argued that event role fillers commonly oc-
cur in two types of contexts: event contexts and
role-specific secondary contexts. For the purposes
of this research, we use sentences as our definition
of a “context”, although there are obviously many
other possible definitions. An event context is a sen-
tence that describes the actual event. A secondary
context is a sentence that provides information re-
lated to an event but in the context of other activities
that precede or follow the event.

For both types of classifiers, we use exactly the
same feature set, but we train them in different ways.
The MUC-4 corpus used in our experiments in-
cludes a training set consisting of documents and an-
swer keys. Each document that describes a relevant
event has answer key templates with the role fillers
(answer key strings) for each event. To train the
event sentence recognizer, we consider a sentence
to be a positive training instance if it contains one or
more answer key strings from any of the event roles.
This produced 3,092 positive training sentences. All
remaining sentences that do not contain any answer
key strings are used as negative instances. This pro-
duced 19,313 negative training sentences, yielding a
roughly 6:1 ratio of negative to positive instances.

There is no guarantee that a classifier trained in
this way will identify event sentences, but our hy-
pothesis was that training across all of the event
roles together would produce a classifier that learns
to recognize general event contexts. This approach
was also used to train GLACIER’s sentential event
recognizer (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009), and they
demonstrated that this approach worked reasonably
well when compared to training with event sentences
labelled by human judges.

The main contribution of our work is introducing

additional role-specific sentence classifiers to seek
out role fillers that appear in less obvious secondary
contexts. We train a set of role-specific sentence
classifiers, one for each type of event role. Every
sentence that contains a role filler of the appropri-
ate type is used as a positive training instance. Sen-
tences that do not contain any answer key strings are
negative instances.2 In this way, we force each clas-
sifier to focus on the contexts specific to its particu-
lar event role. We expect the role-specific sentence
classifiers to find some secondary contexts that the
event sentence classifier will miss, although some
sentences may be classified as both.

Using all possible negative instances would pro-
duce an extremely skewed ratio of negative to pos-
itive instances. To control the skew and keep the
training set-up consistent with the event sentence
classifier, we randomly choose from the negative in-
stances to produce a 6:1 ratio of negative to positive
instances.

Both types of classifiers use an SVM model cre-
ated with SVMlin (Keerthi and DeCoste, 2005), and
exactly the same features. The feature set consists
of the unigrams and bigrams that appear in the train-
ing texts, the semantic class of each noun phrase3,
plus a few additional features to represent the tense
of the main verb phrase in the sentence and whether
the document is long (> 35 words) or short (< 5
words). All of the feature values are binary.

3.2 Role Filler Extractors

Our extraction model also includes a set of role filler
extractors, one per event role. Each extractor re-
ceives a sentence as input and determines which
noun phrases (NPs) in the sentence are fillers for the
event role. To train an SVM classifier, noun phrases
corresponding to answer key strings for the event
role are positive instances. We randomly choose
among all noun phrases that are not in the answer
keys to create a 10:1 ratio of negative to positive in-
stances.

2We intentionally do not use sentences that contain fillers
for competing event roles as negative instances because sen-
tences often contain multiple role fillers of different types (e.g.,
a weapon may be found near a body). Sentences without any
role fillers are certain to be irrelevant contexts.

3We used the Sundance parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004) to
identify noun phrases and assign semantic class labels.

1140



The feature set for the role filler extractors is
much richer than that of the sentence classifiers be-
cause they must carefully consider the local context
surrounding a noun phrase. We will refer to the noun
phrase being labelled as the targeted NP. The role
filler extractors use three types of features:

Lexical features: we represent four words to the
left and four words to the right of the targeted NP, as
well as the head noun and modifiers (adjectives and
noun modifiers) of the targeted NP itself.

Lexico-syntactic patterns: we use the AutoSlog
pattern generator (Riloff, 1993) to automatically
create lexico-syntactic patterns around each noun
phrase in the sentence. These patterns are similar
to dependency relations in that they typically repre-
sent the syntactic role of the NP with respect to other
constituents (e.g., subject-of, object-of, and noun ar-
guments).

Semantic features: we use the Stanford NER tag-
ger (Finkel et al., 2005) to determine if the targeted
NP is a named entity, and we use the Sundance
parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004) to assign seman-
tic class labels to each NP’s head noun.

4 Event Narrative Document Classification

One of our goals was to explore the use of document
genre to permit more aggressive strategies for ex-
tracting role fillers. In this section, we first present
an analysis of the MUC-4 data set which reveals the
distribution of event narratives in the corpus, and
then explain how we train a classifier to automati-
cally identify event narrative stories.

4.1 Manual Analysis

We define an event narrative as an article whose
main focus is on reporting the details of an event.
For the purposes of this research, we are only con-
cerned with events that are relevant to the event ex-
traction task (i.e., terrorism). An irrelevant docu-
ment is an article that does not mention any rele-
vant events. In between these extremes is another
category of documents that briefly mention a rele-
vant event, but the event is not the focus of the ar-
ticle. We will refer to these documents as fleeting
reference documents. Many of the fleeting reference
documents in the MUC-4 corpus are transcripts of
interviews, speeches, or terrorist propaganda com-

muniques that refer to a terrorist event and mention
at least one role filler, but within a discussion about
a different topic (e.g., the political ramifications of a
terrorist incident).

To gain a better understanding of how we might
create a system to automatically distinguish event
narrative documents from fleeting reference docu-
ments, we manually labelled the 116 relevant docu-
ments in our tuning set. This was an informal study
solely to help us understand the nature of these texts.

Table 1: Manual Analysis of Document Types

The first row of Table 1 shows the distribution of
event narratives and fleeting references based on our
“gold standard” manual annotations. We see that
more than half of the relevant documents (62/116)
are not focused on reporting a terrorist event, even
though they contain information about a terrorist
event somewhere in the document.

4.2 Heuristics for Event Narrative
Identification

Our goal is to train a document classifier to automat-
ically identify event narratives. The MUC-4 answer
keys reveal which documents are relevant and irrel-
evant with respect to the terrorism domain, but they
do not tell us which relevant documents are event
narratives and which are fleeting reference stories.
Based on our manual analysis of the tuning set, we
developed several heuristics to help separate them.

We observed two types of clues: the location of
the relevant information, and the density of rele-
vant information. First, we noticed that event nar-
ratives tend to mention relevant information within
the first several sentences, whereas fleeting refer-
ence texts usually mention relevant information only
in the middle or end of the document. Therefore our
first heuristic requires that an event narrative men-
tion a role filler within the first 7 sentences.

Second, event narratives generally have a higher
density of relevant information. We use several cri-
teria to estimate information density because a sin-
gle criterion was inadequate to cover different sce-

1141



narios. For example, some documents mention role
fillers throughout the document. Other documents
contain a high concentration of role fillers in some
parts of the document but no role fillers in other
parts. We developed three density heuristics to ac-
count for different situations. All of these heuristics
count distinct role fillers. The first density heuristic
requires that more than 50% of the sentences contain
at least one role filler ( |RelSents||AllSents| > 0.5) . Figure 2
shows histograms for different values of this ratio in
the event narrative (a) vs. the fleeting reference doc-
uments (b). The histograms clearly show that docu-
ments with a high (> 50%) ratio are almost always
event narratives.

A second density heuristic requires that the ratio
of different types of roles filled to sentences be >
50% ( |Roles||AllSents| > 0.5). A third density heuristic
requires that the ratio of distinct role fillers to sen-
tences be > 70% ( |RoleF illers||AllSents| > 0.7). If any of
these three criteria are satisfied, then the document
is considered to have a high density of relevant in-
formation.4

We use these heuristics to label a document as an
event narrative if: (1) it has a high density of relevant
information, and (2) it mentions a role filler within
the first 7 sentences.

The second row of Table 1 shows the performance
of these heuristics on the tuning set. The heuristics
correctly identify 40

cause the heuristics were derived from analysis of
the tuning set. But we felt confident enough to move
forward with using these heuristics to generate train-

ing data for an event narrative classifier.

4.3 Event Narrative Classifier

The heuristics above use the answer keys to help de-
termine whether a story belongs to the event narra-
tive genre, but our goal is to create a classifier that
can identify event narrative documents without the
benefit of answer keys. So we used the heuristics
to automatically create training data for a classifier
by labelling each relevant document in the training
set as an event narrative or a fleeting reference doc-
ument. Of the 700 relevant documents, 292 were
labeled as event narratives. We then trained a doc-
ument classifier using the 292 event narrative docu-
ments as positive instances and all irrelevent training
documents as negative instances. The 308 relevant
documents that were not identified as event narra-
tives were discarded to minimize noise (i.e., we es-
timate that our heuristics fail to identify 25% of the
event narratives). We then trained an SVM classifier
using bag-of-words (unigram) features.

Table 2 shows the performance of the event nar-
rative classifier on the manually labeled tuning set.
The classifier identified 69% of the event narratives
with 63% precision. Overall accuracy was 81%.

Recall Precision Accuracy

Table 2: Event Narrative Classifier Results

At first glance, the performance of this classifier
is mediocre. However, these results should be inter-
preted loosely because there is not always a clear di-
viding line between event narratives and other doc-
uments. For example, some documents begin with
a specific event description in the first few para-
graphs but then digress to discuss other topics. For-
tunately, it is not essential for TIER to have a per-
fect event narrative classifier since all documents
will be processed by the event sentence recognizer
anyway. The recall of the event narrative classifier
means that nearly 70% of the event narratives will
get additional scrutiny, which should help to find ad-
ditional role fillers. Its precision of 63% means that
some documents that are not event narratives will
also get additional scrutiny, but information will be
extracted only if both the role-specific sentence rec-
ognizer and NP extractors believe they have found

4.4 Domain-relevant Document Classifier

For comparison’s sake, we also created a docu-
ment classifier to identify domain-relevant docu-
ments. That is, we trained a classifier to determine
whether a document is relevant to the domain of
terrorism, irrespective of the style of the document.
We trained an SVM classifier with the same bag-of-
words feature set, using all relevant documents in the
training set as positive instances and all irrelevant
documents as negative instances. We use this clas-
sifier for several experiments described in the next
section.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Data Set and Metrics

We evaluated our approach on a standard benchmark
collection for event extraction systems, the MUC-4
data set (MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992). The MUC-4
corpus consists of 1700 documents with associated
answer key templates. To be consistent with previ-
ously reported results on this data set, we use the
1300 DEV documents for training, 200 documents
(TST1+TST2) as a tuning set and 200 documents
(TST3+TST4) as the test set. Roughly half of the
documents are relevant (i.e., they mention at least 1
terrorist event) and the rest are irrelevant.

We evaluate our system on the five MUC-4
“string-fill” event roles: perpetrator individuals,
perpetrator organizations, physical targets, victims

and weapons. The complete IE task involves tem-
plate generation, which is complex because many
documents have multiple templates (i.e., they dis-
cuss multiple events). Our work focuses on extract-
ing individual facts and not on template generation
per se (e.g., we do not perform coreference resolu-
tion or event tracking). Consequently, our evalua-
tion follows that of other recent work and evaluates
the accuracy of the extractions themselves by match-
ing the head nouns of extracted NPs with the head
nouns of answer key strings (e.g., “armed guerril-
las” is considered to match “guerrillas”)5 . Our re-
sults are reported as Precision/Recall/F(1)-score for
each event role separately. We also show an overall
average for all event roles combined.6

5.2 Baselines

As baselines, we compare the performance of our
IE system with three other event extraction sys-
tems. The first baseline is AutoSlog-TS (Riloff,
1996), which uses domain-specific extraction pat-
terns. AutoSlog-TS applies its patterns to every sen-
tence in every document, so does not attempt to
explicitly identify relevant sentences or documents.
The next two baselines are more recent systems:
the (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007) semantic affin-
ity model and the (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009)
GLACIER system. The semantic affinity approach

5Pronouns were discarded since we do not perform corefer-
ence resolution. Duplicate extractions with the same head noun
were counted as one hit or one miss.

6We generated the Average scores ourselves by macro-
averaging over the scores reported for the individual event roles.

1143



explicitly identifies event sentences and uses pat-
terns that have a semantic affinity for an event role
to extract role fillers. GLACIER is a probabilistic
model that incorporates both phrasal and sentential
evidence jointly to label role fillers.

The first 3 rows in Table 3 show the results for
each of these systems on the MUC-4 data set. They
all used the same evaluation criteria as our results.

5.3 Experimental Results

The lower portion of Table 3 shows the results of
a variety of event extraction models that we cre-
ated using different components of our system. The
AllSent row shows the performance of our Role
Filler Extractors when applied to every sentence in
every document. This system produced high recall,
but precision was consistently low.

The EventSent row shows the performance of
our Role Filler Extractors applied only to the event
sentences identified by our event sentence classi-
fier. This boosts precision across all event roles, but
with a sharp reduction in recall. We see a roughly
20 point swing from recall to precision. These re-
sults are similar to GLACIER’s results on most event
roles, which isn’t surprising because GLACIER also
incorporates event sentence identification.

The RoleSent row shows the results of our Role
Filler Extractors applied only to the role-specific
sentences identified by our classifiers. We see a 12-
13 point swing from recall to precision compared
to the AllSent row. This result is consistent with
our hypothesis that many role fillers exist in role-
specific contexts that are not event sentences. As ex-
pected, extracting facts from role-specific contexts
that do not necessarily refer to an event is less reli-
able. The EventSent+RoleSent row shows the re-
sults when information is extracted from both types
of sentences. We see slightly higher recall, which
confirms that one set of extractions is not a strict
subset of the other, but precision is still relatively
low.

The next set of experiments incorporates docu-
ment classification as the third layer of text analy-
sis. The DomDoc/EventSent+DomDoc/RoleSent
row shows the results of applying both types of
sentence classifiers only to documents identified as
domain-relevant by the Domain-relevant Document
(DomDoc) Classifier described in Section 4.4. Ex-

tracting information only from domain-relevant doc-
uments improves precision by +6, but also sacrifices
8 points of recall.

The EventSent row reveals that information
found in event sentences has the highest precision,
even without relying on document classification. We
concluded that evidence of an event sentence is
probably sufficient to warrant role filler extraction
irrespective of the style of the document. As we dis-
cussed in Section 4, many documents contain only
a fleeting reference to an event, so it is important
to be able to extract information from those isolated
event descriptions as well. Consequently, we cre-
ated a system, EventSent+DomDoc/RoleSent, that
extracts information from event sentences in all doc-
uments, but extracts information from role-specific
sentences only if they appear in a domain-relevant
document. This architecture captured the best of
both worlds: recall improved from 58% to 65% with
only a one point drop in precision.

Finally, we evaluated the idea of using document
genre as a filter instead of domain relevance. The
last row, EventSent+ENarrDoc/RoleSent, shows
the results of our final architecture which extracts
information from event sentences in all documents,
but extracts information from role-specific sentences
only in Event Narrative documents. This architec-
ture produced the best F1 score of 56. This model in-
creases precision by an additional 4 points and pro-
duces the best balance of recall and precision.

Overall, TIER’s multi-layered extraction architec-
ture produced higher F1 scores than previous sys-
tems on four of the five event roles. The improved
recall is due to the additional extractions from sec-
ondary contexts. The improved precision comes
from our two-pronged strategy of treating event nar-
ratives differently from other documents. TIER ag-
gressively searches for extractions in event narrative
stories but is conservative and extracts information
only from event sentences in all other documents.

5.4 Analysis

We looked through some examples of TIER’s output
to try to gain insight about its strengths and limita-
tions. TIER’s role-specific sentence classifiers did
correctly identify some sentences containing role
fillers that were not classified as event sentences.
Several examples are shown below, with the role

1144



fillers in italics:

(1) “The victims were identified as David Lecky, director
of the Columbus school, and James Arthur Donnelly.”

(2) “There were seven children, including four of the
Vice President’s children, in the home at the time.”

(3) “The woman fled and sought refuge inside the
facilities of the Salvadoran Alberto Masferrer University,
where she took a group of students as hostages, threaten-
ing them with hand grenades.”

(4) “The FMLN stated that several homes were damaged
and that animals were killed in the surrounding hamlets
and villages.”

The first two sentences identify victims, but the
terrorist event itself was mentioned earlier in the
document. The third sentence contains a perpetrator
(the woman), victims (students), and weapons (hand
grenades) in the context of a hostage situation after
the main event (a bus attack), when the perpetrator
escaped. The fourth sentence describes incidental
damage to civilian homes following clashes between
government forces and guerrillas.

However there is substantial room for improve-
ment in each of TIER’s subcomponents, and many
role fillers are still overlooked. One reason is that it
can be difficult to recognize acts of terrorism. Many
sentences refer to a potentially relevant subevent
(e.g., injury or physical damage) but recognizing
that the event is part of a terrorist incident depends
on the larger discourse. For example, consider the
examples below that TIER did not recognize as
relevant sentences:

(5) “Later, two individuals in a Chevrolet Opala automo-
bile pointed AK rifles at the students, fired some shots,
and quickly drove away.”

(6) “Meanwhile, national police members who were
dressed in civilian clothes seized university students
Hugo Martinez and Raul Ramirez, who are still missing.”

(7) “All labor union offices in San Salvador were looted.”

In the first sentence, the event is described as
someone pointing rifles at people and the perpetra-
tors are referred to simply as individuals. There are

no strong keywords in this sentence that reveal this
is a terrorist attack. In the second sentence, police
are being accused of state-sponsored terrorism when
they seize civilians. The verb “seize” is common
in this corpus, but usually refers to the seizing of
weapons or drug stashes, not people. The third sen-
tence describes a looting subevent. Acts of looting
and vandalism are not usually considered to be ter-
rorism, but in this article it is in the context of accu-
sations of terrorist acts by government officials.

6 Conclusions

We have presented a new approach to event extrac-
tion that uses three levels of analysis: document
genre classification to identify event narrative sto-
ries, two types of sentence classifiers, and noun
phrase classifiers. A key contribution of our work is
the creation of role-specific sentence classifiers that
can detect role fillers in secondary contexts that do
not directly refer to the event. Another important as-
pect of our approach is a two-pronged strategy that
handles event narratives differently from other doc-
uments. TIER aggressively hunts for role fillers in
event narratives, but is conservative about extract-
ing information from other documents. This strategy
produced improvements in both recall and precision
over previous state-of-the-art systems.

This work just scratches the surface of using doc-
ument genre identification to improve information
extraction accuracy. In future work, we hope to
identify additional types of document genre styles
and incorporate genre directly into the extraction
model. Coreference resolution and discourse anal-
ysis will also be important to further improve event
extraction performance.
