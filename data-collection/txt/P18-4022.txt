Abstract

We compare the fast training and decod-
ing speed of RETURNN of attention mod-
els for translation, due to fast CUDA
LSTM kernels, and a fast pure Tensor-
Flow beam search decoder. We show that
a layer-wise pretraining scheme for recur-
rent attention models gives over 1% BLEU
improvement absolute and it allows to
train deeper recurrent encoder networks.
Promising preliminary results on max. ex-
pected BLEU training are presented. We
obtain state-of-the-art models trained on
the WMT 2017 German↔English trans-
lation task. We also present end-to-end
model results for speech recognition on
the Switchboard task. The flexibility of
RETURNN allows a fast research feed-
back loop to experiment with alternative
architectures, and its generality allows to
use it on a wide range of applications.

1 Introduction

RETURNN, the RWTH extensible training frame-
work for universal recurrent neural networks, was
introduced in (Doetsch et al., 2017). The source
code is fully open1. It can use Theano (Theano
Development Team, 2016) or TensorFlow (Ten-
sorFlow Development Team, 2015) for its com-
putation. Since it was introduced, it got ex-
tended by comprehensive TensorFlow support. A
generic recurrent layer allows for a wide range of
encoder-decoder-attention or other recurrent struc-
tures. An automatic optimization logic can opti-
mize the computation graph depending on train-
ing, scheduled sampling, sequence training, or
beam search decoding. The automatic optimiza-
tion together with our fast native CUDA imple-
mented LSTM kernels allows for very fast train-

ing and decoding. We will show in speed compar-
isons with Sockeye (Hieber et al., 2017) that we
are at least as fast or usually faster in both train-
ing and decoding. Additionally, we show in ex-
periments that we can train very competitive mod-
els for machine translation and speech recogni-
tion. This flexibility together with the speed is the
biggest strength of RETURNN.

Our focus will be on recurrent attention mod-
els. We introduce a layer-wise pretraining scheme
for attention models and show its significant ef-
fect on deep recurrent encoder models. We show
promising preliminary results on expected maxi-
mum BLEU training. The configuration files of
all the experiments are publicly available2.

2 Related work

Multiple frameworks exist for training attention
models, most of which are focused on machine
translation.

• Sockeye (Hieber et al., 2017) is a generic
framework based on MXNet (Chen et al.,
2015) which is most compareable to RE-
TURNN as it is generic although we argue
that RETURNN is more flexible and faster.

• OpenNMT (Levin et al., 2017a,b) based on
Lua (Ierusalimschy et al., 2006) which is dis-
continued in development. Separate PyTorch
(PyTorch Development Team, 2018) and
TensorFlow implementation exists, which are
more recent. We will demonstrate that RE-
TURNN is more flexible.

• Nematus (Sennrich et al., 2017) is based on
Theano (Theano Development Team, 2016)
which is going to be discontinued in devel-
opment. We show that RETURNN is much
faster in both training and decoding as can
be concluded from our speed comparison to

Sockeye and the comparisons performed by
the Sockeye authors (Hieber et al., 2017).

• Marian (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016) is
implemented directly in C++ for perfor-
mance reasons. Again by our speed compar-
isons and the comparisons performed by the
Sockeye authors (Hieber et al., 2017), one
can conclude that RETURNN is very com-
petitive in terms of speed, but is much more
flexible.

• NeuralMonkey (Helcl and Libovickỳ, 2017)
is based on TensorFlow (TensorFlow Devel-
opment Team, 2015). This framework is not
as flexible as RETURNN. Also here we can
conclude just as before that RETURNN is
much faster in both training and decoding.

• Tensor2Tensor (Vaswani et al., 2018) is based
on TensorFlow (TensorFlow Development
Team, 2015). It comes with the reference
implementation of the Transformer model
(Vaswani et al., 2017), however, it lacks sup-
port for recurrent decoder models and overall
is way less flexible than RETURNN.

3 Speed comparison

Various improved and fast CUDA LSTM kernels
are available for the TensorFlow backend in RE-
TURNN. A comparison of the speed of its own
LSTM kernel vs. other TensorFlow LSTM kernels
can be found on the website3. In addition, an au-
tomatic optimization path which moves out com-
putation of the recurrent loop as much as possible
improves the performance.

We want to compare different toolkits in train-
ing and decoding for a recurrent attention model
in terms of speed on a GPU. Here, we try to
maximize the batch size such that it still fits into
the GPU memory of our reference GPU card, the
Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti with 11 GB of memory. We
keep the maximum sequence length in a batch the
same, which is 60 words. We always use Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) for training. In Table 1,
we see that RETURNN is the fastest, and also is
most efficient in its memory consumption (implied
by the larger batches). For these speed experi-
ments, we did not tune any of the hyper parame-
ters of RETURNN which explains its worse per-
formance. The aim here is to match Sockeye’s
exact architecture for speed and memory com-
parison. During training, we observed that the
learning rate scheduling settings of Sockeye are

more pessimistic, i.e. the decrease is slower and
it sees the data more often until convergence. This
greatly increases the total training time but in our
experience also improves the model.

For decoding, we extend RETURNN with a fast
pure TensorFlow beam search decoder, which sup-
ports batch decoding and can run on the GPU.
A speed and memory consumption comparison is
shown in Table 2. We see that RETURNN is the
fastest. We report results for the batch size that
yields the best speed. The slow speed of Sockeye
is due to frequent cross-device communication.

mean that it uses the whole GPU memory. These
are the same models as in Table 1.

4 Performance comparison

We want to study what possible performance we
can get with each framework on a specific task.
We restrict this comparison here to recurrent at-
tention models.

The first task is the WMT 2017 German to En-
glish translation task. We use the same 20K byte-
pair encoding subword units in all toolkits (Sen-

nrich et al., 2015). We also use Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014) in all cases. The learning rate
scheduling is also similar. In RETURNN, we use
a 6 layer bidirectional encoder, trained with pre-
training and label smoothing. It has bidirectional
LSTMs in every layer of the encoder, unlike Sock-
eye, which only has the first layer bidirectional.
We use a variant of attention weight / fertility feed-
back (Tu et al., 2016), which is inverse in our case,
to use a multiplication instead of a division, for
better numerical stability. Our model was derived
from the model presented by (Bahar et al., 2017;
Peter et al., 2017) and (Bahdanau et al., 2014).

We report the best performing Sockeye model
we trained, which has 1 bidirectional and 3 unidi-
rectional encoder layers, 1 pre-attention target re-
current layer, and 1 post-attention decoder layer.
We trained with a max sequence length of 75,
and used the ‘coverage’ RNN attention type. For
Sockeye, the final model is an average of the 4
best runs according to the development perplex-
ity. The results are collected in Table 3. We obtain
the best results with Sockeye using a Transformer
network model (Vaswani et al., 2017), where we
achieve 32.0% BLEU on newstest2017. So far,
RETURNN does not support this architecture; see
Section 7 for details.

Table 3: Comparison on German→English.

We compare RETURNN to other toolkits on
the WMT 2017 English→German translation task
in Table 4. We observe that our toolkit outper-
forms all other toolkits. The best result obtained
by other toolkits is using Marian (25.5% BLEU).
In comparison, RETURNN achieves 26.1%. We
also compare RETURNN to the best performing
single systems of WMT 2017. In comparison to
the fine-tuned evaluation systems that also include
back-translated data, our model performs worse by
only 0.3 to 0.9 BLEU. We did not run experiments
with back-translated data, which can potentially
boost the performance by several BLEU points.

We also have preliminary results with recur-
rent attention models for speech recognition on
the Switchboard task, which we trained on the
300h trainset. We report on both the Switch-
board (SWB) and the CallHome (CH) part of
Hub5’00 and Hub5’01. We also compare to a con-
ventional frame-wise trained hybrid deep bidirec-

and a generalized full-sum sequence trained hy-
brid deep bidirectional LSTM with 5 layers (Zeyer
et al., 2017a). The frame-wise trained hybrid
model also uses focal loss (Lin et al., 2017). All
the hybrid models use a phonetic lexicon and
an external 4-gram language model which was
trained on the transcripts of both the Switchboard
and the Fisher corpus. The attention model does
not use any external language model nor a pho-
netic lexicon. Its output labels are byte-pair en-
coded subword units (Sennrich et al., 2015). It has
a 6 layer bidirectional encoder, which also applies
max-pooling in the time dimension, i.e. it reduces
the input sequence by factor 8. Pretraining as ex-
plained in Section 6 was applied. To our knowl-
edge, this is the best reported result for an end-to-
end system on Switchboard 300h without using a
language model or the lexicon. For comparison,
we also selected comparable results from the lit-
erature. From these, the Baidu DeepSpeech CTC
model is modeled on characters and does not use
the lexicon but it does use a language model. The
results are collected in Table 5.

2017; Edunov et al., 2017). The results are still
preliminary but promising. We do the approxima-
tion by beam search with beam size 4. For a 4
layer encoder network model, with forced align-
ment cross entropy training, we get 30.3% BLEU,
and when we use maximum expected BLEU train-
ing, we get 31.1% BLEU.

6 Pretraining

RETURNN supports very generic and flexible
pretraining which iteratively starts with a small
model and adds new layers in the process. A
similar pretraining scheme for deep bidirectional
LSTMs acoustic speech models was presented ear-
lier (Zeyer et al., 2017b). Here, we only study a
layer-wise construction of the deep bidirectional
LSTM encoder network of an encoder-decoder-
attention model for translation on the WMT 2017
German→English task. Experimental results are
presented in Table 6. The observations very
clearly match our expectations, that we can both
greatly improve the overall performance, and we
are able to train deeper models. A minor benefit is
faster training speed of the initial pretrain epochs.

Table 6: Pretraining comparison.

In preliminary recurrent attention experiments
for speech recognition, pretraining seems very es-
sential to get good performance.

Also, we use in all cases a learning rate schedul-
ing scheme, which lowers the learning rate if the
cross validation score does not improve enough.
Without pretraining and a 2 layer encoder in the
same setting as above, with a fixed learning rate,
we get 28.4% BLEU, where-as with learning rate
scheduling, we get 29.3% BLEU.

7 RETURNN features

Besides the fast speed, and the many features such
as pretraining, scheduled sampling (Bengio et al.,
2015), label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016), and
the ability to train state-of-the-art models, one of
the greatest strengths of RETURNN is its flexibil-
ity. The definition of the recurrent dependencies
and the whole model architecture are provided in
a very explicit way via a config file. Thus, e.g. try-
ing out a new kind of attention scheme, adding a
new latent variable to the search space, or drasti-
cally changing the whole architecture, is all sup-
ported already and does not need any more im-
plementation in RETURNN. All that can be ex-
pressed by the neural network definition in the
config. A (simplified) example of a network defi-
nition is given in Listing 1.

Each layer in this definition does some com-
putation, specified via the class attribute, and
gets its input from other layers via the from at-
tribute, or from the input data, in case of layer
src. The output layer defines a whole subnet-
work, which can make use of recurrent dependen-
cies via a prev: prefix. Depending on whether
training or decoding is done, the choice layer
class would return the true labels or the predicted
labels. In case of scheduled sampling or max
BLEU training, we can also use the predicted label
during training. Depending on this configuration,
during compilation of the computation graph, RE-
TURNN figures out that certain calculations can
be moved out of the recurrent loop. This automatic
optimization also adds to the speedup. This flexi-
bility and ease of trying out new architectures and
models allow for a very efficient development / re-
search feedback loop. Fast, consistent and robust
feedback greatly helps the productivity and qual-
ity. This is very different to other toolkits which
only support a predefined set of architectures.

To summarize the features of RETURNN:
• flexibility (see above),
• generality, wide range of models and appli-

cations, such as hybrid acoustic speech mod-
els, language models and attention models
for translation and speech recognition,

• fast CUDA LSTM kernels,
• attention models, generic recurrent layer, fast

beam search decoder,
• sequence training (min WER, max BLEU),
• label smoothing, scheduled sampling,
• TensorFlow backend and the old Theano

backend, which has a separate fast atten-
tion implementation (Doetsch et al., 2016),
fast CUDA MDLSTM kernels (Voigtlaender
et al., 2016), as well as fast sequence training
(Zeyer et al., 2017c).

One feature which is currently work-in-progress
is the support for self-attention in the recurrent
layer. The reason this needs some more work is
because we currently only support access to the
previous time step (prev:) but not to the whole
past, which is needed for self-attention. That is
why we did not present any Transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017) comparisons yet.

8 Conclusion

We have demonstrated many promising features of
RETURNN and presented state-of-the-art systems
in translation and speech recognition. We argue
that it is a convenient testbed for research and ap-
plications. We introduced pretraining for recurrent
attention models and showed its advantages while
not having any disadvantages. Maximum expected
BLEU training seems to be promising.
