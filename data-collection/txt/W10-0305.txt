Abstract 

This paper presents our on-going work to 

improve the lyric generation component of 

the Automatic Lyric Generation system for 

the Tamil Language. An earlier version of 

the system used an n-gram based model to 

generate lyrics that match the given melody. 

This paper identifies some of the deficien-

cies in the melody analysis and text genera-

tion components of the earlier system and 

explains the new approach used to tackle 

those drawbacks. The two central approach-

es discussed in this paper are: (1) An im-

proved mapping scheme for matching melo-

dy with words and (2) Knowledge-based 

Text Generation algorithm based on an ex-

isting Ontology and Tamil Morphology Ge-

nerator. 

1 Introduction 

In an attempt to define poetry (Manurung, 2004), 

provides three properties for a natural language 

artifact to be considered a poetic work, viz., Mea-

ningfulness (M), Grammaticality (G) and Poetic-

ness (P). A complete poetry generation system 

must generate texts that adhere to all the three 

properties. (Ananth et. al., 2009) explains an ap-

proach for automatically generating Tamil lyrics, 

given a melody, which attempts to generate mea-

ningful lyrics that match the melody.  

The existing approach (Ananth et. al., 2009) to au-

tomatically generate Tamil lyrics that match the 

given tune in ABC format (Gonzato, 2003) in-
volves two steps. The first step is to analyze the 

input melody and output a series of possible sylla-

ble patterns in KNM representation scheme - a 
scheme for representing all words in the language, 

where, K stands for Kuril ((C)V, where V is a 

short vowel), N stands for Nedil ((C)V, where V is 

a long vowel) and M stands for Mei or Ottru (con-
sonants) - that match the given melody, along with 

tentative word and sentence boundary. This melo-

dy analysis system was trained with sample film 

songs and their corresponding lyrics collected from 

the web. The tunes were converted to ABC Nota-

tion (Gonzato, 2003) and their lyrics were 

represented in KNM scheme. The trained model 
was then used to label the given input melody. 

The subsequent step uses a Sentence Generator 

module to generate lines that match the given syl-

lable pattern with words satisfying the following 

constraints: a) Words should match the syllable 

pattern and b) The sequence of words should have 

a meaning. This was achieved by using n-Gram 

models learnt from a Tamil text corpus.  

Though the system manages to generate sentences 

that match the syllable pattern, it has the following 

limitations: 

1) When no words are found matching a given 

syllable pattern, alternate patterns that are 

close to the given pattern, as suggested by the 

Edit Distance Algorithm, are considered. This 

algorithm treats the syllable patterns as strings 

for finding close patterns and hence, can pro-

vide choices that do not agree with the input 

melody. 

2) The Sentence Generation is based on the n-

Gram model learnt from a text corpus. This 

can result in sentences that do not have a cohe-

rent meaning. Also, since only bi-grams are 

considered, it can generate sentences that are 

ungrammatical due to Person-Number-Gender 

(PNG) agreement issues. 

This paper is an attempt to propose alternate ap-

proaches in order to overcome the above limita-

tions.

2 Limitations of existing approach 

2.1 Finding close matches to syllable patterns 

In the existing system, when no words are found 

matching the given syllable pattern (either due to a 

small corpus or rarity of the pattern), the closest 

patterns are considered as alternatives. The closest 

match to a given syllable pattern is generated based 

on the Edit Distance algorithm. For example, if the 

input sequence is given as "NKN" (long vowel - 
short vowel - long vowel) and if no words are 

found matching NKN, closest matches for NKN 

are generated. Thus, if an edit distance of 1 is con-

sidered, the alternate pattern choices are "KKN", 

"NKM", "NNN", "NMN", etc. However, not all of 

these syllable patterns can fit the original music 

notes. 

As an example, consider the Tamil word “thA-ma-
rai” (lotus) that fits the pattern NKN. Suppose no 

words that match the pattern NKN was present in 

the corpus and other close patterns were opted for, 

we get: 

Pat. Word Meaning Match 

KKN tha-va-Lai Frog No match 

NKM thA-ba-m Longing No match 

NNN kO-sA-lai Cow Hut Close Match 

NMN pA-p-pA Child No match 
Table 1. Alternative patterns for “NKN” 

None of the above words can be used in the place 

of “thA-ma-rai”, a good fit for a NKN pattern, as 
they don’t phonetically match (except for a close-
but-not-exact “kO-sA-lai”) and hence cannot be 

used as part of the lyric without affecting the in-

tended melody.  

2.2 Ungrammatical or meaningless genera-

tion 

The Sentence Generation algorithm was based on 

the n-Gram model built from a text corpus. Given 

that n-Gram based generation schemes have in-

built bias towards shorter strings, it can end-up 

generating meaningless and ungrammatical sen-

tences. As observed in (Ananth et.al., 2009), we 

can get sentences such as: 

(* avan-He-3sm  nadandhu-walk sendrAlY-3sf) 

(He reached by walking) 

Here, the subject avan (He), which is a 3rd person, 

singular, masculine noun, does not agree with the 

verb sendrAlY , which is 3rd person, singular, femi-
nine. Thus, the noun and the verb do not agree on 

the gender. The correct sentence should be: 

(avan-3sm nadandhu sendrAn-3sm) 

This is happening because the bi-gram score for 

could be greater than 

. 

Similar disagreements can happen for other aspects 

such as person or number. Though performing a 

joint probability across words would help in reduc-

ing such errors, it would slow down the generation 

process. 

In addition to the above ungrammatical generation 

problem, the system can also generate meaningless 

sentences. Though, some of them can be consi-

dered as a poetic license, most of them were just 
non-sensical. For example, consider the following 

sentence generated by the n-Gram sentence genera-

tion system: 

(adhu-that idhu-this en-my) 

(that this my) 

The above sentence does not convey any coherent 

meaning. 

2.3 Ability to control theme/choice of words 

Given the nature of the Sentence generation algo-

rithm, it is not possible for the program to hand-

pick specific words and phrases. That is, the whole 

generation process is guided by the probability 

values and hence it is not possible to bias the algo-

rithm to produce utterances belonging to a particu-

lar theme.  

In the subsequent sections, we explain the alterna-

tive approaches to tackle the above limitations.

3 Closest Syllable Patterns 

The existing approach uses the KNM Notation for 

representing all words in the language. This pho-

netic representation is at the most basic level, i.e., 

alphabets, and hence can be used to represent all 

words in the language. The KNM notation is gen-
erated by the melody analyzer and is used through-

out the system for generating sentences. Though 

this representation scheme is at the most basic lev-

el, it does not help in cases where we are looking 

for alternate or close matches. Thus, we need to 

come up with a representation scheme at a higher 

level of abstraction that will help us in providing 

valid choices without compromising the require-

ments of the melody. To this end, we hereby pro-

pose to use elements from classic poetry metric 

rules in Tamil Grammar (Bala et. al., 2003) as de-

fined in the oldest Tamil Grammar work, Tholkap-

piyam (Tholkappiyar, 5th Century B.C.). 

3.1 Meter in classical Tamil Poetry  

Meter is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse and 

the basic term that refers to Tamil meter is pA. 

Each line in the poem is called an adi, which, in 
turn, is made up of a certain number of metrical 

feet known as the ceer (words/tokens). Each ceer

is composed of a certain metrical units called asai
(syllables) which are made up of letters (vowels 

and consonants) that have certain intrinsic 

length/duration, known as mAthirai. The above 
entities are known as the core structural compo-

nents of a Tamil poem (Rajam, 1992)  

The basic metrical unit asai is mostly based on 
vowel length. There are two basic types of asai: 

nEr asai (straightness) and niRai asai (in a row; 
array). The nEr asai has the pattern (C)V(C)(C)
and niRai asai, (C)VCV(C)(C). These longest-

matching basic asai patterns are expanded to 
represent non-monosyllabic words, but for our 

needs, we use these two basic asai patterns for the 

new representation scheme. 

3.2 asai-based Representation Scheme  

In the new representation scheme, the constituents 

of the KNM representation scheme are converted 

to nEr or niRai asai before being sent to the Sen-
tence Generator module. The Sentence Generator 

module, in turn, makes use of this new representa-

tion scheme for picking words as well as for find-

ing alternatives. In this new representation scheme, 

a nEr asai is represented as Ne and a niRai asai is 
represented as Ni. 

The following table illustrates the mapping re-

quired for converting between the two representa-

tion schemes: 

KNM Representation asai representation 

K Ne 

KM(0….2) Ne 

N Ne 

NM(0…2) Ne 

KK Ni 

KKM(0…2) Ni 

KN Ni 

KNM(0…2) Ni 
Table 2. KNM to asai representation 

For example, an output line such as, for example, 

“KK  KK  KKK” in the old representation scheme 

will be converted as “Ni  Ni  NiNe” in the new re-

presentation based on asai. This means that the 
line should contain three ceer(words/tokens) and 
the first word should be a nirai asai, second word 

should be a nirai asai and the third word contains 
two syllables with a nirai asai followed by nEr 
asai. 

This new representation scheme helps in coming 

up with alternatives without affecting the metrical 

needs of the melody as the alternatives have the 

same mAthirai (length/duration). Thus, if we are 
given a pattern such as “NiNe”, we have several 

valid choices such as “KKK” (originally given), 

“KKMK”, “KKMKM”, “KKN”, “KKMN” and 

“KKMNM”. We can use words that match any of 

the above patterns without compromising the dura-

tion imposed by the original music note. This way 

of choosing alternatives is much better than using 

the Edit Distance algorithm as it is based on the 

original meter requirements as against matching 

string patterns. 

To use the previous example of “thA-ma-rai” (lo-
tus) (NKN) in this new representation scheme, we 
get, “NeNi” and all the following words will 

match: 

33



Word KNM scheme 

nE-ra-lai (straight wave) NKN 

Sa-nj-nja-la-m (doubt) KMKKM 

Ma-ng-ka-la-m (auspicious) KMKKM 

a-m-bi-kai (goddess) KMKN 

vE-ng-ka-ta-m (Venkatam – a 
name) 

NMKKM 

Table 3. NKN alternatives using asai representation 

The above (valid) choices such as KMKKM, 

NMKKM, etc. are not possible with just using the 

Edit Distance algorithm. Thus, the architecture of 

the system now consists of a new component for 

this conversion (Figure 1) 

Figure 1. System Approach with new ASAI converter 

4 Knowledge-based Sentence Generation 

The goal of the Sentence Generation module is to 

generate sentences matching the input pattern giv-

en in the new asai representation scheme. The ex-

isting system generated sentences based on the n-

Gram language model created from a text corpus 

of poems and film songs. However, as explained 

earlier, this can result in ungrammatical or mea-

ningless sentences being generated. In order to 

overcome this limitation, the Sentence Generation 

module is completely overhauled using a know-

ledge-based approach. A Tamil Morphology gene-

rator component, built in-house, is used to generate 

grammatically correct sentences from this know-

ledge base. 

4.1 Knowledge Base 

The knowledge base consists of: (a) set of verbs 

along with their selectional restriction rules (b) 

hand-coded sub-categorization Ontology with 

nouns and (c) list of adjectives and adverbs learned 

from a text corpus.  

4.1.1 Verbs and Selectional Restrictions 

Selectional restriction is defined as the right of the 

verb to select its arguments. Verb is the nucleus of 

a sentence and has the nature of choosing its argu-

ments. Any particular verb can take its arguments 

only according to its selectional restriction con-

straints. When these constraints are violated, the 

meaning of the sentence is affected. This violation 

of selectional restriction rules may lead to semanti-

cally wrong sentences or figurative usages. Cor-

rectness of a sentence not only depends on the syn-

tactic correctness, but also with the semantic inter-

pretation of the sentence. 

4.1.2 Syntactic Classification 

Verbs can be broadly classified into three divi-

sions, viz., monadic, dyadic and triadic verbs.   

Monadic verbs can have only one argument - the 

subject. Dyadic verbs can have two arguments -

subject and object. Triadic verbs can take three 

arguments - subject, direct and indirect objects. 

But there is no strict rule that the triadic verbs 

should have all three arguments or the dyadic verbs 

should have the two arguments filled. There can be 

overlaps between these groups of verbs. Triadic 

verb can drop the indirect object and have a Prepo-

sitional Phrase (PP) attached with the sentence. 

Dyadic verb can drop the object and still give a 

valid sentence. The verbs are grouped according to 

the sub-categorization information of the subject 

and object nouns. The sub-categorization features 

are explained in the following section. At present, 

we are using only Monadic and Dyadic verbs for 

our sentence generation purposes. 

4.1.3 Sub-Categorization 

Sub-categorization features explain the nature of 

the noun. The subject and object nouns are ana-

34



lyzed using these features. These features may in-

clude the type of noun, its characteristics, state etc. 

Sub-categorization information includes the fea-

tures such as [±animate], [±concrete], [±edible] 

etc.  

Some of the features and the meanings are listed 

below: 

[+animate] All animals, human beings 

[+human] All human beings 

[+female] Animals/human beings of 

feminine gender 

[+solid] Things that are in solid state 

[+vehicle] All vehicles 

[+concrete] Things that physically exist 

[-concrete] Things that do not physically 

exist 

[+edible] Things that can be eaten 

[-edible] Things that cannot be eaten 

[+movable] Things that are movable 

[-movable] Things that are not movable 
Table 4. Sub-categorization Features 

4.1.4 Ontology of Nouns 

The sub-categorization features are used in the 

formulation of general Ontology of Nouns. It is 

made with respect to the usage of language. The 

Ontology that is developed has the following sa-

lient features: 

• It is a language-based Ontology originally 

developed for English and has been cus-

tomized for Tamil 

• Nodes in the Ontology are the actual sub-

categorization features of Nouns 

• It is made according to the use of nouns in 

the Tamil language 

• Each node will have a list of nouns as en-

tries for that node 

The complete Ontology can be found in (Arulmoz-

hi, et. al., 2006) 

4.1.5 Contents of Knowledge Base 

At present, the knowledge-base consists of 116 

unique verbs, 373 selectional restriction rules and 

771 Nouns in the Ontology. 

The verbs list includes both cognitive as well as 

non-cognitive verbs. Examples of verbs include 

pAr (to see), kelY (to listen), vA (to come), thEtu
(to search), piti (to catch), po (to go), kal (to learn), 

etc. 

The selectional restriction rules are stored as fol-

lows: 

Verb=>subject_category;subject_case=>object_c

ategory;object_case. 

When a verb does not take any object, the keyword 

[no_obj] is used to denote the same. In addition to 
the subject and object categories, the rule also con-

tains the appropriate case markers to be used for 

the subject and object nouns. This additional in-

formation is stored for use by the Morph Genera-

tion component. 

Some examples of selectional restriction rules are 

given below: 

pAr=>[+living,+animate,+vertebrate,+mammal,
+human];NOM=>[no_obj]  

pAr=>[+living,+animate,+vertebrate,+mammal,
+human];NOM=> 
[+living,+animate,+vertebrate,+mammal,+human

];ACC 

pi-

ti=>[+living,+animate,+vertebrate,+mammal,+h
uman];NOM=>[living,+concrete,+movable,+artif
act,+solid,+instrument,-

vehicle,+implements];NOM 

pi-

ti=>[+living,+animate,+vertebrate,+mammal,+h
uman];NOM=>[no_obj]  

Here, ACC, NOM, DAT, etc. denote the case mark-
ers to be used for the subject and object nouns. 

The 771 Nouns are stored across several files ac-

cording to their position in the Ontology. An On-

tology map is used to determine the list of nouns 

present in a particular node position. 

35



4.1.6 Adjectives and Adverbs 

In addition to the verbs and nouns mentioned 

above, the knowledge-base also contains a list of 

adjective-noun and adverb-verb bi-grams learnt 

from a text corpus. This information is used to 

augment the Sentence Generator with words from 

these POS categories.  

4.2 Tamil Morphological Generator 

Tamil is a densely agglutinative language and dis-

plays a unique structural formation of words by the 

addition of suffixes representing various senses or 

grammatical categories, to the roots or stems. The 

senses such as person, number, gender and case are 

linked to a noun root in an orderly fashion. The 

verbal categories such as transitive, causative, 

tense and person, number and gender are added to 

a verbal root or stem. Thus, with the given know-

ledge-base and a Tamil Morphological generator 

component one can generate grammatically correct 

sentences. 

We use the Tamil Morphological Generator com-

ponent (Menaka et. al., 2010) to generate inflec-

tions of subject/object nouns with appropriate 

number & case and the verbs with person, number 

and gender suffixes.  

4.3 Sentence Generation 

Given a line in asai representation scheme, the 

sentence generation module is responsible for ge-

nerating a grammatically correct and meaningful 

sentence matching the given asai scheme. It 

achieves the same by using the knowledge-base 

along with the Tamil Morphology Generator com-

ponent (Figure 2). In addition to the asai represen-

tation, the module also accepts the tense in which 

the sentence must be written. The rest of the para-

meters such as person, gender and case are auto-

matically deduced by the module.  

Figure 2. Sentence Generator module 

The algorithm for generating a matching sentence 

is as follows: 

1. Pick a selectional restriction rule, R in random

2. For each noun, SUB_N in subject_category of 

rule, R: 

2.1 Guess the gender for SUB_N based on sub-

ject_category 

2.2 For each noun, OBJ_N in object_category: 

2.2.1 Use Morphology Generator component 

to get morphed nouns & verbs based on tense, per-

son, gender and case. 

2.2.2 Generate sentences of the form [SUB_N] 

[OBJ_N] [VERB]  

2.2.3 Add adjectives or adverbs, if needed 

2.2.4 Repeat words, if needed 

2.2.4 Add to list of sentences generated  

  

3. Check the list of sentences against the asai pat-
tern. If matches, return sentence. Otherwise, go to 

step 1. 

Table 5. Sentence Generation Algorithm 

36



Details about steps such as matching against asai
pattern, gender identification, word repetition and 

adding adjectives/adverbs are explained below. 

4.3.1 Matching against asai pattern 

The list of sentences generated from the module 

are compared against the given asai pattern. The 

matching could either be an exact match or a re-

ordered match. That is, since Tamil is a relatively 

free word-order language, the generated sentence 

can also be re-ordered, if required, to match the 

given asai pattern. However, when adjectives or 
adverbs are added to the sentence, they need to 

maintain their position in front of the noun or verb 

respectively and hence they are not re-ordered. For 

now, we do not weight the sentences and hence 

return the first matching sentence. 

4.3.2 Gender Identification 

As noted in the algorithm, the gender needs to be 

automatically guessed. In Tamil, the gender of the 

subject is denoted by the appropriate suffix in the 

verb. If a personal pro-noun such as nAnY (I) or nI
(you) is used as subject, then any of masculine or 

feminine gender can be used without affecting the 

grammatical correctness of the verb. In this case, 

the program uses the default value of masculine 

gender. If the subject is not a personal pronoun, the 

gender for the verb is guessed based on the sub-

ject_category of the subject noun. If the sub-

ject_category explicitly mentions [+human, 

+living, +female,…], then feminine gender is re-

turned. If the subject_category explicitly mentions 

[+human, +living, -female,…], then masculine 

gender is returned. Otherwise, if [+human, 

+living,…] is present, but there is no explicit men-

tion of +female or –female, it defaults to honorific 

suffix. In all other cases, neuter gender is returned.  

4.3.3 Adding adjectives and adverbs 

The Sentence Generator module using the selec-

tional restriction rules can only create sentences of 

the form “[subject] [object] [verb]”. However, 
typical lyrics will not always contain just three 

word sentences and thus, the ability to put more 

words in a sentence generated by our system is 

required. In such cases, a look-up list of adjectives 

and adverbs is used for filling the additional words 

required by the syllable pattern. This look-up list is 

generated from a POS-tagged text corpus from 

which the list of adjective-noun, adverb-verb bi-

grams are added to the look-up list. Whenever a 

sentence needs more than three words, this look-up 

list is consulted to generate sentences that add the 

relevant adjectives to subject or object nouns and 

relevant adverbs before the verb. Each possible 

combination of such sentences is generated and 

added to the list of sentences.   

4.3.4 Word repetition 

An additional approach to handle lines with more 

than three words is to repeat certain words already 

present in the “[subject] [object] [verb]” output. If 
an adjective or adverb is already added to the sen-

tence, then preference for repetition is given to the 

adjective/adverb subject to the constraints of the 

input asai scheme. Otherwise, the verb is chosen 
for repetition. Finally, the subject and object nouns 

are considered.  

5 Experiments 

The goal of the experiment was to validate whether 

the sentences generated using the Knowledge-

based approach are more grammatical and mea-

ningful than the n-Gram approach. In order to test 

this hypothesis, a set of 10 syllable patterns was 

given to the old n-Gram system and 30 sentences 

were generated from them. The new knowledge-

based approach was also given the syllable patterns 

and the resulting 32 sentences were collected. In 

order to avoid any bias, these 62 sentences were 

interleaved in a single document and this document 

was given to five human evaluators for scoring 

each sentence. The scoring methodology is as fol-

lows: 

Score Meaning 

1 Incorrect 

2 Grammatically perfect, but no mean-

ing at all 

3 Grammatically correct but only par-

tially meaningful 

4 Both Grammar and Meaning are only 

partially correct 

5 Perfect 
Table 6. Scoring methodology 

Based on the scores given by the human evalua-

tors, the sentences generated using the n-Gram ap-

37



proach scored an average of 2.06, whereas the sen-

tences generated using the knowledge-based ap-

proach scored an average of 4.13. This clearly de-

monstrates that the new approach results in consis-

tently more grammatical and meaningful sen-

tences.  

A break-down of statistics based on the scores giv-

en by each evaluator is given below (Table 7):

A subset of syllable patterns given to the system 

and the sentences generated by the system are giv-

en below: 

Input NM KKMKMKMK 

KMNM 

Intermediate Form Ne NiNeNeNe NeNe 

Sentences 

(nAm-we arangathukku-stadium  vanthOm-came) 
(We came to the stadium) 

(nee-You siraichAlaikku-prison vanthAi-came) 

(You came to the prison) 

Input NN KKNN NMNM 

Intermediate Form NeNe NiNeNe NeNe 

Sentences 

(* rAjA-King  nadanathai-dance  kEttAr-listen) 

(The King listened to the dance) 

(neengal-You  piditheergal-caught  kaiyai-hand) 
(You caught the hand) 

Here, the sentence “rAjA-King  nadanathai-dance  

kEttAr-listened” (The King listened to the dance) is  
generated due to the fact that the noun dance is 
taken from the Ontology node “content” that also 

contains nouns for music, drama, etc. for which the 
verb listen matches perfectly. Thus, this semanti-
cally meaningless sentence is generated due to the 

present sub-categorization levels of the nouns On-

tology. In addition to this, Ontology based genera-

tion can also create semantically meaningless sen-

tences when a verb has more than one sense and 

the appropriate sense is not taken into considera-

tion. 

The next sentence “neengal-You  piditheergal-
caught  kaiyai-hand” (You caught the hand) is an 
example of a sentence in which the verb and object 

noun were re-ordered to match the input pattern. 

6 Limitations and Future Work  

From the initial set of experiments, we see that the 

knowledge-based approach results in generating 

grammatically correct and mostly meaningful sen-

tences. Also, unlike the Edit Distance algorithm, 

the new asai representation scheme consistently 
provides valid choices and alternatives for syllable 

patterns, thus resulting in better coverage. 

We are also currently working on introducing co-

hesion across multiple lines of the verse by (a) 

grouping related verbs, (b) using semantically re-

lated verbs (such as Synonym, Antonym, Hy-

ponym, etc.) from previous sentences and (c) pick-

ing rules that can result in using the same subject 

or object. 

The main drawback of the current knowledge-

based approach is the lack of poetic sentences and 

hence the poetic aspect of the verse needs im-

provement. Although we attempt to introduce 

structural poeticness by rhyme and repetition, the 

content aspect of the poem remains a bottleneck 

given our approach of using selectional restriction 

rules that does not lend well for figurative sen-

tences.
