Abstract 

Myanmar language and script are unique and 

complex. Up to our knowledge, considerable 

amount of work has not yet been done in 

describing Myanmar script using formal language 

theory. This paper presents manually constructed 

context free grammar (CFG) with “111” 

productions to describe the Myanmar Syllable 

Structure. We make our CFG in conformity with 

the properties of LL(1) grammar so that we can 

apply conventional parsing technique called 

predictive top-down parsing to identify Myanmar 

syllables. We present Myanmar syllable structure 

according to orthographic rules. We also discuss 

the preprocessing step called contraction for 

vowels and consonant conjuncts. We make LL (1) 

grammar in which “1” does not mean exactly one 

character of lookahead for parsing because of the 

above mentioned contracted forms. We use five 

basic sub syllabic elements to construct CFG and 

found that all possible syllable combinations in 

Myanmar Orthography can be parsed correctly 

using the proposed grammar.  
 

1 Introduction 

Formal Language Theory is a common way to 

represent grammatical structures of natural 

languages and programming languages. The 

origin of grammar hierarchy is the pioneering 

work of Noam Chomsky (Noam Chomsky, 

1957). A huge amount of work has been done in 

Natural Language Processing where Chomsky`s 

grammar is used to describe the grammatical 

rules of natural languages. However, formulation 

rules have not been established for grammar for 

Myanmar script. The long term goal of this study 

is to develop automatic syllabification of 

Myanmar polysyllabic words using regular 

grammar and/or finite state methods so that 

syllabified strings can be used for Myanmar 

sorting.   

In this paper, as a preliminary stage, we describe 

the structure of a Myanmar syllable in context-

free grammar and parse the syllables using 

predictive top-down parsing technique to 

determine whether a given syllable can be 

recognized by the proposed grammar or not. 

Further, the constructed grammar includes 

linguistic information and follows the traditional 

writing system of Myanmar script.       

 

2 Myanmar Script 

Myanmar is a syllabic script and also one of the 

languages which have complex orthographic 

structures. Myanmar words are formed by 

collection of syllables and each syllable may 

contain up to seven different sub syllabic 

elements. Again, each component group has its 

own members having specific order.  

Basically, Myanmar script has 33 consonants, 8 

vowels (free standing and attached)
1
 , 2 diacritics, 

11 medials, a vowel killer or ASAT, 10 digits 

and 2 punctuation marks.  

A Myanmar syllable consists of 7 different 

components in Backus Normal Form (BNF) is as 

follows. 

S:= C{M}{V}[CK][D] | I[CK] | N 

where   

   S   = Syllable 

1. C  = Consonant                                          
2. M = Medial or Consonant Conjunct or 

attached consonant

 Free standing vowel syllables (eg. ဣ )and attached vowel 

symbols (eg.   ) 

32



3. V = Attached Vowel 
4. K = Vowel Killer or ASAT 
5. D = Diacritic 
6. I  = Free standing Vowel 
7. N =  Digit 

And the notation [ ] means 0 or 1 occurrence and 

{ } means 0 or more occurrence.  

However, in this paper, we ignore digits, free 

standing vowel and punctuation marks in writing 

grammar for Myanmar syllable and we focus 

only on basic and major five sub syllabic groups 

namely consonants(C), medial(M), attached 

vowels(V), a vowel killer (K) and diacritics(D). 

The following subsection will give the details of 

each sub syllabic group.  
 

2.1 Brief Description of Basic Myanmar 

Sub Syllabic Elements 

 

Each Myanmar consonant has default vowel 

sound and itself works as a syllable. The set of 

consonants in Unicode chart is C={က, ခ, ဂ, ဃ, 

င, စ, ဆ, ဇ, ဈ, ဉ , ည ,ဋ ,ဌ, ဍ, ⁠ဎ, ဏ, တ, 

ထ ,ဒ ,ဓ ,န ,ပ ,ဖ, ဗ, ဘ ,မ ,ယ ,ရ, လ, ၀, သ, ဟ, 

ဠ } having 33 elements. But, the letter အ can act 
as consonant as well as free standing vowel.  

 

Medials or consonant conjuncts mean the 

modifiers of the syllables` vowel and they are 

encoded separately in the Unicode encoding. 

There are four basic medials in Unicode chart 

and it is represented as the set M={    ,   ,   }. 
 

The set V of Myanmar attached vowel characters 

in Unicode contains 8 elements { ါ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  
 ,  ,  }. ( Peter and William, 1996) 
 

Diacritics alter the vowel sounds of 

accompanying consonants and they are used to 

indicate tone level. There are 2 diacritical marks 

{  ,   } in Myanmar script and the set is 
represented as D.  

 

The asat, or  killer, representing the set K= {   } 
is a visibly displayed sign. In some cases it 

indicates that the inherent vowel sound of a 

consonant letter is suppressed. In other cases it 

combines with other characters to form a vowel 

letter. Regardless of its function, this visible sign 

is always represented by the character U+103A .

[John Okell, 1994] 

 

In Unicode chart, the diacritics group D and the 

vowel killer or ASAT “K” are included in the 

group named various signs. 

 

2.2  Preprocessing of Texts - Contraction 

 

In writing formal grammar for a Myanmar 

syllable, there are some cases where two or more 

Myanmar characters combine each other and the 

resulting combined forms are also used in 

Myanmar traditional writing system though they 

are not coded directly in the Myanmar Unicode 

chart. Such combinations of vowel and medials 

are described in detail below. 

Two or more Myanmar attached vowels are 

combined and formed new three members {   , 

   ,     } in the vowel set.

Similarly, 4 basic Myanmar medials combine 

each other in some different ways and produce 

new set of medials {   ,   ,   ,   ,    ,     

  ,       }. [Tin Htay Hlaing and Yoshiki

2.3 Combinations of Syllabic Components 

within a Syllable 

 

As mentioned in the earlier sections, we choose 

only 5 basic sub syllabic components namely 

consonants (C), medial (M), attached vowels (V), 

vowel killer (K) and diacritics (D) to describe 

Myanmar syllable. As our intended use for 

syllabification is for sorting, we omit stand-alone 

vowels and digits in describing Myanmar 

syllable structure. Further, according to the 

sorting order of Myanmar Orthography, stand-

alone vowels are sorted as the syllable using the 

above 5 sub syllabic elements having the same 

pronunciation. For example, stand-alone vowel  

“ဣ” is sorted as consonant “အ” and attached 

vowel “ ” combination as  “အ ”. 

                                                           
3 Sorting order of Medials and attached vowels in Myanmar 

Orthography 

In Myanmar language, a syllable with only one 

consonant can be taken as one syllable because 

Myanmar script is Abugida which means all 

letters have inherent vowel. And, consonants can 

be followed by vowels, consonant, vowel killer 

and medials in different combinations.  

One special feature is that if there are two 

consonants in a given syllable, the second 

consonant must be followed by vowel killer (K). 

We found that 1872 combinations of sub-syllabic 

elements in Myanmar Orthography [Myanmar 

Language Commission, 2006]. The table below 

shows top level combinations of these sub-

syllabic elements.

“Table 4. Possible Combinations within a Syllable” 

 

The combinations among five basic sub syllabic 

components can also be described using Finite 

State Automaton. We also find that Myanmar 

orthographic syllable structure can be described 

in regular grammar.

In the above FSA, an interesting point is that 

only one consonant can be a syllable because 

Myanmar consonants have default vowel sounds. 

That is why, state 2 can be a final state. For 

instance, a Myanmar Word “မ န  မ” (means 
“Woman” in English) has two syllables. In the 

first syllable “မ န  ”, the sub syllabic elements are 

Consonant(မ) + Vowel( ) +Consonant(န)+ 

Vowel Killer( )+Diacritics( ). The second 

syllable has only one consonant “မ”. 
 

3 Myanmar Syllable Structure in      

Context-Free Grammar 
 
3.1 Manually Constructed Context-Free 

Grammar for Myanmar Syllable 

Structure 

 

Context free (CF) grammar refers to the grammar 

rules of languages which are formulated 

independently of any context. A CF-grammar is 

defined by: 

1. A finite terminal vocabulary VT. 

2. A finite auxiliary vocabulary VA. 

3. An axiom SVA. 

4. A finite number of context-free rules P 

of the form A where 

AVA and  {VA U VT}*                           

(M.Gross and A.Lentin, 1970) 

 

The grammar G to represent all possible 

structures of a Myanmar syllable can be written 

as G= (VT,VA,P,S) where the elements of  P are: 

Sက X     
# Such production will be expanded for 33 

consonants. 

X   A     
# Such production will be expanded for 11 

medials. 

X   B    
# Such production will be expanded for 12 

vowels. 

XC    D  
X 

A    B   
# Such production will be expanded for 12 

vowels. 

A C    D 
A 

B  C    D 
B D 

B 

D     # Diacritics 
D     # Diacritics 
D   

C က   
      # Such production will be expanded for 33 

consonants. 

Total number of productions/rules to recognize 

Myanmar syllable structure is “111” and we 

found that the director symbol sets (which is also 

known as first and follow sets) for same non-

terminal symbols with different productions are 

disjoint.   

This is the property of LL(1) grammar which 

means for each non terminal that appears on the 

left side of more than one production, the 

directory symbol sets of all the productions in 

which it appears on the left side are disjoint. 

Therefore, our proposed grammar can be said as 

LL(1) grammar.  

The term LL1 is made up as follows. The first L 

means reading from Left to right, the second L 

means using Leftmost derivations, and the “1” 

means with one symbol of lookahead. (Robin 

Hunter, 1999) 

 

3.2 Parse Table for Myanmar CFG

In the above table, the topmost row represents 

terminal symbols whereas the leftmost column 

represents the non terminal symbols. The entries 

in the table are productions to apply for each pair 

of non terminal and terminal. 

 

An example of Myanmar syllable having 4 

different sub syllabic elements is parsed using 

proposed grammar and the above parse table. 

The parsing steps show proper working of the 

proposed grammar and the detail of parsing a 

syllable is as follows.

      (D)

4 Conclusion 

 
This study shows the powerfulness of 

Chomsky`s context free grammar as it can apply 

not only to describe the sentence structure but 

also the syllable structure of an Asian script, 

Myanmar. Though the number of productions in 

the proposed grammar for Myanmar syllable is 

large, the syntactic structure of a Myanmar 

syllable is correctly recognized and the grammar 

is not ambiguous.  

Further, in parsing Myanmar syllable, it is 

necessary to do preprocessing called contraction 

for input sequences of vowels and consonant 

conjuncts or medials to meet the requirements of 

traditional writing systems. However, because of 

these contracted forms, single lookahead symbol 

in our proposed LL(1) grammar does not refer 

exactly to one character and it may be a 

combination of two or more characters in parsing 

Myanmar syllable. 

 

5 Discussion and Future Work 

 
Myanmar script is syllabic as well as 

aggulutinative script. Every Myanmar word or 

sentence is composed of series of individual 

syllables. Thus, it is critical to have efficient way 

of recognizing syllables in conformity with the 

rules of Myanmar traditional writing system. 

Our intended research is the automatic 

syllabification of Myanmar polysyllabic words 

using formal language theory. 

One option to do is to modify our current CFG to 

recognize consecutive syllables as a first step. 

We found that if the current CFG is changed for 

sequence of syllables, the grammar can be no 

longer LL(1). Then, we need to use one of the 

statistical methods, for example, probabilistic 

CFG, to choose correct productions or best parse 

for finding syllable boundaries. 

Again, it is necessary to calculate the probability 

values for each production based on the 

frequency of occurrence of a syllable in a 

dictionary we referred or using TreeBank.  

We need Myanmar corpus or a tree bank which 

contains evidence for rule expansions for syllable 

structure and such a resource does not yet exist 

for Myanmar. And also, the time and cost for 

constructing a corpus by ourselves came into 

consideration.  

Another approach is to construct finite state 

transducer for automatic syllabification of 

Myanmar words. If we choose this approach, we 

firstly need to construct regular grammar to 

recognize Myanmar syllables. We already have 

Myanmar syllable structure in regular grammar. 

However, for finite state syllabification using 

weights, there is a lack of resource for training 

database. 

We still have many language specific issues to be 

addressed for implementing Myanmar script 

using CFG or FSA. As a first issue, our current 

grammar is based on five basic sub-syllabic 

elements and thus developing the grammar 

which can handle all seven Myanmar sub 

syllabic elements will be future study.  

Our current grammar is based on the code point 

values of the input syllables or words. Then, as a 

second issue, we need to consider about different 

presentations or code point values of same 

character. Moreover, we have special writing 

traditions for some characters, for example, such 

36



as consonant stacking eg. ဗုဒ္ဓ (Buddha), မန ္တလေး 
(Mandalay, second capital of Myanmar), 

consonant repetition eg.  က       (University), 
kinzi eg. အင်္ဂ   (Cement), loan words eg. 
ဘတ်(စ်) (bus). To represent such complex forms 
in a computer system, we use invisible Virama 

sign (U+1039). Therefore, it is necessary to 

construct the productions which have conformity 

with the stored character code sequence of 

Myanmar Language.
