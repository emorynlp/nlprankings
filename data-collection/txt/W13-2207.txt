Abstract

We describe our experiments with
phrase-based machine translation for
the WMT 2013 Shared Task. We
trained one system for 18 translation
directions between English or Czech
on one side and English, Czech, Ger-
man, Spanish, French or Russian on
the other side. We describe a set of re-
sults with different training data sizes
and subsets. For the pairs containing
Russian, we describe a set of indepen-
dent experiments with slightly different
translation models.

1 Introduction
With so many official languages, Europe is
a paradise for machine translation research.
One of the largest bodies of electronically
available parallel texts is being nowadays gen-
erated by the European Union and its insti-
tutions. At the same time, the EU also pro-
vides motivation and boosts potential market
for machine translation outcomes.

Most of the major European languages be-
long to one of three branches of the Indo-
European language family: Germanic, Ro-
mance or Slavic. Such relatedness is respon-
sible for many structural similarities in Eu-
ropean languages, although significant differ-
ences still exist. Within the language portfo-
lio selected for the WMT shared task, English,
French and Spanish seem to be closer to each
other than to the rest.

German, despite being genetically related
to English, differs in many properties. Its
word order rules, shifting verbs from one

end of the sentence to the other, easily cre-
ate long-distance dependencies. Long Ger-
man compound words are notorious for in-
creasing out-of-vocabulary rate, which has
led many researchers to devising unsupervised
compound-splitting techniques. Also, upper-
case/lowercase distinction is more important
because all German nouns start with an up-
percase letter by the rule.

Czech is a language with rich morphology
(both inflectional and derivational) and rela-
tively free word order. In fact, the predicate-
argument structure, often encoded by fixed
word order in English, is usually captured by
inflection (especially the system of 7 grammat-
ical cases) in Czech. While the free word order
of Czech is a problem when translating to En-
glish (the text should be parsed first in order
to determine the syntactic functions and the
English word order), generating correct inflec-
tional affixes is indeed a challenge for English-
to-Czech systems. Furthermore, the multitude
of possible Czech word forms (at least order of
magnitude higher than in English) makes the
data sparseness problem really severe, hinder-
ing both directions.

Most of the above characteristics of Czech
also apply to Russian, another Slavic language.
Similar issues have to be expected when trans-
lating between Russian and English. Still,
there are also interesting divergences between
Russian and Czech, especially on the syntactic
level. Russian sentences typically omit cop-
ula in the present tense and there is also no
direct equivalent of the verb “to have”. Pe-
riphrastic constructions such as “there is XXX
by him” are used instead. These differences
make the Czech-Russian translation interest-

85



ing as well. Interestingly enough, results of
machine translation between Czech and Rus-
sian has so far been worse than between En-
glish and any of the two languages, language
relatedness notwithstanding.

Our goal is to run one system under as
similar conditions as possible to all eighteen
translation directions, to compare their trans-
lation accuracies and see why some directions
are easier than others. The current version of
the system does not include really language-
specific techniques: we neither split German
compounds, nor do we address the peculiari-
ties of Czech and Russian mentioned above.

In an independent set of experiments, we
tried to deal with the data sparseness of Rus-
sian language with the addition of a backoff
model with a simple stemming and some ad-
ditional data; those experiments were done for
Russian and Czech|English combinations.

2 The Translation System
Both sets of experiments use the same ba-
sic framework. The translation system is
built around Moses1 (Koehn et al., 2007).
Two-way word alignment was computed us-
ing GIZA++2 (Och and Ney, 2003), and
alignment symmetrization using the grow-
diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).
Weights of the system were optimized using
MERT (Och, 2003). No lexical reordering
model was trained.

For language modeling we use the SRILM
toolkit3 (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen
and Goodman, 1998).

3 General experiments
In the first set of experiments we wanted to
use the same setting for all language pairs.

3.1 Data and Pre-processing Pipeline
We applied our system to all the ten official
language pairs. In addition, we also exper-
imented with translation between Czech on
one side and German, Spanish, French or Rus-
sian on the other side. Training data for
these additional language pairs were obtained

1http://www.statmt.org/moses/
2http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/
3http://www-speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/

by combining parallel corpora of the officially
supported pairs. For instance, to create the
Czech-German parallel corpus, we identified
the intersection of the English sides of Czech-
English and English-German corpora, respec-
tively; then we combined the corresponding
Czech and German sentences.

We took part in the constrained task. Un-
less explicitly stated otherwise, the transla-
tion model in our experiments was trained on
the combined News-Commentary v8 and Eu-
roparl v7 corpora.4 Note that there is only
News Commentary and no Europarl for Rus-
sian. We were also able to evaluate several
combinations with large parallel corpora: the
UN corpus (English, French and Spanish),
the Giga French-English corpus and CzEng
(Czech-English). We did not use any large
corpus for Russian-English. Table 1 shows the
sizes of the training data.

639 codes: cs = Czech, de = German, en =
English, es = Spanish, fr = French, ru = Rus-
sian. Every line corresponds to the respective
version of EuroParl + News Commentary; the
second part presents the extra corpora.

The News Test 2010 (2489 sentences in
each language) and 2012 (3003 sentences)
data sets5 were used as development data for
MERT. BLEU scores reported in this paper
were computed on the News Test 2013 set

(3000 sentences each language). We do not
use the News Tests 2008, 2009 and 2011.

All parallel and monolingual corpora un-
derwent the same preprocessing. They were
tokenized and some characters normalized
or cleaned. A set of language-dependent
heuristics was applied in an attempt to re-
store the opening/closing quotation marks (i.e.
"quoted" → “quoted”) (Zeman, 2012).

The data are then tagged and lemmatized.
We used the Featurama tagger for Czech
and English lemmatization and TreeTagger for
German, Spanish, French and Russian lemma-
tization. All these tools are embedded in the
Treex analysis framework (Žabokrtský et al.,
2008).

The lemmas are used later to compute word
alignment. Besides, they are needed to ap-
ply “supervised truecasing” to the data: we
cast the case of the lemma to the form, rely-
ing on our morphological analyzers and tag-
gers to identify proper names, all other words
are lowercased. Note that guessing of the true
case is only needed for the sentence-initial to-
ken. Other words can typically be left in their
original form, unless they are uppercased as a
form of HIGHLIGHTING.

3.2 Experiments
BLEU scores were computed by our sys-
tem, comparing truecased tokenized hypoth-
esis with truecased tokenized reference trans-
lation. Such scores must differ from the official
evaluation—see Section 3.2.4 for discussion of
the final results.

The confidence interval for most of the
scores lies between ±0.5 and ±0.6 BLEU %
points.

3.2.1 Baseline Experiments
The set of baseline experiments were trained
on the supervised truecased combination of
News Commentary and Europarl. As we had
lemmatizers for the languages, word alignment
was computed on lemmas. (But our previous
experiments showed that there was little dif-
ference between using lemmas and lowercased
4-character “stems”.) A hexagram language
model was trained on the monolingual version
of the News Commentary + Europarl corpus
(typically a slightly larger superset of the tar-
get side of the parallel corpus).

3.2.2 Larger Monolingual Data

Besides the monolingual halves of the par-
allel corpora, additional monolingual data
were provided / permitted. Our experiments
in previous years clearly showed that the
Crawled News corpus (2007–2012), in-domain
and large, contributed significantly to better
BLEU scores. This year we included it in
our baseline experiments for all language pairs:
translation model on News Commentary +
Europarl, language model on monolingual part
of the two, plus Crawled News.

In addition there are the Gigaword corpora
published by the Linguistic Data Consortium,
available only for English (5th edition), Span-
ish (3rd) and French (3rd). Table 2 gives
the sizes and Table 3 compares BLEU scores
with Gigaword against the baseline. Gigaword
mainly contains texts from news agencies and
as such it should be also in-domain. Neverthe-
less, the crawled news are already so large that
the improvement contributed by Gigaword is
rarely significant.

ments (left column) on News Test 2013 data,
computed by the system on tokenized data,
versus similar setup with Gigaword. The dif-
ference was typically not significant.

3.2.3 Larger Parallel Data
Various combinations with larger parallel cor-
pora were also tested. We do not have results
for all combinations because these experiments
needed a lot of time and resources and not all
of them finished in time successfully.

In general the UN corpus seems to be of low
quality or too much off-domain. It may help
a little if used in combination with news-euro.
If used separately, it always hurts the results.

The Giga French-English corpus gave the
best results for English-French as expected,
even without the core news-euro data. How-
ever, training the model on data of this size is
extremely demanding on memory and time.

Finally, Czeng undoubtedly improves
Czech-English translation in both directions.
The news-euro dataset is smaller for this
language pair, which makes Czeng stand out
even more. See Table 4 for details.

tokenized hypothesis with truecased tokenized
reference translation.

The official evaluation by matrix.statmt.
org gives typically lower numbers, reflecting
the loss caused by detokenization and new
(different) tokenization.

3.2.5 Efficiency
The baseline experiments were conducted
mostly on 64bit AMD Opteron quad-core
2.8 GHz CPUs with 32 GB RAM (decoding
run on 15 machines in parallel) and the whole
pipeline typically required between a half and
a whole day.

However, we used machines with up to
500 GB RAM to train the large language mod-
els and translation models. Aligning the UN
corpora with Giza++ took around 5 days.
Giga French-English corpus was even worse
and required several weeks to complete. Us-
ing such a large corpus without pruning is not
practical.

4 Extra Experiments with Russian

In a separate set of experiments, we tried to
take a basic Moses framework and change the
setup a little for better results on morpholog-
ically rich languages.

Tried combinations were Russian-Czech and
Russian-English.

uation. Although lower official scores are ex-
pected, notice the larger gap in en-fr and cs-fr
translation. There seems to be a problem in
our French detokenization procedure.

4.1 Data
For the additional Russian-to-Czech systems,
we used following parallel data:

• UMC 0.1 (Klyueva and Bojar, 2008) – tri-
parallel set, consisting of news articles –
93,432 sentences

• data mined from movie subtitles (de-
scribed in further detail below) –
2,324,373 sentences

• Czech-Russian part of InterCorp – a cor-
pus from translation of fiction books (Čer-
mák and Rosen, 2012) – 148,847 sentences

For Russian-to-English translation, we used
combination of

• UMC 0.1 – 95,540 sentences

• subtitles – 1,790,209 sentences

– 1,000,000 sentences

• wiki headlines from WMT website 7 –
514,859 sentences

Added together, Russian-Czech parallel
data consisted of 2,566,615 sentences and
English-Czech parallel data consisted of
4,275,961 sentences 8.

We also used 765 sentences from UMC003
as a devset for MERT training.

4.1.1 Tokenization, tagging
Czech and English data was tokenized and
tagged using Morče tagger; Russian was to-
kenized and tagged using TreeTagger. Tree-
Tagger also does lemmatization; however, we
didn’t use lemmas for alignment or translation
models, since our experiments showed that
primitive stemming got better results.

However, what is important to mention is
that TreeTagger had problems with some cor-
pora, mostly Common Crawl. For some rea-
son, Russian TreeTagger has problems with
“dirty” data—sentences in English, French or
random non-unicode noise. It either slows
down significantly or stops working at all. For
this reason, we wrapped TreeTagger in a script
that detected those hangs and replaced the
erroneous Russian sentences with bogus, one-
letter Russian sentences (we can’t delete those,
since the lines already exist in the opposite lan-
guages; but since the pair doesn’t really make
sense in the first place, it doesn’t matter as
much).

All the data are lowercased for all the mod-
els and we recase the letters only at the very
end.

4.1.2 Subtitle data
For an unrelated project dealing with movie
subtitles translation, we obtained data from
OpenSubtitles.org for Czech and English sub-
titles. However, those data were not aligned
on sentence level and were less structured—we
had thousands of .srt files with some sort of
metadata.

When exploiting the data from the subtitles,

we made several observations:

• language used in subtitles is very different
from the language used in news articles

• one of the easiest and most accurate sen-
tence alignments in movie subtitles is the
one based purely on the time stamps

• allowing bigger differences in the time
stamps in the alignment produced more
data, but less accurate

• the subtitles are terribly out of domain (as
experiments with using only the subtitle
data showed us), but adding the corpus
mined from the subtitles still increases
the accuracy of the translation

• allowing bigger differences in the time
stamps and, therefore, more (albeit less
accurate) data always led to better results
in our tests.

In the end, we decided to pair as much sub-
titles as possible, even with the risk of some
being misaligned, because we found out that
this helped the most.

4.2 Translation model, language model
For alignment, we used primitive stemming
that takes just first 6 letters from a word.
We found out that using this “brute force”
stemming—for reasons that will have to be
explored in a further research—return better
results than regular lemmatization, for both
alignment and translation model, as described
further.

For each language pair, we used a transla-
tion model with two translation tables, one of
them as backoff model. More exactly, the pri-
mary translation is from a form to a combina-
tion of (lower case) form and tag, and the sec-
ondary backoff translation is from a “stem” de-
scribed above to a combination of (lower case)
form and tag.

We built two language models—one for tags
and one for lower case forms.

The models were actually a mixed model us-
ing interpolate option in SRILM—we trained a
different language model for each corpus, and
then we mixed the language models using a
small development set from UMC003.

4.3 Final Results
The final results from matrix.statmt.org are
in the table Table 8. You might notice a sharp
difference between lowercased and truecased
BLEU—that is due to a technical error that
we didn’t notice before the deadline.

5 Conclusion

We have described two independent Moses-
based SMT systems we used for the WMT
2013 shared task. We discussed experiments
with large data for many language pairs from
the point of view of both the translation accu-
racy and efficiency.
