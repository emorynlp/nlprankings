Abstract

The paper describes our experiments with
English-Czech machine translation for
WMT101 in 2010. Focusing primarily
on the translation to Czech, our additions
to the standard Moses phrase-based MT
pipeline include two-step translation to
overcome target-side data sparseness and
optimization towards SemPOS, a metric
better suited for evaluating Czech. Unfor-
tunately, none of the approaches bring a
significant improvement over our standard
setup.

1 Introduction

Czech is a flective language with very rich mor-
phological system. Translation between Czech
and English poses different challenges for each of
the directions.

When translating from Czech, the word order
usually needs only minor changes (despite the is-
sue of non-projectivity, a phenomenon occurring
at 2% of words but in 23% of Czech sentences,
see Hajičová et al. (2004) and Holan (2003)). A
much more severe issue is caused by the Czech vo-
cabulary size. Fortunately, this can be to a certain
extent mitigated by backing-off to Czech lemmas
if the exact forms are not available.

We are primarily interested in the harder task of
translating to Czech and most of the paper deals
with this direction. After a brief specification of
data sets, pre-processing and evaluation method
in this section, we provide details on the issue
of Czech vocabulary size (Section 2). We de-
scribe our current attempts at generating Czech

word forms in Section 3. Partly due to the large
vocabulary size of Czech, BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002) correlates rather poorly with human
judgments. We summarize our efforts to use a bet-
ter metric in the model optimization in Section 4.
The final Section 5 lists the exact configurations
of our English↔Czech primary submissions for
WMT10, including the back-off to lemmas we use
for Czech-to-English.

1.1 Data and Pre-Processing Pipeline

Throughout the paper, we use CzEng 0.9 (Bojar
and Žabokrtský, 2009)2 as our main parallel cor-
pus. Following CzEng authors’ request, we did
not use sections 8* and 9* reserved for evaluation
purposes.

As the baseline training dataset (“Small” in the
following) only the news domain of CzEng (126k
parallel sentences) is used. For large-scale ex-
periments (“Large” in the following) and our pri-
mary WMT10 submissions, we use all CzEng do-
mains except navajo and add the EMEA corpus
(Tiedemann, 2009)3 ,4 of 7.5M parallel sententes.

As our monolingual data we use by default only
the target side of the parallel corpus. For experi-
ments reported here, we also use the monolingual
data provided by WMT10 organizers for Czech.
Our primary WMT10 submission includes further
monolingual data, see Section 5.1.

We use a slightly modified tokenization rules
compared to CzEng export format. Most notably,
we normalize English abbreviated negation and
auxiliary verbs (“couldn’t” → “could not”) and
attempt at normalizing quotation marks to distin-
guish between the opening and closing one follow-

4Unfortunately, the EMEA corpus is badly tokenized on

the Czech side. Most frequently, fractional numbers are split
into several tokens (e.g. “3, 14”). We attempted to reconstruct
the original detokenized form using a small set of regular ex-
pressions.

ing proper typesetting rules.
The rest of our pre-processing pipeline matches

the processing employed in CzEng (Bojar and
Žabokrtský, 2009).5 We use “supervised truecas-
ing”, meaning that we cast the case of the lemma
to the form, relying on our morphological analyz-
ers and taggers to identify proper names, all other
words are lowercased.

The differences in relations between Czech and
English Large and Small datasets can be attributed
either to domain differences or possibly due to
noise in CzEng.

1.2 Evaluation

We use WMT10 development sets for tuning
(news-test2008) and evaluation (news-test2009).
The official scores on news-test2010 are given
only in the main WMT10 paper and not here.

The BLEU scores reported in this paper are
based on truecased word forms in the original to-
kenization as provided by the decoder. Therefore
they are likely to differ from figures reported else-
where.

The ± value given with each BLEU score is the
average of the distances to the lower and upper
empirical 95% confidence bounds estimated using
bootstrapping (Koehn, 2004).

2 Issues of Czech Vocabulary Size

Table 1 summarizes the differences of Czech and
English vocabulary sizes in our parallel corpora.
We see that the vocabulary size of Czech forms
(truecased) is more than double compared to En-
glish in the Small dataset and significantly larger
in the Large dataset as well. On the other hand,
the number of distinct Czech and English lemmas
is nearly identical.

5Due to the subsequent processing, incl. parsing, the tok-
enization of English follows PennTreebenk style. The rather
unfortunate convention of treating hyphenated words as sin-
gle tokens increases our out-of-vocabulary rate. Next time,
we will surely post-tokenize the parsed text.

tortion limits and translation options per coverage

2.1 Out-of-Vocabulary Rates

Table 2 lists out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates of our
Small and Large data setting given the develop-
ment corpus. We calculate the rates for both the
complete corpus and the restricted set of phrases
extracted from the corpus. (Note that higher-order
n-gram rates are estimated using phrases as inde-
pendent units, no combination of phrases is per-
formed.) We also list the effective OOV rate for
English-to-Czech translation where all (English)
words from each source sentence can be also pro-
duced in the hypothesis.

We see that in the small setting, the OOV rate
is almost double for Czech than for English. The
OOV is significantly decreased by enlarging the
corpus or lemmatizing the word forms.

If we consider only the words available in the
phrase tables, the issue of Czech with limited data
is striking: 10–12% of devset tokens are not avail-
able in the training data.

2.2 Reachability of Training and Reference
Translations

Schwartz (2008) extended Moses to support “con-
straint decoding”, that is to perform an exhaustive
search through the space of hypotheses in order to
reach the reference translation (and get its score).

The current implementation of the exhaustive
search in Moses is in fact subject to several con-
figuration parameters, most importantly the num-
ber of translation options considered for each span
(-max-trans-opt-per-coverage) and the
distortion limit (-distortion-limit).

Given his aim, Schwartz (2008) uses the output
of four MT systems translating from different lan-
guages to English as the references and notes that
only around 10% of the reference translations are
reachable by an independent Swedish-English MT
system.

coding paths to translate from Czech lemma if
the form is not available in the translation table
(BLEU score 18.70±0.46).

We observe that reaching man-made reference
translations in Czech-to-English translation is far
harder. Table 3 provides the figures for small data
setting (and no phrase table filtering). The best
reachability we can hope for is given in Table 4
where we allow to use source word lemmas if the
exact form is not available. We see that the default
limits (50 translation options per span and distor-
tion limit of 6) leave us with only 6.7% sentences
reachable.

While not directly important for your training,
the figures still underpin the issue of sparse data in
Czech-English translation.

3 Targetting Czech Word Forms

Bojar (2007) experimented with several transla-
tion scenarios, including what we will call Mor-
phG, i.e. the independent translation of lemma to
lemma and tag to tag followed by a generation step
to produce target-side word form. With the small
training set available then, the MorphG model per-
formed equally well as a simpler direct translation
followed by target-side tagging and an additional
n-gram model over morphological tags. Koehn
and Hoang (2007) reports even a large loss with
MorphG for German-to-English if the alternative

of direct form-to-form translation is not available.
Bojar et al. (2009b) applied the two alternative

decoding paths (direct form-to-form and MorphG,
labelled “T+C+C&T+T+G”) to English-Czech but
they were able to use only 84k sentences. For
the full training set of 2.2M sentences, the model
was too big to fit in reasonable disk limits. More
importantly, already in the small data setting, the
complex model suffered from little stability due
to abundance of features (5 features per phrase-
table plus tree features for three LMs), so nearly
the same performance on the development set gave
largely varying quality on the independent test set.

The most important issue of the MorphG setup,
however, is the explosion of translation options.
Due to the “synchronous factors” approach of
Moses (Koehn and Hoang, 2007), all translation
options have to be fully constructed before the
main search begins. The MorphG model how-
ever licenses too many possible combinations of
lemmas, tags and final word forms, so the prun-
ing of translation options strikes hard, causing
search errors. For more details, see Bojar et al.
(2009a) where a similar issue occurs for treelet-
based translation.

3.1 Two-Step Translation

In order to avoid the explosion of the translation
options6, we experimented with two-step transla-
tion.

The first step translates from English to lemma-
tized Czech augmented to preserve important se-
mantic properties known from the source phrase.
The second step is a monotone translation from
the lemmas to fully inflected Czech. The idea be-
hind the delimitation is that all the morphological
properties of Czech words that can be established

6and also motivated when we noticed that reading MT
output to lemmatized Czech is sometimes more pleasant and
informative than regular phrase-based output

regardless the English source should not cause par-
allel data sparseness and clutter the search. In-
stead, they should be decided based on context in
the second phase only.

Specifically, the intermediate Czech represents
most words as tuples containing only: lemma,
negation, grade (of adjectives and adverbs), num-
ber (of nouns, adjectives, verbs) and detailed part
of speech (constraining also e.g. verb tense of
Czech verbs). Some words are handled separately:

• Pronouns, punctuation and the verbs “být” (to
be) and “mı́t” (to have) are represented using
their lowecased full forms because they are very
frequent, often auxiliary to other words and
their exact form best captures the available and
necessary detail of many morphological and
syntactic properties.

• Prepositions are represented using their lemmas
and case because the case of a noun phrase is
actually introduced by the governing word (e.g.
the verb that subcategorized for the noun phrase
or the preposition for prepositional phrases).

Table 5 compares the scores of the simple
phrase-based and the two-step translation via aug-
mented Czech lemmas as described above. The
small and large parallel data denote the datasets
described in Section 1.1. The small monolingual
set means just the news domain of CzEng, while
the large monolingual set means WMT10 mono-
lingual Czech texts (and no CzEng data). Note
that the monolingual data serve three purposes in
the two-step approach: the language model for the
first phase, the translation model in the second
phase (monotone and restricted to phrase-length
of 1; longer phrases did not bring significant im-
provement either), and the language model of the
second phase. Ignoring the opportunity to use the
monolingual set as the language model in the first
phase already hurts the performance.

We see that the results as evaluated both by
BLEU and SemPOS (see Section 4 below) are
rather mixed but not that surprising. There is a
negligible gain in the Small-Small setting, a mixed
outcome in the Small-Large and a little loss in the

Large-Large setting.
The most interesting result is the Small-Large

setting: BLEU (insignificantly) prefers the simple
and SemPOS the two-step model. It thus seems
that a large target-side LM is sufficient to improve
the BLEU score, despite the untackled issue of
bilingual data sparseness.

We carried out a quick manual evaluation of
150 sentences by two annotators (one of the au-
thors and a third person; systems anonymized):
for each input segment, either one of the outputs
is distinguishably better or both are equally wrong
or equally acceptable. As listed in the confusion
matrix in Table 6, each annotator independently
marginally prefers the two-step approach but the
intersection does not confirm that.7 One good
thingis that the annotators do not completely con-
tradict each other’s preference.

Ultimately, we did not use the two-step ap-
proach in our primary submission, but we feel
there is still some unexploited potential in this
phrase-based approximation of the technique sep-
arating properties of words handled in the transla-
tion phase from properties implied by the target-
side (grammatical) context only. Certainly, the
representation of the intermediate language can

7Of the 23 sentences improved by the two-step setup,
about three quarters indeed had an improvement in lexical
coverage or better morphological choice of a word. Of the
23 sentences where the two-step model hurts, about a half
suffered from errors related to superfluous auxiliary words in
Czech that seem to be introduced by a bias towards word-
for-word translation. This bias is not inherent to the model,
only the (normalized) phrase penalty weight happened to get
nearly three times bigger than in the simple model.

be still improved, and more importantly, the sec-
ond phase of monotone decoding could be handled
by a more appropriate model capable of including
more additional (source) context features.8

4 Optimizing towards SemPOS

In our setup, we use minimum error-rate training
(MERT, Och (2003)) to optimize weights of model
components. In the standard implementation in
Moses, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is used as
the objective function, despite its rather disputable
correlation with human judgments of MT quality.

Kos and Bojar (2009) introduced SemPOS, a
metric that performs much better in terms of cor-
relation to human judgments when translating to
Czech. Naturally, we wanted to optimize towards
SemPOS.

SemPOS computes the overlapping of autose-
mantic (content-bearing) word lemmas in the can-
didate and reference translations given a fine-
grained semantic part of speech (sempos9), as de-
fined in Hajič et al. (2006), and outputs average
overlapping score over all sempos types.

The SemPOS metric outperformed common
metrics as BLEU, TER (Snover et al., 2006) or an
adaptation of Meteor (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007)
for Czech on test sets from WMT08 (Callison-
Burch et al., 2008).

4.1 Integrating SemPOS to MERT

In our experiments we used Z-MERT (Zaidan,
2009), a recent implementation of the MERT al-
gorithm, to optimize model parameters.

The SemPOS metric requires to remove all aux-
iliary words and to identify the (deep-syntactic)
lemmas and semantic part of speech for autose-
mantic words. When employed in MERT train-
ing, the whole n-best list of candidates has to pro-
cessed like this at each iteration.

We use the TectoMT platform (Žabokrtský and
Bojar, 2008)10 for the linguistic processing. Tec-
toMT follows the complete pipeline of tagging,
surface-syntactic analysis and deep-syntactic anal-
ysis, which is the best but rather costly way to ob-
tain the required information.

Therefore, we use two different ways of obtain-
ing lemmas and semantic parts of speech in the

8We are grateful to Trevor Cohn for the suggestion.
9In the following text we will use SemPOS to denote the

SemPOS metric. When speaking about the semantic part of
speech, we will write sempos type or sempos tag.

Table 7: Five independent MERT runs optimizing
towards SemPOS with semantic parts of speech
and lemmas provided either by TectoMT on the
fly or by Moses factored translation.

MERT loop:
• indeed apply TectoMT processing to the n-best

list at each iteration (parallelized to 15 CPUs),
• apply TectoMT to the training data, express the

(deep) lemma and sempos as additional factors
using a blank value for auxiliary words, and us-
ing Moses factored translation to translate from
English forms to triplets of Czech form, deep
lemma and sempos.
Table 7 lists several ZMERT runs when opti-

mizing a simple form→form phrase-based model
(small data setting) towards SemPOS. One obser-
vation is that using TectoMT in the MERT loop
is unbearably costly and we avoided it in the sub-
sequent experiments. More importantly, from the
huge differences in the final BLEU as well as Sem-
POS scores (evaluated on the independent test set),
we see how unstable the search is.

SemPOS, while good at comparing different
MT systems, is very bad at comparing candidates
from a single system in an n-best list. This can be
easily explained by its low sensitivity to precision:
SemPOS disregards word forms as well as all aux-
iliary words. This is a good thing to compare very
different candidates (where each of the systems al-
ready struggled to produce a coherent output) but
is of very little help when comparing candidates of
a single system, because these candidates tend to
differ rather in forms than in lexical choice.

4.2 Combination of SemPOS and BLEU

To compensate for some of the shortcomings of
SemPOS, we also attempted to optimize towards
a linear combination of SemPOS and BLEU.
This should increase the suitability of the metric
for MERT optimization because BLEU will take
correct word forms into account while SemPOS
should promote better lexical choice (possibly not
confirmed by BLEU due to a different word form
than in the reference).

Table 8 provides the results of various weight

settings, including the optimization towards
BLEU alone using ZMERT implementation. We
see that the stability is much better, only few runs
suffered a minor loss (including 1:1 in one case).
Unfortunately, the differences in final BLEU and
SemPOS scores are all within confidence intervals
when trained on the small dataset.

Table 9 documents that in our large data set-
ting, MERT indeed achieves slightly higher Sem-
POS (and lower BLEU) when optimizing towards
it. This corresponds with the intuition that with
more variance in lexical choices available in the
phrase tables, SemPOS can help to balance model
features. The current set of weights is rather lim-
ited, so our future experiments should focus on ac-
tually providing means to e.g. domain adaptation
by using features indicating the applicability of a
phrase in a specific domain.

5 Our Primary Submissions to WMT10

5.1 English-to-Czech Translation

Given the little or no improvements achieved by
the many configurations we tried, our English-to-
Czech primary submission is rather simple:
• Standard GIZA++ word alignment based on both source

and target lemmas.
• Two alternative decoding paths; forms always truecased:

form+tag→form & form→form.
The first path is more specific and helps to preserve core
syntactic elements in the sentence. Without the tag, am-
biguous English words could often all translate as e.g.
nouns, leading to no verb in the Czech sentence. The de-
fault path serves as a back-off.

• Significance filtering of the phrase tables (Johnson et al.,
2007) implemented for Moses by Chris Dyer; default set-
tings of filter value a+e and the cut-off 30.

• Two separate 5-gram Czech LMs of truecased forms each
of which interpolates models trained on the following
datasets; the interpolation weights were set automatically
using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) based on the target side of

rationale behind the selection of the domains is that we
prefer prose-like texts for LM estimation (and not e.g.
technical documentation) while we want as much paral-
lel data as possible.

• Lexicalized reordering (or-bi-fe) based on forms.
• Standard Moses MERT towards BLEU.

5.2 Czech-to-English Translation

For Czech-to-English translation we experimented
with far fewer configuration options. Our primary
submission is configured as follows:
• Two alternative decoding paths; forms always truecased:

form→form & lemma→form.
• Significance filtering as in Section 5.1.
• 5-gram English LM based on CzEng English side only.12

• Lexicalized reordering (or-bi-fe) based on forms.
• Standard Moses MERT towards BLEU.

Table 10 documents the utility of the additional
decoding path from Czech lemmas in both small
and large setting, surprisingly less significant in
the small setting. Later experiments with system
combination by Kenneth Heafield indicated that
while our system is not among the top three, it
brings an advantage to the combination.

6 Conclusion

We provided an extensive documentation of Czech
data sparseness issue for machine translation. We
attempted to tackle the problem of constructing
the target-side form by a two-step translation setup
and the problem of unreliable automatic evalua-
tion by employing a new metric in MERT loop,
neither with much success so far. Both of the at-
tempts however deserve further exploration. Ad-
ditionally, we provide the exact configurations of
our WMT10 primary submissions.

11The subsequent MERT training using the same develop-
ment test may suffer from overestimating the language model
weights, but we did not observe the issue, possibly due to
only moderate overlap of the datasets.

12We attempted to use a second LM trained on English Gi-
gaword by Chris Callison-Burch, but we observed a drop in
BLEU score from 18.95±0.45 to 18.03±0.44 probably due
to different tokenization guidelines applied.
