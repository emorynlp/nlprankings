Abstract

This study presents a method that assesses
ESL learners’ vocabulary usage to improve
an automated scoring system of sponta-
neous speech responses by non-native English
speakers. Focusing on vocabulary sophistica-
tion, we estimate the difficulty of each word
in the vocabulary based on its frequency in
a reference corpus and assess the mean diffi-
culty level of the vocabulary usage across the
responses (vocabulary profile).

Three different classes of features were gen-
erated based on the words in a spoken re-
sponse: coverage-related, average word rank
and the average word frequency and the extent
to which they influence human-assigned lan-
guage proficiency scores was studied. Among
these three types of features, the average word
frequency showed the most predictive power.
We then explored the impact of vocabulary
profile features in an automated speech scor-
ing context, with particular focus on the im-
pact of two factors: genre of reference corpora
and the characteristics of item-types.

The contribution of the current study lies in
the use of vocabulary profile as a measure of
lexical sophistication for spoken language as-
sessment, an aspect heretofore unexplored in
the context of automated speech scoring.

1 Introduction

This study provides a method that measures ESL
(English as a second language) learners’ compe-
tence in vocabulary usage.

Spoken language assessments typically measure
multiple dimensions of language ability. Overall

proficiency in the target language can be assessed
by testing the abilities in various areas including flu-
ency, pronunciation, and intonation; grammar and
vocabulary; and discourse structure. With the recent
move toward the objective assessment of language
ability (spoken and written), it is imperative that we
develop methods for quantifying these abilities and
measuring them automatically.

A majority of the studies in automated speech
scoring have focused on fluency (Cucchiarini et al.,
2000; Cucchiarini et al., 2002), pronunciation (Witt
and Young, 1997; Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 1997;
Neumeyer et al., 2000), and intonation (Zechner et
al., 2011). More recently, Chen and Yoon (2011)
and Chen and Zechner (2011) have measured syn-
tactic competence in speech scoring. However, only
a few have explored features related to vocabulary
usage and they have been limited to type-token ratio
(TTR) related features (e.g., Lu (2011)). In addi-
tion, Bernstein et al. (2010) developed vocabulary
features that measure the similarity between the vo-
cabulary in the test responses and the vocabulary in
the pre-collected texts in the same topic. However,
their features assessed content and topicality, not vo-
cabulary usage.

The speaking construct of vocabulary usage com-
prises two sub-constructs: sophistication and preci-
sion. The aspect of vocabulary that we intend to
measure in this paper is that of lexical sophistication,
also termed lexical diversity and lexical richness in
second language studies. Measures of lexical so-
phistication attempt to quantify the degree to which
a varied and large vocabulary is used (Laufer and
Nation, 1995). In order to assess the degree of lex-

180



ical sophistication, we employ a vocabulary profile-
based approach (partly motivated from the results of
a previous study, as will be explained in Section 2).

By a vocabulary profile, it is meant that the fre-
quency of each vocabulary item is calculated from
a reference corpus covering the language variety of
the target situation. The degree of lexical sophisti-
cation is captured by the word frequency - low fre-
quency words are considered to be more difficult,
and therefore more sophisticated. We then design
features that capture the difficulty level of vocabu-
lary items in test takers’ responses. Finally, we per-
form correlation analyses between these new fea-
tures and human proficiency scores and assess the
feature’s importance with respect to the other fea-
tures in an automatic scoring module. The novelty
of this study lies in the use of vocabulary profile in
an automatic scoring set-up to assess lexical sophis-
tication.

This paper will proceed as follows: we will re-
view related work in Section 2. Data and experiment
setup will be explained in Section 3 and Section 4.
Next, we will present the results in Section 5, discuss
them in Section 6, and conclude with a summary of
the importance of our findings in Section 7.

2 Related Work

Measures of lexical richness have been the focus of
several studies involving assessment of L1 and L2
language abilities (Laufer and Nation, 1995; Ver-
meer, 2000; Daller et al., 2003; Kormos and Denes,
2004). The types of measures considered in these
studies can be grouped into quantitative and qualita-
tive measures.

The quantitative measures give insight into the
number of words known, but do not distinguish them
from one another based on their category or fre-
quency in language use. They have evolved to make
up for the widely applied measure type-token-ratio
(TTR). However, owing to its sensitivity to the num-
ber of tokens, TTR has been considered as an un-
stable measure in differing proficiency levels of lan-
guage learners. The Guiraud index, Uber index, and
Herdan index (Vermeer, 2000; Daller et al., 2003;
Lu, 2011) are some measures in this category mostly
derived from TTR as either simpler transformations
of the TTR or its scaled versions to ameliorate the

effect of differing token cardinalities.
Qualitative measures, on the other hand, dis-

tinguish themselves from those derived from TTR
since they take into account distinctions between
words such as their parts of speech or difficulty lev-
els. Adding a qualitative dimension gives more in-
sight into lexical aspects of language ability than
the purely quantitative measures such as TTR-based
measures. Some measures in this category in-
clude a derived form of the limiting relative diver-
sity (LRD) given by

√
D(verbs)/D(nouns) using

the D-measure proposed in (Malvern and Richards,
1997), Lexical frequency profile (LFP) (Laufer and
Nation, 1995) and P-Lex (Meara and Bell, 2003).

LFP uses a vocabulary profile (VP) for a given
body of written text or spoken utterance and gives
the percentage of words used at different frequency
levels (such as from the one-thousand most com-
mon words, the next thousand most common words)
where the words themselves come from a pre-
compiled vocabulary list, such as the Academic
Word List (AWL) with its associated frequency dis-
tribution on words by Coxhead(1998). Frequency
level refers to a class of words (or appropriately cho-
sen word units) that are grouped based on their fre-
quencies of actual usage in corpora. P-Lex is an-
other approach that uses the frequency level of the
words to assess lexical richness. These measures are
based on the differing frequencies of lexical items
and hence rely on the availability of frequency lists
for the language being considered.

These two different types of measures have been
used in the analysis of essays written by second lan-
guage learners of English (ESL). Laufer and Nation
(1995) have shown that LFP correlates well with an
independent measure of vocabulary knowledge and
that it is possible to categorize learners according to
different proficiency levels using this measure. In
another study seeking to understand the extent to
which VP based on students’ essays predicted their
academic performance (Morris and Cobb, 2004), it
was observed that students’ vocabulary profile re-
sults correlated significantly with their grades. Ad-
ditionally, VP was found to be indicative of finer dis-
tinctions in the language skills of high proficiency
nonnative speakers than oral interviews can cover.

Furthermore, these measures have been employed
in automated essay scoring. Attali and Burstein

181



(2006) used average word frequency and average
word length in characters across the words in the
essay. In addition to the average word frequency
measure, the average word length measure was im-
plemented to assess the average difficulty of the
word used in the essay under the assumption that
the words with more characters were more difficult
than the words with fewer characters. These fea-
tures showed promising performance in estimating
test takers’ proficiency levels.

In contrast to qualitative measures, quantitative
measures did not achieve promising performance.
Vermeer (2000) showed that quantitative measures
achieve neither the validity nor the reliability of the
measures, regardless of the transformations and cor-
rections.

More recently, the relationship of lexical rich-
ness to ESL learners’ speaking task performance
has been studied by Lu (2011). The comprehensive
study was aimed at measuring lexical richness along
the three dimensions of lexical density, sophistica-
tion, and variation, using 25 different metrics (be-
longing to both the qualitative and quantitative cate-
gories above) available in the language acquisition
literature. His results, based on the manual tran-
scription of a spoken corpus of English learners, in-
dicate that a) lexical variation (the number of word
types) correlated most strongly with the raters’ judg-
ments of the quality of ESL learners’ oral narratives,
b) lexical sophistication only had a very small ef-
fect, and c) lexical density (indicative of proportion
of lexical words) in an oral narrative did not appear
to relate to its quality.

In this study, we seek to quantify vocabulary us-
age in terms of measures of lexical sophistication:
VP based on a set of reference word lists. The nov-
elty of the current study lies in the use of VP as
a measure of lexical sophistication for spoken lan-
guage assessment. It derives support from other
studies (Morris and Cobb, 2004; Laufer and Nation,
1995) but is carried out in a completely different
context, that of automatic scoring of proficiency lev-
els in spontaneous speech, an area not explored thus
far in existing literature.

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the
genre of the reference corpus on the performance of
these lexical measures. For this purpose, three dif-
ferent corpora will be used to generate reference fre-

quency levels. Finally, we will investigate how the
characteristics of the item types influence the perfor-
mance of these measures.

3 Data

The AEST balanced data set, a collection of re-
sponses from the AEST, is used in this study.
AEST is a high-stakes test of English proficiency,
and it consists of 6 items in which speakers are
prompted to provide responses lasting between 45
and 60 seconds per item, yielding approximately 5
minutes of spoken content per speaker.

Among the 6 items, two items elicit information
or opinions on familiar topics based on the exam-
inees’ personal experience or background knowl-
edge. These constitute the independent (IND) items.
The four remaining items are integrated tasks that
include other language skills such as listening and
reading. These constitute the integrated (INT)
items. Both sets of items extract spontaneous and
unconstrained natural speech. The primary dif-
ference between the two elicitation types is that
IND items only provide a prompt whereas INT items
provide a prompt, a reading passage, and a listening
stimulus. The size, purpose, and speakers’ native
language information for each dataset are summa-
rized in Table 1. All items extract spontaneous, un-
constrained natural speech.

Each response was rated by a trained human rater
using a 4-point scoring scale, where 1 indicates
a low speaking proficiency and 4 indicates a high
speaking proficiency. The scoring guideline is sum-
marized in the AEST rubrics.

Since none of the AEST balanced data was
double-scored, we estimate the inter-rater agreement
ratio of the corpus by using a large double-scored
dataset which used the same scoring guidelines and
scoring process; using the 41K double-scored re-
sponses collected from AEST, we calculate the Pear-
son correlation coefficient to be 0.63, suggesting a
reasonable agreement. The distribution of scores for
this data can be found in Table 2.

multiple sets of vocabulary lists (e.g., a list of the
100 most frequent words in a reference corpus).
Next, for each test response, a transcription was gen-
erated using the speech recognizer. For each re-
sponse with respect to each reference word list, vo-
cabulary profile features were calculated. In addi-
tion to vocabulary profile features, type-token ratio
(TTR) was calculated as a baseline feature. Despite
its instability, TTR has been employed in the auto-
mated speech scoring systems such as (Zechner et
al., 2009), and its use here allows a direct compar-
ison of the performance of the features with the re-
sults of previous studies.

4.2 Vocabulary list generation
The three reference corpora we used in this study
are presented in Table 3: The General Service
List (GSL), the TOEFL 2000 Spoken and Written
Academic Language Corpus (T2K-SWAL) and the
AEST data.

Corpus Genre Tokens Types
GSL Written - 2,284
T2K-SWAL Spoken 1,869,346 28,855
AEST data Spoken 5,520,375 23,165

Table 3: Three reference corpora used in this study

GSL (West, 1953) comprises 2,284 words se-
lected to be of “general service” to learners of En-
glish. In this study, we used the version with fre-
quency information from (Bauman, 1995). The orig-
inal version did not include word frequency and
was ‘enhanced’ by John Bauman and Brent Culli-

gan with the frequency information obtained from
the Brown Corpus, a collection of written texts.

T2K-SWAL (Biber et al., 2002) is a collection of
spoken and written texts covering a broad language
variety and use in the academic setting. In this study,
only its spoken texts were used. The spoken corpus
included manual transcriptions of discussions, con-
versations, and lectures that occurred in class ses-
sions, study-group meetings, office hours, and ser-
vice encounters.

Finally, AEST data is a collection of manual tran-
scriptions of spoken responses from the AEST for
non-native English speakers. Although there was no
overlap between AEST data and the evaluation data
(AEST balanced data), the vocabulary lists in AEST
data might be a closer match to the vocabulary lists
in the evaluation data since both of them come from
the same test products. From a content perspective,
this dataset is likely to better reflect characteristics
of non-native English speakers than the other two
reference corpora.

For T2K-SWAL and AEST, all transcriptions
were normalized; all the tokens were further de-
capitalized and removed of all non-alphanumeric
characters except for dash and quote. The morpho-
logical variants were considered as different words.
All words were sorted by the word occurrences in
the corpus, and a set of 6 lists were generated:
top-100 words (TOP1), word frequency ranks 101-
300 (TOP2), ranks 301-700 (TOP3), ranks 701-1500
(TOP4), ranks 1501-3000 (TOP5), and all other
words with ranks of 3001 and above (TOP6). For
GSL, a set of 5 lists was generated; TOP6 was
not generated since GSL only included about 2200
words.

Compared to written texts, speakers tended to use
a much smaller vocabulary in speech. For instance,
the percentage of words within the top-1000 words
on the total word types of AEST data responses was
over 90% on average, and they were similar across

183



proficiency levels. This is the reason why we sub-
classified the top 1000 words into three lists, unlike
the vocabulary profile features using top-1000 words
as one list like (Morris and Cobb, 2004), which did
not have any power to differentiate between profi-
ciency levels.

4.3 Transcription generation for evaluation
data

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) speech recognizer
was trained on the AEST dataset, approximately
733 hours of non-native speech collected from 7872
speakers. A gender independent triphone acoustic
model and a combination of bigram, trigram, and
four-gram language models was used. The word
error rate (WER) on the held-out test dataset was
27%. For each response in the evaluation partition,
an ASR-based transcription was generated using the
speech recognizer.

4.4 Feature generation

Each response comprised less than 60 seconds of
speech with an average of 113 word tokens. Due
to the short response length, there was wide varia-
tion in the proportion of low-frequency word types
for the same speaker. In order to address this issue,
for each speaker, two responses from the same item-
type (IND/INT) were concatenated and used as one
large response. As a result, three concatenated re-
sponses (one IND response and two INT responses)
were generated for each speaker, yielding a total of
480 concatenated responses for IND items and 960
concatenated responses for INT items for our exper-
iment.

First, a list of word types was generated from
the ASR hypothesis of each concatenated response.
IND items provide only a one-sentence prompt,
while INT items provide stimuli including a prompt,
a reading passage, and a listening stimulus. In order
to minimize the influence of the vocabulary in the
stimuli on that of the speakers, we excluded the con-
tent words that occurred in the prompts or stimuli
from the word type list1.

1This process prevents to measure the content relevance;
whether the response is off-topic or not. However, this is not
problematic since the features in this study will be used in the
conjunction with the features that measure the accuracy of the
aspects of content and topicality such as (Xie et al., 2012)’s fea-

a For GSL, five different features were created using
TOP1-TOP5 lists, but TOP6 was not created. For
T2K-SWAL and AEST data, six different features were
created using TOP1-TOP6 lists separately.

b “rank” is the ordinal number of words in a list that is sorted in
descending order of word frequency; words not present in the
reference corpus get the default rank of RefMaxRank+1.

c Avg. word frequency is the sum of the word-frequencies of
word types in the reference corpus divided by the total
number of words in the reference corpus; words not in the
reference corpus get assigned a default frequency of 1.

d Same as feature aFreq, but the logarithm of the word
frequency is taken here

Next, we generated five types of features using
three reference vocabulary lists. A maximum of 10
features were generated for each reference list. The
feature-types are tabulated in Table 4.

All features above were generated from word
types, not word tokens, i.e., multiple occurrences of
the same word in a response were only counted once.

Below we delineate the step-by-step process with
a sample response that leads to the feature genera-
tion outlined in Table 5.

• Step 1: Generate ASR hypothesis for the given
speech response. e.g: Every student has dif-
ferent perspective about how to relax. Playing
xbox.

• Step 2: Generate type list from ASR hypoth-
esis. For the response above we get the list
- about, how, different, xbox, to, relax, every,
perspective, student, has, playing.

• Step 3: Generate type list excluding words that
occurred in the prompt - about, how, different,
xbox, to, every, perspective, has, playing.

From the ASR hypotheses (result of Step 1), the
corresponding type list was generated (Step 2) and
two words (‘student’, ‘relax’) were excluded from
the final list due to overlap with the prompt. The
final word list used in the feature generation has 9
types (Step 3).

Next, for each word in the above type list, if it oc-
curs in the reference corpus (a list of words sorted
by frequency), its word frequency, word rank and
the TOPn information (whether the word belonged
to the TOPn list or not) are obtained. If it did not oc-
cur in the reference corpus, the default frequency (1)
and the default word rank (20000) were assigned. In
5, the default values were assigned for ‘xbox’ since
it was not in the reference corpus.

Finally, the average of the word frequencies and
the average of the the word ranks were calculated
(aFreq and aRank). For lFreq, the log value of each
frequency was calculated and then averaged. For
TOPn features, we obtain the proportion of the word
types that belong to the TOPn category. For the
above sample, the TOP1 feature value was 0.444
since 4 words belong to TOP1 and the total number
of word types was 9 (4/9=0.444).

5 Results

5.1 Correlation

We analyzed the relationship between the proposed
features and human proficiency scores to assess their
influence on predicting the proficiency score. The
reference proficiency score for a concatenated re-
sponse was estimated by summing up the two scores
of the constituent responses. Thus, the new score
scale was 2-8. Table 6 presents Pearson correlation
coefficients (r).

The best performing feature was aFreq followed
by TOP1. Both features showed statistically signif-
icant negative correlations with human proficiency
scores. TOP6 also showed statistically significant
correlation with human scores, but it was 10-20%
lower than TOP1. This suggests that a human rater
more likely assigned high scores when the vocabu-
lary of the response was not limited to a few most
frequent words. However, the use of difficult words
(low-frequency) shows a weaker relationship with
the proficiency scores.

Features based on AEST data outperformed fea-
tures based on T2K-SWAL or GSL. The correlation
of the AEST data-based aFreq feature was −0.61
for the IND items and−0.51 for the INT items; they
were approximately 0.1 higher than the correlations
of T2K-SWAL or GSL-based features. A similar
tendency was found for the TOP1-TOP6 features,
although differences between AEST data-based fea-
tures and other reference-based features were less
salient overall.

For top-performing vocabulary profile features
including aFreq and TOP1, the correlations of
INT items were weaker than those of the IND items.
In general, the correlations of INT items were 10-
20% lower than those of the IND items in absolute
value.

aFreq and TOP1 consistently achieved better
performance than TTR across all item-types.

5.2 Scoring model building

To arrive at an automatic scoring model, we included
the new vocabulary profile features with other fea-
tures previously found to be useful in a multiple lin-
ear regression (MLR) framework. A total of 80 fea-
tures were generated by the automated speech pro-
ficiency scoring system from Zechner et al. (2009),

Table 6: Correlations between features and human proficiency scores

and they were classified into 5 sub-groups: fluency,
pronunciation, prosody, vocabulary complexity, and
grammar usage. For each sub-group, at least one
feature that correlated well with human scores but
had a low inter-correlation with other features was
selected. A total of following 6 features were se-
lected and used in the base model (base):

• wdpchk (fluency): Average chunk length in words;
a chunk is a segment whose boundaries are set by
long silences

• tpsecutt (fluency): Number of types per sec.

• normAM (pronunciation): Average acoustic model
score normalized by the speaking rate

• phn shift (pronunciation): Average absolute dis-
tance of the normalized vowel durations compared
to standard normalized vowel durations estimated
on a native speech corpus

• stretimdev (prosody): Mean deviation of distance
between stressed syllables in sec.

• lmscore (grammar): Average language model score
normalized by number of words

We first calculated correlations between these fea-
tures and human proficiency scores and compared
them with the most predictive vocabulary profile
features. Table 7 presents Pearson correlation co-
efficients (r) of these features.

In both item-types, the most correlated features
represented the aspect of fluency in production.
While tpsecutt was the best feature in IND items
and the correlation with human scores was approx-
imately 0.66, in INT items, wdpchk was the best
feature and the correlation was even higher, 0.73.

The performance of aFreq was particularly high
in IND items; it was the second best feature and only
marginally lower than the best feature (by 0.04).
aFreq also achieved promising performance in INT;

it was the fourth best feature. However, the perfor-
mance was considerably lower than the the best fea-
ture, and the difference between the best feature and
aFreq was approximately 22%.

We compared the performances of this base
model with an augmented model (base + TTR + all
vocabulary profile features) whose feature set was
the base augmented with our proposed measures of
vocabulary sophistication. Item-type specific multi-
ple linear regression models were trained using five-
fold cross validation. The 480 IND responses 960
INT responses were partitioned into five sets, sepa-
rately. In each fold, an item-type specific regression
model was trained using four of these partitions and
tested on the remaining one.

The averages of the five-fold models are sum-
marized in Table 8, showing weighted kappa to
indicate agreement between automatic scores and
human-assigned scores and also the Pearson’s cor-
relation (r) of the unrounded (un-rnd) and rounded
(rnd) scores with the human-assigned scores. We
used the correlation and weighted kappa as perfor-
mance evaluation measures to maintain the consis-
tency with the previous studies such as (Zechner
et al., 2009). In addition, the correlation metric

matches better with our goal to investigate the rela-
tionship between the predicted scores and the actual
scores rather than the difference between the pre-
dicted scores and the actual scores.

6 Discussion

In general, we found that the test takers used a fairly
small number of vocabulary items in the spoken re-
sponses. On average, the total types used in the
responses was 87.21 for IND items and 98.52 for
INT items. Furthermore, the proportions of high
frequency words on test takers’ spoken responses
were markedly high. The proportion of top-100
words was almost 50% and the proportion of top-
1500 words (summation of TOP1-TOP4) was over
89% on average. This means that only 1500 words
represent almost 90% of the active vocabulary of
the test takers in their spontaneous speech. Figure
1 presents the average TOP1-TOP6 features across
all proficiency levels.

The values of INT items were similar to IND
items, but the TOP3-TOP6 values were slightly
higher than IND items; INT items tended to include
more low frequency words. In order to investigate
the impact of the higher proportion of low frequency
words in INT items, we selected two features (aFreq
and TOP1) and further analyzed them.

Table 9 provides the mean of aFreq and TOP1 for
each score level. The features were generated using
AEST as a reference.

Table 9: Mean of vocabulary profile features for each
score level

On average, the differences between adjacent
score levels in INT items were smaller than those
in IND items. The weaker distinction between score
levels may result in the lower performance of vo-
cabulary profile features in INT items. Particularly,
the differences were smaller in lower score levels (2-
4) than in higher score levels (5-8). The relatively
high proportion of low frequency words in the low
score level reduced the predictive power of vocabu-
lary profile features.

This difference between the item-types strongly
supports item-type-specific modeling. We combined
the IND and INT item responses and computed
a correlation between the features and the profi-
ciency scores over the entirety of data sets. De-
spite increase in sample sizes, the correlations were
lower than both the corresponding correlations of
the IND items and the INT items. For instance, the
correlation of the T2K-SWAL-based aFreq feature
was−0.393, and that of the AEST data-based aFreq
was−0.50, which was approximately 3% lower than
the INT items and 10% lower than the IND items.
The difference in the vocabulary distributions be-
tween the two item-types decreased the performance

187



of the features.
In this study, AEST data-based features outper-

formed T2K-SWAL-based features. Although no
items in the evaluation data overlapped with items
in AEST data, the similarity in the speakers’ profi-
ciency levels and task types might have resulted in
a better match between the vocabulary and its dis-
tributions of AEST data with AEST balanced data,
finally the AEST data-based features achieved the
best performance.

In order to explore the degree to which AEST bal-
anced data (test responses) and the reference cor-
pora matched, we calculated the proportion of word
types that occurred in test responses and reference
corpora (the coverage of reference list). The ASR
hypotheses of AEST balanced data comprised 6,024
word types. GSL covered 73%, T2K-SWAL cov-
ered 99%, and AEST data covered close to 100%.
Considering the fact that, a) despite high coverage
of both T2K-SWAL and AEST data, T2K-SWAL-
based features achieved much lower performance
than AEST data, and, b) despite huge differences
in the coverage between T2K-SWAL and GSL, the
performance of features based on these reference
corpora were comparable, coverage was not likely
to have been a factor having a strong impact on the
performance. The large differences in the perfor-
mance of TOP1 across reference lists support the
possibility of the strong influence of high frequency
word types on proficiency; the kinds of word types
that were in the TOP1 bins were an important factor
that influenced the performance of vocabulary pro-
file features. Finally, genre differences (spoken texts
vs. written texts) in reference corpora did not have
strong impact on the predictive ability of the fea-
tures; the performance of features based on written
reference corpus (GSL) were comparable to those
based on a spoken reference corpus (T2K-SWAL).

Despite the high correlation shown by the indi-
vidual features (such as aFreq), we do not see a cor-
responding increase in the performance of the scor-
ing model with all the best performing features. The
most likely explanation to this is the small training
data size; in each fold, only about 380 responses for
IND and about 760 responses for INT were used
in the scoring model training. Another possibility
is overlap with the existing features; the aspect that
vocabulary profile features are modeling may be al-

ready covered to some extent in existing feature set.
In future research, we will further investigate this as-
pect in details.

7 Conclusions

In this study, we presented features that measure
ESL learners’ vocabulary usage. In particular, we
focused on vocabulary sophistication, and explored
the suitability of vocabulary profile features to cap-
ture sophistication. From three different reference
corpora, the frequency of vocabulary items was cal-
culated which was then used to estimate the sophis-
tication of test takers’ vocabulary. Among the three
different reference corpora, features based on AEST
data, a collections of responses similar to that of the
test set, showed the best performance. A total of 29
features were generated, and the average word fre-
quency (aFreq) achieved the best correlation with
human proficiency scores. In general, vocabulary
profile features showed strong correlations with hu-
man proficiency scores, but when used in an auto-
matic scoring model in combination with an existing
set of predictors of language proficiency, the aug-
mented feature set showed marginal improvement in
predicting human-assigned scores of proficiency.
