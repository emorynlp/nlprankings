Abstract

Syntactic consistency is the preference to
reuse a syntactic construction shortly after its
appearance in a discourse. We present an anal-
ysis of the WSJ portion of the Penn Tree-
bank, and show that syntactic consistency is
pervasive across productions with various left-
hand side nonterminals. Then, we implement
a reranking constituent parser that makes use
of extra-sentential context in its feature set.
Using a linear-chain conditional random field,
we improve parsing accuracy over the gen-
erative baseline parser on the Penn Treebank
WSJ corpus, rivalling a similar model that
does not make use of context. We show that
the context-aware and the context-ignorant
rerankers perform well on different subsets of
the evaluation data, suggesting a combined ap-
proach would provide further improvement.
We also compare parses made by models, and
suggest that context can be useful for parsing
by capturing structural dependencies between
sentences as opposed to lexically governed de-
pendencies.

1 Introduction

Recent corpus linguistics work has produced ev-
idence of syntactic consistency, the preference to
reuse a syntactic construction shortly after its ap-
pearance in a discourse (Gries, 2005; Dubey et al.,
2005; Reitter, 2008). In addition, experimental stud-
ies have confirmed the existence of syntactic prim-
ing, the psycholinguistic phenomenon of syntactic
consistency1. Both types of studies, however, have

limited the constructions that are examined to partic-
ular syntactic constructions and alternations. For in-
stance, Bock (1986) and Gries (2005) examine spe-
cific constructions such as the passive voice, dative
alternation and particle placement in phrasal verbs,
and Dubey et al. (2005) deal with the internal struc-
ture of noun phrases. In this work, we extend these
results and present an analysis of the distribution of
all syntactic productions in the Penn Treebank WSJ
corpus. We provide evidence that syntactic consis-
tency is a widespread phenomenon across produc-
tions of various types of LHS nonterminals, includ-
ing all of the commonly occurring ones.

Despite this growing evidence that the probability
of syntactic constructions is not independent of the
extra-sentential context, current high-performance
statistical parsers (e.g. (Petrov and Klein, 2007; Mc-
Closky et al., 2006; Finkel et al., 2008)) rely solely
on intra-sentential features, considering the partic-
ular grammatical constructions and lexical items
within the sentence being parsed. We address this
by implementing a reranking parser which takes ad-
vantage of features based on the context surrounding
the sentence. The reranker outperforms the genera-
tive baseline parser, and rivals a similar model that
does not make use of context. We show that the
context-aware and the context-ignorant models per-
form well on different subsets of the evaluation data,
suggesting a feature set that combines the two mod-
els would provide further improvement. Analysis of
the rerankings made provides cases where contex-
tual information has clearly improved parsing per-

is a subject of debate. See (Pickering and Branigan, 1999) and
(Gries, 2005) for opposing viewpoints.

2 Syntactic Consistency in the Penn
Treebank WSJ

Syntactic consistency has been examined by Dubey
et al. (2005) for several English corpora, including
the WSJ, Brown, and Switchboard corpora. They
have provided evidence that syntactic consistency
exists not only within coordinate structures, but also
in a variety of other contexts, such as within sen-
tences, between sentences, within documents, and
between speaker turns in the Switchboard corpus.
However, their analysis rests on a selected number
of constructions concerning the internal structure of
noun phrases. We extend their result here to arbi-
trary syntactic productions.

There have also been studies into syntactic con-
sistency that consider all syntactic productions in
dialogue corpora (Reitter, 2008; Buch and Pietsch,
2010). These studies find an inverse correlation be-
tween the probability of the appearance of a syn-

tactic structure and the distance since its last occur-
rence, which indicates syntactic consistency. These
studies, however, do not provide consistency results
on subsets of production-types, such as by produc-
tion LHS as our study does, so the implications that
can be drawn from them for improving parsing are
less apparent.

We adopt the measure used by Dubey et al. (2005)
to quantify syntactic consistency, adaptation prob-
ability. This measure originates in work on lexical
priming (Church, 2000), and quantifies the probabil-
ity of a target word or construction w appearing in a
“primed” context. Specifically, four frequencies are
calculated, based on whether the target construction
appears in the previous context (the prime set), and
whether the construction appears after this context
(the target set):

fp,¬t(w) = # of times w in prime set only

f¬p,t(w) = # of times w in target set only

f¬p,¬t(w) = # of times w in neither set

fp,t(w) = # of times w in both sets

We also define N to be the sum of the four fre-

adaptation probability of a construction as follows

A positive adaptation probability that is greater
than the prior probability would be interpreted as
evidence for syntactic consistency for that construc-
tion. We conduct χ2 tests for statistical signif-
icance testing. We analyze the Penn Treebank
WSJ corpus according this schema for all produc-
tions that occur in sections 2 to 22. These are the
standard training and development sets for train-
ing parsers. We did not analyze section 23 in or-
der not to use its characteristics in designing our
reranking parser so that we can use this section as
our evaluation test set. Our analysis focuses on the
consistency of rules between sentences, so we take
the previous sentence within the same article as the
prime set, and the current sentence as the target set
in calculating the probabilities given above. The
raw data from which we produced our analysis are
available at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/

˜jcheung/wsj_parallelism_data.txt.
We first present results for consistency in all the

production-types2, grouped by the LHS of the pro-
duction. Table 1 shows the weighted average prior
and positive adaptation probabilities for productions
by LHS, where the weighting is done by the num-
ber of occurrence of that production. Production-
types that only occur once are removed. It also
shows the number of production-types in which the
positive adaptation probability is statistically signif-
icantly greater than, not significantly different from,
and significantly lower than the prior probability.

Quite remarkably, very few production-types are
significantly less likely to reoccur compared to the
prior probability. Also note the wide variety of LHSs
for which there is a large number of production-
types that are consistent to a significant degree.
While a large number of production-types appears
not to be significantly more likely to occur in a
primed context, this is due to the large number of
production-types which only appear a few times.
Frequently occurring production-types mostly ex-
hibit syntactic consistency.

We show this in Figure 2, in which we put
non-singleton production-types into ten bins by fre-

types in that bin for which the positive adaptation

clear that the most frequently occurring production-

dence of syntactic consistency.

positive adaptation calculation components for the
ten most frequent production-types and the ten most
consistent (by the ratio pos adapt / prior) produc-
tions among the top decile of production-types. Note
that all of these production-types are consistent to a
statistically significant degree. Interestingly, many
of the most consistent production-types have NP as
the LHS, but overall, productions with many differ-
ent LHS parents exhibit consistency.

3 A Context-Aware Reranker

Having established evidence for widespread syntac-
tic consistency in the WSJ corpus, we now investi-
gate incorporating extra-sentential context into a sta-
tistical parser. The first decision to make is whether
to incorporate the context into a generative or a dis-
criminative parsing model.

Employing a generative model would allow us to
train the parser in one step, and one such parser
which incorporates the previous context has been
implemented by Dubey et al. (2006). They imple-
ment a PCFG, learning the production probabilities
by a variant of standard PCFG-MLE probability es-
timation that conditions on whether a rule has re-
cently occurred in the context or not:

P (RHS|LHS,Prime) =
c(LHS → RHS,Prime)

c(LHS,Prime)

LHS and RHS represent the left-hand side and

26



right-hand side of a production, respectively. Prime
is a binary variable which is True if and only if
the current production has occurred in the prime set
(the previous sentence). c represents the frequency
count.

The drawback of such a system is that it doubles
the state space of the model, and hence likely in-
creases the amount of data needed to train the parser
to a comparable level of performance as a more com-
pact model, or would require elaborate smoothing.
Dubey et al. (2006) find that this system performs
worse than the baseline PCFG-MLE model, drop-
ping F1 from 73.3% to 71.6%3.

We instead opt to incorporate the extra-sentential
context into a discriminative reranking parser, which
naturally allows additional features to be incorpo-
rated into the statistical model. Many discriminative
models of constituent parsing have been proposed in
recent literature. They can be divided into two broad
categories–those that rerank the N-best outputs of a
generative parser, and those that make all parsing de-
cisions using the discriminative model. We choose
to implement an N-best reranking parser so that we
can utilize state-of-the-art generative parsers to en-
sure a good selection of candidate parses to feed
into our reranking module. Also, fully discrimina-
tive models tend to suffer from efficiency problems,
though recent models have started to overcome this
problem (Finkel et al., 2008).

Our approach is similar to N-best reranking
parsers such as Charniak and Johnson (2005)
and Collins and Koo (2005), which implement a va-
riety of features to capture within-sentence lexical
and structural dependencies. It is also similar to
work which focuses on coordinate noun phrase pars-
ing (e.g. (Hogan, 2007; Kübler et al., 2009)) in that
we also attempt to exploit syntactic parallelism, but
in a between-sentence setting rather than in a within-
sentence setting that only considers coordination.

As evidence of the potential of an N-best rerank-
ing approach with respect to extra-sentential con-
text, we considered the 50-best parses in the devel-
opment set produced by the generative parser, and
categorized each into one of nine bins depending
on whether this candidate parse exhibits more, less,

have previously occurred within the same sentence, however,

or the same amount of rule overlap with the previ-
ous correct parse than the generative baseline, and
whether the candidate parse has a better, worse, or
the same F1 measure than the generative baseline
(Table 3). We find that a larger percentage of candi-
date parses which share more productions with the
previous parse are better than the generative base-
line parse than for the other categories, and this dif-
ference is statistically significant (χ2 test).

3.1 Conditional Random Fields

For our statistical reranker, we implement a linear-
chain conditional random field (CRF). CRFs are a
very flexible class of graphical models which have
been used for various sequence and relational la-
belling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001). They have been
used for tree labelling, in XML tree labelling (Jousse
et al., 2006) and semantic role labelling tasks (Cohn
and Blunsom, 2005). They have also been used for
shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003), and full
constituent parsing (Finkel et al., 2008; Tsuruoka et
al., 2009). We exploit the flexibility of CRFs by in-
corporating features that depend on extra-sentential
context.

In a linear-chain CRF, the conditional probabil-
ity of a sequence of labels y = y{t=1...T} given a se-
quence of observed output x = x{t=1...T} and weight
vector θ = θ{k=1...K} is given as follows:

P (y|x) =
1

Z
exp(

T∑

t=1

∑

k

θkfk(yt−1, yt, x, t))

27



where Z is the partition function. The feature func-
tions fk(yt−1, yt, x, t) can depend on two neighbour-
ing parses, the sentences in the sequence, and the
position of the sentence in the sequence. Since our
feature functions do not depend on the words or
the time-step within the sequence, however, we will
write fk(yt−1, yt) from now on.

We treat each document in the corpus as one CRF
sequence, and each sentence as one time-step in
the sequence. The label sequence then is the se-
quence of parses, and the outputs are the sentences
in the document. Since there is a large number of
parses possible for each sentence and correspond-
ingly many possible states for each label variable,
we restrict the possible label state-space by extract-
ing the N-best parses from a generative parser, and
rerank over the sequences of candidate parses thus
provided. We use the generative parser of Petrov
and Klein (2007), a state-splitting parser that uses an
EM algorithm to find splits in the nonterminal sym-
bols to maximize training data likelihood. We use
the 20-best parses, with an oracle F1 of 94.96% on
section 23.

To learn the weight vector, we employ a stochastic
gradient ascent method on the conditional log like-
lihood, which has been shown to perform well for
parsing tasks (Finkel et al., 2008). In standard gra-
dient ascent, the conditional log likelihood with a L2
regularization term for a Gaussian prior for a train-
ing corpus of N sequences is

The first term is the feature counts in the train-
ing data, and the second term is the feature expecta-
tions according to the current weight vector. The
third term corresponds to the penalty to non-zero
weight values imposed by regularization. The prob-
abilities in the second term can be efficiently calcu-
lated by the CRF-version of the forward-backward
algorithm.

In standard gradient ascent, we update the weight
vector after iterating through the whole training cor-
pus. Because this is computationally expensive, we
instead use stochastic gradient ascent, which ap-
proximates the true gradient by the gradient calcu-
lated from a single sample from the training corpus.
We thus do not have to sum over the training set in
the above expressions. We also employ a learning
rate multiplier on the gradient. Thus, the weight up-
date for the ith encountered training sequence during
training is

θ = θ + αi∇Lstochastic(θ)

αi = η
τ ×N

τ ×N + i

The learning rate function is modelled on the one
used by Finkel et al. (2008). It is designed such that
αi is halved after τ passes through the training set.

We train the model by iterating through the train-
ing set in a randomly permuted order, updating the
weight vector after each sequence. The parameters
η, τ , and σ are tuned to the development set. The fi-
nal settings we use are η = 0.08, τ = 5, and σ = 50.
We use sections 2–21 of the Penn Treebank WSJ for
training, 22 for development, and 23 for testing. We
conduct 20-fold cross validation to generate the N-
best parses for the training set, as is standard for N-
best rerankers.

To rerank, we do inference with the linear-chain
CRF for the most likely sequence of parses using
the Viterbi algorithm.

3.2 Feature Functions

We experiment with various feature functions that
depend on the syntactic and lexical parallelism be-
tween yt−1 and yt. We use the occurrence of a rule
in yt that occurred in yt−1 as a feature. Based on the
results of the corpus analysis, the first representation

we tried was to simply enumerate the (non-lexical)
productions in yt along with whether that production
is found in yt−1. However, we found that our most
successful feature function is to consider overlaps in
partial structures of productions.

Specifically, we decompose a tree into all of the
nonlexical vertically and horizontally markovized
subtrees. Each of the subtrees in yt marked by
whether that same subtree occurs in the previous
tree is a feature. The simple production represen-
tation corresponds to a vertical markovization of 1
and a horizontal markovization of infinite. We found
that a vertical markovization of 1 and a horizontal
markovization of 2 produced the best results on our
data. We will call this model the phrasal model.

This schema so far only considers local substruc-
tures of parse trees, without being informed by the
lexical information found in the leaves of the tree.
We try another schema which considers the POS tag
sequences found in each subtree. A feature then is
the node label of the root of the subtree with the POS
tag sequence it dominates, again decomposed into
sequences of length 2 by markovization. We will
call this model the lexical model.

To extract features from this sequence, we con-
sider the substructures in the second parse, and mark
whether they are found in the first parse as well. We
add edge markers to mark the beginning and end of
constituents. See Figure 3 for an example of features

extracted by the two models.
We will consider various ways of combining the

two schemata above in the next section. In addition,
we also add a feature corresponding to the scaled log
probability of a parse tree derived from the genera-
tive parsing baseline. Scaling is necessary because
of the large differences in the magnitude of the log
probability for different sentences. The scaling for-
mula that we found to work best is to scale the max-
imum log probability among the N-best candidate
parses to be 1.0 and the minimum to be 0.0.

3.3 Results

We train the two models which make use of extra-
sentential context described in the previous section,
and use the model to parse the development and
test set. We also trained a model which combines
both sets of features, but we found that we get better
performance by training the two models separately,
then averaging the models by computing the respec-
tive averages of their features’ weights. Thus, we
use the model-averaged version of the models that
consider context in the test set experiments. The
generative parser forms the first baseline method
to which we compare our results. We also train a
reranker which makes use of the same features as we
described above, but without marking whether each
substructure occurs in the previous sentence. This is
thus a reranking method which does not make use
of the previous context. Again, we tried model aver-
aging, but this produces less accurate parses on the

development set, so we use the jointly trained model
on the test set. We will refer to this model as the
context-ignorant or −Context model, as opposed to
the previous context-aware or +Context model. The
results of these experiments on the development set
are shown in Table 4.

PARSEVAL results4 on the development and test
set are presented in Tables 5 and 6. We see that
the reranked models outperform the generative base-
line model in terms of F1, and that the reranked
model that uses extra-sentential context outperforms
the version that does not use extra-sentential context
in the development set, but not in the test set. Us-
ing Bikel’s randomized parsing evaluation compara-
tor5, we find that both reranking models outperform
the baseline generative model to statistical signifi-
cance for recall and precision. The context-ignorant
reranker outperforms the context-aware reranker on
recall (p < 0.01), but not on precision (p = 0.42).
However, the context-aware model has the highest
exact match scores in both the development and the
test set.

The F1 result suggests two possibilities–either the
context-aware model captures the same information
as the context-ignorant model, but less effectively, or
the two models capture different information about

the parses. Two pieces of evidence point to the
latter possibility. First, if the context-aware model
were truly inferior, then we would expect it to out-
perform the context-ignorant model on almost no
sentences. Otherwise, we would expect them to
do well on different sentences. Table 7 shows that
the context-aware model outperforms the context-
ignorant model on nearly as many trees in the test
section as the reverse. Second, if we hypotheti-
cally had an oracle that could determine whether the
context-ignorant or the context-aware model would
be more accurate on a sentence and if the two models
were complementary to each other, we would expect
to achieve a gain in F1 over the generative baseline
which is roughly the sum of the gain achieved by
each model separately. This is indeed the case, as
we are able to achieve F1s of 91.23% and 90.89%
on sections 22 and 23 respectively, roughly twice the
improvement that the individual models obtain.

To put our results in perspective, we now compare
the magnitude of the improvement in F1 our context-

aware model achieves over the generative baseline
to that of other systems specialized to exploit intra-
or extra-sentential parallelism. We achieve a greater
improvement despite the fact that our generative
baseline provides a higher level of performance, and
is presumably thus more difficult to improve upon
(Table 8). These systems do not compare themselves
against a reranked model that does not use paral-
lelism as we do in this work.

During inference, the Viterbi algorithm recov-
ers the most probable sequence of parses, and this
means that we are relying on the generative parser to
provide the context (i.e. the previous parses) when
analyzing any given sentence. We do another type of
oracle analysis in which we provide the parser with
the correct, manually annotated parse tree of the
previous sentence when extracting features for the
current sentence during training and parsing. This
“perfect context” model achieves F1s of 90.42% and
90.00% on sections 22 and 23 respectively, which is
comparable to the best results of our reranking mod-
els. This indicates that the lack of perfect contextual
information is not a major obstacle to further im-
proving parsing performance.

3.4 Analysis

We now analyze several specific cases in the devel-
opment set in which the reranker makes correct use
of contextual information. They concretely illustrate
how context can improve parsing performance, and
confirm our initial intuition that extra-sentential con-
text can be useful for parsing. The sentence in (3)
and (4) is one such case.

(3) Generative/Context-ignorant: (S (S A BMA
spokesman said “runaway medical costs” have

made health insurance “a significant
challenge) ,” and (S margins also have been
pinched ...) (. .))

(4) Context-aware: (S (NP A BMA spokesman)
(VP said “runaway medical costs” have made
health insurance “a significant challenge,” and
margins also have been pinched ...) (. .))

The baseline and the context-ignorant models
parse the sentence as a conjunction of two S clauses,
misanalyzing the scope of what is said by the BMA
spokesman to the first part of the conjunct. By an-
alyzing the features and feature weight values ex-
tracted from the parse sequence, we determined that
the context-aware reranker is able to correct the
analysis of the scoping due to a parallelism in the
syntactic structure. Specifically, the substructure
S → V P. is present in both this sentence and the
previous sentence of the reranked sequence, which
also contains a reporting verb.

(5) (S (NP BMA Corp., Kansas City, Mo.,) (VP
said it’s weighing “strategic alternatives” ...
and is contacting possible buyers ...) (. .))

As a second example, consider the following sen-
tence.

(6) Generative/Context-ignorant: To achieve
maximum liquidity and minimize price
volatility, (NP either all markets) (VP should
be open to trading or none).

(7) Context-aware: To achieve maximum liquidity
and minimize price volatility, (CC either) (S
(NP all markets) should be open to trading or
none).

The original generative and context-ignorant
parses posit that “either all markets” is a noun
phrase, which is incorrect. Syntactic parallelism cor-
rects this for two reasons. First, the reranker prefers
a determiner to start an NP in a consistent context,
as both surround sentences also contain this sub-
structure. Also, the previous sentence also contains
a conjunction CC followed by a S node under a S
node, which the reranker prefers.

While these examples show contextual features to
be useful for parsing coordinations, we also found

31



context-awareness to be useful for other types of
structural ambiguity such as PP attachment ambi-
guity. Notice that the method we employ to cor-
rect coordination errors is different from previous
approaches which usually rely on lexical or syntac-
tic similarity between conjuncts rather than between
sentences. Our approach can thus broaden the range
of sentences that can be usefully reranked. For ex-
ample, there is little similarity between conjuncts to
avail of in the second example (Sentences 6 and 7).

Based on these analyses, it appears that con-
text awareness provides a source of information for
parsing which is not available to context-ignorant
parsers. We should thus consider integrating both
types of features into the reranking parser to build
on the advantages of each. Specifically, within-
sentence features are most appropriate for lexi-
cal dependencies and some structural dependencies.
Extra-sentential features, on the other hand, are ap-
propriate for capturing the syntactic consistency ef-
fects as we have demonstrated in this paper.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we have examined evidence for syn-
tactic consistency between neighbouring sentences.
First, we conducted a corpus analysis of the Penn
Treebank WSJ, and shown that parallelism exists
between sentences for productions with a variety
of LHS types, generalizing previous results for
noun phrase structure. Then, we explored a novel
source of features for parsing informed by the extra-
sentential context. We improved on the parsing ac-
curacy over a generative baseline parser, and rival a
similar reranking model that does not rely on extra-
sentential context. By examining the subsets of
the evaluation data on which each model performs
best and also individual cases, we argue that con-
text allows a type of structural ambiguity resolution
not available to parsers which only rely on intra-
sentential context.
