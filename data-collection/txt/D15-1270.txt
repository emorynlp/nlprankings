Abstract

We present a method of using cohesion to
improve discourse element identification
for sentences in student essays. New fea-
tures for each sentence are derived by con-
sidering its relations to global and local
cohesion, which are created by means of
cohesive resources and subtopic coverage.
In our experiments, we obtain significant
improvements on identifying all discourse
elements, especially of +5% F1 score on
thesis and main idea. The analysis shows
that global cohesion can better capture the-
sis statements.

1 Introduction

Automatic discourse analysis of student essays
can benefit many downstream applications such
as essay rating, text organization assessment and
writing instruction. In this paper we focus on iden-
tifying discourse elements for sentences in persua-
sive essays written by Chinese high school stu-
dents. Discourse elements represent the contribu-
tions that sentences can make to text organization.
Typical discourse elements and their functions in
persuasive writing are summarized in Table 1.

Previous work mainly exploits the properties of
a sentence itself or adjacent sentences for this task.
In this work, we explore cohesion to express re-
lations among sentences through the whole text.
Cohesion can be defined as a set of resources link-
ing within a text that organize the text together
(Halliday and Hasan, 1976). It can be achieved
through the use of reference, ellipsis, substitution,
conjunction and lexical cohesion. Among them,
lexical cohesion has been widely used for mod-
eling local coherence and applied to related ap-
plications (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999; Barzilay
and Lapata, 2008; Galley et al., 2003; Hsueh et al.,
2006; Filippova and Strube, 2006). Since cohesion

is closely related to the structure of text (Morris
and Hirst, 1991), it motivates us to explore similar
techniques for discourse element identification. In
addition, its ease of implementation is also attrac-
tive. Other options for representing text structure
such as full-text discourse parsers (Marcu, 2000)
may be not available or don’t have satisfied per-
formance, especially for non-English languages.

However, modeling local coherence alone is not
adequate to distinguish discourse elements in per-
suasive essays. For example, a main idea may be
followed by a supporting idea sentence. The two
sentences can be coherent but their discourse ele-
ments are different. To deal with this, global cohe-
sion should be exploited. Considering that in per-
suasive writing, thesis, main ideas and conclusion,
which are termed thesis statements by Burstein
et al. (2001), are expected to relate to each other
(Higgins et al., 2004). It is likely that cohesive re-
lations exist among them through the whole text.

We make a focused contribution by investigat-
ing global and local cohesive relations. We create
sentence chains based on cohesive resources and
examine whether the chains represent global co-
hesion or local cohesion. Our hypothesis is that
global cohesion can better capture thesis state-

whelming supporting idea sentences. Experi-
ments were conducted on essays written by Chi-
nese high school students in the mother tongue.
The results confirm our hypothesis. Our method
achieves significant improvements of +%5 F1
score on thesis and main idea sentences by adding
cohesion features. The features related to global
cohesion are most discriminative.

2 Data Annotation

We mainly use the discourse elements defined by
Burstein et al. (2003b) except for adding a prompt
element. The discourse element definitions are
listed in Table 1. We asked two labelers from the
college of liberal art of a university to conduct data
annotation. Provided a detail manual with element
definitions, explanations and examples, the label-
ers assigned a discourse element to each sentence.

We collected three corpora, two of which (C1
and C2) are prompt-directed and one (C3) is
prompt-free. All essays were written by Chinese
high school students in Chinese. The prompt-
directed essays are samples of essays written by
senior high school students when they were tak-
ing a mock examination. The students were re-
quired to write a pervasive essay related to a given
prompt. The prompts of corpora C1 and C2 are
different. The prompt-free essays in C3 were
crawled from an online writing assistance website,
where the essays were used as writing examples
of persuasive essays written by high school stu-
dents. The average essay lengths on three corpora
are 795, 772 and 864 Chinese characters respec-
tively. The other basic statistics of the annotated
corpora are listed in Table 2.

During annotation, the labelers found cases of
difficulties about ambiguous elements. For exam-
ple, content about the prompt and the main thesis
can be mentioned in the same sentence. In such
cases, thesis statements have priority over other el-
ements to be labeled, since identifying thesis state-

ments is more important for some potential appli-
cations (Burstein et al., 2001).

From each corpus, 100 essays were labeled by
both annotators for computing agreements, and
the others were labeled independently. The label
agreements measured with Kappa (Cohen et al.,
1960) are high as shown in Table 2. The disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion. The distri-
butions of discourse elements are also shown in
Table 2. We can see that they are imbalanced.
The supporting idea sentences account for more
than 53%, while the thesis statements account
for only 34% in total. As a result, the distinc-
tion between minority thesis statements from over-
whelming supporting idea sentences is a major
challenge.

3 Discourse Element Identification

Identifying discourse elements in student essays
can be seen as a functional segmentation of dis-
course (Webber et al., 2011). In this work, we fo-
cus on utilizing supervised feature-based machine
learning models for this task.

3.1 Learning Models

Discourse element identification can be casted
as a classification problem that sentences are
classified independently using a classifier, e.g.
naive Bayes (Burstein et al., 2001), decision tree
(Burstein et al., 2003b) and Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs) (Stab and Gurevych, 2014). It can
also be solved in a sequence labeling framework,
which models the whole sentence sequence and
captures the correlations among predictions. For
example, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have
be studied for similar task on argumentative zon-
ing of scientific documents (Guo et al., 2011).

We will evaluate different types of features us-
ing two representative models respectively: the
SVM model and the linear-chain CRF model.

2256



3.2 Basic Features
Before feature extraction, sentence splitting, word
segmentation,POS and NE tagging are done us-
ing a Chinese language processing toolkit (Che
et al., 2010). Most basic features are adapted from
previous work (Burstein et al., 2003a; Stab and
Gurevych, 2014; Persing et al., 2010). For each
sentence, the following feature sets are extracted.
Position features The relative position of its para-
graph (first, last or body) in the essay and its rel-
ative position (first, last or body) in the paragraph
are modeled as a set of binary features. The index
of the sentence is also used as a feature.
Indicator features Cue words/phrases like “我认
为(in my opinion)” and “总之(in conclusion)” are
used as indicators. Partial indicators are adapted
from the ones used by Persing et al. (2010). More
Chinese specific indicators are then augmented
manually. We use a binary feature denoting a ref-
erence to the first person (“我(I)”,“我们(We)”) in
the sentence. We also use a binary feature to in-
dicate whether the sentence contains a modal verb
like “应该(should)” and “希望(hope)”.
Lexical features Binary features are modeled for
all connectives and adverbs, which are identified
based on POS tags.
Structural features The number of words, the
number of clauses in the sentence and the num-
ber of sentences in the same paragraph are used as
features. We also define binary features based on
punctuation which indicate whether the sentence
ends with a full stop, question mark, exclamation
mark or no sentence-final punctuation.
Topic and prompt features For each sentence,
the cosine similarities to the essay title and to the
prompt are used as features.

4 Identification based on Cohesion

4.1 Cohesive Chains
We mainly exploit reference and lexical cohesion.
Creating identity chains Reference refers to re-
sources for referring to a participant whose iden-
tity is recoverable (Schiffrin et al., 2008). We fo-
cus on person identities, because person names
might be mentioned when describing facts. Firstly,
we extract all nouns/entities with a POS/NE tag
person as identities. Secondly, we conduct a sim-
ple third-person pronoun resolution by selecting
the nearest proper antecedent identity within the
same paragraph. Finally, an identity and all its
anaphora together form an identity chain.

Creating lexical chains Lexical cohesion is re-
ferred to relations between text using lexical
repetition, synonymy or near synonymy. We
don’t distinguish between systematic semantic
relations and non-systematic semantic relations
(Berzlánovich et al., 2008) nor use a thesaurus
(Hirst and St-Onge, 1998). Instead, we compute
the relatedness of two words based on their dis-
tributed representations, which are learned using
the Word2Vec toolkit (Mikolov et al., 2013). The
data for learning word representations consists of
student essays and textbooks crawled from the
Web. The vocabulary size is about 490k.

We extract nouns, adjectives and verbs (exclud-
ing auxiliary verbs) instead of using nouns only
(Hirst and St-Onge, 1998) for constructing lexical
chains . We firstly cluster words into clusters in a
graph based manner. Each word corresponds to a
node in a graph. If the relatedness of two words
is larger than a threshold T , they are considered as
related and linked by an edge. After constructing
all edges in this way, every connected subgraph
forms a word cluster. Through the essay, all oc-
currences of the words from the same cluster form
a lexical chain.

We discard identity and lexical chains that exist
within single sentences, since they can’t capture
cohesive relations among sentences.

4.2 Global and Local Sentence Chains

We organize sentences based on cohesive chains.
Sentences that contain members from the same
identity chain or lexical chain form a sentence
chain. The sentence chains represent cohesive re-
lations among sentences.

In persuasive writing, discourse elements are
commonly linked globally. For example, main
ideas are usually related to each other because
they are about different aspects of the main the-
sis, and thesis and conclusion should echo each
other as well. Therefore, we attempt to explic-
itly categorize sentence chains into local chains
and global chains based on subtopic coverage.
A local chain represents sentences that share co-
hesive relations and gather locally within single
subtopics. In contrast, a global chain represents
sentences with cohesive relations distribute across
multiple subtopics. Heuristically, we expect that
thesis statements can be better captured by global
chains, while sentences that state facts or provide
evidences are associated to local chains.

Figure 1: An illustration of global/local sentence
chains. Each solid node in the grid indicates that a
sentence contains a word from a cohesive chain.

Although subtopics can be identified by existing
text segmentation algorithms (Hearst, 1997; Filip-
pova and Strube, 2006), we observe that in stu-
dent essays a subtopic boundary usually coincides
with a paragraph boundary and almost all subtopic
segments are within one paragraph and only a few
of subtopics are within two or more paragraphs.
Therefore, we simply assume that each paragraph
corresponds to a subtopic. Based on the assump-
tion, chain classification is approximated based on
chain span over paragraphs. A sentence chain is
classified as a global chain, if its members appear
in at least N paragraphs, otherwise it is classified
as a local chain. We set N = 3, which means
a global chain would cover at least two subtopics
considering most subtopics finish within two para-
graphs. One sentence can be involved in multiple
sentence chains. An illustration of global and local
sentence chains is shown in Figure 1.

4.3 Cohesion Features from Sentence Chains

We develop cohesion features for a sentence from
the sentence chains that involve it. Such features
are beyond the intrinsic properties of the sentence
itself but describe relations to other sentences.
Chain-type features We consider four combined
types of sentence chains: global-identity, local-
identity, global-lexical and local-lexical chains.
The number of each type of chains that involve the
sentence is used as a feature.
Global-title feature If the sentence is in a global
sentence chain and the corresponding cohesive
chain contains a word in the title, a binary fea-
ture global-title is set as true, otherwise set as
false. Containing globally distributed title words
is thought of as an indicator of thesis statements.
Interaction features Hasan (1984, 1985) defined

that an interaction between two chains takes place
when multiple members of a chain relate in the
same way to more than one members of another
chain, which can be used to distinguish central
tokens from peripheral tokens. Hoey (1991) ex-
plored similar interactions to assess the centrality
of sentences. This indicates that chain interactions
might be signals of important content.

Similarly, we say two sentence chains interact
with each other, if they have more than one sen-
tence in common. An example is shown in Figure
1. Moreover, if two chains are both global chain,
we term it a global interaction, otherwise a local
interaction. The shared sentences by two chains
are named as global or local interaction sentences
accordingly. Two binary features are derived: the
sentence is or not a global-interaction sentence
and it is or not a local-interaction sentence.
Strength features We attempt to measure the
overall strength of the sentence chains that involve
the sentence. The features include the number of
chains, the maximum and average number of cov-
ered sentences and paragraphs over chains, among
which the ones related to paragraphs can be seen
as measuring the global cohesion strength.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Settings

We evaluated the effectiveness of Cohesion fea-
tures by comparing with the baseline that uses the
Basic features introduced in Section 3.2.

We adopted precision(P ), recall(R) and F1-
measure(F1) as evaluation metrics. The thresh-
old T used to determine whether two words are
related was set to 0.8 empirically. Because sen-
tences with the discourse element Other are few,
we didn’t evaluate the performance on it.

We conducted experiments on three corpora re-
spectively using 5-fold cross-validation. We com-
pared various SVM classifiers with different ker-
nels implemented in the LibSVM toolkit (Chang
and Lin, 2011) and the linear-chain CRF model
(Lafferty et al., 2001). When using CRF, the pre-
diction of previous sentence is considered for cur-
rent sentence. In our experiments, CRF achieves
significant superior performance than SVM both
when using basic features alone and after adding
cohesion features. This indicates that incorporat-
ing correlations among sequential predictions are
important for this task. Next, we only report the
experimental results of using the CRF Model.

5.2 Experimental Results

The experimental results on three corpora are
shown in Table 3. We tested statistical signifi-
cance for F1 scores and found that all improve-
ments were significant with p < 0.01 based on
the pairwise t-test. We can see that adding cohe-
sion features obtain improvements on all discourse
elements over three corpora. Especially, the cohe-
sion features contribute to large improvements of
+5.1% and +5.4% average F1 score on identifying
thesis and main idea sentences. By analyzing the
confusion matrix, we found that the improvements
mainly come from more accurately distinguishing
thesis and main idea sentences from introduction
and supporting idea sentences.

We are interested in that which between the lo-
cal and global cohesion contributes more to dis-
tinguish thesis statements. To this end, we used
Area under the ROC Curve (AUC)(Swets, 1988)
to measure the discriminative power of individual
features. Larger AUC of a feature indicates bet-
ter discriminative performance. The experiment
was done on the dataset mixing all sentences from
three corpora. We divided sentences into thesis
statements and non-thesis statements according to
their true element labels. As the results in Ta-
ble 4 show, global cohesion related features are
of higher rank with regard to the discriminative
power. Local cohesion relates more to non-thesis
statements, though it is not so discriminative as
global cohesion. The results indicate that sepa-
rating global cohesion from local cohesion help
the distinction between thesis statements and oth-
ers. Features related to identity chains alone don’t
show much discriminative ability. But they in-
crease the macro F1 score by 0.9% in combina-

6 Conclusion

We have investigated the impact of cohesion for
identifying discourse elements in student essays.
Our method creates sentence chains by means
of cohesive resources and separates global chains
from local ones based on the subtopic coverage.
New features for each sentence are derived from
the properties of the sentence chains involving it.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of co-
hesion features and the discriminative ability of
global cohesion for identifying thesis statements.
