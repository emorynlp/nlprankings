Abstract 

Thai language text presents challenges 
for integration into large-scale multi-
language statistical machine translation 
(SMT) systems, largely stemming from 
the nominal lack of punctuation and in-
ter-word space. For Thai sentence break-
ing, we describe a monolingual maxi-
mum entropy classifier with features that 
may be applicable to other languages 
such as Arabic, Khmer and Lao. We ap-
ply this sentence breaker to our large-
vocabulary, general-purpose, bidirec-
tional Thai-English SMT system, and 
achieve BLEU scores of around 0.20, 
reaching our threshold of releasing it as a 
free online service. 

1 Introduction 
NLP research has consolidated around the notion 
of the sentence as the fundamental unit of trans-
lation, a consensus which has fostered the devel-
opment powerful statistical and analytical ap-
proaches which incorporate an assumption of 
deterministic sentence delineation. As such sys-
tems become more sophisticated, languages for 
which this assumption is challenged receive in-
creased attention. Thai is one such language, 
since it uses space neither to distinguish syl-
lables from words or affixes, nor to unambi-
guously signal sentence boundaries. 

Written Thai has no sentence-end punctuation, 
but a space character is always present between 
sentences. There is generally no space between 
words, but a space character may appear within a 
sentence according to linguistic or prescriptive 
orthographic motivation (Wathabunditkul 2003), 
and these characteristics disqualify sentence-
breaking (SB) methods used for other languages, 
such as Palmer and Hearst (1997). Thai SB has 

therefore been regarded as the task of classifying 
each space that appears in a Thai source text as 
either sentence-breaking (sb) or non-sentence-
breaking (nsb). 

Several researchers have investigated Thai 
SB. Along with a discussion of Thai word break-
ing (WB), Aroonmanakun (2007) examines the 
issue. With a human study, he establishes that 
sentence breaks elicited from Thai informants 
exhibit varying degrees of consensus. Mittra-
piyanuruk and Sornlertlamvanich (2000) define 
part-of-speech (POS) tags for sb and nsb and 
train a trigram model over a POS-annotated cor-
pus. At runtime, they use the Viterbi algorithm 
to select the POS sequence with the highest 
probability, from which the corresponding space 
type is read back. Charoenpornsawat and Sornler-
tlamvanich (2001) apply Winnow, a multiplica-
tive trigger threshold classifier, to the problem. 
Their model has ten features: the number of 
words to the left and right, and the left-two and 
right-two POS tags and words. 

We present a monolingual Thai SB based on a 
maximum entropy (ME) classifier (Ratnaparkhi 
1996; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) which is 
suitable for sentence-breaking SMT training data 
and runtime inputs. Our model uses a four token 
window of Thai lemmas, plus categorical fea-
tures, to describe the proximal environment of 
the space token under consideration, allowing 
runtime classification of space tokens with pos-
sibly unseen contexts. 

As our SB model relies on Thai WB, we re-
view our approach to this problem, plus related 
preprocessing, in the next section. Section 2 also 
discusses the complementary operation to WB, 
namely, the re-spacing of Thai text generated by 
SMT output. Section 3 details our SB model and 
evaluates its performance. We describe the inte-
gration of this work with our large-scale SMT 
system in Section 4. We draw conclusions in 
Section 5.

2 Pre- and Post-processing 
As will be shown in Section 3, our sentence 
breaker relies on Thai WB. In turn, with the aim 
of minimizing WB errors, we perform Unicode 
character sequence normalization prior to WB. 
As output byproducts, our WB analysis readily 
identifies certain types of named entities which 
we propagate into our THA-ENG SMT; in this 
section, we briefly summarize these preliminary 
processing steps, and we conclude the section 
with a discussion of Thai text re-spacing.  

2.1 Character Sequence Normalization 
Thai orthography uses an alphabet of 44 conso-
nants and a number of vowel glyphs and tone 
marks. The four Thai tone marks and some Thai 
vowel characters are super- and/or sub-scripted 
with respect to a base character. For example, 
the อิ ้ sequence consists of three code points: 
อ  ◌ ิ ◌ ้. When two or more of these combining 
marks are present on the same base character, the 
ordering of these code points in memory should 
be consistent so that orthographically identical 
entities are recognized as equivalent by comput-
er systems. However, some computer word pro-
cessors do not enforce the correct sequence or do 
not properly indicate incorrect sequences to the 
user visually. This often results in documents 
with invalid byte sequences. 

Correcting these errors is desirable for SMT 
inputs. In order to normalize Thai input character 
sequences to a canonical Unicode form, we de-
veloped a finite state transducer (FST) which 
detects and repairs a number of sequencing er-
rors which render Thai text either orthographi-
cally invalid, or not in a correct Unicode se-
quence. 

For example, a superscripted Thai tone mark 
should follow a super- or sub-scripted Thai vo-
wel when they both apply to the same consonant. 
When the input has the tone mark and the vowel 
glyph swapped, the input can be fully repaired: 

อ  า  ◌ ่ น →  อ  ◌ ่ า  น  →  อา่น 
อ  ◌ ้ ◌ ิ น  →  อ  ◌ ิ ◌ ้ น  →  อิน้ 

Figure 1. Two unambiguous repairs 

Other cases are ambiguous. The occurrence of 
multiple adjacent vowel glyphs is an error where 
the intention may not be clear. We retain the 
first-appearing glyph, unless it is a pre-posed 
vowel, in which case we retain the last-appearing 

instance. These two treatments are contrasted in 
Figure 2. Miscoding (Figure 3) is another variety 
of input error that is readily repaired. 

จะะา  →  จะ 
ใเไป →  ไป 

Figure 2. Two ambiguous repairs 

Within the Infoquest Thai newswire corpus, a 
low-noise corpus, about 0.05% of the lines exhi-
bit at least one of the problems mentioned here. 
For some chunks of broad-range web scraped 
data, we observe rates as high as 4.1%. This 
measure is expected to under-represent the utility 
of the filter to WB, since Thai text streams, lack-
ing intra-word spacing and permitting two un-
written vowels, have few re-alignment check-
points, allowing tokenization state machines to 
linger in misaligned states. 

อ   ◌ ํ า  →  อ   ◌าํ   →  อํา 
เ   เ   อ  →  แ  อ  →  แอ 

Figure 3. Two common mis-codings 

2.2 Uniscribe Thai Tokenization 
Thai text does not normally use the space cha-
racter to separate words, except in certain specif-
ic contexts. Although Unicode offers the Zero-
Width Space (ZWSP) as one solution for indicat-
ing word breaks in Thai, it is infrequently used. 
Programmatic tokenization has become a staple 
of Thai computational linguistics. The problem 
has been well studied, with precision and recall 
near 95% (Haruechaiyasak et al. 2008).  

In our SMT application, both the sentence 
breaker and the SMT system itself require Thai 
WB, and we use the same word breaker for these 
tasks (although the system design currently pro-
hibits directly passing tokens between these two 
components). Our method is to apply post-
processing heuristics to the output of Uniscribe 
(Bishop et al. 2003), which is provided as part of 
the Microsoft® WindowsTM operating system 
interface. Our heuristics fall into two categories: 
“re-gluing” words that Uniscribe broke too ag-
gressively, and a smaller class of cases of further 
breaking of words that Uniscribe did not break. 

Re-gluing is achieved by comparing Uniscribe 
output against a Thai lexicon in which desired 
breaks within a word are tagged. Underbreaking 
by Uniscribe is less common and is restricted to 
a number of common patterns which are repaired 
explicitly.

2.3 Person Name Entities 
In written Thai, certain types of entities employ 
prescriptive whitespace patterns. By removing 
these recognized patterns from consideration, SB 
precision can be improved. Furthermore, be-
cause our re-gluing procedure requires a lookup 
of every syllable proposed by Uniscribe, it is 
efficient to consider, during WB, additional 
processing that can be informed by the same 
lookup. Accordingly, we briefly mention some 
of the entity types that our WB identifies, focus-
ing on those that incorporate distinctive spacing 
patterns. 

Person names in Thai adhere to a convention 
for the use of space characters. This helps Thai 
readers to identify the boundaries of multi-
syllable surnames that they may not have seen 
before. The following grammar summarizes the 
prescriptive conventions for names appearing in 
Thai text:  
<name-entity> ::= <honorific>  <full-name> 
<full-name> ::= <first-name> [<last-name>] 
<first-name> ::= <name-text> space 
<last-name> ::= <name-text> space 
<name-text> ::= <thai-alphabetic-char>+ 
<thai-alphabetic-char> ::= ก | ข | ฃ | ค | ... 

Figure 4. Name entity recognition grammar 

The re-glue lookup also determines if a sylla-
ble matches one of the following predefined spe-
cial categories: name-introducing honorific (h), 
Thai or foreign given name (g), token which is 
likely to form part of a surname (s), or token 
which aborts the gathering of a name (i.e. is un-
likely to form part of a name).

Figure 5. Thai person-name entity recognition 

Figure 5 shows a Thai name appearing within 
a text fragment, with Uniscribe detected token 
boundaries indicated by slashes. In the third row 
we have identified the special category, if any, 
for each token. The fourth line shows the Eng-
lish translation gloss, or <oov> if none. The bot-
tom row is the desired translation output. 

Our name identifier first notes the presence of 
an honorific {h} นาย followed by a pattern of 
tokens {g0-gn}, {s0-sn} and spaces {sp0, sp1} 
that is compatible with a person name and sur-
name of sensible length. 

Next, we determine which of those tokens in 
the ranges {g} and {s} following the honorific 
do not have a gloss translation (i.e., are not 
found in the lexicon). These tokens are indicated 
by <oov> in the gloss above. When the number 
of unknown tokens exceeds a threshold, we hy-
pothesize that these tokens form a name. The 
lack of lexical morphology in Thai facilitates 
this method because token (or syllable) lookup 
generally equates with the lookup of a stemmed 
lemma. 

2.4 Calendar Date Entities 
Our WB also identifies Thai calendar dates, as 
these also exhibit a pattern which incorporates 
spaces. As a prerequisite to identifying dates, we 
map Thai orthographic digits {๐ ๑ ๒ ๓ ๔ ๕ ๖ 
๗ ๘ ๙} to Arabic digits 0 through 9, respec-
tively. For example, our system would interpret 
the input text ๒๕๔๐ as equivalent to “2540.” 

.../ใน/วนั/ที/่ /14/ มนีาคม/ /๒๕๔๐/ /และ/...
ใน วนั ที่ sp 14 มนีาคม sp ๒๕๔๐ sp และ 
on day which  14 March  2540  and 

...on March 14th, 1997 and... 

Figure 6. Date entity recognition 

Figure 6 shows a fragment of Thai text which 
contains a calendar date for which our system 
will emit a single token. As shown in the exam-
ple, our system detects and adjusts for the use of 
Thai Buddhist year dates when necessary. Ga-
thering of disparate and optional parts of the 
Thai date is summarized by the grammar in Fig-
ure 7. 
<date-entity> ::= [<cardinal-words>] [space] <date> 
<cardinal-words> ::= วนัที ่| ที ่
<date> ::= month-date [space] year 
<year> ::= <tha-digit> <tha-digit> <tha-digit> <tha-digit> 
<year> ::= <ara-digit> <ara-digit> <ara-digit> <ara-digit> 
<month-date> ::= <day> [space] <month> 
<day> ::= <thai-digit>+ 
<day> ::= <ara-digit>+ 
<month> ::= <month-full> | <month-abbr> 
<month-full> ::= มกราคม | กมุภาพันธ ์| มนีาคม | ... 
<month-abbr> ::= ม.ค. | ก.พ. | ม.ีค. | ... 
<tha-digit> ::= ๐ | ๑ | ๒ | ๓ | ๔ | ๕ | ๖ | ๗ | ๘ | ๙ 
<ara-digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

2.5 Thai Text Re-spacing 
To conclude this section, we mention an opera-
tion complementary to Thai WB, whereby Thai 
words output by an SMT system must be re-
spaced in accordance with Thai prescriptive 
convention. As will be mentioned in Section 4.2, 
for each input sentence, our English-Thai system 
has access to an English dependency parse tree, 
as well as links between this tree and a Thai 
transfer dependency tree. After using these links 
to transfer syntactic information to the Thai tree, 
we are able to apply prescriptive spacing rules 
(Wathabunditkul 2003) as closely as possible. 
Human evaluation showed satisfactory results 
for this process. 

3 Maximum Entropy Sentence-Breaking 
We now turn to a description of our statistical 
sentence-breaking model. We train an ME clas-
sifier on features which describe the proximal 
environment of the space token under considera-
tion and use this model at runtime to classify 
space tokens with possibly unseen contexts. 

3.1 Modeling 
Under the ME framework, let B={sb, nsb} 
represent the set of possible classes we are inter-
ested in predicting for each space token in the 
input stream. Let C={linguistic contexts} 
represent the set of possible contexts that we can 
observe, which must be encoded by binary fea-
tures, 𝑓 (𝑏, 𝑐), 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘, such as: 𝑓 (𝑏, 𝑐) =  1 if the previous word is English 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑏 = 𝐧𝐬𝐛.0 otherwise.  
This feature helps us learn that the space after an 
English word is usually not a sentence boundary. 

𝑓 (𝑏, 𝑐) =  1 if the distance to the previous honorific is less than 15 tokens 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏 = 𝐧𝐬𝐛0 otherwise.  
This feature enables us to learn that spaces 
which follow an honorific are less likely to mark 
sentence boundaries. Assume the joint probabili-
ty p(b,c) is modeled by 𝑝(𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝑍 𝜶 ( , ) 
where we have k free parameters {𝜶 }  to esti-
mate and Z is a normalization factor to make ∑ 𝑝(𝑏, 𝑐) = 1.,  The ME learning algorithm 

finds a solution {𝜶 } representing the most un-
certain commitment max  𝐻(𝑝) = − 𝑝(𝑏, 𝑐) log 𝑝(𝑏, 𝑐)  
that satisfies the observed distribution �̂�(𝑏, 𝑐) of 
the training data 
   ∑ 𝑝(𝑏, 𝑐)𝑓 (𝑏, 𝑐) = ∑ �̂�(𝑏, 𝑐)𝑓 (𝑏, 𝑐), 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘 . 
This is solved via the Generalized Iterative Scal-
ing algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff 1972). At 
run-time, a space token is considered an sb, if 
and only if p(sb|c) > 0.5, where 𝑝(𝒔𝒃|𝑐) = 𝑝(𝒔𝒃, 𝑐)𝑝(𝒔𝒃, 𝑐) + 𝑝(𝒏𝒔𝒃, 𝑐) . 
3.2 Feature Selection 
The core context of our model, {w, x, y, z}, is a 
window spanning two tokens to the left (posi-
tions w and x) and two tokens to the right (posi-
tions y and z) of a classification candidate space 
token. 

c token characteristic 
yk Yamok (syllable reduplication) symbol ๆ 
sp space 
๐๙ Thai numeric digits 
num Arabic numeric digits 
ABC Sequence of all capital ASCII characters 
cnn single character (derived from hex) 
ckkmmnn single character (derived from UTF8 hex) 
ascii any amount of non-Thai text 
(Thai text) Thai word (derived from lemma) 

Table 1. Categorical and derived feature names 

The possible values of each of the window 
positions {w, x, y, z} are shown in Table 1, 
where the first match to the token at the desig-
nated position is assigned as the feature value for 
that position. Foreign-text tokens plus any inter-
vening space are merged, so a single “ascii” fea-
ture may represent an arbitrary amount of non-
Thai script with interior space. 

Figure 8 shows an example sentence that has 
been tokenized. Token boundaries are indicated 
by slashes. Although there are three space tokens 
in the original input, we extract four contexts. 
The shaded boxes in the source text—and the 
shaded line in the figure—indicate the single sb 
context that is synthesized by wrapping, to be 
described in Section 3.4. 

For each context, in addition to the {w, x, y, z} 
features, we extract two more features indicated 
by {l ,r} in Figure 8. They are the number of 

11



tokens between the previous space token (wrap-
ping as necessary) and the current one, and the 
number of tokens between the current space to-
ken and the next space token (wrapping as ne-
cessary). These features do not distinguish 
whether the bounding space token is sb or nsb. 
This is because, processing left-to-right, it is 
permissible to use a feature such as “number of 
tokens since last sb,” but not “number of tokens 
until next sb,” which would be available during 
training but not at runtime.

Figure 8. A Thai sentence and the training contexts extracted. Hig-
hlighting shows the context for sb.  

In addition to the above core features, our 
model emits certain extra features only if they 
appear: 
• An individual feature for each English punc-

tuation mark, since these are sometimes used 
in Thai. For example, there is one feature for 
the sentence end period (i.e. full-stop); 

• The current nest depth for paired glyphs with 
directional variation, such as brackets, braces, 
and parentheses; 

• The current parity value for paired glyphs 
without directional distinction such as 
“straight” quotation marks. 

The following example illustrates paired direc-
tional glyphs (in this case, parentheses):

 b c=w c=x c=y c=z c=pn 

nsb ( ประเทศ ไทย ) 1 
Figure 9. Text fragment illustrating paired directional glyphs and 

the context for the highlighted space 

     In Figure 9, the space between ประเทศ 
“country” and ไทย “Thai,” generates an nsb 
context which includes the features shown, 
where “pn” is an extra feature which indicates 

the parenthesis nesting level. This feature helps 
the model learn that spaces which occur within 
parentheses are likely to be nsb. 

Parity features for the non-directional paired 
glyphs, which do nest, are true binary features. 
Since these features have only two possible val-
ues (inside or outside), they are only emitted 
when their value is “inside,” that is, when the 
space under consideration occurs between such a 
pair. 

3.3 Sentence Breaker Training Corpus 
Thai corpora which are marked with sentence 
breaks are required for training. We assembled a 
corpus of 361,802 probable sentences. This cor-
pus includes purchased, publicly available, and 
web-crawled content. In total it contains 911,075 
spaces, a figure which includes one inter-
sentence space per sentence, generated as de-
scribed below. 

3.4 Out-of-context Sentences 
For SB training, paragraphs are first tokenized 
into words as described in Section 2.2. This 
process does not introduce new spaces between 
tokens; only original spaces in the text are classi-
fied as sb/nsb and used for the context features 
described below. To keep this distinction clear, 
token boundaries are indicated by a slash rather 
than space in the examples shown in this paper. 

For 91% of our training sentences, the para-
graphs from which they originate are inaccessi-
ble. In feature extraction for each of these sen-
tences, we wrap the sentence’s head around to its 
tail to obtain its sb context. In other words, for a 
sentence of tokens t0-tn-1, the context of sb (the 
last space) is given by 

{ w=tn-2, x=tn-1, y=t0, z=t1 }. 

     This process was illustrated in Figure 8. Al-
though not an ideal substitute for sentences in 
context, this ensures that we extract at least one 
sb context per sentence. The number of nsb con-
texts extracted per sentence is equal to the num-
ber of interior space tokens in the original sen-
tence. Sentence wrapping is not needed when 
training with sentence-delimited paragraph 
sources. Contexts sb and nsb are extracted from 
the token stream of the entire paragraph and 
wrapping is used only to generate one additional 
sb for the entire paragraph.

3.5 Sentence Breaker Evaluation 
Although evaluation against a single-domain 
corpus does not measure important design re-
quirements of our system, namely resilience to 
broad-domain input texts, we evaluated against 
the ORCHID corpus (Charoenporn et al. 1997) 
for the purpose of comparison with the existing 
literature. Following the methodology of the stu-
dies cited below, we use 10-fold ×10% averaged 
testing against the ORCHID corpus. 

Our results are consistent with recent work us-
ing the Winnow algorithm, which itself com-
pares favorably with the probabilistic POS tri-
gram approach. Both of these studies use evalua-
tion metrics, attributed to Black and Taylor 
(1997), which aim to more usefully measure sen-
tence-breaker utility. Accordingly, the following 
definitions are used in Table 2: space-correct =  (#correct sb+#correct nsb)total # of space tokens  

false break= #sb false positivestotal # of space tokens 
     It was generally possible to reconstruct preci-
sion and recall figures from these published re-
sults1 and we present a comprehensive table of 
results. Reconstructed values are marked with a 
dagger and the optimal result in each category is 
marked in boldface.

text authors may intentionally include or omit 
spaces in order to create syntactic or semantic 
ambiguity. We defer to Mittrapiyanuruk and 
Sornlertlamvanich (2000) and Aroonmanakun 
(2007) for informed commentary on this topic. 

4 SMT System and Integration 
The primary application for which we developed 
the Thai sentence breaker described in this work 
is the Microsoft® BING™ general-domain ma-
chine translation service. In this section, we pro-
vide a brief overview of this large-scale SMT 
system, focusing on Thai-specific integration 
issues. 

4.1 Overview 
Like many multilingual SMT systems, our sys-
tem is based on hybrid generative/discriminative 
models. Given a sequence of foreign words, f, its 
best translation is the sequence of target words, 
e, that maximizes  𝒆∗ = argmax𝒆 𝑝(𝒆|𝒇) =  argmax𝒆 𝑝(𝒇|𝒆)𝑝(𝒆) = argmaxe  { log 𝑝(𝒇|𝒆) + log 𝑝(𝒆)} 
where the translation model 𝑝(𝒇|𝒆) is computed 
on dozens to hundreds of features. The target 
language model (LM), 𝑝(𝒆), is represented by a 
smoothed n-grams (Chen 1996) and sometimes 
more than one LM is adopted in practice. To 
achieve the best performance, the log likelihoods 
evaluated by these features/models are linearly 
combined. After 𝑝(𝒇|𝒆) and 𝑝(𝒆) are trained, the 
combination weights 𝜆  are tuned on a held-out 
dataset to optimize an objective function, which 
we set to be the BLEU score (Papineni et al. 
2002): {𝜆∗} = max{ }  BLEU({𝑒∗}, {𝑟}) 𝒆∗ =  argmaxe  { 𝜆 log 𝑝 (𝒇|𝒆) + 𝜆 log 𝑝 (𝒆)} 
where {r} is the set of gold translations for the 
given input source sentences. To learn 𝜆  we use 
the algorithm described by Och (2003), where 
the decoder output at any point is approximated 
using n-best lists, allowing an optimal line 
search to be employed. 

4.2 Phrasal and Treelet Translation 
Since we have a high-quality real-time rule-
based English parser available, we base our Eng-

13



lish-to-Thai translation (ENG-THA) on the 
“treelet” concept suggested in Menezes and 
Quirk (2008). This approach parses the source 
language into a dependency tree which includes 
part-of-speech labels.  
   Lacking a Thai parser, we use a purely statis-
tical phrasal translator after Pharaoh (Koehn 
2004) for THA-ENG translation, where we 
adopt the name and date translation described in 
Sections 2.3 and 2.4.  
     We also experimented with phrasal ENG-
THA translation. Though we actually achieved a 
slightly better BLEU score than treelet for this 
translation direction, qualitative human evalua-
tion by native speaker informants was mixed. 
We adopted the treelet ENG-THA in the final 
system, for its better re-spacing (Section 2.5). 

4.3 Training, Development and Test Data 
Naturally, our system relies on parallel text cor-
pora to learn the mapping between two languag-
es. The parallel corpus contains sentence pairs, 
corresponding to translations of each other. For 
Thai, quality corpora are generally not available 
in sufficient quality for training a general-
domain SMT system. For the ENG-THA pair, 
we resort to Internet crawls as a source of text. 
We first identify paired documents, break each 
document into sentences, and align sentences in 
one document against those in its parallel docu-
ment. Bad alignments are discarded. Only sen-
tence pairs with high alignment confidence are 
kept in our parallel corpus. Our sentence align-
ment algorithm is based on Moore (2002). 

For our ENG-THA translation system, we as-
sembled three resources: a parallel training cor-
pus, a development bitext (also called the lamb-
da set) for training the feature combination 
weights {𝜆 }, and a test corpus for BLEU and 
human evaluation. Both the lambda and the test 
sets have single reference translations per sen-
tence.

Although it is well known that language trans-
lation pairs are not symmetric, we use these 
same resources to build our THA-ENG transla-
tion system due to the lack of additional corpora.  

Our parallel MT corpus consists of approx-
imately 725,000 English-Thai sentence pairs 
from various sources. Additionally we have 9.6 
million Thai sentences, which are used to train a 
Thai 4-gram LM for ENG-THA translation, to-
gether with the Thai sentences in the parallel 
corpus. Trigrams and 4-grams that occur only 
once are pruned, and n-gram backoff weights are 
re-normalized after pruning, with the surviving 
KN smoothed probabilities intact (Kneser and 
Ney 1995). Similarly, a 4-gram ENG LM is 
trained for THA-ENG translation, on a total of 
45.6M English sentences. 

For both the lambda and test sets, THA LM 
incurs higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates 
(1.6%) than ENG LM (0.7%), due to its smaller 
training set and thus smaller lexicon. Both trans-
lation directions define the maximum 
phrase/treelet length to be 4 and the maximum 
re-ordering jump to be 4 as well. 

4.4 BLEU Scores 
To evaluate our end-to-end performance, we 
compute case insensitive 4-gram BLEU scores. 
Translation outputs are WB first according to the 
Thai/English tokenizer, before BLEU scores are 
computed. The BLEU scores on the test sets are 
shown in Table 4. We are not aware of any pre-
viously published BLEU results for either direc-
tion of this language pair. 

  BLEU 
THA-ENG 0.233 
ENG-THA 0.194

the each translation direction, with reference

Although the translation quality is far from being 
perfect, SMT is making good process on build-
ing useful applications. 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 
Our maximum entropy model for Thai sentence-
breaking achieves results which are consistent 
with contemporary work in this task, allowing us 
to overcome this obstacle to Thai SMT integra-
tion. This general approach can be applied to 
other South-East Asian languages in which space 
does not deterministically delimit sentence 
boundaries. 

In Arabic writing, commas are often used to 
separate sentences until the end of a paragraph 
when a period is finally used. In this case, the 
comma character is similar to the space token in 
Thai where its usage is ambiguous. We can use 
the same approach (perhaps with different lin-
guistic features) to identify which commas are 
sentence-breaking and which are not. 

Our overall system incorporates a range of in-
dependent solutions to problems in Thai text 
processing, including character sequence norma-
lization, tokenization, name and date identifica-
tion, sentence-breaking, and Thai text re-
spacing. We successfully integrated each solu-
tion into an existing large-scale SMT frame-
work, obtaining sufficient quality to release the 
Thai-English language pair in a high-volume, 
general-domain, free public online service. 

There remains much room for improvement. 
We need to find or create true Thai-English di-
rectional corpora to train the lambdas and to test 
our models. The size of our parallel corpus for 
Thai should increase by at least an order of mag-
nitude, without loss of bitext quality. With a 
larger corpus, we can consider longer phrase 
length, higher-order n-grams, and longer re-
ordering distance.
