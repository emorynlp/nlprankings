Abstract
A major challenge in document clustering re-
search arises from the growing amount of text
data written in different languages. Previ-
ous approaches depend on language-specific
solutions (e.g., bilingual dictionaries, sequen-
tial machine translation) to evaluate document
similarities, and the required transformations
may alter the original document semantics. To
cope with this issue we propose a new docu-
ment clustering approach for multilingual cor-
pora that (i) exploits a large-scale multilingual
knowledge base, (ii) takes advantage of the
multi-topic nature of the text documents, and
(iii) employs a tensor-based model to deal with
high dimensionality and sparseness. Results
have shown the significance of our approach
and its better performance w.r.t. classic docu-
ment clustering approaches, in both a balanced
and an unbalanced corpus evaluation.

1 Introduction
Document clustering research was initially focused on
the development of general purpose strategies to group
unstructured text data. Recent studies have started de-
veloping new methodologies and algorithms that take
into account both linguistic and topical characteristics,
where the former include the size of the text and the
type of language, and the latter focus on the commu-
nicative function and targets of the documents.

A major challenge in document clustering research
arises from the growing amount of text data that are
written in different languages, also due to the increased
popularity of a number of tools for collaboratively edit-
ing through contributors across the world. Multilingual
document clustering (MDC) aims to detect clusters in a
collection of texts written in different languages. This
can aid a variety of applications in cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval, including statistical machine transla-
tion and corpora alignment.

Existing approaches to MDC can be divided in two
broad categories, depending on whether a parallel cor-
pus rather than a comparable corpus is used (Kumar et
al., 2011c). A parallel corpus is typically comprised
of documents with their related translations (Kim et
al., 2010). These translations are usually obtained

through machine translation techniques based on a se-
lected anchor language. Conversely, a comparable cor-
pus is a collection of multilingual documents written
over the same set of classes (Ni et al., 2011; Yo-
gatama and Tanaka-Ishii, 2009) without any restric-
tion about translation or perfect correspondence be-
tween documents. To mine this kind of corpus, external
knowledge is employed to map concepts or terms from
a language to another (Kumar et al., 2011c; Kumar
et al., 2011a), which enables the extraction of cross-
lingual document correlations. In this case, a major
issue lies in the definition of a cross-lingual similarity
measure that can fit the extracted cross-lingual correla-
tions. Also, from a semi-supervised perspective, other
works attempt to define must-link constraints to de-
tect cross-lingual clusters (Yogatama and Tanaka-Ishii,
2009). This implies that, for each different dataset, the
set of constraints needs to be redefined; in general, the
final results can be negatively affected by the quantity
and the quality of involved constraints (Davidson et al.,
2006).

To the best of our knowledge, existing clustering ap-
proaches for comparable corpora are customized for a
small set (two or three) of languages (Montalvo et al.,
2007). Most of them are not generalizable to many
languages as they employ bilingual dictionaries and
the translation is performed sequentially considering
only pairs of languages. Therefore, the order in which
this process is done can seriously impact the results.
Another common drawback concerns the way most
of the recent approaches perform their analysis: the
various languages are analyzed independently of each
other (possibly by exploiting external knowledge like
Wikipedia to enrich documents (Kumar et al., 2011c;
Kumar et al., 2011a)), and then the language-specific
results are merged. This two-step analysis however
may fail in profitably exploiting cross-language infor-
mation from the multilingual corpus.

Contributions. We address the problem of MDC
by proposing a framework that features three key ele-
ments, namely: (1) to model documents over a unified
conceptual space, with the support of a large-scale mul-
tilingual knowledge base; (2) to decompose the mul-
tilingual documents into topically-cohesive segments;
and (3) to describe the multilingual corpus under a
multi-dimensional data structure.

The first key element prevents loss of information
due to the translation of documents from different lan-
guages to a target one. It enables a conceptual represen-
tation of the documents in a language-independent way
preserving the content semantics. BabelNet (Navigli
and Ponzetto, 2012a) is used as multilingual knowl-
edge base. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the
first work in MDC that exploits BabelNet.

The second key element, document segmentation,
enables us to simplify the document representation
according to their multi-topic nature. Previous re-
search has demonstrated that a segment-based ap-
proach can significantly improve document clustering
performance (Tagarelli and Karypis, 2013). More-
over, the conceptual representation of the document
segments enables the grouping of linguistically dif-
ferent (portions of) documents into topically coherent
clusters.

The latter aspect is leveraged by the third key ele-
ment of our proposal, which relies on a tensor-based
model (Kolda and Bader, 2009) to effectively handle
the high dimensionality and sparseness in text. Ten-
sors are considered as a multi-linear generalization of
matrix factorizations, since all dimensions or modes
are retained thanks to multi-linear structures which can
produce meaningful components. The applicability of
tensor analysis has recently attracted growing atten-
tion in information retrieval and data mining, including
document clustering (e.g., (Liu et al., 2011; Romeo
et al., 2013)) and cross-lingual information retrieval
(e.g., (Chew et al., 2007)).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides an overview of BabelNet and basic no-
tions on tensors. We describe our proposal in Section 3.
Data and experimental settings are described in Sec-
tion 4, while results are presented in Section 5. We
summarize our main findings in Section 6, finally Sec-
tion 7 concludes the paper.

2 Background
2.1 BabelNet
BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a) is a multilin-
gual semantic network obtained by linking Wikipedia
with WordNet, that is, the largest multilingual Web en-
cyclopedia and the most popular computational lex-
icon. The linking of the two knowledge bases was
performed through an automatic mapping of WordNet
synsets and Wikipages, harvesting multilingual lexi-
calization of the available concepts through human-
generated translations provided by the Wikipedia inter-
language links or through machine translation tech-
niques. The result is an encyclopedic dictionary con-
taining concepts and named entities lexicalized in 50
different languages.

Multilingual knowledge in BabelNet is represented
as a labeled directed graph in which nodes are concepts
or named entities and edges connect pairs of nodes
through a semantic relation. Each edge is labeled with a

relation type (is-a, part-of, etc.), while each node corre-
sponds to a BabelNet synset, i.e., a set of lexicalizations
of a concept in different languages.

BabelNet can be accessed and easily integrated into
applications by means of a Java API provided by the
toolkit described in (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012b).
The toolkit also provides functionalities for graph-
based WSD in a multilingual context. Given an in-
put set of words, a semantic graph is built by looking
for related synset paths and by merging all them in a
unique graph. Once the semantic graph is built, the
graph nodes can be scored with a variety of algorithms.
Finally, this graph with scored nodes is used to rank the
input word senses by a graph-based approach.

2.2 Tensor model representation
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array T ∈
<I1×I2×···×IM . The number of dimensions M , also
known as ways or modes, is called order of the ten-
sor, so that a tensor with order M is also said a M -
way or M -order tensor. A higher-order tensor (i.e., a
tensor with order three or higher) is denoted by bold-
face calligraphic letters, e.g., T ; a matrix (2-way ten-
sor) is denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g., U;
a vector (1-way tensor) is denoted by boldface low-
ercase letters, e.g., v. The generic entry (i1, i2, i3)
of a third-order tensor T is denoted by ti1i2i3 , with
i1 ∈ [1..I1], i2 ∈ [1..I2], i3 ∈ [1..I3].

A one-dimensional fragment of tensor, defined by
varying one index and keeping the others fixed, is a
1-way tensor called fiber. A third-order tensor has
column, row and tube fibers. Analogously, a two-
dimensional fragment of tensor, defined by varying two
indices and keeping the rest fixed, is a 2-way tensor
called slice. A third-order tensor has horizontal, lateral
and frontal slices.

The mode-m matricization of a tensor T , denoted
by T(m), is obtained by arranging the mode-m fibers
as columns of a matrix. A third-order tensor T ∈
<I1×I2×I3 is all-orthogonal if ∑i1i2 ti1i2αti1i2β =∑
i1i3

ti1αi3ti1βi3 =
∑
i2i3

tαi2i3tβi2i3 = 0 when-
ever α 6= β. The mode-m product of a tensor T ∈
<I1×I2×···×IM with a matrix U ∈ <J×Im , denoted by
T ×m U, is a tensor of dimension I1 × . . . Im−1 ×
J × Im+1 × · · · × IM and can be expressed in terms
of matrix product as Y = T ×m U, whose mode-m
matricization is Y(m) = UT(m).

3 Our Proposal

3.1 Multilingual Document Clustering
framework

We are given a collection of multilingual documents
D = ⋃Ll=1Dl, where each Dl = {dli}Nli=1 represents a
subset of documents written in the same language, with
N =

∑L
l=1Nl = |D|. Our framework can be applied

to any multilingual document collection regardless of
the languages, and can deal with balanced as well as

601



Algorithm 1 SeMDocT (Segment-based MultiLingual
Document Clustering via Tensor Modeling)
Input: A collection of multilingual documents D, the num-

ber k of segment clusters, the number of tensorial com-
ponents r.

Output: A document clustering solution C over D.
1: Apply a text segmentation algorithm over each of the

documents inD to produce a collection of document seg-
ments S. /* Section 3.1.1 */

2: Represent S in either a bag-of-words (BoW) or a bag-of-
synsets (BoS) space. /* Section 3.1.2 */

3: Apply any document clustering algorithm on S to obtain
a segment clustering CS = {Csi }ki=1. /* Section 3.1.2 */

4: Represent CS in either a bag-of-words (BoW) or a bag-
of-synsets (BoS) space. /* Section 3.1.3 */

5: Model S as a third-order tensor T ∈ <I1×I2×I3 , with
I1 = |D|, I2 = |F|, and I3 = k. /* Section 3.1.4 */

6: Decompose the tensor using a Truncated HOSVD.
/* Section 3.1.4 */

7: Apply a document clustering algorithm on the mode-1
factor matrix to obtain the final clusters of documents
C = {Ci}Ki=1. /* Section 3.1.5 */

unbalanced corpora. Therefore, no restriction is given
on both the number L of languages and the distribution
of documents over the languages (i.e., Ni Q Nj , with
i, j = 1..L, i 6= j).

Real-world documents often span multiple topics.
We assume that each document in D is relatively long
to be comprised of smaller textual units, or segments,
each of which can be considered cohesive w.r.t. a topic
over the document. This represents a key aspect in
our framework as it enables the use of a tensor model
to conveniently address the multi-faceted nature of the
documents.

Our overall framework, named SeMDocT (Segment-
based MultiLingual Document Clustering via Tensor
Modeling), is shown in Algorithm 1. In the following,
we shall describe in details each of the steps involved
in SeMDocT.

3.1.1 Computing within-document segments

Text segmentation is concerned with the fragmentation
of an input text into multi-paragraph, contiguous and
disjoint blocks that represent subtopics. Regardless of
the presence of logical structure clues in the document,
linguistic criteria (Beeferman et al., 1999) and statis-
tical similarity measures (Hearst, 1997; Choi et al.,
2001; Cristianini et al., 2001) have been mainly used to
detect subtopic boundaries between segments. A com-
mon assumption is that terms that discuss a subtopic
tend to co-occur locally, and a switch to a new subtopic
is detected by the ending of co-occurrence of a given
set of terms and the beginning of the co-occurrence of
another set of terms.

Our SeMDocT does not depend on a specific algo-
rithmic choice to perform text segmentation; in this
work, we refer to the classic TextTiling (Hearst, 1997),
which is the exemplary similarity-block-based method
for text segmentation.

3.1.2 Inducing document segment clusters
The result of the previous step is a collection of doc-
ument segments, henceforth denoted as S. Each seg-
ment in S is represented as a vector of feature oc-
currences, where a feature can be either lexical or se-
mantic. This corresponds to two alternative represen-
tation models: the standard bag-of-words (henceforth
BoW), whereby features correspond to lemmatized,
non-stopword terms, and the obtained feature space
results from the union of the vocabularies of the dif-
ferent languages; and bag-of-synsets (henceforth BoS),
whereby features correspond to BabelNet synsets. We
shall devote Section 3.2 to a detailed description of our
proposed BoS representation.

The segment collection S is given in input to a doc-
ument clustering algorithm to produce a clustering of
the segments CS = {Csi }ki=1. The obtained clusters
of segments can be disjoint or overlapping. Again, our
SeMDocT is parametric to the clustering algorithm as
well; here, we resort to a state-of-the-art clustering al-
gorithm, namely Bisecting K-Means (Steinbach et al.,
2000), which is widely known to produce high-quality
(hard) clustering solutions in high-dimensional, large
datasets (Zhao and Karypis, 2004). Note however
that it requires as input the number of clusters. To
cope with this issue, we adopt the method described
in (Salvador and Chan, 2004), which explores how the
within-cluster cohesion changes by varying the number
of clusters. The number of clusters for which the slope
of the plot changes drastically is chosen as a suitable
value for the clustering algorithm.

3.1.3 Segment-cluster based representation
Upon the segment clustering, each document is repre-
sented by its segments assigned to possibly multiple
segment clusters. Therefore, we derive a document-
feature matrix for each of the k segment clusters. The
features correspond either to the BoW or BoS model,
according to the choice made for the segment represen-
tation.

Let us denote with F the feature space for all seg-
ments in S. Given a segment cluster Cs, the cor-
responding document-feature matrix is constructed as
follows. The representation of each document d ∈ D
w.r.t. Cs is a vector of length |F| that results from the
sum of the feature vectors of the d’s segments belong-
ing to Cs. Moreover, in order to weight the appearance
of a document in a cluster based on its segment-based
portion covered in the cluster, the document vector of d
w.r.t. Cs is finally obtained by multiplying the sum of
the segment-vectors by a scalar representing the portion
of d’s features that appear in the segments belonging to
Cs. The document-feature matrix of Cs resulting from
the previous step is finally normalized by column.

3.1.4 Tensor model and decomposition
The document-feature matrices corresponding to the k
segment-clusters are used to form a third-order tensor.

Figure 1: The third-order tensor model for the repre-
sentation of a multilingual document collection based
on segment clusters.

Our third-order tensor model is built by arranging
as frontal slices the k segment-cluster matrices. The
resulting tensor will be of the form T ∈ <I1×I2×I3 ,
with I1 = |D|, I2 = |F|, and I3 = k. The proposed
tensor model is sketched in Fig. 1.

The resulting tensor is decomposed through a Trun-
cated Higher Order SVD (T-HOSVD) (Lathauwer et
al., 2000) in order to obtain a low-dimensional rep-
resentation of the segment-cluster-based representation
of the document collection. The T-HOSVD can be con-
sidered as an extension of the Truncated Singular Value
Decomposition (T-SVD) to the case of three or more
dimensions. For a third-order tensor T ∈ <I1×I2×I3
the T-HOSVD is expressed as

T ≈ X ×1 U(1) ×2 U(2) ×3 U(3)

where U(m) = [u(m)1 u
(m)
2 . . .u

(m)
rm ] ∈ <Im×rm (m =

1, 2, 3) are orthogonal matrices, rm � Im, and the core
tensor X ∈ <r1×r2×r3 is an all-orthogonal and ordered
tensor. T-HOSVD can be computed in two steps:

1. For m ∈ {1, 2, 3}, compute the unfolded ma-
trices T(m) from T and related standard SVD:
T(m) = U(m)S(m)V(m). The orthogonal matrix
U(m) contains the leading left singular vectors of
T(m).

2. Compute the core tensor X using the inversion
formula: X = T ×1 U(1)T ×2 U(2)T ×3 U(3)T .

Note that, since T-HOSVD is computed by means of
3 standard matrix T-SVDs, its computational cost can
be reduced by using fast and efficient SVD algorithms.
Moreover, the ability of T-HOSVD in effectively cap-
turing the variation in each of the modes independently
from the other ones, is particularly important to alle-
viate the problem of concentration of distances, thus
making T-HOSVD well-suited to clustering purposes.
In this work, in order to obtain a final clustering so-
lution of the documents, we will consider the mode-1
factor matrix U(1) of the T-HOSVD.

3.1.5 Document clustering
The mode-1 factor matrix is provided in input to a clus-
tering method to obtain a final organization of the doc-
uments into K clusters, i.e., C = {Ci}Ki=1. Note that
there is no principled relation between the numberK of
final document clusters and k. However, K is expected
to reflect the number of topics of interest for the docu-
ment collection. Also, possibly but not necessarily, the
same clustering algorithm used for the segment cluster-
ing step (i.e., Bisecting K-Means) can be employed for
this step.

3.2 Bag-of-synset representation
In the BoS model, our objective is to represent the doc-
ument segments in a conceptual feature space instead
of the traditional term space. Since we deal with mul-
tilingual documents, this task clearly relies on the mul-
tilingual lexical knowledge base functionalities of Ba-
belNet. Conceptual features will hence correspond to
BabelNet synsets.

The segment collection S is subject to a two-step
processing phase. In the first step, each segment is
broken down into a set of lemmatized and POS-tagged
sentences, in which each word is replaced with re-
lated lemma and associated POS-tag. Let us denote
with 〈w,POS(w)〉 a lemma and associated POS-tag
occurring in any sentence sen of the segment. In the
second step, a WSD method is applied to each pair
〈w,POS(w)〉 to detect the most appropriate Babel-
Net synset σw for 〈w,POS(w)〉 contextually to sen.
The WSD algorithm is carried out in such a way that
all words from all languages are disambiguated over
the same concept inventory, producing a language-
independent feature space for the whole multilingual
corpus. Each segment is finally modeled as a |BS|-
dimensional vector of BabelNet synset frequencies, be-
ing BS the set of retrieved BabelNet synsets.

As previously discussed in Section 2.1, BabelNet
provides WSD algorithms for multilingual corpora.
More specifically, the authors in (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2012b) suggest to use the Degree algorithm (Navigli
and Lapata, 2010), as it showed to yield highly com-
petitive performance in a multilingual context as well.
Note that the Degree algorithm, given a semantic graph
for the input context, simply selects the sense of the tar-
get word with the highest vertex degree. Clearly, other
graph-based methods for (unsupervised) WSD, partic-
ularly PageRank-style methods (e.g., (Mihalcea et al.,
2004; Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Yeh et al., 2009; Tsat-
saronis et al., 2010)), can be plugged in to address the
multilingual WSD task based on BabelNet. An investi-
gation of the performance of existing WSD algorithms
for a multilingual context is however out of the scope
of this paper.

4 Evaluation Methodology
In order to evaluate our proposal we need a multilin-
gual comparable document collection with annotated

topics. For this reason, we used Reuters Corpus Volume
2 (RCV2), a multilingual corpus containing news arti-
cles in thirteen language.1 In the following, we present
the corpus characteristics and competing methods used
in our analysis.

4.1 Data preparation

We consider a subset of the RCV2 corpus correspond-
ing to three languages: English, French and Italian.
It covers six different topics, i.e., different labels of
the RCV2 TOPICS field. Topics are chosen accord-
ing with their coverage in the different languages.
The language-specific documents were lemmatized and
POS-tagged through the Freeling library (Padró and
Stanilovsky, 2012) in order to obtain a suitable rep-
resentation for the WSD process.

To assess the robustness of our proposal, we de-
sign two different scenarios. The first (Balanced Cor-
pus) is characterized by a completely balanced dataset.
Each language covers all topics and for each pair lan-
guage/topic the same number of documents is selected.
The second scenario corresponds to an Unbalanced
Corpus. Starting from the balanced corpus, we re-
moved for each topic all the documents belonging to
one language. In this way, we obtained a corpus in
which each topic is covered by only two of the three
languages.

Main characteristics of both evaluation corpora are
reported in Table 1 and Table 2. In the latter table,
we report the number of documents, number of terms,
number of synsets and the dataset density for both
representations. To quantify the density of each cor-

pus/representation combination, we counted the non-
zero entries of the induced document-synset matrix (al-
ternatively, document-term matrix) and we divided this
value by the size of such matrix. This number pro-
vides an estimate about the density/sparseness of each
dataset. Lower values indicate more sparse data. We
can note that BoS model yields more dense datasets for
both Balanced Corpus and Unbalanced Corpus.

As our proposal explicitly models document seg-
ments, we also report statistics, considering both topics
and languages, related to the average number of seg-
ments per document (Table 3), and the average length
of segments per document (Table 4). The latter statistic
is computed separately for BoW and BoS representa-
tions. We made this distinction because a term cannot
have a mapping to a synset, or it can be mapped to more
than one synset in the BoS space during the WSD pro-
cess (Section 3.2).

Looking at the average number of segments per doc-
ument in Table 3, it can be noted that English docu-
ments contain, for all topics, a larger number of seg-
ments. This means that English documents are gener-
ally richer than the ones in the other languages. Ital-
ian language corresponds to the smallest documents,
each of them containing between 2 and 3.2 segments
on average. A sharper difference appears in the MONE-
TARY/ECONOMIC topic for which English documents
contain 5.2 segments, while the Italian ones are com-
posed, on average, by only 2 segments.

Table 4 shows the average length of segments per
document for both space representations. Generally,
segments in the BoS representation are smaller than the
corresponding segments in the BoW space. More in de-
tail, if we consider the ratio between the segment length
in BoS and the one in BoW, this ratio is around 2/3 for
the English language, while for both French and Ital-
ian it varies between 1/4 and 1/3. This disequilibrium
is induced by the multilingual concept coverage of Ba-
belNet, as stated by its authors (Navigli and Ponzetto,

604



2012a), (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012b). In particular,
the WSD process tightly depends from the concept cov-
erage supplied from the language-specific knowledge
base.

4.2 Competing methods and settings
We compare our SeMDocT with two standard ap-
proaches, namely Bisecting K-Means (Steinbach et al.,
2000), and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)-based doc-
ument clustering (for short, LSA). Given a number K
of desired clusters, Bisecting K-Means produces a K-
way clustering solution by performing a sequence of
K-1 repeated bisections based on standard K-Means
algorithm. This process continues until the number K
of clusters is found. LSA performs a decomposition of
the document collection matrix through Singular Value
Decomposition in order to extract a more concise and
descriptive representation of the documents. After this
step, Bisecting K-Means is applied over the new docu-
ment space to get the final document clustering.

All the three methods, SeMDocT, Bisecting K-
Means and LSA are coupled with either BoS or BoW
representation models. The comparison between BoS
and BoW representations allows us to evaluate the
presumed benefits that can be derived by exploiting
synsets instead of terms for the multilingual document
clustering task.

Both SeMDocT and LSA require the number of com-
ponents as input; as concerns specifically SeMDocT,
we varied r1 (cf. Section 3.1.4) from 2 to 30, with in-
crements of 2. To determine the number of segment
clusters k, we employed an automatic way as discussed
in Section 3.1.2. By varying k from 2 to 40, for Bal-
anced Corpus and Unbalanced Corpus, respectively,
the values of k obtained were 22 and 23 under BoS,
and 25 and 11 under BoW.

As concerns the step of text segmentation, TextTiling
requires the setting of some interdependent parameters,
particularly the size of the text unit to be compared and
the number of words in a token sequence. We used the
setting suggested in (Hearst, 1997) and also confirmed
in (Tagarelli and Karypis, 2013), i.e., 10 for the text
unit size and 20 for the token-sequence size.

4.3 Assessment criteria
Performance of the different methods are evaluated us-
ing two standard clustering validation criteria, namely
F-Measure and Rand Index.

Given a document collection D, let Γ = {Γj}Hj=1
and C = {Ci}Ki=1 denote a reference classification
and a clustering solution for D, respectively. The lo-
cal precision and the local recall of a cluster Ci w.r.t.
a class Γj are defined as Pij = |Ci ∩ Γj |/|Ci| and
Rij = |Ci ∩Γj |/|Γj |, respectively. F-Measure (FM) is
computed as follows (Steinbach et al., 2000):

F =
H∑
j=1

|Γj |
|D| maxi=1...K{Fij}

where Fij = 2PijRij/(Pij +Rij).
Rand Index (RI) (Rand, 1971) measures the percent-

age of decisions that are correct, penalizing false pos-
itive and false negative decisions during clustering. It
takes into account the following quantities: TP, i.e., the
number of pairs of documents that are in the same clus-
ter in C and in the same class in Γ; TN, i.e., the number
of pairs of documents that are in different clusters in
C and in different classes in Γ; FN, i.e., the number of
pairs of documents that are in different clusters in C and
in the same class in Γ; and FP, i.e., the number of pairs
of documents that are in the same cluster in C and in
different classes in Γ. Rand Index is hence defined as:

RI =
TP + TN

TP + TN + FP + FN

Note that for each method, results were averaged
over 30 runs and the number of final document clusters
K was set equal to the number of topics in the docu-
ment collection (i.e., 6).

5 Results

We present here our main experimental results. We first
provide a comparative evaluation of our SeMDocT with
the competing methods, on both balanced and unbal-
anced corpus evaluation cases. Then we provide a per
language analysis focusing on SeMDocT.

5.1 Evaluation with competing methods

Evaluation on balanced corpus. Figure 2 shows FM
and RI results obtained by the various methods coupled
with the two document representations on the Balanced
Corpus. Several remarks stand out. First, the BoS
space positively influences the performance of all the
employed approaches. This is particularly evident for
Bisecting K-Means and LSA that clearly benefit from
this kind of representation. The former almost doubles
its performance in terms of FM and significantly im-
proves its result w.r.t. RI. LSA shows improvements
in both cases. SeMDocT-BoS generally outperforms
all the competitors for both FM and RI when the num-
ber of components is greater than 16. Note that, under
the BoW model, SeMDocT-BoW still outperforms the
other methods.

Evaluation on unbalanced corpus. Figure 3 reports
results for the Unbalanced Corpus. Also in this eval-
uation, the best performances for all the methods are
reached using the BoS representation. SeMDocT-BoS
shows similar behavior according to the two measures.
It always outperforms the competitors considering a
number of components greater than or equal to 12.
More precisely, SeMDocT-BoW obtains a gain of 0.047
and 0.103 in terms of FM and 0.006 and 0.058 in
terms of RI, w.r.t. LSA-BoW and Bisecting K-Means-
BoW, respectively. Similarly, SeMDocT-BoS obtains
improvements of 0.05 in terms of FM w.r.t. both BoS

formance are 0.012 and 0.019 for LSA-BoS and Bisect-
ing K-Means-BoS, respectively.

5.2 Per language evaluation of SeMDocT-BoS

Starting from the clustering solutions produced by
SeMDocT-BoS in both balanced and unbalanced cases,
for each language we extracted a language-specific pro-
jection of the clustering. After that, we computed the
clustering validation criteria according to language spe-
cific solutions to quantify how well the clustering result
fits each specific language. The results of this experi-
ment are reported in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

On the Balanced Corpus, SeMDocT-BoS shows
comparable performance for English and French docu-
ments, while it behaves slightly worse for Italian texts.
This trend is highlighted for both clustering evaluation
criteria. Inspecting the results for the Unbalanced Cor-
pus, we observe a different trend. Results obtained for
the English texts are generally better than the results
for the French and Italian documents. For this bench-
mark, SeMDocT-BoS obtains similar results for docu-

We gained an insight into the above discussed perfor-

mance behaviors by computing some additional statis-
tics that we report in Table 5: for each language and
each dataset, the size of the term and synset dictionar-
ies and the average number of synsets per lemma (β)
we retrieved through BabelNet according to the related
corpus. More in detail, β is the ratio between the BoS
and the BoW dictionaries. This quantity roughly eval-
uates how many synsets are produced per term during
the multilingual WSD process (Section 3.2). As we can
observe, this value is always smaller than one, which
means that not all the terms have a corresponding map-
ping to a synset. The β ratio can explain the discrep-

ancy in (language-specific) performances in the two
scenarios. In particular, the difference in the β statis-
tic between English and the other languages is more
evident for the Unbalanced Corpus (i.e., 0.23 between
English and French), while it is lower for the Balanced
Corpus (around 0.1). The relatively large gap in β be-
tween the first and the second language (respectively,
English and French) for the Unbalanced Corpus re-
duces the relative gap between the second and the third
languages (respectively, French and Italian) while this
trend is less marked for the Balanced Corpus as β range
is narrower. In summary, we can state that our frame-
work works well if BabelNet knowledge base provides
a good coverage of the terms in the analyzed language.
Experimental evidence shows that, if this condition is
met, SeMDocT-BoS provides better clustering results
w.r.t. the competing approaches.

5.3 Runtime of tensor decomposition

As previously discussed, T-HOSVD of a third-order
tensor can be computed through three standard SVDs.
Furthermore, for clustering purposes, we considered
only the mode-1 factor matrix of the decomposition.

To compute the SVD, we used the svds() function of
MATLAB R2012b, which is based on an iterative algo-
rithm.2 Experiments were carried out on an Intel Core
I7-3610QM platform with 16GB DDR RAM.

Figure 6 shows the execution time of the SVD over
the mode-1 matricization of our tensor for the Balanced
Corpus, by varying the number of components, for both
BoW and BoS representation models. As it can be ob-
served, in both cases the runtime is linear in the number
of components. However, the SVD computation in the
BoS setting is one order of magnitude faster than time
performance in the BoW setting. This is mainly due to
a large difference in size between the feature spaces of
BoW and BoS (cf. Table 2), since the selected num-
ber of segment clusters (k) was nearly the same (25 for
BoW, and 22 for BoS). Therefore, by providing a more
compact feature space, BoS clearly allows for a much
less expensive SVD computation for our tensor decom-
position.

6 Discussion

Our work paves the way for the use of a multilingual
knowledge base to deal with the multilingual document
clustering task. Here we sum up our main findings.

SeMDocT vs. LSA. LSA achieved its best results
for a number of components generally smaller than the
one for which SeMDocT obtained its maximum. This
is due to the initial information that the two methods
summarize. LSA tries to capture the variation of the
initial document-term (alternatively, document-synset)
matrix representing the texts in a lower space, whereas
SeMDocT does the same starting from a richer repre-
sentation of the documents (i.e., a third-order tensor
model). For this reason, SeMDocT tends to employ
relatively more components in order to summarize the
documents content; however, a number of components
between 16 and 30 is generally enough to ensure good
performance of SeMDocT. Moreover, in most cases,
the highest performance results by SeMDocT are better
than the highest performances of LSA.

BoS vs. BoW. Our results have highlighted the
better quality in multilingual clustering supplied by
synsets compared with the one provided by terms. BoS
produces a smaller representation space over which
documents are projected, but it is enough rich to well
capture the documents content. In particular, BoS ben-
efits from the WSD process that is able to discriminate
the same term w.r.t. the context in which it appears.

BabelNet. BabelNet is a recent project that supports
many different languages. As the intention of the au-
thors is to enrich this resource, in the future our frame-
work will benefit of this fact. Moreover, our framework
can deal with documents written in many different lan-
guages as they are represented through the same space;
the only constraint is related to the available language
support in BabelNet. On the other hand, we point out
that any other multilingual knowledge base and WSD
tools can in principle be integrated in our framework.

7 Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a new approach for multi-
lingual document clustering. Our key idea lies in the
combination of a tensor-based model with a bag-of-
synsets description, which enables a common space to
project multilingual document collections. We evalu-
ated our approach w.r.t. standard document clustering
methods, using both term and synset representations.
Results have shown the benefits deriving from the use
of a multilingual knowledge base in the analysis of
comparable corpora, and also shown the significance
of our approach in both a balanced and an unbalanced
corpus evaluation. Our tensor-based representation of
topically-segmented multilingual documents can also
be applied to cross-lingual information retrieval or mul-
tilingual document categorization.
