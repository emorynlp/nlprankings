Abstract

This paper describes a novel approach for sex-
ual predator detection in chat conversations
based on sequences of classifiers. The pro-
posed approach divides documents into three
parts, which, we hypothesize, correspond to
the different stages that a predator employs
when approaching a child. Local classifiers
are trained for each part of the documents and
their outputs are combined by a chain strat-
egy: predictions of a local classifier are used
as extra inputs for the next local classifier.
Additionally, we propose a ring-based strat-
egy, in which the chaining process is iterated
several times, with the goal of further improv-
ing the performance of our method. We re-
port experimental results on the corpus used
in the first international competition on sex-
ual predator identification (PAN’12). Experi-
mental results show that the proposed method
outperforms a standard (global) classification
technique for the different settings we con-
sider; besides the proposed method compares
favorably with most methods evaluated in the
PAN’12 competition.

1 Introduction

Advances in communications’ technologies have
made possible to any person in the world to com-
municate with any other in different ways (e.g.,
text, voice, and video) regardless of their geograph-
ical locations, as long as they have access to in-
ternet. This undoubtedly represents an important
and highly needed benefit to society. Unfortunately,
this benefit also has brought some collateral issues

that affect the security of internet users, as nowa-
days we are vulnerable to many threats, including:
cyber-bullying, spam, fraud, and sexual harassment,
among others.

A particularly important concern has to do with
the protection of children that have access to inter-
net (Wolak et al., 2006). Children are vulnerable
to attacks from paedophiles, which “groom” them.
That is, adults who meet underage victims online,
engage in sexually explicit text or video chat with
them, and eventually convince the children to meet
them in person. In fact, one out of every seven
children receives an unwanted sexual solicitation
online (Wolak et al., 2006). Hence, the detection
of cyber-sexual-offenders is a critical security issue
that challenges the field of information technologies.

This paper introduces an effective approach for
sexual predator detection (also called sexual preda-
tor identification) in chat conversations based on
chains of classifiers. The proposed approach di-
vides documents into three parts, with the hypoth-
esis that different parts correspond to the differ-
ent stages that predators adopt when approaching
a child (Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011). Lo-
cal classifiers are trained for each part of the doc-
uments and their outputs are combined by a chain-
ing strategy. In the chain-based approach the pre-
dictions of a local classifier are used as extra inputs
for the next local classifier. This strategy is inspired
from chain-based classifiers developed for the task
of multi-label classification (Read et al., 2011). A
ring-based approach is proposed, in which the gener-
ation of chains of classifiers is iterated several times.
We report experimental results in the corpus used in
the first international competition on sexual preda-
tor identification (PAN-2012) (Inches and Crestani,

46



2012). Experimental results show that chain-based
classifiers outperform standard classification meth-
ods for the different settings we considered. Further-
more, the proposed method compares favorably with
alternative methods developed for the same task.

2 Sexual predator detection

We focus on the detection of sexual predators in chat
rooms, among the many cyber-menaces targeting
children. This is indeed a critical problem because
most sexually-abused children have agreed volun-
tarily to met with their abuser (Wolak et al., 2006).
Therefore, anticipatively detecting when a person at-
tempts to approach a children, with malicious inten-
tions, could reduce the number of abused children.

Traditionally, a term that is used to describe mali-
cious actions with a potential aim of sexual exploita-
tion or emotional connection with a child is referred
as “Child Grooming” or “Grooming Attack” (Ku-
cukyilmaz et al., 2008). Defined in (Harms, 2007)
as: “a communication process by which a perpetra-
tor applies affinity seeking strategies, while simulta-
neously engaging in sexual desensitization and in-
formation acquisition about targeted victims in or-
der to develop relationships that result in need ful-
fillment” (e.g. physical sexual molestation).

The usual approach1 to catch sexual predators is
through police officers or volunteers, whom behave
as fake children in chat rooms and provoke sexual
offenders to approach them. Unfortunately, online
sexual predators always outnumber the law enforce-
ment officers and volunteers. Therefore, tools that
can automatically detect sexual predators in chat
conversations (or at least serve as support tool for
officers) are highly needed.

A few attempts to automate processes related to
the sexual predator detection task have been pro-
posed already (Pendar, 2007; Michalopoulos and
Mavridis, 2011; RahmanMiah et al., 2011; Inches
and Crestani, 2012; Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012;
Bogdanova et al., 2013). The problem of detect-
ing conversations that potentially include a sex-
ual predator approaching a victim has been ap-
proached, for example, by (RahmanMiah et al.,
2011; Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012; Bogdanova et al.,

1Adopted for example by the Perverted Justice organization,
http://www.perverted-justice.com/

2013). RahmanMiah et al. discriminated among
child-exploitation, adult-adult and general-chatting
conversations using a text categorization approach
and psychometric information (RahmanMiah et al.,
2011). Recently, Bogdanova et al. approached
the same problem, the authors concluded that stan-
dard text-mining features are useful to distinguish
general-chatting from child-exploitation conversa-
tions, but not for discriminating between child-
exploitation and adult-adult conversations (Bog-
danova et al., 2013). In the latter problem, fea-
tures that model behavior and emotion resulted par-
ticularly helpful. N. Pendar approached the prob-
lem of distinguishing predators from victims within
chat conversations previously confirmed as contain-
ing a grooming attack (Pendar, 2007). The author
collapsed all of the interventions from each partici-
pant into a document and approached the problem as
a standard text categorization task with two classes
(victim vs. predator).

A more fine grained approximation to the problem
was studied by (Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011).
The authors developed a probabilistic method that
classifies chat interventions into one of three classes:
1) Gaining Access: indicate predators intention to
gain access to the victim; 2) Deceptive Relationship:
indicate the deceptive relationship that the preda-
tor tries to establish with the minor, and are pre-
liminary to a sexual exploitation attack; and 3) Sex-
ual Affair: clearly indicate predator’s intention for
a sexual affair with the victim. These categories
correspond to the different stages that a sexual of-
fender adopt when approaching a child. As (Pen-
dar, 2007), (Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011) ap-
proached this problem as one of text categorization
(equating interventions to short-documents). They
removed stop words and applied a spelling correc-
tion strategy, their best results were obtained with a
Naı̈ve Bayes classifier, reaching performance close
to 96%. Thus giving evidence that the three cate-
gories can be recognized reasonably well. Which
in turn gives evidence that modeling the three stages
could be beneficial for recognizing sexual predators;
for example, when it is not known whether a con-
versation contains or not a grooming attack. This
is the underlying hypothesis behind the proposed
method. We aim to use local classifiers, special-
ized in the different stages a predator approaches a

47



child. Then, we combine the outputs of local classi-
fiers with the goal of improving the performance on
sexual predator detection in conversations including
both: grooming attacks and well-intentioned conver-
sations.

Because of the relevance of the problem, and of
the interest of several research groups from NLP,
it was organized in 2012 the first competition of
sexual predator identification (Inches and Crestani,
2012). The problem approached in the competition
was that of identifying sexual predators from con-
versations containing both: grooming attacks and
well-intentioned conversations. The organizers pro-
vided a large corpus divided into development and
evaluation data. Development (training) data were
provided to participants for building their sexual-
predator detection system. In a second stage, eval-
uation (testing) data were provided to participants,
whom had to apply their system to that data and sub-
mit their results. Organizers evaluated participants
using their predictions on evaluation data (labels for
the evaluation data were not provided to participants
during the competition).

Several research groups participated in that com-
petition, see (Inches and Crestani, 2012). Some
participants developed tailored features for detect-
ing sexual predators (see e.g., (Eriksson and Karl-
gren, 2012)), whereas other researchers focused on
the development of effective classifiers (Parapar et
al., 2012). The winning approach implemented a
two stage formulation (Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012):
in a first step suspicious conversations where iden-
tified using a two class classifier. Suspicious con-
versations are those that potentially include a sexual
predator (i.e., a similar approach to (RahmanMiah
et al., 2011)). In a second stage, sexual predators
were distinguished from victims in the suspicious
conversations identified in the first stage (a similar
approach to that of (Pendar, 2007)). For both stages
a standard classifier and a bag-of-words representa-
tion was used.

The methods proposed in this paper were eval-
uated in the corpus used in the first interna-
tional competition on sexual predator detection,
PAN’12 (Inches and Crestani, 2012). As explained
in the following sections, the proposed method uses
standard representation and classification methods,
therefore, the proposed methods can be improved if

we use tailored features or learning techniques for
sexual predator detection.

3 Chain-based classifiers for SPD

Chain-based classifiers were first proposed to deal
with multi-label classification (Read et al., 2011).
The goal was to incorporate dependencies among
different labels, which are disregarded by most
multi-label classification methods. The underlying
idea was to increase the input space of classifiers
with the outputs provided by classifiers trained for
other labels. The authors showed important im-
provements over traditional methods.

In this paper, we use chain-based classifiers to in-
corporate dependencies among local classifiers asso-
ciated to different segments of a chat conversation.
The goal is building an effective predator-detection
model made of a set of local models specialized at
classifying certain segments of the conversation. In-
tuitively, we would like to have a local model asso-
ciated to each of the stages in which a sexual preda-
tor approaches a child: gaining access, deceptive
relationship and sexual affair (Michalopoulos and
Mavridis, 2011). We associate a segment of the con-
versation to each of the three stages. The raw ap-
proach proposed in this work consists of dividing
the conversation into three segments of equal length.
The first, second and third segments of each conver-
sation are associated to the first, second and third
stages, respectively. Although, this approach is too
simple, our goal was to determine whether having
local classifiers combined via a chaining strategy
could improve the performance on sexual predator
detection.

We hypothesize that as the vocabulary used in dif-
ferent segments of the conversation is different, spe-
cialized models can result in better performance for
classifying these local segments. Since local classi-
fiers can only capture local information, it is desir-
able to somehow connect these classifiers in order to
make predictions taking into account the whole con-
versation. One way to make local classifiers depen-
dent is thought the chain-based methodology, where
the outputs of one local classifier are feed as inputs
for the next local classifier; the final prediction for
the whole conversation can be obtained in several
ways as described below.

48



The proposed approach is described in Figure 1.
Since our goal is to detect sexual predators from
chat conversations directly, we model each user
(well-intentioned user, victim or sexual predator)
by their set of interventions. Thus, we generate a
single conversation for each user using their inter-
ventions, keeping the order in which such interven-
tions happened. The approached problem is to clas-
sify these conversations into sexual-predator or any-
other-type-of-user. In the following we call sim-
ply conversations to the generated per-user conver-
sations.

Chat conversations are divided into three
(equally-spaced) parts. Next, one local-classifier
is trained for each part of the document according
to a predefined order2, where two out of the three
classifiers (second and third) are not independent.
Let p1, p2, and p3 denote the segments of text
that will be used for generating the first, second
and third classifiers. The triplet {p1, p2, p3} can
be any of the six permutations of 3 segments, this
tripled determines the order in which classifiers
will be built. Once that a particular order has been
defined, a first local-classifier, f1, is trained using
the part p1 from all of the training documents
(p1 ∈ {first, second, third}). Next, a second
local-classifier, f2, is trained by using the part p2
from all of the training documents. f2 is built
by using both attributes extracted from part p2 of
conversations and the outputs of the first classifier
over the training documents. Thus, classifier f2
depends on classifier f1, through the outputs of the
latter model. A third local-classifier, f3, is trained
using attributes extracted from part p3 from all
conversations, the input space for training f3 is
augmented with the predictions of classifiers f2 and
f1 over the training documents. Hence, the third
classifier depends on the outputs of the first and
second classifiers.

Once trained, the chain of local-classifiers can be
used to make predictions for the whole conversation
in different ways. When a test conversation needs to
be classified it is also split into 3 parts. Part p1 is
feeded to classifier f1, which generates a prediction
for f1. Next, part p2 from the test document, to-

2We hypothesize that building a chain of classifiers using
different orders results in different performances, we evaluate
this aspect in Section 4.

Figure 1: General diagram of the chain-based approach.

gether with the prediction for p1 as generated by f1
are feeded to classifier f2. Likewise, the outputs of
f2 and f1, together with part p3 from the document
are used as inputs for classifier f3. Clearly, since we
have predictions for the test document at the three
stages of the chain (from f1,2,3) we can make a pre-
diction at any stage. The prediction from classifier
f3 is called chain-prediction as it is the outcome of
the dependent local-classifiers.

Additionally to local and chain-prediction, we
propose a ring-like structure for chain-based classi-
fiers in which the outputs of the third local-classifier
are used again as inputs for another local model,
where the order can be different to that used in the
previous iteration. This process is iterated for a num-
ber of times, where we can make predictions at every
link (local-classifier) of the ring. In addition, after
a number of iterations we can make predictions by
combining the outputs (like in an ensemble) gener-
ated by all of the classifiers considered in the ring
up to that iteration. The underlying idea is to ex-
plore the performance of the chain as more local-
models, that can use short and long term dependen-
cies with other classifiers, are incorporated. Our hy-
pothesis is that after incorporating a certain number
of local-dependent-models, the predictions for the
whole conversations will be steady and will improve
the performance of the straight chain approach.

Algorithm 1 describes the proposed ring-based
classifier. E denotes the set of extra inputs that have
to be added to individual classifiers, which are the
cumulative outputs of individual classifiers. P is a
set of predefined permutations from which different
orders can be took from, where Pi is the ith per-
mutation. We denote with atts (pi, E) to the pro-

49



cess of extracting attributes from documents’ part
pi and merging them with attributes stored in E .
atts generates the representation that a classifier
can use. train [f(X)] denotes the process of train-
ing classifier f using inputs X . Mc stores the mod-
els trained through the ring process.

When a test conversation needs to be labeled, the
set of classifiers in M are applied to it using the
same order in the parts that was used when generat-
ing the models. Each time a model is applied to the
test instance, the prediction of such model is used
to increase the input space that is to be used for the
next model. We call the prediction given by the last
model Mg, ring-prediction. One should note that,
as before, we can have predictions for the test con-
versation from every model Mi. Besides, we can
accumulate the predictions for the whole set of mod-
els M1,...,g. Another alternative is to combine the
predictions of the three individual classifiers in each
iteration of the ring (every execution of the for-loop
in Algorithm 1); this can be done, e.g., by weight
averaging. In the next section we report the perfor-
mance obtained by all these configurations.

4 Experiments and results

For the evaluation of the proposed approach we
considered the data set used in the first interna-
tional competition on sexual predator identification3

(PAN-2012) (Inches and Crestani, 2012). Table 1
3http://pan.webis.de/

presents some features from the considered data set.
The data set contains both chat conversations includ-
ing sexual predators approaching minors and (au-
thentic) conversations between users (which can or
cannot be related to a sexual topic). The data set pro-
vided by the organizers contained too much noisy in-
formation that could harm the performance of classi-
fication methods (e.g., conversations with only one
participant, conversations of a few characters long,
etc.). Therefore, we applied a preprocessing that
aimed to both remove noisy conversations and re-
ducing the data set for scalability purposes. The fil-
tering preprocessing consisted of eliminating: con-
versations with only one participant, conversations
with less than 6 interventions per each participant,
conversations that had long sequences of unrecog-
nized characters (images, apparently). The char-
acteristics of the data set after filtering are shown
within parentheses in Table 1. It can be seen that
the size of the data set was reduced considerably,
although a few sexual predators were removed, we
believe the information available from them was in-
sufficient to recognize them.

Table 1: Features of the data set considered for experi-
mentation (Inches and Crestani, 2012). We show the fea-
tures of the raw data and in parentheses the corresponding
features after applying the proposed preprocessing.

Feature Development Evaluation
# Convers. 66, 928 (6, 588) 155, 129 (15, 330)

# Users 97, 690 (11, 038) 218, 702 (25, 120)
# Sexual Pr. 148(136) 254 (222)

Conversations were represented using their bag-
of-words. We evaluated the performance of dif-
ferent representations and found that better results
were obtained with a Boolean weighting scheme.
No stop-word removal nor stemming was applied,
in fact, punctuation marks were conserved. We pro-
ceeded this way because we think in chat conver-
sations every character conveys useful information
to characterize users, victims and sexual predators.
This is because of the highly unstructured and in-
formal language used in chat conversations, as dis-
cussed in related works (Kucukyilmaz et al., 2008;
RahmanMiah et al., 2011; Rosa and Ellen, 2009).

For indexing conversations we used the TMG
toolbox (Zeimpekis and Gallopoulos, 2006). The re-

50



sultant vocabulary was of 56, 964 terms. For build-
ing classifiers we used a neural network as imple-
mented in the CLOP toolbox (Saffari and Guyon,
2006). Our choice is based on results from a prelim-
inary study.

4.1 Performance of local classifiers

We first evaluate the performance of global and local
classifiers separately. A global classifier is that gen-
erated using the content of the whole conversation, it
resembles the formulation from (Pendar, 2007). Lo-
cal classifiers were generated for each of the seg-
ments. Table 2 shows the performance of the global
and local models. We report the average (of 5 runs)
of precision, recall and F1 measure for the positive
class (sexual predators).

Table 2: Performance of global (row 2) and local classi-
fiers (rows 3-6).

Setting Precision Recall F1 Measure
Global 95.14% 49.91% 65.42%

Segment 1 96.16% 59.20% 73.23%
Segment 2 96.25% 48.82% 64.72%
Segment 3 93.43% 51.87% 66.68%

It can be seen from Table 2 that the performance
of the global model and that obtained for segments
2 and 3 are comparable to each other in terms of
the three measures we considered. Interestingly,
the best performance was obtained when the only
the first segment of the conversation was used for
classification. The difference is considerable, about
11.93% of relative improvement. This is a first con-
tribution of our work: using the first segment of a
conversation can improve the performance obtained
by a global classifier. Since the first segment of con-
versations (barely) corresponds to the gaining ac-
cess stage, the result provides evidence that sexual
predators can be detected by the way they start ap-
proaching to their victims. That is, the way a well-
intentioned person starts a conversation is somewhat
different to that of sexual predators approaching a
child. Also, it is likely that this makes a difference
because for segments 2 and 3, conversations con-
taining grooming attacks and well-intentioned con-
versations can be very similar (well-intentioned con-
versations can deal sexual thematic as well).

4.2 Chain-based classifiers

In this section we report the performance obtained
by different settings of chain based classifiers. We
first report the performance of the chain-prediction
strategy, see Section 3. Figure 2 shows the precision,
recall and F1 measure, obtained by the chain-based
classifier for the different permutations of the 3 seg-
ments (i.e., all possible orders for the segments). For
each order, we report the initial performance (that
obtained with the segment in the first order) and the
chain-prediction, that is the prediction provided by
the last classifier in the chain.

Figure 2: F1 measure by the initial and chain-based clas-
sifier for different orders.

From Figure 2 it can be observed that the chain-
prediction outperformed the initial classifier for
most of the orders in terms of F1 measure. For or-
ders starting with segment 1 (1-2-3 and 1-3-2) chain-
based classifiers worsen the initial performance.
This is due to the high performance of local clas-
sifier for segment 1 (see Table 2), which cannot be
improved with successive local classifiers. However,
the best performance overall was obtained by the
chain-based classifier with the order 2-3-1. The rela-
tive improvement of this configuration for the chain-
based method over the global classifier (the one us-
ing the whole conversations) was of 18.52%. One
should note that the second-best performance was
obtained with the order 3-2-1. Hence, putting the
most effective classifier (that for segment 1) at the
end seems to have a positive influence in the chain-
based classifier. We have shown evidence that chain-
based classifiers outperform both the global classi-
fier and any of the local methods. Also, the order of
classifiers is crucial for obtaining acceptable results
with the chain technique: using the best classifier
in the last position yields better performance; and,
putting the best classifier at the beginning would
lead the chain to worsen initial performance.

4.3 Ring-based classifiers

In this section we report experimental results on sex-
ual predator detection obtained with the ring-based
strategy. Recall a ring-based classifier can be seen as
a chain that is replicated several times with different
orders, so we can have predictions for each of the
local classifiers at each node of the ring/chain. Be-
sides, we can obtain periodical/cumulative predic-
tions from the chain and predictions derived from
combining predictions from a subset of local classi-
fiers in the chain. We explore the performance of all
of these strategies in the rest of this section.

We implement ring-based classifiers by succes-
sively applying chain-based classifiers with differ-
ent orders. We consider the following alternatives
for detecting predators with ring-based classifiers:

• Local. We make predictions with local classifiers
each time a local classifier is added to the ring (no
dependencies are considered). We report the av-
erage performance (segments avg.) and the maxi-
mum performance (segments max.) obtained by lo-
cal classifiers in each of the orders tried.

• Chain-prediction. We make predictions with
chain-based classifiers each time a local classifier
is added to the ring. We report the average perfor-
mance (chain-prediction avg.) and the maximum
performance (chain-prediction max.) obtained by
chain-based classifiers per each of the orders tried.

• Ensemble of chain-based classifiers. We combine
the outputs of the three chain-based classifiers built
for each order; this method is referred to as LC-
Ensemble.

• Cumulative ensemble. We combine the outputs
(via averaging) of all the chain-based classifiers that
have been built each time an order is added to the
ring; we call this method Cumulative-Ensemble.

Besides reporting results for these approaches we
also report the performance obtained by the global
classifier (Whole conversations), see Table 2.

We iterated the ring-based classifier for a fixed
number of orders. We tried 24 orders, repeating the
following process two times: we tried the permu-
tations of the 3 segments in lexicographical order,
followed by the same permutations on inverted lex-
icographical order. So a total of 24 different orders
were evaluated. Figure 3 shows the results obtained

by the different settings we consider for a typical run
of our approach.

Several findings can be drawn from Figure 3.
With exception of the average of local classifiers
(segments avg.), all of the methods outperformed
consistently the global classifier (whole conversa-
tions). Thus confirming the competitive perfor-
mance of local classifiers and that of chain-based
variants. The best local classifier from each or-
der (segments max.) achieved competitive perfor-
mance, although it was outperformed by the average
of chain-based classifiers (chain-prediction avg.).
Since local classifiers are independent, no tendency
on their performance can be observed as more orders
are tried. On the contrary, the performance chain-
based methods (as evidenced by the avg. and max
of chain-predictions) improves for the first 8-9 or-
ders and then remains steady. In fact, the best (per-
order) chain-prediction (chain-prediction max.) ob-
tained performance comparable to that obtained by
ensemble methods. One should note, however, that
in the chain-prediction max. formulation we report
the best performance from each order tried, which
might correspond to different segments in the differ-
ent orders. Therefore, it is not clear how the select
the specific order to use and the specific segment of
the chain that will be used for making predictions,
when putting in practice the method for a sexual-
predator detection system. Notwithstanding, stable
average predictions can be obtained when more than
6-8 orders are used (chain-prediction avg.), still the
performance of this approach is lower than that of
ensembles.

Clearly, the best performance was obtained
with the ensemble methods: chain-ensemble and
cumulative-ensemble. Both approaches obtained
similar performance, although the chain-ensemble
slightly outperformed cumulative-ensemble. The
chain-ensemble considers dependencies within each
order and not across orders, thus its performance af-
ter trying the 6 permutations of 3 segments did not
vary significantly. This is advantageous as only 6
orders have to be evaluated to obtain competitive
performance. Unfortunately, as with single chain-
classifiers it may be unclear how to select the par-
ticular order to use to implement a sexual-predator
detection system.

On the other hand, the cumulative-ensemble ob-

52

tained stable performance after ≈ 12 orders were
considered. Recall this method incorporates depen-
dencies among the different orders tried. Although
it requires the evaluation of more orders than the
chain-ensemble to converge, this method is advanta-
geous for a real application: after a certain number
of orders it achieves steady performance, and since
it averages the outputs of all of the chain-classifiers
evaluated up to a certain iteration, its performance
does not rely on selecting a particular configuration.
In consequence, we claim the cumulative-ensemble
offers the best tradeoff between performance, stabil-
ity and model selection.

4.4 Comparison with related works

Table 3 shows a comparison of the configuration
cumulative-ensemble against the top-ranked partic-
ipants in the PAN’12 competition. We show the
performance of the top-5 participants as described
in (Inches and Crestani, 2012), additionally we re-
port the average performance obtained by the meth-
ods of the 16 participating teams. We report, F1
and F0.5 measures, and the rank for each participant.
We report F0.5 measure because that was the leading
evaluation measure for the PAN’12 competition.

From Table 3 it can be observed that the proposed
method is indeed very competitive. The results ob-
tained by our method outperformed significantly the
average performance (row 7) obtained by all of the
participants in all of the considered measures. In
terms of F1 measure our method would be ranked in
the fourth position, while in terms of the F0.5 mea-
sure our method would be ranked third.

works evaluated in the PAN’12 competition (Inches and
Crestani, 2012).

5 Conclusions

We introduced a novel approach to sexual-predator
detection in which documents are divided into 3
segments, which, we hypothesize, could correspond
to the different stages in that a sexual predator ap-
proaches a child. Local classifiers are built for each
of the segments, and the predictions of local classi-
fiers are combined through a strategy inspired from
chain-based classifiers. We report results on the
corpus used in the PAN’12 competition, the pro-
posed method outperforms a global approach. Re-
sults are competitive with related works evaluated in
PAN’12. Future work includes applying the chain-
based classifiers under the two-stage approach from
Villatoro et al. (Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012).
