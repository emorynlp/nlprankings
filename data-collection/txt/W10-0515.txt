Abstract

Tracking information flow (IFLOW) is crucial
to understanding the evolution of news sto-
ries. We present analysis and experiments for
IFLOW between company announcements and
newswire. Error analysis shows that many FPs
are annotation errors and many FNs are due
to coarse-grained document-level modelling.
Experiments show that document meta-data
features (e.g., category, length, timing) im-
prove f-scores relative to upper bound by 23%.

1 Introduction

Tracking IFLOW between primary and secondary
news sources provides insight into the contribution
of participants and the role of sources. In finance,
being alert and responsive to the nature of incoming
information (e.g., novelty, price sensitivity) is cen-
tral to successful trading (Zaheer and Zaheer, 1997).
Traders need tools that flag price-sensitive informa-
tion in a high-volume news feed. IFLOW is central to
market surveillance, where unusual market activity
(e.g., abnormal changes in trading price or volume)
is linked to explanations in the information ecosys-
tem (Milosavljevic et al., 2009).

In Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange
(ASX) is the official syndicator of information that
might affect a company’s share price. Subsequently,
a variety of secondary sources (e.g., news media,
blogs, forums) repackage this information. We fo-
cus on the relationship between ASX company an-
nouncements and Reuters newswire, which filters
and aggregates the key details from company an-
nouncements in near-real time.

2 Preliminary Results

We define IFLOW for capital markets as a pair of
documents where one repeats price-sensitive infor-
mation from the other (Radford et al., 2009). Pairs
of ASX announcements and Reuters NewsScope
Archive (RNA) stories covering the same company
and released within a week of one another are man-
ually annotated for presence or absence of IFLOW.
These are used to train MEGAM (Daumé III, 2004)
maximum entropy models for identifying IFLOW.
Textual features include set-theoretic bags of word
unigrams and bigrams over the document text and
titles. Text, title and numeric token similarity scores
(Metzler et al., 2005) provide a more general no-
tion of similarity. The precision of numeric tokens is
also represented. Counts of matched sentences and
longest common sub-sequences capture longer units
of reused text. Temporal features model the news
cycle and news source responsiveness.

In development experiments (ten-fold cross vali-
dation, 30,249 ASX-RNA pairs), the system identi-
fies IFLOW pairs at 89.5% f-score (Radford et al.,
2009). In evaluation experiments (held-out test set,
1,621 ASX-RNA pairs), it achieves 76.6% f-score,
significantly better than a text-only baseline (62.5%)
and 10% less than the human upper bound (86.4%).

3 Error analysis

We engaged finance students (fourth-year or higher)
to examine the 20 false positive (FP) errors with the
highest IFLOW probabilities and the 20 false neg-
ative (FN) errors with the lowest IFLOW probabili-
ties. Table 1 shows the resulting reassessment of the

original IFLOW annotation. For FPs, 75% were de-
termined to have been incorrectly annotated as ab-
sent of IFLOW. This is not unexpected since IFLOW
can be based on small details (e.g., ‘$2.45m profit’)
which are easily missed by annotators. This suggests
that the system’s actual precision may be higher
than 90.9%. Mis-annotation is less common for FNs
(20%). However, the proportion of DIGEST docu-
ments (those that report on multiple events) is much
higher for FNs (75% compared to 30% for FPs). It is
likely that legitimate textual similarity is lost in the
noise of the irrelevant content.

4 Document Metadata Features

We add new features that take advantage of categori-
sation information in the source metadata. These in-
clude ASX tags for price sensitivity, ASX and RNA
type tags and journalist revision comments embed-
ded in RNA stories. These features model differ-
ences in IFLOW between document types (e.g., pe-
riodic reports are more likely to be reported than a
dividend rate announcement). A feature represent-
ing the length of each ASX-RNA document is also in-
cluded. We also add detail to the temporal features,
including the day and month the announcement was
released, as well as whether the announcement and
story were released on the same day.

The metadata features lead to significantly better
f-score in development experiments (Table 2). Sub-
tractive feature analysis suggests that the document
type and length features are effective (p<0.05) but
the detailed temporal features are not. The revision
comments are borderline (p=0.051). In Table 3,
the metadata features improve the f-score by 23%
over Radford et al. (2009) with respect to the upper
bound, but the difference is not significant. The dif-
ferent precision-recall balance between experiments
is consistent with Section 3.

5 Discussion and Future Work

We have developed a dataset for IFLOW in the con-
text of financial text mining and demonstrated it is a

feasible task using simple approaches. Future work
will involve more advanced models. First, we will
consider sub-document analysis, as suggested by the
DIGEST FNs in the error analysis. This will also en-
able tools that highlight specific types of contribu-
tion (e.g., adding background context, novel anal-
ysis) within secondary sources. Furthermore, the
wider IFLOW ecosystem includes other sources (e.g.,
bloggers, forum contributors) that should be anal-
ysed for leading and lagging indicators. Finally, a
number of specific applications might serve as ex-
trinsic evaluations of the IFLOW task. These include
de-duplicating and aggregating information feeds
and automatically attributing reported content to a
source story.
