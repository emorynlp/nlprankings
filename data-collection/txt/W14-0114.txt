Abstract 

 

Sinhala is one of the official languages of Sri 

Lanka and is used by over 19 million people. 

It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the In-

do-European languages and its origins date 

back to at least 2000 years. It has developed 

into its current form over a long period of time 

with influences from a wide variety of lan-

guages including Tamil, Portuguese and Eng-

lish.  As for any other language, a WordNet is 

extremely important for Sinhala to take it into 

the digital era. This paper is based on the pro-

ject to develop a WordNet for Sinhala based 

on the English (Princeton) WordNet. It de-

scribes how we overcame the challenges in 

adding Sinhala specific characteristics which 

were deemed important by Sinhala language 

experts to the WordNet while keeping the 

structure of the original English WordNet. It 

also presents the details of the crowdsourcing 

system we developed as a part of the project - 

consisting of a NoSQL database in the 

backend and a web-based frontend. We con-

clude by discussing the possibility of adapting 

this architecture for other languages and the 

road ahead for the Sinhala WordNet and Sin-

hala NLP. 

1 Introduction 

Despite being used by over 19 million people 

and being one of the official languages of Sri 

Lanka, there has not been much progress in de-

veloping natural language processing (NLP) ap-

plications for the Sinhala language. This is partly 

due to the lack of commercial interest on devel-

oping Sinhala NLP applications on a global 

scale. For instance, as of now, neither Google 

Translate
1
 nor Google News

2
 is available for 

Sinhala while both are available in Hindi and 

Tamil – two other regional languages spoken by 

a much larger population and thus with a higher 

business value. 

Within this backdrop, we believe that develop-

ing a fully functional WordNet for Sinhala would 

provide a much needed boost for the Sinahla 

NLP work. This is because it is well recognized 

that a WordNet is a very important tool in per-

forming natural language processing tasks for 

any language. A WordNet will be helpful to Sin-

hala NLP application developers in tasks ranging 

from word sense disambiguation and information 

retrieval to translation. Moreover a Sinhala 

WordNet will be a valuable resource to linguists

studying the Sinhala language. We paid special 

attention to the interests and concerns of the lat-

ter group as described later in the paper.  

The project team, mainly consisting of per-

sonnel from the Knowledge and Language Engi-

neering Lab of University of Moratuwa, started 

the task of developing a WordNet for Sinhala 

with several brainstorming sessions which in-

volved Sinhala language experts, computer sci-

ence specialists and people who had previously 

made some contributions in digitizing the Sinha-

la language (for example in developing Sinhala 

Unicode characters). Although we were biased 

towards using the expansion approach, which 

develops a WordNet based on an existing 

WordNet for another language, we discussed the 

possibility of adopting the merge approach, 

which develops a WordNet using the first princi-

ples by leveraging existing dictionaries and other 

resources (Bhattacharyya, 2010). We settled on 

the expansion approach because it was evident 

that we do not have the resources to successfully 

pursue the merge approach. 

We came up with basic design for the Word-

Net through the above mentioned brainstorming 

sessions and then proceeded to develop the tech-

nical infrastructure needed. This consists of de-

veloping Sinhala WordNet APIs and a web inter-

face as well as a crowdsourcing system to add 

synsets and relationships. The latter is needed 

because coming up with Sinhala synsets and re-

lationships based on the synsets of another lan-

guage requires a lot of manual work. Initially we 

were planning to use the Hindi WordNet as the 

source WordNet but switched to the English 

WordNet a couple of months into the project. 

The reasons for this change are discussed in Sec-

tion 2.2. Apart from this the development effort 

proceeded fairly smoothly and we have complet-

ed the implementation of the WordNet API and 

the crowdsourcing system. Currently we are in 

the process of adding synsets using this system.  

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 

In Section 2, we present the details of the discus-

sions we had with Sinhala language experts and 

the effects these discussions had in the structure 

of the Sinhala WordNet. In Section 3 we discuss 

the technical details of the project. Here, we de-

scribe the use of a NoSQL database to facilitate 

modification to a WordNet, which has not been 

done before to the best of our knowledge. In Sec-

tion 4, we describe how the crowdsourcing sys-

tem works including how it gives suggestions to 

the contributors simplifying their task. We reflect 

on some important aspects of the project includ-

ing the possibility of adopting the entire system 

to other languages in Section 5. We present the 

details of some related work in Section 6 and 

provide concluding remarks in Section 7. 

2 Developing the Linguistic Infrastruc-
ture  

Development of linguistic infrastructure was car-

ried out as the first phase of the project. Several 

discussions with Sinhala language experts were 

conducted to better understand the key features 

of the Sinhala language.  

2.1 Discussions with Sinhala Linguists 

From the beginning of the project the develop-

ment team was collaborating with some promi-

nent experts on Sinhala language. The basic idea 

of this collaboration was to acquire the necessary 

knowledge of the Sinhala language to get to 

know the linguistic requirements of a Sinhala 

WordNet and to form an expert evaluator panel 

to help with the crowdsourcing effort in develop-

ing the WordNet. 

One important topic discussed with the experts 

was that Sinhala has a significant difference in 

written and spoken usage. These differences in-

clude differences in word usage and differences 

in grammar.  We were particularly interested in 

differences in word usage in spoken and written 

forms as grammar rules fall outside the scope of 

a WordNet. It was observed that words with sub-

tle but important differences are used in the writ-

ten and spoken forms of Sinhala. For instance, 

for the sense “man”, මිනිසා (minisa) is the most 

frequent word used in written Sinhalese while 

මිනිහා (miniha) is the most frequent word used in 

spoken Sinhalese. While the difference is subtle 

(a single phoneme in this case) its implications 

are significant for a natural speaker of Sinhala. In 

this case, using මිනිසා in normal conversations 

appears extremely odd. Moreover such differ-

ences are very common and combining words 

used in spoken and written Sinhala results in 

very odd phrases. 

The problem faced by us was whether to in-

clude this difference in the Sinhala WordNet. 

Doing so would go against the main objective of 

a WordNet which is organizing words by their 

meanings; clearly there is no difference in the 

meanings of මිනිසා and මිනිහා as it is simply a 

matter of language usage. Despite this concern, 

we decided to include this difference as a flag for 

each word due to the following reasons.  



1. Not including these in the WordNet would 
result in the loss of a valuable opportunity 

to encode these differences in a machine 

readable manner; the contributors of the 

crowdsourcing system can do this with lit-

tle extra effort but doing it as a separate 

project would require a lot more effort. 

The importance of this factor is magnified 

by the lack of commercial interest in Sin-

hala NLP. 

2. Since one of the primary reasons for de-
veloping a Sinhala WordNet was to serve 

the needs of Sinhala linguists we wanted 

to accommodate their requirements. We 

suspected that eliminating this type of in-

formation would make the WordNet less 

useful to them. Janssen (2002) has made a 

similar argument with regards to eliminat-

ing gender information from WordNets. 

Hence, adding this information to the 

WordNet was seen as a pragmatic move. 

3. Different words being used in spoken and 
written Sinhala is an extremely common 

phenomenon that cannot simply be ig-

nored or left for later consideration.  

By the same reasoning, we decided to add few 

more features of the Sinhala language to the 

WordNet. One of them is the gender difference.  

The genders in Sinhala are masculine and femi-

nine but none are specified for some words (typi-

cally for things that are not alive). The gender of 

a noun is important as it decides which morpho-

logical form of a verb is used with it. Thus the 

Sinhala WordNet will contain the gender of each 

noun, if exists. 

The Sinhala words can be divided into three 

main categories called native words, words di-

rectly borrowed from another language which are 

being used without any change (තත්සම - tatsama) 

and the words borrowed from another language 

and have been modified (තත්භව - tatbawa). The 

words have been mainly borrowed from Sanskrit, 

Pali, Hindi, Portuguese, English, Tamil and 

Dutch. In constructing phrases in Sinhala, the 

origin of the word should be considered similar 

to how the spoken/written differentiation is used. 

As an example ‘mathru’(මාතෘ) and ‘maw’(මව්) 

are two forms to express the meaning “mother’s” 

in Sinhala but ‘mathru’ is a tatsama while ‘maw’ 

is a tatbawa. ‘snehaya’(ස්නේහය) and 

‘senehasa’(නසනෙහස) means ‘affection’ which 

again are tatsama and tatbawa. To express 

“mother’s affection”, people use either ‘mathru 

snehaya’(මාතෘ ස්නේහය) or ‘maw senehasa’(මව් 

නසනෙහස) while the other two combinations ap-

pear odd. This is despite the fact that all four 

words are acceptable in written Sinhala. Thus 

details of the origin of a word are also included 

in the Sinhala WordNet. Both the source lan-

guage and the derivation type (tatsama/tatbawa) 

are kept on this regard. 

Each noun in Sinhala can be in 9 morphologi-

cal forms called ‘vibhakthi’(විභක්ති). Furthermore 

there are fairly complicated rules in forming 

compound words called ‘sandi’(සේධි) and ‘sa-

masa’(සමාස). The formation of these forms and 

rules as well as the inflectional forms of a verb 

are based on the root of the word, which may not 

be the most commonly used form of the word. 

Therefore, it was decided to keep the word root 

as well as the most common morphological form 

in storing a word in the WordNet. 

In summary, we decided to include the follow-

ing features for each word. 

 Written/ Spoken usage 

 Gender 

 Origin of the word 

 Word root 

 The most common morphological form 
It is interesting to relate these features, which 

are deemed important in representing Sinhala 

words in a machine-processable format, to a 

standard lexical-encoding framework. Our dis-

cussion on this regards is based on the lemon 

(Lexicon Model for Ontologies) framework 

(McCrae et al., 2012). Our view is that the writ-

ten/spoken usage and the origin of the word are 

properties under the linguistic description mod-

ule of lemon outside its core. These will be used 

by the phrase-structure module in identifying 

well-formed phrases. The word root is related to 

the morphology module and is used in inflection 

while the most common morphological form is 

the main lexical entry in the core for the word in 

concern. The gender information is useful for 

inflection in the morphology module and in rec-

ognizing words that do not have certain morpho-

logical forms. (e.g., රැජිණ - rajina - the queen 

does not have a masculine form).     

2.2 Selecting the Source WordNet 

As mentioned earlier we decided to develop the 

Sinhala WordNet following the expansion ap-

proach due to practical considerations. Then the 

question was which WordNet to use as the 

source WordNet. We first decided to use the 

Hindi WordNet (Jha et al., 2001) for this purpose 

due to the following reasons. 



1. The Sinhala language belongs to the Indo-
Aryan branch of the Indo-European lan-

guages and is heavily influenced by the clas-

sical Indian languages of Sanskrit and Pali. 

Since Hindi is close to Sanskrit and the Hin-

di WordNet is fairly sophisticated - it serves 

as the hub of the Indo WordNet initiative 

(Bhattacharyya, 2010) - we assumed that the 

Hindi WordNet would provide a good basis 

for developing the Sinhala WordNet. We 

even considered using the Sankrit WordNet 

as the source WordNet but realized that it is 

still in an early stage. 

2. The success of the Indo WordNet initiative 
in creating WordNets for many languages in 

India (Bhattacharyya, 2010) was one of the 

main motivations for us in embarking on this 

project. It was assumed that using the Hindi 

WordNet as the source WordNet would help 

us leverage the success of the Indo WordNet.   

 

However, as we proceeded with the devel-

opment work, it was apparent that using the Hin-

di WordNet as the source WordNet was not a 

viable option. The following are the main rea-

sons for this. 

1. Despite the perceived similarity in the ori-
gins of the languages, Hindi and Sinhala are 

very different languages in many aspects re-

lated to WordNet construction: One difficul-

ty associated with this is that Hindi is written 

in Devanagari script, which is not familiar to 

most Sinhala speakers. (Sinhala has its own 

alphabet). Moreover, for many Hindi words 

it was difficult to identify Sinhala words with 

the same meaning, even after knowing how 

the word is pronounced. It was thought that 

translating Hindi words to Sinhala would be 

easier once the pronunciation is known be-

cause words of the languages are often pro-

nounced similarly – e.g., Sinhala බෑයා 

(baaya) vs. Hindi भाई (bhai) meaning broth-
er. It was seen that such similarities are not 

very common. As a result, we found our-

selves frequently translating words from 

Hindi to English to understand the relevant 

Sinhala words. 

2. It was seen that adopting the technical infra-
structure of the Indo WordNet project to de-

velop the Sinhala WordNet was difficult. 

Part of this is due the communication diffi-

culties – all other WordNets of the Indo 

WordNet have been developed within India 

itself. In addition, our requirement to add 

flags to words in addition to flags for synsets 

as described in Section 2.1 created additional 

complexities and we found that accommo-

dating these changes in the Indo WordNet 

text database stricture was very difficult. The 

Princeton English WordNet (Fellbaum, 

1998), with its extensive documentation and 

the support network was seen as a much bet-

ter alternative in this context. 

3. A significant percentage of native Sinhala 
speakers have a working knowledge in Eng-

lish and it was seen that this will be very use-

ful for a crowdsourcing system. In contrast,  

familiarity with the Hindi language is not 

widespread and this combined with the fact 

that most Hindi words are apparently unfa-

miliar to Sinhala speakers as described in 

(1), means that it is very difficult to use the 

Hindi WordNet in a crowdsourcing system. 

 

Based mainly on the above factors, we 

switched the source WordNet from Hindi to Eng-

lish early in the development stage. The fact that 

the WordNets for Arabic (Rodrıguez et al., 2008) 

and Japanese (Isahara et al., 2008), which have 

very little in common with English, have also 

been developed with the English WordNet as the 

source, also weighed in on our decision.  

We were mindful of the consequences of us-

ing the English WordNet as the source WordNet 

in developing the Sinhala WordNet. It has been 

stated that the source WordNet can have a dis-

tracting influence on the new WordNet being 

created especially when the two languages exist 

in different regions and cultural settings 

(Bhattacharyya, 2010). It is clear that this con-

cern is applicable here. As such we decided to 

aggressively remove existing synsets in the Eng-

lish WordNet and add new synsets as necessary 

when developing the Sinhala WordNet.   

 

3 Developing the Technical Infrastruc-
ture 

After developing the linguistic infrastructure, we 

focused on developing the technical infrastruc-

ture according to the requirements identified. 

The main challenges we faced here were resolv-

ing the complications arising when extending the 

Princeton WordNet API, dealing with different 

data structures, and selecting tools and technolo-

gies. In this section, we describe the salient fea-

tures of the architecture of the system and how 

we approached the above mentioned challenges. 

 



Figure 1: System Architecture 

3.1 The WordNet API  

The Sinhala WordNet API is implemented on the 

Java platform extending the English WordNet 

API (JWNL)
3
. The basic idea of developing this 

API is to provide general WordNet functionali-

ties as well as the specific functionalities of the 

Sinhala WordNet discussed above. We defined 

new classes for synset, word, noun, verb, adjec-

tive and adverb extending the JWNL classes. The 

JWNL documentation and mailing lists were ex-

tremely helpful to us in this exercise. Incorporat-

ing Sinhala characters in the API was based on 

the Sinhala Unicode characters.  

3.2 System Architecture 

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the entire sys-

tem, consisting of the API and the crowdsourcing 

system. For the non-technical users, the main 

outputs of the system are the online and offline 

Sinhala WordNet browsers and the web-based 

interface for the crowdsourcing system. Devel-

opers will have access to these components as 

well as the source code of the Sinhala WordNet 

API, WordNet Constructor Core - which governs 

how the crowdsourcing system operates -, the 

MongoDBToTextDB Transformer and the sche-

mata of the underlying databases.

http://jwordnet.sourceforge.net/han

dbook.html  

The components in the presentation layer get 

the data they need from three sources. 

1. The English WordNet: The data contained in 
the English WordNet text database in terms 

of synsets and relationships are used. 

2. The NoSQL Database: The modifications 
made by contributors of the crowdsourcing 

system to the data of the English WordNet 

are stored in this database. 

3. Linguistic Resources: Several linguistic re-
sources such as available machine readable 

dictionaries for Sinhala are used in providing 

suggestions for the collaborators. 

Components in the Data Access Layer are used 

by the two components in the Process Layer to 

access the necessary data.  

The MongoDBToTextDB transformer gets 

the data from the NoSQL database as well as the 

text database of the English WordNet because 

the NoSQL database only contains the modifica-

tions made by collaborators. It combines the data 

from the two sources into the text database of the 

Sinhala WordNet API. This step is carried out 

when releasing a new version of the Sinhala 

WordNet.  

3.3 Use of a NoSQL Database 

According to the system architecture described 

above, we need a database to store the modifica-

tions performed by the contributors of the 

crowdsourcing system. The modifications in-

clude adding Sinhala words to a synset, adding 

features to words and synsets, adding relation-

http://jwordnet.sourceforge.net/handbook.html
http://jwordnet.sourceforge.net/handbook.html


ships between words/synsets and adding and re-

moving synsets.  

Until recently, the standard solution for this 

type of a data storage need has been to use a rela-

tional database system. However, the use of 

NoSQL databases has increased in the recent 

past partly due to the flexibility it offers to the 

schema designer. Instead of being restricted to a 

relational schema, which often requires multiple 

tuples spread across several relations for the 

same logical data unit, NoSQL databases allows 

the designers to store data according to the se-

mantics behind them. We realized that these ad-

vantages will be important in our system since a 

synset consists of an unlimited number of words, 

each with several distinct features.  

Another advantage of using NoSQL databases 

is that they provide better scalability than rela-

tional database systems especially in setting up 

multiple servers connected to a web-based front-

end. This too will be helpful in using a crow-

sourcing approach for WordNet creation as the 

system will provide better performance for the 

contributors.

Table 1: Schema for Nouns 
 

However, it was noted that NoSQL solutions 

do not guarantee consistency of the database alt-

hough they provide eventual consistency.  There-

fore, it is possible, in rare conditions, for two 

contributors to make contradictory updates in the 

database. In the context of our system, these in-

consistencies can be resolved later, generally in 

evaluation. Moreover any inconsistencies do not 

affect the releases of the Sinhala WordNet as 

they use the text database, assuming that any 

contradictions are resolved before a release.  

We concluded that the advantages of NoSQL 

databases outweigh their disadvantages and de-

cided to use one. We selected the MongoDB 

NoSQL (Plugge et al, 2010) system. Table 1 

shows the schema we used for nouns. To the best 

of our knowledge, this is the first time a NoSQL 

database has been used in developing a Word-

Net.  

Currently, the source repository is maintained 

as a private GitHub project. We will make it pub-

lic in the near future. 

4 The Crowdsourcing System   

4.1 Overview  

As mentioned earlier, a crowdsourcing system to 

facilitate the development of the Sinhala Word-

Net was designed and implemented as a part of 

the project. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Word-

Net Constructor Core component contains the 

major functionalities of this system. It obtains 

different types of data through the components of 

the Data Access Layer and provides an interface 

to be used by the web-based interface of the 

crowdsourcing system. The following are the 

different types of data used by this component 

through the Data Access Layer. 

1. Information contained in the English 
WordNet through the EWN API (JWNL). 

2. Information obtained from several linguis-
tic resources for the Sinhala language in-

cluding machine readable dictionaries and 

thesauri. These are used to specify sugges-

tions to contributors to simplify their task 

as described in Section 4.2. 

3. Information contained in the mongoDB 
database, which contains the modifica-

tions made by the contributors as men-

tioned earlier.  

The web-based user interface allows contributors 

to browse through the English WordNet hierar-

chy and perform modifications as necessary. If 

no work has been done on a particular synset of 

the English WordNet, they will be shown the 

data contained in the English WordNet and are 

expected to replace them with Sinhala words. 

These changes include adding words to synsets, 

specifying flags for the words (e.g., whether the 

word is used in written/spoken Sinhala) and add-

ing relationships. All the modifications are saved 

in the MongoDB database. 



 

Figure 2: The UI of the Crowdsourcing System 
 

Figure 2 shows the web interface when adding 

Sinhala words/relationships for the English syn-

set for one sense of the word “phenomenon”.  

Since Sinhala words have not been added to this 

synset, it shows the available information in the 

English WordNet. In addition, it shows suggest-

ed Sinhala words obtained from linguistic re-

sources as described in Section 4.2. 

The web-based user interface is operational 

and can be accessed from 

http://www.wordnet.lk.  The modifica-

tions made by the contributors have to be ap-

proved by an evaluator before being included in 

a release.  

How to effectively use a crowdsourcing tech-

nique to get a particular task done with accepta-

ble quality is an open research question. Dow et 

al. (2012) have found that assessment of work 

produced, whether it is external assessment or 

self-assessment, if very helpful on this regard. As 

such, we expect the feedback provided by evalu-

ators to help our effort. 

4.2 Providing Suggestions 

The purpose of providing suggestions for con-

tributors is simplifying their task so that they do 

not have to rely entirely on their knowledge and 

available printed material. Currently, we provide 

suggestions for English words based on machine 

readable English to Sinhala and Sinhala to Sinha-

la dictionaries and thesauri. Out of the available 

resources, we found the Madura English-Sinhala 

dictionary (Kulatunga, undefined) particularly 

helpful. We are currently in the process of im-

proving this component by incorporating the the-

http://www.wordnet.lk/


sauri developed by the Department of Official 

Languages of Sri Lanka and a text corpus com-

piled by ourselves.   

5 Discussion 

5.1 The Morphology of the Language 

Sinhala is an inflectional language where many 

verbs and nouns have a fairly large number of 

morphological forms. Verbs and nouns frequent-

ly have more than 10 morphological forms when 

considering both spoken and written forms. This 

has implications for the WordNet as a person or 

a software system searching for a word may use 

a different morphological form from what is con-

tained in the WordNet. We decided against stor-

ing all morphological forms of a word in the 

WordNet since that increases the number of 

words for a synset to an unmanageable level.  As 

such a good morphological analyzer, which is 

external to the WordNet is necessary to obtain 

the full benefits of the WordNet. There have 

been previous attempts to develop a morphologi-

cal analyzer for Sinhala which have produced 

satisfactory results (Hettiage, 2006; Fernando 

and Weerasinghe 2013).  

5.2 Extending to Other Languages 

While we did not develop our system with the 

objective of developing WordNets for languages 

other than Sinhala, we recognize that it has the 

potential to be used in this manner. The architec-

ture of the system has to be changed in some 

places, for example in using linguistic resources 

of other languages for providing suggestions for 

contributors. But the overall design of displaying 

the information of the English WordNet, allow-

ing the contributors to modify them with words 

from the target language and storing the modifi-

cations in the NoSQL database can be easily ap-

plied in developing a WordNet for another lan-

guage based on the English WordNet following 

the expansion approach. It is possible to reuse 

the schema of the MongoDB database and the 

source code of the crowdsourcing interface, the 

WordNet Constructor Core and the MongoD-

BToTextDB Transformer in such an exercise. 

We plan to separate out these parts from our 

codebase as a future work. 

5.3 Current Status 

The crowdsourcing system is currently opera-

tional and the number of synsets in the Sinhala 

WordNet is approaching 2000. This number is 

significant since this has been used as a marker 

by the Indo WordNet project in developing 

WordNets for languages in India (Bhattacharyya, 

2010). Our goal is to release the first complete 

version early next year.  

The Knowledge and Language Engineering 

Lab of the Department of Computer Science and 

Engineering at University of Moratuwa is coor-

dinating this effort.    

6 Related Work 

The Hindi WordNet and the Indo WordNet initi-

ative provided a lot of inspiration to us in at-

tempting to develop a WordNet for Sinhala fol-

lowing the expansion approach. We followed 

their work in several aspects of the project such 

as the use of crowdsourcing to generate synsets. 

There has been a previous work on develop-

ing a WordNet for Sinhla by Welgama et al. 

(2011), which is basically an exploration on de-

veloping a WordNet for Sinhala by extracting 

some common words from a corpus and getting 

the help of Sinhala language experts to come up 

with synsets based on them. It can be seen that 

this work is related to the merge approach. Our 

work differs from this effort in our use of the 

expansion approach and the objective of devel-

oping a complete WordNet.   

7 Conclusion 

Developing a fully functional Sinhala WordNet 

can be considered a landmark in NLP for Sinhala 

and we believe that we are well set to achieve 

this in the near future. This will provide a tre-

mendous boost for developing Sinhala NLP ap-

plications such as information retrieval systems, 

text classifiers and summarizers and translators.  

The availability of a platform in terms of a 

WordNet may even attract some commercial in-

terest for Sinhala NLP. 

It should also be recognized that our work has 

the potential to be generalized into a system that 

can be used to bootstrap WordNet creation for a 

language. If this goal can be achieved, it will be 

extremely helpful in developing WordNets for 

minority languages such as Sinhala.
