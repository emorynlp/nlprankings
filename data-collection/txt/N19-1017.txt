Abstract
Languages evolve and diverge over time. Their
evolutionary history is often depicted in the
shape of a phylogenetic tree. Assuming pars-
ing models are representations of their lan-
guages grammars, their evolution should fol-
low a structure similar to that of the phylo-
genetic tree. In this paper, drawing inspira-
tion from multi-task learning, we make use
of the phylogenetic tree to guide the learning
of multi-lingual dependency parsers leverag-
ing languages structural similarities. Experi-
ments on data from the Universal Dependency
project show that phylogenetic training is ben-
eficial to low resourced languages and to well
furnished languages families. As a side prod-
uct of phylogenetic training, our model is able
to perform zero-shot parsing of previously un-
seen languages.

1 Introduction
Languages change and evolve over time. A com-
munity that spoke once a single language can
be split geographically or politically, and if the
separation is long enough their language will di-
verge in direction different enough so that at some
point they might not be intelligible to each other.
The most striking differences between related lan-
guages are often of lexical and phonological order
but grammars also change over time.

Those divergent histories are often depicted in
the shape of a tree in which related languages
whose common history stopped earlier branch off
higher than languages that have shared a longer
common trajectory (Jäger, 2015). We hypothe-
size that building on this shared history is bene-
ficial when learning dependency parsing models.
We thus propose to use the phylogenetic structure
to guide the training of multi-lingual graph-based
neural dependency parsers that will tie parameters
between languages according to their common his-
tory.

As our phylogenetic learning induces parsing
models for every inner node in the phylogenetic
tree, it can also perform zero-shot dependency
parsing of unseen languages. Indeed, one can use
the model of the lowest ancestor (in the tree) of a
new language as an approximation of that language
grammar.

We assess the potential of phylogenetic training
with experiments on data from the Universal De-
pendencies project version 2.2. Our results show
that parsers indeed benefit from this multi-lingual
training regime as models trained with the phy-
logenetic tree outperform independently learned
models. The results on zero-shot parsing show that
a number of factors such as the genre of the data
and the writing system have a significant impact on
the quality of the analysis of an unseen language,
with morphological analysis being of great help.

The remaining of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 presents both the neural pars-
ing model as well as the phylogenetic training
procedure. Section 3 presents some experiments
over data from UD 2.2. Section 4 presents some
related works on multi-task learning and multi-
lingual parsing. Finally, Section 5 closes the paper
and gives some future perspectives.

2 Model

We propose a multi-task learning framework that
shares information between tasks using a tree
structure. The tree structure allows us to both share
model parameters and training samples between
related tasks. We instantiate it with a graph-based
neural parser and use the language phylogenetic
tree to guide the learning process, but it can in prin-
ciple be used with any tree that encodes tasks re-
lateness and any learning algorithm that supports
fine-tuning.

In this section we first describe the intuition be-

2.1 Phylogenetic Hypothesis
Languages evolve from earlier stages and some-
times a language will change differently in different
places leading to different languages with a com-
mon ancestor. This evolution process is often de-
picted in the shape of a tree in which leaves are
actual languages and inner nodes can be either at-
tested ancestral languages or their idealized recon-
struction. Figure 1 gives an example of such a tree
for a subset of the Slavic family of Indo-European
languages (Simons and Fennig, 2018).

Just as languages evolve and diverge, so do their
grammars. Assuming a parsing model is a param-
eterized representation of a grammar, then we can
expect those models to evolve in a similar way. We
thus take a multi-task approach to the problem of
multi-lingual dependency parsing. What was once
a single problem (e.g. parsing sentences in Proto-
West-Slavic) becomes a set of distinct but related
problems (parsing sentences in Czech, Polish, Slo-
vak and Sorbian) as Proto-West-Slavic was evolv-
ing into its modern descendants.

We assume that the grammar of the last com-
mon ancestor is a good approximation of those
languages grammars. Thus it should be easier to
learn a language’s grammar starting from its ances-
tor grammar than from scratch. There are however
some issues with this assumption. First, a language
grammar can be very different from its ancestor
one from two millennia earlier. Consider the differ-
ence between modern French and early Classical
Latin for example, in two millennia Latin has wit-

nessed the loss of its case system and a complete
refoundation of its verbal system. And the ”last
common” ancestors can have very different age de-
pending on the languages we consider. We expect
the common ancestor of Tagalog and Indonesian
to be much much older than the common ances-
tor of Portuguese and Galician. Second, a lot of
languages have only started to be recorded very re-
cently thus lacking historical data all together. And
when historical records are available, much work
still needs to be done to render those data usable by
parsers. For example the Universal Dependencies
Project (Nivre et al., 2018) only has annotated cor-
pora for Latin, old Greek, old Church Slavonic and
Sanskrit. And even for those classical languages,
it is not clear to which extent their modern coun-
terparts really descend from them. Thus we need
to find another way to access the ancestor language
grammar than using historical data.

We propose to use all the data from descendent
languages to represent an ancestor language. In
principle, one could give more weight to older lan-
guages or to languages that are known to be more
conservative, but this knowledge is not available
for all languages families. Thus we resort to using
all the available data from descendent languages
without distinction.

Another problem is that the tree view is too sim-
ple to represent the complete range of phenom-
ena involved in language evolution, such as lan-
guage contacts. Furthermore, languages do not
evolve completely randomly, but follow some lin-
guistic universals and have to keep a balance be-
tween speakability, learnability and understand-
ability. Thus, languages can share grammatical
features without necessarily being genetically re-
lated, either by contact or by mere chance. How-
ever, the tree model is still a good starting point
in practice and language families align well with
grammatical similarity as recent works on typolog-
ical analysis of UD treebanks have shown (Chen
and Gerdes, 2017; Schluter and Agić, 2017). We
thus make the simplifying assumption that a lan-
guage grammar evolves only from an older stage
and can be approximated by that previous stage.

2.2 Neural Model

Our scoring model is an edge factored graph-based
neural model in the vein of recent works by Dozat
et al. (Dozat et al., 2017). There are two major
differences here compared to the parser of Dozat

et al. The first difference is in individual word rep-
resentation, for which we use only the UPOS1 tag,
morphological information provided by UD tree-
banks and a character based word representation,
whilst Dozat et al. use also the XPOS2 tag, holis-
tic word vectors (from Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) and their own) and they do not use morpho-
logical information beside what might already be
given by the XPOS. The second difference is the
scoring function proper. While they use biaffine
scoring functions and decouple edge scoring from
label scoring, we use a simple multi-layer percep-
tron to compute label scores and pick the max over
the label as the edge score.

Let x = (w1w2...wl) be a sentence of length l.
Each word wi is represented as the concatenation
of 3 subvectors, one for its part-of-speech, one for
its morphological attributes and one for its form:

wi = posi ⊕ morphi ⊕ chari.

The part-of-speech vector (posi) is from a look
up table. The morphological vector (morphi) is
the sum of the representation mm of each morpho-
logical attribute m of the word given by the tree-
banks:

morphi =
∑

m∈morphi

mm.

We add a special dummy attribute representing the
absence of morphological attributes.

The form vector (chari) is computed by a
character BiLSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997). Characters are fed one by one to the recur-
rent neural network in each direction. The actual
form vector is then the concatenation of the outputs
of the forward character LSTM and of the back-
ward character LSTM as depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 3: Neural network architecture for edge scoring.
The contextualised representation of the governor (eat)
and the dependent (Cats) are concatenated and passed
through a rectified linear layer and a final plain linear
layer to get a vector of label scores.

Once, each word has been given a representation
in isolation, those representations are passed to two
other BiLSTMs. Each word is then represented as
the concatenation of its contextualised vector from
the forward and backward layers:

ci = forward(w1, ...,wi)⊕backward(wi, ...,wl).

We actually train two different BiLSTMs, one rep-
resenting words as dependents (c) and one words
as governors (ĉ). An edge score is then computed
as follows. Its governor word vector ĉi and its de-
pendent word vector cj are concatenated and fed
to a two layer perceptron (whose weights are L1
and L2) with a rectifier (noted [...]+) after the first
layer in order to compute the score sijl of the edge
for every possible relation label l:

sij = max
l

sijl = max
l
(L2 · [L1 · (ĉi ⊕ cj)]+)l.

All the neural model parameters θ (part-of-
speech, character and morphological embeddings,
character, dependant and governor BiLSTMs and
the two layer perceptron weights) are trained end
to end via back propagation one sentence at a time.
Given a sentence x, we note j the index of the gov-
ernor of wi and l the relation label of wi, the loss
function is:

loss(x) =

195

For each word, there are two terms. The first term
enforces that for all potential governors that are
neither the word itself nor its actual governor, their
highest score (irrespective of the relation label)
should be smaller than the score of the actual gov-
ernor and actual label by a margin of 1. The sec-
ond term is similar and enforces that for the actual
governor, any label that is not the true label should
have a score smaller than the score of the actual
label again by a margin of 1.

2.3 Phylogenetic Training
Let L = {l1, l2, ..., lnl} be a set of nl languages
and let P = {p1, p2, ..., pnp} be a set of np proto-
languages (hypothesized ancestors of languages in
L). Let T be a tree over L∗ = L∪P such that lan-
guages of L are leaves and proto-languages of P
are inner nodes. This means that we assume no two
languages in L share a direct parenthood relation,
but they at best descend both from a hypothesized
parent. We could in principle have data appearing
only in inner nodes. Tree T has a single root, a
proto-language from P that all grammars descend
from. This ancestor of all languages shall model
linguistic universals3 and ensure we deal with a
well formed tree. We use the notation p > l for
the fact that language/node l descends from lan-
guage/node p.

For each language l ∈ L, we assume access to
a set of n annotated examples Dl. For each proto-
language p ∈ P , we create an annotated set Dp =⋃

p>l Dl as the union of its descendent sets.
For each language l ∈ L∗, we want to learn a

parsing model θl.

2.3.1 Model Evolution
The main idea behind phylogenetic training is to
initialize a new model with the model of its parent,
thus effectively sharing information between lan-
guages and letting models diverged and specialize
over time. The training pocedure is summarized in
Algorithm 1.

At the beginning, we initialize a new blank/ran-
dom model that will be the basic parsing model
for all the world languages. Then, we sample sen-
tences (we will discuss sampling issues in next sec-
tion) randomly from all the available languages,
parse them, compute the loss and update the model
accordingly. Since the training sentences are sam-
pled from all the available languages, the model

monoglotto genesis hypothesis.

will learn to be as good as possible for all the lan-
guages at the same time.

When the model θp has reached an optimum
(that we defined hereafter), we pass a copy of it to
each of its children. Thus, for each child c of p, we
initialize θ0c = θp to its parent (p) final state. Each
model θc is then refined on its own data set Dc
which is a subset of Dp, until it reaches its own op-
timum state and is passed down to its own children.
This process is repeated until the model reaches a
leaf language, where the model θc is eventually re-
fined over its mono-lingual data set Dc.

By passing down optimal models from
older/larger languages sets to newer/smaller
ones, models get the chance to learn relevant
information from many different languages while
specializing as time goes by.

The question now is to find when to pass down
a model to its children. In other words, at which
stage has a model learned the most it could from its
data and should start to diverge to improve again?

Following the principle of cross-validation, we



196

propose to let held-out data decide when is the
right time to pass the model down. Let D′p be a set
of held-out sentences from the same languages as
Dp. Then, after every epoch i of k training exam-
ples, we freeze the model θip, and test it on k′ sen-
tences from D′p. This gives a score ai (UAS/LAS)
to the current model. If the score is higher than
the score of the previous model θi−1p then training
goes on, otherwise we discard it and retrain θi−1p
for another k sentences. If after having discarded r
epochs in a raw we have not yet found a better one,
then we assume we have reached an optimal model
θi−1p and pass it on to its children (unless it is a leaf,
in which training is over for that language).

2.3.2 Sentence Sampling
There are a few things we should consider when
drawing examples from a proto-language distribu-
tion. Beside the question of whether some lan-
guages are more conservative than others with re-
spect to their ancestor, which we have decided to
simplify saying that all languages are as represen-
tative of their ancestors, there is the problem of
data unbalance and tree unbalance.

Sampling sentences uniformly across languages
is not a viable option for the size of datasets varies
a lot across languages and that they do not cor-
relate with how close a language is to its ances-
tor. For example, there are 260 Belarusian training
sentences against 48814 Russian ones. The basic
question is thus whether one should draw exam-
ples from languages or branches. Basic linguistic
intuition tells us that drawing should be performed
on branches. Modern languages distribution has
no reason to reflect their proximity to their ances-
tor language. Amongst Indo-European languages,
there are one or two Armenian languages as well
as one or two Albanian languages (depending on
the criteria for being a language), while there are
tens of Slavic languages and Romance languages.
However, there is no reason to believe that Slavic or
Romance languages are better witnesses of proto-
Indo-European than Armenian or Albanian.

Drawing examples from languages would bias
the intermediate models toward families that have
more languages (or more treebanks). It might be
a good bias depending on the way one compute
the overall accuracy of the system. If one uses the
macro-average of the individual language parsers,
then biasing models toward families with many
members should improve the accuracy overall.

In this work, at a given inner node, we decided

to sample uniformly at random over branches span-
ning from this node, then uniformly at random over
languages and then uniformly at random over sen-
tences. It boils down to flattening the subtree be-
low an inner node to have a maximum depth of 2.
For example in Figure 1, at the root (Proto-Slavic)
we pick a branch at random (e.g. Proto-South-
Slavic), then a language at random (e.g. Croatian)
then a sentence at random. Given that we have
picked the Proto-South-Slavic branch, all South-
Slavic languages are then as likely to be chosen.
This biases slightly the model toward bigger sub-
families. In our example, Croatian and Serbian
have the same chances to be sampled than Slove-
nian, therefore their family, Proto-Serbocroatian is
twice as likely to be chosen as Slovenian is, while
being at the same depth in the tree.

We could otherwise sample over branches, then
over sub-branches again and again until we reach
a leaf and only then pick a sentence. In this case,
Proto-Serbocroatian and Slovenian would have the
same probability to be chosen. This would give
much more weight to languages high in the tree
than languages low in the tree. While this would
give more balance to the actual model, it could be
detrimental to the averaged results since the data
distribution is itself unbalanced. It would of course
be possible to try any variation between those two,
picking sub-branches according to a probability
that would depend on the number of languages in
that family for example, therefore mitigating the
unbalance problem.

2.4 Zero-Shot Parsing

An interesting property of the phylogenetic train-
ing procedure is that it provides a model for each
inner node of the tree and thus each intermediary
grammar. If one were to bring a new language with
its position in the tree, then we can use the pre-
trained model of its direct ancestor as an initializa-
tion instead of learning a new model from scratch.
Similarly, one can use this ancestor model directly
to parse the new language, effectively performing
zero-shot dependency parsing. We investigate this
possibility in the experiment section.

3 Experiments

To assess the potential of phylogenetic training
both in terms of multi-task learning and zero-shot
parsing capabilities, we experimented with data
from the Universal Dependencies project version



197

2.2 (Nivre et al., 2018). When several corpora are
available for a language, we chose one to keep a
good balance between morphological annotation
and number of sentences. For example, the Por-
tuguese GSD treebank has slightly more sentences
than the Bosque treebank but it is not well morpho-
logically annotated. The zero-shot parsing models
have been directly tested on languages that lack of
training set. The treebanks names are given in the
tree 4 and the result table 1.

3.1 Setting

As some languages have no training data and
unique writing systems making the character
model inefficient for them, we resorted to use
gold parts-of-speech and morphological attributes
rather than predicted ones. For example, Thai has
no training data, no language relative and a unique
script, which altogether make it really hard to parse
(from a phylogenetic perspective).

The phylogenetic tree used for the experiment
is adapted from the Ethnologue (2018). For space
reasons, it is reported in the appendix in Figures 4
and 5. We tried to have a tree as consensual as pos-
sible, but there are still a few disputable choices,
mostly about granularity and consistency. Sanskrit
could have its own branch in the Indic family just as
Latin in the Romance family, but because Sanskrit
has no training data, that would not actually change
the results. Likewise, as Czechoslovak and Dutch-
Afrikaans have their own branches, Scandinavian
languages could also distributed between east and
west Scandinavian. As an English based Creole,
Naija could as well be put in the Germanic family,
but we kept it as a separate (Creole) family.

Regarding model training proper, we used k =
500 training sentences per iteration, k′ = 500
held-out sentences from the developpement set to
compute running LAS and a maximum number of
reboot r = 5. Following Dozat et al (2017), we
use Eisner algorithm (Eisner, 1996) at test time to
ensure outputs are well formed trees. The neu-
ral model is implemented in Dynet (Neubig et al.,
2017) and we use Adadelta with default parame-
ters as our trainer. We averaged the results over
5 random initializations. Independent models are
trained in the same manner but with mono-lingual
data only. We report both labeled and unlabeled
edge prediction accuracy (UAS/LAS). In the ap-
pendix we also report results averaged per family.

3.2 Multi-Task Learning

Table 1 reports parsing results for languages that
have a training set. Note that a few languages do
not have a separate developpement set, then we
used the training set for both training and valida-
tion. The training set size of those languages is
reported in square brackets. This has low to no im-
pact on other languages results but it can be prob-
lematic for the language itself as it can over-fit its
training data especially when they are very few as
is the case of Buryat for example. To be fair, we re-
port two different averages. Avg is the average over
languages that have a separate developpement set,
and Avg No Dev is the average over languages that
do not have a separate developpement set. For each
language, the best UAS/LAS are reported in bold.

On average, phylogenetic training improves
parsing accuracy, both labeled and unlabeled. This
is especially true for languages that have very small
training sets (50 sentences or less) and lack of de-
veloppement set. Those languages show an aver-
aged 7 points improvement and up to 15 points
(hsb, kmr). Since independent mono-lingual mod-
els follow the exact same training procedure but
without phylogenetic initialization and that every
sentence will be seen several times both at train-
ing and validation, the sampling method cannot ex-
plain such a difference. This shows that the ances-
tor’s model is a good initialization and acts as a
form of regularization, slowing down over-fitting.

Phylogenetic training is also beneficial as one
gains information from related languages. Indo-
European languages gain from sharing informa-
tion. This is especially true for Balto-Slavic (sk
+5.82, lt +5.07 UAS) and Indo-Iranian languages
(mr +2.05 UAS). It is less consistent for Romance
and Germanic languages. This might be due to the
tree not representing well typology for those fami-
lies. Typically, English tends to group syntactically
with Scandinavian languages more than with West-
Germanic. Turkic and Uralic languages show the
same benefits overall (ug +2.67, fi +3.39 UAS).

Dravidian and Afro-Asiatic languages are not as
consistent. While Telugu seems to gain from Tamil
data, the reverse is not true. Result variation for
Arabic, Hebrew and Coptic are marginal. This is
likely due to the fact that we only have three quite
different languages from that family and that they
all have their own script.

Similarly, phylogenetic training is not consis-
tently useful for languages that do not have rela-

tives. While Buryat (bxr) that has a very small
training set benefits from universal linguistic in-
formation and gain almost 11 points UAS, Basque
(eu) that has a very different grammatical struc-
ture than other languages and enough training
data (5396 sentences) looses 3.25 LAS. Gains and
losses are marginal for the other five languages (id,
ja, ko, vi, zh).

Overall results are a bit below the state of the
art, but the model is very simple and relies on gold
morphology, so it is not really comparable.

3.3 Zero-Shot Parsing

Table 2 reports parsing results for languages that
do not have a training set. Because of phylogenetic
training and the tree structure that guides it, it can
happen that a language ancestor’s model is in fact
trained on data only accounting for a narrow range
of later stages. For example, while Faroese uses
the North-Germanic model refined on both Nor-
wegians, Swedish and Danish data, Tagalog uses
the Austronesian model only refined with Indone-
sian data thus making it more an Indonesian model
than an actual Austronesian model. Those cases
are marked by an asterisk in the table. Komi (kpv)
model is refined on Finno-Samic data, Breton (br)
model on Irish data, Cantonese (yue) model on
Mandarin data.

Looking at Table 2, we make the following ob-
servations. As expected scores are on average
lower than for languages with training data, how-
ever the UAS/LAS gap is substantially bigger from
6.781 to 17.08 points. It is hard to compare to other
works on zero-shot parsing since they use different
data and scores span a big range, but our results are
comparable to those of Aufrant et al. (2016) and
Naseem et al. (2012), while our zero-shot mod-
els are given for free by the phylogenetic training
method.



199

On a language per language basis, we see that
there are a few important factors, the most strik-
ing being genre. Tagalog (tl) and more surpris-
ingly Warlpiri (wbp) have relatively high parsing
accuracy despite being either completely isolated
or having only one relative (Indonesian). This is
likely because their data are well annotated stereo-
typical sentences extracted from grammars, thus
making them easy to parse.

Then we see that Naija (pcm) and Yoruba (yo)
are about 25 points higher than Thai (th) despite
them three having low morphology (in the tree-
banks). As they have different genres (spoken,
bible, news and wiki), without a deeper look at the
trees themselves, our best guess is that this is due
to Thai having a different script. Naija and Yoruba
both use the Latin alphabet, and as such they can
rely to some extent on the character model to share
information with other languages, to at least or-
ganise the character space. This analysis would
also carry for Cantonese (yue). It is a morphologi-
cally simple language, and despite having a relative
(Mandarin), its score is rather low. The genre alone
(spoken) would not explain everything as Naija has
also a spoken treebank and a higher score. The
writing system might be at blame once again. In-
deed, Chinese characters are very different from
alphabetic characters and are much harder to use
in character models because of sparsity. Compar-
ing Mandarin and Cantonese test sets with Man-
darin train set, the amount of out-of-vocabulary
words is 32.47% of types (11.90% of tokens) for
Mandarin and 54.88% of types (56.50% of tokens)
for Cantonese. The results for out-of-vocabulary
characters are even more striking with 3.73% of
types (0.49% of tokens) for Mandarin and 12.97%
of types (34.29% of tokens) for Cantonese. This
shows that not only there are a lot of OOV in Can-
tonese test set, but that those words/characters are
common ones as 12.97% of character types miss-
ing make up for more than a third of all character
tokens missing, where on the contrary Mandarin
OOV are seldom and account for less tokens per-
centage than types. This is one more argument
supporting the importance of the character vector.

Other important factors are typology and mor-
phology. Amharic (am) despite its unique script
has a higher score than Cantonese that actually
shares its scripts (to some extent as we have seen)
with Mandarin. The key point for Amharic score,
is that all its relatives (Hebrew, Arabic and Cop-

tic) have their own scripts and are morphologi-
cally rich, thus the model learns to use morpho-
logical information. The analysis is similar for
Komi which on top of sharing morphology with its
relatives also share the writing system which pro-
vides it an extra gain. However, this might word
in the opposite direction as well, as we can see
with Faroese, Breton and Sanskrit. Faroese (fo) is
morphologically rich and that should help, how-
ever its North-Germanic relatives are morpholog-
ically much simpler. Thus the model does not
learn to rely on morphological attributes nor on
word endings for the character model as much.
The same is true for Sanskrit (sa), which is mor-
phologically richer than its modern Indic relatives,
with an extra layer of specific writing systems.
Eventually, Breton model (br) is refined over Irish
data only and while Irish is a typological outlier
amongst Indo-European languages because of its
Verb-Subject-Object word order, Breton has the
standard Subject-Verb-Object, thus using Irish data
might actually be detrimental.

These arguments show the respective impor-
tance of the writing system, the genre of the
data, the morphological analysis and the typol-
ogy in phylogenetic zero-shot dependency parsing.
Those factors can either work together positively
(Komi) or negatively (Cantonese) or cancel each
other out (Amharic, Faroese).

4 Related Work

The goal of multi-task learning is to learn related
tasks (either sharing their input and/or output space
of participating of the same pipeline) jointly in or-
der to improve their models over independently
learned one (Caruana, 1997). In Søgaard et al.
(2016), task hierarchy is directly encoded in the
neural model allowing tasks with different output
space to share parts of their parameters (POS tag-
ging comes at a lower level than CCG parsing and
only back-propagates to lower layers). Likewise, in
Johnson et al. (2017), the encoder/decoder archi-
tecture allows to learn encoders that target several
output languages and decoders than handle data
from various input languages. However, in multi-
task learning literature, task relationships are of-
ten fixed. In Cavallanti et al. (2010) tasks with
the same output spaces share parameter updates
through a fixed similarity graph. In this work,
changing level in the tree can be seen as splitting
the similarity graph into disjoint sub graphs. It is



200

a way to have tasks relationships evolving during
training and to encode information about task evo-
lution that lacks in other multi-task methods.

In multi-lingual parsing, Ammar et al. (2016)
propose to train a single model to parse many lan-
guages using both typological information, cross-
lingual word representations and language specific
information. While their model gives good results,
they only apply it to 7 Germanic and Romance lan-
guages. It would be worth doing the experiment
with 50+ languages and see how the results would
change. However, because of language specific
information their model would probably become
very big. In this work, language specific informa-
tion is not added on the top of the model, but is
just language generic information that refines over
time.

Che et al. (2017; 2018) and Stymne et al. (2018)
propose to train parsers on several concatenated
treebanks either from the same language or from
related languages and to fine-tune the parsers on
individual treebanks afterward to fit specific lan-
guages/domains. The main difference with our
method, is that instead of one step of fine-tuning,
we perform as many fine-tuning as there are ances-
tors in the tree, each time targeting more and more
specific data. This in turn requires that we han-
dle data imbalance therefore using sampling rather
than plain concatenation.

Aufrant et al. (2016) propose to tackle zero-
shot parsing by rewriting source treebanks to bet-
ter fit target language typology. Assuming that ty-
pology is homogeneous in a language family, the
phylogeny should drive models to be typologically
aware. However, as we have seen for Breton and
Irish, that assumption might not always hold.

Eventually, the closest work from our in spirit is
the one of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010). They
use a phylogenetic tree to guide the training of un-
supervised dependency parsing models of several
languages, using ancestor models to tie descendent
ones. The main difference here beside supervision,
is that we do not use ancestor models as biases but
rather as initialization of descendent models.

5 Conclusion

We have presented a multi-task learning frame-
work that allows one to train models for several
tasks that have diverged over time. Leveraging
their common evolutionary history through a phy-
logenetic tree, models share parameters and train-

ing samples until they need to diverge. As a by
product of this phylogenetic training, we are pro-
vided with intermediary models that can be used
to zero-shot a new related task, given its position
in the evolutionary history.

We have applied this framework to dependency
parsing using a graph-based neural parser and the
phylogenetic tree of the languages from UD 2.2 to
guide the training process. Our results show that
phylogenetic training is beneficial for well popu-
lated families such as Indo-European and Uralic. It
also helps generalization and prevents over-fitting
when very few data are available. For zero-shot
parsing, genre, writing system and morphology are
crucial factors for the quality of parse predictions.

Some works have been done on automatically
learning task relationship in multi-task setting. It
would be interesting to see how the algorithm
could figure out when and how to cluster languages
automatically as phylogenetic trees do not directly
depict grammar evolution.

Our model does not know that Latin came before
Old French and before modern French, or that de-
spite being Germanic, English underwent a heavy
Romance influence. It would be worth investigat-
ing softening the tree constraints and instigating
more evolutionary information in the structure.

Another important point is that we use gold part-
of-speech and morphological information which is
unlikely to be available in real scenarios. However,
our new training procedure can be applied to any
task, so a future work would be to use it to perform
phylogenetic POS tagging.

Other directions for the future are designing bet-
ter sampling methods as well as better ways to mea-
sure training convergence at each level.

Table 3: Parsing results for phylogenetic and indepen-
dent neural models averaged by language family. Fami-
lies are sorted in the same order as they appear in Table
1. Indo-European averages include Armenian (hy) and
Irish (ga). Global averages are repeated for complete-
ness. Best results are reported in bold.

Figure 4: Phylogenetic tree used to guide the training
process of the multi-lingual parser. Underlined lan-
guages are those that do not have a training set. The
code of the language and if necessary the name of the
treebank are given in parentheses. The Indo-European
sub-tree is depicted on the right.

Figures 4 and 5 represent the phylogenetic tree
used for guiding the training process. As we only
use data from the UD project 2.2, we collapse
unique child so that Vietnamese is not an Austro-
Asiatic language, it is just Vietnamese. We also
only use well attested families, thus Buryat, a Mon-
golic language, is alone and not linked to Turkic
languages. Maybe, the most disputable choice is
to put Naija in its own Creole family instead of the
Germanic family.
