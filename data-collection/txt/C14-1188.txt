Abstract

We describe two systems for text simplification using typed dependency structures, one that
performs lexical and syntactic simplification, and another that performs sentence compression
optimised to satisfy global text constraints such as lexical density, the ratio of difficult words, and
text length. We report a substantial evaluation that demonstrates the superiority of our systems,
individually and in combination, over the state of the art, and also report a comprehension based
evaluation of contemporary automatic text simplification systems with target non-native readers.

1 Introduction

Text simplification has often been defined as the process of reducing the grammatical and lexical com-
plexity of a text, while still retaining the original information content and meaning. However, text can
also be simplified in other ways; for instance, by removing peripheral information to reduce text length,
through sentence compression or summarisation. A key goal of automatic text simplification is to make
information more accessible to the large numbers of people with reduced literacy, motivated by a large
body of evidence that manual text simplification is an effective intervention (Anderson and Freebody,
1981; L’Allier, 1980; Beck et al., 1991; Anderson and Davison, 1988; Linderholm et al., 2000; Kamalski
et al., 2008). However automatic text simplification systems have rarely been evaluated in a manner that
sheds light on whether they can facilitate target users.

To date, evaluations of automatic text simplification have been (a) performed on a small scale, as few
as 20–25 sentences in some cases (Wubben et al., 2012; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014; Narayan and
Gardent, 2014), (b) performed on sentences in isolation, thus not measuring incoherence caused at the
inter-sentential level that can make text more difficult (Siddharthan (2003a) being the exception), and
(c) performed using either automatic metrics (Zhu et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Woodsend
and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Paetzold and Specia, 2013) or using ratings by fluent read-
ers for fluency, simplicity and meaning preservation (Siddharthan, 2006; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;
Wubben et al., 2012; Paetzold and Specia, 2013; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014; Narayan and Gardent,
2014; Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014). As such, none of these evaluations can help us answer the basic
question: How good is automatic text simplification; i.e., would it facilitate poor readers?

Our goals in this paper are twofold. First, we want to evaluate text simplification systems more sys-
tematically than has been attempted before, using both human judgements on a larger scale, and directly
testing comprehension on longer passages for target reader populations. Second, we want to compare
two different approaches to text simplification. In this paper, we present a text simplification system that
can perform lexical and syntactic simplification (§3), as well as a novel sentence compression system
designed specifically for the text simplification task (§4), in that it favours compressions with fewer diffi-
cult words and with more function words such as connectives that are known to improve readability. We
evaluate both, as well as a hybrid system that performs both text simplification and compression (§5, 6).

2 Related Work

Text simplification systems differ primarily in the level of linguistic knowledge they encode. Phrase
Based Machine Translation (PBMT) systems (Specia, 2010; Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak,
2011) use the least knowledge, and as such are ill equipped to handle simplifications that require mor-
phological changes, syntactic reordering, sentence splitting or insertions. While syntax based MT ap-
proaches use syntactic knowledge, existing systems do not offer a treatment of morphology (Zhu et al.,
2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Paetzold and Specia, 2013). This means that while some syntactic
reordering operations can be performed well, others requiring morphological changes cannot. Consider
converting passive to active voice (e.g., from “trains are liked by John” to “John likes trains”). Besides
deleting auxiliaries and reordering the arguments of the verb, there is also a requirement to modify the
verb to make it agree in number with the new subject “John”, and take the tense of the auxiliary “are”.

Hand crafted systems such as Siddharthan (2010) and Siddharthan (2011) use transformation rules that
encode morphological changes as well as deletions, re-orderings, substitutions and sentence splitting,
and can handle voice change correctly. However, hand crafted systems are limited in scope to syntactic
simplification as there are too many lexico-syntactic and lexical simplifications to enumerate manually.

Some contemporary work in text simplification has evolved from research in sentence compression,
a related research area that aims to shorten sentences for the purpose of summarising the main content.
Sentence compression has historically been addressed in a generative framework, where transformation
rules are learnt from parsed corpora of sentences aligned with manually compressed versions, using
ideas adapted from statistical machine translation. The compression rules learnt are typically syntactic
tree-to-tree transformations (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Riezler et al., 2003;
Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Nomoto, 2008) of some variety. Indeed, Woodsend and Lapata (2011) develop
this line of research. Their model is based on quasi-synchronous tree substitution grammar (QTSG)
(Smith and Eisner, 2006) and integer linear programming. Quasi-synchronous grammars aim to relax
the isomorphism constraints of synchronous grammars, in this case by generating a loose alignment
between parse trees. Woodsend and Lapata (2011) use QTSG to generate all possible rewrite operations
for a source tree, and then integer linear programming to select the most appropriate simplification. Their
system performs lexical and syntactic simplification as well as compression.

Recently, there have been attempts to combine approaches. Narayan and Gardent (2014) use an ap-
proach based on semantics to perform syntactic simplification, and PBMT for lexical simplifications.
We have also created a hybrid system, but one using linguistically sound hand written rules for syntac-
tic simplification and automatically acquired rules for lexicalised constructs (Siddharthan and Mandya,
2014; Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014). In this paper we combine this work (summarised in §3) with a
new method for sentence compression (described in §4).

3 Text Simplification with Synchronous Dependency Grammars

We use the RegenT text simplification (Siddharthan, 2011), augmented with automatically acquired rules,
as described in detail elsewhere (Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014). In
this section, we will restrict ourselves to summarising the key features of the system.

Our text simplification system follows the architecture proposed in Ding and Palmer (2005) for Syn-
chronous Dependency Insertion Grammars, reproduced in Fig. 1. It uses the same dataset1 as Woodsend
and Lapata (2011) for learning lexicalised rules. The rules are acquired in the format required by the Re-
genT text simplification system (Siddharthan, 2011), which is used to implement the simplification. This

Figure 2: Simplification as a Transfer rule and a transduction of Elementary Trees (ETs)

requires dependency parses from the Stanford Parser, and generates output sentences from dependency
parses using the generation-light approach described in (Siddharthan, 2011).

In short, we extract a synchronous grammar from dependency parses of aligned English and sim-
ple English sentences, starting from the differences in the parses. For example, consider two aligned
sentences from the aligned corpus described in Woodsend and Lapata (2011):

1. (a) It was the second most intensive storm on the planet in 1989.
(b) It was the second strongest storm on the planet in 1989.

An automatic comparison of the dependency parses for the two sentences reveals that there are two
typed dependencies that occur only in the parse of the first sentence, and one that occurs only in the parse
of the second. Thus, to convert the first sentence into the second, two dependencies need to be deleted
and one inserted. From this example, the rule shown in Fig. 2 is extracted. The rule contains variables
(?Xn), which can be forced to match certain words in square brackets.

Such deletion and insertion operations are central to text simplification, but a few other operations
are also needed to handle morphology and to avoid broken dependency links in the Target ETs. These
are enumerated in (Siddharthan, 2011). By collecting such rules, a meta-grammar is produced that can
translate dependency parses in one language (English) into the other (simplified English). The rule
above will translate “most intensive” to “strongest”, in the immediate lexical context of “storm”. The
ET Transfer component can be presented either as transformation rules or as a transduction of ETs, as
shown in Fig. 2. In Mandya and Siddharthan (2014), we describe how such automatically acquired rules
can be generalised to apply in new contexts; for instance, by expanding lexical context to include related
words derived from WordNet, or by removing the lexical context for lexical simplifications that are not
context dependent.

Learning paraphrase with typed dependency representations has certain advantages to PBMT; for ex-
ample, consider the rule that simplifies “described as” to “called”:

RULE: DESCRIBED_AS2CALLED

1. DELETE:
(a) prep_as(?X0[described], ?X1)

2. INSERT:
(a) dobj(?X2[called], ?X1)

This single rule can simplify “Coulter was described as a polemicist” to “Coulter was called a polemi-
cist” as well as cases where the words are not adjacent, such as “Coulter has described herself as a
polemicist” to “Coulter has called herself a polemicist”.

Our text simplification system, as evaluated in this paper, combines a set of 278 hand crafted grammar
for syntactic simplification (from the original RegenT system) and 5172 automatically acquired rules,
based on the principles described above.

4 Sentence Compression with Reluctant Trimmer

This section describes the mechanics of the reluctant trimmer (RT), or how it works to create a simplified
form of sentence. We will explain later where the word ‘reluctant’ comes from. Broadly, RT comes
in two parts: generation and selection. For a given sentence it takes as input, it generates a number of

Figure 4: Cropping dependency tree

truncations of the sentence, each of which has some elements removed in a way that largely complies
with English syntax. It does this by first parsing the sentence into a a dependency representation, and
creating what we call terminating dependency paths out of the representation. After placing them in a
lattice format, we run a K-best search over the lattice to generate K best truncations of the sentence. We
repeat the process for each sentence found in the text, which will produce a collection of sets of truncation
candidates. We then run integer linear programming over the collection, selecting one sentence for each
set in a way that satisfies global constraints such as lexical density, the ratio of hard words, and text
length. In particular, we regard RT not as an operation that works sentence by sentence, but one that
works with text as a whole. We argue that how the sentence is to be compressed is not only dictated by
the sentence itself, but also by the text in which it appears.

We start off with an example shown in Figure 3, where we have a phrase “2009 detention of American
hikers by Iran.” Our goal here is to develop a systematic method that will prune the dependency tree so
as to generate shorter versions of the sentence largely in compliance with the English grammar. Figure 4
provides an intuitive picture of how this could be done: by cropping the tree along the arrows. We
implement the idea by borrowing the notion of Terminating Dependency Path (TDP) (Nomoto, 2008),
which gives us a way to translate a dependency tree into a trellis of nodes, which in turn allows us to find
truncations through dynamic programming.

Figure 5 shows a TDP lattice derived from the dependency tree given in Figure 3. TDPs are depicted
as solid blue lines in the figure. It is easy to see that each TDP corresponds to a path in the dependency
tree that runs from a leaf to the root. The conversion from dependency tree to TDP lattice is thus
straightforward. We perform A? search over the TDP lattice to find the best compression. Assume
that we have a path or a sequence of nodes, 〈n[1], n[2] . . . , n[j], . . . , n[z − 1], n[z]〉, that takes you
from the starting node, n[1], to the goal, n[z], on the TDP lattice. Define the cost C of node n[x] by:
C(x) = g(x)+h(x) where g(x) is the cost incurred for the travel from the starting node to n[x] and h(x)
the future estimate for the cost of travelling from n[x] to the goal. Let g(x) = −∑j∈V (1,x) backward(j)
and h(x) = −∑j∈W (x,z−1) forward(j), with:

backward(x) = tfidf(n[x]) + pr(seq(n[x− 1], n[x])|M), (1)

forward(x) = backward(x+ 1) (2)

V (1, x) is a sequence of nodes that appeared on the path we took to reach n[x] from the starting node,
W (x, z − 1) a sequence of nodes that gives the shortest possible path (i.e. the path that incurs least
cost) from n[x] to the goal. tfidf(n) represents a tfidf score for a word associated with the node n, with
tfidf(n[1]) = 0 and tfidf(n[g]) = 0, and is normalised so that it falls between 1 and 0.2 seq(n,m)
refers to an uninterrupted sequence of words you find on the path that extends from n to m via the root,
ignoring duplicates. Figure 6 gives an intuitive sense of how this works. seq (2009, hiker), for instance,
can be found by following the blue line in the figure, which results in “2009 detention of hikers.” ‘M’
refers to a language model.3 pr(seq(n,m)|M) is the probability of sequence ‘seq(n,m)’ under language

2Document frequencies (df) we used for present purposes are based on those given in the British National Corpus (www.
kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html), which keeps record of the number of files a particular word occurred.

model M .4 Traversing over the TDP lattice while picking nodes with least costs will produce the best
compression, to which we apply Yen (1971)’s algorithm to find K-best alternatives (where K is set to 10
in the experiments reported below).

We now turn to the second part of the story, which is about choosing from each pool of K-best candi-
dates, to create a simplified version of the text. (Recall that we keep a pool of K-best compressions for
each of the sentences in a text, and create a simplification by choosing a compression from each pool.) In
this paper, we build on a particular simplification approach based on integer linear programming (ILP),
by (Dras, 1999), which he dubbed ‘reluctant paraphrasing.’ In a nutshell, Dras claims that we should
make as little change to the text as possible, arguing that any change may run the risk of muddling the
meaning of the original text: hence the name ‘reluctant paraphrasing.’ The following linear program
(LP) represents our adaptation of Dras’s method. Formula 3 represents the objective function, with 4
through 7 expressing constraints:

xi,j denotes a candidate for which we are to make a decision on whether to include it in the simplification
of a given text d. In particular we mean xi,j to represent the j-th best compression for the i-th sentence
in d. Constraint 4 dictates that we have exactly one compression candidate for each sentence in d. wij
indicates the number of changes or deletions we performed on the original sentence to create xij : -1 if
xij has one less term than the original sentence it is a compression of; 0 if there is no change. W is the
number of terms in d, S the number of sentences in d. Constraint 5 states that proportion of the number
of terms to that of sentences should be less than or equal to k1; in other words, changes made to the
text should not exceed k1. H in constraint 6 denotes the total number of ‘hard’ or difficult words in the
original text; hij the number of changes made to hard words in xij , namely how many less or more words
there remain that are deemed ‘hard,’ compared to the sentence it comes from.5: hij = −3, for example,
means that we have three less hard words in xij than in the original sentence.

Constraint 6 is included here to keep the proportion of hard words in text from growing beyond a

portion of TDT5 corpus and TDT Pilot Study Corpus (both available at Linguistic Data Consortium), the total number of
sentences combined reaching 293,971.

4We note here that we did not compensate the probability for the length of a word sequence, as we were unable to find an
empirical evidence that suggested we should do otherwise.

particular threshold k2. The values of k1, k2 and k3 were determined based on the Breaking News
English (BNE) corpus (described later), which provides for each story, simplified versions at two levels
of difficulty, one being called ’easy’ and the other ’hard.’ If we take the ’easy’ as a gold standard
simplification for the ’hard,’ we will be able to get estimates of k1 through k3. None of the data we used
for this purpose, however, is part of the BNE reading test discussed below.
F in constraint 7 represents the total number of function words (those that are not of JJ, MD, NN, RB,

or VB in the Penn scheme) while fij indicates that of changes to function words (the way it works is
analogous to hij). The motivation for the constraint is to prevent function words from being eliminated
excessively, which Dras argues, reduces the readability of text. The objective function includes param-
eters ci,j which serve to indicate the cost of transforming the sentence. In this paper, we define cij as
Levenshtein edit distance between compression and original sentence. In ordinary language, the linear
program may read like “Keep changes to a minimum. Accept compressions that look much like the
original sentences from which they arise, with less of hard words and content terms and more of function
words." Further, we made use of an array of hand-coded constraints in addition to a language model,
to ensure that a compression we generate remains as grammatical as possible. Included were those that
prohibit the generation of a compression that involves a dangling preposition or breaks apart multi-word
prepositions (MWPs) such as according to, compared to, in front of, etc. (the complete list of MWPs
we used for this purpose can be found in de Marneffe and Manning (2008)). Added to these were some
"don’t drop" rules that demanded we keep intact subjects and verbs as well.

Figure 7 illustrates how compression variables xi,j are organised (each of which is depicted as “x(i, j)”
in the figure). Each vertical line represents a pool of K-best compressions generated for a particular
sentence si. LP seeks to find a candidate from each pool so that the resulting set of compressions best
meets the objective function and conditions it dictates.6

5 Evaluation of Fluency, Simplicity and Meaning Preservation

We performed a manual evaluation of how fluent and simple the text produced by our simplification
system is, and the extent to which it preserves meaning. We evaluate 3 systems:

TS: The Text Simplification system based on synchronous dependency grammars (§3).

RT: The Reluctant Trimmer for sentence compression (§4).

HYB: A hybrid text simplification system that applies RT to the output of TS.

We used as a baseline Woodsend and Lapata (2011)’s QTSG system that learns a quasi-synchronous
tree substitution grammar from the same EW-SEW dataset used by TS. QTSG is the best performing
system in the literature with a similar scope to ours in terms of the syntactic, lexical and compression
operations performed 7. QTSG relies entirely on an automatically acquired grammar of 1431 rules, for
lexical and syntactic simplification as well as sentence compression. Our TS system has an automatically
extracted grammar with 5172 lexicalised rules to augment the existing 278 manually written syntactic
rules in RegenT. The RT system is not trained on simplified text. We also compare against the manual
simplification (SEW), and the original EW sentences.

Data: We use an evaluation set consisting of 100 sentences from English Wikipedia (EW) aligned
with Simple English Wikipedia (SEW) sentences, following recent work (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;
Wubben et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2010; Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014).
These 100 sentences have been excluded from our training data for rule acquisition, as is standard.
Following Wubben et al. (2012), we used all the sentences from the evaluation set for which each of the
four systems had performed at least one simplification (as selecting sentences where no simplification is
performed by one system is likely to boost its fluency and meaning preservation ratings). This gave us a
test set of 50 sentences from the original 100.

6As an LP solver, we used lp_solve 5.5.2.0, a mixed integer programming solver, available under public license at Source-
Forge (lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5).

7The PBMT system of Wubben et al. (2012) reports better results than QTSG, but is not directly comparable because it does
not perform syntactic simplifications such as sentence splitting.

Table 1: Results of human evaluation of different versions of simplified text

Method: We recruited participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, filtered to live in the US and have
an approval rating of 80%, and paid $3 for a HIT (Human Intelligence Task). Each HIT contained 10
sentences from Wikipedia (EW), each alongside 5 simplified versions: QTSG, TS, RT, HYB and SEW
in a randomised manner. For each of these 10 sets, participants were asked to rate each simplified version
for fluency, simplicity and the extent to which it preserved the meaning of the original EW sentence.
Participants were also asked to rate the fluency and simplicity of the original EW sentence. We used a
Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 is totally unusable output, and 5 is output that is perfectly usable.

Results: The results are shown in Table 1. As seen, our HYB system, and the individual components
TS and RT all outperform QTSG with all three metrics. In particular, TS is comparable to the SEW
version when one looks at the median scores. Interestingly, TS performs better than SEW with respect
to simplicity, suggesting that the system is indeed capable of a wide range of simplification operations.
The ANOVA tests carried out to measure significant differences between versions is presented below.
Table 3 (Row 1) shows the average number of words in the original and each simplified version.

Fluency: A one-way ANOVA was conducted with fluency as the dependent variable and text version
as the fixed effect. We report a significant effect of version (EW, SEW, QTSG, HYB, TS, RT) on the
fluency score (F=173.1, p<10-16). A Tukey’s pairwise comparison test (Tukey’s HSD, overall α = 0.05)
indicated significant differences between all pairs, except SEW-EW at p < 0.05.

Simplicity: A one-way ANOVA was conducted with simplicity as the dependent variable and text
version as the fixed effect. We report a significant effect of version on the simplicity score (F=29.9,
p<10-16). A Tukey’s pairwise comparison test (Tukey’s HSD, overall α = 0.05) indicated significant
differences between all pairs except: EW-SEW, RT-EW, and SEW-TS at p < 0.05.

Meaning: A one-way ANOVA was conducted with meaning preservation as the dependent variable
and text version as the fixed effect. We report a significant effect of version on the meaning preservation
score (F=130.12, p=2x10-16). A Tukey’s pairwise comparison test (Tukey’s HSD, overall α = 0.05)
indicated significant differences between all pairs except: RT-TS, RT-HYB and HYB-TS at p < 0.05.

Error Analysis: We manually examined sentences that had average ratings below 2. The main cause
of error for TS was misparsing, particularly errorful relative clause attachment and the parsing of comma
separated lists as apposition. TS fails badly in such cases, and it is possible that methods such as those
described in Siddharthan (2003b) are still relevant for correcting parser output. RT suffers mainly when it
removes punctuation, which make reading difficult, or names that contain meaning (e.g., “Seven volumes
in length , it was composed by Buddhist priest Jien of the Tendai sect c. 1220.” got compressed to
“Seven volumes in length it was composed by Jien of the sect c. 1220.”). The hybrid system can create
inconsistencies when TS has split a sentence and RT removes names from only one part (“Moles can
be found in most parts of North America, Asia, and Europe, although there are no moles in Ireland.” got
simplified to “Moles can be found in parts of America, and Asia and Europe. But, there are no moles.”).

6 Evaluation of Reading Comprehension

We also investigate, for the first time, the effect of contemporary text simplification systems on reading
comprehension for non-native speakers with a range of English skills.

Method: The test was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk with participants chosen from India and
paid $0.75 each. There is no method to selectively recruit low reading skill participants on Turk, so these
setting were selected to recruit non-native speakers (India) and minimise participants with postgraduate

2002



degrees (low pay). The test comprised of two components - (a) pre-test for English vocabulary skills;
and (b) a reading comprehension test to measure the effect of text simplification.

Pre-test: Reading skills are multifaceted and typically assessed through test batteries that test a range
of skills. As such there is no comprehensive assessment possible using a single short online test. As we
are recruiting non-native speakers, we chose to use the vocabulary size test (Nation and Beglar, 2007),
designed to estimate both first language and second language learners’ written receptive vocabulary size
in English. The test ranks words based on their corpus frequency, and creates 14 levels, each with
1000 words, so that level 10 for example would contain the 9001th to 10000th most frequent words in
English. We designed our vocabulary test by using 28 items, 2 at each level8. Each word is tested by
showing a short sentence containing it and asking the participant to select the meaning of the word from
four options. An estimate of vocabulary size can be got by multiplying the score on this test by 500,
so the maximum vocabulary size estimate is 28*500=14,000. Nation and Beglar (2007) spell out three
important milestones in terms of word family vocabulary size:

5000: Minimum for Non-native speakers of non-European backgrounds to cope at English speaking Universities

8000: Critical goal for language learners to deal with a range of unsimplified language (98% coverage for newspapers)

9000: Level of non-native English speaking PhD students (98% coverage for English novels)

In addition, we asked participants to self-report their English language skills by selecting from follow-
ing options: (a) native; (b) fluent (non-native); (c) good (non-native); and (d) basic (non-native).

Main test: The reading comprehension tests were conducted using 5 news summaries chosen from the
Breaking News English9 (BNE) website, with the permission of its creator and maintainer. The BNE
website is a resource that provides high quality news summaries at various levels of simplification for
second language learners, and has recently been nominated by the British Council for the 2014 ELTons
award for Innovation in Learner Resources. We selected five news stories which had manually con-
structed summaries at reading levels 6 (hard) and 4 (easy). The website provides a range of exercises
following each summary at level 6. We chose to use the multiple choice test to assess reading compre-
hension. For each of these summaries, we created automatically simplified texts by running our systems
on the level 6 text. This resulted in a total of five versions for each news summary - L6 (original); L4
(manual simplification); TS (automatic simplification of L6); RT (compression of L6); and HYB (RT
applied to output of TS applied to L6).

We used a balanced design where each participant would (after taking the vocabulary pre-test described
above) see each of the 5 news stories in exactly one of the 5 versions in a Latin square design. For each
comprehension test, the news summary was shown for a maximum of 150 seconds, after which it was
removed and 5 multiple choice comprehension questions presented, which was available for another 150
seconds (2.5 minutes). Participants could finish before the 150 seconds by clicking a “finished” button.
Table 3 shows the average length of text in each version.

Results: The first row in Table 2 shows the accuracy (proportion of comprehension questions answered
correctly) on the main comprehension test for participants divided into four categories based on their
estimated vocabulary from the pre-test. We do not find any significant differences, but it appears that the
main benefits of automatic text simplification are for moderate readers (vocabulary between 5K and 8K).

We found a very poor correlation between participants’ self reported English language skills and their
performance on the vocabulary test (ρ = −0.01; p = 0.55). The poor correlation was due to certain
participants over-estimating their skills. Out of 50 participants, 3 rated themselves as native. However,
they could get only about 28% of the answers correct, showing the fact that the participants had over-
estimated themselves.

This caused us to doubt the reliability of our version of the vocabulary test10. We therefore also
attempted to categorise participants based on their overall accuracy over all 25 questions in the com-

8The original test uses 10 words from each level, but we required a shorter version.

practical reasons.

prehension test. While the thresholds of 5000, 8000 and 9000 for vocabulary size are derived from the
literature, we had to set these threshold for comprehension scores. To do this in an objective (though still
arbitrary) manner, we selected thresholds numerically similar to the vocabulary size thresholds: Excel-
lent (acc ≥ 0.9), Good(0.9 > acc ≥= 0.8), Moderate (0.8 > acc ≥ 0.5) and Poor (acc < 0.5).

The second row in Table 2 shows the accuracy of participants when categorised by average accu-
racy on the comprehension questions. Note that this categorisation is posthoc (though we have used
thresholds derived from the vocabulary test to be objective), and the results pertaining to this categori-
sation should be regarded as preliminary. This new categorisation based on observed reading ability,
rather than predicted language skills, throws up more definitive results. We fitted a Generalised Linear
Mixed Model (GLMM), with “correct” answer as the (binary) dependent variable, text “version” (L4,
L6, TS, RT, HYB) and “comprehension” (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor) as the fixed effects and
participant and question as the random effects. We found a strong main effect of comprehension (com-
prehension=moderate, z = −3.178, p = 0.001; comprehension=poor, z = −4.858, p < 0.0001) and
a weak effect of version (version=L4, z = −1.797, p = 0.073); i.e., these three conditions predict a
reduced accuracy on the test. We also found a weak interaction between comprehension and version
(comprehension=moderate:version=TS, z = 1.78, p = 0.075); i.e., that TS increases correct answers
for readers with moderate reading skills (p = 0.075).

Note that L4, RT and HYB all omit information through compression (Table 3 shows text lengths).
This explains the drop in comprehension for these versions, as some information needed to answer a
question might have been omitted from the summary. Note also that RT and the HYB systems are
competitive with the manual simplification L4 for moderate and good readers. Table 4 provides sample
texts to illustrate differences.

General Jan Eliasson said it was ’descending into complete chaos before our eyes’. The landlocked nation has been slowly

7 Conclusions

We have described and evaluated two different text simplification systems, one that performs lexical
and syntactic simplification, and another that performs sentence compression, optimised for the text
simplification task. Both systems and their combination outperform a leading contemporary system.
The evaluation of reading comprehension with non-native speakers provides preliminary results that
automatic text simplification can facilitate comprehension for moderate readers, but not for good ones.
A larger evaluation with moderate readers in necessary to confirm this. Finally we plan to make the TS
and RT systems available to the public under the Creative Commons license.11
