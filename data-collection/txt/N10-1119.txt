Abstract

We examine the viability of building large
polarity lexicons semi-automatically from the
web. We begin by describing a graph propa-
gation framework inspired by previous work
on constructing polarity lexicons from lexi-
cal graphs (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and
Liu, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichan-
dran, 2009). We then apply this technique
to build an English lexicon that is signifi-
cantly larger than those previously studied.
Crucially, this web-derived lexicon does not
require WordNet, part-of-speech taggers, or
other language-dependent resources typical of
sentiment analysis systems. As a result, the
lexicon is not limited to specific word classes
– e.g., adjectives that occur in WordNet –
and in fact contains slang, misspellings, multi-
word expressions, etc. We evaluate a lexicon
derived from English documents, both qual-
itatively and quantitatively, and show that it
provides superior performance to previously
studied lexicons, including one derived from
WordNet.

1 Introduction

Polarity lexicons are large lists of phrases that en-
code the polarity of each phrase within it – either
positive or negative – often with some score rep-
resenting the magnitude of the polarity (Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Turney,
2002). Though classifiers built with machine learn-
ing algorithms have become commonplace in the
sentiment analysis literature, e.g., Pang et al. (2002),
the core of many academic and commercial senti-
ment analysis systems remains the polarity lexicon,

which can be constructed manually (Das and Chen,
2007), through heuristics (Kim and Hovy, 2004;
Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009) or using machine learn-
ing (Turney, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
Often lexicons are combined with machine learning
for improved results (Wilson et al., 2005). The per-
vasiveness and sustained use of lexicons can be as-
cribed to a number of reasons, including their inter-
pretability in large-scale systems as well as the gran-
ularity of their analysis.

In this work we investigate the viability of polar-
ity lexicons that are derived solely from unlabeled
web documents. We propose a method based on
graph propagation algorithms inspired by previous
work on constructing polarity lexicons from lexical
graphs (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004;
Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al.,
2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). Whereas past
efforts have used linguistic resources – e.g., Word-
Net – to construct the lexical graph over which prop-
agation runs, our lexicons are constructed using a
graph built from co-occurrence statistics from the
entire web. Thus, the method we investigate can
be seen as a combination of methods for propagat-
ing sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for
building sentiment lexicons based on distributional
characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002).
The advantage of breaking the dependence on Word-
Net (or related resources like thesauri (Mohammad
et al., 2009)) is that it allows the lexicons to include
non-standard entries, most notably spelling mistakes
and variations, slang, and multiword expressions.

The primary goal of our study is to understand the
characteristics and practical usefulness of such a lex-
icon. Towards this end, we provide both a qualitative
and quantitative analysis for a web-derived English

lexicon relative to two previously published lexicons
– the lexicon used in Wilson et al. (2005) and the
lexicon used in Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2008). Our
experiments show that a web-derived lexicon is not
only significantly larger, but has improved accuracy
on a sentence polarity classification task, which is
an important problem in many sentiment analysis
applications, including sentiment aggregation and
summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Carenini et al.,
2006; Lerman et al., 2009). These results hold true
both when the lexicons are used in conjunction with
string matching to classify sentences, and when they
are included within a contextual classifier frame-
work (Wilson et al., 2005).

Extracting polarity lexicons from the web has
been investigated previously by Kaji and Kitsure-
gawa (2007), who study the problem exclusively for
Japanese. In that work a set of positive/negative sen-
tences are first extracted from the web using cues
from a syntactic parser as well as the document
structure. Adjectives phrases are then extracted from
these sentences based on different statistics of their
occurrence in the positive or negative set. Our work,
on the other hand, does not rely on syntactic parsers
or restrict the set of candidate lexicon entries to spe-
cific syntactic classes, i.e., adjective phrases. As a
result, the lexicon built in our study is on a different
scale than that examined in Kaji and Kitsuregawa
(2007). Though this hypothesis is not tested here, it
also makes our techniques more amenable to adap-
tation for other languages.

2 Constructing the Lexicon

In this section we describe a method to construct po-
larity lexicons using graph propagation over a phrase
similarity graph constructed from the web.

2.1 Graph Propagation Algorithm

We construct our lexicon using graph propagation
techniques, which have previously been investigated
in the construction of polarity lexicons (Kim and
Hovy, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Esuli and Sabas-
tiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and
Ravichandran, 2009). We assume as input an undi-
rected edge weighted graph G = (V,E), where
wij ∈ [0, 1] is the weight of edge (vi, vj) ∈ E. The
node set V is the set of candidate phrases for inclu-

sion in a sentiment lexicon. In practice,G should en-
code semantic similarities between two nodes, e.g.,
for sentiment analysis one would hope that wij >
wik if vi=good, vj=great and vk=bad. We also as-
sume as input two sets of seed phrases, denoted P
for the positive seed set and N for the negative seed
set. The common property among all graph propaga-
tion algorithms is that they attempt to propagate in-
formation from the seed sets to the rest of the graph
through its edges. This can be done using machine
learning, graph algorithms or more heuristic means.

The specific algorithm used in this study is given
in Figure 1, which is distinct from common graph
propagation algorithms, e.g., label propagation (see
Section 2.3). The output is a polarity vector pol ∈
R|V | such that poli is the polarity score for the ith
candidate phrase (or the ith node inG). In particular,
we desire pol to have the following semantics:

poli =


> 0 ith phrase has positive polarity
< 0 ith phrase has negative polarity
= 0 ith phrase has no sentiment

Intuitively, the algorithm works by computing both
a positive and a negative polarity magnitude for
each node in the graph, call them pol+i and pol

-
i.

These values are equal to the sum over the max
weighted path from every seed word (either posi-
tive or negative) to node vi. Phrases that are con-
nected to multiple positive seed words through short
yet highly weighted paths will receive high positive
values. The final polarity of a phrase is then set to
poli = pol

+
i − βpol-i, where β a constant meant to

account for the difference in overall mass of positive
and negative flow in the graph. Thus, after the al-
gorithm is run, if a phrase has a higher positive than
negative polarity score, then its final polarity will be
positive, and negative otherwise.

There are some implementation details worth
pointing out. First, the algorithm in Figure 1 is writ-
ten in an iterative framework, where on each itera-
tion, paths of increasing lengths are considered. The
input variable T controls the max path length con-
sidered by the algorithm. This can be set to be a
small value in practice, since the multiplicative path
weights result in long paths rarely contributing to
polarity scores. Second, the parameter γ is a thresh-
old that defines the minimum polarity magnitude a

phrase must have to be included in the lexicon. Both
T and γ were tuned on held-out data.

To construct the final lexicon, the remaining
nodes – those with polarity scores above γ – are ex-
tracted and assigned their corresponding polarity.

2.2 Building a Phrase Graph from the Web

Graph propagation algorithms rely on the existence
of graphs that encode meaningful relationships be-
tween candidate nodes. Past studies on building po-
larity lexicons have used linguistic resources like
WordNet to define the graph through synonym and
antonym relations (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and
Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008;
Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). The goal of this study
is to examine the size and quality of polarity lexi-
cons when the graph is induced automatically from
documents on the web.

Constructing a graph from web-computed lexi-
cal co-occurrence statistics is a difficult challenge
in and of itself and the research and implementa-
tion hurdles that arise are beyond the scope of this
work (Alfonseca et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 2009).
For this study, we used an English graph where the
node set V was based on all n-grams up to length
10 extracted from 4 billion web pages. This list was

filtered to 20 million candidate phrases using a num-
ber of heuristics including frequency and mutual in-
formation of word boundaries. A context vector for
each candidate phrase was then constructed based
on a window of size six aggregated over all men-
tions of the phrase in the 4 billion documents. The
edge set E was constructed by first, for each po-
tential edge (vi, vj), computing the cosine similar-
ity value between context vectors. All edges (vi, vj)
were then discarded if they were not one of the 25
highest weighted edges adjacent to either node vi or
vj . This serves to both reduce the size of the graph
and to eliminate many spurious edges for frequently
occurring phrases, while still keeping the graph rela-
tively connected. The weight of the remaining edges
was set to the corresponding cosine similarity value.

Since this graph encodes co-occurrences over a
large, but local context window, it can be noisy for
our purposes. In particular, we might see a number
of edges between positive and negative sentiment
words as well as sentiment words and non-sentiment
words, e.g., sentiment adjectives and all other adjec-
tives that are distributionally similar. Larger win-
dows theoretically alleviate this problem as they en-
code semantic as opposed to syntactic similarities.
We note, however, that the graph propagation al-
gorithm described above calculates the sentiment of
each phrase as the aggregate of all the best paths to
seed words. Thus, even if some local edges are erro-
neous in the graph, one hopes that, globally, positive
phrases will be influenced more by paths from pos-
itive seed words as opposed to negative seed words.
Section 3, and indeed this paper, aims to measure
whether this is true or not.

2.3 Why Not Label Propagation?

Previous studies on constructing polarity lexicons
from lexical graphs, e.g., Rao and Ravichandran
(2009), have used the label propagation algorithm,
which takes the form in Figure 2 (Zhu and Ghahra-
mani, 2002). Label propagation is an iterative algo-
rithm where each node takes on the weighted aver-
age of its neighbour’s values from the previous iter-
ation. The result is that nodes with many paths to
seeds get high polarities due to the influence from
their neighbours. The label propagation algorithm
is known to have many desirable properties includ-
ing convergence, a well defined objective function

(minimize squared error between values of adjacent
nodes), and an equivalence to computing random
walks through graphs.

The primary difference between standard label
propagation and the graph propagation algorithm
given in Section 2.1, is that a node with multiple
paths to a seed will be influenced by all these paths
in the label propagation algorithm, whereas only the
single path from a seed will influence the polarity
of a node in our proposed propagation algorithm –
namely the path with highest weight. The intuition
behind label propagation seems justified. That is, if
a node has multiple paths to a seed, it should be re-
flected in a higher score. This is certainly true when
the graph is of high quality and all paths trustwor-
thy. However, in a graph constructed from web co-
occurrence statistics, this is rarely the case.

Our graph consisted of many dense subgraphs,
each representing some semantic entity class, such
as actors, authors, tech companies, etc. Problems
arose when polarity flowed into these dense sub-
graphs with the label propagation algorithm. Ulti-
mately, this flow would amplify since the dense sub-
graph provided exponentially many paths from each
node to the source of the flow, which caused a re-
inforcement effect. As a result, the lexicon would
consist of large groups of actor names, companies,
etc. This also led to convergence issues since the
polarity is divided proportional to the size of the
dense subgraph. Additionally, negative phrases in
the graph appeared to be in more densely connected
regions, which resulted in the final lexicons being
highly skewed towards negative entries due to the
influence of multiple paths to seed words.

For best path propagation, these problems were
less acute as each node in the dense subgraph would
only get the polarity a single time from each seed,
which is decayed by the fact that edge weights are
smaller than 1. Furthermore, the fact that edge
weights are less than 1 results in most long paths
having weights near zero, which in turn results in
fast convergence.

3 Lexicon Evaluation

We ran the best path graph propagation algorithm
over a graph constructed from the web using manu-
ally constructed positive and negative seed sets of
187 and 192 words in size, respectively. These
words were generated by a set of five humans and
many are morphological variants of the same root,
e.g., excel/excels/excelled. The algorithm produced
a lexicon that contained 178,104 entries. Depending
on the threshold γ (see Figure 1), this lexicon could
be larger or smaller. As stated earlier, our selection
of γ and all hyperparameters was based on manual
inspection of the resulting lexicons and performance
on held-out data.

In the rest of this section we investigate the prop-
erties of this lexicon to understand both its general
characteristics as well as its possible utility in sen-
timent applications. To this end we compare three
different lexicons:

1. Wilson et al.: Described in Wilson et al.
(2005). Lexicon constructed by combining the
lexicon built in Riloff and Wiebe (2003) with
other sources1. Entries are are coarsely rated
– strong/weak positive/negative – which we
weighted as 1.0, 0.5, -0.5, and -1.0 for our ex-
periments.

2. WordNet LP: Described in Blair-Goldensohn
et al. (2008). Constructed using label propaga-
tion over a graph derived from WordNet syn-
onym and antonym links. Note that label prop-
agation is not prone to the kinds of errors dis-
cussed in Section 2.3 since the lexical graph is
derived from a high quality source.

3. Web GP: The web-derived lexicon described
in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2.

3.1 Qualitative Evaluation

Table 1 breaks down the lexicon by the number of
positive and negative entries of each lexicon, which
clearly shows that the lexicon derived from the web
is more than an order of magnitude larger than pre-
viously constructed lexicons.2 This in and of it-
self is not much of an achievement if the additional
phrases are of poor quality. However, in Section 3.2
we present an empirical evaluation that suggests that
these terms provide both additional and useful in-
formation. Table 1 also shows the recall of the each
lexicon relative to the other. Whereas the Wilson
et al. (2005) and WordNet lexicon have a recall of
only 3% relative to the web lexicon, the web lexi-
con has a recall of 48% and 70% relative to the two
other lexicons, indicating that it contains a signifi-
cant amount of information from the other lexicons.
However, this overlap is still small, suggesting that
a combination of all the lexicons could provide the
best performance. In Section 3.2 we investigate this
empirically through a meta classification system.

Table 2 shows the distribution of phrases in the
web-derived lexicon relative to the number of to-
kens in each phrase. Here a token is simply defined
by whitespace and punctuation, with punctuation
counting as a token, e.g., “half-baked” is counted as
3 tokens. For the most part, we see what one might
expect, as the number of tokens increases, the num-
ber of corresponding phrases in the lexicon also de-
creases. Longer phrases are less frequent and thus
will have both fewer and lower weighted edges to
adjacent nodes in the graph. There is a single phrase
of length 9, which is “motion to dismiss for failure
to state a claim”. In fact, the lexicon contains quite
a number of legal and medical phrases. This should
not be surprising, since in a graph induced from the
web, a phrase like “cancer” (or any disease) should
be distributionally similar to phrases like “illness”,
“sick”, and “death”, which themselves will be simi-
lar to standard sentiment phrases like “bad” and “ter-
rible”. These terms are predominantly negative in
the lexicon representing the broad notion that legal
and medical events are undesirable.

2This also includes the web-derived lexicon of (Kaji and Kit-
suregawa, 2007), which has 10K entries. A recent study by
Mohammad et al. (2009) generated lexicons from thesauri with
76K entries.

Phrase length 1 2 3
# of phrases 37,449 108,631 27,822

Phrase length 4 5 6 7 8 9
# of phrases 3,489 598 71 29 4 1

Table 2: Number of phrases by phrase length in lexicon
built from the web.

Perhaps the most interesting characteristic of the
lexicon is that the most frequent phrase length is 2
and not 1. The primary reason for this is an abun-
dance of adjective phrases consisting of an adverb
and an adjective, such as “more brittle” and “less
brittle”. Almost every adjective of length 1 is fre-
quently combined in such a way on the web, so it
not surprising that we see many of these phrases
in the lexicon. Ideally we would see an order on
such phrases, e.g., “more brittle” has a larger neg-
ative polarity than “brittle”, which in turn has a
larger negative polarity than “less brittle”. However,
this is rarely the case and usually the adjective has
the highest polarity magnitude. Again, this is eas-
ily explained. These phrases are necessarily more
common and will thus have more edges with larger
weights in the graph and thus a greater chance of ac-
cumulating a high sentiment score. The prominence
of such phrases suggests that a more principled treat-
ment of them should be investigated in the future.

Finally, Table 3 presents a selection of phrases
from both the positive and negative lexicons cate-
gorized into revealing verticals. For both positive
and negative phrases we present typical examples of
phrases – usually adjectives – that one would expect
to be in a sentiment lexicon. These are phrases not
included in the seed sets. We also present multiword
phrases for both positive and negative cases, which
displays concretely the advantage of building lexi-
cons from the web as opposed to using restricted lin-
guistic resources such as WordNet. Finally, we show
two special cases. The first is spelling variations
(and mistakes) for positive phrases, which were far
more prominent than for negative phrases. Many of
these correspond to social media text where one ex-
presses an increased level of sentiment by repeat-
ing characters. The second is vulgarity in negative
phrases, which was far more prominent than for pos-
itive phrases. Some of these are clearly appropri-

ate, e.g., “shitty”, but some are clearly insults and
outbursts that are most likely included due to their
co-occurrence with angry texts. There were also a
number of derogatory terms and racial slurs in the
lexicon, again most of which received negative sen-
timent due to their typical disparaging usage.

3.2 Quantitative Evaluation

To determine the practical usefulness of a polarity
lexicon derived from the web, we measured the per-
formance of the lexicon on a sentence classifica-
tion/ranking task. The input is a set of sentences and
the output is a classification of the sentences as be-
ing either positive, negative or neutral in sentiment.
Additionally, the system outputs two rankings, the
first a ranking of the sentence by positive polarity
and the second a ranking of the sentence by negative
polarity. Classifying sentences by their sentiment is
a subtask of sentiment aggregation systems (Hu and
Liu, 2004; Gamon et al., 2005). Ranking sentences
by their polarity is a critical sub-task in extractive
sentiment summarization (Carenini et al., 2006; Ler-
man et al., 2009).

To classify sentences as being positive, negative
or neutral, we used an augmented vote-flip algo-
rithm (Choi and Cardie, 2009), which is given in
Figure 3. This intuition behind this algorithm is sim-

ple. The number of matched positive and negative
phrases from the lexicon are counted and whichever
has the most votes wins. The algorithm flips the de-
cision if the number of negations is odd. Though this
algorithm appears crude, it benefits from not relying
on threshold values for neutral classification, which
is difficult due to the fact that the polarity scores in
the three lexicons are not on the same scale.

To rank sentences we defined the purity of a sen-
tence X as the normalized sum of the sentiment
scores for each phrase x in the sentence:

purity(X) =
∑

x∈X polx
δ +

∑
x∈X |polx|

This is a normalized score in the range [−1, 1]. In-
tuitively, sentences with many terms of the same po-
larity will have purity scores at the extreme points of
the range. Before calculating purity, a simple nega-
tion heuristic was implemented that reversed the
sentiment scores of terms that were within the scope
of negations. The term δ helps to favor sentences
with multiple phrase matches. Purity is a common
metric used for ranking sentences for inclusion in
sentiment summaries (Lerman et al., 2009). Purity
and negative purity were used to rank sentences as
being positive and negative sentiment, respectively.

ments were a set of 554 consumer reviews described
in (McDonald et al., 2007). Each review was sen-
tence split and annotated by a human as being pos-
itive, negative or neutral in sentiment. This resulted
in 3,916 sentences, with 1,525, 1,542 and 849 posi-
tive, negative and neutral sentences, respectively.

The first six columns of Table 4 shows: 1) the pos-
itive/negative precision-recall of each lexicon-based
system where sentence classes were determined us-
ing the vote-flip algorithm, and 2) the average preci-
sion for each lexicon-based system where purity (or
negative purity) was used to rank sentences. Both
the Wilson et al. and WordNet LP lexicons perform
at a similar level, with the former slightly better, es-
pecially in terms of precision. The web-derived lex-
icon, Web GP, outperforms the other two lexicons
across the board, in particular when looking at av-
erage precision, where the gains are near 10% ab-
solute. If we plot the precision-recall graphs using
purity to classify sentences – as opposed to the vote-

flip algorithm, which only provides an unweighted
classification – we can see that at almost all recall
levels the web-derived lexicon has superior preci-
sion to the other lexicons (Figure 4). Thus, even
though the web-derived lexicon is constructed from
a lexical graph that contains noise, the graph prop-
agation algorithms appear to be fairly robust to this
noise and are capable of producing large and accu-
rate polarity lexicons.

The second six columns of Table 4 shows the per-
formance of each lexicon as the core of a contextual
classifier (Wilson et al., 2005). A contextual classi-
fier is a machine learned classifier that predicts the
polarity of a sentence using features of that sentence
and its context. For our experiments, this was a max-
imum entropy classifier trained and evaluated us-
ing 10-fold cross-validation on the evaluation data.
The features included in the classifier were the pu-
rity score, the number of positive and negative lex-
icon matches, and the number of negations in the
sentence, as well as concatenations of these features
within the sentence and with the same features de-
rived from the sentences in a window of size 1.

For each sentence, the contextual classifier pre-
dicted either a positive, negative or neutral classifi-
cation based on the label with highest probability.
Additionally, all sentences were placed in the posi-
tive and negative sentence rankings by the probabil-
ity the classifier assigned to the positive and negative
classes, respectively. Mirroring the results of Wil-
son et al. (2005), we see that contextual classifiers
improve results substantially over lexical matching.
More interestingly, we see that the a contextual clas-
sifier over the web-derived lexicons maintains the
performance edge over the other lexicons, though
the gap is smaller. Figure 5 plots the precision-recall
curves for the positive and negative sentence rank-

ings, again showing that at almost every level of re-
call, the web-derived lexicon has higher precision.

For a final English experiment we built a meta-
classification system that is identical to the contex-
tual classifiers, except it is trained using features de-
rived from all lexicons. Results are shown in the
last row of Table 4 and precision-recall curves are
shown in Figure 5. Not surprisingly, this system has
the best performance in terms of average precision
as it has access to the largest amount of information,
though its performance is only slightly better than
the contextual classifier for the web-derived lexicon.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we examined the viability of senti-
ment lexicons learned semi-automatically from the
web, as opposed to those that rely on manual anno-
tation and/or resources such as WordNet. Our quali-
tative experiments indicate that the web derived lex-
icon can include a wide range of phrases that have

not been available to previous systems, most no-
tably spelling variations, slang, vulgarity, and multi-
word expressions. Quantitatively, we observed that
the web derived lexicon had superior performance
to previously published lexicons for English clas-
sification. Ultimately, a meta classifier that incor-
porates features from all lexicons provides the best
performance. In the future we plan to investigate the
construction of web-derived lexicons for languages
other than English, which is an active area of re-
search (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Jijkoun and Hofmann,
2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). The advantage
of the web-derived lexicons studied here is that they
do not rely on language specific resources besides
unlabeled data and seed lists. A primary question is
whether such lexicons improve performance over a
translate-to-English strategy (Banea et al., 2008).
