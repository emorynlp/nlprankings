Abstract 

In this paper we propose a method that 
uses corpora where phrases are annotated 
as Positive, Negative, Objective and 
Neutral, to achieve new sentiment 
resources involving words dictionaries 
with their associated polarity. Our 
method was created to build sentiment 
words inventories based on senti-
semantic evidences obtained after 
exploring text with annotated sentiment 
polarity information. Through this 
process a graph-based algorithm is used 
to obtain auto-balanced values that 
characterize sentiment polarities well 
used on Sentiment Analysis tasks. To 
assessment effectiveness of the obtained 
resource, sentiment classification was 
made, achieving objective instances over 
80%. 

1 Introduction 
In recent years, textual information has become 
one of the most important sources of knowledge 
to extract useful data. Texts can provide factual 
information, such as: descriptions, lists of 
characteristics, or even instructions to opinion-
based information, which would include reviews, 
emotions or feelings. These facts have motivated 
dealing with the identification and extraction of 
opinions and sentiments in texts that require 
special attention. Among most widely used terms 
in Natural Language Processing, in concrete in 
Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Opinion Mining, is 
the subjectivity term proposed by (Wiebe, 1994). 
This author defines it as “linguistic expression of 
somebody’s opinions, sentiments, emotions, 
evaluations, beliefs and speculations”. Another 
important aspect opposed to subjectivity is the 
objectivity, which constitute a fact expression 
(Balahur, 2011). Other interesting terms also 
proposed by (Wiebe et al., 2005) considers, 
private state, theses terms involve opinions, 

beliefs, thoughts, feelings, emotions, goals, 
evaluations and judgments.  

Many researchers such as (Balahur et al., 2010; 
Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000; Kim and Hovy, 
2006; Wiebe et al., 2005) and many others have 
been working in this way and related areas. To 
build systems able to lead SA challenges it is 
necessary to achieve sentiment resources 
previously developed. These resources could be 
annotated corpora, affective semantic structures, 
and sentiment dictionaries.  

In this paper we propose a method that uses 
annotated corpora where phrases are annotated as 
Positive, Negative, Objective and Neutral, to 
achieve new resources for subjectivity analysis 
involving words dictionaries with their 
associated polarity.  

The next section shows different sentiment and 
affective resources and their main characteristics. 
After that, our proposal is developed in section 3. 
Section 4, present a new sentiment resource 
obtained after evaluating RA-SR over many 
corpora. Section 5 described the evaluation and 
analysis of the obtained resource, and also an 
assessment of the obtained resource in Sentiment 
Classification task. Finally, conclusion and 
further works are presented in section 6. 

2 Related work 
It is known that the use of sentiment resources 
has proven to be a necessary step for training and 
evaluation for systems implementing sentiment 
analysis, including also fine-grained opinion 
mining (Balahur, 2011). 

Different techniques have been used into 
product reviews to obtain lexicons of subjective 
words with their associated polarity. We can 
study the relevant research promoted by (Hu and 
Liu, 2004) which start with a set of seed 
adjectives (“good” and “bad”) and reinforce the 
semantic knowledge applying a expanding the 
lexicon with synonymy and antonymy relations 
provided by WordNet (Miller et al., 1990). As 
result of Hu and Liu researches an Opinion 
Lexicon is obtained with around 6800 positive 

94



 

and negative English words (Hu and Liu, 2004; 
Liu et al., 2005). 

A similar approach has been used in building 
WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 
2004). In this case the building method starting 
from a larger of seed affective words set. These 
words are classified according to the six basic 
categories of emotion (joy, sadness, fear, 
surprise, anger and disgust), are also expanded 
increase the lexicon using paths in WordNet. 

Other widely used in SA has been 
SentiWordNet resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 
2006)). The main idea that encouraged its 
construction has been that “terms with similar 
glosses in WordNet tend to have similar 
polarity”. 

Another popular lexicon is MicroWNOp 
(Cerini et al., 2007). It contains opinion words 
with their associated polarity. It has been built on 
the basis of a set of terms extracted from the 
General Inquirer1 (Stone et al., 1996).  

The problem is that these resources do not 
consider the context in which the words appear. 
Some methods tried to overcome this critique 
and built sentiment lexicons using the local 
context of words. 

We can mentioned to (Pang et al., 2002) whom 
built a lexicon with associated polarity value, 
starting with a set of classified seed adjectives 
and using conjunctions (“and”) disjunctions 
(“or”, “but”) to deduce orientation of new words 
in a corpus. 

(Turney, 2002) classifies words according to 
their polarity based on the idea that terms with 
similar orientation tend to co-occur in 
documents.  

On the contrary in (Balahur and Montoyo, 
2008b), is computed the polarity of new words 
using “polarity anchors” (words whose polarity 
is known beforehand) and Normalized Google 
Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitányi, 2007) scores 
using as training examples opinion words 
extracted from “pros and cons reviews” from the 
same domain. This research achieved the lexical 
resource Emotion Triggers (Balahur and 
Montoyo, 2008a). 

Another approach that uses the polarity of the 
local context for computing word polarity is the 
one presented by (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), 
who use a weighting function of the words 
around the context to be classified. 

All described resources have been obtained 
manually or semi-automatically. Therefore, we

focus our target in archiving automatically new 
sentiment resources supported over some of 
aforementioned resources. In particular, we will 
offer contributions related with methods to build 
sentiment lexicons using the local context of 
words. 

3 Our method 
We propose a method named RA-SR (using 
Ranking Algorithms to build Sentiment 
Resources) to build sentiment words inventories 
based on senti-semantic evidences obtained after 
exploring text with annotated sentiment polarity 
information. Through this process a graph-based 
algorithm is used to obtain auto-balanced values 
that characterize sentiment polarities widely used 
on Sentiment Analysis tasks. This method 
consists of three main stages: (I) Building 
contextual words graphs; (II) Applying ranking 
algorithm; and (III) Adjusting sentiment polarity 
values. 

 
Figure 1. Resource walkthrough development process. 

These stages are represented in the diagram of 
Figure 1, where the development process begins 
introducing two corpuses of annotated sentences 
with positive and negative sentences 
respectively. Initially, a preprocessing of the text 
is made applying Freeling pos-tagger (Atserias et 
al., 2006) version 2.2 to convert all words to 
lemmas2. After that, all lemmas lists obtained are 
introduced in RA-SR, divided in two groups (i.e. 
positive and negative candidates, ����  and 
����).  
3.1 Building contextual words graphs 
Giving two sets of sentences (���� and ����) 
annotated as positive and negative respectively, 
where ����	 = [����, … , ����]  and ����	 =
[�����, … , �����]	  contains list �  involving 
words lemmatized by Freeling 2.2 Pos-Tagger 

                                                 
2 Lemma denotes canonic form of the words.

(Atserias et al., 2006), a process to build two 
lexical contextual graphs, ����  and ����  is 
applied. Those sentences are manually annotated 
as positive and negative respectively. These 
graphs involve lemmas from the positive and 
negative sentences respectively. 

A contextual graph �  is defined as an 
undirected graph � =	 (�, �) , where �  denotes 
the set of vertices and � the set of edges. Given 
the list �	 = [�1 	… ��]  a lemma graph is created 
establishing links among all lemmas of each 
sentence, where words involved allow to 
interconnect sentences ��  in � . As a result 
word/lemma networks ����  and ����  are 
obtained, where �	 = 	�	 = [�� 	… � ]	  and for 
every edge (�� , �!)∈	� being ��, �!∈	�. Therefore, 
�� and "�	 are the same. 

Then, having two graphs, we proceed to 
initialize weight to apply graph-based ranking 
techniques in order to auto-balance the particular 
importance of each "� into ���� and ����. 
3.2 Applying ranking algorithm 
To apply a graph-based ranking process, it is 
necessary to assign weights to the vertices of the 
graph. Words involved into ���� and ���� take 
the default value 1/N as their weight to define 
the weight of "  vector, which is used in our 
proposed ranking algorithm. In the case where 
words are identified on the sentiment repositories 
(see Table 2) as positive or negative, in relation 
to their respective graph, a weight value of 1 (in 
a range [0…1] ) is assigned. �  represents the 
maximum quantity of words in the current graph. 
Thereafter, a graph-based ranking algorithm is 
applied in order to structurally raise the graph 
vertexes’ voting power. Once the reinforcement 
values are applied, the proposed ranking 
algorithm is able to increase the significance of 
the words related to these empowered vertices. 

The PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) 
adaptation, which was popularized by (Agirre 
and Soroa, 2009) in Word Sense Disambiguation 
thematic, and the one that has obtained relevant 
results, was an inspiration to us in this work. The 
main idea behind this algorithm is that, for each 
edge between "i and "j in graph �, a vote is made 
from "i to "j. As a result, the relevance of "j is 
increased. 

On top of that, the vote strength from &  to ' 
depends on "�′�  relevance. The philosophy 
behind it is that, the more important the vertex is, 
the more strength the voter would have. Thus, 
PageRank is generated by applying a random 
walkthrough from the internal interconnection of 

�, where the final relevance of "�  represents the 
random walkthrough probability over � , and 
ending on "�. 

In our system, we apply the following equation 
and configuration:  

 )*	 = 	+,)*	 +	(1 − +)" (1) 
Where: ,	 is a probabilistic transition matrix 
�	×	� , being ,!,�  = �/0	  if a link from " i to " j 
exist, in other case zero is assigned; " is a vector 
�	×	1	with values previously described in this 
section; )* is the probabilistic structural vector 
obtained after a random walkthrough to arrive to 
any vertex; +	  is a dumping factor with value 
0.85, and like in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) we 
used 30 iterations. 

A detailed explanation about the PageRank 
algorithm can be found in (Agirre and Soroa, 
2009). 

After applying PageRank, in order to obtain 
standardized values for both graphs, we 
normalize the rank values by applying the 
following equation: 

 )*& = )*&/,12()*) (2) 
Where ,12()*)  obtains the maximum rank 

value of 34 vector. 
3.3 Adjusting sentiment polarity values 
After applying the PageRank algorithm on ���� 
and ���� , and having normalized their ranks, 
we proceed to obtain a final list of lemmas 
(named �5 ) while avoiding repeated elements. 
�5	is represented by �5�  lemmas, which would 
have, at that time, two assigned values: Positive, 
and Negative, which correspond to a calculated 
rank obtained by the PageRank algorithm.  

At that point, for each lemma from �5,  the 
following equations are applied in order to select 
the definitive subjectivity polarity for each one: 

6�� = 	 76�� − ���	; 	6�� > ���0																; �:ℎ�<=&�� > (3) 
��� = 	 7��� − 6��	; 	��� > 6��0																; �:ℎ�<=&�� > (4) 

Where 6�� is the Positive value and ��� the 
Negative value related to each lemma in �5. 

In order to standardize the 6�� and ��� values 
again and making them more representative in a 
[0…1] scale, we proceed to apply a 
normalization process over the 6��  and ��� 
values. 

Following and based on the objective features 
commented by (Baccianella et al., 2010), we 
assume their same premise to establish objective 
values of the lemmas. Equation (5) is used to this 

96



 

proceeding, where ?@'  represent the objective 
value. 

?@' = 1 − |6�� − ���| (5) 
4 Sentiment Resource obtained 
At the same time we have obtained a �5 where 
each word is represented by 6��, ��� and ?@' 
values, acquired automatically from annotated 
sentiment corpora. With our proposal we have 
been able to discover new sentiment words in 
concordance of contexts in which the words 
appear. Note that the new obtained resource 
involves all lemmas identified into the annotated 
corpora. 6��, ���, and ?@' are nominal values 
between range [0… 	1]. 
5 Evaluation 
In the construction of the sentiment resource we 
used the annotated sentences provided from 
corpora described on Table 1. Note that we only 
used the sentences annotated positively and 
negatively. The resources involved into this table 
were a selection made to prove the functionality 
of the words annotation proposal of subjectivity 
and objectivity. 

The sentiment lexicons used were provided 
from WordNetAffect_Categories 3 and opinion-
words4 files and shown in detail in Table 2.

contextual graph � factotum words are present in 
mostly of the involved sentences (i.e. verb “to 
be”). This aspect is very dangerous after 
applying PageRank algorithm, because this 
algorithm because this algorithm strengthens the 
nodes possessing many linked elements. For that 
reason, the subtractions 6�� − ���  and ��� −
6��  are applied, where the most frequently 
words in all contexts obtains high values and 
being the subtraction a damping factor.  

Following an example; when we take the verb 
“to be”, before applying equation (2), verb “to 
be” archives the highest values into each context 
graph (����  and ���� ), 9.94 and 18.67 rank 
values respectively. These values, applying 
equation (2), are normalized obtaining both 
6��	 = 	1  and ���	 = 	1  in a range [0...1]. 
Finally, when the next steps are executed 
(Equations (3) and (4)) verb “to be” 
achieves 6��	 = 0 , ��� = 0  and 
therefore 	?@'	 = 1 . Through this example it 
seems as we subjectively discarded words that 
appear frequently in both contexts (Positive and 
Negative contexts). 

Using the corpora from Table 1 we obtain 
25792 sentimentally annotated lemmas with 6��, 
��� and ?@'  features. Of them 12420 positive 
and 11999 negative lemmas were discovered, , 
and 1373 words already derived from existing 
lexical resources. 

Another contribution has been the 6�� , ��� 
and ?@'  scores assigned to words of lexical 
inventory, which were used to reinforce the 
contextual graphs in the building process. Those 
words in concordance to our scenario count 842 
Positives and 383 Negatives.  

5.1 Sentiment Resource Applied on 
Sentiment Analysis 

To know if our method offers resources that 
improve the SA state of the art, we propose a 
baseline supported on the sentiment dictionaries, 
and other method (Ranking Sentiment Resource 
(RSR)) supported over our obtained resource. 
The baseline consists on analyzing sentences 
applying Equation (6) and Equation (7). 

6��,�1�B<� = 6��C�B�:D�<EC�B�:	 (6) 

���,�1�B<� = ���C�B�:D�<EC�B�:	 (7) 
Where: 6��C�B�: is the total of positive words 

(aligned with the sentiment dictionaries) in the 
sentence; ���C�B�:  is the total of negative 
words (aligned with the sentiment dictionaries) 

97



 

in the sentence; D�<EC�B�:  is the total of 
words in the sentence.  

Using these measures over the analyzed 
sentences, for each sentence, we obtain two 
attributes, 6��,�1�B<� and	���,�1�B<�; and 
a third attribute (named Classification) 
corresponding to its classification. 

On the other hand, we propose RSR. This SA 
method uses in a different way the Equation (6) 
and Equation (7), and introduces Equation (8).  

?@',�1�B<� = ?@'C�B�:D�<EC�B�:	 (8) 
Being 6��C�B�: the sum of Positive ranking 

values of the sentence words, aligned with the 
obtained resource (�5); ���C�B�:  the sum of 
Negative ranking values of the sentence words, 
aligned with the obtained resource (�5 ); and 
?@'C�B�: the sum of Objective ranking values 
of the sentence words, aligned with the obtained 
resource (�5). 

In RSR method we proved with two approach, 
RSR (1/di) and RSR (1-(1/di)). The first approach 
is based on a resource developed using 
PageRank with  ,!,� = 1/E�   and the other 
approach is using ,!,� = 1 − (1/E�) . Table 3 
shows experimentation results. 

The evaluation has been applied over a corpus 
provided by “Task 2. Sentiment Analysis in 
Twitter, subtask b”, in particular tweeti-b-
sub.dist_out.tsv file. This corpus contains 597 
annotated phrases, of them Positives (314), 
Negatives (155), Objectives (98) or Neutrals 
(30). For our understanding this quantity of 
instances offers a representative perception of 
RA-SR contribution; however we will think to 
evaluate RA-SR over other corpora in further 
researches.

As we can see the baseline only is able to 
dealing with negative and positive instances. Is 
important to remark that our proposal starting up 
knowing only the words used in baseline and is 
able to growing sentiment information to other 
words related to them. We can see this fact on 

                                                 
8  Semeval-2013 (Task 2. Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, 
subtask b.) 

Table 3, RSR is able to classify objective 
instances over 80% of Recall and the baseline 
does not.  

Other relevant element is the recall difference 
between RSR (1/di) and RSR (1 − (1/E�) . 
Traditionally (1/E�) result value has been 
assigned to , in PageRank algorithm. We have 
demonstrated that in lexical contexts RSR (1-
(1/di)) approach offers a better performance of 
PageRank algorithm, showing recall differences 
around 10 perceptual points. 

6 Conclusion and further works 
As a conclusion we can say that our proposal is 
able to automatically increase sentiment 
information, obtaining 25792 sentimentally 
annotated lemmas with 6�� , ���  and ?@' 
features. Of them 12420 positive and 11999 
negative lemmas were discovered. 

In other hand, The RSR is capable to classify 
objective instances over 80% and negatives over 
70%. We cannot tackle efficiently neutral 
instances, perhaps it is due to the lack of neutral 
information in the sentiment resource we used. 
Also, it could be due to the low quantity of 
neutral instances in the evaluated corpus. 

In further research we will evaluate RA-SR 
over different corpora, and we are also going to 
deal with the number of neutral instances. 

The variant RSR (1 − (1/E�)  performs better 
than RSR(1/E�) one. This demonstrates that in 
lexical contexts using PageRank with ,!,� = 1 −
(1/E�) offers a better performance. Other further 
work consists in exploring Social Medias to 
expand our retrieved sentiment resource 
obtaining real time evidences that occur in Web 
2.0.
