Abstract

In this paper we investigate the use of
character-level translation models to sup-
port the translation from and to under-
resourced languages and textual domains
via closely related pivot languages. Our ex-
periments show that these low-level models
can be successful even with tiny amounts
of training data. We test the approach on
movie subtitles for three language pairs and
legal texts for another language pair in a do-
main adaptation task. Our pivot translations
outperform the baselines by a large margin.

1 Introduction

Data-driven approaches have been extremely suc-
cessful in most areas of natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) and can be considered the main
paradigm in application-oriented research and de-
velopment. Research in machine translation is a
typical example with the dominance of statisti-
cal models over the last decade. This is even en-
forced due to the availability of toolboxes such as
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) which make it pos-
sible to build translation engines within days or
even hours for any language pair provided that ap-
propriate training data is available. However, this
reliance on training data is also the most severe
limitation of statistical approaches. Resources in
large quantities are only available for a few lan-
guages and domains. In the case of SMT, the
dilemma is even more apparent as parallel cor-
pora are rare and usually quite sparse. Some lan-
guages can be considered lucky, for example, be-
cause of political situations that lead to the pro-
duction of freely available translated material on
a large scale. A lot of research and development

would not have been possible without the Euro-
pean Union and its language policies to give an
example.

One of the main challenges of current NLP re-
search is to port data-driven techniques to under-
resourced languages, which refers to the major-
ity of the world’s languages. One obvious ap-
proach is to create appropriate data resources even
for those languages in order to enable the use of
similar techniques designed for high-density lan-
guages. However, this is usually too expensive
and often impossible with the quantities needed.
Another idea is to develop new models that can
work with (much) less data but still make use
of resources and techniques developed for other
well-resourced languages.

In this paper, we explore pivot translation tech-
niques for the translation from and to resource-
poor languages with the help of intermediate
resource-rich languages. We explore the fact
that many poorly resourced languages are closely
related to well equipped languages, which en-
ables low-level techniques such as character-
based translation. We can show that these tech-
niques can boost the performance enormously,
tested for several language pairs. Furthermore, we
show that pivoting can also be used to overcome
data sparseness in specific domains. Even high
density languages are under-resourced in most
textual domains and pivoting via in-domain data
of another language can help to adapt statistical
models. In our experiments, we observe that re-
lated languages have the largest impact in such a
setup.

The remaining parts of the paper are organized
as follows: First we describe the pivot translation
approach used in this study. Thereafter, we dis-

cuss character-based translation models followed
by a detailed presentation of our experimental
results. Finally, we briefly summarize related
work and conclude the paper with discussions and
prospects for future work.

2 Pivot Models

Information from pivot languages can be incorpo-
rated in SMT models in various ways. The main
principle refers to the combination of source-
to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models.
In our setup, one of these models includes a
resource-poor language (source or target) and the
other one refers to a standard model with ap-
propriate data resources. A condition is that we
have at least some training data for the translation
between pivot and the resource-poor language.
However, for the original task (source-to-target
translation) we do not require any data resources
except for purposes of comparison.

We will explore various models for the transla-
tion between the resource-poor language and the
pivot language and most of them are not compat-
ible with standard phrase-based translation mod-
els. Hence, triangulation methods (Cohn and La-
pata, 2007) for combining phrase tables are not
applicable in our case. Instead, we explore a
cascaded approach (also called “transfer method”
(Wu and Wang, 2009)) in which we translate the
input text in two steps using a linear interpo-
lation for rescoring N-best lists. Following the
method described in (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007)
and (Wu and Wang, 2009), we use the best n hy-
potheses from the translation of source sentences
s to pivot sentences p and combine them with the
top m hypotheses for translating these pivot sen-
tences to target sentences t:

t̂ ≈ argmax
t

L∑
k=1

αλspk h
sp
k (s, p) + (1− α)λ

pt
k h

pt
k (p, t)

where hxyk are feature functions for model xy
with appropriate weights λxyk .

1 Basically, this
means that we simply add the scores and, sim-
ilar to related work, we assume that the feature
weights can be set independently for each model
using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och,

1Note, that we do not require the same feature functions
in both models even though the formula above implies this
for simplicity of representation.

2003). In our setup we added the parameter α
that can be used to weight the importance of one
model over the other. This can be useful as we
do not consider the entire hypothesis space but
only a small subset of N-best lists. In the sim-
plest case, this weight is set to 0.5 making both
models equally important. An alternative to fit-
ting the interpolation weight would be to per-
form a global optimization procedure. However,
a straightforward implementation of pivot-based
MERT would be prohibitively slow due to the
expensive two-step translation procedure over n-
best lists.

A general condition for the pivot approach is to
assume independent training sets for both transla-
tion models as already pointed out by (Bertoldi
et al., 2008). In contrast to research presented
in related work (see, for example, (Koehn et al.,
2009)) this condition is met in our setup in which
all data sets represent different samples over the
languages considered (see section 4).2

3 Character-Based SMT

The basic idea behind character-based translation
models is to take advantage of the strong lexi-
cal and syntactic similarities between closely re-
lated languages. Consider, for example, Figure
1. Related languages like Catalan and Spanish or
Danish and Norwegian have common roots and,
therefore, use similar concepts and express them
in similar grammatical structures. Spelling con-
ventions can still be quite different but those dif-
ferences are often very consistent. The Bosnian-
Macedonian example also shows that we do not
have to require any alphabetic overlap in order to
obtain character-level similarities.

Regularities between such closely related lan-
guages can be captured below the word level. We
can also assume a more or less monotonic rela-
tion between the two languages which motivates
the idea of translation models over character N-
grams treating translation as a transliteration task
(Vilar et al., 2007). Conceptually it is straightfor-
ward to think of phrase-based models on the char-
acter level. Sequences of characters can be used
instead of word N-grams for both, translation and
language models. Training can proceed with the
same tools and approaches. The basic task is to

sentences.

tions between closely related languages (either sharing
parts of the same alphabet or not).

prepare the data to comply with the training pro-
cedures (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Data pre-processing for training models on
the character level. Spaces are represented by ’ ’ and
each sentence is treated as one sequence of characters.

3.1 Character Alignment
One crucial difference is the alignment of charac-
ters, which is required instead of an alignment of
words. Clearly, the traditional IBM word align-
ment models are not designed for this task es-
pecially with respect to distortion. However, the
same generative story can still be applied in gen-
eral. Vilar et al. (2007) explore a two-step proce-
dure where words are aligned first (with the tradi-
tional IBM models) to divide sentence pairs into
aligned segments of reasonable size and the char-
acters are then aligned with the same algorithm.

An alternative is to use models designed for
transliteration or related character-level transfor-
mation tasks. Many approaches are based on
transducer models that resemble string edit oper-
ations such as insertions, deletions and substitu-
tions (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998). Weighted fi-
nite state transducers (WFST’s) can be trained on
unaligned pairs of character sequences and have
been shown to be very effective for transliteration
tasks or letter-to-phoneme conversions (Jiampoja-
marn et al., 2007). The training procedure usually
employs an expectation maximization (EM) pro-

cedure and the resulting transducer can be used to
find the Viterbi alignment between characters ac-
cording to the best sequence of edit operations ap-
plied to transform one string into the other. Exten-
sions to this model are possible, for example the
use of many-to-many alignments which have been
shown to be very effective in letter-to-phoneme
alignment tasks (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007).

One advantage of the edit-distance-based trans-
ducer models is that the alignments they pre-
dict are strictly monotonic and cannot easily be
confused by spurious relations between charac-
ters over longer distances. Long distance align-
ments are only possible in connection with a se-
ries of insertions and deletions that usually in-
crease the alignment costs in such a way that they
are avoided if possible. On the other hand, IBM
word alignment models also prefer monotonic
alignments over non-monotonic ones if there is no
good reason to do otherwise (i.e., there is frequent
evidence of distorted alignments). However, the
size of the vocabulary in a character-level model
is very small (several orders of magnitude smaller
than on the word level) and this may cause serious
confusion of the word alignment model that very
much relies on context-independent lexical trans-
lation probabilities. Hence, for character align-
ment, the lexical evidence is much less reliable
without their context.

It is certainly possible to find a compromise be-
tween word-level and character-level models in
order to generalize below word boundaries but
avoiding alignment problems as discussed above.
Morpheme-based translation models have been
explored in several studies with similar motiva-
tions as in our approach, a better generalization
from sparse training data (Fishel and Kirik, 2010;
Luong et al., 2010). However, these approaches
have the drawback that they require proper mor-
phological analyses. Data-driven techniques ex-
ist even for morphology, but their use in SMT
still needs to be shown (Fishel, 2009). The sit-
uation is comparable to the problems of integrat-
ing linguistically motivated phrases into phrase-
based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003). Instead we opt
for a more general approach to extend context to
facilitate, especially, the alignment step. Figure 3
shows how we can transform texts into sequences
of bigrams that can be aligned with standard ap-
proaches without making any assumptions about
linguistically motivated segmentations.

Figure 3: Two Spanish sentences as sequences of char-
acter bigrams with a final ’ ’ marking the end of a sen-
tence.

In this way we can construct a parallel corpus with
slightly richer contextual information as input to
the alignment program. The vocabulary remains
small (for example, 1267 bigrams in the case of
Spanish compared to 84 individual characters in
our experiments) but lexical translation probabili-
ties become now much more differentiated.

With this, it is now possible to use the align-
ment between bigrams to train a character-level
translation system as we have the same number of
bigrams as we have characters (and the first char-
acter in each bigram corresponds to the charac-
ter at that position). Certainly, it is also possible
to train a bigram translation model (and language
model). This has the (one and only) advantage
that one character of context across phrase bound-
aries (i.e. character N-grams) is used in the se-
lection of translation alternatives from the phrase
table.3

3.2 Tuning Character-Level Models

A final remark on training character-based SMT
models is concerned with feature weight tun-
ing. It certainly makes not much sense to com-
pute character-level BLEU scores for tuning fea-
ture weights especially with the standard settings
of matching relatively short N-grams. Instead
we would still like to measure performance in
terms of word-level BLEU scores (or any other
MT evaluation metric used in minimum error
rate training). Therefore, it is important to post-
process character-translated development sets be-
fore adjusting weights. This is simply done
by merging characters accordingly and replacing
the place-holders with spaces again. Thereafter,
MERT can run as usual.

3.3 Evaluation

Character-level translations can be evaluated in
the same way as other translation hypotheses,
for example using automatic measures such as

3Using larger units (trigrams, for example) led to lower
scores in our experiments (probably due to data sparseness)
and, therefore, are not reported here.

BLEU, NIST, METEOR etc. The same simple
post-processing as mentioned in the previous sec-
tion can be applied to turn the character transla-
tions into “normal” text. However, it can be use-
ful to look at some other measures as well that
consider near matches on the character level in-
stead of matching words and word N-grams only.
Character-level models have the ability to produce
strings that may be close to the reference and still
do not match any of the words contained. They
may generate non-words that include mistakes
which look like spelling-errors or minor gram-
matical mistakes. Those words are usually close
enough to the correct target words to be recog-
nized by the user, which is often more acceptable
than leaving foreign words untranslated. This is
especially true as many unknown words represent
important content words that bear a lot of infor-
mation. The problem of unknown words is even
more severe for morphologically rich language as
many word forms are simply not part of (sparse)
training data sets. Untranslated words are espe-
cially annoying when translating languages that
use different writing systems. Consider, for ex-
ample, the following subtitles in Macedonian (us-
ing Cyrillic letters) that have been translated from
Bosnian (written in Latin characters):

reference: И чаша вино, како и секогаш.

word-based: И čašu vina, како секогаш.

char-based: И чаша вино, како секогаш.

reference: Во старото светилиште.

word-based: Во starom svetilǐstu.

char-based: Во стар светилиштето.

The underlined parts mark examples of character-
level differences with respect to the reference
translation. For the pivot translation approach, it
is important that the translations generated in the
first step can be handled by the second one. This
means, that words generated by a character-based
model should at least be valid input words for the
second step, even though they might refer to er-
roneous inflections in that context. Therefore, we
add another measure to our experimental results
presented below – the number of unknown words
with respect to the input language of the second
step. This applies only to models that are used
as the first step in pivot-based translations. For
other models, we include a string similarity mea-
sure based on the longest common subsequence
ratio (LCSR) (Stephen, 1992) in order to give an
impression about the “closeness” of the system

output to the reference translations.

4 Experiments

We conducted a series of experiments to test
the ideas of (character-level) pivot translation for
resource-poor languages. We chose to use data
from a collection of translated subtitles com-
piled in the freely available OPUS corpus (Tiede-
mann, 2009b). This collection includes a large
variety of languages and contains mainly short
sentences and sentence fragments, which suits
character-level alignment very well. The selected
settings represent translation tasks between lan-
guages (and domains) for which only very limited
training data is available or none at all.

Below we present results from two general
tasks:4 (i) Translating between English and a
resource-poor language (in both directions) via
a pivot language that is close related to the
resource-poor language. (ii) Translating between
two languages in a domain for which no in-
domain training data is available via a pivot lan-
guage with in-domain data. We will start with
the presentation of the first task and the character-
based translation between closely related lan-
guages.

4.1 Task 1: Pivoting via Related Languages

We decided to look at resource-poor languages
from two language families: Macedonian repre-
senting a Slavic language from the Balkan re-
gion, Catalan and Galician representing two Ro-
mance languages spoken mainly in Spain. There
is only little or no data available for translating
from or to English for these languages. However,
there are related languages with medium or large
amounts of training data. For Macedonian, we
use Bulgarian (which also uses a Cyrillic alpha-
bet) and Bosnian (another related language that
mainly uses Latin characters) as the pivot lan-
guage. For Catalan and Galician, the obvious
choice was Spanish (however, Portuguese would,
for example, have been another reasonable op-
tion for Galician). Table 1 lists the data avail-
able for training the various models. Furthermore,
we reserved 2000 sentences for tuning parameters

4In all experiments we use standard tools like Moses,
Giza++, SRILM, mteval etc. Details about basic settings are
omitted here due to space constraints but can be found in
the supplementary material. The data sets are available from
here: http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/∼joerg/index.php?resources

and another 2000 sentences for testing. For Gali-
cian, we only used 1000 sentences for each set
due to the lack of additional data. We were espe-
cially careful when preparing the data to exclude
all sentences from tuning and test sets that could
be found in any pivot or direct translation model.
Hence, all test sentences are unseen strings for all
models presented in this paper (but they are not
comparable with each other as they are sampled
individually from independent data sets).

titles. Number of sentences (#sent’s) and number of
words (#words) in thousands (k) and millions (M) (av-
erages of source and target language).

The data sets represent several interesting test
cases: Galician is the least supported language
with extremely little training data for building our
pivot model. There is no data for the direct model
and, therefore, no explicit baseline for this task.
There is 30 times more data available for Catalan-
English, but still too little for a decent standard
SMT model. Interesting here is that we have more
or less the same amount of data available for the
baseline and for the pivot translation between the
related languages. The data set for Macedonian
– English is by far the largest among the baseline
models and also bigger than the sets available for
the related pivot languages. Especially Macedo-
nian – Bosnian is not well supported. The inter-
esting questions is whether tiny amounts of pivot
data can still be competitive. In all three cases,
there is much more data available for the trans-
lation models between English and the pivot lan-
guage.

In the following section we will look at the
translation between related languages with vari-
ous models and training setups before we con-
sider the actual translation task via the bridge lan-
guages.

words with respect to the translation model from the pivot language to English.

4.1.1 Translating Related Languages
The main challenge for the translation mod-

els between related languages is the restriction to
very limited parallel training data. Character-level
models make it possible to generalize to very ba-
sic translation units leading to robust models in
the sense of models without unknown events. The
basic question is whether they provide reasonable
translations with respect to given accepted refer-
ences. Tables 2 and 3 give a comprehensive sum-
mary of various models for the languages selected
in our experiments.

We can see that at least one character-based
translation model outperforms the standard word-
based model in all cases. This is true (and not very
surprising) for the language pairs with very little
training data but it is also the case for language
pairs with slightly more reasonable data sets like
Bulgarian-Macedonian. The automatic measures
indicate decent translation performances at this
stage which encourages their use in pivot trans-
lation that we will discuss in the next section.

Furthermore, we can also see the influence of
different character alignment algorithms. Some-
what surprisingly, the best results are achieved
with IBM alignment models that are not designed
for this purpose. Transducer-based alignments

produce consistently worse translation models (at
least in terms of BLEU scores). The reason for
this might be that the IBM models can handle
noise in the training data more robustly. How-
ever, in terms of unknown words, WFST-based
alignment is very competitive and often the best
choice (but not much different from the best IBM
based models). The use of character bigrams
leads to further BLEU improvements for all data
sets except Galician-Spanish. However, this data
set is extremely small, which may cause unpre-
dictable results. In any case, the differences
between character-based alignments and bigram-
based ones are rather small and our experiments
do not lead to conclusive results.

4.1.2 Pivot Translation

In this section we now look at cascaded transla-
tions via the related pivot language. Tables 4 and
5 summarize the results for various settings.

As we can see, the pivot translations for Cata-
lan and Galician outperform the baselines by a
large margin. Here, the baselines are, of course,
very weak due to the minimal amount of train-
ing data. Furthermore, the Catalan-English test
set appears to be very easy considering the rela-
tively high BLEU scores achieved even with tiny

amounts of training data for the baseline. Still, no
test sentence appears in any training or develop-
ment set for either direct translation or pivot mod-
els. From the results, we can also see that Catalan
and Galician are quite different from Spanish and
require language-specific treatment. Using a large
Spanish – English model (with over 30% BLEU
in both directions) to translate from or to Cata-
lan or Galician is not an option. The experiments
show that character-based pivot models lead to
better translations than word-based pivot models
(in terms of BLEU scores). This reflects the per-
formance gains presented in Table 2. Rescoring
of N-best lists, on the other hand, does not have
a big impact on our results. However, we did not
spend time optimizing the parameters of N-best
size and interpolation weight.

The results from the Macedonian task are not as
clear. This is especially due to the different setup
in which the baseline uses more training data than
any of the related language pivot models. How-
ever, we can still see that the pivot translation via
Bulgarian clearly outperforms the baseline. For
the case of translating to Macedonian via Bulgar-
ian, the word-based model seems to be more ro-
bust than the character-level model. This may be
due to a larger number of non-words generated
by the character-based pivot model. In general,

the BLEU scores are much lower for all models
involved (even for the high-density languages),
which indicates larger problems with the gener-
ation of correct output and intermediate transla-
tions.

Interesting is the fact that we can achieve al-
most the same performance as the baseline when
translating via Bosnian even though we had much
less training data at our disposal for the translation
between Macedonian and Bosnian. In this setup,
we can see that a character-based model was nec-
essary in order to obtain the desired abstraction
from the tiny amount of training data.

4.2 Task 2: Pivoting for Domain Adaptation

Sparse resources are not only a problem for spe-
cific languages but also for specific domains.
SMT models are very sensitive to domain shifts
and domain-specific data is often rare. In the fol-
lowing, we investigate a test case of translating
between two languages (English and Norwegian)
with reasonable amounts of data resources but in
the wrong domain (movie subtitles instead of le-
gal texts). Here again, we facilitate the transla-
tion process by a pivot language, this time with
domain-specific data.

The task is to translate legal texts from Norwe-
gian (Bokmål) to English and vice versa. The test
set is taken from the English–Norwegian Parallel
Corpus (ENPC) (Johansson et al., 1996) and con-
tains 1493 parallel sentences (a selection of Eu-
ropean treaties, directives and agreements). Oth-
erwise, there is no training data available in this
domain for English and Norwegian. Table 6 lists
the other data resources we used in our study.

As we can see, there is decent amount of train-
ing data for English – Norwegian, but the domain
is strikingly different. On the other hand, there

Table 6: Training data available for the domain adapta-
tion task. DGT-TM refers to the translation memories
provided by the JRC (Steinberger et al., 2006)

is in-domain data for other languages like Danish
that may act as an intermediate pivot. Further-
more, we have out-of-domain data for the transla-
tion between pivot and Norwegian. The sizes of
the training data sets for the pivot models are com-
parable (in terms of words). The in-domain pivot
data is controlled and very consistent and, there-
fore, high quality translations can be expected.
The subtitle data is noisy and includes various
movie genres. It is important to mention that the
pivot data still does not contain any sentence in-
cluded in the English–Norwegian test set.

Table 7 summarizes the results of our experi-
ments when using Danish and in-domain data as
a pivot in translations from and to Norwegian.

Table 7: Translating out-of-domain data via Dan-
ish. Models using in-domain data are marked with
dgt and out-of-domain models are marked with subs.
subs+dgtLM refers to a model with an out-of-domain
translation model and an added in-domain language
model. The subscripts wo, ch and bi refer to word,
character and bigram models, respectively.

The influence of in-domain data in the transla-

tion process is enormous. As expected, the out-
of-domain baseline does not perform well even
though it uses the largest amount of training data
in our setup. It is even outperformed by the in-
domain pivot model when pretending that Norwe-
gian is in fact Danish. For the translation into En-
glish, the in-domain language model helps a lit-
tle bit (similar resources are not available for the
other direction). However, having the strong in-
domain model for translating to (and from) the
pivot language improves the scores dramatically.
The out-of-domain model in the other part of the
cascaded translation does not destroy this advan-
tage completely and the overall score is much
higher than any other baseline.

In our setup, we used again a closely related
language as a pivot. However, this time we
had more data available for training the pivot
translation model. Naturally, the advantages of
the character-level approach diminishes and the
word-level model becomes a better alternative.
However, there can still be a good reason for the
use of a character-based model as we can see in
the success of the bigram model (–subsbi–) in the
translation from Norwegian to English (via Dan-
ish). A character-based model may generalize be-
yond domain-specific terminology which leads to
a reduction of unknown words when applied to
a new domain. Note that using a character-based
model in step two could possibly cause more harm
than using it in step one of the pivot-based pro-
cedure. Using n-best lists for a subsequent word-
based translation in step two may fix errors caused
by character-based translation simply by ignoring
hypotheses containing them, which makes such a
model more robust to noisy input.

Finally, as an alternative, we can also look at
other pivot languages. The domain adaptation
task is not at all restricted to closely related pivot
languages especially considering the success of
word-based models in the experiments above. Ta-
ble 8 lists results for three other pivot languages.

Surprisingly, the results are much worse than
for the Danish test case. Apparently, these mod-
els are strongly influenced by the out-of-domain
translation between Norwegian and the pivot lan-
guage. The only success can be seen with an-
other closely related language, Swedish. Lexical
and syntactic similarity seems to be important to
create models that are robust enough for domain
shifts in the cascaded translation setup.

5 Related Work

There is a wide range of pivot language ap-
proaches to machine translation and a number
of strategies have been proposed. One of them
is often called triangulation and usually refers
to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and
Lapata, 2007). Phrase translation probabilities
are merged and lexical weights are estimated by
bridging word alignment models (Wu and Wang,
2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008). Cascaded translation
via pivot languages are discussed by (Utiyama
and Isahara, 2007) and are frequently used by var-
ious researchers (de Gispert and Mariño, 2006;
Koehn et al., 2009; Wu and Wang, 2009) and
commercial systems such as Google Translate.
A third strategy is to generate or augment data
sets with the help of pivot models. This is, for
example, explored by (de Gispert and Mariño,
2006) and (Wu and Wang, 2009) (who call it the
synthetic method). Pivoting has also been used
for paraphrasing and lexical adaptation (Bannard
and Callison-Burch, 2005; Crego et al., 2010).
(Nakov and Ng, 2009) investigate pivot languages
for resource-poor languages (but only when trans-
lating from the resource-poor language). They
also use transliteration for adapting models to a
new (related) language. Character-level SMT has
been used for transliteration (Matthews, 2007;
Tiedemann and Nabende, 2009) and also for the
translation between closely related languages (Vi-
lar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009a).

6 Conclusions and Discussion

In this paper, we have discussed possibilities to
translate via pivot languages on the character
level. These models are useful to support under-
resourced languages and explore strong lexical
and syntactic similarities between closely related
languages. Such an approach makes it possible
to train reasonable translation models even with

extremely sparse data sets. Moreover, charac-
ter level models introduce an abstraction that re-
duce the number of unknown words dramatically.
In most cases, these unknown words represent
information-rich units that bear large portions of
the meaning to be translated. The following illus-
trates this effect on example translations with and
without pivot model:Example: Catalan � English (via Spanish)Referene: I have to grade these papers.Baseline: Tinque quali�ar these ex�amens.Pivotword: Tinque quali�ar these tests.Pivotchar: I have to grade these papers.Example: Maedonian � English (via Bulgarian)Referene: It's a simple matter of self-preservation.Baseline: It's simply a question of ñåáåñî÷óâóâà»å.Pivotword: That's a matter of ñåáåñî÷óâóâà»å.Pivotchar: It's just a question of yourself.
Leaving unseen words untranslated is not only an-
noying (especially if the input language uses a
different writing system) but often makes transla-
tions completely incomprehensible. Pivot trans-
lations will still not be perfect (see example
two above), but can at least be more intelli-
gible. Character-based models can even take
care of tokenization errors as the one shown
above (“Tincque” should be two words “Tinc
que”). Fortunately, the generation of non-word
sequences (observed as unknown words) does not
seem to be a big problem and no special treatment
is required to avoid such output. We would still
like to address this issue in future work by adding
a word level LM in character-based SMT. How-
ever, (Vilar et al., 2007) already showed that this
did not have any positive effect in their character-
based system. In a second study, we also showed
that pivot models can be useful for adapting to
a new domain. The use of in-domain pivot data
leads to systems that outperform out-of-domain
translation models by a large margin. Our find-
ings point to many prospects for future work.
For example, we would like to investigate combi-
nations of character-based and word-based mod-
els. Character-based models may also be used for
treating unknown words only. Multiple source ap-
proaches via several pivots is another possibility
to be explored. Finally, we also need to further
investigate the robustness of the approach with re-
spect to other language pairs, data sets and learn-
ing parameters.
