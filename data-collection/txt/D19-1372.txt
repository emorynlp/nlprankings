Abstract

Much previous work has been done in attempt-
ing to identify humor in text. In this pa-
per we extend that capability by proposing a
new task: assessing whether or not a joke is
humorous. We present a novel way of ap-
proaching this problem by building a model
that learns to identify humorous jokes based
on ratings gleaned from Reddit pages, consist-
ing of almost 16,000 labeled instances. Using
these ratings to determine the level of humor,
we then employ a Transformer architecture
for its advantages in learning from sentence
context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach and show results that are com-
parable to human performance. We further
demonstrate our model’s increased capabili-
ties on humor identification problems, such as
the previously created datasets for short jokes
and puns. These experiments show that this
method outperforms all previous work done on
these tasks, with an F-measure of 93.1% for
the Puns dataset and 98.6% on the Short Jokes
dataset.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in natural language processing
and neural network architecture have allowed for
widespread application of these methods in Text
Summarization (Liu et al., 2018), Natural Lan-
guage Generation (Bahuleyan, 2018), and Text
Classification (Yang et al., 2016). Such advances
have enabled scientists to study common language
practices. One such area, humor, has garnered fo-
cus in classification (Zhang and Liu, 2014; Chen
and Soo, 2018), generation (He et al., 2019; Vali-
tutti et al., 2013), and in social media (Raz, 2012).

The next question then is, what makes a joke
humorous? Although humor is a universal con-
struct, there is a wide variety between what each
individual may find humorous. We attempt to fo-
cus on a subset of the population where we can

quantitatively measure reactions: the popular Red-
dit r/Jokes thread. This forum is highly popu-
lar - with tens of thousands of jokes being posted
monthly and over 16 million members. Although
larger joke datasets exist, the r/Jokes thread is un-
paralleled in the amount of rated jokes it contains.
To the best of our knowledge there is no compa-
rable source of rated jokes in any other language.
These Reddit posts consist of the body of the joke,
the punchline, and the number of reactions or up-
votes. Although this type of humor may only be
most enjoyable to a subset of the population, it is
an effective way to measure responses to jokes in
a large group setting.1

What enables us to perform such an analysis
are the recent improvements in neural network ar-
chitecture for natural language processing. These
breakthroughs started with the Convolutional Neu-
ral Network (LeCun et al., 1998) and have recently
included the inception (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and
progress of the Attention mechanism (Luong et al.,
2015; Xu et al., 2015), and the Transformer archi-
tecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).

2 Related Work

In the related work of joke identification, we find a
myriad of methods employed over the years: sta-
tistical and N-gram analysis (Taylor and Mazlack,
2004), Regression Trees (Purandare and Litman,
2006), Word2Vec combined with K-NN Human
Centric Features (Yang et al., 2015), and Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (Chen and Soo, 2018).

This previous research has gone into many set-
tings where humor takes place. Chen and Soo
(2018) studied audience laughter compared to tex-
tual transcripts in order to identify jokes in con-
versation, while much work has also gone into us-

ing and creating datasets like the Pun of the Day
(Yang et al., 2015), 16000 One-liners (Mihalcea
and Strapparava, 2005), and even Ted Talks (Chen
and Soo, 2018).

3 Data

We gathered jokes from a variety of sources, each
covering a different type of humor. These datasets
include jokes of multiple sentences (the Short
Jokes dataset), jokes with only one sentence (the
Puns dataset), and more mixed jokes (the Reddit
dataset). We have made our code and datasets
open source for others to use. 2

3.1 Reddit

Our Reddit data was gathered using Reddit’s pub-
lic API, collecting the most recent jokes. Every
time the scraper ran, it also updated the upvote
score of the previously gathered jokes. This data
collection occurred every hour through the months
of March and April 2019. Since the data was al-
ready split into body and punchline sections from
Reddit, we created separate datasets containing the
body of the joke exclusively and the punchline of
the joke exclusively. Additionally, we created a
dataset that combined the body and punchline to-
gether.

Some sample jokes are shown in Table 1, above.
The distribution of joke scores varies wildly, rang-
ing from 0 to 136,354 upvotes. We found that
there is a major jump between the 0-200 upvote
range and the 200 range and onwards, with only
6% of jokes scoring between 200-20,000. We used
this natural divide as the cutoff to decide what
qualified as a funny joke, giving us 13884 not-
funny jokes and 2025 funny jokes.

3.2 Short Jokes

The Short Jokes dataset, found on Kaggle, con-
tains 231,657 short jokes scraped from various
joke websites with lengths ranging from 10 to 200

characters. The previous work by Chen and Soo
(2018) combined this dataset with the WMT162
English news crawl. Although their exact com-
bined dataset is not publicly available, we used
the same method and news crawl source to cre-
ate a similar dataset. We built this new Short Jokes
dataset by extracting sentences from the WMT162
news crawl that had the same distribution of words
and characters as the jokes in the Short Jokes
dataset on Kaggle3. This was in order to match
the two halves (jokes and non-jokes) as closely as
possible.

3.3 Pun of the Day

This dataset was scraped by Yang et al. (2015) and
contains 16001 puns and 16002 not-punny sen-
tences. We gratefully acknowledge their help in
putting together and giving us use of this dataset.
These puns were constructed from the Pun of
the Day website while the negative samples were
gathered from news websites.

4 Methods

In this section we will discuss the methods and
model used in our experiments.

4.1 Our Model

We have chosen to use the pre-trained BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2018) as the base of our model. BERT
is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder
and was initially trained on a 3.3 billion word cor-
pus. The model can be fined-tuned with another
additional output layer for a multitude of other
tasks. We chose to use this Transformer based
model as our initial platform because of its success
at recognizing and attending to the most important
words in both sentence and paragraph structures.

In Figure 1, originally designed by Vaswani
et al. (2017), we see the architecture of a Trans-
former model: the initial input goes up through
an encoder, which has two parts: a multi-headed

self attention layer, followed by a feed-forward
network. It then outputs the information into the
decoder, which includes the previously mentioned
layers, plus an additional masked attention step.
Afterwords, it is transformed through a softmax
into the output. This model’s success is in large
part due to the Transformer’s self-attention layers.

We chose a learning rate of 2e-05 and a max
sequence length of 128. We trained the model for a
maximum of 7 epochs, creating checkpoints along
the way.

4.2 Training

Since our data was unbalanced we decided to up-
sample the humorous jokes in training. We split
the dataset into a 75/25 percent split, stratifying
with the labels. We then upsampled the minority
class in the training set until it reached an even 50
percent. This helped our model learn in a more
balanced way despite the uneven amount of non-
humorous jokes. Our validation and test sets were
composed of the remaining 25%, downsampling
the data into a 50/50 class split so that the accuracy
metric could be balanced and easily understood.

To show how our model compares to the pre-
vious work done, we also test on the Short Joke
and Pun datasets mentioned in the Data section.
For these datasets we will use the metrics (Accu-
racy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score) designated
in Chen and Soo (2018) as a comparison. We use

the same model format as previously mentioned,
trained on the Reddit dataset. We then immedi-
ately apply the model to predict on the Short Joke
and Puns dataset, without further fine-tuning, in
order to compare the model. However, because
both the Puns and Short Joke datasets have large
and balanced labels, we do so without the upsam-
pling and downsampling steps used for the Reddit
dataset.

5 Experiments

In this section we will introduce the baselines and
models used in our experiments.

5.1 Baselines

In order to have fair baselines, we used the fol-
lowing two models: a CNN with Highway Lay-
ers as described by Chen and Soo (2018) and de-
veloped by Srivastava et al. (2015), and human
performance from a study on Amazon’s Mechan-
ical Turk. We wanted to have the general pop-
ulation rate these same jokes, thus showing the
difference between a general audience and a spe-
cific subset of the population, in particular, Red-
dit r/Jokes users. Since the Reddit users obvi-
ously found these jokes humorous, this experiment
would show whether or not a more general popu-
lation agreed with those labels.

We had 199 unique participants rate an average
of 30 jokes each with the prompt ”do you find this
joke humorous?” If the participant was evaluating
a sample from a body or punchline only dataset we
prefaced our question with a sentence explaining
that context, for example: ”Below is the punch-
line of a joke. Based on this punchline, do you
think you would find this joke humorous?” Taking
these labels, we used the most frequently chosen
tag from a majority vote to calculate the percent-
ages found in the Human section of Table 2.

5.2 Results

In Table 2, we see the results of our experiment
with the Reddit dataset. We ran our models on

the body of the joke exclusively, the punchline ex-
clusively, and both parts together (labeled full in
our table). On the full dataset we found that the
Transformer achieved an accuracy of 72.4 percent
on the hold out test set, while the CNN was in the
high 60’s. We also note that the general human
classification found 66.3% of the jokes to be hu-
morous.

In order to understand what may be happening
in the model, we used the body and punchline only
datasets to see what part of the joke was most im-
portant for humor. We found that all of the models,
including humans, relied more on the punchline
of the joke in their predictions (Table 2). Thus,
it seems that although both parts of the joke are
needed for it to be humorous, the punchline car-
ries higher weight than the body. We hypothesize
that this is due to the variations found in the dif-
ferent joke bodies: some take paragraphs to set up
the joke, while others are less than a sentence.

Our experiment with the Short Jokes dataset
found the Transformer model’s accuracy and F1
score to be 0.986. This was a jump of 8 percent
from the most recent work done with CNNs (Ta-
ble 4).

The results on the Pun of the Day dataset are
shown in Table 3 above. It shows an accuracy
of 93 percent, close to 4 percent greater accuracy
than the best CNN model proposed. Although the
CNN model used a variety of techniques to extract
the best features from the dataset, we see that the
self-attention layers found even greater success in
pulling out the crucial features.

6 Discussion

Considering that a joke’s humor value is subjec-
tive, the results on the Reddit dataset are surpris-

ing. The model has used the context of the words
to determine, with high probability, what an av-
erage Reddit r/Jokes viewer will find humorous.
When we look at the general population’s opinion
as well, we find a stark difference between their
preferences and those of the Reddit users (Table
2). We would hypothesize that our model is learn-
ing the specific type of humor enjoyed by those
who use the Reddit r/Jokes forum. This would
suggest that humor can be learned for a specific
subset of the population.

The model’s high accuracy and F1 scores on the
Short Jokes and Pun of the Day dataset show the
effectiveness of the model for transfer learning.
This result is not terribly surprising. If the model
can figure out which jokes are funny, it seems to be
an easier task to tell when something isn’t a joke
at all.

Although these results have high potential,
defining the absolute truth value for a joke’s humor
is a challenging, if not impossible task. However,
these results indicate that, at least for a subset of
the population, we can find and identify jokes that
will be most humorous to them.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we showed a method to define the
measure of a joke’s humor. We explored the
idea of using machine learning tools, specifically
a Transformer neural network architecture, to dis-
cern what jokes are funny and what jokes are not.
This proposed model does not require any human

interaction to determine, aside from the text of the
joke itself, which jokes are humorous. This archi-
tecture can predict the level of humor for a specific
audience to a higher degree than a general audi-
ence consensus. We also showed that this model
has increased capability in joke identification as
a result, with higher accuracy and F1 scores than
previous work on this topic.
