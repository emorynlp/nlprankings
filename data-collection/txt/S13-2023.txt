Abstract

We present a supervised learning approach to
cross-lingual textual entailment that explores
statistical word alignment models to predict
entailment relations between sentences writ-
ten in different languages. Our approach
is language independent, and was used to
participate in the CLTE task (Task#8) or-
ganized within Semeval 2013 (Negri et al.,
2013). The four runs submitted, one for
each language combination covered by the test
data (i.e. Spanish/English, German/English,
French/English and Italian/English), achieved
encouraging results. In terms of accuracy,
performance ranges from 38.8% (for Ger-
man/English) to 43.2% (for Italian/English).
On the Italian/English and Spanish/English
test sets our systems ranked second among
five participants, close to the top results (re-
spectively 43.4% and 45.4%).

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) is an ex-
tension of the Textual Entailment task (Dagan and
Glickman, 2004) that consists in deciding, given
two texts T and H written in different languages
(respectively called text and hypothesis), if H can
be inferred from T (Mehdad et al., 2010). In the
case of SemEval 2013, the task is formulated as
a multi-class classification problem in which there
are four possible relations between T and H: for-
ward (T → H), backward (T ← H), bidirectional
(T ↔ H) and “no entailment”.

Targeting the identification of semantic equiva-
lence and information disparity between topically

related sentences, CLTE recognition can be seen as a
core task for a number of cross-lingual applications.
Among others, multilingual content synchronization
has been recently proposed as an ideal framework
for the exploitation of CLTE components and the in-
tegration of semantics and machine translation (MT)
technology (Mehdad et al., 2011; Mehdad et al.,
2012b; Bronner et al., 2012; Monz et al., 2011).

In the last few years, several methods have been
proposed for CLTE. These can be roughly divided
in two main groups (Negri et al., 2012): i) those us-
ing a pivoting strategy by translating H into the lan-
guage of T and then using monolingual TE compo-
nents1, and those directly using cross-lingual strate-
gies. Among this second group, several sources of
cross-lingual knowledge have been used, such as
dictionaries (Kouylekov et al., 2012; Perini, 2012),
phrase and paraphrase tables (Mehdad et al., 2012a),
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) word alignment mod-
els (Wäschle and Fendrich, 2012), MT of sub-
segments (Esplà-Gomis et al., 2012), or semantic
Wordnets (Castillo, 2011).

In this work we propose a CLTE detection method
based on a new set of features using word align-
ment as a source of cross-lingual knowledge. This
set, which is richer than the one by (Wäschle and
Fendrich, 2012), is aimed not only at grasping infor-
mation about the proportion of aligned words, but
also about the distribution of the alignments in both

1In the first CLTE evaluation round at Semeval 2012, for
instance, the system described in (Meng et al., 2012) used the
open source EDITS system (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010; Negri
et al., 2009) to calculate similarity scores between monolingual
English pairs.

H and T . This set of features is later used by two
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for detect-
ing CLTE separately in both directions (T → H and
T ← H). We use the combined output of both clas-
sifiers for performing the CLTE detection.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
describes the features used and the classification
method; Section 3 explains the experimental frame-
work and the results obtained for the different
language-pair sets; finally, the conclusions obtained
from the results are summarised in Section 4.

2 ALTN System

In our approach we have implemented a system
based on supervised learning. It takes an unlabeled
sentence pair as input (T and H) and labels it au-
tomatically with one of the possible four valid en-
tailment relations. The architecture is depicted in
Figure 1.

A key component to our approach is the word
alignment model. In a preprocessing step it is
trained on a set of parallel texts for the target lan-
guage pair. Next, different features based on the
word alignment are extracted. Taking the features
and the target language pair labels as input, a su-
pervised learning algorithm is run to fit a model to
the data. The last step is to use the model to au-
tomatically label unseen instances with entailment
relations.

2.1 Features

What characterizes our submission is the use of
word alignment features to capture entailment rela-
tions. We extract the following features from a word
alignment model for a given sentence pair (all fea-
tures are calculated for both T and H):

• proportion of aligned words in the sentence
(baseline);

• number of unaligned sequences of words nor-
malized by the length of the sentence;

• length of the longest sequence of aligned words
normalized by the length of the sentence;

• length of the longest sequence of unaligned
words normalized by the length of the sentence;

Figure 1: System architecture

• average length of the aligned word sequences;

• average length of the unaligned word se-
quences;

• position of the first unaligned word normalized
by the length of the sentence;

• position of the last unaligned word normalized
by the lenght of the sentence;

• proportion of aligned n-grams in the sentence
(n varying from 1 to 5).

These features are language independent as they
are obtained from statistical models that take as in-
put a parallel corpus. Provided that there exist paral-
lel data for a given language pair, the only constraint
in terms of resources, the adoption of these features
makes our approach virtually portable across lan-
guages with limited effort.

2.2 CLTE Model

Our CLTE model is composed by two supervised bi-
nary classifiers that predict whether there is entail-
ment between the T and H . One classifier checks

129



for forward entailment (T → H) and the other
checks for backward entailment (T ← H). The out-
put of both classifiers is combined to form the four
valid entailment decisions:

• forward and backward classifier output true:
“bidirectional” entailment;

• forward is true and backward is false:
“forward” entailment;

• forward is false and backward is true:
“backward” entailment;

• both forward and backward output false: “no
entailment” relation.

Both binary classifiers were implemented using
the SVM implementation of Weka (Hall et al.,
2009).

3 Experiments

In our submission we experimented with three stan-
dard word alignment algorithms: the hidden Markov
model (HMM) (Vogel et al., 1996) and IBM models
3 and 4 (Brown et al., 1993). They are implemented
in the MGIZA++ package (Gao and Vogel, 2008).
Building on a probabilistic lexical model to establish
mappings between words in two languages, these
models compute alignments between the word po-
sitions in two input sentences S1 and S2. The mod-
els are trained incrementally: HMM is the base for
IBM model 3, which is the base for IBM model 4.
To train our models, we used 5 iterations of HMM,
and 3 iterations of IBM models 3 and 4.

Word alignments produced by these models are
asymmetric (S1 → S2 6= S2 → S1). To cope
with this, different heuristics (Koehn et al., 2005)
have been proposed to obtain symmetric alignments
from two asymmetric sets (S1 ↔ S2). We ex-
perimented with three symmetrization heuristics,
namely: union, intersection, and grow-diag-final-
and, a more complex symmetrization method which
combines intersection with some alignments from
the union.

To train the word alignment models we used
the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) con-
catenated with the News Commentary corpus2 for

2http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/

three language pairs: English-German (2,079,049
sentences), English-Spanish (2,123,036 sentences),
English-French (2,144,820 sentences). For English-
Italian we only used the parallel data available in Eu-
roparl (1,909,115 sentences) since this language pair
is not covered by the News Commentary corpus.

For our submitted run the SVM classifiers were
trained using the whole training set. Such dataset
consists of 1,000 pairs for each of the four language
combinations, resulting from a concatenation of the
training and test sets used for the first round of eval-
uation at SemEval 2012 (Negri et al., 2012; Negri et
al., 2011). We have set a polynomial kernel with pa-
rameters empirically estimated on the training set:
C = 2.0, and d = 1. After some preliminary ex-
periments we have concluded that the HMM model
in conjunction with the intersection symmetrization
provides the best results.

Our results, calculated over the 500 test pairs pro-
vided for each language combination, are presented
in Table 3. As can be seen from the table, our system
consistently outperforms the best average run of all
participants and is the second best system for Span-
ish/English and Italian/English. For the other two
languages, French/English and German/English, it
is the 3rd best system with a larger distance from top
results. The motivations for such lower results, cur-
rently under investigation, might be related to lower
performance in terms of word alignment, the core
of our approach. The first step of our analysis will
hence address, and in case try to cope with, signifi-
cant differences in word alignment performance af-
fecting results.

Overall, considering the small distance from top
results, and the fact that our approach does not re-
quire deep linguistic processing to be reasonably ef-
fective for any language pair for which parallel cor-
pora are available, our results are encouraging and
motivate further research along such direction.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we presented the participation of the
Fondazione Bruno Kessler in the Semeval 2013
Task#8 on Cross-lingual Textual Entailment for
Content Synchronization. To identify entailment re-
lations between texts in different languages, our sys-
tem explores the use of word alignment features

within a supervised learning setting. In our ap-
proach, word alignment models obtained by statis-
tical methods from parallel corpora leverage infor-
mation about the number, the proportion, and the
distribution of aligned terms in the input sentences.
In terms of accuracy results over the SemEval 2013
CLTE test data, performance ranges from 38.8%
(for German/English) to 43.2% (for Italian/English).
On the Italian/English and Spanish/English test sets
our systems ranked second among five participants,
close to the top results (respectively 43.4% and
45.4%). Such results suggest that the use of word
alignment models to capture sentence-level seman-
tic relations in different language settings represents
a promising research direction.
