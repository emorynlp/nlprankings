Abstract 

In this paper we present a method to 
automatically identify linguistic contexts 
which contain possible causes of 
emotions or emotional states from Italian 
newspaper articles (La Repubblica 
Corpus). Our methodology is based on 
the interplay between relevant linguistic 
patterns and an incremental repository of 
common sense knowledge on emotional 
states and emotion eliciting situations. 
Our approach has been evaluated with 
respect to manually annotated data. The 
results obtained so far are satisfying and 
support the validity of the methodology 
proposed. 

1 Introduction 

As it has been demonstrated in Balahur et al. 
(2010), mining the web to discriminate between 
objective and subjective content and extract the 
relevant opinions about a specific target is today 
a crucial as well as a challenging task due to the 
growing amount of available information.  
Opinions are just a part of the subjective content, 
which is expressed in texts. Emotions and 
emotional states are a further set of subjective 
data. Natural Language is commonly used to 
express emotions, attribute them and, most 
importantly, to indicate their cause(s).  
Due to the importance of linking the emotion to 
its cause, a recent subtask of Sentiment Analysis 

(SA) consists in the detection of the emotion 
cause event (ECE, Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 
2010) and focuses on the identification of the 
phrase (if present, as in 1 in bold) mentioning 
the event that is related to the emotional state (in 
italics):  

 
(1) Non poteva mancare un accenno alla 

strage di Bologna, che costringe l' animo 
a infinita vergogna. 
[There was a mention of Bologna 

massacre,   
that forces us to feel ashamed.] 

 
This kind of information is extremely 
interesting, since it can provide pragmatic 
knowledge about content words and their 
emotional/subjective polarity and consequently 
it can be employed for building up useful 
applications with practical purposes.  
The paper focuses on the development of a 
method for the identification of Italian sentences 
which contain an emotion cause phrase. Our 
approach is based on the interplay between 
linguistic patterns which allow the retrieval of 
emotion – emotion cause phrase couples and on 
the exploitation of an associated incremental 
repository of commonsense knowledge about 
events which elicit emotions or emotional states. 
The methodology is only partially language 
dependent and this approach can be easily 
extended to other languages such as Spanish. 
The repository is one of the main results of this 
work. It allows the discovery of pragmatic 
knowledge associated with various content 

153



words and can assign them a polarity value 
which can be further exploited in more complex 
SA and Opinion Mining tasks. 
The present paper is structured as follows. 
Section 2 shortly describes related work and 
state of the art on this task. Section 3 focuses on 
the description of the methodology. Section 4 
describes the annotation scheme and the corpus 
used for the creation of the test set. Section 5 
reports on the experiments and their results. 
Conclusions and future works are described in 
Section 6. 

1 Related Works 

Emotional states are often triggered by the 
perception of external events (pre-events) 
(Wierzbicka, 1999). In addition to this, 
emotional states can also be the cause of events 
(post-events; Chun-Ren, 2010). This suggests to 
consider emotional states as a pivot and structure 
the relations between emotional states and 
related events as a tri-tuple of two pairs: 
 

(2) <<pre-events, emotional state> 
<emotional state, post-event>> 

 
This study focuses on the relationship between 
the first pair of the tri-tuple, namely pre-events 
(or ECE), and emotional states.  
Previous works on this task have been carried 
out for Chinese (Lee et al., 2009, Chen et al., 
2009, Lee et al., 2010). ECE can be explicitly 
expressed as arguments, events, propositions, 
nominalizations and nominals. Lee et al (2010) 
restrict the definition of ECE as the immediate 
cause of the emotional state which does not 
necessarily correspond to the actual emotional 
state trigger or what leads to the emotional state.  
Their work considers all possible linguistic 
realization of EKs (nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
prepositional phrases) and ECEs.  On the basis 
of an annotated corpus, correlations between 
emotional states and ECEs have been studied in 
terms of different linguistic cues (e.g. position of 
the cause events, presence of epistemic 
markers...) thus identifying seven groups of 
cues. After that, they have been implemented in 
a rule-based system, which is able to identify: i.) 
the EK; ii.) the ECE and its position (same 
sentence as the EK, previous sentence with 

respect to the EK, following sentence with 
respect to the EK) and (iii.) the experiencer of 
the emotional state(s).The system evaluation has 
been performed on the annotated corpus in two 
phases: firstly, identifying those sentences 
containing a co-occurrence of EK and ECE; 
secondly, for those contexts where an EK and 
ECE co-occurs, identifying the correct ECE. 
Standard Precision, Recall and F-measure have 
been used. The baseline is computed by 
assuming that the first verb on the left of the EK 
is the ECE. The system outperforms the baseline 
f-score by 0.19. Although the results are not 
very high, the system accuracy for the detection 
of ECEs is reported to be three times more 
accurate than the baseline. 

2 Emotional states between linguistic 
patterns and commonsense 
knowledge 

The work of Lee et al. (2010) represents the 
starting point for the development of our 
method. We depart from their approach in the 
following points: i.) use of data mining 
techniques (clustering plus a classifier) to 
automatically induce the rules for sentential 
contexts in which an event cause phrase is 
expressed; and ii.) exploitation of a 
commonsense repository of EK - eliciting ECE 
noun couples for the identification of the correct 
ECE noun. The remaining of this section will 
describe in details the creation of the repository 
and the methodology we have adopted. 

2.1 A source for commonsense knowledge 
of EKs and ECEs in Italian 

Recently crowdsourcing techniques that exploit 
the functionalities of the Web 2.0 have been 
used in AI and NLP for reducing the efforts, 
costs and time for the creation of Language 
Resources. We have exploited the data from an 
on-line initiative launched in December 2010 by 
the Italian newspaper “Il Corriere della Sera” 
which asked its readers to describe the year 2010 
with 10 words. 2,378 people participated in the 
data collection for a total of 22,469 words. We 
exploited these data to identify preliminary 
couples of emotional states and cause events, 
and thus create a repository of affective 
commonsense knowledge, by extracting all 

154



bigrams realized by nouns for a total of 18,240 
couples noun1-noun2. After this operation, an 
adapted Italian version of WN-Affect 
(Strapparava – Valitutti, 2004) obtained by 
means of mapping procedures through 
MultiWordNet (MWN) has been applied to each 
item of the bigrams. By means of a simple 
query, we have extracted all bigrams where at 
least one item has an associated sense 
corresponding to the “emotion” category in WN-
Affect. We have applied WN-Affect again to 
these results and extracted only those bigrams 
where the unclassified item corresponded to the 
WN-Affect label of “emotion eliciting 
situation”. Finally, two lists of keywords have 
been obtained: one denoting EKs (133 lemmas) 
and the other denoting possible ECEs associated 
with a specific EK. The possible ECEs have 
been extended by exploiting MWN synsets and 
lexical relations of similar-to, pertains-
to, attribute and is-value-of. We 
have filtered the set of ECE keywords by 
selecting only those nouns whose top nodes 
uniquely belongs to the following ontological 
classes, namely: event, state, phenomenon, and 
act. After this operation we have 161 nominal 
lemmas of possible ECEs.  

2.2 Exploiting the repository for pattern 
induction 

The preliminary version of the repository of EK 
- ECE couples has been exploited in order to 
identify relevant syntagmatic patterns for the 
detection of nominal ECEs. The pattern 
induction phase has been performed on a parsed 
version of a large corpus of Italian, the La 
Repubblica Corpus (Baroni et al., 2004).  
We have implemented a pattern extractor that 
takes as input the couples of the seed words 
from the commonsense repository and extracted 
all combinations of EKs and its/their associated 
ECEs occurring in the same sentence, with a 
distance ranging from 1 to 8 possible intervening 
parts-of-speech. We have thus obtained 1,339 
possible patterns. This set has been cleaned both 
on the basis of pattern frequencies and with 
manual exploration. In total 47 patterns were 
selected and were settled among the features for 
the clustering and classifier ensemble which will 
be exploited for the identification of the 

sentential contexts which may contain an 
emotion cause phrase (see Section 5 for details). 

3 Developing a gold standard and 
related annotation scheme 

With the purpose of evaluating the validity and 
reliability of our approach, a reference annotated 
corpus (gold standard) has been created.  
The data collection has been performed in a 
semi-automatic way. In particular, we have 
extracted from an Italian lexicon, 
SIMPLE/CLIPS (Ruimy et al., 2003), all nouns 
marked with semantic type “Sentiment” to avoid 
biases for the evaluation and measure the 
coverage of the commonsense repository. The 
keywords have been used to query the La 
Repubblica Corpus and thus creating the corpus 
collection. We have restricted the length of the 
documents to be annotated to a maximum of 
three sentences, namely the sentence containing 
the emotion keyword, the one preceding it and 
the sentence immediately following. As a 
justification for this choice, we have assumed 
that causes are a local focus discourse 
phenomenon and should not be found at a long 
distance with respect to their effects (i.e. the 
emotion keyword). Finally, the corpus is 
composed by 6,000 text snippets for a total of 
738,558 tokens.  
The corresponding annotation scheme, It-
EmoCause, is based on recommendations and 
previous experience in event annotation (ISO-
TimeML), emotion event annotation (Lee et al., 
2009, Chen et al., 2010), emotion and affective 
computing annotation (EARL1, the HUMAINE 
Emotion Annotation and Representation 
Language, EmotiBlog, Boldrini et al, 2010). The 
scheme applies at two levels: phrase level and 
token level and it allows nested tags. Figure 1 
reports the BNF description of the scheme.  
Text consuming markables are  
<emotionWord>, <causePhrase> and 
<causeEmotion> tags, which are 
responsible, respectively, for marking the 
emotion keyword, the phrase expressing the 
cause emotion event and the token expressing 
the cause emotion. The values of the attribute 
emotionClass is derived from Ekman

(1972)'s classification and extended with the 
value UNDERSPECIFIED. This value is used as 
a cover term for all other types of emotion 
reducing disagreement and allowing further 
classifications on the basis of more detailed and 
different lists of emotions that each user can 
specify. Finally, the non-text consuming 
<EmLink> link puts in relation the cause 
emotion event or phrase with the emotion 
keyword.

The annotation has been performed by two 
expert linguists and validated by a judge. The 
tool used for the annotation is the Brandeis 
Annotation Tool (BAT)2. The corpus is currently 
under annotation and we concentrated mainly on 
the development of a test set. Not all markables 
and attributes have been annotated in this phase.

The inter-annotator agreement (IAA)3 on the 
detection of the cause event and the cause phrase 
are not satisfactory. To have reliable data, we 
have adopted a correction strategy by asking the 
annotators to assign a common value to 
disagreements. This has increased the IAA on 
cause emotion to K=0.45, and P&R= 0.46. A 
revision procedure of the annotation guidelines 
is necessary and annotation specifications must 
be developed so that the disagreement can be 
further reduced. Table 1 reports the figures 
about the annotated data so far.

4 Emotion cause detection: experiments 
and results 

In order to find out a set of rules for the 
detection of emotion cause phrase contexts, we 
experimented a combination of Machine 
Learning techniques, namely clustering and rule 
induction classifier algorithms. In particular, we 
want to exploit the output of a clustering 
algorithm as input to a rule learner classifier 
both available in the Weka platform (Witten and 
Frank, 2005). 
The clustering algorithm is the Expectation-
Maximization algorithm (EM; Hofmann and 
Puzicha, 1998). The EM is an unsupervised 
algorithm, commonly used for model-based

used for computing the IAA.

clustering and also applied in SA tasks 
(Takamura et al. 2006). In this work, we 
equipped the EM clustering model with 
syntagmatic, lexical and contextual features. The 
clustering algorithm has been trained on 2,000 
corpus instances of the potential EK - ECE 
couples of the repository from the La 
Repubblica corpus along with a three sentence 
context (i.e the sentence immediately preceding 
and that immediately following the sentence 
containing the EK). 
Four groups of features have been identified: the 
first set of features corresponds to a re-
adaptation of the rules implemented in Lee et al. 
(2010); the second set of features implements 
the 47 syntagmatic patterns that specifically 
codify the relation between the EK and the ECE 
(see Section 3.2); the last two set of features are 
composed, respectively, by a list of intra-
sentential bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams for a 
total of 364 different part-of-speech sequences 
with the EK as the first element and by a list of 6 
relevant collocational patterns which express 
cause-effect relationship between the  ECE and 
the EK, manually identified on the basis of the 
authors' intuitions. In Table 2 some examples of 
each group of features are reported4.

We expected two data clusters, one which

in the same sentence and another where either

http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Tanl_POS_Tagset 

the emotion cause it is not present or it occurs in 
a different sentence (i.e. the one before the EK 
or in the one following it). 
In order to evaluate the goodness of the cluster 
configuration created by the Weka version of the 
EM algorithm, we have run different clustering 
experiments. The results of each clustering 
analysis have been passed to the Weka PART 
rule-induction classifier. The best results were 
those which confirmed our working hypothesis, 
i.e. two clusters. The first cluster contains 869 
items while the second 1,131 items.  
The PART classifier provided a total of 49 
detection rules for the detection of EK – ECE 
contexts. The classifier identifies the occurrence 
of a cause phrase in the same sentence but is not 
able to identify the noun which corresponds to 
the ECE. 
The evaluation of the classifier has been 
performed on the 121 couples of EK – cause 
phrase of the test set. As we are aiming at 
spotting nominal causes of EKs, we have 
computed the baseline by considering as the 
correct phrase containing the ECE the first noun 
phrase occurring at the right of the emotion 
keyword and in the same sentence since this 
kind of ECEs tends to occur mostly at this 
position. In this way the baseline has an 
accuracy of  0.14 (only 33 NPs were correct 
over a total of 227 NPs at the right of the EKs). 
By applying the rules of the PART classifier, we 
have obtained an overall accuracy of 0.71, 
outperforming the baseline. As for the 
identification of the EK - cause phrase couples 
occurring in the same sentence, we computed 
standard Precision, Recall and F-measure. The 
results are reported in Table 3. The system tends 
to have a high precision (0.70) and a low recall 
(0.58).

After this, we tried to identify the correct 
nominal ECE in the cause phrase. Provided the 
reduced dimensions of the annotated corpus, no 
training set was available to train a further 

157



classifier. Thus, to perform this task we decided 
to exploit the commonsense repository. 
However, the first version of the repository is 
too small to obtain any relevant results. We 
enlarged it by applying two set of features (the 
syntagmatic patterns manually identified and the 
collocational patterns used for the clustering 
analysis). 

4.1 Incrementing the repository and 
discovering EK – ECE couples 

Our hypothesis is that the identification of the 
ECE(s) in context could be performed by 
looking for a plausible set of nouns which are 
associated with a specific EK and assumed to be 
its cause. This type of information is exactly the 
one contained in the repository described in 
Section 3.1. 
In order to work with a larger data set of ECE 
entries per emotion keyword, we have applied 
the syntagmatic patterns manually identified and 
the collocational patterns on two corpora: i.) La 
Repubblica and ii.) ItWaC5 (Baroni et al., 2009). 
For each EK - ECE couple identified we have 
kept track of the co-occurrence frequencies and 
computed the Mutual Information (MI). 
Frequency and MI are extremely relevant 
because they provide a reliability threshold for 
each couple of EK and ECE. In Table 4 we 
report some co-occurrences of the EK “ansia” 
[anxiety] and ECEs.

Repubblica Corpus)

Table 4- ECEs co-occurrences with EK

Each ECE has been associated to a probability 
measure of eventivity derived from MWN top 

                                                             
5 http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it 

ontological classes, obtained from the ratio 
between 1 and the sum of all top ontological 
classes associated to the ECE lemma. The top 
nodes “event”, “state”, “phenomenon”, and 
“act” have been considered as a unique top class 
by applying the TimeML definition of event6. 
This measure is useful in case more than one 
ECEs is occurring in the context in analysis as a 
disambiguation strategy. In fact, if more than 
one ECEs is present, that with the higher 
frequency, MI and eventivity score should be 
preferred.  
Furthermore, to make the repository more 
effective and also to associate an emotional 
polarity to the ECEs (i.e. whether they have 
positive, negative or neutral values) we have 
further extended the set of information by 
exploiting WN-Affect 1.1. In particular we have 
associated each EK to its emotional category 
(e.g. despondency, resentment, joy) and its 
emotional superclass (e.g. positive-emotion, 
negative-emotion, ambiguous-emotion).  
This extended version of the repository has been 
applied to identify the correct ECE noun for the 
95 couples of EK – ECE in the test set. We have 
splitted the whole set of EK – ECE couples into 
two subgroups: i.) EK – ECE couples occurring 
in the same sentence (82/95); and ii.) EK – ECE 
couples occurring in different sentences (13/95). 
By applying the repository to the first group, we 
were able to correctly identify 50% (41/82) of 
the ECE nouns for each specific EK when 
occurring in the same sentence. Moreover, we 
applied the repository also to the EK – ECE 
couples of the second group: a rough 30.76% 
(4/13) of the ECE occurring in sentences other 
that the one containing the EK can be correctly 
retrieved without increasing the number of false 
positives. This is possible thanks to the 
probability score computed by means of MWN 
top ontological classes, even if the number of 
annotated examples is too small to justify strong 
conclusions. 

                                                             
6 To clarify, the ECE “guerra” [war] has four 
senses in MWN. Three of them belong to the top 
ontological class of “event” and one to “state”. This 
possible ECE has 1 top ontological node, and its eventivity 
mesure is 1.

5 Conclusions and future works  

In this paper we describe a methodology based 
on the interplay between relevant linguistic 
patterns and an incremental repository of 
common sense knowledge of EK – ECE 
couples, which can be integrated into more 
complex systems for SA and Opinion Mining. 
The experimental results show that clustering 
techniques (EM clustering model) and a rule 
learner classifier (the PART classifier) can be 
efficiently combined to select and induce 
relevant linguistic patterns for the discovery of 
EK – ECE couples in the same sentence. The 
information thus collected has been organized 
into the repository of commonsense knowledge 
about emotions and their possible causes. The 
repository has been extended by using corpora 
of varying dimensions (la Repubblica and 
ItWaC) and effectively used to identify ECEs of 
specific emotion keywords.  
One interesting aspect of this approach is 
represented by the reduced manual effort both 
for the identification of linguistic patterns for the 
extraction of reliable information and for the 
maintenance and extension of specific language 
resources which can be applied also to domains 
other than SA. In addition to this, the method 
can be extended and applied to identify ECE 
realized by other POS, such as verbs and 
adjectives. 
As future works, we aim to extend the repository 
by extracting data from the Web and connecting 
it to SentiWordNet and WN-Affect. In 
particular, the connection to the existing 
language resources could be used to spot 
possible misclassifications and polarity values.
