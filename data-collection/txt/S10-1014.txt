Abstract

Sentiment ambiguous adjectives cause
major difficulties for existing algorithms
of sentiment analysis. We present an
evaluation task designed to provide a
framework for comparing different
approaches in this problem. We define the
task, describe the data creation, list the
participating systems and discuss their
results. There are 8 teams and 16 systems.

1 Introduction

In recent years, sentiment analysis has attracted
considerable attention (Pang and Lee, 2008). It is
the task of mining positive and negative opinions
from natural language, which can be applied to
many natural language processing tasks, such as
document summarization and question answering.
Previous work on this problem falls into three
groups: opinion mining of documents, sentiment
classification of sentences and polarity prediction
of words. Sentiment analysis both at document
and sentence level rely heavily on word level.

The most frequently explored task at word
level is to determine the semantic orientation
(SO) of words, in which most work centers on
assigning a prior polarity to words or word
senses in the lexicon out of context. However,
for some words, the polarity varies strongly with
context, making it hard to attach each to a
specific sentiment category in the lexicon. For
example, consider “low cost” versus “low
salary”. The word “low” has a positive
orientation in the first case but a negative
orientation in the second case.

Turney and Littman (2003) claimed that
sentiment ambiguous words could not be avoided

easily in a real-world application in the future
research. But unfortunately, sentiment
ambiguous words are discarded by most research
concerning sentiment analysis (Hatzivassiloglou
and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003;
Kim and Hovy, 2004). The exception work is
Ding et al. (2008). They call these words as
context dependant opinions and propose a
holistic lexicon-based approach to solve this
problem. The language they deal with is English.

The disambiguation of sentiment ambiguous
words can also be considered as a problem of
phrase-level sentiment analysis. Wilson et al.
(2005) present a two-step process to recognize
contextual polarity that employs machine
learning and a variety of features. Takamura et al.
(2006, 2007) propose latent variable model and
lexical network to determine SO of phrases,
focusing on “noun+adjective” pairs. Their
experimental results suggest that the
classification of pairs containing ambiguous
adjectives is much harder than those with
unambiguous adjectives.

The task 18 at SemEval 2010 provides a
benchmark data set to encourage studies on this
problem. This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 defines the task. Section 3 describes
the data annotation. Section 4 gives a brief
summary of 16 participating systems. Finally
Section 5 draws conclusions.

2 Task Set up

2.1 Task description

In this task, we focus on 14 frequently used
sentiment ambiguous adjectives in Chinese,
which all have the meaning of measurement, as
shown below.

81



(1) Sentiment ambiguous adjectives(SAAs)
={大 da “large”, 多 duo “many”, 高 gao
“high”, 厚 hou “thick”, 深 shen “deep”, 重
zhong “heavy”, 巨大 ju-da “huge”, 重大
zhong-da “great”, 小 xiao “small”, 少 shao
“few”, 低 di “low”, 薄 bao “thin”, 浅 qian
“shallow”, 轻 qing “light”}

These adjectives are neutral out of context, but
when they co-occur with some target nouns,
positive or negative emotion will be evoked.
Although the number of such ambiguous
adjectives is not large, they are frequently used
in real text, especially in the texts expressing
opinions and emotions.

The task is designed to automatically
determine the SO of these sentiment ambiguous
adjectives within context: positive or negative.
For example, 高 gao “high”should be assigned
as positive in 工资高 gong-zi-gao “salary is
high”but negative in 价格高 jia-ge-gao “price is
high”.

This task was carried out in an unsupervised
setting. No training data was provided, but
external resources are encouraged to use.

2.2 Data Creation

We collected data from two sources. The main
part was extracted from Xinhua News Agency of
Chinese Gigaword (Second Edition) released by
LDC. The texts were automatically word-
segmented and POS-tagged using the open
software ICTCLAS1. In order to concentrate on
the disambiguation of sentiment ambiguous
adjectives, and reduce the noise introduced by
the parser, we extracted sentences containing
strings in pattern of (2), where the target nouns
are modified by the adjectives in most cases.
(2) noun+adverb+adjective (adjective∈SAAs)
e.g. 成本/n 较/d 低/a cheng-ben-jiao-di

“the cost is low.”
Another small part of data was extracted from

the Web. Using the search engine Google2, we
searched the queries as in (3):
(3) 很 hen “very”+ adjective (adjective∈SAAs )
From the returned snippets, we manually picked
out some sentences that contain the strings of (2).
Also, the sentences were automatically
segmented and POS-tagged using ICTCLAS.

Sentiment ambiguous adjectives in the data
were assigned as positive, negative or neutral,

1 http://www.ictclas.org/.
2 http://www.google.com/.

independently by two annotators. Since we focus
on the distinction between positive and negative
categories, the neutral instances were removed.
The inter-annotator agreement is in a high level
with a kappa of 0.91. After cases with
disagreement were negotiated between the two
annotators, a gold standard annotation was
agreed upon. In total 2917 instances were
provided as the test data in the task, and the
number of sentences of per target adjective is
listed in Table 2.

Evaluation was performed in micro accuracy
and macro accuracy:

where N is the number of all target words, in is

instances.

2.3 Baseline

We group 14 sentiment ambiguous adjectives
into two categories: positive-like adjectives and
negative-like adjectives. The former has the
connotation towards large measurement, whereas
the latter towards small measurement.
(4) Positive-like adjectives (Pa) ={大 da “large”,

多 duo “many”, 高 gao “high”, 厚 hou
“thick”, 深 shen “deep”, 重 zhong “heavy”,
巨大 ju-da “huge”, 重大 zhong-da “great”}

(5) Negative-like adjectives (Na) ={ 小 xiao
“small”, 少 shao “few”, 低 di “low”, 薄 bao
“thin”, 浅 qian “shallow”, 轻 qing “light”}

We conduct a baseline in the dataset. Not
considering the context, assign all positive-like
adjectives as positive and all negative-like
adjectives as negative. The micro accuracy of the
baseline is 61.20%.

The inter-annotator agreement of 0.91 can be
considered as the upper bound of the dataset.

3 Systems and Results

We published firstly trial data and then test data.
In total 11 different teams downloaded both the
trial and test data. Finally 8 teams submitted their
experimental results, including 16 systems.

82



3.1 Results

Table 1 lists all systems’scores, ranked from
best to worst performance measured by micro
accuracy. To our surprise, the performance of
different systems differs greatly. The micro
accuracy of the best system is 94.20% that is
43.12% higher than the worst system. The
accuracy of the best three systems is even higher
than inter-annotator agreement. The performance
of the worst system is only a little higher than
random baseline, which is 50% when we
randomly assign the SO of sentiment ambiguous
adjectives.

Table 1: The scores of 16 systems

Table 2 shows that the performance of
different systems differs greatly on each of 14
target adjectives. For example, the accuracy of
大 da “large”is 95.53% by one system but only
46.51% by another system.

3.2 Systems

In this section, we give a brief description of the
systems.

YSC-DSAA This system creates a new word
library named SAAOL (SAA-Oriented Library),
which is built manually with the help of software.
SAAOL consists of positive words, negative
words, NSSA, PSSA, and inverse words. The
system divides the sentences into clauses using
heuristic rules, and disambiguates SAA by
analyzing the relationship between SAA and the
keywords.

HITSZ_CITYU This group submitted three
systems, including one baseline system and two
improved systems.

HITSZ_CITYU_3: The baseline system is
based on collocation of opinion words and their
targets. For the given adjectives, their
collocations are extracted from People’s Daily
Corpus. With human annotation, the system
obtained 412 positive and 191 negative
collocations, which are regarded as seed
collocations. Using the context words of seed
collocations as features, the system trains a one-
class SVM classifier.

HITSZ_CITYU_2 and HITSZ_CITYU_1:
Using HowNet-based word similarity as clue, the
authors expand the seed collocations on both
ambiguous adjectives side and collocated targets
side. The authors then exploit sentence-level
opinion analysis to further improve performance.
The strategy is that if the neighboring sentences
on both sides have the same polarity, the
ambiguous adjective is assigned as the same
polarity; if the neighboring sentences have
conflicted polarity, the SO of ambiguous
adjective is determined by its context words and
the transitive probability of sentence polarity.
The two systems use different parameters and
combination strategy.

OpAL This system combines supervised
methods with unsupervised ones. The authors
employ Google translator to translate the task
dataset from Chinese to English, since their
system is working in English. The system
explores three types of judgments. The first one
trains a SVM classifier based on NTCIR data and
EmotiBlog annotations. The second one uses
search engine, issuing queries of “noun + SAA +
AND + non-ambiguous adjective”. The non-
ambiguous adjectives include positive set
(“positive, beautiful, good”) and negative set
(“negative, ugly, bad”). An example is “price
high and good”. The third one uses “too, very-

rules”. The final result is determined by the
majority vote of the three components.

CityUHK This group submitted four systems.
Both machine learning method and lexicon-
based method are employed in their systems. In
the machine learning method, maximum entropy
model is used to train a classifier based on the
Chinese data from NTCIR opinion task. Clause-
level and sentence-level classifiers are compared.
In the lexicon-based method, the authors classify
SAAs into two clusters: intensifiers (our
positive-like adjectives in (4)) and suppressors
(our negative-like adjectives in (5)), and then use
the polarity of context to determine the SO of
SAAs.

CityUHK4: clause-level machine learning +
lexicon.

CityUHK3: sentence-level machine learning +
lexicon.

CityUHK2: clause-level machine learning.
CityUHK2: sentence-level machine learning.
QLK_DSAA This group submitted two

systems. The authors adopt their SELC model
(Qiu, et al., 2009), which is proposed to exploit
the complementarities between lexicon-based
and corpus-based methods to improve the whole
performance. They determine the sentence
polarity by SELC model, and simply regard the
sentence polarity as the polarity of SAA in the
sentence.

QLK_DSAA_NR: Based on the result of
SELC model, they inverse the SO of SAA when
it is modified by negative terms. Our task
includes only positive and negative categories, so
they replace the neutral value obtained by SELC
model by the predominant polarity of the
adjective.

QLK_DSAA_R: Based on the result of
QLK_DSAA_NR, they add a rule to cope with
two modifiers 偏 pian “specially” and 太 tai
“too”, which always have the negative meaning.

Twitter sentiment This group submitted three
systems. The authors use a training data collected
from microblogging platform. By exploiting
Twitter, they collected automatically a dataset
consisting of negative and positive expressions.
The sentiment classifier is trained using Naive
Bayes with n-grams of words as features.

Twitter Sentiment: Translating the task dataset
from Chinese to English using Google translator,
and then based on training data in English texts
from Twitter.

Twitter Sentiment_ext: With Twitter
Sentiment as basis, using extended data.

Twitter Sentiment_zh: Based on training data
in Chinese texts from Twitter.

Biparty This system transforms the problem
of disambiguating SAAs to predict the polarity
of target nouns. The system presents a
bootstrapping method to automatically build the
sentiment lexicon, by building a nouns-verbs
biparty graph from a large corpus. Firstly they
select a few nouns as seed words, and then they
use a cross inducing method to expand more
nouns and verbs into the lexicon. The strategy is
based on a random walk model.

4 Discussion

The experimental results of some systems are
promising. The micro accuracy of the best three
systems is over 93%. Therefore, the inter-
annotator agreement (91%) is not an upper
bound on the accuracy that can be achieved. On
the contrary, the experimental results of some
systems are disappointing, which are below our
predefined simple baseline (61.20%), and are
only a little higher than random baseline (50%).
The accuracy variance of different systems
makes this task more interesting.

The participating 8 teams exploit totally
different methods.

Human annotation. In YSC-DSAA system,
the word library of SAAOL is verified by human.
In HITSZ_CITYU systems, the seed collocations
are annotated by human. The three systems rank
top 3. Undoubtedly, human labor can help
improve the performance in this task.

Training data. The OpAL system employs
SVM machine learning based on NTCIR data
and EmotiBlog annotations. The CityUHK
systems trains a maximum entropy classifier
based on the annotated Chinese data from
NTCIR. The Twitter Sentiment systems use a
training data automatically collected from
Twitter. The results show that some of these
supervised methods based on training data
cannot rival unsupervised ones, partly due to the
poor quality of the training data.

English resources. Our task is in Chinese.
Some systems use English resources by
translating Chinese into English, as OpAL and
Twitter Sentiment. The OpAL system achieves a
quite good result, making this method a
promising direction. This also shows that
disambiguating SAAs is a common problem in
natural language.

5 Conclusion

This paper describes task 18 at SemEval-2010,
disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives.
The experimental results of the 16 participating
systems are promising, and the used approaches
are quite novel.

We encourage further research into this issue,
and integration of the disambiguation of
sentiment ambiguous adjectives into applications
of sentiment analysis.
