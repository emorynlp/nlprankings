Abstract

In the paper, we propose a new method of identifying terms nested within candidates for the
terms extracted from domain texts. The list of all terms is then ranked by the process of automatic
term recognition. Our method of identifying nested terms is based on two aspects: grammatical
correctness and normalised pointwise mutual information (NPMI) counted for all bigrams on
the basis of a corpus. NPMI is typically used for recognition of strong word connections but in
our solution we use it to recognise the weakest points within phrases to suggest the best place for
division of a phrase into two parts. By creating only two nested phrases in each step we introduce
a binary hierarchical term structure. In the paper, we test the impact of the proposed nested terms
recognition method applied together with the C-value ranking method to the automatic term
recognition task.

1 Introduction

The Automatic Term Recognition (ATR) task consists in identifying linguistic expressions that refer to
domain concepts. This is usually realised in two steps. In the first one, candidates for terms are identified
in a corpus of domain texts. This step usually consists in identifying grammatically correct phrases by
means of linguistically motivated grammars describing noun phrases in a given language. However,
sometimes no linguistic knowledge is utilised and candidates for terms are just frequent n-grams as in
(Wermter and Hahn, 2005). The second processing step consists in ranking the extracted candidates
and selecting those which are most important for a considered domain. This task is usually based on
statistics.

The ranking procedure can be based on different measures which are characterised as either
“termhood-based” or “unithood-based”. Kageura and Umino (1996) defined the termhood-based meth-
ods measure as “the degree that a linguistic unit is related to domain-specific concepts”, i.e. the likelihood
that a phrase is a valid domain term. The unithood-based methods measure the collocation strength of
word sequences, usually with the help of log-likelihood, pointwise mutual information or T-score mea-
sures, described in (Manning and Schütze, 1999), while ATR applications based on them are described
in e.g., (Pantel and Lin, 2001), (Sclano and Velardi, 2007). A comparison of these approaches is given
in (Pazienza et al., 2005). Some hybrid solutions to the ATR problem have also been proposed (Vu et al.,
2008) or (Ventura et al., 2014). In the paper (Korkontzelos et al., 2008), the comparison between these
two groups of methods led the authors to the conclusion that the termhood-based methods outperform
the unithood-based ones.

This paper is devoted to the problem of selecting candidates for terms from an annotated domain
corpus. Our approach is based on the C-value method, (Frantzi et al., 2000). An important feature of this
method that attracted our attention was the focus on nested terms. Frantzi et al. (2000) described nested
terms as terms that appear within other longer terms, and may or may not appear by themselves in the
corpus. They show that recognition of nested terms is very important in terms extraction, but they also
give examples when a nested phrase constructed according to the grammar rules is not a term. One of

these examples is the phrase real time clock which has two nested phrases: real time and time clock, but
the second one is not a good term. The authors define the C-value measure that is used to rank candidate
terms extracted from a domain corpus, together with their nested terms. It is counted on the basis of the
frequency of the term as a whole phrase in the corpus, its frequency as a nested phrase in other terms,
the number of different phrases in which that nested phrase occurred, and its length. The authors expect
that phrases that aren’t considered as terms should be placed at the end of the list ordered according to
this coefficient value.

We applied the C-value method to extract terminology from a corpus of hospital discharge documents
in Polish. Experiments, where different methods of counting the C-value were tested, are described in
(Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2014). Unfortunately, a few grammatically correct but semantically odd
phrases were always placed in the top part of the ranking list of terms. Examples of such phrases, placed
among the 200 top positions, are: USG jamy ‘USG of cavity’ being a nested phrase of the very frequent
phrase USG jamy brzusznej ‘USG of abdominal cavity’, infekcja górnych dróg ‘infection of upper tract’
or powiększony węzeł ‘enlarged node’.

We propose a method that prevents the creation and promotion of such nested phrases to be consid-
ered as terms. The main idea is to use a unithood-based method e.g., Normalised Pointwise Mutual
Information (NPMI) (Bouma, 2009) for driving recognition of nested phrases. Our solution is based on
the division of each considered phrase into only two parts. The places where a phrase is divided must
create nested phrases that are consistent with grammar rules. Usually, there are several possible places
for division of a phrase. From all of them, we choose the weakest point according to NPMI counted for
bigrams on the basis of the whole corpus. So, as a bigram constitutes a strong collocation, it prevents the
phrase from being dividing in this place, and does not usually lead to the creation of semantically odd
nested phrases, of which examples are given above.

The analysed corpus of Polish medical texts is described in Section 2. In the following two sections
we present the method in detail. Then, in Section 5, we describe the comparison of the resulting lists of
terms ranked according to the C-value measure, for two methods of recognition of nested phrases , i.e.:
for all possible phrases fulfilling grammatical rules, and for the method proposed in the paper.

2 Corpus description

The domain corpus consists of 3116 hospital discharge documents gathered at a hospital in Poland.
Texts came from six departments and were written by several physicians of different specialties. The
collected texts were analysed using standard general purpose NLP tools. The morphological tagger Pan-
tera (Acedański, 2010), cooperating with the Morfeusz analayser (Woliński, 2006), was used to divide
the text into tokens and annotate them with morhosyntactic tags. They included a part of speech name
(POS), a base form, as well as case, gender and number information, where they were appropriate. This
information is used by shallow grammars recognising the boundaries of nominal phrases — term can-
didates and, also,sources for nested phrases. The corpus consists of about 2 million tokens in which a
shallow grammar recognised more than 22 thousand noun phrases.

The corpus contains quite a lot of words unrecognised by Morfeusz as the vocabulary of the clinical
documents significantly differs from general Polish texts. Additionally, the texts are not very well edited
despite the spelling correction tools being usually turned on, so they contain quite a lot of misspelled
words. This results in 22,000 unrecognised tokens (many of them are medications, acronyms and units)
that are not taken into account when nominal phrases are recognised. Consequently, it lowers the number
of phrases, and affects the quality of some of them. In (Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2011), the problems
of morphological annotation of hospital documents in Polish are presented and the reasons for the many
unrecognised tokens are highlighted.

3 Nested phrases recognition

In this section, we describe the way to create a list of term candidates that takes into account nested
phrases. This task is usually supported by linguistic knowledge that allows for identifying candidates for
terms which are syntactically valid.

34



In the extraction step, we identified complex noun phrases consisting of nouns with adjectival and
nominal modifiers obeying Polish grammar rules (in particular, case, gender and number agreement).
The types of Noun Phrases under consideration can be schematically defined as below:

AdjPhrase Noun AdjPhrase
AdjPhrase Noun
Noun AdjPhrase
NounPhrase NounPhrase-in-genitive

Noun Phrases were extracted from the corpus using a cascade of shallow grammars. As Polish is a
highly inflected language, we operate on simplified base forms of phrases in our computations, con-
sisting of lemmas of subsequent words. This approach, proposed for ATR in Polish in (Marciniak and
Mykowiecka, 2013), allows us to unify forms of phrases in different cases and numbers. For example:
przewlekłe zapalenie gardła, przewlekłe zapalenia gardła, przewlekłego zapalenia gardła, przewlekłych
zapaleń gardła are forms of ‘chronic pharyngitis’ in nominative singular and plural and genitive in both
numbers.1 The extracted phrases constitute a foundation for creating the list of term candidates. Then
we add nested phrases, recognised within those phrases, to the list of term candidates. The rules for
identifying nested terms are described in the rest of this section.

3.1 Motivations
The original C-value method (Frantzi et al., 2000) recommends that all grammatical phrases, created
from the maximal phrases identified in a corpus, should be considered as term candidates. But using
this method, we quite frequently obtain nested grammatical subphrases which are syntactically correct,
but semantically odd. One such phrase is infekcja górnych dróg ‘infection (of the) upper tract’ that is
created from infekcja górnych dróg oddechowych ‘infection (of the) upper respiratory tract’.2 The last
phrase has many different longer phrases in which it is nested, eg: (częsta, drobna, ostra, bakteryjna...)
infekcja górnych dróg oddechowych ‘(often, minor, acute, bacterial...) infection (of the) upper respiratory
tract’, but it always concerns drogi oddechowe ‘respiratory tract’. We observe that the bigram drogi
oddechowe ‘respiratory tract’ constitutes a strong collocation. So the original phrase shouldn’t be divided
in this place to create a phrase containing the word drogi ‘tract’ without adding its type, i.e., oddechowe
‘respiratory’ in this case. Nominal phrases are usually constructed from two parts (except for coordinated
phrases and nouns with more complex subcategoriaztion frames, which usually do not fulfill agreement
constraints in Polish). For nominal phrases from domain corpora, we suggest that the best place for the
division is indicated by the weakest bigram.

After considering patterns of nominal phrases in Polish, we realised that the weakest connections
are usually between two nominal phrases (the last pattern). So, an adjective more likely modifies
the nearest noun and not the whole phrase, as in: prawidłowaadj mikrofloranoun górnychadj drógnoun
oddechowychadj ‘normal microflora (of the) upper respiratory tract’. In this phrase, all the outermost
adjectives are important parts of nominal phrases constructed around their nearest nouns, and it should
be divided into two nominal phrases: prawidłowa mikroflora ‘normal microflora’ and górne drogi odde-
chowe ‘upper respiratory tract’. However, it is not the universal rule. Let us consider another example:
częste infekcje górnych dróg oddechowych ‘frequent infections (of the) upper respiratory tract’, where
częste ‘frequent’ modifies the whole phrase. To account for this observation, we may slightly prefer
divisions into two nominal phrases instead of an adjective and a nominal phrase.

3.2 Algorithm
From several methods for counting the strength of bigrams we chose the normalised pointwise mutual
information proposed by Bouma, (2009), as it is less sensitive to occurrence frequency. We were looking
for a method for which the bigram, consisting of a rare and a frequent token, will be high if the rare token
only appears in connection with the frequent token, as, for example, for esowate skrzywienie ‘S-shaped
curvature’. The definition of this measure for the ‘x y’ bigram, where x and y are lemmas of sequence

1Further in the paper we will use phrases in the nominal case and singular number forms. These forms may differ slightly
from the same phrases being nested ones (in genitive).

tokens, is given in (1), where p(x,y) is a probability of the ‘x y’ bigram in the considered corpus, and
p(x), p(y) are probabilities of ‘x’ and ‘y’ unigrams respectively.

NPMI(x, y) =
(

ln
p(x, y)

p(x)p(y)

)/
− ln p(x, y) (1)

First, we extract all the grammatical phrases from the corpus, taking into account only the maximal
one. Then, for each phrase we identify all places where it can be divided according to grammar rules.
We count NPMI for those and indicate the weakest connection in the phrase. Then, we divide it into two
parts in this position. There are two possible situations: the first, when the phrase is divided into two
nominal phrases; the second, when one phrase is a nominal phrase while the second one is an adjective
phrase. In the first case, we add both parts to the list of term candidates and process the obtained parts of
the phrase in the same way. In the second case, only a nominal phrase is added to the list and only this
phrase is further divided.

Figure 1: Procedure of nested phrases recognition

To take into account the specificity of adjectives in Polish nominal phrases described in 3.1, we decided
to introduce a slight modification to the basic algorithm. If the weakest connection prefers the cutting of
an adjective part from a phrase, we find the nearest place where the phrase is divided into two nominal
phrases. Then, we compare the NPMI value referring to this bigram with 120% (fixed experimentally)
of the lowest NPMI value. If it is still lower, we cut off one outermost element (adjective or adverb)
from this adjectival part of the phrase and add the slightly shorter phrase to the term list. In other case,
we divide the original phrase in that second place into two nominal phrases. The algorithm is given in
Figure 1.

Table 2: The NPMI value for the bigrams of the phrase: infekcja górnych dróg oddechowych

3.3 Examples
Let us consider examples illustrating the method. We compare nested phrases obtained from the phrase
infekcja górnych dróg oddechowych ‘infection (of the) upper respiratory tract’ for the two following
methods: creating all grammatically correct nested phrases, and the NPMI driven method. The consid-
ered phrase is constructed according to the following pattern: Nounj Adji Nouni Adji where indexes
indicate agreement constraints, so a grammatically correct phrase may consist of: Nounj Adji Nouni,
but can’t be constructed as: Nounj Adji. Thus, infekcja górnych dróg ‘infection of the upper tract’ is
grammatically correct, while infekcja górnych ‘infection of upper’ is not. The phrase can be divided
in one of two places indicated by the ‘|’ character: infekcja | górnych dróg | oddechowych, ‘infection
| upper tract | respiratory’3 and it is possible to create six grammatically correct phrases, see Table 1.
Applying our method, we first count NPMI for the places of possible divisions. The NPMI value for
two bigrams infekcja górny ‘infection upper’ and droga oddechowy ‘tract respiratory’ counted for the
corpus described in Section 2 are given in Table 2. The lower value is for the first bigram so the phrase
can be divided into: infekcja ‘infection’ and górne drogi oddechowe ‘upper respiratory tract’. Both parts
constitute nominal phrases so the phrase is divided in this place and both parts are added to the list of
term candidates. In the next step only the second phrase can be recursively divided. The weaker connec-
tion is for: górny droga ‘upper tract’. So the adjective górna ‘upper’ is cut off the phrase and only the
nested phrase drogi oddechowe ‘respiratory tract’ is accepted as a term candidate. Table 1 contains all
the nested phrases obtained by both methods for the considered phrase. It may be noted that our method,
correctly, does not extract two semantically odd nested phrases from the six obtained by the first method.

Let us consider a phrase where the lowest NPMI indicates division into an adjective and a nominal
phrase: boczneadj skrzywienienoun kręgosłupanoun ‘lateral curvature (of the) spine’. The phrase can
be divided in both places: boczne | skrzywienie | kręgosłupa ‘lateral | curvature | spine’. The weakest
connection is for the bigram: boczny skrzywienie ‘lateral curvature’, it indicates division into the nominal
phrase skrzywienie kręgosłupa ‘curvature (of the) spine’, and the adjective boczne ‘lateral’. The other
place of division causes the phrase to be divided into two nominal phrases. So we compare the NPMI for
skrzywienie kręgosłup ‘curvature spine’, with 120% NPMI boczny skrzywienie ‘lateral curvature’, see
Table 3. As the first value is lower than the second one, the method prefers to divide the phrase into
two nominal phrases boczne skrzywienie ‘lateral curvature’ and kręgosłup ‘spine’. The basic algorithm,
without multiplying NPMI values in some cases by 120%, creates a good term skrzywienie kręgosłupa
‘curvature (of the) spine’ instead of two nominal phrases: boczne skrzywienie ‘lateral curvature’ and

skrzywienie kręgosłup ‘curvature spine’ 0.80151

Table 3: The NPMI value for the bigrams of the phrase: boczne skrzywienie kręgosłupa

kręgosłup spine.
There are a few cases when the phrase division driven by the NPMI value prefers cutting off an ad-

jective in the first step instead of dividing it into two nominal phrases, see: okołoporodoweadj uszkodze-
nienoun splotunoun ramiennegoadj prawegoadj ‘perinatal damage (of) right brachial plexus’. Despite the
fact that okołoporodowe uszkodzenie splotu ramiennego ‘perinatal damage (of) brachial plexus’ is a good
term, we would prefer the division into two nominal phrases okołoporodowe uszkodzenie ‘perinatal dam-
age’ and splot ramienny prawy ‘right brachial plexus’. The last division reflects the internal construction
of the phrase that might be important in an ontology construction task which is one of the intended uses
of the method. In this case, we want to recognise nested phrases representing two concepts which are in
a relationship. The method still (correctly) cuts off the adjective częsty ‘frequent’ from the phrase częste
infekcje górnych dróg oddechowych ‘frequent infections (of the) upper respiratory tract’.

4 Terms ordering

To test to what extent our approach to the phrase selection problem influences the ultimate results of the
term selection algorithm, we used the C-value coefficient (Frantzi et al., 2000) to order extracted phrases.
The standard equation for this coefficient is given in (2) where p is the phrase under consideration, freq(p)
is a number of occurrences of this phrase both nested and in isolation, LP is a set of phrases containing
p, r(LP) – the number of different phrases in LP, and l(p) = log2(length(p)).

C-value(p) =

{
l(p) ∗ (freq(p)− 1r(LP )

∑
lp∈LP freq(lp)), if r(LP ) > 0,

l(p) ∗ freq(p), if r(LP ) = 0 (2)

The C-value ranking method is focused on deciding which nested phrases should be considered as
terms. It assigns higher values to phrases which, having the same frequency rate, occur more frequently
in isolation or occur in a larger number of different longer phrases, i.e., have different lexical contexts
within a set of initially extracted phrases. To account for the fact that long phrases tend to occur more
rarely than shorter ones, the result is multiplied by the logarithm of the phrase length. If a phrase occurs
only in isolation, its frequency rate defines the C-value. When a phrase occurs only in one context,
its C-value gets the value 0 as it is properly assumed to be incomplete. If a nested phrase occurs in a
lot of different contexts, its chances of constituting a domain term increase. A slight modification of
the method also allows for processing phrases of length 1, which originally all got a 0 value. For this
purpose, for one word phrases, the logarithm of the length (used in the original solution) is replaced with
a non zero constant. In (Barrón-Cedeno et al., 2009), where this method was applied to Spanish texts,
the authors set it to 1, arguing that if it is lower, one word terms are located too low on the ranking list
(it cannot be greater than 1 for obvious reasons). Our experiments proved that in our data, such a change
results in very many one word elements at the top of the list, we used a 0.1 value as the equivalent of
logarithm of length for one word phrases.

The results obtained using the C-value method depend on the details concerning the way in which
we distinguish different phrases, i.e., how we count r(LP). First, for inflectional languages like Polish,
a method for recognising inflected forms of a multiword phrase has to be established. In our experi-
ment, we used base form sequences for this purpose. Secondly, the way of counting contexts has to be
elaborated. For example, it should be decided, whether red blood cells and white blood cells are two
different contexts for cell or only one. For languages with more relaxed word order, like Polish, the same
phrase can appear in different orders, e.g., liczne krwinki białe ’numerous white blood cells’ or krwinki
białe liczne ’white blood cells numerous’. As the C-value coefficient is drastically different for frequent
phrases which occur in one and in two different contexts, we tried to limit the number of phrase types

Table 5: The number of correct changes for the first 2000 positions

which differ only in order or are included one in another. We discussed different methods of counting
contexts in (Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2014) and concluded there that none of the tested ranking pro-
cedures were able to filter out all semantically odd noun phrases from the top of the list of terms. The
best results we obtained taking only the nearest context of a phrase into account, i.e. the closest word to
the left or to the right of a phrase. We used the greater number of these different left and right contexts.
This solution can lower the actual number of contexts, but it prevents us from counting the same context
words placed before and after the phrase twice.

5 Results and evaluation

We applied the C-value method to two sets of term candidates. The first set contains all possible phrases
fulfilling the grammatical rules, while the second one is obtained by the method described in the previous
sections. It is worth noting that we consider contexts of nested phrases only when they are recognised
in phrases by the method. As both methods recognised different numbers of phrases,4 Table 4 gives
the comparison of their numbers. In this table, s-phrases refers to the baseline solution in which all
grammatically correct nested phrases are taken into account, npmi-phrases refers to the solution obtained
while recognising nested phrases using only NPMI value and s&nmpi-pharses is a name used for the
final solution in which both grammar rules and NPMI values are utilised. Initially, 32809 phrases were
extracted. The number of candidate phrases was significantly lower after applying NPMI selection (by
15%), but some of them were not grammatically correct. When applying both selection criteria we
obtained about 80% of the phrases (only grammatically correct) from the s-phrases set. The reduction
concerned phrases irrespective of their occurrences within texts. As to the distribution of the C-value, it
may be seen that we finally obtained much fewer phrases with a 0 C-value.

In the paper (Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2014), an evaluation of different aspects of the original C-
value method applied to the same domain corpus is given. In this paper, we want to verify the tendencies

method based on all valid phrases.

of changes introduced by the proposed method. To focus on this task, we analysed all phrases that were
included in the top 2000 positions ranked by the first method and whose position was moved below
the 3000 in the final list, see Table 5. This comparison shows that our solution removed 6.6% (132) of
phrases from the top of the list of terms, and 73.5% (97) among them were semantically odd phrases.
We compared the baseline with the version in which, the minimum of NPMI value was always used to
indicate phrase division (s&nmpi1) and with the final version, in which the division into two noun phrases
was preferred (i.e. if the NPMI at the division position was not significantly higher than the minimum
inside phrase). In the first case, we observed the elimination of only 39 phrases from the top 2000.
From these sequences, 9 were incorrectly removed from the candidates list. Using both NPMI value and
grammaticality test resulted in 137 changes inside the top 2000. This time, from 28 removed elements
only 2 could be considered correct. In the final solution, all 27 phrases eliminated form the first 2000
were correctly eliminated, while from the remaining 105 phrases, whose positions were significantly
lowered, 70 were not terms. For some phrases it is difficult to judge whether they are domain related
phrases or are rather related to other topics. These cases were labelled as “questionable” in the table.

As the proposed method does not change the way of counting whole phrases recognised in the corpus,
we cannot expect that every incorrect phrase will be eliminated. For example, the phrase infekcja górnych
dróg ‘infection (of the) upper tract’ cannot disappear from our list of term candidates, as it occurred three
times as a whole phrase due to a spelling error in the word oddechowy ‘respiratory’. We only expect that
its position is similar to the position of this phrase ranked according to the frequency of the whole phrase.
We obtained this required effect. The semantically odd phrase, considered above, changed its position
from 144 to 4374.

The presented results show that integrating NPMI with syntactic rules resulted both in better selection
and ranking of candidates. The final decision to prefer division into two noun phrases had rather small
but positive effects.

6 Conclusion

In the paper, we described a method for recognising nested phrases based on normalised pointwise mutual
information. We proved that the method has a strong tendency not to recognise semantically odd phrases
once they are nested, and allows for the elimination of incorrect unfinished phrases from the top part of
the ranking list. The method can be applied to any language: it requires the existence of a POS tagger and
several rules describing noun phrase structure. Taking into account information on the internal syntactic
structure of terms improved the results.

There are several possible directions for further research. First, we plan to test the method on different
datasets. Then, some extensions of the method are planned. The potentially easiest one concerns the
problem of how to extend the method to take into account more complex phrases (i.e. prepositional
phrases and coordinated phrases) and count NPMI effectively for them. The second problem refers to
longer phrases that are strongly connected but only when all elements appear together. An example of
such a phrase is wykładnik stanu zapalnego ‘inflammation exponent’ where stan zapalny ‘inflammation’
can appear in different contexts, but wykładnik stanu ‘exponent (of the) state’ implies the word zapalny
‘inflammatory’. The third problem is to explore whether the proposed method provides a good starting
point for recognising pieces of information that should be represented in a domain ontology.
