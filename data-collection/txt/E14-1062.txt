Abstract

We report an empirical investigation on
type-supervised domain adaptation for
joint Chinese word segmentation and
POS-tagging, making use of domain-
specific tag dictionaries and only un-
labeled target domain data to improve
target-domain accuracies, given a set of
annotated source domain sentences. Pre-
vious work on POS-tagging of other lan-
guages showed that type-supervision can
be a competitive alternative to token-
supervision, while semi-supervised tech-
niques such as label propagation are
important to the effectiveness of type-
supervision. We report similar findings
using a novel approach for joint Chinese
segmentation and POS-tagging, under a
cross-domain setting. With the help of un-
labeled sentences and a lexicon of 3,000
words, we obtain 33% error reduction in
target-domain tagging. In addition, com-
bined type- and token-supervision can lead
to improved cost-effectiveness.

1 Introduction

With accuracies of over 97%, POS-tagging of
WSJ can be treated as a solved problem (Man-
ning, 2011). However, performance is still well
below satisfactory for many other languages and
domains (Petrov et al., 2012; Christodoulopoulos
et al., 2010). There has been a line of research on
using a tag-dictionary for POS-tagging (Merialdo,
1994; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Ravi and
Knight, 2009; Garrette and Baldridge, 2012). The
idea is compelling: on the one hand, a list of lex-
icons is often available for special domains, such
as bio-informatics; on the other hand, compiling a

lexicon of word-tag pairs appears to be less time-
consuming than annotating full sentences.

However, success in type-supervised POS-
tagging turns out to depend on several subtle fac-
tors. For example, recent research has found that
the quality of the tag-dictionary is crucial to the
success of such methods (Banko and Moore, 2004;
Goldberg et al., 2008; Garrette and Baldridge,
2012). Banko and Moore (2004) found that the
accuracies can drop from 96% to 77% when a
hand-crafted tag dictionary is replaced with a raw
tag dictionary gleaned from data, without any hu-
man intervention. These facts indicate that careful
considerations need to be given for effective type-
supervision. In addition, significant manual work
might be required to ensure the quality of lexicons.

To compare type- and token-supervised tagging,
Garrette and Baldridge (2013) performed a set of
experiments by conducting each type of annota-
tion for two hours. They showed that for low-
resource languages, a tag-dictionary can be rea-
sonably effective if label propagation (Talukdar
and Crammer, 2009) and model minimizations
(Ravi and Knight, 2009) are applied to expand and
filter the lexicons. Similar findings were reported
in Garrette et al. (2013).

Do the above findings carry over to the Chi-
nese language? In this paper, we perform an
empirical study on the effects of tag-dictionaries
for domain adaptation of Chinese POS-tagging.
We aim to answer the following research ques-
tions: (a) Is domain adaptation feasible with only
a target-domain lexicon? (b) Can we further im-
prove type-supervised domain adaptation using
unlabeled target-domain sentences? (c) Is craft-
ing a tag dictionary for domain adaptation more
effective than manually annotating target domain
sentences, given similar efforts?

Our investigations are performed under two
Chinese-specific settings. First, unlike low-
resource languages, large amounts of annotation

588



are available for Chinese. For example, the Chi-
nese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) contains
over 50,000 manually tagged news sentences.
Hence rather than studying purely type-supervised
POS-tagging, we make use of CTB as the source
domain, and study domain adaptation to the Inter-
net literature.

Second, one uniqueness of Chinese POS-
tagging, in contrast to the POS-tagging of alpha-
betical languages, is that word segmentation can
be performed jointly to avoid error propagation
(Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Kru-
engkrai et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010). We
adopt this approach for a strong baseline. Previous
studies showed that unsupervised domain adap-
tation can give moderate improvements (Liu and
Zhang, 2012). We show that accuracies can be
much more significantly improved by using target-
domain knowledge in the form of lexicons.

Both token-supervised and type-supervised do-
main adaptation rely on a set of source-domain
annotations; while the former makes additional
use of a small set of target annotations, the lat-
ter leverages a target-domain lexicon. We take
a feature-based method, analogous to that of
Daume III (2007), which tunes domain-dependent
versions of features using domain-specific data.
Our method tunes a set of lexicon-based features,
so that domain-dependent models are derived from
inserting domain-specific lexicons.

The conceptually simple method worked highly
effectively on a test set of 1,394 sentences from
the Internet novel “Zhuxian”. Combined with
the use of unlabeled data, a tag lexicon of 3,000
words gave a 33% error reduction when com-
pared with a strong baseline system trained using
CTB data. We observe that joint use of type- and
token-supervised domain adaptation is more cost-
effective than pure type- or token-supervision.
With 10 hours of annotation, the best error reduc-
tion reaches 47%, with F-score increasing from
80.81% to 89.84%.

2 Baseline

We take as the baseline system a discriminative
joint segmentation and tagging model, proposed
by Zhang and Clark (2010), together with simple
self-training (Liu and Zhang, 2012). While the
baseline discriminative model gives state-of-the-
art joint segmentation and tagging accuracies on
CTB data, the baseline self-training makes use of

unlabeled target domain data to find improved tar-
get domain accuracies over bare CTB training.

2.1 The Baseline Discriminative Chinese
POS-Tagging Model

The baseline discriminative model performs
segmentation and POS-tagging simultaneously.
Given an input sentence c1 · · · cn (ci refers to the
ith character in the sentence), it operates incre-
mentally, from left to right. At each step, the cur-
rent character can either be appended to the last
word of the existing partial output, or seperated as
the start of a new word with tag p. A beam is used
to maintain the N-best partial results at each step
during decoding. At step i (0 ≤ i < n), each
item in the beam corresponds to a segmentation
and POS-tagging hypothesis for the first i−1 char-
acters, with the last word being associated with a
POS, but marked as incomplete. When the next
character ci is processed, it is combined with all
the partial results from the beam to generate new
partial results, using two types of actions: (1) Ap-
pend, which appends ci to the last (partial) word
in a partial result; (2) Separate(p), which makes
the last word in the partial result as completed and
adds ci as a new partial word with a POS tag p.

Partial results in the beam are scored globally
over all actions used to build them, so that the N-
best can be put back to the agenda for the next step.
For each action, features are extracted differently.
We use the features from Zhang and Clark (2010).
Discriminative learning with early-update (Collins
and Roark, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2011) is used
to train the model with beam-search.

2.2 Baseline Unsupervised Adaptation by
Self-Training

A simple unsupervised approach for POS-tagging
with unlabeled data is EM. For a generative model
such as HMM, EM can locally maximize the like-
lihood of training data. Given a good start, EM
can result in a competitive HMM tagging model
(Goldberg et al., 2008).

For discriminative models with source-domain
training examples, an initial model can be trained
using the source-domain data, and self-training
can be applied to find a locally-optimized model
using raw target domain sentences. The training
process is sometimes associated with the EM al-
gorithm. Liu and Zhang (2012) used perplexities
of character trigrams to order unlabeled sentences,
and applied self-training to achieve a 6.3% error

reduction on target-domain data when compared
with source domain training. Their method is sim-
ple to implement, and we take it as our baseline.

3 Type-Supervised Domain Adaptation

To give a formal definition of the domain adap-
tation tasks, we denote by Cs a set of anno-
tated source-domain sentences, Ct a set of anno-
tated target-domain sentences, and Lt an anno-
tated target-domain lexicon. The form of Lt is a
list of target-domain words, each associated with
a set of POS tags. Token-supervised domain adap-
tation is the task of making use of Cs and Ct to
improve target-domain performances, while type-
supervised domain adaptation is to make use of Cs
and Lt instead for the same purpose.

As described in the introduction, type-
supervised domain adaptation is useful when
annotated sentences are absent, but lexicons are
available. In addition, it is an interesting question
which type of annotation is more cost-effective
when neither is available. We empirically com-
pare the two approaches by proposing a novel
method for type-supervised domain adaptation of
a discriminate tagging model, showing that it can
be a favourable choice in practical situation.

In particular, we split Chinese words into
domain-independent and domain-specific cate-
gories, and define unlexicalized features for
domain-specific words. We train lexicalized
domain-independent and unlexicalized domain-
specific features using the source domain anno-
tated sentences and a source-domain lexicon, and
then apply the resulting model to the target do-
main by replacing the source-domain lexicon with
a target domain lexicon. Combined with unsu-
pervised learning with unlabeled target-domain
of sentences, the conceptually simple method
worked highly effectively. Following Garrette and
Baldridge (2013), we address practical questions

on type-supervised domain adaptation by compar-
ison with token-supervised methods under similar
human annotation efforts.

3.1 System Architecture

Our method is based on the intuition that domain-
specific words of certain types (e.g. proper names)
can behave similarly across domains. For exam-
ple, consider the source-domain sentence “江泽
民|NR (Jiang Zemin) 随后|AD (afterwards) 访
问|VV (visit) 上汽|NR (Shanghai Automobiles
Corp.)” and the target-domain sentence “碧
瑶|NR (Biyao) 随后|AD (afterwards) 来到|VV
(arrive) 大竹峰|NR (the Bamboo Mountains)”.
“江泽民 (Jiang Zemin)” and “碧瑶 (Biyao)” are
person names in the two domains, respectively,
whereas “上汽 (Shanghai Automobiles Corp.)”
and “大竹峰 (the Bamboo Mountains)” are loca-
tion names in the two domains, respectively. If the
four words are simply treated as domain-specific
nouns, the two sentences both have the pattern
“〈domain-NR〉 AD VV 〈domain-NR〉”, and hence
source domain training data can be useful in train-
ing the distributions of the lexicon-based features
for both domains.

Further, we assume that the syntax structures
and the usage of function words do not vary sig-
nificantly across domains. For example, verbs, ad-
jectives or proper nouns can be different from do-
main to domain, but the subject-verb-object sen-
tence structure does not change. In addition, the
usage of closed-set function words remains sta-
ble across different domains. In the CTB tagset,
closed-set POS tags are the vast majority. Under
this assumption, we introduce a set of unlexical-
ized features into the discriminative model, in or-
der to capture the distributions of domain-specific
dictionary words. Unlexicalized features trained
for source domain words can carry over to the tar-
get domain. The overall architecture of our sys-

supervised model, where w−1 and t−1 denote the

(w, t) is in the lexicon.

tem is shown in Figure 1, where lexicons can be
treated as “plugins” to the model for different do-
mains, and one model trained from the source do-
main can be applied to many different target do-
mains, as long as a lexicon is available.

The method can be the most effective
when there is a significant amount of domain-
independent words in the data, which provide rich
lexicalized contexts for estimating unlexicalized
features for domain-specific words. For scientific
domains (e.g. the biomedical domain) which
share a significant proportion of common words
with the news domain, and have most domain
specific words being nouns (e.g. “糖尿病 (dia-
betes)”), the method can be the most effective.
We choose a comparatively difficult domain pair
(e.g. modern news v.s. ancient style novel),
for which the use of many word types are quite
different. Results on this data can be relatively
more indicative of the usefulness of the method.

3.2 Lexicon-Based Features

Table 1 shows the set of new unlexicalized fea-
tures for the domain-specific lexicons. In addition
to words and POS tags, length information is also
encoded in the features, to capture different dis-
tributions of different word sizes. For example,
a one-character word in the dictionary might not
be identified as confidently using the lexicon as a
three-character word in the dictionary.

To acquire a domain-specific lexicon for the
source domain, we use HowNet (Dong and
Dong, 2006) to classify CTB words into domain-
independent and domain-specific categories. Con-
sisting of semantic information for nearly 100,000
common Chinese words, HowNet can serve as a
resource of domain-independent Chinese words.
We choose out of all words in the source domain
training data those that also occur in HowNet for
domain-independent words, and out of the remain-

ing words those that occur more than 3 times for
words specific to the source domain. We assume
that the domain-independent lexicon applies to all
target domains also. For some target domains,
we can obtain domain-specific terminologies eas-
ily from the Internet. However, this can be a very
small portion depending on the domain. Thus, it
may still be necessary to obtain new lexicons by
manual annotation.

3.3 Lexicon and Self-Training

The lexicon-based features can be combined with
unsupervised learning to further improve target-
domain accuracies. We apply self-training on top
of the lexicon-based features in the following way:
we train a lexicon-based model M using a lexi-
con Ls of the source domain, and then apply M
together with a target-domain lexicon Lt to auto-
matically label a set of target domain sentences.
We combine the automatically labeled target sen-
tences with the source-domain training data to ob-
tain an extended set of training data, and train a
final model Mself, using the lexicon Ls and Lt for
source- and target-domain data, respectively.

Different numbers of target domain sentences
can be used for self-training. Liu and Zhang
(2012) showed that an increased amount of tar-
get sentences do not constantly lead to improved
development accuracies. They use character per-
plexity to order target domain sentences, taking
the top K sentences for self-training. They eval-
uate the optimal development accuracies using a
range of different Kvalues, and select the best K
for a final model. This method gave better results
than using sentences in the internet novel in their
original order (Liu and Zhang, 2012). We follow
this method in ranking target domain sentences.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setting

We use annotated sentences from the CTB5 for
source-domain training, splitting the corpus into
training, development and test sections in the same
way as previous work (Kruengkrai et al., 2009;
Zhang and Clark, 2010; Sun, 2011).

Following Liu and Zhang (2012), we use the
free Internet novel “Zhuxian” (henceforth referred
to as ZX; also known as “Jade dynasty”) as our tar-
get domain data. The writing style of the novel is
in the literature genre, with the style of Ming and
Qing novels, very different from news in CTB. Ex-

ample sentences from the two corpora are shown
in Table 2. Liu and Zhang (2012) manually anno-
tated 385 sentences as development and test data,
which we download from their website.1 These
data follow the same annotation guidelines as the
Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2000).

To gain more reliable statistics in our results,
we extend their annotation work to a total 4,555
sentences, covering the sections 6, 7 and 19 of the
novel. The annotation work is based on the auto-
matically labeled sentences by our baseline model
trained with CTB5 corpus. It took an experienced
native speaker 80 hours, about one minute on av-
erage to annotate one sentence. We use chapters
1-5 of section 6 as the development data, chap-
ters 1-5 of section 7 as the test data, and the re-
maining data for target-domain training,2 in order
to compare type-supervised methods with token-
supervised methods. Under permission from the
author of the novel, we release our annotation for
future reference. Statistics of both the source and
the target domain data are shown in Table 3. The
rest of the novel is treated as unlabeled sentences,
used for type-annotation and self-training.

We perform the standard evaluation, using F-
scores for both the segmentation accuracy and the

ments, and the remaining can be used for further research.

overall segmentation and POS tagging accuracy.

4.2 Baseline Performances
The baseline discriminative model can achieve
state-of-the-art performances on the CTB5, with
a 97.62% segmentation accuracy and a 93.85% on
overall segmentation and tagging accuracy. Using
the CTB model, the performance on ZX drops sig-
nificantly, to a 87.71% segmentation accuracy and
a 80.81% overall accuracy. Applying self-training,
the segmentation and overall F-scores can be im-
proved to 88.62% and 81.94% respectively.

4.3 Development Experiments
In this section, we study type-supervised domain
adaptation by conducting a series of experiments
on the development data, addressing the follow-
ing questions. First, what is the influence of tag-
dictionaries through lexicon-based features? Sec-
ond, what is the effect of type-supervised domain
adaptation in contrast to token-supervised domain
adaptation under the same annotation cost? Third,
what is the interaction between tag-dictionary and
self-training? Finally, what is the combined effect
of type- and token-supervised domain adaptation?

4.3.1 The Influence of The Tag Dictionary
We investigate the effects of two different tag dic-
tionaries. The first dictionary contains names of
characters (e.g. 鬼厉 (Guili)) and artifacts (e.g.
swords such as斩龙 (Dragonslayer)) in the novel,
which are obtained from an Internet Encyclope-
dia,3 and requires little human effort. We ex-
tracted 159 words from this page, verified them,
and put them into a tag dictionary. We associate
every word in this tag dictionary with the POS
“NR (proper noun)”, and name the lexicon by NR.

The second dictionary was constructed man-
ually, by first employing our baseline tagger to
tag the unlabeled ZX sentences automatically,

and then randomly selecting the words that are
not domain-independent for an experienced native
speaker to annotate. To facilitate comparison with
token-supervision, we spent about 5 person hours
in annotating 3,000 word-tag pairs, at about the
same cost as annotating 300 sentences. Finally we
conjoined the 3,000 word-tag pairs with the NR
lexicon, and name the resulting lexicon by 3K.

For the target domain, we mark the words from
both NR and 3K as the domain-specific lexicons.
In all experiments, we use the same domain-
independent lexicon, which is extracted from the
source domain training data by HowNet matching.

The accuracies are shown in Table 4, where
the NR lexicon improved the overall F-score
slightly over the baseline, and the larger lexicon
3K brought more significant improvements. These
experiments agree with the intuition that the size
and the coverage of the tag dictionary is impor-
tant to the accuracies. To understand the extent to
which a lexicon can improve the accuracies, we
perform an oracle test, in which lexicons in the
gold-standard test outputs are included in the dic-
tionary. The accuracy is 88.87%.

4.3.2 Comparing Type-Supervised and
Token-Supervised Domain Adaptation

Table 4 shows that the accuracy improvement by
3,000 annotated word-tag pairs (86.53%) is close
to that by 300 annotated sentences (86.86%). This
suggest that using our method, type-supervised
domain adaptation can be a competitive choice to
the token-supervised methods.

The fact that the token-supervised model gives
slightly better results than our type-annotation
method under similar efforts can probably be ex-

plained by the nature of domain differences. Texts
in the Internet novel are different with CTB news
in not only the vocabulary, but also POS n-gram
distributions. The latter cannot be transferred from
the source-domain training data directly. Texts
from domains such as modern-style novels and
scientific articles might have more similar POS
distributions to the CTB data, and can potentially
benefit more from pure lexicons. We leave the ver-
ification of this intuition to future work.

4.3.3 Making Use of Unlabeled Sentences
Both type- and token-supervised domain adapta-
tion methods can be further improved via unla-
beled target sentences. We apply self-training to
both methods, and find improved results across the
board in Table 4. The results indicate that unla-
beled data is useful in further improving both type-
and token-supervised domain adaptation.

593



Interestingly, the effects of the two methods
on self-training are slightly different. The er-
ror reduction by self-training improves from 6.0%
(baseline) to averaged 7.3% and 8.6% for token-
and type-supervised adaptation, respectively. The
better effect for the type-supervised method may
result from comparatively more uniform cover-
age of the lexicon on sentences, since the target-
domain lexicon is annotated by selecting words
from much more than 300 sentences.

4.3.4 Combined Model of Type- and
Token-Supervision

Figure 2 shows the F-scores of each development
test sentence by type- and token-supervised do-
main adaptation with 5 person hours, respectively.
It indicates that the two methods make different
types of errors, and can potentially be used jointly
for better improvements. We conduct a set of ex-
periments as shown in Table 4, finding that the
combined type- and token-supervised model with
lexicon 3K and 300 labeled sentences achieves
an overall accuracy of 88.54%, exceeding the ac-
curacies of both the type-supervised model with
lexicon 3K and the token-supervised model with
300 labeled sentences. Similar observation can
be found for the combined model with lexicon 3K
and 600 labeled sentences. If combined with self-
training, the same fact can be observed.

More interestingly, the combined model also
exceeds pure type- and token-supervised mod-
els with the same annotation cost. For exam-
ple, the combined model with 3K and 300 la-
beled sentences gives a better accuracy than the
token-supervised model with 600 sentences, with
or without self-training. Similar observations hold
between the combined model with 3K and 600 la-
beled sentences and the token-supervised model
with 900 sentences. The results suggest that the
most cost-effective approach for domain adapta-
tion can be combined type- and token-supervision:
after annotating a set of raw sentences, one could
stop to annotate some words, rather than continu-
ing sentence annotation.

4.4 Final Results

Table 5 shows the final results on test corpus
within ten person hours’ annotation. With five per-
son hours (lexicon 3K), the type-supervised model
gave an error reduction of 32.99% compared with
the baseline. The best result was obtained by the
combined type- and token-supervised model, with

an error reduction of 47.06%, higher than that the
token-supervised model with the same cost under
the same setting (the model of 600 labeled sen-
tences with an error reduction of 41.53%). The
results confirm that the type-supervised model
is a competitive alternative for joint segmenta-
tion and POS-tagging under the cross-domain set-
ting. Combined type- and token-supervised model
yields better results than single models.

5 Related Work

As mentioned in the introduction, tag dictionaries
have been applied to type-supervised POS tagging
of English (Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Gold-
water and Griffiths, 2007; Ravi and Knight, 2009;
Garrette and Baldridge, 2012), Hebrew (Goldberg
et al., 2008), Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (Gar-
rette and Baldridge, 2013; Garrette et al., 2013),
and other languages (Täckström et al., 2013).
These methods assume that lexicon can be ob-
tained by manual annotation or semi-supervised
learning, and use the lexicon to induce tag se-
quences on unlabeled sentences. We study type-
supervised Chinese POS-tagging, but under the
setting of domain adaptation. The problem is
how to leverage a target domain lexicon and an
available annotated resources in a different source
domain to improving POS-tagging. Consistent

with Garrette et al. (2013), we also find that the
type-supervised method is a competitive choice to
token-supervised adaptation.

There has been a line of work on using graph-
based label propagation to expand tag-lexicons for
POS-tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and
Petrov, 2011). Similar methods have been ap-
plied to character-level Chinese tagging (Zeng et
al., 2013). We found that label propagation from
neither the source domain nor auto-labeled target
domain sentences can improve domain adaptation.
The main reason could be significant domain dif-
ferences. Due to space limitations, we omit this
negative result in our experiments.

With respect to domain adaptation, existing
methods can be classified into three categories.
The first category does not explicitly model dif-
ferences between the source and target domains,
but use standard semi-supervised learning meth-
ods with labeled source domain data and unla-
beled target domain data (Dai et al., 2007; Raina
et al., 2007). The baseline self-training ap-
proach (Liu and Zhang, 2012) belongs to this cat-
egory. The second considers the differences in the
two domains in terms of features (Blitzer et al.,
2006; Daume III, 2007), classifying features into
domain-independent source domain and target do-
main groups and training these types consistently.
The third considers differences between the dis-
tributions of instances in the two domains, treat-
ing them differently (Jiang and Zhai, 2007). Our
type-supervised method is closer to the second cat-
egory. However, rather than splitting features into
domain-independent and domain-specific types,
we use domain-specific dictionaries to capture do-
main differences, and train a model on the source
domain only. Our method can be treated as an ap-
proach specific to the POS-tagging task.

With respect to Chinese lexical analysis, lit-
tle previous work has been reported on using a
tag dictionary to improve joint segmentation and
POS-tagging. There has been work on using a
lexicon in improving segmentation in a Chinese
analysis pipeline. Peng et al. (2004) used fea-
tures from a set of Chinese words and characters
to improve CRF-based segmentation; Low et al.
(2005) extracted features based on a Chinese lex-
icon from Peking University to help a maximum
segmentor; Sun (2011) collected 12,992 idioms
from Chinese dictionaries, and used them for rule-
based pre-segmentation; Hatori et al. (2012) col-

lected Chinese words from HowNet and the Chi-
nese Wikipedia to enhance segmentation accura-
cies of their joint dependency parsing systems. In
comparison with their work, our lexicon contain
additional POS information, and are used for word
segmentation and POS-tagging simultaneously. In
addition, we separate domain-dependent lexicons
for the source and target lexicons, and use a novel
framework to perform domain adaptation.

Wang et al. (2011) collect word-tag statistics
from automatically labeled texts, and use them as
features to improve POS-tagging. Their word-tag
statistics can be treated as a type of lexicon. How-
ever, their efforts differ from ours in several as-
pects: (1) they focus on in-domain POS-tagging,
while our concern is cross-domain tagging; (2)
they study POS-tagging on segmented sentences,
while we investigate joint segmentation and POS-
tagging for Chinese; (3) their tag-dictionaries are
not tag-dictionaries literally, but statistics of word-
tag associations.

6 Conclusions

We performed an empirical study on the use of
tag-dictionaries for the domain adaptation of joint
Chinese segmentation and POS-tagging, showing
that type-supervised methods can be a compet-
itive alternative to token-supervised methods
in cost-effectiveness. In addition, combination
of the two methods gives the best cost-effect.
Finally, we release our annotation of over 4,000
sentences in the Internet literature domain on-
line at http://faculty.sutd.edu.sg/
˜yue_zhang/eacl14meishan.zip as a
free resource for Chinese POS-tagging.
