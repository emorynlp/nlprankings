Abstract

We  present  in  this  paper  the  systems  we 
participated  with  in  the  Semantic  Textual 
Similarity  task  at  SEM  2013.  The  Semantic 
Textual Similarity Core task  (STS)  computes the 
degree  of  semantic  equivalence  between  two 
sentences  where  the  participant  systems  will  be 
compared to the manual scores, which range from 
5  (semantic  equivalence)  to  0  (no  relation).  We 
combined  multiple  text  similarity  measures  of 
varying complexity.  The experiments illustrate the 
different  effect  of  four  feature  types  including 
direct  lexical  matching,  idf-weighted  lexical 
matching,  modified BLEU N-gram matching and 
named entities matching. Our team submitted three 
runs  during  the  task  evaluation  period  and  they 
ranked  number  11,  15  and  19  among  the  90 
participating  systems  according  to  the  official 
Mean Pearson correlation metric for the task. We 
also  report  an  unofficial  run  with  mean  Pearson 
correlation  of  0.59221  on  STS2013  test  dataset, 
ranking  as  the  3rd  best  system  among  the  90 
participating systems.

1 Introduction

The  Semantic  Textual  Similarity  (STS)  task  at 
SEM 2013 is  to measure  the degree of semantic 
equivalence between pairs of sentences as a graded 
notion  of  similarity.  Text  Similarity  is  very 
important  to  many  Natural  Language  Processing 
applications, like extractive summarization (Salton 
et al., 1997), methods for automatic evaluation of 
machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002), as well 
as  text  summarization  (Lin  and  Hovy,  2003).  In 
Text  Coherence  Detection  (Lapata  and  Barzilay, 

2005), sentences are linked together by similar or 
related  words.  For  Word  Sense  Disambiguation, 
researchers  (Banerjee  and  Pedersen,  2003;  Guo 
and  Diab,  2012a)  introduced  a  sense  similarity 
measure using the sentence similarity of the sense 
definitions. In this paper we illustrate the different 
effect of four feature types including direct lexical 
matching, idf-weighted lexical matching, modified 
BLEU  N-gram  matching  and  named  entities 
matching.  The rest  of  this  paper  will  proceed as 
follows, Section 2 describes the four text similarity 
features  used.  Section  3  illustrates  the  system 
description,  data  resources  as  well  as  Feature 
combination.  Experiments  and  Results  are 
illustrated  in  section  4.  then  we  report  our 
conclusion and future work. 

2 Text Similarity Features

Our  system  measures  the  semantic  textual 
similarity between two sentences through a number 
of matching features which should cover four main 
dimensions: i) Lexical Matching ii)  IDF-weighted 
Lexical  Matching  iii)  Contextual  sequence 
Matching (Modified BLEU Score), and iv) Named 
Entities Matching.

First we introduce the alignment technique used. 
For a sentence pair {s1, s2} matching is done in 
each direction separately to detect the sub-sentence 
of  s1  matched  to  s2  and  then  detect  the  sub-
sentence of s2 matched to s1. For each word wi in 
s1 we search for its match  wj in s2 according to 
matching features.

S1: w0 w1 w2 w3 w4 …... wi …... wn
S2: w0 w1 w2 w3 w4 ….......wj …......... wm

2.1 Lexical Matching:

In this feature we handle the two sentences as bags 
of  words  to  be  matched  using  three  types  of 
matching, given that all stop words are cleaned out 
before matching:
I) Exact word matching.
II) Stemmed word matching: I used Porter 

Stemming algorithm (M.F. Porter, 1980) in 
matching, where  it is a process for removing 
the commoner morphological and inflectional 
endings from words in English. Stemming 
will render inflections like “requires, required, 
requirements, ...” to “requir” so they can be 
easily matched

III) Synonyms matching: we used a corpus based 
dictionary of 58,921 entries and their 
equivalent synonyms. The next section 
describes how we automatically generated this 
language resource. 

2.2 IDF-weighted Lexical Matching

We used the three matching criteria used in 
Lexical Matching after weighting them with 
Inverse-Document-Frequency. we applied the 
aggregation strategy by Mihalcea et al. (2006): The 
sum of the idf-weighted similarity scores of each 
word with the best-matching counterpart in the 
other text is computed in both directions. For a 
sentence pair s1, s2, if s1 consists of m words {w0, 
w1, …., w(m-1)} and s2 consists of n words {w0, 
w1, …., w(n-1)} ,after cleaning stop words from 
both, and the matched words are 
“@Matched_word_List” of “k” words, then 

2.3 Contextual Sequence Matching (Modified 
BLEU score)

We used a modified version of Bleu score to 
measure n-gram sequences matching, where for 
sentence pair s1, s2 we align the matched words 
between them (through exact, stem, synonyms 
match respectively). Bleu score as presented by (K. 
Papineni et al., 2002) is an automated method for 
evaluating Machine Translation. It compares n-
grams of the candidate translation with the n-grams 
of the reference human translation and counts the 
number of matches. These matches are position 
independent, where candidate translations with 
unmatched length to reference translations are 
penalized with Sentence brevity penalty. 
This helps in measuring n-gram similarity in 
sentences structure. We define “matched 
sequence” of a sentence S1 as the sequence of 
words {wi, wi+1, wi+2, ….. wj}, where wi, and wj 
are the first and last words in sentence S1 that are 
matched with words in S2.
For example in sentence pair S1, S2:
S1: Today's great Pax Europa and today's pan-
European prosperity depend on this.
S2: Large Pax Europa of today, just like current 
prosperity paneuropéenne, depends on it.
After stemming:
S1: todai's great pax europa and todai's pan-
european prosper depend on thi.
S2: larg pax europa of todai, just like current 
prosper paneuropéenn, depend on it.

“Matched sequence of S1”:
[todai 's great pax europa todai 's pan - european 
prosper depend]
“Matched sequence of S2”:
[pax europa todai just like current prosper 
paneuropéenn depend]

We measure the Bleu score such that:
Bleu{S1, S2} = &BLEU(S1_stemmed,"Matched 
sequence of S2");
Bleu{S2, S1} = &BLEU(S2_stemmed,"Matched 
sequence of S1");
The objective of trimming the excess words 
outside the “Matched Sequence” range, before 
matching is to make use of the  Sentence brevity  
penalty in case sentence pair S1, S2 may be not 
similar but having matched lengths.

2.4 Named Entities Matching

Named entities carry an important portion of 
sentence semantics. For example:
Sentence1: In Nigeria , Chevron has been accused 
by the All - Ijaw indigenous people of instigating 
violence against them and actually paying 
Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri 
naval base .
Sentence2: In Nigeria , the whole ijaw indigenous 
showed Chevron to encourage the violence 
against them and of up to pay Nigerian soldiers to 
shoot the demonstrators at the naval base from 
Warri .
The underlined words are Named entities of 
different types “COUNTRY, ORG, PEOPLE, 
LOC, EVENT_VIOLENCE” which capture 
the most important information in each 
sentence. Thus named entities matching is a 
measure of semantic matching between the 
sentence pair.

3 System Description

3.1 Data Resources and Processing 

All  data  is  tokenized,  stemmed,  and  stop 
words are cleaned.

Corpus based resources:
i. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) 

language resource: The  document frequency 
df(t) of a term t is defined as the number of 
documents in a large collection of documents 
that contain a term “t”. Terms that are likely 
to appear in most of the corpus documents 
reflect less importance than words that appear 
in specific documents only. That's why the 
Inverse Document Frequency is used as a 
measure of term importance in information 
retrieval and text mining tasks. We used the 
LDC English Gigaword Fifth Edition 
(LDC2011T07) to generate our idf dictionary. 
LDC Gigaword contains a huge collection of 
newswire from (afp, apw, cna, ltw, nyt, wpb, 
and xin). The generated idf resource contains 
5,043,905 unique lower cased entries, and 
then we generated a stemmed version of the 
idf dictionary contains 4,677,125 entries. The 

equation below represents the idf of term t 
where N is the total number of documents in 
the  corpus.

ii. English  Synonyms  Dictionary:  Using  the 
Phrase  table  of  an  Arabic-to-English  Direct 
Translation Model,  we generated English-to-
English phrase table using the double-link of 
English-to-Arabic  and  Arabic-to-English 
phrase translation probabilities over all pivot 
Arabic  phrases.  Then  English-to-English 
translation  probabilities  are  normalized  over 
all  generated  English  synonyms.  (Chris 
Callison-Burch  et  al,  2006) used  a  similar 
technique to generate paraphrases to improve 
their SMT system. Figure (1) shows the steps:

Figure(1) English phrase-to-phrase synonyms 
generation from E2A phrase table.

In our system we used the phrase table of the 
Direct Translation Model 2 (DTM2) (Ittycheriah 
and Roukos, 2007) SMT system, where each 
sentence pair in the training corpus was word-
aligned, e.g. using a MaxEnt aligner (Ittycheriah 
and Roukos, 2005) or an HMM aligner (Ge, 2004). 
then Block Extraction step is done. The generated 
phrase table contains candidate phrase to phrase 
translation pairs with source-to-target and target-to 
source translation probabilities. However the open 
source Moses SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) 

For each English Phrase “e1”
 {
    @ar_phrases = list of Arabic Phrases aligned to “e”   
    in the phrase table;
    For each a (@ar_phrases)
     {

@en_phrases = list of English phrases aligned 
to “a” in the phrase table;

For each e2 (@en_phrases)
{
    $Prob(e2\e1) = Prob(a\e1)*Prob(e2\a);
}

     }
 }

189



can be used in the same way to generate a 
synonyms dictionary from phrase table.

By applying the steps in figure (1):
a) English phrase-to-phrase synonyms table (or 
English-to-English phrase table), by applying the 
steps in a generic way.
b) English word-to-word synonyms table, by 
limiting the generation over English single word 
phrases. 
For example, to get all possible synonyms of the 
English word “bike”, we used all the Arabic 
phrases that are aligned to “bike” in the phrase 
table { البسكليت, البسكلت, الدراجات , دراجة  }, 
P: 1905645 14 0.0142582 0.170507 |  دراجة | bike |   
P: 1910841 25 0.0262152 0.221198 |  الدراجات  | bike | 
P: 2127826 4 0.0818182 0.0414747 |  البسكليت | bike |
P: 2396796 2 0.375 0.0138249 |  البسكلت | bike |
then we get all the English words in the phrase 
table aligned to these Arabic translations { ,دراجة  

البسكليت, البسكلت, الدراجات   }
This results in an English word-to-word synonyms 
list for the word “bike” like this:

bike:
motorcycle      0.365253185010659
bicycle 0.198195663512781
cycling 0.143290354808692
motorcycles     0.0871686646772204
bicycles        0.0480779974950311
cyclists        0.0317670845504069
motorcyclists   0.0304152910853553
cyclist 0.0278451740161998
riding  0.0215366691148431
motorbikes      0.0148697281155676

Dictionary based resources:
• WordNet (Miller, 1995): is a large lexical 

database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives 
and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive 
synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct 
concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of 
conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. 
WordNet groups words together based on 
their meanings and interlinks not just word 
forms—strings of letters—but specific senses 
of words. As a result, words that are found in 
close proximity to one another in the network 
are semantically disambiguated. Second, 
WordNet labels the semantic relations among 
words.  Using WordNet, we can measure the 
semantic similarity or relatedness between a 

pair of concepts (or word senses), and by 
extension, between a pair of sentences. We 
use the similarity measure described in (Wu 
and Palmer, 1994) which finds the path length 
to the root node from the least common 
subsumer (LCS) of the two word senses which 
is the most specific word sense they share as 
an ancestor.

3.2 Feature Combination

The feature combination step uses the pre-
computed  similarity  scores.  Each  of  the 
text  similarity  features  can  be  given  a 
weight  that  sets  its  importance. 
Mathematically,  the  text  similarity  score 
between two sentences can be formulated 
using  a  cost  function  weighting  the 
similarity  features  as  follows:  N.B.:  The 
similarity score according to the features 
above is considered as a directional score.

Similarity(s1, s2) = [w1*Lexical_Score(s1, s2) +     
               w2*IDF_Lexical_Score(s1, s2) +
               w3*Modified_BLEU(s1, s2) +
               w4*NE_Score(s1, s2)] / (w1+w2+w3+w4)

Similarity(s2, s1) = [w1*Lexical_Score(s2, s1) +     
w2*IDF_Lexical_Score(s2, s1) +
w3*Modified_BLEU(s2, s1) +

                w4*NE_Score(s2, s1)] / (w1+w2+w3+w4)
Overall_Score = 5/2*[Similarity(s1, s2)+Similarity(s2, s1)]

where w1, w2, w3, w4 are the weights assigned to 
the similarity features (lexical, idf-weighted, 
modified_BLEU, and NE_Match features 
respectively).  The similarity score will be 
normalized over (w1+w2+w3+w4).
In our experiments, the weights are tuned manually 
without applying machine learning techniques. We 
used both *SEM 2012 training and testing data sets 
for tuning these weights to get the best feature 
weighting combination to get highest Pearson 
Correlation score. 

4 Experiments and Results

Submitted Runs
Our experiments showed that some features are 
more dominant in affecting the similarity scoring 
than others. We performed a separate experiment 
for each of the four feature types to illustrate their 
effect on textual semantic similarity measurement 

190



using direct lexical matching, stemming matching, 
synonyms matching,  as well as (stem+synonyms) 
matching. Table (1) reports the mean Pearson

Table (1) reports the mean Pearson score for NE, 
BLEU, Lexical, and idf-weighted matching features 
respectively on STS2012-test dataset.

The submitted runs IBM_EG-run2, IBM_EG-run5, 
IBM_EG-run6 are the three runs with feature 
weighting and experiment set up that performed 
best on STS 2012 training and testing data sets.

Run 2: In this run the word matching was done on 
exact, and synonyms match only. Stemmed word 
matching was not introduced in this experiment. 
we tried the following weighting  between 
similarity feature scores, where we decreased the 
weight of BLEU scoring feature to  0.5, and 
increased the idf_Lexical match weight of 3.5. this 
is because our initial tuning experiments showed 
that increasing the idf lexical weight compared to 
BLEU weight gives improved results. The NE 
matching feature weight was as follows:

NE_weight = 1.5* percent of NE word to sentence word count
                   = 1.5* (NE_words_count/Sentence_word_count)

Run 5: In this experiment we introduced Porter 
stemming word matching, as well as stemmed 
synonyms matching (after generating a stemmed 
version of the synonyms dictionary). BLEU score 
feature was removed from this experiment, while 
keeping the idf-weight= 3, lexical-weight = 1, and 
NE-matching feature weight = 1.

Run 6: For this run we kept only IDF-weighted 
lexical matching feature which proved to be the 
dominant feature in the previous runs, in addition 
to Porter stemming word matching, and stemmed 
synonyms matching.

Data:  the training data of STS 2013 Core task 
consist of the STS 2012 train and test data. This 
data covers 5 datasets: paraphrase sentence pairs 
(MSRpar), sentence pairs from video descriptions 
(MSRvid), MT evaluation sentence pairs 
(SMTnews and SMTeuroparl) and gloss pairs 
(OnWN). 

Results on Training Data
System outputs will be evaluated according to the 
official scorer  which computes weighted Mean 
Pearson Correlation across the evaluation datasets, 
where the weight depends on the number of pairs 
in each dataset.

Results on Test Data:

The  best  configuration  of  our  system  was 
IBM_EG-run6 which  was  ranked  #11  for  the 
evaluation metric Mean  (r  =  0.5502)  when 
submitted during the task evaluation period . Run6 
as illustrated before was planned to measure idf-
weighted lexical matching feature only, over Porter 
stemmed,  and  stemmed  synonyms  words. 
However when  revising  this  experiment  set  up 

191



during  preparing  the  paper,  after  the  evaluation 
period,  we  found  that  the  English-to-English 
synonyms  table  was  not  correctly  loaded  during 
matching,  thus  skipping  synonyms  matching 
feature  from  this  run.  So  the  official  result 
IBM_EG-run6 reports  only  idf-weighted 
matching over Porter stemmed bag of words. By 
fixing  this  and  replicating  the  experiment 
IBM_EG-run6-UnOfficial  as  planned to  be,  the 
mean  Pearson  correlation  jumps  4  points  (r  = 
0.59221)  which  ranks  this  system  as  the  3rd 
system  among  90  submitted  systems  very 
slightly  below  the  2nd system  (only  0.0006 
difference on the mean correlation metric).  In 
table (4), we report the official results achieved on 
STS 2013 test data.  While  table (5),  reports the

5 Conclusion

We  proposed  an  unsupervised  approach  for 
measuring  semantic  textual  similarity  based  on 
Lexical  matching  features  (with porter  stemming 
matching  and  synonyms  matching),  idf-Lexical 
matching  features,  Ngram  Frquency  (Modified 
BLEU)  matching  feature,  as  well  as  Named 
Entities matching feature combined together with a 
weighted cost  function.  Our experiments  proved 
that idf-weighted Lexical matching in addition to 
porter stemming and synonyms-matching features 
perform best on most released evaluation datasets. 
Our  best  system  officially  ranked  number  11 
among 90 participating system reporting a Pearson 
Mean  correlation  score  of  0.5502.  However  our 
best  experimental  set  up  “idf-weighted  Lexical 
matching  in  addition  to  porter  stemming  and 
synonyms-matching” reported in an unofficial run 
a mean correlation score of  0.59221 which ranks 
the system as number 3 among the 90 participating 
systems. In our future work we intend to try some 
machine  learning  algorithms  (like  AdaBoost  for 

192



example)  for  weighting  our  similarity  matching 
feature scores. Also we plan to extend the usage of 
synonyms matching from the word level to the n-
gram  phrase  matching  level,  by  modifying  the 
BLEU Score N-gram matching function to handle 
synonym phrases matching.
