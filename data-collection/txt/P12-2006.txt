Abstract

In this work we present two extensions to
the well-known dynamic programming beam
search in phrase-based statistical machine
translation (SMT), aiming at increased effi-
ciency of decoding by minimizing the number
of language model computations and hypothe-
sis expansions. Our results show that language
model based pre-sorting yields a small im-
provement in translation quality and a speedup
by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are
shown to further increase translation speed by
a factor of 2 without changing the search space
and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some
additional search errors. We compare our ap-
proach with Moses and observe the same per-
formance, but a substantially better trade-off
between translation quality and speed. At a
speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses
reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach
yields 20.0% with identical models.

1 Introduction

Research efforts to increase search efficiency for
phrase-based MT (Koehn et al., 2003) have ex-
plored several directions, ranging from generalizing
the stack decoding algorithm (Ortiz et al., 2006) to
additional early pruning techniques (Delaney et al.,
2006), (Moore and Quirk, 2007) and more efficient
language model (LM) querying (Heafield, 2011).

This work extends the approach by (Zens and
Ney, 2008) with two techniques to increase trans-
lation speed and scalability. We show that taking
a heuristic LM score estimate for pre-sorting the

phrase translation candidates has a positive effect on
both translation quality and speed. Further, we intro-
duce two novel LM look-ahead methods. The idea
of LM look-ahead is to incorporate the LM proba-
bilities into the pruning process of the beam search
as early as possible. In speech recognition it has
been used for many years (Steinbiss et al., 1994;
Ortmanns et al., 1998). First-word LM look-ahead
exploits the search structure to use the LM costs of
the first word of a new phrase as a lower bound for
the full LM costs of the phrase. Phrase-only LM
look-ahead makes use of a pre-computed estimate
of the full LM costs for each phrase. We detail the
implementation of these methods and analyze their
effect with respect to the number of LM computa-
tions and hypothesis expansions as well as on trans-
lation speed and quality. We also run comparisons
with the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007), which
yields the same performance in BLEU, but is outper-
formed significantly in terms of scalability for faster
translation. Our implementation is available under
a non-commercial open source licence†.

2 Search Algorithm Extensions

We apply the decoding algorithm described in (Zens
and Ney, 2008). Hypotheses are scored by a
weighted log-linear combination of models. A beam
search strategy is used to find the best hypothesis.
During search we perform pruning controlled by the
parameters coverage histogram size‡ Nc and lexical

histogram size§ Nl .

2.1 Phrase candidate pre-sorting

In addition to the source sentence f J1 , the beam
search algorithm takes a matrix E(·, ·) as input,
where for each contiguous phrase f̃ = f j . . . f j′
within the source sentence, E( j, j′) contains a list of
all candidate translations for f̃ . The candidate lists
are sorted according to their model score, which was
observed to speed up translation by Delaney et al.
(2006). In addition to sorting according to the purely
phrase-internal scores, which is common practice,
we compute an estimate qLME(ẽ) for the LM score
of each target phrase ẽ. qLME(ẽ) is the weighted
LM score we receive by assuming ẽ to be a com-
plete sentence without using sentence start and end
markers. We limit the number of translation options
per source phrase to the No top scoring candidates
(observation histogram pruning).

The pre-sorting during phrase matching has two
effects on the search algorithm. Firstly, it defines
the order in which the hypothesis expansions take
place. As higher scoring phrases are considered first,
it is less likely that already created partial hypothe-
ses will have to be replaced, thus effectively reduc-
ing the expected number of hypothesis expansions.
Secondly, due to the observation pruning the sorting
affects the considered phrase candidates and conse-
quently the search space. A better pre-selection can
be expected to improve translation quality.

2.2 Language Model Look-Ahead

LM score computations are among the most expen-
sive in decoding. Delaney et al. (2006) report signif-
icant improvements in runtime by removing unnec-
essary LM lookups via early pruning. Here we de-
scribe an LM look-ahead technique, which is aimed
at further reducing the number of LM computations.

The innermost loop of the search algorithm iter-
ates over all translation options for a single source
phrase to consider them for expanding the current
hypothesis. We introduce an LM look-ahead score
qLMLA(ẽ|ẽ′), which is computed for each of the
translation options. This score is added to the over-
all hypothesis score, and if the pruning threshold is

§number of lexical hypotheses per coverage vector

exceeded, we discard the expansion without com-
puting the full LM score.

First-word LM look-ahead pruning defines the
LM look-ahead score qLMLA(ẽ|ẽ′) = qLM(ẽ1|ẽ′) to
be the LM score of the first word of target phrase ẽ
given history ẽ′. As qLM(ẽ1|ẽ′) is an upper bound for
the full LM score, the technique does not introduce
additional seach errors. The score can be reused, if
the LM score of the full phrase ẽ needs to be com-
puted afterwards.

We can exploit the structure of the search to speed
up the LM lookups for the first word. The LM prob-
abilities are stored in a trie, where each node cor-
responds to a specific LM history. Usually, each
LM lookup consists of first traversing the trie to find
the node corresponding to the current LM history
and then retrieving the probability for the next word.
If the n-gram is not present, we have to repeat this
procedure with the next lower-order history, until a
probability is found. However, the LM history for
the first words of all phrases within the innermost
loop of the search algorithm is identical. Just be-
fore the loop we can therefore traverse the trie once
for the current history and each of its lower order n-
grams and store the pointers to the resulting nodes.
To retrieve the LM look-ahead scores, we can then
directly access the nodes without the need to traverse
the trie again. This implementational detail was con-
firmed to increase translation speed by roughly 20%
in a short experiment.

Phrase-only LM look-ahead pruning defines the
look-ahead score qLMLA(ẽ|ẽ′) = qLME(ẽ) to be the
LM score of phrase ẽ, assuming ẽ to be the full sen-
tence. It was already used for sorting the phrases,
is therefore pre-computed and does not require ad-
ditional LM lookups. As it is not a lower bound for
the real LM score, this pruning technique can intro-
duce additional search errors. Our results show that
it radically reduces the number of LM lookups.

Results are given with (No = 100) and without (No = ∞)
observation pruning.

The English language model is a 4-gram LM
created with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) on
all bilingual and parts of the provided monolingual
data. newstest2008 is used for parameter
optimization, newstest2009 as a blind test
set. To confirm our results, we run the final set of
experiments also on the English→French task of
IWSLT 2011†. We evaluate with BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006).

We use identical phrase tables and scaling fac-
tors for Moses and our decoder. The phrase table
is pruned to a maximum of 400 target candidates per
source phrase before decoding. The phrase table and
LM are loaded into memory before translating and
loading time is eliminated for speed measurements.

3.2 Methodological analysis

To observe the effect of the proposed search al-
gorithm extensions, we ran experiments with fixed
pruning parameters, keeping track of the number of
hypothesis expansions and LM computations. The
LM score pre-sorting affects both the set of phrase
candidates due to observation histogram pruning and
the order in which they are considered. To sepa-
rate these effects, experiments were run both with
histogram pruning (No = 100) and without. From
Table 1 we can see that in terms of efficiency both
cases show similar improvements over the baseline,

which performs pre-sorting with respect to the trans-
lation model scores only. The number of hypothesis
expansions is reduced by ∼20% and the number of
LM lookups by ∼50%. When observation pruning
is applied, we additionally observe a small increase
by 0.2% in BLEU.

Application of first-word LM look-ahead further
reduces the number of LM lookups by 23%, result-
ing in doubled translation speed, part of which de-
rives from fewer trie node searches. The heuristic
phrase-only LM look-ahead method introduces ad-
ditional search errors, resulting in a BLEU drop by
0.3%, but yields another 85% reduction in LM com-
putations and increases throughput by a factor of 2.2.

3.3 Performance evaluation

In this section we evaluate the proposed extensions
to the original beam search algorithm in terms of
scalability and their usefulness for different appli-
cation constraints. We compare Moses and four dif-
ferent setups of our decoder: LM score pre-sorting
switched on or off without LM look-ahead and both
LM look-ahead methods with LM score pre-sorting.
We translated the test set with the beam sizes set to
Nc = Nl = {1,2,4,8,16,24,32,48,64}. For Moses
we used the beam sizes 2i, i ∈ {1, . . . ,9}. Transla-

Table 2: Comparison of Moses with this work. Either first-word or phrase-only LM look-ahead is applied. We consider
both the best and the fastest possible translation, as well as the fastest settings resulting in no more than 1% and 2%
BLEU loss on the development set. Results are given on the test set (newstest2009).

tion performance in BLEU is plotted against speed
in Figure 1. Without the proposed extensions, Moses
slightly outperforms our decoder in terms of BLEU.
However, the latter already scales better for higher
speed. With LM score pre-sorting, the best BLEU
value is similar to Moses while further accelerat-
ing translation, yielding identical performance at 16
words/sec as Moses at 1.8 words/sec. Application
of first-word LM look-ahead shifts the graph to the
right, now reaching the same performance at 31
words/sec. At a fixed translation speed of roughly
70 words/sec, our approach yields 20.0% BLEU,
whereas Moses reaches 17.2%. For phrase-only LM
look-ahead the graph is somewhat flatter. It yields
nearly the same top performance with an even better
trade-off between translation quality and speed.

The final set of experiments is performed on both
the WMT and the IWSLT task. We directly com-
pare our decoder with the two LM look-ahead meth-
ods with Moses in four scenarios: the best possi-
ble translation, the fastest possible translation with-
out performance constraint and the fastest possible
translation with no more than 1% and 2% loss in
BLEU on the dev set compared to the best value.
Table 2 shows that on the WMT data, the top per-
formance is similar for both decoders. However, if
we allow for a small degradation in translation per-
formance, our approaches clearly outperform Moses

in terms of translation speed. With phrase-only LM
look-ahead, our decoder is faster by a factor of 6
for no more than 1% BLEU loss, a factor of 11 for
2% BLEU loss and a factor of 22 in the fastest set-
ting. The results on the IWSLT data are very similar.
Here, the speed difference reaches a factor of 19 in
the fastest setting.

4 Conclusions

This work introduces two extensions to the well-
known beam search algorithm for phrase-based ma-
chine translation. Both pre-sorting the phrase trans-
lation candidates with an LM score estimate and LM
look-ahead during search are shown to have a pos-
itive effect on translation speed. We compare our
decoder to Moses, reaching a similar highest BLEU
score, but clearly outperforming it in terms of scal-
ability with respect to the trade-off ratio between
translation quality and speed. In our experiments,
the fastest settings of our decoder and Moses differ
in translation speed by a factor of 22 on the WMT
data and a factor of 19 on the IWSLT data. Our soft-
ware is part of the open source toolkit Jane.
