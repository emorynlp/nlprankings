Abstract

We explore the task of automatically classify-
ing dialogue acts in 1-on-1 online chat forums,
an increasingly popular means of providing
customer service. In particular, we investi-
gate the effectiveness of various features and
machine learners for this task. While a sim-
ple bag-of-words approach provides a solid
baseline, we find that adding information from
dialogue structure and inter-utterance depen-
dency provides some increase in performance;
learners that account for sequential dependen-
cies (CRFs) show the best performance. We
report our results from testing using a corpus
of chat dialogues derived from online shop-
ping customer-feedback data.

1 Introduction

Recently, live chats have received attention due to
the growing popularity of chat services and the in-
creasing body of applications. For example, large
organizations are increasingly providing support or
information services through live chat. One advan-
tage of chat-based customer service over conven-
tional telephone-based customer service is that it
becomes possible to semi-automate aspects of the
interaction (e.g. conventional openings or canned
responses to standard questions) without the cus-
tomer being aware of it taking place, something that
is not possible with speech-based dialogue systems
(as synthesised speech is still easily distinguishable
from natural speech). Potentially huge savings can
be made by organisations providing customer help
services if we can increase the degree of automation
of live chat.

Given the increasing impact of live chat services,
there is surprisingly little published computational

linguistic research on the topic. There has been sub-
stantially more work done on dialogue and dialogue
corpora, mostly in spoken dialogue (e.g. Stolcke et
al. (2000)) but also multimodal dialogue systems in
application areas such as telephone support service
(Bangalore et al., 2006) and tutoring systems (Lit-
man and Silliman, 2004). Spoken dialogue analysis
introduces many complications related to the error
inherent in current speech recognition technologies.
As an instance of written dialogue, an advantage of
live chats is that recognition errors are not such an is-
sue, although the nature of language used in chat is
typically ill-formed and turn-taking is complicated
by the semi-asynchronous nature of the interaction
(e.g. Werry (1996)).

In this paper, we investigate the task of automatic
classification of dialogue acts in 1-on-1 live chats,
focusing on “information delivery” chats since these
are proving increasingly popular as part of enter-
prise customer-service solutions. Our main chal-
lenge is to develop effective features and classifiers
for classifying aspects of 1-on-1 live chat. Much of
the work on analysing dialogue acts in spoken di-
alogues has relied on non-lexical features, such as
prosody and acoustic features (Stolcke et al., 2000;
Julia and Iftekharuddin, 2008; Sridhar et al., 2009),
which are not available for written dialogues. Pre-
vious dialogue-act detection for chat systems has
used bags-of-words (hereafter, BoW) as features
for dialogue-act detection; this simple approach
has shown some promise (e.g. Bangalore et al.
(2006), Louwerse and Crossley (2006) and Ivanovic
(2008)). Other features such as keywords/ontologies
(Purver et al., 2005; Forsyth, 2007) and lexical cues
(Ang et al., 2005) have also been used for dialogue
act classification.

In this paper, we first re-examine BoW features
for dialogue act classification. As a baseline, we
use the work of Ivanovic (2008), which explored 1-
grams and 2-grams with Boolean values in 1-on-1
live chats in the MSN Online Shopping domain (this
dataset is described in Section 5). Although this
work achieved reasonably high performance (up to
a micro-averaged F-score of around 80%), we be-
lieve that there is still room for improvement using
BoW only. We extend this work by using ideas from
related research such as text categorization (Debole
and Sebastiani, 2003), and explore variants of BoW
based on analysis of live chats, along with feature
weighting. Finally, our main aim is to explore new
features based on dialogue structure and dependen-
cies between utterances1 that can enhance the use of
BoW for dialogue act classification. Our hypothesis
is that, for task-oriented 1-on-1 live chats, the struc-
ture and interactions among utterances are useful in
predicting future dialogue acts: for example, conver-
sations typically start with a greeting, and questions
and answers typically appear as adjacency pairs in
a conversation. Therefore, we propose new features
based on structural and dependency information de-
rived from utterances (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).

2 Related Work

While there has been significant work on classify-
ing dialogue acts, the bulk of this has been for spo-
ken dialogue. Most such work has considered: (1)
defining taxonomies of dialogue acts; (2) discover-
ing useful features for the classification task; and (3)
experimenting with different machine learning tech-
niques. We focus here on (2) and (3); we return to
(1) in Section 3.

For classifying dialogue acts in spoken dialogue,
various features such as dialogue cues, speech char-
acteristics, and n-grams have been proposed. For
example, Samuel et al. (1998) utilized the charac-
teristics of spoken dialogues and examined speaker
direction, punctuation marks, cue phrases and n-
grams for classifying spoken dialogues. Jurafsky et
al. (1998) used prosodic, lexical and syntactic fea-
tures for spoken dialogue classification. More re-
cently, Julia and Iftekharuddin (2008) and Sridhar et

1An utterance is the smallest unit to deliver a participant’s
message(s) in a turn.

al. (2009) achieved high performance using acous-
tic and prosodic features. Louwerse and Cross-
ley (2006), on the other hand, used various n-gram
features—which could be adapted to both spoken
and written dialogue—and tested them using the
Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991). Extend-
ing the discourse model used in previous work, Ban-
galore et al. (2006) used n-grams from the previous
1–3 utterances in order to classify dialogue acts for
the target utterance.

There has been substantially less effort on clas-
sifying dialogue acts in written dialogue: Wu et al.
(2002) and Forsyth (2007) have used keyword-based
approaches for classifying online chats; Ivanovic
(2008) tested the use of n-gram features for 1-on-1
live chats with MSN Online Shopping assistants.

Various machine learning techniques have been
investigated for the dialogue classification task.
Samuel et al. (1998) used transformation-based
learning to classify spoken dialogues, incorporat-
ing Monte Carlo sampling for training efficiency.
Stolcke et al. (2000) used Hidden Markov Mod-
els (HMMs) to account for the structure of spo-
ken dialogues, while Wu et al. (2002) also used
transformation- and rule-based approaches plus
HMMs for written dialogues. Other researchers
have used Bayesian based approaches, such as
naive Bayes (e.g. (Grau et al., 2004; Forsyth,
2007; Ivanovic, 2008)) and Bayesian networks (e.g.
(Keizer, 2001; Forsyth, 2007)). Maximum entropy
(e.g. (Ivanovic, 2008)), support vector machines
(e.g. (Ivanovic, 2008)), and hidden Markov models
(e.g. (Bui, 2003)) have also all been applied to auto-
matic dialogue act classification.

3 Dialogue Acts

A number of dialogue act taxonomies have been pro-
posed, designed mainly for spoken dialogue. Many
of these use the Dialogue Act Markup in Several
Layers (DAMSL) scheme (Allen and Core, 1997).
DAMSL was originally applied to the TRAINS cor-
pus of (transcribed) spoken task-oriented dialogues,
but various adaptations of it have since been pro-
posed for specific types of dialogue. The Switch-
board corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) defines 42 types
of dialogue acts from human-to-human telephone
conversations. The HCRC Map Task corpus (Ander-

863



son et al., 1991) defines a set of 128 dialogue acts to
model task-based spoken conversations.

For casual online chat dialogues, Wu et al. (2002)
define 15 dialogue act tags based on previously-
defined dialogue act sets (Samuel et al., 1998;
Shriberg et al., 1998; Jurafsky et al., 1998; Stolcke
et al., 2000). Forsyth (2007) defines 15 dialogue acts
for casual online conversations, based on 16 conver-
sations with 10,567 utterances. Ivanovic (2008) pro-
poses 12 dialogue acts based on DAMSL for 1-on-1
online customer service chats.

Ivanovic’s set of dialogue acts for chat dia-
logues has significant overlap with the dialogue act
sets of Wu et al. (2002) and Forsyth (2007) (e.g.
GREETING, EMOTION/EXPRESSION, STATEMENT,
QUESTION). In our work, we re-use the set of dia-
logue acts proposed in Ivanovic (2008), due to our
targeting the same task of 1-on-1 IM chats, and in-
deed experimenting over the same dataset. The def-
initions of the dialogue acts are provided in Table 1,
along with examples.

4 Feature Selection

In this section, we describe our initial dialogue-act
classification experiments using simple BoW fea-
tures, and then introduce two groups of new fea-
tures based on structural information and dependen-
cies between utterances.

4.1 Bag-of-Words

n-gram-based BoW features are simple yet effec-
tive for identifying similarities between two utter-
ances, and have been used widely in previous work
on dialogue act classification for online chat di-
alogues (Louwerse and Crossley, 2006; Ivanovic,
2008). However, chats containing large amounts of
noise such as typos and emoticons pose a greater
challenge for simple BoW approaches. On the other
hand, keyword-based features (Forsyth, 2007) have
achieved high performance; however, keyword-
based approaches are more domain-dependent. In
this work, we chose to start with a BoW approach
based on our observation that commercial live chat
services contain relatively less noise; in particular,
the commercial agent tends to use well-formed, for-
mulaic prose.

Previously, Ivanovic (2008) explored Boolean 1-

gram and 2-gram features to classify MSN Online
Shopping live chats, where a user requests assis-
tance in purchasing an item, in response to which the
commercial agent asks the customer questions and
makes suggestions. Ivanovic (2008) achieved solid
performance over this data (around 80% F-score).
While 1-grams performed well (as live chat utter-
ances are generally shorter than, e.g., sentences in
news articles), we expect 2- and 3-grams are needed
to detect formulaic expressions, such as No problem
and You are welcome. We would also expect a pos-
itive effect from combining n-grams due to increas-
ing the coverage of feature words. We thus test 1-,
2- and 3-grams individually, as well as the combi-
nation of 1- and 2-grams together (i.e. 1+2-grams)
and 1-, 2- and 3-grams (i.e. 1+2+3-grams); this re-
sults in five BoW sets. Also, unlike Ivanovic (2008),
we test both raw words and lemmas; we expect the
use of lemmas to perform better than raw words as
our data is less noisy. As the feature weight, in addi-
tion to simple Boolean, we also experiment with TF,
TF·IDF and Information Gain (IG).

4.2 Structural Information

Our motivation for using structural information as
a feature is that the location of an utterance can be
a strong predictor of the dialogue act. That is, dia-
logues are sequenced, comprising turns (i.e. a given
user is sending text), each of which is made up of
one or more messages (i.e. strings sent by the user).
Structured classification methods which make use of
this sequential information have been applied to re-
lated tasks such as tagging semantic labels of key
sentences in biomedical domains (Chung, 2009) and
post labels in web forums (Kim et al., 2010).

Based on the nature of live chats, we observed that
the utterance position in the chat, as well as in a turn,
plays an important role when identifying its dialogue
act. For example, an utterance such as Hello will oc-
cur at the beginning of a chat while an utterance such
as Have a nice day will typically appear at the end.
The position of utterances in a turn can also help
identify the dialogue act; i.e. when there are several
utterances in a turn, utterances are related to each
other, and thus examining the previous utterances in
the same turn can help correctly predict the target
utterance. For example, the greeting (Welcome to ..)
and question (How may I help you?) could occur in

Dialogue Act, Definition and Examples
CONVENTIONAL CLOSING: Various ways of ending a conversation e.g. Bye Bye
CONVENTIONAL OPENING: Greeting and other ways of starting a conversation e.g. Hello Customer
DOWNPLAYER: A backwards-linking label often used after THANKS to down play the contribution
e.g. You are welcome, my pleasure
EXPRESSIVE: An acknowledgement of a previous utterance or an indication of the speaker’s mood.
e.g. haha, : −) wow
NO ANSWER: A backward-linking label in the form of a negative response to a YESNO-QUESTION e.g. no, nope
OPEN QUESTION: A question that cannot be answered with only a yes or no. The answer is usually
some form of explanation or statement. e.g. how do I use the international version?
REQUEST: Used to express a speaker’s desire that the learner do something – either performing some action
or simply waiting. e.g. Please let me know how I can assist you on MSN Shopping today.
RESPONSE ACK: A backward-linking acknowledgement of the previous utterance. Used to confirm
that the previous utterance was received/accepted. e.g. Sure
STATEMENT: Used for assertions that may state a belief or commit the speaker to doing something
e.g. I am sending you the page which will pop up in a new window on your screen.
THANKS: Conventional thanks e.g. Thank you for contacting us.
YES ANSWER: A backward-linking label in the form of an affirmative response to a YESNO-QUESTION e.g. yes, yeah
YESNO QUESTION: A closed question which can be answered in the affirmative or negative.
e.g. Did you receive the page, Customer?

Table 1: The set of dialogue acts used in this research, taken from Ivanovic (2008)

the same turn. We also noticed that identifying the
utterance author can help classify the dialogue act
(previously used in Ivanovic (2008)).

Based on these observations, we tested the follow-
ing four structural features:

• Author information,

• Relative position in the chat,

• Author + Relative position,

• Author + Turn-relative position among utter-
ances in a given turn.

We illustrate our structural features in Table 2,
which shows an example of a 1-on-1 live chat. The
participants are the agent (A) and customer (C); Uxx
indicates an utterance (U) with ID number xx. This
conversation has 42 utterances in total. The relative
position is calculated by dividing the utterance num-
ber by the total number of utterances in the dialogue;
the turn-relative position is calculated by dividing
the utterance position by the number of utterances
in that turn. For example, for utterance 4 (U4), the
relative position is 442 , while its turn-relative position
is 23 since U4 is the second utterance among U3,4,5
that the customer makes in a single turn.

4.3 Utterance Dependency

In recent work, Kim et al. (2010) demonstrated the
importance of dependencies between post labels in
web forums. The authors introduced series of fea-
tures based on structural dependencies among posts.
They used relative position, author information and
automatically predicted labels from previous post(s)
as dependency features for assigning a semantic la-
bel to the current target post.

Similarly, by examining our chat corpus, we ob-
served significant dependencies between utterances.
First, 1-on-1 (i.e. agent-to-user) dialogues often con-
tain dependencies between adjacent utterances by
different authors. For example, in Table 2, when the
agent asks Is that correct?, the expected response
from the user is a Yes or No. Another example is
that when the agent makes a greeting, such as Have
a nice day, then the customer will typically respond
with a greeting or closing remark, and not a Yes or
No. Second, the flow of dialogues is in general co-
hesive, unless the topic of utterances changes dra-
matically (e.g. U5: Are you still there?, U22: brb
in 1 min in Table 2). Third, we observed that be-
tween utterances made by the same author (either
agent or user), the target utterance relies on previous
utterances made by the same author, especially when

Table 2: An example of a 1-on-1 live chat, with turn and
utterance structure

the agent and user repeatedly question and answer.
With these observations, we checked the likelihood
of dialogue act pairings between two adjacent utter-
ances, as well as between two adjacent utterances
made by the same author. Overall, we found strong
co-occurrence (as measured by number of occur-
rences of labels across adjacency pairs) between cer-
tain pairs of dialogue acts (e.g. (YESNO QUESTION
→YES ANSWER/NO ANSWER) and (REQUEST
→YES ANSWER)). STATEMENT, on the other
hand, can associate with most other dialogue acts.

Based on this, we designed the following five ut-
terance dependency features; by combining these,
we obtain 31 feature sets.

1. Dependency of utterances regardless of author

(a) Dialogue act of previous utterance
(b) Accumulated dialogue act(s) of previous

utterances
(c) Accumulated dialogue acts of previous ut-

terances in a given turn

2. Dependency of utterances made by a single au-
thor

(a) Dialogue act of previous utterance
by same author; a dialogue act can be in
the same turn or in the previous turn

(b) Accumulated dialogue acts of previous
utterances by same author; dialogue acts
can be in the same turn or in the previous
turn

To capture utterance dependency, Bangalore et al.
(2006) previously used n-gram BoW features from
the previous 1–3 utterances. In contrast, instead of
using utterances which indirectly encode dialogue
acts, we directly use the dialogue act classifications,
as done in Stolcke et al. (2000). The motivation is
that, due to the high performance of simple BoW
features, using dialogue acts directly would cap-
ture the dependency better than indirect information
from utterances, despite introducing some noise. We
do not build a probabilistic model of dialogue tran-
sitions the way Stolcke et al. (2000) does, but follow
an approach similar to that used in Kim et al. (2010)
in using predicted dialogue act(s) labels learned in
previous step(s) as a feature.

5 Experiment Setup

As stated earlier, we use the data set from Ivanovic
(2008) for our experiments; it contains 1-on-1 live
chats from an information delivery task. This dataset
contains 8 live chats, including 542 manually-
segmented utterances. The maximum and minimum
number of utterances in a dialogue are 84 and 42,
respectively; the maximum number of utterances in
a turn is 14. The live chats were manually tagged
with the 12 dialogue acts described in Section 3.
The utterance distribution over the dialogue acts is
described in Table 3.

For our experiments, we calculated TF, TF·IDF
and IG (Information Gain) over the utterances,
which were optionally lemmatized with the morph
tool (Minnen et al., 2000). We then built a dialogue
act classifier using three different machine learn-
ers: SVM-HMM (Joachims, 1998),2 naive Bayes

to test CRF and SVM-HMM as previous work (e.g.
(Samuel et al., 1998; Stolcke et al., 2000; Chung,
2009)) has shown the effectiveness of structured
classification models on sequential dependencies.
Thus, we expect similar effects with CRF and SVM-
HMM. Finally, we ran 8-fold cross-validation using
the feature sets described above (partitioning across
the 8 sessions). All results are presented in terms
of classification accuracy. The accuracy of a zero-R
(i.e. majority vote) baseline is 0.36.

tations and feature weighting methods. Note that the
CRF learner ran using 1-grams only, as CRF++ does
not accept large numbers of features. As a bench-
mark, we also tested the method in Ivanovic (2008)
and present the best performance over words (rather
than lemmas). Overall, we found using just 1-grams
produced the best performance for all learners, al-
though SVM achieved the best performance when
using all three n-gram orders (i.e. 1+2+3). Since the
utterances are very short, 2-grams or 3-grams alone
are too sparse to be effective. Among the feature
weighting methods, Boolean and IG achieved higher
accuracy than TF and TF·IDF. Likewise, due to the
short utterances, simple Boolean values were often
the most effective. However, as IG was computed
using the training data, it also achieved high perfor-
mance. When comparing the learners, we found that
CRF produced the best performance, due to its abil-
ity to capture inter-utterance dependencies. Finally,
we confirmed that using lemmas results in higher ac-
curacy.

Table 5 shows the accuracy over all feature sets;
for brevity, we show this for SVM only since the
pattern is similar across all learners.

6.2 Using Structural Information

In this section, we describe experiments using struc-
tural information—i.e. author and/or position—with
BoWs. As with the base BoW technique, we used
1-gram lemmas with Boolean values, based on the
results from Section 6.1. Table 6 shows the results:
Pos indicates the relative position of an utterance in
the whole dialogue, Author means author informa-
tion, and Posturn indicates the relative position of
the utterance in a turn. All methods outperformed
the baseline; methods that surpassed the results for
the simple BoW method (for the given learner) at a

Overall, using CRFs with Author and Position in-
formation produced better performance than using
BoW alone. Clearly, the ability of CRFs to natively
optimise over structural dependencies provides an
advantage over other learners.

Relative position cannot of course be measured
directly in an actual online application; hence Ta-
ble 6 also includes the use of “absolute position” as
a feature. We see that, for CRF, the absolute posi-
tion feature shows an insignificant drop in accuracy
as compared to the use of relative position. (How-
ever, we do see a significant drop in performance
when using this feature with SVM and NB.)

6.3 Using Utterance Dependency

We next combined the inter-utterance dependency
features with the BoW features. Since we use the
dialogue acts directly in utterance dependency, we
first experimented using gold-standard dialogue act
labels. We also tested using the dialogue acts which
were automatically learned in previous steps.

Table 7 shows performance using both the gold-
standard and learned dialogue acts. The differ-
ent features listed are as follows: LabelList/L in-
dicates those corresponding to all utterances in
a dialogue preceding the target utterance; Label-
Prev/P indicates a dialogue act from a previous
utterance; LabelAuthor/A indicates a dialogue act
from a previous utterance by the same author;
and LabelPrevt/LabelAuthort indicates the previ-
ous utterance(s) and previously same-authored ut-
terance(s) in a turn, respectively. Since the accuracy
for SVM and NB using learned labels is similar to
that using gold standard labels, for brevity we report

Results that exceed the BoW accuracy at a level of
statistical significance (p < 0.05) are boldfaced.

Utterance dependency features worked well in
combination with CRF only. Individually, Prev and
Prevt (i.e. BoW+P+Pt) helped to achieve higher ac-
curacies, and the Author feature was also benefi-
cial. However, List decreased the performance, as
the flow of dialogues can change, and when a larger
history of dialogue acts is included, it tends to in-
troduce noise. Comparing use of gold-standard and
learned dialogue acts, the reduction in accuracy was
not statistically significant, indicating that we can

achieve high performance on dialogue act classifi-
cation even with interactively-learned dialogue acts.
We believe this demonstrates the robustness of the
proposed techniques.

Finally, we tested the combination of features
from structural and dependency information. That
is, we used a base feature (unigrams with Boolean
value), relative position, author information, com-
bined with each of the different dependency features
– LabelList, LabelPrev, LabelAuthor, LabelPrevt
and LabelAuthort.

Table 8 shows the performance when using these
combinations, for each dependency feature. As we
would expect, CRFs performed well with the com-
bined features since CRFs can incorporate the struc-
tural and dependency information; the achieved the
highest accuracy of 96.86%.

6.4 Error Analysis and Future Work

Finally, we analyzed the errors of
the best-performing feature set (i.e.
BoW+Position+Author+LabelAuthor). In Ta-
ble 9, we present a confusion matrix of errors,
for CONVENTIONAL CLOSING (Cl), CON-
VENTIONAL OPENING (Op), DOWNPLAYER
(Dp), EXPRESSIVE (Ex), NO ANSWER (No),
OPEN QUESTION (Qu), REQUEST (Rq), RE-
SPONSE ACK (Ack), STATEMENT (St), THANKS
(Ta), YES ANSWER (Yes), and YESNO QUESTION
(YN). Rows indicate the correct dialogue acts and
columns indicate misclassified dialogue acts.

Looking over the data, STATEMENT is a common
source of misclassification, as it is the majority class
in the data. In particularly, a large number of RE-
QUEST and RESPONSE ACK utterances were tagged
as STATEMENT. We did not include punctuation
such as question marks in our feature sets; includ-
ing this would likely improve results further.

In future work, we plan to investigate methods for
automatically cleansing the data to remove typos,
and taking account of temporal gaps that can some-
times arise in online chats (e.g. in Table 2, there is
a time gap between C:U22 brb in 1 min and C:U23
Thank you for waiting).

7 Conclusion

We have explored an automated approach for classi-
fying dialogue acts in 1-on-1 live chats in the shop-
ping domain, using bag-of-words (BoW), structural
information and utterance dependency features. We
found that the BoW features perform remarkably
well, with slight improvements when using lemmas
rather than words. Including structural and inter-
utterance dependency information further improved
performance. Of the learners we experimented with,
CRFs performed best, due to their ability to natively
capture sequential dialogue act dependencies.
