Abstract

This paper presents efficient algorithms for
expected similarity maximization, which co-
incides with minimum Bayes decoding for a
similarity-based loss function. Our algorithms
are designed for similarity functions that are
sequence kernels in a general class of posi-
tive definite symmetric kernels. We discuss
both a general algorithm and a more efficient
algorithm applicable in a common unambigu-
ous scenario. We also describe the applica-
tion of our algorithms to machine translation
and report the results of experiments with sev-
eral translation data sets which demonstrate a
substantial speed-up. In particular, our results
show a speed-up by two orders of magnitude
with respect to the original method of Tromble
et al. (2008) and by a factor of 3 or more
even with respect to an approximate algorithm
specifically designed for that task. These re-
sults open the path for the exploration of more
appropriate or optimal kernels for the specific
tasks considered.

1 Introduction

The output of many complex natural language pro-
cessing systems such as information extraction,
speech recognition, or machine translation systems
is a probabilistic automaton. Exploiting the full in-
formation provided by this probabilistic automaton
can lead to more accurate results than just using the
one-best sequence.

Different techniques have been explored in the
past to take advantage of the full lattice, some based
on the use of a more complex model applied to
the automaton as in rescoring, others using addi-
tional data or information for reranking the hypothe-
ses represented by the automaton. One method for
using these probabilistic automata that has been suc-
cessful in large-vocabulary speech recognition (Goel
and Byrne, 2000) and machine translation (Kumar
and Byrne, 2004; Tromble et al., 2008) applications

and that requires no additional data or other com-
plex models is the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) de-
coding technique. This returns that sequence of the
automaton having the minimum expected loss with
respect to all sequences accepted by the automaton
(Bickel and Doksum, 2001). Often, minimizing the
loss function L can be equivalently viewed as max-
imizing a similarity function K between sequences,
which corresponds to a kernel function when it is
positive definite symmetric (Berg et al., 1984). The
technique can then be thought of as an expected se-
quence similarity maximization.

This paper considers this expected similarity max-
imization view. Since different similarity functions
can be used within this framework, one may wish to
select the one that is the most appropriate or relevant
to the task considered. However, a crucial require-
ment for this choice to be realistic is to ensure that
for the family of similarity functions considered the
expected similarity maximization is efficiently com-
putable. Thus, we primarily focus on this algorith-
mic problem in this paper, leaving it to future work
to study the question of determining how to select
the similarity function and report on the benefits of
this choice.

A general family of sequence kernels including
the sequence kernels used in computational biology,
text categorization, spoken-dialog classification, and
many other tasks is that of rational kernels (Cortes
et al., 2004). We show how the expected similarity
maximization can be efficiently computed for these
kernels. In section 3, we describe more specifically
the framework of expected similarity maximization
in the case of rational kernels and the correspond-
ing algorithmic problem. In Section 4, we describe
both a general method for the computation of the ex-
pected similarity maximization, and a more efficient
method that can be used with a broad sub-family
of rational kernels that verify a condition of non-
ambiguity. This latter family includes the class of
n-gram kernels which have been previously used to

apply MBR to machine translation (Tromble et al.,
2008). We examine in more detail the use and ap-
plication of our algorithms to machine translation
in Section 5. Section 6 reports the results of ex-
periments applying our algorithms in several large
data sets in machine translation. These experiments
demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm which
is shown empirically to be two orders of magnitude
faster than Tromble et al. (2008) and more than 3
times faster than even an approximation algorithm
specifically designed for this problem (Kumar et al.,
2009). We start with some preliminary definitions
and algorithms related to weighted automata and
transducers, following the definitions and terminol-
ogy of Cortes et al. (2004).

2 Preliminaries

Weighted transducers are finite-state transducers in
which each transition carries some weight in addi-
tion to the input and output labels. The weight set
has the structure of a semiring.

A semiring (K,⊕,⊗, 0, 1) verifies all the axioms
of a ring except from the existence of a negative el-
ement −x for each x ∈ K, which it may verify or
not. Thus, roughly speaking, a semiring is a ring
that may lack negation. It is specified by a set of
values K, two binary operations ⊕ and ⊗, and two
designated values 0 and 1. When ⊗ is commutative,
the semiring is said to be commutative.

The real semiring (R+, +,×, 0, 1) is used when
the weights represent probabilities. The log
semiring (R ∪ {−∞, +∞},⊕log, +,∞, 0) is iso-
morphic to the real semiring via the negative-
log mapping and is often used in practice
for numerical stability. The tropical semiring
(R∪, {−∞, +∞}, min, +,∞, 0) is derived from
the log semiring via the Viterbi approximation and
is often used in shortest-path applications.

Figure 1(a) shows an example of a weighted
finite-state transducer over the real semiring
(R+, +,×, 0, 1). In this figure, the input and out-
put labels of a transition are separated by a colon
delimiter and the weight is indicated after the slash
separator. A weighted transducer has a set of initial
states represented in the figure by a bold circle and
a set of final states, represented by double circles. A
path from an initial state to a final state is an accept-
ing path.

The weight of an accepting path is obtained by
first ⊗-multiplying the weights of its constituent

transitions and⊗-multiplying this product on the left
by the weight of the initial state of the path (which
equals 1 in our work) and on the right by the weight
of the final state of the path (displayed after the slash
in the figure). The weight associated by a weighted
transducer T to a pair of strings (x, y) ∈ Σ∗ ×Σ∗ is
denoted by T (x, y) and is obtained by ⊕-summing
the weights of all accepting paths with input label x
and output label y.

For any transducer T , T−1 denotes its inverse,
that is the transducer obtained from T by swapping
the input and output labels of each transition. For all
x, y ∈ Σ∗, we have T−1(x, y) = T (y, x).

The composition of two weighted transducers T1
and T2 with matching input and output alphabets Σ,
is a weighted transducer denoted by T1 ◦ T2 when
the semiring is commutative and the sum:

(T1 ◦ T2)(x, y) =
∑

z∈Σ∗

T1(x, z)⊗ T2(z, y) (1)

is well-defined and in K for all x, y (Salomaa and
Soittola, 1978).

Weighted automata can be defined as weighted
transducers A with identical input and output labels,
for any transition. Since only pairs of the form (x, x)
can have a non-zero weight associated to them by
A, we denote the weight associated by A to (x, x)
by A(x) and call it the weight associated by A to
x. Similarly, in the graph representation of weighted
automata, the output (or input) label is omitted. Fig-
ure 1(b) shows an example of a weighted automa-
ton. When A and B are weighted automata, A ◦ B
is called the intersection of A and B. Omitting the
input labels of a weighted transducer T results in a
weighted automaton which is said to be the output
projection of T .

3 General Framework

Let X be a probabilistic automaton representing the
output of a complex model for a specific query input.
The model may be for example a speech recognition
system, an information extraction system, or a ma-
chine translation system (which originally motivated
our study). For machine translation, the sequences
accepted by X are the potential translations of the
input sentence, each with some probability given by
X .

Let Σ be the alphabet for the task considered, e.g.,
words of the target language in machine translation,
and let L : Σ∗ × Σ∗ → R denote a loss function
defined over the sequences on that alphabet. Given
a reference or hypothesis set H ⊆ Σ∗, minimum
Bayes risk (MBR) decoding consists of selecting a
hypothesis x ∈ H with minimum expected loss with
respect to the probability distribution X (Bickel and
Doksum, 2001; Tromble et al., 2008):

x̂ = argmin
x∈H

E
x′∼X

[L(x, x′)]. (2)

Here, we shall consider the case, frequent in prac-
tice, where minimizing the loss L is equivalent to
maximizing a similarity measure K : Σ∗×Σ∗ → R.
When K is a sequence kernel that can be repre-
sented by weighted transducers, it is a rational ker-
nel (Cortes et al., 2004). The problem is then equiv-
alent to the following expected similarity maximiza-
tion:

x̂ = argmax
x∈H

E
x′∼X

[K(x, x′)]. (3)

When K is a positive definite symmetric rational
kernel, it can often be rewritten as K(x, y) = (T ◦
T−1)(x, y), where T is a weighted transducer over
the semiring (R+∪{+∞}, +,×, 0, 1). Equation (3)
can then be rewritten as

x̂ = argmax
x∈H

E
x′∼X

[(T ◦ T−1)(x, x′)] (4)

= argmax
x∈H

‖A(x) ◦ T ◦ T−1 ◦X‖, (5)

where we denote by A(x) an automaton accepting
(only) the string x and by ‖·‖ the sum of the weights
of all accepted paths of a transducer.

4 Algorithms

4.1 General method

Equation (5) could suggest computing A(x) ◦ T ◦
T−1 ◦ X for each possible x ∈ H . Instead, we

can compute a composition based on an automa-
ton accepting all sequences in H , A(H). This leads
to a straightforward method for determining the se-
quence maximizing the expected similarity having
the following steps:

1. compute the composition X ◦ T , project on
the output and optimize (epsilon-remove, de-
terminize, minimize (Mohri, 2009)) and let Y2
be the result;1

2. compute the composition Y1 = A(H) ◦ T ;

3. compute Y1 ◦ Y2 and project on the input, let Z
be the result;2

4. determinize Z;

5. find the maximum weight path with the label of
that path giving x̂.

While this method can be efficient in various scenar-
ios, in some instances the weighted determinization
yielding Z can be both space- and time-consuming,
even though the input is acyclic. The next two sec-
tions describe more efficient algorithms.

Note that in practice, for numerical stability, all
of these computations are done in the log semiring
which is isomorphic to (R+∪{+∞}, +,×, 0, 1). In
particular, the maximum weight path in the last step
is then obtained by using a standard single-source
shortest-path algorithm.

4.2 Efficient method for n-gram kernels

A common family of rational kernels is the family
of n-gram kernels. These kernels are widely use as
a similarity measure in natural language processing
and computational biology applications, see (Leslie
et al., 2002; Lodhi et al., 2002) for instance.

The n-gram kernel Kn of order n is defined as

Kn(x, y) =
∑

|z|=n

cx(z)cy(z), (6)

where cx(z) is the number of occurrences of z in
x. Kn is a positive definite symmetric rational ker-
nel since it corresponds to the weighted transducer
Tn ◦ T

−1
n where the transducer Tn is defined such

that Tn(x, z) = cx(z) for all x, z ∈ Σ∗ with |z| = n.

1Equivalent to computing T−1 ◦ X and projecting on the
input.

2Z is then the projection on the input of A(H)◦T ◦T−1◦X .

The transducer T2 for Σ = {a, b} is shown in Fig-
ure 2(a).

Taking advantage of the special structure of n-
gram kernels and of the fact that A(H) is an un-
weighted automaton, we can devise a new and sig-
nificantly more efficient method for computing x̂
based on the following steps.

1. Compute the expected n-gram counts in X: We
compute the composition X ◦T , project on out-
put and optimize (epsilon-remove, determinize,
minimize) and let Y2 be the result. Observe that
the weighted automaton Y2 is a compact repre-
sentation of the expected n-gram counts in X ,
i.e. for an n-gram w (i.e. |w| = n):

Y2(w) =
∑

x∈Σ∗

X(x)cx(w)

= E
x∼X

[cx(w)] = cX(w).
(7)

2. Construct a context-dependency model: We
compute the weighted automaton Y1 over the
tropical semiring as follow: the set of states is
Q = {w ∈ Σ∗| |w| ≤ n and w occurs in X},
the initial state being ǫ and every state being fi-

nal; the set of transitions E contains all 4-tuple
(origin, label, weight, destination) of the form:

• (w, a, 0, wa) with wa ∈ Q and |w| ≤ n−
2 and

• (aw, b, Y2(awb), wb) with Y2(awb) 6= 0
and |w| = n− 2

where a, b ∈ Σ and w ∈ Σ∗. Observe that
w ∈ Q when wa ∈ Q and that aw, wb ∈ Q
when Y2(awb) 6= 0. Given a string x, we have

Y1(x) =
∑

|w|=n

cX(w)cx(w). (8)

Observe that Y1 is a deterministic automaton,
hence Y1(x) can be computed in O(|x|) time.

3. Compute x̂: We compute the composition
A(H) ◦ Y1. x̂ is then the label of the accepting
path with the largest weight in this transducer
and can be obtained by applying a shortest-path
algorithm to −A(H) ◦ Y1 in the tropical semir-
ing.

The main computational advantage of this method
is that it avoids the determinization of Z in the

The method has also been shown empirically to be
significantly faster than the one described in the pre-
vious section.

The algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2. The al-
phabet is Σ = {a, b} and the counting transducer
corresponding to the bigram kernel is given in Fig-
ure 2(a). The evidence probabilistic automaton X
is given in Figure 2(b) and we use as hypothesis
set the set of strings that were assigned a non-zero
probability by X; this set is represented by the deter-
ministic finite automaton A(H) given in Figure 2(c).
The result of step 1 of the algorithm is the weighted
automaton Y2 over the real semiring given in Fig-
ure 2(d). The result of step 2 is the weighted au-
tomaton Y1 over the tropical semiring is given in
Figure 2(e). Finally, the result of the composition
A(H) ◦ Y1 (step 3) is the weighted automaton over
the tropical semiring given in Figure 2(f). The re-
sult of the expected similarity maximization is the
string x̂ = ababa, which is obtained by applying
a shortest-path algorithm to −A(H) ◦ Y1. Observe
that the string x with the largest probability in X is
x = bbaba and is hence different from x̂ = ababa in
this example.

4.3 Efficient method for the unambiguous case

The algorithm presented in the previous section for
n-gram kernels can be generalized to handle a wide
variety of rational kernels.

Let K be an arbitrary rational kernel defined by a
weighted transducer T . Let XT denote the regular
language of the strings output by T . We shall as-
sume that XT is a finite language, though the results
of this section generalize to the infinite case. Let
Σ denote a new alphabet defined by Σ = {#x : x ∈
XT } and consider the simple grammar G of context-

dependent batch rules:

ǫ → #x/x ǫ. (9)

Each such rule inserts the symbol #x immediately
after an occurrence x in the input string. For batch
context-dependent rules, the context of the applica-
tion for all rules is determined at once before their
application (Kaplan and Kay, 1994). Assume that
this grammar is unambiguous for a parallel applica-
tion of the rules. This condition means that there is
a unique way of parsing an input string using the
strings of XT . The assumption holds for n-gram
sequences, for example, since the rules applicable
are uniquely determined by the n-grams (making the
previous section a special case).

Given an acyclic weighted automaton Y2 over the
tropical semiring accepting a subset of XT , we can
construct a deterministic weighted automaton Y1 for
Σ∗L(Y2) when this grammar is unambiguous. The
weight assigned by Y1 to an input string is then the
sum of the weights of the substrings accepted by Y2.
This can be achieved using weighted determiniza-
tion.

This suggests a new method for generalizing Step
2 of the algorithm described in the previous section
as follows (see illustration in Figure 3):

(i) use Y2 to construct a deterministic weighted
tree Y ′2 defined on the tropical semiring ac-
cepting the same strings as Y2 with the same
weights, with the final weights equal to the to-
tal weight given by Y2 to the string ending at
that leaf;

(ii) let Y1 be the weighted automaton obtained by
first adding self-loops labeled with all elements
of Σ at the initial state of Y ′2 and then deter-
minizing it, and then inserting new transitions
leaving final states as described in (Mohri and
Sproat, 1996).

961



Step (ii) consists of computing a deterministic
weighted automaton for Σ∗Y ′2 . This step corre-
sponds to the Aho-Corasick construction (Aho and
Corasick, 1975) and can be done in time linear in
the size of Y ′2 .

This approach assumes that the grammar G of
batch context-dependent rules inferred by XT is un-
ambiguous. This can be tested by constructing the
finite automaton corresponding to all rules in G. The
grammar G is unambiguous iff the resulting automa-
ton is unambiguous (which can be tested using a
classical algorithm). An alternative and more ef-
ficient test consists of checking the presence of a
failure or default transition to a final state during
the Aho-Corasick construction, which occurs if and
only if there is ambiguity.

5 Application to Machine Translation

In machine translation, the BLEU score (Papineni et
al., 2001) is typically used as an evaluation metric.
In (Tromble et al., 2008), a Minimum Bayes-Risk
decoding approach for MT lattices was introduced.3

The loss function used in that approach was an ap-
proximation of the log-BLEU score by a linear func-
tion of n-gram matches and candidate length. This
loss function corresponds to the following similarity
measure:

KLB(x, x
′) = θ0|x

′|+
∑

|w|≤n

θ|w|cx(w)1x′(w).

(10)
where 1x(w) is 1 if w occurs in x and 0 otherwise.

(Tromble et al., 2008) implements the MBR de-
coder using weighted automata operations. First,
the set of n-grams is extracted from the lat-
tice. Next, the posterior probability p(w|X) of
each n-gram is computed. Starting with the un-
weighted lattice A(H), the contribution of each n-
gram w to (10) is applied by iteratively compos-
ing with the weighted automaton corresponding to
w(w/(θ|w|p(w|X))w)

∗ where w = Σ∗ \ (Σ∗wΣ∗).
Finally, the MBR hypothesis is extracted as the best
path in the automaton. The above steps are carried
out one n-gram at a time. For a moderately large lat-
tice, there can be several thousands of n-grams and
the procedure becomes expensive. This leads us to
investigate methods that do not require processing
the n-grams one at a time in order to achieve greater
efficiency.

3Related approaches were presented in (DeNero et al., 2009;
Kumar et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009).

Figure 4: Transducer T 1 over the real semiring for the

The first idea is to approximate the KLB similar-
ity measure using a weighted sum of n-gram ker-
nels. This corresponds to approximating 1x′(w) by
cx′(w) in (10). This leads us to the following simi-
larity measure:

KNG(x, x
′) = θ0|x

∑

|w|≤n

θ|w|cx(w)cx′(w)

= θ0|x
′|+

∑

1≤i≤n

θiKi(x, x
′)

(11)
Intuitively, the larger the length of w the less likely
it is that cx(w) 6= 1x(w), which suggests comput-
ing the contribution to KLB(x, x′) of lower-order
n-grams (|w| ≤ k) exactly, but using the approxima-
tion by n-gram kernels for the higher-order n-grams
(|w| > k). This gives the following similarity mea-
sure:

KkNG(x, x
′) = θ0|x

′|+
∑

1≤|w|≤k

θ|w|cx(w)1x′(w)

+
∑

k<|w|≤n

θ|w|cx(w)cx′(w)

(12)
Observe that K0NG = KNG and K

n
NG = KLB .

All these similarity measures can still be com-
puted using the framework described in Section 4.
Indeed, there exists a transducer Tn over the real
semiring such that Tn(x, z) = 1x(z) for all x ∈ Σ∗

and z ∈ Σn. The transducer T 1 for Σ = {a, b} is
given by Figure 4. Let us define the similarity mea-
sure Kn as:

Kn(x, x
′) = (Tn◦T

−1
n )(x, x

′) =
∑

|w|=n

cx(w)1x′(w).

(13)
Observe that the framework described in Section 4
can still be applied even though Kn is not symmet-
ric. The similarity measures KLB , KNG and KkNG

6 Experimental Results

Lattices were generated using a phrase-based MT
system similar to the alignment template system de-
scribed in (Och and Ney, 2004). Given a source sen-
tence, the system produces a word lattice A that is a
compact representation of a very large N -best list of
translation hypotheses for that source sentence and
their likelihoods. The lattice A is converted into a
lattice X that represents a probability distribution
(i.e. the posterior probability distribution given the
source sentence) following:

X(x) =
exp(αA(x))∑

y∈Σ∗ exp(αA(y))
(14)

where the scaling factor α ∈ [0,∞) flattens the dis-
tribution when α < 1 and sharpens it when α > 1.
We then applied the methods described in Section 5
to the lattice X using as hypothesis set H the un-
weighted lattice obtained from X .

The following parameters for the n-gram factors
were used:

θ0 =
−1

T
and θn =

1

4Tprn−1
for n ≥ 1. (15)

Experiments were conducted on two language
pairs Arabic-English (aren) and Chinese-English
(zhen) and for a variety of datasets from the NIST
Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation.4

in Table 3. We used the IBM implementation of the
BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001).

We implemented the following methods using the
OpenFst library (Allauzen et al., 2007):

• exact: uses the similarity measure KLB based
on the linearized log-BLEU, implemented as
described in (Tromble et al., 2008);

• approx: uses the approximation to KLB from
(Kumar et al., 2009) and described in the ap-
pendix;

• ngram: uses the similarity measure KNG im-
plemented using the algorithm of Section 4.2;

• ngram1: uses the similarity measure K1NG
also implemented using the algorithm of Sec-
tion 4.2.

The results from Tables 1-2 show that ngram1
performs as well as exact on all datasets5 while be-
ing two orders of magnitude faster than exact and
overall more than 3 times faster than approx.

7 Conclusion

We showed that for broad families of transducers
T and thus rational kernels, the expected similar-

ity maximization problem can be solved efficiently.
This opens up the option of seeking the most appro-
priate rational kernel or transducer T for the spe-
cific task considered. In particular, the kernel K
used in our machine translation applications might
not be optimal. One may well imagine for exam-
ple that some n-grams should be further emphasized
and others de-emphasized in the definition of the
similarity. This can be easily accommodated in the
framework of rational kernels by modifying the tran-
sition weights of T . But, ideally, one would wish
to select those weights in an optimal fashion. As
mentioned earlier, we leave this question to future
work. However, we can offer a brief look at how
one could tackle this question. One method for de-
termining an optimal kernel for the expected sim-
ilarity maximization problem consists of solving a
problem similar to that of learning kernels in classi-
fication or regression. Let X1, . . . , Xm be m lattices
with Ref(X1), . . . ,Ref(Xm) the associated refer-
ences and let x̂(K, Xi) be the solution of the ex-
pected similarity maximization for lattice Xi when
using kernel K. Then, the kernel learning optimiza-
tion problem can be formulated as follows:

min
K∈K

1

m

m∑

i=1

L(x̂(K, Xi), Ref(Xi))

s. t. K = T ◦ T−1 ∧ Tr[K] ≤ C,

where K is a convex family of rational kernels and
Tr[K] denotes the trace of the kernel matrix. In
particular, we could choose K as a family of linear
combinations of base rational kernels. Techniques
and ideas similar to those discussed by Cortes et al.
(2008) for learning sequence kernels could be di-
rectly relevant to this problem.

A Appendix

We describe here the approximation of the KLB
similarity measure from Kumar et al. (2009). We
assume in this section that the lattice X is determin-
istic in order to simplify the notations. The posterior
probability of n-gram w in the lattice X can be for-
mulated as:

p(w|X) =
∑

x∈Σ∗

1x(w)P (x|s) =
∑

x∈Σ∗

1x(w)X(x)

(16)
where s denotes the source sentence. When using
the similarity measure KLB defined Equation (10),

Equation (3) can then be reformulated as:

x̂ = argmax
x′∈H

θ0|x
′|+

∑

w

θ|w|cx′(w)p(w|X). (17)

The key idea behind this new approximation algo-
rithm is to rewrite the n-gram posterior probability
(Equation 16) as follows:

p(w|X) =
∑

x∈Σ∗

∑

e∈EX

f(e, w, πx)X(x) (18)

where EX is the set of transitions of X , πx is
the unique accepting path labeled by x in X and
f(e, w, π) is a score assigned to transition e on path
π containing n-gram w:

f(e, w, π) =






1 if w ∈ e, p(e|X) > p(e′|X),
and e′ precedes e on π

0 otherwise.
(19)

In other words, for each path π, we count the tran-
sition that contributes n-gram w and has the highest
transition posterior probability relative to its prede-
cessors on the path π; there is exactly one such tran-
sition on each lattice path π.

We note that f(e, w, π) relies on the full path π
which means that it cannot be computed based on
local statistics. We therefore approximate the quan-
tity f(e, w, π) with f∗(e, w, X) that counts the tran-
sition e with n-gram w that has the highest arc poste-
rior probability relative to predecessors in the entire
lattice X . f∗(e, w, X) can be computed locally, and
the n-gram posterior probability based on f∗ can be
determined as follows:

p(w|G) =
∑

x∈Σ∗

∑

e∈EX

f∗(e, w, X)X(x)

=
∑

e∈Ex

1w∈ef
∗(e, w, X)

∑

x∈Σ∗

1πx(e)X(x)

=
∑

e∈EX

1w∈ef
∗(e, w, X)P (e|X),

(20)
where P (e|X) is the posterior probability of a lat-
tice transition e ∈ EX . The algorithm to perform
Lattice MBR is given in Algorithm 1. For each state
t in the lattice, we maintain a quantity Score(w, t)
for each n-gram w that lies on a path from the initial
state to t. Score(w, t) is the highest posterior prob-
ability among all transitions on the paths that termi-
nate on t and contain n-gram w. The forward pass
requires computing the n-grams introduced by each
transition; to do this, we propagate n-grams (up to
maximum order −1) terminating on each state.
