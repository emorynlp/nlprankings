Abstract

The search in patent databases is a risky
business compared to the search in other
domains. A single document that is relevant
but overlooked during a patent search can
turn into an expensive proposition. While
recent research engages in specialized mod-
els and algorithms to improve the effective-
ness of patent retrieval, we bring another
aspect into focus: the detection and ex-
ploitation of patent inconsistencies. In par-
ticular, we analyze spelling errors in the as-
signee field of patents granted by the United
States Patent & Trademark Office. We in-
troduce technology in order to improve re-
trieval effectiveness despite the presence of
typographical ambiguities. In this regard,
we (1) quantify spelling errors in terms of
edit distance and phonological dissimilarity
and (2) render error detection as a learn-
ing problem that combines word dissimi-
larities with patent meta-features. For the
task of finding all patents of a company,
our approach improves recall from 96.7%
(when using a state-of-the-art patent search
engine) to 99.5%, while precision is com-
promised by only 3.7%.

1 Introduction

Patent search forms the heart of most retrieval
tasks in the intellectual property domain—cf. Ta-
ble 1, which provides an overview of various user
groups along with their typical (•) and related (◦)
tasks. The due diligence task, for example, is
concerned with legal issues that arise while inves-
tigating another company. Part of an investiga-
tion is a patent portfolio comparison between one
or more competitors (Lupu et al., 2011). Within
all tasks recall is preferred over precision, a fact

which distinguishes patent search from general
web search. This retrieval constraint has produced
a variety of sophisticated approaches tailored to
the patent domain: citation analysis (Magdy and
Jones, 2010), the learning of section-specific re-
trieval models (Lopez and Romary, 2010), and au-
tomated query generation (Xue and Croft, 2009).
Each approach improves retrieval performance,
but what keeps them from attaining maximum ef-
fectiveness in terms of recall are the inconsisten-
cies found in patents: incomplete citation sets, in-
correctly assigned classification codes, and, not
least, spelling errors.

Our paper deals with spelling errors in an oblig-
atory and important field of each patent, namely,
the patent assignee name. Bibliographic fields are
widely used among professional patent searchers
in order to constrain keyword-based search ses-
sions (Joho et al., 2010). The assignee name is
particularly helpful for patentability searches and
portfolio analyses since it determines the com-
pany holding the patent. Patent experts address
these search tasks by formulating queries contain-
ing the company name in question, in the hope of
finding all patents owned by that company. A for-
mal and more precise description of this relevant
search task is as follows: Given a query q which
specifies a company, and a set D of patents, de-
termine the set Dq ⊂ D comprised of all patents
held by the respective company.

For this purpose, all assignee names in the
patents in D should be analyzed. Let A denote
the set of all assignee names in D, and let a ∼ q
denote the fact that an assignee name a ∈ A refers
to company q. Then in the portfolio search task,
all patents filed under a are relevant. The retrieval
of Dq can thus be rendered as a query expansion

task, where q is expanded by the disjunction of
assignee names Aq with Aq = {a ∈ A | a ∼ q}.

While the trivial expansion of q by the entire
set A ensures maximum recall but entails an un-
acceptable precision, the expansion of q by the
empty set yields a reasonable baseline. The latter
approach is implemented in patent search engines
such as PatBase1 or FreePatentsOnline,2 which
return all patents where the company name q oc-
curs as a substring of the assignee name a. This
baseline is simple but reasonable; due to trade-
mark law, a company name q must be a unique
identifier (i.e. a key), and an assignee name a that
contains q can be considered as relevant. It should
be noted in this regard that |q| < |a| holds for
most elements in Aq, since the assignee names
often contain company suffixes such as “Ltd”
or “Inc”.

Our hypothesis is that due to misspelled as-
signee names a substantial fraction of relevant
patents cannot be found by the baseline ap-
proach. In this regard, the types of spelling er-
rors in assignee names given in Table 2 should
be considered.

Table 2: Types of spelling errors with increasing
problem complexity according to Stein and Curatolo
(2006). The first row refers to lexical errors, whereas
the last two rows refer to phonological errors. For each
type, an example is given, where a misspelled com-
pany name is followed by the correctly spelled variant.

Spelling error type Example

Permutations or dropped letters → Whirpool Corporation
→ Whirlpool Corporation

Misremembering spelling details → Whetherford International
→ Weatherford International

Spelling out the pronunciation → Emulecks Corporation
→ Emulex Corporation

In order to raise the recall for portfolio search
without significantly impairing precision, an ap-

proach more sophisticated than the standard re-
trieval approach, which is the expansion of q by
the empty set, is needed. Such an approach must
strive for an expansion of q by a subset of Aq,
whereby this subset should be as large as possible.

1.1 Contributions

The paper provides a new solution to the problem
outlined. This solution employs machine learn-
ing on orthographic features, as well as on patent
meta features, to reliably detect spelling errors. It
consists of two steps: (1) the computation of A+q ,
the set of assignee names that are in a certain edit
distance neighborhood to q; and (2) the filtering of
A+q , yielding the set A

∗
q , which contains those as-

signee names from A+q that are classified as mis-
spellings of q. The power of our approach can be
seen from Table 3, which also shows a key result
of our research; a retrieval system that exploits
our classifier will miss only 0.5% of the relevant
patents, while retrieval precision is compromised
by only 3.7%.

Another contribution relates to a new, manu-
ally-labeled corpus comprising spelling errors in
the assignee field of patents (cf. Section 3). In
this regard, we consider the over 2 million patents
granted by the USPTO between 2001 and 2010.
Last, we analyze indications of deliberately in-
serted spelling errors (cf. Section 4).

Measure (β = 2) for different expansion sets for q in

1.2 Causes for Inconsistencies in Patents

We identify the following six factors for inconsis-
tencies in the bibliographic fields of patents, in
particular for assignee names: (1) Misspellings
are introduced due to the lack of knowledge, the
lack of attention, and due to spelling disabili-
ties. Intellevate Inc. (2006) reports that 98%
of a sample of patents taken from the USPTO
database contain errors, most which are spelling
errors. (2) Spelling errors are only removed by the
USPTO upon request (U.S. Patent & Trademark
Office, 2010). (3) Spelling variations of inventor
names are permitted by the USPTO. The Manual
of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) states in
paragraph 605.04(b) that “if the applicant’s full
name is ’John Paul Doe,’ either ’John P. Doe’ or
’J. Paul Doe’ is acceptable.” Thus, it is valid to in-
troduce many different variations: with and with-
out initials, with and without a middle name, or
with and without suffixes. This convention ap-
plies to assignee names, too. (4) Companies of-
ten have branches in different countries, where
each branch has its own company suffix, e.g.,
“Limited” (United States), “GmbH” (Germany),
or “Kabushiki Kaisha” (Japan). Moreover, the
usage of punctuation varies along company suf-
fix abbreviations: “L.L.C.” in contrast to “LLC”,
for example. (5) Indexing errors emerge from
OCR processing patent applications, because sim-
ilar looking letters such as “e” versus “c” or “l”
versus “I” are likely to be misinterpreted. (6) With
the advent of electronic patent application filing,
the number of patent reexamination steps was re-
duced. As a consequence, the chance of unde-
tected spelling errors increases (Adams, 2010).

All of the mentioned factors add to a highly in-
consistent USPTO corpus.

2 Related Work

Information within a corpus can only be retrieved
effectively if the data is both accurate and unique
(Müller and Freytag, 2003). In order to yield data
that is accurate and unique, approaches to data
cleansing can be utilized to identify and remove
inconsistencies. Müller and Freytag (2003) clas-
sify inconsistencies, where duplicates of entities
in a corpus are part of a semantic anomaly. These
duplicates exist in a database if two or more dif-
ferent tuples refer to the same entity. With respect
to the bibliographic fields of patents, the assignee

names “Howlett-Packard” and “Hewett-Packard”
are distinct but refer to the same company. These
kinds of near-duplicates impede the identification
of duplicates (Naumann and Herschel, 2010).

Near-duplicate Detection The problem of
identifying near-duplicates is also known as
record linkage, or name matching; it is sub-
ject of active research (Elmagarmid et al., 2007).
With respect to text documents, slightly modi-
fied passages in these documents can be identi-
fied using fingerprints (Potthast and Stein, 2008).
On the other hand, for data fields which con-
tain natural language such as the assignee name
field, string similarity metrics (Cohen et al.,
2003) as well as spelling correction technol-
ogy are exploited (Damerau, 1964; Monge and
Elkan, 1997). String similarity metrics com-
pute a numeric value to capture the similarity
of two strings. Spelling correction algorithms,
by contrast, capture the likelihood for a given
word being a misspelling of another word. In
our analysis, the similarity metric SoftTfIdf is
applied, which performs best in name matching
tasks (Cohen et al., 2003), as well as the complete
range of spelling correction algorithms shown in
Figure 1: Soundex, which relies on similarity
hashing (Knuth, 1997), the Levenshtein distance,
which gives the minimum number of edits needed
to transform a word into another word (Leven-
shtein, 1966), and SmartSpell, a phonetic pro-
duction approach that computes the likelihood
of a misspelling (Stein and Curatolo, 2006). In
order to combine the strength of multiple met-
rics within a near-duplicate detection task, sev-
eral authors resort to machine learning (Bilenko
and Mooney, 2002; Cohen et al., 2003). Christen
(2006) concludes that it is important to exploit all
kinds of knowledge about the type of data in ques-
tion, and that inconsistencies are domain-specific.
Hence, an effective near-duplicate detection ap-
proach should employ domain-specific heuristics
and algorithms (Müller and Freytag, 2003). Fol-
lowing this argumentation, we augment various
word similarity assessments with patent-specific
meta-features.

Patent Search Commercial patent search en-
gines, such as PatBase and FreePatentsOnline,
handle near-duplicates in assignee names as fol-
lows. For queries which contain a company name
followed by a wildcard operator, PatBase suggests

a set of additional companies (near-duplicates),
which can be considered alongside the company
name in question. These suggestions are solely
retrieved based on a trailing wildcard query. Each
additional company name can then be marked in-
dividually by a user to expand the original query.
In case the entire set of suggestions is consid-
ered, this strategy conforms to the expansion of
a query by the empty set, which equals a rea-
sonable baseline approach. This query expansion
strategy, however, has the following drawbacks:
(1) The strategy captures only inconsistencies that
succeed the given company name in the origi-
nal query. Thus, near-duplicates which contain
spelling errors in the company name itself are not
found. Even if PatBase would support left trailing
wildcards, then only the full combination of wild-
card expressions would cover all possible cases of
misspellings. (2) Given an acronym of a company
such as IBM, it is infeasible to expand the ab-
breviation to “International Business Machines”
without considering domain knowledge.

Query Expansion Methods for Patent Search
To date, various studies have investigated query
expansion techniques in the patent domain that
focus on prior-art search and invalidity search
(Magdy and Jones, 2011). Since we are dealing
with queries that comprise only a company name,
existing methods cannot be applied. Instead, the
near-duplicate task in question is more related to a
text reuse detection task discussed by Hagen and
Stein (2011); given a document, passages which
also appear identical or slightly modified in other
documents, have to be retrieved by using standard
keyword-based search engines. Their approach is
guided by the user-over-ranking hypothesis intro-
duced by Stein and Hagen (2011). It states that
“the best retrieval performance can be achieved
with queries returning about as many results as
can be considered at user site.” If we make use
of their terminology, then we can distinguish the

query expansion sets (cf. Table 3) into two cate-
gories: (1) The trivial as well as the edit distance
expansion sets are underspecific, i.e., users cannot
cope with the large amount of irrelevant patents
returned; the precision is close to zero. (2) The
baseline approach, by contrast, is overspecific;
it returns too few documents, i.e., the achieved
recall is not optimal. As a consequence, these
query expansion sets are not suitable for portfolio
search. Our approach, on the other hand, excels
in both precision and recall.

Query Spelling Correction Queries which are
submitted to standard web search engines differ
from queries which are posed to patent search en-
gines with respect to both length and language
diversity. Hence, research in the field of web
search is concerned with suggesting reasonable
alternatives to misspelled queries rather than cor-
recting single words (Li et al., 2011). Since stan-
dard spelling correction dictionaries (e.g. ASpell)
are not able to capture the rich language used in
web queries, large-scale knowledge sources such
as Wikipedia (Li et al., 2011), query logs (Chen
et al., 2007), and large n-gram corpora (Brants et
al., 2007) are employed. It should be noted that
the set of correctly written assignee names is un-
known for the USPTO patent corpus.

Moreover, spelling errors are modeled on the
basis of language models (Li et al., 2011). Okuno
(2011) proposes a generative model to encounter
spelling errors, where the original query is ex-
panded based on alternatives produced by a small
edit distance to the original query. This strategy
correlates to the trivial query expansion set (cf.
Section 1). Unlike using a small edit distance, we
allow a reasonable high edit distance to maximize
the recall.

Trademark Search The trademark search is
about identifying registered trademarks which are
similar to a new trademark application. Sim-
ilarities between trademarks are assessed based
on figurative and verbal criteria. In the former
case, the focus is on image-based retrieval tech-
niques. Trademarks are considered verbally simi-
lar for a variety of reasons, such as pronunciation,
spelling, and conceptual closeness, e.g., swapping
letters or using numbers for words. The verbal
similarity of trademarks, on the other hand, can
be determined by using techniques comparable
to near-duplicate detection: phonological parsing,

fuzzy search, and edit distance computation (Fall
and Giraud-Carrier, 2005).

3 Detection of Spelling Errors

This section presents our machine learning ap-
proach to expand a company query q; the classi-
fier c delivers the set A∗q = {a ∈ A | c(q, a) = 1},
an approximation of the ideal set of relevant as-
signee names Aq. As a classification technol-
ogy a support vector machine with linear kernel
is used, which receives each pair (q, a) as a six-
dimensional feature vector. For training and test
purposes we identified misspellings for 100 dif-
ferent company names. A detailed description of
the constructed test corpus and a report on the
classifiers performance is given in the remainder
of this section.

3.1 Feature Set

The feature set comprises six features, three of
them being orthographic similarity metrics, which
are computed for every pair (q, a). Each metric
compares a given company name q with the first
|q| words of the assignee name a:

1. SoftTfIdf. The SoftTfIdf metric is consid-
ered, since the metric is suitable for the com-
parison of names (Cohen et al., 2003). The
metric incorporates the Jaro-Winkler met-
ric (Winkler, 1999) with a distance threshold
of 0.9. The frequency values for the similar-
ity computation are trained on A.

2. Soundex. The Soundex spelling correction
algorithm captures phonetic errors. Since the
algorithm computes hash values for both q
and a, the feature is 1 if these hash values
are equal, 0 otherwise.

3. Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein dis-
tance for (q, a) is normalized by the charac-
ter length of q.

To obtain further evidence for a misspelling
in an assignee name, meta information about the
patents in D, to which the assignee name refers
to, is exploited. In this regard, the following three
features are derived:

1. Assignee Name Frequency. The number
of patents filed under an assignee name a:
FFreq (a) = Freq(a,D). We assume that the
probability of a misspelling to occur multi-
ple times is low, and thus an assignee name

with a misspelled company name has a low
frequency.

2. IPC Overlap. The IPC codes of a patent
specify the technological areas it applies
to. We assume that patents filed under the
same company name are likely to share the
same set of IPC codes, regardless whether
the company name is misspelled or not.
Hence, if we determine the IPC codes of
patents which contain q in the assignee
name, IPC(q), and the IPC codes of patents
filed under assignee name a, IPC(a), then
the intersection size of the two sets serves as
an indicator for a misspelled company name
in a:

FIPC (q, a) =
IPC(q) ∩ IPC(a)
IPC(q) ∪ IPC(a)

3. Company Suffix Match. The suffix match
relies on the company suffixes Suffixes(q)
that occur in the assignee names of A con-
taining q. Similar to the IPC overlap fea-
ture, we argue that if the company suffix
of a exists in the set Suffixes(q), a mis-
spelling in a is likely: FSuffixes(q, a) = 1
iff Suffixes(a) ∈ Suffixes(q).

3.2 Webis Patent Retrieval Assignee Corpus

A key contribution of our work is a new cor-
pus called Webis Patent Retrieval Assignee Cor-
pus 2012 (Webis-PRA-12). We compiled the cor-
pus in order to assess the impact of misspelled
companies on patent retrieval and the effective-
ness of our classifier to detect them.3 The corpus
is built on the basis of 2 132 825 patents D granted
by the USPTO between 2001 and 2010; the patent
corpus is provided publicly by the USPTO in
XML format. Each patent contains bibliographic
fields as well as textual information such as the
abstract and the claims section. Since we are in-
terested in the assignee name a associated with
each patent d ∈ D, we parse each patent and ex-
tract the assignee name. This yields the set A of
202 846 different assignee names. Each assignee
name refers to a set of patents, which size varies
from 1 to 37 202 (the number of patents filed
under “International Business Machines Corpo-
ration”). It should be noted that for a portfolio

Table 4: Statistics of spelling errors for the 100 companies in the Webis-PRA-12 corpus. Considered are the
number of words and the number of letters in the company names, as well as the number of different company
suffixes that are used together with a company name (denoted as variants of q)

search task the number of patents which refer to
an assignee name matters for the computation of
precision and recall. If we, however, isolate the
task of detecting misspelled company names, then
it is also reasonable to weight each assignee name
equally and independently from the number of
patents it refers to. Both scenarios are addressed
in the experiments.

Given A, the corpus construction task is to map
each assignee name a ∈ A to the company name
q it refers to. This gives for each company name
q the set of relevant assignee names Aq. For our
corpus, we do not construct Aq for all company
names but take a selection of 100 company names
from the 2011 Fortune 500 ranking as our set of
company names Q. Since the Fortune 500 rank-
ing contains only large companies, the test cor-
pus may appear to be biased towards these com-
panies. However, rather than the company size the
structural properties of a company name are de-
terminative; our sample includes short, medium,
and long company names, as well as company
names with few, medium, and many different
company suffixes. Table 4 shows the distribution
of company names in Q along these criteria in the
first row.

For each company name q ∈ Q, we ap-
ply a semi-automated procedure to derive the
set of relevant assignee names Aq . In a first
step, all assignee names in A which do not re-
fer to the company name q are filtered auto-
matically. From a preliminary evaluation we
concluded that the Levenshtein distance d(q, a)
with a relative threshold of |q|/2 is a reasonable
choice for this filtering step. The resulting sets
A+q = {a ∈ A | d(q, a) ≤ |q|/2) contain, in total
over Q, 14 189 assignee names. These assignee
names are annotated by human assessors within a
second step to derive the final set Aq for each q ∈
Q. Altogether we identify 1 538 assignee names
that refer to the 100 companies in Q. With respect
to our classification task, the assignee names in
each Aq are positive examples; the remaining as-

signee names A+q \ Aq form the set of negative
examples (12 651 in total).

During the manual assessment, names of as-
signees which include the correct company name
q were distinguished from misspelled ones. The
latter holds true for 379 of the 1 538 assignee
names. These names are not retrievable by the
baseline system, and thus form the main target for
our classifier. The second row of Table 4 reports
on the distribution of the 379 misspelled assignee
names. As expectable, the longer the company
name, the more spelling errors occur. Compa-
nies which file patents under many different as-
signee names are likelier to have patents with mis-
spellings in the company name.

3.3 Classifier Performance

For the evaluation with the Webis-PRA-12 cor-
pus, we train a support vector machine,4 which
considers the six outlined features, and compare
it to the other expansion techniques. For the train-
ing phase, we use 2/3 of the positive examples
to form a balanced training set of 1 025 posi-
tive and 1 025 negative examples. After 10-fold
cross validation, the achieved classification accu-
racy is 95.97%.

For a comparison of the expansion techniques
on the test set, which contains the examples not
considered in the training phase, two tasks are
distinguished: finding near duplicates in assignee
names (cf. Table 5, Columns 3–5), and finding all
patents of a company (cf. Table 5, Columns 6–8).
The latter refers to the actual task of portfo-
lio search. It can be observed that the perfor-
mance improvements on both tasks are pretty sim-
ilar. The baseline expansion ∅ yields a recall
of 0.83 in the first task. The difference of 0.17
to a perfect recall can be addressed by consid-
ering query expansion techniques. If the triv-
ial expansion A is applied to the task the max-
imum recall can be achieved, which, however,

parameters.

is bought with precision close to zero. Using
the edit distance expansion A+q yields a precision
of 0.274 while keeping the recall at maximum. Fi-
nally, the machine learning expansion A∗q leads
to a dramatic improvement (cf. Table 5, bottom
lines), whereas the exploitation of patent meta-
features significantly outperforms the exclusive
use of orthography-related features; the increase
in recall which is achieved by A∗q is statistically
significant (matched pair t-test) for both tasks (as-
signee names task: t = −7.6856, df = 99,
p = 0.00; patents task: t = −2.1113, df = 99,
p = 0.037). Note that when being applied as a
single feature none of the spelling metrics (Lev-
enshtein, SoftTfIdf, Soundex) is able to achieve
a recall close to 1 without significantly impairing
the precision.

4 Distribution of Spelling Errors

Encouraged by the promising retrieval results
achieved on the Webis-PRA-12 corpus, we ex-
tend the analysis of spelling errors in patents to
the entire USPTO corpus of granted patents be-
tween 2001 and 2010. The analysis focuses on
the following two research questions:

1. Are spelling errors an increasing issue in
patents? According to Adams (2010), the
amount of spelling errors should have been
increased in the last years due to the elec-
tronic patent filing process (cf. Section 1.2).
We address this hypothesis by analyzing the
distribution of spelling errors in company
names that occur in patents granted between
2001 and 2010.

2. Are misspellings introduced deliberately in
patents? We address this question by analyz-
ing the patents with respect to the eight tech-

nological areas based on the International
Patent Classification scheme IPC: A (Hu-
man necessities), B (Performing operations;
transporting), C (Chemistry; metallurgy),
D (Textiles; paper), E (Fixed constructions),
F (Mechanical engineering; lighting; heat-
ing; weapons; blasting), G (Physics), and
H (Electricity). If spelling errors are in-
troduced accidentally, then we expect them
to be uniformly distributed across all ar-
eas. A biased distribution, on the other
hand, indicates that errors might be in-
serted deliberately.

In the following, we compile a second corpus
on the basis of the entire set A of assignee names.
In order to yield a uniform distribution of the com-
panies across years, technological areas and coun-
tries, a set of 120 assignee names is extracted for
each dimension. After the removal of duplicates,
we revised these assignee names manually in or-
der to check (and correct) their spelling. Finally,
trailing business suffixes are removed, which re-
sults in a set of 3 110 company names. For each
company name q, we generate the set A∗q as de-
scribed in Section 3.

The results of our analysis are shown in Table 6.
Table 6(a) refers to the first research question and
shows that the amount of misspellings in compa-
nies decreased over the years from 6.67% in 2001
to 4.74% in 2010 (cf. Row 3). These results let us
reject the hypothesis of Adams (2010). Neverthe-
less, the analysis provides evidence that spelling
errors are still an issue. For example, the company
identified with most spelling errors are “Konin-
klijke Philips Electronics” with 45 misspellings
in 2008, and “Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique” with 28 misspellings in 2009. The
results are consistent with our findings with re-

spect to the Fortune 500 sample (cf. Table 4),
where company names that are longer and pre-
sumably more difficult to write contain more
spelling errors.

In contrast to the uniform distribution of mis-
spellings over the years, the situation with re-
gard to the technological areas is different (cf. Ta-
ble 6(b)). Most companies are associated with
the IPC sections G and B, which both refer to
technical domains (cf. Table 6(b), Row 1). The
percentage of misspellings in these sections in-
creased compared to the spelling errors grouped
by year. A significant difference can be seen for
the sections D and E. Here, the number of as-
signed companies drops below 450 and the per-
centage of misspellings decreases significantly
from about 6% to 2.5%. These findings might
support the hypothesis that spelling errors are in-
serted deliberately in technical domains.

5 Conclusions

While researchers in the patent domain concen-
trate on retrieval models and algorithms to im-
prove the search performance, the original aspect
of our paper is that it points to a different (and or-
thogonal) research avenue: the analysis of patent

inconsistencies. With the analysis of spelling er-
rors in assignee names we made a first yet consid-
erable contribution in this respect; searches with
assignee constraints become a more sensible op-
eration. We showed how a special treatment of
spelling errors can significantly raise the effec-
tiveness of patent search. The identification of
this untapped potential, but also the utilization of
machine learning to combine patent features with
typography, form our main contributions.

Our current research broadens the application
of a patent spelling analysis. In order to iden-
tify errors that are introduced deliberately we
investigate different types of misspellings (edit
distance versus phonological). Finally, we con-
sider the analysis of acquisition histories of com-
panies as promising research direction: since
acquired companies often own granted patents,
these patents should be considered while search-
ing for the company in question in order to further
increase the recall.
