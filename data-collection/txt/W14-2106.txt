Abstract

Argument mining of online interactions is
in its infancy. One reason is the lack of
annotated corpora in this genre. To make
progress, we need to develop a principled
and scalable way of determining which
portions of texts are argumentative and
what is the nature of argumentation. We
propose a two-tiered approach to achieve
this goal and report on several initial stud-
ies to assess its potential.

1 Introduction

An increasing portion of information and opin-
ion exchange occurs in online interactions such
as discussion forums, blogs, and webpage com-
ments. This type of user-generated conversation-
al data provides a wealth of naturally occurring
arguments. Argument mining of online interac-
tions, however, is still in its infancy (Abbott et al.,
2011; Biran and Rambow, 2011; Yin et al., 2012;
Andreas et al., 2012; Misra and Walker, 2013).
One reason is the lack of annotated corpora in this
genre. To make progress, we need to develop a
principled and scalable way of determining which
portions of texts are argumentative and what is the
nature of argumentation.

We propose a multi-step coding approach
grounded in findings from argumentation re-
search on managing the difficulties of coding ar-
guments (Meyers and Brashers, 2010). In the first
step, trained expert annotators identify basic ar-
gumentative features (coarse-grained analysis) in
full-length threads. In the second step, we explore
the feasibility of using crowdsourcing and novice
annotators to identify finer details and nuances of
the basic argumentative units focusing on limited
thread context. Our coarse-grained scheme for ar-
gumentation is based on Pragmatic Argumentation
Theory (PAT) (Van Eemeren et al., 1993; Hutchby,

Figure 1: Argumentative annotation of an Online
Thread

2013; Maynard, 1985). PAT states that an argu-
ment can arise at any point when two or more
actors engage in calling out and making prob-
lematic some aspect of another actor’s prior con-
tribution for what it (could have) said or meant
(Van Eemeren et al., 1993). The argumentative
relationships among contributions to a discussion
are indicated through links between what is tar-
geted and how it is called-out. Figure 1 shows
an example of two Callouts that refer back to the
same Target.

The annotation task performed by the trained
annotators includes three subtasks that Peldszus
and Stede (2013a) identify as part of the argu-
ment mining problem: 1) Segmentation, 2) Seg-
ment classification, and 3) Relationship identifi-
cation. In the language of Peldszus and Stede
(2013a), Callouts and Targets are the basic Argu-
ment Discourse Units (ADUs) that are segmented,
classified, and linked. There are two key advan-
tages of our coarse-grained annotation scheme:
1) It does not initially prescribe what constitutes
an argumentative text; 2) It makes it possible for
Expert Annotators (EAs) to find ADUs in long

39



threads. Assigning finer grained (more complex)
labels would have unduly increased the already
heavy cognitive load for the EAs. In Section
2 we present the corpus, describe the annotation
scheme and task, calculate Inter Annotator Agree-
ment (IAA), and propose a hierarchical clustering
approach to identify text segments that the EAs
found easier or harder to annotate.

In Section 3, we report on two Amazon
Mechanical Turk (MTurk) experiments, which
demonstrate that crowdsourcing is a feasible way
to obtain finer grained annotations of basic ADUs,
especially on the text segments that were easier
for the EAs to code. In the first crowd sourc-
ing study, the Turkers (the workers at MTurk,
who we consider novice annotators) assigned la-
bels (Agree/Disagree/Other) to the relations be-
tween Callout and Target identified by the EAs.
In the second study, Turkers labeled segments of
Callouts as Stance or Rationale. Turkers saw only
a limited context of the threaded discussion, i.e.
a particular Callout-Target pair identified by the
EA(s) who had analyzed the entire thread. In addi-
tion we report on initial classification experiments
to detect agreement/disagreement, with the best
F1 of 66.9% for the Agree class and 62.6% for the
Disagree class.

2 Expert Annotation for Coarse-Grained
Argumentation

Within Pragmatic Argumentation Theory, argu-
mentation refers to the ways in which people (seek
to) make some prior action or antecedent event
disputable by performing challenges, contradic-
tions, negations, accusations, resistance, and other
behaviors that call out a ’Target’, a prior action
or event. In this section, we present the corpus,
the annotation scheme based on PAT and the an-
notation task, the inter-annotator agreement, and a
method to identify which pieces of text are easier
or harder to annotate using a hierarchical cluster-
ing approach.

2.1 Corpus

Our corpus consists of blog comments posted as
responses to four blog postings selected from a
dataset crawled from Technorati between 2008-
2010 1. We selected blog postings in the general
topic of technology and considered only postings

1http://technorati.com/blogs/directory/

that had more than 200 comments. For the an-
notation we selected the first one hundred com-
ments on each blog together with the original post-
ing. Each blog together with its comments con-
stitutes a thread. The topics of each thread are:
Android (comparison of features of iPhone and
Android phones), iPad (the usefulness of iPads),
Twitter (the usefulness of Twitter as a microblog-
ging platform), and Layoffs (downsizing and out-
sourcing efforts of technology companies). We re-
fer to these threads as the argumentative corpus.
We plan to make the corpus available to the re-
search community.

2.2 Annotation Scheme and Expert
Annotation Task

The coarse-grained annotation scheme for argu-
mentation is based on the concept of Callout and
Target of Pragmatic Argumentation Theory. The
experts’ annotation task was to identify expres-
sions of Callout and their Targets while also indi-
cating the links between them. We prepared a set
of guidelines with careful definitions of all techni-
cal terms. The following is an abbreviated excerpt
from the guidelines:

• Callout: A Callout is a subsequent action
that selects (i.e., refers back to) all or some
part of a prior action (i.e., Target) and com-
ments on it in some way. In addition to re-
ferring back to the Target, a Callout explic-
itly includes either one or both of the fol-
lowing: Stance (indication of attitude or posi-
tion relative to the Target) and Rationale (ar-
gument/justification/explanation of the Stance
taken).

• Target: A Target is a part of a prior action that
has been called out by a subsequent action.

Fig. 1 shows two examples of Callouts from
two comments referring back to the same Target.
Annotators were instructed to mark any text seg-
ment (from words to entire comments) that sat-
isfied the definitions above. A single text seg-
ment could be a Target and a Callout. To per-form
the expert annotation, we hired five graduate stu-
dents who had a strong background in humanities
and who received extensive training for the task.
The EAs performed three annotation subtasks
mentioned by Peldszus and Stede (2013a): Seg-
mentation (identify the Argumentative Dis-course

Units (ADUs) including their boundaries), Seg-
ment classification (label the roles of the ADUs,
in this case Callout and Target) and relation iden-
tification (indicate the link between a Callout and
the most recent Target to which is a response).

The segmentation task, which Artstein and Poe-
sio (2008) refer to as the unitization problem, is
particularly challenging. Table 1 shows extensive
variation in the number of ADUs (Callout in this
case) identified by the EAs for each of the four
threads. Annotator A1 identified the fewest Call-
outs (72) while A4 and A5 identified the most
(112.3 and 116, respectively). Although these dif-
ferences could be due to the issues with training,
we interpret the consistent variation among coders
as an indication that judges can be characterized
as “lumpers” or “splitters”. What lumpers con-
sidered a single long unit was treated as two (or
more) shorter units by splitters. This is an example
of the problem of annotator variability discussed
in (Peldszus and Stede, 2013b). Similar behavior
was noticed for Targets. 2

2.3 Inter Annotator Agreement

Since the annotation task includes the segmen-
tation step, to measure the IAA we have to ac-
count for fuzzy boundaries. Thus, we con-sider
two IAA metrics usually used in literature for
such cases: the information retrieval (IR) in-spired
precision-recall (P/R/F1) measure (Wiebe et al.,
2005) and Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 2004).
We present here the main results; a detailed dis-
cussion of the IAA is left for a different paper. Fol-
lowing Wiebe et al. (2005), to calculate P/R/F1 for
two annotators, one annotator’s ADUs are selected

2Due to space limitations, here and in the rest of this paper
we report only on Callouts.

as the gold standard. If more than two annotators
are employed, the IAA is the average of the pair-
wise P/R/F1. To determine if two annotators have
selected the same text span to represent an ADU,
we use the two methods of Somasundaran et al.
(2008): exact match (EM) - text spans that vary
at the start or end point by five characters or less,
and overlap match (OM) - text spans that have at
least 10% of same overlapping characters. Table 2
shows the F1 measure for EM and OM for the five
EAs on each of the four threads. As expected, the
F1 measures are much lower for EM than for OM.

For the second IAA metric, we implement
Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 2004), where the
character overlap between any two annotations
and the gap between them are utilized to mea-
sure the expected disagreement and the observed
disagreement. Table 2 shows α values for each
thread, which means significant agreement.

While the above metrics show reasonable agree-
ment across annotators, they do not tell us what
pieces of text are easier or harder to annotate. In
the next section we report on a hierarchical cluster-
ing technique that makes it possible to assess how
difficult it is to identify individual text segments as
Callouts.

2.4 Clustering of Callout ADUs

We use a hierarchical clustering technique (Hastie
et al., 2009) to cluster ADUs that are variants of
the same Callout. Each ADU starts in its own clus-
ter. The start and end points of each ADU are uti-
lized to identify overlapping characters in pairs of
ADUs. Then, using a “bottom up” clustering ap-
proach, two ADUs (in this case, pairs of Callouts)
that share overlapping characters are merged into
a cluster. This process continues until no more
text segments can be merged. Clusters with five
overlapping ADUs include a text segment that all
five annotators have labeled as a Callout, while
clusters with one ADU indicates that only one an-
notator classified the text segment as a Callout
(see Table 3). These numbers provide information
about what segments of text are easier or harder to
code. For instance, when a cluster contains only
two ADUs, it means that three of the five anno-
tators did not label the text segment as a Callout.
Our MTurk study of Stance/Rationale (Sec. 3.2)
could highlight one reason for the variation – some
coders consider a segment of text as Callout when
an implicit Stance is present, while others do not.

Table 4: Number of clusters for each cluster type

Table 4 shows the number of Callout clusters in
each thread. The number of clusters with five and
four annotators shows that in each thread there are
Callouts that are plausibly easier to identify. On
the other hand, the clusters selected by only one
or two annotators are harder to identify.

3 Crowdsourcing for Fine-grained
Argumentation

To understand better the nature of the ADUs, we
conducted two studies asking Turkers to perform
finer grained analysis of Callouts and Targets. Our
first study asked five Turkers to label the relation
between a Callout and its corresponding Target
as Agree, Disagree, or Other. The Other relation
may be selected in a situation where the Callout
has no relationship with the Target (e.g., a pos-
sible digression) or is in a type of argumentative
relationship that is difficult to classify as either
Agreement or Disagreement. The second study
asked five Turkers to identify Stance and Ratio-
nale in Callouts identified by EAs. As discussed
in Section 2, by definition, a Callout contains an
explicit instance of Stance, Rationale or both. In
both of these crowdsourcing studies the Turkers
were shown only a limited portion of the threaded
discussion, i.e. the Callout-Target pairs that the
EAs had linked.

Crowdsourcing is becoming a popular mecha-

nism to collect annotations and other type of data
for natural language processing research (Wang
and Callison-Burch, 2010; Snow et al., 2008;
Chen and Dolan, 2011; Post et al., 2012). Crowd-
sourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) provide a flexible framework to sub-
mit various types of NLP tasks where novice anno-
tators (Turkers) can generate content (e.g., transla-
tions, paraphrases) or annotations (labeling) in an
inexpensive way and with limited training. MTurk
also provides researchers with the ability to con-
trol the quality of the Turkers, based on their past
performances. Section 3.1 and 3.2 describe our
two crowdsourcing studies for fine grain argumen-
tation annotation.

3.1 Crowdsourcing Study 1: Labeling the
Relation between Callout and Target

In this study, the Turkers’ task was to assign a rela-
tion type between a Callout and its associated Tar-
get. The choices were Agree, Disagree, or Other.
Turkers were provided with detailed instructions,
including multiple examples of Callout and Target
pairs and their relation type. Each HIT (Human
Intelligence Task, in the language of MTurk) con-
tained one Callout-Target pair and Turkers were
paid 2 cents per HIT. To assure a level of qual-
ity control, only qualified Turkers were allowed
to perform the task (i.e., Master level with more
than 95% approval rate and at least 500 approved
HITs).

For this experiment, we randomly selected a
Callout from each cluster, along with its corre-
sponding Target. Our assumption is that all Call-
out ADUs in a given cluster have the same relation
type to their Targets (see Table 3). While this as-
sumption is logical, we plan to fully investigate it

42



in future work by running an MTurk experiment
on all the Callout ADUs and their corresponding
Targets.

We utilized Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) to
compute IAA between the Turkers (every HIT
was completed by five Turkers). Kappa is be-
tween 0.45-0.55 for each thread showing moder-
ate agreement between the Turkers (Landis et al.,
1977). These agreement results are in line with the
agreement noticed in previous studies on agree-
ment/disagreement annotations in online interac-
tions (Bender et al., 2011; Abbott et al., 2011).
To select a gold standard for the relation type, we
used majority voting. That is, if three or more
Turkers agreed on a label, we selected that label
as the gold standard. In cases where there was
no majority, we assigned the label Other. The to-
tal number of Callouts that are in agreement and
in disagreement with Targets are 143 and 153, re-
spectively.

Table 5 shows the percentage of each
type of relation identified by Turkers
(Agree/Disagree/Other) for clusters annotated by
different number of EAs. The results suggest
that there is a correlation between text segments
that are easier or harder to annotate by EAs with
the ability of novice annotators to identify an
Agree/Disagree relation type between Callout and
Target. For example, Turkers generally discovered
Agree/Disagree relations between Callouts and
their Targets when the Callouts are part of those
clusters that are annotated by a higher number
of EAs. Turkers identified 57% as showing
a disagreement relation between Callout and
Target, and 39% as showing an agreement relation
(clusters with 5 EAs). For those clusters, only
4% of the Callouts are labeled as having an Other
relation with the Target. For clusters selected
by fewer EAs, however, the number of Callouts
having a relation with the Target labeled as Other
is much higher (39% for clusters with two EAs
and 32% for clusters with one EA). These results
show that those Callouts that are easier to discover
(i.e., identified by all five EAs) mostly have a
relation with the Target (Agree or Disagree) that
is clearly expressed and thus recognizable to the
Turkers. Table 5 also shows that in some cases
even if some EAs agreed on a piece of text to be
considered as a Callout, the novice annotators
assigned the Other relation to the Callout and Tar-
get ADUs. There are two possible explanations:

Relation label # of EA ADUs per cluster
5 4 3 2 1

Agree 39.36 43.33 42.50 35.48 48.39
Disagree 56.91 31.67 32.50 25.81 19.35

Other 3.72 25.00 25.00 38.71 32.26

Table 5: Percentage of Relation labels per EA
cluster type

either the novice annotators could not detect an
implicit agreement or disagreement and thus they
selected Other, or there are other types of relations
besides Agreement and Disagreement between
Callouts and their corresponding Targets. We
plan to extend this study to other fine grained
relation types in future work. In the next section
we discuss the results of building a supervised
classifier to predict the Agree or Disagree relation
type between Callout/Target pairs.

3.1.1 Predicting the Agree/Disagree Relation
Label

We propose a supervised learning setup to clas-
sify the relation types of Callout-Target pairs. The
classification categories are the labels collected
from the MTurk experiment. We only consider
the Agree and Disagree categories since the Other
category has a very small number of instances
(53). Based on the annotations from the Turkers,
we have 143 Agree and 153 Disagree training in-
stances.

We first conducted a simple baseline exper-
iment to check whether participants use words
or phrases to express explicit agreement or dis-
agreement such as ‘I agree’, ‘I disagree’. We
collected two small lists (twenty words each)
of words from Merriam-Webster dictionary that
explicitly represent agreement and disagreement
Stances. The agreement list contains the word
‘agree’ and its synonyms such as ‘accept’, ‘con-
cur’, and ‘accede’. The disagreement list con-
tains the word ‘disagree’ and synonyms such as
‘differ’ and ‘dissent’. We then checked whether
the text of the Callouts contains these explicit
agreement/disagreement markers. Note, that these
markers are utilized as rules and no statistical
learning is involved in this stage of experiment.

The first row of the Table 6 represents the base-
line results. Though the precision is high for
agreement category, the recall is quite low and that
results in a poor overall F1 measure. This shows
that even though markers like ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’

are very precise, they occur in less than 15% of
all the Callouts expressing agreement or disagree-
ment.

For the next set of experiments we used a super-
vised machine learning approach for the two-way
classification (Agree/Disagree). We use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) as our machine-learning
algorithm for classification as implemented in
Weka (Hall et al., 2009) and ran 10-fold cross val-
idation. As a SVM baseline, we first use all un-
igrams in Callout and Target as features (Table
6, Row 2). We notice that the recall improves
significantly when compared with the rule-based
method. To further improve the classification ac-
curacy, we use Mutual Information (MI) to se-
lect the words in the Callouts and Targets that are
likely to be associated with the categories Agree
and Disagree, respectively. Specifically, we sort
each word based on its MI value and then se-
lect the first 180 words in each of the two cate-
gories to represent our new vocabulary set of 360
words. The feature vector includes only words
present in the MI list. Compared to the all uni-
grams baseline, the MI-based unigrams improve
the F1 by 4% (Agree) and 2% (Disagree) (Table
6). The MI approach discovers the words that
are highly associated with Agree/Disagree cate-
gories and these words turn to be useful features
for classification. In addition, we consider several
types of lexical features (LexF) inspired by previ-
ous work on agreement and disagreement (Galley
et al., 2004; Misra and Walker, 2013).

• Sentiment Lexicon (SL): Two features are de-
signed using a sentiment lexicon (Hu and Liu,
2004) where the first feature represents the num-
ber of times the Callout and the Target contain a
positive emotional word and the second feature
represents the number of the negative emotional
words.

• Initial unigrams in Callout (IU): Instead of
using all unigrams in the Callout and Target,

Features Category P R F1
LexF Agree 61.4 73.4 66.9

Disagree 69.6 56.9 62.6
LexF-SL Agree 60.6 74.1 66.7

Disagree 69.4 54.9 61.3
LexF-IU Agree 58.1 69.9 63.5

Disagree 65.3 52.9 58.5
LexF-LO Agree 57.2 74.8 64.8

Disagree 67.0 47.7 55.7

Table 7: Importance of Lexical Features

we only select the first words from the Call-
out (maximum ten). The assumption is that the
stance is generally expressed at the beginning
of a Callout. We used the same MI-based tech-
nique to filter any sparse words.

• Lexical Overlap and Length (LO): This set of
features represents the lexical overlap between
the Callout and the Target and the length of each
ADU.

Table 6 shows that using all these types of
lexical features improves the F1 score for both
categories as compared to the MI-based unigram
features. Table 7 shows the impact of remov-
ing each type of lexical features. From these re-
sults it seems that initial unigrams of Callout (IU)
and lexical overlap (LO) are useful features: re-
moving each of them lowers the results for both
Agree/Disagree categories. In future work, we
plan to explore context-based features such as the
thread structure, and semantic features such as
WordNet-based semantic similarity. We also hy-
pothesize that with additional training instances
the ML approaches will achieve better results.

3.2 Crowdsourcing Study 2: Analysis of
Stance and Rationale

In the second study aimed at identifying the ar-
gumentative nature of the Callouts identified by
the expert annotators, we focus on identifying the
Stance and Rationale segments of a Callout. Since
the presence of at least an explicit Stance or Ra-
tionale was part of the definition of a Callout, we
selected these two argumentation categories as our
finer-grained scheme for this experiment.

Given a pair of Callout and Target ADUs, five
Turkers were asked to identify the Stance and Ra-
tionale segments in the Callout, including the ex-
act boundaries of the text segments. Identifying
Stance and Rationale is a difficult task and thus,
we also asked Turkers to mark the level of diffi-
culty in the identification task. We provided the

Table 8: Difficulty judgments by Turkers com-
pared to number of EAs who selected a cluster

Turkers with a scale of difficulty (similar to a Lik-
ert scale), where the Turkers have to choose one
of the following: very easy (VE), easy (E), moder-
ate (M), difficult (D), very difficult (VD), too diffi-
cult to code (TD). Turkers were instructed to select
the too difficult to code choice only in cases where
they felt it was impossible to detect a Stance or
Rationale in the Callout.

The Turkers were provided with detailed in-
structions including examples of Stance and Ra-
tionale annotations for multiple Callouts and only
highly qualified Turkers were allowed to perform
the task. Unlike the previous study, we also ran a
pre-screening testing phase and only Turkers that
passed the screening were allowed to complete the
tasks. Because of the difficult nature of the anno-
tation task, we paid ten cents per HIT.

For the Stance/Rationale study, we considered
all the Callouts in each cluster along with the asso-
ciated Targets. We selected all the Callouts from
each cluster because of variability in the bound-
aries of ADUs, i.e., in the segmentation process.
One benefit of this crowdsourcing experiment is
that it helps us understand better what the variabil-
ity means in terms of argumentative structure. For
example, one EA might mark a text segment as a
Callout only when it expresses a Stance, while an-
other EA might mark as Callout a larger piece of
text expressing both the Stance and Rationale (See
examples of Clusters in Table 3). We leave this
deeper analysis as future work.

Table 8 shows there is a correlation between
the number of EAs who selected a cluster and the
difficulty level Turkers assigned to identifying the
Stance and Rationale elements of a Callout. This
table shows that for more than 50% of the Callouts
that are identified by 5 EAs, the Stance and Ra-
tionale can be easily identified (refer to the ‘VE’
and ‘E’ rows), where as in the case of Callouts
that are identified by only 1 EA, the number is

outs in that same category (1 EA) were labeled as
‘Too difficult to code’, indicating that the Turk-
ers could not identify either a Stance or Rationale
in the Callout. These numbers are comparable to
what our first crowdsourcing study showed for the
Agree/Disagree/Other relation identification (Ta-
ble 5). Table 9 shows results where we selected
overall difficulty level by majority voting. We
combined the easy and very easy categories to the
category easy (E) and the difficult and very diffi-
cult categories to the category difficult (D) for a
simpler presentation.

Table 9 also shows that more than 80% of the
time, Turkers could easily identify Stance and/or
Rationale in Callouts identified by 5 EAs, while
they could perform the finer grained analysis eas-
ily only 25% of time for Callouts identified by a
single EA. Only 5% of Callouts identified by all
5 EAs were considered too difficult to code by the
Turkers (i.e., the novice annotators could not iden-
tify a Stance or a Rationale). In contrast, more
than 37% of Callouts annotated only by 1 EA were
considered too difficult to code by the novice an-
notators. Table 10 presents some of the examples
of Stance and Rationale pairs as selected by the
Turkers along with the difficulty labels.

Primary tasks for argument analysis are to seg-
ment the text to identify ADUs, detect the roles
of each ADUs, and to establish the relationship
between the ADUs (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a).
Similarly, Cohen (1987) presented a computa-
tional model of argument analysis where the struc-
ture of each argument is restricted to the claim and
evidence relation. Teufel et al. (2009) introduce
the argumentative zoning (AZ) idea that identifies
important sections of scientific articles and later
Hachey and Grover (2005) applied similar idea of
AZ to summarize legal documents. Wyner et al.
(2012) propose a rule-based tool that can high-
light potential argumentative sections of text ac-
cording to discourse cues like ‘suppose’ or ‘there-
fore’. They tested their system on product reviews

Relatively little attention has so far been de-
voted to the issue of building argumentative cor-
pora from naturally occurring texts (Peldszus and
Stede, 2013a; Feng and Hirst, 2011). However,
(Reed et al., 2008; Reed and Rowe, 2004) have
developed the Araucaria project that maintains
an online repository of arguments (AraucariaDB),
which recently has been used as research cor-
pus for several automatic argumentation analyses
(Palau and Moens, 2009; Wyner et al., 2010; Feng
and Hirst, 2011). Our work contributes a new prin-
cipled method for building annotated corpora for
online interactions. The corpus and guidelines will
also be shared with the research community.

Another line of research that is correlated with
ours is recognition of agreement/disagreement
(Misra and Walker, 2013; Yin et al., 2012; Ab-
bott et al., 2011; Andreas et al., 2012; Galley et
al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003) and classification of
stances (Walker et al., 2012; Somasundaran and
Wiebe, 2010) in online forums. For future work,
we can utilize textual features (contextual, depen-
dency, discourse markers), relevant multiword ex-
pressions and topic modeling (Mukherjee and Liu,
2013), and thread structure (Murakami and Ray-
mond, 2010; Agrawal et al., 2003) to improve the
Agree/Disagree classification accuracy.

Recently, Cabrio and Villata (2013) proposed
a new direction of argumentative analysis where
the authors show how arguments are associated
with Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) re-
search. They utilized RTE approach to detect the
relation of support/attack among arguments (en-
tailment expresses a ‘support’ and contradiction

expresses an ‘attack’) on a dataset of arguments
collected from online debates (e.g., Debatepedia).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

To make progress in argument mining for online
interactions, we need to develop a principled and
scalable way to determine which portions of texts
are argumentative and what is the nature of argu-
mentation. We have proposed a two-tiered ap-
proach to achieve this goal. As a first step we
adopted a coarse-grained annotation scheme based
on Pragmatic Argumentation Theory and asked
expert annotators to label entire threads using this
scheme. Using a clustering technique we iden-
tified which pieces of text were easier or harder
for the Expert Annotators to annotate. Then we
showed that crowdsourcing is a feasible approach
to obtain annotations based on a finer grained ar-
gumentation scheme, especially on text segments
that were easier for the Expert Annotators to la-
bel as being argumentative. While more qualita-
tive analysis of these results is still needed, these
results are an example of the potential benefits of
our multi-step coding approach.

Avenues for future research include but are not
limited to: 1) analyzing the differences between
the stance and rationale annotations among the
novice annotators; 2) improving the classification
accuracies of the Agree/Disagree classifier using
more training data; 3) using syntax and seman-
tics inspired textual features and thread structure;
and 4) developing computational models to detect
Stance and Rationale.
