Abstract

This paper describes our system for Task 11
of SemEval-2013. In the task, participants
are provided with a set of ambiguous search
queries and the snippets returned by a search
engine, and are asked to associate senses with
the snippets. The snippets are then clus-
tered using the sense assignments and sys-
tems are evaluated based on the quality of the
snippet clusters. Our system adopts a pre-
existing Word Sense Induction (WSI) method-
ology based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
(HDP), a non-parametric topic model. Our
system is trained over extracts from the full
text of English Wikipedia, and is shown to per-
form well in the shared task.

1 Introduction

The basic premise behind research on word sense
disambiguation (WSD) is that there exists a static,
discrete set of word senses that can be used to la-
bel distinct usages of a given word (Agirre and Ed-
monds, 2006; Navigli, 2009). There are various pit-
falls underlying this premise, including: (1) what
sense inventory is appropriate for a particular task
(given that sense inventories can vary considerably
in their granularity and partitioning of word usages)?
(2) given that word senses tend to take the form of
prototypes, is discrete labelling a felicitous represen-
tation of word usages, especially for non-standard
word usages? (3) how should novel word usages be
captured under this model? and (4) given the rapid
pace of language evolution on real-time social me-
dia such as Twitter and Facebook, is it reasonable

to assume a static sense inventory? Given this back-
drop, there has been a recent growth of interest in the
task of word sense induction (WSI), where the word
sense representation for a given word is automati-
cally inferred from a given data source, and word
usages are labelled (often probabilistically) accord-
ing to that data source. While WSI has considerable
appeal as a task, intrinsic cross-comparison of WSI
systems is fraught with many of the same issues as
WSD (Agirre and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar et al.,
2010), leading to a move towards task-based WSI
evaluation, such as in Task 11 of SemEval-2013, ti-
tled “Evaluating Word Sense Induction & Disam-
biguation within an End-User Application”.

This paper presents the UNIMELB system entry to
SemEval-2013 Task 11. Our method is based heav-
ily on the WSI methodology proposed by Lau et
al. (2012) for novel word sense detection. Largely
the same methodology was also applied to SemEval-
2013 Task 13 on WSI (Lau et al., to appear).

2 System Description

Our system is based on the WSI methodology pro-
posed by Lau et al. (2012) for the task of novel word
sense detection. The core machinery of our sys-
tem is driven by a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
topic model (Blei et al., 2003). In LDA, the model
learns latent topics for a collection of documents,
and associates these latent topics with every docu-
ment in the collection. A topic is represented by
a multinomial distribution of words, and the asso-
ciation of topics with documents is represented by a
multinomial distribution of topics, with one distribu-
tion per document. The generative process of LDA

217



for drawing word w in document d is as follows:

1. draw latent topic z from document d;

2. draw word w from the chosen latent topic z.

The probability of selecting word w given a doc-
ument d is thus given by:

P (w|d) =
T∑

z=1

P (w|t = z)P (t = z|d).

where t is the topic variable, and T is the number of
topics.

The number of topics, T , is a parameter in LDA,
and the model tends to be highly sensitive to this set-
ting. To remove the need for parameter tuning over
development data, we make use of a non-parametric
variant of LDA, in the form of a Hierarchical Dirich-
let Process (HDP: Teh et al. (2006)). HDP learns the
number of topics based on data, and the concentra-
tion parameters γ and α0 control the variability of
topics in the documents (for details of HDP please
refer to the original paper, Teh et al. (2006)).

To apply HDP in the context of WSI, the latent
topics are interpreted as the word senses, and the
documents are usages that contain the target word of
interest (or search query in the case of Task 11). That
is, given a search query (e.g. Prince of Persia), a
“document” in our application is a sentence/snippet
containing the target word. In addition to the bag of
words surrounding the target word, we also include
positional context word information, as used in the
original methodology of Lau et al. (2012). That is,
we introduce an additional word feature for each of
the three words to the left and right of the target
word. An example of the topic model features for
a context sentence is given in Table 1.

2.1 Background Corpus and Preprocessing

As part of the task setup, we were provided with
snippets for each search query, constituting the doc-
uments for the topic model for that query (each
search query is topic-modelled separately). Our sys-
tem uses only the text of the snippets as features, and
ignores the URL information. The text of the snip-
pets is tokenised and lemmatised using OpenNLP
and Morpha (Minnen et al., 2001).

As there are only 64 snippets for each query in
the test dataset, which is very small by topic mod-
elling standards, we turn to English Wikipedia to
expand the data, by extracting all context sentences
that contain the search query in the full collection
of Wikipedia articles.1 Each extracted usage is a
three-sentence context containing the search query:
the original sentence that contains the actual usage
and its preceding and succeeding sentences. The
extraction of usages from Wikipedia significantly
increases the amount of information for the topic
model to learn the senses for the search queries. To
give an estimate: for very ambiguous queries such
as queen we extracted almost 150,000 usages from
Wikipedia; for most queries, however, this number
tends to be a few thousand usages.

To summarise, for each search query we apply the
HDP model to the combined collection of the 64
snippets and the extracted usages from Wikipedia.
The topic model learns the senses/topics for all
documents in the collection, but we only use the
sense/topic distribution for the 64 snippets as they
are the documents that are evaluated in the shared
task.

Our English Wikipedia collection is tokenised and
lemmatised using OpenNLP and Morpha (Minnen et
al., 2001). The search queries provided in the task,
however, are not lemmatised. Two approaches are
used to extract the usages of search queries from
Wikipedia:

HDP-CLUSTERS-LEMMA Search queries are lem-
matised using Morpha (Minnen et al., 2001),
and both the original and lemmatised forms are
used for extraction;2

HDP-CLUSTERS-NOLEMMA Search queries are
not lemmatised and only their original forms
are used for extraction.

1The Wikipedia dump was retrieved on November 28th
2009.

2Morpha requires the part-of-speech (POS) of a given word,
which is determined by the majority POS aggregated over all of
that word’s occurrences in Wikipedia.

3 Experiments and Results

Following Lau et al. (2012), we use the default pa-
rameters (γ = 0.1 and α0 = 1.0) for HDP.3 For each
search query, we apply HDP to induce the senses,
and a distribution of senses is produced for each
“document” in the model. As the snippets in the test
dataset correspond to the documents in the model
and evaluation is based on “hard” clusters of snip-
pets, we assign a sense to each snippet based on the
sense (= topic) which has the highest probability for
that snippet.

The task requires participants to produce a ranked
list of snippets for each induced sense, based on the
relative fit between the snippet and the sense. We in-
duce the ranking based on the sense probabilities as-
signed to the senses, such that snippets that have the
highest probability of the induced sense are ranked
highest, and snippets with lower sense probabilities

are ranked lower.
Two classes of evaluation are used in the shared

task:

1. cluster quality measures: Jaccard Index (JI),
RandIndex (RI), Adjusted RandIndex (ARI)
and F1;

2. diversification of search results: Subtopic Re-
call@K and Subtopic Precision@r.

Details of the evaluation measures are described in
Navigli and Vannella (2013).

The idea behind the second form of evaluation
(i.e. diversification of search results) is that search
engine results should cluster the results based on
senses (of the query term in the documents) given an
ambiguous query. For example, if a user searches for
apple, the search engine may return results related to
both the computer brand sense and the fruit sense of
apple. Given this assumption, the best WSI/WSD
system is the one that can correctly identify the di-
versity of senses in the snippets.

Cluster quality, subtopic recall@K and subtopic
precision@r results for all systems entered in the
task are presented in Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2,
respectively.

In terms of cluster quality, our systems
(HDP-CLUSTERS-LEMMA and HDP-CLUSTERS-
NOLEMMA) consistently outperform the other teams
for all measures except for the Jaccard Index (where
we rank second and third, by a narrow margin). The
average number of induced clusters and the average
cluster size of our systems are similar to those
of the gold standard system (GOLD), indicating
that our systems are learning an appropriate sense
granularity.

In terms of diversification of search results, our
systems perform markedly better than most teams,
other than RAKESH which trails closely behind our
systems (despite a relatively low ranking in terms of
the cluster quality evaluation). Overall, the results
are encouraging and our system performs very well
over the task.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

Our system adopts the WSI system proposed in Lau
et al. (2012) with no parameters tuned for this task,

and performs very well over it. Parameter tuning and
exploiting URL information in the snippets could
potentially boost the system performance further.
Other background corpora (such as news articles)
could also be used to increase the size of the training
data. We leave these ideas for future work.

Inspecting the difference between the HDP-
CLUSTERS-LEMMA and HDP-CLUSTERS-
NOLEMMA approaches, only 6 out of the 100
lemmas have a lemmatised form which differs from
the original query composition: pods (pod), ten
commandments (ten commandment), guild wars
(guild war), stand by me (stand by i), sisters of
mercy (sister of mercy) and lord of the flies (lord of
the fly). In most cases, including the lemmatised
query results in the extraction of additional useful
usages, e.g. using only the original form lord of
the flies would extract no usages from Wikipedia
(because this corpus has itself been lemmatised).
In other cases, however, including the lemmatised
forms results in many common noun usages, e.g.
the number of usages of the lemmatised pod is
significantly greater than that of the original form
pods (which corresponds to proper noun usages in
the lemmatised corpus), resulting in senses being
induced only for common noun usages of pods. The

advantages and disadvantages of both approaches
are reflected in the results: performance is mixed
and no one method clearly outperforms the other.

To conclude, we apply a topic model-based WSI
methodology to the task of web result clustering, us-
ing English Wikipedia as an external resource for ex-
tracting additional usages. Our system is completely
unsupervised and requires no annotated resources,
and appears to perform very well on the task.
