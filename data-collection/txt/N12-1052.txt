Abstract

It has been established that incorporating word
cluster features derived from large unlabeled
corpora can significantly improve prediction of
linguistic structure. While previous work has
focused primarily on English, we extend these
results to other languages along two dimen-
sions. First, we show that these results hold
true for a number of languages across families.
Second, and more interestingly, we provide an
algorithm for inducing cross-lingual clusters
and we show that features derived from these
clusters significantly improve the accuracy of
cross-lingual structure prediction. Specifically,
we show that by augmenting direct-transfer sys-
tems with cross-lingual cluster features, the rel-
ative error of delexicalized dependency parsers,
trained on English treebanks and transferred
to foreign languages, can be reduced by up to
13%. When applying the same method to di-
rect transfer of named-entity recognizers, we
observe relative improvements of up to 26%.

1 Introduction

The ability to predict the linguistic structure of sen-
tences or documents is central to the field of nat-
ural language processing (NLP). Structures such as
named-entity tag sequences (Bikel et al., 1999) or sen-
timent relations (Pang and Lee, 2008) are inherently
useful in data mining, information retrieval and other
user-facing technologies. More fundamental struc-
tures such as part-of-speech tag sequences (Ratna-
parkhi, 1996) or syntactic parse trees (Collins, 1997;
Kübler et al., 2009), on the other hand, comprise the
core linguistic analysis for many important down-
stream tasks such as machine translation (Chiang,

2005; Collins et al., 2005). Currently, supervised
data-driven methods dominate the literature on lin-
guistic structure prediction (Smith, 2011). Regret-
tably, the majority of studies on these methods have
focused on evaluations specific to English, since it is
the language with the most annotated resources. No-
table exceptions include the CoNLL shared tasks
(Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003; Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre
et al., 2007) and subsequent studies on this data, as
well as a number of focused studies on one or two
specific languages, as discussed by Bender (2011).

While annotated resources for parsing and several
other tasks are available in a number of languages, we
cannot expect to have access to labeled resources for
all tasks in all languages. This fact has given rise to
a large body of research on unsupervised (Klein and
Manning, 2004), semi-supervised (Koo et al., 2008)
and transfer (Hwa et al., 2005) systems for prediction
of linguistic structure. These methods all attempt to
benefit from the plethora of unlabeled monolingual
and/or cross-lingual data that has become available
in the digital age. Unsupervised methods are ap-
pealing in that they are often inherently language
independent. This is borne out by the many recent
studies on unsupervised parsing that include evalu-
ations covering a number of languages (Cohen and
Smith, 2009; Gillenwater et al., 2010; Naseem et al.,
2010; Spitkovsky et al., 2011). However, the perfor-
mance for most languages is still well below that of
supervised systems and recent work has established
that the performance is also below simple methods
of linguistic transfer (McDonald et al., 2011).

In this study we focus on semi-supervised and
linguistic-transfer methods for multilingual structure
prediction. In particular, we pursue two lines of re-
search around the use of word cluster features in
discriminative models for structure prediction:

1. Monolingual word cluster features induced from
large corpora of text for semi-supervised learn-
ing (SSL) of linguistic structure. Previous stud-
ies on this approach have typically focused only
on a small set of languages and tasks (Freitag,
2004; Miller et al., 2004; Koo et al., 2008;
Turian et al., 2010; Faruqui and Padó, 2010; Haf-
fari et al., 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2011). Here
we show that this method is robust across 13 lan-
guages for dependency parsing and 4 languages
for named-entity recognition (NER). This is the
first study with such a broad view on this subject,
in terms of language diversity.

2. Cross-lingual word cluster features for transfer-
ring linguistic structure from English to other
languages. We develop an algorithm that gener-
ates cross-lingual word clusters; that is clusters
of words that are consistent across languages.
This is achieved by means of a probabilistic
model over large amounts of monolingual data
in two languages, coupled with parallel data
through which cross-lingual word-cluster con-
straints are enforced. We show that by augment-
ing the delexicalized direct transfer system of
McDonald et al. (2011) with cross-lingual clus-
ter features, we are able to reduce its error by
up to 13% relative. Further, we show that by ap-
plying the same method to direct-transfer NER,
we achieve a relative error reduction of 26%.

By incorporating cross-lingual cluster features in a
linguistic transfer system, we are for the first time
combining SSL and cross-lingual transfer.

2 Monolingual Word Cluster Features

Word cluster features have been shown to be use-
ful in various tasks in natural language processing,
including syntactic dependency parsing (Koo et al.,
2008; Haffari et al., 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2011),
syntactic chunking (Turian et al., 2010), and NER
(Freitag, 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Turian et al., 2010;
Faruqui and Padó, 2010). Intuitively, the reason for
the effectiveness of cluster features lie in their abil-
ity to aggregate local distributional information from
large unlabeled corpora, which aid in conquering data
sparsity in supervised training regimes as well as in
mitigating cross-domain generalization issues.

In line with much previous work on word clusters
for tasks such as dependency parsing and NER, for
which local syntactic and semantic constraints are
of importance, we induce word clusters by means of
a probabilistic class-based language model (Brown
et al., 1992; Clark, 2003). However, rather than the
more commonly used model of Brown et al. (1992),
we use the predictive class bigram model introduced
by Uszkoreit and Brants (2008). The two models
are very similar, but whereas the former takes class-
to-class transitions into account, the latter directly
models word-to-class transitions. By ignoring class-
to-class transitions, an approximate maximum likeli-
hood clustering can be found efficiently with the dis-
tributed exchange algorithm (Uszkoreit and Brants,
2008). This is a useful property, as we later develop
an algorithm for inducing cross-lingual word clusters
that calls this monolingual algorithm as a subroutine.

More formally, let C : V 7→ 1, . . . ,K be a (hard)
clustering function that maps each word type from the
vocabulary, V , to one ofK cluster identities. With the
model of Uszkoreit and Brants (2008), the likelihood
of a sequence of word tokens, w = 〈wi〉mi=1, with
wi ∈ V ∪ {S}, where S is a designated start-of-
segment symbol, factors as

L(w; C) =
m∏

i=1

p(wi|C(wi))p(C(wi)|wi−1) . (1)

Compare this to the model of Brown et al. (1992):

L′(w; C) =
m∏

i=1

p(wi|C(wi))p(C(wi)|C(wi−1)) .

While the use of class-to-class transitions can lead
to more compact models, which is often useful for
conquering data sparsity, when clustering large data
sets we can get reliable statistics directly on the word-
to-class transitions (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008).

In addition to the clustering model that we make
use of in this study, a number of additional word
clustering and embedding variants have been pro-
posed. For example, Turian et al. (2010) assessed
the effectiveness of the word embedding techniques
of Collobert and Weston (2008) and Mnih and Hin-
ton (2007) along with the word clustering technique
of Brown et al. (1992) for syntactic chunking and
NER. Recently, Dhillon et al. (2011) proposed a word

embedding method based on canonical correlation
analysis that provides state-of-the art results for word-
based SSL for English NER. As an alternative to clus-
tering words, Lin and Wu (2009) proposed a phrase
clustering approach that obtained the state-of-the-art
result for English NER.

3 Monolingual Cluster Experiments

Before moving on to the multilingual setting, we
conduct a set of monolingual experiments where we
evaluate the use of the monolingual word clusters
just described as features for dependency parsing and
NER. In the parsing experiments, we study the fol-
lowing thirteen languages:1 Danish (DA), German
(DE), Greek (EL), English (EN), Spanish (ES), French
(FR), Italian (IT), Korean (KO), Dutch (NL), Portugese
(PT), Russian (RU), Swedish (SV) and Chinese (ZH)
– representing the Chinese, Germanic, Hellenic, Ro-
mance, Slavic, Altaic and Korean genera. In the NER
experiments, we study three Germanic languages:
German (DE), English (EN) and Dutch (NL); and one
Romance language: Spanish (ES).

Details of the labeled and unlabeled data sets used
are given in Appendix A. For all experiments we
fixed the number of clusters to 256 as this performed
well on held-out data. Furthermore, we only clus-
tered the 1 million most frequent word types in each
language for both efficiency and sparsity reasons. For

languages in which our unlabeled data did not have
at least 1 million types, we considered all types.

3.1 Cluster Augmented Feature Models
All of the parsing experiments reported in this study
are based on the transition-based dependency parsing
paradigm (Nivre, 2008). For all languages and set-
tings, we use an arc-eager decoding strategy, with a
beam of eight hypotheses, and perform ten epochs of
the averaged structured perceptron algorithm (Zhang
and Clark, 2008). We extend the state-of-the-art fea-
ture model recently introduced by Zhang and Nivre
(2011) by adding an additional word cluster based
feature template for each word based template. Ad-
ditionally, we add templates where one or more part-
of-speech feature is replaced with the corresponding
cluster feature. The resulting set of additional fea-
ture templates are shown in Table 1. The expanded
feature model includes all of the feature templates de-
fined by Zhang and Nivre (2011), which we also use
as the baseline model, whereas Table 1 only shows
our new templates due to space limitations.

For all NER experiments, we use a sequential first-
order conditional random field (CRF) with a unit
variance Normal prior, trained with L-BFGS until
�-convergence (� = 0.0001, typically obtained after
less than 400 iterations). The feature model used
for the NER tagger is shown in Table 2. These are
similar to the features used by Turian et al. (2010),
with the main difference that we do not use any long
range features and that we add templates that conjoin
adjacent clusters and adjacent tags as well as tem-
plates that conjoin label transitions with tags, clusters
and capitalization features.

3.2 Results

The results of the parsing experiments, measured
with labeled accuracy score (LAS) on all sentence
lengths, excluding punctuation, are shown in Table 3.
The baselines are all comparable to the state-of-the-
art. On average, the addition of word cluster features
yields a 6% relative reduction in error and upwards
of 15% (for RU). All languages improve except FR,
which sees neither an increase nor a decrease in LAS.
We observe an average absolute increase in LAS
of approximately 1%, which is inline with previous
observations (Koo et al., 2008). It is perhaps not
surprising that RU sees a large gain as it is a highly
inflected language, making observations of lexical
features far more sparse. Some languages, e.g., FR,
NL, and ZH see much smaller gains. One likely cul-
prit is a divergence between the tokenization schemes
used in the treebank and in our unlabeled data, which
for Indo-European languages is closely related to the
Penn Treebank tokenization. For example, the NL
treebank contains many multi-word tokens that are
typically broken apart by our automatic tokenizer.

The NER results, in terms of F1 measure, are listed
in Table 4. Introducing word cluster features for
NER reduces relative errors on the test set by 21%
(39% on the development set) on average. Broken
down per language, reductions on the test set vary
from substantial for NL (30%) and EN (26%), down
to more modest for DE (17%) and ES (12%). The
addition of cluster features most markedly improve

recognition of the PER category, with an average error
reduction on the test set of 44%, while the reductions
for ORG (19%), LOC (17%) and MISC (10%) are more
modest, but still significant. Although our results
are below the best reported results for EN and DE
(Lin and Wu, 2009; Faruqui and Padó, 2010), the
relative improvements of adding word clusters are
inline with previous results on NER for EN (Miller
et al., 2004; Turian et al., 2010), who report error
reductions of approximately 25% from adding word
cluster features. Slightly higher reductions where
achieved for DE by Faruqui and Padó (2010), who
report a reduction of 22%. Note that we did not tune
hyper-parameters of the supervised learning methods
and of the clustering method, such as the number
of clusters (Turian et al., 2010; Faruqui and Padó,
2010), and that we did not apply any heuristic for data
cleaning such as that used by Turian et al. (2010).

4 Cross-lingual Word Cluster Features

All results of the previous section rely on the avail-
ability of large quantities of language specific anno-
tations for each task. Cross-lingual transfer methods
and unsupervised methods have recently been shown
to hold promise as a way to at least partially sidestep
the demand for labeled data. Unsupervised methods
attempt to infer linguistic structure without using any
annotated data (Klein and Manning, 2004) or possi-
bly by using a set of linguistically motivated rules
(Naseem et al., 2010) or a linguistically informed
model structure (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).
The aim of transfer methods is instead to use knowl-
edge induced from labeled resources in one or more
source languages to construct systems for target lan-
guages in which no or few such resources are avail-
able (Hwa et al., 2005). Currently, the performance
of even the most simple direct transfer systems far
exceeds that of unsupervised systems (Cohen et al.,
2011; McDonald et al., 2011; Søgaard, 2011).

4.1 Direct Transfer of Discriminative Models

Our starting point is the delexicalized direct transfer
method proposed by McDonald et al. (2011) based on
work by Zeman and Resnik (2008). This method was
shown to outperform a number of state-of-the-art un-
supervised and transfer-based baselines. The method
is simple; for a given training set, the learner ignores
all lexical identities and only observes features over
other characteristics, e.g., part-of-speech tags, ortho-
graphic features, direction of syntactic attachment,
etc. The learner builds a model from an annotated
source language data set, after which the model is
used to directly make target language predictions.

There are three basic assumptions that drive this ap-
proach. First, that high-level tasks, such as syntactic
parsing, can be learned reliably using coarse-grained
statistics, such as part-of-speech tags, in place of
fine-grained statistics such as lexical word identities.
Second, that the parameters of features over coarse-
grained statistics are in some sense language inde-

pendent, e.g., a feature that indicates that adjectives
modify their closest noun is useful in all languages.
Third, that these coarse-grained statistics are robustly
available across languages. The approach proposed
by McDonald et al. (2011) relies on these three as-
sumptions. Specifically, by replacing fine-grained
language specific part-of-speech tags with universal
part-of-speech tags, generated with the method de-
scribed by Das and Petrov (2011), a universal parser
is achieved that can be applied to any language for
which universal part-of-speech tags are available.

Below, we extend this approach to universal pars-
ing by adding cross-lingual word cluster features. A
cross-lingual word clustering is a clustering of words
in two languages, in which the clusters correspond to
some meaningful cross-lingual property. For exam-
ple, prepositions from both languages should be in
the same cluster, proper names from both languages
in another cluster and so on. By adding features de-
fined over these clusters, we can, to some degree,

481



re-lexicalize the delexicalized models, while main-
taining the “universality” of the features. This ap-
proach is outlined in Figure 1. Assuming that we
have an algorithm for generating cross-lingual word
clusters (see Section 4.2), we can augment the delex-
icalized parsing algorithm to use these word cluster
features at training and testing time.

In order to further motivate the proposed approach,
consider the accuracy of the supervised English
parser. A parser with lexical, part-of-speech and
cluster features achieves 90.7% LAS (see Table 3). If
we remove all lexical and cluster features, the same
parser achieves 83.1%. However, if we add back just
the cluster features, the accuracy jumps back up to
89.5%, which is only 1.2% below the full system.
Thus, if we can accurately learn cross-lingual clus-
ters, there is hope of regaining some of the accuracy
lost due to the delexicalization process.

4.2 Inducing Cross-lingual Word Clusters
Our first method for inducing cross-lingual clusters
has two stages. First, it clusters a source language
(S) as in the monolingual case, and then projects
these clusters to a target language (T), using word
alignments. Given two aligned word sequences
wS =

〈
wSi
〉mS
i=1

and wT =
〈
wTi
〉mT
j=1

, let AT |S be a
set of scored alignments from the source language to
the target language, where (wTj , w

S
aj , sj,aj ) ∈ A

T |S

is an alignment from the aj th source word to the jth
target word, with score sj,aj ≥ δ.2 We use the short-
hand j ∈ AT |S to denote those target words wTj that
are aligned to some source word wSaj . Provided a
clustering CS , we assign the target word t ∈ VT to
the cluster with which it is most often aligned:

CT (t) = argmax
k

∑
j∈AT |S

s.t. wT
j

=t

sj,aj

[
CS(wSaj ) = k

]
, (2)

where [·] is the indicator function. We refer to the
cross-lingual clusters induced in this way as PRO-
JECTED CLUSTERS.

This simple projection approach has two potential
drawbacks. First, it only provides a clustering of
those target language words that occur in the word

2In our case, the alignment score corresponds to the condi-
tional alignment probability p(wTj |wSaj ). All �-alignments are
ignored and we use δ = 0.95 throughout.

aligned data, which is typically smaller than our
monolingual data sets. Second, the mapped cluster-
ing may not necessarily correspond to an acceptable
target language clustering in terms of monolingual
likelihood. In order to tackle these issues, we pro-
pose the following more complex model. First, to
find clusterings that are good according to both the
source and target language, and to make use of more
unlabeled data, we model word sequences in each lan-
guage by the monolingual language model with like-
lihood function defined by equation (1). Denote these
likelihood functions respectively by LS(wS ; CS) and
LT (wT ; CT ), where we have overloaded notation so
that the word sequences denoted by wS and wT in-
clude much more plentiful non-aligned data when
taken as an argument of the monolingual likelihood
functions. Second, we couple the clusterings defined
by these individual models, by introducing additional
factors based on word alignments, as proposed by
Och (1999):

LT |S(wT ;AT |S , CT , CS) =∏
j∈AT |S

p(wTj |CT (wTj ))p(CT (wTj )|CS(wSaj )) .

and the symmetric LS|T (wS ;AS|T , CS , CT ). Note
that the simple projection defined by equation (2)
correspond to a hard assignment variant of this prob-
abilistic formulation when the source clustering is
fixed. Combining all four factors results in the joint
monolingual and cross-lingual objective function

LS,T (wS ,wT ;AT |S ,AS|T , CS , CT ) =

LS(. . .) · LT (. . .) · LT |S(. . .) · LS|T (. . .) . (3)

The intuition of this approach is that the clusterings
CS and CT are forced to jointly explain the source
and target data, treating the word alignments as a
form of soft constraints. We approximately optimize
(3) with the alternating procedure in Algorithm 1, in
which we iteratively maximize LS and LT , keeping
the other factors fixed. In this way we can generate
cross-lingual clusterings using all the monolingual
data while forcing the clusterings to obey the word
alignment constraints. We refer to the clusters in-
duced with this method as X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS.

In practice we found that each unconstrained
monolingual run of the exchange algorithm (lines

1 and 3) moves the clustering too far from those that
obey the word alignment constraints, which causes
the procedure to fail to converge. However, we found
that fixing the clustering of the words that are as-
signed clusters in the projection stages (lines 2 and
4) and only clustering the remaining words works
well in practice. Furthermore, we found that iterating
the procedure has little effect on performance and set
N = 1 for all subsequent experiments.

5 Cross-lingual Experiments

In our first set of experiments on using cross-lingual
cluster features, we evaluate direct transfer of our
EN parser, trained on Stanford style dependencies
(De Marneffe et al., 2006), to the the ten non-EN
Indo-European languages listed in Section 3. We ex-
clude KO and ZH as initial experiments proved direct
transfer a poor technique when transferring parsers
between such diverse languages. We study the impact
of using cross-lingual cluster features by comparing
the strong delexicalized baseline model of McDon-
ald et al. (2011), which only has features derived
from universal part-of-speech tags, projected from
English with the method of Das and Petrov (2011), to
the same model when adding features derived from
cross-lingual clusters. In both cases the feature mod-
els are the same as those used in Section 3.1, except
that they are delexicalized by removing all lexical
word-identity features. We evaluate both the PRO-
JECTED CLUSTERS and the X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS.

For these experiments we train the perceptron
for only five epochs in order to prevent over-fitting,
which is an acute problem due to the divergence be-
tween the training and testing data sets in this setting.
Furthermore, in accordance to standard practices we

only evaluate unlabeled attachment score (UAS) due
to the fact that each treebank uses a different – possi-
bly non-overlapping – label set.

In our second set of experiments, we evaluate di-
rect transfer of a NER system trained on EN to DE,
ES and NL. We use the same feature models as in
the monolingual case, with the exception that we use
universal part-of-speech tags for all languages and
we remove the capitalization feature when transfer-
ring from EN to DE. Capitalization is both a prevalent
and highly predictive feature of named-entities in EN,
while in DE, capitalization is even more prevalent, but
has very low predictive power. Interestingly, while
delexicalization has shown to be important for di-
rect transfer of dependency-parsers (McDonald et al.,
2011), we noticed in preliminary experiments that
it substantially degrades performance for NER. We
hypothesize that this is because word features are pre-
dictive of common proper names and that these are
often translated directly across languages, at least in
the case of newswire text. As for the transfer parser,
when training the source NER model, we regularize
the model more heavily by setting σ = 0.1.

Appendix A contains the details of the training,
testing, unlabeled and parallel/aligned data sets.

5.1 Results
Table 5 lists the results of the transfer experiments
for dependency parsing. The baseline results are
comparable to those in McDonald et al. (2011) and
thus also significantly outperform the results of re-
cent unsupervised approaches (Berg-Kirkpatrick and
Klein, 2010; Naseem et al., 2010). Importantly, cross-
lingual cluster features are helpful across the board
and give a relative error reduction ranging from 3%
for DA to 13% for PT, with an average reduction of
6%, in terms of unlabeled attachment score (UAS).
This shows the utility of cross-lingual cluster fea-
tures for syntactic transfer. However, X-LINGUAL
CLUSTERS provides roughly the same performance
as PROJECTED CLUSTERS suggesting that even sim-
ple methods of cross-lingual clustering are sufficient
for direct transfer dependency parsing.

We would like to stress that these results are likely
to be under-estimating the parsers’ actual ability to
predict Stanford-style dependencies in the target lan-
guages. This is because the target language anno-
tations that we use for evaluation differ from the

Stanford dependency annotation. Some of these dif-
ferences are warranted in that certain target language
phenomena are better captured by the native annota-
tion. However, differences such as choice of lexical
versus functional head are more arbitrary.

To highlight this point we run two additional ex-
periments. First, we had linguists, who were also
fluent speakers of German, re-annotate the DE test set
so that unlabeled arcs are consistent with Stanford-
style dependencies. Using this data, NO CLUSTERS
obtains 60.0% UAS, PROJECTED CLUSTERS 63.6%
and X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS 64.4%. When compared
to the scores on the original data set (48.9%, 50.3%
and 50.7%, respectively) we can see that not only is
the baseline system doing much better, but that the
improvements from cross-lingual clustering are much
more pronounced. Next, we investigated the accuracy
of subject and object dependencies, as these are often
annotated in similar ways across treebanks, typically
modifying the main verb of the sentence. The bottom
half of Table 5 gives the scores when restricted to
such dependencies in the gold data. We measure the
percentage of modifiers in subject and object depen-
dencies that modify the correct word. Indeed, here
we see the difference in performance become clearer,
with the cross-lingual cluster model reducing errors
by 14% relative to the non-cross-lingual model and
upwards of 22% relative for IT.

We now turn to the results of the transfer experi-
ments for NER, listed in Table 6. While the perfor-
mance of the transfer systems is very poor when no
word clusters are used, adding cross-lingual word
clusters give substantial improvements across all lan-
guages. The simple PROJECTED CLUSTERS work
well, but the X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS provide even
larger improvements. On average the latter reduce

errors on the test set by 22% in terms of F1 and up
to 26% for ES. We also measure how well the di-
rect transfer NER systems are able to detect entity
boundaries (ignoring the entity categories). Here, on
average, the best clusters provide a 24% relative error
reduction on the test set (75.8 vs. 68.1 F1).

To our knowledge there are no comparable results
on transfer learning of NER systems. Based on the
results of this first attempt at this scenario, we believe
that transfer learning by multilingual word clusters
could be developed into a practical way to construct
NER systems for resource poor languages.

6 Conclusion

In the first part of this study, we showed that word
clusters induced from a simple class-based language
model can be used to significantly improve on state-
of-the-art supervised dependency parsing and NER
for a wide range of languages and even across lan-
guage families. Although the improvements vary
between languages, the addition of word cluster fea-
tures never has a negative impact on performance.

This result has important practical consequences as
it allows practitioners to simply plug in word clus-
ter features into their current feature models. Given
previous work on word clusters for various linguistic
structure prediction tasks, these results are not too
surprising. However, to our knowledge this is the first
study to apply the same type of word cluster features
across languages and tasks.

In the second part, we provided two simple meth-
ods for inducing cross-lingual word clusters. The first
method works by projecting word clusters, induced
from monolingual data, from a source language to
a target language directly via word alignments. The
second method, on the other hand, makes use of
monolingual data in both the source and the target
language, together with word alignments that act as
constraints on the joint clustering. We then showed
that by using these cross-lingual word clusters, we
can significantly improve on direct transfer of dis-
criminative models for both parsing and NER. As
in the monolingual case, both types of cross-lingual
word cluster features yield improvements across the
board, with the more complex method providing a
significantly larger improvement for NER. Although
the performance of transfer systems is still substan-
tially below that of supervised systems, this research
provides one step towards bridging this gap. Further,
we believe that it opens up an avenue for future work
on multilingual clustering methods, cross-lingual fea-
ture projection and domain adaptation for direct trans-
fer of linguistic structure.

A Data Sets

In the parsing experiments, we use the following data
sets. For DA, DE, EL, ES, IT, NL, PT and SV, we
use the predefined training and evaluation data sets

from the CoNLL 2006/2007 data sets (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007). For EN we use
sections 02-21, 22, and 23 of the Penn WSJ Tree-
bank (Marcus et al., 1993) for training, development
and evaluation. For FR we used the French Treebank
(Abeillé and Barrier, 2004) with splits defined in Can-
dito et al. (2010). For KO we use the Sejong Korean
Treebank (Han et al., 2002) randomly splitting the
data into 80% training, 10% development and 10%
evaluation. For RU we use the SynTagRus Treebank
(Boguslavsky et al., 2000; Apresjan et al., 2006) ran-
domly splitting the data into 80% training, 10% devel-
opment and 10% evaluation. For ZH we use the Penn
Chinese Treebank v6 (Xue et al., 2005) using the
proposed data splits from the documentation. Both
EN and ZH were converted to dependencies using
v1.6.8 of the Stanford Converter (De Marneffe et al.,
2006). FR was converted using the procedure defined
in Candito et al. (2010). RU and KO are native depen-
dency treebanks. For the CoNLL data sets we use
the part-of-speech tags provided with the data. For
all other data sets, we train a part-of-speech tagger
on the training data in order to tag the development
and evaluation data.

For the NER experiments we use the training, de-
velopment and evaluation data sets from the CoNLL
2002/2003 shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002;
Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) for all
four languages (DE, EN, ES and NL). The data set
for each language consists of newswire text anno-
tated with four entity categories: Location (LOC),
Miscellaneous (MISC), Organization (ORG) and Per-
son (PER). We use the part-of-speech tags supplied
with the data, except for ES where we instead use
universal part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2011).

Unlabeled data for training the monolingual cluster
models was extracted from one year of newswire ar-
ticles from multiple sources from a news aggregation
website. This consists of 0.8 billion (DA) to 121.6 bil-
lion (EN) tokens per language. All word alignments
for the cross-lingual clusterings were produced with
the dual decomposition aligner described by DeNero
and Macherey (2011) using 10.5 million (DA) to 12.1
million (FR) sentences of aligned web data.
