Abstract

We describe a new shared task on syntac-
tic paraphrase ranking that is intended to run
in conjunction with the main surface real-
ization shared task. Taking advantage of
the human judgments collected to evaluate
the surface realizations produced by com-
peting systems, the task is to automatically
rank these realizations—viewed as syntactic
paraphrases—in a way that agrees with the hu-
man judgments as often as possible. The task
is designed to appeal to developers of surface
realization systems as well as machine transla-
tion evaluation metrics: for surface realization
systems, the task sidesteps the thorny issue of
converting inputs to a common representation;
for MT evaluation metrics, the task provides
a challenging framework for advancing auto-
matic evaluation, as many of the paraphrases
are expected to be of high quality, differing
only in subtle syntactic choices.

1 Introduction

For the first surface realization shared task, the orga-
nizers considered running a follow-on task for evalu-
ating automatic evaluation metrics—along the lines
of similar meta-evaluations carried out for machine
translation in recent years—though it was deferred
for lack of time. For the second surface realiza-
tion shared task, we propose to generalize this met-
rics meta-evaluation task to also usefully encom-
pass realization ranking, where the various realiza-
tions generated for a given input in the main task
are viewed as syntactic paraphrases of the original
corpus sentence. The syntactic paraphrasing shared

task comprises three tracks, described in the next
section; in each case, the task is to automatically re-
produce the relative preference judgments gathered
during the human evaluation of the surface realiza-
tion main task. As explained further below, develop-
ers of realization systems that can generate and op-
tionally rank multiple outputs for a given input will
be encouraged to participate in the task, which will
test the system’s ability to produce acceptable para-
phrases and/or to rank competing realizations.

The objectives of the shared task are as follows:

broaden participation We expect developers of
automatic quality metrics in the MT commu-
nity to be interested in the proposed task, which
is anticipated to be both more focused (with
lexical choice largely excluded) and more chal-
lenging than in the MT case, given the gener-
ally high level of quality in realization results:
as realization quality increases, the metrics’
task becomes more difficult, since the para-
phrases of a given sentence often involve sub-
tle differences between acceptable and unac-
ceptable variation. In an earlier study of the
utility of automatic metrics with Penn Tree-
bank (PTB) surface realization data (Espinosa
et al., 2010), we observed moderate correla-
tions between the most popular metrics and hu-
man judgments, though lower than the levels
seen with MT data.

promote reuse of human judgments The task is
intended to test the effectiveness of realization
ranking models in a way that reuses human
judgments, making it possible to carry out re-

mitigate input conversion issues Realizer evalua-
tions have typically focused on single-best out-
puts, where the depth and specificity of sys-
tem inputs has a large impact on quality, mak-
ing comparative evaluation difficult. While the
surface realization shared task seeks to address
this issue by developing common ground input
representations, to date it has proved to be dif-
ficult to adapt existing systems to work with
these inputs. By focusing on ranking para-
phrases that are distinct from the reference sen-
tence, the proposed task may provide a way to
mitigate these issues, as discussed below.

2 Three Tracks: From Realization
Ranking to Metrics Meta-Evaluation

We propose three tracks for the task, going from
pure realization ranking to metrics meta-evaluation,
with a hybrid case in the middle. For all three tracks,
the input is a set of pairs of syntactic paraphrases
(distinct from the reference sentence), and the output
is the preferred member of each pair, where the goal
is to match the human judgments of relative prefer-
ence. The tracks differ in the additional inputs that
systems may use in determining which member of
each pair is preferred (see Table 1). In the realiza-
tion ranking track, the task is to rank order the para-
phrases for a given sentence, without having access
to the reference sentence, using a realization rank-
ing model. To do so, each system is allowed to use
its own “native” inputs derived from the Penn Tree-
bank and PTB-based resources. To the extent that
a system’s statistical ranking model can be used to
assign a score to any possible realization, the rank-
ing task can be accomplished by simply ranking the
realizations by model score. As such, following this
strategy, the task is one of analysis by synthesis.

For non-statistical realizers, or ones that cannot
assign a score to any possible realization, there is
an alternative strategy available, namely to auto-
matically approximate HTER. Snover et al. (2006)
demonstrate that the human-targeted translation edit
rate (HTER) represents a reliable and easily inter-
pretable method of evaluating MT output. With this
method, a human annotator produces a targeted ref-
erence sentence which is as close as possible to the
MT hypothesis while being fully acceptable; from
the targeted reference, the TER score then repre-
sents a normalized post-edit score, which has been
shown to correlate with human ratings at least as
well as more complex competing metrics. As Mad-
nani (2010) points out, generated paraphrases of
the reference sentence can be used to approximate
HTER scoring, as the closest acceptable paraphrase
of a reference sentence should correspond to the ver-
sion of the MT hypothesis with minimal changes to
make it acceptable. Indeed, in the limit, it should
be possible to use a system that can enumerate all
and only the acceptable paraphrases of a reference
sentence to fully implement HTER scoring.

Naturally, it is possible to combine the analysis-
by-synthesis and approximating HTER strategies.
One particularly simple way to do so is to (1) use
an n-best list of realizations with normalized scores,
(2) find the realization with the minimum TER score
for each paraphrase to rank, then (3) combine the re-
alizer’s model score with the TER score, e.g. just by
subtraction (weights for the combination could also
be optimized using machine learning).

Regarding the issue of whether fair comparisons
can be made when each system is allowed to use its
own PTB-derived “native” input, note that it is un-
clear whether using shallow, specific inputs is neces-
sarily advantageous for ranking a range of possible
realizations, all distinct from the reference sentence:
in the limit, a realizer input that completely speci-
fies the reference sentence (and no other variants) is
of no help at all, as in this case the approximating
HTER strategy reduces to just doing TER scoring
against the reference sentence.

Turning now to the metrics meta-evaluation track,
here the the task is to rank order a set of realizations
for a given sentence, starting with the reference sen-
tence and nothing else. In principle, it should be
possible to use any MT metric for this task off-the-

151



shelf. It should also be possible for realization sys-
tems to participate in this track, if they can be paired
with a parser that produces inputs for the realizer, or
a parser whose outputs can be converted to realizer
inputs. To do so, strategies employed in the realiza-
tion ranking track can be combined with ones that
make use of the reference sentence.

Finally, between these two tracks is a hybrid track,
where one is allowed to substitute automatic parses
with gold parses. This track can be viewed as pro-
viding a way to estimate an upper bound on ap-
proaches that pay attention to how well a sentence
expresses an intended meaning, while also arguably
representing the most sensible way to automatically
evaluate outputs in a data-to-text setting, where in-
tended meanings can be reliably represented.

3 Pilot Experiments

In this section, we present two pilot experiments in-
tended to demonstrate the feasibility of the task. The
experiments use the human judgments collected in
Espinosa et al.’s (2010) study, which consist of ade-
quacy and fluency ratings from two judges for a va-
riety of realizations for PTB Section 00. The real-
izations in the corpus were generated using several
OpenCCG realization ranking models (White and
Rajkumar, 2009) and using the XLE symbolic re-
alizer with subsequent n-gram ranking (paraphrases
involving WordNet substitutions were excluded).
For comparison purposes, three well-known met-
rics (BLEU, METEOR and TER) were tested, along
with three OpenCCG ranking models: (I) a gen-
erative baseline model, incorporating three n-gram
models as well as Hockenmaier’s (2003) genera-
tive model; (II) a model additionally incorporating
a slew of discriminative features, extending White
& Rajkumar’s model with dependency ordering fea-
tures; and (III) a model adding one additional fea-
ture for minimizing dependency length. Note that
Models II and III are very similar, usually yielding
the same single-best output, though occasionally dif-
fering in important ways; by contrast, both models
represent a substantial refinement of Model I.

The two experiments investigate different strate-
gies for approaching the hybrid task. The first exper-
iment investigates the approximating-HTER strat-
egy (with an analysis-by-synthesis component) us-

ing a 20-best list. For simplicity, edit rate (edit dis-
tance normalized by the number of words in the ref-
erence sentence) was used to find the realization in
the 20-best list that was closest to the paraphrase to
be ranked. The score for the paraphrase was then
calculated by normalizing the realizer model score
for the closest realization (linearly interpolating us-
ing the min and max scores across all 20-best lists),
subtracting the edit rate, and adding in the met-
ric score, for each of BLEU, METEOR and TER.1

Since edit rate is less reliable than TER, as it overly
penalizes phrasal shifts, the metric score was used
alone in cases where the edit rate exceeded 0.5.

The results of the first experiment appear in Ta-
ble 2. Human judgments were combined by av-
eraging the summed adequacy and fluency ratings
from each judge. Excluding exact match realiza-
tions, 2838 pairs of realizations with distinct com-
bined scores (from approximately 250 sentences)
were used to judge ranking accuracy. Here, BLEU
substantially outperforms METEOR and TER, and
combining Models I-III with BLEU does not yield
significant differences in ranking accuracy. Note,
however, that using TER scores rather than edit rate,
and optimizing the way the model scores are com-
bined with the TER score and BLEU score, could
perhaps yield significant improvements. With ME-
TEOR and TER, combining the model score, edit
rate and metric score in the simplest way does yield
highly significant improvements. With the ME-
TEOR combination, Model II achieves a highly sig-
nificant improvement over Model I, though in other
cases, only trends are observed across models.

The second experiment investigates the analysis-
by-synthesis strategy more directly. Here, the re-
alizer’s search was guided to reproduce each para-
phrase where possible, with model scores then cal-
culated where an exact match could be achieved.
The results appear in Table 3 for 474 pairs with dif-
fering combined human judgments. The first col-
umn shows the ranking accuracy using the model
scores by themselves; the subsequent columns com-
pare the accuracy using BLEU, METEOR and TER
against using the model score added to the metric
score. Here we see from the first column that Model
II substantially outperforms Model I, showing the

1TER scores were inverted for consistency.

ability of the ranking task to discriminate among
models of varying sophistication, though the model
differences are largely washed out when the model
scores are combined with metric scores. In the sub-
sequent columns, we see that METEOR and TER
are only performing at chance (50%) on these par-
ticular ranking cases, while adding the model scores
and metric scores does much better, with Model III
plus TER performing the best overall, as might have
been expected. Even with BLEU, which performs
decently on its own, adding in the model scores
achieves substantial (and highly significant) gains.

4 Task Organization

The proposed syntactic paraphrase ranking task is
intended to be run as a straightforward extension of
the main surface realization shared task. For devel-
opment and training purposes, the human judgments
collected for the first surface realization shared task
will be made available; the data from Espinosa et
al.’s study is already publicly available as well. For
test data, the human judgments collected for eval-
uation during the second surface realization shared
task will be used. Ideally enough systems will enter
the main task to enable many pairwise comparisons
per sentence, and enough judges can be employed
to allow majority preferences to be used as the gold
standard. As baselines for the metrics meta-eval and
hybrid tracks, the BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER

metrics will be run by the organizers. Time permit-
ting, a baseline system that works with n-best real-
ization scores will also be made available, so that
any developer of a realization system that can pro-
duce n-best outputs can easily participate.
