Abstract

Bilingual word embeddings have been widely
used to capture the correspondence of lexi-
cal semantics in different human languages.
However, the cross-lingual correspondence
between sentences and words is less studied,
despite that this correspondence can signifi-
cantly benefit many applications such as cross-
lingual semantic search and textual inference.
To bridge this gap, we propose a neural em-
bedding model that leverages bilingual dictio-
naries1. The proposed model is trained to map
the lexical definitions to the cross-lingual tar-
get words, for which we explore with differ-
ent sentence encoding techniques. To enhance
the learning process on limited resources, our
model adopts several critical learning strate-
gies, including multi-task learning on differ-
ent bridges of languages, and joint learning of
the dictionary model with a bilingual word em-
bedding model. We conduct experiments on
two new tasks. In the cross-lingual reverse
dictionary retrieval task, we demonstrate that
our model is capable of comprehending bilin-
gual concepts based on descriptions, and the
proposed learning strategies are effective. In
the bilingual paraphrase identification task, we
show that our model effectively associates sen-
tences in different languages via a shared em-
bedding space, and outperforms existing ap-
proaches in identifying bilingual paraphrases.

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual semantic representation learning has
attracted significant attention recently. Various ap-
proaches have been proposed to align words of
different languages in a shared embedding space
(Ruder et al., 2017). By offering task-invariant se-

lexical definitions of words. Note that this is different from
some papers on bilingual settings that refer dictionaries to
seed lexicons for one-to-one word mappings.

mantic transfers, these approaches critically sup-
port many cross-lingual NLP tasks including neu-
ral machine translations (NMT) (Devlin et al.,
2014), bilingual document classification (Zhou
et al., 2016), knowledge alignment (Chen et al.,
2018b) and entity linking (Upadhyay et al., 2018).

While many existing approaches have been pro-
posed to associate lexical semantics between lan-
guages (Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015;
Luong et al., 2015a), modeling the correspon-
dence between lexical and sentential semantics
across different languages is still an unresolved
challenge. We argue that learning to represent
such cross-lingual and multi-granular correspon-
dence is well desired and natural for multiple rea-
sons. One reason is that, learning word-to-word
correspondence has a natural limitation, consider-
ing that many words do not have direct transla-
tions in another language. For example, schaden-
freude in German, which means a feeling of joy
that comes from knowing the troubles of other
people, has no proper English counterpart word.
To appropriately learn the representations of such
words in bilingual embeddings, we need to capture
their meanings based on the definitions.

Besides, modeling such correspondence is also
highly beneficial to many application scenarios.
One example is cross-lingual semantic search of
concepts (Hill et al., 2016), where the lexemes
or concepts are retrieved based on sentential de-
scriptions (see Fig. 1). Others include discourse
relation detection in bilingual dialogue utterances
(Jiang et al., 2018), multilingual text summariza-
tion (Nenkova et al., 2012), and educational ap-
plications for foreign language learners. Finally,
it is natural in foreign language learning that a
human learns foreign words by looking up their
meanings in the native language (Hulstijn et al.,
1996). Therefore, learning such correspondence
essentially mimics human learning behaviors.

Cross-lingual Reverse 
Dictionary RetrievalCross-lingual Paraphrases

Figure 1: An example illustrating the two cross-lingual
tasks. The cross-lingual reverse dictionary retrieval finds
cross-lingual target words based on descriptions. In terms
of cross-lingual paraphrases, the French sentence (which
means any male being considered in relation to his father
and mother, or only one of them) describes the same meaning
as the English sentence, but has much more content details.

However, realizing such a representation learn-
ing model is a non-trivial task, inasmuch as it re-
quires a comprehensive learning process to effec-
tively compose the semantics of arbitrary-length
sentences in one language, and associate that with
single words in another language. Consequently,
this objective also demands high-quality cross-
lingual alignment that bridges between single and
sequences of words. Such alignment information
is generally not available in the parallel and seed-
lexicon that are utilized by bilingual word embed-
dings (Ruder et al., 2017).

To incorporate the representations of bilingual
lexical and sentential semantics, we propose an
approach to capture the mapping from the defini-
tions to the corresponding foreign words by lever-
aging bilingual dictionaries The proposed model
BilDRL (Bilingual Dictionary Representation
Learning) first constructs a word embedding
space with pre-trained bilingual word embed-
dings. Based on cross-lingual word definitions,
a sentence encoder is trained to realize the map-
ping from literal descriptions to target words in
the bilingual word embedding space, for which
we investigate with multiple encoding techniques.
To enhance cross-lingual learning on limited re-
sources, BilDRL conducts multi-task learning on
different directions of a language pair. More-
over, BilDRL enforces a joint learning strategy
of bilingual word embeddings and the sentence
encoder, which seeks to gradually adjust the em-
bedding space to better suit the representation of
cross-lingual word definitions.

To show the applicability of BilDRL, we con-
duct experiments on two useful cross-lingual tasks
(see Fig. 1). (i) Cross-lingual reverse dictionary
retrieval seeks to retrieve words or concepts given
descriptions in another language. This task is use-

ful to help users find foreign words based on the
notions or descriptions, and is especially benefi-
cial to users such as translators, foreigner language
learners and technical writers using non-native
languages. We show that BilDRL achieves
promising results on this task, while bilingual
multi-task learning and joint learning dramatically
enhance the performance. (ii) Bilingual para-
phrase identification asks whether two sentences
in different languages essentially express the same
meaning, which is critical to question answering
or dialogue systems that apprehend multilingual
utterances (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).
This task is challenging, as it requires a model to
comprehend cross-lingual paraphrases that are in-
consistent in grammar, content details and word
orders. BilDRL maps sentences to the lexicon
embedding space. This process reduces the prob-
lem to evaluate the similarity of lexicon embed-
dings, which can be easily solved by a simple clas-
sifier. BilDRL performs well with even a small
amount of data, and significantly outperforms pre-
vious approaches.

2 Related Work

We discuss two lines of relevant work.
Bilingual word embeddings. Various approaches
have been proposed for training bilingual word
embeddings. These approaches span in two fami-
lies: off-line mappings and joint training.

The off-line mapping based approach fixes the
structures of pre-trained monolingual embeddings,
and induces bilingual projections based on seed
lexicons (Mikolov et al., 2013a). Some variants
of this approach improve the quality of projec-
tions by adding constraints such as orthogonality
of transforms, normalization and mean centering
of embeddings (Xing et al., 2015; Artetxe et al.,
2016; Vulić et al., 2016). Others adopt canonical
correlation analysis to map separate monolingual
embeddings to a shared embedding space (Faruqui
and Dyer, 2014; Doval et al., 2018).

Unlike off-line mappings, joint training mod-
els simultaneously update word embeddings and
cross-lingual alignment. In doing so, such ap-
proaches generally capture more precise cross-
lingual semantic transfer (Ruder et al., 2017;
Upadhyay et al., 2018). While a few such mod-
els still maintain separated embedding spaces for
each language (Artetxe et al., 2017), more of them
maintain a unified space for both languages. The



154

cross-lingual semantic transfer by these models is
captured from parallel corpora with sentential or
document-level alignment, using techniques such
as bilingual bag-of-words distances (BilBOWA)
(Gouws et al., 2015), Skip-Gram (Coulmance
et al., 2015) and sparse tensor factorization (Vyas
and Carpuat, 2016).
Neural sentence modeling. Neural sentence
models seek to capture phrasal or sentential se-
mantics from word sequences. They often adopt
encoding techniques such as recurrent neural en-
coders (RNN) (Kiros et al., 2015), convolutional
encoders (CNN) (Chen et al., 2018a), and atten-
tive encoders (Rocktäschel et al., 2016) to repre-
sent the composed semantics of a sentence as an
embedding vector. Recent works have focused
on apprehending pairwise correspondence of sen-
tential semantics by adopting multiple neural sen-
tence models in one learning architecture, includ-
ing Siamese models for detecting discourse rela-
tions of sentences (Sha et al., 2016), and sequence-
to-sequence models for tasks like style transfer
(Shen et al., 2017), text summarization (Chopra
et al., 2016) and translation (Wu et al., 2016).

On the other hand, fewer efforts have been put
to characterizing the associations between senten-
tial and lexical semantics. Hill et al. (2016) and
Ji et al. (2017) learn off-line mappings between
monolingual descriptions and lexemes to capture
such associations. Eisner et al. (2016) adopt a sim-
ilar approach to capture emojis based on descrip-
tions. At the best of our knowledge, there has been
no previous approach to learn to discover the cor-
respondence of sentential and lexical semantics in
a multilingual scenario. This is exactly the focus
of our work, in which the proposed strategies of
multi-task learning and joint learning are critical
to the corresponding learning process under lim-
ited resources. Utilizing such correspondence, our
approach also sheds light on addressing discourse
relation detection in a multilingual scenario.

3 Modeling Bilingual Dictionaries

We hereby begin our modeling with the formaliza-
tion of bilingual dictionaries. We use L to denote
the set of languages. For a language l ∈ L, Vl de-
notes its vocabulary, where for each word w ∈ Vl,
bold-faced w ∈ Rk denotes its embedding vec-
tor. A li-lj bilingual dictionaryD(li, lj) (or simply
Dij) contains dictionary entries (wi, S

j
w) ∈ Dij ,

in which wi ∈ Vli , and S
j
w = w

j
1 . . . w

j
n (w

j
· ∈

Vlj ) is a cross-lingual definition that describes the
word wi with a sequence of words in language
lj . For example, a French-English dictionary
D(Fr,En) could include a French word appétite
accompanied by its English definition desire for,
or relish of food or drink. Note that, for a word
wi, multiple definitions in lj may coexist.
BilDRL is constructed and improved through

three stages, as depicted in Fig. 2. A sentence en-
coder is first used to learn from a bilingual dic-
tionary the association between words and defini-
tions. Then in a pre-trained bilingual word em-
bedding space, multi-task learning is conducted on
both directions of a language pair. Lastly, joint
learning with word embeddings is enforced to si-
multaneously adjust the embedding space during
the training of the dictionary model, which further
enhances the cross-lingual learning process.

It is noteworthy that, NMT (Wu et al., 2016)
is considered as an ostensibly relevant method to
ours. NMT does not apply to our problem setting
bacause it has major differences from our work in
those perspectives: (i) In terms of data modali-
ties, NMT has to bridge between corpora of the
same granularity, i.e. either between sentences
or between lexicons. This is unlike BilDRL that
captures multi-granular correspondence of seman-
tics across different modalities, i.e. sentences and
words; (ii) As for learning strategies, NMT relies
on an encoder-decoder architecture using end-to-
end training (Luong et al., 2015b), while BilDRL
employs joint learning of a dictionary-based sen-
tence encoder and a bilingual embedding space.

3.1 Encoders for Lexical Definitions

BilDRL models a dictionary using a neural sen-
tence encoder E(S), which composes the mean-
ing of the sentence into a latent vector representa-
tion. We hereby introduce this model component,
which is designed to be a GRU encoder with self-
attention. Besides that, we also investigate other
widely-used neural sequence encoders.

3.1.1 Attentive GRU Encoder

The GRU encoder is a computationally efficient
alternative of the LSTM (Cho et al., 2014). Each
unit consists of a reset gate rt and an update gate zt
to track the state of the sequence. Given the vector
representation wt of an incoming item wt, GRU
updates the hidden state h(1)t as a linear combina-
tion of the previous state h(1)t−1 and the candidate

t−1.

The update gate zt balances between the infor-
mation of the previous sequence and the new item,
where Mz and Nz are two weight matrices, bz is
a bias vector, and σ is the sigmoid function.

zt = σ
(
Mzxt + Nzh

.

The candidate state h̃(1)t is calculated similarly
to those in a traditional recurrent unit as below.
The reset gate rt thereof controls how much infor-
mation of the past sequence should contribute to
the candidate state.

.

While a GRU encoder can stack multiple of the
above GRU layers, without an attention mecha-
nism, the last state h(1)S of the last layer represents
the overall meaning of the encoded sentence S.
The self-attention mechanism (Conneau et al.,
2017) seeks to highlight the important units in an
input sentence when capturing its overall meaning,
which is calculated as below:

ut = tanh
(

t + ba

)
at =

(

wm∈S exp (u

t = |S|atut.

ut is the intermediary representation of GRU out-
put h(1)t , and uS = tanh(Mah

(1)
S + ba) is that

of the last GRU output h(1)S . uS can be seen as
a high-level representation of the input sequence.

By measuring the similarity of each ut with uS ,
the normalized attention weight at, which high-
lights an input that contributes significantly to the
overall meaning, is produced through a softmax.
Note that a scalar |S| is multiplied along with at
to ut, so as to keep the weighted representation

3.1.2 Other Encoders
We also experiment with other widely used neural
sentence modeling techniques2, which are how-
ever outperformed by the attentive GRU in our
tasks. These techniques include the vanilla GRU,
CNN (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and linear bag-
of-words (BOW) (Hill et al., 2016). We briefly in-
troduce the later two techniques in the following.
A convolutional encoder applies a kernel Mc ∈
Rh×k to produce the latent representation h(3)t =
tanh(Mcwt:t+h−1 +bc) from each h-gram of the
input vector sequence wt:t+h−1, for which h is the
kernel size and bc is a bias vector. A sequence of
latent vectors H(3) = [h(3)1 ,h

(3)
2 , ...,h

(3)
|S|−h+1] is

produced from the input, where each latent vector
leverages the significant local semantic features
from each h-gram. Following convention (Liu
et al., 2017), we apply dynamic max-pooling to
extract robust features from the convolution out-
puts, and use the mean-pooling results of the last
layer to represent the sentential semantics.
The Linear bag-of-words (BOW) encoder (Ji
et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2016) is realized by the

embeddings like multilingual ELMo (Peters et al., 2018; Che
et al., 2018) and M-BERT (Pires et al., 2019; Devlin et al.,
2018) can also be supported to represent sentences for our
setting. We leave them as future work, as they require non-
trivial adaption to both multilingual settings and joint train-
ing, and extensive pre-training on external corpora.

3.2 Basic Learning Objective

The objective of learning the dictionary model is
to map the encodings of cross-lingual word defini-
tions to the target word embeddings. This is real-
ized by minimizing the following L2 loss,

LSTij =
1

|Dij |
∑

(wi,Sjw)∈Dij

∥∥Eij(Sjw)−wi∥∥22
in which Eij is the dictionary model that maps
from descriptions in lj to words in li.

The above defines the basic model variants
of BilDRL that learns on a single dictionary.
For word representations in the learning process,
BilDRL initializes the embedding space using
pre-trained word embeddings. Note that, without
adopting the joint learning strategy in Section 3.4,
the learning process does not update word embed-
dings that are used to represent the definitions and
target words. While other forms of loss such as
cosine proximity (Hill et al., 2016) and hinge loss
(Ji et al., 2017) may also be used in the learning
process, we find that L2 loss consistently leads to
better performance in our experiments.

3.3 Bilingual Multi-task Learning

In cases where entries in a bilingual dictionary
are not amply provided, learning the above bilin-
gual dictionary on one ordered language pair may
fall short in insufficiency of alignment informa-
tion. One practical solution is to conduct a bilin-
gual multi-task learning process. In detail, given
a language pair (li, lj), we learn the dictionary
model Eij on both dictionaries Dij and Dji with
shared parameters. Correspondingly, we rewrite
the previous learning objective function as below,
in which D = Dij ∪Dji.

LMTij =
1

|D|
∑

(w,Sw)∈D

‖Eij(Sw)−w‖22 .

This strategy non-trivially requests the same
dictionary model to represent semantic transfer in
two directions of the language pair. To fulfill such
a request, we initialize the embedding space using
the BilBOWA embeddings (Gouws et al., 2015),
which provide a unified embedding space that re-
solves both monolingual and cross-lingual seman-
tic relatedness of words. In practice, we find this

simple multi-task strategy to bring significant im-
provement to our cross-lingual tasks. Note that,
besides BilBOWA, other joint-training bilingual
embeddings in a unified space (Doval et al., 2018)
can also support this strategy, for which we leave
the comparison to future work.

3.4 Joint Learning Objective
While above learning strategies are based on a
fixed embedding space, we lastly propose a joint
learning strategy. During the training process,
this strategy simultaneously updates the embed-
ding space based on both the dictionary model and
the bilingual word embedding model. The learn-
ing is through asynchronous minimization of the
following joint objective function,

J = LMTij + λ1(L
SG
i + L

SG
j ) + λ2Ω

where λ1 and λ2 are two positive hyperparameters.
LSGi and L

SG
j are the original Skip-Gram losses

(Mikolov et al., 2013b) to separately obtain word
embeddings on monolingual corpora of li and lj .
ΩAij , termed as below, is the alignment loss to min-
imize bag-of-words distances for aligned sentence
pairs (Si, Sj) in parallel corpora Cij .

ΩAij =

The joint learning process adapts the embed-
ding space to better suit the dictionary model,
which is shown to further enhance the cross-
lingual learning of BilDRL.

3.5 Training
To initialize the embedding space, we pre-
trained BilBOWA on the parallel corpora Eu-
roparl v7 (Koehn, 2005) and monolingual cor-
pora of tokenized Wikipedia dump (Al-Rfou et al.,
2013). For models without joint learning, we use
AMSGrad (Reddi et al., 2018) to optimize the pa-
rameters. Each model without bilingual multi-task
learning thereof, is trained on batched samples
from each individual dictionary. Multi-task learn-
ing models are trained on batched samples from
two dictionaries. Within each batch, entries of
different directions of languages can be mixed to-
gether. For joint learning, we conduct an efficient



157

multi-threaded asynchronous training (Mnih et al.,
2016) of AMSGrad. In detail, after initializing the
embedding space based on pre-trained BilBOWA,
parameter updating based on the four components
of J occurs across four worker threads. Two
monolingual threads select batches of monolin-
gual contexts from the Wikipedia dump of two lan-
guages for Skip-Gram, one alignment thread ran-
domly samples parallel sentences from Europarl,
and one dictionary thread extracts samples of en-
tries for a bilingual multi-task dictionary model.
Each thread makes a batched update to model pa-
rameters asynchronously for each term of J . The
asynchronous training of all threads keeps going
until the dictionary thread finishes its epochs.

4 Experiments

We present experiments on two multilingual tasks:
the cross-lingual reverse dictionary retrieval task
and the bilingual paraphrase identification task.

4.1 Datasets

The experiment of cross-lingual reverse dictio-
nary retrieval is conducted on a trilingual dataset
Wikt3l. This dataset is extracted from Wik-
tionary3, which is one of the largest freely avail-
able multilingual dictionary resources on the Web.
Wikt3l contains dictionary entries of language
pairs (English, French) and (English, Spanish),
which form En-Fr, Fr-En, En-Es and Es-En dic-
tionaries on four bridges of languages in total.
Two types of cross-lingual definitions are ex-
tracted from Wiktionary: (i) cross-lingual defini-
tions provided under the Translations sections of
Wiktionary pages; (ii) monolingual definitions for
words that are linked to a cross-lingual counterpart
with a inter-language link4 of Wiktionary. We ex-
clude all the definitions of stop words in construct-
ing the dataset, and list the statistics in Table 1.

Since existing datasets for paraphrase identi-
fication are merely monolingual, we contribute
with another dataset WBP3l for cross-lingual
sentential paraphrase identification. This dataset
contains 6,000 pairs of bilingual sentence pairs
respectively for En-Fr and En-Es settings. Within
each bilingual setting, positive cases are formed
as pairs of descriptions aligned by inter-language
links, which exclude the word descriptions in

words between language versions of Wiktionary.

Table 2: Examples of bilingual paraphrases from WBP3l.

Wikt3l for training BilDRL. To generate negative
examples, given a source word, we first find its
15 nearest neighbors in the embedding space.
Within the nearest neighbors, we use ConceptNet
(Speer et al., 2017) to filter out the synonyms of
the source word, so as to prevent from generating
false negative cases. Then we randomly pick
one word from the filtered neighbors and pair
its cross-lingual definition with the English
definition of the source word to create a negative
case. This process ensures that each negative
case is endowed with limited dissimilarity of
sentence meanings, which makes the decision
more challenging. For each language setting,
we randomly select 70% for training, 5% for
validation, and the rest 25% for testing. Note
that each language setting of this dataset thereof,
matches with the quantity and partitioning of
sentence pairs in the widely-used Microsoft
Research Paraphrase Corpus benchmark for
monolingual paraphrase identification (Yin et al.,
2016; Das and Smith, 2009). Several examples
from the dataset are shown in Table 2. The
datasets and the processing scripts are available
at https://github.com/muhaochen/

Table 3: Cross-lingual reverse dictionary retrieval results by BilDRL variants. We report P@1, P@10, and MRR on four
groups of models: (i) basic dictionary models that adopt four different encoding techniques (BOW, CNN, GRU and ATT); (ii)
models with the two best encoding techniques that enforce the monolingual retrieval approach by Hill et al. (2016) (GRU-
mono and ATT-mono); (iii) models adopting bilingual multi-task learning (GRU-MTL and ATT-MTL); (iv) joint learning that
employs the best dictionary model of ATT-MTL (ATT-joint).

gies, we also compare with the monolingual re-
trieval approach proposed by Hill et al. (2016).
Instead of directly associating cross-lingual word
definitions, this approach learns definition-to-
word mappings in a monolingual scenario. When
it applies to the multilingual setting, given a lexical
definition, it first retrieves the corresponding word
in the source language. Then, it looks for seman-
tically related words in the target language using
bilingual word embeddings. As discussed in Sec-
tion 3, NMT does not apply to this task due that it
cannot capture the multi-granular correspondence
between a sentence and a word.

Evaluation Protocol. Before training the mod-
els, we randomly select 500 word definitions from
each dictionary respectively as test cases, and
exclude these definitions from the training data.
Each of the basic BilDRL variants are trained
on one bilingual dictionary. The monolingual re-
trieval models are trained to fit the target words
in the original languages of the word definitions,
which are also provided in Wiktionary. BilDRL
variants with multi-task or joint learning use both
dictionaries of the same language pair. In the test
phase, for each test case (wi, Sjw) ∈ Dij , the
prediction performs a kNN search from the defi-
nition encoding Eij(S

j
w), and record the rank of

wi within the vocabulary of li. We limit the vo-
cabularies to all words that appear in the Wikt3l
dataset, which involve around 45k English words,
44k French words and 36k Spanish words. To pre-
vent the surface information of the target word
from appearing in the definition, we have also
masked out any translation of the target word oc-
curring in the definition using a wildcard token
<concept>. We aggregate three metrics on test
cases: the accuracy P@1 (%), the proportion of

ranks no larger than 10 P@10 (%), and mean re-
ciprocal rank MRR.

We pre-train BilBOWA based on the original
configuration by Gouws et al. (2015) and obtain
50-dimensional initialization of bilingual word
embedding spaces respectively for the English-
French and English-Spanish settings. For CNN,
GRU, and attentive GRU (ATT) encoders, we
stack five of each corresponding encoding layers
with hidden-sizes of 200, and two affine layers are
applied to the final output for dimension reduction.
This encoder architecture consistently represents
the best performance through our tuning. Through
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, we fix the
learning rate α to 0.0005, the exponential decay
rates of AMSGrad β1 and β2 to 0.9 and 0.999, co-
efficients λ1 and λ2 to both 0.1, and batch size
to 64. Kernel-size and pooling-size are both set
to 2 for CNN. Word definitions are zero-padded
(short ones) or truncated (long ones) to the se-
quence length of 15, since most definitions (over
92%) are within 15 words in the dataset. Training
is limited to 1,000 epochs for all models as well as
the dictionary thread of asynchronous joint learn-
ing, in which all models are able to converge.
Results. Results are reported in Table 3 in four
groups. The first group compares four different
encoding techniques for the basic dictionary mod-
els. GRU thereof consistently outperforms CNN
and BOW, since the latter two fail to capture the
important sequential information for descriptions.
ATT that weighs among the hidden states has no-
table improvements over GRU. While we equip
the two better encoding techniques with the mono-
lingual retrieval approach (GRU-mono and ATT-
mono), we find that the way of learning the dic-
tionary models towards monolingual targets and



159

retrieving cross-lingual related words incurs more
impreciseness to the task. For models of the third
group that conduct multi-task learning in two di-
rections of a language pair, the results show sig-
nificant enhancement of performance in both di-
rections. For the final group of results, we in-
corporate the best variant of multi-task models
into the joint learning architecture, which leads
to compelling improvement of the task on all set-
tings. This demonstrates that properly adapting
the word embeddings in joint with the bilingual
dictionary model efficaciously constructs the em-
bedding space that suits better the representation
of both bilingual lexical and sentential semantics.

In general, this experiment has identified the
proper encoding techniques of the dictionary
model. The proposed strategies of multi-task and
joint learning effectively contribute to the precise
characterization of the cross-lingual correspon-
dence of lexical and sentential semantics, which
have led to very promising capability of cross-
lingual reverse dictionary retrieval.

4.3 Bilingual Paraphrase Identification
The bilingual paraphrase identification problem5

is a binary classification task with the goal to de-
cide whether two sentences in different languages
express the same meanings. BilDRL provides an
effective solution by transferring sentential mean-
ings to word-level representations and learning a
simple classifier. We evaluate three variants of
BilDRL on this task using WBP3l: the multi-task
BilDRL with GRU encoders (BilDRL-GRU-
MTL), the multi-task BilDRLwith attentive GRU
encoders (BilDRL-ATT-MTL), and the joint
learning BilDRL with with attentive GRU en-
coders (BilDRL-ATT-joint). We compare against
several baselines of neural sentence pair mod-
els that are proposed for monolingual paraphrase
identification. These models include Siamese
structures of CNN (BiCNN) (Yin and Schütze,
2015), RNN (BiLSTM) (Mueller and Thyagara-
jan, 2016), attentive CNN (ABCNN) (Yin et al.,
2016), attentive GRU (BiATT) (Rocktäschel et al.,
2016), and BOW (BiBOW). To support the rea-
soning of cross-lingual semantics, we provide the
baselines with the same BilBOWA embeddings.

5Paraphrases have similar meanings, but can largely dif-
fer in content details and word orders. Hence, they are essen-
tially different from translations. We have found that even the
well-recognized Google NMT frequently caused distortions
to short sentence meanings, and led to results that were close
to random guess by the baseline classifiers after translation.

BilDRL-ATT-joint 68.53 0.785 67.13 0.759

Table 4: Accuracy and F1-scores of bilingual paraphrase
identification. For BilDRL, the results by three model
variants are reported: BilDRL-GRU-MTL and BilDRL-
ATT-MTL are models with bilingual multi-task learning, and
BilDRL-ATT-joint is the best ATT-based dictionary model
variant deployed with both multi-task and joint learning.

Evaluation protocol. BilDRL transfers each
sentence into a vector in the word embedding
space. Then, for each sentence pair in the train
set, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with a binary
softmax loss is trained on the subtraction of two
vectors as a downstream classifier. Baseline mod-
els are trained end-to-end, each of which directly
uses a parallel pair of encoders with shared param-
eters and an MLP that is stacked to the subtraction
of two sentence vectors. Note that some works use
concatenation (Yin and Schütze, 2015) or Manhat-
tan distances (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016) of
sentence vectors instead of their subtraction (Jiang
et al., 2018), which we find to be less effective on
small amount of data.

We apply the configurations of the sentence en-
coders from the last experiment to corresponding
baselines, so as to show the performance under
controlled variables. Training of a classifier is ter-
minated by early-stopping based on the validation
set. Following convention (Hu et al., 2014; Yin
et al., 2016), we report the accuracy and F1 scores.
Results. This task is challenging due to the hetero-
geneity of cross-lingual paraphrases and limited-
ness of learning resources. The results in Table 4
show that all the baselines, where BiATT con-
sistently outperforms the others, merely reaches
slightly over 60% of accuracy on both En-Fr and
En-Es settings. We believe that it comes down to
the fact that sentences of different languages are
often drastically heterogenous in both lexical se-
mantics and the sentence grammar that governs
the composition of words. Hence, it is not sur-
prising that previous neural sentence pair models,
which capture the semantic relation of bilingual
sentences directly from all participating words,
fall short at the multilingual task. BilDRL, how-



160

ever, effectively leverages the correspondence of
lexical and sentential semantics to simplify the
task to an easier entailment task in the lexicon
space, for which the multi-task learning BilDRL-
ATT-MTL outperforms the best baseline respec-
tively by 3.80% and 4.80% of accuracy in both
language settings, while BilDRL-ATT-joint, em-
ploying the joint learning, further improves the
task by another satisfying 3.26% and 1.06% of ac-
curacy. Both also show notable increment in F1.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we propose a neural embedding
model BilDRL that captures the correspondence
of cross-lingual lexical and sentential semantics.
We experiment with multiple forms of neural
models and identify the best technique. The
two learning strategies, bilingual multi-task learn-
ing and joint learning, are effective at enhancing
the cross-lingual learning with limited resources,
and also achieve promising performance on cross-
lingual reverse dictionary retrieval and bilingual
paraphrase identification tasks by associating lex-
ical and sentential semantics. An important di-
rection of future work is to explore whether the
word-sentence alignment can improve bilingual
word embeddings. Applying BilDRL to bilingual
question answering and semantic search systems
is another important direction.
