Abstract

This paper describes the development of
French–English and English–French statisti-
cal machine translation systems for the 2011
WMT shared task evaluation. Our main sys-
tems were standard phrase-based statistical
systems based on the Moses decoder, trained
on the provided data only, but we also per-
formed initial experiments with hierarchical
systems. Additional, new features this year in-
clude improved translation model adaptation
using monolingual data, a continuous space
language model and the treatment of unknown
words.

1 Introduction

This paper describes the statistical machine trans-
lation systems developed by the Computer Science
laboratory at the University of Le Mans (LIUM) for
the 2011 WMT shared task evaluation. We only
considered the translation between French and En-
glish (in both directions). The main differences
with respect to previous year’s system (Lambert et
al., 2010) are as follows: use of more training data
as provided by the organizers, improved translation
model adaptation by unsupervised training, a con-
tinuous space language model for the translation
into French, some attempts to automatically induce
translations of unknown words and first experiments
with hierarchical systems. These different points are
described in the rest of the paper, together with a
summary of the experimental results showing the
impact of each component.

2 Resources Used

The following sections describe how the resources
provided or allowed in the shared task were used to
train the translation and language models of the sys-
tem.

2.1 Bilingual data

Our system was developed in two stages. First,
a baseline system was built to generate automatic
translations of some of the monolingual data avail-
able. These automatic translations were then used
directly with the source texts to create additional bi-
texts. In a second stage, these additional bilingual
data were incorporated into the system (see Sec-
tion 5 and Tables 4 and 5).

The latest version of the News-Commentary (NC)
corpus and of the Europarl (Eparl) corpus (version
6) were used. We also took as training data a sub-
set of the French–English Gigaword (109) corpus.
We applied the same filters as last year to select this
subset. The first one is a lexical filter based on the
IBM model 1 cost (Brown et al., 1993) of each side
of a sentence pair given the other side, normalised
with respect to both sentence lengths. This filter was
trained on a corpus composed of Eparl, NC, and UN
data. The other filter is an n-gram language model
(LM) cost of the target sentence (see Section 3), nor-
malised with respect to its length. This filter was
trained with all monolingual resources available ex-
cept the 109 data. We generated two subsets, both
by selecting sentence pairs with a lexical cost infe-
rior to 4, and an LM cost respectively inferior to 2.3
(1091, 115 million English words) and 2.6 (10

9
2, 232

million English words).

2.2 Use of Automatic Translations

Available human translated bitexts such as the Eu-
roparl or 109 corpus seem to be out-of domain for
this task. We used two types of automatically ex-
tracted resources to adapt our system to the task do-
main.

First, we generated automatic translations of the
provided monolingual News corpus and selected the
sentences with a normalised translation cost (re-
turned by the decoder) inferior to a threshold. The
resulting bitext contain no new translations, since
all words of the translation output come from the
translation model, but it contains new combinations
(phrases) of known words, and reinforces the prob-
ability of some phrase pairs (Schwenk, 2008). This
year, we improved this method in the following way.
In the original approach, the automatic translations
are added to the human translated bitexts and a com-
plete new system is build, including time consuming
word alignment with GIZA++. For WMT’11, we
directly used the word-to-word alignments produced
by the decoder at the output instead of GIZA’s align-
ments. This speeds-up the procedure and yields the
same results in our experiments. A detailed compar-
ison is given in (Lambert et al., 2011).

Second, as in last year’s evaluation, we automat-
ically extracted and aligned parallel sentences from
comparable in-domain corpora. We used the AFP
and APW news texts since there are available in the
French and English LDC Gigaword corpora. The
general architecture of our parallel sentence extrac-
tion system is described in detail by Abdul-Rauf and
Schwenk (2009). We first translated 91M words
from French into English using our first stage SMT
system. These English sentences were then used to
search for translations in the English AFP and APW
texts of the Gigaword corpus using information re-
trieval techniques. The Lemur toolkit (Ogilvie and
Callan, 2001) was used for this purpose. Search
was limited to a window of ±5 days of the date of
the French news text. The retrieved candidate sen-
tences were then filtered using the Translation Er-
ror Rate (TER) with respect to the automatic trans-
lations. In this study, sentences with a TER below
75% were kept. Sentences with a large length differ-
ence (French versus English) or containing a large
fraction of numbers were also discarded. By these

means, about 27M words of additional bitexts were
obtained.

2.3 Monolingual data
The French and English target language models
were trained on all provided monolingual data. In
addition, LDC’s Gigaword collection was used for
both languages. Data corresponding to the develop-
ment and test periods were removed from the Giga-
word collections.

2.4 Development data
All development was done on newstest2009, and
newstest2010 was used as internal test set. The de-
fault Moses tokenization was used. However, we
added abbreviations for the French tokenizer. All
our models are case sensitive and include punctua-
tion. The BLEU scores reported in this paper were
calculated with the tool multi-bleu.perl and are case
sensitive.

3 Architecture of the SMT system

The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is
to produce a target sentence e from a source sen-
tence f . Our main system is a phrase-based system
(Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2003), but we
have also performed some experiments with a hier-
archical system (Chiang, 2007). Both use a log lin-
ear framework in order to introduce several models
explaining the translation process:

e∗ = arg max p(e|f)
= arg max

e
{exp(

∑
i

λihi(e, f))} (1)

The feature functions hi are the system models
and the λi weights are typically optimized to maxi-
mize a scoring function on a development set (Och
and Ney, 2002). The phrase-based system uses four-
teen features functions, namely phrase and lexical
translation probabilities in both directions, seven
features for the lexicalized distortion model, a word
and a phrase penalty and a target language model
(LM). The hierarchical system uses only 8 features:
a LM weight, a word penalty and six weights for the
translation model.

Both systems are based on the Moses SMT toolkit
(Koehn et al., 2007) and constructed as follows.

465



First, word alignments in both directions are cal-
culated. We used a multi-threaded version of the
GIZA++ tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008).1 This speeds
up the process and corrects an error of GIZA++ that
can appear with rare words.

Phrases, lexical reorderings or hierarchical rules
are extracted using the default settings of the Moses
toolkit. The parameters of Moses were tuned on
newstest2009, using the ‘new’ MERT tool. We re-
peated the training process three times, each with a
different seed value for the optimisation algorithm.
In this way we have an rough idea of the error intro-
duced by the tuning process.

4-gram back-off LMs were used. The word list
contains all the words of the bitext used to train the
translation model and all words that appear at least
ten times in the monolingual corpora. Words of the
monolingual corpora containing special characters
or sequences of uppercase characters were not in-
cluded in the word list. Separate LMs were build on
each data source with the SRI LM toolkit (Stolcke,
2002) and then linearly interpolated, optimizing the
coefficients with an EM procedure. The perplexities
of these LMs were 99.4 for French and 129.7 for
English. In addition, we build a 5-gram continuous
space language model for French (Schwenk, 2007).
This model was trained on all the available French
texts using a resampling technique. The continu-
ous space language model is interpolated with the
4-gram back-off model and used to rescore n-best
lists. This reduces the perplexity by about 8% rela-
tive.

4 Treatment of unknown words

Finally, we propose a method to actually add new
translations to the system inspired from (Habash,
2008). For this, we propose to identity unknown
words and propose possible translations.

Moses has two options when encountering an un-
known word in the source language: keep it as it is
or drop it. The first option may be a good choice
for languages that use the same writing system since
the unknown word may be a proper name. The sec-
ond option is usually used when translating between
language based on different scripts, e.g. translating

from Arabic to English. Alternatively, we propose to
infer automatically possible translations when trans-
lating from a morphologically rich language, to a
simpler language. In our case, we use this approach
to translate from French to English.

Several of the unknown words are actually adjec-
tives, nouns or verbs in a particular form that itself
is not known, but the phrase table would contain the
translation of a different form. As an example we
can mention the French adjective finies which is in
the female plural form. After stemming we may be
able to find the translation in a dictionary which is
automatically extracted from the phrase-table (see
Table 1). This idea was already outlined by (Bo-
jar and Tamchyna, 2011) to translate from Czech to
English.

First, we automatically extract a dictionary from
the phrase table. This is done, be detecting all 1-to-1
entries in the phrase table. When there are multi-
ple entries, all are kept with their lexical translations
probabilities. Our dictionary has about 680k unique
source words with a total of almost 1M translations.

target segment works are finis

works are ended

Table 2: Example of the treatment of an unknown French
word and its automatically inferred translation.

The detection of unknown words is performed by
comparing the source and the target segment in order
to detect identical words. Once the unknown word
is selected, we are looking for its stemmed form in
the dictionary and propose some translations for the
unknown word based on lexical score of the phrase
table (see Table 2 for some examples). The snowball

stemmer2 was used. Then the different hypothesis
are evaluated with the target language model.

We processed the produced translations with this
method. It can happen that some words are transla-
tions of themselves, e.g. the French word ”duel” can
be translated by the English word ”duel”. If theses
words are present into the extracted dictionary, we
keep them. If we do not find any translation in our
dictionary, we keep the translation. By these means
we hope to keep named entities.

Several statistics made on our internal test (new-
stest2010) are shown in Table 3. Its shows that the
influence of the detected unknown words is minimal.
Only 0.16% of the words in the corpus are actually
unknown. However, the main goal of this process
is to increase the human readability and usefulness
without degrading automatic metrics. We also ex-
pect a larger impact in other tasks for which we have

smaller amounts of parallel training data. In future
versions of this detection process, we will try to de-
tect unknown words before the translation process
and propose alternatives hypothesis to the Moses de-
coder.

5 Results and Discussion

The results of our SMT system for the French–
English and English–French tasks are summarized
in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The MT metric
scores are the average of three optimisations per-
formed with different seeds (see Section 3). The
numbers in parentheses are the standard deviation
of these three values. The standard deviation gives
a lower bound of the significance of the difference
between two systems. If the difference between two
average scores is less than the sum of the standard
deviations, we can say that this difference is not sig-
nificant. The reverse is not true. Note that most of
the improvements shown in the tables are small and
not significant. However many of the gains are cu-
mulative and the sum of several small gains makes a
significant difference.

Baseline French–English System

The first section of Table 4 shows results of the de-
velopment of the baseline SMT system, used to gen-
erate automatic translations.

Although no French translations were generated,
we did similar experiments in the English–French
direction (first section of Table 5).

stest2009) and internal test (newstest2010) sets for the different systems developed. The BLEU scores and the number
in parentheses are the average and standard deviation over 3 values (see Section 3.)

In both cases the best system is the one trained
on the Europarl, News-commentary and 1092 cor-
pora. This system was used to generate the auto-
matic translations. We did not observe any gain
when adding the United Nations data, so we dis-
carded this data.

Impact of the Additional Bitexts

With the baseline French–English SMT system (see
above), we translated the French News corpus to
generate an additional bitext (News). We also trans-
lated some parts of the French LDC Gigaword cor-
pus, to serve as queries to our IR system (see section
2.2). The resulting additional bitext is referred to as
IR. The second section of Tables 4 and 5 summarize
the system development including the additional bi-
texts.

With the News additional bitext added to
Eparl+NC, we obtain a system of similar perfor-
mance as the baseline system used to generate the
automatic translations, but with less than half of
the data. Adding the News corpus to a larger cor-
pus, such as Eparl+NC+1092, has less impact but
still yields some improvement: 0.1 BLEU point in
French–English and 0.3 in English–French. Thus,
the News bitext translated from French to English
may have more impact when translating from En-
glish to French than in the opposite direction. This
effect is studied in detail in a separate paper (Lam-
bert et al., 2011). With the IR additional bitext added
to Eparl+NC+1092, we observe no improvement in
French to English, and a very small improvement
in English to French. However, added to the base-

line system (Eparl+NC+1092) adapted with the News
data, the IR additional bitexts yield a small (0.2
BLEU) improvement in both translation directions.

Final System

In both translation directions our best system was the
one trained on Eparl+NC+1092+News+IR. We fur-
ther achieved small improvements by pruning the
phrase-table and by increasing the beam size. To
prune the phrase-table, we used the ‘sigtest-filter’
available in Moses (Johnson et al., 2007), more pre-
cisely the α− � filter3.

We also build hierarchical systems on the various
human translated corpora, using up to 323M words
(corpora Eparl+NC+1092). The systems yielded sim-
ilar results than the phrase-based approach, but re-
quired much more computational resources, in par-
ticular large amounts of main memory to perform
the translations. Running the decoder was actually
only possible with binarized rule-tables. Therefore,
the hierarchical system was not used in the evalua-
tion system.

3The p-value of two-by-two contingency tables (describing
the degree of association between a source and a target phrase)
is calculated with Fisher exact test. This probability is inter-
preted as the probability of observing by chance an association
that is at least as strong as the given one, and hence as its sig-
nificance. An important special case of a table occurs when a
phrase pair occurs exactly once in the corpus, and each of the
component phrases occurs exactly once in its side of the paral-
lel corpus (1-1-1 phrase pairs). In this case the negative log of
the p-value is α = logN (N is number of sentence pairs in the
corpus). α − � is the largest threshold that results in all of the
1-1-1 phrase pairs being included.

6 Conclusions and Further Work

We presented the development of our statistical ma-
chine translation systems for the French–English
and English–French 2011 WMT shared task. In the
official evaluation the English–French system was
ranked first according to the BLEU score and the
French–English system second.
