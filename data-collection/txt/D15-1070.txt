Abstract

We propose an image-mediated learning
approach for cross-lingual document re-
trieval where no or only a few parallel
corpora are available. Using the images
in image-text documents of each language
as the hub, we derive a common seman-
tic subspace bridging two languages by
means of generalized canonical correla-
tion analysis. For the purpose of evalu-
ation, we create and release a new doc-
ument dataset consisting of three types
of data (English text, Japanese text, and
images). Our approach substantially en-
hances retrieval accuracy in zero-shot and
few-shot scenarios where text-to-text ex-
amples are scarce.

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual document retrieval (CLDR) is the
task of finding relevant documents in one lan-
guage given a query document in another lan-
guage. While sufficiently large-scale corpora are
critical for parallel corpus-based learning meth-
ods, manually creating corpora requires huge hu-
man effort and is unrealistic in many cases.

A straightforward approach is to crawl bilin-
gual documents from the Web for use as train-
ing data. However, because most documents on
the Web are written in one language, it is not al-
ways easy to collect a sufficient number of multi-
lingual documents, especially those involving mi-
nor languages. Let us consider the multimedia
information in documents. We can, for exam-
ple, find abundant pairings of text and images,
e.g., text with the ALT property of <IMG> tags in
HTML, text with photos posted to social network-
ing sites, and articles on Web news posted with
images. Unlike text, an image is a universal rep-
resentation; we can easily understand the semantic

Our idea is to learn the relation between two lan-
guages indirectly by using images attached to text.
If two documents written in different languages
include images with similar image features, it is
likely that the texts contained in the two docu-
ments are similar. Based on this idea, we seek the
relation of texts written in different languages me-
diated by the similarity between images.

content of images regardless of our mother tongue.
Motivated by this observation, we expect that we
can learn the relation of two languages indirectly
through images, even if we do not have sufficient
bilingual text pairs (Figure 1).

Generally, traditional image recognition tech-
niques (or image features) are very poor com-
pared with those in the natural language process-
ing field. In recent years, however, deep learning
has resulted in a breakthrough in visual recogni-
tion and dramatically improved image recognition
accuracy in generic domains, which is rapidly ap-
proaching human recognition levels (Fang et al.,
2015). We expect that these state-of-the-art im-
age recognition technologies can effectively assist
CLDR tasks.

We show that hub images enable zero-shot
training of CLDR systems and improve retrieval
accuracy given only a few parallel text samples.

2.1 Multimodal Learning for CLDR

Multimodal learning, defined as a framework for
machine learning using inputs from multiple me-
dia or sensors, has played a key role in various
cross-modal applications. The most widely used
standard method for multimodal learning is canon-
ical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936),
which projects multimodal data into a shared rep-
resentation. For example, CCA has been success-
fully used in image retrieval (tag to images) and
image annotation (image to tags) (Hardoon et al.,
2004; Rasiwasia et al., 2010; Gong et al., 2014). In
the context of CLDR, each language’s texts con-
stitute one modality. CCA has also commonly
been used for cross-lingual information retrieval
(Vinokourov et al., 2002; Li and Shawe-Taylor,
2004; Udupa and Khapra, 2010). Whereas CCA
can handle only two modalities, we need to con-
sider relations between three modalities because
we use images in addition to the two languages.
Therefore, we focus on an extension of CCA, gen-
eralized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA), to
handle more than two inputs (Kettenring, 1971).

2.2 Zero-Shot Learning for CLDR

Our core idea is to use another modality (image)
as a hub to indirectly learn the relevance between
two different languages. The work by Rupnik et
al. is probably the closest to ours (Rupnik et al.,
2012). In their study, they used a popular language
(e.g., English) with enough bilingual documents
shared with other languages as a hub to enhance
CLDR for minor languages with few direct bilin-
gual texts available. Nevertheless, this method
assumes that parallel corpora of the hub and tar-
get languages exist and therefore, its application is
limited to specific domains where manual transla-
tions are readily available, such as Wikipedia and
news sites. Contrarily, because we use images as
the hub, we can use documents closed with respect
to each language for training. Considering that
current generic Web documents are mostly closed
with respect to one language, yet equipped with
rich multimedia data, our setup is assumed to be
more reasonable.

3 Our Approach

3.1 Overview of Image-Mediated Learning

We use the following notations for specifying each
non-overlapping data division.

1. [train-E/I]: Training documents consisting of
English text and images.

2. [train-I/J]: Training documents consisting of
images and Japanese text.

3. [train-E/J]: Training documents consisting of
English and Japanese text.

4. [test-E/J]: Test documents consisting of En-
glish and Japanese text.

We define IDs for each modality in each division
as given in Table 1. For example, E1 represents
features of English text in the [train-E/I] division.
Typical CLDR based on parallel corpora uses only
[train-E/J] for training and [test-E/J] for evalua-
tion. In the zero-shot learning scenario without
any [train-E/J] data, we use only [train-E/I] and
[train-I/J] for training. In the few-shot learning
scenario, we also use a small number of [train-E/J]
samples. We call this approach image-mediated
learning.

An overview of our system is depicted in Fig-
ure 2. We compress features by principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) and train them by GCCA. For
testing, we compress features by PCA, project fea-
tures by GCCA, then, search the nearest neighbors
from Japanese to English in the joint space.

3.2 Feature Extraction

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of
the most successful deep learning methods for vi-
sual recognition. It is known that we can ob-
tain very good image features by taking activation
of hidden neurons in a network pre-trained by a
sufficiently large dataset (Donahue et al., 2013).
We apply the CNN model pre-trained using the
ILSVRC2012 dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
provided by Caffe (Jia et al., 2014), a standard
deep learning software package in the field of vi-
sual recognition.

As the text feature for both English and
Japanese, we use the bag-of-words (BoW) rep-
resentation and term frequency-inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF) weighting. The MeCab
(Kudo et al., 2004) library is used to divide
Japanese text into words by morphological analy-
sis. No preprocessing approaches like eliminating
stop words and stemming, are used.

3.3 GCCA

GCCA is a generalization of CCA for any m
modalities (m = 3 in our case). Although sev-
eral slightly different versions of GCCA have been
proposed (Carroll, 1968; Rupnik et al., 2012;
Velden and Takane, 2012), we implement the sim-
plest one (Kettenring, 1971) because GCCA itself
is not the main focus of this study.

Let E, I , and J denote English, images,
and Japanese, respectively. For feature vector
xk, ∀k ∈ {E, I, J}, let zk = (xk − xk)hk de-
note its canonical variables. Σij denotes a covari-
ance matrix of modalities i and j where i, j ∈
{E, I, J}. Projection vectors hk are computed
such that they maximize the sum of correlations
between each pair of modalities obtained by solv-
ing the following generalized eigenvalue problem:

1
2

 0 ΣEI ΣEJΣIE 0 ΣIJ
ΣJE ΣJI 0

h
= ρ

 ΣEE 0 00 ΣII 0
0 0 ΣJJ

h
(1)

where h = (hTE ,h
T
I ,h

T
J )

T . The canon-
ical axises h are normalized such that
1
3

∑3
k∈{E,I,J} h

T
k Σkkhk = 1. Additionally,

we add a regularization term to the self covariance
matrices to prevent over-fitting; that is, we set
Σkk → Σkk +αI , where α is a parameter to avoid

the singularity issue.
Despite our training datasets having only two

of the three modalities as given in Table 1, we
can handle this situation naturally by computing
covariance matrices from the available data only.
For example, in the few-shot learning scenario,
we compute ΣEI using E1 and I1, and ΣEE us-
ing E1 and E3. In the zero-shot learning scenario,
because [train-E/J] is not available, we compute
ΣEE using E1 only and use a zero matrix for ΣEJ .

3.4 Nearest Neighbor Search in Joint Space

We can find relevant documents in another lan-
guage by computing the distances from the query
documents using the coupled canonical subspaces.
Having set Japanese as the query language, we
retrieve documents written in English. Nearest
neighbors are obtained as follows:

ĵ := arg min
j

d(ziJ , z
j
E), (2)

where ziJ , z
j
E are projected feature vectors of the

query and target documents, respectively, and d(·)
is a distance function, which in our case, is the
Euclidean distance.

4 Experiment

4.1 Pascal Sentence Dataset with Japanese
Translation

The UIUC Pascal Sentence Dataset (Rashtchian et
al., 2010) contains 1000 images, each of which
is annotated with five English sentences describ-
ing its content. This dataset was originally created
for the study of sentence generation from images,
which is one of the current hot topics in computer
vision. To establish a new benchmark dataset for
image-mediated CLDR, we included a Japanese
translation for each English sentence provided by
professional translators1, as shown in Figure 3. In
this experiment, we bundled the five sentences at-
tached to each image for use as one text document.
Therefore, in our setup, each of the 1000 docu-
ments in the dataset consists of three items: an im-
age, and the corresponding English and Japanese
text.

4.2 Evaluation

We randomly sampled data from the dataset for
each division in Table 1 without any overlap; we
ignored the modality of each document that was
not available in each data division (e.g., Japanese
text in [train-E/I]). We ran experiments with vary-
ing sample sizes for [train-E/I] and [train-I/J], that
is, 100, 200, 300, and 400. Furthermore, we grad-
ually increased the number of [train-E/J] samples
from 0 to 100 to emulate the few-shot learning sce-
nario. The size of the test data [test-E/J] was fixed
at 100. Following this setup, we performed image-
mediated CLDR based on GCCA, and compared
the results with those obtained by standard CLDR
using only [train-E/J] data with CCA. We eval-
uated the performance with respect to the top-1
Japanese to English retrieval accuracy in the test
data. Given that we used 100 test samples, the
chance rate was 1%. For each run, we conducted
50 trials randomly replacing data and used the av-
erage score. All features were compressed into
100 dimensions via PCA and α was set to 0.01.

The experimental results, illustrated in Figure 4,
clearly show that better accuracy is obtained with
a greater number of text-image data in both zero-
shot and few-shot scenarios. We can expect even
better zero-shot accuracy with more text-image
data, although, we cannot increase [train-E/I] and
[train-I/J] more than 400 each in the current setup
because of the restricted dataset size. We sum-
marized results in zero-shot scenario in Table 2
in several cases. Although both GCCA and CCA
show improved performance as the sample size

of [train-E/J] increases, not surprisingly, GCCA
is gradually overtaken by CCA when we have
enough samples to learn the relevance between
English and Japanese texts directly. However, ac-
curacies of image-mediated learning in the cases
when [train-E/J] is scarce are higher than CCA
baseline. Hence, we confirmed that the image-
mediated model is also effective in the few-shot
learning scenario.

4.3 Effect of Image Features

We also verified the effect of the performance of
image features in our framework (see Figure 5
and Table 3). CNN has improved dramatically
over the last few years, and many new powerful
pre-trained networks are currently available. We
compared three different features extracted from
GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014), VGG 16 lay-
ers (Chatfield et al., 2014), and CaffeNet (Jia et al.,
2014; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Additionally, we
tested the Fisher Vector (Perronnin et al., 2010),
which was the standard hand-crafted image fea-
ture before deep learning. We extracted features
from the pool5/7x7 s1 layer in GoogLeNet, fc6
layer in VGG, and fc6 layer in CaffeNet. For the
Fisher Vector, following the standard implemen-
tation, we compressed SIFT descriptors (Lowe,

1999) into 64 dimensions by PCA, and used a
Gaussian mixture model with 64 components. We
used four spatial grids for the final feature extrac-
tion. Overall, the order of performance of features
corresponds to that known in the image classifica-
tion domain (Russakovsky et al., 2015). This re-
sult indicates that when more powerful image fea-
tures are used, better performance can be achieved
in image-mediated CLDR.

5 Conclusion

We proposed an image-mediated learning ap-
proach to realize zero-shot or few-shot CLDR.
For evaluation, we created and released a new
dataset consisting of Japanese, English, and image
triplets, based on the widely used Pascal Sentence
Dataset. We showed that state-of-the-art CNN-
based image features can substantially improve
zero-shot CLDR performance. Considering that
image features have continued to improve rapidly
since the deep learning breakthrough and the uni-
versality of images in Web documents, this ap-
proach could become even more important in the
future.
