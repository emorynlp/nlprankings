Abstract

We present a resource for the task of FrameNet
semantic frame disambiguation of over 5,000
word-sentence pairs from the Wikipedia cor-
pus. The annotations were collected using
a novel crowdsourcing approach with mul-
tiple workers per sentence to capture inter-
annotator disagreement. In contrast to the
typical approach of attributing the best single
frame to each word, we provide a list of frames
with disagreement-based scores that express
the confidence with which each frame applies
to the word. This is based on the idea that
inter-annotator disagreement is at least partly
caused by ambiguity that is inherent to the text
and frames. We have found many examples
where the semantics of individual frames over-
lap sufficiently to make them acceptable alter-
natives for interpreting a sentence. We have
argued that ignoring this ambiguity creates an
overly arbitrary target for training and eval-
uating natural language processing systems -
if humans cannot agree, why would we ex-
pect the correct answer from a machine to be
any different? To process this data we also
utilized an expanded lemma-set provided by
the Framester system, which merges FN with
WordNet to enhance coverage. Our dataset
includes annotations of 1,000 sentence-word
pairs whose lemmas are not part of FN. Finally
we present metrics for evaluating frame disam-
biguation systems that account for ambiguity.

1 Introduction

Crowdsourcing has been a popular method to col-
lect corpora for a variety of natural language pro-
cessing tasks (Snow et al., 2008), although one
of its downsides is the crowd’s lack of domain
knowledge that is helpful in solving some tasks.
Semantic frame disambiguation is an example of
a complex natural language processing task that
is usually performed by linguistic experts, sub-
jected to strict annotation guidelines and quality

control (Baker, 2012). The theory of frame se-
mantics (J Fillmore, 1982) defines a frame as an
abstract representation of a word sense, describing
a type of entity, relation, or event, together with
the associated roles implied by the frame. The
FrameNet (FN) corpus (Baker et al., 1998) is a col-
lection of semantic frames, together with a corpus
of documents annotated with these frames. Simi-
larly to word-sense disambiguation, frame disam-
biguation is the task of obtaining the correct frame
for each word, since many words have multiple
possible meanings.

Using domain experts for frame disambigua-
tion is expensive and time consuming, resulting in
small corpora for this task that do not scale well
for modern machine learning methods – FN ver-
sion 1.7, the latest one at the time of writing, con-
tains only about 10,000 sentences annotated with
frames. Furthermore, only using one expert to per-
form the annotation makes it difficult to capture
any diversity of perspectives.

There have been a number of small-scale at-
tempts at using crowdsourcing for frame disam-
biguation in sentences, showing that the crowd
has comparable performance to the FN domain ex-
perts (Hong and Baker, 2011), and that the crowd
can be used to correct wrong examples that have
been collected automatically (Pavlick et al., 2015).
Crowd performance can be improved by combin-
ing frame role identification with disambiguation
(Fossati et al., 2013), or by asking crowd workers
to give each other feedback and then letting them
change their answer (Chang et al., 2015). Crowd-
sourcing has also been useful to identify the ambi-
guity in frame disambiguation (Jurgens, 2013).

Previously, we have shown (Dumitrache et al.,
2018a) that while the crowd and FN expert mostly
agree over frame disambiguation, disagreement
cases are often caused by ambiguity, such as vague
or overlapping frame definitions, or incomplete



2165

information in the sentence. Because of these
issues with the input data, the approach of se-
lecting one single correct frame for every word,
and ignoring alternative interpretations, often re-
sults in arbitrary, incomplete ground truth cor-
pora. In order to aggregate annotated data while
preserving disagreement, we use the CrowdTruth
method1 (Aroyo and Welty, 2014), which encour-
ages using multiple crowd annotators to perform
the same work, and processes the disagreement
between them to signal low quality workers, sen-
tences, and frames.

This paper presents a crowdsourced FN frame
disambiguation corpus of 5,042 sentence-word
pairs (which has since grown to over 9,000 since
the submission of this paper). More than 1,000
of these are lexical units (LUs) not part of FN.
To our knowledge, it is the largest corpus of this
type outside of FN. In addition, we applied the
CrowdTruth method, in which each sentence and
lexical item is accompanied by a list of mul-
tiple frames with scores that express the confi-
dence with which each frame applies to the word.
This allows us to demonstrate that ambiguity is a
prominent feature of frame disambiguation, with
many cases where more than one possible frame
can apply to the same word. Finally, we present an
evaluation of several frame disambiguation mod-
els using evaluation metrics that leverage the mul-
tiple answers and their confidence scores, and
show that even a model that always predicts the
top crowd answer will not always have the best
performance.

2 Corpus Collection & Analysis

2.1 Data Preprocessing

Our corpus consists of 5,042 candidate word-
sentence pairs from Wikipedia (which has since
grown to over 9,000 since the submission of this
paper) and a candidate list of frames for the word,
with 742 unique frames and 1,705 unique lexical
units (LUs). The sentences have been randomly
selected, based on these criteria:

• The candidate word has no more than 25 can-
didate frames, to not overwhelm the annota-
tors.

• The part of speech of the word is a verb.

1http://crowdtruth.org

• The distribution of candidate frames was op-
timized for maximum diversity using a greedy
approach.

To gather the candidate frames for each word,
we gathered the candidate frames associated with
the LU from FN1.7. Next we completed the
candidate list using Framester (Gangemi et al.,
2016), which maps FN semantic frames to syn-
onym sets from WordNet (Miller, 1995). The sen-
tences were processed with tokenization, sentence
splitting, lemmatization and part-of-speech tag-
ging. Then each word with a frame attached to it
was matched with all of its possible synonym sets
from WordNet, while making sure that the part-of-
speech constraint of the synonym set is fulfilled.
Using the WordNet mapping, we constructed the
list of additional candidate frames for each word.
Framester disambiguation used release 1.5 of FN,
and some frames changed names in version 1.7,
so we manually mapped these frames from FS to
their latest version. Framester disambiguation was
also used to collect a subset of our corpus consist-
ing of 1,000 sentence-word pairs with LUs that are
not part of the FN corpus. For simplicity, we refer
to the sentence-word pairs as sentences in the rest
of the paper.

2.2 Crowdsourcing Setup

We ran the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk,
where the workers were asked to select all frames
that fit the sense of the highlighted word in a sen-
tence from the multiple choice candidate list, or
that none of the frames is correct. We used 15
workers/sentence that were paid $0.05 for each
judgment, and a total cost of $1.35 per sentence
(after factoring in the additional AMT costs).2

To aggregate the results of the crowd while also
capturing inter-annotator disagreement, we use the
CrowdTruth metrics3 (Dumitrache et al., 2018b),
replicating the setup from our previous work (Du-
mitrache et al., 2018a). The choice of frames of
one worker over one sentence are aggregated into
a worker vector – a binary vector with n+1 com-
ponents, where n is the number of frames shown
together with the sentence, where the decision to
pick each of the frames (or none) corresponds to
a component in the vector. The vectors are used
to calculate quality scores for workers, sentences

and frames. Although we make all quality scores
available as part of the corpus, in this paper we
focus on:

• frame-sentence score (FSS): the degree
with which a frame matches the sense of the
word in the sentence. It is the ratio of workers
that picked the frame to all the workers that
read the sentence, weighted by the worker
quality. A high FSS means the frame is
clearly expressed in a sentence.

• sentence quality (SQS): the overall worker
agreement over one sentence. It is the av-
erage cosine similarity over all worker vec-
tors for one sentence, weighted by the worker
quality and frame quality. A high SQS indi-
cates a clear sentence.

The aggregated crowdsourcing results and the
FN 1.5 to 1.7 mapping table are available online.4

2.3 Ambiguity in the Corpus

An analysis of the corpus found many examples of
inter-annotator disagreement, of which a few ex-
amples are shown in Table 1. For 720 sentences, a
majority of the workers picked at least 2 frames
(examples 1-3 in Table 1). And for 1,514 sen-
tences, no one frame has been picked by a major-
ity of the workers (examples 4-7 in Table 1). Dis-
agreement is also more prominent in the sentences
where the LU is not a part of FN (Figure 1).

The disagreement comes from a variety of
causes: a parent-child relation between the frames
(statement and communication in #3), an overlap
in the definition of the frames (accomplishment

4https://github.com/CrowdTruth/
FrameDisambiguation

and successful action in #2), the meaning of the
word is expressed by a composition of frames (in
#7, “straightening of the knee” is a combination
of reshaping the form of the knee, arranging the
knee in the right position, and body movement),
and combinations of all of these reasons (in #4,
“slices” is a combination of part piece and cause
harm, and the other frames are their children).
More example sentences for each type of disagree-
ment are available in the appendix. The sentences
themselves are not difficult to understand, and it
can be argued that all of them have one frame that
applies the best for the word. The goal of this cor-
pus is to show that next to this best frame for the
word, there are other frames that apply to a lesser
degree, or capture a different part of the meaning.
When evaluating a model for frame disambigua-
tion, it seems unfair to penalize misclassifications
of frames that still apply to the word, but with less
clarity, in the same way we would penalize a frame
that captures a wrong meaning. Also, we argue
that models should take into account that annota-
tors do not agree over some examples, and treat
them differently than clear expressions of frames.
Disagreement can also be caused by worker mis-
takes (in #6, dimension refers to the size of the
object, not the act of measuring the size). While
we try to mitigate for this by weighing confidence
scores with the worker quality, the mistakes still
appear in the corpus. This type of disagreement
could be useful in future work to identify exam-
ples that workers need to be trained on.

in sentences where the LU is not in FN skew lower.

1. OS: The Open-Sesame (Swayamdipta et al.,
2017) classifier, pre-trained on the FN corpus
(release 1.7). Given a word-sentence pair, OS
uses a BiLSTM model with a softmax final
layer to predict a single frame for the word.
If the LU is not in FN, it cannot make a pre-
diction.

2. OS+: We modified the OS classifier to per-
form multi-label classification. To calculate
the confidence score for candidate frame f ,
we removed the softmax layer and passed the
output of the BiLSTM model ν(f) through
the following transformation: c(f) = [1 +
tanh ν(f)]/2. This gave a score c(f) ∈ [0, 1]
expressing the confidence that frame f is ex-
pressed in the sentence.

3. FS: Framester includes a tool for rule-based
multi-class multi-label frame disambigua-
tion (Gangemi et al., 2016). While for the
dataset pre-processing (Sec. 2) we considered
the frames for all synsets a word is part of,
FS performs an additional word-sense disam-
biguation step to return a more precise list of
frames. We used the tool with profile T as it
was shown to have the overall better perfor-
mance. FS can only predict FN frames from
the 1.5 release, which is missing 202 frames
from version 1.7.

While OS+ produces confidence scores, the
other methods produce binary labels for each
frame-sentence pair. These models do not
have state-of-the-art performance (Hermann et al.,
2014; FitzGerald et al., 2015), we picked them be-
cause they were accessible and allowed testing on
a novel corpus. Finally, we evaluate the quality
of the TC corpus, containing only the top frame
picked by the crowd for every sentence. This test
shows what is the best possible performance over
our corpus that can be expected from a system
such as OS that selects a single frame per sentence.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics & Results
Instead of traditional evaluation metrics that re-
quire binary labels, we propose an evaluation
methodology that is able to consider multiple can-
didate frames for each sentence and their quality
scores. We use Kendall’s τ list ranking coeffi-
cient (Kendall, 1938) and cosine similarity to cal-
culate the distance between the list of frames pro-
duced by the crowd labeled with the FSS, and
the frames predicted by the baselines in each sen-
tence. Whereas Kendall’s τ only accounts for the
ranking of theFSS for each frame, cosine similar-
ity uses the actual FSS values in the calculation
of the similarity. Both metrics compute a score
per sentence (Kendall’s τ ∈ [−1, 1], and cosine
similarity ∈ [0, 1]). Using these metrics, we pro-
duce two aggregate statistics over our test corpus:
(1) the area-under-curve (AUC) for each metric,
normalized by the corpus size, and (2) the SQS-
weighted average of each metric (w−avg), which
also accounts for the ambiguity of the sentence as
expressed by the SQS. We evaluate on two ver-
sions of the corpus: (1) the restricted set (R-SET)
of 4,000 sentences with LUs from the FN corpus,
and (2) the full set (F-SET) of 5,042 sentences.

The results (Figure 2 & Table 2) show that OS+
performs best out of all the models, even taking
into account sentences with LUs not in FN for
which OS+ cannot disambiguate. FS performs the



2168

worst out of all models on R-SET, because it can-
not find newly added frames from the latest FN re-
lease, but improves on the F-SET (FS can find can-
didate frames for LUs not in FN). The scores on
the F-SET were lower for all baselines, suggest-
ing that sentences with LUs not in FN are more
difficult to classify – this could be because FN is
missing frames that can express the full meaning
of these LUs. TC has a good performance, but
is far from being unbeatable – when measuring
Kendall’s τ over the R-SET, OS+ performs better
than TC.

4 Conclusions

We described a FrameNet frame disambiguation
resource of 5,042 sentence-word pairs, and 1,000
LUs that are new to FN – the largest corpus of
this type outside of FN. Since the submission of
this paper, the corpus has grown to over 9,000
sentence-word pairs. We also provide confidence
scores for each candidate frame that are based
on inter-worker disagreement. We made a case
for this kind of disagreement reflecting genuine
cases of ambiguity in FrameNet frames, caused
by: child-parent relations between frames, frames
with overlapping definitions, or compositions of
frames making up the meaning of a word. The
evaluation method we proposed uses the scores
for multiple frames, and is thus able to differen-
tiate between frames that still apply to the word,
but with less clarity, and frames that capture the
wrong meaning. Our goal was to build a resource
that recognizes different levels of ambiguity in the
expression of the frames in the text, and allows a
more fair evaluation of performance of frame dis-
ambiguation systems.
