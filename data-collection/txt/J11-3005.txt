The lack of reliable Chinese sentiment resources limits research progress on Chinese sentiment
classification. However, there are many freely available English sentiment resources on the Web.
This article focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages
only available English resources for Chinese sentiment classification. We first investigate several
basic methods (including lexicon-based methods and corpus-based methods) for cross-lingual
sentiment classification by simply leveraging machine translation services to eliminate the
language gap, and then propose a bilingual co-training approach to make use of both the English
view and the Chinese view based on additional unlabeled Chinese data. Experimental results
on two test sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform basic
methods and transductive methods.

1. Introduction

Sentiment classification is the task of identifying the sentiment polarity of a given text,
which is traditionally categorized as either positive or negative. In recent years, senti-
ment classification has drawn much attention in the natural language processing (NLP)
field and it has many useful applications, such as opinion mining and summarization
(Liu, Hu, and Cheng 2005; Ku, Liang, and Chen 2006; Titov and McDonald 2008).

To date, a variety of lexicon-based and corpus-based methods have been developed
for sentiment classification. The lexicon-based methods rely heavily on a sentiment
lexicon containing positive terms and negative terms. The corpus-based methods rely
heavily on an annotated corpus for training a sentiment classifier. The sentiment lexicon
and corpus are considered the most valuable resources for the sentiment classification
task. However, such resources in different languages are rather unbalanced. Because
most previous work focuses on English sentiment classification, many annotated sen-
timent lexica and corpora for English sentiment classification in various domains are
freely available on the Web. However, the annotated resources for sentiment classifica-
tion in many other languages are not abundant and it is time-consuming to manually
label a rich and reliable sentiment lexicon or corpus in those languages. The challenge
before us is leveraging rich English resources for sentiment classification in other
languages. In this study, we focus on the problem of English-to-Chinese cross-lingual
sentiment classification, leveraging only English sentiment resources for sentiment clas-
sification of Chinese product reviews, without using any Chinese sentiment resources.

Note that this problem is not only defined for Chinese sentiment classification, but
also for various sentiment analysis tasks in other different languages. The proposed
approach in this study can also be applied for generic cross-lingual text categorization
tasks.

Pilot studies have been performed to make use of English resources for subjectivity
classification in Romanian (Mihalcea, Banea, and Wiebe 2007; Banea et al. 2008), and the
methods are very straightforward. First, they use machine translation for translating
resources (such as a lexicon or corpus) between Romanian and English, and then
they employ the lexicon-based or corpus-based method for subjectivity classification in
either Romanian or English. Similar experiments have been performed for subjectivity
classification in Spanish (Banea et al. 2008). However, our empirical study shows that
sentiment classification performance using these methods is far from satisfactory be-
cause the machine translation quality is not very good according to the recent NIST open
machine translation evaluation results, and thus a language gap between the original
language and the translated language still exists.

In this study, we first investigate several basic methods for cross-lingual sentiment
classification, and then propose a bilingual co-training approach to improve the
accuracy of corpus-based polarity classification of Chinese product reviews. Unlabeled
Chinese reviews can be fully leveraged in the proposed approach. First, machine
translation services are used to translate English training reviews into Chinese reviews
and also translate Chinese test reviews and additional unlabeled reviews into English
reviews. Then, we can view the classification problem in two different ways: the
Chinese view with only Chinese features and the English view with only English
features. We then use the co-training approach to make full use of the two redundant
views of features. The SVM classifier (Joachims 2002) is adopted as the basic classifier
in the proposed approach.

Three machine translation services (Google Translate, Yahoo Babel Fish, and Microsoft
Bing Translate) are used for review translation in the experiments. The experimental
results on two test sets show that the proposed approach based on any machine transla-
tion service can outperform a few popular baselines, including advanced transductive
methods. We also find that the balanced growth of the positive and negative instances
at each iteration in the co-training algorithm is very important for the success of the
algorithm.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work.
Section 3 introduces several basic methods. The proposed co-training approach is de-
scribed in detail in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 present the evaluation set-up and results,
respectively. Lastly, we conclude this article and discuss future work in Section 7.

2. Related Work

2.1 Sentiment Classification

Sentiment classification can be performed on words, sentences, or documents. In this
article we focus on document-level sentiment classification, and research in this area has
followed a lexicon-based (i.e., rule-based) or a corpus-based (i.e., classification-based)
approach.

Lexicon-based methods involve deriving a sentiment measure for text based on
sentiment lexica. Turney (2002) predicts the sentiment orientation of a review as the
average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or ad-
verbs, which is known as the semantic orientation method. Kim and Hovy (2004) build

three models to assign a sentiment category to a given sentence by combining the indi-
vidual sentiments of sentiment-bearing words. Kanayama, Nasukawa, and Watanabe
(2004) use the technique of deep language analysis for machine translation to extract
sentiment units in text documents. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) determine the sentiment
of a customer review by counting positive and negative terms and taking into account
contextual valence shifters, such as negations and intensifiers. Devitt and Ahmad (2007)
explore a computable metric of positive or negative polarity in financial news text.

Corpus-based methods consider the sentiment analysis task as a classification task
and they use a labeled corpus to train a sentiment classifier. Since the work of Pang, Lee,
and Vaithyanathan (2002), various classification models and linguistic features have
been proposed to improve classification performance (Mullen and Collier 2004; Pang
and Lee 2004; Read 2005; Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2005). More recently, McDonald
et al. (2007) investigate a structured model for jointly classifying the sentiment of a text
at varying levels of granularity. Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira (2007) investigate domain
adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on on-line reviews for different types of
products. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008) present a new system consisting of the
ensemble of a corpus-based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier with precision-based
vote weighting. A non-negative matrix tri-factorization approach has been proposed
for sentiment classification, which learns from lexical prior knowledge in the form
of domain-independent sentiment-laden terms in conjunction with domain-dependent
unlabeled data and a few labeled data (Li, Zhang, and Sindhwani 2009). Dasgupta and
Ng (2009) propose a semi-supervised approach to sentiment classification where they
first use spectral techniques to mine the unambiguous reviews and then exploit them to
classify the ambiguous reviews by a novel combination of active learning, transductive
learning, and ensemble learning.

Chinese sentiment analysis has also been studied (Li and Sun 2007) and most
such work uses similar lexicon-based or corpus-based methods for Chinese sentiment
classification.

To date, several pilot studies have been performed to leverage rich English re-
sources for sentiment analysis in other languages. Standard naive Bayes and SVM
classifiers have been applied for subjectivity classification in Romanian and Spanish
(Mihalcea, Banea, and Wiebe 2007; Banea et al. 2008), and the results show that auto-
matic translation is a feasible alternative for the construction of resources and tools for
subjectivity analysis in a new target language. Wan (2008) focuses on leveraging both
Chinese and English lexica to improve Chinese sentiment analysis by using lexicon-
based methods. Wei and Pal (2010) apply structural correspondence learning (SCL)
to minimize the noise introduced by machine translations. In this study, we focus on
developing novel approaches to improve the corpus-based method for cross-lingual
sentiment classification of Chinese product reviews.

2.2 Cross-Domain Text Classification

Cross-domain text classification can be considered as a more general task than cross-
lingual sentiment classification. In this task, the labeled and unlabeled data come from
different domains and their underlying distributions are often different from each other,
which violates the basic assumption of traditional supervised learning.

To date, many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been developed for ad-
dressing the cross-domain text classification problem by transferring knowledge across
domains, and such algorithms include Transductive SVM (Joachims 1999), EM (Nigam
et al. 2000), EM-based naive Bayes classifier (Dai et al. 2007a), Topic-bridged PLSA (Xue

et al. 2008), Co-Clustering–based classification (Dai et al. 2007b), and the two-stage
approach (Jiang and Zhai 2007). Dai et al. (2007b) use co-clustering as a bridge to
propagate the class structure and knowledge from the in-domain to the out-of-domain.
Jiang and Zhai (2007) look for a set of features generalizable across domains at the first
generalization stage, and then pick up useful features specific to the target domain
at the second adaptation stage. Daumé III and Marcu (2006) introduce a statistical
formulation of this problem in terms of a simple mixture model. In recent years, a few
methods/algorithms have been proposed for cross-domain sentiment classification,
including structural correspondence learning (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007), cross-
domain graph ranking (Wu et al. 2009), and spectral feature alignment (Pan et al. 2010).

Moreover, several previous studies focus on the problem of cross-lingual text clas-
sification, which can be considered a special case of cross-domain text classification.
Bel, Koster, and Villegas (2003) empirically investigate three translation strategies for
cross-lingual text categorization: document translation, terminology translation, and
profile-based translation. A few novel models have been proposed to address the
problem—for example, the EM-based algorithm (Rigutini, Maggini, and Liu 2005),
the information bottleneck approach (Ling et al. 2008), multilingual domain models
(Gliozzo and Strapparava 2005), and the structural correspondence learning approach
(Prettenhofer and Stein 2010; Wei and Pal 2010). Shi et al. (2010) introduce a method
to transfer classification knowledge across languages by translating the model features
and using an EM algorithm. The most recent related work includes multilingual text
categorization based on multi-view learning (Amini, Usunier, and Goutte 2009; Amini
and Goutte 2010). To the best of our knowledge, co-training has not yet been investi-
gated for cross-domain or cross-lingual text classification.

3. The Basic Methods

A straightforward method for cross-lingual sentiment classification is to use machine
translation for transferring lexica or corpora of reviews between English and Chinese,
and then apply the lexicon-based or corpus-based method for sentiment classification in
either the English or Chinese language. Therefore, the basic methods consist of two main
steps: resource translation and sentiment classification. According to different transla-
tion directions and classification methods, four basic methods are introduced as follows.

3.1 Lexicon-Based Method in English Language: LEX(EN)

This method first translates Chinese reviews into English reviews, and then identifies
the sentiment polarity of the translated English reviews based on English sentiment
lexica, as illustrated in Figure 1.

For any specific language, we employ the semantic-oriented approach used in
Wan (2008) to compute the semantic orientation value of a review. The unsupervised
approach is quite straightforward and it makes use of the following sentiment lexica:
positive Lexicon (Positive Dic) containing terms expressing positive polarity, Negative
Lexicon (Negative Dic) containing terms expressing negative polarity, Negation
Lexicon (Negation Dic) containing terms that are used to reverse the semantic polarity
of a particular term, and Intensifier Lexicon (Intensifier Dic) containing terms that
are used to change the degree to which a term is positive or negative. The semantic
orientation value for a review is computed by summing the polarity values of all terms
in the review, making use of both the word polarity defined in the positive and negative
lexica and the contextual valence shifters defined in the negation and intensifier lexica.

Figure 1
Framework of LEX(EN).

For example, given a review of the image quality is not good, although the term good is a
positive term, the use of the negation term not reverses the polarity orientation value,
and the overall polarity orientation value of the review is negative. Given a review of
the image quality is very good, the use of the intensifier term very intensifies the polarity
orientation value of good, and the overall polarity orientation value of the review is
positive. In our study, the scope of a negation or intensifier term is simply determined
by using a distance window of two words. We do not use a parser to determine the
scope because the parsing results for the translated reviews are not reliable.

Finally, if the semantic orientation value of a review is less than 0, the review is
labeled as negative; otherwise, the review is labeled as positive.

3.2 Lexicon-Based Method in Chinese Language: LEX(CN)

This method first translates English sentiment lexica into Chinese lexica, and then
identifies the sentiment polarity of Chinese reviews based on the translated Chinese
lexica, as illustrated in Figure 2.

After we retrieve the four translated Chinese lexica, we apply the algorithm for
semantic orientation value computation used in Wan (2008) to predict the polarity
orientation of the Chinese reviews. Each Chinese review is first segmented into Chinese
terms/words by using our in-house conditional random field (CRF)–based Chinese
word segmentation tool, and then the polarity orientation value for the Chinese review
is computed by summing the polarity values of all terms in the review. The terms
defined in the negation lexicon are used to reverse the polarity values of the nearby
Chinese terms, and the terms defined in the intensifier lexicon are used to intensify the
polarity values of the nearby Chinese terms. The scope of a negation or intensifier term
is also simply determined by using a distance window of two words.

3.3 Corpus-Based Method in English Language: SVM(EN)

As illustrated in Figure 3, we first learn a classifier based on labeled English reviews, and
then translate test Chinese reviews into English reviews. Lastly, we use the classifier
to classify the translated English reviews. In this study, we use the widely used SVM

classifier for classification. We also use a transductive variant of the SVM classifier for
making use of unlabeled Chinese reviews, which will be described in Section 5.5. All
English unigrams and bigrams are used as features, and the feature weight is simply set
to term frequency.1 Finally, the sign of the prediction value of the classifier indicates the
polarity orientation of the review.

3.4 Corpus-Based Method in Chinese Language: SVM(CN)

As illustrated in Figure 4, we first translate labeled English reviews into Chinese re-
views, and then learn a classifier based on the translated Chinese reviews with labels.

1 Term frequency performs better than TK/IDF by our empirical analysis.

Lastly, we use the classifier to classify test Chinese reviews. We also use the SVM
classifier (and a transductive variant) for classification, and all Chinese unigrams and
bigrams are used as features.2

4. The Bilingual Co-Training Method

4.1 Overview

These two basic corpus-based methods have been used in Banea et al. (2008) for
Romanian subjectivity analysis. As shown in our later experiments, the two methods
do not perform well for Chinese sentiment classification, because the term distributions
in the original reviews and the translated reviews are different. One reason is attributed
to machine translation. Because current machine translation services cannot accurately
translate reviews, it is inevitable that they bring errors into the translated texts. More-
over, it may happen that different terms are used to express the same meaning in the
original texts and the translated texts, because each machine translation service uses
particular resources and corpora for model building. The other reason is attributed to
inherent domain difference. The review sets in different languages are generally in very
different domains, because they are written by different users in different countries, and
the writing styles, lengths, and term usages of the reviews are very different.

In order to address this problem, we propose to use the co-training approach to
make use of some amounts of unlabeled Chinese reviews to improve the classification
accuracy. The co-training approach can make full use of both the English features and
the Chinese features in a unified framework. The framework of the proposed approach
is illustrated in Figure 5.

The framework consists of a training phase and a classification phase. In the training
phase, the input is the labeled English reviews and some amount of unlabeled Chinese

reviews.3 The labeled English reviews are translated into labeled Chinese reviews and
the unlabeled Chinese reviews are translated into unlabeled English reviews by using
machine translation services. Therefore, each review is associated with an English ver-
sion and a Chinese version. The English features (i.e., all English unigrams and bigrams)
and the Chinese features (i.e., all Chinese unigrams and bigrams) for each review are
considered two different and redundant views of the review. The co-training algorithm
is then applied to learn two classifiers, and finally the two classifiers are combined into
a single sentiment classifier. In the classification phase, each unlabeled Chinese review

testing, that is, the Chinese reviews for testing are blind to the training phase.

594

for testing is first translated into an English review, and then the learned classifier is
applied to predict the polarity orientation of the review as either positive or negative.

4.2 The Co-Training Algorithm

The co-training algorithm (Blum and Mitchell 1998) is a bootstrapping method; it starts
with a set of labeled data, and increases the amount of annotated data using some
amount of unlabeled data in an incremental way. One important aspect of co-training is
that two conditionally independent views are required for co-training to work, but the
independence assumption can be relaxed. In the past, co-training has been successfully
applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie 2003),
part-of-speech tagging (Clark, Curran, and Osborne 2003), word sense disambigua-
tion (Mihalcea 2004), and e-mail classification (Kiritchenko and Matwin 2001). Co-
training has not yet been used for cross-domain or cross-lingual text categorization,
however.

The intuition behind the co-training algorithm is that if one classifier can confidently
predict the class of an example, it can provide one more training example for the other
classifier. Of course, if this example happens to be easily classified by the first classifier,
it does not mean that this example will be easily classified by the second classifier,
so the second classifier will get useful information to improve itself, and vice versa
(Kiritchenko and Matwin 2001).

In the context of cross-lingual sentiment classification, each labeled English review
or unlabeled Chinese review has two sets of features: English features and Chinese fea-
tures. Here, a review is used to indicate both its Chinese version and its English version,
unless stated otherwise. Now we describe the details of the co-training algorithm.

The notations in the co-training algorithm are as follows:

� Fen and Fcn are redundantly sufficient sets of features, where Fen represents
the English features, and Fcn represents the Chinese features;

� L is a set of labeled training reviews;
� U is a set of unlabeled reviews;
� C is a basic classification algorithm, and Cen and Ccn represent two

component classifiers based on C; and
� p and n are positive integer numbers.

The following steps loop for I iterations in the co-training algorithm:

(1) Learn the first classifier Cen from L based on Fen.

(2) Use Cen to label reviews in U based on Fen.

(3) Choose p positive and n negative most confidently predicted reviews (Een)
from U.

(4) Learn the second classifier Ccn from L based on Fcn.

(5) Use Ccn to label reviews in U based on Fcn.

595



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3

(6) Choose p positive and n negative most confidently predicted reviews (Ecn)
from U.

(7) Remove the reviews in Een
⋃

Ecn from U. Note that the examples with
conflicting labels are not included in Een

⋃
Ecn. In other words, if an

example is in both Een and Ecn, but the labels for the example are
conflicting, the example will be excluded from Een

⋃
Ecn.

(8) Add the reviews in Een
⋃

Ecn with the corresponding labels to L.

From the point of view of the algorithm, the unlabeled reviews are added to
the model during the bootstrapping phase, and only for these reviews are the labels
obtained using an average of the normalized prediction values determined by the
component classifiers. In the algorithm, p and n are two parameters controlling the
growth size in the labeled data. At each iteration, at most 2(p + n) reviews are added
into L. The two parameters also maintain the class distribution in the labeled data by
balancing the parameter values of p and n at each iteration. If p is similar to n, the growth
is called balanced growth, otherwise the growth is called unbalanced growth. Note that
the co-training algorithm used in this study differs slightly from the original co-training
algorithm in that the original co-training algorithm is dependent on the sequence of
the two component classifiers, whereas our co-training algorithm is independent of
the classifier sequence. Moreover, each classifier in our co-training algorithm not only
makes use of a few examples confidently predicted by the other classifier, but also makes
use of a few examples confidently predicted by itself.

In the co-training algorithm, a basic classification algorithm is required to construct
Cen and Ccn. Typical text classifiers include Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes
(NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and so forth. In this study,
we adopt the widely used SVM classifier (Joachims 2002), as in the basic corpus-based
methods. Viewing input data as two sets of vectors in a feature space, SVM constructs
a separating hyperplane in this space by maximizing the margin between the two data
sets. The output value of the SVM classifier for a review indicates the confidence level
of the review’s classification. The sentiment polarity of a review is indicated by the sign
of the prediction value. Note that we use all unigrams and bigrams in each language as
features and the feature weight is simply set to term frequency.

In the training phase, the co-training algorithm learns two separate classifiers: Cen
and Ccn. Therefore, in the classification phase, we can obtain two prediction values for a
test review. We normalize the prediction values into [−1, 1] by dividing the maximum
absolute value. Finally, the average of the normalized values is used as the overall
prediction value of the review.4

Several theoretical studies have been performed on co-training in the machine
learning field. Blum and Mitchell (1998) prove that co-training can be successful if the
two sufficient and redundant views are conditionally independent of each other. Abney
(2002) shows that weak dependence between the two views can also guarantee success-
ful co-training. Balcan, Blum, and Yang (2005) prove that a weaker assumption called
ε-expansion is sufficient for iterative co-training to succeed. Wang and Zhou (2010) view
the co-training process as a combinative label propagation over two views, and they

4 Though this method of combining scores is unprincipled due to the fact that the scores themselves are
not calibrated, we found it worked well in practice.

596



Wan Bilingual Co-Training for Sentiment Classification of Chinese Product Reviews

provide the sufficient and necessary condition for co-training to succeed. As can be
seen, the assumption about the dependence between the two views is much relaxed,
which can guarantee that although the English features and the Chinese features are
not conditionally independent of each other, the use of the two views for co-training
is acceptable. In the extreme case, if both classifiers agree on all the unlabeled data,
labeling the data does not create new information, and thus the co-training algorithm
will not work at all. We will show in the experiments that the English classifier and the
Chinese classifier disagree on many unlabeled examples, which can also guarantee the
success of the co-training approach.

5. Evaluation Set-up

5.1 English Sentiment Resources

The basic LEX(EN) and LEX(CN) methods require English sentiment lexica. In this
study, we collected and used the following popular and publicly available English
sentiment lexica,5 without any further filtering and labeling:

Positive Dicen: 2,718 English positive terms (e.g., amazing, gorgeous) were collected
from a feature file6 containing the subjectivity clues used in the work (Wilson, Wiebe,
and Hoffmann 2005; Wilson et al. 2005). The clues in this file were collected from a
number of sources. Some were culled from manually developed resources (e.g., General
Inquirer7 [Stone et al. 1966]). Others were identified automatically using both annotated
and unannotated data. A majority of the clues were collected as part of the work
reported in Riloff and Wiebe (2003).

Negative Dicen: 4,910 English negative terms (e.g., boring, idiot) were collected from
the same file.

Negation Dicen: 88 negation terms (e.g., never, lack) were collected from a feature
file8 used in Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2005; Wilson et al. 2005.

Intensifier Dicen: 244 intensifier terms (e.g., very, absolutely) were collected from a
feature file9 used in Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2005; Wilson et al. 2005.

We then used a large English-to-Chinese dictionary (LDC EC DIC2.010) with
110,834 entries for projecting English lexica into Chinese lexica via term-to-term trans-
lation. If an English term corresponds to multiple Chinese terms, we simply use the first
Chinese term for translation because the first one is the dominant translation.

The basic SVM(EN), SVM(CN) methods and the co-training method require a la-
beled English sentiment corpus. In this study, we used the following popular English
sentiment corpus:

Training Set (Labeled English Reviews): There are many labeled English corpora
available on the Web; we used the corpus constructed for multi-domain sentiment
classification (Blitzer, Drezde, and Perreira 2007),11 because the corpus was large-scale

5 In this study, we focus on using a few popular English resources for comparative study, instead of trying
to collect and use all available resources.

and it was within similar domains to the test set. The data set consists of 8,000 Amazon
product reviews (4,000 positive reviews + 4,000 negative reviews) for four different
product types: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances.

5.2 Chinese Review Sets

The following two data sets were collected and used as test sets in the experiments:
IT168 Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews from IT168): In order to assess the

performance of the proposed approach, we collected and labeled 886 product reviews
(451 positive reviews + 435 negative reviews) from the popular Chinese IT product Web
site IT168.12 The reviews focus on such products as mp3 players, mobile phones, digital
cameras, and laptop computers.

360BUY Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews from 360BUY): In addition, we col-
lected and labeled 930 product reviews (560 positive reviews + 370 negative reviews)
from another popular Chinese online shopping Web site (360BUY).13 The reviews focus
on such products as electronics and furniture.

For these two test sets, two subjects participated in the annotation procedure. The
polarity tags of the reviews were first annotated by one subject and then checked by the
other subject. The conflicts were resolved by discussion.

We also collected the following unlabeled Chinese review set for transductive
methods and the co-training method:

Unlabeled Set (Unlabeled Chinese Reviews): We downloaded 2,000 additional
Chinese product reviews from IT168 and used the reviews as the unlabeled set.14 The
unlabeled set and the IT168 test set were in the same domain and had similar underlying
feature distributions, but the unlabeled set and the 360BUY test set may be in different
domains.

Note that the training set and the unlabeled set were used in the training phase,
and the test set was blind to the training phase. All these data sets are available upon
request.

5.3 Review Translation

For all the data sets described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, each Chinese review was translated
into an English review, and each English review was translated into a Chinese review.15

Therefore, each review has two views: the English view and the Chinese view. A review
is represented by both its English view and its Chinese view.

Fortunately, machine translation techniques have been well developed in the
NLP field (Lopez 2008), though the translation performance is far from satisfactory.
A few commercial machine translation services can be publicly accessed, for ex-
ample, Google Translate (GoogleTranslate),16 Yahoo Babel Fish (YahooTranslate),17 and

12 http://www.it168.com.
13 http://www.360buy.com.
14 Only 1,000 unlabeled Chinese reviews were used in Wan (2009).
15 We used the recently updated MT services for machine translation; we believe that the translation results

are better than those in Wan (2009).

Microsoft Bing Translate (MicrosoftTranslate).18 The three MT systems are considered to
be state-of-the-art commercial machine translation systems, and all three MT systems
provide Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation services. However, it is
not easy to accurately compare the translation performance of the three MT systems
because the three systems are updated frequently. In the experiments, we adopt all of
them for both English-to-Chinese translation and Chinese-to-English translation.

Here are two examples of Chinese reviews and the corresponding translated
English reviews, including the manual translation results (HumanTranslate):

HumanTranslate: More functional and well used.

5.4 Evaluation Metric

We used the standard precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F) to measure the per-
formance of positive and negative classes, and employed the accuracy metric (Acc) to
measure the overall performance of each system. The metrics are defined in the same
way as in generic text categorization tasks.

5.5 Baseline Methods

In the experiments, the proposed co-training approach (CoTrain) is compared with two
groups of baseline methods.

Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3

The first group includes the following three monolingual baselines, which perform
sentiment classification of Chinese reviews based on Chinese resources.

BaseCN1: This method is a monolingual baseline for Chinese sentiment classifica-
tion, and it is lexicon-based. It uses the most popular and publicly available Chinese
sentiment lexica19 for Chinese sentiment classification by applying the same algorithm
as LEX(CN) for semantic orientation value computation. The four Chinese lexica were
collected as follows:

Positive Diccn: 3,730 Chinese positive terms (e.g., /good-looking, /
lucky) were collected from the Chinese Vocabulary for Sentiment Analysis (VSA)20

released by HOWNET.
Negative Diccn: 3,116 Chinese negative terms (e.g., /expensive, /

clumsy) were collected from the Chinese VSA released by HOWNET.
Negation Diccn: 13 negation terms (e.g., /be not, /be lack in) were collected

from related papers.
Intensifier Diccn: 148 intensifier terms (e.g., /totally, /extremely) were

collected from the Chinese VSA released by HOWNET.
BaseCN2: This method is a monolingual baseline based on supervised classification

in the Chinese language. We downloaded a very large number of product reviews
and their associated tags from the popular Chinese online shopping Web site Amazon
China.21 The data set consists of 45,898 positive reviews and 24,146 negative reviews.
The reviews are about various products such as consumer electronics, mobile phones,
digital products, books, and so on. The polarity tag of each review was automatically
judged by the number of the user-assigned stars attached to the review. If the star
number is equal to or less than two, the review is labeled as negative, and otherwise
the review is labeled as positive. We adopt the inductive SVM classifier and use the
large corpus for training. Finally, the classifier is applied for sentiment classification of
Chinese reviews.

BaseCN3: This method is a monolingual baseline based on transductive classifica-
tion in the Chinese language. We adopt the transductive SVM classifier, and use the
automatically crawled corpus used in BaseCN2 and the unlabeled Chinese reviews for
training.

In addition, we perform five-fold cross-validation on each test set. The method first
randomly partitions the original test set into five subsets. During each cross-validation
process, a single subset is retained as the validation set, and the remaining four subsets
are used as the training set. The inductive SVM classifier is trained on the training set
and tested on the validation set. The cross-validation process is then repeated five times,
and the five results are then averaged. Note that the results are produced by five differ-
ent classification models that are different from other methods. The performance of the
cross-validation method can be seen as an upper bound for the monolingual methods,
because the method uses human-labeled Chinese reviews for training, and moreover,
the training reviews and the test reviews come from the same Web site and thus they
are in the same domain. The method is denoted UpperBound(CrossValidation).

The second group includes the following eleven cross-lingual baselines, which
perform sentiment classification of Chinese reviews based only on English resources.

19 Very few Chinese sentiment lexica are freely available on the Web.

Wan Bilingual Co-Training for Sentiment Classification of Chinese Product Reviews

LEX(CN): This method uses the lexicon-based method in the Chinese language, as
described in Section 3.2.

LEX(EN): This method uses the lexicon-based method in the English language, as
described in Section 3.1.

SVM(CN): This method applies the inductive SVM with only Chinese features for
sentiment classification in the Chinese view, as described in Section 3.4. Only English-
to-Chinese translation is needed. The inductive SVM learner aims to build a decision
function based on the training set, and the unlabeled set is not used by this method.

SVM(EN): This method applies the inductive SVM with only English features for
sentiment classification in the English view, as described in Section 3.3. Only Chinese-
to-English translation is needed. The unlabeled set is not used by this method.

SVM(ENCN): This method combines the results of SVM(EN) and SVM(CN) by
averaging the prediction values of the two SVM classifiers in the same way as in the
co-training approach.

TSVM(CN): This method applies the transductive SVM with only Chinese features
for sentiment classification in the Chinese view. Only English-to-Chinese translation is
needed. The unlabeled set is used by this method. Transductive SVM has been widely
used to treat partially labeled data in semi-supervised learning. Different from inductive
SVM, it can leverage unlabeled data and try to separate both labeled and unlabeled data
with a maximum margin. For more details, refer to Joachims (1999).

TSVM(EN): This method applies the transductive SVM with only English features
for sentiment classification in the English view. Only Chinese-to-English translation is
needed. The unlabeled set is used by this method.

TSVM(ENCN): This method combines the results of TSVM(EN) and TSVM(CN) by
averaging the prediction values of the two TSVM classifiers.

SelfTrain(CN): This method uses the self-training algorithm in Mihalcea (2004) and
the unlabeled set for sentiment classification in the Chinese view. The algorithm is a
single-view weakly supervised algorithm. It starts with a set of labeled reviews, and
builds a SVM classifier. The classifier is then applied to the unlabeled reviews, and the
p positive and n negative most confidently predicted reviews are added to the labeled
set. The classifier is then retrained on the new labeled set. The process continues for I
iterations. The parameters p, n, and I are defined in the same way as for the co-training
algorithm.

SelfTrain(EN): This method uses the self-training algorithm and the unlabeled set
for sentiment classification in the English view.

SelfTrain(ENCN): This method combines the results of SelfTrain(EN) and Self-
Train(CN) by averaging the prediction values of the two self-training classifiers. It is
noteworthy that SelfTrain(ENCN) differs from CoTrain in that there is no mutual inter-
action between the English component classifier and the Chinese component classifier
in SelfTrain(ENCN).

Note that the three transductive methods and the three self-training methods are
strong baselines because they have been widely used for improving classification accu-
racy by leveraging additional unlabeled examples. We use the SVMLight toolkit22 with
the linear kernel and default parameter values for both inductive SVM classification and
transductive SVM classification.

Though feature selection methods (e.g., Document Frequency [DF], Information
Gain [IG], and Mutual Information [MI]) can be used for dimension reduction, we

6.1 Method Comparison

In the experiments, we first compare the proposed co-training approach with the base-
line methods. The parameter values for CoTrain and SelfTrain are set as I = 80 and
p = n = 5. The three parameters are empirically set by considering the total number (i.e.,
2,000) of the unlabeled Chinese reviews. In our empirical study, the proposed approach
can perform well with a wide range of parameter values, which will be shown later.

Tables 1 and 5 show the results for three monolingual baselines and the upper
bound on the two test sets, respectively. Tables 2 through 4 show the comparison results
for the cross-lingual methods based on the three machine translation services on the
IT168 test set, respectively. Tables 6 through 8 show the comparison results for the cross-
lingual methods based on the three machine translation services on the 360BUY test set,
respectively. Note that we also present the classification results for the two component
classifiers (Chinese component classifier Ccn and English component classifier Cen) of
our proposed co-training approach. Tables 9 and 10 show the results of significance
tests between CoTrain and the baseline methods on the two test sets, respectively. We
adopt the sign test as a significance test because it is widely used in the field of text cate-
gorization (Yang and Liu 1999). In particular, we use an on-line service23 for performing
sign tests in the experiments. The p-values for sign tests are presented; the performance
difference between CoTrain and a baseline method is statistically significant at a 95%
level if the p-value is smaller than 0.05.

As can be seen in Tables 1 through 8, no matter which machine translation service
is used, the proposed co-training approach (CoTrain) outperforms all baseline methods
on the overall accuracy metric and most other metrics on the two test sets. In particular,
on the IT168 test set, the best accuracy is achieved by CoTrain with GoogleTranslate,
and on the 360BUY test set, the best result is achieved by CoTrain with YahooTranslate.
Even the two component classifiers in CoTrain can perform as well as or better than the
baseline methods. As can be seen from Tables 9 and 10, the performance difference

Among the baselines, the best baseline is TSVM(ENCN). Actually, TSVM(ENCN) is
very similar to CoTrain, and it combines the results of two classifiers in the same way.
However, the co-training approach can train two more effective component classifiers
than those used in TSVM(ENCN). As suggested from the tables, the accuracy values of
the component classifiers (Ccn and Cen) in CoTrain are almost always higher than those
of the corresponding TSVM(CN) and TSVM(EN), based on any machine translation
service. The reason is that TSVM(CN) and TSVM(EN) leverage the unlabeled data
independently, while the two component classifiers in the co-training approach leverage
the unlabeled data in a mutual way, and more useful knowledge in the unlabeled data
can be incorporated into the co-training approach. We can also see that the co-training
approach outperforms the baseline self-training approach, which further demonstrates
the great importance of the mutual influence of the two views during the bootstrapping
phase.

As mentioned in Section 4.2, the English classifier and the Chinese classifier in the
co-training approach are required to disagree on some unlabeled examples, and we

At each iteration in the co-training algorithm, we use the two classifiers to predict
the polarity tags of the unlabeled examples, respectively. The disagreement ratio is
computed by dividing the number of the consistently predicted examples by the size
of the unlabeled set. We can see from the figure that the disagreement ratio is always
higher than 20%, which guarantees the success of the co-training approach.

For the three lexicon-based baseline methods (BaseCN1, LEX(CN), and LEX(EN)),
the LEX(EN) method performs better than the BaseCN1 method, but the LEX(CN)
method performs worse than the BaseCN1 method. The reason is that the sentiment
lexica used in LEX(CN) are automatically translated from the original English lexica,
and the translation is very inaccurate because there are no contexts or clues for sense
disambiguation during the translation process.

For the three monolingual baseline methods (BaseCN1, BaseCN2, and BaseCN3),
the BaseCN2 and BaseCN3 methods outperform the BaseCN1 method. However, the
BaseCN2 and BaseCN3 methods cannot outperform the strong cross-lingual baseline

methods (e.g., TSVM(ENCN), SelfTrain(ENCN)), because the Chinese training corpus
is automatically collected without human checking and thus about 10% of the reviews
are mistakenly labeled. Moreover, the corpus is collected from a different Web site, and
thus the training set and the test set may be in different domains. We also note that no
methods can outperform the monolingual upper bound (the cross-validation method),
because it leverages in-domain human-labeled training set for model learning.

Given any machine translation service, the transductive SVM classifiers can al-
most always outperform the corresponding inductive SVM classifiers on the two test
sets. More specifically, the BaseCN3 method outperforms the BaseCN2 method; the
TSVM(CN), TSVM(EN), and TSVM(ENCN) methods almost always outperform the
SVM(CN), SVM(EN), and SVM(ENCN) methods, respectively, except that TSVM(CN)
cannot outperform SVM(CN) on the IT168 test set with GoogleTranslate. In most cases,
SelfTrain(CN), SelfTrain(EN), and SelfTrain(ENCN) can outperform the SVM(CN),

SVM(EN), and SVM(ENCN) methods, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
use of unlabeled reviews is beneficial to the classification task.

Overall, the use of unlabeled data and the combination of English and Chinese
views are beneficial to the final classification accuracy, and the co-training approach
is more suitable for making use of the unlabeled Chinese reviews than the transductive
SVM and the self-training approach.

Moreover, we find that the three machine translation services perform differently on
the two test sets, and no particular service can always outperform the other two services
on the two test sets. Although machine translation is very important in the proposed
methods, the quality of the three machine translation services offers no significant
differences.

6.2 Influences of Iteration Number (I)

Figures 7 and 8 show the accuracy curves of the co-training approach and two strong
baselines (SVM(ENCN) and SelfTrain(ENCN)) with respect to different numbers of
iterations on the two test sets with GoogleTranslate, respectively. The parameter values
for CoTrain and SelfTrain are set as p = n = 5. The iteration number I varies from 1 to
100. When I is set to 1, both the co-training approach and the self-training approach de-
generate into SVM(ENCN). The accuracy curves of the component English and Chinese
classifiers learned in the co-training approach are also shown in the figures. We omit the
very similar figures obtained with YahooTranslate and MicrosoftTranslate.

We can see that the proposed co-training approach (CoTrain) can outperform the
two strong baselines after a few iterations. After a large number of iterations, the
performance of the co-training approach does not rise any more, because the algorithm
runs out of all useful examples in the unlabeled set. The performance finally has a slight
decline because some noisy training examples may be selected from the remaining
unlabeled set. Fortunately, the proposed approach performs well with a wide range
of iteration values.

We can also see that the two component classifiers show a similar trend to the co-
training approach. It is encouraging that either the component English classifier or the
component Chinese classifier alone can perform better than the strong baselines after a

few iterations. The results show that the effectiveness of the co-training approach can
be attributed to the effectiveness of its two component classifiers.

6.3 Influences of Growth Size (p, n)

Figures 9 and 10 show how the growth size at each iteration (p positive and n negative
confident examples) influences the accuracy of the proposed co-training approach on
the two test sets with GoogleTranslate, respectively. In these experiments, we set p = n,
which is considered a balanced growth. When p differs very much from n, the growth is
considered unbalanced. Balanced growth of (2, 2), (5, 5), (10, 10), and (15, 15) examples
and unbalanced growth of (1, 5), (5, 1), (1, 10), and (10, 1) examples are compared
in the figures. We omit the very similar figures obtained with YahooTranslate and
MicrosoftTranslate.

We can see that the performance of the co-training approach with balanced growth
can be improved after a few iterations. The performance of the co-training approach
with larger p = n will rise more sharply, because the approach can make use of more

selected examples to improve the classifiers at each iteration. Also, the performance of
the co-training approach with larger p = n will become stable more quickly, because the
approach runs out of the limited examples in the unlabeled set more quickly.

The performance of the co-training approaches with the unbalanced growth always
declines quite rapidly, however, because the selected unbalanced examples hurt the
performance at each iteration. We also find that the more p is different from n, the faster
the performance declines. Actually, in the generic text categorization task, unbalanced
training data will lead to poor classification results (Japkowicz and Stephen 2002).

Overall, the growth size has a great impact on the final performance. A balanced
growth can lead to performance improvement, but an unbalanced growth can hurt the
final performance.

6.4 Influences of Feature Selection

In these experiments, all features (unigrams + bigrams) are used. As mentioned earlier,
feature selection techniques are widely used for dimensionality reduction. In this sec-
tion, we conduct further experiments to investigate the influences of feature selection
techniques on the classification results. We use the simple but effective DF for feature
selection. Figures 11 and 12 show the comparison results of different feature sizes for
the co-training approach and two baselines on the two test sets with GoogleTranslate,
respectively. The feature size is measured as the proportion of the selected features
against the total features (i.e., 100%), and we select 10%, 25%, and 50% features in
the experiments. We omit the very similar figures obtained with YahooTranslate and
MicrosoftTranslate.

We can see from the figures that the feature selection technique has a very slight
influence on the classification accuracy of each individual method. This can be ex-
plained by the fact that sentiment classification is different from topic-based text clas-
sification, and the useful feature sets for the two classification tasks are very different.
The popular feature selection techniques are helpful for topic-based text classification,
but they cannot select good features for sentiment classification. Though the feature
selection techniques cannot improve the sentiment classification accuracy significantly,
they can reduce the feature size to 10% while not significantly lowering the classification
accuracy. The large reduction of feature size can improve system efficiency.

More importantly we can see that the TSVM and SelfTrain baselines always outper-
form the inductive SVM baseline, and the co-training approach can always outperform
all the three baselines with different feature sizes. The results further demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed co-training approach.

6.5 Influences of Different Training Sets

In the experiments, the training set provided by Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira (2007)
is a very balanced set (4,000 positive reviews + 4,000 negative reviews). In this sec-
tion, we sample the following two training sets from the original set: One training
set consists of 4,000 positive reviews and randomly selected 2,000 negative reviews
(#pos:#neg=2:1), and the other training set consists of 2,000 randomly selected positive
reviews and 4,000 negative reviews (#pos:#neg=1:2). The two sampled training sets are
not balanced. The proposed co-training approach is compared with the three strong
baselines (SVM(ENCN), TSVM(ENCN), and SelfTrain(ENCN)) on the two training sets.
Figures 13 and 14 show the comparison results on the two training sets, respectively.
We can see that based on the two training sets, our proposed co-training approach can

consistently outperform all three baselines, which further demonstrates the robustness
of our proposed approach.

7. Conclusion and Discussion

In this article, we proposed to use the co-training approach to address the problem
of cross-lingual sentiment classification. The approach leverages only labeled English
reviews and unlabeled Chinese reviews for Chinese sentiment classification. First, the
labeled English reviews are translated into labeled Chinese reviews by using English-
to-Chinese machine translation services, and the unlabeled Chinese reviews are trans-
lated into unlabeled English reviews by using Chinese-to-English machine translation
services. The English view and the Chinese view are considered two redundant views.
Then, the co-training algorithm is employed to learn two component classifiers in the
two views by mutually helping each other. Finally, given a test Chinese review and its
translated English review, the two classifiers are used to obtain two prediction values,
and the final polarity tag of the review is decided by the average of the two prediction
values.

Wan Bilingual Co-Training for Sentiment Classification of Chinese Product Reviews

In the experiments, three machine translation services and two test sets are used
for evaluation, and the evaluation results show the overall effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed co-training approach. The approach can significantly outperform the
lexicon-based baselines, the inductive classification baselines, the transductive classifi-
cation baselines, and the self-training baselines. We also find that the growth size (i.e.,
the numbers of positive and negative examples selected in the labeled data) is a very
important factor in the proposed approach, which has great influence over the final
performance. In particular, a balanced growth leads to performance improvement, but
an unbalanced growth hurts the final performance.

Though we focus on English-to-Chinese cross-language sentiment classification in
this study, the proposed approach can be easily applied to cross-language sentiment
classification in other languages, because the three machine translation services cover
many of the most frequently used language pairs. For most western languages, feature
extraction is very easy because word segmentation is not required. However, for some
Asian languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean), the step of word segmentation is required
in order to split a text into words, and thus a word segmentation tool for the specific
language is necessary. Fortunately, with the progress of NLP research, word segmenta-
tion tools with good performance can be easily obtained for each specific language, and
unigram/bigram features can be easily extracted after word segmentation.

The feature distributions of the translated text and the natural text in the same
language are still different due to the inaccuracy of the machine translation service
and the domain difference between the training set and the test set. In future work,
we will try to develop advanced methods to minimize the feature gap in the two review
sets. Moreover, we will translate both English and Chinese reviews into a few other
languages, and then exploit the multi-view learning techniques for making use of the
multiple views in different languages.
