Abstract

A pun is a form of wordplay for an intended
humorous or rhetorical effect, where a word
suggests two or more meanings by exploiting
polysemy (homographic pun) or phonologi-
cal similarity to another word (heterographic
pun). This paper presents an approach that ad-
dresses pun detection and pun location jointly
from a sequence labeling perspective. We
employ a new tagging scheme such that the
model is capable of performing such a joint
task, where useful structural information can
be properly captured. We show that our pro-
posed model is effective in handling both ho-
mographic and heterographic puns. Empirical
results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our approach can achieve new state-of-
the-art results.

1 Introduction

There exists a class of language construction
known as pun in natural language texts and utter-
ances, where a certain word or other lexical items
are used to exploit two or more separate mean-
ings. It has been shown that understanding of puns
is an important research question with various
real-world applications, such as human-computer
interaction (Morkes et al., 1999; Hempelmann,
2008) and machine translation (Schröter, 2005).
Recently, many researchers show their interests
in studying puns, like detecting pun sentences
(Vadehra, 2017), locating puns in the text (Cai
et al., 2018), interpreting pun sentences (Sevgili
et al., 2017) and generating sentences containing
puns (Ritchie, 2005; Hong and Ong, 2009; Yu
et al., 2018). A pun is a wordplay in which a
certain word suggests two or more meanings by
exploiting polysemy, homonymy, or phonologi-
cal similarity to another sign, for an intended hu-
morous or rhetorical effect. Puns can be gener-
ally categorized into two groups, namely hetero-

graphic puns (where the pun and its latent target
are phonologically similar) and homographic puns
(where the two meanings of the pun reflect its two
distinct senses) (Miller et al., 2017). Consider the
following two examples:

(1) When the church bought gas for their
annual barbecue, proceeds went from
the sacred to the propane.

(2) Some diets cause a gut reaction.
The first punning joke exploits the sound similar-
ity between the word “propane” and the latent tar-
get “profane”, which can be categorized into the
group of heterographic puns. Another categoriza-
tion of English puns is homographic pun, exem-
plified by the second instance leveraging distinct
senses of the word “gut”.

Pun detection is the task of detecting whether
there is a pun residing in the given text. The goal
of pun location is to find the exact word appearing
in the text that implies more than one meanings.
Most previous work addresses such two tasks sep-
arately and develop separate systems (Pramanick
and Das, 2017; Sevgili et al., 2017). Typically,
a system for pun detection is built to make a bi-
nary prediction on whether a sentence contains a
pun or not, where all instances (with or without
puns) are taken into account during training. For
the task of pun location, a separate system is used
to make a single prediction as to which word in the
given sentence in the text that trigger more than
one semantic interpretations of the text, where the
training data involves only sentences that contain a
pun. Therefore, if one is interested in solving both
problems at the same time, a pipeline approach
that performs pun detection followed by pun lo-
cation can be used.

Compared to the pipeline methods, joint learn-
ing has been shown effective (Katiyar and Cardie,
2016; Peng et al., 2018) since it is able to re-

duce error propagation and allows information ex-
change between tasks which is potentially bene-
ficial to all the tasks. In this work, we demon-
strate that the detection and location of puns can
be jointly addressed by a single model. The pun
detection and location tasks can be combined as
a sequence labeling problem, which allows us to
jointly detect and locate a pun in a sentence by as-
signing each word a tag. Since each context con-
tains a maximum of one pun (Miller et al., 2017),
we design a novel tagging scheme to capture this
structural constraint. Statistics on the corpora also
show that a pun tends to appear in the second half
of a context. To capture such a structural property,
we also incorporate word position knowledge into
our structured prediction model. Experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that detection and
location tasks can reinforce each other, leading
to new state-of-the-art performance on these two
tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that performs joint detection and loca-
tion of English puns by using a sequence labeling
approach.1

2 Approach

2.1 Problem Definition
We first design a simple tagging scheme consisting
of two tags {N,P}:
• N tag means the current word is not a pun.
• P tag means the current word is a pun.

If the tag sequence of a sentence contains a P tag,
then the text contains a pun and the word corre-
sponding to P is the pun.

The contexts have the characteristic that each
context contains a maximum of one pun (Miller
et al., 2017). In other words, there exists only one
pun if the given sentence is detected as the one
containing a pun. Otherwise, there is no pun re-
siding in the text. To capture this interesting prop-
erty, we propose a new tagging scheme consisting
of three tags, namely {B,P,A}.
• B tag indicates that the current word appears

before the pun in the given context.
• P tag highlights the current word is a pun.
• A tag indicates that the current word appears

after the pun.
We empirically show that the BPA scheme can
guarantee the context property that there exists a
maximum of one pun residing in the text.

com/zoezou2015/PunLocation.

Figure 1: Model architecture

Given a context from the training set, we will
be able to generate its corresponding gold tag se-
quence using a deterministic procedure. Under the
two schemes, if a sentence does not contain any
puns, all words will be tagged with N or B, re-
spectively. Exemplified by the second sentence
“Some diets cause a gut reaction,” the pun is given
as “gut.” Thus, under the BPA scheme, it should
be tagged with P, while the words before it are as-
signed with the tag B and words after it are with
A, as illustrated in Figure 1. Likewise, the NP
scheme tags the word “gut” with P, while other
words are tagged with N. Therefore, we can com-
bine the pun detection and location tasks into one
problem which can be solved by the sequence la-
beling approach.

2.2 Model

Neural models have shown their effectiveness on
sequence labeling tasks (Chiu and Nichols, 2016;
Ma and Hovy, 2016; Liu et al., 2018). In this
work, we adopt the bidirectional Long Short Term
Memory (BiLSTM) (Graves and Schmidhuber,
2005) networks on top of the Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) (CRF) architec-
ture to make labeling decisions, which is one of
the classical models for sequence labeling. Our
model architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 with a
running example. Given a context/sentence x =
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) where n is the length of the con-
text, we generate the corresponding tag sequence
y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) based on our designed tag-
ging schemes and the original annotations for pun
detection and location provided by the corpora.
Our model is then trained on pairs of (x,y).
Input. The contexts in the pun corpus hold the
property that each pun contains exactly one con-
tent word, which can be either a noun, a verb, an

adjective, or an adverb. To capture this charac-
teristic, we consider lexical features at the char-
acter level. Similar to the work of (Liu et al.,
2018), the character embeddings are trained by the
character-level LSTM networks on the unanno-
tated input sequences. Nonlinear transformations
are then applied to the character embeddings by
highway networks (Srivastava et al., 2015), which
map the character-level features into different se-
mantic spaces.

We also observe that a pun tends to appear at
the end of a sentence. Specifically, based on the
statistics, we found that sentences with a pun that
locate at the second half of the text account for
around 88% and 92% in homographic and hetero-
graphic datasets, respectively. We thus introduce
a binary feature that indicates if a word is located
at the first or the second half of an input sentence
to capture such positional information. A binary
indicator can be mapped to a vector representation
using a randomly initialized embedding table (He
et al., 2017; Wang and Lu, 2018). In this work, we
directly adopt the value of the binary indicator as
part of the input.

The concatenation of the transformed charac-
ter embeddings, the pre-trained word embeddings
(Pennington et al., 2014), and the position indica-
tors are taken as input of our model2.
Tagging. The input is then fed into a BiLSTM
network, which will be able to capture contextual
information. For a training instance (x,y), we
suppose the output by the word-level BiLSTM is
Z = (z1, z2, . . . , zn). The CRF layer is adopted
to capture label dependencies and make final tag-
ging decisions at each position, which has been
included in many state-of-the-art sequence label-
ing models (Ma and Hovy, 2016; Liu et al., 2018).
The conditional probability is defined as:

P (y|x) =
∏n

i=1 exp (Wyi−1,yizi+byi−1,yi )∑
y′∈Y

∏n
i=1 exp (Wy′

i−1,y
′
i
zi+by′

i−1,y
′
i
)

where Y is a set of all possible label sequences
consisting of tags from {N,P} (or {B,P,A}),
Wyi−1,yi and byi−1,yi are weight and bias param-
eters corresponding to the label pair (yi−1, yi).
During training, we minimize the negative log-
likelihood summed over all training instances:

L = −
∑

i logP (yi|xi)
2The word sense has also been shown helpful for the lo-

cation of a homographic pun (Cai et al., 2018). However,
such information may not always be helpful for the location
of heterographic puns. We thus exclude such knowledge.

where (xi,yi) refers to the i-th instance in the
training set. During testing, we aim to find the
optimal label sequence for a new input x:

y∗ = argmaxy∈Y P (y|x)
This search process can be done efficiently us-

ing the Viterbi algorithm.

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets and Settings
We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets
(Miller et al., 2017). The homographic dataset
contains 2,250 contexts, 1,607 of which contain
a pun. The heterographic dataset consists of 1,780
contexts with 1,271 containing a pun. We notice
there is no standard splitting information provided
for both datasets. Thus we apply 10-fold cross val-
idation. To make direct comparisons with prior
studies, following (Cai et al., 2018), we accumu-
lated the predictions for all ten folds and calculate
the scores in the end.

For each fold, we randomly select 10% of the
instances from the training set for development.
Word embeddings are initialized with the 100-
dimensional Glove (Pennington et al., 2014). The
dimension of character embeddings is 30 and they
are randomly initialized, which can be fine tuned
during training. The pre-trained word embeddings
are not updated during training. The dimensions
of hidden vectors for both char-level and word-
level LSTM units are set to 300. We adopt stochas-
tic gradient descent (SGD) (Bottou, 1991) with a
learning rate of 0.015.

For the pun detection task, if the predicted tag
sequence contains at least one P tag, we regard
the output (i.e., the prediction of our pun detection
model) for this task as true, otherwise false. For
the pun location task, a predicted pun is regarded
as correct if and only if it is labeled as the gold
pun in the dataset. As to pun location, to make fair
comparisons with prior studies, we only consider
the instances that are labeled as the ones contain-
ing a pun. We report precision, recall and F1 score
in Table 1. A list of prior works that did not em-
ploy joint learning are also shown in the first block
of Table 1.

3.2 Results
We also implemented a baseline model based on
conditional random fields (CRF), where features
like POS tags produced by the Stanford POS tag-
ger (Toutanova et al., 2003), n-grams, label tran-

sitions, word suffixes and relative position to the
end of the text are considered. We can see that
our model with the BPA tagging scheme yields
new state-of-the-art F1 scores on pun detection
and competitive results on pun location, compared
to baselines that do not adopt joint learning in the
first block. For location on heterographic puns,
our model’s performance is slightly lower than the
system of (Vechtomova, 2017), which is a rule-
based locator. Compared to CRF, we can see that
our model, either with the NP or the BPA scheme,
yields significantly higher recall on both detection
and location tasks, while the precisions are rela-
tively close. This demonstrates the effectiveness
of BiLSTM, which learns the contextual features
of given texts – such information appears to be
helpful in recalling more puns.

Compared to the NP scheme, the BPA tag-
ging scheme is able to yield better performance
on these two tasks. After studying outputs from
these two approaches, we found that one leading
source of error for the NP approach is that there
exist more than one words in a single instance that
are assigned with the P tag. However, according to
the description of pun in (Miller et al., 2017), each
context contains a maximum of one pun. Thus,
such a useful structural constraint is not well cap-
tured by the simple approach based on the NP tag-
ging scheme. On the other hand, by applying the
BPA tagging scheme, such a constraint is prop-
erly captured in the model. As a result, the results
for such a approach are significantly better than
the approach based on the NP tagging scheme, as
we can observe from the table. Under the same
experimental setup, we also attempted to exclude
word position features. Results are given by BPA-
p. It is expected that the performance of pun lo-
cation drops, since such position features are able
to capture the interesting property that a pun tends

to appear in the second half of a sentence. While
such knowledge is helpful for the location task, in-
terestingly, a model without position knowledge
yields improved performance on the pun detection
task. One possible reason is that detecting whether
a sentence contains a pun is not concerned with
such word position information.

Additionally, we conduct experiments over sen-
tences containing a pun only, namely 1,607 and
1,271 instances from homographic and hetero-
graphic pun corpora separately. It can be regarded
as a “pipeline” method where the classifier for pun
detection is regarded as perfect.3 Following the
prior work of (Cai et al., 2018), we apply 10-fold
cross validation. Since we are given that all input
sentences contain a pun, we only report accumu-
lated results on pun location, denoted as Pipeline
in Table 1. Compared with our approaches, the
performance of such an approach drops signifi-
cantly. On the other hand, such a fact demonstrates
that the two task, detection and location of puns,
can reinforce each other. These figures demon-
strate the effectiveness of our sequence labeling
method to detect and locate English puns in a joint
manner.

3.3 Error Analysis

We studied the outputs from our system and make
some error analysis. We found the errors can
be broadly categorized into several types, and we
elaborate them here. 1) Low word coverage: since
the corpora are relatively small, there exist many
unseen words in the test set. Learning the rep-
resentations of such unseen words is challeng-

3Under a pipeline setting, the first step is to detect if a
sentence contains a pun. Then another algorithm is called
to locate the exact pun word residing in the sentence if such
a sentence is detected as the one containing a pun. In our
setting, we assume the detection phase is perfect. In other
words, all sentences containing a pun are exactly retrieved.



2121

ing, which affects the model’s performance. Such
errors contribute around 40% of the total errors
made by our system. 2) Detection errors: we
found many errors are due to the model’s inabil-
ity to make correct pun detection. Such inability
harms both pun detection and pun location. Al-
though our approach based on the BPA tagging
scheme yields relatively higher scores on the de-
tection task, we still found that 40% of the incor-
rectly predicted instances fall into this group. 3)
Short sentences: we found it was challenging for
our model to make correct predictions when the
given text is short. Consider the example “Su-
perglue! Tom rejoined,” here the word rejoined
is the corresponding pun. However, it would be
challenging to figure out the pun with such limited
contextual information.

4 Related Work

Most existing systems address pun detection and
location separately. Pedersen (2017) applied word
sense knowledge to conduct pun detection. In-
durthi and Oota (2017) trained a bidirectional
RNN classifier for detecting homographic puns.
Next, a knowledge-based approach is adopted to
find the exact pun. Such a system is not applica-
ble to heterographic puns. Doogan et al. (2017)
applied Google n-gram and word2vec to make de-
cisions. The phonetic distance via the CMU Pro-
nouncing Dictionary is computed to detect hetero-
graphic puns. Pramanick and Das (2017) used the
hidden Markov model and a cyclic dependency
network with rich features to detect and locate
puns. Mikhalkova and Karyakin (2017) used a su-
pervised approach to pun detection and a weakly
supervised approach to pun location based on the
position within the context and part of speech
features. Vechtomova (2017) proposed a rule-
based system for pun location that scores candi-
date words according to eleven simple heuristics.
Two systems are developed to conduct detection
and location separately in the system known as
UWAV (Vadehra, 2017). The pun detector com-
bines predictions from three classifiers. The pun
locator considers word2vec similarity between ev-
ery pair of words in the context and position to
pinpoint the pun. The state-of-the-art system for
homographic pun location is a neural method (Cai
et al., 2018), where the word senses are incor-
porated into a bidirectional LSTM model. This
method only supports the pun location task on ho-

mographic puns. Another line of research efforts
related to this work is sequence labeling, such as
POS tagging, chunking, word segmentation and
NER. The neural methods have shown their effec-
tiveness in this task, such as BiLSTM-CNN (Chiu
and Nichols, 2016), GRNN (Xu and Sun, 2016),
LSTM-CRF (Lample et al., 2016), LSTM-CNN-
CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016), LM-LSTM-CRF (Liu
et al., 2018).

In this work, we combine pun detection and lo-
cation tasks as a single sequence labeling problem.
Inspired by the work of (Liu et al., 2018), we also
adopt a LSTM-CRF with character embeddings to
make labeling decisions.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose to perform pun detec-
tion and location tasks in a joint manner from a se-
quence labeling perspective. We observe that each
text in our corpora contains a maximum of one
pun. Hence, we design a novel tagging scheme
to incorporate such a constraint. Such a scheme
guarantees that there is a maximum of one word
that will be tagged as a pun during the testing
phase. We also found the interesting structural
property such as the fact that most puns tend to
appear at the second half of the sentences can be
helpful for such a task, but was not explored in
previous works. Furthermore, unlike many previ-
ous approaches, our approach, though simple, is
generally applicable to both heterographic and ho-
mographic puns. Empirical results on the bench-
mark datasets prove the effectiveness of the pro-
posed approach that the two tasks of pun detection
and location can be addressed by a single model
from a sequence labeling perspective.

Future research includes the investigations on
how to make use of richer semantic and linguis-
tic information for detection and location of puns.
Research on puns for other languages such as Chi-
nese is still under-explored, which could also be
an interesting direction for our future studies.
