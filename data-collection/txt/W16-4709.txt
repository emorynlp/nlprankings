Abstract 

Despite advances in computer technology, terminologists still tend to rely on manual work to 
extract all the semantic information that they need for the description of specialized concepts. 
In this paper we propose the creation of new word sketches in Sketch Engine for the extraction 
of semantic relations. Following a pattern-based approach, new sketch grammars are 
developed in order to extract some of the most common semantic relations used in the field of 
terminology: generic-specific, part-whole, location, cause and function. 

1 Introduction 
Terminological work is mostly based on corpus analysis because it is in texts where experts express 
knowledge and make it accessible (Bourigault and Slodzian 1999). The most basic way of using a cor-
pus is by manually reading concordance lines containing a given term. However, this is time-
consuming and inefficient, which has led to the development of new corpus-based methods and appli-
cations to analyze and extract information. 

One of the most common approaches for the efficient extraction of information from a corpus is to 
search for knowledge-rich contexts (KRCs). A KRC is “a context indicating at least one item 
of domain knowledge that could be useful for conceptual analysis” (Meyer 2001). In order to find 
KRCs in corpora, knowledge patterns (KPs) are used, which are the linguistic and paralinguistic pat-
terns that convey a specific semantic relation (Meyer 2001). 

KPs have been successfully applied in many terminology-related projects that have led to the crea-
tion of knowledge extraction tools, such as Caméléon (Aussenac-Gilles and Jacques 2008) and Termi-
noWeb (Barrière and Agbago 2006). However, to the best of our knowledge, currently there are no 
user-friendly publicly available applications allowing terminologists to find KRCs in their own corpo-
ra with ready-made KPs. For this reason, terminologists still tend to rely on manual work to extract all 
the semantic information that they need for the description of specialized concepts.  

In order to fill this void, we propose the creation of KP-based sketch grammars in the well-known 
corpus query system, Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). This allows users to generate new word 
sketches that could be exploited by any terminologist, lexicographer or translator interested in the ex-
traction of semantic relations. 

Word sketches are automatic corpus-derived summaries of a word’s grammatical and collocational 
behavior (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). Rather than looking at an arbitrary window of text around the head-
word – as occurs in previous corpus tools – Sketch Engine is able to look for each grammatical rela-
tion that the word participates in (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). The default word sketches provided by Sketch 
Engine represent different relations, such as verb-object, modifiers or prepositional phrases. However,

with the exception of the recently implemented generic-specific word-sketches, they only represent 
linguistic relations. Therefore, we believe that the development of new sketch grammars focusing on 
the extraction of semantic relations is a timely contribution to the field of terminology, since a sum-
mary of the semantic behavior of concepts in the form of word sketches would allow terminologists to 
perform a more efficient conceptual analysis of any corpus uploaded to Sketch Engine. 

The new sketch grammars presented in this paper have been developed for the extraction of some of 
the most common semantic relations used in the field of terminology, namely: generic-specific, part-
whole, location, cause and function. Section 2 briefly reviews previous work on KPs and semantic re-
lations; Section 3 shows the methodology followed to derive and formalize KPs; Section 4 presents 
our preliminary results; and Section 5 provides the conclusions derived from this work. 

2 Semantic relations and knowledge patterns 
The extraction of semantic relations from specialized corpora constitutes one of the most important 
tasks in terminology work, since many other tasks depend on them (i.e. conceptual modeling, defini-
tion elaboration). From a user perspective, the visualization of semantic relations is essential to com-
prehend how a concept interacts with others in a specialized domain (Faber, León-Araúz and Prieto 
Velasco 2009). 

Thus, not surprisingly, the automatic retrieval of related term pairs has been explored for many 
years and from different perspectives. One of them is based on KPs, which are considered one of the 
most reliable methods for the extraction of semantic relations (Condamines 2002; Marshman, Morgan, 
and Meyer 2002; Marshman 2002; Barrière 2004; Bowker 2003; L’Homme and Marshman 2006; 
Cimiano and Staab 2005; Auger and Barrière 2008; Lefever, Kauter, and Hoste 2014; Marshman 
2014; Lafourcade and Ramadier 2016). The term KP was coined by Meyer (2001) to refer to the lexi-
co-syntactic patterns between the terms encoded in a proposition in real texts, but they were intro-
duced much earlier by Hearst (1992). Since then, much has been written about them. Nevertheless, 
despite their popularity, KPs are still far from being fully studied and exploited, especially in special-
ized domains. Furthermore, as observed by Bowker (2003), there are still major problems with regard 
to noise and silence, pattern variation, anaphora, domain and language dependency, etc. Moreover, not 
all relations have been analyzed in the same depth.  

Patterns conveying hyponymic relations are the most commonly studied since they play an im-
portant role in categorization and property inheritance (Barrière 2004). Some of the simplest examples 
of such KPs are x is a kind of y, As include Bs, Cs and Ds (Meyer 1994) and comprise(s), consist(s), 
define(s), denote(s), designate(s), is/are, is/are called, is/are defined as, is/are known as (Pearson 
1998).  

Meronymy, or part-whole relations, have also been previously researched (Berland and Chamiak 
1999; Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2003) and common patterns include part of, constituent of, 
constituted by, made of, composed of, contains, etc. These relations may be codified by prepositional 
phrases, possessives, and partitive verbs, but one of their main features is the fact that many KPs can 
be polysemic. For instance, including expresses both hyponymy and meronymy; and formed by ex-
presses meronymy and causality (León Araúz 2014; León Araúz and Reimerink 2010).  

Although to a lesser extent, other non-hierarchical relations have also been studied and implement-
ed as KPs, each has their own peculiarities. For instance, unlike certain fairly clear-cut hierarchical 
relations, such as generic-specific, cause has many different subtypes (Marshman 2002). All studies 
dealing with causality affirm that there are many ways to express causation since it can be expressed 
by passive, active, subject-object, nominal or verbal propositions. Moreover, causes and effects have 
very diverse syntactic representations. More specifically, causation is not only expressed by construc-
tions such as due to or because of, but also by causative nouns (cause or consequence) and verbs. Alt-
hough there are many causative verbs (e.g. cause, generate, lead, produce, etc.), their syntactic behav-
ior can also vary. As a result, one single grammar would not be sufficient to formalize their comple-
mentation structures (León Araúz and Faber 2012). 

The above-mentioned patterns are only a simplification of what is actually found in a corpus. For 
instance, when formalizing the pattern is a type of we should also take into account all of its possible 
variants. The verb to be may be in its plural form or substituted by a comma; if it is in the plural, vari-
ous hyponyms will be enumerated to the left of the pattern; the verb to be may be preceded by a modal 

74



verb; the word type may be preceded by an adjective and an adverb; and it may be substituted by other 
synonyms such as kind, sort, example, group, etc. This is in line with the types of KP identified by 
Meyer (2001): lexical patterns (literal strings); grammatical patterns (taking into account POS tags); 
and paralinguistic patterns (punctuation). 

Therefore, these patterns can be useful as they are when manually querying a corpus. However, 
formalizing them in grammars requires finding the balance between precision and recall, and efficien-
cy and complexity. This entails having to decide the number of possible paths that the same grammar 
may cover, how many elements will be optional or compulsory, whether the anchor points should be 
literal words or lemmas, POS tags or punctuation marks, while taking into account negative adverbs 
(not, never, hardly) that would give a false positive, etc. 

3 Materials and methods 
For this study, we used the English EcoLexicon corpus1, which currently contains over 59 million 
words in English and is focused on the environmental domain. Although KPs have been tested in a 
domain-specific corpus, we believe that most of them could also be applied to other domains. Except 
for patterns such as built for or built with, which would only be activated in construction related 
domains, most of them are not domain-specific. 

For corpus querying and the generation of word sketches, we employed Sketch Engine. Corpus que-
rying in Sketch Engine is based on an extension of the CQL formalism (Schulze and Christ 1996), al-
lowing for the formalization of grammar patterns in the form of regular expressions combined with 
POS-tags. CQL expressions in Sketch Engine can be used as one-time queries (giving access to match-
ing concordance lines) or stored in a sketch grammar, which will produce word sketches.  

As previously stated, the only semantic relation included in the default English sketch grammar so 
far is the hyponymic word sketch. Table 1 shows the resulting word sketch when querying earthquake 
in the general publicly available English Web 2013 (enTenTen13) corpus: 

 
 

... is a "earthquake"  "earthquake" is a ... 
 534 0.00   1,295 0.00 

body 57 5.01  disaster 80 7.72

heart 27 5.25  part 57 1.04 

example 26 3.61  time 48 2.20 

 
Table 1….is a word sketch in Sketch Engine.2  
 
The results in Table 1 would not be satisfactory for a terminologist. However, more sophisticated 

hyponymic KPs will soon be implemented in Sketch Engine in order to extract definitions (Kovář, 
Močiariková, and Rychlý 2016). Also, from a terminology perspective, Baisa and Suchomel (2015) 
have already explored hyponymy extraction by using sketch grammars in a specialized Czech corpus 
on the domain of land surveying. In line with our view, they acknowledge that apart from the term ex-
traction function, terminologists need a function for placing the extracted terms in a tree structure. 

Nonetheless, apart from placing terms in a tree structure, terms also need to be linked to others by 
means of other semantic relations. In what follows we explain our methodology for the extraction of 
generic-specific, part-whole, location, cause, and function relations. 

Besides collecting the patterns mentioned by other authors (see Section 2), we also added our own 
based on our experience during the construction of EcoLexicon. All approaches seem to agree that the 
use of KPs for knowledge extraction involves a series of complementary steps. Nevertheless, the order 
of the steps differs depending on research objectives (e.g. identification of term pairs, discovery of

terminological knowledge base on the environment.

new KPs, searching for known KPs to discover new term pairs, etc.). In our case, we followed the fol-
lowing steps: 

 
1. Collection of KPs: this first stage only includes the collection of patterns in plain English 

(no formalism or encoding language used). 
a. Patterns referenced by other authors. 
b. Patterns already known. 
c. Recursive method: term pairs linked by already known semantic relations are 

searched for to find new patterns. Then these patterns are used to find new term pairs, 
and so on.  

 
2. CQL encoding: This second stage consists of translating the KPs collected during the first 

stage into CQL sketch grammars. 
a. Splitting or lumping: Some KPs collected in the first stage can be lumped into a single 

CQL sketch grammar, while others collected as a single KP need to be split. 
b. Addition of adverbs, punctuation, modal verbs, relative phrases, adjectives, determin-

ers, etc. 
 

3. Validation, enrichment, refining 
a. CQL patterns are validated trying to keep the balance between noise and silence. 
b. Enrichment: Testing the CQL patterns with additional optional elements to spot new 

variations of the pattern (for instance, the possibility of an adverb in a place where it 
was not previously accounted for).  Validation of the new addition. 

c. Refining: Detection of erroneous concordance lines obtained with the CQL patterns. 
Analysis of the source of the error, and determination of whether it is appropriate to 
change the CQL pattern. 

 
In the development of our sketch grammars (a total of 56), we have considered different issues that 

are specific to each relation. For instance, there are certain patterns that always take the same form and 
order (e.g. such as), whereas others show such a diverse syntactic structure that the directionality of 
the pattern must also be accounted for. We also had to take into account the fact that a single sentence 
could produce more than one term pair because of the enumerations that are often found on each side 
of the pattern (e.g. x, y, z and other types of w). This entails performing non-greedy queries in order to 
allow any of the enumerated elements fill the target term. However, this may also cause endless noisy 
loops. Sometimes it is necessary to limit the number of possible words on each side of the pattern. In 
this sense, we observed that enumerations are more often found on the side of hyponyms, parts, and 
effects than on the side of hypernyms, wholes, and causes. Consequently, the loops were constrained 
accordingly in the latter case. Table 2 shows a summarized and simplified version of the patterns in-
cluded in each grammar according to the semantic relation conveyed.

These grammars combine our previously retrieved KPs, which act as anchor points, with certain 

constraints imposed by POS tags, punctuation or operators (i.e.?, *, {0,5}), which means that they in-
clude all types of KPs (lexical, grammatical and paralinguistic). Tables 4 and 5 show a sample of the 
concordances that can be extracted with several of our generic-specific and causal grammars:

The combination of our sketch grammars with the statistics used in the Sketch Engine system has 
yielded encouraging results.  To show the potential of this initial approach, we have selected different 
concepts showing word sketches for all types of relation and their inverse in Table 7. The results are 
sorted by frequency. Because of space constraints, only the first few results of each word sketch are 
shown.

Table 7. Examples of different word sketches obtained with our sketch grammars 
 
There are several issues that still need to be dealt with in order to improve the outcome of these 

grammars. For instance, (1) there is still noise because the grammars need to be refined, especially that 
of function, where target terms may be nouns or verbs, and verbs are not always semantically relevant 
or self-contained (i.e. make, produce) and need an object to constitute a meaningful proposition; (2) 
most false positives (i.e. fungus or plant as a type of bacterium, or type as something located at a vol-
cano, as shown in Table 5) are due to the imprecision of certain grammars or even to some mistakes 
derived from the POS tagger; (3) there is also pattern ambiguity that could only be solved by adding 
semantic constraints on the type of entities being linked (as done by Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 
2003); (4) and semantic relations are also ambiguous, for example in the sense that distinguishing  
parts from locations is not always an easy task (i.e. cone could be a part of a volcano or be located in a 
volcano). Furthermore, of these issues there is one related to the processing of multiword expressions. 
So far, these word sketches only retrieve one-word terms, which is one of the causes of noise and lack 
of precision. This can be solved relatively easily (Kilgarriff et al. 2012), but poses the challenge of 
differentiating between multiword terms and usual collocations. For instance, in sentences (1) and (2) 
only shield volcano should take the role of the hyponym, whereas huge would only qualify as a simple 
modifier of volcano.  

 
(1) “…monogenetic volcanoes are smaller than polygenetic volcanoes, such as shield volcanoes...” 
(2) “…with igneous and tectonic features such as huge volcanoes and rift valleys...” 
 

5 Conclusions and future work 
In this paper we have shown how KPs can be converted into sketch grammars to generate new word 
sketches showing semantic relations. The resulting word sketches can be of great value to terminolo-
gists during the conceptual modeling of any domain. However, much remains to be done. First of all, 
the sketch grammars should be refined as new patterns are found and extended to include multiword 
terms. New grammars will also be needed to include other semantic relations, especially those related 
to process concept types, such as temporal relations. Precision and recall studies will be performed in 
order to improve the grammars and find the right balance between noise and silence. Finally, pattern 
disambiguation techniques are also needed for polysemic KPs.
