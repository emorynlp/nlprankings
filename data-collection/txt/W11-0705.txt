Abstract

We examine sentiment analysis on Twitter
data. The contributions of this paper are: (1)
We introduce POS-specific prior polarity fea-
tures. (2) We explore the use of a tree kernel to
obviate the need for tedious feature engineer-
ing. The new features (in conjunction with
previously proposed features) and the tree ker-
nel perform approximately at the same level,
both outperforming the state-of-the-art base-
line.

1 Introduction

Microblogging websites have evolved to become a
source of varied kind of information. This is due to
nature of microblogs on which people post real time
messages about their opinions on a variety of topics,
discuss current issues, complain, and express posi-
tive sentiment for products they use in daily life. In
fact, companies manufacturing such products have
started to poll these microblogs to get a sense of gen-
eral sentiment for their product. Many times these
companies study user reactions and reply to users on
microblogs. One challenge is to build technology to
detect and summarize an overall sentiment.

In this paper, we look at one such popular mi-
croblog called Twitter and build models for classify-
ing “tweets” into positive, negative and neutral senti-
ment. We build models for two classification tasks:
a binary task of classifying sentiment into positive
and negative classes and a 3-way task of classi-
fying sentiment into positive, negative and neutral
classes. We experiment with three types of models:
unigram model, a feature based model and a tree

kernel based model. For the feature based model
we use some of the features proposed in past liter-
ature and propose new features. For the tree ker-
nel based model we design a new tree representa-
tion for tweets. We use a unigram model, previously
shown to work well for sentiment analysis for Twit-
ter data, as our baseline. Our experiments show that
a unigram model is indeed a hard baseline achieving
over 20% over the chance baseline for both classifi-
cation tasks. Our feature based model that uses only
100 features achieves similar accuracy as the uni-
gram model that uses over 10,000 features. Our tree
kernel based model outperforms both these models
by a significant margin. We also experiment with
a combination of models: combining unigrams with
our features and combining our features with the tree
kernel. Both these combinations outperform the un-
igram baseline by over 4% for both classification
tasks. In this paper, we present extensive feature
analysis of the 100 features we propose. Our ex-
periments show that features that have to do with
Twitter-specific features (emoticons, hashtags etc.)
add value to the classifier but only marginally. Fea-
tures that combine prior polarity of words with their
parts-of-speech tags are most important for both the
classification tasks. Thus, we see that standard nat-
ural language processing tools are useful even in
a genre which is quite different from the genre on
which they were trained (newswire). Furthermore,
we also show that the tree kernel model performs
roughly as well as the best feature based models,
even though it does not require detailed feature en-
gineering.

We use manually annotated Twitter data for our

30



experiments. One advantage of this data, over pre-
viously used data-sets, is that the tweets are col-
lected in a streaming fashion and therefore represent
a true sample of actual tweets in terms of language
use and content. Our new data set is available to
other researchers. In this paper we also introduce
two resources which are available (contact the first
author): 1) a hand annotated dictionary for emoti-
cons that maps emoticons to their polarity and 2)
an acronym dictionary collected from the web with
English translations of over 5000 frequently used
acronyms.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, we discuss classification tasks like sen-
timent analysis on micro-blog data. In section 3,
we give details about the data. In section 4 we dis-
cuss our pre-processing technique and additional re-
sources. In section 5 we present our prior polarity
scoring scheme. In section 6 we present the design
of our tree kernel. In section 7 we give details of our
feature based approach. In section 8 we present our
experiments and discuss the results. We conclude
and give future directions of research in section 9.

2 Literature Survey

Sentiment analysis has been handled as a Natural
Language Processing task at many levels of gran-
ularity. Starting from being a document level classi-
fication task (Turney, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004), it
has been handled at the sentence level (Hu and Liu,
2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) and more recently at
the phrase level (Wilson et al., 2005; Agarwal et al.,
2009).

Microblog data like Twitter, on which users post
real time reactions to and opinions about “every-
thing”, poses newer and different challenges. Some
of the early and recent results on sentiment analysis
of Twitter data are by Go et al. (2009), (Bermingham
and Smeaton, 2010) and Pak and Paroubek (2010).
Go et al. (2009) use distant learning to acquire senti-
ment data. They use tweets ending in positive emoti-
cons like “:)” “:-)” as positive and negative emoti-
cons like “:(” “:-(” as negative. They build mod-
els using Naive Bayes, MaxEnt and Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM), and they report SVM outper-
forms other classifiers. In terms of feature space,
they try a Unigram, Bigram model in conjunction

with parts-of-speech (POS) features. They note that
the unigram model outperforms all other models.
Specifically, bigrams and POS features do not help.
Pak and Paroubek (2010) collect data following a
similar distant learning paradigm. They perform a
different classification task though: subjective ver-
sus objective. For subjective data they collect the
tweets ending with emoticons in the same manner
as Go et al. (2009). For objective data they crawl
twitter accounts of popular newspapers like “New
York Times”, “Washington Posts” etc. They re-
port that POS and bigrams both help (contrary to
results presented by Go et al. (2009)). Both these
approaches, however, are primarily based on ngram
models. Moreover, the data they use for training and
testing is collected by search queries and is therefore
biased. In contrast, we present features that achieve
a significant gain over a unigram baseline. In addi-
tion we explore a different method of data represen-
tation and report significant improvement over the
unigram models. Another contribution of this paper
is that we report results on manually annotated data
that does not suffer from any known biases. Our
data is a random sample of streaming tweets unlike
data collected by using specific queries. The size
of our hand-labeled data allows us to perform cross-
validation experiments and check for the variance in
performance of the classifier across folds.

Another significant effort for sentiment classifica-
tion on Twitter data is by Barbosa and Feng (2010).
They use polarity predictions from three websites as
noisy labels to train a model and use 1000 manually
labeled tweets for tuning and another 1000 manu-
ally labeled tweets for testing. They however do
not mention how they collect their test data. They
propose the use of syntax features of tweets like
retweet, hashtags, link, punctuation and exclamation
marks in conjunction with features like prior polar-
ity of words and POS of words. We extend their
approach by using real valued prior polarity, and by
combining prior polarity with POS. Our results show
that the features that enhance the performance of our
classifiers the most are features that combine prior
polarity of words with their parts of speech. The
tweet syntax features help but only marginally.

Gamon (2004) perform sentiment analysis on
feeadback data from Global Support Services sur-
vey. One aim of their paper is to analyze the role

31



of linguistic features like POS tags. They perform
extensive feature analysis and feature selection and
demonstrate that abstract linguistic analysis features
contributes to the classifier accuracy. In this paper
we perform extensive feature analysis and show that
the use of only 100 abstract linguistic features per-
forms as well as a hard unigram baseline.

3 Data Description

Twitter is a social networking and microblogging
service that allows users to post real time messages,
called tweets. Tweets are short messages, restricted
to 140 characters in length. Due to the nature of this
microblogging service (quick and short messages),
people use acronyms, make spelling mistakes, use
emoticons and other characters that express special
meanings. Following is a brief terminology associ-
ated with tweets. Emoticons: These are facial ex-
pressions pictorially represented using punctuation
and letters; they express the user’s mood. Target:
Users of Twitter use the “@” symbol to refer to other
users on the microblog. Referring to other users in
this manner automatically alerts them. Hashtags:
Users usually use hashtags to mark topics. This
is primarily done to increase the visibility of their
tweets.

We acquire 11,875 manually annotated Twitter
data (tweets) from a commercial source. They have
made part of their data publicly available. For infor-
mation on how to obtain the data, see Acknowledg-
ments section at the end of the paper. They collected
the data by archiving the real-time stream. No lan-
guage, location or any other kind of restriction was
made during the streaming process. In fact, their
collection consists of tweets in foreign languages.
They use Google translate to convert it into English
before the annotation process. Each tweet is labeled
by a human annotator as positive, negative, neutral
or junk. The “junk” label means that the tweet can-
not be understood by a human annotator. A man-
ual analysis of a random sample of tweets labeled
as “junk” suggested that many of these tweets were
those that were not translated well using Google
translate. We eliminate the tweets with junk la-
bel for experiments. This leaves us with an unbal-
anced sample of 8,753 tweets. We use stratified sam-
pling to get a balanced data-set of 5127 tweets (1709

tweets each from classes positive, negative and neu-
tral).

4 Resources and Pre-processing of data

In this paper we introduce two new resources for
pre-processing twitter data: 1) an emoticon dictio-
nary and 2) an acronym dictionary. We prepare
the emoticon dictionary by labeling 170 emoticons
listed on Wikipedia1 with their emotional state. For
example, “:)” is labeled as positive whereas “:=(” is
labeled as negative. We assign each emoticon a label
from the following set of labels: Extremely-positive,
Extremely-negative, Positive, Negative, and Neu-
tral. We compile an acronym dictionary from an on-
line resource.2 The dictionary has translations for
5,184 acronyms. For example, lol is translated to
laughing out loud.

We pre-process all the tweets as follows: a) re-
place all the emoticons with a their sentiment po-
larity by looking up the emoticon dictionary, b) re-
place all URLs with a tag ||U ||, c) replace targets
(e.g. “@John”) with tag ||T ||, d) replace all nega-
tions (e.g. not, no, never, n’t, cannot) by tag “NOT”,
and e) replace a sequence of repeated characters by
three characters, for example, convert coooooooool
to coool. We do not replace the sequence by only
two characters since we want to differentiate be-
tween the regular usage and emphasized usage of the
word.

Table 1: Example acrynom and their expansion in the
acronym dictionary.

We present some preliminary statistics about the
data in Table 3. We use the Stanford tokenizer (Klein
and Manning, 2003) to tokenize the tweets. We use
a stop word dictionary3 to identify stop words. All
the other words which are found in WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) are counted as English words. We use

the standard tagset defined by the Penn Treebank for
identifying punctuation. We record the occurrence
of three standard twitter tags: emoticons, URLs and
targets. The remaining tokens are either non English
words (like coool, zzz etc.) or other symbols.

Number of tokens 79,152
Number of stop words 30,371
Number of English words 23,837
Number of punctuation marks 9,356
Number of capitalized words 4,851
Number of twitter tags 3,371
Number of exclamation marks 2,228
Number of negations 942
Number of other tokens 9047

Table 3: Statistics about the data used for our experi-
ments.

In Table 3 we see that 38.3% of the tokens are stop
words, 30.1% of the tokens are found in WordNet
and 1.2% tokens are negation words. 11.8% of all
the tokens are punctuation marks excluding excla-
mation marks which make up for 2.8% of all tokens.
In total, 84.1% of all tokens are tokens that we ex-
pect to see in a typical English language text. There
are 4.2% tags that are specific to Twitter which in-
clude emoticons, target, hastags and “RT” (retweet).
The remaining 11.7% tokens are either words that
cannot be found in WordNet (like Zzzzz, kewl) or
special symbols which do not fall in the category of
Twitter tags.

5 Prior polarity scoring

A number of our features are based on prior po-
larity of words. For obtaining the prior polarity of
words, we take motivation from work by Agarwal
et al. (2009). We use Dictionary of Affect in Lan-
guage (DAL) (Whissel, 1989) and extend it using

WordNet. This dictionary of about 8000 English
language words assigns every word a pleasantness
score (∈ R) between 1 (Negative) - 3 (Positive). We
first normalize the scores by diving each score my
the scale (which is equal to 3). We consider words
with polarity less than 0.5 as negative, higher than
0.8 as positive and the rest as neutral. If a word is not
directly found in the dictionary, we retrieve all syn-
onyms from Wordnet. We then look for each of the
synonyms in DAL. If any synonym is found in DAL,
we assign the original word the same pleasantness
score as its synonym. If none of the synonyms is
present in DAL, the word is not associated with any
prior polarity. For the given data we directly found
prior polarity of 81.1% of the words. We find po-
larity of other 7.8% of the words by using WordNet.
So we find prior polarity of about 88.9% of English
language words.

6 Design of Tree Kernel

We design a tree representation of tweets to combine
many categories of features in one succinct conve-
nient representation. For calculating the similarity
between two trees we use a Partial Tree (PT) ker-
nel first proposed by Moschitti (2006). A PT ker-
nel calculates the similarity between two trees by
comparing all possible sub-trees. This tree kernel
is an instance of a general class of convolution ker-
nels. Convolution Kernels, first introduced by Haus-
sler (1999), can be used to compare abstract objects,
like strings, instead of feature vectors. This is be-
cause these kernels involve a recursive calculation
over the “parts” of abstract object. This calculation
is made computationally efficient by using Dynamic
Programming techniques. By considering all possi-
ble combinations of fragments, tree kernels capture
any possible correlation between features and cate-
gories of features.

Figure 1 shows an example of the tree structure
we design. This tree is for a synthesized tweet:
@Fernando this isn’t a great day for playing the
HARP! :). We use the following procedure to con-
vert a tweet into a tree representation: Initialize the
main tree to be “ROOT”. Then tokenize each tweet
and for each token: a) if the token is a target, emoti-
con, exclamation mark, other punctuation mark, or a
negation word, add a leaf node to the “ROOT” with

the corresponding tag. For example, in the tree in
Figure 1 we add tag ||T || (target) for “@Fernando”,
add tag “NOT” for the token “n’t”, add tag “EXC”
for the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence
and add ||P || for the emoticon representing positive
mood. b) if the token is a stop word, we simply add
the subtree “ (STOP (‘stop-word’))” to “ROOT”. For
instance, we add a subtree corresponding to each of
the stop words: this, is, and for. c) if the token is
an English language word, we map the word to its
part-of-speech tag, calculate the prior polarity of the
word using the procedure described in section 5 and
add the subtree (EW (‘POS’ ‘word’ ‘prior polarity’))
to the “ROOT”. For example, we add the subtree
(EW (JJ great POS)) for the word great. “EW” refers
to English word. d) For any other token <token>
we add subtree “(NE (<token>))” to the “ROOT”.
“NE” refers to non-English.

The PT tree kernel creates all possible subtrees
and compares them to each other. These subtrees
include subtrees in which non-adjacent branches be-
come adjacent by excising other branches, though
order is preserved. In Figure 1, we show some of
the tree fragments that the PT kernel will attempt to
compare with tree fragments from other trees. For
example, given the tree (EW (JJ) (great) (POS)), the
PT kernel will use (EW (JJ) (great) (POS)), (EW
(great) (POS)), (EW (JJ) (POS)), (EW (JJ) (great)),
(EW (JJ)), (EW (great)), (EW (POS)), (EW), (JJ),
(great), and (POS). This means that the PT tree ker-
nel attempts to use full information, and also ab-
stracts away from specific information (such as the
lexical item). In this manner, it is not necessary to

create by hand features at all levels of abstraction.

7 Our features

We propose a set of features listed in Table 4 for our
experiments. These are a total of 50 type of features.
We calculate these features for the whole tweet and
for the last one-third of the tweet. In total we get
100 additional features. We refer to these features as
Senti-features throughout the paper.

Our features can be divided into three broad cat-
egories: ones that are primarily counts of various
features and therefore the value of the feature is a
natural number ∈ N. Second, features whose value
is a real number ∈ R. These are primarily features
that capture the score retrieved from DAL. Thirdly,
features whose values are boolean ∈ B. These are
bag of words, presence of exclamation marks and
capitalized text. Each of these broad categories is
divided into two subcategories: Polar features and
Non-polar features. We refer to a feature as polar
if we calculate its prior polarity either by looking
it up in DAL (extended through WordNet) or in the
emoticon dictionary. All other features which are
not associated with any prior polarity fall in the Non-
polar category. Each of Polar and Non-polar features
is further subdivided into two categories: POS and
Other. POS refers to features that capture statistics
about parts-of-speech of words and Other refers to
all other types of features.

In reference to Table 4, row f1 belongs to the cat-
egory Polar POS and refers to the count of number
of positive and negative parts-of-speech (POS) in a
tweet, rows f2, f3, f4 belongs to the category Po-

34



lar Other and refers to count of number of negation
words, count of words that have positive and neg-
ative prior polarity, count of emoticons per polarity
type, count of hashtags, capitalized words and words
with exclamation marks associated with words that
have prior polarity, row f5 belongs to the category
Non-Polar POS and refers to counts of different
parts-of-speech tags, rows f6, f7 belong to the cat-
egory Non-Polar Other and refer to count of num-
ber of slangs, latin alphabets, and other words with-
out polarity. It also relates to special terms such as
the number of hashtags, URLs, targets and newlines.
Row f8 belongs to the category Polar POS and cap-
tures the summation of prior polarity scores of words
with POS of JJ, RB, VB and NN. Similarly, row f9
belongs to the category Polar Other and calculates
the summation of prior polarity scores of all words,
row f10 refers to the category Non-Polar Other and
calculates the percentage of tweet that is capitalized.

Finally, row f11 belongs to the category Non-
Polar Other and refers to presence of exclamation
and presence of capitalized words as features.

8 Experiments and Results

In this section, we present experiments and results
for two classification tasks: 1) Positive versus Nega-
tive and 2) Positive versus Negative versus Neutral.
For each of the classification tasks we present three
models, as well as results for two combinations of
these models:

1. Unigram model (our baseline)

2. Tree kernel model

3. 100 Senti-features model

4. Kernel plus Senti-features

5. Unigram plus Senti-features

For the unigram plus Senti-features model, we
present feature analysis to gain insight about what
kinds of features are adding most value to the model.
We also present learning curves for each of the mod-
els and compare learning abilities of models when
provided limited data.

Experimental-Set-up: For all our experiments we
use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and report av-
eraged 5-fold cross-validation test results. We tune

the C parameter for SVM using an embedded 5-fold
cross-validation on the training data of each fold,
i.e. for each fold, we first run 5-fold cross-validation
only on the training data of that fold for different
values of C. We pick the setting that yields the best
cross-validation error and use that C for determin-
ing test error for that fold. As usual, the reported
accuracies is the average over the five folds.

8.1 Positive versus Negative

This is a binary classification task with two classes
of sentiment polarity: positive and negative. We use
a balanced data-set of 1709 instances for each class
and therefore the chance baseline is 50%.

8.1.1 Comparison of models
We use a unigram model as our baseline. Re-

searchers report state-of-the-art performance for
sentiment analysis on Twitter data using a unigram
model (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010).
Table 5 compares the performance of three models:
unigram model, feature based model using only 100
Senti-features, and the tree kernel model. We report
mean and standard deviation of 5-fold test accuracy.
We observe that the tree kernels outperform the uni-
gram and the Senti-features by 2.58% and 2.66% re-
spectively. The 100 Senti-features described in Ta-
ble 4 performs as well as the unigram model that
uses about 10,000 features. We also experiment with
combination of models. Combining unigrams with
Senti-features outperforms the combination of ker-
nels with Senti-features by 0.78%. This is our best
performing system for the positive versus negative
task, gaining about 4.04% absolute gain over a hard
unigram baseline.

8.1.2 Feature Analysis
Table 6 presents classifier accuracy and F1-

measure when features are added incrementally. We
start with our baseline unigram model and subse-
quently add various sets of features. First, we add
all non-polar features (rows f5, f6, f7, f10, f11 in Ta-
ble 4) and observe no improvement in the perfor-
mance. Next, we add all part-of-speech based fea-
tures (rows f1, f8) and observe a gain of 3.49% over
the unigram baseline. We see an additional increase
in accuracy by 0.55% when we add other prior po-
larity features (rows f2, f3, f4, f9 in Table 4). From

Table 4: N refers to set of features whose value is a positive integer. They are primarily count features; for example,
count of number of positive adverbs, negative verbs etc. R refers to features whose value is a real number; for example,
sum of the prior polarity scores of words with part-of-speech of adjective/adverb/verb/noun, and sum of prior polarity
scores of all words. B refers to the set of features that have a boolean value; for example, presence of exclamation
marks, presence of capitalized text.

Table 5: Average and standard deviation for test accuracy
for the 2-way classification task using different models:
Unigram (baseline), tree kernel, Senti-features, unigram
plus Senti-features, and tree kernel plus senti-features.

these experiments we conclude that the most impor-
tant features in Senti-features are those that involve
prior polarity of parts-of-speech. All other features
play a marginal role in achieving the best performing
system. In fact, we experimented by using unigrams
with only prior polarity POS features and achieved a
performance of 75.1%, which is only slightly lower
than using all Senti-features.

In terms of unigram features, we use Information
Gain as the attribute evaluation metric to do feature
selection. In Table 7 we present a list of unigrams
that consistently appear as top 15 unigram features
across all folds. Words having positive or negative
prior polarity top the list. Emoticons also appear as
important unigrams. Surprisingly though, the word
for appeared as a top feature. A preliminary analy-

sis revealed that the word for appears as frequently
in positive tweets as it does in negative tweets. How-
ever, tweets containing phrases like for you and for
me tend to be positive even in the absence of any
other explicit prior polarity words. Owing to previ-
ous research, the URL appearing as a top feature is
less surprising because Go et al. (2009) report that
tweets containing URLs tend to be positive.

ited data is used the advantages in the performance
of our best performing systems is even more pro-
nounced. This implies that with limited amount of
training data, simply using unigrams has a critical
disadvantage, while both tree kernel and unigram
model with our features exhibit promising perfor-
mance.

8.2 Positive versus Negative versus Neutral
This is a 3-way classification task with classes
of sentiment polarity: positive, negative and neu-
tral. We use a balanced data-set of 1709 instances
for each class and therefore the chance baseline is
33.33%.

8.2.1 Comparison of models
For this task the unigram model achieves a gain

of 23.25% over chance baseline. Table 8 compares
the performance of our three models. We report
mean and standard deviation of 5-fold test accuracy.
We observe that the tree kernels outperform the un-
igram and the Senti-features model by 4.02% and
4.29% absolute, respectively. We note that this dif-
ference is much more pronounced comparing to the
two way classification task. Once again, our 100
Senti-features perform almost as well as the unigram
baseline which has about 13,000 features. We also
experiment with the combination of models. For
this classification task the combination of tree ker-
nel with Senti-features outperforms the combination
of unigrams with Senti-features by a small margin.

Table 8: Average and standard deviation for test accuracy
for the 3-way classification task using different models:
Unigram (baseline), tree kernel, Senti-features, unigram
plus Senti-features, and Senti-features plus tree kernels.

This is our best performing system for the 3-way
classification task, gaining 4.25% over the unigram
baseline.

The learning curve for the 3-way classification
task is similar to the curve of the 2-way classifica-
tion task, and we omit it.

8.2.2 Feature Analysis
Table 9 presents classifier accuracy and F1-

measure when features are added incrementally. We
start with our baseline unigram model and subse-
quently add various sets of features. First, we add all
non-polar features (rows f5, f6, f7, f10 in Table 4)
and observe an small improvement in the perfor-
mance. Next, we add all part-of-speech based fea-
tures and observe a gain of 3.28% over the unigram
baseline. We see an additional increase in accuracy
by 0.64% when we add other prior polarity features
(rows f2, f3, f4, f9 in Table 4). These results are in
line with our observations for the 2-way classifica-
tion task. Once again, the main contribution comes
from features that involve prior polarity of parts-of-
speech.

classification task are mostly similar to that of the
2-way classification task, except several terms with
neutral polarity appear to be discriminative features,
such as to, have, and so.

9 Conclusion

We presented results for sentiment analysis on Twit-
ter. We use previously proposed state-of-the-art un-
igram model as our baseline and report an overall
gain of over 4% for two classification tasks: a binary,
positive versus negative and a 3-way positive versus
negative versus neutral. We presented a comprehen-
sive set of experiments for both these tasks on manu-
ally annotated data that is a random sample of stream
of tweets. We investigated two kinds of models:
tree kernel and feature based models and demon-
strate that both these models outperform the unigram
baseline. For our feature-based approach, we do fea-
ture analysis which reveals that the most important
features are those that combine the prior polarity of
words and their parts-of-speech tags. We tentatively
conclude that sentiment analysis for Twitter data is
not that different from sentiment analysis for other
genres.

In future work, we will explore even richer lin-
guistic analysis, for example, parsing, semantic
analysis and topic modeling.
