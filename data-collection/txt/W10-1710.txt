Abstract
FBK participated in the WMT 2010
Machine Translation shared task with
phrase-based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion systems based on the Moses decoder
for English-German and German-English
translation. Our work concentrates on ex-
ploiting the available language modelling
resources by using linear mixtures of large
6-gram language models and on address-
ing linguistic differences between English
and German with methods based on word
lattices. In particular, we use lattices to in-
tegrate a morphological analyser for Ger-
man into our system, and we present some
initial work on rule-based word reorder-
ing.

1 System overview

The Human Language Technologies group at Fon-
dazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) participated in the
WMT 2010 Machine Translation (MT) evaluation
with systems for English-German and German-
English translation. While the English-German
system we submitted was relatively simple, we
put some more effort into the inverse translation
direction to make better use of the abundance
of language modelling data available for English
and to address the richness of German morphol-
ogy, which makes it hard for a Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) system to achieve good vocab-
ulary coverage. In the remainder of this section,
an overview of the common features of our sys-
tems will be given. The next two sections provide
a more detailed description of our approaches to
language modelling, morphological preprocessing
and word reordering.

Both of our systems were based on the Moses
decoder (Koehn et al., 2007). They were simi-
lar to the WMT 2010 Moses baseline system. In-
stead of lowercasing the training data and adding

a recasing step, we retained the data in document
case throughout our system, except for the mor-
phologically normalised word forms described in
section 3. Our phrase tables were trained with the
standard Moses training script, then filtered based
on statistical significance according to the method
described by Johnson et al. (2007). Finally, we
used Minimum Bayes Risk decoding (Kumar and
Byrne, 2004) based on the BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002).

2 Language modelling

At the 2009 NIST MT evaluation, our system ob-
tained good results using a mixture of linearly in-
terpolated language models (LMs) combining data
from different sources. As the training data pro-
vided for the present evaluation campaign again
included a large set of language modelling corpora
from different sources, especially for English as
a target language, we decided to adopt the same
strategy. The partial corpora for English and their
sizes can be found in table 1. Our base mod-
els of the English Gigaword texts were trained
on version 3 of the corpus (LDC2007T07). We
trained separate language models for the new data
from the years 2007 and 2008 included in ver-
sion 4 (LDC2009T13). Apart from the mono-
lingual English data, we also included language
models trained on the English part of the addi-
tional parallel datasets supplied for the French-
English and Czech-English tasks. All the mod-
els were estimated as 6-gram models with Kneser-
Ney smoothing using the IRSTLM language mod-
elling toolkit (Federico et al., 2008).

For technical reasons, we were unable to use all
the language models during decoding. We there-
fore selected a subset of the models with the fol-
lowing data selection procedure:

24 language models, we estimated a set of

2. By sorting the mixture coefficients in de-
scending order, we obtained an ordering of
the language models by their importance with
respect to the development set. We created
partial mixtures by selecting the top n mod-
els according to this order and retraining the
mixture weights with the same algorithm.

Computing the perplexities of these partial
mixtures on the news-test2008 (DEV) and
newstest2009 (EVAL) corpora shows that signif-
icant improvements can be obtained up to a mix-
tures size of about 15 elements. As this size still
turned out to be too large to be managed by our
systems, we used a 5-element mixture in our final
submission (see table 3 for details about the mix-
ture and table 4 for the evaluation results of the
submitted systems).

For the English-German system, the only cor-
pora available for the target language were Eu-
roparl v5, News commentary v10 and the mono-
lingual News corpus. Similar experiments showed
that the News corpus was by far the most impor-
tant for the text genre to be translated and that

We therefore decided not to use Europarl or News
commentary for language modelling in our pri-
mary submission. However, we submitted a sec-
ondary system using a mixture of language models
based on all three corpora.

3 Morphological reduction and
decompounding of German

Compounding is a highly productive part of Ger-
man noun morphology. Unlike in English, Ger-
man compound nouns are usually spelt as sin-
gle words, which greatly increases the vocabulary.
For a Machine Translation system, this property
of the language causes a high number of out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words. It is likely that many
compounds in an input text have not been seen in
the training corpus. We addressed this problem by
splitting compounds in the German source text.

Compound splitting was done using the Gert-
wol morphological analyser (Koskenniemi and
Haapalainen, 1996), a linguistically informed sys-
tem based on two-level finite state morphology.
Since Gertwol outputs all possible analyses of a
word form without taking into account the context,
the output has to be disambiguated. For this pur-
pose, we used part-of-speech (POS) tags obtained
from the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) along with
a set of POS-based heuristic disambiguation rules

provided to us by the Institute of Computational
Linguistics of the University of Zurich.

As a side effect, Gertwol outputs the base forms
of all words that it processes: Nominative singu-
lar of nouns, infinitive of verbs etc. We decided to
combine the tokens analysed by Gertwol, whether
or not they had been decompounded and lower-
cased, in a further attempt to reduce data sparse-
ness, with their original form in a word lattice
(see fig. 1) and to let the decoder make the choice
between the two according to the translations the
phrase table can provide for each.

Our word lattices are similar to those used by
Dyer et al. (2008) for handling word segmentation
in Chinese and Arabic. For each word that was
segmented by Gertwol, we provide exactly one al-
ternative edge labelled with the component words
and base forms as identified by Gertwol, after re-
moving linking morphemes. The edge transition
probabilities are used to identify the source of an
edge: their values are e−1 = 0.36788 for edges de-
riving from Gertwol analysis and e0 = 1 for edges
carrying unprocessed words. Tokens whose de-
compounded base form according to Gertwol is
identical to the surface form in the input are rep-
resented by a single edge with transition proba-
bility e−0.5 = 0.606531. These transition proba-
bilities translate into a binary feature with values
−1, −0.5 and 0 after taking logarithms in the de-
coder. The feature weight is determined by Min-
imum Error-Rate Training (Och, 2003), together
with the weights of the other feature functions
used in the decoder. During system training, the
processed version of the training corpus was con-
catenated with the unprocessed text.

Experiments show that decompounding and
morphological analysis have a significant impact
on the performance of the MT system. After
these steps, the OOV rate of the newstest2009
test set decreases from 5.88 % to 3.21 %. Us-
ing only the News language model, the BLEU
score of our development system (measured on
the newstest2009 corpus) increases from 18.77
to 19.31. There is an interesting interaction with
the language models. While using a linear mixture
of 15 language models instead of just the News
LM does not improve the performance of the base-
line system (BLEU score 18.78 instead of 18.77),
the BLEU score of the 15-LM system increases to
20.08 when adding morphological reduction. In
the baseline system, the additional language mod-

els did not have a noticeable effect on translation
quality; however, their impact was realised in the
decompounding system.

4 Word reordering

Current SMT systems are based on the assump-
tion that the word order of the source and the tar-
get languages are fundamentally similar. While
the models permit some local reordering, system-
atic differences in word order involving move-
ments of more than a few words pose major prob-
lems. In particular, Statistical Machine Transla-
tion between German and English is notoriously
impacted by the different fundamental word order
in subordinate clauses, where German Subject–
Object–Verb (SOV) order contrasts with English
Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) order.

In our English-German system, we made the
observation that the verb in an SVO subordi-
nate clause following a punctuation mark fre-
quently gets moved before the preceding punctu-
ation. This movement is triggered by the Ger-
man language model, which prefers verbs pre-
ceding punctuation as consistent with SOV or-
der, and it is facilitated by the fact that the dis-
tance from the verb to the end of the preceding
clause is often smaller than the distance to the end
of the current phrase, so moving the verb back-
wards results in a better score from the distance-
based reordering model. This tendency can be
counteracted effectively by enabling the Moses
decoder’s monotone-at-punctuation feature,
which makes sure that words are not reordered
across punctuation marks. The result is a mod-
est gain from 14.28 to 14.38 BLEU points
(newstest2009).

In the German-English system, we applied a
chunk-based technique to produce lattices repre-
senting multiple permutations of the test sentences
in order to enable long-range reorderings of verb
phrases. This approach is similar to the reorder-
ing technique based on part-of-speech tags pre-
sented by Niehues and Kolss (2009), which re-
sults in the addition of a large number of reorder-
ing paths to the lattices. By contrast, we assume
that verb reorderings only occur between shallow
syntax chunks, and not within them. This makes it
possible to limit the number of long-range reorder-
ing options in an effective way.

We used the TreeTagger to perform shallow
syntax chunking of the German text. By man-

ual inspection of a data sample, we then identi-
fied a few recurrent patterns of long reorderings
involving the verbs. In particular, we focused on
clause-final verbs in German SOV clauses, which
we move to the left in order to approximate the En-
glish SVO word order. For each sentence a chunk-
based lattice is created, which is then expanded
into a word lattice like the one shown in fig. 2. The
lattice representation provides the decoder with up
to three possible reorderings for a particular verb
chunk. It always retains the original word order as
an alternative input.

For technical reasons, we were unable to pre-
pare a system with reordering, morphological re-
duction and all language models in time for the
shared task. Our secondary submission with re-
ordering is therefore not comparable with our best
system, which includes more language models
and morphological reduction. In subsequent ex-
periments, we combined morphological reduction
with chunk-based reordering (table 5). When mor-
phological reduction is used, the reordering ap-
proach yields an improvement of about 0.5 BLEU
percentage points.

5 Conclusions

There are three important features specific to the
FBK systems at WMT 2010: mixtures of large
language models, German morphological reduc-
tion and decompounding and word reordering.
Our approach to using large language models
proved successful at the 2009 NIST MT evalua-
tion. In the present evaluation, its effectiveness
was reduced by a number of technical problems,
which were mostly due to the limitations of disk
access throughput in our parallel computing en-
vironment. We are working on methods to re-
duce and distribute disk accesses to large lan-
guage models, which will be implemented in the
IRSTLM language modelling toolkit (Federico et
al., 2008). By doing so, we hope to overcome the
current limitations and exploit the power of lan-
guage model mixtures more fully.

The Gertwol-based morphological reduction
and decompounding component we used is a
working solution that results in a significant im-
provement in translation quality. It is an alterna-
tive to the popular statistical compound splitting
methods, such as the one by Koehn and Knight
(2003), incorporating a greater amount of linguis-
tic knowledge and offering morphological reduc-
tion even of simplex words to their base form in
addition. It would be interesting to compare the
relative performance of the two approaches sys-
tematically.

Word reordering between German and English
is a complex problem. Encouraged by the success
of chunk-based verb reordering lattices on Arabic-
English (Bisazza and Federico, 2010), we tried to
adapt the same approach to the German-English
language pair. It turned out that there is a larger
variety of long reordering patterns in this case.
Nevertheless, some experiments performed after

91



the official evaluation showed promising results.
We plan to pursue this work in several directions:
Defining a lattice weighting scheme that distin-
guishes between original word order and reorder-
ing paths could help the decoder select the more
promising path through the lattice. Applying sim-
ilar reordering rules to the training corpus would
reduce the mismatch between the training data and
the reordered input sentences. Finally, it would be
useful to explore the impact of different distortion
limits on the decoding of reordering lattices in or-
der to find an optimal trade-off between decoder-
driven short-range and lattice-driven long-range
reordering.
