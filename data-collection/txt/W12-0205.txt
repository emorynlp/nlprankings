Abstract

This paper presents a novel way of vi-
sualising relationships between languages.
The key feature of the visualisation is that
it brings geographic, phylogenetic, and
linguistic data together into a single im-
age, allowing a new visual perspective on
linguistic typology. The data presented
here is extracted from the World Atlas of
Language Structures (WALS) (Dryer and
Haspelmath, 2011). After pruning due to
low coverage of WALS, we filter the typo-
logical data by geographical proximity in
order to ascertain areal typological effects.
The data are displayed in heat maps which
reflect the strength of similarity between
languages for different linguistic features.
Finally, the heat maps are annotated for lan-
guage family membership. The images so
produced allow a multi-faceted perspective
on the data which we hope will facilitate the
interpretation of results and perhaps illumi-
nate new areas of research in linguistic ty-
pology.

1 Introduction

This paper presents a novel way of visualising re-
lationships between languages. Relationships be-
tween languages can be understood with respect
to linguistic features of the languages, their geo-
graphical proximity, and their status with respect
to historical development. The visualisations pre-
sented in this paper are part of a new attempt to
bring together these three perspectives into a sin-
gle image. One line of recent work brings com-
putational methods to bear on the formation and
use of large typological databases, often using so-
phisticated statistical techniques to discover rela-
tions between languages (Cysouw, 2011; Daumé

III and Campbell, 2007; Daumé III, 2009, among
others), and another line of work uses typolog-
ical data in natural language processing (Georgi
et al., 2010; Lewis and Xia, 2008, for example).
The task of visually presenting the resulting data
in this way has been only infrequently addressed.
We are aware of some similar work (Mayer et al.,
2010; Rohrdantz et al., 2010) in visualising dif-
ferences in linguistic typology, phylogeny (Mul-
titree, 2009), and geographical variation (Wiel-
ing et al., 2011). Here, we present our method
for addressing the visualisation gap, bringing to-
gether phylogeny, typology, and geography by us-
ing data from the World Atlas of Language Struc-
tures (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011) to develop
heat maps that can visually show the intercon-
nected relationships between languages and lan-
guage families.

The main envisioned application of our visual-
isations is in the area of linguistic typology. Ty-
pology has been used to derive implications about
possible languages, and about the ordering of the
human mind. Different theorists have taken dif-
ferent views on the relationship between typology
and the universality of languages. For example,
Greenberg (1963), a foundational work, identified
a number of cross-linguistic typological proper-
ties and implications and aimed to present them
as truly universal – relevant for all languages. In a
similar vein, typological universals have been em-
ployed as evidence in a generative story regarding
language learning (Chomsky, 2000).

Taking a different perspective, Dunn et al.
(2011) argued that a language’s typology relies
upon the previous generations’ language more
than on any biological, environmental or cogni-
tive constraints, and that there are pathways which

30



are generally followed in language change based
on the previous parent language. What these argu-
ments have in common is a reliance on a view of
linguistic typology that is potentially restricted in
its scope, due to insufficient access to broad-scale
empirical data, covering many features of many
languages of the world.

The most comprehensive computational re-
source for linguistic typology currently avail-
able is the World Atlas of Language Structures
(WALS).1 WALS is a large database of details
of structural properties of several thousand lan-
guages (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011). The prop-
erties were collected from descriptive sources by
the project’s 55 authors.

However, of the 2,678 languages and 192 fea-
tures in WALS, only 16% of the possible data
points are actually specified—the data are sparse,
and the sparsity of the data naturally makes it dif-
ficult to perform reliable statistical analysis. One
way to work around this limitation is to seek
meaningful visualisations of the data in WALS,
instead of simply relying on raw numbers. This is
our approach.

In this paper, we first discuss in more detail
the source data and the types of information ex-
tracted, followed by a discussion of some diffi-
culties presented by the available data and our
approaches for addressing those difficulties. Fi-
nally, we present a sample of the resulting visual-
isations.

2 Aspects of the Visualisations

The visualisations described here bring together
three types of information: linguistic features, ge-
ographical distance, and phylogenetic distance.
For the current study, all three types of informa-
tion are extracted from the WALS database. In
future work, we would explore alternate sources
such as Ethnologue (Lewis, 2009) or MultiTree
(2009) for alternate phylogenetic hierarchies.

2.1 Linguistic features

At the time of writing, WALS contains infor-
mation for 2,678 languages. The linguistic fea-
tures covered in WALS range from phonetic and
phonological features, over some lexical and mor-
phological features, to syntactic structures, word

1As of 2008, WALS is browsable online (http://
www.wals.info).

order tendencies, and other structural phenomena.
A total of 192 features are represented, grouped
in 144 different chapters, with each chapter ad-
dressing a set of related features. Ignoring the fact
that a language having certain features will can-
cel out the possibility (or diminish the probabil-
ity) of others, only 15.8% of WALS is described
fully. In other words, if we consider WALS to be
a 2,678x192 grid, fewer than 16% of the grid’s
squares contain feature values.

The coverage of features/chapters varies dra-
matically across languages, with an average of 28
feature values per language. The most populated
feature has data for 1,519 languages. Because of
the extreme sparsity of the data, we restricted our
treatment to only languages with values for 30%
or more of the available features—372 languages,
with a total of 36k feature values.

2.2 Phylogenetic distance

Languages are related phylogenetically either ver-
tically, by lineage, or horizontally, by contact.
In WALS, each language is placed in a tree hi-
erarchy that specifies phylogenetic relations. In
the WALS data files, this is specified by linking
at three different levels: family, such as ‘Sino-
Tibetan’, sub-family, such as ‘Tibeto-Burman’,
and genus, such as ‘Northern Naga’. The WALS
phylogenetic hierarchies do not take into account
language contact. For that, we used geographic
coordinates, which are present in WALS, as a
proxy for contact.

2.3 Geographic distance

Geographic distance is an important aspect of ty-
pological study because neighbouring languages
often come to share linguistic features, even in
the absence of genetic relationship between the
languages. Each language in WALS is associ-
ated with a geographical coordinate representing
a central point for the main population of speakers
of that language. We use these data to determine
geographic distance between any two languages,
using the haversine formula for orthodromic dis-
tance.2 A crucial aspect of our visualisations
is that we produce them only for sets of lan-
guages within a reasonable geographic proximity

2This measure is inexact, especially over long distances,
due to the imperfect topography and non-spherical shape of
the earth, but it is computationally simple and is accurate
enough for our present purposes.

31



and with sufficient feature coverage in WALS.
For this study, we used two approaches to

clustering languages according to geographic dis-
tance. First, we chose an arbitrary radius in or-
der to create a decision boundary for clustering
neighbouring languages. For each language, that
language’s location is fixed as the centroid of the
cluster and every language within the given radius
is examined. We found that a radius of 500 kilo-
metres provides a sufficient number of examples
even after cleaning low-coverage languages from
the WALS data.

The second approach selected an arbitrary
lower bound for the number of languages in the
geographic area under consideration. If a suffi-
cient percentage (enough to graph) of the total
number of languages in the area remained after
cleaning the WALS data, we took this as a useful
area and did mapping for that area. This num-
ber is clearly under-representative of the amount
of contact languages, as only half of the world’s
languages are present in WALS with any degree
of coverage. This proxy was not as good as the
radius method at choosing specific, useful exam-
ples for the n-nearest neighbours, as the languages
chosen were often quite distant from one another.

3 Heat Map Visualisations

We focused on producing visualisations only for
features that are salient for the maximal number
of selected languages. We choose two heat maps
for display here, from the least sparse data avail-
able, to demonstrate the output of the visualisa-
tion method. The remaining visualisations, along
with all code used to produce the visualisations,
are available in a public repository.3

All data was downloaded freely from WALS,
all coding was done in either Python or R. The
code was not computationally expensive to run,
and the programming languages and methods are
quite accessible.

In a two-dimensional heat map, each cell of
a matrix is filled with a colour representing that
cell’s value. In our case, the colour of the cell rep-
resents the normalised value of a linguistic feature
according to WALS. Languages with the same
colour in a given row have the same value for

that typological feature.4 Below we discuss two
types of heat maps, focusing first on geographic
and then on phylogenetic features.

3.1 Geographically-focused heat maps

For the geographic distance maps, for each lan-
guage present in the cleaned data, we identified
all possible languages that lay within 500km, and
sorted these languages until only the 16 closest
neighbours were selected. Once the set of lan-
guages was determined, we selected for graph-
ing only the most commonly-occurring features
across that set of languages.

To present the visualisation, we first centred
the source language in the map. This decision
was made in order to reduce the effect of one of
the primary issues with using distance on a two
dimensional graph; distance between two non-
source languages is not shown, meaning that one
could be to the north and another to the south.
This means that the languages on the extremes of
the map may be far apart from each other, and
should be viewed with caution.

Figure 1 shows a geographically-focused heat
map with values for various morphological and
word order features. The map is centred on Yi-
mas, a language spoken in New Guinea. The
features presented represent a particularly non-

ing the heat maps presented here in colour.

sparse section of WALS for this language area.
A number of insights can be gleaned here. Most
prominently, these languages are quite homoge-
nous with respect to the selected features. Given
that most of the languages do indeed belong to the
same language family (cf. top bar of the graph),
this is unlikely to be a chance effect. In the 5th
row (‘O&V Ordering and the Adj&N Ordering’),
we see via the cluster of red cells a partial group-
ing of languages close to Yimas, with less sim-
ilarity at a greater distance. The nearly alter-
nating pattern we see for ‘Position of Negative
Word With Respect to S,O,&V’ may suggest areal
groups that have been split by the data-centring
function. Also, the checkerboard pattern for this
feature and the one below (‘Postverbal Negative
Morphemes’) suggests a possible negative corre-
lation between these two linguistic features.

3.2 Phylogenetically-focused heat maps
To produce phylogenetically-focused visualisa-
tions, for each language we identified other lan-
guages coming from the same family, subfam-
ily, or genus. Figure 2 shows a phylogenetically-
focused heat map for Niger-Congo languages, ar-
ranged from west to east. A number of the west-
ern languages show red cells for features related
to relative clauses; these can be compared to
mostly blue cells in the eastern languages. We
also see some apparent groupings for variable
word order in negative clauses (red cells in west-
ern languages) and for NegSVO Order (purple
cells in western languages). For some pairs of
adjacent languages (most notably Bambara and
Supyire), we see clusters of shared features. Es-
pecially give the importance of Bambara for syn-
tactic argumentation (Culy, 1985), this graph is an
excellent example of visualisation pointing out an
intriguing area for closer analysis.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we present a new approach to visual-
ising relationships between languages, one which
allows for the simultaneous viewing of linguistic
features together with phylogenetic relationships
and geographical location and proximity. These
visualisations allow us to view language relation-
ships in a multi-faceted way, seeking to work
around the sparseness of available data and facili-
tate new insights into linguistic typology.

both feature coverage and selection of salient fea-
tures for representation, reducing the number of
graphs produced to 6 with geographic focus and
8 with phylogenetic focus. One topic for future
work is to explore other ways of working with
and expanding the available data in order to ac-
cess even more useful visualisations. In addition,
it would be very interesting to apply this visuali-
sation method to data from other sources, for ex-
ample, data from multiple related dialects. In such
cases, coverage is likely to be better, and the lan-
guages in question will have been selected already
for their relatedness, thus avoiding some of the
data-filtering issues that arise. Finally, we would
like to investigate more principled approaches to
selection, presentation, and ordering of linguistic
features in the heat maps.
