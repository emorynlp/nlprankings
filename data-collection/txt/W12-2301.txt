Abstract

Most tools and resources developed for nat-
ural language processing of Arabic are de-
signed for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
and perform terribly on Arabic dialects, such
as Egyptian Arabic. Egyptian Arabic differs
from MSA phonologically, morphologically
and lexically and has no standardized orthog-
raphy. We present a linguistically accurate,
large-scale morphological analyzer for Egyp-
tian Arabic. The analyzer extends an existing
resource, the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lex-
icon, and follows the part-of-speech guide-
lines used by the Linguistic Data Consortium
for Egyptian Arabic. It accepts multiple or-
thographic variants and normalizes them to a
conventional orthography.

1 Introduction

Dialectal Arabic (DA) refers to the day-to-day na-
tive vernaculars spoken in the Arab World. DA
is used side by side with Modern Standard Ara-
bic (MSA), the official language of the media and
education (Holes, 2004). Although DAs are his-
torically related to MSA, there are many phono-
logical, morphological and lexical differences be-
tween them. Unlike MSA, DAs have no stan-
dard orthographies or language academies. Fur-
thermore, different DAs, such as Egyptian Arabic
(henceforth, EGY), Levantine Arabic or Moroccan
Arabic have important differences among them sim-
ilar to those seen among Romance languages (Er-
win, 1963; Cowell, 1964; Abdel-Massih et al., 1979;
Holes, 2004). Most tools and resources developed
for natural language processing (NLP) of Arabic are
designed for MSA. Such resources are quite limited

when it comes to processing DA, e.g., a state-of-the-
art MSA morphological analyzer has been reported
to only have 60% coverage of Levantine Arabic verb
forms (Habash and Rambow, 2006). Most efforts to
address this gap have been lacking. Some have taken
a quick-and-dirty approach to model shallow mor-
phology in DA by extending MSA tools, resulting
in linguistically inaccurate models (Abo Bakr et al.,
2008; Salloum and Habash, 2011). Others have at-
tempted to build linguistically accurate models that
are lacking in coverage (at the lexical or inflectional
levels) or focusing on representations that are not
readily usable for NLP text processing, e.g., phono-
logical lexicons (Kilany et al., 2002).

In this paper we present the Columbia Ara-
bic Language and dIalect Morphological Analyzer
(CALIMA) for EGY.1 We built this tool by ex-
tending an existing resource for EGY, the Egyptian
Colloquial Arabic Lexicon (ECAL) (Kilany et al.,
2002). CALIMA is a linguistically accurate, large-
scale morphological analyzer. It follows the part-of-
speech (POS) guidelines used by the Linguistic Data
Consortium for EGY (Maamouri et al., 2012b). It
accepts multiple orthographic variants and normal-
izes them to CODA, a conventional orthography for
DA (Habash et al., 2012).

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tion 2 presents relevant motivating linguistic facts.
Section 3 discusses related work. Section 4 details
the steps taken to create CALIMA starting with
ECAL. Section 5 presents a preliminary evaluation
and statistics about the coverage of CALIMA. Fi-
nally, Section 6 outlines future plans and directions.

1Although we focus on Egyptian Arabic in this paper, the
CALIMA name will be used in the future to cover a variety of
dialects.

2 Motivating Linguistic Facts

We present some general Arabic (MSA/DA) NLP
challenges. Then we discuss differences between
MSA and DA – specifically EGY.

2.1 General Arabic Linguistic Challenges

Arabic, as MSA or DA, poses many challenges
for NLP. Arabic is a morphologically complex lan-
guage which includes rich inflectional morphology,
expressed both templatically and affixationally, and
several classes of attachable clitics. For example, the
MSA word Aî 	EñJ.

�
JºJ
ð wa+sa+ya-ktub-uwna+hA

2

‘and they will write it’ has two proclitics (+ð wa+
‘and’ and + sa+ ‘will’), one prefix -ø



ya- ‘3rd

person’, one suffix 	àð- -uwna ‘masculine plural’
and one pronominal enclitic Aë+ +hA ‘it/her’. The
stem ktub can be further analyzed into the root ktb
and pattern 12u3.

Additionally, Arabic is written with optional dia-
critics that primarily specify short vowels and con-
sonantal doubling, e.g., the example above will most
certainly be written as wsyktbwnhA. The absence of
these diacritics together with the language’s com-
plex morphology lead to a high degree of ambiguity,
e.g., the Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer
(SAMA) (Graff et al., 2009) produces an average of
12 analyses per MSA word.

Moreover, some letters in Arabic are often spelled
inconsistently which leads to an increase in both
sparsity (multiple forms of the same word) and
ambiguity (same form corresponding to multiple
words), e.g., variants of the Hamzated Alif,


@ Â or

@

Ǎ, are often written without their Hamza (Z ’): @ A.

and the Alif-Maqsura (or dot-less Ya) ø ý and the
regular dotted Ya ø



y are often used interchangeably

in the word-final position (Buckwalter, 2007).
Arabic complex morphology and ambiguity are

handled using tools for disambiguation and tok-
enization (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Diab et al.,
2007).

2Arabic orthographic transliteration is presented in the HSB
scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (in alphabetical order)
@ H.

�
H

�
H h. h p X

	
XP 	P 

 

�
 ¼ È Ð

A b t θ j H x d ð r z s š S D T Ď ς γ f q k l m n h w y

and the additional letters: ’ Z, Â

@, Ǎ @


, Ā

�
@, ŵ ð', ŷ Zø', ~ �è, ý ø.

We distinguish between morphological analysis,
whose target is to produce all possible morphologi-
cal/POS readings of a word out of context, and mor-
phological disambiguation, which attempts to tag
the word in context (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
The work presented in this paper is only about mor-
phological analysis.

2.2 Differences between MSA and DA

Contemporary Arabic is in fact a collection of vari-
eties: MSA, which has a standard orthography and
is used in formal settings, and DAs, which are com-
monly used informally and with increasing presence
on the web, but which do not have standard or-
thographies. DAs mostly differ from MSA phono-
logically, morphologically, and lexically (Gadalla,
2000; Holes, 2004). These difference are not mod-
eled as part of MSA NLP tools, leaving a gap in
coverage when using them to process DAs. All ex-
amples below are in Egyptian Arabic (EGY).

Phonologically, the profile of EGY is quite simi-
lar to MSA, except for some important differences.
For example, the MSA consonants �/ 	X/ �H q/ð/θ
are generally pronounced in EGY (Cairene) as ’/z/s
(Holes, 2004). Some of these consonants shift in dif-
ferent ways in different words: e.g., MSA I.

	
K

	
X ðanb

‘fault’ and H.
	
Y» kiðb ‘lying’ are pronounced zanb

and kidb. EGY has five long vowels compared with
MSA’s three long vowels. Unlike MSA, long vow-
els in EGY predictably shorten under certain condi-
tions, often as a result of cliticization. For example,
compare the following forms of the same verb:

	
¬A

�


šAf /šāf/ ‘he saw’ and Aê 	¯A � šAf+hA /šafha/ ‘he saw
her’ (Habash et al., 2012).

Morphologically, the most important difference
is in the use of clitics and affixes that do not ex-
ist in MSA. For instance, the EGY equivalent of
the MSA example above is AëñJ.

�
JºJ
kð wi+Ha+yi-

ktib-uw+hA ‘and they will write it’. The optionality
of vocalic diacritics helps hide some of the differ-
ences resulting from vowel changes; compare the
undiacritized forms: EGY wHyktbwhA and MSA
wsyktbwnhA. In this example, the forms of the cli-
tics and affixes are different in EGY although they
have the same meaning; however, EGY has clitics
that are not part of MSA morphology, e.g., the in-
direct pronominal object clitic (+l+uh ‘for him’)

2



éËAëñJ.
�
JºJ
kð wi+Ha+yi-ktib-uw+hA+l+uh ‘and they

will write it for him’. Another important example is
the circumfix negation �+ + AÓ mA+ +š which sur-
rounds some verb forms: ��.

�
J» AÓ mA+katab+š ‘he

did not write’ (the MSA equivalent is two words:
I.

�
JºK
 ÕË lam yaktub). Another important morpho-

logical difference from MSA is that DAs in general
and not just EGY drop the case and mood features
almost completely.

Lexically, the number of differences is very
large. Examples include �. bas ‘only’,

�
è
	Q�
K. Q£

tarabayza~ ‘table’, �H@QÓ mirAt ‘wife [of]’ and ÈðX
dawl ‘these’, which correspond to MSA ¡�® 	¯ faqaT,
�
éËðA£ TAwila~, �ék. ð 	P zawja~ and ZB ñë haŵlA’, re-
spectively.

An important challenge for NLP work on DAs
in general is the lack of an orthographic standard.
EGY writers are often inconsistent even in their
own writing. The differences in phonology between
MSA and EGY are often responsible: words can
be spelled as pronounced or etymologically in their
related MSA form, e.g., H. Y» kidb or H.

	
Y» kiðb.

Some clitics have multiple common forms, e.g., the
future particle h Ha appears as a separate word or as

a proclitic +h/+ë Ha+/ha+, reflecting different pro-
nunciations. The different spellings may add some
confusion, e.g., ñJ.

�
J» ktbw may be @ñJ.

�
J» katabuwA

‘they wrote’ or éJ.
�
J» katabuh ‘he wrote it’. Finally,

shortened long vowels can be spelled long or short,
e.g., Aê 	¯A �/ Aê 	® � šAf+hA/šf+hA ‘he saw her’.

3 Related Work

3.1 Approaches to Arabic Morphology
There has been a considerable amount of work on
Arabic morphological analysis (Al-Sughaiyer and
Al-Kharashi, 2004; Habash, 2010). Altantawy et al.
(2011) characterize the various approaches explored
for Arabic and Semitic computational morphology
as being on a continuum with two poles: on one end,
very abstract and linguistically rich representations
and morphological rules are used to derive surface
forms; while on the other end, simple and shallow
techniques focus on efficient search in a space of
precompiled (tabulated) solutions. The first type is
typically implemented using finite-state technology
and can be at many different degrees of sophistica-

tion and detail (Beesley et al., 1989; Kiraz, 2000;
Habash and Rambow, 2006). The second type is typ-
ically implemented using hash-tables with a simple
search algorithm. Examples include the Buckwalter
Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buck-
walter, 2004), its Standard Arabic Morphological
Analyzer (SAMA) (Graff et al., 2009) incarnation,
and their generation-oriented extension, ALMOR
(Habash, 2007). These systems do not represent the
morphemic, phonological and orthographic rules di-
rectly, and instead compile their effect into the lexi-
con itself, which consists of three tables for prefixes,
stems and suffixes and their compatibilities. A pre-
fix or suffix in this approach is a string consisting of
all the word’s prefixes and suffixes, respectively, as
a single unit (including null affix sequences). Dur-
ing analysis, all possible splits of a word into com-
patible prefix-stem-suffix combination are explored.
More details are discussed in Section 4.5. Numer-
ous intermediate points exist between these two ex-
tremes (e.g., ElixirFM (Smrž, 2007)). Altantawy et
al. (2011) describe a method for converting a lin-
guistically complex and abstract implementation of
Arabic verbs in finite-state machinery into a simple
precompiled tabular representation.

The approach we follow in this paper is closer
to the second type. We start with a lexicon of in-
flected forms and derive from it a tabular represen-
tation compatible with the SAMA system for MSA.
However, as we do this, we design the tables and ex-
tend them in ways that capture generalizations and
extend orthographic coverage.

3.2 Arabic Dialect Morphology

The majority of the work discussed above has fo-
cused on MSA, while only a few efforts have tar-
geted DA morphology (Kilany et al., 2002; Riesa
and Yarowsky, 2006; Habash and Rambow, 2006;
Abo Bakr et al., 2008; Salloum and Habash, 2011;
Mohamed et al., 2012). These efforts generally fall
in two camps. First are solutions that focus on ex-
tending MSA tools to cover DA phenomena. For
example, both Abo Bakr et al. (2008) and Salloum
and Habash (2011) extended the BAMA/SAMA
databases (Buckwalter, 2004; Graff et al., 2009) to
accept DA prefixes and suffixes. Both of these ef-
forts were interested in mapping DA text to some
MSA-like form; as such they did not model DA lin-

3



guistic phenomena, e.g., the ADAM system (Sal-
loum and Habash, 2011) outputs only MSA diacrit-
ics that are discarded in later processing.

The second camp is interested in modeling DA di-
rectly. However, the attempts at doing so are lacking
in coverage in one dimension or another. The earli-
est effort on EGY that we know of is the Egyptian
Colloquial Arabic Lexicon (ECAL) (Kilany et al.,
2002). It was developed as part of the CALLHOME
Egyptian Arabic (CHE) corpus (Gadalla et al., 1997)
which contains 140 telephone conversations and
their transcripts. The lexicon lists all of the words
appearing in the CHE corpus and provides phono-
logical, orthographic and morphological informa-
tion for them. This is an important resource; how-
ever, it is lacking in many ways: the orthographic
forms are undiacritized, no morpheme segmenta-
tions are provided, and the lexicon has only some
66K fully inflected forms and as such lacks general
morphological coverage. Another effort is the work
by Habash and Rambow (2006) which focuses on
modeling DAs together with MSA using a common
multi-tier finite-state-machine framework. Although
this approach has a lot of potential, in practice, it
is closer to the first camp in its results since they
used MSA lexicons as a base. Finally, two previ-
ous efforts focused on modeling shallow dialectal
segmentation using supervised methods (Riesa and
Yarowsky, 2006; Mohamed et al., 2012). Riesa and
Yarowsky (2006) presented a supervised algorithm
for online morpheme segmentation for Iraqi Arabic
that cut the out-of-vocabulary rates by half in the
context of machine translation into English. Mo-
hamed et al. (2012) annotated a collection of EGY
for morpheme boundaries and used this data to de-
velop an EGY tokenizer. Although these efforts
model DA directly, they remain at a shallow level
of representation (undiacritized surface morph seg-
mentation).

We use the ECAL lexicon as a base for CAL-
IMA and extend it further. Some of the expansion
techniques we used are inspired by previous solu-
tions (Abo Bakr et al., 2008; Salloum and Habash,
2011). For the morphological representation, we
follow the Linguistic Data Consortium guidelines
which extend the MSA POS guidelines to multi-
ple dialects (Maamouri et al., 2006; Maamouri et
al., 2012b). To address the problem of orthographic

variations, we follow the proposal by Habash et al.
(2012) who designed a conventional orthography for
DA (or CODA) for NLP applications in the CAL-
IMA databases. However, to handle input in a vari-
ety of spellings, we extend our analyzer to accept
non-CODA-compliant word forms but map them
only to CODA-compliant forms as part of the anal-
ysis.

4 Approach

We describe next the various steps for creating
CALIMA starting with ECAL. The details of the
approach are to some degree dependent on this
unique resource; however, some aspects of the ap-
proach may be generalizable to other resources, and
languages or dialects.

4.1 The Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lexicon
ECAL has about 66K entries: 27K verbs, 36K
nouns and adjectives, 1.5K proper nouns and 1K
closed classes. For each entry, the lexicon pro-
vides a phonological form, an undiacritized Ara-
bic script orthography, a lemma (in phonological
form), and morphological features, among other
information. There are 36K unique lemmas and
1,464 unique morphological feature combinations.
The following is an example ECAL entry for the
word �ñÒÊ¾J
J.Ó mbyklmwš ‘he did not talk to him’.

3

We only show Arabic orthography, phonology, and
lemma+features:
mbyklmwš
mabiykallimU$4

kallim:verb+pres-3rd-masc-sg+DO-3rd-masc-sg+neg

Our goal for CALIMA is to have a much larger
coverage, a CODA-compliant diacritized orthogra-
phy, and a morpheme-based morphological analysis.
The next steps allow us to accomplish these goals.

4.2 Diacritic Insertion
First, we built a component to diacritize the ECAL
undiacritized Arabic script entries in a way that is
consistent with ECAL phonological form. This was
implemented using a finite-state transducer (FST)
that maps the phonological form to multiple possible

3The same orthographic form has another reading ‘they did
not talk’ which of course has different morphological features.

4The phonological form as used in ECAL. For transcrip-
tion details, see (Kilany et al., 2002).

diacritized Arabic script forms. The form that is the
same as the undiacritized ECAL orthography (ex-
cept for diacritics) is used as the diacritized orthog-
raphy for the rest of the process. The FST consists of
about 160 transformations that we created manually.
All except for 100 cases are generic mappings, e.g.,
two repeated b consonants are turned into �H. b∼,5
or a short vowel u can be orthographically a short
vowel (just the diacritic u) or a long vowel uw which
shortened. The exceptional 100 cases were specified
by hand in the FST as complete string mappings.
These were mostly odd spellings of foreign words
or spelling errors. We did not attempt to correct or
change the ECAL letter spelling; we only added di-
acritics.

After diacritization, we modify the Arabic orthog-
raphy in the example above to: mabiykal~imuwš.

4.3 Morphological Tag Mapping
Next, we wrote rules to convert from ECAL
diacritized Arabic and morphology to CODA-
compliant diacritized Arabic and LDC EGY POS
compliant tags. The rules fall into three categories:
ignore rules specify which ECAL entries to ex-
clude due to errors; correction rules correct for some
ECAL entry errors; and prefix/suffix/stem rules are
used to identify specific pairs of prefix/suffix/stem
substrings and morphological features to map to
appropriate prefix/suffix/stem morphemes, respec-
tively. For stems, the majority of the rules also
identify roots and patterns. Since multiple root-
pattern combinations may be possible for a partic-
ular word, the appropriate root-pattern is chosen by
enforcing consistency across all the inflected forms
of the lemma of the word and minimizing the over-
all number of roots in the system. We do not use
or report on root-patterns in CALIMA in this paper
since this information is not required by the LDC
tags; however, we plan on using them in future ef-
forts exploiting templatic morphology.

At the time of writing this paper, the system in-
cluded 4,632 rules covering all POS. These include
1,248 ignore rules, 1,451 correction rules, 83 pre-
fix rules, and 441 suffixes rules. About 1,409 stem
rules are used to map core POS tags and iden-
tify templatic roots and patterns. Some rules were

5The ∼ diacritic or Shadda indicates the presence of conso-
nantal doubling.

semi-automatically created, but all were manually
checked. The rules are specified in a simple format
that is interpreted and applied by a separate rule pro-
cessing script. Developing the script and writing the
rules took about 3 person-months of effort.

As an example, the following three rules are used
to handle the circumfix ma++š ‘not’ and the pro-
gressing particle bi+.

PRE: ma,+neg => φ ,+neg >> mA/NEG_PART#
PRE: bi,+pres => φ ,+subj >> bi/PROG_PART+
SUF: š,+neg => φ,φ >> +š/NEG_PART

The input to the rule processor is a pair of surface
form and morphological features. Each rule matches
on a surface substring and a combination of mor-
phological features (first two comma-separated to-
kens in the rule) and rewrites the parts it matched
on (second two comma-separated tokens in the rule
after =>). The type of the rule, i.e. prefix or suf-
fix rule, determines how the matching is applied. In
addition, the rule generates a substring of the tar-
get tag (last token in the rule). The first and third
rules above handle a circumfix; the +neg feature is
not deleted in the first rule (which handles the pre-
fix) to allow the third rule (which handles the suffix)
to fire. The second rule rewrites the feature +pres
(present tense) as +subj (subjunctive) which is con-
sistent with the form of the verb after removing the
progressive particle bi+. After applying these rules
in addition to a few others, the above example is
turned into CODA and EGY POS compliant forms
(# means word boundary):6

mA#bi+yi+kal~im+huw+š
NEG_PART#PROG_PART+IV3MS+IV+IVSUFF_DO:3MS+NEG_PART

The stem rules, whose results are not shown here,
determine that the root is klm and the pattern is
1a22i3.

We extended the set of mapped ECAL entries
systematically. We copied entries and modified them
to include additional clitics that are not present with
all entries, e.g., the conjunction +

	
¬ fa+ ‘then’, and

the definite article +È@ Al+.

4.4 Orthographic Lemma Identification
The ECAL lemmas are specified in a phonological
form, e.g., in the example above, it is kallim. To de-
termine the diacritized Arabic orthography spelling

6CODA guidelines state that the negative particle AÓ mA is
not to be cliticized except in a very small number of words
(Habash et al., 2012).

5



of the lemma, we relied on the existence of the
lemma itself as an entry and other ad hoc rules to
identify the appropriate form. Using this technique,
we successfully identified the orthographic lemma
form for 97% of the cases. The remainder were
manually corrected. We followed the guidelines for
lemma specification in SAMA, e.g., verbs are cited
using the third person masculine singular perfective
form. For our example, the CALIMA lemma is
kal∼im.

4.5 Table Construction

We converted the mapped ECAL entries to a
SAMA-like representation (Graff et al., 2009). In
SAMA, morphological information is stored in six
tables. Three tables specify complex prefixes, com-
plex suffixes and stems. A complex prefix/suffix is
a set of prefix/suffix morphemes that are treated as a
single database entry, e.g., wi+Ha+yi is a complex
prefix made of three prefix morphemes. Each com-
plex prefix, complex suffix and stem has a class cat-
egory which abstract away from all similarly behav-
ing complex affixes and stems. The other three ta-
bles specify compatibility across the class categories
(prefix-stem, prefix-suffix and stem-suffix). We ex-
tracted triples of prefix-stem-suffix and used them to
build the six SAMA-like tables. The generated ta-
bles are usable by the sama-analyze engine provided
as part of SAMA3.1 (Graff et al., 2009). We also
added back off mode support for NOUN_PROP.

Prefix/stem/suffix class categories are generated
automatically. We identified specific features of the
word’s stem and affixes to generate specific affix
classes that allow for correct coverage expansion.
For example, in a complex suffix, the first morpheme
is the only one interacting with the stem. As such,
there is no need to give each complex suffix its own
class category, but rather assign the class category
based on the first morpheme. This allows us to auto-
matically extend the coverage of the analyzer com-
pared to that of the ECAL lexicon.

We also go further in terms of generalizations. For
instance, some of the pronoun clitics in EGY have
two forms that depend on whether the stem ends
with vowel-consonant or two consonants, e.g., AîE. A

�
J»

kitAb+hA ‘her book’ as opposed to Aî 	DK. @ Aibn+ahA
‘her son’. This information is used to give the suf-

fixes +hA and +ahA different class categories that
are generalizable to other similarly behaving clitics.

At this stage of our system, which we refer to as
CALIMA-core in Section 5.2, there are 252 unique
complex prefixes and 550 unique complex suffixes,
constructed from 43 and 86 unique simple prefixes
and suffixes, respectively. The total number of pre-
fix/suffix class categories is only 41 and 78, respec-
tively.

4.6 Various Table Extensions
We extended the CALIMA-core tables in a simi-
lar approach to the extension of SAMA tables done
by Salloum and Habash (2011). We distinguish two
types of extensions.

Additional Clitics and POS Tags We added a
number of clitics and POS tags that are not part of
ECAL, e.g., the prepositional clitic +¨ Ea+ ‘on’

and multiple POS tags for the proclitic +
	

¬ fa+ (as
CONJ, SUB_CONJ and CONNEC_PART). Here we copied a
related entry and modified it but kept its category
class. For example, in the case of +¨ Ea+ ‘on’, we
copied a prepositional clitic with similar distribution
and behavior: +H. bi+ ‘with’.

Non-CODA Orthography Support We extended
the generated tables to include common non-CODA
orthographic variants. The following are some ex-
amples of the expansions. First, we added the vari-
ant ð+ +w for two suffixes: è+ +uh ‘his/him’ and
@ð+ +uwA ‘they/you [plural]’. Second, we added
the form ha+ for the future particle Ha+. Third,
we introduced non-CODA-compliant Hamza forms
as variants for some stems. Finally, some of the
extensions target specific stems of frequently used
words, such as the adverb é 	QK. brDh ‘also’ which
can be written as èXQK. brdh and ñ

	
QK. brDw among

other forms. The non-CODA forms are only used to
match on the input word, with the returned analysis
being a corrected analysis. For example, the word
ñJ.

�
JºJ
ë hyktbw returns the analysis @ñJ.

�
JºJ
k Hyk-

tbwA Ha/FUT_PART+yi/IV3P+ktib/IV+uwA/3P ‘they
will write’ among other analyses. The orthographic
variations supported include 16 prefix cases, 41 stem
cases, and eight suffix cases.

After all the clitic, POS tag and orthographic ex-
tensions, the total number of complex prefix entries

6



substantially increases from 352 to 2,421, and the
number of complex suffix entries increases from 826
to 1,179. The number of stem entries increases from
around 60K to 100K. The total number of recogniz-
able word forms increases from 4M to 48M. We will
refer to the system with all the extensions as CAL-
IMA in Section 5.

5 Current Status

In this section, we present some statistics on the cur-
rent status of the CALIMA analyzer. As with all
work on morphological analyzers, there are always
ways to improve the quality and coverage.

5.1 System Statistics

CALIMA has 100K stems corresponding to 36K
lemmas. There are 2,421 complex prefixes and
1,179 complex suffixes (unique diacritized form and
POS tag combinations). The total number of ana-
lyzable words by CALIMA is 48M words (com-
pared to the 66K entries in ECAL). This is still lim-
ited compared to the SAMA3.1 analyzer (Graff et
al., 2009) whose coverage of MSA reaches 246M
words. See Table 1.

5.2 Coverage Evaluation

We tested CALIMA against a manually annotated
EGY corpus of 3,300 words (Maamouri et al.,
2012a) which was not used as part of its develop-
ment, i.e., a completely blind test.7 This evaluation
is a POS recall evaluation. It is not about selecting
the correct POS answer in context. We do not con-
sider whether the diacritization or the lemma choice
are correct or not. We compare CALIMA coverage
with that of ECAL and a state-of-the-art MSA an-
alyzer, SAMA3.1 (Graff et al., 2009). For the pur-
pose of completeness, we also compare CALIMA-
core and an extended version of SAMA3.1. The
SAMA3.1 extensions include two EGY verbal pro-
clitics (Ha/FUT_PART and bi/PROG_PART), some alter-
native suffixes that have no case or mood, and all the
orthographic variations used inside CALIMA. We

7We ignore some specific choices made by the annotators,
most importantly the use of ".VN" to mark verbal nominals,
which is not even supported in SAMA3.1. We also ignore
some annotation choices that are not consistent with the latest
LDC guidelines (Maamouri et al., 2012b), such as using gender-
marked plurals in some contexts, e.g., 3MP instead of 3P.

also compare the performance of different merged
versions of SAMA3.1 and CALIMA. The results
are presented in Table 1.

The second column in Table 1, Correct Answer
indicates the percentage of the test words whose cor-
rect analysis in context appears among the analyses
returned by the analyzer. The third column, No Cor-
rect Answer, presents the percentage of time one or
more analyses are returned, but none matching the
correct answer. The fourth column, No Analysis, in-
dicates the percentage of words returning no anal-
yses. The last column presents the total number of
recognizable words in the system.

CALIMA provides among its results a correct an-
swer for POS tags over 84% of the time. This is al-
most 27% absolute over the original list of words
from ECAL and almost 21% absolute over the
SAMA3.1 system. The various extensions in CAL-
IMA give it about 10% absolute over CALIMA-
core (and increase its size 10-fold). The limited
extensions to SAMA3.1 reduce the difference be-
tween it and CALIMA-core by 50% relative. The
overall performance of CALIMA-core merged with
SAMA3.1 is comparable to CALIMA, although
CALIMA has three times the number of no-analysis
cases. Merging CALIMA and extended SAMA3.1
increases the performance to 92%, an 8% absolute
increase over CALIMA alone. The final rate of no-
analysis cases is only 1%.

5.3 Error Analysis

We analyzed a sample of 100 cases where no an-
swer was found (No Correct Answer + No Analy-
sis) for CALIMA+extended SAMA3.1. About a
third of the cases (30%) are due to gold tag errors.
Irrecoverable typographical errors occur 5% of the
time, e.g., 	á�


	
¯ fyn instead of ú




	
¯ fy ‘in’. Only 2%

of the cases involve a speech effect, e.g., ÉJ
�
J
�
J
Ôg.
jmyyyyyl ‘beautiful!!!’. A fifth of the cases (22%) in-
volve a non-CODA orthographic choice which was
not extended, e.g., the shortened long vowel in �HAm.k

HjAt instead of the CODA-compliant �HAg. Ag HAjAt
‘things’. Another fifth of the cases (20%) are due to
incomplete paradigms, i.e., the lemma exists but not
the specific inflected stem. Finally, 21% of the cases
receive a SAMA3.1 analysis that is almost correct,
except for the presence of some mood/case mark-

SAMA3.1 63.7% 27.1% 9.3% 246M

CALIMA-core + SAMA3.1 84.4% 12.8% 2.8% 287M

ers that are absent in EGY, and which we did not
handle. Overall, these are positive results that sug-
gest the next steps should involve additional ortho-
graphic and morphological extensions and paradigm
completion.

6 Outlook

We plan to continue improving the coverage of
CALIMA using a variety of methods. First, we are
investigating techniques to automatically fill in the
paradigm gaps using information from multiple en-
tries in ECAL belonging to different lemmas that
share similar characteristics, e.g., hollow verbs in
Form I. Another direction is to update our tables
with less common orthographic variations, perhaps
using information from the phonological forms in
ECAL. Manual addition of specific entries will also
be considered to fill in lexicon gaps. Furthermore,
we plan to add additional features which we did not
discuss such as the English and MSA glosses for all
the entries in CALIMA. We also plan to make this
tool public so it can be used by other people work-
ing on EGY NLP tasks, from annotating corpora to
building morphological disambiguation tools.
