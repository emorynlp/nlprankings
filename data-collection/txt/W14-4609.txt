Abstract

We present gdbank, a small handbuilt corpus of 32 sentences with dependency structures and
categorial grammar type assignments. The sentences have been chosen to illustrate as broad a
range of the unusual features of Scottish Gaelic as possible, particularly nouns being used to
represent psychological states where more thoroughly-studied languages such as English and
French would prefer a verb, and prepositions marking aspect, as is also seen in Welsh and, for
example, Irish Gaelic. We provide hand-built dependency trees, building on previous work on
Irish Gaelic and using the Universal Dependency Scheme. We also provide a tentative categorial
grammar account of the words in the sentences, based largely on previous work on English.

1 Introduction

Scottish Gaelic (usually hereafter Gaelic) is a Celtic language, rather closely related to Irish, with around
59,000 speakers as of the last UK census in 2011. As opposed to the situation for Irish Gaelic (Lynn et
al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013; Lynn et al., 2014) there are no treebanks or tagging
schemes for Scottish Gaelic, although there are machine-readable dictionaries and databases available
from Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. A single paper in the ACL Anthology (Kessler, 1995) mentions Scottish Gaelic
in the context of computational dialectology of Irish. There is also an LREC workshop paper (Scan-
nell, 2006) on machine translation between Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Elsewhere in the Celtic languages,
Welsh has an LFG grammar (Mittendorf and Sadler, 2005) but no treebanks. For Breton there is a small
amount of work on morphological analysis and Constraint-Grammar-based machine translation (Tyers,
2010). Recent work on the grammar of Scottish Gaelic (for example (Adger and Ramchand, 2003; Adger
and Ramchand, 2005), but there are many more examples) has largely focussed on theoretical syntac-
tic issues somewhat distant from the more surfacy approaches popular in the field of natural language
processing. This paper explores grammatical issues in Scottish Gaelic by means of dependency tagging
and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), which we see as complementary approaches. As such it
is explicitly inspired by CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), which consists of dependency
structures and CCG derivations for over 99% of the Penn Treebank. It is hoped that this corpus will be
a useful adjunct to currently on-going work in developing a part-of-speech tagset and tagger for Scottish
Gaelic.

Section 2 describes how the corpus was prepared, sections 3 and 4 give some context for the depen-
dency scheme and categorial grammar annotations respectively, and the main part of the paper is section
5, which deals with language-specific features of the corpus.

2 Preparing the corpus

The corpus consists of a small handbuilt selection of sentences from the transcripts of An Litir Bheag,
which is a weekly podcast from the BBC written by a native speaker and aimed at Gaelic learners,
example sentences from (Lamb, 2003), the BBC’s online news in Gaelic and the Gaelic column in the
Scotsman newspaper. In order to illustrate as much of the interesting points of Scottish Gaelic as possible,

we looked in particular for sentences describing psychological states and made sure that a reasonable
number of the sentences used each verb for “to be”, which we will illustrate in section 5.

The sentences are tokenized by hand using the following rules: (1) Punctuation which never forms
part of a lexical item such as the comma, the full stop, the colon and the semicolon is always separated
out from the previous word. (2) Strings connected by a hyphen, for example h-Alba in Banca na h-Alba
(Bank of Scotland) or t-Òban as in an t-Òban (the town of Oban) are always kept together. (3) The
apostrophe is kept together with the copula where it proceeds it, for example in ’S fhearr leam (I like).
(4) Because the past tense particle do is reduced to dh’ before a vowel and before f, and this is always
typographically closed up, we separate out past-tense dh’ as its own token. These rules work for the
small dataset described here but would clearly need to be expanded for work in the wild.

In this preliminary work the dependencies and types have been determined by a single, non-native
speaker, annotator, according to a set of guidelines which were built up during the annotation process.
This is clearly less than ideal, however, the guidelines are available along with the corpus and we hope
to be able to get the input of a native speaker, not least for interannotator studies.

We use the CoNLL-X format (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), leaving the POS and projective dependency
fields empty and store the categorial grammar type under field 6, FEATS.

3 Dependency scheme

There are four dependency schemes that we consulted while preparing the corpus. The initial inspiration
was provided by the C&C parser (Curran et al., 2007), which in addition to providing categorial gram-
mar derivations for sentences provides a dependency structure in the GR (Grammatical Representation)
scheme due to (Briscoe and Carroll, 2000; Briscoe and Carroll, 2002). This contains 23 types and was
developed originally for parser evaluation. Another popular scheme is the Stanford Dependency scheme
(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; de Marneffe and Manning, 2013), which is more finely-grained with
over twice the number of dependency types to deal specifically with noisy data and to make it more
accessible to non-linguists building information extraction applications. A very important scheme is the
Dublin scheme for Irish (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013), which is of a similar
size to the Stanford scheme, but the reason for its size relative to GR is that it includes a large num-
ber of dependencies intended to handle grammatical features found in Irish but not in English. Lastly
we mention the Universal Dependency Scheme developed in (McDonald et al., 2013), which we have
adopted, despite its being coarser-grained than the Dublin scheme, on account of its simplicity and utility
for cross-lingual comparisons and cross-training (Lynn et al., 2014).

Table 1 gives examples of the dependency relations used along with their mapping to the GR scheme.

4 Categorial grammar

Combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) is a type-logical system which was developed to represent nat-
ural languages such as English but has subsequently been extended to other systems such as chord se-

61



quences in jazz (Granroth-Wilding and Steedman, 2012). For a full description the reader is referred to
(Steedman and Baldridge, 2003), but in order to follow the rest of this paper you merely need to know
that the type N/N is a function which takes an argument of N to its right, returning N, and that the type
N\N is a function expecting an argument of N to its left and that these are combined by application,
composition, where A/B combines with B/C to yield A/C, and type-raising where N is converted to
T/(N\T). Attractive features of CCG for modelling a less-well-studied language include that it is a lex-
ical theory in which it is the lexicon contains the rules for how words are combined to make sense rather
than an external grammar, that it allows all manner of unconventional constituents, which is particularly
powerful for parsing coordinated structures in English, that it is equivalent to a weakly context-sensitive
grammar and hence has the power of a real natural language. In Steedman and Baldridge (2003) there are
examples of the application of multimodal CCG to Irish Gaelic. However, to the best of our knowledge
this paper is the first application of CCG to Scottish Gaelic.

In gdbank, there is a single hand-built CCG derivation for every sentence. The notation is based on that
in CCGbank with a small number of adaptations for Gaelic (see next section). The basic units that can be
assembled into types are S (clauses), N (nouns), conj (conjugations), and PP (prepositional phrases).
For subcategorization purposes and to help keep things clear for the annotator and the reader we mark
prepositional phrases with the dictionary form of the preposition.

We have not yet investigated overgeneration and ungrammatical sentences, hence there is only one
kind of modality in gdbank; however restricting the way words can combine to the way in which they
actually do combine in Gaelic is an obvious and essential next step.

5 Language-specific features

Prepositional phrases in Gaelic are often single-word, fused preposition–pronouns, a part-of-speech
found across the Celtic languages. An ambiguous case of this is the token ris, which can be either ri with
the pronoun e, hence taking the CCG type PP[ri], or the pre-determiner form of ri, hence PP[ri]/N[b].
The other class of fused preposition–pronoun we need to consider is that in sentences like Tha mi gad
chluinntinn, “I can hear you”, where gad is ag fused with do “your”. In this case it has type PP[ag]/S[n].
Adjectives as in CCGbank are treated as clauses, S[adj]. The verbal noun is labelled S[n] by analogy
with Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007). In addition to declarative and interrogative clauses, S[dcl]
and S[q], we take our lead from the fourfold division of preverbal particles and add negative clauses
S[neg], usually introduced by cha or chan, and negative interrogative clauses, S[negq], introduced
by nach.

There are two verbs for “to be” in Scottish Gaelic, bi and is. Bi is used for predicate statements
about nouns, to forming the present tense and to describe some psychological states. It does not usually
equate two NPs, with an exception we will come to. In the Dublin scheme the prepositional phrase
headed by ag in Tá sé ag iascaireacht (“He is fishing.”) is treated as being an externally-controlled
complement of Tá (Gaelic tha) and we carry this analysis over into Scottish Gaelic where this is the
most common way of expressing the present tense. Figure 1 demonstrates this, where dhachaigh is a
non-clausal modifier of dol, the verbal noun for “to go”. Is can be used as the copula between two NPs,
and to express psychological states such as liking and preference. To say “I am a teacher”, the Gaelic
is ‘S e tidsear a th’ annam. This, at least on the surface, equates pronoun e, with a noun described by a
relative clause including the verb bi. Fig. 1 shows our dependency tree for this. Note that this is different
from the scheme in Lynn et al. (2012b) because of a difference between the two languages. They treat
the analogous sentence Is tusa an múinteoir “You are the teacher” as having a subject, “the teacher”, and
a clausal predicate, tusa, “you indeed”.

The most straightforward way of expressing a preference is the assertive is followed by an adjective
or noun, a PP marking the preferrer, and then the object. If you dislike music, you might say Is beag orm
ceòl. There are exactly analogous constructions in Irish with is + adjective + PP[le] + object, for example
Is maith liom... “I like...”, which in (Uı́ Dhonnchadha, 2009) is treated as having the prepositional
phrase as the subject and the adjective as predicate. We modify this to use adpmod as in the Universal
Dependency Scheme as shown in Fig. 1.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this paper we have presented a small handbuilt corpus of Scottish Gaelic sentences, their dependency
structures and their CCG derivations. To the best of our knowledge this represents the first attempt to
handle a range of real-life Scottish Gaelic sentences in such a way. gdbank itself and the guidelines
used to build it are available from https://code.google.com/p/gdbank/ and we welcome
feedback. We have of course only been able to illustrate a small number of constructions. Tables 2 and
3 list counts for the categorial types and dependency relations used. In 32 sentences there are a total of
406 tokens.

We have not yet on the other hand attempted to deal with the morphology of Scottish Gaelic, for
example lenition and slenderization, beyond drawing the attention of the human annotator to these phe-
nomena when they may affect the correct parsing of a sentence. Clearly for automated natural-language
processing of Gaelic these will need to be treated programmatically. We also disregard case and gender,
although we expect that these will be dealt with as part of a rather more ambitious project, that of the
Lamb group at the University of Edinburgh to build a part-of-speech tagset and tagged corpus which we
look forward to seeing.
