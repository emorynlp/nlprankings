Abstract

This paper describes an experiment in which
we try to automatically correct mistakes in
grammatical agreement in English to Czech
MT outputs. We perform several rule-based
corrections on sentences parsed to dependency
trees. We prove that it is possible to improve
the MT quality of majority of the systems par-
ticipating in WMT shared task. We made both
automatic (BLEU) and manual evaluations.

1 Introduction

This paper is a joint report on two English-to-Czech
submissions to the WMT11 shared translation task.
The main contribution is however the proposal and
evaluation of a rule-based post-processing system
DEPFIX aimed at correcting errors in Czech gram-
mar applicable to any MT system. This is somewhat
the converse of other approaches (e.g. Simard et al.
(2007)) where a statistical system was applied for
the post-processing of a rule-based one.

2 Our phrase-based systems

This section briefly describes our underlying phrase-
based systems. One of them (CU-BOJAR) was sub-
mitted directly to the WMT11 manual evaluation,
the other one (CU-TWOSTEP) was first corrected by
the proposed method (Section 3 below) and then
submitted under the name CU-MARECEK.

Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under grant agreement

grants GAUK 116310 and GA201/09/H057.

2.1 Data for statistical systems

Our training parallel data consists of CzEng 0.9
(Bojar and Žabokrtský, 2009), the News Commen-
tary corpus v.6 as released by the WMT11 orga-
nizers, the EMEA corpus, a corpus collected from
the transcripts of TED talks (http://www.ted.com),
the parallel news and separately some of the par-
allel web pages of the European Commission
(http://ec.europa.eu), and the Official Journal of the
European Union as released by the Apertium con-
sortium (http://apertium.eu/data).

A custom web crawler was used for the European
Commission website. English and Czech websites
were matched according to their URLs. Unfortu-
nately, Czech websites very often contain untrans-
lated parts of English texts. Because of this, we
aimed especially at the news articles, which are very
often translated correctly and also more relevant for
the shared task. Texts were segmented using train-
able tokenizer (Klyueva and Bojar, 2008) and dedu-
plicated. Processed texts were automatically aligned
by Hunalign (Varga and others, 2005).

The data from the Official Journal were first con-
verted from XML to plain text. The documents were
paired according to their filenames. To better han-
dle the nature of these data, we decided to divide
the documents into two classes based on the aver-
age number of words per sentence: “lists” are docu-
ments with less than 2.8 words per sentence, other
documents are called “texts”. The corresponding
“lists” were aligned line by line. The corresponding
“texts” were automatically segmented by trainable
tokenizer and aligned automatically by Hunalign.

We use the following two Czech language mod-

426



els, their weights are optimized in MERT:

• 5-gram LM from the Czech side of CzEng (ex-
cluding the Navajo section). The LM was con-
structed by interpolating LMs of the individual do-
mains (news, EU legislation, technical documenta-
tion, etc.) to achieve the lowest perplexity on the
WMT08 news test set.

• 6-gram LM from the monolingual data supplied by
WMT11 organizers (news of the individual years
and News Commentary), the Czech National Cor-
pus and a web collection of Czech texts. Again, the
final LM is constructed by interpolating the smaller
LMs1 for the WMT08 news test set.

2.2 Baseline Moses (CU-BOJAR)
The system denoted CU-BOJAR for English-to-
Czech is simple phrase-based translation, i.e. Moses
without factors. We tokenized, lemmatized and
tagged all texts using the tools wrapped in TectoMT
(Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010). We further tokenize
e.g. dashed words (“23-year”) after all the process-
ing is finished. Phrase-based MT is then able to
handle such expressions both at once, or decompose
them as needed to cover unseen variations. We use
lexicalized reordering (orientation-bidirectional-fe).
The translation runs in “supervised truecase”, which
means that we use the output of our lemmatizers
to decide whether the word should be lowercased
or should preserve uppercasing. After the transla-
tion, the first letter in the output is simply upper-
cased. The model is optimized using Moses’ stan-
dard MERT on the WMT09 test set.

The organizers of WMT11 encouraged partici-
pants to apply simple normalization to their data
(both for training and testing).2 The main purpose
of the normalization is to improve the consistency of
typographical rules. Unfortunately, some of the au-
tomatic changes may accidentally damage the mean-
ing of the expression.3 We therefore opted to submit

1The interpolated LM file (gzipped ARPA format) is 5.1 GB
so we applied LM pruning as implemented in SRI toolkit with
the threshold 10−14 to reduce the file size to 2.3 GB.

3Fixing the ordering of the full stop and the quote is wrong

because the order (at least in Czech typesetting) depends on
whether it is the full sentence or a final phrase that is captured
in the quotes. Even riskier are rules handling decimal and thou-
sand separators in numbers. While there are language-specific
conventions, they are not always followed and the normaliza-
tion can in such cases confuse the order of magnitude by 3.

the output based on non-normalized test sets as our
primary English-to-Czech submission.

We invested much less effort into the submission
called CU-BOJAR for Czech-to-English. The only
interesting feature there is the use of alternative de-
coding paths to translate either from the Czech form
or from the Czech lemma equipped with meaning-
bearing morphological properties, e.g. the number
of nouns. Bojar and Kos (2010) used the same setup
with simple lemmas in the fallback decoding path.
The enriched lemmas perform marginally better.

2.3 Two-step translation

Our two-step translation is essentially the same
setup as detailed by Bojar and Kos (2010): (1)
the English source is translated to simplified Czech,
and (2) the simplified Czech is monotonically trans-
lated to fully inflected Czech. Both steps are sim-
ple phrase-based models. Instead of word forms, the
simplified Czech uses lemmas enriched by a sub-
set of morphological features selected manually to
encode only properties overt both in English and
Czech such as the tense of verbs or number of nouns.
Czech-specific morphological properties indicating
various agreements (e.g. number and gender of ad-
jectives, gender of verbs) are imposed in the second
step solely on the basis of the language model.

The first step uses the same parallel and mono-
lingual corpora as CU-BOJAR, except the LMs being
trained on the enriched lemmas, not on word forms.
The second step uses exactly the same LM as CU-
BOJAR but the phrase-table is extracted from all our
Czech monolingual data (phrase length limit of 1.)

3 Grammatical post-processing

Phrase-based machine translation systems often
have problems with grammatical agreement, espe-
cially on longer dependencies. Sometimes, there is
a mistake in agreement even between adjacent words
because each one belongs to a different phrase. The
goal of our post-processing is to correct forms of
some words so that they do not violate grammatical
rules (eg. grammatical agreement).

The problem is how to find the correct syntactic
relations in the output of an MT system. Parsers
trained on correct sentences can rely on grammat-
ical agreement, according to which they determine

427



the dependencies between words. Unfortunately, the
agreement in MT outputs is often wrong and the
parser fails to produce a correct parse tree. There-
fore, we would need a parser trained on a manually
annotated treebank consisting of specific outputs of
machine translation systems. Such a treebank does
not exist and we do not even want to create one, be-
cause the MT systems are changing constantly and
also because manual annotation of texts that are of-
ten not even understandable would be almost a su-
perhuman task.

The DEPFIX system was implemented in TectoMT
framework (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010). MT out-
puts were tagged by Morče tagger (Spoustová et al.,
2007) and then parsed with MST parser (McDon-
ald et al., 2005) that was trained on the Prague De-
pendency Treebank (Hajič and others, 2006), i.e.
on correct Czech sentences. We used an improved
implementation with some additional features es-
pecially tuned for Czech (Novák and Žabokrtský,
2007). The parser accuracy is much lower on the
“noisy” MT output sentences, but a lot of dependen-
cies in which we are to correct grammatical agree-
ment are determined correctly. Adapting the parser
for outputs of MT systems will be addressed in the
coming months.

A typical example of a correction is the agreement
between the subject and the predicate: they should
share the morphological number and gender. If they
do not, we simply change the number and gender
of the predicate in agreement with the subject.4 An
example of such a changed predicate is in Figure 1.

Apart from the dependency tree of the target sen-
tence, we can also use the dependency tree of the
source sentence. Source sentences are grammat-
ically correct and the accuracy of the tagger and
the parser is accordingly higher there. Words in
the source and target sentences are aligned using
GIZA++5 (Och and Ney, 2003) but verbose outputs
of the original MT systems would be possibly a bet-
ter option. The rules for fixing grammatical agree-
ment between words can thus consider also the de-
pendency relations and morphological caregories of
their English counterparts in the input sentence.

4In this case, we suppose that the number of the subject has
a much higher chance to be correct.

5GIZA++ was run on lemmatized texts in both directions
and intersection symmetrization was used.

3.1 Grammatical rules

We have manually devised a set of the following
rules. Their input is the dependency tree of a Czech
sentence (MT output) and its English source sen-
tence (MT input) with the nodes aligned where pos-
sible. Each of the rules fires if the specified con-
ditions (“IF”) are matched, executes the command
(“DO”) , usually changing one or more morphologi-
cal categories of the word, and generates a new word
form for any word which was changed.

The rules make use of several morphological cat-
egories of the word (node:number, node:gender...),
its syntactic relation to its parent in the dependency
tree (node:afun) and the same information for its
English counterpart (node:en) and other nodes in
the dependency trees.

The order of the rules in this paper follows the
order in which they are applied; this is important, as
often a rule changes a morphological category of a
word which is then used by a subsequent rule.

3.1.1 Noun number (NounNum)
In Czech, a word in singular sometimes has the

same form as in plural. Because the tagger often
fails to tag the word correctly, we try to correct the
tag of a noun tagged as singular if its English coun-
terpart is in plural, so that the subsequent rules can
work correctly.

We trust the form of the word but changing the
number may also require to change the morphologi-
cal case (i.e. the tagger was wrong with both number
and case). In such cases we choose the first (linearly

428



from nominative to instrumentative) case matching
the form. The rule is:
IF: node:pos = noun &
node:number = singular &

node:en:number = plural

DO: node:number := plural;
node:case := find case(node:form, plural);

3.1.2 Subject case (SubjCase)
The subject of a Czech sentence must be in the

nominative case. Since the parser often fails in
marking the correct word as a subject, we use the
English source sentence and presuppose that the
Czech counterpart of the English subject is also a
subject in the Czech sentence.
IF: node:en:afun = subject
DO: node:case := nominative;

3.1.3 Subject-predicate agreement (SubjPred)
Subject and predicate in Czech agree in their mor-

phological number. To identify a Czech Subject, we
trust the subject in the English sentence. Then we
copy the number from the (Czech) Subject to the
Czech Predicate.
IF: node:en:afun = subject &
parent:afun = predicate

DO: parent:number := node:number;

3.1.4 Subject-past participle agreement (SubjPP)
Czech past participles agree with subject in

morphological gender.
IF: node:pos = noun|pronoun &
node:en:afun = subject &

parent:pos = verb past participle

DO: parent:number := node:number;
parent:gender := node:gender;

3.1.5 Preposition without children (PrepNoCh)
In our dependency trees, the preposition is the

parent of the words it belongs to (usually a noun). A
preposition without children is incorrect so we find
nodes aligned to its English counterpart’s children
and rehang them under the preposition.
IF: node:afun = preposition &
!node:has children &

node:en:has children

DO: foreach node:en:child;
node:en:child:cs:parent := node;

3.1.6 Preposition-noun agreement (PrepNoun)
Every prepositions gets a morphological case as-

signed to it by the tagger, with which the dependent
noun should agree.
IF: parent:pos = preposition &
node:pos = noun

DO: node:case := parent:case;

3.1.7 Noun-adjective agreement (NounAdj)
Czech adjectives and nouns agree in morpholog-

ical gender, number and case. We assume that the
noun is correct and change the adjective accordingly.
IF: node:pos = adjective &
parent:pos = noun

DO: node:gender := parent:gender;
node:number := parent:number;

node:case := parent:case;

3.1.8 Reflexive particle deletion (ReflTant)
Czech reflexive verbs are accompanied by reflex-

ive particles (‘se’ and ‘si’). We delete particles not
beloning to any verb (or adjective derived from a
verb).
IF: node:form = ‘se’|‘si’ &
node:pos = pronoun &

parent:pos != verb|verbal adjective

DO: remove node;

4 Experiments and results

We tested our CU-TWOSTEP system with DEPFIX
post-processing on both WMT10 and WMT11 test-
ing data. This combined system was submitted to
shared translation task as CU-MARECEK. We also
ran the DEPFIX post-processing on all other partici-
pating systems.

4.1 Automatic evaluation

The achieved BLEU scores are shown in Tables 1
and 2. They show the scores before and after the
DEPFIX post-processing. It is interesting that the
improvements are quite different between the years
2010 and 2011 in terms of their BLEU score. While
the average improvement on WMT10 test set was
0.21 BLEU points, it was only 0.05 BLEU points on
the WMT11 test set. Even the results of the same
TWOSTEP system differ in a similar way, so it must
have been caused by the different data.

4.2 Manual evaluation

Two independent annotators evaluated DEPFIX man-
ually on the outputs of CU-TWOSTEP and ONLINE-
B. We randomly selected 1000 sentences from the
newssyscombtest2011 data set and the appropri-
ate translations made by these two systems. The
annotators got the outputs before and after DEPFIX
post-processing and their task was to decide which
translation6 from these two is better and label it by
the letter ‘a’. If it was not possible to determine

6They were also provided with the source English sentence
and the reference translation. The options were shuffled and
indentical candidate sentences were collapsed.

which is better, they labeled both by ‘n’.
Table 3 below shows that about 60% of sentences

fixed by DEPFIX were improved and only about 20%
were worsened. DEPFIX worked a little better on the
ONLINE-B, making fewer changes but also fewer
wrong changes. It is probably connected with the
fact that overall better translations by ONLINE-B are
easier to parse.

The matrix of inter-annotator agreement is in Ta-
ble 5. Our two annotators agreed in 374 sentences
(out of 516), that is 72.5%. On the other hand, if
we consider only cases where both annotators chose
different translation as better (no indefinite marks),
we get only 8.8% disagreement (32 out of 364).

Using the manual evaluation, we can also measure
performance of the individual rules. Table 6 shows
the number of all, improved or worsened sentences
where a particular rule was applied. Definitely, the
most useful rule (used often and quite reliable) was
the one correcting noun-adjective agreement, fol-
lowed by the subject-pastparticiple agreement rule.

In each changed sentence, two rules (not neces-
sarily related ones) were applied on average.

4.3 Manual evaluation across data sets

The fact that the improvements in BLEU scores on
WMT10 test set are much higher has led us to one
more experiment: we compare manual annotations
of 330 sentences from each of the WMT10 and

Table 4: Manual and automatic evaluation of the DEPFIX post-processing on CU-TWOSTEP system across different
datasets. 330 sentences were randomly selected from each of the WMT10 and WMT11 test sets. Both manual scores
and BLEU are computed only on the sentences that were changed by the DEPFIX post-processing.

WMT11 sets as translated by CU-TWOSTEP and cor-
rected by DEPFIX. Table 4 shows that WMT10 and
WMT11 are comparable in manually estimated im-
provement (50–65%). BLEU does not indicate that
and even estimates a drop in quality on this subset
WMT11. (The absolute BLEU scores differ from
BLEUs on the whole test sets but we are interested
only in the change of the scores.) BLEU is thus not
very suitable for the evaluation of DEPFIX.

5 Conclusions and future work

Manual evaluation shows that our DEPFIX approach
to improving MT output quality is sensible. Al-
though it is unable to correct many serious MT er-
rors, such as wrong lexical choices, it can improve
the grammaticality of the output in a way that the
language model often cannot, which leads to out-
put that is considered to be better by humans. We
also suggest that BLEU is not appropriate metric
for measuring changes in grammatical correctness
of sentences, especially with inflective languages.

An advantage of our method is that it is possible
to apply it on output of any MT system (although it
works better for phrase-based MT systems). While
DEPFIX has been developed using the output of CU-
BOJAR, the rules we devised are not specific to any
MT system. They simply describe several grammat-
ical rules of Czech language that can be machine-
checked and if errors are found, the output can be
corrected. Moreover, our method only requires the
source sentence and the translation output for its op-

eration – i.e. it is not necessary to modify the MT
system itself.

We are now considering modifications of the
parser so that it is able to parse the incorrect sen-
tences produced by MT. Theoretically it would be
possible to train the parser on annotated ungrammat-
ical sentences, but we do not want to invest such an-
notation labour. Instead, when parsing the Czech
sentence we will make the parser utilize the infor-
mation contained in the parse tree of the English
sentence, which is usually correct. We will proba-
bly also have to make the parser put less weight to
the often incorrect tagger output. An alternative is
to avoid parsing of the target and project the source
parse to the target side using word alignments, if
provided by the MT system.

Because some of our rules are able to work using
only the tagger output, we will also try to apply them
before the parsing as they might help the parser by
correcting some of the tags.

We will also try several modifications of the tag-
ger, but the English sentence does not help us so
much here, because it does not contain any infor-
mation regarding the most common errors – in-
correct assignment of morphological gender and
case. However, it could help with part of speech
and morphological number disambiguation. More-
over, it would be probably helpful for us if the tag-
ger included several most probable hypotheses, as
the single-output-only disambiguation is often erro-
neous on ungrammatical sentences.
