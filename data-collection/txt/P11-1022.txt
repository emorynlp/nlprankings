Abstract

State-of-the-art statistical machine translation
(MT) systems have made significant progress
towards producing user-acceptable translation
output. However, there is still no efficient
way for MT systems to inform users which
words are likely translated correctly and how
confident it is about the whole sentence. We
propose a novel framework to predict word-
level and sentence-level MT errors with a large
number of novel features. Experimental re-
sults show that the MT error prediction accu-
racy is increased from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score.
The Pearson correlation between the proposed
confidence measure and the human-targeted
translation edit rate (HTER) is 0.6. Improve-
ments between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are
obtained with the n-best list reranking task us-
ing the proposed confidence measure. Also,
we present a visualization prototype of MT er-
rors at the word and sentence levels with the
objective to improve post-editor productivity.

1 Introduction
State-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) systems are
making progress to generate more usable translation
outputs. In particular, statistical machine translation
systems (Koehn et al., 2007; Bach et al., 2007; Shen
et al., 2008) have advanced to a state that the transla-
tion quality for certain language pairs (e.g. Spanish-
English, French-English, Iraqi-English) in certain do-
mains (e.g. broadcasting news, force-protection, travel)
is acceptable to users.

However, a remaining open question is how to pre-
dict confidence scores for machine translated words
and sentences. An MT system typically returns the
best translation candidate from its search space, but
still has no reliable way to inform users which word
is likely to be correctly translated and how confident it
is about the whole sentence. Such information is vital

to realize the utility of machine translation in many ar-
eas. For example, a post-editor would like to quickly
identify which sentences might be incorrectly trans-
lated and in need of correction. Other areas, such as
cross-lingual question-answering, information extrac-
tion and retrieval, can also benefit from the confidence
scores of MT output. Finally, even MT systems can
leverage such information to do n-best list reranking,
discriminative phrase table and rule filtering, and con-
straint decoding (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008).

Numerous attempts have been made to tackle the
confidence estimation problem. The work of Blatz et
al. (2004) is perhaps the best known study of sentence
and word level features and their impact on transla-
tion error prediction. Along this line of research, im-
provements can be obtained by incorporating more fea-
tures as shown in (Quirk, 2004; Sanchis et al., 2007;
Raybaud et al., 2009; Specia et al., 2009). Sori-
cut and Echihabi (2010) developed regression models
which are used to predict the expected BLEU score
of a given translation hypothesis. Improvement also
can be obtained by using target part-of-speech and null
dependency link in a MaxEnt classifier (Xiong et al.,
2010). Ueffing and Ney (2007) introduced word pos-
terior probabilities (WPP) features and applied them in
the n-best list reranking. From the usability point of
view, back-translation is a tool to help users to assess
the accuracy level of MT output (Bach et al., 2007).
Literally, it translates backward the MT output into the
source language to see whether the output of backward
translation matches the original source sentence.

However, previous studies had a few shortcomings.
First, source-side features were not extensively inves-
tigated. Blatz et al.(2004) only investigated source n-
gram frequency statistics and source language model
features, while other work mainly focused on target
side features. Second, previous work attempted to in-
corporate more features but faced scalability issues,
i.e., to train many features we need many training ex-
amples and to train discriminatively we need to search
through all possible translations of each training exam-
ple. Another issue of previous work was that they are
all trained with BLEU/TER score computing against211



the translation references which is different from pre-
dicting the human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER)
which is crucial in post-editing applications (Snover et
al., 2006; Papineni et al., 2002). Finally, the back-
translation approach faces a serious issue when forward
and backward translation models are symmetric. In this
case, back-translation will not be very informative to
indicate forward translation quality.

In this paper, we predict error types of each word
in the MT output with a confidence score, extend it to
the sentence level, then apply it to n-best list reranking
task to improve MT quality, and finally design a vi-
sualization prototype. We try to answer the following
questions:

• Can we use a rich feature set such as source-
side information, alignment context, and depen-
dency structures to improve error prediction per-
formance?

• Can we predict more translation error types i.e
substitution, insertion, deletion and shift?

• How good do our prediction methods correlate
with human correction?

• Do confidence measures help the MT system to
select a better translation?

• How confidence score can be presented to im-
prove end-user perception?

In Section 2, we describe the models and training
method for the classifier. We describe novel features
including source-side, alignment context, and depen-
dency structures in Section 3. Experimental results and
analysis are reported in Section 4. Section 5 and 6
present applications of confidence scores.

2 Confidence Measure Model
2.1 Problem setting
Confidence estimation can be viewed as a sequen-
tial labelling task in which the word sequence is
MT output and word labels can be Bad/Good or
Insertion/Substitution/Shift/Good. We first esti-
mate each individual word confidence and extend it to
the whole sentence. Arabic text is fed into an Arabic-
English SMT system and the English translation out-
puts are corrected by humans in two phases. In phase
one, a bilingual speaker corrects the MT system trans-
lation output. In phase two, another bilingual speaker
does quality checking for the correction done in phase
one. If bad corrections were spotted, they correct them
again. In this paper we use the final correction data
from phase two as the reference thus HTER can be
used as an evaluation metric. We have 75 thousand sen-
tences with 2.4 million words in total from the human
correction process described above.

We obtain training labels for each word by perform-
ing TER alignment between MT output and the phase-
two human correction. From TER alignments we ob-
served that out of total errors are 48% substitution, 28%

deletion, 13% shift, and 11% insertion errors. Based
on the alignment, each word produced by the MT sys-
tem has a label: good, insertion, substitution and shift.
Since a deletion error occurs when it only appears in the
reference translation, not in the MT output, our model
will not predict deletion errors in the MT output.

2.2 Word-level model
In our problem, a training instance is a word from MT
output, and its label when the MT sentence is aligned
with the human correction. Given a training instance x,
y is the true label of x; f stands for its feature vector
f(x, y); and w is feature weight vector. We define a
feature-rich classifier score(x, y) as follow

score(x, y) = w.f(x, y) (1)

To obtain the label, we choose the class with the high-
est score as the predicted label for that data instance.
To learn optimized weights, we use the Margin Infused
Relaxed Algorithm or MIRA (Crammer and Singer,
2003; McDonald et al., 2005) which is an online learner
closely related to both the support vector machine and
perceptron learning framework. MIRA has been shown
to provide state-of-the-art performance for sequential
labelling task (Rozenfeld et al., 2006), and is also able
to provide an efficient mechanism to train and opti-
mize MT systems with lots of features (Watanabe et
al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2009). In general, weights are
updated at each step time t according to the following
rule:

wt+1 = arg minwt+1 ||wt+1 − wt||

s.t. score(x, y) ≥ score(x, y′) + L(y, y′)
(2)

where L(y, y′) is a measure of the loss of using y′ in-
stead of the true label y. In this problem L(y, y′) is 0-1
loss function. More specifically, for each instance xi in
the training data at a time t we find the label with the
highest score:

y′ = arg max
y

score(xi, y) (3)

the weight vector is updated as follow

wt+1 = wt + τ(f(xi, y)− f(xi, y′)) (4)

τ can be interpreted as a step size; when τ is a large
number we want to update our weights aggressively,
otherwise weights are updated conservatively.

τ = max(0, α)

α = min

{
C, L(y,y

′)−(score(xi,y)−score(xi,y′))
||f(xi,y)−f(xi,y′)||22

}
(5)

where C is a positive constant used to cap the maxi-
mum possible value of τ . In practice, a cut-off thresh-
old n is the parameter which decides the number of
features kept (whose occurrence is at least n) during212



training. Note that MIRA is sensitive to constant C,
the cut-off feature threshold n, and the number of iter-
ations. The final weight is typically normalized by the
number of training iterations and the number of train-
ing instances. These parameters are tuned on a devel-
opment set.

2.3 Sentence-level model
Given the feature sets and optimized weights, we use
the Viterbi algorithm to find the best label sequence.
To estimate the confidence of a sentence S we rely on
the information from the forward-backward inference.
One approach is to directly use the conditional prob-
abilities of the whole sequence. However, this quan-
tity is the confidence measure for the label sequence
predicted by the classifier and it does not represent the
goodness of the whole MT output. Another more ap-
propriated method is to use the marginal probability of
Good label which can be defined as follow:

p(yi = Good|S) =
α(yi|S)β(yi|S)∑
j α(yj |S)β(yj |S)

(6)

p(yi = Good|S) is the marginal probability of label
Good at position i given the MT output sentence S.
α(yi|S) and β(yi|S) are forward and backward values.
Our confidence estimation for a sentence S of k words
is defined as follow

goodness(S) =

∑k
i=1 p(yi = Good|S)

k
(7)

goodness(S) is ranging between 0 and 1, where 0 is
equivalent to an absolutely wrong translation and 1
is a perfect translation. Essentially, goodness(S) is
the arithmetic mean which represents the goodness of
translation per word in the whole sentence.

3 Confidence Measure Features
Features are generated from feature types: abstract
templates from which specific features are instantiated.
Features sets are often parameterized in various ways.
In this section, we describe three new feature sets intro-
duced on top of our baseline classifier which has WPP
and target POS features (Ueffing and Ney, 2007; Xiong
et al., 2010).

3.1 Source-side features
From MT decoder log, we can track which source
phrases generate target phrases. Furthermore, one can
infer the alignment between source and target words
within the phrase pair using simple aligners such as
IBM Model-1 alignment.

Source phrase features: These features are designed
to capture the likelihood that source phrase and target
word co-occur with a given error label. The intuition
behind them is that if a large percentage of the source
phrase and target have often been seen together with the

same label, then the produced target word should have
this label in the future. Figure 1a illustrates this feature
template where the first line is source POS tags, the
second line is the Buckwalter romanized source Arabic
sequence, and the third line is MT output. The source
phrase feature is defined as follow

f102(process) =

{
1 if source-phrase=“hdhh alamlyt”
0 otherwise

Source POS: Source phrase features might be suscep-
tible to sparseness issues. We can generalize source
phrases based on their POS tags to reduce the number
of parameters. For example, the example in Figure 1a
is generalized as in Figure 1b and we have the follow-
ing feature:

f103(process) =

{
1 if source-POS=“ DT DTNN ”
0 otherwise

Source POS and phrase context features: This fea-
ture set allows us to look at the surrounding context
of the source phrase. For example, in Figure 1c we
have “hdhh alamlyt” generates “process”. We also
have other information such as on the right hand side
the next two phrases are “ayda” and “tshyr” or the se-
quence of source target POS on the right hand side is
“RB VBP”. An example of this type of feature is

f104(process) =

{
1 if source-POS-context=“ RB VBP ”
0 otherwise

3.2 Alignment context features
The IBM Model-1 feature performed relatively well in
comparison with the WPP feature as shown by Blatz et
al. (2004). In our work, we incorporate not only the213

IBM Model-1 feature but also the surrounding align-
ment context. The key intuition is that collocation is a
reliable indicator for judging if a target word is gener-
ated by a particular source word (Huang, 2009). More-
over, the IBM Model-1 feature was already used in sev-
eral steps of a translation system such as word align-
ment, phrase extraction and scoring. Also the impact of
this feature alone might fade away when the MT sys-
tem is scaled up.

We obtain word-to-word alignments by applying
IBM Model-1 to bilingual phrase pairs that generated
the MT output. The IBM Model-1 assumes one
target word can only be aligned to one source word.
Therefore, given a target word we can always identify
which source word it is aligned to.

Source alignment context feature: We anchor the
target word and derive context features surround-
ing its source word. For example, in Figure 2a
and 2b we have an alignment between “tshyr” and
“refers” The source contexts “tshyr” with a window
of one word are “ayda” to the left and “aly” to the right.

Target alignment context feature: Similar to source
alignment context features, we anchor the source word
and derive context features surrounding the aligned
target word. Figure 2c shows a left target context
feature of word “refers”. Our features are derived from
a window of four words.

Combining alignment context with POS tags: In-
stead of using lexical context we have features to look
at source and target POS alignment context. For in-
stance, the feature in Figure 2d is

f141(refers) =

{
1 if source-POS = “VBP”

and target-context = “to”
0 otherwise

3.3 Source and target dependency structure
features

The contextual and source information in the previous
sections only take into account surface structures of
source and target sentences. Meanwhile, dependency
structures have been extensively used in various
translation systems (Shen et al., 2008; Ma et al.,
2008; Bach et al., 2009). The adoption of dependency
structures might enable the classifier to utilize deep
structures to predict translation errors. Source and tar-
get structures are unlikely to be isomorphic as shown
in Figure 3a. However, we expect some high-level
linguistic structures are likely to transfer across certain
language pairs. For example, prepositional phrases
(PP) in Arabic and English are similar in a sense
that PPs generally appear at the end of the sentence
(after all the verbal arguments) and to a lesser extent
at its beginning (Habash and Hu, 2009). We use the
Stanford parser to obtain dependency trees and POS
tags (Marneffe et al., 2006).

Child-Father agreement: The motivation is to take
advantage of the long distance dependency relations
between source and target words. Given an alignment
between a source word si and a target word tj . A child-214



father agreement exists when sk is aligned to tl, where
sk and tl are father of si and tj in source and target
dependency trees, respectively. Figure 3b illustrates
that “tshyr” and “refers” have a child-father agreement.
To verify our intuition, we analysed 243K words of
manual aligned Arabic-English bitext. We observed
29.2% words having child-father agreements. In term
of structure types, we found 27.2% of copula verb
and 30.2% prepositional structures, including object
of a preposition, prepositional modifier, and preposi-
tional complement, are having child-father agreements.

Children agreement: In the child-father agreement
feature we look up in the dependency tree, however,
we also can look down to the dependency tree with a
similar motivation. Essentially, given an alignment be-
tween a source word si and a target word tj , how many
children of si and tj are aligned together? For exam-
ple, “tshyr” and “refers” have 2 aligned children which
are “ayda-also” and “aly-to” as shown in Figure 3c.

4 Experiments

4.1 Arabic-English translation system

The SMT engine is a phrase-based system similar to
the description in (Tillmann, 2006), where various
features are combined within a log-linear framework.
These features include source-to-target phrase transla-
tion score, source-to-target and target-to-source word-
to-word translation scores, language model score, dis-
tortion model scores and word count. The training
data for these features are 7M Arabic-English sentence
pairs, mostly newswire and UN corpora released by
LDC. The parallel sentences have word alignment au-
tomatically generated with HMM and MaxEnt word
aligner (Ge, 2004; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005).
Bilingual phrase translations are extracted from these
word-aligned parallel corpora. The language model is
a 5-gram model trained on roughly 3.5 billion English
words.

Our training data contains 72k sentences Arabic-
English machine translation with human corrections
which include of 2.2M words in newswire and weblog
domains. We have a development set of 2,707 sen-
tences, 80K words (dev); an unseen test set of 2,707
sentences, 79K words (test). Feature selection and pa-
rameter tuning has been done on the development set in
which we experimented values of C, n and iterations in
range of [0.5:10], [1:5], and [50:200] respectively. The
final MIRA classifier was trained by using pocket crf
toolkit1 with 100 iterations, hyper-parameter C was 5
and cut-off feature threshold n was 1.

We use precision (P ), recall (R) and F-score (F ) to
evaluate the classifier performance and they are com-

puted as follow:

P =
the number of correctly tagged labels

the number of tagged labels

R =
the number of correctly tagged labels

the number of reference labels

F = 2*P*RP+R

4.2 Contribution of feature sets
We designed our experiments to show the impact
of each feature separately as well as their cumu-
lative impact. We trained two types of classifiers
to predict the error type of each word in MT out-
put, namely Good/Bad with a binary classifier and
Good/Insertion/Substitution/Shift with a 4-class classi-
fier. Each classifier is trained with different feature sets
as follow:

• WPP: we reimplemented WPP calculation based
on n-best lists as described in (Ueffing and Ney,
2007).

• WPP + target POS: only WPP and target POS fea-
tures are used. This is a similar feature set used by
Xiong et al. (2010).

• Our features: the classifier has source side, align-
ment context, and dependency structure features;
WPP and target POS features are excluded.

• WPP + our features: adding our features on top of
WPP.

• WPP + target POS + our features: using all fea-
tures.

To evaluate the effectiveness of each feature set, we
apply them on two different baseline systems: using
WPP and WPP+target POS, respectively. We augment
each baseline with our feature sets separately. Ta-
ble 1 shows the contribution in F-score of our proposed
feature sets. Improvements are consistently obtained
when combining the proposed features with baseline
features. Experimental results also indicate that source-
side information, alignment context and dependency215

structures have unique and effective levers to improve
the classifier performance. Among the three proposed
feature sets, we observe the source side information
contributes the most gain, which is followed by the
alignment context and dependency structure features.

4.3 Performance of classifiers

We trained several classifiers with our proposed feature
sets as well as baseline features. We compare their per-
formances, including a naive baseline All-Good classi-
fier, in which all words in the MT output are labelled
as good translations. Figure 4 shows the performance
of different classifiers trained with different feature sets
on development and unseen test sets. On the unseen test
set our proposed features outperform WPP and target
POS features by 2.8 and 2.4 absolute F-score respec-
tively. Improvements of our features are consistent in
development and unseen sets as well as in binary and
4-class classifiers. We reach the best performance by
combining our proposed features with WPP and target
POS features. Experiments indicate that the gaps in F-
score between our best system with the naive All-Good
system is 12.9 and 6.8 in binary and 4-class cases, re-
spectively. Table 2 presents precision, recall, and F-
score of individual class of the best binary and 4-class
classifiers. It shows that Good label is better predicted
than other labels, meanwhile, Substitution is gener-
ally easier to predict than Insertion and Shift.

4.4 Correlation between Goodness and HTER

We estimate sentence level confidence score based
on Equation 7. Figure 5 illustrates the correla-
tion between our proposed goodness sentence level
confidence score and the human-targeted translation
edit rate (HTER). The Pearson correlation between
goodness and HTER is 0.6, while the correlation of
WPP and HTER is 0.52. This experiment shows that
goodness has a large correlation with HTER. The
black bar is the linear regression line. Blue and red

bars are thresholds used to visualize good and bad sen-
tences respectively. We also experimented goodness
computation in Equation 7 using geometric mean and
harmonic mean; their Pearson correlation values are 0.5
and 0.35 respectively.

5 Improving MT quality with N-best list
reranking

Experiments reporting in Section 4 indicate that the
proposed confidence measure has a high correlation
with HTER. However, it is not very clear if the core MT
system can benefit from confidence measure by provid-
ing better translations. To investigate this question we
present experimental results for the n-best list rerank-
ing task.

The MT system generates top n hypotheses and for
each hypothesis we compute sentence-level confidence
scores. The best candidate is the hypothesis with high-
est confidence score. Table 3 shows the performance of
reranking systems using goodness scores from our best
classifier in various n-best sizes. We obtained 0.7 TER
reduction and 0.4 BLEU point improvement on the de-
velopment set with a 5-best list. On the unseen test, we
obtained 0.6 TER reduction and 0.2 BLEU point im-
provement. Although, the improvement of BLEU score216

is not obvious, TER reductions are consistent in both
development and unseen sets. Figure 6 shows the im-
provement of reranking with goodness score. Besides,
the figure illustrates the upper and lower bound perfor-
mances with TER metric in which the lower bound is
our baseline system and the upper bound is the best hy-
pothesis in a given n-best list. Oracle scores of each n-
best list are computed by choosing the translation can-
didate with lowest TER score.

6 Visualizing translation errors
Besides the application of confidence score in the n-
best list reranking task, we propose a method to visual-
ize translation error using confidence scores. Our pur-
pose is to visualize word and sentence-level confidence
scores with the following objectives 1) easy for spotting
translations errors; 2) simple and intuitive; and 3) help-
ful for post-editing productivity. We define three cate-
gories of translation quality (good/bad/decent) on both
word and sentence level. On word level, the marginal
probability of good label is used to visualize translation
errors as follow:

Li =

 good if p(yi = Good|S) ≥ 0.8bad if p(yi = Good|S) ≤ 0.45
decent otherwise

Table 4: Choices of layout

Different font sizes and colors are used to catch the
attention of post-editors whenever translation errors are
likely to appear as shown in Table 4. Colors are ap-
plied on word level, while font size is applied on both
word and sentence level. The idea of using font size
and colour to visualize translation confidence is simi-
lar to the idea of using tag/word cloud to describe the
content of websites2. The reason we are using big font
size and red color is to attract post-editors’ attention
and help them find translation errors quickly. Figure 7
shows an example of visualizing confidence scores by
font size and colours. It shows that “not to deprive
yourself ”, displayed in big font and red color, is likely
to be bad translations. Meanwhile, other words, such
as “you”, “different”, “from”, and “assimilation”, dis-
played in small font and black color, are likely to be
good translation. Medium font and orange color words
are decent translations.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we proposed a method to predict con-
fidence scores for machine translated words and sen-
tences based on a feature-rich classifier using linguistic
and context features. Our major contributions are three
novel feature sets including source side information,
alignment context, and dependency structures. Experi-
mental results show that by combining the source side
information, alignment context, and dependency struc-
ture features with word posterior probability and tar-
get POS context (Ueffing & Ney 2007; Xiong et al.,
2010), the MT error prediction accuracy is increased
from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score. Our framework is able to
predict error types namely insertion, substitution and
shift. The Pearson correlation with human judgement
increases from 0.52 to 0.6. Furthermore, we show that
the proposed confidence scores can help the MT sys-
tem to select better translations and as a result improve-
ments between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are obtained.
Finally, we demonstrate a prototype to visualize trans-
lation errors.

This work can be expanded in several directions.
First, we plan to apply confidence estimation to per-
form a second-pass constraint decoding. After the first
pass decoding, our confidence estimation model can la-
bel which word is likely to be correctly translated. The
second-pass decoding utilizes the confidence informa-

tion to constrain the search space and hopefully can
find a better hypothesis than in the first pass. This idea
is very similar to the multi-pass decoding strategy em-
ployed by speech recognition engines. Moreover, we
also intend to perform a user study on our visualiza-
tion prototype to see if it increases the productivity of
post-editors.
