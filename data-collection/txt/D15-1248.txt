Abstract

When translating between two languages
that differ in their degree of morpholog-
ical synthesis, syntactic structures in one
language may be realized as morphologi-
cal structures in the other, and SMT mod-
els need a mechanism to learn such trans-
lations. Prior work has used morpheme
splitting with flat representations that do
not encode the hierarchical structure be-
tween morphemes, but this structure is rel-
evant for learning morphosyntactic con-
straints and selectional preferences. We
propose to model syntactic and morpho-
logical structure jointly in a dependency
translation model, allowing the system
to generalize to the level of morphemes.
We present a dependency representation
of German compounds and particle verbs
that results in improvements in transla-
tion quality of 1.4–1.8 BLEU in the WMT
English–German translation task.

1 Introduction

When translating between two languages that dif-
fer in their degree of morphological synthesis,
syntactic structures in one language may be re-
alized as morphological structures in the other.
Machine Translation models that treat words as
atomic units have poor learning capabilities for
such translation units, and morphological segmen-
tations are commonly used (Koehn and Knight,
2003). Like words in a sentence, the morphemes
of a word have a hierarchical structure that is rel-
evant in translation. For instance, compounds in
Germanic languages are head-final, and the head is
the segment that determines agreement within the
noun phrase, and is relevant for selectional prefer-
ences of verbs.

they charge a carry-on bag fee.

In example 1, agreement in case, number and
gender is enforced between eine ’a’ and Gebühr
’fee’, and selectional preference between erheben
’charge’ and Gebühr ’fee’. A flat representation,
as is common in phrase-based SMT, does not en-
code these relationships, but a dependency repre-
sentation does so through dependency links.

In this paper, we investigate a dependency rep-
resentation of morphologically segmented words
for SMT. Our representation encodes syntactic and
morphological structure jointly, allowing a single
model to learn the translation of both. Specifi-
cally, we work with a string-to-tree model with
GHKM-style rules (Galley et al., 2006), and a
relational dependency language model (Sennrich,
2015). We focus on the representation of German
syntax and morphology in an English-to-German
system, and two morphologically complex word
classes in German that are challenging for transla-
tion, compounds and particle verbs.

German makes heavy use of compounding, and
compounds such as Abwasserbehandlungsanlage
‘waste water treatment plant’ are translated into
complex noun phrases in other languages, such as
French station d’épuration des eaux résiduaires.

German particle verbs are difficult to model be-
cause their surface realization differs depending
on the finiteness of the verb and the type of clause.
Verb particles are separated from the finite verb in

2081



main clauses, but prefixed to the verb in subordi-
nated clauses, or when the verb is non-finite. The
infinitive marker zu ’to’, which is normally a pre-
modifying particle, appears as an infix in particle
verbs. Table 1 shows an illustrating example.

2 A Dependency Representation of
Compounds and Particle Verbs

The main focus of research on compound split-
ting has been on the splitting algorithm (Popovic
et al., 2006; Nießen and Ney, 2000; Weller et al.,
2014; Macherey et al., 2011). Our focus is not the
splitting algorithm, but the representation of com-
pounds. For splitting, we use an approach simi-
lar to (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), with segmen-
tation candidates identified by a finite-state mor-
phology (Schmid et al., 2004; Sennrich and Kunz,
2014), and statistical evidence from the training
corpus to select a split (Koehn and Knight, 2003).

German compounds are head-final, and pre-
modifiers can be added recursively. Compounds
are structurally ambiguous if there is more than
one modifier. Consider the distinction between
(Stadtteil)projekt (literally: ’(city part) project)’)
and Stadt(teilprojekt) ’city sub-project’. We opt
for a left-branching representation by default.1 We
also split linking elements, and represent them as
a postmodifier of each non-final segment, includ-
ing the empty string ("�"). We use the same repre-
sentation for noun compounds and adjective com-
pounds.

An example of the original2 and the proposed
compound representation is shown in Figure 1.
Importantly, the head of the compound is also
the parent of the determiners and attributes in
the noun phrase, which makes a bigram depen-
dency language model sufficient to enforce agree-
ment. Since we model morphosyntactic agree-
ment within the main translation step, and not in
a separate step as in (Fraser et al., 2012), we deem
it useful that inflection is marked at the head of
the compound. Consequently, we do not split off
inflectional or derivational morphemes.

For German particle verbs, we define a common
representation that abstracts away from the vari-
ous surface realizations (see Table 1). Separated

1We follow prior work in leaving frequent words or sub-
words unsplit, which has a disambiguating effect. With more
aggressive splitting, frequency information could be used for
the structural disambiguation of internal structure.

2The original dependency trees follow the annotation
guidelines by Foth (2005).

Figure 2: Original and proposed representation of
German particle verb with infixed zu-marker.

verb particles are reordered to be the closest pre-
modifier of the verb. Prefixed particles and the zu-
infix are identified by the finite-state-morphology,
and split from the verb so that the particle is
the closest, the zu marker the next-closest pre-
modifier of the verb, as shown in Figure 2. Agree-
ment, selectional preferences, and other phenom-
ena involve the verb and its dependents, and the
proposed representation retains these dependency
links, but reduces data sparsity from affixation and
avoids discontinuity of the verb and its particle.

3 Tree Binarization

We follow Williams et al. (2014) and map de-
pendency trees into a constituency representation,
which allows for the extraction of GHKM-style
translation rules (Galley et al., 2006). This con-
version is lossless, and we can still apply a de-

2082



pendency language model (RDLM). Figure 3 (a)
shows the constituency representation of the ex-
ample in Figure 1.

Our model should not only be able to produce
new words productively, but also to memorize
words it has observed during training. Looking at
the compound Handgepäckgebühr in Figure 3 (a),
we can see that it does not form a constituent, and
cannot be extracted with GHKM extraction heuris-
tics. To address this, we binarize the trees in our
training data (Wang et al., 2007).

A complicating factor is that the binarization
should not impair the RDLM. During decoding,
we map the internal tree structure of each hypoth-
esis back to the unbinarized form, which is then
scored by the RDLM. Virtual nodes introduced by
the binarization must also be scorable by RDLM
if they form the root of a translation hypothesis. A
simple right or left binarization would produce vir-
tual nodes without head and without meaningful
dependency representation. We ensure that each
virtual node dominates the head of the full con-
stituent through a mixed binarization.3 Specifi-
cally, we perform right binarization of the head
and all pre-modifiers, then left binarization of all
post-modifiers. This head-binarized representa-
tion is illustrated in Figure 3 (b).4

Head binarization ensures that even hypotheses
whose root is a virtual node can be scored by the
RDLM. This score is only relevant for pruning,
and discarded when the full constituent is scored.
Still, these hypotheses require special treatment in
the RDLM to mitigate search errors. The virtual
node labels (such as OBJA) are unknown symbols
to the RDLM, and we simply replace them with
the original label (OBJA). The RDLM uses sibling
context, and this is normally padded with special
start and stop symbols, analogous to BOS/EOS
symbols in n-gram models. These start and stop
symbols let the RDLM compute the probability
that a node is the first or last child of its ances-
tor node. However, computing these probabilities
for virtual nodes would unfairly bias the search,
since the first/last child of a virtual node is not nec-
essarily the first/last child of the full constituent.
We adapt the representation of virtual nodes in

3In other words, every node is a fixed well-formed depen-
dency structure (Shen et al., 2010) with our binarization.

4Note that our definition of head binarization is different
from that of Wang et al. (2007), who left-binarize a node if
the head is the first child, and right-binarize otherwise. Our
algorithm also covers cases where the head has both pre- and
post-modifiers, as erheben and gepäck do in Figure 3.

RDLM to take this into account. We distinguish
between virtual nodes based on whether their span
is a string prefix, suffix, or infix of the full con-
stituent. For prefixes and infixes, we do not add
a stop symbol at the end, and use null symbols,
which denote unavailable context, for padding to
the right. For suffixes and infixes, we do the same
at the start.

4 Post-Processing

For SMT, all German training and development
data is converted into the representation described
in sections 2–3. To restore the original represen-
tation, we start from the tree output of the string-
to-tree decoder. Merging compounds is trivial: all
segments and linking elements can be identified by
the tree structure, and are concatenated.

For verbs that dominate a verb particle, the orig-
inal order is restored through three rules:

1. non-finite verbs are concatenated with the
particle, and zu-markers are infixed.

2. finite verbs that head a subordinated clause
(identified by its dependency label) are con-
catenated with the particle.

3. finite verbs that head a main clause have the

2083



particle moved to the right clause bracket.5

Previous work on particle verb translation into
German proposed to predict the position of parti-
cles with an n-gram language model (Nießen and
Ney, 2001). Our rules have the advantage that they
are informed by the syntax of the sentence and
consider the finiteness of the verb.

Our rules only produce projective trees. Verb
particles may also appear in positions that violate
projectivity, and we leave it to future research to
determine if our limitation to projective trees af-
fects translation quality, and how to produce non-
projective trees.

5 SMT experiments

5.1 Data and Models

We train English–German string-to-tree SMT sys-
tems on the training data of the shared transla-
tion task of the Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT) 2015. The data set consists of
4.2 million sentence pairs of parallel data, and 160
million sentences of monolingual German data.

We base our systems on that of Williams et
al. (2014). It is a string-to-tree GHKM transla-
tion system implemented in Moses (Koehn et al.,
2007), and using the dependency annotation by
ParZu (Sennrich et al., 2013). Additionally, our
baseline system contains a dependency language
model (RDLM) (Sennrich, 2015), trained on the
target-side of the parallel training data.

We report case-sensitive BLEU scores on the
newstest2014/5 test sets from WMT, averaged
over 3 optimization runs of k-batch MIRA (Cherry
and Foster, 2012) on a subset of newstest2008-12.6

We split all particle verbs and hyphenated com-
pounds, but other compounds are only split if they
are rare (frequency in parallel text < 5).

For comparison with the state-of-the-art, we
train a full system on our restructured representa-
tion, which incorporates all models and settings of
our WMT 2015 submission system (Williams et
al., 2015).7 Note that our WMT 2015 submission

5We use the last position in the clause as default location,
but put the particle before any subordinated and coordinated
clauses, which occur in the Nachfeld (the ‘final field’ in topo-
logical field theory).

6We use mteval-v13a.pl for comparability to official
WMT results; all significance values reported are obtained
with MultEval (Clark et al., 2011).

7In contrast to our other systems in this paper, RDLM is
trained on all monolingual data for the full system, and two
models are added: a 5-gram Neural Network language model

uses the dependency representation of compounds
and tree binarization introduced in this paper; we
achieve additional gains over the submission sys-
tem through particle verb restructuring.

5.2 SMT Results

Table 2 shows translation quality (BLEU) with dif-
ferent representations of German compounds and
particle verbs. Head binarization not only yields
improvements over the baseline, but also allows
for larger gains from morphological segmenta-
tion. We attribute this to the fact that full com-
pounds, and prefixed particle verbs, are not al-
ways a constituent in the segmented representa-
tion, and that binarization compensates this the-
oretical drawback.

With head binarization, we find substantial im-
provements from compound splitting of 0.7–1.1
BLEU. On newstest2014, the improvement is
almost twice of that reported in related work
(Williams et al., 2014), which also uses a hier-
archical representation of compounds, albeit one
that does not allow for dependency modelling.
Examples of correct, unseen compounds gener-
ated include Staubsauger|roboter ’vacuum cleaner
robot’, Gravitation|s|wellen ’gravitational waves’,
and NPD|-|verbot|s|verfahren ’NPD banning pro-
cess’.8

(Vaswani et al., 2013), and soft source-syntactic constraints
(Huck et al., 2014).

8Note that Staubsauger, despite being a compound, is not

2084



Particle verb restructuring yields additional
gains of 0.1–0.4 BLEU. One reason for the smaller
effect of particle verb restructuring is that the diffi-
cult cases – separated particle verbs and those with
infixation – are rarer than compounds, with 2841
rare compounds [that would be split by our com-
pound splitter] in the reference texts, in contrast
to 553 separated particle verbs, and 176 particle
verbs with infixation, as Table 3 illustrates. If we
only evaluate the sentences containing a particle
verb with zu-infix in the reference, 165 in total
for newstest2014/5, we observe an improvement
of 0.8 BLEU on this subset (22.1→22.9), signifi-
cant with p < 0.05.

The positive effect of restructuring is also ap-
parent in frequency statistics. Table 3 shows that
the baseline system severely undergenerates com-
pounds and separated/infixed particle verbs. Bi-
narization, compound splitting, and particle verb
restructuring all contribute to bringing the distri-
bution of compounds and particle verbs closer to
the reference.

In total, the restructured representation yields
improvements of 1.4–1.8 BLEU over our base-
line. The full system is competitive with official
submissions to the WMT 2015 shared translation
tasks. It outperforms our submission (Williams
et al., 2015) by 0.4 BLEU, and outperforms other
phrase-based and syntax-based submissions by 0.8
BLEU or more. The best reported result accord-
ing to BLEU is an ensemble of Neural MT systems
(Jean et al., 2015), which achieves 24.9 BLEU. In
the human evaluation, both our submission and the
Neural MT system were ranked 1–2 (out of 16),
with no significant difference between them.

5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment

We perform a synthetic experiment to test our
claim that a dependency representation allows for
the modelling of agreement between morphemes.
For 200 rare compounds [that would be split by
our compound splitter] in the newstest2014/5 ref-
erences, we artificially introduce agreement errors
by changing the gender of the determiner. For in-
stance, we create the erroneous sentence sie er-
heben ein Handgepäckgebühr as a complement to
Example 1. We measure the ability of language
models to prefer (give a higher probability to)
the original reference sentence over the erroneous
one. In the original representation, both a Kneser-

segmented due to its frequency.

Ney 5-gram LM and RDLM perform poorly due to
data sparseness, with 70% and 57.5% accuracy, re-
spectively. In the split representation, the RDLM
reliably prefers the correct agreement (96.5% ac-
curacy), whilst the performance of the 5-gram
model even deteriorates (to 60% accuracy). This
is because the gender of the first segment(s) is ir-
relevant, or even misleading, for agreement. For
instance, Handgepäck is neuter, which could lead
a morpheme-level n-gram model to prefer the de-
terminer ein, but Handgepäckgebühr is feminine
and requires eine.

6 Conclusion

Our main contribution is that we exploit the hi-
erarchical structure of morphemes to model them
jointly with syntax in a dependency-based string-
to-tree SMT model. We describe the dependency
annotation of two morphologically complex word
classes in German, compounds and particle verbs,
and show that our tree representation yields im-
provements in translation quality of 1.4–1.8 BLEU
in the WMT English–German translation task.9

The principle of jointly representing syntactic
and morphological structure in dependency trees
can be applied to other language pairs, and we ex-
pect this to be helpful for languages with a high
degree of morphological synthesis. However, the
annotation needs to be adapted to the respective
languages. For example, French compounds such
as arc-en-ciel ’rainbow’ are head-initial, in con-
trast to head-final Germanic compounds.
