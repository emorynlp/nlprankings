Abstract

In this paper we propose a method to
increase dependency parser performance
without using additional labeled or unla-
beled data by refining the layer of pre-
dicted part-of-speech (POS) tags. We per-
form experiments on English and Ger-
man and show significant improvements
for both languages. The refinement is
based on generative split-merge training
for Hidden Markov models (HMMs).

1 Introduction

Probabilistic Context-free Grammars with latent
annotations (PCFG-LA) have been shown (Petrov
et al., 2006) to yield phrase structure parsers
with state-of-the-art accuracy. While Hidden
Markov Models with latent annotations (HMM-
LA) (Huang et al., 2009), stay somewhat behind
the performance of state-of-the-art discriminative
taggers (Eidelman et al., 2010). In this paper we
address the question of whether the resulting la-
tent POS tags are linguistically meaningful and
useful for upstream tasks such as syntactic pars-
ing. We find that this is indeed the case, lead-
ing to a procedure that significantly increases the
performance of dependency parsers. The proce-
dure is attractive because the refinement of pre-
dicted part-of-speech sequences using a coarse-to-
fine strategy (Petrov and Klein, 2007) is fast and
efficient. More precisely, we show that incorpo-
rating the induced POS into a state-of-the-art de-
pendency parser (Bohnet, 2010) gives increases in
Labeled Attachment Score (LAS): from 90.34 to
90.57 for English and from 87.92 to 88.24 (resp.
88.35 to 88.51) for German without using (resp.
with using) morphological features.

2 Related Work

Petrov et al. (2006) introduce generative split-
merge training for PCFGs and provide a fully au-
tomatic method for training state-of-the-art phrase
structure parsers. They argue that the resulting la-
tent annotations are linguistically meaningful. Sun
et al. (2008) induce latent sub-states into CRFs and
show that noun phrase (NP) recognition can be im-
proved, especially if no part-of-speech features are
available. Huang et al. (2009) apply split-merge
training to create HMMs with latent annotations
(HMM-LA) for Chinese POS tagging. They re-
port that the method outperforms standard gener-
ative bigram and trigram tagging, but do not com-
pare to discriminative methods. Eidelman et al.
(2010) show that a bidirectional variant of latent
HMMs with incorporation of prosodic information
can yield state-of-the-art results in POS tagging of
conversational speech.

3 Split-Merge Training for HMMs

Split-merge training for HMMs (Huang et al.,
2009) iteratively splits every tag into two subtags.
Word emission and tag transition probabilities of
subtags are then initialized close to the values of
the parent tags but with some randomness to break
symmetry. Using expectation–maximization (EM)
training the parameters can then be set to a local
maximum of the training data likelihood. After
this split phase, the merge phase reverts splits that
only lead to small improvements in the likelihood
function in order to increase the robustness of the
model. This approach requires an approximation
of the gain in likelihood of every split analogous
to Petrov et al. (2006) as an exact computation is
not feasible.

We have observed that this procedure is not

only a way to increase HMM tagger performance
but also yields annotations that are to a consid-
erable extent linguistically interpretable. As an
example we discuss some splits that occurred af-
ter a particular split-merge step for English and
German. For the sake of comparability we ap-
plied the split to the Universal Tagset (Petrov et
al., 2011). Table 1 shows the statistics used for
this analysis. The Universal POS tag set puts the
three Penn-Treebank tags RP (particle), POS (pos-
sessive marker) and TO into one particle tag (see
“PRT” in English part of the table). The training
essentially reverses this by splitting particles first
into possessive and non-possessive markers and in
a subsequent split the non-possessives into TO and
particles. For German we have a similar split into
verb particles, negation particles like nicht ‘not’
and the infinitive marker zu ‘to’ (“PRT”) in the
German part of the table). English prepositions
get split by proximity to verbs or nouns (“ADP”).
Subordinate conjunctions like that, which in the
Penn-Treebank annotation are part of the prepo-
sition tag IN, get assigned to the sub-class next
to verbs. For German we also see a separation
of “CONJ” into predominantly subordinate con-
junctions (Tag 0) and predominantly coordinating
conjunctions (Tag 1). For both languages adjec-
tives get split by predicative and attributive use.
For English the predicative sub-class also seems
to hold rather atypical adjectives like “such” and
“last.” For English, verbs (“VERB”) get split into
a predominantly infinite tag (Tag 0) and a predom-
inantly finite tag (Tag 1) while for German we get
a separation by verb position. In German we get a

separation of pronouns (“PRON”) into possessive
and non-possessive; in English, pronouns get split
by predominant usage in subject position (Tag 0)
and as possessives (Tag 1).

Our implementation of HMM-LA has been re-
leased under an open-source licence.1

In the next section we evaluate the utility of
these annotations for dependency parsing.

4 Dependency Parsing

In this section we investigate the utility of in-
duced POS as features for dependency parsing.
We run our experiments on the CoNLL-2009 data
sets (Hajič et al., 2009) for English and German.
As a baseline system we use the latest version
of the mate-tools parser (Bohnet, 2010).3 It was
the highest scoring syntactic parser for German
and English in the CoNLL 2009 shared task eval-
uation. The parser gets automatically annotated
lemmas, POS and morphological features as input
which are part of the CoNLL-2009 data sets.

In this experiment we want to examine the ben-
efits of tag refinements isolated from the improve-
ments caused by using two taggers in parallel,
thus we train the HMM-LA on the automatically
tagged POS sequences of the training set and use
it to add an additional layer of refined POS to the
input data of the parser. We do this by calculating
the forward-backward charts that are also used in
the E-steps during training — in these charts base

tags of the refined tags are constrained to be iden-
tical to the automatically predicted tags.

We use 100 EM iterations after each split and
merge phase. The percentage of splits reverted in
each merge phase is set to .75.

We integrate the tags by adding one additional
feature for every edge: the conjunction of latent
tags of the two words connected by the edge.

Table 2 shows results of our experiments. All
numbers are averages of five independent runs.
For English the smaller models with 58 and 73
tags achieve improvements of ≈.1. The improve-
ments for the larger tag sets are ≈.2. The best
individual model improves LAS by .3. For the
German experiments without morphological fea-
tures we get only marginal average improvements
for the smallest tag set and improvements of ≈.15
for the bigger tag sets. The average ULA scores
for 107 and 134 tags are at the same level as the
ULA scores of the baseline with morph. features.
The best model improves LAS by .3. For German
with morphological features the absolute differ-
ences are smaller: The smallest tag set does not
improve the parser on average. For the tag set
of 107 tags the average improvement is .08. The
best model improves LAS by .38. In all experi-
ments we see the highest improvements for tag set
sizes of roughly the same size (115 for English,
107 for German). While average improvements
are low (esp. for German with morphological fea-
tures), peak improvements are substantial.

Running the best English system on the test set
gives an improvement in LAS from 90.34 to 90.57;
this improvement is significant4 (p < .02). For
German we get an improvement from 87.92 to

4Approx. randomization test (Yeh, 2000) on LAS scores

88.24 without and from 88.35 to 88.51 with mor-
phological features. The difference between the
values without morphological features is signifi-
cant (p < .05), but the difference between mod-
els with morphological features is not (p = .26).
However, the difference between the baseline sys-
tem with morphological features and the best sys-
tem without morphological features is also not sig-
nificant (p = .49).

We can conclude that HMM-LA tags can sig-
nificantly improve parsing results. For German we
see that HMM-LA tags can substitute morpholog-
ical features up to an insignificant difference. We
also see that morphological features and HMM-
LA seem to be correlated as combining the two
gives only insignificant improvements.

5 Contribution Analysis

In this section we try to find statistical evidence
for why a parser using a fine-grained tag set might
outperform a parser based on treebank tags only.

The results indicate that an induced latent tag
set as a whole increases parsing performance.
However, not every split made by the HMM-LA
seems to be useful for the parser. The scatter plots
in Figure 1 show that there is no strict correlation
between tagging accuracy of a model and the re-
sulting LAS. This is expected as the latent induc-
tion optimizes a tagging objective function, which
does not directly translate into better parsing per-
formance. An example is lexicalization. Most
latent models for English create a subtag for the
preposition “of”. This is useful for a HMM as “of”
is frequent and has a very specific context. A lexi-
calized syntactic parser, however, does not benefit
from such a tag.

Figure 1: Scatter plots of LAS vs tagging accuracy for English (left) and German without (middle) and
with (right) morphological features. English tag set sizes are 58 (squares), 73 (diamonds), 92 (trian-
gles), 115 (triangles pointing downwards) and 144 (circles). German tag set sizes are 85 (squares), 107
(diamonds) and 134 (triangles). The dashed lines indicate the baselines.

We base the remainder of our analysis on the
results of the baseline parser on the English devel-
opment set and the results of the best performing
latent model. The best performing model has a
LAS score of 88.73 vs 88.43 for the baseline, a dif-
ference of .3. If we just look at the LAS of words
with incorrectly predicted POS we see a difference
of 1.49. A look at the data shows that the latent
model helps the parser to identify words that might
have been annotated incorrectly. As an example
consider plural nouns (NNS) and two of their la-
tent subtags NNS1 and NNS2 and how often they
get classified correctly and misclassified as proper
nouns (NNPS):

NNS NNPS
NNS 2019 104
NNS1 90 72
NNS2 1100 13
. . . . . . . . .

We see that NNS1 is roughly equally likely to
be a NNPS or NNS while NNS2 gives much more
confidence of the actual POS being NNS. So one
benefit of HMM-LA POS tag sets are tags of dif-
ferent levels of confidence.

Another positive effect is that latent POS tags
have a higher correlation with certain dependency
relations. Consider proper nouns (NNP):

NAME NMOD SBJ
NNP 962 662 468
NNP1 10 27 206
NNP2 24 50 137
. . . . . . . . . . . .

We see that NNP1 and NNP2 are more likely
to appear in subject relations. NNP1 contains sur-
names; the most frequent word forms are Keating,
Papandreou and Kaye. In contrast, NNP2 con-

tains company names such as Sony, NBC and Key-
stone. This explains why the difference in LAS is
twice as high for NNPs as on average.

For German we see similar effects and the an-
ticipated correlation with morphology. The 5 de-
terminer subtags, for example, strongly correlate
with grammatical case:

Nom Gen Dat Acc
ART 1185 636 756 961
ART1 367 7 38
ART2 11 28 682 21
ART3 6 602 7 3
ART4 39 43 429
ART5 762 6 17 470

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We have shown that HMMs with latent anno-
tations (HMMLA) can generate latent part-of-
speech tagsets are linguistically interpretable and
can be used to improve dependency parsing. Our
best systems improve an English parser from a
LAS of 90.34 to 90.57 and a German parser from
87.92 to 88.24 when not using morphological fea-
tures and from 88.35 to 88.51 when using mor-
phological features . Our analysis of the parsing
results shows that the major reasons for the im-
provements are: the separation of POS tags into
more and less trustworthy subtags, the creation of
POS subtags with higher correlation to certain de-
pendency labels and for German a correlation of
tags and morphological features such as case.

7 Future Work

The procedure works well in general. However,
not every split is useful for the parser; e.g., as

discussed above lexicalization increases HMM ac-
curacy, but does not help an already lexicalized
parser. We would like to use additional informa-
tion (e.g., from the dependency trees) to identify
useless splits. The different granularities of the hi-
erarchy induced by split-merge training are poten-
tially useful. However, the levels of the hierarchy
are incomparable: a child tag is in general not a
subtag of a parent tag. We think that coupling par-
ents and children in the tag hierarchy might be one
way to force a consistent hierarchy.
