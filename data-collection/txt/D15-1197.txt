Abstract

Machine comprehension of text is the
overarching goal of a great deal of re-
search in natural language processing. The
Machine Comprehension Test (Richard-
son et al., 2013) was recently proposed to
assess methods on an open-domain, exten-
sible, and easy-to-evaluate task consisting
of two datasets. In this paper we develop
a lexical matching method that takes into
account multiple context windows, ques-
tion types and coreference resolution. We
show that the proposed method outper-
forms the baseline of Richardson et al.
(2013), and despite its relative simplicity,
is comparable to recent work using ma-
chine learning. We hope that our approach
will inform future work on this task. Fur-
thermore, we argue that MC500 is harder
than MC160 due to the way question an-
swer pairs were created.

1 Introduction

Machine comprehension of text is the central goal
in NLP. The academic community has proposed
a variety of tasks, such as information extrac-
tion (Sarawagi, 2008), semantic parsing (Mooney,
2007) and textual entailment (Androutsopoulos
and Malakasiotis, 2010). However, these tasks as-
sess performance on each task individually, rather
than on overall progress towards machine compre-
hension of text.

To this end, Richardson et al. (2013) proposed
the Machine Comprehension Test (MCTest), a
new challenge that aims at evaluating machine
comprehension. It does so through an open-
domain multiple-choice question answering task
on fictional stories requiring the common sense
reasoning typical of a 7-year-old child. It is easy
to evaluate as it consists of multiple choice ques-
tions. Richardson et al. (2013) also showed how

the creation of stories and questions can be crowd-
sourced efficiently, constructing two datasets for
the task, namely MC160 and MC500. In ad-
dition, the authors presented a lexical matching
baseline which is combined with the textual en-
tailment recognition system BIUTEE (Stern and
Dagan, 2011).

In this paper we develop an approach based on
lexical matching which we extend by taking into
account the type of the question and coreference
resolution. These components improve the per-
formance on questions that are difficult to han-
dle with pure lexical matching. When combined
with BIUTEE, we achieved 74.27% accuracy on
MC160 and 65.96% on MC500, which are signif-
icantly better than those reported by Richardson
et al. (2013). Despite the simplicity of our ap-
proach, these results are comparable with the re-
cent machine learning-based approaches proposed
by Narasimhan and Barzilay (2015), Wang et al.
(2015) and Sachan et al. (2015).

Furthermore, we examine the types of questions
and answers in the two datasets. We argue that
some types are relatively simple to answer, partly
due to the limited vocabulary used, which explains
why simple lexical matching methods can per-
form well. On the other hand, some questions re-
quire understanding of higher level concepts such
as those of the story and its characters, and/or re-
quire inference. This is still beyond the scope of
current NLP systems. However, we believe our
analysis will be useful in developing new methods
and datasets for the task. To that extent, we will
make our code and analysis publicly available.1

It was a terrible day to live in the zoo again for Pauly. It
wasn’t a terrible day for Zip, the monkey next to him,
or Garth, the giraffe down the sidewalk, or Pat, the
alligator in the pond, or for Bam the prairie dog, but it
was a terrible day in the monkey cage for Pauly. Pauly
didn’t feel he belonged in the monkey cage because
he wasn’t a monkey. He was a sailor who had visited
the zoo on vacation and fallen asleep on a bench right
before closing time. The zoo worker saw how hairy
he was and thought he was a monkey that had escaped
from his cage, so they put him in a cage.

two datasets contain 160 and 500 stories respec-
tively, with 4 questions per story, and 4 candi-
date answers per question (Figure 1). All stories
and questions were crowd-sourced using Amazon
Mechanical Turk.2 MC160 was manually curated
by Richardson et al., while MC500 was curated
by crowdworkers. Both datasets are divided into
training, development, and test sets. All develop-
ment was conducted on the training and develop-
ment sets; the test sets were used only to report the
final results.

3 Scoring function

Richardson et al. (2013) proposed a sliding win-
dow algorithm that ranks the answers by form-
ing the bag-of-words vector of each answer paired
with the question text and then scoring them ac-
cording to their overlap with the story text. We
propose a modified version of this algorithm,
which combines the scores across a range of win-
dow sizes.

More concretely, the algorithm of Richardson et
al. (2013) passes a sliding window over the story,
size of which is equal to the number of words
in the question-answer pair. The highest over-
lap score between a story text window and the
question-answer pair is taken as the score for the

2http://www.mturk.com

answer. Therefore, their algorithm makes a single
pass over the story text per answer. In compar-
ison, our system scores each answer by making
multiple passes and summing the obtained scores.
Concretely, on the first pass, we set the sliding
window size to 2 tokens, and increment this size
on each subsequent pass, up to a length of 30 to-
kens. We then combine this score with the over-
all number of matches of the question-answer pair
across the story as a whole. This enables our algo-
rithm to catch long-distance relations in the story.
Similar to Richardson et al. (2013), we use a lin-
ear combination of this score with their distance-
based scoring function, and we weigh tokens with
their inverse document frequencies in each indi-
vidual story.

By itself, this simple enhancement gives sub-
stantial improvements over the MSR baseline as
shown in Table 1 (Enhanced SW+D), as it mea-
sures the overlap of the question-answer pair with
multiple portions of the story text.

4 Incorporating linguistic analyses

We build upon our enhanced scoring function us-
ing stemming, rules taking into account the type of
the question, and coreference. The improvements
due to each of these components are presented in
Table 1, and we discuss the application of corefer-
ence and the rules used in more detail in the fol-
lowing subsections.

train and dev sets.

4.1 Coreference resolution

The entities mentioned in MCTest stories are
frequently referred to by anaphoric expressions
throughout the story and the questions, which
is ignored by the described scoring function.
Therefore, we substituted each mention in a co-
reference chain with its representative mention,
applied the scoring function on the processed text

1694



and added the score to the original one. The
chains and their represenatative mentions were ob-
tained using the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit (Man-
ning et al., 2014). We found that coreference im-
proved performance on some question types, but
decreased performance on others. Thus we devel-
oped a set of question rules in order to apply it
selectively, which we discuss in the next section.

4.2 Rules

Figure 2: Dependency tree to detect negation

To account for the variety of questions in
MCTest, we developed a set of rules to handle cer-
tain question types differently. To this purpose,
we created rules which detect numerical, tempo-
ral, narrative and negation-based questions, and
additionally partition questions by their wh-word.

By partitioning questions in different types, we
found that who questions, which primarily deal
with identifying a character in the story, benefit
from the use of coreference chains described in
the previous section. In addition, performance in
questions aimed at selecting an appropriate noun,
such as which, where or numerical questions, also
improved with coreference. However, other ques-
tion types, such as why questions, or questions
concerning the story narrative, did not register any
consistent improvement, and we opted not to use
co-reference for them. This selective application
of co-reference resulted in improvements on both
datasets (Table 1).

We also identified negation questions as requir-
ing special treatment. Some negation questions
are trivially solvable by selecting an answer which
does not appear in the text. However, our proposed
function that scores answers according to the lexi-
cal overlap with the story text is unlikely to score
answers not appearing in text highly. Motivated by
this observation we invert the score of each word
when a question with a negated root verb was de-
tected, e.g. “What did James not eat for dinner?”,
using Stanford Typed Dependencies (De Marneffe
and Manning, 2008), as depicted in Figure 2. Due
to this inversion a higher lexical overlap results in

a lower score, improving accuracy on both MC160
and MC500 (+negation in Table 1)

In a similar fashion we detected numerical ques-
tions based on the presence of a POS tag for a
cardinal number in either the question or any of
the answers choices. Questions concerning the
story’s narrative (e.g. “Which is the first char-
acter mentioned in the story”) were detected us-
ing keywords (e.g. character, book, etc.). Addi-
tionally, we detected temporal questions such as
“What did Jane do before she went home?” by
the presence of a temporal modifier or temporal
prepositions (e.g. before, while, etc.). Then we
attempted to account for them by searching the
text for the sentence indicating that she had gone
home and reducing the weight for all subsequent
sentences. However, since the improvements due
to these rules were negligible, we did not include
them in our final system. Nevertheless, these rules
were helpful in analyzing problem areas in the
datasets, as discussed in Section 6.

5 Results

We evaluated our system on MC160 and MC500
test sets and the results are shown in Table 2.
Our proposed baseline outperforms the baseline
of Richardson et al. (2013) by 4 and 3 points
in accuracy on MC160 and MC500 respectively.3

Our system is comparable to the MSR baseline
with the RTE system BIUTEE (Stern and Dagan,
2011). If we linearly combine the RTE scores used
in the MSR baseline with our method, we achieve
5 and 2.5 accuracy points higher than the best re-
sults achieved by Richardson et al. (2013).

Concurrently with ours, three other approaches
to solving MCTest were developed and sub-
sequently published a few months before our
method. Narasimhan and Barzilay (2015) pre-
sented a discourse-level approach, which chooses
an answer by utilising relations between sentences
chosen as important. Despite is simplicity, our
method is comparable in performance, suggesting
that better lexical matching could help improve
their model. Sachan et al. (2015) treated MCTest
as a structured prediction problem, searching for
a latent structure connecting the question, answer
and the text, dubbed the answer-entailing struc-
ture. Their model performs better on MC500 (was

not tested on MC160), however the strength of
our model is obtaining comparable results with a
much simpler model. The work of Wang et al.
(2015) is the most similar to ours, in the sense that
they combine a baseline feature set with more ad-
vanced linguistic analyses, namely syntax, frame
semantics, coreference, and word embeddings. In-
stead of a rule-based approach, they combine them
through a latent-variable classifier achieving the
current state-of-the-art performance on MCTest.

6 Discussion

Using the question-filtering rules mentioned in
Section 4.2, we obtained individual accuracy
scores per question type for the final system com-
bined with RTE (Table 3). Note that these types
are in three groups: i) wh-word questions (dis-
joint, questions without an wh-word are in Other),
ii) classes of questions requiring non-trivial lin-
guistic analysis and reasoning (not disjoint, not all
questions considered), and iii) questions originally
classified by crowdworkers, classifying whether
the question can be answered by a single or multi-
ple sentences in the story (disjoint).

Compared to the wh-word question type re-
sults of Narasimhan and Barzilay (2015), our ap-
proach performs better primarily on why questions
(72.97% and 80.65% vs. 59.45% and 69.35% on
MC160 and MC500 respectively) and slightly bet-
ter on how, when and what questions on MC500.
Additionally, our system is more successful in
questions requiring multiple sentences to be an-
swered correctly (70.31% and 63.3%vs. 65.23%
and 59.9% on MC160 and MC500 respectively).

If we remove the RTE component from our sys-

tem, the performance on relatively simple question
types such as what, who and where remains practi-
cally the same, thus confirming that our approach
can handle simple questions well. On the other
hand, the performance on why questions drops
without RTE, thus stressing the need for deeper
text understanding.

There are several clear deficiencies in certain
question types, particularly in handling negation.
These errors provide a broad overview of the cases
in which simple lexical techniques are not suffi-
cient to determine the correct answer.

Many numerical questions, particularly in
MC500, require the use of simple algebra over
story elements, including counting characters and
objects, and understanding temporal order. One
question even requires calculating the probability
of an event occurring, while another one calls for
complex volumetric calculation. Answering ques-
tions such as these is beyond the capabilities of
a lexical algorithm, and accuracies in this cate-
gory are worse than on all questions. Addition-
ally, lexical algorithms such as ours, which ig-
nore predicate-argument structure, perform worse
in the presence of quantifiers.

In MC500, the performance of our system on
more abstract questions, concerning the overall
narrative of the story, also demonstrates a sig-

1696



nificant inadequacy of lexical-based algorithms.
Questions such as “What was the first character
mentioned in the story?”, which relate to the over-
all narrative flow of the passage, or questions con-
cerning the state of the story environment, such
as “Where is the story set?”, are difficult to solve
without a system which understands the concept
of a story. Typical question-answering methods
would also struggle here.

Another type of challenging question are those
which require an implicit temporal understanding
of the text, i.e. questions concerning time without
using a temporal modifier. For example, given a
story which states that “John is at the beach”, then
later “John went home”, a question such as “What
did John do at home?” would prove itself difficult
for traditional methods to answer. These questions
are difficult to identify automatically by the form
of the question alone, thus we cannot provide ac-
curacies for them.

Our results confirm that it is easier to achieve
better performance on MC160 with simple lexi-
cal techniques, while the MC500 has proved more
resilient to the same improvements. We also ob-
served that the MC500 registers smaller improve-
ments in accuracy when adding components such
as co-reference. This is a consequence of the de-
sign and curation process of the MC500 dataset,
which stipulated that answers must not be con-
tained directly within the story text, or if they are,
that two or more misleading choices included.

Richardson et al. (2013) demonstrate that the
MC160 and MC500 have similar ratings for clar-
ity and grammar, and that humans perform equally
well on both. However, in many cases MC500 ap-
pears to be designed in such a way to confuse lex-
ical algorithms and encourage the use of more so-
phisticated techniques necessary to deal with phe-
nomena such as elimination questions, negation,
and common knowledge not explicitly written in
the story.

7 Related work

The use of shallow methods for machine compre-
hension has been explored in previous work, for
example Hirschman et al. (1999) used a bag-of-
words to match question-answer pairs to sentences
in the text, and choose the best pair with the best
matching sentence. As discussed in our analysis,
such systems cannot handle well questions involv-
ing negation and quantification. Numerical ques-

tions, which we found to be particularly challeng-
ing, have been the focus of recent work on algebra
word problems (Kushman et al., 2014) for which
dedicated systems have been developed.

MacCartney et al. (2006) demonstrated that a
large set of rules can be used to recognize valid
textual entailments. These consider phenomena
such as polarity and quantification, similar to those
we used in our analysis of the MCTest datasets.
More complex methods, which attempt deeper
modeling of text include Natural Logic (Angeli
and Manning, 2014) and Combinatorial Catego-
rial Grammars (Lewis and Steedman, 2013) com-
bined with distributional models. While promis-
ing, these approaches have been developed pri-
marily on sentence-level tasks, thus the stories in
MCTest are likely to present additional challenges.

The recently proposed class of methods called
Memory Network (Weston et al., 2014), uses neu-
ral networks and external memory to answer a
simpler comprehension task. Though quite suc-
cessful on toy tasks, those methods cannot yet be
applied to MCTest as they require much larger
training datasets than the ones available for this
task.

A recent approach by Hermann et al. (2015)
uses attention-based recurrent neural networks to
attack the problem of machine comprehension.
In this work, the authors show how to generate
large amounts of data for machine comprehension
exploiting news websites, and how to use novel
architectures in deep learning to solve the task.
However, due to the need for a large dataset for
training, and the focus only on questions that take
entities as answers, this approach has not been ap-
plied to MCTest.

8 Conclusion

In this paper we developed an approach to MCTest
that combines lexical matching with simple lin-
guistic analysis. We evaluated it on the two
MCTest datasets, MC160 and MC500, and we
showed that it improves upon the original baseline
by 4 and 3 percentage points respectively, while
being comparable to more complex approaches. In
addition, our analysis highlighted the challenges
involved and in particular in the MC500 dataset.
