Abstract

Information published in online stock invest-
ment message boards, and more recently in
stock microblogs, is considered highly valu-
able by many investors. Previous work fo-
cused on aggregation of sentiment from all
users. However, in this work we show that it
is beneficial to distinguish expert users from
non-experts. We propose a general framework
for identifying expert investors, and use it as a
basis for several models that predict stock rise
from stock microblogging messages (stock
tweets). In particular, we present two methods
that combine expert identification and per-user
unsupervised learning. These methods were
shown to achieve relatively high precision in
predicting stock rise, and significantly outper-
form our baseline. In addition, our work pro-
vides an in-depth analysis of the content and
potential usefulness of stock tweets.

1 Introduction

Online investment message boards such as Yahoo!
Finance and Raging Bull allow investors to share
trading ideas, advice and opinions on public com-
panies. Recently, stock microblogging services such
as StockTwits (which started as a filtering service
over the Twitter platform) have become very popu-
lar. These forums are considered by many investors
as highly valuable sources for making their trading
decisions.

This work aims to mine useful investment in-
formation from messages published in stock mi-
croblogs. We shall henceforth refer to these mes-
sages as stock tweets. Ultimately, we would like to

transform those tweets into buy and sell decisions.
Given a set of stock-related messages, this process
typically comprises two steps:

1. Classify each message as “bullish” (having a
positive outlook on the stock), “bearish” (hav-
ing a negative outlook on the stock), or neutral.

2. Make trading decisions based on these message
classifications.

Previous work on stock investment forums and
microblogs usually regarded the first step (message
classification) as a sentiment analysis problem, and
aligned bullish with positive sentiment and bearish
with negative sentiment. Messages were classified
by matching positive and negative terms from sen-
timent lexicons, learning from a hand-labeled set of
messages, or some combination of the two (Das and
Chen, 2007; Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Chua et al.,
2009; Zhang and Skiena, 2010; Sprenger and Welpe,
2010). Trading decisions were made by aggregating
the sentiment for a given stock over all the tweets,
and picking stocks with strongest sentiment signal
(buying the most bullish stocks and short-selling the
most bearish ones).

Sentiment aggregation reflects the opinion of the
investors community as a whole, but overlooks the
variability in user expertise. Clearly, not all investors
are born equal, and if we could tell experts from non-
experts, we would reduce the noise in these forums
and obtain high-quality signals to follow. This pa-
per presents a framework for identifying experts in
stock microblogs by monitoring their performance
in a training period. We show that following the ex-
perts results in more precise predictions.

Based on the expert identification framework, we
experiment with different methods for deriving pre-
dictions from stock tweets. While previous work
largely aligned bullishness with message sentiment,
our in-depth content analysis of stock tweets (to be
presented in section 2.2) suggests that this view is
too simplistic. To start with, one important dif-
ference between bullishness/bearishness and posi-
tive/negative sentiment is that while the former rep-
resents belief about the future, the latter may also
refer to the past or present. For example, a user re-
porting on making profit from a buying stock yester-
day and selling it today is clearly positive about the
stock, but does not express any prediction about its
future performance. Furthermore, messages that do
refer to the future differ considerably in their signif-
icance. A tweet reporting on buying a stock by the
user conveys a much stronger bullishness signal than
a tweet that merely expresses an opinion. Overall, it
would seem that judging bullishness is far more elu-
sive than judging sentiment.

We therefore propose and compare two alterna-
tive approaches that sidestep the complexities of as-
sessing tweets bullishness. These two approaches
can be viewed as representing two extremes. The
first approach restricts our attention to the most ex-
plicit signals of bullishness and bearishness, namely,
tweets that report actual buy and sell transactions
performed by the user. In the second approach we
learn directly the relation between tweets content
and stock prices, following previous work on pre-
dicting stock price movement from factual sources
such as news articles (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Koppel
and Shtrimberg, 2004; Schumaker and Chen, 2010).
This approach poses no restrictions on the tweets
content and avoids any stipulated tweet classifica-
tion. However, user-generated messages are largely
subjective, and their correlation with the stock prices
depends on user’s expertise. This introduces much
noise into the learning process. We show that by
making the learning user-sensitive we can improve
the results substantially. Overall, our work illus-
trates the feasibility of finding expert investors, and
the utility of following them.

2 Stock Tweets

2.1 Stock Tweets Language
Stock tweets, as Twitter messages in general, are
short textual messages of up to 140 characters. They
are distinguished by having one or more references
to stock symbols (tickers), prefixed by a dollar sign.
For instance, the stock of Apple, Inc. is referenced
as $AAPL. Two other noteworthy Twitter conven-
tions that are also found in stock tweets are hashtags,
user-defined labels starting with ‘#’, and references
to other users, starting with ‘@’. Table 1 lists some
examples of stock tweets.

As common with Twitter messages, stock tweets
are typically abbreviated and ungrammatical utter-
ances. The language is informal and includes many
slang expressions, many of which are unique to the
stock tweets community. Thus, many positive and
negative expressions common to stock tweets are not
found in standard sentiment lexicons. Their unique
language and terminology often make stock tweets
hard to understand for an outsider. Many words
are abbreviated and appear in several non-standard
forms. For example, the word bought may also ap-
pear as bot or bght, and today may appear as 2day.
Stock tweets also contain many sentiment expres-
sions which may appear in many variations, e.g.
wow, woooow, woooooooow and so on. These char-
acteristics make the analysis of stock tweets a par-
ticularly challenging task.

2.2 Content Analysis
A preliminary step of this research was an exten-
sive data analysis, aimed to gain better understand-
ing of the major types of content conveyed in stock
tweets. First, we developed a taxonomy of tweet
categories while reading a few thousands of tweets.
Based on this taxonomy we then tagged a sample
of 350 tweets to obtain statistics on the frequency
of each category. The sample contained only tweets
that mention exactly one ticker. The following types
of tweets were considered irrelevant:

• Tweets that express question. These tweets
were labeled as Question.

• Obscure tweets, e.g. “$AAPL fat”, tweets
that contain insufficient information (e.g.
“http://url.com $AAPL”) and tweets that seem

to contain no useful information (e.g “Even
Steve Jobs is wrong sometimes... $AAPL
http://ow.ly/1Tw0Z”). These tweets were la-
beled Irrelevant.

The rest of the tweets were classified into two major
categories: Facts and Opinions.

Facts can be divided into four main subcategories:

1. News: such tweets are generally in the form of
a tweeted headline describing news or a current
event generally drawn from mass media. As
such they are reliable but, since the information
is available in far greater detail elsewhere, their
added value is limited.

2. Chart Pattern: technical analysis aims to pro-
vide insight into trends and emerging patterns
in a stock’s price. These tweets describe pat-
terns in the stock’s chart without the inclusion
of any predicted or projected movement, an im-
portant contrast to Chart Prediction, which is
an opinion tweet described below. Chart pat-
tern tweets, like news, are a condensed form of
information already available through more in-
depth sources and as such their added value is
limited.

3. Trade: reports an actual purchase or sale of a
stock by the user. We consider this as the most
valuable form of tweet.

4. Trade Outcome: provides details of an “inverse
trade”, the secondary trade to exit the initial
position along with the outcome of the over-
all trade (profit/loss). The value of these tweets
is debatable since although they provide details
of a trade, they generally describe the “exit”
transaction. This creates a dilemma for ana-
lysts since traders will often exit not because
of a perceived change in the stock’s potential
but as a result of many short-term trading ac-
tivities. For this reason trade outcome provides
a moderate insight into a user’s position which
should be viewed with some degree of caution.

Opinions can also be divided into four main subcat-
egories:

1. Speculation: provides individual predictions of
future events relating to a company or actions
of the company. These are amongst the least
reliable categories, as the individual user is typ-
ically unable to justify his or her insight into the
predicted action.

2. Chart Prediction: describes a user’s prediction
of a future chart movement based on technical
analysis of the stock’s chart.

3. Recommendation: As with analyst recommen-
dations, this category represents users who
summarize their understanding and insight into

1312



a stock with a simple and effective recommen-
dation to take a certain course of action with
regard to a particular share. Recommendation
is the less determinate counterpart to Trade.

4. Sentiment: These tweets express pure senti-
ment toward the stock, rather than any factual
content.

Table 1 shows examples for each of the tweet cate-
gories, as well as their relative frequency in the ana-
lyzed sample.

3 An Expert Finding Framework

In this section we present a general procedure for
finding experts in stock microblogs. Based on this
procedure, we will develop in the next sections sev-
eral models for extracting reliable trading signals
from tweets.

We assume that a stock tweet refers to exactly one
stock, and therefore there is a one-to-one mapping
between tweets and stocks. Other tweets are dis-
carded. We define expertise as the ability to pre-
dict stock rise with high precision. Thus, a user is
an expert if a high percentage of his or her bullish
tweets is followed by a stock rise. In principle, we
could analogously follow bearish tweets, and see if
they are followed by a stock fall. However, bearish
tweets are somewhat more difficult to interpret: for
example, selling a share may indicate a negative out-
look on the stock, but it may also result from other
considerations, e.g. following a trading strategy that
holds the stock for a fixed period (cf. the discussion
on Trade Outcome tweets in the previous section).

We now describe a procedure that determines
whether a user u is an expert. The procedure re-
ceives a training set T of tweets posted by u, where
each tweet is annotated with its posting time. It is
also given a classifier C, which classifies each tweet
as bullish or not bullish (either bearish or neutral).

The procedure first applies the classifier C to iden-
tify the bullish tweets in T . It then determines the
correctness of each bullish tweet. Given a tweet t,
we observe the price change of the stock referenced
by t over a one day period starting at the next trading
day. The exact definition of mapping tweets to stock
prices is given in section 5.1. A one-day holding
period was chosen as it was found to perform well

in previous works on tweet-based trading (Zhang
and Skiena, 2010; Sprenger and Welpe, 2010), in
particular for long positions (buy transactions). A
bullish tweet is considered correct if it is followed
by a stock rise, and as incorrect otherwise1. Given a
set of tweets, we define its precision as the percent-
age of correct tweets in the set. Let Cu, Iu denote
the number of correct and incorrect bullish tweets
of user u, respectively. The precision of u’s bullish
tweets is therefore:

Pu =
Cu

Cu + Iu

Let Pbl be the baseline precision. In this work we
chose the baseline precision to be the proportion of
tweets that are followed by a stock rise in the whole
training set (including all the users). This represents
the expected precision when picking tweets at ran-
dom. Clearly, if Pu ≤ Pbl then u is not an expert.
If Pu > Pbl, we apply the following statistical test
to assess whether the difference is statistically sig-
nificant. First, we compute the expected number of
correct and incorrect transactions Cbl, Ibl according
to the baseline:

Cbl = Pbl × (Cu + Iu)

Ibl = (1− Pbl)× (Cu + Iu)
We then compare the observed counts (Cu, Iu) to
the expected counts (Cbl, Ibl), using Pearson’s Chi-
square test. Since it is required for this test that
Cbl and Ibl are at least 5, cases that do not meet
this requirement are discarded. If the resulting p-
value satisfies the required significance level α, then
u is considered an expert. In this work we take
α = 0.05. Note that since the statistical test takes
into account the number of observations, it will re-
ject cases where the number of the observations is
very small, even if the precision is very high. The
output of the procedure is a classification of u as
expert/non-expert, as well as the p-value (for ex-
perts). The expert finding procedure is summarized
in Algorithm 1.

In the next two sections we propose several alter-
natives for the classifier C.

1For about 1% of the tweets the stock price did not change
in the next trading day. These tweets are also considered correct
throughout this work.

4 Following Explicit Transactions

The first approach we attempt for classifying bullish
(and bearish) tweets aims to identify only tweets that
report buy and sell transactions (that is, tweets in
the Trade category). According to our data analysis
(reported in section 2.2), about 13% of the tweets
belong to this category. There are two reasons to
focus on these tweets. First, as we already noted,
actual transactions are clearly the strongest signal
of bulishness/bearishness. Second, the buy and sell
actions are usually reported using a closed set of
expressions, making these tweets relatively easy to
identify. A few examples for buy and sell tweets are
shown in Table 2.

While buy and sell transactions can be captured
reasonably well by a relatively small set of patterns,
the examples in Table 2 show that stock tweets have

Table 2: Buy and sell tweets

their unique language for reporting these transac-
tions, which must be investigated in order to come
by these patterns. Thus, in order to develop a clas-
sifier for these tweets, we created a training and test
corpora as follows. Based on our preliminary anal-
ysis of several thousand tweets, we composed a vo-
cabulary of keywords which trade tweets must in-
clude2. This vocabulary contained words such as in,
out, bot, bght, sld and so on. Filtering out tweets that
match none of the keywords removed two thirds of
the tweets. Out of the remaining tweets, about 5700
tweets were tagged. The training set contains about
3700 tweets, 700 of which are transactions. The test
set contains about 2000 tweets, 350 of which are
transactions.

Since the transaction tweets can be characterized
by a closed set of recurring patterns, we developed
a classifier that is based on a few dozens of man-
ually composed pattern matching rules, formulated
as regular expressions. The classifier works in three
stages:

1. Normalization: The tweet is transformed into
a canonical form. For example, user name

2That is, we did not come across any trade tweet that does
not include at least one of the keywords in the large sample we
analyzed, so we assume that such tweets are negligible.

and so on.

2. Matching: Trying to match one of the buy/sell
patterns in the normalized tweet.

3. Filtering: Filtering out tweets that match “dis-
qualifying” patterns. The simplest examples
are a tweet starting with an “if” or a tweet con-
taining a question mark.

The results of the classifier on the train and test set
are summarized in Table 3. The results show that
our classifier identifies buy/sell transactions with a
good precision and a reasonable recall.

5 Unsupervised Learning from Stock
Prices

The drawback of the method presented in the pre-
vious section is that it only considers a small part
of the available tweets. In this section we propose
an alternative method, which considers all the avail-
able tweets, and does not require any tagged corpus
of tweets. Instead, we use actual stock price move-
ments as our labels.

5.1 Associating Tweets with Stock Prices

We used stock prices to label tweets as follows. Each
tweet message has a time stamp (eastern time), indi-
cating when it was published. Our policy is to buy
in the opening price of the next trading day (PB),
and sell on the opening price of the following trad-
ing day (PS). Tweets that are posted until 9:25 in the
morning (market hours begin at 9:30) are associated
with the same day, while those are posted after that
time are associated with the next trading date.

5.2 Training
Given the buy and sell prices associated with each
tweet, we construct positive and negative training
examples as follows: positive examples are tweets
where PS−PBPB ≥ 3%, and negative examples are
tweets where PS−PBPB ≤ −3%.

We used the SVM-light package (Joachims,
1999), with the following features:

• The existence of the following elements in the
message text:

– Reference to a ticker
– Reference to a user
– URL
– Number
– Hashtag
– Question mark

• The case-insensitive words in the message after
dropping the above elements.

• The 3, 4, 5 letter prefixes of each word.

• The name of the user who authored the tweet,
if it is a frequent user (at least 50 messages in
the training data). Otherwise, the user name is
taken to be “anonymous”.

• Whether the stock price was up or down 1% or
more in the previous trading day.

• 2, 3, 4-word expressions which are typical to
tweets (that is, their relative frequency in tweets
is much higher than in general news text).

6 Empirical Evaluation

In this section we focus on the empirical task of
tweet ranking: ordering the tweets in the test set ac-
cording to their likelihood to be followed by a stock
rise. This is similar to the common IR task of rank-
ing documents according to their relevance. A per-
fect ranking would place all the correct tweets before
all the incorrect ones.

We present several ranking models that use the
expert finding framework and the bullishness classi-
fication methods discussed in the previous sections
as building blocks. The performance of these mod-
els is evaluated on the test set. By considering the

1315



precision at various points along the list of ranked
tweets, we can compare the precision-recall trade-
offs achieved by each model.

Before we discuss the ranking models and the em-
pirical results, we describe the datasets used to train
and test these models.

6.1 Datasets
Stock tweets were downloaded from the StockTwits
website3, during two periods: from April 25, 2010
to November 1, 2011, and from December 14, 2010
to February 3, 2011. A total of 700K tweets mes-
sages were downloaded. Tweets that do not contain
exactly one stock ticker (traded in NYSE or NAS-
DAQ) were filtered out. The remaining 340K tweets
were divided as follows:

• Development set: April 25, 2010 to August 31,
2010: 124K messages

• Held out set: September 1, 2010 to November
1, 2010: 110K messages

• Test set: December 14, 2010 to February 3,
2011: 106K messages

We consider the union of the development and held
out sets as our training set.

6.2 Ranking Models
6.2.1 Joint-All Model

This is our baseline model, as it does not attempt
to identify experts. It learns a single SVM model
as described in Section 5 from all the tweets in the
training set. It then applies the SVM model to each
tweet in the test set, and ranks them according to the
SVM classification score.

6.2.2 Transaction Model
This model finds expert users in the training set

(Algorithm 1), using the buy/sell classifier described
in Section 4. Tweets classified as buy are considered
bullish, and the rest are considered non-bullish. Ex-
pert users are ranked according to their p value (in
ascending order). The same classifier is then applied
to the tweets of the expert users in the test set. The
tweets classified as bullish are ordered according to
the ranking of their author (first all the bullish tweets

3stocktwits.com

of the highest-ranked expert user, then all the bullish
tweets of the expert ranked second, and so on).

6.2.3 Per-User Model

The joint all model suffers from the tweets of
non-experts twice: at training time, these tweets in-
troduce much noise into the training of the SVM
model. At test time, we follow these unreliable
tweets along with the more reliable tweets of the ex-
perts. The per-user model addresses both problems.

This model learns from the development set a sep-
arate SVM model Cu for each user u, based solely
on the user’s tweets. We then optimize the clas-
sification threshold of the learnt SVM model Cu
as follows. Setting the threshold to θ results in a
new classifier Cu,θ. Algorithm 1 is applied to u’s
tweets in the held-out set (denoted Hu), using the
classifier Cu,θ. For the ease of presentation, we de-
fine ExpertPValue(Hu, Cu,θ,Pbl,α) as a function that
calls Algorithm 1 with the given parameters, and re-
turns the obtained p-value if u is an expert and 1
otherwise. We search exhaustively for the thresh-
old θ̂ for which this function is minimized (in other
words, the threshold that results in the best p-value).
The threshold of Cu is then set to θ̂, and the user’s
p-value is set to the best p-value found. If u is a
non-expert for all of the attempted θ values then u is
discarded. Otherwise, u is identified as an expert.

The rest of the process is similar to the transac-
tion model: the tweets of each expert u in the test
set are classified using the optimized per-user clas-
sifier Cu. The final ranking is obtained by sorting
the tweets that were classified as bullish according
to the p-value of their author. The per-user ranking
procedure is summarized in Algorithm 2.

6.2.4 Joint-Experts Model

The joint experts model makes use of the experts
identified by the per-user model, and builds a sin-
gle joint SVM model from the tweets of these users.
This results in a model that is trained on more exam-
ples than in the previous per-user method, but unlike
the joint all method, it learns only from high-quality
users. As with the joint all model, test tweets are
ranked according to the SVM’s score. However, the
model considers only the tweets of expert users in
the test set.

6.3 Results

Figure 1 summarizes the results obtained for the
various models. Each model was used to rank the

tweets according to the confidence that they predict
a positive stock price movement. Each data point
corresponds to the precision obtained for the first k
tweets ranked by the model, and the results for vary-
ing k values illustrate the precision/recall tradeoff of
the model. These data points were obtained as fol-
lows:

• For methods that learn a single SVM model
(joint all and joint experts), the graph was ob-
tained by decreasing the threshold of the SVM
classifier, at fixed intervals of 0.05. For each
threshold value, k is the number of tweets clas-
sified as bullish by the model.

• For methods that rank the users by their p value
and order the tweets accordingly (transaction
and per user), the i-th data point corresponds
to the cumulative precision for the tweets clas-
sified as bullish by the first i users. For the per
user method we show the cumulative results for
the first 20 users. For the transaction method
we show all the users that were identified as ex-
perts.

The random line is our baseline. It shows the ex-
pected results for randomly ordering the tweets in
the test set. The expected precision at any point is
equal to the percentage of tweets in the test set that
were followed by a stock rise, which was found to
be 51.4%.

We first consider the joint all method, which
learns a single model from all the tweets. The only

Table 4: Per user model: cumulative results for first 20
users. The table lists the number of correct and incorrect
tweets, the precision P and the significance level p.

per-user information available to this model is a fea-
ture fed to the SVM classifier, which, as we found,
does not contribute to the results. Except for the
first 58 tweets, which achieved precision of 55%,
the precision quickly dropped to a level of around
52%, which is just a little better than the random
baseline. Next, we consider the transaction configu-
ration, which is based on detecting buy transactions.
Only 10 users were found to be experts according to
this method, and in the test period these users had a
total of 173 tweets. These 173 tweets achieve good
precision (57.1% for the first 161 tweets, and 54.9%
for the first 173 tweets). However this method re-
sulted in a low number of transactions. This happens
because it is able to utilize only a small fraction of
the tweets (explicit buy transactions).

Remarkably, per user and joint experts, the two
methods which rely on identifying the experts via
unsupervised learning are by far the best methods.
Both models seem to have comparable performance,
where the results of the join experts model are some-
what smoother, as expected. Table 4 shows cumu-
lative results for the first 20 users in the per-user
model. The results show that this model achieves

good precision for a relatively large number of
tweets, and for most of the data points reported in the
table the results significantly outperform the base-
line (as indicated by the p value). Overall, these re-
sults show the effectiveness of our methods for find-
ing experts through unsupervised learning.

7 Related Work

A growing body of work aims at extracting senti-
ment and opinions from tweets, and exploit this in-
formation in a variety of application domains. Davi-
dov et al. (2010) propose utilizing twitter hash-
tag and smileys to learn enhanced sentiment types.
O’Connor et al. (2010) propose a sentiment detec-
tor based on Twitter data that may be used as a re-
placement for public opinion polls. Bollen et al.
(2011) measure six different dimensions of public
mood from a very large tweet collection, and show
that some of these dimensions improve the predica-
tion of changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA).

Sentiment analysis of news articles and financial
blogs and their application for stock prediction were
the subject of several studies in recent years. Some
of these works focus on document-level sentiment
classification (Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; O’Hare et
al., 2009). Other works also aimed at predicting
stock movement (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Koppel
and Shtrimberg, 2004; Schumaker and Chen, 2010).
All these methods rely on predefined sentiment lex-
icons, manually classified training texts, or their
combination. Lavrenko et al. (2000), Koppel and
Shtrimberg (2004), and Schumaker and Chen (2010)
exploit stock prices for training, and thus save the
need in supervised learning.

Previous work on stock message boards include
(Das and Chen, 2007; Antweiler and Frank, 2004;
Chua et al., 2009). (Sprenger and Welpe, 2010) is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first work to address
specifically stock microblogs. All these works take
a similar approach for classifying message bullish-
ness: they train a classifier (Naı̈ve Bayes, which Das
and Chen combined with additional classifiers and
a sentiment lexicon, and Chua et al. presented im-
provement for) on a collection of manually labeled
messages (classified into Buy, Sell, Hold). Interest-
ingly, Chua et al. made use of an Australian mes-

1318



sage board (HotCopper), where, unlike most of the
stock message boards, these labels are added by the
message author. Another related work is (Zhang and
Skiena, 2010), who apply lexicon-based sentiment
analysis to several sources of news and blogs, in-
cluding tweets. However, their data set does not in-
clude stock microblogs, but tweets mentioning the
official company name.

Our work differs from previous work on stock
messages in two vital aspects. Firstly, these works
did not attempt to distinguish between experts and
non-expert users, but aggregated the sentiment over
all the users when studying the relation between sen-
timent and the stock market. Secondly, unlike these
works, our best-performing methods are completely
unsupervised, and require no manually tagged train-
ing data or sentiment lexicons.

8 Conclusion

This paper investigated the novel task of finding ex-
pert investors in online stock forums. In particular,
we focused on stock microblogs. We proposed a
framework for finding expert investors, and exper-
imented with several methods for tweet classifica-
tion using this framework. We found that combin-
ing our framework with user-specific unsupervised
learning allows us to predict stock price movement
with high precision, and the results were shown to be
statistically significant. Our results illustrate the im-
portance of distinguishing experts from non-experts.
An additional contribution of this work is an in-
depth analysis of stock tweets, which sheds light on
their content and its potential utility.

In future work we plan to improve the features of
the SVM classifier, and further investigate the use-
fulness of our approach for trading.
