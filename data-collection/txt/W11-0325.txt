In recent years Bayesian techniques have made good inroads in computational linguistics, due to their pro-
tection against overfitting and expressiveness of the Bayesian modeling language. However most Bayesian
models proposed so far have used pretty simple prior distributions, chosen more for computational conve-
nience than as reflections of real prior knowledge.

In this talk I will propose that prior distributions can be powerful ways to put computational linguis-
tics knowledge into your models, and give two examples from my own work. Firstly, hierarchical priors
can allow you to specify relationships among different components of your model so that the information
learned in one component can be shared with the rest, improving the estimation of parameters for all. Sec-
ondly, newer distributions like Pitman-Yor processes have interesting power-law characteristics that if used
as prior distributions can allow your linguistic models to express Zipf’s Law and Heap’s Law.

I will round up the talk with a discussion of the viability of the Bayesian approach, in a future where
we have too much data, making the natural language learning problem more a computational rather than a
statistical one.
