Abstract

This paper describes the JHU system combi-
nation scheme used in WMT-11. The JHU
system combination is based on confusion
network alignment, and inherited the frame-
work developed by (Karakos et al., 2008).
We improved our core system combination al-
gorithm by making use of TER-plus, which
was originally designed for string alignment,
for alignment of confusion networks. Exper-
imental results on French-English, German-
English, Czech-English and Spanish-English
combination tasks show significant improve-
ments on BLEU and TER by up to 2 points on
average, compared to the best individual sys-
tem output, and improvements compared with
the results produced by ITG which we used in
WMT-10.

1 Introduction

System combination aims to improve the translation
quality by combining the outputs from multiple in-
dividual MT systems. The state-of-the-art system
combination methodologies can be roughly catego-
rized as follows (Karakos et al., 2010):

1. Confusion network based: confusion network
is a form of lattice with the constraint that all
paths need to pass through all nodes. An exam-
ple of a confusion network is shown in Figure
1.

Here, the set of arcs between two consecutive
nodes represents a bin, the number following a
word is the count of this word in its bin, and

0 1
this/10

2
is/7

was/3
3

a/8

one/2
4

dog/9

cat/1
5/0

./10

Figure 1: Example confusion network. The total count in
each bin is 10.

each bin has the same size. The basic method-
ology of system combination based on confu-
sion network includes the following steps: (a)
Choose one system output as the “skeleton”,
which roughly decides the word order. (b)
Align further system outputs to the skeleton,
thus forming a confusion network. (c) Rescore
the final confusion network using a language
model, then pick the best path as the output of
combination.

A textual representation (where each line con-
tains the words and counts of each bin) is usu-
ally the most convenient for machine process-
ing.

2. Joint optimization based: unlike building con-
fusion network, this method considers all sys-
tem outputs at once instead of incrementally.
Then a log-linear model is used to derive costs,
followed by a search algorithm to explore the
combination space (Jayaraman et al., 2005;
Heafield et al., 2009; He et al., 2009).

3. Hypothesis selection based: this method only
includes algorithms that output one of the input
translations, and no word selection from mul-
tiple systems is performed. Typical algorithms
can be found in (Rosti et al., 2007).

This paper describes the JHU system com-
bination submitted to the Sixth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT-11)
(http://statmt.org/wmt11/index.html ). The JHU
system combination is confusion network based
as described above, following the basic system
combination framework described in (Karakos et
al., 2008). However, instead of ITG alignments
that were used in (Karakos et al., 2008), alignments
based on TER-plus (Snover et al., 2009) were used
now as the core system alignment algorithm.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 introduces the application of TER-plus in
system combination. Section 3 introduces the JHU
system combination pipeline. Section 4 presents the
combination results and concluding remarks appear
in Section 5.

2 Word Reordering for Hypothesis
Alignment

Given the outputs of multiple MT systems, we
would like to reorder and align the words of different
hypothesis in a way such that an objective function is
optimized, thus reaching better translations by mak-
ing use of more information. In our system combi-
nation scheme, the objective function was based on
Translation-Edit-Rate Plus (TER-plus).

2.1 Introduction to TER-plus

TER-plus is an extension of Translation Error Rate
(TER) (Snover et al., 2006). TER is an evaluation
metric for machine translation; it generalizes Word
Error Rate (WER) by allowing block shifts in addi-
tion to the edit distance operations. However, one
problem with TER is that only exact match of word
blocks are allowed for shifting; this constraint might
be too strict as it sometimes prevents reasonable
shifts if two blocks have similar meanings.

TER-plus remedies this problem by introducing
new flexible matches between words, thus allowing
word substitutions and block shifts with costs much
lower than that of TER. Specifically, substitution
costs are now dependent on whether the words have
the same stem (stem matches) or are synonyms (syn-
onym matches). These operations relax the shift-
ing constraints of TER; shifts are now allowed if the

words of one string are synonyms or share the same
stem as the words of the string they are compared to
(Snover et al., 2009).

TER-plus identifies words with the same stem us-
ing the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter et al.,
1980), and identifies synonyms using the WordNet
database (Miller et al., 1995).

2.2 TER-plus for system combination

Originally, TER-plus was designed for aligning to-
gether word strings. However, similar to the work
of (Karakos et al., 2010), who extended ITG to al-
low bilingual parsing of two confusion networks (by
treating each confusion network bin as a multi-word
entity), we converted the basic TER-plus code to
take into account multiple words present in confu-
sion network bins. Specifically, we define the cost
of aligning two confusion network bins as (Karakos
et al., 2010)

cost(b1, b2) =
1

|b1||b2|
∑

w1∈b1

∑
w2∈b2

C(w1, w2)

in which b1,b2 are the confusion network bins which
are candidates for alignment, | · | is the size of a
bin, w1, w2 are words in b1 and b2 respectively, and
C(w1, w2) is defined as follows:

C(w1, w2) =



0 w1 matches w2
0.5 w2 is deleted
0.6 w2 is inserted
0.2 w1 and w2 are synonyms
0.2 w1 and w2 share stems

1 none of the above

Furthermore, the bin shift cost is set to 1.5. These
numbers are empirically determined based on exper-
imental results.

Similar to (Karakos et al., 2010), when a bin gets
“deleted”, it gets replaced with a NULL arc, which
simply encodes the empty string, and is otherwise
treated as a regular token in the alignments.

3 The JHU System Combination Pipeline

We now describe the JHU system combination
pipeline in which TER-plus is used as the core con-
fusion network alignment algorithm as introduced in
the previous section.

3.1 Combination procedure overview

The JHU system combination scheme is based on
confusion network as introduced in section 1. The
confusion networks are built in two stages:

1. Within-system combination: (optional, only
applicable in the case where per-system n-best
lists are available.) the within-system combi-
nation generates system-specific confusion net-
works based on the alignment of the n-best
translations.

2. Between-system combination: incremental
alignment of the confusion networks of differ-
ent systems generated in step 1, starting from
2-system combination up to the combination of
all systems. The order with which the systems
are selected is based on the individual BLEU
scores (i.e., the best two systems are first com-
bined, then the 3rd best is aligned to the result-
ing confusion network, etc.)

For the between-system combination we made
use of TER-plus as described in section 2.2.

3.2 Language model Rescoring with
Finite-State Transducer Operations

Once the between-system confusion networks are
ready (one confusion network per sentence), a path
through each of them has to be selected as the com-
bination output. In order to pick out the the most flu-
ent word sequence as the final translation, we need
to rescore the confusion networks using a language
model. This task can be performed efficiently via fi-
nite state transducer (FST) operations (Allauzen et
al., 2002). First, we build an FST for each confu-
sion network, called CN-FST. Since the confusion
network is just a sequence of bins and each bin is a
superposition of single words, the CN-FST can be
built as a linear FST in a straightforward way (see
Figure 1).

A 5-gram language model FST (LM-FST) is then
built for each sentence. To build the LM-FST, we
refer to the methodology described in (Allauzen et
al., 2003). In brief, the LM-FST is constructed in
the following way:

1. Extract the vocabulary of each segment.

2. Each state of the FST encodes an n-gram his-
tory (n − 1 words). Each (non-null) arc that
originates from that state corresponds uniquely
to a word type (i.e., word that follows that his-
tory in the training data).

3. The cost of each word arc is the corre-
sponding language model score (negative log-
probability, based on the modified Kneser-Ney
formula (Kneser, 1995) for that n-gram).

4. Extra arcs are added for backing-off to lower-
order histories, thus allowing all possible word
strings to receive a non-zero probability.

In order to deal with the situation where a word
in the confusion network is not in the vocabulary of
the language model, we need to build another sim-
ple transducer, namely, the “unknown word” FST
(UNK-FST), to map this word to the symbol <unk>
that encodes the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
Note that this is useful only if one builds open-
vocabulary language models which always give a
non-zero probability to OOV words; e.g., check
out the option -unk of the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke,
2002). (Obviously, the UNK-FST leaves all other
words unmodified.)

After all these three transducers have been built,
they are composed in the following manner (for each
sentence):

CN-FST .o. UNK-FST .o. LM-FST

Note that a possible re-weighting of the arc costs
of the CN-FST can be done in order to better account
for the different dynamic ranges between the CN
costs and the LM-FST costs. Furthermore, to avoid
too many word deletions (especially in regions of the
confusion network where the words disagree most)
an additive word deletion penalty can be added to all
NULL arcs. The best (minimum-cost) path from this
resulting FST is selected as the output translation of
the system combination for that sentence.

3.3 System combination pipeline summary
We now summarize the JHU system combination
end-to-end pipeline as follows(since BLEU score is
a key metric in the WMT11 translation evaluation,
we use BLEU score as the system ranking criteria.
The BLEU score we computed for the experiments
below are all case-insensitive):

173



1. Process and re-format (lowercase, tokenize,
romanize, etc.) all individual system out-
puts. Note that we compute the case-insensitive
BLEU score in our experiments.

2. Build LM-FST and UNK-FST for each sen-
tence.

3. Decide the between-system combination order
according to the 1-best output BLEU score of
individual systems.

4. Do between-system combination based on the
order decided in step 3 using TER-plus.

5. Rescore the confusion network and start tuning
on the parameters: convert the between-system
confusion network into FST, compose it with
the UNK-FST and with the LM-FST. When
composing with LM-FST, try different CN arc
coefficients (we tried the range {5, . . . , 21}),
and unknown word insertion penalties (we tried
the values {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1}).

6. Compute the BLEU score for all m-syst x y
outputs, where m is the number of systems for
combination, x is the weight and y is the inser-
tion penalty.

7. Among all the scores computed in step 6, find
the best BLEU score, and keep the correspond-
ing parameter setting(m, x, y).

8. Apply the best parameter setting to the test
dataset for evaluation.

Obviously, if n-best outputs from systems are avail-
able, an extra step of producing within-system com-
binations (and searching for the best n-best size) will
also be executed.

4 Results

In WMT11, we participated in French-English,
German-English, Czech-English and Spanish-
English system combination tasks. Although we
followed the general system combination pipeline
introduced in 3.3, we did not do the within-system
combination since we received only 1-best outputs
from all systems.

We built both primary and contrastive systems,
and they differ in the way the 5-gram language mod-
els were trained. The language model for the pri-
mary system was trained with the monolingual Eu-
roparl, news commentary and news crawl corpus
provided by WMT11. The language model for the
contrastive system was trained using only the 1-
best outputs from all individual systems (sentence-
specific language model).

The number of systems used for combination
tuning in each language pair was: 24 for French-
English, 26 for German-English, 12 for Czech-
English, and 16 for Spanish-English. The best re-
sults for the combination in the primary system
made use of 23 systems for French-English, 5 sys-
tems for German-English, 10 systems for Czech-
English, 10 systems for Spanish-English. In the con-
trastive system, the number of systems were 20, 5,
6, 10 respectively.

The TER and BLEU scores on the development
set for the best individual system, the primary and
contrastive combinations are given in Table 1, and
the scores for test set are given in Table 2. From the
results we see that, compared with the best individ-
ual system outputs, system combination results in
significantly improved BLEU scores and remarkable
reductions on TER, for all language pairs. More-
over, we observe that the primary system performs
slightly better than the contrastive system in most
cases.

We also did the experiment of xx-English which
made combinations of all English outputs available
across different source languages. We used 35 sys-
tems in this experiment for both primary and con-
trastive combination, and best result made use of 15
and 16 systems respectively. The development and
test set results are shown in the “xx-en” column in
table 1 and 2 respectively. From the results we see
the improvements on TER and BLEU scores of both
development and test sets almost doubled compared
with the best results of single language pairs.

To make a comparison with the old technique
we used in WMT10 system combination task, we
ran the WMT11 system combination task using ITG
with surface matching. The detailed implementation
is described in (Narsale, 2010). Table 3 and 4 show
the WMT11 results using ITG for alignment respec-
tively. It can be seen that TER-plus outperforms ITG

and flexible match costs and will report results in a
subsequent publication.

5 Conclusion

We described the JHU system combination scheme
that was used in WMT-11. The JHU system com-
bination system is confusion network based, and
we demonstrated the successful application of TER-
plus (which was originally designed for string align-
ment) to confusion network alignment. The WMT-
11 submission results show that significant improve-
ments on the TER and BLEU scores (over the best
individual system) were achieved.
