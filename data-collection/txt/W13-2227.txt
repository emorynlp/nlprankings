Abstract

This paper presents the experiments con-
ducted by the Machine Translation group
at DCU and Prompsit Language Engineer-
ing for the WMT13 translation task. Three
language pairs are considered: Spanish-
English and French-English in both direc-
tions and German-English in that direc-
tion. For the Spanish-English pair, the use
of linguistic information to select paral-
lel data is investigated. For the French-
English pair, the usefulness of the small in-
domain parallel corpus is evaluated, com-
pared to an out-of-domain parallel data
sub-sampling method. Finally, for the
German-English system, we describe our
work in addressing the long distance re-
ordering problem and a system combina-
tion strategy.

1 Introduction

This paper presents the experiments conducted
by the Machine Translation group at DCU1 and
Prompsit Language Engineering2 for the WMT13
translation task on three language pairs: Spanish-
English, French-English and German-English.
For these language pairs, the language and trans-
lation models are built using different approaches
and datasets, thus presented in this paper in sepa-
rate sections.

In Section 2, the systems built for the Spanish-
English pair in both directions are described. We
investigate the use of linguistic information to se-
lect parallel data. In Section 3, we present the sys-
tems built for the French-English pair in both di-

rections. The usefulness of the small in-domain
parallel corpus is evaluated, compared to an out-
of-domain parallel data sub-sampling method. In
Section 4, for the German-English system, aiming
at exploring the long distance reordering problem,
we first describe our efforts in a dependency tree-
to-string approach, before combining different hi-
erarchical systems with a phrase-based system and
show a significant improvement over three base-
line systems.

2 Spanish-English

This section describes the experimental setup for
the Spanish-English language pair.

2.1 Setting
Our setup uses the MOSES toolkit, version
1.0 (Koehn et al., 2007). We use a pipeline
with the phrase-based decoder with standard pa-
rameters, unless noted otherwise. The decoder
uses cube pruning (-cube-pruning-pop-limit 2000
-s 2000), MBR (-mbr-size 800 -mbr-scale 1) and
monotone at punctuation reordering.

Individual language models (LMs), 5-gram and
smoothed using a simplified version of the im-
proved Kneser-Ney method (Chen and Goodman,
1996), are built for each monolingual corpus using
IRSTLM 5.80.01 (Federico et al., 2008). These
LMs are then interpolated with IRSTLM using
the test set of WMT11 as the development set. Fi-
nally, the interpolated LMs are merged into one
LM preserving the weights using SRILM (Stol-
cke, 2002).

We use all the parallel corpora available for
this language pair: Europarl (EU), News Com-
mentary (NC), United Nations (UN) and Common
Crawl (CC). Regarding monolingual corpora, we
use the freely available monolingual corpora (Eu-

213



roparl, News Commentary, News 2007–2012) as
well as the target side of several parallel corpora:
Common Crawl, United Nations and 109 French–
English corpus (only for English as target lan-
guage). Both the parallel and monolingual data
are tokenised and truecased using scripts from the
MOSES toolkit.

2.2 Data selection
The main contribution in our participation regards
the selection of parallel data. We follow the
perplexity-based approach to filter monolingual
data (Moore and Lewis, 2010) extended to filter
parallel data (Axelrod et al., 2011). In our case, we
do not measure perplexity only on word forms but
also using different types of linguistic information
(lemmas and named entities) (Toral, 2013).

We build LMs for the source and target sides
of the domain-specific corpus (in our case NC)
and for a random subset of the non-domain-
specific corpus (EU, UN and CC) of the same size
(number of sentences) of the domain-specific cor-
pus. Each parallel sentence s in the non-domain-
specific corpus is then scored according to equa-
tion 1 where PPIsl(s) is the perplexity of s in
the source side according to the domain-specific
LM and PPOsl(s) is the perplexity of s in the
source side according to the non-domain-specific
LM. PPItl(s) and PPOtl(s) contain the corre-
sponding values for the target side.

score(s) =
1

2
× (PPIsl(s)− PPOsl(s))

+(PPItl(s)− PPOtl(s)) (1)

Table 1 shows the results obtained using four
models: word forms (forms), forms and named en-
tities (forms+nes), lemmas (lem) and lemmas and
named entities (lem+nes). Details on these meth-
ods can be found in Toral (2013).

For each corpus we selected two subsets (see in
bold in Table 1), the one for which one method
obtained the best perplexity (top 5% of EU us-
ing forms, 2% of UN using lemmas and 50% of
CC using forms and named entities) and a big-
ger one used to compare the performance in SMT
(top 14% of EU using lemmas and named entities
(lem+nes), top 12% of UN using forms and named
entities and the whole CC). These subsets are used
as training data in our systems.

As we can see in the table, the use of lin-
guistic information allows to obtain subsets with

lower perplexity than using solely word forms, e.g.
1057.7 (lem+nes) versus 1104.8 (forms) for 14%
of EU. The only exception to this is the subset that
comprises the top 5% of EU, where perplexity us-
ing word forms (957.9) is the lowest one.

2.3 Results
Table 2 presents the results obtained. Note that
these were obtained during development and thus
the systems are tuned on WMT’s 2011 test set and
tested on WMT’s 2012 test set.

All the systems share the same LM. The first
system (no selection) is trained with the whole NC
and EU. The second (small) and third (big) sys-
tems use as training data the whole NC and sub-
sets of EU (5% and 14%, respectively), UN (2%
and 12%, respectively) and CC (50% and 100%,
respectively), as shown in Table 1.

System #sent. BLEU BLEUcased

big 3.8M 33.49 32.43

Table 2: Number of sentences and BLEU scores
obtained on the WMT12 test set for the different
systems on the EN–ES translation task.

The advantage of data selection is clear. The
second system, although smaller in size compared
to the first (1.4M sentence pairs versus 2.1M),
takes its training from a more varied set of data,
and its performance is over one absolute BLEU
point higher.

When comparing the two systems that rely on
data selection, one might expect the one that uses
data with lower perplexity (small) to perform bet-
ter. However, this is not the case, the third system
(big) performing around half an absolute BLEU
point higher than the second (small). This hints
at the fact that perplexity alone is not an optimal
metric for data selection, but size should also be
considered. Note that the size of system 3’s phrase
table is more than double that of system 2.

3 French-English

This section describe the particularities of the MT
systems built for the French-English language pair
in both directions. The goal of the experimen-
tal setup presented here is to evaluate the gain of
adding small in-domain parallel data into a trans-
lation system built on a sub-sample of the out-of-
domain parallel data.

3.1 Data Pre-processing

All the available parallel and monolingual data for
the French-English language pair, including the
last versions of LDC Gigaword corpora, are nor-
malised and special characters are escaped using
the scripts provided by the shared task organisers.
Then, the corpora are tokenised and for each lan-
guage a true-case model is built on the concatena-
tion of all the data after removing duplicated sen-
tences, using the scripts included in MOSES dis-
tribution. The corpora are then true-cased before
being used to build the language and the transla-
tion models.

3.2 Language Model

To build our final language models, we first build
LMs on each corpus individually. All the monolin-
gual corpora are considered, as well as the source
or target side of the parallel corpora if the data
are not already in the monolingual data. We build
modified Kneser-Ney discounted 5-gram LMs us-
ing the SRILM toolkit for each corpus and sepa-
rate the LMs in three groups: one in-domain (con-
taining news-commentary and news crawl cor-
pora), another out-of-domain (containing Com-
mon Crawl, Europarl, UN and 109 corpora), and
the last one with LDC Gigaword LMs (the data
are kept separated by news source, as distributed
by LDC). The LMs in each group are linearly in-
terpolated based on their perplexities obtained on
the concatenation of all the development sets from
previous WMT translation tasks. The same devel-
opment corpus is used to linearly interpolate the
in-domain and LDC LMs. We finally obtain two
LMs, one containing out-of-domain data which is
only used to filter parallel data, and another one
containing in-domain data which is used to filter
parallel data, tuning the translation model weights
and at decoding time. Details about the number of
n-grams in each language model are presented in
Table 3.

in-domain and out-of-domain LMs in French and

3.3 Translation Model
Two phrase-based translation models are built
using MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) and
MOSES3, with the default alignment heuris-
tic (grow-diag-final) and bidirectional reordering
models. The first translation model is in-domain,
built with the news-commentary corpus. The sec-
ond one is built on a sample of all the other paral-
lel corpora available for the French-English lan-
guage pair. Both corpora are cleaned using the
script provided with Moses, keeping the sentences
with a length below 80 words. For the second
translation model, we used the modified Moore-
Lewis method based on the four LMs (two per
language) presented in section 3.2. The sum of
the source and target perplexity difference is com-
puted for each sentence pair of the corpus. We set
an acceptance threshold to keep a limited amount
of sentence pairs. The kept sample finally con-
tains ∼ 3.7M sentence pairs to train the translation
model. Statistics about this data sample and the
news-commentary corpus are presented in Table 4.
The test set of WMT12 translation task is used to
optimise the weights for the two translation mod-
els with the MERT algorithm. For this tuning step,
the limit of target phrases loaded per source phrase
is set to 50. We also use a reordering constraint
around punctuation marks. The same parameters
are used during the decoding of the test set.

3.4 Results

The two translation models presented in Sec-
tion 3.3 allow us to design three translation sys-
tems: one using only the in-domain model, one
using only the model built on the sub-sample of
the out-of-domain data, and one using both mod-
els by giving two decoding paths to Moses. For
this latter system, the MERT algorithm is also used
to optimise the translation model weights. Results
obtained on the WMT13 test set, measured with
the official automatic metrics, are presented in Ta-
ble 5. The submitted system is the one built on
the sub-sample of the out-of-domain parallel data.
This system was chosen during the tuning step be-
cause it reached the highest BLEU scores on the
development corpus, slightly above the combina-
tion of the two translation models.

Table 5: BLEU and TER scores obtained by our
systems. BLEUdev is the score obtained on the
development set given by MERT, while BLEU,
BLEUcased and TER are obtained on the test set
given by the submission website.

For both FR-EN and EN-FR tasks, the best re-
sults are reached by the system built on the sub-
sample taken from the out-of-domain parallel data.
Using only News-Commentary to build a trans-
lation model leads to acceptable BLEU scores,
with regards to the size of the training corpus.
When the sub-sample of the out-of-domain par-
allel data is used to build the translation model,
adding a model built on News-Commentary does
not improve the results. The difference between
these two systems in terms of BLEU score (both
cased sensitive and insensitive) indicates that sim-
ilar results can be achieved, however it appears
that the amount of sentence pairs in the sample
is large enough to limit the impact of the small
in-domain corpus parallel. Further experiments

are still required to determine the minimum sam-
ple size needed to outperform both the in-domain
system and the combination of the two translation
models.

4 German-English

In this section we describe our work on German
to English subtask. Firstly we describe the De-
pendency tree to string method which we tried but
unfortunately failed due to short of time. Secondly
we discuss the baseline system and the preprocess-
ing we performed. Thirdly a system combination
method is described.

4.1 Dependency Tree to String Method

Our original plan was to address the long distance
reordering problem in German-English transla-
tion. We use Xie’s Dependency tree to string
method(Xie et al., 2011) which obtains good re-
sults on Chinese to English translation and ex-
hibits good performance at long distance reorder-
ing as our decoder.

We use Stanford dependency parser4 to parse
the English side of the data and Mate-Tool5 for
the German side. The first set of experiments did
not lead to encouraging results and due to insuffi-
cient time, we decide to switch to other decoders,
based on statistical phrase-based and hierarchical
approaches.

4.2 Baseline System

In this section we describe the three baseline sys-
tem we used as well as the preprocessing technolo-
gies and the experiments set up.

4.2.1 Preprocessing and Corpus

We first use the normalisation scripts provided by
WMT2013 to normalise both English and Ger-
man side. Then we escape special characters on
both sides. We use Stanford tokeniser for English
and OpenNLP tokeniser6 for German. Then we
train a true-case model using with Europarl and
News-Commentary corpora, and true-case all the
corpus we used. The parallel corpus is filtered
with the standard cleaning scripts provided with

models-1.5/

216



MOSES. We split the German compound words
with jWordSplitter7.

All the corpus provided for the shared task are
used for training our translation models, while
WMT2011 and WMT2012 test sets are used to
tune the models parameters. For the LM, we
use all the monolingual data provided, including
LDC Gigaword. Each LM is trained with the
SRILM toolkit, before interpolating all the LMs
according to their weights obtained by minimiz-
ing the perplexity on the tuning set (WMT2011
and WMT2012 test sets). As SRILM can only
interpolate 10 LMs, we first interpolate a LM with
Europarl, News Commentary, News Crawl (2007-
2012, each year individually, 6 separate parts),
then we interpolate a new LM with this interpo-
lated LM and LDC Gigawords (we kept the Gi-
gaword subsets separated according to the news
sources as distributed by LDC, which leads to 7
corpus).

4.2.2 Three baseline systems
We use the data set up described by the former
subsection and build up three baseline systems,
namely PB MOSES (phrase-based), Hiero MOSES
(hierarchical) and CDEC (Dyer et al., 2010). The
motivation of choosing Hierarchical Models is to
address the German-English’s long reorder prob-
lem. We want to test the performance of CDEC and
Hiero MOSES and choose the best. PB MOSES is
used as our benchmark. The three results obtained
on the development and test sets for the three base-
line system and the system combination are shown
in the Table 6.

Development Test
PB MOSES 22.0 24.0
Hiero MOSES 22.1 24.4
CDEC 22.5 24.4
Combination 23.0 24.8

Table 6: BLEU scores obtained by our systems on
the development and test sets for the German to
English translation task.

From the Table 6 we can see that on develop-
ment set, CDEC performs the best, and its much
better than MOSES’s two decoder, but on test
set, Hiero MOSES and CDEC performs as well as
each other, and they both performs better than PB
Model.

jwordsplitter/

4.3 System Combination

We also use a word-level combination strat-
egy (Rosti et al., 2007) to combine the three trans-
lation hypotheses. To combine these systems, we
first use the Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) (Kumar
and Byrne, 2004) decoder to obtain the 5 best hy-
pothesis as the alignment reference for the Con-
fusion Network (CN) (Mangu et al., 2000). We
then use IHMM (He et al., 2008) to choose the
backbone build the CN and finally search for and
generate the best translation.

We tune the system parameters on development
set with Simple-Simplex algorithm. The param-
eters for system weights are set equal. Other pa-
rameters like language model, length penalty and
combination coefficient are chosen when we see a
good improvement on development set.

5 Conclusion

This paper presented a set of experiments con-
ducted on Spanish-English, French-English and
German-English language pairs. For the Spanish-
English pair, we have explored the use of linguistic
information to select parallel data and use this as
the training for SMT. However, the comparison of
the performance obtained using this method and
the purely statistical one (i.e. perplexity on word
forms) remains to be carried out. Another open
question regards the optimal size of the selected
data. As we have seen, minimum perplexity alone
cannot be considered an optimal metric since us-
ing a larger set, even if it has higher perplexity,
allowed us to obtain notably higher BLEU scores.
The question is then how to decide the optimal size
of parallel data to select.

For the French-English language pair, we inves-
tigated the usefulness of the small in-domain par-
allel data compared to out-of-domain parallel data
sub-sampling. We show that with a sample con-
taining ∼ 3.7M sentence pairs extracted from the
out-of-domain parallel data, it is not necessary to
use the small domain-specific parallel data. Fur-
ther experiments are still required to determine the
minimum sample size needed to outperform both
the in-domain system and the combination of the
two translation models.

Finally, for the German-English language pair,
we presents our exploitation of long ordering
problem. We compared two hierarchical models
with one phrase-based model, and we also use a
system combination strategy to further improve

217



the translation systems performance.
