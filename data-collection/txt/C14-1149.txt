Abstract

Information Extraction using multiple information sources and systems is beneficial due to multi-
source/system consolidation and challenging due to the resulting inconsistency and redundancy.
We integrate IE and truth-finding research and present a novel unsupervised multi-dimensional
truth finding framework which incorporates signals from multiple sources, multiple systems and
multiple pieces of evidence by knowledge graph construction through multi-layer deep linguistic
analysis. Experiments on the case study of Slot Filling Validation demonstrate that our approach
can find truths accurately (9.4% higher F-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding
90% truths with only one half the cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).

1 Introduction

Traditional Information Extraction (IE) techniques assess the ability to extract information from
individual documents in isolation. However, similar, complementary or conflicting information may
exist in multiple heterogeneous sources. We take the Slot Filling Validation (SFV) task of the NIST Text
Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population (TAC-KBP) track (Ji et al., 2011) as a case study. The
Slot Filling (SF) task aims at collecting from a large-scale multi-source corpus the values (“slot fillers”)
for certain attributes (“slot types”) of a query entity, which is a person or some type of organization. KBP
2013 has defined 25 slot types for persons (per) (e.g., age, spouse, employing organization) and 16 slot
types for organizations (org) (e.g., founder, headquarters-location, and subsidiaries). Some slot types
take only a single slot filler (e.g., per:birthplace), whereas others take multiple slot fillers (e.g., org:top
employees).

We call a combination of query entity, slot type, and slot filler a claim. Along with each claim, each
system must provide the ID of a source document and one or more detailed context sentences as evidence
which supports the claim. A response (i.e., a claim, evidence pair) is correct if and only if the claim is
true and the evidence supports it.

Given the responses produced by multiple systems from multiple sources in the SF task, the goal of
the SFV task is to determine whether each response is true or false. Though it’s a promising line of
research, it raises two complications: (1) different information sources may generate claims that vary

in trustability; and (2) a large-scale number of SF systems using different resources and algorithms may
generate erroneous, conflicting, redundant, complementary, ambiguously worded, or inter-dependent
claims from the same set of documents. Table 1 presents responses from four SF systems for the query
entity Ronnie James Dio and the slot type per:city of death. Systems A, B and D return Los Angeles
with different pieces of evidence 1 extracted from different information sources, though the evidence of
System D does not decisively support the claim. System C returns Atlantic City, which is neither true
nor supported by the corresponding evidence.

Such complications call for “truth finding”: determining the veracity of multiple conflicting claims
from various sources and systems. We propose a novel unsupervised multi-dimensional truth finding
framework to study credibility perceptions in rich and wide contexts. It incorporates signals from
multiple sources and systems, using linguistic indicators derived from knowledge graphs constructed
from multiple evidences using multi-layer deep linguistic analysis. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach can find truths accurately (9.4% higher F-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (find
90% truths with only one half cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).

2 Related Work & Our Novel Contributions

Most previous SFV work (e.g., (Tamang and Ji, 2011; Li and Grishman, 2013)) focused on filtering
incorrect claims from multiple systems by simple heuristic rules, weighted voting, or costly supervised
learning to rank algorithms. We are the first to introduce the truth finding concept to this task.

The “truth finding” problem has been studied in the data mining and database communities (e.g., (Yin
et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009a; Dong et al., 2009b; Galland et al., 2010; Blanco et al., 2010; Pasternack
and Roth, 2010; Yin and Tan, 2011; Pasternack and Roth, 2011; Vydiswaran et al., 2011; Ge et al.,
2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Pasternack and Roth, 2013)). Compared with the previous
work, our truth finding problem is defined under a unique setting: each response consists of a claim and
supporting evidence, automatically generated from unstructured natural language texts by a SF system.
The judgement of a response concerns both the truth of the claim and whether the evidence supports
the claim. This has never been modeled before. We mine and exploit rich linguistic knowledge from
multiple lexical, syntactic and semantic levels from evidence sentences for truth finding. In addition,
previous truth finding work assumed most claims are likely to be true. However, most SF systems have
hit a performance ceiling of 35% F-measure, and false responses constitute the majority class (72.02%)
due to the imperfect algorithms as well as the inconsistencies of information sources. Furthermore,
certain truths might only be discovered by a minority of good systems or from a few good sources. For
example, 62% of the true responses are produced only by 1 or 2 of the 18 SF systems.

1Hereafter, we refer to “pieces of evidence” with the shorthand “evidences”. Note that SF systems may include multiple
sentences as “evidence” within their responses.

3 MTM: A Multi-dimensional Truth-Finding Model

MTM Construction
A response is trustworthy if its claim is true and its evidence supports the claim. A trusted

source always supports true claims by giving convincing evidence, and a good system tends to extract
trustworthy responses from trusted sources. We propose a multi-dimensional truth-finding model (MTM)
to incorporate and compute multi-dimensional credibility scores.

Consider a set of responses R = {r1, . . . , rm} extracted from a set of sources S = {s1, . . . , sn} and
provided by a set of systems T = {t1, . . . , tl}. A heterogeneous network is constructed as shown in
Fig. 1. Let weight matrices be W rsm×n = {wrsij } and W rtm×l = {wrtik}. A link wrsij = 1 is generated
between ri and sj when response ri is extracted from source sj , and a link wrtik = 1 is generated between
ri and tk when response ri is provided by system tk.

Credibility Initialization
Each source is represented as a combination of publication venue and genre. The credibility scores

of sources S are initialized uniformly as 1n , where n is the number of sources. Given the set of systems
T = {t1, . . . , tl}, we initialize their credibility scores c0(t) based on their interactions on the predicted
responses. Suppose each system ti generates a set of responses Rti . The similarity between two systems

ti and tj is defined as similarity(ti, tj) =
|Rti∩Rtj |

log (|Rti |)+log (|Rtj |) (Mihalcea, 2004). Then we construct a
weighted undirected graph G = 〈T,E〉, where T (G) = {t1, . . . , tl} and E(G) = {〈ti, tj〉}, 〈ti, tj〉 =
similarity(ti, tj), and apply the TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea, 2004) on G to obtain c0(t).

We got negative results by initializing system credibility scores uniformly. We also got negative results
by initializing system credibility scores using system metadata, such as the algorithms and resources the
system used at each step, its previous performance in benchmark tests, and the confidence values it
produced for its responses. We found the quality of an SF system depends on many different resources
instead of any dominant one. For example, an SF system using a better dependency parser does not
necessarily produce more truths. In addition, many systems are actively being improved, rendering
previous benchmark results unreliable. Furthermore, most SF systems still lack reliable confidence
estimation.

The initialization of the credibility scores for responses relies on deep linguistic analysis of the
evidence sentences and the exploitation of semantic clues, which will be described in Section 4.

Credibility Propagation

1569



We explore the following heuristics in MTM.

HEURISTIC 1: A response is more likely to be true if derived from many trustworthy sources. A source
is more likely to be trustworthy if many responses derived from it are true.

HEURISTIC 2: A response is more likely to be true if it is extracted by many trustworthy systems. A
system is more likely to be trustworthy if many responses generated by it are true.

Based on these two heuristics we design the following credibility propagation approach to mutually
reinforce the trustworthiness of linked objects in MTM.

By extension of Co-HITS (Deng et al., 2009), designed for bipartite graphs, we develop a propagation
method to handle heterogeneous networks with three types of objects: source, response and system. Let
the weight matrices beW rs (between responses and sources) andW rt (between responses and systems),
and their transposes beW sr andW tr. We can obtain the transition probability that vertex si in S reaches
vertex rj in R at the next iteration, which can be formally defined as a normalized weight psrij =

sr
ik

such that
∑

rj∈R p

fashion.
Given the initial credibility scores c0(r), c0(s) and c0(t), we aim to obtain the refined credibility scores

c(r), c(s) and c(t) for responses, sources, and systems, respectively. Starting with sources, the update
process considers both the initial score c0(s) and the propagation from connected responses, which we
formulated as:

c(si) = (1− λrs)c0(si) + λrs
∑
rj∈R

prsji c(rj) (1)

Similarly, the propagation from responses to systems is formulated as:

c(tk) = (1− λrt)c0(tk) + λrt
∑
rj∈R

prtjkc(rj) (2)

Each response’s score c(rj) is influenced by both linked sources and systems:

c(rj) = (1− λsr − λtr)c0(rj) + λsr
∑
si∈S

psrij c(si) + λtr
∑
tk∈T

ptrkjc(tk) (3)

where λrs, λrt, λsr and λtr ∈ [0, 1]. These parameters control the preference for the propagated over
initial score for every type of random walk link. The larger they are, the more we rely on link structure2.
The propagation algorithm converges (10 iterations in our experimental settings) and a similar theoretical
proof to HITS (Peserico and Pretto, 2009) can be constructed. Algorithm 1 summarizes MTM.

4 Response Credibility Initialization

Each evidence along with a claim is expressed as a few natural language sentences that include the query
entity and the slot filler, along with semantic content to support the claim. We analyze the evidence of
each response in order to initialize that response’s credibility score. This is done using heuristic rules
defined in terms of the binary outputs of various linguistic indicators (Section 4.1).

4.1 Linguistic Indicators
We encode linguistic indicators based on deep linguistic knowledge acquisition and use them to
determine whether responses provide supporting clues or carry negative indications (Section 4.3). These
indicators make use of linguistic features on varying levels - surface form, sentential syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics - and are defined in terms of knowledge graphs (Section 4.2). We define a heuristic rule
for each slot type in terms of the binary-valued linguistic indicator outputs to yield a single binary value
(1 or 0) for each response. If a response’s linguistic indicator value is 1, the credibility score of a response
is initialized at 1.0, and 0.5 otherwise.

2We set λrs = 0.9, λsr = 0.1, λrt = 0.3 and λtr = 0.2, optimized from a development set. See Section 5.1.

4.2 Knowledge Graph Construction

A semantically rich knowledge graph is constructed that links a query entity, all of its relevant slot
filler nodes, and nodes for other intermediate elements excerpted from evidence sentences. There is one
knowledge graph per sentence.

Fig. 2 shows a subregion of the knowledge graph built from the sentence: “Mays, 50, died in his sleep
at his Tampa home the morning of June 28.”. It supports 3 claims: [Mays, per: city of death, Tampa],
[Mays, per: date of death, 06/28/2009] and [Mays, per: age, 50].

Formally, a knowledge graph is an annotated graph of entity mentions, phrases and their links. It must
contain one query entity node and one or more slot filler nodes. The annotation of a node includes its
entity type, subtype, mention type, referent entities, and semantic category (though not every node has
each type of annotation). The annotation of a link includes a dependency label and/or a semantic relation
between the two linked nodes.

The knowledge graph is constructed using the following procedure. First, we annotate the evidence
text using dependency parsing (Marneffe et al., 2006) and Information Extraction (entity, relation and
event) (Li et al., 2013; Li and Ji, 2014). Two nodes are linked if they are deemed related by one of the
annotation methods (e.g., [Mays, 50] is labeled with the dependency type amod, and [home, Tampa] is
labeled with the semantic relation located in). The annotation output is often in terms of syntactic heads.
Thus, we extend the boundaries of entity, time, and value mentions (e.g., people’s titles) to include an
entire phrase where possible. We then enrich each node with annotation for entity type, subtype and
mention type. Entity type and subtype refer to the role played by the entity in the world, the latter being
more fine-grained, whereas mention type is syntactic in nature (it may be pronoun, nominal, or proper
name). For example, “Tampa” in Fig. 2 is annotated as a Geopolitical (entity type) Population-Center
(subtype) Name (mention type) mention. Every time expression node is annotated with its normalized
reference date (e.g., “June, 28” in Fig. 2 is normalized as “06/28/2009”).

Second, we perform co-reference resolution, which introduces implicit links between nodes that refer
to the same entity. Thus, an entity mention that is a nominal or pronoun will often be co-referentially
linked to a mention of a proper name. This is important because many queries and slot fillers are
expressed only as nominal mentions or pronouns in evidence sentences, their canonical form appearing
elsewhere in the document.

Finally, we address the fact that a given relation type may be expressed in a variety of ways. For
example, “the face of ” indicates the membership relation in the following sentence: “Jennifer Dunn was
the face of the Washington state Republican Party for more than two decades.” We mined a large

number of trigger phrases for each slot type by mapping various knowledge bases, including Wikipedia
Infoboxes, Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), DBPedia (Auer et al., 2007) and YAGO (Suchanek et
al., 2007), into the Gigaword corpus3 and Wikipedia articles via distant supervision (Mintz et al.,
2009)4. Each intermediate node in the knowledge graph that matches a trigger phrase is then assigned a
corresponding semantic category. For example, “died” in Fig. 2 is labeled a Death-Trigger.

4.3 Knowledge Graph-Based Verification
We design linguistic indicators in terms of the properties of nodes and paths that are likely to be bear on
the response’s veracity. Formally, a path consists of the list of nodes and links that must be traversed
along a route from a query node to a slot filler node.

Node indicators contribute information about a query entity or slot filler node in isolation, that
may bear on the trustworthiness of the containing evidence sentence. For instance, a slot filler for the
per:date of birth slot type must be a time expression.

Node Indicators

1. Surface: Whether the slot filler includes stop words; whether it is lower cased but appears in news.
These serve as negative indicators.

2. Entity type, subtype and mention type: For example, the slot fillers for “org:top employees” must be
person names; and fillers for “org:website” must match the url format. Besides the entity extraction
system, we also exploited the entity attributes mined by the NELL system (Carlson et al., 2010)
from the KBP source corpus.

Each path contains syntactic and/or semantic relational information that may shed light on the manner
in which the query entity and slot filler are related, based on dependency parser output, IE output,
and trigger phrase labeling. Path indicators are used to define properties of the context in which
which query-entity and slot-filler are related in an evidence sentence. For example, whether the path

the knowledge base were assumed to express that relation.

1572



associated with a claim about an organization’s top employee includes a title commonly associated with
decision-making power can be roughly represented using the trigger phrases indicator.

Path Indicators

1. Trigger phrases: Whether the path includes any trigger phrases as described in Section 4.2.

2. Relations and events: Whether the path includes semantic relations or events indicative of the slot
type. For example, a “Start-Position” event indicates a person becomes a “member” or “employee”
of an organization.

3. Path length: Usually the length of the dependency path connecting a query node and a slot filler
node is within a certain range for a given slot type. For example, the path for “per:title” is usually
no longer than 1. A long dependency path between the query entity and slot filler indicates a lack
of a relationship. In the following evidence sentence, which does not entail the “per:religion”
relation between “His” and the religion “Muslim”, there is a long path (“his-poss-moment-nsubj-
came-advcl-seized-militant-acmod-Muslim”): “His most noticeable moment in the public eye came
in 1979, when Muslim militants in Iran seized the U.S. Embassy and took the Americans stationed
there hostage.”.

Detecting and making use of interdependencies among various claims is another unique challenge in
SFV. After initial response credibility scores are calculated by combining linguistic indicator values, we
identify responses that have potentially conflicting or potentially supporting slot-filler candidates. For
such responses, their credibility scores are changed in accordance with the binary values returned by the
following indicators.

Interdependent Claims Indicators

1. Conflicting slot fillers: When fillers for two claims with the same query entity and slot type appear
in the same evidence sentence, we apply an additional heuristic rule designed for the slot type in
question. For example, the following evidence sentence indicates that compared to “Cathleen P.
Black”, “Susan K. Reed” is more likely to be in a “org:top employees/members” relation with “The
Oprah Magazine” due to the latter pair’s shorter dependency path: “Hearst Magazine’s President
Cathleen P. Black has appointed Susan K. Reed as editor-in-chief of the U.S. edition of The
Oprah Magazine.”. The credibility scores are accordingly changed (or kept at) 0.5 for responses
associated with the former claim, and 1.0 for those associated with the latter.

2. Inter-dependent slot types: Many slot types are inter-dependent, such as “per:title” and
“per:employee of ”, and various family slots. After determining initial credibility scores for each
response, we check whether evidence exists for any implied claims. For example, given initial
credibility scores of 1.0 for two responses supporting the claims that (1)“David” is “per:children”
of “Carolyn Goodman” and (2)“Andrew” is “per:sibling” of “David”, we check for any responses
supporting the claim that (3)“Andrew” is “per:children” of “Carolyn Goodman”, and set their
credibility scores to 1.0. For example, a response supporting this claim included the evidence
sentence, “Dr. Carolyn Goodman, her husband, Robert, and their son, David, said goodbye to
David’s brother, Andrew.”.

Filling (SF) task. The source collection has 1,000,257 newswire documents, 999,999 web documents
and 99,063 discussion forum posts, which results in 10 different sources (combinations of publication
venues and genres) in our experiment. There are 100 queries: 50 person and 50 organization entities.
After removing redundant responses within each single system run, we use 45,950 unique responses as
the input to truth-finding. Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) human annotators manually assessed all
of these responses and produced 12,844 unique responses as ground truth. In order to compare with
state-of-the-art supervised learning methods for SFV (Tamang and Ji, 2011; Li and Grishman, 2013), we
trained a SVMs classifier 5 as a counterpart, incorporating the same set of linguistic indicators, sources
and systems as features. We picked 10% (every 10th line) to compose the development set for MTM and
the training set for the SVMs. The rest is used for blind test.

5.2 Overall Performance
Table 2 shows the overall performance of various truth finding methods on judging each response as true
or false. MTM achieves promising results and even outperforms supervised learning approach. Table 3
presents some examples ranked at the top and the bottom based on the credibility scores produced by
MTM.

We can see that majority voting across systems performs much better than random assessment, but its
accuracy is still low. For example, the true claim T5 was extracted by only one system because most
systems mistakenly identified “Briton Stuart Rose” as a person name. In comparison, MTM obtained
much better accuracy by also incorporating multiple dimensions of source and evidence information.

Method 3 using linguistic indicators alone, already achieved promising results. For example, many
claims are judged as truths through trigger phrases (T1 and T5), event extraction (T2), coreference (T4),
and node type indicators (T3). On the other hand, many claims are correctly judged as false because
their evidence sentences did not include the slot filler (F1, F4, F5) or valid knowledge paths to connect
the query entity and the slot filler (F2, F3). The performance gain (2.99% F-score) from Method 3 to
Method 5 shows the need for incorporating system and source dimensions. For example, most truths are
from news while many false claims are from newsgroups and discussion forum posts (F1, F2, F5).

The SVMs model got very low recall because of the following two reasons: (1) It ignored the inter-
dependency between multiple dimensions; (2) the negative instances are dominant in the training data,
so the model is biased towards labeling responses as false.

5.3 Truth Finding Efficiency
Table 3 shows that some truths (T1) are produced from low-ranked systems whereas some false responses
from high-ranked systems (F1, F2). Note that systems are ranked by their performance in KBP SF task.
In order to find all the truths, human assessors need to go through all the responses returned by multiple
systems. This process was proven very tedious and costly (Ji et al., 2010; Tamang and Ji, 2011).

Our MTM approach can expedite this process by ranking responses based on their credibility scores
and asking human to assess the responses with high credibility first. Traditionally, when human assess
responses, they follow an alphabetical order or system IDs in a “passive learning” style. This is set as
our baseline. For comparison, we also present the results using only linguistic indicators, using voting
in which the responses which get more votes across systems are assessed first, and the oracle method
assessing all correct responses first. Table 2 shows our model can successfully rank trustworthy responses
at high positions compared with other approaches.

5We used the LIBSVM toolkit (Chang and Lin, 2011) with Gaussian radial basis function kernel.

inefficient at finding the truths. If we employ linguistic indicators, the process can be dramatically
expedited. MTM provides further significant gains, with performance close to the Oracle. With only half
the cost of the baseline, MTM can already find 90% truths.

5.4 Enhance Individual SF Systems

Finally, as a by-product, our MTM approach can also be exploited to validate the responses from each
individual SF system based on their credibility scores. For fair comparison with the official KBP
evaluation, we use the same ground-truth in KBP2013 and standard precision, recall and F-measure
metrics as defined in (Ji et al., 2011). To increase the chance of including truths which may be particularly
difficult for a system to find, LDC prepared a manual key which was assessed and included in the final
ground truth. According to the SF evaluation setting, F-measure is computed based on the number of
unique true claims. After removing redundancy across multiple systems, there are 1,468 unique true
claims. The cutoff criteria for determining whether a response is true or not was optimized from the
development set.

Fig. 4 presents the F-measure scores of the best run from each individual SF system. We can see that
our MTM approach consistently improves the performance of almost all SF systems, in an absolute gain
range of [-1.22%, 5.70%]. It promotes state-of-the-art SF performance from 33.51% to 35.70%. Our
MTM approach provides more gains to SF systems which mainly rely on lexical or syntactic patterns
than other systems using distant supervision or logic rules.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

Truth finding has received attention from both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining
communities. NLP work has mostly explored linguistic analysis of the content, while Data Mining
work proposed advanced models in resolving conflict information from multiple sources. They have
relative strengths and weaknesses. In this paper we leverage the strengths of these two distinct,
but complementary research paradigms and propose a novel unsupervised multi-dimensional truth-
finding framework incorporating signals both from multiple sources, multiple systems and multiple
evidences based on knowledge graph construction with multi-layer linguistic analysis. Experiments on
a challenging SFV task demonstrated that this framework can find high-quality truths efficiently. In the
future we will focus on exploring more inter-dependencies among responses such as temporal and causal
relations.
