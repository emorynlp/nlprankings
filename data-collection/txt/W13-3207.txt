Abstract

We introduce a new 50-dimensional em-
bedding obtained by spectral clustering of
a graph describing the conceptual struc-
ture of the lexicon. We use the embedding
directly to investigate sets of antonymic
pairs, and indirectly to argue that func-
tion application in CVSMs requires not
just vectors but two transformations (cor-
responding to subject and object) as well.

1 Introduction

Commutativity is a fundamental property of vec-
tor space models. As soon as we encode king by
~k, queen by ~q, male by ~m, and female by ~f , if we
expect ~k ´ ~q “ ~m ´ ~f , as suggested in Mikolov
et al. (2013), we will, by commutativity, also ex-
pect ~k ´ ~m “ ~q ´ ~f ‘ruler, gender unspecified’.
When the meaning decomposition involves func-
tion application, commutativity no longer makes
sense: consider Victoria as ~qmEngland and Victor
as ~kmItaly. If the function application operator m
is simply another vector to be added to the rep-
resentation, the same logic would yield that Italy
is the male counterpart of female England. To
make matters worse, performing the same oper-
ations on Albert, ~kmEngland and Elena, ~qmItaly
would yield that Italy is the female counterpart of
male England.

Section 2 offers a method to treat antonymy in
continuous vector space models (CVSMs). Sec-
tion 3 describes a new embedding, 4lang, obtained
by spectral clustering from the definitional frame-
work of the Longman Dictionary of Contempo-
rary English (LDOCE, see Chapter 13 of McArtur
1998), and Section 4 shows how to solve the prob-
lem outlined above by treating m and n not as a
vectors but as transformations.

2 Diagnostic properties of additive
decomposition

The standard model of lexical decomposition
(Katz and Fodor, 1963) divides lexical meaning in
a systematic component, given by a tree of (gener-
ally binary) features, and an accidental component
they call the distinguisher. Figure 1 gives an ex-
ample.

Figure 1: Decomposition of lexical items to fea-
tures (Katz and Fodor, 1963)

This representation has several advantages: for
example bachelor3 ‘holder of a BA or BSc de-
gree’ neatly escapes being male by definition. We
tested which putative semantic features like GEN-
DER are captured by CVSMs. We assume that the
difference between two vectors, for antonyms, dis-
tills the actual property which is the opposite in
each member of a pair of antonyms. So, for ex-
ample, for a set of male and female words, such
as xking, queeny, xactor, actressy, etc., the differ-
ence between words in each pair should represent
the idea of gender. To test the hypothesis, we as-

sociated antonymic word pairs from the WordNet
(Miller, 1995) to 26 classes e.g. END/BEGINNING,
GOOD/BAD, . . . , see Table 1 and Table 3 for ex-
amples. The intuition to be tested is that the first
member of a pair relates to the second one in the
same way among all pairs associated to the same
feature. For k pairs ~xi, ~yi we are looking for a
common vector ~a such that

~xi ´ ~yi “ ~a (1)

Given the noise in the embedding, it would be
naive in the extreme to assume that (1) can be a
strict identity. Rather, our interest is with the best
~a which minimizes the error

Err “

||~xi ´ ~yi ´ ~a||2 (2)

As is well known, E will be minimal when ~a is
chosen as the arithmetic mean of the vectors ~xi ´
~yi. The question is simply the following: is the
minimal Em any better than what we could expect
from a bunch of random ~xi and ~yi?

Since the sets are of different sizes, we took 100
random pairings of the words appearing on either
sides of the pairs to estimate the error distribution,
computing the minima of

Errrand “

||~xi1 ´ ~y1i ´ ~a||2 (3)

For each distribution, we computed the mean
and the variance ofErrrand, and checked whether
the error of the correct pairing, Err is at least 2 or
3 σs away from the mean.

Table 2 summarizes our results for three embed-
dings: the original and the scaled HLBL (Mnih
and Hinton, 2009) and SENNA (Collobert et al.,
2011). The first two columns give the number of
pairs considered for a feature and the name of the

port the errorErr of the unpermuted arrangement,
the mean m and variance σ of the errors obtained
under random permutations, and the ratio

.

Horizontal lines divide the features to three
groups: for the upper group, r ě 3 for at least
two of the three embeddings, and for the middle
group r ě 2 for at least two.

For the features above the first line we conclude
that the antonymic relations are well captured by
the embeddings, and for the features below the
second line we assume, conservatively, that they
are not. (In fact, looking at the first column of Ta-
ble 2 suggests that the lack of significance at the
bottom rows may be due primarily to the fact that
WordNet has more antonym pairs for the features
that performed well on this test than for those fea-
tures that performed badly, but we didn’t want to
start creating antonym pairs manually.) For exam-
ple, the putative sets in Table 3 does not meet the
criterion and gets rejected.

3 Embedding based on conceptual
representation

The 4lang embedding is created in a manner that
is notably different from the others. Our input is a
graph whose nodes are concepts, with edges run-
ning from A to B iff B is used in the definition of
A. The base vectors are obtained by the spectral
clustering method pioneered by (Ng et al., 2001):
the incidence matrix of the conceptual network is
replaced by an affinity matrix whose ij-th element
is formed by computing the cosine distance of the
ith and jth row of the original matrix, and the first
few (in our case, 100) eigenvectors are used as a
basis.

Since the concept graph includes the entire
Longman Defining Vocabulary (LDV), each LDV

element wi corresponds to a base vector bi. For
the vocabulary of the whole dictionary, we sim-
ply take the Longman definition of any word w,
strip out the stopwords (we use a small list of 19
elements taken from the top of the frequency dis-
tribution), and form V pwq as the sum of the bi for
the wis that appeared in the definition of w (with
multiplicity).

We performed the same computations based on
this embedding as in Section 2: the results are pre-
sented in Table 4. Judgment columns under the
four three embeddings in the previous section and
4lang are highly correlated, see table 5.

Unsurprisingly, the strongest correlation is be-
tween the original and the scaled HLBL results.
Both the original and the scaled HLBL correlate
notably better with 4lang than with SENNA, mak-
ing the latter the odd one out.

4 Applicativity

So far we have seen that a dictionary-based em-
bedding, when used for a purely semantic task, the
analysis of antonyms, does about as well as the
more standard embeddings based on cooccurrence
data. Clearly, a CVSM could be obtained by the
same procedure from any machine-readable dic-

tionary. Using LDOCE is computationally advan-
tageous in that the core vocabulary is guaranteed
to be very small, but finding the eigenvectors for
an 80k by 80k sparse matrix would also be within
CPU reach. The main advantage of starting with a
conceptual graph lies elsewhere, in the possibility
of investigating the function application issue we
started out with.

The 4lang conceptual representation relies on a
small number of basic elements, most of which
correspond to what are called unary predicates in
logic. We have argued elsewhere (Kornai, 2012)
that meaning of linguistic expressions can be for-
malized using predicates with at most two argu-
ments (there are no ditransitive or higher arity
predicates on the semantic side). The x and y
slots of binary elements such as x has y or x kill
y, (Kornai and Makrai 2013) receive distinct la-
bels called NOM and ACC in case grammar (Fill-
more, 1977); 1 and 2 in relational grammar (Perl-
mutter, 1983); or AGENT and PATIENT in linking
theory (Ostler, 1979). The label names themselves
are irrelevant, what matters is that these elements
are not part of the lexicon the same way as the
words are, but rather constitute transformations of
the vector space.

Here we will use the binary predicate x has y
to reformulate the puzzle we started out with, an-
alyzing queen of England, king of Italy etc. in a
compositional (additive) manner, but escaping the
commutativity problem. For the sake of concrete-
ness we use the traditional assumption that it is
the king who possesses the realm and not the other
way around, but what follows would apply just as
well if the roles were reversed. What we are inter-
ested in is the asymmetry of expressions like Al-
bert has England or Elena has Italy, in contrast to
largely symmetric predicates. Albert marries Vic-
toria will be true if and only if Victoria marries
Albert is true, but from James has a martini it does
not follow that ?A martini has James.

While the fundamental approach of CVSM is
quite correct in assuming that nouns (unaries)
and verbs (binaries) can be mapped on the same
space, we need two transformations T1 and T2
to regulate the linking of arguments. A form
like James kills has James as agent, so we com-
pute V (James)`T1V (kill), while kills James is ob-
tained as V (James)`T2V (kill). The same two
transforms can distinguish agent and patient rel-
atives as in the man that killed James versus the
man that James killed.

Such forms are compositional, and in languages
that have overt case markers, even ‘surface com-
positional’ (Hausser, 1984). All input and outputs
are treated as vectors in the same space where the
atomic lexical entries get mapped, but the applica-
tive paradox we started out with goes away. As
long as the transforms T1 (n) and T2 (m) take dif-
ferent values on kill, has, or any other binary, the
meanings are kept separate.
