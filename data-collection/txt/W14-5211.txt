Abstract 

This paper enumerates the ways in which configurations of web services may complicate is-
sues of licensing language resources, whether data or tools. It details specific licensing chal-
lenges within the context of the US Language Application (LAPPS) Grid, sketches a solution 

under development and highlights ways in which that approach may be extended for other 
web service configurations.   

1 Introduction 
Growing interest in web service architectures raises questions about how such uses of language tech-
nologies and other resources interact with licensing constraints, including those that were imagined at 
an earlier time when resources and tools were more likely controlled by individual user organizations. 
Research communities that depend upon language resources (LRs) have become accustomed to, if not 
delighted with, the need to agree to certain limitations on the use of such resources. However, histori-
cally, negotiations concerning the use of LRs occur relatively infrequently. Even the largest data cen-
ters produce only a few new resources each month, generally under one of a small number of familiar 
license types. Once the resource has been acquired, integrating it in a local workflow requires time, 
creating a natural brake on the need to acquire new resources.  Grid infrastructure, on the other hand, 
promises the ability to very rapidly build pipelines from existing services and resources. The common 
vision of web service architectures is that they reduce the burden of tool integration by presenting the 
tools as services and coordinating their input and output requirements. However, absent a similar 
mechanism for coordinating the licenses that constrain LR use, Grid operators risk creating infrastruc-
ture that simultaneously ameliorates the tool integration problem while exacerbating the licensing 
problem. In the sections that follow, we describe an approach that addresses the general problem of 
documenting, communicating and partially enforcing licensing constraints within a service grid.  

2 Web Section Complexities 
Human Language Technology related web services, singly and in various configurations and clusters, 
constitute a new ecosystem in which LRs, specifically data sets and tools, may be implemented and 
combined in ways not necessarily contemplated by existing intellectual property law and contracts that 
apply to the web services’ constituent components. For example, traditional licenses may permit dis-
tribution from a data center to a licensed user organization and processing by either, but may prohibit 
distribution from the user to any additional parties. Even if it were clear that this constraint were in-
tended only to block redistribution to unlicensed users, it is not clear whether all copyright holders 
would agree that moving the same data over the web to be processed by web services should be al-
lowed. Another example involves the attribution and license requirements of shared software. In the 
past, licenses were typically described in a document included with the software source code. Attribu-
tion requirements were satisfied by listing software authors’ names in similar documents or by dis-
playing them in a header presented when the software was invoked at the commend line. However, 
users of web services may never see a source code repository or a command line.

Service grids, as just one of multiple possible configurations of web services, have different stake-
holder types: grid operators who maintain the software and servers that allow service registration and 
discovery; two types of service providers, those who provide access to data and those who provide 
access to software; and of course users. In addition to multiple stakeholder types, such Grids also have 
multiple instances of users, data providers and software providers. Where grids have been federated, 
there are also multiple grid operators. Each of these stakeholders may have different desires relative to 
the behavior of web services, most importantly where intellectual property protection is concerned. 
Beyond the obvious conflict that users typically want fewer restrictions on resources than providers, 
grid operators or service providers may require compensation, grid operators may wish to track and 
record user behavior, service providers may demand attribution, limit use of their services to the non-
commercial sectors and may wish to exploit data that passes through their service nodes for purposes 
of further system development or evaluation. 

In addition to multiple stakeholder types and multiple instances of each, grids also combine these 
data and software services in various combinations that affect licensing in a variety of ways. Figure 1 
summarizes three simple cases. In the first, users direct data they own or control through an external 
service controlled by a second party. In the second case, both the data and the processing are con-
trolled by a single entity who is not the user. In the third case, one external party controls the data 
while another controls the software. In each of these cases, the interaction of multiple parties may 
complicate licensing by introducing new and idiosyncratic constraints.  

 

 
Figure 1: Simple Configurations of Web Services 

Figure 2 sketches more complex cases in which data, controlled by the user or not, passes through 
multiple services controlled by independent parties. Examples of the first two use cases might include 
speech translation, configured as speech transcription followed by translation of the transcript text, in 
which the input speech is controlled by the users (e.g. in voicemail transcription) or is controlled by an 
independent party (e.g. translation of broadcast news). In the third case, not only are there multiple 
services operating on the same data, but these services are configured as generic engines that require 
models provided by other parties to operate on specific languages. One example might be language 
identification engines that accept new models in order to recognize new languages.  

 

 
Figure 2: More Complex Web Service Configurations 

Web service grids further complicate licensing because no provider or user controls the entire eco-
system. Grid operators, software service providers, data providers and users may all be distinct from 94



one another. Indeed in the future imagined by grid proponents, there are many software and data pro-
viders and even more users on any one grid, and many grids federated to permit users of one to access 
services on another. In such an environment, it is clear that each user, provider and grid operator may 
act independently and sometimes at cross-purposes to others.  

3 Approaches to Grid Licensing 
One can imagine multiple approaches to harmonizing this ecosystem. First, one might choose to try 

to constrain service and data providers insisting that as a condition of participation in the grid, they 
must agree to make their services available to specific classes of users under pre-defined terms. The 
NICT Language Grid did this by establishing a Service Grid Agreement. However, it is equally possi-
ble to construct a grid in which service providers are not the owners or developers of all the software 
they use to provide services. For example, within the US NSF-funded Language Application Grid, two 
of the principle service providers, Brandeis University and Vassar College, have created services 
based on third party software such as NLTK (Bird, Klein, Loper 2009) and the Stanford Toolkit 
(Manning et al., 2014). In this case, the service providers do not own the tools and thus cannot enter 
into agreements about the terms under which the software underlying their service may be used. As a 
solution, one might imagine providing software services under whatever licenses the underlying soft-
ware has imposed and then constrain the users to comply with these terms. A third alternative would 
be to assume that all parties take responsibility for their own actions during grid operations and to im-
pose no controls over either providers or users. The fourth option is of course to constrain both provid-
ers and users. In this paper we will argue for this last hybrid. 

Descriptions of the licensing approaches used by existing grids are scant, only rarely presented in 
published works, occasionally described on project web pages and sometimes left to be understood 
from the licenses used. Piperidis (2012) describes META-SHARE as a membership based infrastruc-
ture in which resources are available under one of four license types. While META-SHARE encour-
ages within-network sharing with the fewest constraints possible, the four license types permit a range 
of constraints including those expressed by the Creative Commons1 licenses and also allow for fees. 
META-SHARE servers harvest licensing elements from contributed services and present them to users 
as a table, in fact the model for our Table 2 below. The Language Grid2 developed by NICT, includes 
license text, where available, in the description of each resource it provides. The Language Grid also 
provides a tool for composing workflows. Upon execution of a given workflow, the Grid displays the 
sequence of licenses that affect the use of the workflow component tools and data. Bosca et al. (2012) 
describe LinguaGrid3 as “open to different operators (Universities, Research institutes, Companies) 
with configurable services access policies: free, restricted to registered users, research or commercial 
licensing”. LinguaGrid is built upon the grid infrastructure developed by NICT and presumably uses 
the same approach to license management. CLARIN4 documentation describes a rich set of licensing 
options for service providers. Many have equivalents in the Creative Common licenses though 
CLARIN enriches this set by allowing providers to require that published papers based on CLARIN 
resources are reported to the providers and that derived resources are deposited to CLARIN, a specific 
variant of the share-alike constraint. CLARIN also provides a legal help desk to answer questions 
about licensing among other issues. The LAPPS Grid has developed an explicit model for license 
management that is membership based, allows for a wide range of license types and fees, presents a 
summary of license constraints and actual licenses prior to workflow execution and even prevents the 
subset of license violations that can be detected at execution time. 

Grid architecture constitutes a new approach to combining LRs. Providing clear documentation of 
the terms under which providers and users operate offers peace-of-mind to resource providers and 
clarity to service users either of which group may otherwise opt out of an initiative whose risks are 
incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is probable that for service providers who do not own the 
underlying data or software, imposing constraints on users may be not only a wise idea, but also a le-
gal or contractual obligation. It is important to note that many license terms constrain behavior that

may occur long after web services have run, for example commercial use of output. Therefore, grid 
operators are not in a position to strictly enforce license terms. They may however, block obvious and 
immediate violations of licenses, make users aware of constraints that affect behavior and secure their 
agreement to relevant terms. 

4 Dimensions of Constraints on Language Resource Use 
The licenses that constrain the behavior of language resource users, and thus grid users, vary along 

a number of dimensions, the first of which pertains to the object being licensed. Software licenses typ-
ically constrain the use of software and derivative works. Data licenses similarly constrain the use of 
the data and derivative works. However, derivative work, to the extent that the term is defined at all, 
seems to refer to other data in the case of data licenses, and to other software in the case of software 
licenses. Importantly, none of the software licenses reviewed for this paper made a clear attempt to 
constrain the use of their output, which is often data, while many data licenses do constrain the use of 
processed data. 

The LRs used in web services may be owned by the user, may be in the public domain or may be 
copyrighted by someone other than the user. Copyrighted LRs may be constrained as to use or as to 
user. The commonest use constraints typically prevent commercial use and the creation or commercial 
use of derivative works. They may prevent distribution of the LR or derivative works or they may re-
quire that products whose creation relied upon the licensed resource be shared under the same terms 
(also known as the Share Alike or Viral Copyleft constraint). They may require that users provide at-
tribution of LR creators and/or cite the resource or a specific reference paper. Finally, any license may 
include other terms that have not been described here because they constitute the long tail of uncom-
mon constraints. To give just one example, we are aware of at least one corpus that requires that recip-
ients receive certification from their local Institutional Review Board that they have been trained in the 
treatment of human subjects. 

An additional complexity in licensing constraints defined by use is that neither copyright law nor 
the software or data licenses reviewed for this paper provide a bright line to distinguish derivative 
works (which are typically constrained by such licenses) from transformative uses (which are typically 
not). Within HLT, we can imagine simple and stereotyped cases. Given one hour of audio recorded 
from a copyrighted news broadcast, the transcript of the audio and its translation into any language are 
derivative works subject, at least in the US, to copyright and any licensing constraints imposed on the 
audio. On the other hand, a unigram frequency list based on the transcript or translation is a highly 
transformed work generally considered immune to those same limitations. 

License constraints related to the user, rather than the use, typically prevent commercial organiza-
tions from accessing the resource. In at least some cases, the intent of this constraint is to encourage 
potential commercial users to negotiate directly with the LR provider for access under terms that in-
clude a fee structure. More generally, the user types distinguished by LR licenses include academic 
and not-for-profit organizations, governments and commercial organizations. In some instances, com-
panies engaged in pre-commercial technology development may be treated differently. In addition, a 
model of licensing constraints must distinguish organizations that have executed a specific license re-
quired by a LR from those that have not. Organizations may be licensed by enumeration or by fea-
tures. As an example of licensing by enumeration, the Linguistic Data Consortium maintains databases 
of all users, all licenses required by their LRs and a table of which user organizations have executed 
each license. However, users may also be considered licensed if they possess certain features, for ex-
ample, if they are non-profit organizations.   

One use that seems to have been overlooked by existing grid licenses is the ability of service pro-
viders to derive benefit from the processing they offer. For example, one could imagine a translation 
service that not only outputs translations for submitted input text but also computes n-grams from that 
text and uses them to improve its source language models. Were this practice allowed, it would further 
complicate licensing within web service architectures where it is not always clear that the user who 
submits data for processing has the authority to permit the service providers to exploit that data.

5 Combining Licensing Constraints 
Having enumerated the dimensions along which LR use may be constrained, we can easily imagine 

some use cases in which specific workflows should be prohibited or at least flagged. The obvious case 
would be one in which some input data required a specific license that the potential user had not exe-
cuted. Another example would be the case in which some processing service required a fee that the 
potential user had not yet paid. Similarly a commercial organization seeking to process data that is 
only available under a no-commercial-use license should be prevented or at least warned by the ser-
vice grid. At least within the United States – and this probably holds for many other jurisdictions – the 
law that governs copyright and the individual licenses commonly associated with LRs are relatively 
underspecified on a number of questions relevant to web services. For example, within US copyright 
law the only functional definition of “fair use” is a description of the four dimensions along which fair 
use claims are to be evaluated. Given this situation, we should not be surprised that current bodies of 
law offer no calculus for combining constraints imposed on the multiple LRs that may support any 
given workflow.  

For example if a specific pipeline makes use of two data resources, one of which permits commer-
cial use while the other prohibits it, what constraints apply to the final output? To make this concrete, 
consider a pipeline in which a language identification service detects the language of an input text and 
routes it to an appropriate machine translation service. If the language identification service relies on a 
data set available under a no-commercial-use license but neither the input text nor the translation en-
gine are similarly constrained, may the user sell access to the translation? Our tendency may be to 
think this use is acceptable. Would we feel the same if the translation engine relied on data that im-
posed the no-commercial-use constraint? What if the input text was available under a no-commercial-
use license but no other component in the pipeline constrained use? While we may have intuitions 
about acceptable use in these cases, there is no body of law, nor much precedent, to support one or 
another interpretation.  

6 The Language Application Grid 
In order to work through a possible solution, we now consider the specific tool and data resources 

implemented in the US NSF funded Language Applications Grid. To date, the LAPPS Grid has used 
27 unique software packages (programs, toolkits, APIs, libraries) that are available under the 9 unique 
licenses summarized in Table 1.

These many license have in common a relatively small number of constraint types and values as sum-

However, as one considers the complexity of licensing with the grid, it is important to also consider 
the limitations on the role of grid operators relative to prior practice. Traditional language resource 
distribution, before the era of web services, treated licensing constraints variably. For example, where 
users are required to pay a fee in order to access a LR, that fee is normally required in advance. If a 
resource requires a specific license to be executed, some data providers may withhold the resource 
until the agreement is signed either on paper or via a click-through agreement. Others may provide the 
license with the LR and a statement that by accessing the data, the user is agreeing to the terms of the 
license. However, beyond these cases, there is little attempt to block access to a resource until licens-
ing terms have been satisfied. Indeed many licensing terms constrain future action and thus cannot be 
required as a condition of access. For example, the constraints on redistribution, use of derivative 
works, attribution and share alike all affect action that necessarily takes place after the LR has been 
accessed. Given these limitations, we expect that the ability of any web service policy or procedure to 
enforce such constraints is similarly limited. Thus, within the LAPPS Grid, we distinguish two types 
of enforcement of licensing constraints, requirement and notification as summarized in Table 4. In a 

98



small number of cases, we block the execution of a service pipeline if required conditions are not met 
but otherwise accumulate notifications that we present to users before allowing them to execute the 
pipeline. We must also note here that no summary of licensing terms can legally stand-in for the actual 
license executed so that any approach we use must also make reference to the actual licenses.

7 A Grid Licensing Model 
Putting together the discussion to date, we propose the model in Figure 3 for managing licenses within 
a service grid framework. Specifically, this model benefits from features already implemented for the 
LAPPS Grid while imposing some limitations of its own. First, within the LAPPS Grid, users build 
pipelines using one of two workflow management tools developed by the project. The Composer, de-
scribed in greater detail in Ide et al. 2014, displays for the user the set of available tool and data ser-
vices allowing the user to select one or more, determine their order of application and even create 
branches to allow two or more tools of the same types to operate on the data in parallel so that their 
performance may be evaluated and compared. The Composer takes note of the input and output re-
quirements of each tool in the chain and, in complex workflows, correctly routes data to appropriate 
processing services. The workflow Planner, still under development, allows the user to specify input 
data and desired output and then uses its knowledge of each tool’s inputs and outputs to construct a 
pipeline that produces the desired result. The licensing model makes use of these workflow managers. 
First we require that any service registered in the grid only respond to requests from one of the work-
flow managers. This keeps the grid ecosystem closed and prevents a user from directing output of one 
of the services outside the grid where one cannot monitor use. We also require that service providers 
register the licenses that govern use of their services. The user initiates a session with the workflow 
managers by authenticating themselves. As the user builds a workflow, the manager requests from 
each service the list of constraints imposed. As in Table 2 and Table 4, these may be requirements for 
a fee or the execution of a specific license or they may be notifications of the future behavior expected 
of users. The workflow manager also queries a local database or API connected to a service provider 
or data center to determine whether the user has satisfied the payment and specific license require-
ments. If not, the pipeline is blocked. Otherwise the user continues to build the pipeline while the 
manager accumulates a summary of the click-through licenses required and general licensing con-
straints imposed. Before the user can execute the pipeline, the workflow manager presents a summary 
of the licenses required, with links to the original text, as well as a summary of the general constraints 
imposed. The user must click to agree to the terms before processing will begin. For each service that 
provides processing, the workflow manager also displays any attribution requirements or license 
statements normally displayed at the command line or in a README file since these are generally 
invisible to a grid user. 

Of course, this model only works if the grid or other collection of web services constitutes a closed 
system where a small number of management programs can control the inputs and outputs to each 
process. Naturally, the grid licensing model is unable to resolve issues that remain unresolved in gen-
eral such as the lack of a bright line distinguishing derivative and transformative use of linguistic data 
and tools. In such cases it takes a legally conservative approach, acting for example as though as uses 
may be considered derivative and issuing appropriate warnings.

8 Conclusion 
We discussed the features of web service architectures that complicate the licensing of LRs, including 
data and tools, both by introducing ecosystems not contemplated during the drafting of relevant intel-
lectual property law and the development of the LR and by creating complex workflows not entirely 
under the control of any single user. We sketched the dimension along which licenses constrain LR 
use. Making the discussion more concrete, we then enumerated the license and constraint types that 
affect the resources used to build the US LAPPS Grid. Finally, we sketched a model for protecting 
intellectual property via the use of workflow managers while allowing users with appropriate creden-
tials to construct complex pipelines. This approach relies on the closed nature of the service grid and 
would need to be extended in cases where the pipeline could combine web services without bounds.
