Abstract

Are word-level affect lexicons useful in de-
tecting emotions at sentence level? Some prior
research finds no gain over and above what is
obtained with ngram features—arguably the
most widely used features in text classifica-
tion. Here, we experiment with two very dif-
ferent emotion lexicons and show that even in
supervised settings, an affect lexicon can pro-
vide significant gains. We further show that
while ngram features tend to be accurate, they
are often unsuitable for use in new domains.
On the other hand, affect lexicon features tend
to generalize and produce better results than
ngrams when applied to a new domain.

1 Introduction

Automatically identifying emotions expressed in
text has a number of applications, including track-
ing customer satisfaction (Bougie et al., 2003), de-
termining popularity of politicians and government
policies (Mohammad and Yang, 2011), depression
detection (Osgood and Walker, 1959; Pestian et
al., 2008; Matykiewicz et al., 2009; Cherry et al.,
2012), affect-based search (Mohammad, 2011), and
improving human-computer interaction (Velásquez,
1997; Ravaja et al., 2006).

Supervised methods for classifying emotions ex-
pressed in a sentence tend to perform better than un-
supervised ones. They use features such as unigrams
and bigrams (Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakow-
icz, 2007; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Chaffar and
Inkpen, 2011). For example, a system can learn that
the word excruciating tends to occur in sentences la-

beled with sadness, and use this word as a feature in
classifying new sentences.

Approaches that do not rely on supervised train-
ing with sentence-level annotations often use affect
lexicons. An affect lexicon, in its simplest form, is
a list of words and associated emotions and senti-
ments. For example, the word excruciating may be
associated with the emotions of sadness and fear.
Note that such lexicons are at best indicators of
probable emotions, and that in any given sentence,
the full context may suggest that a completely differ-
ent emotion is being expressed. Therefore, it is un-
clear how useful such word-level emotion lexicons
are for detecting emotions and meanings expressed
in sentences, especially since supervised systems re-
lying on tens of thousands of unigrams and bigrams
can produce results that are hard to surpass. For ex-
ample, it is possible that classifiers can learn from
unigram features alone that excruciating is associ-
ated with sadness and fear.

In this paper, we investigate whether word–
emotion association lexicons can provide gains in
addition to those already provided by ngram fea-
tures. We conduct experiments with different affect
lexicons and determine their usefulness in this ex-
trinsic task. We also conduct experiments to deter-
mine how portable the ngram features and the emo-
tion lexicon features are to a new domain.

2 Affect Lexicons

The WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Val-
itutti, 2004) has a few thousand words annotated
for associations with a number of affect categories.
This includes 1536 words annotated for associations

with six emotions considered to be the most basic—
joy, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise (Ek-
man, 1992).1 It was created by manually identifying
the emotions of a few seed words and then label-
ing all their WordNet synonyms with the same emo-
tion. Affective Norms for English Words has plea-
sure (happy–unhappy), arousal (excited–calm), and
dominance (controlled–in control) ratings for 1034
words.2 Mohammad and Turney (2010; 2012) com-
piled manual annotations for eight emotions (the six
of Ekman, plus trust and anticipation) as well as
for positive and negative sentiment.3 The lexicon
was created by crowdsourcing to Mechanical Turk.
This lexicon, referred to as the NRC word-emotion
lexicon (NRC-10) version 0.91, has annotations for
about 14,000 words.4

We evaluate the affect lexicons that have annota-
tions for the Ekman emotions—the WordNet Affect
Lexicon and the NRC-10. We also experimented
with a subset of NRC-10, which we will call NRC-
6, that has annotations for only the six Ekman emo-
tions (no trust and anticipation annotations; and no
positive and negative sentiment annotations).

3 Sentence Classification System

We created binary classifiers for each of the six
emotions using Weka (Hall et al., 2009).5 For
example, the Fear–NotFear classifier determined
whether a sentence expressed fear or not. We exper-
imented with Logistic Regression (le Cessie and van
Houwelingen, 1992) and Support Vector Machines
(SVM). We used binary features that captured the
presence or absence of unigrams and bigrams. We
also used integer-valued affect features that captured
the number of word tokens in a sentence associated
with different affect labels in the affect lexicon be-
ing used.6 For example, if a sentence has two joy
words and one surprise word, then the joy feature
has value 2, surprise has value 1, and all remaining
affect labels have value 0.

3.1 Training and Testing within domain

As a source of labeled data for training and testing,
we used the SemEval-2007 Affective Text corpus
wherein newspaper headlines were labeled with the
six Ekman emotions by six annotators (Strapparava
and Mihalcea, 2007). For each headline–emotion
pair, the annotators gave scores from 0 to 100 indi-
cating how strongly the headline expressed the emo-
tion. The inter-annotator agreement as determined
by calculating the Pearson’s product moment corre-
lation (r) between the scores given by each anno-
tator and the average of the other five annotators is
shown in Table 1. For our experiments, we consid-
ered scores greater than 25 to indicate that the head-
line expresses the corresponding emotion.

The dataset was created for an unsupervised com-
petition, and consisted of 250 sentences of trial data
and 1000 sentences of test data. We will refer to
them as the 250-headlines and the 1000-headlines
datasets respectively. In order to use these datasets
in a supervised framework, we follow Chaffar and
Inkpen (2011) and report results under two settings:
(1) ten-fold cross-validation on the 1000-headlines
and (2) using the 1000-headlines as training data and
testing on the 250-headlines dataset.

Table 2 shows results obtained by classifiers when
trained on the 1000-headlines text and tested on
the 250-headlines text. The rows under I give a
breakdown of results obtained by the EmotionX–
NotEmotionX classifiers when using both n-gram
and NRC-10 affect features (where X is one of the
six Ekman emotions). gold is the number of head-
lines expressing a particular emotion X . right is

sults obtained using only ngrams, and IV shows the
results obtained by a system that guesses randomly.7

Table 3 gives results obtained by cross-validation
on the 1000-headlines dataset. The results in Tables
2 and 3 lead to the following observations:
• On both datasets, using the NRC-10 in addition

to the ngram features gives significantly higher
scores than using ngrams alone. This was not
true, however, for WordNet affect.

• Using NRC-10 alone obtains almost as good
scores as those obtained by the ngrams in the
250-headlines test data, even though the num-
ber of affect features (10) is much smaller than
the ngram features (many thousands).

• Using annotations for all ten affect labels in
NRC-10 instead of just the Ekman six gives mi-
nor improvements.

• The automatic methods perform best for
classes with the high inter-annotator agreement
(sadness and fear), and worst for classes with
the low agreement (surprise and disgust) (Ta-
ble 1).

We used the Fisher Exact Test and a confidence in-
terval of 95% for all precision and recall significance
testing reported in this paper. Experiments with sup-
port vector machines gave slightly lower F-scores
than those obtained with logistic regression, but all
of the above observations held true even in those ex-
periments (we do not show those results here due to
the limited space available).

pressing an emotion X or not will get half of the gold instances
right. Further, it will mark half of all the instances as expressing
emotion X . For ALL, right = gold

Table 4: The coefficients of the features learned by logis-
tic regression for the Anger–NoAnger classifier.

The coefficients of the features learned by the lo-
gistic regression algorithm are weights that indicate
how strongly the individual features influence the
decision of the classifier. The affect features of the
Anger–NoAnger classifier learned from the 1000-
sentences dataset and NRC-10 are shown in Table 4.
We see that the anger feature has the highest weight
and plays the biggest role in predicting whether a
sentence expresses anger or not. The negative sen-
timent feature is also a strong indicator of anger.
Similarly, the weights for other emotion classifiers
were consistent with our intuition: joy had the high-
est weight in the Joy–NotJoy classifier, sadness in
the Sadness–NotSadness classifier, and so on.

3.2 Testing on data from another domain

Hand-labeled training data is helpful for automatic
classifiers, but it is usually not available for most do-
mains. We now describe experiments to determine
how well the classifiers and features cope with train-
ing on data from one source domain and testing on a
new target domain. We will use the 1000-headlines
dataset from the previous section as the source do-
main training data. As test data we will now use sen-
tences compiled by Aman and Szpakowicz (2007)
from blogs. This dataset has 4090 sentences anno-
tated with the Ekman emotions by four annotators.
The inter-annotator agreement for the different emo-
tions ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 Cohen’s kappa.

Table 5 shows the results. Observe that now the
ngrams perform quite poorly; the NRC-10 affect
features perform significantly better, despite each
sentence being represented by only ten features. The
rows in II give a breakdown of results obtained by
individual EmotionX–NotEmotionX classifiers. Ob-
serve that the distribution of instances in this blog
dataset (gold column) is different from that in the
1000-headlines (Table 1). The larger proportion of
neutral instances in the blog data compared to 1000-
headlines, leads to a much lower precision and F-

score of the randomly-guessing classifier on the blog
dataset (row IV) than on the 1000-headlines dataset.

Nonetheless, the NRC-10 affect features obtain
significantly higher results than the random base-
line. The ngram features (row III), on the other
hand, lead to scores lower than the random base-
line. This suggests that they are especially domain-
sensitive. Manual inspection of the regression coef-
ficients confirms the over-fitting of ngram features.
The overfitting is less for affect features, probably
because of the small number of features.

4 Conclusions

Even though context plays a significant role in the
meaning and emotion conveyed by a word, we
showed that using word-level affect lexicons can
provide significant improvements in sentence-level
emotion classification—over and above those ob-
tained by unigrams and bigrams alone. The gains
provided by the lexicons may be correlated with
their sizes. The NRC lexicon has fourteen times as
many entries as the WordNet Affect lexicon and it
gives significantly better results.

We also showed that ngram features tend to
be markedly domain-specific and work well only
within domains. On the other hand, affect lexicon
features worked significantly better than ngram fea-
tures when applied to a new domain for which there
was no training data.
