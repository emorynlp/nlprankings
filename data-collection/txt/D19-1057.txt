Abstract

As a fundamental NLP task, semantic role la-
beling (SRL) aims to discover the semantic
roles for each predicate within one sentence.
This paper investigates how to incorporate
syntactic knowledge into the SRL task effec-
tively. We present different approaches of en-
coding the syntactic information derived from
dependency trees of different quality and rep-
resentations; we propose a syntax-enhanced
self-attention model and compare it with other
two strong baseline methods; and we con-
duct experiments with newly published deep
contextualized word representations as well.
The experiment results demonstrate that with
proper incorporation of the high quality syn-
tactic information, our model achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for the Chinese
SRL task on the CoNLL-2009 dataset.

1 Introduction

The task of semantic role labeling (SRL) is to rec-
ognize arguments for a given predicate in one sen-
tence and assign labels to them, including “who”
did “what” to “whom”, “when”, “where”, etc. Fig-
ure 1 is an example sentence with both semantic
roles and syntactic dependencies. Since the nature
of semantic roles is more abstract than the syntac-
tic dependencies, SRL has a wide range of appli-
cations in different areas, e.g., text classification
(Sinoara et al., 2016), text summarization (Gen-
est and Lapalme, 2011; Khan et al., 2015), recog-
nizing textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2007;
Stern and Dagan, 2014), information extraction
(Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen
and Lapata, 2007; Yih et al., 2016), and so on.

Traditionally, syntax is the bridge to reach se-
mantics. However, along with the popularity of the
end-to-end models in the NLP community, various
recent studies have been discussing the necessity
of syntax in the context of SRL. For instance, He

Figure 1: An example of one sentence with its syntac-
tic dependency tree and semantic roles. Arcs above the
sentence are semantic role annotations for the predicate
“鼓励 (encourage)” and below the sentence are syntac-
tic dependency annotations of the whole sentence. The
meaning of this sentence is “China encourages foreign
merchants to invest in agriculture”.

et al. (2017) have observed that only good syntax
helps with the SRL performance. Xia et al. (2019)
have explored what kind of syntactic information
or structure is better suited for the SRL model.
Cai et al. (2018) have compared syntax-agnostic
and syntax-aware approaches and claim that the
syntax-agnostic model surpasses the syntax-aware
ones.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the rela-
tionship between the syntactic dependency infor-
mation and the SRL performance. In particular,
we investigate the following four aspects: 1) Qual-
ity of the syntactic information: whether the per-
formance of the syntactic parser output affects the
SRL performance; 2) Representation of the syn-
tactic information: how to represent the syntactic
dependencies to better preserve the original struc-
tural information; 3) Incorporation of the syntac-
tic information: at which layer of the SRL model
and how to incorporate the syntactic information;
and 4) the Relationship with other external re-
sources: when we append other external resources
into the SRL model, whether their contributions
are orthogonal to the syntactic dependencies.

For the main architecture of the SRL model,
many neural-network-based models use BiLSTM



617

as the encoder (e.g., Cai et al. (2018); Li et al.
(2018); He et al. (2018)), while recently self-
attention-based encoder becomes popular due to
both the effectiveness and the efficiency (Vaswani
et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2017; Strubell et al., 2018).
By its nature, the self-attention-based model di-
rectly captures the relation between words in the
sentence, which is convenient to incorporate syn-
tactic dependency information. Strubell et al.
(2018) replace one attention head with pre-trained
syntactic dependency information, which can be
viewed as a hard way to inject syntax into the
neural model. Enlightened by the machine trans-
lation model proposed by Shaw et al. (2018), we
introduce the Relation-Aware method to incorpo-
rate syntactic dependencies, which is a softer way
to encode richer structural information.

Various experiments for the Chinese SRL on
the CoNLL-2009 dataset are conducted to evalu-
ate our hypotheses. From the empirical results, we
observe that: 1) The quality of the syntactic infor-
mation is essential when we incorporate structural
information into the SRL model; 2) Deeper inte-
gration of the syntactic information achieves bet-
ter results than the simple concatenation to the in-
puts; 3) External pre-trained contextualized word
representations help to boost the SRL performance
further, which is not entirely overlapping with the
syntactic information.

In summary, the contributions of our work are:

• We present detailed experiments on differ-
ent aspects of incorporating syntactic infor-
mation into the SRL model, in what quality,
in which representation and how to integrate.

• We introduce the relation-aware approach to
employ syntactic dependencies into the self-
attention-based SRL model.

• We compare our approach with previous
studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results
with and without external resources, i.e., in
the so-called closed and open settings.

2 Related work

Traditional semantic role labeling task (Gildea
and Jurafsky, 2002) presumes that the syntactic
structure of the sentence is given, either being
a constituent tree or a dependency tree, like in
the CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and Màrquez,
2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajič et al., 2009).

Recent neural-network-based approaches can be
roughly categorized into two classes: 1) making
use of the syntactic information (FitzGerald et al.,
2015; Roth and Lapata, 2016; Qian et al., 2017;
Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017), and 2) pure end-
to-end learning from tokens to semantic labels,
e.g., Zhou and Xu (2015); Marcheggiani et al.
(2017).

Roth and Lapata (2016) utilize an LSTM model
to obtain embeddings from the syntactic depen-
dency paths; while Marcheggiani and Titov (2017)
construct Graph Convolutional Networks to en-
code the dependency structure. Although He et al.
(2017)’s approach is a pure end-to-end learning,
they have included an analysis of adding syntac-
tic dependency information into English SRL in
the discussion section. Cai et al. (2018) have
compared syntax-agnostic and syntax-aware ap-
proaches and Xia et al. (2019) have compared dif-
ferent ways to represent and encode the syntactic
knowledge.

In another line of research, Tan et al. (2017) uti-
lize the Transformer network for the encoder in-
stead of the BiLSTM. Strubell et al. (2018) present
a novel and effective multi-head self-attention
model to incorporate syntax, which is called LISA
(Linguistically-Informed Self-Attention). We fol-
low their approach of replacing one attention head
with the dependency head information, but use a
softer way to capture the pairwise relationship be-
tween input elements (Shaw et al., 2018).

For the datasets and annotations of the SRL
task, most of the previous research focuses on
1) PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and Nom-
Bank (Meyers et al., 2004) annotations, i.e., the
CoNLL 2005 (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005) and
CoNLL 2009 (Hajič et al., 2009) shared tasks; 2)
OntoNotes annotations (Weischedel et al., 2011),
i.e., the CoNLL 2005 and CoNLL 2012 datasets
and more; 3) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998)
annotations. For the non-English languages,
not all of them are widely available. Apart
from these, in the broad range of semantic pro-
cessing, other formalisms non-exhaustively in-
clude abstract meaning representation (Banarescu
et al., 2013), universal decompositional seman-
tics (White et al., 2016), and semantic dependency
parsing (Oepen et al., 2015). Abend and Rap-
poport (2017) give a better overview of various se-
mantic representations. In this paper, we primarily
work on the Chinese and English datasets from the

3 Approaches

In this section, we first introduce the basic archi-
tecture of our self-attention-based SRL model, and
then present two different ways to encode the syn-
tactic dependency information. Afterwards, we
compare three approaches to incorporate the syn-
tax into the base model, concatenation to the in-
put embedding, LISA, and our proposed relation-
aware method.

3.1 The Basic Architecture

Our basic model is a multi-head self-attention-
based model, which is effective in SRL task as pre-
vious work proves (Tan et al., 2018). The model
consists of three layers: the input layer, the en-
coder layer and the prediction layer as shown in
Figure 2.

3.1.1 Input Layer
The input layer contains three types of embed-
dings: token embedding, predicate embedding,
and positional embedding.

Token Embedding includes word embedding,
part-of-speech (POS) tag embedding.

Predicate Embedding has been proposed by
He et al. (2017), and its binary embedding is used
to indicate the predicates indices in each sentence.

Positional Embedding encodes the order of the
input word sequence. We follow Vaswani et al.
(2017) to use time positional embedding, which is
formulated as follows:

PE(t, 2i) = sin(t/100002i/d)

PE(t, 2i+ 1) = cos(t/100002i/d)
(1)

where t is the position, imeans the dimension, and
d is the dimension of the model input embedding.

3.1.2 Encoder Layer
The self-attention block is almost the same as
Transformer encoder proposed by Vaswani et al.
(2017). Specifically the Transformer encoder con-
tains a feed-forward network (FFN) and a multi-
head attention network. The former is followed by
the latter. In this work, we exchange their order,
so that the multi-head attention module is moved
behind the FFN module1 as Figure 2 shows.

FFN The FFN module consists of two affine
layers with a ReLU activation in the middle. For-
mally, we have the following equation:

FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)

Multi-Head Attention The basic attention
mechanism used in the multi-head attention func-
tion is called “Scaled Dot-Product Attention”,
which is formulated as follows:

Attention(Q,K, V ) = softmax(
QKT√
dk

)V (3)

where Q is queries, K is keys, and V is values.
In the multi-head attention setting, it first maps

the input matrix X into queries, keys and values
matrices by using h different learned linear pro-
jections. Taking queries Q as an example:

LinearQi (X) = XW
Q
i + b

Q
i (4)

where 0 ≤ i < h. Keys and values use similar
projections.

On each of these projections, we perform the
scaled dot-product attention in parallel. These
parallel output values are concatenated and once
again projected into the final values. Equation 5
depicts the above operations.

MultiHead(X) = Concat(head1, . . . , headh)W
O (5)

1Changing the order delivers better empirical results (Tan
et al., 2018) and our experiments show the same trend. The
details of the experiments are not listed in this paper.

(6)

More details about multi-head attention can be
found in Vaswani et al. (2017).

Add & Norm We employ a residual connection
to each module, followed by a layer normalization
(Ba et al., 2016) operation. The output of each
module is formulated as

x = LayerNorm(x+ f(x)) (7)

where f(x) is implemented by each above mod-
ule.

3.2 Representation of the Syntactic
Dependencies

3.2.1 Dependency Head & Relation
The most intuitive way to represent syntactic in-
formation is to use individual dependency rela-
tions directly, like dependency head and depen-
dency relation label, denoted as DEP and REL for
short.

Except for LISA, where DEP is a one-hot ma-
trix of dependency head word index described in
3.3.2, in other cases, we use the corresponding
head word. REL is the dependency relation be-
tween the word and its syntactic head. We take
both DEP and REL as common strings and map
them into dense vectors in the similar way of word
embedding.

3.2.2 Dependency Path & Relation Path
In order to preserve the structural information of
dependency trees as much as possible, we take the
syntactic path between candidate arguments and
predicates in dependency trees as linguistic knowl-
edge. Referring to Xia et al. (2019), we use the
Tree-based Position Feature (TPF) as Dependency
Path (DEPPATH) and use the Shortest Dependency
Path (SDP) as Relation Path (RELPATH).

To generate DEPPATH & RELPATH between
candidate argument and predicate, we firstly find
their lowest common ancestor. Then we get two
sub-paths, one is from the ancestor to the predicate
and the other is from the ancestor to the argument.
For DEPPATH, we compute distance from ancestor
to predicate and argument respectively and then
concatenate two distances with the separator ‘,’.

Figure 3: The syntactic dependency tree of the sentence
“中国鼓励外商投资农业” (China encourages foreign
merchants to invest in agriculture). Numbers in brack-
ets are the DEPPATH for each candidate argument with
the predicate “鼓励 (encourage)”. Light grey labels on
the arcs are the syntactic dependency labels.

For RELPATH, we concatenate the labels appear-
ing in each sub-path with the separator “ ” respec-
tively to get two label paths, and then concatenate
the two label paths with the separator ‘,’.

As shown in Figure 3, the lowest common an-
cestor of the predicate “鼓励 (encourage)” and the
candidate argument “农业 (agriculture)” is “鼓励
(encourage)”, so their DEPPATH is “2,0” and its
RELPATH is “COMP COMP,”2.

We take both DEPPATH and RELPATH as com-
mon strings and map them into dense vectors in
the similar way of DEP and REL.

3.3 Incorporation Methods
3.3.1 Input Embedding Concatenation
To incorporate syntactic knowledge, one simple
method is to take it as part of the neural network
input, denoted as INPUT. We represent the syntac-
tic information with dense vectors, and concate-
nate it with other information like word embed-
ding:

input = EW ⊕ ES . (8)

where ⊕ means concatenation; EW means the
original inputs of the neural model and ES means
the embedding of syntax information, such as
DEP/REL or DEPPATH/RELPATH.

3.3.2 LISA
Strubell et al. (2018) propose the linguistically-
informed self-attention model (LISA for short) to
combine SRL and dependency parsing as multi-
task learning in a subtle way. Based on the multi-
head self-attention model, LISA uses one atten-
tion head to predict the dependency results and it

2 When predicate is the ancestor of argument, sub-path
from ancestor to predicate is none. We use ‘0’ to represent
distance and use empty string to represent the label path, and
vice versa.

head in the LISA model. The left matrix is the original
softmax attention, and the right is a one-hot matrix

can also directly use pre-trained dependency head
results to replace the attention matrix during test-
ing.

Being different from their multi-task learning,
we make the replacement of one attention head
during both training and testing. Instead of the
original softmax attention matrix, we use a one-
hot matrix, generated by mapping the dependency
head index of each word into a 0-1 vector of the
sentence length as Figure 4 shows.

We add the dependency relation information
with V in the replaced head so that we can make
full use of the syntactic knowledge. The replaced
attention head is formulated as follows:

Attention(Q,K, V ) =MD (V ⊕ ER) (9)

where MD is the one-hot dependency head matrix
andER means the embedding of dependency rela-
tion information, such as REL or RELPATH.

3.3.3 Relation-Aware Self-Attention
Relation-aware self-attention model (RELAWE for
brevity) incorporates external information into the
attention. By this way, the model considers the
pairwise relationships between input elements,
which highly agrees with the task of SRL, i.e.,
aiming to find the semantic relations between the
candidate argument and predicate in one sentence.

Compared to the standard attention, in this pa-
per, we add the dependency information into Q
and V in each attention head, like equation (10)
shows:

Attention(Q,K, V ) =

softmax(
(Q+ ED + ER)K

T

√
dk

)(V + ED + ER)
(10)

where ED and ER mean the syntactic dependency
head and relation information respectively. For
our multi-layer multi-head self-attention model,
we make this change to each head of the first N
self-attention layers.

of syntactic dependency trees.

4 Experiment

4.1 Settings
Datasets & Evaluation Metrics Our experiments
are conducted on the CoNLL-2009 shared task
dataset (Hajič et al., 2009). We use the official
evaluation script to compare the output of different
system configurations, and report the labeled pre-
cision (P), labeled recall (R) and labeled f-score
(F1) for the semantic dependencies.

Word Representations Most of our experi-
ments are conducted in the closed setting without
any external word embeddings or data resources
than those provided by the CoNLL-2009 datasets.
In the closed setting, word embedding is initial-
ized by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
variance 1√

d
, where d is the dimension of embed-

ding size of each layer.
For the experiments with external resources

in the open setting, we utilize 1) word embed-
dings pre-trained with GloVe (Pennington et al.,
2014) on the Gigaword corpus for Chinese and the
published embeddings with 100 dimensions pre-
trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword for English;
and 2) ELMo3 (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT4

(Devlin et al., 2018), two recently proposed effec-
tive deep contextualized word representations5.

3We use the released model on their website:
https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/tutorials
/how to/elmo.md

4We generate our pre-trained BERT embedding with the
released model in https://github.com/google-research/bert.
The model uses character-based tokenization for Chinese,
which require us to maintain alignment between our input
text and output text of Bert. So we take take embedding of
the first word piece as the whole word representation.

5In open setting, we use pre-trained word embedding in-
stead of random initialized embedding. If using BERT and
Elmo additionally, we project them into representation vec-
tors of same dimension as word embedding and concatenate



621

Other embeddings, i.e., POS embedding, lin-
guistic knowledge embedding, and so on are ini-
tialized in same way as random word embedding
no matter in closed or open setting.

Syntactic Parsers In Table 1, both AUTO and
GOLD syntactic dependencies are provided by the
dataset. Since the performance of the AUTO is far
behind the state-of-the-art BiaffineParser (Dozat
and Manning, 2016), we generate more depen-
dency results by training BiaffineParser6 with dif-
ferent external knowledge, including pre-trained
word embedding and BERT. Performance for dif-
ferent parsers is listed in Table 1.

Parameters In this work, we set word embed-
ding size dw = 100, POS embedding size dt = 50.
The predicate embedding size is set as dp = 100.
The syntax-related embedding size varies along
with different configurations, so as the feature em-
bedding size df .

To facilitate residual connections, all sub-
layers in the model produce outputs of dimen-
sion dmodel = df + dp. The hidden dimension
dff = 800 is applied for all the experiments.
We set the number of shared self-attention blocks
N = 10. The number of heads varies with dmodel,
but dimension of each head is 25. Besides, LISA
incorporates syntax knowledge in the 5-th self-
attention layer while RELAWE incorporates in the
first 5 layers.

We apply the similar dropout strategy as
Vaswani et al. (2017), i.e., the attention and resid-
ual dropout values are 0.2 and 0.3 respectively.
The dropout is also applied in the middle layer
of FFN with value 0.2. We also employ label
smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2015) of value 0.1 dur-
ing training.

We use softmax-cross-entropy as our loss func-
tion, and use the Adadelta optimizer (Zeiler, 2012)
with � = 10−6 and ρ = 0.95. For all experiments,
we train the model 200, 000 steps with learning
rate lr = 1.0, and each batch has 4096 words.

All the hyper-parameters are tuned on the devel-
opment set.

Configurations We use different abbreviations
to represent the parsing results, syntactic depen-
dency representations, and incorporation methods.
All the system configurations in our experiments
are listed in Table 2.

4.2 Quality of the Syntactic Dependencies

We use the above-mentioned dependency trees of
different quality for comparison, with DEP&REL
representation on our RELAWE model. In addi-
tion, we generate one more data AUTODEL by
deleting all the erroneous dependency heads and
relations from the provided AUTO data according
to the gold heads and relations, and we do not re-
place them with any alternative heads and rela-
tions7. We take this setting as another reference
(along with GOLD) to indicate that erroneous syn-
tax information may hurt the performance of the
SRL model. We take the GOLD as the upperbound
reference of our task setting. Experiment results in
Table 3 demonstrate that, incorporating syntactic
knowledge into the SRL model can achieve better
performance and overall, the better the quality is,
the better the SRL model performs. This is con-
sistent with the previous study by He et al. (2017)
on the English dataset.

7For the AUTODEL data, we cannot guarantee that there
exists a syntactic path between the two words. Therefore,
we do not conduct experiments under the DepPath&RelPath
setting.

Table 4: SRL results with different syntactic represen-
tations on the Chinese dev set. Experiments are con-
ducted on the RELAWE method.

Closer observation reveals two additional inter-
esting phenomena. Firstly, SRL performance im-
provement is not proportionate to the improve-
ment of dependency quality. When switching
syntactic dependency trees from AUTO to BI-
AFFINE, SRL performance improves 0.5%, al-
though syntactic dependency improves about 8%.
In contrast, the difference between BIAFFINE and
BIAFFINEBERT shows more significant improve-
ment of 1.5%. The possible reason is that BI-
AFFINEBERT provides key dependency informa-
tion which is missing in other configurations. Sec-
ondly, the SRL performance gap between AU-
TODEL and AUTO is large though they provide the
same correct syntactic information. This may indi-
cate that incorporating erroneous syntactic knowl-
edge hurts the SRL model, and even providing
more correct dependencies cannot make up for the
harm (cf. BIAFFINEBERT).

4.3 Representation of the Syntactic
Dependencies

Apart from DEP and REL, we also use DEPPATH
and RELPATH to encode the syntactic knowledge.
In this subsection, we conduct experiments to
compare different syntactic encoding in our SRL
model. We base the experiments on our RELAWE
model, since it is easier to incorporate different
representations for comparison. When generating
the RELPATH, we filter the paths 1) when the de-
pendency distance between the predicate and the
candidate argument is more than 4, and 2) when
the RELPATH’s frequency is less than 108.

No matter in which representation, dependency
8As we know, dependency parsers cannot deal with long

distance dependency well and it is unlikely to deliver a reli-
able result. And our experiments show that filtration achieves
empirically better results.

label information is more important than the head
and the combination of the two achieves better
performance as our experiment results in Table 4
show. Furthermore, using BIAFFINE dependency
trees, DEPPATH and RELPATH perform better than
DEP and REL. This is because of the capability
of DEPPATH and RELPATH to capture more struc-
tural information of the dependency trees.

Comparing Table 3 and 4, when using gold
dependencies, DEPPATH&RELPATH can achieve
much better result than DEP&REL. But with the
AUTO trees, DEPPATH&RELPATH is much worse.
Therefore, structural information is much more
sensitive to the quality of dependency trees due to
error propagation.

4.4 Incorporation Methods

This subsection discusses the effectiveness of
different incorporation methods of the syntactic
knowledge. We take BIAFFINE’s output as our de-

9From the mechanism of LISA, we can find that the re-
placed attention head can’t copy the syntactic dependency
heads from DEPPATH.

pendency information for the comparison.
Firstly, results in Table 5 show that with lit-

tle dependency information (DEP), LISA per-
forms better, while incorporating richer syntactic
knowledge (DEP&REL or DEP&RELPATH), three
methods achieve similar performance. Overall,
RELAWE achieves best results given enough syn-
tactic knowledge.

Secondly, INPUT and LISA achieve much bet-
ter performance when we combine the dependency
head information and the relation, while Strubell
et al. (2018) have not introduced relation infor-
mation to the LISA model and Xia et al. (2019)
have not combined the head and relation informa-
tion either. Our proposed RELAWE method with
DEPPATH&RELPATH representation performs the
best, which encodes the richest syntactic knowl-
edge.

Lastly, under the same settings, LISA and
RELAWE perform better than INPUT, which in-
dicates the importance of the location where the
model incorporates the syntax, the input layer vs.
the encoder layer.

4.5 External Resources

Apart from the experiments with syntactic knowl-
edge itself, we also compare different external
resources to discover their relationship with the
syntax, including pre-trained word embeddings,
ELMo, and BERT. We conduct experiments with
our best setting, the RELAWE model with DEP-
PATH & RELPATH and the results are listed in Ta-
ble 6.

The plain word embedding improves a little in

such settings with syntactic information, while for
the newly proposed ELMO and BERT, both of
them can boost the models further.

4.6 Final Results on the Chinese Test Data

Based on the above experiments and analyses, we
present the overall results of our model in this
subsection. We train the three models (INPUT,
LISA, and RELAWE) with their best settings with-
out any external knowledge as CLOSED, and we
take the same models with BERT as OPEN. The
DEPPATH&RELPATH from GOLD without exter-
nal knowledge serves as the GOLD for reference.
Since we have been focusing on the task of argu-
ment identification and labeling, for both CLOSED
and OPEN, we follow Roth and Lapata (2016) to
use existing systems’ predicate senses (Johansson
and Nugues, 2008) to exclude them from compar-
ison.

Table 7 shows that our OPEN model achieves
more than 3 points of f1-score than the state-
of-the-art result, and RELAWE with DEP-
PATH&RELPATH achieves the best in both
CLOSED and OPEN settings. Notice that our best
CLOSED model can almost perform as well as the
state-of-the-art model while the latter utilizes pre-
trained word embeddings. Besides, performance
gap between three models under OPEN setting is
very small. It indicates that the representation abil-
ity of BERT is so powerful and may contains rich
syntactic information. At last, the GOLD result is
much higher than the other models, indicating that
there is still large space for improvement for this
task.

Table 8: SRL results on the English test set. We
use syntactic dependency results generated by Bi-
affineParser (On test set, syntactic performance is:
UAS = 94.35%, and LAS = 92.54%, which improves
about 6% compared to automatic trees in CoNLL-
2009.).

4.7 Results on the English Data

We also conduct several experiments on the En-
glish dataset to validate the effectiveness of our
approaches on other languages than Chinese and
the results are in Table 8. Although both config-
urations are not exactly the same as their origi-
nal papers, we tried our best to reproduce their
methods on the CoNLL2009 dataset for our com-
parison. Overall, the results are consistent with
the Chinese experiments, while the improvement
is not as large as the Chinese counterparts. The
RELAWE model with DEPPATH&RELPATH still
achieves the best performance. Applying our
syntax-enhanced model to more languages will be
an interesting research direction to work on in the
future.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper investigates how to incorporate syn-
tactic dependency information into semantic role
labeling in depth. Firstly, we confirm that de-
pendency trees of better quality are more helpful
for the SRL task. Secondly, we present different
ways to encode the trees and the experiments show
that keeping more (correct) structural information
during encoding improves the SRL performance.
Thirdly, we compare three incorporation methods
and discover that our proposed relation-aware self-
attention-based model is the most effective one.

Although our experiments are primarily on the
Chinese dataset, the approach is largely language
independent. Apart from our tentative experi-
ments on the English dataset, applying the ap-
proach to other languages will be an interesting

10We reimplement LISA in Strubell et al. (2018) as
LISA(DEP), and Xia et al. (2019)’s best DEPPATH approach
as INPUT(DEPPATH). Therefore, we can compare with their
work as fairly as possible. Other settings are the best config-
urations for their corresponding methods.

research direction to work on in the future.
