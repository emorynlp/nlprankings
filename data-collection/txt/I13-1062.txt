Abstract

Keyphrase extraction is the task of iden-
tifying single or multi-word expressions
that represent the main topics of a doc-
ument. In this paper we present Topi-
cRank, a graph-based keyphrase extrac-
tion method that relies on a topical rep-
resentation of the document. Candidate
keyphrases are clustered into topics and
used as vertices in a complete graph. A
graph-based ranking model is applied to
assign a significance score to each topic.
Keyphrases are then generated by select-
ing a candidate from each of the top-
ranked topics. We conducted experiments
on four evaluation datasets of different
languages and domains. Results show
that TopicRank significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on three datasets.

1 Introduction

Keyphrases are single or multi-word expres-
sions that represent the main topics of a doc-
ument. Keyphrases are useful in many tasks
such as information retrieval (Medelyan and Wit-
ten, 2008), document summarization (Litvak and
Last, 2008) or document clustering (Han et al.,
2007). Although scientific articles usually provide
them, most of the documents have no associated
keyphrases. Therefore, the problem of automati-
cally assigning keyphrases to documents is an ac-
tive field of research.

Automatic keyphrase extraction methods are di-
vided into two categories: supervised and un-
supervised methods. Supervised methods re-
cast keyphrase extraction as a binary classifica-
tion task (Witten et al., 1999), whereas unsuper-
vised methods apply different kinds of techniques
such as language modeling (Tomokiyo and Hurst,
2003), clustering (Liu et al., 2009) or graph-based
ranking (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

In this paper, we present a new unsupervised
method called TopicRank. This new method
is an improvement of the TextRank method ap-
plied to keyphrase extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004). In the TextRank method, a document is
represented by a graph where words are vertices
and edges represent co-occurrence relations. A
graph-based ranking model derived from PageR-
ank (Brin and Page, 1998) is then used to assign
a significance score to each word. Here, we pro-
pose to represent a document as a complete graph
where vertices are not words but topics. We de-
fine a topic as a cluster of similar single and multi-
word expressions.

Our approach has several advantages over Tex-
tRank. Intuitively, ranking topics instead of words
is a more straightforward way to identify the set of
keyphrases that covers the main topics of a docu-
ment. To do so, we simply select a keyphrase can-
didate from each of the top-ranked clusters. Clus-
tering keyphrase candidates into topics also elimi-
nates redundancy while reinforcing edges. This is
very important because the ranking performance
strongly depends on the conciseness of the graph,
as well as its ability to precisely represent seman-
tic relations within a document. Hence, another
advantage of our approach is the use of a com-
plete graph that better captures the semantic rela-
tions between topics.

To evaluate TopicRank, we follow Hasan and
Ng (2010) who stated that multiple datasets must
be used to evaluate and fully understand the
strengths and weaknesses of a method. We use
four evaluation datasets of different languages,
document sizes and domains, and compare the
keyphrases extracted by TopicRank against three
baselines (TF-IDF and two graph-based methods).
TopicRank outperforms the baselines on three of
the datasets. As for the fourth one, an additional
experiment shows that an improvement could be
achieved with a more effective selection strategy.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the existing methods for the
keyphrase extraction task, Section 3 details our
proposed approach, Section 4 describes the eval-
uation process and Section 5 shows the analyzed
results. Finally, Section 6 concludes this work and
suggests directions for future work.

2 Related Work

The task of automatic keyphrase extraction has
been well studied and many supervised and un-
supervised approaches have been proposed. For
supervised methods, keyphrase extraction is often
treated as a binary classification task (Witten et al.,
1999). Unsupervised approaches proposed so far
have involved a number of techniques, including
language modeling (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003),
clustering (Liu et al., 2009) and graph-based rank-
ing (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). While supervised
approaches have generally proven to be more suc-
cessful, the need for training data and the bias to-
wards the domain on which they are trained re-
main two critical issues.

In this paper, we concentrate on graph-based
ranking methods for keyphrase extraction. Start-
ing with TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),
these methods are becoming the most widely used
unsupervised approaches for keyphrase extraction.
In TextRank, a document is represented as a graph
in which vertices are words connected if they co-
occur in a given window of words. The signif-
icance of each vertex is computed using a ran-
dom walk algorithm derived from PageRank (Brin
and Page, 1998). Words corresponding to the top
ranked vertices are then selected and assembled to
generate keyphrases.

Wan and Xiao (2008) propose SingleRank, a
simple modification of TextRank that weights the
edges with the number of co-occurrences and no
longer extracts keyphrases by assembling ranked
words. Keyphrases are noun phrases extracted
from the document and ranked according to the
sum of the significance of the words they con-
tain. Although it improves the results, this scoring
method has no proper justification and tends to as-
sign high scores to long but non important phrases.
For example, “nash equilibrium”, from the file J-
14.txt of our evaluation dataset named SemEval, is
a keyphrase composed of the two most significant
words in the document, according to SingleRank.
Therefore, SingleRank succeeds to extract it, but

candidates such as “unique nash equilibrium” or
“exact nash equilibrium” which are longer, then
have a better score, are extracted too. With Topi-
cRank, we aim to circumvent this by ranking clus-
ters of single and multi-word expressions instead
of words.

Wan and Xiao (2008) use a small number of
nearest neighbor documents to compute more ac-
curate word co-occurrences and reinforce edge
weights in the word graph. Borrowing co-
occurrence information from multiple documents,
their approach improves the word ranking perfor-
mance. Instead of using words, Liang et al. (2009)
use keyphrase candidates as vertices. Applied
to Chinese, their method uses query log knowl-
edge to determine phrase boundaries. Tsatsaro-
nis et al. (2010) propose to connect vertices em-
ploying semantic relations computed using Word-
Net (Miller, 1995) or Wikipedia. They also experi-
ment with different random walk algorithms, such
as HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) or modified PageRank.

Liu et al. (2010) consider the topics of words
using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (Blei et
al., 2003, LDA). As done by Haveliwala (2003)
for Information Retrieval, they propose to decom-
pose PageRank into multiple PageRanks specific
to various topics. A topic-biased PageRank is
computed for each topic and corresponding word
scores are combined. As this method uses a LDA
model, it requires training data. With TopicRank,
we also consider topics, but our aim is to use a
single document, the document to be analyzed.

3 TopicRank

TopicRank is an unsupervised method that aims to
extract keyphrases from the most important top-
ics of a document. Topics are defined as clus-
ters of similar keyphrase candidates. Extract-
ing keyphrases from a document consists in the
following steps, illustrated in Figure 1. First,
the document is preprocessed (sentence segmen-
tation, word tokenization and Part-of-Speech tag-
ging) and keyphrase candidates are clustered into
topics. Then, topics are ranked according to their
importance in the document and keyphrases are
extracted by selecting one keyphrase candidate for
each of the most important topics.

Section 3.1 first explains how the topics are
identified within a document, section 3.2 presents
the approach we use to rank them and section 3.3
describes the keyphrase selection.

3.1 Topic Identification

Keyphrases describe the most important topics of
a document, thus the first step is to identify the
keyphrase candidates that represent them. Hulth
(2003) stated that most keyphrases assigned by
human readers are noun phrases. Hence, the
most important topics of a document can be found
by extracting their most significant noun phrases.
We follow Wan and Xiao (2008) and extract the
longest sequences of nouns and adjectives from
the document as keyphrase candidates. Other
methods use syntactically filtered n-grams that are
most likely to contain a larger number of candi-
dates matching with reference keyphrases, but the
n-gram restricted length is a problem. Indeed, n-
grams do not always capture as much information
as the longest noun phrases. Also, they are less
likely to be grammatically correct.

In a document, a topic is usually conveyed by
more than one noun phrase. Consequently, some
keyphrase candidates are redundant in regard to
the topic they represent. Existing graph-based
methods (TextRank, SingleRank, etc.) do not take
that fact into account. Keyphrase candidates are
usually treated independently and the information
about the topic they represent is scattered through-
out the graph. Thus, we propose to group similar
noun phrases as a single entity, a topic.

We consider that two keyphrase candidates are
similar if they have at least 25% of overlapping
words1. Keyphrase candidates are stemmed to re-
duce their inflected word forms into root forms2.
To automatically group similar candidates into

1The value of 25% has been defined empirically.
2We chose to use stems because of the availability of

stemmers for various languages, but using lemmas is another
possibility that could probably work better.

topics, we use a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clus-
tering (HAC) algorithm. Among the commonly
used linkage strategies, which are complete, aver-
age and single linkage, we use the average link-
age, because it stands as a compromise between
complete and single linkage. In fact, using a
highly agglomerative strategy such as complete
linkage is more likely to group topically unrelated
keyphrase candidates, whereas a strategy such as
single linkage is less likely to group topically re-
lated keyphrase candidates.

3.2 Graph-Based Ranking

TopicRank represents a document by a complete
graph in which topics are vertices and edges are
weighted according to the strength of the seman-
tic relations between vertices. Then, TextRank’s
graph-based ranking model is used to assign a sig-
nificance score to each topic.

3.2.1 Graph Construction

Formally, let G = (V,E) be a complete and undi-
rected graph where V is a set of vertices and the
edges E a subset3 of V ×V . Vertices are topics and
the edge between two topics ti and tj is weighted
according to the strength of their semantic rela-
tion. ti and tj have a strong semantic relation if
their keyphrase candidates often appear close to
each other in the document. Therefore, the weight
wi,j of their edge is defined as follows:

wi,j =
∑

ci∈ti

∑

cj∈tj

dist(ci, cj) (1)

dist(ci, cj) =
∑

pi∈pos(ci)

∑

pj∈pos(cj)

1

|pi − pj|
(2)

where dist(ci, cj) refers to the reciprocal dis-
tances between the offset positions of the candi-
date keyphrases ci and cj in the document and
where pos(ci) represents all the offset positions of
the candidate keyphrase ci.

Our approach to construct the graph differs
from TextRank. G is a complete graph and topics
are therefore interconnected. The completeness
of the graph has the benefit of providing a more
exhaustive view of the relations between topics.
Also, computing weights based on the distances
between offset positions bypasses the need for a
manually defined parameter, such as the window
of words used by state-of-the-art methods (Tex-
tRank, SingleRank, etc).

Inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion exchanger 

    A mathematical model of ion exchange is considered, allowing for ion exchanger compression in the process of ion exchange. Two inverse problems are

    investigated for this model, unique solvability is proved, and numerical solution methods are proposed. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demon-

    strated by a numerical experiment.

Keyphrases assigned by human annotators:

    ion exchange; mathematical model; inverse problems; nume-

    rical solution methods; unique solvability; compressible ion

    exchanger; ion exchanger compression

Keyphrases assigned by TopicRank:

    ion exchange; mathematical model; inverse problems; nume-

    rical solution methods; process; unique solvability; efficiency;

Figure 2: Sample graph build by TopicRank from Inspec, file 2040.abstr.

Figure 2 shows a sample graph built for an
abstract from one of our evaluation datasets (In-
spec). Vertices are topics, represented as clusters
of lexically similar keyphrase candidates, and con-
nected with all the others. In the example, we see
the naivety of our clustering approach. Indeed,
the clustering succeeds to group “ion exchanger”,
“ion exchanger compression” and “compressible
ion exchanger”, but the clustering of “methods”
with “numerical solution methods” and “model”
with “mathematical model” may be ambiguous as
“methods” and “model” can be used to refer to
other methods or models.

3.2.2 Subject Ranking

Once the graph is created, the graph-based rank-
ing model TextRank, proposed by Mihalcea and
Tarau (2004), is used to rank the topics. This
model assigns a significance score to topics based
on the concept of “voting”: high-scoring topics
contribute more to the score of their connected
topic ti:

S(ti) = (1− λ) + λ ×
∑

tj∈Vi

wj,i × S(tj)∑

tk∈Vj

wj,k
(3)

where Vi are the topics voting for ti and λ is a
damping factor generally defined to 0.85 (Brin and
Page, 1998).

3.3 Keyphrase Selection

Keyphrase selection is the last step of Topi-
cRank. For each topic, only the most represen-
tative keyphrase candidate is selected. This selec-
tion avoids redundancy and leads to a good cover-

age of the document topics, because extracting k
keyphrases precisely covers k topics.

To find the candidate that best represents a
topic, we propose three strategies. Assuming that
a topic is first introduced by its generic form, the
first strategy is to select the keyphrase candidate
that appears first in the document. The second
strategy assumes that the generic form of a topic is
the one that is most frequently used and the third
strategy selects the centroid of the cluster. The
centroid is the candidate that is the most similar
to the other candidates of the cluster4.

4 Experimental Settings

4.1 Datasets

To compare the keyphrases extracted by Topi-
cRank against existing methods, we employ four
standard evaluation dataset of different languages,
document sizes and domains.

The first dataset, formerly used by Hulth (2003),
contains 2000 English abstracts of journal papers
from the Inspec database. The 2000 abstracts are
divided into three sets: a training set, which con-
tains 1000 abstracts, a validation set containing
500 abstracts and a test set containing the 500 re-
maining abstracts. In our experiments we use the
500 abstracts from the test set. Several reference
keyphrase sets are available with this dataset. Just
as Hulth (2003), we use the uncontrolled refer-
ence, created by professional indexers.

The second dataset was built by Kim et al.
(2010) for the keyphrase extraction task of the Se-
mEval 2010 evaluation campaign. This dataset is

composed of 284 scientific articles (in English)
from the ACM Digital Libraries (conference and
workshop papers). The 284 documents are divided
into three sets: a trial set containing 40 documents,
a training set, which contains 144 documents and
a test set containing 100 documents. In our exper-
iments we use the 100 documents of the test set.
As for the reference keyphrases, we use the com-
bination of author and reader assigned keyphrases
provided by Kim et al. (2010).

The third dataset is a French corpus that we
created from the French version of WikiNews5.
It contains 100 news articles published between
May 2012 and December 2012. Each document
has been annotated by at least three students. We
combined the annotations of each document and
removed the lexical redundancies. All of the 100
documents are used in our experiments.

The fourth dataset is a French corpus made
for the keyphrase extraction task of the DEFT
2012 evaluation campaign (Paroubek et al., 2012).
It contains 468 scientific articles extracted from
Érudit. These documents are used for two tasks of
DEFT and are, therefore, divided in two datasets
of 244 documents each. In our experiments we use
the test set of the second task dataset. It contains
93 documents provided with author keyphrases.

Table 1 gives statistics about the datasets. They
are different in terms of document sizes and num-
ber of assigned keyphrases. The Inspec and
WikiNews datasets have shorter documents (ab-
stract and news articles) compared to SemEval
and DEFT that both contain full-text scientific ar-
ticles. Also, the keyphrases provided with the
datasets are not always present in the documents
(less than 5% of missing keyphrases for Wikinews
and about 20% of missing keyphrases for the
other datasets). This induces a bias in the re-

sults. As explained by Hasan and Ng (2010),
some researchers avoid this problem by removing
missing keyphrases from the references. In our
experiments, missing keyphrases have not been
removed. However, we evaluate with stemmed
forms of candidates and reference keyphrases to
reduce mismatches.

4.2 Preprocessing

For each dataset, we apply the following pre-
processing steps: sentence segmentation, word
tokenization and Part-of-Speech tagging. For
word tokenization, we use the TreebankWordTo-
kenizer provided by the python Natural Language
ToolKit (Bird et al., 2009) for English and the
Bonsai word tokenizer6 for French. For Part-
of-Speech tagging, we use the Stanford POS-
tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) for English and
MElt (Denis and Sagot, 2009) for French.

4.3 Baselines

For comparison purpose, we use three base-
lines. The first baseline is TF-IDF (Spärck Jones,
1972), commonly used because of the difficulty
to achieve competitive results against it (Hasan
and Ng, 2010). This method relies on a col-
lection of documents and assumes that the k
keyphrase candidates containing words with the
highest TF-IDF weights are the keyphrases of the
document. As TopicRank aims to be an improve-
ment of the state-of-the-art graph-based methods
for keyphrase extraction, the last two baselines are
TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and Sin-
gleRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008). In these meth-
ods, the graph is undirected, vertices are syn-
tactically filtered words (only nouns and adjec-
tives) and the edges are created based on the co-
occurrences of words within a window of 2 for

TextRank and 10 for SingleRank. As well as
their window size, they differ in the weighting
of the graph: TextRank has an unweighted graph
and SingleRank has a graph weighted with the
number of co-occurrences between the words. A
graph-based ranking model derived from PageR-
ank (Brin and Page, 1998) ranks each vertex and
extracts multi-word keyphrases according to the
ranked words. In TextRank, the k-best words are
used as keyphrases and the adjacent sequences
in the document are collapsed into multi-word
keyphrases. Although k is normally proportional
to the number of vertices in the graph, we set it to a
constant number, because experiments conducted
by Hasan and Ng (2010) show that the optimal
value of the ratio depends on the size of the docu-
ment. In SingleRank, noun phrases extracted with
the same method as TopicRank are ranked by a
score equal to the sum of their words scores. Then,
the k-best noun phrases are selected as keyphrases.

For all the baselines, we consider keyphrase
candidates which have the same stemmed form
as redundant. Once they are ranked we keep the
best candidate and remove the others. This can
only affect the results in a positive way, because
the evaluation is performed with stemmed forms,
which means that removed candidates are consid-
ered equal to the retained candidate.

4.4 Evaluation Measures

The performances of TopicRank and the base-
lines are evaluated in terms of precision, recall
and f-score (f1-measure) when a maximum of 10
keyphrases are extracted (k = 10). As said be-
fore, the candidate and reference keyphrases are
stemmed to reduce the number of mismatches.

5 Results

To validate our approach, we designed three ex-
periments. The first experiment compares Topi-
cRank7 to the baselines8 , the second experiment
individually evaluates the modifications of Topi-
cRank compared to SingleRank9 and the last ex-
periment compares the keyphrase selection strate-
gies. To show that the clusters are well ranked, we
also present the results that could be achieved with
a “perfect” keyphrase selection strategy.

Table 2 shows the results of TopicRank and the
three baselines. Overall, our method outperforms
TextRank, SingleRank and TF-IDF. The results
of TopicRank and the baselines are lower on Se-
mEval and DEFT (less than 16% of f-score), so we
deduce that it is more difficult to treat long docu-
ments than short ones. On Inspec, TopicRank fails
to do better than all the baselines, but on SemEval,
WikiNews and DEFT, it performs better than TF-
IDF and significantly outperforms TextRank and
SingleRank. Also, we observe a gap between TF-
IDF’s and the two graph-based baselines results.
Although TopicRank is a graph-based method, it
overcomes this gap by almost tripling the f-score
of both TextRank and SingleRank.

Table 3 shows the individual modifications of
TopicRank compared to SingleRank. We evalu-
ate SingleRank when vertices are keyphrase can-
didates (+phrases), vertices are topics (+topics)
and when TopicRank’s graph construction is used

7Results reported for TopicRank are obtained with the
first position selection strategy.

9The second experiment is performed with SingleRank
instead of TextRank, because SingleRank also uses a graph
with weighted edges and is, therefore, closer to TopicRank.

with word vertices (+complete). Using keyphrase
candidates as vertices significantly improves Sin-
gleRank on SemEval, WikiNews and DEFT. On
Inspec, it induces a considerable loss of perfor-
mance caused by an important deficit of con-
nections that leads to connected components, as
shown in Figure 3. When we look at the dis-
tribution of “fuzzy” into the graph, we can see
that it is scattered among the connected compo-
nents and, therefore, increases the difficulty to se-
lect “fuzzy Bayesian inference techniques” as a
keyphrase (according to the reference). The other
datasets contain longer documents, which may
dampen this problem. Overall, using topics as ver-
tices performs better than using keyphrase candi-
dates. Using topics significantly outperforms Sin-
gleRank on SemEval, WikiNews and DEFT. As
for the new graph construction, SingleRank is im-
proved on Inspec, SemEval and WikiNews. Re-
sults on DEFT are lower than SingleRank, but still
competitive. Although the improvements are not
significant, the competitive results point out that
the new graph construction can be used instead of
the former method, which requires to manually de-
fine a window of words. Experiments show that
the three contributions are improvements and Top-
icRank benefits from each of them.

Table 4 shows the results of TopicRank when
selecting either the first appearing candidate, the
most frequent one or the centroid of each cluster.
Selecting the first appearing keyphrase candidate
is the best strategy of the three. It significantly
outperforms the frequency and the centroid strate-
gies on SemEval, WikiNews and DEFT. On Se-
mEval and DEFT, we observe a huge gap between
the results of the first position strategy and the oth-
ers. The two datasets are composed of scientific
articles where the full form of the main topics are

often introduced at the beginning and then, con-
veyed by abbreviations or inherent concepts (e.g.
the file C-17.txt from SemEval contains packet-
switched network as a keyphrase where packet is
more utilized in the content). These are usually
more similar to the generic form and/or more fre-
quent, which explains the observed gap.

method SingleRank+phrases. Example taken from
Inspec, file 1931.abstr.

To observe the ranking efficiency of TopicRank,
we also evaluate it without taking the keyphrase
selection strategy into account. To do so, we ex-
tract the top-ranked clusters and mark the refer-
ence keyphrases into them. We deduce the up-
per bound results of our method by computing the
precision, recall and f-score where the number of
correct matches is equal to the number of clusters
containing at least one reference keyphrase. The
upper bound results show that our method could
possibly perform better than all the baselines for
the four datasets. Even on Inspec, the loss of
performance can be bypassed by a more efficient
keyphrase selection strategy.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper we presented TopicRank, an unsu-
pervised method for keyphrase extraction. Topi-
cRank extracts the noun phrases that represent the
main topics of a document. The noun phrases are
clustered into topics and used as vertices in a com-
plete graph. The resulting graph stands as a topical
representation of the document. Topics are scored
using the TextRank ranking model and keyphrases
are then extracted by selecting the most represen-
tative candidate from each of the top-ranked top-
ics. Our approach offers several advantages over
existing graph-based keyphrase extraction meth-
ods. First, as redundant keyphrase candidates
are clustered, extracted keyphrases cover the main
topics of the document better. The use of a com-
plete graph also captures the relations between
topics without any manually defined parameters
and induces better or similar performances than
the state-of-the-art connection method that uses
a co-occurrence window. We conducted experi-
ments on four standard evaluation datasets of dif-
ferent languages, document sizes and domains.
Results show that TopicRank outperforms TF-
IDF and significantly improves the state-of-the-art
graph-based methods on three of them.

In future work, we will further improve the
topic identification and the keyphrase selection.
More precisely, we will develop an evaluation pro-
cess to determine cluster quality and then focus
on experimenting with other clustering algorithms
and investigate the use of linguistic knowledge for
similarity measures. As for the keyphrase selec-
tion, our experiments show that the current method
does not provide the best solution that could be
achieved with the ranked clusters. We plan to im-
prove it using machine learning methods.
