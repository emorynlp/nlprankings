Abstract

Several approaches have been proposed for the au-
tomatic acquisition of multiword expressions from
corpora. However, there is no agreement about
which of them presents the best cost-benefit ratio, as
they have been evaluated on distinct datasets and/or
languages. To address this issue, we investigate
these techniques analysing the following dimen-
sions: expression type (compound nouns, phrasal
verbs), language (English, French) and corpus size.
Results show that these techniques tend to extract
similar candidate lists with high recall (∼ 80%) for
nominals and high precision (∼ 70%) for verbals.
The use of association measures for candidate filter-
ing is useful but some of them are more onerous and
not significantly better than raw counts. We finish
with an evaluation of flexibility and an indication of
which technique is recommended for each language-
type-size context.

1 Introduction
Taking into account multiword expressions (MWEs) is
important to confer naturalness to the output of NLP sys-
tems. An MT system, for instance, needs to be aware of
idiomatic expressions like raining cats and dogs to avoid
literal translations.1 Likewise, a parser needs to deal with
verb-particle expressions like take off from Paris and with
light verb constructions like take a walk along the river
in order to avoid PP-attachment errors.

Even though the last decade has seen considerable re-
search in the automatic acquisition of MWEs, both in
theoretical and in computational linguistics, to date there
are few NLP applications integrating explicit MWE treat-
ment. This may be partly explained by the complexity of
MWEs: as they are heterogeneous and flexible, there is
no unique push-button approach to identify all types of
MWEs in all languages (Sag et al., 2002). Existing ap-
proaches are either generic but present relatively low pre-

German raining young dogs, in Portuguese raining Swiss knives, etc.

cision or they require a large amount of language-specific
resources to yield good results.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate approaches for the
automatic acquisition of MWEs from corpora (§2), exam-
ining as parameters of the experimental context the lan-
guage (English and French), type of target MWE (verbal
and nominal) and size of corpus (small, medium, large).
We focus on 4 approaches2 and the experimental setup is
presented in §3. In §4 we evaluate the following acqui-
sition dimensions: quality of extracted candidates and of
association measures, use of computational resources and
flexibility. Thus, this research presents a comparative in-
vestigation of available approaches and indicates the best
cost-benefit ratio in a given context (language, type, cor-
pus size), pointing out current limitations and suggesting
future avenues of research for the field.

2 MWE Acquisition Approaches

Efforts for the evaluation of MWE acquisition approaches
usually focus on a single technique or compare the qual-
ity of association measures (AMs) used to rank a fixed
annotated list of MWEs. For instance, Evert and Krenn
(2005) and Seretan (2008) specifically evaluate and anal-
yse the lexical AMs used in MWE extraction on small
samples of bigram candidates. Pearce (2002), systemat-
ically evaluates a set of techniques for MWE extraction
on a small test set of English collocations. Analogously,
Pecina (2005) and Ramisch et al. (2008) present exten-
sive comparisons of individual AMs and of their combi-
nation for MWE extraction in Czech, German and En-
glish. There have also been efforts for the extrinsic eval-
uation of MWEs for NLP applications such as informa-
tion retrieval (Xu et al., 2010), word sense disambigua-
tion (Finlayson and Kulkarni, 2011) and MT (Carpuat
and Diab, 2010).

One recent initiative aiming at more comparable eval-

mented tools. Therefore, outside the scope of this work are proprietary

lished techniques for which no available implementation is provided.

uations of MWE acquisition approaches was in the form
of a shared task (Grégoire et al., 2008). However, the
present work differs from the shared task in its aims. The
latter considered only the ranking of precompiled MWE
lists using AMs or linguistic filters at the end of extrac-
tion. However, for many languages and domains, no such
lists are available. In addition, the evaluation results pro-
duced for the shared task may be difficult to generalise,
as some of the evaluations prioritized the precision of the
techniques without considering the recall or the novelty
of the extracted MWEs. To date little has been said about
the practical concerns involving MWE acquisition, like
computational resources, flexibility or availability. With
this work, we hope to help filling this gap by performing
a broad evaluation of the acquisition process as a whole,
considering many different parameters.

We focus on 4 approaches for MWE acquisition from
corpora, which follow the general trend in the area of us-
ing shallow linguistic (lemmas, POS, stopwords) and/or
statistical (counts, AMs) information to distinguishing
ordinary sequences (e.g. yellow dress, go to a concert)
from MWEs (e.g. black box, go by a name). In addition
to the brief description below, Section 4.4 underlines the
main differences between the approaches.

1. LocalMaxs3 extracts MWEs by generating all pos-
sible n-grams from a sentence and then filtering
them based on the local maxima of the AM’s dis-
tribution (Silva and Lopes, 1999). It is based
purely on word counts and is completely language
independent, but it is not possible to directly in-
tegrate linguistic information in order to target a
specific type of construction.4 The evaluation
includes both LocalMaxs Strict which prioritizes
high precision (henceforth LocMax-S) and Local-
Maxs Relaxed which focuses on high recall (hence-
forth LocMax-R). A variation of the original algo-
rithm, SENTA, has been proposed to deal with non-
contiguous expressions (da Silva et al., 1999). How-
ever, it is computationally costly5 and there is no
freely available implementation.

2. MWE toolkit6 (mwetk) is an environment for
type and language-independent MWE acquisition,
integrating linguistic and frequency information
(Ramisch et al., 2010). It generates a targeted list
of MWE candidates extracted and filtered according
to user-defined criteria like POS sequences and a set

index.html

4Although this can be simulated by concatenating words and POS
tags together in order to form a token.

5It is based on the calculation of all possible n-grams in a sen-
tence, which explode in number when going from contiguous to non-
contiguous n-grams.

of statistical AMs. It is an integrated framework for
MWE treatment, providing from corpus preprocess-
ing facilities to the automatic evaluation of the re-
sulting list with respect to a reference. Its input is
a corpus annotated with POS, lemmas and depen-
dency syntax, or if these are not available, raw text.

3. Ngram Statistics Package7 (NSP) is a traditional
approach for the statistical analysis of n-grams in
texts (Pedersen et al., 2011). It provides tools for
counting n-grams and calculating AMs, where an n-
gram is a sequence of n words occurring either con-
tiguously or within a window of w words in a sen-
tence. While most of the measures are only appli-
cable to bigrams, some of them are also extended to
trigrams and 4-grams. The set of available AMs in-
cludes robust and theoretically sound measures such
as log-likelihood and Fischer’s exact test. Although
there is no direct support to linguistic information
such as POS, it is possible to simulate them to some
extent using the same workaround as for LocMax.

4. UCS toolkit8 provides a large set of sophisticated
AMs. It focuses on high accuracy calculations for
bigram AMs, but unlike the other approaches, it
starts from a list of candidates and their respec-
tive frequencies, relying on external tools for corpus
preprocessing and candidate extraction. Therefore,
questions concerning contiguous n-grams and sup-
port of linguistic filters are not dealt with by UCS. In
our experiments, we will use the list of candidates
generated by mwetk as input for UCS.

As the focus of this work is on MWE acquisition (iden-
tification and extraction), other tasks related to MWE
treatment, namely interpretation, classification and appli-
cations (Anastasiou et al., 2009), are not considered in
this paper. This is the case, for instance, of approaches
for dictionary-based in-context MWE token identification
requiring an initial dictionary of valid MWEs, like jMWE
(Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011).

3 Experimental Setup

For comparative purposes, we investigate the acquisition
of MWEs in two languages, English (en) and French

(fr), analysing nominal and verbal expressions in en and
nominal in fr,9 obtained with the following rules:

• Nominal expressions en: a noun preceded by a se-
quence of one or more nouns or adjectives, e.g. Eu-
ropean Union, clock radio, clown anemone fish.
• Nominal expressions fr: a noun followed by either

an adjective or a prepositional complement (with the
prepositions de, à and en) followed by an option-
ally determined noun, e.g. algue verte, aliénation de
bien, allergie à la poussière.
• Verbal expressions en: verb-particle constructions

formed by a verb (except be and have) followed by
a prepositional particle10 not further than 5 words
after it, e.g. give up, switch the old computer off.

To test the influence of corpus size on performance,
three fragments of the en and fr parts of the Eu-
roparl corpus v311 were used as test corpora: (S)mall,
(M)edium and (L)arge, summarised in Table 1.

The extracted MWEs were automatically evaluated
against the following gold standards: WordNet 3, the
Cambridge Dictionary of Phrasal Verbs, and the VPC
(Baldwin, 2008) and CN (Kim and Baldwin, 2008)
datasets 12 for en; the Lexique-Grammaire13 for fr. The
total number of entries is listed below, along with the
number of entries occurring at least twice in each cor-
pus (in parentheses), which was the denominator used to
calculate recall in § 4.1:

• Nominal expressions en: 59,683 entries (S: 122, M:
764, L: 2,710);
• Nominal expressions fr: 69,118 entries (S: 220, M:

1,406, L: 4,747);
• Verbal expressions en: 1,846 entries (S: 699, M:

1,846, L: 1,846).

4 Evaluation Results
The evaluation of MWE acquisition is an open problem.
While classical measures like precision and recall assume
that a complete (or at least broad-coverage) gold standard
exists, manual annotation of top-n candidates and mean
average precision (MAP) are labour-intensive even when
applied to a small sample, emphasizing precision regard-
less of the number of acquired new expressions. As ap-
proaches differ in the way they allow the description of
extraction criteria, we evaluate candidate extraction sep-
arately from AMs.

9As fr does not present many verb-particle constructions and due
to the lack of availability of resource for other types of fr verbal ex-
pressions (e.g. light verb constructions), only nominal expressions are
considered.

comparison across languages/MWE types.

4.1 Extracted Candidates

We consider as MWE candidates the initial set of se-
quences before any AM is applied. Candidate extraction
is performed through the application of patterns describ-
ing the target MWEs in terms of POS sequences, as de-
scribed in § 3. To minimise potential cases of noise, can-
didates occurring only once in the corpus were discarded.
We compare the quality of these candidates in terms of
(P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)-measure using the gold stan-
dard references described in § 3. These measures are un-
derestimations as they assume that candidates not in the
gold standard are false MWEs, whereas they may simply
be absent due to coverage limitations.

The quality of candidates extracted from the medium-
size corpus (M) varies across MWE types/languages, as
shown in Figure 1. The candidates for UCS are obtained
by keeping only the bigrams in the candidate list returned
by the mwetk. For nominal MWEs, the approaches have
similar patterns of performance in the two languages,
with high recall and low precision yielding an F-measure
of around 10 to 15%. The variation between en and fr
can be partly explained by the differences in size of the
gold standards for each of these languages. Further re-
search would be needed to determine to what degree the
characteristics of these languages and the set of extraction
patterns influence these results. For verbal expressions,
LocMax has high precision (around 70%) but low recall
while the other approaches have more balanced P and R
values around 20%. This is partly due to the need for
simulating POS filters for extraction of verbal MWE can-
didates with LocMax. The filter consists of keeping only
contiguous n-grams in which the first and the last words
matched verb+particle pattern and removing intervening
words.

The techniques differ in terms of extraction strategy:
(i) mwetk and NSP allow the definition of linguistic fil-
ters while LocMax only allows the application of grep-

like filters after extraction; (ii) there is no preliminary fil-
tering in mwetk and NSP, they simply return all candi-
dates matching a pattern, while LocMax filters the candi-
dates based on the local maxima criterion; (iii) LocMax
only extracts contiguous candidates while the others al-
low discontiguous candidates. The way mwetk and NSP
extract discontiguous candidates differs: the former ex-
tracts all verbs with particles no further than 5 positions to
the right. NSP extracts bigrams in a window of 5 words,
and then filters the list keeping only those in which the
first word is a verb and that contain a particle. However,
the results are similar, with slightly better values for NSP.

The evaluation of en nominal candidates according to
corpus size is shown in Table 2.14 For all approaches,
precision decreases when the corpus size increases as
more noise is returned, while recall increases for all ex-
cept LocMax. This may be due to the latter ignoring
smaller n-grams when larger candidates containing them
become sufficiently frequent, as is the case when the cor-
pus increases. Table 3 shows that the candidates extracted
by LocMax are almost completely covered by the candi-
dates extracted by the other approaches. The relaxed ver-
sion extracts slighly more candidates, but still much less
than mwetk, NSP and UCS, which all extract a similar
set of candidates. In order to distinguish the performance
of the approaches, we need to analyse the AMs they use
to rank the candidates.

4.2 Association Measures
Traditionally, to evaluate an AM, the candidates are
ranked according to it and a threshold value is applied,
below which the candidates are discarded. However, if
we average the precision considering all true MWEs as

threshold points, we obtain the mean average precision
(MAP) of the measure without setting a hard threshold.

Table 4 presents the MAP values for the tested AMs15

applied to the candidates extracted from the large cor-
pus (L), where the larger the value, the better the perfor-
mance. We used as baseline the assignment of a random
score and the use of the raw frequency for the candidates.
Except for mwetk:t and mwetk:pmi, all MAP values
are significantly different from the two baselines, with a
two-tailed t test for difference of means assuming unequal
sample sizes and variances (p-value < 0.005).

The LocMax:glue AM performs best for all types
of MWEs, suggesting local maxima as a good generic
MWE indicator and glue as an efficient AM to generate
highly precise results (considering the difficulty of this
task). On the other hand this approach returns a small set
of candidates and this may be problematic depending on
the task (e.g. for building a wide-coverage lexicon). For
mwetk, the best overall AM is the Dice coefficient; the
other measures are not consistently better than the base-
line, or perform better for one MWE type than for the
other. The Poisson-Stirling (ps) measure performed quite
well, while the other two measures tested for NSP per-
formed below baseline for some cases. Finally, as we ex-
pected, the AMs applied by UCS perform all above base-
line and, for nominal MWEs, are comparable to the best
AM (e.g. Poisson.pv and local.MI). The MAP for verbal
expressions varies much for UCS (from 30% to 53% ), but
none of the measures comes close to the MAP of the glue
(87.06%). None of the approaches provides a straightfor-
ward method to choose or combine different AMs.

4.3 Computational resources
In the decision of which AM to adopt, factors like the de-
gree of MWE flexibility and computational performance
may be taken into account. For instance, the Dice coef-
ficient can be applied to any length of n-gram quite fast

15Due to length limitations, we cannot detail the calculation of the
evaluated AMs; please refer to the documentation of each approach,
cited in § 2, for more details.

while more sophisticated measures like Poisson.pv can be
applied only to 2-grams and sometimes use much com-
putational resources. Even if one could argue that we can
be lenient towards a slow offline extraction process, the
extra waiting may not be worth a slight quality improve-
ment. Moreover, memory limitations are an issue if no
large computer clusters are available.

In Figure 2, we plotted in log-scale the time in sec-
onds used by each approach to extract nominal and ver-
bal expressions in en, using a dedicated 2.4GHz quad-
core Linux machine with 4Gb RAM. For nominal expres-
sions, time increases linearly with the size of the corpus,
whereas for verbal expressions it seems to increase faster
than the size of the corpus. UCS is the slowest approach
for both MWE types while NSP and LocMax-S are the
fastest. However, it is important to emphasize that NSP
consumed more than 3Gb memory to extract 4- and 5-
grams from the large corpus and LocMax-R could not
handle the large corpus at all. In theory, all techniques can
be applied to arbitrarily large corpora if we used a map-
reduce approach (e.g. NSP provides tools to split and join
the corpus). However, the goal of this evaluation is to dis-
cover the performance of the techniques with no manual
optimization. In this sense, mwetk seems to provide an
average trade-off between quality and resources used.

pora but takes as input a list of bigrams and their counts.

While it only supports n-grams of size 2, NSP imple-
ments some of the AMs for 3 and 4-grams and mwetk
and LocMax have no constraint on the number of words.
LocMax extracts only contiguous MWEs while mwetk
allows the extraction of unrestrictedly distant words and
NSP allows the specification of a window of maximum w
ignored words between each two words of the candidate.
Only mwetk integrates linguistic filters on the lemma,
POS and syntactic annotation, but this was performed us-
ing external tools (sed/grep) for the other approaches with
similar results. The AMs implemented by LocMax and
mwetk are conceived for any size of n-gram and are thus
less statistically sound than the clearly designed measures
used by UCS and, to some extent, by NSP (Fisher test).
The large corpus used in our experiments was not sup-
ported by LocMax-R version, but LocMax-S has a ver-
sion that deals with large corpora, as well as mwetk and
NSP. Finally, all of these approaches are freely available
for download and documented on the web.

5 Conclusions and future work
We evaluated the automatic acquisition of MWEs from
corpora. The dimensions evaluated were type of
construction (for flexibility and contiguity), language
and corpus size. We evaluated two steps separately:
candidate extraction and filtering with AMs. Can-
didate lists are very similar, with approaches like

mwetk and NSP returning more candidates (they cover
most of the nominal MWEs in the corpus) but hav-
ing lower precision. LocMax-S presented a remark-
ably high precision for verbal expressions. However,
the choice of an AM may not only take into ac-
count its MAP but also its flexibility and the compu-
tational resources used. Our results suggest that the
approaches could be combined using machine learn-
ing (Pecina, 2005). The data used in our experi-
ments is available at http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/
~ceramisch/?page=downloads/mwecompare.

In the future, we would like to develop this evaluation
further by taking into account other characteristics such
as the domain and genre of the source corpus. Such eval-
uation would be useful to guide future research on spe-
cialised multiword terminology extraction, determining
differences with respect to generic MWE extraction. We
would also like to evaluate other MWE-related tasks (e.g.
classification, interpretation) and also dictionary-based
identification (Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011) and bilin-
gual MWE acquisition (Carpuat and Diab, 2010). Fi-
nally, we believe that an application-based extrinsic eval-
uation involving manual validation of candidates would
ultimately demonstrate the usefulness of current MWE
acquisition techniques.
