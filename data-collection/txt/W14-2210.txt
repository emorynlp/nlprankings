Abstract 

In this paper we outline our work to build 
Somali language Corpora. A read-speech 
corpus named Asaas and containing 
about 10 hours and 26 minutes of good 
quality signal fully transcribed and well 
corrected with a well-balanced phonetic 
distribution is presented. Secondly we 
outline a Web-based Somali textual cor-
pus named Wargeys and containing about 
3 million of words and more than 
120 000 different words. This corpus is 
formatted and the spelling fluctuation is 
standardized. 

1 Introduction 
Transcribed speech corpora and huge text corpo-
ra are the core of systems used to construct 
acoustic and language models (Jelinek, F. 1976). 
Constructing of large transcribed corpora is time 
consuming and expensive, even if some re-
searchers (Hughes et al, 2010; Badenhorst et al, 
2009; Schlippe et al, 2012; De Pauw et al, 2009) 
are working on how to create automatically and 
quickly  speech corpora by using different sys-
tems including phone applications. 

If large transcribed speech corpora, more than 
100 hours, exist for European languages like 
English, French or Spanish, the situation is quite 
different for African languages. About 2000 lan-
guages are spoken in Africa. Large part of them 
is not yet written and is today threatened of dis-
appearing. Building speech Corpora and speech 
processing tools are crucial for each African lan-
guage. 

In this paper we present in section 2 the Soma-
li language. Section 3 will focus on  the first So-
mali read-speech corpus called Asaas (Beginning 

in Somali) and also the first Web-Based Somali 
Language Model and text Corpus called Wargeys 
(Newspaper in Somali) in Section 4. 

2 Somali language 
Four languages are spoken in Djibouti. French 
and Arabic are official languages, Somali and 
Afar are native and widely spoken. Somali and 
Afar are Cushitic languages within the Afro- asi-
atic family. Somali language is spoken in several 
countries in East of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, 
Somalia and Kenya) by a population estimated 
between 11 to 13 million of inhabitants. The dif-
ferent variants are Somali-somali, Somali-maay, 
Somali-dabarre, Somali-garre, Somali-jiiddu and 
Somali-tunni. Somali-somali and Somali-maay 
are the most widely spread variants (80% and 
17%). We only process the Somali-somali vari-
ant, commonly known as Somali language and 
spoken in Djibouti. The phonetic structure of this 
language has 22 consonants and 5 basic vowels 
which all occur in front and back versions 
(+ATR or -ATR). These 10 vowels occur in long 
and short pairs, giving 20 in total (Saeed, J. 
1999). There are also 5 diphthongs which occur 
in front and back, long and short versions. Soma-
li is also a tone accent language with 2 to 3 lexi-
cal tones (Hyman, L. 2010; Saeed, J. 1987; Gac, 
D.  2002). The written system was adopted in 
1972, and there are no textual archives before 
this date. It uses Roman letters and doesn’t con-
sider the tonal accent in the current form. Somali 
words are composed by the concatenation of syl-
lable structures (Bendjaballah, S. 1998. Saeed, J. 
1999).  

3 Somali Read-Speech corpus 
3.1 Prompts Selection 
A series of documents was selected from Somali 
online newspapers that use variant Somali-

73



Somali presented in Section 2. These texts are 
used to prepare the prompts. Particular attention 
was given to the quality of the selected texts (di-
versity of topics, phoneme distribution, readabil-
ity, number of errors, etc.). Table 1 shows the 
distribution of selected text. It consists of 72,407 
words (representing 2,335 sentences) with 
12,807 different words.

Words 72 407 
Different Words 12 807

3.2 Speakers selection 
French and Arabic languages are official 
languages in Djibouti. The transcription of 
Somali language in Roman letters facilitates its 
reading. But it is difficult to find persons who 
can read it fluently. Fifteen Somali-speaking men 
living in Djibouti and without any problem of 
pronunciation were preselected. At last 10 people 
were selected for recordings according to their 
reading fluency. Table 2 shows information on 
their social class, their study level and their age.  
All recorders were volunteers.

Table 2: Speakers Characteristics 

3.3 Recordings 
The recordings took place in the Djibouti 
Institute of Science and Information 
Technologies. They were recorded in mono in an 
office without any environment noise (fan, air-
conditioner, phone, etc.) with a standard 
microphone with a sampling frequency of 16 
KHz and a 16-bit encoding. 

3.4 Corpus characteristics 
The duration of the Somali read-speech corpus is 
10 hours and 26 minutes. We named it Asaas, 

which means "beginning" in the Somali 
language. Its phonetic distribution is given in 
Figure 1. We can consider that this distribution is 
well-balanced because it is quite similar to the 
one of the huge amount of the Somali text corpus 
(3 million of words). The phoneme /a/ occurs 
approximately 20 % of all the phonemes. The 
glottal phoneme /’/ ( ʔ in IPA) represents about 
0,2%. 
 

 
Figure 1: Phonetic distribution of Asaas Corpus 

 
The duration of phonemes varies according to 
the speakers. However, in general, long vowels 
and fricatives are the longest ones. The short 
vowels and plosives have smaller duration. The 
phoneme which has the longest duration is /sh/ (∫ 
in IPA). The average duration of all phonemes is 
given in Figure 2. Plosives phonemes are split 
into two parts: the burst (Btt for the /t/ phoneme, 
Bkk for the /k/ one and the occlusion Ott for the 
/t/ one and Okk for the /k/). 
The average rate of the speech is 1.93 words per 
second. 

 
Figure 2: average duration of phonemes 

 
There is a real difference between the duration of 
short and long vowels. Thus, long /a/ (written aa 
is Somali) is 2 times longer than the short /a/ 
(written a in Somali) and the /uu/ is 1.75 times 
longer than the /u/. On average, the ratio of 

74



duration between long and short vowels is 1.86. 
A comparison of the duration of long and short 
vowels is given in Figure 3. This feature can be 
used in acoustic modeling by creating two 
separate models for each vowel (long and short). 
It is also possible to recognize them with the 
language model. But both language model and 
separate acoustic models will probably improve 
the Word Error Rate.

4 Somali Text Corpus 
Corpus containing millions of words or even 
billions of words is usually used for language 
modeling. If these data are mostly available for 
English and French languages, it is quite 
different for newly written languages like 
African languages. The lack of textual data 
constitutes a real handicap. 

Grefenstette (2002) shows that African 
languages are gaining ground on the Web, even 
if European languages are largely dominant. 
Despite this growth their presence on the web is 
insufficient.  This growth is relative, because in 
large part due to South African websites. 
Shigeaki (2008) clearly shows the prominence of 
South African sites on the continent. 

Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) propose a 
formula to estimate the number of words found 
on the Internet for a given language. For this, we 
divide the number of times a word has been 
found by a search engine in cyberspace by the 
relative frequency of the word in that language. 
The average result on a predefined list of words 
provides an estimation of the number of words 
on the web. Estimation calculated in March 2014 
for the Somali language gives about 500 million 
Somali words on the Web. The frequency of 
Somali words used was calculated on the textual 
corpus WARGEYS. 

Many researchers are involved on how to create 
automatically textual corpora from the Internet 
for under-resourced languages (Ghani et al, 
2001. Vaufreydaz et al, 1999). For our purposes 
we selected and downloaded a set of Somali 
newspapers on the Internet. As the audio corpus, 
the selection criteria were the variant of the 
language, the diversity of topics and the number 
of errors.  

4.1 Formatting  
The text downloaded is not directly usable. After 
removal of HTML tags, we proceeded to some 
transformations dealing with abbreviations, dates 
and times, numbers, proper names, foreign words 
and punctuation. 

4.2 Spelling normalization 
The Somali language as most of African 
languages is written after the independence 
period (1960-1970). So the orthography is not 
yet stabilized. The same word can be written in 
different ways according to people. Calvet, L. 
(1987) shows that the word eight in Mandingo is 
written segin in Mali, seyin in Guinea and seegin 
in Burkina Faso.  In Somali Language the word 
President appears like madaxweyne or 
madaxwayne. This lack of standardization is 
common for most of the African languages and 
disrupts the language models quality as well as 
the Automatic Speech Recognition systems 
accuracy. 

To resolve this problem, for a given simple 
word like madaxweyne we considered that the 
most frequent spelling is the good one. If 
madaxweyne appears 17 times in the corpus and 
madaxwayne 9 times, Madaxweyne is selected 
and all the madaxwayne were changed to 
madaxweyne. 

For the component words like iskumid and 
isku mid, we choice the separate orthography like 
isku mid.  This choice is made to separate 
syllable because if iskumid (Perhaps Out of 
Vocabulary Word) is not recognized by a ASR 
system, isku can be recognized or mid can be 
recognized. 

4.3 Corpus Characteristics 
Somali web-based textual corpus was named 
WARGEYS (Newspaper in Somali) because this 
corpus contains News topics and is similar to the 
French one called BREF (Lamel, L 1991) and 
gathered from the French newspaper Le Monde. 
Table 4 shows the characteristics of this corpus. 
WARGEYS contains 2 820 000 words with 121 

75



000 different words and 84 000 sentences with 
an average of 33 words per sentence.  
 

Component Amount 
Words 2 820 000 
Different words 121 000

Table 1: Distribution WARGEYS corpus  
 
The figure 4 shows that the phonetic distribution 
of the two corpus Asaas and WARGEYS are 
similar.

5 Conclusion 
Somali read-speech corpus Asaas, consists of 10 
hours and 26 minutes of good quality signal fully 
transcribed and well corrected. The phonetic 
distribution of this corpus is well-balanced. The 
Web-based Somali textual corpus WARGEYS 
contains 3 million of words and more than 
120 000 different words. This corpus is 
formatted and the spelling fluctuation is 
standardized.
