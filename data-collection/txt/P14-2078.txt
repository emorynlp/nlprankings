Abstract

The disambiguation algorithm presented in
this paper is implemented in SemLinker, an
entity linking system. First, named entities
are linked to candidate Wikipedia pages by
a generic annotation engine. Then, the al-
gorithm re-ranks candidate links according to
mutual relations between all the named enti-
ties found in the document. The evaluation
is based on experiments conducted on the test
corpus of the TAC-KBP 2012 entity linking
task.

1 Introduction

The Entity Linking (EL) task consists in linking
name mentions of named entities (NEs) found in a
document to their corresponding entities in a ref-
erence Knowledge Base (KB). These NEs can be
of type person (PER), organization (ORG), etc.,
and they are usually represented in the KB by a
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Dealing with
ambiguity is one of the key difficulties in this task,
since mentions are often highly polysemous, and
potentially related to many different KB entries.
Various approaches have been proposed to solve
the named entity disambiguation (NED) problem.
Most of them involve the use of surface forms ex-
tracted from Wikipedia. Surface forms consist of
a word or a group of words that match lexical units
like Paris or New York City. They are used as
matching sequences to locate corresponding can-
didate entries in the KB, and then to disambiguate
those candidates using similarity measures.

The NED problem is related to the Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) problem (Navigli, 2009),
and is often more challenging since mentions of
NEs can be highly ambiguous. For instance,
names of places can be very common as is Paris,
which refers to 26 different places in Wikipedia.
Hence, systems that attempt to address the NED

problem must include disambiguation resources.
In the context of the Named Entity Recognition
(NER) task, such resources can be generic and
generative. This generative approach does not ap-
ply to the EL task where each entity to be linked to
a semantic description has a specific word context,
marker of its exact identity.

One of the classical approach to conduct the
disambiguation process in NED applications is to
consider the context of the mention to be mapped,
and compare this context with contextual informa-
tion about the potential target entities (see for in-
stance the KIM system (Popov et al., 2003)). This
is usually done using similarity measures (such as
cosine similarity, weighted Jaccard distance, KL
divergence...) that evaluate the distance between
a bag of words related to a candidate annotation,
and the words surrounding the entity to annotate
in the text.

In more recent approaches, it is suggested that
annotation processes based on similarity distance
measures can be improved by making use of other
annotations present in the same document. Such
techniques are referred to as semantic related-
ness (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), collective dis-
ambiguation (Hoffart et al., 2011b), or joint dis-
ambiguation (Fahrni et al., 2012). The idea is to
evaluate in a set of candidate links which one is
the most likely to be correct by taking the other
links contained in the document into account. For
example, if a NE describes a city name like Paris,
it is more probable that the correct link for this
city name designates Paris (France) rather than
Paris (Texas) if a neighbor entity offers candidate
links semantically related to Paris (France) like
the Seine river or the Champs-Elysées. Such tech-
niques mostly involve exploration of graphs result-
ing of all the candidate annotations proposed for a
given document, and try to rank the best candi-
dates for each annotation using an ontology. The
ontology (like YAGO or DBPedia) provides a pre-

476



existing set of potential relations between the enti-
ties to link (like for instance, in our previous exam-
ple, Paris (France) has river Seine) that will
be used to rank the best candidates according to
their mutual presence in the document.

In this paper we explore the capabilities of a dis-
ambiguation algorithm using all the available an-
notation layers of NEs to improve their links. The
paper makes the following novel propositions: 1)
the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of
candidates is replaced by internal links and cate-
gories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coher-
ence of entities is improved prior to the calcula-
tion of semantic relatedness using a co-reference
resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction
method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough
to improve the performance of existing entity link-
ing annotation engines, which are capable of pro-
viding a set of ranked candidates for each annota-
tion in a document.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes related works. The proposed method is
presented in Section 3 where we explain how our
SemLinker system prepares documents that con-
tain mentions to disambiguate, then we detail the
disambiguation algorithm. The evaluation of the
complete system is provided in Section 4. Finally,
we discuss the obtained results, and conclude.

2 Related Work

Entity annotation and linking in natural language
text has been extensively studied in NLP research.
A strong effort has been conducted recently by the
TAC-KBP evaluation task (Ji et al., 2010) to cre-
ate standardized corpus, and annotation standards
based on Wikipedia for evaluation and comparison
of EL systems. In this paper, we consider the TAC-
KBP framework. We describe below some recent
approaches proposed for solving the EL task.

2.1 Wikipedia-based Disambiguation Methods

The use of Wikipedia for explicit disambiguation
dates back to (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006) who built
a system that compared the context of a mention
to the Wikipedia categories of an entity candidate.
Lately, (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008;
Nguyen and Cao, 2008) extended this framework
by using richer features for similarity comparison.
Some authors like Milne and Witten (2008) uti-
lized machine learning methods rather than a sim-
ilarity function to map mentions to entities. They

also introduced the notion of semantic relatedness.
Alternative propositions were suggested in other
works like (Han and Zhao, 2009) that considered
the relatedness of common noun phrases in a men-
tion context with Wikipedia article names. While
all these approaches focus on semantic relation be-
tween entities, their potential is limited by the sep-
arate mapping of candidate links for each mention.

2.2 Semantic Web Compliant Methods

More recently, several systems have been
launched as web services dedicated to EL tasks.
Most of them are compliant with new emergent
semantic web standards like LinkedData network.
DBPedia Spotlight (Mendes et al., 2011) is a
system that finds mentions of DBpedia (Auer
et al., 2007) resources in a textual document.
Wikimeta (Charton and Gagnon, 2012) is another
system relying on DBpedia. It uses bags of words
to disambiguate semantic entities according to
a cosine similarity algorithm. Those systems
have been compared with commercial ones
like AlchemyAPI, Zemanta, or Open Calais
in (Gangemi, 2013). The study showed that
they perform differently on various essential
aspects of EL tasks (mention detection, linking,
disambiguation). This suggests a wide range of
potential improvements on many aspects of the
EL task. Only some of these systems introduce
the semantic relatedness in their methods like
the AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011b) system. It
proposes a disambiguation method that combines
popularity-based priors, similarity measures, and
coherence. It relies on the Wikipedia-derived
YAGO2 (Hoffart et al., 2011a) knowledge base.

3 Proposed Algorithm

We propose a mutual disambiguation algorithm
that improves the accuracy of entity links in a doc-
ument by using successive corrections applied to
an annotation object representing this document.
The annotation object is composed of information
extracted from the document along with linguistic
and semantic annotations as described hereafter.

3.1 Annotation Object

Documents are processed by an annotator capable
of producing POS tags for each word, as well as
spans, NE surface forms, NE labels and ranked
candidate Wikipedia URIs for each candidate NE.
For each document D, this knowledge is gathered

477



in an array called annotation object, which has ini-
tially one row per document lexical unit. Since the
system focuses on NEs, rows with lexical units
that do not belong to a NE SF are dropped from
the annotation object, and NE SF are refined as de-
scribed in (Charton et al., 2014). When NE SF are
spanned over several rows, these rows are merged
into a single one. Thus, we consider an annotation
object AD, which is an array with a row for each
NE, and columns storing related knowledge.

If n NEs were annotated in D, then AD has n
rows. If l candidate URIs are provided for each
NE, then AD has (l + 4) columns cu,u∈{1,l+4}.
Columns c1 to cl store Wikipedia URIs associated
with NEs, ordered by decreasing values of likeli-
hood. Column cl+1 stores the offset of the NEs,
cl+2 stores their surface forms, cl+3 stores the NE
labels (PER, ORG, ...), and cl+4 stores the (vec-
tors of) POS tags associated with the NE surface
forms. AD contains all the available knowledge
about the NEs found inD. Before being processed
by the disambiguation module,AD is dynamically
updated by correction processes.

3.2 Named Entity Label Correction
To support the correction process based on co-
reference chains, the system tries to correct NE
labels for all the NEs listed in the annotation ob-
ject. The NE label correction process assigns the
same NE label to all the NEs associated with the
same first rank URI. For all the rows inAD, sets of
rows with identical first rank URIs are considered.
Then, for each set, NE labels are counted per type,
and all the rows in a same set are updated with the
most frequent NE label found in the set, i.e. all the
NEs in this set are tagged with this label.

3.3 Correction Based on Co-reference Chains
First rank candidate URIs are corrected by a pro-
cess that relies on co-reference chains found in
the document. The co-reference detection is con-
ducted using the information recorded in the anno-
tation object. Among the NEs present in the docu-
ment, the ones that co-refer are identified and clus-
tered by logical rules applied to the content of the
annotation object. When a co-reference chain of
NEs is detected, the system assigns the same URI
to all the members of the chain. This URI is se-
lected through a decision process that gives more
weight to longer surface forms and frequent URIs.
The following example illustrates an application
of this correction process:

Three sentences are extracted from a document
about Paris, the French capital. NEs are indicated
in brackets, first rank URIs and surface forms are
added below the content of each sentence.
- [Paris] is famous around the world.
URI1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris Hilton

NE surface form: Paris
- The [city of Paris] attracts millions of tourists.
URI1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris

NE surface form: city of Paris
- The [capital of France] is easy to reach by train.
URI1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris

NE surface form: capital of France
The three NEs found in these sentences com-

pose a co-reference chain. The second NE has
a longer surface form than the first one, and
its associated first rank URI is the most fre-
quent. Hence, the co-reference correction pro-
cess will assign the right URI to the first NE
(URI1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris), which
was wrongly linked to the actress Paris Hilton.

3.4 Mutual Disambiguation Process

The extraction of an accurate link is a process oc-
curring after the URI annotation of NEs in the
whole document. The system makes use of all
the semantic content stored in AD to locally im-
prove the precision of each URI annotation in the
document. The Mutual Disambiguation Process
(MDP) relies on the graph of all the relations (in-
ternal links, categories) between Wikipedia con-
tent related to the document annotations.

A basic example of semantic relatedness that
should be captured is explained hereafter. Let us
consider the mention IBM in a given document.
Candidate NE annotations for this mention can be
International Business Machine or International
Brotherhood of Magicians. But if the IBM men-
tion co-occurs with a Thomas Watson, Jr mention
in the document, there will probably be more links
between the International Business Machine and
Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages than
between the International Brotherhood of Magi-
cians and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia
pages. The purpose of the MDP is to capture this
semantic relatedness information contained in the
graph of links extracted from Wikipedia pages re-
lated to each candidate annotation.

In MDP, for each Wikipedia URI candidate an-
notation, all the internal links and categories con-
tained in the source Wikipedia document related

478



to this URI are collected. This information will be
used to calculate a weight for each of the l can-
didate URI annotations of each mention. For a
given NE, this weight is expected to measure the
mutual relations of a candidate annotation with all
the other candidate annotations of NEs in the doc-
ument. The input of the MDP is an annotation
object AD with n rows, obtained as explained in
Section 3.1. For all i ∈ [[1, n]], k ∈ [[1, l]], we build
the set Ski , composed of the Wikipedia URIs and
categories contained in the source Wikipedia doc-
ument related to the URI stored in AD[i][k] that
we will refer to as URIki to ease the reading.
Scoring:
For all i, j ∈ [[1, n]], k ∈ [[1, l]], we want to cal-
culate the weight of mutual relations between the
candidate URIki and all the first rank candidates
URI1j for j 6= i. The calculation combines two
scores that we called direct semantic relation score
(dsr score) and common semantic relation score
(csr score):

- the dsr score for URIki sums up the number of
occurrences of URIki in S

1
j for all j ∈ [[1, n]]−{i}.

- the csr score for URIki sums up the number of
common URIs and categories between Ski and S

1
j

for all j ∈ [[1, n]]− {i}.
We assumed the dsr score was much more

semantically significant than the csr score, and
translated this assumption in the weight calcula-
tion by introducing two correction parameters α
and β used in the final scoring calculation.
Re-ranking:
For all i ∈ [[1, n]], for each set of URIs {URIki , k ∈
[[1, l]]}, the re-ranking process is conducted ac-
cording to the following steps:
For all i ∈ I ,

1. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate dsr score(URIki )
2. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate csr score(URIki )
3. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate

mutual relation score(URIki ) =
α.dsr score(URIki )+β.csr score(URI

k
i )

4. re-order {URIki , k ∈ [[1, l]]}, by
decreasing order of mutual relation score.

In the following, we detail the MDP in the con-
text of a toy example to illustrate how it works.
The document contains two sentences, NE men-
tions are in bold:

IBM has 12 research laboratories

worldwide. Thomas J. Watson, Jr.

became president of the company.

For the first NE mention [IBM], AD contains
two candidate URIs identifying two different re-
sources:

[IBM] URI11 ≡ International Brotherhood of Magicians
URI21 ≡ International Business Machines Corporation

For the second NE mention [Thomas J.
Watson, Jr.], AD contains the following can-
didate URI, which is ranked first:

[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.] URI12 ≡ Thomas Watson, Jr.

S11 gathers URIs and categories contained in the
International Brotherhood of Magicians Wikipedia
page. S21 is associated to the International Business
Machines Corporation, and S12 to the Thomas Watson,
Jr. page. dsr score(URI11) sums up the number of
occurrences of URI11 in S

1
j for all j ∈ [[1, n]]−{1}.

Hence, in the current example, dsr score(URI11) is
the number of occurrences of URI11 in S

1
2 , namely

the number of times the International Brotherhood
of Magicians are cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr.
page. Similarly, dsr score(URI21) is equal to the
number of times the International Business Machines
Corporation is cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr. page.
csr score(URI11) sums up the number of common
URIs and categories between S11 and S

1
2 , i.e. the

number of URIs and categories appearing in both
International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas
Watson, Jr. pages. csr score(URI21) counts the
number of URIs and categories appearing in both
International Business Machines Corporation and
Thomas Watson, Jr. pages.
After calculation, we have:
mutual relation score(URI11) < mutual relation score(URI21)

The candidate URIs for [IBM] are re-ranked
accordingly, and International Business Machines
Corporation becomes its first rank candidate.

4 Experiments and Results

SemLinker has been evaluated on the TAC-KBP
2012 EL task (Charton et al., 2013). In this task,
mentions of entities found in a document collec-
tion must be linked to entities in a reference KB, or
to new named entities discovered in the collection.
The document collection built for KBP 2012 con-
tains a combination of newswire articles (News),

posts to blogs and newsgroups (Web). Given a
query that consists of a document with a specified
name mention of an entity, the task is to determine
the correct node in the reference KB for the entity,
adding a new node for the entity if it is not already
in the reference KB. Entities can be of type person
(PER), organization (ORG), or geopolitical entity
(GPE). The reference knowledge base is derived
from an October 2008 dump of English Wikipedia,
which includes 818,741 nodes. Table 2 provides a
breakdown of the queries per categories of entities,
and per type of documents.

A complete description of these linguistic re-
sources can be found in (Ellis et al., 2011). For
the sake of reproducibility, we applied the KBP
scoring metric (B3 + F ) described in (TAC-KBP,
2012), and we used the KBP scorer1.

The evaluated system makes use of the
Wikimeta annotation engine. The maximum num-
ber of candidate URIs is l = 15. The MDP correc-
tion parameters α and β described in Section 3.4
have been experimentally set to α = 10, β = 2.
Table 1 presents the results obtained by the sys-
tem in three configurations. In the first column,
the system is evaluated without the disambigua-
tion module. In the second column, we applied
the MDP without correction processes. The sys-
tem with the complete disambiguation module ob-
tained the results provided in the third column.
The three best results and the median from TAC-
KBP 2012 systems are shown in the remaining
columns for the sake of comparison.

EntityLinking/tools.html

We observe that the complete algorithm (co-
references, named entity labels and MDP) pro-
vides the best results on PER NE links. On GPE
and ORG entities, the simple application of MDP
without prior corrections obtains the best results.
A slight loss of accuracy is observed on ORG NEs
when the MDP is applied with corrections. For
those three categories of entities, we show that the
complete system improves the performance of a
simple algorithm using distance measures. Results
on categories News and Web show that the best
performance on the whole KBP corpus (without
distinction of NE categories) is obtained with the
complete algorithm.

5 Conclusion

The presented system provides a robust seman-
tic disambiguation method, based on mutual re-
lation of entities inside a document, using a stan-
dard annotation engine. It uses co-reference, NE
normalization methods, and Wikipedia internal
links as mutual disambiguation resource to im-
prove the annotations. We show that our propo-
sition improves the performance of a standard an-
notation engine applied to the TAC-KBP evalua-
tion framework. SemLinker is fully implemented,
and publicly released as an open source toolkit
(http://code.google.com/p/semlinker). It
has been deployed in the TAC-KBP 2013 evalu-
ation campaign. Our future work will integrate
other annotation engines in the system architecture
in a collaborative approach.
