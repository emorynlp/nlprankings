Abstract

This work surveys existing evaluation
methodologies for the task of sentence
compression, identifies their shortcomings,
and proposes alternatives. In particular,
we examine the problems of evaluating
paraphrastic compression and comparing the
output of different models. We demonstrate
that compression rate is a strong predictor
of compression quality and that perceived
improvement over other models is often a side
effect of producing longer output.

1 Introduction

Sentence compression is the natural language gen-
eration (NLG) task of automatically shortening sen-
tences. Because good compressions should be gram-
matical and retain important meaning, they must be
evaluated along these two dimensions. Evaluation is
a difficult problem for NLG, and many of the prob-
lems identified in this work are relevant for other
generation tasks. Shared tasks are popular in many
areas as a way to compare system performance in an
unbiased manner. Unlike other tasks, such as ma-
chine translation, there is no shared-task evaluation
for compression, even though some compression
systems are indirectly evaluated as a part of DUC.
The benefits of shared-task evaluation have been dis-
cussed before (e.g., Belz and Kilgarriff (2006) and
Reiter and Belz (2006)), and they include compar-
ing systems fairly under the same conditions.

One difficulty in evaluating compression systems
fairly is that an unbiased automatic metric is hard

to define. Automatic evaluation relies on a com-
parison to a single gold standard at a predetermined
length, which greatly limits the types of compres-
sions that can be fairly judged. As we will discuss
in Section 2.1.1, automatic evaluation assumes that
deletions are independent, considers only a single
gold standard, and cannot handle compressions with
paraphrasing. Like for most areas in NLG, human
evaluation is preferable. However, as we discuss in
Section 2.2, there are some subtleties to appropri-
ate experiment design, which can give misleading
results if not handled properly.

This work identifies the shortcomings of widely
practiced evaluation methodologies and proposes al-
ternatives. We report on the effect of compression
rate on perceived quality and suggest ways to control
for this dependency when evaluating across different
systems. In this work we:
• highlight the importance of comparing systems

with similar compression rates,
• argue that comparisons in many previous pub-

lications are invalid,
• provide suggestions for unbiased evaluation.

While many may find this discussion intuitive, these
points are not addressed in much of the existing re-
search, and therefore it is crucial to enumerate them
in order to improve the scientific validity of the task.

2 Current Practices

Because it was developed in support of extractive
summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000), com-
pression has mostly been framed as a deletion task
(e.g., McDonald (2006), Galanis and Androutsopou-
los (2010), Clarke and Lapata (2008), and Galley

and McKeown (2007)). In this context, a compres-
sion is an extracted subset of words from a long
sentence. There are limited compression corpora
because, even when an aligned corpus exists, the
number of extractive sentence pairs will be few and
therefore gold-standard compressions must be man-
ually annotated. The most popular corpora are the
Ziff-Davis corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2000), which
contains a small set of 1067 extracted sentences
from article/abstract pairs, and the manually anno-
tated Clarke and Lapata (2008) corpus, consisting of
nearly 3000 sentences from news articles and broad-
cast news transcripts. These corpora contain one
gold standard for each sentence.

2.1 Automatic Techniques

One of the most widely used automatic metrics is the
F1 measure over grammatical relations of the gold-
standard compressions (Riezler et al., 2003). This
metric correlates significantly with human judg-
ments and is better than Simple String Accuracy
(Bangalore et al., 2000) for judging compression
quality (Clarke and Lapata, 2006). F1 has also been
used over unigrams (Martins and Smith, 2009) and
bigrams (Unno et al., 2006). Unno et al. (2006)
compared the F1 measures to BLEU scores (using
the gold standard as a single reference) over vary-
ing compression rates, and found that BLEU be-
haves similarly to both F1 measures. A syntactic
approach considers the alignment over parse trees
(Jing, 2000), and a similar technique has been used
with dependency trees to evaluate the quality of sen-
tence fusions (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005).

The only metric that has been shown to correlate
with human judgments is F1 (Clarke and Lapata,
2006), but even this is not entirely reliable. F1 over
grammatical relations also depends on parser accu-
racy and the type of dependency relations used.1

1For example, the RASP parser uses 16 grammatical depen-

2.1.1 Pitfalls of Automatic Evaluation
Automatic evaluation operates under three often

incorrect assumptions:

Deletions are independent. The dependency
structure of a sentence may be unaltered when de-
pendent words are not deleted as a unit. Examples
of words that should be treated as a single unit in-
clude negations and negative polarity items or cer-
tain multi-word phrases (such as deleting Latin and
leaving America). F1 treats all deletions equally,
when in fact errors of this type may dramatically al-
ter the meaning or the grammaticality of a sentence
and should be penalized more than less serious er-
rors, such as deleting an article.

The gold standard is the single best compres-
sion. Automatic evaluation considers a single
gold-standard compression. This ignores the pos-
sibility of different length compressions and equally
good compressions of the same length, where mul-
tiple non-overlapping deletions are acceptable. For
an example, see Table 1.

Having multiple gold standards would provide
references at different compression lengths and re-
flect different deletion choices (see Section 3). Since
no large corpus with multiple gold standards exists
to our knowledge, systems could instead report the
quality of compressions at several different com-
pression rates, as Nomoto (2008) did. Alternatively,
systems could evaluate compressions that are of a
similar length as the gold standard compression, to
fix a length for the purpose of evaluation. Output
length is controlled for evaluation in some other ar-
eas, notably DUC.

Systems compress by deletion and not substitu-
tion. More recent approaches to compression in-
troduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g.,

dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford De-
pendencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).

92



Cohn and Lapata (2008), Woodsend et al. (2010),
and Napoles et al. (2011)). For paraphrastic com-
pressions, manual evaluation alone reliably deter-
mines the compression quality. Because automatic
evaluation metrics compare shortened sentences to
extractive gold standards, they cannot be applied to
paraphrastic compression.

To apply automatic techniques to substitution-
based compression, one would need a gold-standard
set of paraphrastic compressions. These are rare.
Cohn and Lapata (2008) created an abstractive cor-
pus, which contains word reordering and paraphras-
ing in addition to deletion. Unfortunately, this cor-
pus is small (575 sentences) and only includes one
possible compression for each sentence.

Other alternatives include deriving such corpora
from existing corpora of multi-reference transla-
tions. The longest reference translation can be
paired with the shortest reference to represent a
long sentence and corresponding paraphrased gold-
standard compression.

Similar to machine translation or summarization,
automatic translation of paraphrastic compressions
would require multiple references to capture allow-
able variation, since there are often many equally
valid ways of compressing an input. ROUGE
or BLEU could be applied to a set of multiple-
reference compressions, although BLEU is not with-
out its own shortcomings (Callison-Burch et al.,
2006). One benefit of both ROUGE and BLEU is
that they are based on n-gram recall and precision
(respectively) instead of word-error rate, so reorder-
ing and word substitutions can be evaluated. Dorr et
al. (2003) used BLEU for evaluation in the context
of headline generation, which uses rewording and
is related to sentence compression. Alternatively,
manual evalation can be adapted from other NLG
domains, such as the techniques described in the fol-
lowing section.

2.2 Manual Evaluation
In order to determine semantic and syntactic suit-
ability, manual evaluation is preferable over au-
tomatic techniques whenever possible. The most
widely practiced manual evaluation methodology
was first used by Knight and Marcu (2002). Judges
grade each compressed sentence against the original
and make two separate decisions: how grammatical

is the compression and how much of the meaning
from the original sentence is preserved. Decisions
are rated along a 5-point scale (LDC, 2005).

Most compression systems consider sentences out
of context (a few exceptions exist, e.g., Daumé III
and Marcu (2002), Martins and Smith (2009), and
Lin (2003)). Contextual cues and discourse struc-
ture may not be a factor to consider if the sentences
are generated for use out of context. An example
of a context-aware approach considered the sum-
maries formed by shortened sentences and evalu-
ated the compression systems based on how well
people could answer questions about the original
document from the summaries (Clarke and Lapata,
2007). This technique has been used before for
evaluating summarization and text comprehension
(Mani et al., 2002; Morris et al., 1992).

2.2.1 Pitfalls of Manual Evaluation
Grammar judgments decrease when the compres-

sion is presented alongside the original sentence.
Figure 1 shows that the mean grammar rating for the
same compressions is on average about 0.3 points
higher when the compression is judged in isolation.
Researchers should be careful to state when gram-
mar is judged on compressions lacking reference
sentences.

Another factor is the group of judges. Obvi-
ously different studies will rely on different judges,
so whenever possible the sentences from an exist-
ing model should be re-evaluated alongside the new
model. The “McD” entries in Table 2 represent a set
of sentences generated from the exact same model
evaluated by two different sets of judges. The mean
grammar and meaning ratings in each evaluation
setup differ by 0.5–0.7 points.

3 Compression Rate Predicts Performance

The dominant assumption in compression research
is that the system makes the determination about the
optimal compression length. For this reason, com-
pression rates can vary drastically across systems. In
order to get unbiased evaluations, systems should be
compared only when they are compressing at similar
rates.

Compression rate is defined as:

# of tokens in compressed sentence
# of tokens in original sentence

× 100 (1)

Figure 1: Compression rate strongly correlates with human judgments of meaning and grammaticality. Gold represents
gold-standard compression and Deletion the results of a leading deletion model. Gold.1 grammar judgments were
made alongside the original sentence and Gold.2 were made in isolation.

It seems intuitive that sentence quality diminishes
in relation to the compression rate. Each word
deleted increases the probability that errors are intro-
duced. To verify this notion, we generated compres-
sions at decreasing compression rates of 250 sen-
tences randomly chosen from the written corpus of
Clarke and Lapata (2008), generated by our imple-
mentation of a leading extractive compression sys-
tem (Clarke and Lapata, 2008). We collected hu-
man judgments using the 5-point scales of meaning
and grammar described above. Both quality judg-
ments decreased linearly with the compression rate
(see “Deletion” in Figure 1).

As this behavior could have been an artifact of
the particular model employed, we next developed
a unique gold-standard corpus for 50 sentences se-
lected at random from the same corpus described
above. The authors manually compressed each sen-
tence at compression rates ranging from less than
10 to 100. Using the same setup as before, we
collected human judgments of these gold standards
to determine an upper bound of perceived quality
at a wide range of compression rates. Figure 1
demonstrates that meaning and grammar ratings de-
cay more drastically at compression rates below 40
(see “Gold”). Analysis suggests that humans are of-
ten able to practice “creative deletion” to tighten a
sentence up to a certain point, before hitting a com-

pression barrier, shortening beyond which leads to
significant meaning and grammatically loss.

4 Mismatched Comparisons

We have observed that a difference in compression
rates as small as 5 percentage points can influence
the quality ratings by as much as 0.1 points and
conclude: systems must be compared using simi-
lar levels of compression. In particular, if system
A’s output is higher quality, but longer than system
B’s, then it is not necessarily the case that A is better
than B. Conversely, if B has results at least as good
as system A, one can claim that B is better, since B’s
output is shorter.

Here are some examples in the literature of mis-
matched comparisons:

• Nomoto (2009) concluded their system signif-
icantly outperformed that of Cohn and Lapata
(2008). However, the compression rate of their
system ranged from 45 to 74, while the com-
pression rate of Cohn and Lapata (2008) was
35. This claim is unverifiable without further
comparison.

• Clarke and Lapata (2007), when comparing
against McDonald (2006), reported signifi-
cantly better results at a 5-point higher com-
pression rate. At first glance, this does not
seem like a remarkable difference. However,

the study evaluated the quality of summaries
containing automatically shortened sentences.
The average document length in the test set was
20 sentences, and with approximately 24 words
per sentence, a typical 65.4% compressed doc-
ument would have 80 more words than a typical
60.1% McDonald compression. The aggregate
loss from 80 words can be considerable, which
suggests that this comparison is inconclusive.

We re-evaluated the model described in Clarke
and Lapata (2008) (henceforth C&L) against the
McDonald (2006) model with global constraints, but
fixed the compression rates to be equal. We ran-
domly selected 100 sentences from that same cor-
pus and generated compressions with the same com-
pression rate as the sentences generated by the Mc-
Donald model (McD), using our implementation of
C&L. Although not statistically significant, this new
evaluation reversed the polarity of the results re-
ported by Clarke and Lapata (Table 2). This again
stresses the importance of using similar compression
rates to draw accurate conclusions about different
models.

An example of unbiased evaluation is found in
Cohn and Lapata (2009). In this work, their model
achieved results significantly better than a compet-
ing system (McDonald, 2006). Recognizing that
their compression rate was about 15 percentage
points higher than the competing system, they fixed
the target compression rate to one similar to McDon-
ald’s output, and still found significantly better per-
formance using automatic measures. This work is
one of the few that controls their output length in
order to make an objective comparison (another ex-
ample is found in McDonald (2006)), and this type
of analysis should be emulated in the future.

5 Suggestions

Models should be tested on the same corpus, be-
cause different corpora will likely have different fea-
tures that make them easier or harder to compress. In
order to make non-vacuous comparisons of different
models, a system also needs to be constrained to pro-
duce the same length output as another system, or
report results at least as good for shorter compres-
sions. Using the multi-reference gold-standard col-
lection described in Section 3, relative performance
could be estimated through comparison to the gold-
standard curve. The reference set we have annotated
is yet small, but this is an area for future work based
on feedback from the community.2

Other methods for limiting quality disparities in-
troduced by the compression rate include fixing the
target length to that of the gold standard (e.g., Unno
et al. (2006)). Alternately, results for a system at
varying compression levels can be reported,3 allow-
ing for comparisons at similar lengths. This is a
practice to be emulated, if possible, because systems
that cannot control output length can make compar-
isons against the appropriate compression rate.

In conclusion, we have provided justification for
the following practices in evaluating compressions:

• Compare systems at similar compression rates.
• Provide results across multiple compression

rates when possible.
• Report that system A surpasses B iff: A and

B have the same compression rate and A does
better than B, or A produces shorter output than
B and A does at least as well B.

• New corpora for compression should have mul-
tiple gold standards for each sentence.
