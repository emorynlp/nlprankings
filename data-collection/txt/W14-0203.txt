Abstract

We present an analysis of a Pedestrian
Navigation and Information dialogue cor-
pus collected using a Wizard-of-Oz inter-
face. We analysed how wizards preferred
to communicate to users given three differ-
ent options: preset buttons that can gen-
erate an utterance, sequences of buttons
and dropdown lists to construct complex
utterances and free text utterances. We
present our findings and suggestions for
future WoZ design based on our findings.

1 Introduction

Wizard-of-Oz environments (WoZ) have been be-
come an essential tool for collecting and studying
dialogue between humans pretending to be ma-
chines and human users in various domains. It is
an effective way to collect dialogues between real
users and dialogue systems before actually imple-
menting the dialogue system. In this framework,
participants interact with an expert human oper-
ator (known as “Wizard”) who is disguised as a
dialogue system. These Wizards replace one or
more parts of the dialogue system such as speech
recognition, natural language understanding, di-
alogue management, natural language generation
modules and so on. Real users interact differently
with humans and computers. While their expecta-
tions with human interlocutors are high and varied,
they are ready to adapt and “go easy” on comput-
ers during interaction (Pearson et al., 2006). So, in
a WoZ framework, the conversation between real
users and the Wizards (pretending to be dialogue
systems) are of an appropriate type to be used for
dialogue system design and not as complex as in
human-human conversation.

In order to provide a speedy response, most
WoZ systems are designed in such a way that re-
sponses are hard wired to buttons so that they can

be sent to the synthesizer at the touch of a button.
However, in order to handle unexpected situations,
most WoZ interfaces also have a free text interface
that allows the Wizard to type any text to be syn-
thesised by the synthesizer. Are free text interfaces
used only under unexpected situations? In this pa-
per, we analyse how free text interfaces are used
by Wizards in a pedestrian tourist navigation and
information dialogue and discuss how the results
of our analysis be used to inform future WoZ de-
signs. These dialogues were collected as a part of
SpaceBook EU FP7 project.

In Section 2, we present previous work in WoZ
interfaces and the domain of pedestrian navigation
and information. We then present our WoZ setup
and data collection in Section 3 and 4. In Section
5, we present our analysis of the corpus, issues and
suggestions in Sections 6 and 7.

2 Related work

Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) frameworks have been used
since early 90s in order to collect human-computer
dialogue data to help design dialogue systems
(Fraser and Gilbert, 1991). WoZ systems have
been used extensively to collect data to learn di-
alogue management policies (Rieser and Lemon,
2011) and information presentation strategies
(Demberg et al., 2011).

Pedestrian navigation and information systems
is a domain of interest to many mobile phone
applications. Applications such as Siri, Google
Maps Navigation, or Sygic deal with the task of
navigation while TripAdvisor, Triposo, etc . focus
on the tourist information problem. Additionally,
several research prototypes have been built to gen-
erate navigation instructions (Bartie and Mack-
aness, 2006; Shroder et al., 2011) and to have con-
versations with tourists (Janarthanam et al., 2013).
WoZ experiments enable the collection of realis-
tic data to assist in the development and testing of
these systems.

3 WoZ setup

The wizard interface consisted a browser window
showing a Google Map and Street View with the
Tourists position. Google StreetView showed
the Tourist’s point of view (see Figure 1). The
Wizard was able to communicate information to
the Tourist in three different ways in the Wizard
Response Panel (see Figure 2):

Hot buttons: By clicking on one of several
buttons with commonly used phrases (e.g. “OK.
I’ll suggest a route for you”, “You want to cross
the road whenever you can”, “Would you like
further information about that?”). Buttons were
organised thematically in sections such as: con-
firmations, ways of asking the Tourist to repeat
what they had said, ways to indicate to the Tourist
that the Wizard was doing something and they
should wait (“Just a moment, please”, “I’m just
finding that out for you now” and “Apologies for
the delay”) and directions. The range of choices
available via the buttons (there were nine different
confirmations) was intended to allow the Wizard
to mimic the variability of human speech; they
were grouped to facilitate rapid identification and
selection.

Sequences: By generating text from a sequence
of drop-down menus, e.g. (where items in square
brackets are drop-down lists): “You want to take
the [count] [pathway] on your [direction]).

Free text: By typing free text into a text editor.

Pre-entered phrases for Hot Buttons were se-
lected following two previous Wizard of Oz exper-
iments where the Tourist and the Wizard commu-
nicated by voice; common expressions used dur-
ing these sessions were summarised and presented
on an initial evaluation interface which was evalu-
ated with 15 dyads. Results from that experiment
fed into the WoZ interface above.

At the bottom right of the screen, there was a
scrollable record of the Wizard’s output in case
the participant needed to confirm what had been
sent to the Tourist. Finally, there was a selection
of system comments the Wizard could make, for
example to note system problems such as prob-
lems hearing the Tourist. This information was
recorded by the system but not sent to the Tourist.
Additionally, screen capture software was used to
record all the on-screen interaction. As a back-up,
the lab was videoed on DV cassette using a tripod-
mounted camcorder.

Instructions to participants were developed to
encourage participants (i.e. playing the role of
Tourists) to solve problems without directing them
too much. e.g. “You’ve heard a story about a
statue of a dog that you think is nearby and would
like to take a photo of the dog and perhaps learn
a little more about the story.”, “You have arranged
to have lunch with a friend in a nearby pub. You

20

can’t remember the exact name but you are sure it
had the word “Bell” in the title.”

The Tourist was equipped with an Android mo-
bile phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) and headset.
The phone ran a custom-built app that sent live
GPS, satellite and accelerometer data back to the
WoZ system while receiving the Wizards text mes-
sages and converting them to speech. As a back-
up, and to ensure the reliability of the position-
ing data, a GPS logging application (My Tracks)
also recorded the data every two seconds on the
phone. Time-stamping within the files permits off-
line synchronisation with the speech data.

4 Data collection

Participants were enrolled using an events organ-
ising website called EventBrite1. Two participants
attended each experimental session and were as-
signed to one of two roles: the Tourist or the Wiz-
ard. At the end of the experiment each received
£10. Ten dyads (twenty people) completed the
experiment. They were aged between 19 and 26
(mean 22), and had lived in Edinburgh between
0.7 and 10 years (mean 2.9). 8 were male, and 12
female.

After participants had arrived at the lab, they
signed a consent form and provided demographic

1www.eventbrite.com

information (age, sex, and length of time in Ed-
inburgh). The task descriptions were handed out
and roles were assigned. The Wizard was given
supplementary information about some of the lo-
cations and Google Map print-outs, but was in-
structed to make up any answers to questions
asked by the Tourist if necessary.

After an initial equipment test and training,
the Tourist dialled a standard Edinburgh landline
number on the mobile phone which connected to a
Skype account and the experiment began. If the
call dropped, the Tourist would redial and con-
tinue. There was a basic set of tasks assigned to
the Tourist, but they were encouraged to expand
and adapt this and were free to ask any tourist or
navigation-based questions that they thought of on
the way.

The Tourist traversed Edinburgh on their own;
the Wizard and experimenter remained in a labo-
ratory. The Wizard used GPS information and dia-
logue with the Tourist to establish location. For the
Wizard, the Tourist’s view had to be reconstructed
using the display software available. These di-
alogue sessions ranged between 41:56 to 66:43
minutes. The average dialogue duration (accord-
ing to the transcriber) for the 10 dyads was 51min
46s.

Please note that for each run, a new pair of Wiz-

21



ard and Tourist were used. Wizards were not re-
tained to do more than one run because we wanted
to collect data from a variety of human wizards in
order to study variations in how each wizard dealt
with the navigation task.

5 Corpus analysis

We analysed the corpus collected based on the
three types of response generation mechanisms:
hot buttons, sequences and free text, to under-
stand their relative utility. We wanted to explore
whether pre-configured text was used when avail-
able, or whether the user’s interaction with the
pre-configured and free text sections of the inter-
face were influenced by other considerations than
availability.

Analysis showed that buttons corresponding
to preset utterances were used only 33% (+/- 14)
of the time. Although wizards had the option of
constructing complex utterances using a sequence
of drop down lists, they only used such sequences
9% (+/- 9) of the time. 58% (+/-19) of Wizard
utterances were generated using the free text inter-
face. This may imply that the buttons did not offer
what the Wizards wanted to say; in which case, we
would anticipate that their self-created utterances
would be very different from those pre-configured.

Individual differences: Use of the button inter-
face varied between Wizards, with some using it
very rarely and others depending on it when it pro-
vided a feature they required. The highest was
82.7% while the lowest use of free text was 31.7%.
Table 1 shows that 6 out of 10 Wizards used the
free text interface more than 60% of the time. It
is likely that these differences were due to individ-
ual variations such as speed of typing and comfort
with using an array of buttons.

Usage of free text interface Wizard count
Below 30% 0
30-40% 3
40-50% 1
50-60% 0
60-70% 3
70-80% 1
80-90% 2

Table 1: Usage of free text interface

As an example of these individual differences,
one Wizard used the button-press interface only
once during the first navigation task (to ask “What
can you see at the moment?”), choosing to direct

the Tourist almost exclusively through use of the
free text interface. By contrast, of the twelve Wiz-
ard utterances in another session’s initial naviga-
tion task, only two were free text. It is interesting
to note, however, that the Tourist commented “I’ve
a feeling (the Wizard) is laughing at me right now.”

5.1 Hot button interface

We analysed how frequently each hot button in the
interface was used by Wizards. We also counted
how frequently the same text as the buttons was
generated using the free text interface. This will
show us if Wizards tend to type the same text that
can effectively be generated at the push of a hot
button. The following table shows the frequency
of each hot button used over the 10 dialogues that
we analysed.

There were forty buttons in total. Two initial
buttons intended to be used at the start of the ex-
periment or when the call was restarted after a
problem: “Okay, we are ready to go. Please pre-
tend to have just dialed Space Book and say hello.”
and “Hello, SpaceBook speaking.” (These were
used 29 times) and two intended for the end of
the call: “Thank you for using SpaceBook” and
“Goodbye” (10 times). Table 2 shows the fre-
quency of usage for other hot buttons.

Utterance type Frequency
Confirmation (e.g. Yes, Okay, Certainly) 168
Navigation (e.g. “Keep going straight ahead”) 114
Filler (e.g. “Just a moment please”) 60
Repeat request (e.g. “Sorry, could you repeat

that please?”) 34
Visual checks (“Can you see it yet?”/

“What can you see at the moment?”) 32
Offer of further information/ help 30
References (e.g. “According to Wikipedia”) 20
Negation (“No”, “No, that’s wrong”) 18
Failure (“I’m afraid I don’t know the

answer to that”) 8

Table 2: Usage of Hot Buttons

The above table presents a Zipfian curve with
some utterances such as “Okay”, “Keep going
straight ahead” having high frequency and some
utterances such as “I’m afraid I don’t know the an-
swer to that,” “I couldn’t understand that, sorry”
with extremely low frequency. Even the highest
frequency utterance, “Okay” was only used about
5 times per session on average. This does not
mean that the Wizard acknowledged the subject at
such low frequency but, as the analysis below in-
dicates, decided to acknowledge the user with free

22



text-generated utterances.

5.2 Free text utterances
We analysed the free text utterances generated by
the Wizards. This analysis, we believe, could
show us how to build better Wizard interfaces for
collecting dialogue data for pedestrian navigation.
First, we counted the number of free text utter-
ances that duplicated Hot Button text. Then, we
analysed the other utterances generated using the
free text interface.

Table 3 presents the frequency of utterances that
were generated using the free text interface but
were the same as hot button text. The table shows
that even though there are hot buttons for utter-
ances such as “Yes”, “Sorry”, Wizards tended to
type them into the free text interface. In some
cases these words were followed by a more com-
plex utterance which the Wizard had chosen to de-
liver as a single statement (e.g. “Yes, that’s the
way to go.”, “no, you should turn around”), and
second, these utterances are short and could easily
be typed rather than searching for the correspond-
ing hot button. Also, Wizards sometimes used
alternative spellings for words such as “Okay”
which could be produced using a hot button. The
word “Ok” was used 15 times in 10 sessions.

Text Frequency
Yes 45
Sorry 21
No 21
Take the next left 4
No problem 3
Certainly 2
Thank you 1

Table 3: Usage of Free Text for utterances same as
Hot Buttons

In addition, Wizards use free text to generate
utterances that are paraphrases of hot button utter-
ances, such as:

• “Keep going”, “Just keep walking”, etc
• “Great”, “Excellent”, etc
• “One moment”, “Wait a second please”, etc
• “Of course”
• “Okay cool”
These analyses imply that free text is not ac-

cessed only in the last resort because the user can-
not find the hot button that says what they’d like

to say. Clearly, the interaction is more complex
and concerns both speed (the contrast of typing a
short utterance such as “Yes” compared with the
time needed to discover the correct button on a dis-
play and navigate to it with a mouse) and the user’s
imposition of their own identity on the conversa-
tion; where the hot button interface offered sev-
eral confirmatory utterances, users often used their
own (e.g. “Great, “Excellent”, “Cool”), utterances
which were, presumably, part of the way these
Wizards more normally interacted with peers.

In this section, we present the other types of
utterances Wizards generated using the free text
interface.

1) Check user’s location:
Wizards asked several free text questions to check
where the user was, given that the positioning
system on smartphones was not entirely accurate.
They framed most questions as yes/no check
questions and enriched them with situational cues
(e.g.“Is the Pear Tree on your right?”, “Have
you reached the Royal Mile yet?”, “Can you see
Nicolson Square?”, “Have you passed the primary
school on your left?”).

2) Informing user’s location:
Wizards sometimes informed users of their loca-
tion. e.g. “This is West Nicolson Street”.

3) Complex navigation instructions:
Using the free text interface, Wizards generated
a variety of complex navigation instructions that
were not covered by the hot buttons. These include
instructions where the subject was asked to carry
out two instructions in sequence (e.g. “Turn left,
and keep walking until you get to Chapel Street”),
orienting the user (e.g. “You want the road on your
right”, “Please go back in the direction you came
from”), signaling to the user that he/she was walk-
ing in the wrong direction (e.g. “You’re going the
wrong way”), a priori instructions to destination
(e.g. “To get there you will need to keep going
up the Royal Mile. Then turn left at the junction
between North and South Bridge. Walk up South
Bridge, and it will change to Nicolson Street. Sur-
geon’s Hall will be on the left hand side.”).

Some navigation instructions were complex be-
cause they were not general instructions but direct
responses to the Tourist’s question. One exam-
ple of this was by Dynamic Earth (dyad 07) when

23



the Wizard told the Tourist to follow a footpath.
Tourist: “One of the footpaths banks to the right,
and the other goes straight forward. Which one?”,
the Wizard answered: “You want the one that is
straight forward.”

The navigation directions on hot buttons were
necessarily very general (e.g. Keep going straight
ahead/ Take the next left) and Wizards frequently
used the free text to enrich the directions and make
them more specific, e.g. (dyad 09) “Walk down
Crichton Street towards the Mosque.” In the ini-
tial navigation task, this Wizard used the free text
interface 7 times, and the navigation hot buttons
only 4 times. Each segment of free text enriched
the interaction by providing specific navigational
information, so where the Wizard could have se-
lected the hot button for “Keep going straight”,
instead she chose to add value to the interaction
through the use of place names and typed, “Con-
tinue straight onto West Richmond Street”.

A similar pattern can be seen in the interaction
in dyad 10 where the Wizard used the free text op-
tion to navigate the Tourist according to objects
in his environment. e.g. “Turn right at the traffic
lights” and “Walk straight down past the Bingo on
your left.”. Of the 22 Wizard utterances in the first
navigation task in the dyad, only 5 were hot but-
tons. 14 were navigation instructions, of which 3
were button-presses and one (“Walk straight on”)
paraphrased an existing button. The Tourist got
lost in this task, so there was also some checking
on his location.

These are not isolated examples. In total, over
the ten dyads, 308 utterances from the total 927
free text utterances were Wizards “enriching” their
navigation directions by adding contextual cues,
most commonly the name of the street or a land-
mark to help situate the Tourist. For example,
“You can reach it by turning right down Holyrood
Road at the junction.”, “Please head towards the
Mosque”.

Although 33% of overall free text utterances
were enriched navigation instructions, this over-
all pattern varied depending on the dyad, ranging
from dyad 03 where 62.5% were enriched instruc-
tions, to dyad 08, where only 8% were enriched.

These value-added uses of the free text suggest
that the addition of contextual cues is regarded as
important by the individuals acting as Wizards.
An improved WoZ interface might seek to support
such utterances.

4) Reassuring user:
Wizards presented information such as landmarks
users can see as they walk along to reassure
them that they are on the right track (e.g. “You
will pass Richmond Place on your left”, “You
will walk past the Canongate Kirk on your right
beforehand”).

5) Informing time/distance to destination:
Wizards presented how long it will take to reach
the destination to set the right expectation in the
user’s mind (e.g. “It will be about a two minute
walk”, “the gym is 200 metres along this road on
your right”).

6) Providing destination information:
Wizards provided information about the location
of destination in reference to the user (e.g. “And
Bonsai Bar Bistro will be on the left, just before
you reach The Pleasance”, “The Museum of
Edinburgh will be on the left”) or other landmarks
(e.g. “The Scottish Parliament is next to Our
Dynamic Earth”, “The entrance is on the other
side”). Note that this interaction, too, is normally
enriched by situational cues.

7) Informing destinations that match search
criteria:
Some tasks presented to subjects did not specify
the actual name of the destination. Hence when
they asked the Wizard for a matching destination,
Wizards used free text to suggest destinations
that match the search criteria (e.g. “There is
a restaurant called Bonsai Bistro”, “There are
three museums to visit. They are Museum of
Edinburgh, People’s Story Museum, and Museum
of Childhood”).

8) Check if destination reached and identified:
Wizards checked whether users had reached their
destination by asking them to confirm if they had
(e.g. “Have you reached it?”, “Have you found
the sports centre?”). The hot button ”Can you see
it yet?” covered this functionality, but once more,
free text allowed the user to increase situational
specificity by identifying the target.

9) Additional information about landmarks:
Wizards presented additional information about
landmarks such as its name (“the hill besides par-

24



liament is in fact 2 hills, the rocky cliffs you can
see are called crags”, “behind that is arthurs seat”),
the year it was built/opened (e.g. “it was opened
in 1999”), what it functions as (e.g. “offices for a
newspaper publisher”).

In some cases such free text utterances were
produced in response to questions asked by
Tourists. For example, when the Tourist of dyad
05 passed the Fringe office, they asked, “Do you
know what dates the Fringe is on this year?”.
The Wizard used free text to answer the question.
Later in the same experiment, the Tourist identi-
fied Vodka Rev as a landmark (“Down past Vodka
Rev?”) and the Wizard responded with free text
about the landmark: “Vodka Rev does half price
food on Mondays.”.

10) Signalling connection problems:
Wizards informed users when they lost the user’s
GPS signal (e.g. “hold on 1 second, gps connec-
tion gone”) and to establish contact and check
user’s attention (e.g. “hello?”, “I can’t hear you at
the moment”).

Further, some Wizards used the free text to hu-
manise the person-to-person element of the inter-
action. They would chat to Tourists, make jokes
(“I cannot answer rhetorical questions, as I am
both a computer and aware they are not meant to
be answered.”) and in one case, invite the Tourist
out for a drink.

6 Issues with free text

As one can imagine, there are issues with free text
utterances generated by Wizards.

Spelling:
Several words used in free text utterances were
misspelled. e.g. “roundabaout”, “entrace”, “ple-
sae”, “toewards”, “You want ot cross the roD”)
etc. These ranged from 0 to 13 errors per session
with a mean of 3.6 (+/- 3.9) errors per session.
Adjacent words were sometimes joined together
(e.g. “atyour”, “upahead”, etc) and sometimes
incorrectly segmented with space (e.g. “collection
sof”, “hea ryou”, etc). Some entity names were
misspelled as well (e.g. “Critchon”, “Dyanmic
Earth”, “artthurs seat”, etc). Spelling errors can
reflect poorly when the utterances are synthesized
and the misspelled words mispronounced.

Syntax:
We also found a few syntactic errors in utterance
construction (e.g. “Continue going Chambers
street”). Similar to spelling errors, utterances with
improper syntax can sound weird to the Tourist
and could lead to confusion and misunderstanding
instructions.

Incorrect entity names:
Wizards did not always get street names correct,
e.g. in dyad 02, the Wizard directed the Tourist to
“Nicholas Square” and the Tourist needed to seek
clarification that he meant “Nicolson Square”.

Time and effort:
It takes time and can slow the interaction with the
user, leading to issues like interruptions and the
flow of the conversation being upset.

7 Suggestions

Based on the above analysis, we propose a list
of suggestions to build a better Wizard of Oz in-
terface for collecting dialogues concerning pedes-
trian navigation and exploration. The objective of
the WoZ system is to provide an effective inter-
face to Wizards to interact with Tourists while pre-
tending to be dialogue systems. One of the impor-
tant requirements is that Wizards should be able
to generate context appropriate utterances quickly
to make the dialogue appear more natural with-
out unnecessary lag between a user’s requests and
the system’s responses. Hot buttons are designed
so that the utterance can generated at the push of
a button. However as our data shows, Wizards
tended to use the free text interface about 60% of
the time.

While there are situations in which free text is
necessary, in general it risks slowing the interac-
tion and potentially confusing the Tourist when
words are mis-spelled or omitted. In addition,
supporting the Wizard more effectively with an
improved WoZ interface is likely to permit them
to spend more time supporting and informing
the Tourist. Free text utterances can lead to slow
system response and there is therefore a need to
find a compromise between the two. We have the
following suggestions:

1. More hot buttons:
Some utterances generated using the free text in-
terface could not be generated using the hot but-

25



tons or the sequences. These include reassuring
users, informing them of the time/distance to des-
tination, informing them of search results, etc.
While free text is a useful interface to Wizards to
generate unforeseen utterances, more hot buttons
covering new functionality can be faster to use.

However, introducing additional hot buttons
would add complexity to the interface, which is
likely to have the undesireable effect of encourag-
ing users to avoid the cluttered display in favour if
the straightforward free text interface. One partial
solution is to ensure that buttons are organised and
grouped in ways that are intuitive for the Wizard.
This, and the optimum number of buttons for the
display, should be investigated experimentally.

2. Multi functional hot buttons:
Some free text utterances were complex versions
of simple utterances that were already covered by
hot buttons. For instance, utterances like “Keep
going up Nicolson Street” or “Keep walking until
you get to Chapel Street” can be seen as a version
of “Keep going straight ahead” but with some ap-
pended information (i.e. street name, landmark).

The interface could be designed so that hot
button utterances could be modified or appended
with more information. For example, a single
click the hot button might send the utterance to
the free text editor, allowing the Wizard to add
more information, whereas a double click would
send the utterance directly to the TTS.

3. Spell check, grammar check and auto cor-
rection:
To ensure that the speech synthesizer works as ef-
fectively as possible, the utterances typed in the
free text editor must be correctly spelled. One so-
lution to the frequent mis-spelling made by Wiz-
ards typing at speed is to automatically spell check
and correct text typed in the free text interface.

Ensuring that text is correct would reduce the
risk of the speech synthesizer mispronouncing
misspelt names and words. Similarly, a grammar
check would mean that the synthesised utterances
felt more natural.

Since there is the danger of an automatic spell
checker making mistakes, the spell check and cor-
rection should happen when the Wizard finishes
typing a word or utterance and the auto corrected
word or utterance be shown to the Wizard before
it is sent to the TTS.

4. Autocomplete:
Autocomplete is a feature that predicts the next
words the user intends to type based on those
already typed. It is currently used by search
engines such as Google to complete users’ search
queries based on their search history and profile.
A similar feature that can complete utterances
taking into account the user’s request, dialogue
history, and the spatial context could speed up the
response time of the Wizard.

5. Location aware WoZ interface:
The WoZ system could be “aware” of the user’s
surroundings. Such a solution might enable the
interface to have dynamically changing buttons,
so when the user is headed up Nicolson Street,
the “Keeping going” button could have Nicolson
Street on it. Information about entities around
the user can also be assigned to hot buttons dy-
namically. However, hot buttons with dynamically
changing labels and functionality could be cogni-
tively overloading to Wizards.

Of course, the addition of such functionality
to the WoZ interface must be carefully evaluated.
A dynamic interface may be harder to learn, and
increasing the number of buttons may, counter-
intuitively, mean that users are less likely to select
hot buttons because the effort to scan the array of
buttons is greater than the effort needed to type ut-
terances, particularly short ones, into a free text
box.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a Wizard of Oz system
that was used to collect dialogues in the domain of
pedestrian navigation and information. We anal-
ysed the corpus collected to identify how Wizards
preferred to interact with the pedestrian users and
why. We identified issues with free text interfaces
that was used by majority of Wizards and sug-
gested improvements towards future Wizard inter-
face design.
