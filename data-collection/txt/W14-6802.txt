Abstract: With the urgent needs of enhancing the intelligence of the internet, Knowledge 
engineering is attracting high attention from both industry and academia. Different from the 
knowledge engineering (such as Dbpedia, Knowledge Graph, YAGO, etc.) based on 
structured knowledge resources, the task of textual knowledge engineering is to mine 
knowledge from unstructured natural language texts. One of the critical problems is, there is 
gap between the shallow structures expressed by natural languages and the deep structures in 
conceptual knowledge. In this talk we will introduce the building of the multi-level annotated 
Chinese language resource, the ontology engineering based on encyclopedias and the Web, 
and the construction of the mapping resource between conceptual relations and their natural 
language expressions to link linguistic knowledge and the world knowledge together. The 
ultimate goal is to lay resource foundation for Chinese language computing in the Web scale.
