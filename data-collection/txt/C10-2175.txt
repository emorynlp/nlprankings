Abstract 

String-based metrics of automatic ma-
chine translation (MT) evaluation are 
widely applied in MT research. Mean-
while, some linguistic motivated me-
trics have been suggested to improve 
the string-based metrics in sentence-
level evaluation. In this work, we at-
tempt to change their original calcula-
tion units (granularities) of string-based 
metrics to generate new features. We 
then propose a powerful string-based 
automatic MT evaluation metric, com-
bining all the features with various 
granularities based on SVM rank and 
regression models. The experimental 
results show that i) the new features 
with various granularities can contri-
bute to the automatic evaluation of 
translation quality; ii) our proposed 
string-based metrics with multiple gra-
nularities based on SVM regression 
model can achieve higher correlations 
with human assessments than the state-
of-art  automatic metrics. 

1 Introduction 
The automatic machine translation (MT) eval-
uation has aroused much attention from MT 
researchers in the recent years, since the auto-
matic MT evaluation metrics can be applied to 
optimize MT systems in place of the expensive 
and time-consuming human assessments. The 
state-of-art strategy to automatic MT evalua-
tion metrics estimates the system output quali-

ty according to its similarity to human refer-
ences. To capture the language variability ex-
hibited by different reference translations, a 
tendency is to include deeper linguistic infor-
mation into machine learning based automatic 
MT evaluation metrics, such as syntactic and 
semantic information (Amigò et al., 2005; Al-
brecht and Hwa, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 
2008). Generally, such efforts may achieve 
higher correlation with human assessments by 
including more linguistic features. Neverthe-
less, the complex and variously presented lin-
guistic features often prevents the wide appli-
cation of the linguistic motivated metrics. 

Essentially, linguistic motivated metrics in-
troduce additional restrictions for accepting the 
outputs of translations (Amigó et al., 2009).  
With more linguistic features attributed, the 
model is actually capturing the sentence simi-
larity in a finer granularity. In this sense, the 
practical effect of employing various linguistic 
knowledge is changing the calculation units of 
the matching in the process of the automatic 
evaluation. 

Similarly, the classical string-based metrics 
can be changed in their calculation units direct-
ly. For example, the calculation granularity in 
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) metric is word: 
n-grams are extracted on the basis of single 
word as well as adjacent multiple words. And 
the calculation granularity in PosBLEU 
(Popović and Ney, 2009) metric is Pos tag, 
which correlate well with the human assess-
ments. Therefore, it is straight forward to apply 
the popular string-based automatic evaluation 
metrics, such as BLEU, to compute the scores 
of the systems outputs in the surface or linguis-

1533



tic tag sequences on various granularities le-
vels. 

In this paper, we attempt to change the orig-
inal calculation units (granularities) of string-
based metrics to generate new features. After 
that, we propose a powerful string-based au-
tomatic MT evaluation metric, combining all 
the features with various granularities based on 
SVM rank (Joachims, 2002) and regression 
(Drucker et al., 1996) models. Our analysis 
indicates that: i) the new features with various 
granularities can contribute to the automatic 
evaluation of translation quality; ii) our pro-
posed string-based metrics with multiple gra-
nularities based on SVM regression model can 
achieve higher correlations with human as-
sessments than the state-of-art automatic me-
trics . 

The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows: Section 2 reviews the related re-
searches on automatic MT evaluation. Section 
3 describes some new calculation granularities 
of string-based metrics on sentence level. In 
Section 4, we propose string-based metrics 
with multiple granularities based on SVM rank 
and regression models. In Section 5, we 
present our experimental results on different 
sets of data. And conclusions are drawn in the 
Section 6. 

2 Related Work on Automatic Ma-
chine Translation Evaluation 

The research on automatic string-based ma-
chine translation (MT) evaluation is targeted at 
a widely applicable metric of high consistency 
to the human assessments. WER (Nießen et al., 
2000), PER (Tillmann et al., 1997), and TER 
(Snover et al., 2006) focuses on word error rate 
of translation output. GTM (Melamed et al., 
2003) and the variants of ROUGE (Lin and 
Och, 2004) concentrate on matched longest 
common substring and discontinuous substring 
of translation output according to the human 
references. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and 
NIST (Doddington, 2002) are both based on 
the number of common n-grams between the 
translation hypothesis and human reference 
translations of the same sentence. BLEU and 
NIST are widely adopted in the open MT eval-
uation campaigns; however, the NIST MT 
evaluation in 2005 indicates that they can even 

error in the system level (Le and Przybocki, 
2005). Callison-Burch et al. (2006) detailed the 
deficits of the BLEU and other similar metrics, 
arguing that the simple surface similarity cal-
culation between the machines translations and 
the human translations suffers from morpho-
logical issues and fails to capture what are im-
portant for human assessments.  

In order to attack these problems, some me-
trics have been proposed to include more lin-
guistic information into the process of match-
ing, e.g., Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) 
metric and MaxSim (Chan nad Ng, 2008) me-
trics, which improve the lexical level by the 
synonym dictionary or stemming technique. 
There are also substantial studies focusing on 
including deeper linguistic information in the 
metrics (Liu and Gildea, 2005; Owczarzak et 
al., 2006; Amigó et al., 2006; Mehay and Brew, 
2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2007; Owczar-
zak et al., 2007; Popovic and Ney, 2007; 
Giménez and Màrquez, 2008b). 

A notable trend improving the string-based 
metric is to combine various deeper linguistic 
information via machine learning techniques in 
the metrics (Amigò et al., 2005; Albrecht and 
Hwa, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2008). 
Such efforts are practically amount of intro-
ducing additional linguistic restrictions into the 
automatic evaluation metrics (Amigó et al, 
2009), achiving a higher performance at the 
cost of lower adaptability to other languages 
owing to the language dependent linguistics 
features. 

Previous work shows that including the new 
features into the evaluation metrics may bene-
fit to describe nature language accurately. In 
this sense, the string-based metrics will be im-
proved, if the finer calculation granularities are 
introduced into the metrics.  

Our study analyzes the role of the calcula-
tion granularities in the performance of metrics. 
We find that the new features with various 
granularities can contribute to the automatic 
evaluation of translation quality. Also we pro-
pose a powerful string based automatic MT 
evaluation metric with multiple granularities 
combined by SVM. Finally, we seek a finer 
feature set of metrics with multiple calculation 
granularities.

3 The New Calculation Granularities 
of String-based Metrics on Sentence 
Level  

The string-based metrics of automatic machine 
translation evaluation on sentence level adopt a 
common strategy: taking the sentences of the 
documents as plain strings. Therefore, when 
changing the calculation granularities of the 
string-based metrics we can simplify the in-
formation of new granularity with plain strings.  
In this work, five kinds of available calculation 
granularities are defined: “Lexicon”, “Letter”, 
“Pos”, “Constitute” and “Dependency”.  

Lexicon: The calculation granularity is 
common word in the sentences of the docu-
ments, which is popular practice at present. 

Letter: Split the granularities of “Lexical” 
into letters. Each letter is taken as a matching 
unit. 

Pos: The Pos tag of each “Lexicon” is taken 
as a matching unit in this calculation granulari-
ty. 

Constitute: Syntactic Constitutes in a tree 
structure are available through the parser tools. 
We use Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 
2003a; Klein and Manning, 2003b) in this 
work.  The Constitute tree is changed into 
plain string, travelling by BFS (Breadth-first 
search traversal) 1.  

Dependency: Dependency relations in a de-
pendency structure are also available through 
the parser tools. The dependency structure can 
also be formed in a tree, and the same 
processing of being changed into plain string is 
adopted as “Constitute”. 

The following serves as an example:  
Sentence:  

I have a dog 
Pos tag:  

I/PRON have/V a/ART dog/N 
Constitute tree:  

 

                                                 
1 We also attempt some other traversal algorithms, in-
cluding preorder, inorder and postorder traversal, the 
performance are proved to be similar.  

Dependency tree:  

 
Then, we can change the sentence into the 

plain string in multiple calculation granulari-
ties as follows: 

Lexicon string:  
I have a dog 

Letter string:  
I h a v e a d o g 

Pos string: 
PRON V ART N 

Constitute string:  
PRON V ART N NP NP VP S 

Dependency string: 
 a I dog have 

The translation hypothesis and human refer-
ence translations are both changed into those 
strings of various calculation granularities. The 
strings are taken as inputs of the string-based 
automatic MT evaluation metrics. The outputs 
of each metric are calculated on different 
matching units. 

4 String-based Metrics with Multiple 
Granularities Combined by SVM 

Introducing machine learning methods to es-
tablished MT evaluation metric is a popular 
trend. Our study chooses rank and regression 
support vector machine (SVM) as the learning 
model. Features are important for the SVM 
models. 

Plenty of scores can be generated from the 
proposed metrics. In fact, not all these features 
are needed. Therefore, feature selection should 
be a necessary step to find a proper feature set 
and alleviate the language dependency by us-
ing fewer linguistic features. 

Feature selection is an NP-Complete prob-
lem; therefore, we adopt a greedy selection 
algorithm called “Best One In” to find a local 
optimal feature set. Firstly, we select the fea-
ture among all the features which best corre-
lates with the human assessments.  Secondly, a 
feature among the rest features is added in to 
the feature set, if the correlation with the hu-
man assessments of the metric using new set is 

1535



the highest among all new metrics and higher 
than the previous metric in cross training cor-
pus. The cross training corpus is prepared by 
dividing the training corpus into five parts. 
Each four parts of the five are for training and 
the rest one for testing; then, we integrate 
scores of the five tests as scores of cross train-
ing corpus.  The five-fold cross training can 
help to overcome the overfitting. At the end, 
the feature selection stops, if adding any of the 
rest features cannot lead to higher correlation 
with human assessments than the current me-
tric.  

5 Experiments 

5.1 The Impact of the Calculation Granu-
larities on String-based Metrics 

In this section, we use the data from NIST 
Open MT 2006 evaluation (LDC2008E43), 
which is described in Table 1.  It consists of 
249 source sentences that were translated by 
four human translators as well as 8 MT sys-
tems. Each machine translated sentence was 
evaluated by human judges for their adequacy 
on a 7-point scale.

To judge the quality of a metric, we com-

pute Spearman rank-correlation coefficient, 
which is a real number ranging from -1 (indi-
cating perfect negative correlations) to +1 (in-
dicating perfect positive correlations), between 

the metric’s scores and the averaged human 
assessments on test sentences. 

We select 21 features in “lexicon” calcula-
tion granularity and 11×4 in the other calcula-
tion granularities. We analyze the correlation 
with human assessments of the metrics in mul-
tiple calculation granularities.  Table 2 lists the 
optimal calculation granularity of the multiple 
metrics on sentence level in the data 
(LDC2008E43).

The most remarkable aspect is that not all 
the best metrics are based on the “lexicon” cal-
culation granularities, such as the “letter” and 
“dependency”. In other words, the granulari-
ties-shifted string-based metrics are promising 
to contribute to the automatic evaluation of 
translation quality. 

5.2 Correlation with Human Assessments 
of String-based Metrics with Multiple 
Granularities Based on SVM Frame 

We firstly train the SVM rank and regression 
models on LDC2008E43 using all the features 
(21+11 × 4 species), without any selection. 
Secondly, the other two SVM rank and regres-
sion models are trained on the same data using 
the feature set via feature selection, which are 
described in Table 3. We have four string-
based evaluation metrics with multiple granu-
larities on rank and regression SVM frame 
“Rank_All, Regression_All, Rank_Select and 
Regression_Select”.  Then we apply the four 
metrics to evaluate the sentences of the test 
data (LDC2006T04 and LDC2003T17). The 
results of Spearman correlation with human 
assessments is summarized in Table 3. For 
comparison, the results from some state-of-art 
metrics (Papineni et al., 2002; Doddington, 

1536



2002; Melamed et al., 2003; Banerjee and La-
vie, 2005; Snover et al., 2006; Liu and Gildea, 
2005) and two machine learning methods (Al-
brecht and Hwa, 2007; Ding Liu and Gildea, 
2007) are also included in Table 3. Of the two 
machine learning methods, both trained on the 
data LDC2006T04. The “Albrecht, 2007” 
score reported a result of Spearman correlation 
with human assessments on the data 
LDC2003T17 using 53 features, while the 
“Ding Liu, 2007” score reported that under 
five-fold cross validation on the data 
LDC2006T04 using 31 features.

human assessments of our proposed metrics and 

some start-of-art metrics and two machine learning

“-opt” stands for the optimum values of the pa-
rameters on the metrics 

 
Table 3 shows that the string-based meta-

evaluation metrics with multiple granularities 
based on SVM frame gains the much higher 
Spearman correlation than other start-of-art 
metrics on the two test data and, furthermore, 
our proposed metrics also are higher than the 
machine learning metrics (Albrecht and Hwa, 
2007; Ding Liu and Gildea, 2007).  

The underlining is that our proposed metrics 
are more robust than the aforementioned two

machine learning metrics. As shown in Table 1 
the heterogeneity between the training and test 
data in our method is much more significant 
than that of the other two machine learning 
based methods.  

In addition, the “Regression_Select” metric 
using only 8 features can achieve a high corre-
lation rate which is close to the metric pro-
posed in “Albrecht, 2007” using 53 features, 
“Ding Liu, 2007” using 31 features, “Regres-
sion_All” and “Rank_All” metrics using  65 
features and “Rank_Select” metric using 16 
features. What is more, “Regression_Select” 
metric is better than “Albrecht, 2007”, and 
slightly lower than “Regression_All” on the 
data LDC2003T17; and better than both “Re-
gression_All” and “Rank_All” metrics on the 
data LDC2006T04. That confirms that a small 
cardinal of feature set can also result in a me-
tric having a high correlation with human as-
sessments, since some of the features represent 
the redundant information in different forms. 
Eliminating the redundant information is bene-
fit to reduce complexity of the parameter 
searching and thus improve the metrics per-
formance based on SVM models. Meanwhile, 
fewer features can relieve the language depen-
dency of the machine learning metrics. At last, 
our experimental results show that regression 
models perform better than rank models in the 
string-based metrics with multiple granularities 
based on SVM frame, since “Regres-
sion_Select” and “Regression_All” achieve 
higher correlations with human assessments 
than the others. 

5.3 Reliability of Feature Selection  
The motivation of feature selection is keeping 
the validity of the feature set and alleviating 
the language dependency. We also look for-
ward to the higher Spearman correlation on the 
test data with a small and proper feature set.  

We use SVM-Light (Joachims, 1999) to 
train our learning models using NIST Open 
MT 2006 evaluation data (LDC2008E43), and 
test on the two sets of data, NIST’s 2002 and 
2003 Chinese MT evaluations. All the data are 
described in Table 1. To avoid the bias in the 
distributions of the two judges’ assessments in 
NIST’s 2002 and 2003 Chinese MT evalua-
tions, we normalize the scores following (Blatz 
et al., 2003). 

1537



We trace the process of the feature selection. 
The selected feature set of the metric based on 
SVM rank includes 16 features and that of the 
metric based on SVM regression includes 8 
features. The selected features are listed in Ta-
ble 4. The values in Table 4 are absolute 
Spearman correlations with human assess-
ments of each single feature score.  The prefix-
es “C_”, “D_”, “L_”, “P_”, and “W_” 
represent “Constitute”, “Dependency”, “Let-
ter”, “Pos” and “Lexicon” respectively.

Table 4: Feature sets of SVM rank and regression 

 
Table 4 shows that 8 features are selected 

from 65 features in the process of feature se-
lection based on SVM regression while 16 fea-
tures based on SVM rank. Fewer features 
based on SVM regression are selected than 
SVM rank. Only one feature in feature set 
based on SVM regression does not occur in 
that based on SVM rank. The reason is that 
there are more complementary advantages be-
tween the common selected features.  

Next, we will verify the reliability of our 
feature selection algorithm. Figure 1 and Fig-
ure 2 show the Spearman correlation values 
between our SVM-based metrics (regression 
and rank) and the human assessments on both 
training data (LDC2008E43) and test data 
(LDC2006T04 and LDC2003T17).

our SVM regression metrics and the human as-
sessments on both training data and test data with

From Figure 1 and Figure 2, with the exten-
sion of the feature sets, we can find that the 
tendency of correlation obtained by each me-
tric based on SVM rank or regression roughly 
the same on both the training data and test data. 
Therefore, the two feature sets of SVM rank 
and regression models are reliable. 

6 Conclusion 
In this paper we propose an integrated platform 
for automatic MT evaluation by improving the 
string based metrics with multiple granularities. 
Our proposed metrics construct a novel inte-
grated platform for automatic MT evaluation 
based on multiple features. Our  key contribu-
tion consists of two parts: i) we suggest a strat-
egy  of changing the various complex features 
into plain string form. According to the strate-
gy, the automatic MT evaluation frame are 

1538



much more clarified, and the computation of 
the similarity is much more simple, since the 
various linguistic features may express in the 
uniform strings with multiple calculation gra-
nularities. The new features have the same 
form and are dimensionally homogeneous; 
therefore, the consistency of the features is 
enhanced strongly. ii) We integrate the features 
with machine learning and proposed an effec-
tive approach of feature selection. As a result, 
we can use fewer features but obtain the better 
performance. 

In this framework, on the one hand, string-
based metrics with multiple granularities may 
introduce more potential features into automat-
ic evaluation, with no necessarily of new simi-
larity measuring method, compared with the 
other metrics. On the other hand, we succeed 
in finding a finer and small feature set among 
the combinations of plentiful features, keeping 
or improving the performance. Finally, we 
proposed a simple, effective and robust string-
based automatic MT evaluation metric with 
multiple granularities. 

Our proposed metrics improve the flexibility 
and performance of the metrics based on the 
multiple features; however, it still has some 
drawbacks: i) some potential features are not 
yet considered, e.g. the semantic roles; and ii) 
the loss of information exists in the process of 
changing linguistic information into plain 
strings. For example, the dependency label in 
the calculation granularity “Dependency” is 
lost when changing information into string 
form. Though the final results obtain the better 
performance than the other linguistic metrics, 
the performance is promising to be further im-
proved if the loss of information can be prop-
erly dealt with.
