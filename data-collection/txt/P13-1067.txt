Abstract

Metaphor is an important way of convey-
ing the affect of people, hence understand-
ing how people use metaphors to convey
affect is important for the communication
between individuals and increases cohe-
sion if the perceived affect of the con-
crete example is the same for the two in-
dividuals. Therefore, building computa-
tional models that can automatically iden-
tify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like
“The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is
money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an
important challenging problem, which has
been of great interest to the research com-
munity.

To solve this task, we have collected
and manually annotated the affect of
metaphor-rich texts for four languages.
We present novel algorithms that integrate
triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual
and social processes with stylistic and lex-
ical information. By running evaluations
on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian
and Farsi, we show that the developed af-
fect polarity and valence prediction tech-
nology of metaphor-rich texts is portable
and works equally well for different lan-
guages.

1 Introduction

Metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word
or phrase that ordinarily designates one thing is
used to designate another, thus making an implicit
comparison (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Martin,
1988; Wilks, 2007). For instance, in

“My lawyer is a shark”

the speaker may want to communicate that his/her
lawyer is strong and aggressive, and that he will

attack in court and persist until the goals are
achieved. By using the metaphor, the speaker ac-
tually conveys positive affect because having an
aggressive lawyer is good if one is being sued.

There has been a substantial body of work on
metaphor identification and interpretation (Wilks,
2007; Shutova et al., 2010). However, in this
paper we focus on an equally interesting, chal-
lenging and important problem, which concerns
the automatic identification of affect carried by
metaphors. Building such computational mod-
els is important to understand how people use
metaphors to convey affect and how affect is ex-
pressed using metaphors. The existence of such
models can be also used to improve the communi-
cation between individuals and to make sure that
the speakers perceived the affect of the concrete
metaphor example in the same way.

The questions we address in this paper are:
“How can we build computational models that can
identify the polarity and valence associated with
metaphor-rich texts?” and “Is it possible to build
such automatic models for multiple languages?”.
Our main contributions are:

• We have developed multilingual metaphor-
rich datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and
Farsi that contain annotations of the Positive
and Negative polarity and the valence (from
−3 to +3 scale) corresponding to the inten-
sity of the affect conveyed in the metaphor.

• We have proposed and developed automated
methods for solving the polarity and valence
tasks for all four languages. We model
the polarity task as a classification problem,
while the valence task as a regression prob-
lem.

• We have studied the influence of different in-
formation sources like the metaphor itself,
the context in which it resides, the source and

682



target domains of the metaphor, in addition to
contextual features and trigger word lists de-
veloped by psychologists (Tausczik and Pen-
nebaker, 2010).

• We have conducted in depth experimental
evaluation and showed that the developed
methods significantly outperform baseline
methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes related work, Section 3 briefly
talks about metaphors. Sections 4 and 5 describe
the polarity classification and valence prediction
tasks for affect of metaphor-rich texts. Both sec-
tions have information on the collected data for
English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, the con-
ducted experiments and obtained results. Finally,
we conclude in Section 6.

2 Related Work

A substantial body of work has been done on de-
termining the affect (sentiment analysis) of texts
(Kim and Hovy, 2004; Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2007; Wiebe and Cardie, 2005; Yessenalina and
Cardie, 2011; Breck et al., 2007). Various tasks
have been solved among which polarity and va-
lence identification are the most common. While
polarity identification aims at finding the Positive
and Negative affect, valence is more challenging
as it has to map the affect on a [−3,+3] scale
depending on its intensity (Polanyi and Zaenen,
2004; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).

Over the years researchers have developed vari-
ous approaches to identify polarity of words (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2006), phrases (Turney, 2002; Wil-
son et al., 2005), sentences (Choi and Cardie,
2009) even documents (Pang and Lee, 2008).
Multiple techniques have been employed, from
various machine learning classifiers, to clustering
and topic models. Various domains and textual
sources have been analyzed such as Twitter, Blogs,
Web documents, movie and product reviews (Tur-
ney, 2002; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2005; Niu et al.,
2005; Pang and Lee, 2008), but yet what is miss-
ing is affect analyzer for metaphor-rich texts.

While the affect of metaphors is well stud-
ied from its linguistic and psychological aspects
(Blanchette et al., 2001; Tomlinson and Love,
2006; Crawdord, 2009), to our knowledge the
building of computational models for polarity and
valence identification in metaphor-rich texts is still

a novel task (Smith et al., 2007; Veale, 2012; Veale
and Li, 2012; Reyes and Rosso, 2012; Reyes et
al., 2013). Little (almost no) effort has been put
into multilingual computational affect models of
metaphor-rich texts. Our research specifically tar-
gets the resolution of these problems and shows
that it is possible to build such computational mod-
els. The experimental result provide valuable con-
tributions and fundings, which could be used by
the research community to build upon.

3 Metaphors

Although there are different views on metaphor in
linguistics and philosophy (Black, 1962; Lakoff
and Johnson, 1980; Gentner, 1983; Wilks, 2007),
the common among all approaches is the idea of
an interconceptual mapping that underlies the pro-
duction of metaphorical expressions. There are
two concepts or conceptual domains: the target
(also called topic in the linguistics literature) and
the source (or vehicle), and the existence of a link
between them gives rise to metaphors.

The texts “Your claims are indefensible.” and
“He attacked every weak point in my argument.”
do not directly talk about argument as a war, how-
ever the winning or losing of arguments, the attack
or defense of positions are structured by the con-
cept of war. There is no physical battle, but there
is a verbal battle and the structure of an argument
(attack, defense) reflects this (Lakoff and Johnson,
1980).

As we mentioned before, there has been a lot of
work on the automatic identification of metaphors
(Wilks, 2007; Shutova et al., 2010) and their
mapping into conceptual space (Shutova, 2010a;
Shutova, 2010b), however these are beyond the
scope of this paper. Instead we focus on an equally
interesting, challenging and important problem,
which concerns the automatic identification of af-
fect carried by metaphors. To conduct our study,
we use human annotators to collect metaphor-rich
texts (Shutova and Teufel, 2010) and tag each
metaphor with its corresponding polarity (Posi-
tive/Negative) and valence [−3,+3] scores. The
next sections describe the affect polarity and va-
lence tasks we have defined, the collected and an-
notated metaphor-rich data for each one of the En-
glish, Spanish, Russian and Farsi languages, the
conducted experiments and obtained results.

4 Task A: Polarity Classification

4.1 Problem Formulation

Task Definition: Given metaphor-rich texts annotated with
Positive and Negative polarity labels, the goal is to build an
automated computational affect model, which can assign to
previously unseen metaphors one of the two polarity classes.

Figure 1: Polarity Classification

Figure 1 illustrates the polarity task in which the
metaphors were classified into Positive or Nega-
tive. For instance, the metaphor “tough pill to
swallow” has Negative polarity as it stands for
something being hard to digest or comprehend,
while the metaphor “values that gave our nation
birth” has a Positive polarity as giving birth is like
starting a new beginning.

4.2 Classification Algorithms
We model the metaphor polarity task as a classifi-
cation problem in which, for a given collection of
N training examples, where mi is a metaphor and
ci is the polarity of mi, the objective is to learn
a classification function f : mi → ci in which 1
stands for positive polarity and 0 stands for neg-
ative polarity. We tested five different machine
learning algorithms such as Nave Bayes, SVM
with polynomial kernel, SVM with RBF kernel,
AdaBoost and Stacking, out of which AdaBoost
performed the best. In our experimental study, we
use the freely available implementations in Weka
(Witten and Frank, 2005).
Evaluation Measures: To evaluate the goodness
of the polarity classification algorithms, we cal-
culate the f-score and accuracy on 10-fold cross
validation.

4.3 Data Annotation
To conduct our experimental study, we have used
annotated data provided by the Language Com-
puter Corporation (LCC)1, which developed anno-

1http://www.languagecomputer.com/

tation toolkit specifically for the task of metaphor
detection, interpretation and affect assignment.
They hired annotators to collect and annotate data
for the English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi lan-
guages. The domain for which the metaphors were
collected was Governance. It encompasses elec-
toral politics, the setting of economic policy, the
creation, application and enforcement of rules and
laws. The metaphors were collected from polit-
ical speeches, political websites, online newspa-
pers among others (Mohler et al., 2013).

The annotation toolkit allowed annotators to
provide for each metaphor the following infor-
mation: the metaphor, the context in which the
metaphor was found, the meaning of the metaphor
in the source and target domains from the per-
spective of a native speaker. For example, in the
Context: And to all nations, we will speak for the
values that gave our nation birth.; the annotators
tagged the Metaphor: values that gave our nation
birth; and listed as Source: mother gave birth to
baby; and Target: values of freedom and equal-
ity motivated the creation of America. The same
annotators also provided the affect associated with
the metaphor. The agreements of the annotators as
measured by LCC are: .83, .87, .80 and .61 for the
English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi languages.

In our study, the maximum length of a metaphor
is a sentence, but typically it has the span of a
phrase. The maximum length of a context is three
sentences before and after the metaphor, but typ-
ically it has the span of one sentence before and
after. In our study, the source and target domains
are provided by the human annotators who agree
on these definitions, however the source and target
can be also automatically generated by an inter-
pretation system or a concept mapper. The gen-
eration of source and target information is beyond
the scope of this paper, but studying their impact
on affect is important. At the same time, we want
to show that if the technology for source/target de-
tection and interpretation is not yet available, then
how far can one reach by using the metaphor itself
and the context around it. Later depending on the
availability of the information sources and toolkits
one can decide whether to integrate such informa-
tion or to ignore it. In the experimental sections,
we show how the individual information sources
and their combination affects the resolution of the
metaphor polarity and valence prediction tasks.

guages

The majority of the the annotated examples are
for English. However, given the difficulty of find-
ing bilingual speakers, we still managed to collect
around 600 examples for Spanish and Farsi, and
886 examples for Russian.

4.4 N-gram Evaluation and Results

N-gram features are widely used in a variety of
classification tasks, therefore we also use them in
our polarity classification task. We studied the in-
fluence of unigrams, bigrams and a combination
of the two, and saw that the best performing fea-
ture set consists of the combination of unigrams
and bigrams. In this paper, we will refer from now
on to n-grams as the combination of unigrams and
bigrams.

Figure 2 shows a study of the influence of the
different information sources and their combina-
tion with n-gram features for English.

Figure 2: Influence of Information Sources for
Metaphor Polarity Classification of English Texts

For each information source (metaphor, context,
source, target and their combinations), we built a
separate n-gram feature set and model, which was
evaluated on 10-fold cross validation. The results
from this study show that for English, the more
information sources one combines, the higher the
classification accuracy becomes.

Table 2 shows the influence of the information
sources for Spanish, Russian and Farsi with the n-
gram features. The best f-scores for each language
are shown in bold. For Farsi and Russian high per-
formances are obtained both with the context and
with the combination of the context, source and
target information. While for Spanish they reach
similar performance.

4.5 LIWC as a Proxy for Metaphor Polarity

LIWC Repository: In addition to the n-gram
features, we also used the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) repository (Tausczik and
Pennebaker, 2010), which has 64 word categories
corresponding to different classes like emotional
states, psychological processes, personal concerns
among other. Each category contains a list of
words characterizing it. For instance, the LIWC
category discrepancy contains words like should,
could among others, while the LIWC category in-
hibition contains words like block, stop, constrain.
Previously LIWC was successfully used to ana-
lyze the emotional state of bloggers and tweeters
(Quercia et al., 2011) and to identify deception and
sarcasm in texts (Ott et al., 2011; González-Ibáñez
et al., 2011). When LIWC analyzes texts it gener-
ates statistics like number of words found in cat-
egory Ci divided by the total number of words in
the text. For our metaphor polarity task, we use
LIWC’s statistics of all 64 categories and feed this
information as features for the machine learning
classifiers. LIWC repository contains conceptual
categories (dictionaries) both for the English and
Spanish languages.
LIWC Evaluation and Results: In our experi-
ments LIWC is applied to English and Spanish
metaphor-rich texts since the LIWC category dic-
tionaries are available for both languages. Table 3
shows the obtained accuracy and f-score results in
English and Spanish for each one of the informa-
tion sources.

Table 3: LIWC features, Accuracy and F-scores
on 10-fold validation for English and Spanish

The best performances are reached with indi-
vidual information sources like metaphor, context,
source or target instead of their combinations. The
classifiers obtain similar performance for both lan-
guages.
LIWC Category Relevance to Metaphor Polar-
ity: We also study the importance and relevance
of the LIWC categories for the metaphor polar-
ity task. We use information gain (IG) to mea-
sure the amount of information in bits about the
polarity class prediction, if the only information
available is the presence of a given LIWC cate-
gory (feature) and the corresponding polarity class
distribution. IG measures the expected reduction
in entropy (uncertainty associated with a random
feature) (Mitchell, 1997).

Figure 3 illustrates how certain categories occur
more with the positive (in red color) vs negative
(in green color) class. With the positive metaphors
we observe the LIWC categories for present tense,
social, affect and family, while for the negative
metaphors we see LIWC categories for past tense,
inhibition and anger.

Figure 4: Example of LIWC Categories and
Words

For metaphor texts, these categories are I, con-
juntion, anger, discrepancy, swear words among
others; for contexts the categories are pronouns
like I, you, past tense, friends, affect and so on.
Our study shows that some of the LIWC categories
are important across all information sources, but
overall different triggers activate depending on the
information source and the length of the text used.

4.6 Comparative study

Figure 5 shows a comparison of the accuracy of
our best performing approach for each language.
For English and Spanish these are the LIWC mod-
els, while for Russian and Farsi these are the n-
gram models. We compare the performance of the
algorithms with a majority baseline, which assigns
the majority class to each example. For instance,
in English there are 3529 annotated examples, of
which 2086 are positive and 1443 are negative.
Since the positive class is the predominant one
for this language and dataset, a majority classifier
would have .59 accuracy in returning the positive
class as an answer. Similarly, we compute the ma-
jority baseline for the rest of the languages.

As we can see from Figure 5 that all classi-
fiers significantly outperform the majority base-

line. For Farsi the increment is +11.90, while for
English the increment is +39.69. This means that
the built classifiers perform much better than a ran-
dom classifier.

4.7 Lessons Learned

To summarize, in this section we have defined the
task of polarity classification and we have pre-
sented a machine learning solution. We have used
different feature sets and information sources to
solve the task. We have conducted exhaustive
evaluations for four different languages namely
English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi. The learned
lessons from this study are: (1) for n-gram us-
age, the larger the context of the metaphor, the
better the classification accuracy becomes; (2) if
present source and target information can further
boost the performance of the classifiers; (3) LIWC
is a useful resource for polarity identification in
metaphor-rich texts; (4) analyzing the usages of
tense like past vs. present and pronouns are im-
portant triggers for positive and negative polarity
of metaphors; (5) some categories like family, so-
cial presence indicate positive polarity, while oth-
ers like inhibition, anger and swear words are in-
dicative of negative affect; (6) the built models sig-
nificantly outperform majority baselines.

5 Task B: Valence Prediction

5.1 Problem Formulation

Task Definition: Given metaphor-rich texts annotated
with valence score (from −3 to +3), where −3 indicates
strong negativity, +3 indicates strong positivity, 0 indi-
cates neural, the goal is to build a model that can predict
without human supervision the valence scores of new pre-
viously unseen metaphors.

further with the budget knife by 
eliminating the V-22 Osprey aircraft

to bridge Washington’s partisan

Figure 6: Valence Prediction

Figure 6 shows an example of the valence pre-
diction task in which the metaphor-rich texts must
be arranged by the intensity of the emotional
state provoked by the texts. For instance, −3
corresponds to very strong negativity, −2 strong
negativity, −1 weak negativity (similarly for the
positive classes). In this task we also consider
metaphors with neutral affect. They are annotated
with the 0 label and the prediction model should be
able to predict such intensity as well. For instance,
the metaphor “values that gave our nation birth”,
is considered by American people that giving birth
sets new beginning and has a positive score +1,
but “budget knife” is more positive +3 since tax
cut is more important. As any sentiment analysis
task, affect assignment of metaphors is also a sub-
jective task and the produced annotations express
the values, believes and understanding of the an-
notators.

5.2 Regression Model
We model the valence task a regression prob-
lem, in which for a given metaphor m, we seek
to predict the valence v of m. We do this via
a parametrized function f :v̂ = f(m;w), where
w ∈ Rd are the weights. The objective is to
learn w from a collection of N training examples
{< mi, vi >}Ni=1, where mi are the metaphor ex-
amples and vi ∈ R is the valence score of mi.

Support vector regression (Drucker et al., 1996)
is a well-known method for training a regression
model by solving the following optimization prob-
lem:

min
w∈Rs

1

2
||w||2 + C

N

N∑

i=1

max(0, |vi − f(mi;w)| − �)︸ ︷︷ ︸
�-insensitive loss function

where C is a regularization constant and � controls
the training error. The training algorithm finds
weights w that define a function f minimizing the
empirical risk. Let h be a function from seeds into
some vector-space representation ⊆ Rd, then the
function f takes the form: f(m;w) = h(m)Tw =∑N

i=1 αiK(m,mi), where f is re-parameterized
in terms of a polynomial kernel function K with
dual weights αi. K measures the similarity be-
tween two metaphoric texts. Full details of the
regression model and its implementation are be-
yond the scope of this paper; for more details see
(Schölkopf and Smola, 2001; Smola et al., 2003).
In our experimental study, we use the freely avail-
able implementation of SVM in Weka (Witten and
Frank, 2005).

Evaluation Measures: To evaluate the quality of
the valence prediction model, we compare the ac-
tual valence score of the metaphor given by human
annotators denoted with y against those valence
scores predicted by the regression model denoted
with x. We estimate the goodness of the regres-
sion model calculating both the correlation coef-

ficient ccx,y =

and the mean squared error msex,y =

The two evaluation measures should be interpreted
in the following manner. Intuitively the higher the
correlation score is, the better the correlation be-
tween the actual and the predicted valence scores
will be. Similarly the smaller the mean squared
error rate, the better the regression model fits the
valence predictions to the actual score.

5.3 Data Annotation

To conduct our valence prediction study, we used
the same human annotators from the polarity clas-
sification task for each one of the English, Span-
ish, Russian and Farsi languages. We asked the
annotators to map each metaphor on a [−3,+3]
scale depending on the intensity of the affect asso-
ciated with the metaphor.

Table 4 shows the distribution (number of ex-
amples) for each valence class and for each lan-
guage.

5.4 Empirical Evaluation and Results

For each language and information source we built
separate valence prediction regression models. We
used the same features for the regression task as
we have used in the classification task. Those in-
clude n-grams (unigrams, bigrams and combina-
tion of the two), LIWC scores. Table 5 shows
the obtained correlation coefficient (CC) and mean
squared error (MSE) results for each one of the
four languages (English, Spanish, Russian and
Farsi) using the dataset described in Table 4.

The Farsi and Russian regression models are
based only on n-gram features, while the English
and Spanish regression models have both n-gram
and LIWC features. Overall, the CC for English

and Spanish is higher when LIWC features are
used. This means that the LIWC based valence re-
gression model approximates the predicted values
better to those of the human annotators. The better
valence prediction happens when the metaphor it-
self is used by LIWC. The MSE for English and
Spanish is the lowest, meaning that the predic-
tion is the closest to those of the human annota-
tors. In Russian and Farsi the lowest MSE is when
the combined metaphor, source and target infor-
mation sources are used. For English and Spanish
the smallest MSE or so called prediction error is
1.52 and 1.30 respectively, while for Russian and
Farsi is 1.62 and 2.13 respectively.

5.5 Lessons Learned

To summarize, in this section we have defined
the task of valence prediction of metaphor-rich
texts and we have described a regression model
for its solution. We have studied different fea-
ture sets and information sources to solve the task.
We have conducted exhaustive evaluations in all
four languages namely English, Spanish, Russian
and Farsi. The learned lessons from this study
are: (1) valence prediction is a much harder task
than polarity classification both for human annota-
tion and for the machine learning algorithms; (2)
the obtained results showed that despite its dif-
ficulty this is still a plausible problem; (3) sim-
ilarly to the polarity classification task, valence
prediction with LIWC is improved when shorter
contexts (the metaphor/source/target information
source) are considered.

6 Conclusion

People use metaphor-rich language to express af-
fect and often affect is expressed through the usage
of metaphors. Therefore, understanding that the
metaphor “I was boiling inside when I saw him.”
has Negative polarity as it conveys feeling of anger
is very important for interpersonal or multicultural
communications.

In this paper, we have introduced a novel corpus
of metaphor-rich texts for the English, Spanish,
Russian and Farsi languages, which was manu-
ally annotated with the polarity and valence scores
of the affect conveyed by the metaphors. We
have studied the impact of different information
sources such as the metaphor in isolation, the con-
text in which the metaphor was used, the source
and target domain meanings of the metaphor and

their combination in order to understand how such
information helps and impacts the interpretation
of the affect associated with the metaphor. We
have conducted exhaustive evaluation with multi-
ple machine learning classifiers and different fea-
tures sets spanning from lexical information to
psychological categories developed by (Tausczik
and Pennebaker, 2010). Through experiments car-
ried out on the developed datasets, we showed that
the proposed polarity classification and valence
regression models significantly improve baselines
(from 11.90% to 39.69% depending on the lan-
guage) and work well for all four languages. From
the two tasks, the valence prediction problem was
more challenging both for the human annotators
and the automated system. The mean squared er-
ror in valence prediction in the range [−3,+3],
where −3 indicates strong negative and +3 indi-
cates strong positive affect for English, Spanish
and Russian was around 1.5, while for Farsi was
around 2.

The current findings and learned lessons reflect
the properties of the collected data and its anno-
tations. In the future we are interested in study-
ing the affect of metaphors for domains differ-
ent than Governance. We want to conduct stud-
ies with the help of social sciences who would re-
search whether the tagging of affect in metaphors
depends on the political affiliation, age, gender or
culture of the annotators. Not on a last place, we
would like to improve the built valence prediction
models and to collect more data for Spanish, Rus-
sian and Farsi.
