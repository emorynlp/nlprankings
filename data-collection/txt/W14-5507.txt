Abstract

Despite SMT (Statistical Machine Translation) recently revolutionised MT for major language pairs, when
addressing under-resourced and, to some extent, mildly-resourced languages, it still faces some difficulties
such as the need of important quantities of parallel texts, the limited guaranty of the quality, etc. We thus
speculate that RBMT (Rule Based Machine Translation) can fill the gap for these languages.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we present an ongoing work that aims at assessing the relevance of specific methods to reach
“quick and quality” machine translation for under-resourced languages. These methods include working in
parallel  on several  languages,  reusing software and linguistic  resources,  relying on a  pivot  architecture,
opening our linguistic sources and letting any group of users the possibility to “do it themselves”. We also
chose to adopt the old fashioned RBMT approach. 

More  concretely,  we  are  applying  Vauquois’  methodology  [Vauquois  and  Chappuy,  1985]  to  the
development of analysers for Khmer, Lao, Thai and Hindi, which we plan to “connect” to existing and open
source syntheses of French and English through three means: deep transfer, deep hybrid transfer and UNL
pivot representation. In order to elaborate easy-to-understand guidelines for new comers, we chose to create
a primer methodological step involving the small novel of Saint-Exupéry “The Little Prince”, which has
been translated into 270 languages and dialects. Doing so, the principles for developing dictionaries and
grammars that follow Vauquois’ methodology become much simpler to understand.

2 Tools and methodology

2.1 The Heloise RBMT framework

The RBMT framework we are using is called
Heloise.  It  has  been  presented  at  COLING
2012 [Berment and Boitet, 2012]. Heloise is an
online  environment  available  to  anyone
wishing to design his or her own operational
expert  MT  system,  especially  for  under-
resourced  pairs  of  languages.  It  is  upward-
compatible with Ariane-G5’s languages, so the
open-source  modules  developed  under  this
environment can be reused in any new system.
For example, in order to add a new language
X, an existing generation of French language
can  be  taken  as  such  for  a  new  X-French
system,  limiting  the  effort  to  an  analyser  of
language X and to a transfer from X to French.
Figure 1 represents the usual phases involved
in a development under Ariane-G5.

2.2 GÉTA’s methodology

The approach of the GÉTA group of Grenoble (France), who created Ariane-G5, is a second generation MT,
in which the text to be translated is first transformed into an abstract representation, as independent of any
language as possible, so this abstract representation can then be translated in any other language. The abstract
representation is a multi-level structure (m-structure) ideally containing the logic (predicate-argument) and
semantic data that are the most language-independent computed in this approach. As this deep level is not
always reached, two other (lower) levels are borne by the m-structure: the syntagmatic level and the syntactic
dependency level, so the translation system will output the best it can do.

As one can see in Figure 1, the development is made of modules corresponding to the different steps of the
translation. If we concentrate on the analysis (the systems we are working on are X-French and X-English
systems  so  firstly  on  analysers  for  the  X  languages),  the  work  consists  in  developing  monolingual
dictionaries containing all the information necessary for the analysis, as well as structural analysers. As such
linguistic descriptions are rather complex, one first needs to specify what will be programmed, especially for
the structural part. GÉTA’s answer to this issue consists in making a list of the different structural phenomena
found in the language, each one being represented as a correspondence between a string and its abstract
representation (“charts”), and establishing links between the charts so the charts can include references to
other charts. One can think it roughly as derivation rules in formal grammars in which terminal elements are
classes of words and non-terminal elements are charts.  For example, a noun phrase (the string) such as
[adjective+noun] can be represented as NP(AP,noun) where AP refers to a chart of general adjective phrases,
possibly containing adverbs as in “a very cute cat”. The formalism for those charts has initially been called
“static grammar” and later SCSG (Static Correspondence Specification Grammar).

3 Parallel work on Khmer, Hindi, Lao and Thai languages

This work aims at elaborating an efficient and simple methodology for developing MT systems for groups of
under-resourced languages. We are using for that purpose a small corpus consisting in Saint-Exupéry’s Little
Prince in Khmer, Hindi, Lao and Thai which are our source languages, and our target languages are French
and English. Two of the authors, Guillaume de Malézieux and Vincent Berment, are working on Khmer and
Lao, as two other persons, Jennifer Wong and Satenik Mkhitaryan, are working on Thai and Hindi.

3.1 Reuse of existing linguistic modules

The  systems  developed  under  Ariane-G5  are  made  of  linguistic  module  dedicated  to  each  step  of  the
translation  process  (analysis,  transfer,  generation).  In  GÉTA’s  approach,  analyses  are  independent  from
generations so an analyser for a specific language can be used with a generation of any other language. As
French an English modules are available under BSD licence (among many others), we are using them for our
work so the analysers and the transfers have to be developed.

3.2 Segmentation and POS tagging

In the case of Khmer, Lao and Thai, one needs to segment into words first, as the writing systems do not
include  spaces  between  words.  This  is  done  by  Motor,  a  segmenter  performing  a  maximum matching
algorithm. It is currently available for Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Thai and Tibetan. Within the limits of our small
corpus, the obtained segmentation is 100% correct (the figure reached for general corpora is significantly
lower). In order to create the first step called “morphological analysis” in Figure 1, we need a list of words
with a number of features that will be used for the analysis. To achieve that, we fill an Excel file with the
required  data.  The  following figure  is  an  extract  of  the  Excel  file  that  describe  a  noun phrase  with  a
possessive attribution. Note that Hindi is not completed and was not included is this paper.

 

FIGURE 2 – Khmer, Lao and Thai data used in the “morphological analysis”

We  used  parts  of  speech  often  found  in  GÉTA systems:  V  verb,  N  noun,  A adjunct,  R  pronoun,  S

51



subordination (preposition,  subordinating conjunction and linking word),  C coordinating conjunction.  In
Figure 2, LU stands for Lexical Unit, which is a generalisation of lemma that groups together words deriving
from the same base such as build, building, builder, etc.  That notion is very useful,  for example during
transfers where it eases paraphrasing.

The  example  in  Figure  2  is  an  ideal  case
where  the  three  languages  involved  are
aligned  word  for  word.  When  it  is  not  the
case, we have different lines for the parts in
the  different  languages  that  are  not  aligned
and we mark them as “similar”  thanks to a
colour given to those parts. That is used later
when  specifying  the  structural  analysers  as
blocks  of  words  that  are  not  aligned  may
share  common  structures  (see  the  next
section).

After the Excel file is completed, we can then
generate  automatically  the  “morphological
analysis”  source  code  written  in  ATEF
language, thanks to a tool we developed for
that  aim.  Note  that  segmenting  and  POS
tagging  have  their  own  dictionaries  so  a
special  care  is  needed  to  ensure  their
consistency.

3.3 Structural analysis

In order to perform the structural analysis of a text, one needs a formal description of the language. This
description,  that  we  call  a  specification,  will  be  written  according  to  the  formalism given  by  Bernard
Vauquois  and Sylviane Chappuy [Vauquois  et  Chappuy,  1985]  and mentioned in  section  2.2:  the  static
grammars. After we get such specification, we can start programming the analyser in the Ariane-G5 language
called ROBRA, which performs tree transformations.
Now let us have a closer look at what a static grammar is like. It is a series of charts, each chart describing a
family of strings by associating it to a tree. The charts may refer to each other. For example in order to
recognise a  complex noun phrase such as “gaz reaction”,  the two nouns have to be first  recognised as
separate valid noun phrases (for example, “gaz” is a word that makes sense on its own) so that then they can
be gathered into the same tree in order to take a new meaning. So that means the chart describing complex
noun phrases refers to the chart describing simple noun phrases. As a consequence, all the charts have to be
organised in the grammar so that the ones describing elementary phrases, that are the ones that do not need
referring to another chart, come first. Then come the charts describing simple phrases, because they can only
refer to lower charts in this hierarchy. At last come the charts for complex groups, they can refer to any chart
in the grammar. 
Now to write the charts, we need a list of variables to gather all the information we need. They can be of
different types, but for the purpose of our study, we will only need basic information. Because we use the
limited vocabulary of the Little Prince, we won't have to work much on disambiguation. So for now we are
only using POS information, with some refinements to recognise mass nouns from countable nouns, and
some subcategories  of verbs.  As an example,  we will  present  the  chart  describing  the possession noun
phrases, that are built identically in the three languages: noun + particle “of ” + personal pronoun. Here in
order to write a chart that could apply to Lao, Thai and Khmer languages at a time, we will use the variable
OF to refer to របស់ in Khmer, ของ in Thai, and ຂອງ in Lao. A static chart is divided into three zones. The
first  one  is  a  string-tree  correspondence,  describing  the structure  to  be recognised.  Each node and leaf
receives a number. In FIGURE 4, the root node of our noun phrase is the number 1. Numbers 2, 3 and 4 are
the leaves, and each cross below represents a word of the string. The square brackets around number 3 mean
that it is optional. The last two lines at the bottom of the tree give information about the words. For example
leave 2 is a noun, and more precisely a common noun, leave 3 is a subordinating and its LU is the particle
OF, and at last, leave 4 is a personal pronoun. One particularity in this tree is the fact that the node 3 is not

52



linked to the root. This is because although the particle needs to be taken into account during the analysis, we
chose not to have it appear into the tree. All the information it carries will be transferred into other nodes.
Zone 2 of the static chart provides complementary information on the condition necessary for the structure to
be correct. This could be semantic information on one of the nodes, or the presence of one node excluding
another, etc. But we do not need any information of this type in the chart we are studying. At last, it is in
zone 3 that we present the actions to be taken on the tree. In our case, we store in a variable the possession
relation. We also assign the noun of leave 2 to be the governor, that is to say the head, of the phrase.

3.4 Lexical transfer

In transfers, we transform the Lexical Units and their variables from the source to the target lexical spaces.
As we found lexical similarities between Thai, Lao and Khmer languages — ULs are between 50% and 70%
common —, a large part of the transfers is also common to those languages.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented an ongoing work. A lot remains to be done but we already observe that working
in parallel  on several  languages brings a  lot of  advantage.  For example,  when a question raises  on the
methodology, on how we can build a specific static chart, etc., people working on any language can answer.
For  this  purpose,  the  Ariane/Heloise  community  has  set-up  a  Web  site  and  enriches  it  continuously:
lingwarium.org. Also, as for the structural phases, we noted that many structures were common between
Khmer Lao and Thai (Hindi development is late because of the few common features shared with the other
languages), thus reducing the effort for making the static grammars. We also noted that the time to develop
the transfers were dramatically reduced as a large part of them were common to the three languages. That
remains to be further evaluated but we are already convinced it is a way that will help reaching Christian
Boitet’s prediction that 600 languages will have access to machine translation [Boitet, 2013].
