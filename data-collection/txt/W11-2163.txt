Abstract
We describe our experiments with hier-
archical phrase-based machine translation
for the WMT 2011 Shared Task. We
trained a system for all 8 translation di-
rections between English on one side and
Czech, German, Spanish or French on
the other side, though we focused slightly
more on the English-to-Czech direction.
We provide a detailed description of our
configuration and data so the results are
replicable.

1 Introduction

With so many official languages, Europe is a par-
adise for machine translation research. One of the
largest bodies of electronically available parallel
texts is being nowadays generated by the European
Union and its institutions. At the same time, the
EU also provides motivation and boosts potential
market for machine translation outcomes.
Most of the major European languages belong

to one of the following three branches of the
Indo-European language family: Germanic, Ro-
mance or Slavic. Such relatedness is responsible
for many structural similarities in European lan-
guages, although significant differences still ex-
ist. Within the language portfolio selected for the
WMT shared task, English, French and Spanish
seem to be closer to each other than to the rest.
German, despite being genetically related to En-

glish, differs in many properties. Its word or-
der rules, shifting verbs from one end of the sen-
tence to the other, easily create long-distance de-
pendencies. Long German compound words are
notorious for increasing out-of-vocabulary rate,
which has led many researchers to devising un-
supervised compound-splitting techniques. Also,
uppercase/lowercase distinction is more important
because all German nouns start with an uppercase
letter by the rule.

Czech is a language with rich morphology (both
inflectional and derivational) and relatively free
word order. In fact, the predicate-argument struc-
ture, often encoded by fixed word order in English,
is usually captured by inflection (especially the
system of 7 grammatical cases) in Czech. While
the free word order of Czech is a problem when
translating to English (the text should be parsed
first in order to determine the syntactic functions
and the English word order), generating correct in-
flectional affixes is indeed a challenge for English-
to-Czech systems. Furthermore, the multitude
of possible Czech word forms (at least order of
magnitude higher than in English) makes the data
sparseness problem really severe, hindering both
directions.

There are numerous ways how these issues
could be addressed. For instance, parsing and
syntax-aware reordering of the source-language
sentences can help with the word order differ-
ences (same goal could be achieved by a reorder-
ing model or a synchronous context-free grammar
in a hierarchical system). Factored translation, a
secondary language model of morphological tags
or even a morphological generator are some of the
possible solutions to the poor-to-rich translation is-
sues.

Our goal is to run one system under as simi-
lar conditions as possible to all eight translation
directions, to compare their translation accuracies
and see why some directions are easier than others.
Future work will benefit from knowing what are
the special processing needs for a given language
pair. The current version of the system does not in-
clude really language-specific techniques: we nei-
ther split German compounds, nor do we address
the peculiarities of Czech mentioned above. Still,
comparability of the results is limited, as the qual-
ity and quantity of English-Czech data differs from
that of the other pairs.

2 The Translation System

Our translation system belongs to the hierarchi-
cal phrase-based class (Chiang, 2007), i.e. phrase
pairs with nonterminals (rules of a synchronous
context-free grammar) are extracted from sym-
metrized word alignments and subsequently used
by the decoder. We use Joshua, a Java-based open-
source implementation of the hierarchical decoder
(Li et al., 2009), release 1.3.1

Word alignment was computed using the first
three steps of the train-factored-phrase-
model.perl script packed with Moses2 (Koehn et
al., 2007). This includes the usual combination of
word clustering using mkcls3 (Och, 1999), two-
way word alignment using GIZA++4 (Och and
Ney, 2003), and alignment symmetrization using
the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al.,
2003).
For language modeling we use the SRILM

toolkit5 (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and
Goodman, 1998).
We use the Z-MERT implementation of mini-

mum error rate training (Zaidan, 2009). The fol-
lowing settings have been used for Joshua and Z-
MERT (for the sake of reproducibility, we keep the
original names of the options; for their detailed ex-
planation please refer to the documentation avail-
able on-line at the Joshua project site). -ipi is the
number of intermediate initial points per Z-MERT
iteration.

3 Data and Pre-processing Pipeline

We applied our system to all eight language pairs.
From the data point of view the experiments
were even more constrained than the organizers
of the shared task suggested. We used neither
the French/Spanish-English UN corpora nor the
109 French-English corpus. For 7 translation di-
rections we used the Europarl ver6 and News-
Commentary ver6 corpora6 for training. The target
side of the corporawas our only source ofmonolin-
gual data for training the language model. Table 1
shows the size of the training data.
For the English-Czech direction, we used

CzEng 0.9 (Bojar and Žabokrtský, 2009)7 as our
main parallel corpus. Following CzEng authors’
request, we did not use sections 8* and 9* reserved
for evaluation purposes.
In addition, we also used the EMEA corpus8

(Tiedemann, 2009).9
Czech was also the only language where we

used extra monolingual data for the language
model. It was the set provided by the organizers of
WMT 2010 (13,042,040 sentences, 210,507,305
tokens).
We use a slightly modified tokenization rules

compared to CzEng export format. Most notably,
we normalize English abbreviated negation and
auxiliary verbs (“couldn’t” → “could not”) and
attempt at normalizing quotation marks to distin-
guish between opening and closing one following
proper typesetting rules.
The rest of our pre-processing pipeline matches

the processing employed in CzEng (Bojar and
Žabokrtský, 2009).10 We use “supervised truecas-
ing”, meaning that we cast the case of the lemma
to the form, relying on our morphological analyz-
ers and taggers to identify proper names, all other

9Unfortunately, the EMEA corpus is badly tokenized on

the Czech side with fractional numbers split into several to-
kens (e.g. “3, 14”). We attempted to reconstruct the original
detokenized form using a small set of regular expressions.

words are lowercased.
Note that in some cases the grammar extraction

algorithm in Joshua fails if the training corpus con-
tains sentences that are too long. Removing sen-
tences of 100 or more tokens (per advice by Joshua
developers) effectively healed all failures.11
The News Test 2008 data set12 (2051 sentences

in each language) was used as development data
for MERT. BLEU scores reported in this paper
were computed on the News Test 2011 set (3003
sentences each language). We do not use the News
Test 2009 and 2010.

4 Experiments

All BLEU scores were computed directly by
Joshua on the News Test 2011 set. Note that
they differ from what the official evaluation script
would report, due to different tokenization.

4.1 Baseline Experiments
The set of baseline experiments with all translation
directions involved running the system on lower-
cased News Commentary corpora. Word align-
ments were computed on lowercased 4-character
stems. A hexagram language model was trained
on the target side of the parallel corpus.
In the en-cs case, word alignments were com-

puted on lemmatized version of the parallel cor-
10Due to the subsequent processing, incl. parsing, the tok-

enization of English follows PennTreebenk style. The rather
unfortunate convention of treating hyphenated words as sin-
gle tokens increases our out-of-vocabulary rate.

tences.

task.html

pus. Hexagram language model was trained on
the monolingual data. Truecased data were used
for training, as described above; the BLEU score
of this experiment in Table 2 is computed on true-
cased system output.

Direction BLEUJ BLEUl BLEUt
en-cs 0.1274 0.141 0.123
en-de 0.1324 0.128 0.052
en-es 0.2756 0.274 0.221
en-fr 0.2727 0.212 0.174
cs-en 0.1782 0.178 0.137
de-en 0.1957 0.187 0.137
es-en 0.2630 0.255 0.197
fr-en 0.2471 0.248 0.193

Table 2: Lowercased BLEU scores of the baseline
experiments on News Test 2011 data: BLEUJ is
computed by the system, BLEUl is the official
evaluation by matrix.statmt.org (it differs be-
cause of different tokenization). BLEUt is offi-
cial truecased evaluation.

An interesting perspective on the models is pro-
vided by the feature weights optimized during
MERT. We can see in Table 3 that translation
models are trusted significantly more than lan-
guage models for the en-de, de-en and es-en di-
rections. In fact, the language model has a low rel-
ative weight in all language pairs but en-cs, which
was the only pair where we used a significant
amount of extra monolingual data. In the future,
we should probably use the Gigaword corpus for
the to-English directions.

Setup LM Pt0 Pt1 Pt2 WP
en-cs 1.0 1.04 0.84 −0.06 −1.19
en-de 1.0 2.60 0.57 0.47 −3.17
en-es 1.0 1.67 0.81 0.60 −2.96
en-fr 1.0 1.41 0.92 0.53 −2.80
cs-en 1.0 1.48 0.94 1.08 −4.55
de-en 1.0 2.28 1.11 0.34 −2.88
es-en 1.0 2.26 1.67 0.23 −0.84
fr-en 1.0 1.89 1.32 0.13 −0.04

Table 3: Feature weights are relative to the weight
of LM , the score by the language model. Then
there are the three translation features: Pt0 =
P (e|f), Pt1 = Plex(f |e) and Pt2 = Plex(e|f).
WP is the word penalty.

4.2 Efficiency

The machines on which the experiments were con-
ducted are 64bit Intel Xeon dual core 2.8 GHz
CPUs with 32 GB RAM.
Word alignment of each parallel corpus was the

most resource-consuming subtask. It took between
12 and 48 hours, though it could be cut to one half
by running both GIZA++ directions in parallel.
The time needed for data preprocessing and train-
ing of the language model was negligible. Paral-
lelized grammar extraction took 19 processors for
about an hour. For decoding the test data were split
into 20 chunks that were processed in parallel. One
MERT iteration, including decoding, took from 30
minutes to 1 hour.
Training of large models requires some careful

engineering. The grammar extraction easily con-
sumes over 20 GB memory so it is important to
make sure Java really has access to it. The de-
coder must use the SWIG-linked SRILM library
because Java-based language modeling is too slow
and memory-consuming.

4.3 Supervised Truecasing

Our baseline experiments operated on lowercased
data, except for en-cs, where truecased word forms
were obtained using lemmas from morphological
annotation (note that guessing of the true case is
only needed for the sentence-initial token, other
words can just be left in their original form).
As contrastive runs we applied the supervised

truecasing to other directions as well. We used
the Morče tagger for English lemmatization, Tree-
Tagger for German and two simple rule-based ap-
proaches to Spanish and French lemmatization.
All these tools are embedded in the TectoMT anal-
ysis framework (Žabokrtský et al., 2008).
The results are in Table 4. BLEUt has increased

in all cases w.r.t. the baseline results.

4.4 Alignment on Lemmas

Once we are able to lemmatize all five languages
we can also experiment with word alignments
based on lemmas. Table 5 shows that the differ-
ences in BLEU are insignificant.

5 Conclusion

We have described the hierarchical phrase-based
SMT system we used for the WMT 2011 shared
task. We discussed experiments with large data

Direction BLEUJ BLEUl BLEUt
en-cs 0.1191 0.126 0.119
en-de 0.1337 0.131 0.127
en-es 0.2573 0.276 0.265
en-fr 0.2591 0.211 0.189
cs-en 0.1692 0.180 0.168

fr-en 0.2243 0.245 0.221

Table 4: Results of experiments with supervised
truecasing. Note that training on truecased corpus
slightly influenced even the lowercased BLEU (cf.
with Table 2). This is because probabilities of to-
kens that may appear both uppercased and lower-
cased (with different meanings) have changed, and
thus different translation may have been chosen.

Table 5: Results of experiments with word align-
ment computed on different factors. BLEUJ l4 is
the score computed by Joshua on lowercased test
data for the original experiments (alignment based
on lowercased 4-character prefixes). BLEUJ lm
is the corresponding score for alignment based on
lemmas.

from the point of view of both the translation ac-
curacy and efficiency. We used moderately-sized
training data and took advantage from their ba-
sic linguistic annotation (lemmas). The truecasing
technique helped us to better target named entities.
