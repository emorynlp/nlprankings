Abstract

Representation learning of knowledge
bases aims to embed both entities and
relations into a low-dimensional space.
Most existing methods only consider
direct relations in representation learning.
We argue that multiple-step relation paths
also contain rich inference patterns be-
tween entities, and propose a path-based
representation learning model. This model
considers relation paths as translations
between entities for representation learn-
ing, and addresses two key challenges: (1)
Since not all relation paths are reliable,
we design a path-constraint resource allo-
cation algorithm to measure the reliability
of relation paths. (2) We represent relation
paths via semantic composition of relation
embeddings. Experimental results on
real-world datasets show that, as com-
pared with baselines, our model achieves
significant and consistent improvements
on knowledge base completion and re-
lation extraction from text. The source

1 Introduction

People have recently built many large-scale
knowledge bases (KBs) such as Freebase, DBpe-
dia and YAGO. These KBs consist of facts about
the real world, mostly in the form of triples, e.g.,
(Steve Jobs, FounderOf, Apple Inc.). KBs are
important resources for many applications such as
question answering and Web search. Although
typical KBs are large in size, usually containing
thousands of relation types, millions of entities
and billions of facts (triples), they are far from

complete. Hence, many efforts have been invested
in relation extraction to enrich KBs.

Recent studies reveal that, neural-based repre-
sentation learning methods are scalable and ef-
fective to encode relational knowledge with low-
dimensional representations of both entities and
relations, which can be further used to extract
unknown relational facts. TransE (Bordes et al.,
2013) is a typical method in the neural-based ap-
proach, which learns vectors (i.e., embeddings) for
both entities and relations. The basic idea behind
TransE is that, the relationship between two enti-
ties corresponds to a translation between the em-
beddings of the entities, that is, h + r ≈ t when
the triple (h, r, t) holds. Since TransE has issues
when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N rela-
tions, various methods such as TransH (Wang et
al., 2014) and TransR (Lin et al., 2015) are pro-
posed to assign an entity with different represen-
tations when involved in various relations.

Despite their success in modeling relational
facts, TransE and its extensions only take di-
rect relations between entities into considera-
tion. It is known that there are also substan-
tial multiple-step relation paths between entities
indicating their semantic relationships. The re-
lation paths reflect complicated inference pat-
terns among relations in KBs. For example, the
relation path h BornInCity−−−−−−−−→ e1 CityInState−−−−−−−−→
e2

StateInCountry−−−−−−−−−−−→ t indicates the relation
Nationality between h and t, i.e., (h,
Nationality, t).

In this paper, we aim at extending TransE to
model relation paths for representation learning of
KBs, and propose path-based TransE (PTransE).
In PTransE, in addition to direct connected rela-
tional facts, we also build triples from KBs us-
ing entity pairs connected with relation paths.
As shown in Figure 1, TransE only considers
direct relations between entities, e.g., h r−→ t,
builds a triple (h, r, t), and optimizes the objec-

705



tive h + r = t. PTransE generalizes TransE
by regarding multiple-step relation paths as con-
nections between entities. Take the 2-step path
h

r1−→ e1 r2−→ t for example as shown in Figure 1.
Besides building triples (h, r1, e1) and (e1, r2, t)
for learning as in TransE, PTransE also builds a
triple (h, r1 ◦ r2, t), and optimizes the objective
h + (r1 ◦ r2) = t, where ◦ is an operation to join
the relations r1 and r2 together into a unified rela-
tion path representation.

As compared with TransE, PTransE takes rich
relation paths in KBs for learning. There are two
critical challenges that make PTransE nontrivial to
learn from relation paths:

Relation Path Reliability. Not all relation
paths are meaningful and reliable for learning. For
example, there is often a relation path h Friend−−−−−→
e1

Profession−−−−−−−−→ t, but actually it does not indicate
any semantic relationship between h and t. Hence,
it is inappropriate to consider all relation paths in
our model. In experiments, we find that those re-
lation paths that lead to lots of possible tail enti-
ties are mostly unreliable for the entity pair. In
this paper, we propose a path-constraint resource
allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of
relation paths. Afterwards, we select the reliable
relation paths for representation learning.

Relation Path Representation. In order to take
relation paths into consideration, relation paths
should also be represented in a low-dimensional
space. It is straightforward that the semantic
meaning of a relation path depends on all relations
in this path. Given a relation path p = (r1, . . . , rl)
, we will define and learn a binary operation func-
tion (◦) to obtain the path embedding p by re-
cursively composing multiple relations, i.e., p =
r1 ◦ . . . ◦ rl.

With relation path selection and representation,
PTransE learns entity and relation embeddings by

regarding relation paths as translations between
the corresponding entities. In experiments, we
select a typical KB, Freebase, to build datasets
and carry out evaluation on three tasks, including
entity prediction, relation prediction and relation
extraction from text. Experimental results show
that, PTransE significantly outperforms TransE
and other baseline methods on all three tasks.

2 Our Model

In this section, we introduce path-based TransE
(PTransE) that learns representations of entities
and relations considering relation paths. In TransE
and PTransE, we have entity set E and relation
set R, and learn to encode both entities and re-
lations in Rk. Given a KB represented by a set of
triples S = {(h, r, t)} with each triple composed
of two entities h, t ∈ E and their relation r ∈ R.
Our model is expected to return a low energy score
when the relation holds, and a high one otherwise.

2.1 TransE and PTransE
For each triple (h, r, t), TransE regards the relation
as a translation vector r between two entity vectors
h and t. The energy function is defined as

E(h, r, t) = ||h + r− t||, (1)
which is expected to get a low score when (h, r, t)
holds, and high otherwise.

TransE only learns from direct relations be-
tween entities but ignores multiple-step relation
paths, which also contain rich inference patterns
between entities. PTransE take relation paths into
consideration for representation learning.

Suppose there are multiple relation paths
P (h, t) = {p1, . . . , pN} connecting two entities
h and t, where relation path p = (r1, . . . , rl) indi-
cates h r1−→ . . . rl−→ t. For each triple (h, r, t), the
energy function is defined as

G(h, r, t) = E(h, r, t) + E(h, P, t), (2)

whereE(h, r, t) models correlations between rela-
tions and entities with direct relation triples, as de-
fined in Equation (1). E(h, P, t) models the infer-
ence correlations between relations with multiple-
step relation path triples, which is defined as

E(h, P, t) =
1
Z

∑
p∈P (h,t)

R(p|h, t)E(h, p, t), (3)

where R(p|h, t) indicates the reliability of the re-
lation path p given the entity pair (h, t), Z =

706



∑
p∈P (h,t)R(p|h, t) is a normalization factor, and

E(h, p, t) is the energy function of the triple
(h, p, t).

For the energy of each triple (h, p, t), the com-
ponent R(p|h, t) concerns about relation path reli-
ability, and E(h, p, t) concerns about relation path
representation. We introduce the two components
in detail as follows.

2.2 Relation Path Reliability
We propose a path-constraint resource allocation
(PCRA) algorithm to measure the reliability of a
relation path. Resource allocation over networks
was originally proposed for personalized recom-
mendation (Zhou et al., 2007), and has been suc-
cessfully used in information retrieval for measur-
ing relatedness between two objects (Lü and Zhou,
2011). Here we extend it to PCRA to measure the
reliability of relation paths. The basic idea is, we
assume that a certain amount of resource is associ-
ated with the head entity h, and will flow following
the given path p. We use the resource amount that
eventually flows to the tail entity t to measure the
reliability of the path p as a meaningful connection
between h and t.

Formally, for a path triple (h, p, t), we compute
the resource amount flowing from h to t given the
path p = (r1, . . . , rl) as follows. Starting from h
and following the relation path p, we can write the
flowing path as S0

r1−→ S1 r2−→ . . . rl−→ Sl, where
S0 = h and t ∈ Sl.

For any entity m ∈ Si, we denote its direct pre-
decessors along relation ri in Si−1 as Si−1(·,m).
The resource flowing to m is defined as

Rp(m) =
∑

n∈Si−1(·,m)

1
|Si(n, ·)|Rp(n), (4)

where Si(n, ·) is the direct successors of n ∈ Si−1
following the relation ri, andRp(n) is the resource
obtained from the entity n.

For each relation path p, we set the initial re-
source in h as Rp(h) = 1. By performing re-
source allocation recursively from h through the
path p, the tail entity t eventually obtains the re-
source Rp(t) which indicates how much informa-
tion of the head entity h can be well translated. We
use Rp(t) to measure the reliability of the path p
given (h, t), i.e., R(p|h, t) = Rp(t).
2.3 Relation Path Representation
Besides relation path reliability, we also need to
define energy functionE(h, p, t) for the path triple

(h, p, t) in Equation (2). Similar with the en-
ergy function of TransE in Equation (1), we will
also represent the relation path p in the embedding
space.

Figure 2: Path representations are computed by se-
mantic composition of relation embeddings.

The semantic meaning of a relation path con-
siderably relies on its involved relations. It is thus
reasonable for us to build path embeddings via se-
mantic composition of relation embeddings. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the path embedding p is
composed by the embeddings of BorninCity,
CityInState and StateInCountry.

Formally, for a path p = (r1, . . . , rl), we define
a composition operation ◦ and obtain path embed-
ding as p = r1 ◦ . . .◦rl. In this paper, we consider
three types of composition operation:

Addition (ADD). The addition operation ob-
tains the vector of a path by summing up the vec-
tors of all relations, which is formalized as

p = r1 + . . .+ rl. (5)

Multiplication (MUL). The multiplication op-
eration obtains the vector of a path as the cumula-
tive product of the vectors of all relations, which
is formalized as

p = r1 · . . . · rl. (6)

Both addition and multiplication operations are
simple and have been extensively investigated in
semantic composition of phrases and sentences
(Mitchell and Lapata, 2008).

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNN is a
recent neural-based model for semantic composi-
tion (Mikolov et al., 2010). The composition op-
eration is realized using a matrix W:

ci = f(W [ci−1; ri]), (7)

where f is a non-linearity or identical function,
and [a; b] represents the concatenation of two vec-

707



tors. By setting c1 = r1 and recursively perform-
ing RNN following the relation path, we will fi-
nally obtain p = cn. RNN has also been used
for representation learning of relation paths in KBs
(Neelakantan et al., 2015).

For a multiple-step relation path triple (h, p, t),
we could have followed TransE and define the
energy function as E(h, p, t) = ||h + p − t||.
However, since we have minimized ||h + r − t||
with the direct relation triple (h, r, t) to make sure
r ≈ t−h, we may directly define the energy func-
tion of (h, p, t) as

E(h, p, t) = ||p−(t−h)|| = ||p−r|| = E(p, r),
(8)

which is expected to be a low score when the
multiple-relation path p is consistent with the di-
rect relation r, and high otherwise, without using
entity embeddings.

2.4 Objective Formalization

We formalize the optimization objective of
PTransE as

L(S) =
∑

(h,r,t)∈S

[
L(h, r, t)+

1

Z

∑
p∈P (h,t)

R(p|h, t)L(p, r)
]
.

(9)

Following TransE, L(h, r, t) and L(p, r) are
margin-based loss functions with respect to the
triple (h, r, t) and the pair (p, r):

L(h, r, t) =
∑

(h′,r′,t′)∈S−
[γ + E(h, r, t)− E(h′, r′, t′)]+,

(10)

and

L(p, r) =
∑

(h,r′,t)∈S−
[γ + E(p, r)− E(p, r′)]+, (11)

where [x]+ = max(0, x) returns the maximum be-
tween 0 and x, γ is the margin, S is the set of valid
triples existing in a KB and S− is the set of invalid
triples. The objective will favor lower scores for
valid triples as compared with invalid triples.

The invalid triple set with respect to (h, r, t) is
defined as

S− = {(h′, r, t)}∪{(h, r′, t)}∪{(h, r, t′)}. (12)

That is, the set of invalid triples is composed of
the original valid triple (h, r, t) with one of three
components replaced.

2.5 Optimization and Implementation Details

For optimization, we employ stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) to minimize the loss function. We
randomly select a valid triple from the training set
iteratively for learning. In the implementation, we
also enforce constraints on the norms of the em-
beddings h, r, t. That is, we set

‖h‖2 ≤ 1, ‖r‖2 ≤ 1, ‖t‖2 ≤ 1. ∀h, r, t.
(13)

There are also some implementation details that
will significantly influence the performance of
representation learning, which are introduced as
follows.

Reverse Relation Addition. In some cases, we
are interested in the reverse version of a relation,
which may not be presented in KBs. For exam-
ple, according to the relation path e1

BornInCity−−−−−−−−→
e2

CityOfCountry←−−−−−−−−−− e3 we expect to infer the fact
that (e1,Nationality, e3). In this paper, how-
ever, we only consider the relation paths follow-
ing one direction. Hence, we add reverse relations
for each relation in KBs. That is, for each triple
(h, r, t) we build another (t, r−1, h). In this way,
our method can consider the above-mentioned
path as e1

BornInCity−−−−−−−−→ e2 CityOfCountry
−1−−−−−−−−−−−−→ e3

for learning.
Path Selection Limitation. There are usually

large amount of relations and facts about each en-
tity pair. It will be impractical to enumerate all
possible relation paths between head and tail en-
tities. For example, if each entity refers to more
than 100 relations on average, which is common
in Freebase, there will be billions of 4-step paths.
Even for 2-step or 3-step paths, it will be time-
consuming to consider all of them without limita-
tion. For computational efficiency, in this paper
we restrict the length of paths to at most 3-steps
and consider those relation paths with the reliabil-
ity score larger than 0.01.

2.6 Complexity Analysis

We denote Ne as the number of entities, Nr as
the number of relations and K as the vector di-
mension. The model parameter size of PTransE
is (NeK + NrK), which is the same as TransE.
PTransE follows the optimization procedure in-
troduced by (Bordes et al., 2013) to solve Equa-
tion (9). We denote S as the number of triples
for learning, P as the expected number of relation
paths between two entities, and L as the expected

708



length of relation paths. For each iteration in opti-
mization, the complexity of TransE is O(SK) and
the complexity of PTransE isO(SKPL) for ADD
and MUL, and O(SK2PL) for RNN.

3 Experiments and Analysis

3.1 Data Sets and Experimental Setting
We evaluate our method on a typical large-scale
KB Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008). In this pa-
per, we adopt two datasets extracted from Free-
base, i.e., FB15K and FB40K. The statistics of the
datasets are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Statistics of data sets.

Dataset #Rel #Ent #Train #Valid # Test
FB15K 1,345 14,951 483,142 50,000 59,071
FB40K 1,336 39,528 370,648 67,946 96,678

We evaluate the performance of PTransE and
other baselines by predicting whether testing
triples hold. We consider two scenarios: (1)
Knowledge base completion, aiming to predict the
missing entities or relations in given triples only
based on existing KBs. (2) Relation extraction
from texts, aiming to extract relations between en-
tities based on information from both plain texts
and KBs.

3.2 Knowledge Base Completion
The task of knowledge base completion is to com-
plete the triple (h, r, t) when one of h, t, r is miss-
ing. The task has been used for evaluation in (Bor-
des et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2012; Bordes et
al., 2013). We conduct the evaluation on FB15K,
which has 483, 142 relational triples and 1, 345 re-
lation types, among which there are rich inference
and reasoning patterns.

In the testing phase, for each testing triple
(h, r, t), we define the following score function for
prediction

S(h, r, t) = G(h, r, t) +G(t, r−1, h), (14)

and the score function G(h, r, t) is further defined
as

G(h, r, t) =||h + r− t||+
1
Z

∑
p∈P (h,t)

Pr(r|p)R(p|h, t)||p− r||.

(15)

The score function is similar to the energy func-
tion defined in Section 2.1. The difference is that,

here we consider the reliability of a path p is also
related to the inference strength given r, which is
quantified as Pr(r|p) = Pr(r, p)/Pr(p) obtained
from the training data.

We divide the stage into two sub-tasks, i.e., en-
tity prediction and relation prediction.

3.2.1 Entity Prediction
In the sub-task of entity prediction, we follow the
setting in (Bordes et al., 2013). For each test-
ing triple with missing head or tail entity, vari-
ous methods are asked to compute the scores of
G(h, r, t) for all candidate entities and rank them
in descending order.

We use two measures as our evaluation metrics:
the mean of correct entity ranks and the proportion
of valid entities ranked in top-10 (Hits@10). As
mentioned in (Bordes et al., 2013), the measures
are desirable but flawed when an invalid triple
ends up being valid in KBs. For example, when
the testing triple is (Obama, PresidentOf,
USA) with the head entity Obama is missing, the
head entity Lincoln may be regarded invalid for
prediction, but in fact it is valid in KBs. The eval-
uation metrics will under-estimate those methods
that rank these triples high. Hence, we can filter
out all these valid triples in KBs before ranking.
The first evaluation setting was named as “Raw”
and the second one as “Filter”.

For comparison, we select all methods in (Bor-
des et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) as our base-
lines and use their reported results directly since
the evaluation dataset is identical.

Ideally, PTransE has to find all possible relation
paths between the given entity and each candidate
entity. However, it is time consuming and imprac-
tical, because we need to iterate all candidate en-
tities in |E| for each testing triple. Here we adopt
a re-ranking method: we first rank all candidate
entities according to the scores from TransE, and
then re-rank top-500 candidates according to the
scores from PTransE.

For PTransE, we find the best hyperparameters
according to the mean rank in validation set. The
optimal configurations of PTransE we used are
λ = 0.001, γ = 1, k = 100 and taking L1 as
dissimilarity. For training, we limit the number of
epochs over all the training triples to 500.

Evaluation results of entity prediction are
shown in Table 2. The baselines include RESCAL
(Nickel et al., 2011), SE (Bordes et al., 2011),
SME (linear) (Bordes et al., 2012), SME (bilinear)

(Bordes et al., 2012), LFM (Jenatton et al., 2012),
TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) (original version and
our implementation considering reverse relations),
TransH (Wang et al., 2014), and TransR (Lin et al.,
2015).

For PTransE, we consider three composition op-
erations for relation path representation: addition
(ADD), multiplication (MUL) and recurrent neu-
ral networks (RNN). We also consider relation
paths with at most 2-steps and 3-steps. With the
same configurations of PTransE, our TransE im-
plementation achieves much better performance
than that reported in (Bordes et al., 2013).

From Table 2 we observe that: (1) PTransE
significantly and consistently outperforms other
baselines including TransE. It indicates that rela-
tion paths provide a good supplement for repre-
sentation learning of KBs, which have been suc-
cessfully encoded by PTransE. For example, since
both George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln were
presidents of the United States, they exhibit simi-
lar embeddings in TransE. This may lead to con-
fusion for TransE to predict the spouse of Laura
Bush. In contrast, since PTransE models rela-
tion paths, it can take advantage of the relation
paths between George W. Bush and Laura Bush,
and leads to more accurate prediction. (2) For
PTransE, the addition operation outperforms other
composition operations in both Mean Rank and
Hits@10. The reason is that, the addition opera-
tion is compatible with the learning objectives of
both TransE and PTransE. Take h r1−→ e1 r2−→ t for
example. The optimization objectives of two di-
rect relations h + r1 = e1 and e1 + r2 = t can
easily derive the path objective h + r1 + r2 = t.
(3) PTransE of considering relation paths with at
most 2-step and 3-step achieve comparable results.

This indicates that it may be unnecessary to con-
sider those relation paths that are too long.

As defined in (Bordes et al., 2013), relations in
KBs can be divided into various types according
to their mapping properties such as 1-to-1, 1-to-
N, N-to-1 and N-to-N. Here we demonstrate the
performance of PTransE and some baselines with
respect to different types of relations in Table 3.
It is observed that, on all mapping types of re-
lations, PTransE consistently achieves significant
improvement as compared with TransE.

3.2.2 Relation Prediction
Relation prediction aims to predict relations given
two entities. We also use FB15K for evaluation.
In this sub-task, we can use the score function of
PTransE to rank candidate relations instead of re-
ranking like in entity prediction.

Since our implementation of TransE has
achieved the best performance among all base-
lines for entity prediction, here we only com-
pare PTransE with TransE due to limited space.
Evaluation results are shown in Table 4, where
we report Hits@1 instead of Hits@10 for com-
parison, because Hits@10 for both TransE and
PTransE exceeds 95%. In this table, we report
the performance of TransE without reverse rela-
tions (TransE), with reverse relations (+Rev) and
considering relation paths for testing like that in
PTransE (+Rev+Path). We report the performance
of PTransE with only considering relation paths (-
TransE), only considering the part in Equation (1)
(-Path) and considering both (PTransE).

The optimal configurations of PTransE for re-
lation prediction are identical to those for entity
prediction: λ = 0.001, γ = 1, k = 100 and taking
L1 as dissimilarity.

From Table 4 we observe that: (1) PTransE out-
performs TransE+Rev+Path significantly for rela-
tion prediction by reducing 41.8% prediction er-
rors. (2) Even for TransE itself, considering re-
lation paths for testing can reduce 17.3% errors
as compared with TransE+Rev. It indicates that
encoding relation paths will benefit for predict-
ing relations. (3) PTransE with only considering
relation paths (PTransE-TransE) gets surprisingly
high mean rank. The reason is that, not all entity
pairs in testing triples have relation paths, which
will lead to random guess and the expectation of
rank of these entity pairs is |R|/2. Meanwhile,
Hits@1 of PTransE-TransE is relatively reason-
able, which indicates the worth of modeling rela-

of PTransE-TransE also indicates that entity repre-

prediction.

3.3 Relation Extraction from Text
Relation extraction from text aims to extract re-
lational facts from plain text to enrich existing
KBs. Many works regard large-scale KBs as dis-
tant supervision to annotate sentences as training
instances and build relation classifiers according to
features extracted from the sentences (Mintz et al.,
2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011;
Surdeanu et al., 2012). All these methods reason
new facts only based on plain text. TransE was
used to enrich a text-based model and achieved a
significant improvement (Weston et al., 2013), and
so do TransH (Wang et al., 2014) and TransR (Lin
et al., 2015). In this task, we explore the effective-
ness of PTransE for relation extraction from text.

We use New York Times corpus (NYT) released
by (Riedel et al., 2010) as training and testing data.
NYT aligns Freebase with the articles in New York
Times, and extracts sentence-level features such

as part-of-speech tags, dependency tree paths for
each mention. There are 53 relations (including
non-relation denoted as NA) and 121, 034 training
mentions. We use FB40K as the KB, consisting all
entities mentioned in NYT and 1, 336 relations.

In the experiments, we implemented the text-
based model Sm2r presented in (Weston et al.,
2013). We combine the ranking scores from
the text-based model with those from KB rep-
resentations to rank testing triples, and gener-
ate precision-recall curves for both TransE and
PTransE. For learning of TransE and PTransE,
we set the dimensions of entities/relations embed-
dings k = 50, the learning rate λ = 0.001, the
margin γ = 1.0 and dissimilarity metric as L1.
We also compare with MIMLRE (Surdeanu et al.,
2012) which is the state-of-art method using dis-
tant supervision. The evaluation curves are shown
in Figure 3.

From Figure 3 we can observe that, by combin-
ing with the text-based model Sm2r, the precision
of PTransE significantly outperforms TransE espe-
cially for the top-ranked triples. This indicates that
encoding relation paths is also useful for relation
extraction from text.

Note that TransE used here does not consider
reverse relations and relation paths because the
performance does not change much. We analyze
the reason as follows. In the task of knowledge
base completion, each testing triple has at least
one valid relation. In contrast, many testing triples
in this task correspond to non-relation (NA), and
there are usually several relation paths between
two entities in these non-relation triples. TransE
does not encode relation paths during the training
phase like PTransE, which results in worse perfor-
mance for predicting non-relation when consider-
ing relation paths in the testing phase, and com-
pensates the improvement on those triples that do
have relations. This indicates it is non-trivial to
encode relation paths, and also confirms the effec-
tiveness of PTransE.

3.4 Case Study of Relation Inference

We have shown that PTransE can achieve high per-
formance for knowledge base completion and re-
lation extraction from text. In this section, we
present some examples of relation inference ac-
cording to relation paths.

According to the learning results of PTransE,
we can find new facts from KBs. As shown in
Figure 4, two entities Forrest Gump and English
are connected by three relation paths, which give
us more confidence to predict the relation between
the two entities to LanguageOfFilm.

4 Related Work

Recent years have witnessed great advances of
modeling multi-relational data such as social net-
works and KBs. Many works cope with rela-
tional learning as a multi-relational representation
learning problem, encoding both entities and re-
lations in a low-dimensional latent space, based
on Bayesian clustering (Kemp et al., 2006; Miller
et al., 2009; Sutskever et al., 2009; Zhu, 2012),
energy-based models (Bordes et al., 2011; Chen et
al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Bordes et al., 2013;
Bordes et al., 2014), matrix factorization (Singh
and Gordon, 2008; Nickel et al., 2011; Nickel et
al., 2012) . Among existing representation mod-
els, TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) regards a relation
as translation between head and tail entities for
optimization, which achieves a good trade-off be-
tween prediction accuracy and computational effi-
ciency. All existing representation learning meth-
ods of knowledge bases only use direct relations
between entities, ignoring rich information in re-
lation paths.

Relation paths have already been widely con-
sidered in social networks and recommender sys-
tems. Most of these works regard each relation and
path as discrete symbols, and deal with them us-
ing graph-based algorithms, such as random walks
with restart (Tong et al., 2006). Relation paths
have also been used for inference on large-scale
KBs, such as Path Ranking algorithm (PRA) (Lao
and Cohen, 2010), which has been adopted for ex-
pert finding (Lao and Cohen, 2010) and informa-
tion retrieval (Lao et al., 2012). PRA has also been
used for relation extraction based on KB structure
(Lao et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2013). (Nee-
lakantan et al., 2015) further learns a recurrent
neural network (RNN) to represent unseen rela-
tion paths according to involved relations. We
note that, these methods focus on modeling rela-
tion paths for relation extraction without consid-
ering any information of entities. In contrast, by
successfully integrating the merits of modeling en-
tities and relation paths, PTransE can learn supe-
rior representations of both entities and relations
for knowledge graph completion and relation ex-
traction as shown in our experiments.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents PTransE, a novel representa-
tion learning method for KBs, which encodes re-
lation paths to embed both entities and relations

712



in a low-dimensional space. To take advantages
of relation paths, we propose path-constraint re-
source allocation to measure relation path reliabil-
ity, and employ semantic composition of relations
to represent paths for optimization. We evaluate
PTransE on knowledge base completion and re-
lation extraction from text. Experimental results
show that PTransE achieves consistent and signif-
icant improvements as compared with TransE and
other baselines.

In future, we will explore the following research
directions: (1) This paper only considers the infer-
ence patterns between direct relations and relation
paths between two entities for learning. There are
much complicated patterns among relations. For
example, the inference form Queen(e) Inference=====⇒
Female(e) cannot be handled by PTransE. We
may take advantages of first-order logic to encode
these inference patterns for representation learn-
ing. (2) There are some extensions for TransE,
e.g., TransH and TransR. It is non-trivial for them
to adopt the idea of PTransE, and we will explore
to extend PTransE to these models to better deal
with complicated scenarios of KBs.
