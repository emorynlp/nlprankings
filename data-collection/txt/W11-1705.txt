Abstract

We propose a novel method to construct se-
mantic orientation lexicons using large data
and a thesaurus. To deal with large data, we
use Count-Min sketch to store the approxi-
mate counts of all word pairs in a bounded
space of 8GB. We use a thesaurus (like Roget)
to constrain near-synonymous words to have
the same polarity. This framework can easily
scale to any language with a thesaurus and a
unzipped corpus size ≥ 50 GB (12 billion to-
kens). We evaluate these lexicons intrinsically
and extrinsically, and they perform compara-
ble when compared to other existing lexicons.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the field of natural language process-
ing (NLP) has seen tremendous growth and inter-
est in the computational analysis of emotions, sen-
timents, and opinions. This work has focused on
many application areas, such as sentiment analy-
sis of consumer reviews e.g., (Pang et al., 2002;
Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), product reputation anal-
ysis e.g., (Morinaga et al., 2002; Nasukawa and Yi,
2003), tracking sentiments toward events e.g., (Das
and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001), and automatically
producing plot unit representations e.g., (Goyal et
al., 2010b). An important resource in accomplishing
the above tasks is a list of words with semantic ori-
entation (SO): positive or negative. The goal of this
work is to automatically create such a list of words
using large data and a thesaurus structure.

For this purpose, we store exact counts of all
the words in a hash table and use Count-Min (CM)
sketch (Cormode and Muthukrishnan, 2004; Goyal
et al., 2010) to store the approximate counts of all
word pairs for a large corpus in a bounded space of

8GB. (Storing the counts of all word pairs is compu-
tationally expensive and memory intensive on large
data (Agirre et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 2009)). Stor-
age space saving in CM sketch is achieved by ap-
proximating the frequency of word pairs in the cor-
pus without explicitly storing the word pairs them-
selves. Both updating (adding a new word pair or
increasing the frequency of existing word pair) and
querying (finding the frequency of a given word
pair) are constant time operations making it an ef-
ficient online storage data structure for large data.

Once we have these counts, we find semantic
orientation (SO) (Turney and Littman, 2003) of a
word using its association strength with positive
(e.g. good, and nice) and negative (e.g., bad and
nasty) seeds. Next, we make use of a thesaurus (like
Roget) structure in which near-synonymous words
appear in a single group. We compute the SO of
the whole group by computing SO of each individ-
ual word in the group and assign that SO to all the
words in the group. The hypothesis is that near
synonym words should have similar polarity. How-
ever, similar words in a group can still have differ-
ent connotations. For example, one group has “slen-
der”, “slim”, “wiry” and “lanky”. One can argue
that, first two words have positive connotation and
last two have negative. To remove these ambigu-
ous words errors from the lexicon, we discard those
words which have conflicting SO compared to their
group SO. The idea behind using thesaurus struc-
ture is motivated from the idea of using number of
positive and negative seed words (Mohammad et al.,
2009) in thesaurus group to determine the polarity
of words in the group.

In our experiments, we show the effectiveness of
the lexicons created using large data and freely avail-

37



able thesaurus both intrinsically and extrinsically.

2 Background

2.1 Related Work

The literature on sentiment lexicon induction can be
broadly classified into three categories: (1) Corpora
based, (2) using thesaurus structure, and (3) com-
bination of (1) and (2). Pang and Lee (2008) pro-
vide an excellent survey on the literature of sen-
timent analysis. We briefly discuss some of the
works which have motivated our research for this
work. A web-derived lexicon (Velikovich et al.,
2010) was constructed for all words and phrases us-
ing graph propagation algorithm which propagates
polarity from seed words to all other words. The
graph was constructed using distributional similar-
ity between the words. The goal of their work was
to create a high coverage lexicon. In a similar direc-
tion (Rao and Ravichandran, 2009), word-net was
used to construct the graph for label propagation.
Our work is most closely related to Mohammad et
al. (2009) which exploits thesaurus structure to de-
termine the polarity of words in the thesaurus group.

2.2 Semantic Orientation

We use (Turney and Littman, 2003) framework to
infer the Semantic Orientation (SO) of a word. We
take the seven positive words (good, nice, excellent,
positive, fortunate, correct, and superior) and the
seven negative words (bad, nasty, poor, negative, un-
fortunate, wrong, and inferior) used in (Turney and
Littman, 2003) work. The SO of a given word is
calculated based on the strength of its association
with the seven positive words, and the strength of
its association with the seven negative words using
pointwise mutual information (PMI). We compute
the SO of a word ”w” as follows:

SO(w) =
∑

p∈Pwords

PMI(p, w)−
∑

n∈Nwords

PMI(n, w)

where, Pwords and Nwords denote the seven pos-
itive and seven negative prototype words respec-
tively. If this score is negative, the word is predicted
as negative. Otherwise, it is predicted as positive.

2.3 CM sketch

The Count-Min sketch (Cormode and Muthukrish-
nan, 2004) with user chosen parameters (�,δ) is

represented by a two-dimensional array with width
w and depth d. Parameters � and δ control the
amount of tolerable error in the returned count (�)
and the probability with which the returned count
is not within this acceptable error (δ) respectively.
These parameters determine the width and depth
of the two-dimensional array. We set w=2� , and
d=log(1δ ). The depth d denotes the number of
pairwise-independent hash functions and there ex-
ists an one-to-one mapping between the rows and
the set of hash functions. Each of these hash func-
tions hk:{x1 . . . xN} → {1 . . . w}, 1 ≤ k ≤ d, takes
an item from the input stream and maps it into a
counter indexed by the corresponding hash function.
For example, h3(x) = 8 indicates that the item “x”
is mapped to the 8th position in the third row of the
sketch.

Update Procedure: When a new item “x” with
count c, the sketch is updated by:

sketch[k,hk(x)]← sketch[k,hk(x)] + c, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d

Query Procedure: Since multiple items can be
hashed to the same position, the stored frequency in
any one row is guaranteed to overestimate the true
count. Thus, to answer the point query, we return
the minimum over all the positions indexed by the
k hash functions. The answer to Query(x) is: ĉ =
mink sketch[k, hk(x)].

2.4 CU sketch

The Count-Min sketch with conservative update
(CU sketch) (Goyal et al., 2010) is similar to CM
sketch except the update operation. It is based on
the idea of conservative update (Estan and Vargh-
ese, 2002) introduced in the context of networking.
It is used with CM sketch to further improve the es-
timate of a point query. To update an item, x with
frequency c, we first compute the frequency ĉ of this
item from the existing data structure and the counts
are updated according to:

ĉ = mink sketch[k,hk(x)], ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d

sketch[k,hk(x)]← max{sketch[k,hk(x)], ĉ+ c}

The intuition is that, since the point query returns
the minimum of all the d values, we will update a
counter only if it is necessary as indicated by the
above equation.

3 Generating Polarity Lexicon

Our framework to generate lexicon has three main
steps: First, we compute Semantic Orientation (SO)
of words using a formula defined in Section 2.2 us-
ing a large corpus. Second, we use a thesaurus (like
Roget) to constrain all synonym words in a group
to have the same polarity. Third, we discard words
which do not follow the above constraints. The three
steps are discussed in the following subsections.

3.1 Computing SO of a word

We use CM sketch to store counts of word pairs (ex-
cept word pairs involving stop words and numbers)
within a sliding window of size1 7 using a large cor-
pus: GWB66 of size 64GB (see Section 4.3). We
fix the number of counters of the sketch to 2 bil-
lion (2B) (8GB of memory) with conservative up-
date (CU) as it performs the best for (Goyal et al.,
2010) with d = 5 (see Section 2.3) hash functions.
We store exact counts of words in hash table.

Once, we have stored the counts for all words and
word pairs, we can compute the SO of a word using
a formula defined in Section 2.2. Moreover, a word
can have multiple senses, hence it can belong to mul-
tiple paragraphs. To assign a single label to a word,
we combine all its SO scores. We use positive SO
scores to label words as positive and negative SO to
label words as negative. We discard words with SO
equal to zero. We apply this strategy to all the words
in a thesaurus (like Roget) (refer to Section 3.2), we
call the lexicon constructed using SO scores using
thesaurus words as “SO” lexicon.

3.2 Using Thesaurus structure

Thesaurus like Roget2, Macquarie are available in
several languages. We use freely available version
of Roget thesaurus which has 1046 categories, each
containing on average 64 words and phrases. Terms
within a category are closely related to one another,
and they are further grouped into near-synonymous
words and phrases called paragraphs. There are
about 3117 paragraphs in Roget thesaurus. One
of the examples of paragraphs from the Roget the-
saurus is shown in Table 1. All the words appears to
be near-synonymous with positive polarity.

continent virtuous honest platonic virgin unsullied simonpure

Table 1: A paragraph from the Roget thesaurus

We assign semantic orientation (SO) score to a
thesaurus paragraph3 (SO(TP )) by averaging over
SO scores over all the words in it. The SO(TP )
score constrains all the words in a paragraph to have
same polarity. If SO(TP ) > 0, all the words in a
paragraph are marked as positive. If SO(TP ) < 0,
all the words in a group are marked as negative. For
SO(TP ) = 0, we discard all the words of a para-
graph. For the paragraph in Table 1, the SO(TP )
for the paragraph is 8.72. Therefore, all the words in
this paragraph are labeled as positive. However, the
SO scores for “virgin” and “decorous” are negative,
therefore they are marked as negative by previous
lexicon “SO”, however they seem to be more pos-
itive than negative. Therefore, using the structure
of the lexicon helps us in correcting the polarity of
these words to negative. We apply this strategy to all
the 3117 Roget thesaurus paragraphs and construct
“SO-TP” lexicon using SO(TP ) scores.

3.3 Words and Thesaurus Consensus

Since near-synonymous words could have different
connotation or polarity. Hence, here we use both
SO of word and SO(TP ) of its paragraph to assign
polarity to a word. If SO(w) > 0 and SO(TP ) >
0, then we mark that word as positive. If SO(w) <
0 and SO(TP ) < 0, then we mark that word as
negative. In other cases, we discard the word.

We refer to the lexicon constructed using this
strategy on Roget thesaurus paragraphs as “SO-
WTP” lexicon. The motivation behind this is to gen-
erate precision orientated lexicon by having consen-
sus over both individual and paragraph scores. For
the paragraph in Table 1, we discard words “virgin”
and “decorous” from the lexicon, as they have con-
flicting SO(w) and SO(TP ) scores. In experiments
in Section 5.2.1, we also examine existing lexicons
to constrain the polarity of thesaurus paragraphs.

4 Evaluating SO computed using sketch

We compare the accuracy of computed SO using dif-
ferent sized corpora. We also compare exact counts
with approximate counts using sketch.

3We do not assign polarity to phrases and stop words.

4.1 Data

We use Gigaword corpus (Graff, 2003) and a 66%
portion of a copy of web crawled by (Ravichan-
dran et al., 2005). For both the corpora, we split
the text into sentences, tokenize and convert into
lower-case. We generate words and word pairs over
a sliding window of size 7. We use four different
sized corpora: Gigaword (GW), GigaWord + 16%
of web data (GWB16), GigaWord + 50% of web
data (GWB50), and GigaWord + 66% of web data
(GWB66). Corpus Statistics are shown in Table 2.
We store exact counts of words in a hash table and
store approximate counts of word pairs in the sketch.

4.2 Test Set

We use General Inquirer lexicon4 (Stone et al., 1966)
as a benchmark to evaluate the semantic orientation
scores similar to (Turney and Littman, 2003) work.
Our test set consists of 1597 positive and 1980 nega-
tive words. Accuracy is used as an evaluation metric.

4.3 Effect of Increasing Corpus Size

We evaluate SO of words on four different sized
corpora (see Section 4.1): GW (9.8GB), GWB20
(22.8GB), GWB50 (49GB) and GWB66 (64GB).
First, we will fix number of counters to 2 billion
(2B) (CU-2B) as it performs the best for (Goyal
et al., 2010). Second, we will compare the CU-2B
model with the Exact over increasing corpus size.

We can make several observations from the Fig-
ure 1: • It shows that increasing the amount of data
improves the accuracy of identifying the SO of a
word. We get an absolute increase of 5.5 points
in accuracy when we add 16% Web data to Giga-
Word (GW). Adding 34% more Web data (GWB50),
gives a small increase of 1.3 points. Adding 16%

4The General Inquirer lexicon which is freely available at
http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/˜inquirer/

more Web data (GWB66), give an increase of 0.5
points. • Second, CU-2B performs as good as Ex-
act. • These results are also comparable to Turney’s
(2003) state-of-the-art work where they report an ac-
curacy of 82.84%. Note, they use a 100 billion to-
kens corpus which is larger than GWB66 (12 billion
tokens).

This experiments shows that using unzipped cor-
pus size ≥ 50 GB (12 billion tokens), we get per-
formance comparable to the state-of-the-art. Hence,
this approach is applicable for any language which
has large collection of monolingual data available
in it. Note that these results compared to best re-
sults of (Goyal et al., 2010) that is 77.11 are 4.5
points better; however in their work their goal was
to show their approach scales to large data. We sus-
pect the difference in results is due to difference in
pre-processing and choosing the window size. We
used counts from GWB66 (64GB) to generate lexi-
cons in Section 3.

5 Lexicon evaluation

We evaluate the lexicons proposed in Section 3
both intrinsically (by comparing their lexicon en-
tries against General Inquirer (GI) lexicon) and ex-
trinsically (by using them in a phrase polarity anno-
tation task). We remove stop words and phrases for
comparison from existing lexicons as our framework
does not assign polarity to them.

5.1 Intrinsic evaluation

We compare the lexicon entries of “SO”, “SO-TP” ,
and “SO-WTP” against entries of GI Lexicon. This
evaluation is similarly used by other authors (Tur-
ney and Littman, 2003; Mohammad et al., 2009) to
evaluate sentiment lexicons.

Table 3 shows the percentage of GI positive (Pos),
negative (Neg) and all (All) lexicon entries that

Lexicon (size) Pos (1597) Neg (1980) All (3577)
SO (32.2K) 0.79 0.73 0.76

S0-TP (33.1K) 0.88 0.64 0.75
SO-WTP (22.6K) 0.78 0.65 0.71

Roget-ASL (27.8K) 0.79 0.40 0.57

Table 3: The percentage of GI entries (positive, negative, and
all) that match those of the automatically generated lexicons

match the proposed lexicons. The recall of our pre-
cision orientated lexicon SO-WTP is only 5 and
4 % less compared to SO and SO-TP respectively
which are more recall oriented. We evaluate these
lexicons against Roget-ASL (discussed in Section
5.2.1). Even, Our SO-WTP precision oriented lexi-
con has more recall than Roget-ASL.

5.2 Extrinsic evaluation

In this section, we compare the effectiveness of our
lexicons on a task of phrase polarity identification.
We use the MPQA corpus which contains news ar-
ticles from a wide variety of news sources manually
annotated for opinions and other private states (like
beliefs, emotions, sentiments, speculations, etc.).
Moreover, it has polarity annotations (positive/neg-
ative) at the phrase level. We use MPQA5 version
2.0 collection of 2789 positive and 6079 negative
phrases. We perform an extrinsic evaluation of our
automatic generated lexicons (using large data and
thesaurus) against existing automated and manually
generated lexicons by using them to automatically
determine the phrase polarity. This experimental
setup is similar to Mohammad et al. (2009). How-
ever, in their work, they used MPQA version 1.0.

We use a similar algorithm as used by Mohammad
et al. (2009) to determine the polarity of the phrase.
If any of the words in the target phrase is labeled in
the lexicon as having negative SO, then the phrase is
marked as negative. If there are no negative words in
the target phrase and it contains one or more positive
words, then the phrase is marked as positive. In all
other cases, do not assign any tag.

The only difference with respect to Mohammad et
al. (2009) is that we use a list of 58 negation words
used in OpinionFinder6 (Wilson et al., 2005b) (Ver-
sion 1.4) to flip the polarity of a phrase if it contains
odd number of negation words. We can get better

accuracies on phrase polarity identification using su-
pervised classifiers (Wilson et al., 2005a). However,
the goal of this work is only to show the effective-
ness of large data and thesaurus learned lexicons.

5.2.1 Baselines
We compare our method against the following

baselines: First, MPQA Lexicon7 ((Wilson et al.,
2005a)). Second, we use Affix seed lexicon (ASL)
seeds used by Mohammad et al. (2009) to assign
labels to Roget thesaurus paragraphs. ASL was
constructed using 11 affix patterns, e.g. honest-
dishonest (X-disX pattern). If ASL matches more
positive words than negative words in a paragraph
then all the words in the paragraph are labeled as
positive. However, if ASL matches more negative
words than positive words in a paragraph, then all
words in the paragraph are labeled as negative. For
other cases, we do not assign any labels. The gen-
erated lexicon is referred as Roget (ASL). Third, we
use GI Lexicon instead of ASL and generate Roget
(GI) Lexicon. Fourth, we use ASL + GI, and gen-
erate Roget (ASL+GI) Lexicon. Fifth, MSOL8 gen-
erated by Mohammad et al. (2009) using ASL+GI
lexicon on Macquarie Thesaurus. Note that Mac-
quarie Thesaurus is not freely available and its size
is larger than the freely available Roget’s thesaurus.

5.2.2 GI seeds information with SO Lexicon
We combine the GI seed lexicon with seman-

tic orientation of word computed using large cor-
pus to mark the words positive or negative in the-
saurus paragraphs. We combine the information

from large corpus with GI in two forms: • SO+GI:
If GI matches more number of positive words than
negative words in a paragraph and SO of a word
> 0, then that word is labeled as positive. However,
if GI matches more number of negative words than
positive words in a paragraph and SO of a word< 0,
that word is labeled as negative. For other cases,
we do not assign any labels to words. • SO-TP+GI:
Here, we use SO(TP ) scores instead of SO scores
and use the same strategy as in previous bullet to
generate the lexicon.

Table 4 summarizes the size of all lexicons.
MPQA has the largest size among manually created
lexicons. It is build on top of GI Lexicon. Ro-
get (ASL) has 78% positive entries. MSOL is the
biggest lexicon and it is about 2.5 times bigger than
our precision oriented SO-WTP lexicon.

5.2.3 Results
Table 5 demonstrates the performance of the algo-

rithm (discussed in Section 5.2) when using different
lexicons. The performance of existing lexicons is
shown in the top part of the table. The performance
of large data and thesaurus lexicons is shown in the
middle of the table. The bottom of the table com-
bines GI information with large data and thesaurus.

In the first part of the Table 5, our results demon-
strate that MPQA in the first row of the table has the
best precision on this task for both positive and neg-
ative phrases. Roget (ASL) in the second row has
the best recall for positives which is double the re-
call for negatives. Hence, this indicates that ASL is
biased towards positive words. Using GI with Ro-
get gives more balanced recall for both positives and
negatives in third row. Roget (ASL+GI) are more
biased towards positive words. MSOL has the best

recall for negatives; however it comes at an expense
of equal drop in precision with respect to MPQA.

In the second part of the Table using large data,
“SO” lexicon has same F-score as MPQA with pre-
cision and recall trade-offs. Using thesaurus along
with large data has comparable F-score; however it
again gives some precision and recall trade-offs with
noticeable 6 points drop in recall for negatives. The
small decrease in F-score for SO-WTP precision-
oriented lexicon (22, 614 entries) is due to its small
size in comparison to SO lexicon (32, 202 entries).
We are currently working with a small sized freely
available thesaurus which is smaller than Macquarie,
hence MSOL performs the best.

Using GI lexicon in bottom part of the Table, we
incorporate another form of information, which pro-
vides overall better precision than SO, SO-TP, and
SO-WTP approaches. Even for languages, where
we have only large amounts of data available, “SO”
can be beneficial. If we have thesaurus available for
a language, it can be combined with large data to
produce precision oriented lexicons.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

We constructed lexicons automatically using large
data and a thesaurus and evaluated its quality both
intrinsically and extrinsically. This framework can
easily scale to any language with a thesaurus and
a unzipped corpus size of ≥ 50 GB (12 billion to-
kens). However, if a language does not have the-
saurus, word similarity between words can be used
to generate word clusters. Currently we are explor-
ing using word clusters instead of using thesaurus
in our framework. Moreover, if a language does
not have large collection of data, we like to explore
bilingual lexicons to compute semantic orientation
of a word in another language. Another promising
direction would be to explore the idea of word simi-
larity combined with CM sketch (stores the approx-
imate counts of all word pairs in a bounded space of
8GB) in graph propagation setting without explicitly
representing the graph structure between words.
