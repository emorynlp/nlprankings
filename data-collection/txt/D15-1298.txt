Abstract

This paper presents a new method to iden-
tify sentiment of an aspect of an entity. It
is an extension of RNN (Recursive Neu-
ral Network) that takes both dependency
and constituent trees of a sentence into ac-
count. Results of an experiment show that
our method significantly outperforms pre-
vious methods.

1 Introduction

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been
found to play a significant role in many applica-
tions such as opinion mining on product or restau-
rant reviews. It is a task to determine an attitude,
opinion and emotions of people toward aspects in
a sentence. For example, given a sentence “Except
the design, the phone is bad for me”, the system
should classify positive and negative as the senti-
ments for the aspects ‘design’ and ‘phone’, respec-
tively.

The simple approach is to calculate a sentiment
score of a given aspect as the weighted sum of
opinion scores, which are defined by a sentiment
lexicon, of all words in the sentence (Liu and
Zhang, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). This method is
further improved by identifying the aspect-opinion
relations using tree kernel method (Nguyen and
Shirai, 2015a).

Other researches have attempted to use unsuper-
vised topic modeling methods. To identify the sen-
timent category of the aspect, topic models which
can simultaneously exploit aspect and sentiment
have been proposed, such as TSLDA (Nguyen and
Shirai, 2015b), ASUM (Jo and Oh, 2011), JST
(Lin and He, 2009) and FACTS model (Lakkaraju
et al., 2011).

Recursive Neural Network (RNN) is a kind of
deep neural network. Using distributed represen-
tations of words (aka word embedding) (Bengio et

al., 2003; Hinton, 1986), RNN merges word rep-
resentations to represent phrases or sentences. It
is one of the best methods to predict sentiment la-
bels for the phrases (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et
al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013). AdaRNN (Adap-
tive Recursive Neural Network) is an extension of
RNN for Twitter sentiment classification (Dong et
al., 2014a; Dong et al., 2014b).

This paper proposes a new method PhraseRNN
for ABSA. It is an extended model of RNN and
AdaRNN, which are briefly introduced in Section
2. The basic idea is to make the representation of
the target aspect richer by using syntactic infor-
mation from both the dependency and constituent
trees of the sentence.

2 Recursive Neural Networks for ABSA

In RNN and AdaRNN, given a sentence contain-
ing a target aspect, “binary dependency tree” is
built from a dependency tree of the sentence. Intu-
itively, it represents syntactic relations associated
with the aspect. Each word (leaf) or phrase (inter-
nal node) in the binary dependency tree is repre-
sented as a d-dimensional vector. From bottom to
up, the representations of a parent node v is calcu-
lated by combination of left and right child vector
representations (vl and vr) using a global function
g in RNN:

g(vl, vr) = W
[
vl
vr

]
+ b (1)

where W ∈ <d×2d is the composition matrix and
b ∈ <d is the bias vector. Then v = f(g(vl, vr))
where f is a nonlinear function such as tanh.

Instead of using only a global function g,
AdaRNN employed n compositional functions
G = {g1, · · · , gn} and selected them depending
on the linguistic tags and combined vectors as fol-
lows:

v = f

(
n∑
i=1

P (gi|vl, vr, e)gi(vl, vr)
)

(2)

where P (gi|vl, vr, e) is the probability of function
gi given the child vectors vl, vr and external fea-
ture vector e. The probabilities are estimated as

P (gn|vl, vr, e)

 = softmax
βR

 vlvr


(3)

where β ∈ < is a hyper-parameter, and R ∈
<n×(2d+|e|) is the parameter matrix.

The vector of the root node of the binary depen-
dency tree is regarded as a representation of the
target aspect. It is fed to a logistic regression to
predict the sentiment category of the aspect.

3 PhraseRNN: Phrase Recursive Neural
Network

In this model, a representation of an aspect will be
obtained from a “target dependent binary phrase
dependency tree” constructed by combining the
constituent and dependency trees. In addition, in-
stead of using a list of global functions G as in
AdaRNN, two kinds of composition functions G
in inner-phrase and H in outer-phrase are used.

3.1 Building Hierarchical Structure
First, the basic phrases (noun phrases, verb
phrases, preposition phrases and so on) are ex-
tracted from the constituent tree of the sentence.
For example, a list of phrases P = {PP[Except the
design], NP[the phone], VP[is bad for me]} is ex-
tracted from the constituent tree in Figure 1.

Given a dependency tree and a list of phrases,
a phrase dependency tree is created by Algorithm
1. The input is a dependency tree T = (V,E)
consisting of a set of vertices V = {v1, · · · , v|V |}
and a set of relation edges E = {(rji, vi, vj)}
between two vertices, and a list of phrases P =
{p1, · · · , pK} extracted from the constituent tree.
The output is a phrase dependency tree pT =

(pV, pE) where pV = {T1, · · · , TK} (Ti =
(Vi, Ei) is a subtree) and pE = {(rji, Ti, Tj)} (a
set of relations between two subtrees). With the
dependency tree and the phrase list in Figure 2(a),
the algorithm will output a phrase dependency tree
in Figure 2(b).

Algorithm 1: Convert to Phrase Dependency
Tree
Input: dependency tree T = (V,E), phrase

list P = {p1, · · · , pK}
Output: phrase dependency tree:

pT = (pV, pE) where
pV = {T1, · · · , TK}, Ti = (Vi, Ei)
and pE = {(rji, Ti, Tj)}

1 for each phrase pi ∈ P do
2 Vi ← {vj |vj ∈ pi}
3 end
4 for each edge (rnm, vm, vn) ∈ E do
5 vm ∈ pk, vn ∈ pl
6 if k = l then
7 Ek ← Ek ∪ {(rnm, vm, vn)}
8 else
9 pE ← pE ∪ {(rnm, Tk, Tl)}

10 end
11 end

The phrase dependency tree is transformed into
a target dependent binary phrase dependency tree
bpT by Algorithm 2. The input of the algorithm
is a phrase dependency tree pT = (pV, pE) and a
target word vt (the aspect word we want to predict
the sentiment category). The output is the binary
tree bpT . Note that the leaves of the binary tree
bpT are binary subtrees bT1, · · · , bTK which are
the binary versions of subtrees T1, · · · , TK . On
the other hand, the leaves of binary subtree bTi are
the words in phrase pi. bpT and bTi are obtained
by convert function defined as Algorithm 3. It can
convert an arbitrary tree to a binary tree 1. Figure
2(c) and Figure 3 show the outputs for the aspect
‘design’ and ’phone’, respectively.

3.2 Constructing the Aspect Representation

Each node in the binary tree is represented as a d-
dimensional vector. In this research, we use the
pre-trained Google News dataset 2 by word2vec
algorithms (Mikolov et al., 2013). Each word is

1Note that convert function returns a tree represented by
nested brackets such as [PP,[NP,VP]].

Algorithm 2: Convert to Target Dependent Bi-
nary Phrase Dependency Tree
Input: phrase dependency tree:

pT = (pV, pE), target vt
Output: target dependent binary phrase

dependency tree: bpT
1 for Ti = (Vi, Ei) ∈ pV do
2 if vt ∈ Vi then
3 h← vt
4 else
5 h← vertex having no head in Ei
6 end
7 bTi ← convert(Ei, h)
8 end
9 Tvt ← Ti that contains vt

10 bpT ← convert(pE, Tvt)
11 Replace all Ti in bpT with bTi

2 v ← vt
3 for vi → vt, vt → vi in E do
4 if vt → vi then
5 E′ ← E \ {vt → vi}
6 w ← [convert(E, vi), v]
7 else
8 E′ ← E \ {vi → vt}
9 w ← [v, convert(E, vi)]

10 end
11 v ← w
12 end
13 return v
14 end

Figure 3: Another Target Dependent Binary
Phrase Dependency Tree (Target Aspect ‘phone’)

represented as a 300-dimensional vector in this
pre-trained dataset.

PhraseRNN uses two kinds of composition
function G = {g1, · · · , gn} for inner-phrase and
H = {h1, · · · , hm} for outer-phrase. n and m are
the number of functions in G and H , respectively.

The vector of the parent node vin in the binary
subtree bTi, where vl and vr are the vectors of the
left and right children, is computed as:

vin = f

(
n∑
i=1

P (gi|vl, vr, ein)gi(vl, vr)
)

(4)

where ein is the external feature vector.
P (gi|vl, vr, ein) is the probability of function
gi given the child vectors vl, vr and ein. It is

defined as Equation (5). P (g1|vl, vr, ein)· · ·
P (gn|vl, vr, ein)

 = softmax
βR

 vlvr
ein


(5)

where β ∈ < is a hyper-parameter, and R ∈
<n×(2d+|ein|) is the parameter matrix.

In the target dependent binary phrase depen-
dency tree bpT , the vector of the parent node vout,
where the vectors of the left and right children are
vl and vr, is computed as:

vout = f

(
m∑
i=1

P (hi|vl, vr, eout)hi(vl, vr)
)

(6)

P (hi|vl, vr, eout) is the probability of function hi
given the child vectors vl, vr and external feature
vector eout as shown in Equation (7). P (h1|vl, vr, eout)· · ·
P (hm|vl, vr, eout)

 = softmax
βS

 vlvr
eout


(7)

where S ∈ <m×(2d+|eout|) is the parameter matrix.
The external features ei (ein and eout) of the

node vi consists of three types of features: Labell,
Labelr and DepTypei. Labell and Labelr are
the labels of the left and right child nodes, respec-
tively. If node vl is a leaf word, Labell is the POS
of the word vl. Otherwise, it is the non-terminal
symbol of the lowest common parent of descen-
dants of vl in the constituent tree. For example,
the Label of the node combined from ‘the’ and
‘design’ in Figure 2(c) is ‘NP’ which is the low-
est common parent of these two words in the con-
stituent tree in Figure 1. DepTypei is the depen-
dency relation for node vi. If the left and right
children of vi are leaf nodes, it is the direct relation
in the dependency tree between them. Otherwise,
DepTypei is the relation between head words of
the left and right nodes. For instance, in Figure
2(c), let a be the parent of ‘is’ and ‘bad’, b is the
parent of ‘for’ and ‘me’, c is the parent of a and b.
DepType of a and b are ‘COP’ and ‘POBJ’ that
are direct relations between two child nodes in the
dependency tree in Figure 2(a). While, DepType
of c is ‘PREP’ that is the dependency relation be-
tween two head words ‘bad’ and ‘for’. ei is a bi-
nary vector where the weight of the vector repre-
sents the presence of each feature.

We suppose a batch training data consist-
ing ofB instances {(x(1), t(1)), · · · , (x(B), t(B))},

where x(b) and t(b) are the aspect and its sentiment
category of b-th instance. Let y(b) be the predicted
sentiment category for aspect x(b) by PhraseRNN.
The goal is to minimize the loss function which is
the sum of the mean of negative log likelihood and
L2 regularization penalty in a batch training set as
in Equation (8).

L = − 1B
B∑
b=1

log(P (y(b) = t(b)|x(b), θ)) + λ ∑
θi∈θ
‖ θi ‖2

(8)
where λ is a constant controlling the degree of
penalty, θ is all the parameters in the model.

Stochastic gradient descent is used to optimize
the loss function. Backpropagation is employed to
propagate the errors from the top node to the leaf
nodes. The derivatives of parameters are used to
update the parameters.

4 Evaluation

We use the restaurant reviews dataset in Se-
mEval2014 Task 4 consisting of over 3000 English
sentences. For each aspect, “positive”, “negative”
or “neutral” is annotated as its polarity. Dataset is
divided into three parts: 70% training, 10% devel-
opment and 20% test.

We compare the following methods:
ASA w/o RE: It defines a sentiment score of a

given aspect as the weighted sum of opinion scores
of all words in the sentence, where the weight is
defined by the distance from the aspect (Liu and
Zhang, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008).

ASA with RE: It improves “ASA w/o RE” by
firstly identifying the aspect-opinion relations us-
ing tree kernel, then integrating them to the senti-
ment calculation (Nguyen and Shirai, 2015a).

RNN: It uses only one global function g1 over
the binary dependency tree.

AdaRNN: It uses multi-composition functions
G = {g1, · · · , gn} over a binary dependency tree
(Dong et al., 2014a).

PhraseRNN-1: our PhraseRNN with only one
global function: G = H = g1

PhraseRNN-2: our PhraseRNN with two
global functions. One for inner-phrase, the other
for outer-phrase: G = g1 and H = h1

PhraseRNN-3: our PhraseRNN with multiple
global functions: G = H = {g1, · · · , gn}

PhraseRNN-4: our PhraseRNN with two lists
of global functions. One for inner-phrase, the
other for outer-phrase: G = {g1, · · · , gn} and
H = {h1, · · · , hm}

Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) is
used to parse the sentence and obtain constituent
and dependency trees. For RNN, AdaRNN and
PhraseRNN, the optimal parameters, which mini-
mize the error in the development set, are used for
the sentiment classification of the test set. We set
β = 1 for AdaRNN and PhraseRNN since it is re-
ported that β = 1 is the best parameter (Dong et
al., 2014a). The optimized number of composition
functions n andm = n2 are selected by grid search
with n = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} on the development set.
λ = 0.0001 is employed. Accuracy (A), Preci-
sion (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F) are used as
evaluation metrics 3.

Table 1 shows the results of the methods. Dif-
ferences of PhraseRNN and RNN are verified by
statistical significance tests. We use the paired
randomization test because it does not require
additional assumption about distribution of out-
puts (Smucker et al., 2007). The results indi-
cate that four variations of our PhraseRNN out-
perform “ASA w/o RE”, “ASA with RE”, RNN
and AdaRNN methods from 5.35% to 19.44% ac-
curacy and 8% to 16.48% F-measure. Among
four variations, PhraseRNN-2 and PhraseRNN-
3 achieved the best performance. By using dif-
ferent global functions in the inner and outer
phrases, PhraseRNN-2 improves PhraseRNN-1 by
2.54% F-measure while keeping the comparable
accuracy. Using multi-composition functions is
also effective since PhraseRNN-3 was better than
PhraseRNN-1 by 1.55% accuracy. PhraseRNN-4
improved PhraseRNN-3 by 6.38% precision while
keeping comparable in other metrics.

Since our PhraseRNN-1 and PhraseRNN-3 out-
perform RNN and AdaRNN (the models rely-
ing on the binary dependency tree) respectively,
we can conclude that our target dependent binary
phrase dependency tree is much effective than bi-
nary dependency tree for ABSA.

In the data used in (Dong et al., 2014a), one sen-
tence contains only one aspect. On the other hand,
two or more aspects can be appeared in one sen-
tence in SemEval 2014 data. It is common in the
real text. To examine in which cases our method is
better than the others, we conduct an additional ex-
periment by dividing the test set into three disjoint
subsets. The first subset (S1) contains sentences
having only one aspect. The second subset (S2)

3Precision, Recall and F-measure are the average for three
polarity categories weighted by the number of true instances.

and third subset (S3) have two or more aspects in
each sentence. All aspects in a sentence in S2 have
the same sentiment category, while different sen-
timent categories in S3. The number of aspects in
S1, S2 and S3 are 200, 323 and 187, respectively.

Table 2 shows the number of aspects where their
sentiments are correctly identified by the methods
in the subsets S1, S2 and S3. The accuracies are
also shown in parentheses. Among three subsets,
S3 is the most difficult and ambiguous case. In all
methods, the performance in S3 is worse than S1
and S2. Comparing with other methods in each
subset, PhraseRNN improves the accuracy in S2
more than in S1 and S3.

5 Conclusion

We proposed PhraseRNN to identify the sentiment
of the aspect in the sentence. Propagating the
semantics through the binary dependency tree in
RNN and AdaRNN could not be enough to rep-
resent the sentiment of the aspect. A new hierar-
chical structure was constructed by integrating the
dependency relations and phrases. The results in-
dicated that our PhraseRNN outperformed “ASA
w/o RE”, “ASA with RE”, RNN and AdaRNN.
