Abstract

We present a method for incorporat-
ing arbitrary context-informed word at-
tributes into statistical machine trans-
lation by clustering attribute-quali�ed
source words, and smoothing their
word translation probabilities using bi-
nary decision trees. We describe two
ways in which the decision trees are
used in machine translation: by us-
ing the attribute-quali�ed source word
clusters directly, or by using attribute-
dependent lexical translation probabil-
ities that are obtained from the trees,
as a lexical smoothing feature in the de-
coder model. We present experiments
using Arabic-to-English newswire data,
and using Arabic diacritics and part-of-
speech as source word attributes, and
show that the proposed method im-
proves on a state-of-the-art translation
system.

1 Introduction

Modern statistical machine translation (SMT)
models, such as phrase-based SMT or hierar-
chical SMT, implicitly incorporate source lan-
guage context. It has been shown, however,
that such systems can still bene�t from the
explicit addition of lexical, syntactic or other
kinds of context-informed word features (Vick-
rey et al., 2005; Gimpel and Smith, 2008;
Brunning et al., 2009; Devlin, 2009). But the
bene�t obtained from the addition of attribute
information is in general countered by the in-
crease in the model complexity, which in turn
results in a sparser translation model when es-
timated from the same corpus of data. The
increase in model sparsity usually results in a
deterioration of translation quality.

In this paper, we present a method for using
arbitrary types of source-side context-informed
word attributes, using binary decision trees to
deal with the sparsity side-e�ect. The deci-
sion trees cluster attribute-dependent source
words by reducing the entropy of the lexi-
cal translation probabilities. We also present
another method where, instead of clustering
the attribute-dependent source words, the de-
cision trees are used to interpolate attribute-
dependent lexical translation probability mod-
els, and use those probabilities to compute a
feature in the decoder log-linear model.

The experiments we present in this paper
were conducted on the translation of Arabic-
to-English newswire data using a hierarchical
system based on (Shen et al., 2008), and using
Arabic diacritics (see section 2.3) and part-of-
speech (POS) as source word attributes. Pre-
vious work that attempts to use Arabic dia-
critics in machine translation runs against the
sparsity problem, and appears to lose most of
the useful information contained in the dia-
critics when using partial diacritization (Diab
et al., 2007). Using the methods proposed
in this paper, we manage to obtain consistent
improvements from diacritics against a strong
baseline. The methods we propose, though,
are not restrictive to Arabic-to-English trans-
lation. The same techniques can also be used
with other language pairs and arbitrary word
attribute types. The attributes we use in the
described experiments are local; but long dis-
tance features can also be used.

In the next section, we review relevant pre-
vious work in three areas: Lexical smoothing
and lexical disambiguation techniques in ma-
chine translation; using decision trees in nat-
ural language processing, and especially ma-
chine translation; and Arabic diacritics. We
present a brief exposition of Arabic orthogra-

428



phy, and refer to previous work on automatic
diacritization of Arabic text. Section 3 de-
scribes the procedure for constructing the deci-
sion trees, and the two methods for using them
in machine translation. In section 4 we de-
scribe the experimental setup and present ex-
perimental results. Finally, section 5 concludes
the paper and discusses future directions.

2 Previous Work

2.1 Lexical Disambiguation and

Lexical Smoothing

Various ways have been proposed to improve
the lexical translation choices of SMT systems.
These approaches typically incorporate local
context information, either directly or indi-
rectly.

The use of Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) has been proposed to enhance ma-
chine translation by disambiguating the source
words (Cabezas and Resnick, 2005; Carpuat
and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007). WSD
usually requires that the training data be la-
beled with senses, which might not be avail-
able for many languages. Also, WSD is tra-
ditionally formulated as a classi�cation prob-
lem, and therefore does not naturally lend it-
self to be integrated into the generative frame-
work of machine translation. Carpuat and Wu
(2007) formulate the SMT lexical disambigua-
tion problem as a WSD task. Instead of learn-
ing from word sense corpora, they use the SMT
training data, and use local context features to
enhance the lexical disambiguation of phrase-
based SMT.

Sarikaya et al. (2007) incorporate context
more directly by using POS tags on the target
side to model word context. They augmented
the target words with POS tags of the word
itself and its surrounding words, and used the
augmented words in decoding and for language
model rescoring. They reported gains on Iraqi-
Arabic-to-English translation.

Finally, using word-to-word context-free lex-
ical translation probabilities has been shown
to improve the performance of machine trans-
lation systems, even those using much more
sophisticated models. This feature, usually
called lexical smoothing, has been used in
phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003).
Och et al. (2004) also found that including

IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) word prob-
abilities in their log-linear model works better
than most other higher-level syntactic features
at improving the baseline. The incorporation
of context on the source or target side en-
hances the gain obtained from lexical smooth-
ing. Gimpel and Smith (2008) proposed us-
ing source-side lexical features in phrase-based
SMT by conditioning the phrase probabilities
on those features. They used word context,
syntactic features or positional features. The
features were added as components into the
log-linear decoder model, each with a tunable
weight. Devlin (2009) used context lexical fea-
tures in a hierarchical SMT system, interpolat-
ing lexical counts based on multiple contexts.
It also used target-side lexical features.
The work in the paper incorporates con-

text information based on the reduction of the
translation probability entropy.

2.2 Decision Trees

Decision trees have been used extensively in
various areas of machine learning, typically
as a way to cluster patterns in order to im-
prove classi�cation (Duda et al., 2000). They
have, for instance, been long used success-
fully in speech recognition to cluster context-
dependent phoneme model states (Young et
al., 1994).
Decision trees have also been used in ma-

chine translation, although to a lesser extent.
In this respect, our work is most similar to
(Brunning et al., 2009), where the authors ex-
tended word alignment models for IBM Model
1 and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) align-
ments. They used decision trees to cluster the
context-dependent source words. Contexts be-
longing to the same cluster were grouped to-
gether during Expectation Maximization (EM)
training, thus providing a more robust proba-
bility estimate. While Brunning et al. (2009)
used the source context clusters for word align-
ments, we use the attribute-dependent source
words directly in decoding. The approach we
propose can be readily used with any align-
ment model.
Stroppa et al. (2007) presented a general-

ization of phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al.,
2003) that also takes into account source-
side context information. They conditioned
the target phrase probability on the source

429



phrase as well as source phrase context, such
as bordering words, or part-of-speech of bor-
dering words. They built a decision tree for
each source phrase extracted from the train-
ing data. The branching of the tree nodes
was based on the di�erent context features,
branching on the most class-discriminative fea-
tures �rst. Each node is associated with the
set of aligned target phrases and correspond-
ing context-conditioned probabilities. The de-
cision tree thus smoothes the phrase probabil-
ities based on the di�erent features, allowing
the model to back o� to less context, or no
context at all depending on the presence of
that context-dependent source phrase in the
training data. The model, however, did not
provide for a back-o� mechanism if the phrase
pair was not found in the extracted phrase ta-
ble. The method presented in this paper di�ers
in various aspects. We use context-dependent
information at the source word level, rather
than the phrase level, thus making it readily
applicable to any translation model and not
just phrase-based translation. By incorporat-
ing context at the word level, we can decode
directly with attribute-augmented source data
(see section 3.2).

2.3 Arabic Diacritics

Since an important part of the experiments
described in this paper use diacritized Arabic
source, we present a brief description of Arabic
orthography, and speci�cally diacritics.

The Arabic script, like that of most other
Semitic languages, only represents consonants
and long vowels using letters 1. Short vowels
can be written as small marks written above
or below the preceding consonant, called di-
acritics. The diacritics are, however, omit-
ted from written text, except in special cases,
thus creating an additional level of lexical am-
biguity. Readers can usually guess the cor-
rect pronunciation of words in non-diacritized
text from the sentence and discourse context.
Grammatical case on nouns and adjectives are
also marked using diacritics at the end of
words. Arabic MT systems use undiacritized
text, since most available Arabic data is undi-
acritized.

1Such writing systems are sometimes referred to as
Abjads (See Daniels, Peter T., et al. eds. The World's
Writing Systems Oxford. (1996), p.4.)

Automatic diacritization of Arabic has been
done with high accuracy, using various genera-
tive and discriminative modeling techniques.
For example, Ananthakrishnan et al. (2005)
used a generative model that incorporates
word level n-grams, sub-word level n-grams
and part-of-speech information to perform di-
acritization. Nelken and Shieber (2005) mod-
eled the generative process of dropping dia-
critics using weighted transducers, then used
Viterbi decoding to �nd the most likely gener-
ator. Zitouni et al. (2006) presented a method
based on maximum entropy classi�ers, us-
ing features like character n-grams, word n-
grams, POS and morphological segmentation.
Habash and Rambow (2007) determined vari-
ous morpho-syntactic features of the word us-
ing SVM classi�ers, then chose the correspond-
ing diacritization. The experiments in this
paper use the automatic diacritizer by Sakhr
Software. The diacritizer determines word di-
acritics through rule-based morphological and
syntactic analysis. It outputs a diacritization
for both the internal stem and case ending
markers of the word, with an accuracy of 97%
for stem diacritization and 91% for full dia-
critization (i.e., including case endings).

There has been work done on using dia-
critics in Automatic Speech Recognition, e.g.
(Vergyri and Kirchho�, 2004). However, the
only previous work on using diacritization for
MT is (Diab et al., 2007), which used the di-
acritization system described in (Habash and
Rambow, 2007). It investigated the e�ect
of using full diacritization as well as partial
diacritization on MT results. The authors
found that using full diacritics deteriorates MT
performance. They used partial diacritiza-
tion schemes, such as diacritizing only passive
verbs, keeping the case endings diacritics, or
only gemination diacritics. They also saw no
gain in most con�gurations. The authors ar-
gued that the deterioration in performance is
caused by the increase in the size of the vo-
cabulary, which in turn makes the translation
model sparser; as well as by errors during the
automatic diacritization process.

3 Decision Trees for Source Word

Attributes

3.1 Growing the Decision Tree

In this section, we describe the procedure
for growing the decision trees using context-
informed source word attributes.
The attribute-quali�ed source-side of the

parallel training data is �rst aligned to the
target-side data. If S is the set of attribute-
dependent forms of source word s, and tj is a
target word aligned to si ∈ S, then we de�ne:

p (tj |si) = count(si,tj)count(si) (1)

where count(si, tj) is the count of alignment
links between si and tj .
A separate binary decision tree is grown for

each source word. We start by including all the
attribute-dependent forms of the source word
at the root of the tree. We split the set of at-
tributes at each node into two child nodes, by
choosing the splitting that maximizes the re-
duction in weighted entropy of the probability
distribution in (1). In other words, at node n,
we choose the partition (S?1 , S

?
2) such that:

(S?1 , S
?
2) =

argmax
(S1,S2)

S1∪S2=S

{h(S)− (h(S1) + h(S2))}
(2)

where h(S) is the entropy of the probabil-
ity distribution p(tj |si ∈ S), weighted by the
number of samples in the training data of the
source words in S. We only split a node if the
entropy is reduced by more than a threshold
θh. This step is repeated recursively until the
tree cannot be grown anymore.
Weighting the entropy by the source word

counts gives more weight to the context-
dependent source words with a higher number
of samples in the training data, sine the lex-
ical translation probability estimates for fre-
quent words can be trusted better. The ratio-
nale behind the splitting criterion used is that
the split that reduces the entropy of the lexical
translation probability distribution the most
is also the split that best separates the list of
forms of the source word in terms of the target
word translation. For a source word that has
multiple meanings, depending on its context,

the decision tree will tend to implicitly sepa-
rate those meanings using the information in
the lexical translation probabilities.
Although we describe this method as grow-

ing one decision tree for each word, and using
one attribute type at a time, a decision tree
can clearly be constructed for multiple words,
and more than one attribute type can be used
in the same decision tree.

3.2 Trees for Source Word Clustering

The source words could be augmented to ex-
plicitly incorporate the word attributes (dia-
critics or other attribute types). The aug-
mented source will be less ambiguous if the
attributes do in fact contain disambiguating
information. This, in principle, helps machine
translation performance. The �ip side is that
the resulting increase in vocabulary size in-
creases the translation model sparsity, usually
with a detrimental e�ect on translation.
To mitigate the e�ect of the increase in vo-

cabulary, decision trees can be use to cluster
the attribute-augmented source words. More
speci�cally, a decision tree is grown for each
source word as described in the previous sec-
tion, using a prede�ned entropy threshold θh.
When the tree cannot be expanded anymore,
its leaf nodes will contain a multi-set parti-
tioning of the list of attribute-dependent forms
of that source word. Each of the clusters is
treated as an equivalence class, and all forms
in that class are mapped to a unique form (e.g.
an arbitrarily chosen member of the cluster).
The mappings are used to map the tokens in
the parallel training data before alignment is
run on the mapped data. The test data is
also mapped consistently. This clustering pro-
cedure will only keep the attribute-dependent
forms of the source words that decrease the un-
certainty in the translation probabilities, and
are thus useful for translation.
The experiments we report on use diacritics

as an attribute type. The various diacritized
forms of a source word are thus used to train
the decision trees. The resulting clusters are
used to map the data into a subset of the vo-
cabulary that is used in translation training
and decoding (see section 4.2 for results). Di-
acritics are obviously speci�c to Arabic. But
this method can be used with other attribute
types, by �rst appending the source words with

their context (e.g. attach to each source word
its part-of-speech tag or context), and then
training decision trees and mapping the source
side of the data.
Figure 1 shows an example of a decision

tree for the Arabic word sjn2 using diacritics
as a source attribute. The root contains the
various diacritized forms (sijona `prison AC-
CUSATIVE', sijoni `prison DATIVE', sajona

`imprisonment ACCUSATIVE.', sajoni `im-

prisonment ACCUSATIVE.', sajana `he im-

prisoned '). The leaf nodes contain the
attribute-dependent clusters.

3.3 Trees for Lexical Smoothing

As mentioned in section 2.1, lexical smoothing,
computed from word-to-word translation prob-
abilities, is a useful feature, even in SMT sys-
tems that use sophisticated translation mod-
els. This is likely due to the robustness of
context-free word-to-word translation proba-
bility estimates compared to the probabilities
of more complicated models. In those models,
the rules and probabilities are estimated from
much larger sample spaces.
In our system, the lexical smoothing feature

is computed as follows:

f(U)=
∏

tj∈T (U)

(
1−

∏
si∈{S(U)∪NULL}

(1−p̄(tj |si))
)

(3)

where U is the modeling unit speci�c to the
translation model used. For a phrase-based
system, U is the phrase pair, and for a hierar-
chical system U is the translation rule. S (U)

ation.

is the set of terminals on the source side of U,
and T (U) is the set of terminals on its tar-
get. The NULL term in the equation above
accounts for unaligned target words, which we
found in our experiments to be bene�cial. One
way of interpreting equation (3) is that f (U)
is the probability that for each target word tj
in U, tj is a likely translation of at least one
word si on the source side. The feature value
is then used as a component in the log-linear
model, with a tunable weight.

In this work, we generalize the lexical
smoothing feature to incorporate the source
word attributes. A tree is grown for each
source word as described in section 3.1, but
using an entropy threshold θh = 0. In other
words, the tree is grown all the way until each
leaf node contains one attribute-dependent
form of the source word. Each node in the
tree contains a cluster of attribute-dependent
forms of the source word, and a corresponding
attribute-dependent lexical translation prob-
ability distribution. The lexical translation
probability models at the root nodes are those
of the regular attribute-independent lexical
translation probabilities. The models at the
leaf nodes are the most �ne-grained, since they
are conditioned on only one attribute value.
Figure 2 shows a fully grown decision tree for
the same source word as the example in Figure
1.

The lexical probability distribution at the
leafs are from sparser data than the original
distributions, and are therefore less robust. To
address this, the attribute-dependent lexical

432



smoothing feature is estimated by recursively
interpolating the lexical translation probabil-
ities up the tree. The probability distribu-
tion pn at each node n is interpolated with
the probability of its parent node as follows:

pn =

{
pn if n is root,
wnpn + (1− wn)pm otherwise

where m is the parent of n
(4)

A fraction of the parent probability mass is
thus given to the probability of the child node.
If the probability estimate of an attribute-
dependent form of a source word with a cer-
tain target word t is not reliable, or if the
probability estimate is 0 (because the source
word in this context is not aligned with t),
then the model gracefully backs o� by using
the probability estimates from other attribute-
dependent lexical translation probability mod-
els of the source word.
The interpolation weight is a logistic regres-

sion function of the source word count at a
node n:

wn =
1

1 + e−α−β log(count(Sn))
(5)

The weight varies depending on the count
of the attribute-quali�ed source word in each
node, thus re�ecting the con�dence in the es-
timates of each node's distribution. The two
global parameters of the function, a bias α and
a scale β are tuned to maximize the likelihood
of a set of alignment counts from a heldout
data set of 179K sentences. The tuning is done
using Powell's method (Brent, 1973).
During decoding, we use the probability dis-

tribution at the leaves to compute the feature
value f(R) for each hierarchical rule R. We
train and decode using the regular, attribute-
independent source. The source word at-
tributes are used in the decoder only to in-
dex the interpolated probability distribution
needed to compute f (R).

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Setup

As mentioned before, the experiments we re-
port on use a string-to-dependency-tree hier-
archical translation system based on the model
described in (Shen et al., 2008). Forward and

backward context-free lexical smoothing are
used as decoder features in all the experiments.
Other features such as rule probabilities and
dependency tree language model (Shen et al.,
2008) are also used. We use GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) for word alignments. The de-
coder model parameters are tuned using Mini-
mum Error Rate training (Och, 2003) to max-
imize the IBM BLEU score (Papineni et al.,
2002).

For training the alignments, we use 27M
words from the Sakhr Arabic-English Paral-
lel Corpus (SSUSAC27). The language model
uses 7B words from the English Gigaword and
from data collected from the web. A 3-gram
language model is used during decoding. The
decoder produces an N-best list that is re-
ranked using a 5-gram language model.

We tune and test on two separate data sets
consisting of documents from the following col-
lections: the newswire portion of NIST MT04,
MT05, MT06, and MT08 evaluation sets, the
GALE Phase 1 (P1) and Phase 2 (P2) evalu-
ation sets, and the GALE P2 and P3 develop-
ment sets. The tuning set contains 1994 sen-
tences and the test set contains 3149 sentences.
The average length of sentences is 36 words.
Most of the documents in the two data sets
have 4 reference translations, but some have
only one. The average number of reference
translations per sentence is 3.94 for the tun-
ing set and 3.67 for the test set.

In the next section, we report on measure-
ments of the likelihood of test data, and de-
scribe the translation experiments in detail.

on unseen data, we compute the likelihood
of the test data with respect to these prob-
abilities with and without the decision tree
splitting. We align the test set with its ref-
erence using GIZA++, and then obtain the
link count l_count(si, tj) for each alignment
link i = (si,ti) in the set of alignment links I.
We calculate the normalized likelihood of the
alignments:

) 1
|I|


=

|I|
∑
i∈I

l_count(si, ti) log p̄ (ti | si) (6)

where p̄ (ti | si) is the probability for the word
pair (ti, si) in equation (4). If the same in-
stance of source word si is aligned to two tar-
get words ti and tj , then these two links are
counted separately. If a source in the test set
is out-of-vocabulary, or if a word pair (ti, si)
is aligned in the test alignment but not in the
training alignments (and thus has no probabil-
ity estimate), then it is ignored in the calcula-
tion of the log-likelihood.
Table 1 shows the likelihood for the baseline

case, where one lexical translation probability
distribution is used per source word. It also
shows the likelihoods calculated using the lex-
ical distributions in the leaf nodes of the de-
cision trees, when either diacritics or part-of-
speech are used as an attribute type. The table
shows an increase in the likelihood of 2.98% us-
ing diacritics, and 3.41% using part-of-speech.

BLEU. The reader is reminded that a higher
BLEU score and a lower TER are desired. The
tables also show the di�erence in scores be-
tween the baseline and each experiment. It is
worth noting that the gains reported are rela-
tive to a strong baseline that uses a state-of-
the-art system with many features, and a fairly
large training corpus.

The decision tree clustering experiment as
described in section 3.2 depends on a global
parameter, namely the threshold in entropy re-
duction θh. We tune this parameter manually
on a tuning set. Figure 3 shows the BLEU
scores as a function of the threshold value, with
diacritics as an attribute type. The most gain
is obtained for an entropy threshold of 50.

The fully diacritized data has an average of
1.78 diacritized forms per source word. The av-
erage weighted by the number of occurrences is
6.28, which indicates that words with more di-
acritized forms tend to occur more frequently.
After clustering using a value of θh = 50,
the average number of diacritized forms be-
comes 1.11, and the occurrence weighted av-
erage becomes 3.69. The clustering proce-
dure thus seems to eliminate most diacritized
forms, which likely do not contain helpful dis-
ambiguating information.

Table 2 lists the detailed results of experi-
ments using diacritics. In the �rst experiment,
we show that using full diacritization results in
a small gain on the BLEU score and no gain on
TER, which is somewhat consistent with the
result obtained by Diab et al. (2007). The next
experiment shows the results of clustering the
diacritized source words using decision trees
for the entropy threshold of 50. The TER loss
of the full diacritics becomes a gain, and the
BLEU gain increases. This con�rms our spec-
ulation that the use of fully diacritized data in-

ing the decision trees to cluster the diacritized
source data prunes diacritized forms that do
not decrease the entropy of the lexical trans-
lation probability distributions. It thus �nds
a sweet-spot between the negative e�ect of in-
creasing the vocabulary size and the positive
e�ect of disambiguation.

In our experiments, using diacritics with
case endings gave consistently better score
than using diacritics with no case endings, de-
spite the fact that they result in a higher vo-
cabulary size. One possible explanation is that
diacritics not only help in lexical disambigua-
tion, but they might also be indirectly help-
ing in phrase reordering, since the diacritics on
the �nal letter indicate the word's grammatical
function.

The results from using decision trees to in-
terpolate attribute-dependent lexical smooth-
ing features are summarized in table 3. In
the �rst experiment, we show the results of
using diacritics to estimate the interpolated
lexical translation probabilities. The results
show a gain of +0.5 BLEU points and 0.39
TER points. The gain is statistically signi�-
cant with a 95% con�dence level. Using part-
of-speech as an attribute gives a smaller, but
still statistically signi�cant gain. We also ran
a control experiment, where we used diacritic-
dependent lexical translation probabilities ob-
tained from the decision trees, but did not per-
form the probability interpolation of equation
(4). The gains mostly disappear, especially on
BLEU, showing the importance of the inter-
polation step for the proper estimation of the
lexical smoothing feature.

5 Conclusion and Future Directions

We presented in this paper a new method for
incorporating explicit context-informed word
attributes into SMT using binary decision
trees. We reported on experiments on Arabic-
to-English translation using diacritized Ara-
bic and part-of-speech as word attributes, and
showed that the use of these attributes in-
creases the likelihood of source-target word
pairs of unseen data. We proposed two spe-
ci�c ways in which the results of the decision
tree training process are used in machine trans-
lation, and showed that they result in better
translation results.

For future work, we plan on using multi-
ple source-side attributes at the same time.
Di�erent attributes could have di�erent dis-
ambiguating information, which could pro-
vide more bene�t than using any of the at-
tributes alone. We also plan on investigat-
ing the use of multi-word trees; trees for word
clusters can for instance be grown instead
of growing a separate tree for each source
word. Although the experiments presented
in this paper use local word attributes, noth-
ing in principle prevents this method from be-
ing used with long-distance sentence context,
or even with document-level or discourse-level
features. Our future plans include the investi-
gation of using such features as well.
