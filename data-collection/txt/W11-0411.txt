Abstract

Within the framework of the construction of a
fact database, we defined guidelines to extract
named entities, using a taxonomy based on an
extension of the usual named entities defini-
tion. We thus defined new types of entities
with broader coverage including substantive-
based expressions. These extended named en-
tities are hierarchical (with types and compo-
nents) and compositional (with recursive type
inclusion and metonymy annotation). Human
annotators used these guidelines to annotate a
1.3M word broadcast news corpus in French.
This article presents the definition and novelty
of extended named entity annotation guide-
lines, the human annotation of a global corpus
and of a mini reference corpus, and the evalu-
ation of annotations through the computation
of inter-annotator agreements. Finally, we dis-
cuss our approach and the computed results,
and outline further work.

1 Introduction

Within the framework of the Quaero project—a mul-
timedia indexing project—we organized an evalu-
ation campaign on named entity extraction aiming
at building a fact database in the news domain, the
first step being to define what kind of entities are
needed. This campaign focused on broadcast news
corpora in French. While traditional named enti-
ties include three major classes (persons, locations
and organizations), we decided to extend the cov-
erage of our campaign to new types of entities and
to broaden their main parts-of-speech from proper

names to substantives, this extension being neces-
sary for ever-increasing knowledge extraction from
documents. We thus produced guidelines to specify
the way corpora had to be annotated, and launched
the annotation process.

In this paper, after covering related work (Sec-
tion 2), we describe the taxonomy we created (Sec-
tion 3) and the annotation process and results (Sec-
tion 4), including the corpora we gathered and the
tools we developed to facilitate annotation. We then
present inter-annotator agreement measures (Sec-
tion 5), outline limitations (Section 6) and conclude
on perspectives for further work (Section 7).

2.1 Named entity definitions

Named Entity recognition was first defined as recog-
nizing proper names (Coates-Stephens, 1992). Since
MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; SAIC,
1998), named entities have been proper names
falling into three major classes: persons, locations
and organizations.

Proposals were made to sub-divide these entities
into finer-grained classes. The “politicians” sub-
class was proposed for the “person” class by (Fleis-
chman and Hovy, 2002) while the “cities” subclass
was added to the “location” class by (Fleischman,
2001; Lee and Lee, 2005).

The CONLL conference added a miscellaneous
type that includes proper names falling outside the
previous classes. Some classes have thus sometimes
been added, e.g. the “product” class by (Bick, 2004;
Galliano et al., 2009).

92



Specific entities are proposed and handled in
some tasks: “language” or “shape” for question-
answering systems in specific domains (Rosset et
al., 2007), “email address” or “phone number” to
process electronic messages (Maynard et al., 2001).
Numeric types are also often described and used.
They include “date”, “time”, and “amount” types
(“amount” generally covers money and percentage).
In specific domains, entities such as gene, protein,
are also handled (Ohta, 2002), and campaigns are or-
ganized for gene detection (Yeh et al., 2005). At the
same time, extensions of named entities have been
proposed: (Sekine, 2004) defined a complete hierar-
chy of named entities containing about 200 types.

2.2 Named Entities and Annotation

As for any other kind of annotation, some aspects are
known to lead to difficulties in obtaining coherence
in the manual annotation process (Ehrmann, 2008;
Fort et al., 2009). Three different classes of prob-
lems are distinguished: (1) selecting the correct cat-
egory in cases of ambiguity, where one entity can
fall into several classes, depending on the context
(“Paris” can be a town or a person name); (2) detect-
ing the boundaries (in a person designation, is only
the proper name to be annotated or the trigger “Mr”
too?) and (3) annotating metonymies (“France” can
be a sports team, a country, etc.).

In the ACE Named Entity task (Doddington et al.,
2004), a complex task, the obtained inter-annotator
agreement was 0.86 in 2002 and 0.88 in 2003. Some
tasks obtain better agreement. Desmet and Hoste
(2010) described the Named Entity annotation real-
ized within the Sonar project, where Named Entity
are clearly simpler. They follow the MUC Named
Entity definition with the subtypes as proposed
by ACE. The agreement computed over the Sonar
Dutch corpus ranges from 0.91 to 0.97 (kappa val-
ues) depending of the emphasized elements (span,
main type, subtype, etc.).

3 Taxonomy

3.1 Guidelines production

Having in mind the objective of building a fact
database through the extraction of named entities
from texts, we defined a richer taxonomy than those
used in other information extraction works.

Following (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2005; Alex
et al., 2010), the annotation guidelines were first
written from December 2009 to May 2010 by three
researchers managing the manual annotation cam-
paign. During guidelines production, we evaluated
the feasibility of this specific annotation task and the
usefulness of the guidelines by annotating a small
part of the target corpus. Then, these guidelines
were delivered to the annotators. They consist of a
description of the objects to annotate, general anno-
tation rules and principles, and more than 250 pro-
totypical and real examples extracted from the cor-
pus (Rosset et al., 2010). Rules are important to set
the general way annotations must be produced. Ad-
ditionally, examples are essential for human annota-
tors to grasp the annotation rationale more easily.

Indeed, while producing the guidelines, we knew
that the given examples would never cover all possi-
ble cases because of the specificity of language and
of the ambiguity of formulations and situations de-
scribed in corpora, as shown in (Fort et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, guidelines examples must be consid-
ered as a way to understand the final objective of
the annotation work. Thanks to numerous meetings
from May to November 2010, we gathered feedback
from the annotators (four annotators plus one anno-
tation manager). This feedback allowed us to clarify
and extend the guidelines in several directions. The
guidelines are 72 pages long and consist of 3 major
parts: general description of the task and the prin-
ciples (25% of the overall document), presentation
of each type of named entity (57%), and a simpler
“cheat sheet” (18%).

3.2 Definition

We decided to use the three general types of
named entities: name (person, location, organi-
zation) as described in (Grishman and Sundheim,
1996; SAIC, 1998), time (date and duration), and
quantity (amount). We then included named entities
extensions proposed by (Sekine, 2004; Galliano et
al., 2009) (respectively products and functions) and
we extended the definition of named entities to ex-
pressions which are not composed of proper names
(e.g., phrases built around substantives). The ex-
tended named entities we defined are both hierar-
chical and compositional. For example, type pers
(person) is split into two subtypes, pers.ind (indi-

3.3 Hierarchy

We used two kinds of elements: types and compo-
nents. The types with their subtypes categorize a
named entity. While types and subtypes were used
before (ACE, 2000; Sekine, 2004; ACE, 2005; Gal-
liano et al., 2009), we consider that structuring the
contents of an entity (its components) is important
too. Components categorize the elements inside a
named entity.

Our taxonomy is composed of 7 main types
(person, function, location, product, organization,
amount and time) and 32 subtypes (Table 1). Types
and subtypes refer to the general category of a
named entity. They give general information about
the annotated expression. Almost each type is then
specified using subtypes that either mark an opposi-
tion between two major subtypes (individual person
vs. collective person), or add precisions (for exam-
ple for locations: administrative location, physical
location, etc.).

This two-level representation of named entities,
with types and components, constitutes a novel ap-
proach.

Types and subtypes To deal with the intrinsic am-
biguity of named entities, we defined two specific
transverse subtypes: 1. other for entities with a dif-
ferent subtype than those proposed in the taxon-
omy (for example, prod.other for games), and 2. un-
known when the annotator does not know which sub-
type to use.

Types and subtypes constitute the first level of an-
notation. They refer to a general segmentation of
the world into major categories. Within these cate-
gories, we defined a second level of annotation we
call components.

Components Components can be considered as
clues that help the annotator to produce an anno-
tation: either to determine the named entity type
(e.g. a first name is a clue for the pers.ind named
entity subtype), or to set the named entity bound-
aries (e.g. a given token is a clue for the named en-
tity, and is within its scope, while the next token is
not a clue and is outside its scope). Components are
second-level elements, and can never be used out-
side the scope of a type or subtype element. An en-
tity is thus composed of components that are of two
kinds: transverse components and specific compo-
nents (Table 2). Transverse components can be used
in several types of entities, whereas specific compo-
nents can only be used in one type of entity.

name (name of the entity), kind (hyperonym of the entity), qualifier (qualifying adjective), demonym
(inhabitant or ethnic group name), demonym.nickname (inhabitant or ethnic group nickname), val

time-modifier (a time modifier).

3.4 Composition

Another original point in this work is the compo-
sitional nature of the annotations. Entities can be
compositional for three reasons: (i) a type contains a
component; (ii) a type includes another type, used as
a component; and (iii) in cases of metonymy. Dur-
ing the Ester II evaluation campaign, there was an
attempt to use compositionality in named entities for
two categories: persons and functions, where a per-
son entity could contain a function entity.

<pers.hum> <func.pol> président </func.pol>
<pers.hum> Chirac </pers.hum> </pers.hum>

Nevertheless, the Ester II evaluation did not take
this inclusion into account and only focused on
the encompassing annotation (<pers.hum> président
Chirac </pers.hum>). We drew our inspiration from
this experience, and allowed the annotators and the
systems to use compositionality in the annotations.

Cases of inclusion can be found in the function
type (Figure 1), where type func.ind, which spans
the whole expression, includes type org.adm, which
spans the single word “budget”. In this case, we con-
sider that the designation of this function (“ministre
du budget”) includes both the kind (“ministre”) and

the name (“budget”) of the ministry, which itself is
typed as is relevant (org.adm). Recursive cases of
embedding can be found when a subtype includes
another named entity annotated with the same sub-
type (org.ent in Figure 2).

Cases of metonymy include strict metonymy (a
term is substituted with another one in a relation
of contiguity) and antonomasia (a proper name is
used as a substantive or vice versa). In such cases,
the entity must be annotated with both types, first
(inside) with the intrinsic type of the entity, then
(outside) with the type that corresponds to the re-
sult of the metonymy. Basically, country names
correspond to “national administrative” locations
(loc.adm.nat) but they can also designate the admin-
istration (org.adm) of the country (Figure 3).

3.5 Boundaries

Our definition of the scope of entities excludes rel-
ative clauses, subordinate clauses, and interpolated
clauses: the annotation of an entity must end before
these clauses. If an interpolated clause occurs inside
an entity, its annotation must be split. Moreover, two
distinct persons sharing the same last name must be
annotated as two separate entities (Figure 4); we in-
tend to use relations between entities to gather these
segments in the next step of the project.

4 Annotation process

4.1 Corpus

We managed the annotation of a corpus of about one
hundred hours of transcribed speech from several
French-speaking radio stations in France and Mo-
rocco. Both news and entertainment shows were
transcribed, including dialogs, with speaker turns.1

Once annotated, the corpus was split into a de-
velopment corpus: one file from a French radio sta-
tion;2 a training corpus: 188 files from five French
stations3 and one Moroccan station;4 and a test cor-
pus: 18 files from two French stations already stud-
ied in the training corpus5 and from unseen sources,
both radio6 and television,7 in order to evaluate the
robustness of systems. These data have been used in
the 2011 Quaero named entity evaluation campaign.

1Potential named entities may be split across several seg-
ments or turns.

2News from France Culture.
3News from France Culture (refined language), France Info

(news with short news headlines), France Inter (generalist radio
station), Radio Classique (classical music and economic news),
RFI (international radio broadcast out of France).

4News from RTM (generalist French speaking radio).
5News from France Culture, news and entertainment from

France Inter.
6A popular entertainment show from Europe 1.
7News from Arte (public channel with art and culture),

France 2 (public generalist channel), and TF1 (private gener-
alist popular channel).

This corpus allows us to perform different evalua-
tions, depending of the knowledge the systems have
of the source (source seen in the training corpus vs.
unseen source), the kind of show (news vs. enter-
tainment), the language style (popular vs. refined),
and the type of media (radio vs. television).

4.2 Tools for annotators

To perform our test annotations (see Section 2.2),
we developed a very simple annotation tool as an in-
terface based on XEmacs. We provided the human
annotators with this tool and they decided to use it
for the campaign, despite the fact that it is very sim-
ple and that we told them about other, more generic,
annotation tools such as GATE8 or Glozz.9 This is
probably due to the fact that apart from being very
simple to install and use, it has interesting features.

The first feature is the insertion of annotations
using combinations of keyboard shortcuts based on
the initial of each type, subtype and component
name. For example, combination F2 key + initial
keys is used to annotate a subtype (pers.ind, etc.),
F3 + keys for a transverse component (name, kind,
etc.), F4 + keys for a specific component (name.first,
etc.), and F5 to delete the annotation selected with
the cursor (both opening and closing tags).

The second feature is boundary management: if
the annotator puts the cursor over the token to anno-
tate, the annotation tool will handle the boundaries
of this token; opening and closing tags will be in-
serted around the token.

However, it presents some limitations: tags are
inserted in the text (which makes visualization more
complex, especially for long sentences or in cases
of multiple annotations on the same entity), no per-
sonalization is offered (tags are of only one color),
and there is no function to express annotator uncer-
tainty (the user must choose among several possible
tags the one that fits the best;10 while producing the
guidelines, we did not consider it could be of inter-
est: as a consequence, no uncertainty management
was implemented). Therefore, this tool allows users
to insert tags rapidly into a text, but it offers no exter-
nal resources, as real annotation tools (e.g. GATE)
often do.

8http://gate.ac.uk/
9http://www.glozz.org/

10Uncertainty can be found in cases of lack of context.

96



These simplistic characteristics combined with a
fast learning curve allow the annotators to rapidly
annotate the corpora. Annotators were allowed not
to annotate the transverse component name (only if
it was the only component in the annotated phrase,
e.g. “Russia” in Figure 3, blue tag) and to annotate
events, even though we do not focus on this type
of entity as of yet. We therefore also provided a
normalization tool which adds the transverse com-
ponent name in these instances, and which removes
event annotations.

4.3 Corpus annotation

Global annotation It took four human annotators
two months and a half to annotate the entire corpus
(10 man-month). These annotators were hired grad-
uate students (MS in linguistics). The overall corpus
was annotated in duplicate. Regular comparisons of
annotations were performed and allowed the anno-
tators to develop a methodology, which was subse-
quently used to annotate the remaining documents.

Mini reference corpus To evaluate the global an-
notation, we built a mini reference corpus by ran-
domly selecting 400 sentences from the training cor-
pus and distributing them into four files. These files
were annotated by four graduate human annotators
from two research institutes (Figure 5) with two hu-
mans per institute, in about 10 hours per annotator.

Figure 5: Creation of mini reference corpus and compu-
tation of inter-annotator agreement. Institute 1 = LIMSI–
CNRS, Institute 2 = INIST–CNRS

First, we merged the annotations of each file
within a given institute (1.5h per pair of annotators),
then merged the results across the two institutes
(2h). Finally, we merged the results with the anno-

tations of the hired annotators (8h). We thus spent
about 90 hours to annotate and merge annotations in
this mini reference corpus (0.75 man-month).

4.4 Annotation results

Our broadcast news corpus includes 1,291,225
tokens, among which there are 954,049 non-
punctuation tokens. Its annotation contains 113,885
named entities and 146,405 components (Table 3),
i.e. one entity per 8.4 non-punctuation tokens, and
one component per 6.5 non-punctuation tokens.
There is an average of 6 annotations per line.

5 Inter-Annotator Agreement

5.1 Procedure

During the annotation campaign, we measured sev-
eral criteria on a regular basis: inter-annotator agree-
ment and disagreement. We used them to correct er-
roneous annotations, and mapped these corrections
to the original annotations. We also used these mea-
sures to give the annotators feedback on the en-
countered problems, discrepancies, and residual er-
rors. Whereas we performed these measurements all
along the annotation campaign, this paper focuses
on the final evaluation on the mini reference corpus.

5.2 Metrics

Because human annotation is an interpretation pro-
cess (Leech, 1997), there is no “truth” to rely on. It
is therefore impossible to really evaluate the validity
of an annotation. All we can and should do is to eval-
uate its reliability, i.e. the consistency of the anno-
tation across annotators, which is achieved through
computation of the inter-annotator agreement (IAA).

97



The best way to compute it is to use one of
the Kappa family coefficients, namely Cohen’s
Kappa (Cohen, 1960) or Scott’s Pi (Scott, 1955),
also known as Carletta’s Kappa (Carletta, 1996),11

as they take chance into account (Artstein and Poe-
sio, 2008). However, these coefficients imply a
comparison with a “random baseline” to establish
whether the correlation between annotations is sta-
tistically significant. This baseline depends on the
number of “markables”, i.e. all the units that could
be annotated.

In the case of named entities, as in many others,
this “random baseline” is known to be difficult—if
not impossible—to identify (Alex et al., 2010). We
wish to analyze this in more detail, to see how we
could actually compute these coefficients and what
information it would give us about the annotation.

hen’s Kappa, π for Scott’s Pi, and F for F-measure). IAA
values were computed by taking as the reference the hired
annotators’ annotation or that obtained by merging from
both institutes (see Figure 5).

In the present case, we could consider that, poten-
tially, all the noun phrases can be annotated (row U3
in Table 4, based on the PASSAGE campaign (Vil-
nat et al., 2010)). Of course, this is a wrong approx-
imation as named entities are not necessarily noun
phrases (e.g., “à partir de l’automne prochain”, from
next autumn).

We could also consider all n-grams of tokens in
the corpus (row U1). However, it would be more

11For more details on terminology issues, we refer to the in-
troduction of (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).

relevant to limit their size. For a maximum size of
six, we get the results shown in row U2. All this, of
course, is artificial, as the named entity annotation
process is not random.

To obtain results that are closer to reality, we
could use numbers of named entities from previous
named entity annotation campaigns (row U4 based
on the Ester II campaign (Galliano et al., 2009)), but
as we consider here a largely extended version of
those, the results would again be far from reality.

Another solution is to consider as “markables” all
the units annotated by at least one of the annotators
(row U5). In this particular case, units not annotated
by any of the annotators (i.e. silence) are overlooked.

The lowest IAA will be the one computed with
this last solution, while the highest IAA will be
equal to the F-measure (i.e. the measure computed
with all the markables as shown in row U1 in Ta-
ble 4). We notice that the first two solutions (U1
and U2 with n-grams) are not acceptable because
they are far from reality; even extended named en-
tities are sparse annotations, and just considering
all tokens as ‘markables’ is not suitable. The last
three ones seem to be more relevant because they
are based on an observed segmentation on similar
data. Still, the U3 solution (NPs) overrates the num-
ber of markables because not all noun phrases are
extended named entities. Although the U4 solution
(Ester entities) is based on the same corpus used for
a related task, it underrates the number of markables
because that task produced 16.3 times less annota-
tions. Finally the U5 solution (pooling) gives the
lower bound for the κ estimation which is an in-
teresting information but may easily undervalue the
quality of the annotation.

As (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005) showed, in
our case κ tends towards the F-measure when the
number of negative cases tends towards infinity. Our
results show that it is hard to build a justifiable hy-
pothesis on the number of markables which is larger
than the number of actually annotated entities while
keeping κ significantly under the F-measure. But
building no hypothesis leads to underestimating the
κ value.

This reinforces the idea of using the F-measure
as the main inter-annotator agreement measure for
named entity annotation tasks.

6 Limitations

We used syntax to define some components (e.g. a
qualifier is an adjective) and to set the scope of en-
tities (e.g. stop at relative clauses). Nevertheless,
this syntactic definition cannot fit all named enti-
ties, which are mainly defined according to seman-
tics: the phrase “dans les mois qui viennent” (“in
the coming months”) expresses an entity of type
time.date.rel where the relative clause “qui vien-
nent” is part of the entity and contributes the time-
modifier component.

The distinction between some types of entities
may be fuzzy, especially for the organizations (is
the Social Security an administrative organization or
a company?) and for context-dependent annotations
(is lemonde.fr a URL, a media, or a company?). As a
consequence, some entity types might be converted
into specific components in a future revision, e.g. the
func type could become a component of the pers
type, where it would become a description of the
function itself instead of the person who performs
this function (Figure 6).

7 Conclusion and perspectives

In this paper, we presented an extension of the tra-
ditional named entity categories to new types (func-
tions, civilizations) and new coverage (expressions
built over a substantive). We created guidelines
that were used by graduate annotators to annotate
a broadcast news corpus.

The organizers also annotated a small part of the
corpus to build a mini reference corpus. We evalu-
ated the human annotations with our mini-reference
corpus: the actual computed κ is between 0.71 et
0.85 which, given the complexity of the task, seems
to indicate a good annotation quality. Our results are
consistent with other studies (Dandapat et al., 2009)
in demonstrating that human annotators’ training is
a key asset to produce quality annotations.

We also saw that guidelines are never fixed, but
evolve all along the annotation process due to feed-
back between annotators and organizers; the rela-
tionship between guidelines producers and human
annotators evolved from “parent” to “peer” (Akrich
and Boullier, 1991). This evolution was observed
during the annotation development, beyond our ex-
pectations. These data have been used for the 2011
Quaero Named Entity evaluation campaign.

Extensions and revisions are planned. Our first
goal is to add a new type of named entity for all
kinds of events; guidelines are being written and hu-
man annotation tests are ongoing. We noticed that
some subtypes are more difficult to disambiguate
than others, especially org.adm and org.ent (defi-
nition and examples in the guidelines are not clear
enough). We shall make decisions about this kind
of ambiguity, either by merging these subtypes or by
reorganizing the distinctions within the organization
type. We also plan to link the annotated entities us-
ing relations; further work is needed to define more
precisely the way we will perform these annotations.
Moreover, the taxonomy we defined was applied to
a broadcast news corpus, but we intend to use it in
other corpora. The annotation of an old press corpus
was performed according to the same process. Its
evaluation will start in the coming months.

We thank all the annotators who did such a great
work on this project, as well as Sabine Barreaux
(INIST–CNRS) for her work on the reference cor-
pus.

This work was partly realized as part of the
Quaero Programme, funded by Oseo, French State
agency for innovation and by the French ANR Etape
project.
