Abstract 

This paper reviews the significant 
contributions FrameNet has made to 
our understanding of lexical resources, 
semantic roles and event relations. 

1 Introduction  
One of the great challenges of Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) is the multitude of 
choices that language gives us for expressing 
the same thing in different ways. This is 
obviously true when taking other languages 
into consideration - the same thought can be 
expressed in English, French, Chinese or 
Russian, with widely varying results. However, 
it is also true when considering a single 
language such as English. Light verb 
constructions, nominalizations, idioms, slang, 
paraphrases, and synonyms all give us myriads 
of alternatives for “coining a phrase.”  This 
causes immense difficulty for NLP systems.  
No one has made greater contributions to 
advancing the state of the art of lexical 
semantics, and its applications to NLP, than 
Chuck Fillmore.  In this paper we focus on the 
central role that FrameNet has played in our 
development of SemLink+ and in our current 
explorations into event ontologies that can play 
a practical role in accurate automatic event 
extraction. 

2 Detecting events 
An elusive goal of current NLP systems is the 
accurate detection of events – recognizing the 
meaningful relations among the topics, people, 

places   and  events   buried  within text. These 
relations can be very complex, and are not 
always explicit, requiring subtle semantic 
interpretation of the data.  For instance, NLP 
systems must be able to automatically 
recognize that Stock prices sank and The stock 
market is falling can be describing the same 
event. Such an interpretation relies upon a  
recognition of the similarity between sinking 
and falling, as well as noting the connection 
between stock prices and the stock market, 
and, finally, acknowledgment that they are 
playing the same role. A key element in event 
extraction is the identification of the 
participants of an event, such as the initiator of 
an action and any parties affected by it.  
Basically who did what to whom, when, where, 
why and how? Many systems today rely on 
semantic role labeling to help identify 
participants, and lexical resources that provide 
an inventory of possible predicate argument 
structures for individual lexical items are 
crucial to the success of semantic role labeling 
(Palmer,et al., 2010).  

3 SemLink+ and  Semantic Roles 
SemLink (Palmer, 2009) is an ongoing effort 
to map complementary lexical resources: 
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), VerbNet 
(Kipper et al., 2008), FrameNet (Fillmore et 
al., 2004), and the recently added OntoNotes 
(ON) sense groupings (Weischedel, et al., 
2011). They all associate semantic information 
with the propositions in a sentence.  Each was 
created independently with somewhat differing 
goals, and they vary in the level and nature of 
semantic detail represented. FrameNet is the 

13



most fine-grained with the richest semantics, 
VerbNet     focuses    on     syntactically-based 
generalizations that carry semantic 
implications, and the relatively coarse-grained 
PropBank has been shown to provide the most 
effective training data for supervised Machine 
Learning techniques.  Nonetheless, they can be 
seen as complementary rather than conflicting, 
and together comprise a whole that is greater 
than the sum of its parts. SemLink serves as a 
platform to unify these resources.  The recent 
addition of ON sense groupings, which can be 
thought of as a more coarse-grained view of 
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides even 
broader coverage for verbs, and a level of 
representation that is appropriate for linking 
between VerbNet class members and 
FrameNet lexical units, as described below. 
   SemLink unifies these lexical resources at 
several different levels.  First by providing 
type-to-type mappings between the lexical 
units for each framework.  For PropBank these 
are the very coarse-grained rolesets, for 
VerbNet  they are verbs that are members of 
VerbNet classes, and for FrameNet they are the 
lexical units associated with each Frame.  The 
same lemma can have multiple PropBank 
rolesets and can be in several VerbNet classes 
and FrameNet frames, but always with 
different meanings. In general, the mappings 
from PropBank to VerbNet or FrameNet tend 
to be 1-many, while the mappings between 
VerbNet and FrameNet are more likely to be 1-
1.  For example, the verb hear has just one 
coarse-grained sense in PropBank, with the 
following roleset: 
 

Arg0: hearer 
Arg1: utterance, sound 
Arg2: speaker, source of sound 
 

This roleset maps to both the Discover and See 
classes of VerbNet, and the Hear and 
Perception_experience frames of FrameNet.   
   Then, for each lexical unit, SemLink also 
supplies a mapping between the semantic roles 
of PropBank and VerbNet, as well as the roles 
of  VerbNet and FrameNet. PropBank uses 
very generic labels such as Arg0 and Arg1, 
which correspond to Dowty’s Prototypical 
Agent and Patient, respectively (Dowty, 1991).  
PropBank has up to six numbered arguments 

for core verb specific roles and for adjuncts it 
has several generally applicable ArgModifiers 
that have function tag labels such as: MaNneR, 
TeMPoral, LOCation, DIRection, GOaL, etc. 
VerbNet uses more traditional linguistic 
thematic role labels, with about 30 in total, and 
assumes adjuncts (ArgM’s) will be supplied by 
PropBank based semantic role labelers.  
FrameNet is even more fine-grained and has 
frame-specific core and peripheral roles called 
Frame Elements for each frame, amounting to 
over 2000 individual Frame Element types.  
For example, He talked about politics would 
receive the following semantic role labels from 
each framework.1 
 
 PropBank (talk.01) 
HeArg0 talkedRELATION about politicsArg1  
 
 VerbNet (Talk-37.5):  
HeAGENT talkedRELATION about politicsTOPIC 
 

FrameNet (Statement frame):  
HeSPEAKER talkedRELATION about politicsTOPIC  
 
   Thanks to Chuck Fillmore’s careful 
guidance, the rich, meticulously crafted 
Frames in FrameNet, with their detailed 
descriptions of all possible arguments and their 
relations to each other, offer the potential of 
providing a foundation for inferencing about 
events and their consequences.  In addition 
FrameNet has from the beginning been 
inclusive in its addition of nominal and 
adjectival forms to the Frames, which greatly 
increases our coverage of all predicating 
elements (Bonial, et al., 2014).  There is also a 
comprehensive FrameNet Constructicon that 
painstakingly lists many phrasal constructions, 
such as “the Xer, the Yer” that cannot be found 
anywhere else (Fillmore, et al., 2012). Many of 
these frames, including the constructions, 
apply equally well to other languages,  as 
evidenced by the various efforts to develop 
FrameNets in other languages2 promising a 
likely benefit to multilingual information 

                                                             
1 Arg0 maps to Agent maps to Speaker.  Arg1 maps to 
Topic maps to Topic.

processing as well.  Given the close theoretical 
ties between PropBank, VerbNet and 
FrameNet, it should be possible to bootstrap 
from the successful PropBank-based automatic 
semantic role labelers to equally accurate 
FrameNet and VerbNet annotators, and to 
improve overall semantic role labeling 
performance (Bauer & Rambow, 2011; 
Dipanjan, et al., 2010; Giuglea & Moschitti, 
2006; Merlo & der Plas, 2009; Yi, et al., 2007).  
That is one of the primary goals of SemLink.  
   The first release of SemLink (1.1) contained 
mappings between these three lexical resources 
as well as a set of PropBank instances from the 
Wall Street Journal data with mappings to 
VerbNet classes and thematic roles (Palmer, 
2009).  Our most recent release, SemLink 1.2,3 
now includes mappings to FrameNet frames 
and Frame Elements wherever they are 
available (FN version 1.5), as well as ON sense 
groupings (Bonial, et al., 2013). The mapping 
files between PropBank and VerbNet (version 
3.2), and FrameNet have also been checked for 
consistency and updated to more accurately 
reflect the current relations between these 
resources. 
   This annotated corpus can now be used to 
train and evaluate VerbNet Class and 
FrameNet Frame classifiers, to explore clusters 
of Frame Elements that map to the same 
VerbNet and PropBank semantic roles, and to 
evaluate approaches to semantic role labeling 
that use the type-to-type mappings to bootstrap 
VerbNet and FrameNet role labels from 
automatic PropBank semantic role labels. 

4 Events, Event Types and Subevents 
Accurate and informative semantic role 

labels are an essential component of event 
extraction, but, although necessary, they are 
not sufficient. Automatic event detection also 
requires the ability to distinguish between 
events which are truly separate, such as 
Yesterday, John was throwing a ball to Mary 
and Bill was flying a kite, as opposed to related 
events such as John was washing the dishes 
and Mary was drying them.  The second pair 
could be seen as temporally related subevents 
of an overall doing the dishes or cleaning up

the kitchen event. It can sometimes be quite 
challenging to determine the relationship 
between two events. For instance, earthquakes 
are quite often associated with the collapse of 
buildings, as in the following example, The 
quake destroyed parts of Sausalito.  All tall 
buildings were demolished.  

Many readers might agree that the 
earthquakes CAUSED the demolishment of the 
buildings. However, are the building collapses 
also SUBEVENTs of the earthquakes?  
Sometimes they happen a few days later, or 
immediately, simultaneously with the 
earthquake. Are they both subevents? In 
general, for accurate event detection, it would 
be very useful to know which events must 
precede, must follow, or cannot be 
simultaneous with, which other events.   As 
discussed in the 2013 NAACL Events 
workshop and this year’s ACL Events 
workshop, clear, consistent annotation of 
events and their coreference and causal and 
temporal relations is a much desired but very 
challenging goal (Ikuta & Palmer, 2014).  Any 
assistance that can be provided by lexical 
resources is welcome. 

Another very important contribution that 
FrameNet has made is in the realm of defining 
these kinds of relations, and others, between 
frames.  Parent-Child Frame to Frame relations 
can include Inheritance, Subframe, Perspective 
On, Using, Causative Of, Inchoative of, and 
there is also a Precedes temporal ordering 
relation.   

The DEFT working group in Richer Event 
Descriptions has recently been exploring 
expanding the ACE and ERE event types, and 
how they can be mapped onto a broader 
ontological context.  Exploring the FrameNet 
relations that the relevant lexical items 
participate in has been most informative. We 
first examined the simple LDC ERE 
classification of Conflict events, which has 
demonstrations and attacks as siblings (ERE 
guidelines). We find FrameNet’s classification 
of attacks as Hostile-Encounters quite useful, 
and have no argument with it having an 
Inheritance relation with Intentionally_act, and 
a Using relation with Taking_sides. 
Demonstrations, on the other hand, come 
under the Protest Frame, which has a Using 
relation with Taking_sides. The FrameNet 

15



organization of demonstrations and attacks, 
although perfectly justifiable, doesn’t map 
neatly onto the LDC organization since, 
although they are close, they are not siblings.  
However, by also considering SUMO (Niles & 
Pease, 2001), the Predicate Matrix (de Lacalle , 
et al., 2014), WordNet and VerbNet, we were 
able to develop the upper level partial Event 
Ontology given in Figure 1, which comfortably 
incorporates the ERE and FrameNet relations 
within a broader framework, preserving the 
key aspects of each.   

We are now discussing the ERE Life events, 
birth, death, injury, marriage, divorce, etc., 
and FrameNet is again proving to be 
inspirational.  SemLink+ will encompass our 
growing Event Ontology, as well as the 
mappings between the resources and the 
multiple layers of annotation on the same data.

5 Conclusion 
Since computers do not interact with and 
experience the world the same way humans do, 
how could they ever interpret language 
describing the world the same way humans do?  
That NLP has made as much progress as it has 
is truly phenomenal, and there is much more 
still that can be done.  Rich, detailed, lexical 
resources like FrameNet are major stepping 
stones that will enable continued 
improvements in the automatic representation 
of sentences in context. FrameNet, and 
WordNet, PropBank, VerbNet and SemLink+, 
provide priceless, invaluable information about 
myriads of different types of events and the 
creative ways in which they can be expressed, 

as well as rich details about all of their possible 
participants.  If we can harness the power of 
distributional semantics to help us dynamically 
extend and enrich what has already been 
manually created, we may find our computers 
to be much smarter than we ever imagined 
them to be.
