Abstract

A microblog repost tree provides strong
clues on how an event described therein
develops. To help social media users
capture the main clues of events on mi-
croblogging sites, we propose a novel re-
post tree summarization framework by ef-
fectively differentiating two kinds of mes-
sages on repost trees called leaders and
followers, which are derived from content-
level structure information, i.e., contents
of messages and the reposting relations.
To this end, Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) model is used to detect leaders
across repost tree paths. We then present a
variant of random-walk-based summariza-
tion model to rank and select salient mes-
sages based on the result of leader detec-
tion. To reduce the error propagation cas-
caded from leader detection, we improve
the framework by enhancing the random
walk with adjustment steps for sampling
from leader probabilities given all the re-
posting messages. For evaluation, we
construct two annotated corpora, one for
leader detection, and the other for repost
tree summarization. Experimental results
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

1 Introduction

Microblogging platforms have become the center
for reporting, discussing, and disseminating real-
life issues, on which users usually repost to share
microblog messages with their following users.
Also, users can repost with commentary for not
only further broadcasting but also extending the

original microblog post content. Because an in-
dividual post is generally too short to cover the
main clues of an event, microblogging users can-
not easily capture the key information from re-
ceived posts due to the lack of context. And re-
posting messages, namely reposts, can provide
valuable context information to the previous posts
including their background, development, public
opinions and so on. However, a popular post usu-
ally attracts a large number of reposts. It is imprac-
tical for users to read them all and fully understand
their contents.

The task of microblog context summarization
aims to produce succinct summaries to help users
better understand the main clues by extracting
salient information among massive reposts of the
original posts. An intuitive approach is to directly
apply existing extractive summarizers based on
the unstructured, plain microblog contents. But
such short and informal reposts render the lack
of structures in each individual message, and it is
difficult for conventional extractive summarizersto
identify salient messages. Chang et al. (2013) pro-
posed to summarize Twitter context trees by fo-
cusing on modeling user influence. However, the
reposts of influential users might not be salient
summary candidates necessarily. For instance,
celebrities might simply repost with nothing im-
portant. Also, modeling user influence accurately
needs tremendous historical user interaction data
external to the tree being summarized while such
kind of information cannot be utilized directly for
summarizing the messages on the tree.

In this paper, we propose a novel mi-
croblog context summarization framework based
on content-level structures, i.e., message contents
and reposting relations, rather than user-level in-
fluence signals. The reposting relations connect
the reposting messages and form a cohesive body
as a tree structure named repost tree. The root rep-
resents the original post and the edges denote re-

2168



posting relations. Our idea is to exploit the struc-
ture of repost tree together with content of mes-
sages to help distinguish two different messages
on repost tree, i.e., leaders and followers. Specif-
ically, leader is referred to as a message on re-
post tree covering salient new information, which
can lead further comments or discussions in its de-
scendant reposts; follower is referred to as a mes-
sage that contains no comment, simply repeats or
naively responds to its ancestor leader message,
thus providing no important information. The ex-
ample below illustrates a repost tree path, where
we use [O] and [Ri] to indicate the original post
and the i-th repost, respectively:

[O] @MAS: Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of
MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position
was over Ukrainian airspace.

[R1] @Hanna: OMG... Poor on MH17... Preying...

[R2] @Victoria: OMG that’s horrible!!! I’m sorry to
hear that. God will bless u poor guys. Wish world
can be peaceful. And no one will get hurt.

[R3] @Dr.Dr: Six top HIV scientists are on MH17. They
go for AIDS and would NEVER come back!!!

[R4] @TomyBlack: 6 experts died?! Terrible loss to HIV
research :(

[O] reports the news about MH17 missing, which
brings about further comments in [R1] and [R2].
[R3] does not continue commenting on that but of-
fers some new information and triggers shocking
reaction in [R4]. So [O] and [R3] act as leaders;
[R1], [R2] and [R4] are followers.

Intuitively, leaders would be more important
than followers from the summarization’s perspec-
tive since leaders are supposed to capture the main
clues or aspects of event evolvement. The first
step of our summarization system is to distinguish
leaders and followers effectively. Leaders are de-
tected across repost tree paths which provide rich
context information owing to the tree structure.
We utilize sequence tagging model Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) to infer how likely it is each
repost being a leader or follower. Then we incor-
porate leader detection result into an unsupervised
summarization model based on random walk. Our
model uses content similarities between messages
and consider their possibilities of being leaders
to rank and select salient reposting messages that
form summaries. Furthermore, we improve the
framework by enhancing the random walk to re-
duce the impact of errors cascaded from the leader
detection module. Compared to the state-of-the-
art baselines, the experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Our contributions are given as follows:
• We propose a novel microblog context sum-

marization framework, in which given reposting
messages organized as a repost tree (obtaining
repost tree is trivial using public microblogging
toolkit (Ren et al., 2014)), we summarize the re-
post trees based on content information and re-
posting relations of messages.
• We identify a novel problem of leader de-

tection for summarization, which aims to reduce
noise on repost trees, and present a CRF-based
method for effectively detecting leaders by utiliz-
ing the tree structure and message contents.
• We incorporate the leader detection result

into an unsupervised summarization model based
on random walk and substantially enhance the
model to reduce the impact of leader detection er-
rors on summarization.

2 Related Work

The goal of text summarization is to automat-
ically produce a succinct summary for one or
more documents that preserves important infor-
mation (Radev et al., 2002). Generally, text sum-
marization techniques can be categorized into ex-
tractive and abstractive methods (Das and Mar-
tins, 2007). Extractive approaches focus on how
to identify and distill salient contents from orig-
inal texts whereas abstractive approaches aim at
producing grammatical summaries by text genera-
tion.

Recently, the development of social media has
made microblog summarization a hot topic. Most
prior works are on event-level or topic-level sum-
marization. Typically, the first step is to clus-
ter posts into sub-events (Chakrabarti and Punera,
2011; Duan et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013) or sub-
topics (Long et al., 2011; Rosa et al., 2011; Meng
et al., 2012), and then the second step generates
summary for each cluster.

Some works tried to apply conventional
extractive summarization models directly,
e.g., LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004),
MEAD (Radev et al., 2004), TF-IDF (Inouye and
Kalita, 2011), Integer Linear Programming (Liu
et al., 2011; Takamura et al., 2011), etc. Sharif
et al. (2010) modeled the problem as optimal
path finding on a phrase reinforcement graph.
However, these general summarizers were found
not suitable for microblog posts, which are infor-
mal and noisy (Chang et al., 2013). Researchers

2169



then considered social signals like user following
relations and retweet count (Duan et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2012), and reported such features useful
to help summarize microblog posts. Our work
studies repost tree summarization by leverag-
ing content-level structure to enrich context of
messages, which is a different kind of signal.

Chang et al. (2013) proposed a task to summa-
rize Twitter context trees consisting of an original
tweet and all its reposts (i.e., replies and retweets).
They combined user influence signals into a super-
vised summarization framework. Our work is dif-
ferent from theirs: 1) They simply treat a context
tree as a tweets stream while we consider repost
tree structures in summarization; 2) They rely on
user interactions to calculate user influence for ex-
tracting salient messages while we focus on how
to utilize contents and repost tree structures to dif-
ferentiate leader and follower messages for sum-
marization; 3) Our summarization module is unsu-
pervised, thus no need of ground-truth summaries.

3 Leader Detection Model

This section deals with how to differentiate leader
and follower messages on a repost tree. Intu-
itively, identifying leaders effectively makes one
step closer to obtaining a good summary.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of a repost tree1.
As shown in the figure, a leader message contains
contents that brings essential information increase,
such as a new clue about MH17 reported in [R6],
and potentially triggers a new round of informa-
tion propagation by attracting follower messages
to focus on the raised clue, like [R7], [R8] and
[R9]. As the repost tree grows, it also happens
that some new reposts join in, following the clue
raised by one of their ancestors, but further ex-
tend it by mentioning something new, thus some
of these messages may evolve into new leaders,
such as [R10].

A simple way to detect leaders on repost tree
is to directly apply a binary classifier like SVM
on each individual message. However, these mod-
els assume reposts are independent without effec-
tively leveraging abundant context along the re-
post tree paths, such as the reposting relations
among different reposts on a path. For instance,
[R2] covering rich content may be misclassified as
a leader if not leveraging context information. But

path extracted from this tree

lost, here’s something suspicious.  

Figure 1: An example of repost tree. [O]: the
original post; [Ri]: the i-th repost; Solid arrow
lines: reposting relationship; Dotted lines: hidden
leader-follower relationship; Dark boxes: leaders
to be detected.

if we look into its context, we can find that [R2]
talks about similar things as [R1], then [R1] clas-
sified as a follower indicates the higher chance of
[R2] being a follower rather than a leader. There-
fore, context information is important for indicat-
ing the messages being leaders or followers.

We extract all root-to-leaf paths within a repost
tree structure and detect leaders across each path.
We formulate leader detection on repost tree paths
as a sequence tagging problem by utilizing a state-
of-the-art sequence learning model CRF (Lafferty
et al., 2001), and taking advantage of its power
in maximizing the likelihood of global label se-
quences. We adopt CRF rather than other compet-
itive context sensitive model like SVMhmm (Al-
tun et al., 2003) due to its probabilistic nature.
The probability of prediction by CRF can pro-
vide critical chances for the following summariza-
tion procedure to reduce the impact of errors made
by leader detection model on summarization (see
Section 4.2).

We map a repost tree path with n microblogs
(m1,m2, · · · ,mn) to a training instance (X,Y ).
Let X = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) represents observed
sequence, where xi denotes the observed feature
vector extracted from the i-th microblog mi, and
Y = (y1, y2, · · · , yn) where yi is the label indicat-
ing whether mi is a leader or not. CRF defines the
discriminative function as a joint distribution over
Y given X as follows:

P (Y |X; θ) ∝ exp
∑

i,j

λjfj(yi, yi−1, X) +
∑

µkgk(yi, X)


where fj and gk are the fixed feature functions,

θ = (λ1, λ2, ...;µ1, µ2, ...) are the parameters in-
dicating the weights of features that can be esti-
mated by maximum likelihood procedure in train-
ing process. The prediction is done based on dy-
namic programming. More details can be found
in (Lafferty et al., 2001). Table 1 lists the features
we use for leader detection.

CRF can utilize both historical and future infor-
mation for prediction so as to maximize the likeli-
hood of the global label sequences. But we would
encounter the problem of label conflict, i.e., the
predictions for the same repost in context of dif-
ferent paths might be different. For this reason,
we determine a repost as a leader if its average
marginal probabilities being a leader in context of
different paths exceeds 50%.

4 LeadSum Summarization Model

Let T = (V,E) represent a repost tree to be
summarized, where V is a set of nodes cor-
responding to microblog messages, and E =
{(u, v)|v is the repost of u} is the edge set denot-
ing reposting relations. This section describes
how to rank nodes in V to produce repost tree
summaries. Enlightened by the general random-
walk-based ranking algorithm DivRank (Mei et
al., 2010), we propose an unsupervised summa-
rization model called LeadSum that aims to select
true and salient leaders into summaries utilizing a
variant of random walk based on content similari-
ties and reposting relations of messages. We first
present a basic LeadSum model, which assumes
leader detection is perfect. Then, we enhance it
to become a soft LeadSum model that reduces the
impact of leader detection errors on the summa-
rization.

4.1 Basic-LeadSum Model

Due to the nature of leaders, they generally cover
more important contents than follows do. Thus

our first summarizer selects contents only from de-
tected leaders. For the leaders detected in a re-
post tree T , we build a similarity graph among
leaders denoted as GL = (VL, EL), where VL =
{v ∈ V |v is a detected leader} is the vertex set
and EL = {(u, v)|u ∈ VL, v ∈ VL, and u 6= v} is
the edge set. The weight for any edge (u, v) rep-
resents the content similarity between u and v, for
which we use cosine similarity.

DivRank (Mei et al., 2010) is a generic graph
ranking model that aims to balance high informa-
tion coverage and low redundancy in top ranking
vertices, which are also two key requirements for
choosing salient summarization sentences (Li et
al., 2009; Liu et al., 2015). Based on that, we
present a model to rank and select salient mes-
sages from leader set VL to form a summary. Since
this model simply assumes perfect leader detec-
tion, it is therefore named Basic-LeadSum.

Similar as DivRank (Mei et al., 2010), the tran-
sition probability at the t-th iteration of random
walk is given as follows:

pt(u→ v) = (1−µ) ·p0(v)+µ · p0(u→ v)Nt−1(v)
Z(u)

(1)

and Z(u) is the normalizing factor:

Z(u) =
∑

w∈VL
p0(u→ w)Nt−1(w) (2)

where p0(u → v) is the organic transition prob-
ability which represents the content similarity be-
tween u and v; Nt−1(v) denotes the times vertex
v is visited up to the (t − 1)-th iteration; p0(v) =

1
|VL| denotes random jumping probability similar
to that in PageRank; and µ is the damping weight
set as 0.85 following most PageRank-based mod-
els. The probability of traveling to leader v can
accumulate as its weight increases during random
walk, and leaders already having high weight can
“absorb” weights from other leaders with high
similarity to it, thus avoids redundancy.

2171



For any v ∈ VL, the update function for its rank-
ing score at the t-th iteration Rt(v) is formulated
as:

Rt(v) =
∑

u∈VL
pt(u→ v)Rt−1(u) (3)

It has been proved that the Markov chain is er-
godic, thus can converge to a stationary distribu-
tion (Mei et al., 2010), which determines the final
rankings for leaders.

4.2 Soft-LeadSum Model
As a two-step summarization system, the perfor-
mance of LeadSum relies on the leader detection,
which might be error-prone. Followers misiden-
tified as leaders participating in leader ranking
brings risks to extract real followers into summary.
Also, leaders misclassified as followers may leave
out strong summary candidates. To reduce such
error propagation, we enhance Basic-LeadSum by
using an even-length random walk with adjust-
ment steps that sample from leader probabilities
given all the reposting messages, which is referred
to as Soft-LeadSum.

Different from Basic-LeadSum, every message
on repost tree T , no matter detected as a leader or
a follower, participates in ranking process of Soft-
LeadSum. In other words, in the random walk,
visitor wanders on a complete graph G = (V,E′)
whose vertex set V is identical to repost tree T ,
and E′ = {(u, v)|u ∈ V, v ∈ V, and u 6= v} rep-
resents the edge set. Therefore, this makes it pos-
sible to include true leaders misclassified as fol-
lowers by leader detection module into summary.

However, allowing all messages to participate
in ranking also increases the risk of selecting real
followers. To avoid this problem, Soft-LeadSum
is composed of two types of walks on G, namely
WALK-1 and WALK-2. In WALK-1, visitor
moves based on content similarities between mes-
sages, which follows transition probabilities simi-
lar to equation (1), but is specifically given as:

pt(u→ v) = (1− µ) · 1|V | + µ ·
p0(u→ v)Nt−1(v)

Z(u)
(4)

where u, v ∈ V , p0(u→ v) is proportional to con-
tent similarity between u and v similar to Basic-
LeadSum, and Z(u) is the normalizing factor.

WALK-2 attempts to avoid selecting true fol-
lowers by adopting a sampling process, whose re-
sult determines the next vertex on G to be visited.
Suppose the current vertex being visited is u, then
we sample from pL(u), i.e., the probability of u

being a leader. Practically, pL(u) can be estimated
with the average of u’s marginal probabilities as
a leader over all root-to-leaf paths passing u on
T output by the leader detection module. If u is
sampled to be a leader, we claim that leader detec-
tion is correct and the visitor stays; otherwise, u is
sampled as a follower, indicating that leader detec-
tion module misclassifies u, so the visitor should
go to u’s leader. Here we assume that a follower
u’s leader is its nearest ancestor leader on T as
shown by the dotted lines in Figure 1. Based on
such simplification, we let the visitor trace back
one by one along the path on T from u to root and
sample from their leader probabilities until a node
v is sampled as a leader and then we determine v
as u’s leader.

So for any u’s ancestor v, the probability of v
being u’s leader is:

Pr{v is u’s leader}
= pL(v)(1− pL(u)−

∑
w∈P(v,u)

Pr{w is u’s leader})

= pL(v)
∏

w∈P(v,u)⋃{u}(1− pL(w))
(5)

where P(v, u) is the set of nodes between v and u
on v-to-u path of repost tree, i.e., P(v, u) = {w ∈
V |w is v’s descendant and u’s ancestor on T}. In
particular, we assume that pL(r) = 1 so as to stop
the sampling process when the visitor arrives at
root r.

Therefore, WALK-2’s transition probabilities
can be calculated as follows:

q(u→ v) =
{
pL(v) if v = u;
Pr{v is u’s leader} if v is u’s ancestor;
0 otherwise

(6)

Algorithm 1 shows the ranking process of Soft-
LeadSum, during which the visitor walks on G
following WALK-1 and WALK-2 alternately. The
fact that WALK-1 is ergodic ensures the ergodicity
and convergency of the algorithm. In implemen-
tation, we set max iteration N=1000 empirically
which is large enough to ensure convergence, or
stop random walk process in advance when the
condition of convergence is met, i.e., the change
of Euclidean difference of ranking scores for three
consecutive iterations are all less than 1e-6.

Soft-LeadSum can reduce the impact of errors
made by leader detection on summarization due to
the following two reasons: 1) It allows all mes-
sages to participate in ranking process, thus per-
mits those leaders leaving out by leader detec-
tion module to be selected into summary; 2) With

5 Experiments and Results

To evaluate the two modules in our repost tree
summarization system, i.e., CRF-based model for
leader detection and LeadSum model for summa-
rization, we conducted two sets of experiments
based on microblog posts data collected from Sina
Weibo, which has a similar market penetration
as Twitter (Rapoza, 2011)2. Microblog messages
on Sina Weibo are in Chinese and we use Fu-
danNLP (Qiu et al., 2013) for text preprocessing
including word segmentation and POS tagging.

5.1 Experiment for Leader Detection
In this experiment, we evaluated the performance
of CRF model for leader detection task.

5.1.1 Data Collection and Setup
We first crawled 1,300 different repost trees us-
ing the public PKUVIS toolkit (Ren et al., 2014).
Given an original microblog post, the toolkit can
automatically crawl its complete repost tree. For
each tree, we randomly selected one path and fur-
ther formed a set with 1,300 repost tree paths,

which ensures that paths have different roots and
the dataset can cover a wide variety of context in-
formation.

Then three annotators were invited to label each
repost as a leader or a follower in the context of
its repost tree path independently. The average
Cohen’s Kappa of each two of the three annota-
tors was 0.52, which is considered good agree-
ment (Fleiss et al., 2013). Then, we used the labels
agreed by at least two annotators as the ground
truth. The training and test of the leader detection
models were conducted on this corpus.

We compared the performance of CRF-based
leader detection model with four baselines: Ran-
dom Classifier (RC) as a weak baseline; two state-
of-the-art point-wise supervised models Logis-
tic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine
(SVM); and an effective context sensitive model
SVMhmm. We applied LibLinear toolkit (Fan et
al., 2008) to implement LR and SVM with linear
kernel. SVMhmm was implemented by SVMstruct

toolkit (Joachims et al., 2009). And CRF’s im-
plementation was based on CRF++3. For all the
baselines, we used features listed in Table 1. The
hyper-parameters of all leader detection models
were tuned to the same extent based on 5-fold
cross validation (with 1 fold as development set).
The evaluation metrics were precision, recall and
F1 score for the detected leaders.

5.1.2 Results
Table 2 shows the comparison result of 5-fold
cross validation on 1,000 repost tree paths and
held-out experiment on 300 complete fresh paths.

Among all baselines, SVMhmm performed the
best, which indicates the effectiveness of incor-
porating structure information for leader detec-
tion. And among context-sensitive models, both
SVMhmm and CRF were competitive. CRF out-
performed SVMhmm slightly with 5.6% and 1.7%
improved F1 score in cross validation and held-out

experiments, respectively. In spite of their compa-
rable performance, our framework applies CRF in-
stead of SVMhmm for leader detection because of
its probabilistic nature, which can be exploited by
the sampling process in Soft-LeadSum to reduce
the propagation of classification error to the sum-
marization stage. Section 5.2.2 shows the relevant
experiment.

5.2 Experiment for Summarization

In this experiment, we evaluated end-to-end per-
formance of our basic and soft LeadSum summa-
rization models by comparing them with state-of-
the-art microblog summarizers.

5.2.1 Data Collection and Evaluation Metrics
There is no public editorial repost tree dataset.
Therefore, we manually selected 10 hot events tak-
ing place during January 2nd – July 28th 2014, and
then used the PKUVIS toolkit (Ren et al., 2014) to
crawl the complete repost trees for all the events
given the corresponding original posts. Table 3
shows the details about the repost tree corpus4.
Note that this repost tree corpus has no overlap
with the repost tree path dataset for learning leader
detection models in Section 5.1.1.

After that, we invited three experienced editors
to write summaries for each repost tree. To en-
sure the quality of reference summaries, we first
extracted a list of frequent nouns from each repost
tree and generalized 7 to 10 topics based on the
nouns list, which provided a high-level overview
of a repost tree to editors. Then, our guideline
required editors to read all repost microblogs or-
dered sequentially on a repost tree. For every mes-
sage, its entire repost tree path was also provided
as supplementary context information. When fin-
ished reading, editors wrote down one or two sen-
tences to summarize each topic in the list.

We utilized ROUGE-N metric (Lin, 2004) for
benchmark, which is a standard for evaluating
automatic summaries based on N-gram overlap-
ping between a generated summary and a ref-
erence. Specifically, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2
F1-measure were used as our evaluation metrics.
Lin et al. (2004) has demonstrated that ROUGE-2
correlates well with humans in summarizing for-
mal texts. And ROUGE-1 is a better alternative
in evaluating summaries for short and informal

microblog messages (Inouye and Kalita, 2011;
Chang et al., 2013).

In our human-generated summaries, the average
inter-annotator-agreement by ROUGE-1 is 0.431,
which means each pair of manual summaries have
no more than 50% words overlap on average even
written under topic constraints. This indicates that
microblog repost tree summarization is generally
a difficult task. The reason is that repost trees
have complex structure, and editors could hardly
reconstruct the repost trees even though they went
through all the microblogs. Therefore, in eval-
uation for each tree, we computed the average
ROUGE F1 score between the model-generated
summary and the three human-generated sum-
maries.

5.2.2 Results
In each automatic summarizer, we selected the
top-10 ranked reposts to form a summary. We
compared the end-to-end performance with the
following baseline systems:
• RandSum: RandSum is a weak baseline that

randomly selects reposts into summaries.
• RepSum: RepSum ranks and selects mes-

sages simply by their reposts count, i.e., the size
of their subtrees, based on reposting relations.
• UserRankSum: UserRankSum ranks and

selects reposts by their authors’ follower count
based on user following relations.
• LeadProSum: LeadProSum ranks and se-

lects reposting messages by their marginal prob-
abilities as leaders determined by our CRF-based
leader detection model.
• SVDSum: SVDSum adopts the Singular

Value Decomposition (SVD) to discover hidden
sub-topics for summarization (Gong and Liu,
2001). Reposting messages are ranked accord-
ing to latent semantic analysis with SVD on term-
message matrix.
• DivRankSum: DivRankSum directly ap-

plies DivRank (Mei et al., 2010) algorithm to rank
all messages unaware of leaders and followers. A
similar model is also reported in Yan et al. (2011).
Following their work, we set damping weight as
0.85.
• UserInfSum: Chang et al. (2013) ranks mes-

sages utilizing Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
(GBDT) algorithm with text, popularity, tempo-
ral and user influence signals to summarize Twit-
ter context tree. In particular, without the interac-
tion data with external users, we utilize users’ fol-

lower count to approximate user influence. GBDT
implementation is based on RankLib5, and as a
supervised method, UserInfSum is evaluated with
10-fold cross validation.

In addition, we observed that SVMhmm is a
competitive baseline for leader detection (see Ta-
ble 2). So we also study its impact on the Basic-
LeadSum model. Note that SVMhmm cannot be
combined with Soft-LeadSum since it is not prob-
abilistic.

Table 4 shows the result of overall comparisons.
We have the following observations:
• RepSum utilized trivial structure informa-

tion, i.e., the size of sub-tree, and its performance
was poor, which was even worse than RandSum
on ROUGE-2. This implies that messages with a
lot of reposts may not be good candidates as other
reasons may lead to their popularity, e.g., a good
posting time or sense of humor.
• UserRankSum performed the best on

ROUGE-1&2 among all baseline summarizers,
which confirms that user following relations
can indeed be a strong signal in microblog
summarization. UserRankSum is even slightly

5http://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/
RankLib/

better than Basic-LeadSum on ROUGE-2. But, it
does not perform consistently well for all repost
trees, evidenced as the large standard deviation
on ROUGE-1&2. This suggests that the user
following relations cannot always effectively
indicate salient candidates. It may not work for
repost trees where authors have similar number
of following users, or reposts of influential users
contain nothing salient.
• LeadProSum achieved the second best per-

formance among all unsupervised baselines,
which indicates that the marginal probabilities as
leaders can signal good summary candidates. This
also confirms that leaders contain salient contents
and should be distinguished from followers in
summarization.
• Utilizing either SVMhmm or CRF as leader

detection model to filter out followers, Basic-
LeadSum almost doubled the ROUGE-1 and
tripled the ROUGE-2 scores compared to Di-
vRankSum’s performance. This indicates that dif-
ferentiating leaders and followers is very helpful
to summarization.
• Basic-LeadSum performed better than all

baselines on ROUGE-1&2 except for a marginal
drop compared to UserRankSum on ROUGE-2.
But the differences with UserRankSum, LeadPro-
Sum and UserInfSum are not statistically signif-
icant. This may be ascribed to the error propa-
gated from leader detection module to summariza-
tion process.
• Soft-LeadSum outperformed all the baselines

with a large margin on ROUGE-1&2, including
supervised summarizer UserInfSum. The one-
tailed pairwise t-test indicates that all the improve-
ments over baselines are significant at the 95%
confidence level except for UserRankSum with
90% confidence level on ROUGE-2. This con-
firms the effectiveness of our framework for pro-
ducing high-quality repost tree summaries.
• The supervised model UserInfSum did not

perform quite well. The reason is that the model
needs large amount of user interaction data exter-
nal to the tree which are not readily available, and
also it might be overfitting to the limited number
of training instances.
• Basic-LeadSum with CRF and SVMhmm

had very close ROUGE-1&2 scores. Basic-
LeadSum+SVMhmm is even slightly better than
Basic-LeadSum+CRF. Though SVMhmm was
marginally worse in leader detection experiment
(Table 2), we can conclude that SVMhmm is
a comparable alternative as the leader detection
module for Basic-LeadSum.
• Among our models, Soft-LeadSum signif-

icantly outperformed both Basic-LeadSum with
CRF and that with SVMhmm. This implies that
sampling steps in the enhanced random walk of
Soft-LeadSum is effective in reducing the impact
of leader detection error on summarization.

5.3 Discussion
From Table 4, we observed that user following re-
lations used by UserRankSum is a strong signal
for microblog summarization. A natural question
is: “Can the user following relations commonly
used for modeling user influence be complemen-
tary to the content-level structure information used
in our summariztaion models?”

We thus linearly combine the normalized rank-
ing scores of LeadSum and UserRankSum using
the formula α∗u+(1−α)∗l, where u and l denote
the UserRankSum and LeadSum ranking scores,
respectively. Figure 2 demonstrates the impact of
α on our basic and soft LeadSum model with CRF.

Clearly, Basic-LeadSum can benefit from user
influence information by incorporating User-
RankSum scores into it. From the incremental
trend of summarization performance with the in-
crease of α for α ∈ [0, 0.9], we can conclude

that user influence is helpful to it. This is because
Basic-LeadSum is not sufficiently robust to the er-
rors cascaded from leader detection module, thus
user-level structures can have the chance to com-
pensate these errors for content-level structures.

Incorporating the same information into Soft-
LeadSum cannot improve its performance regard-
less of the value of α. This implies that content-
level structures, i.e., message content and repost-
ing relations together, are better indicative of good
summary candidates. When these features are ap-
propriately modeled by Soft-LeadSum, user in-
fluence, a traditionally well-known strong signal,
cannot provide extra benefit at all.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

This work presents a study for microblog repost
tree summarization, whose output can provide im-
portant clues for event analysis on microblog-
ging platforms. Conventional works considering
only plain text streams is insufficient to summa-
rize noisy repost trees. We propose a novel sum-
marization system by effectively differentiating
leader and follower messages on repost tree based
on content-level structure information. Firstly, a
leader detection model categorizes each repost on
repost tree path as a leader or a follower. Then, a
random-walk variant summarization model called
LeadSum is proposed to rank and select salient
microblog messages on the basis of leader de-
tection result. To reduce errors cascaded from
leader detection, we enhance LeadSum based on
an even-length random walk by sampling from
leader probabilities for improving summarization.
Based on real-world microblog post dataset, the
experimental results confirm that our proposed
framework is effective for repost tree summariza-
tion by the end-to-end comparison with the state-
of-the-art baselines.

Constrained by the amount of annotation, we
adopt this two-step framework and an unsuper-
vised summarization algorithm. With the develop-
ment of our corpora, we plan to explore the useful-
ness of supervised structure learning approaches,
such as tree-structured CRF (Tang et al., 2006;
Mensink et al., 2013), to integrate leader detec-
tion and summarization into a unified framework,
and make global inference for important leaders
by capturing various non-linear dependencies.
