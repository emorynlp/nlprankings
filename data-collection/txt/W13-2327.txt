Abstract 

In this paper we present the development of a 
corpus of French newswire texts annotated 
with enunciative and modal commitment in-
formation. The annotation scheme we propose 
is based on the detection of predicative cues - 
referring to an enunciative and/or modal varia-
tion - and their scope at a sentence level. We 
describe how we have improved our annota-
tion guideline by using the evaluation (in 
terms of precision, recall and F-Measure) of a 
first round of annotation produced by two ex-
pert annotators and by our automatic annota-
tion system. 

1 Introduction 

This paper concerns the design of a reference 
corpus that can be used to evaluate an automatic 
annotation system of enunciative and modal 
commitment in newswire texts in French. This 
complex linguistic phenomenon refers to the fact 
that a situation can be presented as certain, or 
only possible/probable, by an enunciator who can 
be the author of the text but who can also be an-
other enunciator (explicitly named or not) from 
whom the author reports some content that he has 
heard, read, imagined, etc. Different kinds of lin-
guistic cues are involved. In addition to the need 
to identify and semantically classify these cues, 
one has to deal with the question of their scope. 
This question is even more complex as many 
cues can be present together in a sentence, thus 
complexifying the interpretation of the interac-
tion of different scopes (see Example 1.). 
 

1. M. Arabi a exprimécue1 [le souhaitcue2 [d’aider la 
Syrie à surmonter cette phase]scope2]scope1] // [Mr. 
Arabi expressedcue1 [a desirecue2 [to help Syria 
overcome this phase.]scope2]scope1 
 

Another major difficulty concerns the fact 
that evidential and modal characteristics are very 
similar (see for example a noun like desire). Our 
work addresses the question of annotating these 
cues and their semantic scope. Unlike most other 
approaches, we have chosen not to treat these 

two kinds of characteristics separately, since 
both are implicated in what is called enunciative 
commitment. We will focus here on our practice 
for the development of a reference corpus.  

After a brief presentation of the theoretical 
background (section 2), we describe which kinds 
of linguistic cues are considered and what kind 
of semantic scopes are then encountered (section 
3). Our annotation procedure aims to delimit tex-
tual segments that are semantically impacted by 
the presence of enunciative and modal cues. In 
this light, we will focus only on what we will 
describe below as predicative cues. Then we will 
explain how we have improved our annotation 
guideline by using the evaluation of a first round 
of annotation produced for the same task by two 
expert annotators and by our automatic annota-
tion system (section 4). 

2 The phenomenon of enunciative and 
modal commitment  

In the field of linguistics, the notion of modality 
can be considered from an enunciative perspec-
tive (see Bally, 1932 Benveniste, 1966; Culioli, 
1973). From this perspective, which is the one 
we adopt here, the construction of an utterance 
(or a text) has to take into account certain lan-
guage operations such as predication or opera-
tions of commitment, the expression of which 
leaves a certain number of surface linguistic 
traces (or cues). The enunciator’s degree of 
commitment to a predicative content is marked 
in the utterance by different kinds of linguistic 
traces. In other words, it can be said that in dis-
course the enunciator expresses different degrees 
of commitment to the truth of the propositional 
content.  

Very close to this issue is thus the long tradi-
tion of tracking veridicality in discourse. Wheth-
er – in the most recent work - under the term of 
“factuality degrees of events” (Sauri and 
Pustejovsky, 2012), “event veridicality” (De 
Marneffe et al., 2012), “detection of uncertainty” 
(CoNLL-2010 Shared Task) or “attributions” and 

223



“private states” (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), this 
notion refers to the relationship between lan-
guage and reader commitment. In our approach, 
we do not attempt to access the notion of veridi-
cality directly but rather via the organization of 
the text into different textual segments that have 
different enunciative and modal validation con-
texts. However, the cues we have to take into 
account to achieve this goal are mostly the same 
as in veridicality studies (modal verbs, reported 
speech verbs, verb of propositional attitude, 
hedging adverbs, and so on). Moreover, beyond 
traditional lexical cues, we also include in our 
work other cues such as morphological inflection 
(e.g. inflection of the French conditional tense), 
syntactic constructions such as subordinate 
clauses of condition or prepositional construc-
tions (e.g. according to X, at first sight…). Fur-
thermore, we have to take into account the fact 
that a lot of cues are embedded (as seen in Ex-
ample 1 with express and a desire). If we want to 
interpret the enunciative and modal context of 
the textual segment to help Syria overcome this 
phase, we have to consider the fact that it is em-
bedded in the segment a desire to help Syria 
overcome this phase. From this point of view our 
work is related to Kilicoglu (2012) who studied 
“embedding predications”. Thus, we do not only 
consider the type of cues we find in text but also 
the way they interact. This methodology also 
enables us to consider cues that play a role at a 
discursive level. This question of discursive 
markers is discussed in (Charolles et al., 2005). 

Although modality markers in French - in 
their close relationship with the markers of evi-
dentiality - have been systematically described 
(see for example Gosselin, 2010; Le Querler, 
2004) there is still no reference corpus proposing 
the annotation of enunciative and modal charac-
teristics as a discursive delimitation task and this 
is the goal we seek to achieve. This problem of 
identifying modal cues related to a scope was 
initially researched in biomedical texts (Vincze 
et al., 2008). This applicative task made it possi-
ble to renew the linguistic approach to modality 
by adopting a more concrete approach, focusing 
first on the variety of cues that can be identified 
in a text. This perspective also enables the issue 
of the influence of textual genre on modality 
markers to be addressed. 

In the next section, we present the way we 
propose to annotate this enunciative and modal 
commitment variation in text in terms of cues 
and scopes. 

3 Annotating enunciative and modal 
commitment in term of cues and scope  

Our annotation goal is to define in which enunci-
ative and modal context a propositional content 
occurs. Observation of the cues in our corpus 
showed that there are two kinds of cues: predica-
tive cues that lead to the opening of a new textual 
segment (this kind of cue has the syntactic prop-
erty of governing another textual segment, e.g. 
cue1 in Example 2.) and what we called modifier 
cues (mainly adverbs and some adjectives, e.g. 
cue2 in Example 2.). The identification of pre-
dicative cues (and their scope) leads to split the 
text into different textual segments and then the 
identification of modifier cues influence the vali-
dation context of the textual segment previously 
identified.  
 

2. Paul veutcue1 sûrementcue2 que [Mary vienne.] 
scope // Paul certainly

cue1 wantscue2 [Mary to 
come] scope. 
 

The annotation task we present here consists 
in annotating these predicative cues (that lead to 
modify the level of enunciative and/or modal 
commitment of a textual segment) and their 
scope. The scope of a predicative cue corre-
sponds to the textual segment impacted by the 
variation in the level of enunciative and/or modal 
commitment. Table 1 presents the four classes of 
predicative cues that we consider and for each of 
them gives some examples of the syntactic com-
ponents that can be under the scope of the cue.

scope / According to Paul

cue, [Mary 
is coming] scope

As can be seen, depending on the type of pre-
dicative cue, the syntactic dependents we consid-
er in the scope vary. This description of what we 
consider as a predicative cue and how to delimit 
the corresponding scope is reported in the first 
version of an annotation guideline. In order to 
refine our descriptions and measure their rele-
vance on the corpus, the following section pre-
sents the inter-annotator agreement between two 
expert annotators and the first results of the au-
tomatic system for the same annotation task. This 
evaluation process should lead to the production 
of a more precise guideline that can reveal fine 
discursive shades and also stimulate reflection on 
how best to deal with syntactic and semantic in-
formation in the automatic annotation system. 

4 Annotation and evaluation process 

Our final goal is to develop an automatic annota-
tion system that produces the annotation of 
enunciative and modal cues and their scope in 
newswire texts. In this light, we have to build a 
guideline of our annotation aim and a reference 
corpus that can be used to evaluate the system.  

 
Figure 1.Workflow of guideline improvement 

 

 

Figure 1 illustrates the steps in the workflow 
applied to improve our annotation guideline. For 
this purpose, two annotators (henceforth A1 and 
A2), both of them experts in linguistics, worked 
together to build a guideline and then the refer-
ence corpus1. First of all, the two annotators de-
fined the annotation goals together (see step 1 in 
Figure 1). Then they annotated separately a cor-
pus of 20 newswire texts (see step 2a in Figure 
3). This corpus contains 256 predicative cues and 
their associated scopes (see Table 2).

1 Our annotation process is based on Morante and 
Daelemans (2012). 

 

This manual annotation task was carried out 
using the Glozz Annotation Tool (Widlöcher and 
Mathet, 2012) that relies on the URS (Unit-
Relation-Schema) meta model and produces an 
xml output. The model permits to annotate textu-
al units that can be embedded or not (in our case 
the predicative cues and their scope) and rela-
tions (for us, the opening relation links the pre-
dicative cue to its scope).  
 

After this first annotation round, inter-
annotator agreement was calculated (see table 3). 
The results show that the agreement between the 
two annotators is high for the cues but not very 
good for the scopes. By comparing the two sets 
of annotations in detail, we observed in our cor-
pus that some textual segments can be either in-
cluded or excluded from the scope depending on 
the annotator’s interpretation. Example (3) shows 
the scope annotation proposed by annotator A1. 
As we can see, the textual segment qui a débuté 
lundi is included in the scope by this annotator 
but it is excluded in the annotation proposed by 
A2. In this particular case, we consider that both 
interpretations are acceptable since we cannot 
say for sure if this segment is presented from the 
viewpoint of the journalist or from the viewpoint 
of the source un de ses avocats. The same phe-
nomenon is often observed with temporal adver-
bials that cannot be interpreted unambiguously as 
being a part of the scope or not. In these two 
kinds of cases the annotator needs to use the con-
text and his linguistic background to decide. This 
raises the issue - already mentioned in Farkas et 
al. (2010) – as to whether it is advisable to set a 
strict boundary for the scope. 

We propose to address this issue by evaluat-
ing the scope annotation both strictly and more 
flexibly. In the flexible interpretation we distin-
guish the segments that are detected with an ex-
act match boundary from those that are detected 
with different boundaries but that are still correct 
in the interpretation (as in example 3).

blogueur égyptien arrêté pour avoir critiqué l'ar-
mée, qui a débuté lundi, a été ajourné à di-
manche]scope, a indiqué

cue mardi un de ses avocats. 
// [The trial before a military court of an Egyptian 
blogger arrested for criticizing the army, which 
began on Monday, has been postponed to Sun-
day]scope, said

cue one of his lawyers on Tuesday. 
 
 

To measure the distinction of using strict or 
flexible boundaries for scope, we propose to dis-
tinguish the scope evaluation (for strict scope 
boundaries) from the weighted scope evaluation 
(for flexible boundaries).  

225



Flexible boundaries are calculated with a 0.5 fac-
tor as follows: 

��������		
������ �
�� � 0.5	 � ��

���
 

��������	������ �
�� � 0.5	 � ��

���
 

• SB (strict boundaries): the number of enti-
ties with a strict scope boundary 

• FB (flexible boundaries): the number of 
entities with a flexible scope boundary 

• Ref: the number of reference entities (i.e. 
ideally identified) 

• Rel: the number of relevant entities (i.e. 
correctly identified) 
 

The distinction between the evaluation of 
scope and weighted scope revealed that in a sig-
nificant number of cases (in this experimentation 
about 10 %) the two annotators disagreed in their 
annotation but that both interpretations were cor-
rect. This observation helped us to rethink our 
annotation goals and based on the result of inter-
annotator agreement, the two annotators pro-
duced a common adjudicated version of their 
annotation2 (step 4 in Figure 1). This new anno-
tated version is the result of a reflection on the 
two annotators’ disagreements and considers the 
context to delimit scope boundaries.

Table 4: System evaluation: annotations from the sys-
tem are evaluated against the adjudicated version  

 

In a second step, we evaluated the first anno-
tation version of our automatic system (step 2b in 
Figure 1) on a subset of the corpus against the 
annotation of the adjudicated version (see table 
4). The subset corpus contains 100 cues and their 
associated scopes. Our automatic annotation sys-
tem is based on the analysis dependency syntac-
tic parser combined with scope detection rules 
(see Battistelli and Damiani, 2013). The results

of this evaluation show that the detection of cues 
is good, as with the manual annotation, while the 
scope detection is not as good. This can be ex-
plained partly by the fact that the syntactic parser 
analysis produces some analysis errors (tagging 
or parsing errors, wrong syntactic attachment 
especially with coordinating conjunctions). 
Moreover, this evaluation shows that with an 
automatic system, distinguishing strict and flexi-
ble boundaries can highlight the results in anoth-
er way. Indeed, if we look at the scope evalua-
tion, the F-measure is not really satisfactory. If 
we take into account only this measure, it could 
be concluded that our system is not efficient. 
However, with the measure of weighted scope 
we see that while in many cases the scope did not 
match exactly with the reference corpus, it was 
not wrong either. This phenomenon of scope 
boundaries that are not easily decidable repre-
sents 10% of disagreement in the IAA (ie 22 cas-
es) and 30% in the system evaluation (ie 33 cas-
es), and has to be taken into account to improve 
the guideline and the annotation system. This 
first annotation experiment on a small corpus 
helped us to define new annotation goals that 
must be integrated both in the new version of the 
guideline (step 6 in Figure 1) and in the automat-
ic annotation system.  

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we have focused on a methodology 
to produce a reference corpus proposing the an-
notation of enunciative and modal commitment 
information as a discursive delimitation task. The 
annotation scheme we propose is based on the 
detection of predicative cues and their scopes. 
The results of the evaluation presented here show 
that the most challenging task is not to find the 
predicative cues but to delimit their scopes and 
beyond this delimitation question to define how 
to assess whether a scope is correct or not. Next 
step of our work is to launch a larger annotation 
campaign involving more human annotators and 
a bigger corpus. In this second step, our model 
will integrate modifier cues such as hedging ad-
verbs that modify the semantic value of the tex-
tual segments that have been first delimited and 
introduce discursive cues that can impact more 
than a single sentence At last, in order to make 
our work available for the community our guide-
line and reference corpus will soon be available 
on Chronolines project website3.
