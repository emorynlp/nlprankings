The goal of the task is to detect and analyze the 

event contents in real world Chinese news texts. It 
consists of finding key verbs or verb phrases to 
describe these events in the Chinese sentences af-
ter word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging, 
selecting suitable situation descriptions for them, 
and anchoring different situation arguments with 
suitable syntactic chunks in the sentence. Three 
main sub-tasks are as follows: (1) Target verb 
WSD; (2) Sentence SRL; (3) Event detection. 

We will select 100 high-frequency Chinese tar-
get verbs for this task. Among them, 30 verbs have 
multiple senses and 70 verbs have single sense. 
Each target verb will be assigned more than 50 
annotated sentences to consist of training and test 
sets. Each annotated sentence will have following 
event information: (1) word segmentation and POS 
tags; (2) the target verb (or verb phrase) and its 
position in the sentence; (3) the event description 
(situation description formula or natural explana-
tion text) of the target verb (or verb phrase) in the 
context of the sentences; (4) the chunks annotated 
with suitable syntactic constituent tags, functional 
tags and event argument role tags. The training 
and test set will be extracted from the data set with 
ratio 8:2.  

 For the WSD subtask, we give two evalua-
tion measures: WSD-Micro-Accuracy and WSD-
Macro-Accuracy. The correct conditions are: the 
selected situation description formula and natural 
explanation text of the target verbs will be same 

with the gold-standard codes. We evaluated 27 
multiple-sense target verbs in the test set. 

For the SRL subtask, we give three evaluation 
measures: Chunk-Precision, Chunk-Recall, and 
Chunk-F-measure. The correct conditions are: the 
recognized chunks should have the same bounda-
ries, syntactic constituent and functional tags, and 
situation argument tags with the gold-standard ar-
gument chunks of the key verbs or verb phrases. 
We only select the key argument chunks (with se-
mantic role tags: x, y, z, L or O) for evaluation. 

For the event detection subtask, we give two 
evaluation measures: Event-Micro-Accuracy and 
Event-Macro-Accuracy. The correct conditions 
are: (1) The event situation description formula 
and natural explanation text of the target verb 
should be same with the gold-standard ones; (2) 
All the argument chunks of the event descriptions 
should be same with the gold-standard ones; (3) 
The number of the recognized argument chunks 
should be same with the gold-standard one. 

8 participants downloaded the training and test 
data. Only 3 participants uploaded the final results. 
Among them, 1 participant (User ID = 156) sub-
mitted 4 results and 1 participant (User ID = 485) 
submitted 2 results. So we received 7 uploaded 
results for evaluation. The mean elaboration time 
of the test data is about 30 hours. The following is 
the evaluation result table. All the results are 
ranked with Event-Macro-Accuracy.

156 349 79.82 82.58 58.33 53.32 55.71 20.05 20.14 7 

The results show the event detection task is still an open problem for exploring in the Chinese language.
