Abstract

In this paper we present preliminary exper-
iments that aim to reduce lexical data spar-
sity in statistical parsing by exploiting infor-
mation about named entities. Words in the
WSJ corpus are mapped to named entity clus-
ters and a latent variable constituency parser
is trained and tested on the transformed cor-
pus. We explore two different methods for
mapping words to entities, and look at the ef-
fect of mapping various subsets of named en-
tity types. Thus far, results show no improve-
ment in parsing accuracy over the best base-
line score; we identify possible problems and
outline suggestions for future directions.

1 Introduction

Techniques for handling lexical data sparsity in
parsers have been important ever since the lexical-
isation of parsers led to significant improvements
in parser performance (Collins, 1999; Charniak,
2000). The original treebank set of non-terminal la-
bels is too general to give good parsing results. To
overcome this problem, in lexicalised constituency
parsers, non-terminals are enriched with lexical in-
formation. Lexicalisation of the grammar vastly
increases the number of parameters in the model,
spreading the data over more specific events. Statis-
tics based on low frequency events are not as reliable
as statistics on phenomena which occur regularly in
the data; frequency counts involving words are typi-
cally sparse.

Word statistics are also important in more re-
cent unlexicalised approaches to constituency pars-
ing such as latent variable parsing (Matsuzaki et al.,

2005; Petrov et al., 2006). The basic idea of latent
variable parsing is that rather than enrich the non-
terminal labels by augmenting them with words, a
set of enriched labels which can encapsulate the syn-
tactic behaviour of words is automatically learned
via an EM training mechanism.

Parsers need to be able to handle both low fre-
quency words and words occurring in the test set
which were unseen in the training set (unknown
words). The problem of rare and unknown words is
particularly significant for languages where the size
of the treebank is small. Lexical sparseness is also
critical when running a parser on data that is in a dif-
ferent domain to the domain upon which the parser
was trained. As interest in parsing real world data
increases, a parsers ability to adequately handle out-
of-domain data is critical.

In this paper we examine whether clustering
words based on their named entity category can be
useful for reducing lexical sparsity in parsing. In-
tuitively word tokens in the corpus such as, say,
‘Dublin’ and ‘New York’ should play similar syn-
tactic roles in sentences. Likewise, it is difficult to
see how different people names could have differ-
ent discriminatory influences on the syntax of sen-
tences. This paper describes experiments at replac-
ing word tokens with special named entity tokens
(person names are mapped to PERSON tokens and
so on). Words in the original WSJ treebank are
mapped to entity types extracted from the BBN cor-
pus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) and a latent
variable parser is trained and tested on the mapped
corpus. Ultimately, the motivation behind grouping
words together in this fashion is to make it easier for

14



the parser to recognise regularities in the data.1

The structure of paper is as follows: A brief sum-
mary of related work is given in Section 2. This
includes an outline of a common treatment of low
frequency and rare words in constituency parsing,
involving a mapping process that is similar to the
named entity mappings. Section 3 presents the ex-
periments carried out, starting with a short introduc-
tion of the named entity resource used in our exper-
iments and a description of the types of basic entity
mappings we examine. In §3.1 and §3.2 we describe
the two different types of mapping technique. Re-
sults are presented in Section 4, followed by a brief
discussion in Section 5 indicating possible problems
and avenues worth pursuing. Finally, we conclude.

2 Related Work

Much previous work on parsing and multiword units
(MWUs) adopts the words-with-spaces approach
which treats MWUs as one token (by concatenat-
ing the words together) (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004;
Cafferkey et al., 2007; Korkontzelos and Manand-
har, 2010). Alternative approaches are that of Finkel
and Manning (2009) on joint parsing and named en-
tity recognition and the work of (Wehrli et al., 2010)
which uses collocation information to rank compet-
ing hypotheses in a symbolic parser. Also related
is work on MWUs and grammar engineering, such
as (Zhang et al., 2006; Villavicencio et al., 2007)
where automatically detected MWUs are added to
the lexicon of a HPSG grammar to improve cover-
age.

Our work is most similar to the words-with-
spaces approach. Our many-to-one experiments
(see §3.1) in particular are similar to previous
work on parsing words-with-spaces, except that we
map words to entity types rather than concatenated
words. Results are difficult to compare however, due
to different parsing methodologies, different types
of MWUs, as well as different evaluation methods.

Other relevant work is the integration of named

1It is true that latent variable parsers automatically induce
categories for similar words, and thus might be expected to
induce a category for say names of people if examples of
such words occurred in similar syntactic patterns in the data.
Nonetheless, the problem of data sparsity remains - it is diffi-
cult even for latent variable parsers to learn accurate patterns
based on words which only occur say once in the training set.

entity types in a surface realisation task by Rajku-
mar et al. (2009) and the French parsing experiments
of (Candito and Crabbé, 2009; Candito and Sed-
dah, 2010) which involve mapping words to clusters
based on morphology as well as clusters automati-
cally induced via unsupervised learning on a large
corpus.

2.1 Parsing unknown words

Most state-of-the-art constituency parsers (e.g.
(Petrov et al., 2006; Klein and Manning, 2003))
take a similar approach to rare and unknown words.
At the beginning of the training process very low
frequency words in the training set are mapped to
special UNKNOWN tokens. In this way, some
probability mass is reserved for occurrences of UN-
KNOWN tokens and the lexicon contains produc-
tions for such tokens (X → UNKNOWN), with as-
sociated probabilities. When faced with a word in
the test set that the parser has not seen in its train-
ing set - the unknown word is mapped to the special
UNKNOWN token.

In syntactic parsing, rather than map all low fre-
quency words to one generic UNKNOWN type, it
is useful to have several different clusters of un-
known words, grouped according to morphologi-
cal and other ‘surfacey’ clues in the original word.
For example, certain suffixes in English are strong
predictors for the part-of-speech tag of the word
(e.g. ‘ly’) and so all low frequency words end-
ing in ‘ly’ are mapped to ‘UNKNOWN-ly’. As
well as suffix information, UNKNOWN words are
commonly grouped based on information on capi-
talisation and hyphenation. Similar techniques for
handling unknown words have been used for POS
tagging (e.g. (Weischedel et al., 1993; Tseng et
al., 2005)) and are used in the Charniak (Char-
niak, 2000), Berkeley (Petrov et al., 2006) and Stan-
ford (Klein and Manning, 2003) parsers, as well as
in the parser used for the experiments in this paper,
an in-house implementation of the Berkeley parser.

Table 1: Name expression entity types (sections 02-21)

tion for three classes of named entity: name expres-
sions, time expressions and numeric expressions (in
this paper we focus on name expressions). These
are further broken down into types. Table 1 displays
name expression entity types, their frequency in the
training set (sections 02-21), as well as some illus-
trative examples from the training set data.

We carried out experiments with different subsets
of entity types. In one set of experiments, all name
expression entities were mapped, with no restriction
on the types (ALL NAMED). We also carried
out experiments on a reduced set of named entities
- where only entities marked as PERSON, ORGA-
NIZATION, or GPE and LOCATION were mapped
(REDUCED). Finally, we ran experiments where
only one type of named entity was mapped at a time.
In all cases the words in the named entities were re-
placed by their entity type.

3.1 Many-to-one Mapping

In the many-to-one mapping all words in a named
entity were replaced with one named entity type
token. This approach is distinct from the words-
with-spaces approach previously pursued in parsing
where, for example, ‘New York’ would be replaced
with ‘New York’. Instead, in our experiments ‘New
York’ is replaced with ‘GPE’ (geo-political entity).
In both approaches, the parser is forced to respect

the multiword unit boundary (and analyses which
contain constituents that cross the MWU boundary
will not be considered by the parser). Intuitively,
this should help parser accuracy and speed. The ad-
vantage of mapping the word tokens to their entity
type rather than to a words-with-spaces token is that
in addition we will be reducing data sparsity.

One issue with the many-to-one mapping is that
in evaluation exact comparison with a baseline re-
sult is difficult because the tokenisation of test and
gold sets is different. When named entities span
more than one word, we are reducing the number
of words in the sentences. As parsers tend to do bet-
ter on short sentences than on long sentences, this
could make parsing somewhat easier. However, we
found that the average number of words in a sen-
tence before and after this mapping does not change
by much. The average number of words in the devel-
opment set is 23.9. When we map words to named
entity tokens (ALL NAMED), the average drops
by just one word to 22.9.2

3.2 One-to-one Mapping

In the one-to-one experiments we replaced each
word in named entity with a named entity type to-
ken (e.g. Ada Lovelace → pperson pperson).3 The
motivation was to measure the effect of reducing
word sparsity using named entities without altering
the original tokenisation of the data.4

2A related issue is that the resulting parse tree will lack an
analysis for the named entity.

3The entity type was given an extra letter where needed (e.g.
‘pperson’) to avoid the conflation of a mapped entity token with
an original word (e.g. ‘person’) in the corpus.

4Note, where there is punctuation as part of a named entity
we do not map the punctuation.

Table 3: One-to-One Parsing Results

In an initial experiment, where the mapping was
simply the word to the named entity type, many sen-
tences received no parse. This happened often when
a named entity consisted of three or more words and
resulted in a sentence such as ‘But while the Oor-
ganization Oorganization Oorganization Oorganiza-
tion did n’t fall apart Friday’. We found that refining
the named entity by adding the number of the word
in the entity to the mapping resolved the coverage
problem. The example sentence is now: ‘But while
the Oorganization1 Oorganization2 Oorganization3
Oorganization4 did n’t fall apart Friday’. See §5 for
a possible explanation for the parser’s difficulty with
one-to-one mappings to coarse grained entity types.

4 Results

Table 2 and Table 3 give the results for the many-to-
one and one-to-one experiments respectively. Re-
sults are given against a baseline where unknowns
are given a ‘generic’ treatment (baseline 1) - i.e.
they are not clustered according to morphological
and surface information - and for the second baseline
(baseline 2), where morphological or surface feature
markers (sigs) are affixed to the unknowns.5

The results indicate that though lexical spar-
sity is decreasing, insofar as the number of un-
known words (#unks column) in the development
set decreases with all named entity mappings, the
named entity clusters are not informative enough
and parser accuracy falls short of the previous best
result. For all experiments, a pattern that emerges

5For all experiments, a split-merge cycle of 5 was used. Fol-
lowing convention, sections 02-21 were used for training. Sec-
tions 22 and 24 (sentences less than or equal to 100 words) were
used for the development set. As experiments are ongoing we
do not report results on a test set.

is that mapping words to named entities improves
results when low frequency words are mapped to
a generic UNKNOWN token. However, when low
frequency words are mapped to more fine-grained
UNKNOWN tokens, mapping words to named enti-
ties decreases accuracy marginally.

If a particular named entity occurs often in the text
then data sparsity is possibly not a problem for this
word. Rather than map all occurrences of a named
entity to its entity type, we experimented with map-
ping only low frequency entities. These named en-
tity mapping experiments now mirror more closely
the unknown words mappings - low frequency en-
tities are mapped to special entity types, then the
parser maps all remaining low frequency words to
UNKNOWN types. Table 4 shows the effect of map-
ping only entities that occur less than 10 times in the
training set, to the person type and the reduced set
of entity types. Results somewhat improve for all
but one of the one-to-one experiments, but nonethe-
less remain below the best baseline result. There is
still no advantage in mapping low frequency person
name words to, say, the person cluster, rather than to
an UNKNOWN-plus-signature cluster.

5 Discussion

Our results thus far suggest that clusters based on
morphology or surface clues are more informative
than the named entity clusters.

For the one-to-one mappings one obvious prob-
lem that emerged is that all words in entities (in-
cluding function words for example) get mapped to
a generic named entity token. A multi-word named
entity has its own internal syntactic structure, re-
flected for example in its sequence of part-of-speech
tags. By replacing each word in the entity with
the generic entity token we end up loosing informa-
tion about words, conflating words that take differ-
ent part-of-speech categories, and in fact make pars-
ing more difficult. The named entity clusters in this
case are too coarse-grained and words with different
syntactic properties are merged into the one cluster,
something we would like to avoid.

In future work, as well as avoiding mapping more
complex named entities, we will refine the named
entity clusters by attaching to the entity type signa-
tures similar to those attached to the UNKNOWN

fect of mapping other types of named entities, such
as dates and numeric expressions. Finally, we intend
trying similar experiments on out-of-domain data,
such as social media text where unknown words are
more problematic.

6 Conclusion

We have presented preliminary experiments which
test the novel technique of mapping word tokens to
named entity clusters, with the aim of improving
parser accuracy by reducing data sparsity. While our
results so far are disappointing, we have identified
possible problems and outlined future experiments,
including suggestions for refining the named entity
clusters so that they become more syntactically ho-
mogenous.
