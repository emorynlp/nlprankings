Abstract

Domain portability and adaptation of NLP
components and Word Sense Disambigua-
tion systems present new challenges. The
difficulties found by supervised systems to
adapt might change the way we assess the
strengths and weaknesses of supervised
and knowledge-based WSD systems. Un-
fortunately, all existing evaluation datasets
for specific domains are lexical-sample
corpora. This task presented all-words
datasets on the environment domain for
WSD in four languages (Chinese, Dutch,
English, Italian). 11 teams participated,
with supervised and knowledge-based sys-
tems, mainly in the English dataset. The
results show that in all languages the par-
ticipants where able to beat the most fre-
quent sense heuristic as estimated from
general corpora. The most successful ap-
proaches used some sort of supervision in
the form of hand-tagged examples from
the domain.

1 Introduction

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) competitions
have focused on general domain texts, as attested
in previous Senseval and SemEval competitions
(Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Snyder
and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007). Spe-

cific domains pose fresh challenges to WSD sys-
tems: the context in which the senses occur might
change, different domains involve different sense
distributions and predominant senses, some words
tend to occur in fewer senses in specific domains,
the context of the senses might change, and new
senses and terms might be involved. Both super-
vised and knowledge-based systems are affected
by these issues: while the first suffer from differ-
ent context and sense priors, the later suffer from
lack of coverage of domain-related words and in-
formation.

The main goal of this task is to provide a mul-
tilingual testbed to evaluate WSD systems when
faced with full-texts from a specific domain. All
datasets and related information are publicly avail-
able from the task websites1.

This task was designed in the context of Ky-
oto (Vossen et al., 2008)2, an Asian-European
project that develops a community platform for
modeling knowledge and finding facts across lan-
guages and cultures. The platform operates as a
Wiki system with an ontological support that so-
cial communities can use to agree on the mean-
ing of terms in specific domains of their interest.
Kyoto focuses on the environmental domain be-
cause it poses interesting challenges for informa-
tion sharing, but the techniques and platforms are

independent of the application domain.
The paper is structured as follows. We first

present the preparation of the data. Section 3 re-
views participant systems and Section 4 the re-
sults. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions.

2 Data preparation

The data made available to the participants in-
cluded the test set proper, and background texts.
Participants had one week to work on the test set,
but the background texts where provided months
earlier.

2.1 Test datasets

The WSD-domain comprises comparable all-
words test corpora on the environment domain.
Three texts were compiled for each language by
the European Center for Nature Conservation3 and
Worldwide Wildlife Forum4. They are documents
written for a general but interested public and in-
volve specific terms from the domain. The docu-
ment content is comparable across languages. Ta-
ble 1 shows the numbers for the datasets.

Although the original plan was to annotate mul-
tiword terms, and domain terminology, due to time
constraints we focused on single-word nouns and
verbs. The test set clearly marked which were
the words to be annotated. In the case of Dutch,
we also marked components of single-word com-
pounds. The format of the test set followed that of
previous all-word exercises, which we extended to
accommodate Dutch compounds. For further de-
tails check the datasets in the task website.

The sense inventory was based on publicly
available wordnets of the respective languages
(see task website for details). The annotation pro-
cedure involved double-blind annotation by ex-
perts plus adjudication, which allowed us to also
provide Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) figures
for the dataset. The procedure was carried out us-
ing KAFnotator tool (Tesconi et al., 2010). Due
to limitations in resources and time, the English
dataset was annotated by a single expert annota-
tor. For the rest of languages, the agreement was
very good, as reported in Table 1.

Table 1 includes the results of the random base-
line, as an indication of the polysemy in each
dataset. Average polysemy is highest for English,
and lowest for Dutch.

2.2 Background data

In addition to the test datasets proper, we also pro-
vided additional documents on related subjects,
kindly provided by ECNC and WWF. Table 2
shows the number of documents and words made
available for each language. The full list with the
urls of the documents are available from the task
website, together with the background documents.

3 Participants

Eleven participants submitted more than thirty
runs (cf. Table 3). The authors classified their runs
into supervised (S in the tables, three runs), weakly
supervised (WS, four runs), unsupervised (no runs)
and knowledge-based (KB, the rest of runs)5. Only
one group used hand-tagged data from the domain,
which they produced on their own. We will briefly
review each of the participant groups, ordered fol-
lowing the rank obtained for English. They all par-
ticipated on the English task, with one exception
as noted below, so we report their rank in the En-
glish task. Please refer to their respective paper in
these proceedings for more details.

CFILT: They participated with a domain-
specific knowledge-based method based on Hop-
field networks (Khapra et al., 2010). They first
identify domain-dependant words using the back-
ground texts, use a graph based on hyponyms in
WordNet, and a breadth-first search to select the
most representative synsets within domain. In ad-
dition they added manually disambiguated around
one hundred examples from the domain as seeds.

5Note that boundaries are slippery. We show the classifi-
cations as reported by the authors.

(Rayson and Garside, 2000). Some of the runs
use sense statistics from SemCor, and have been
classified as weakly supervised. They submitted a
total of six runs, with the best run ranking 3rd.

BLC20(SC/BG/SCBG): This system is super-
vised. A Support Vector Machine was trained us-
ing the usual set of features extracted from con-
text and the most frequent class of the target word.
Semantic class-based classifiers were built from
SemCor (Izquierdo et al., 2009), where the classes
were automatically obtained exploiting the struc-
tural properties of WordNet. Their best run ranked
5th.

Treematch: This system uses a knowledge-
based disambiguation method that requires a dic-
tionary and untagged text as input. A previously
developed system (Chen et al., 2009) was adapted
to handle domain specific WSD. They built a
domain-specific corpus using words mined from
relevant web sites (e.g. WWF and ECNC) as
seeds. Once parsed the corpus, the used the de-
pendency knowledge to build a nodeset that was
used for WSD. The background documents pro-
vided by the organizers were only used to test how
exhaustive the initial seeds were. Their best run
ranked 8th.

Kyoto: This system participated in all four
languages, with a free reimplementation of
the domain-specific knowledge-based method for
WSD presented in (Agirre et al., 2009). It
uses a module to construct a distributional the-
saurus, which was run on the background text, and
a disambiguation module based on Personalized
PageRank over wordnet graphs. Different Word-
Net were used as the LKB depending on the lan-
guage. Their best run ranked 10th. Note that this
team includes some of the organizers of the task.
A strict separation was kept, in order to keep the
test dataset hidden from the actual developers of
the system.

RACAI: This participant submitted three differ-
ent knowledge-based systems. In the first, they use
the mapping to domains of WordNet (version 2.0)
in order to constraint the domains of the content
words of the test text. In the second, they choose
among senses using lexical chains (Ion and Ste-
fanescu, 2009). The third system combines the
previous two. Their best system ranked 12th.

HIT-CIR: They presented a knowledge-based
system which estimates predominant sense from
raw test. The predominant senses were calculated
with the frequency information in the provided
background text, and automatically constructed

78



thesauri from bilingual parallel corpora. The sys-
tem ranked 14.

UCFWS: This knowledge-based WSD system
was based on an algorithm originally described in
(Schwartz and Gomez, 2008), in which selectors
are acquired from the Web via searching with lo-
cal context of a given word. The sense is cho-
sen based on the similarity or relatedness between
the senses of the target word and various types
of selectors. In some runs they include predom-
inant senses(McCarthy et al., 2007). The best run
ranked 13th.

NLEL-WSD(-PDB): The system used for the
participation is based on an ensemble of different
methods using fuzzy-Borda voting. A similar sys-
tem was proposed in SemEval-2007 task-7 (Bus-
caldi and Rosso, 2007). In this case, the com-
ponent method used where the following ones:
1) Most Frequent Sense from SemCor; 2) Con-
ceptual Density ; 3) Supervised Domain Relative
Entropy classifier based on WordNet Domains;
4) Supervised Bayesian classifier based on Word-
Net Domains probabilities; and 5) Unsupervised
Knownet-20 classifiers. The best run ranked 24th.

UMCC-DLSI (Relevant): The team submitted
three different runs using a knowledge-based sys-
tem. The first two runs use domain vectors and
the third is based on cliques, which measure how
much a concept is correlated to the sentence by
obtaining Relevant Semantic Trees. Their best run
ranked 27th.

(G)HR: They presented a Knowledge-based
WSD system, which make use of two heuristic
rules (Li et al., 1995). The system enriched the
Chinese WordNet by adding semantic relations for
English domain specific words (e.g. ecology, en-
vironment). When in-domain senses are not avail-
able, the system relies on the first sense in the Chi-
nese WordNet. In addition, they also use sense
definitions. They only participated in the Chinese
task, with their best system ranking 1st.

4 Results

The evaluation has been carried out using the stan-
dard Senseval/SemEval scorer scorer2 as in-
cluded in the trial dataset, which computes preci-
sion and recall. Table 3 shows the results in each
dataset. Note that the main evaluation measure is
recall (R). In addition we also report precision (P)
and the recall for nouns and verbs. Recall mea-
sures are accompanied by a 95% confidence in-

terval calculated using bootstrap resampling pro-
cedure (Noreen, 1989). The difference between
two systems is deemed to be statistically signifi-
cant if there is no overlap between the confidence
intervals. We show graphically the results in Fig-
ure 1. For instance, the differences between the
highest scoring system and the following four sys-
tems are not statistically significant. Note that this
method of estimating statistical significance might
be more strict than other pairwise methods.

We also include the results of two baselines.
The random baseline was calculated analytically.
The first sense baseline for each language was
taken from each wordnet. The first sense baseline
in English and Chinese corresponds to the most
frequent sense, as estimated from out-of-domain
corpora. In Dutch and Italian, it followed the in-
tuitions of the lexicographer. Note that we don’t
have the most frequent sense baseline from the do-
main texts, which would surely show higher re-
sults (Koeling et al., 2005).

5 Conclusions

Domain portability and adaptation of NLP com-
ponents and Word Sense Disambiguation systems
present new challenges. The difficulties found by
supervised systems to adapt might change the way
we assess the strengths and weaknesses of super-
vised and knowledge-based WSD systems. With
this paper we have motivated the creation of an
all-words test dataset for WSD on the environ-
ment domain in several languages, and presented
the overall design of this SemEval task.

One of the goals of the exercise was to show
that WSD systems could make use of unannotated
background corpora to adapt to the domain and
improve their results. Although it’s early to reach
hard conclusions, the results show that in each of
the datasets, knowledge-based systems are able to
improve their results using background text, and
in two datasets the adaptation of knowledge-based
systems leads to results over the MFS baseline.
The evidence of domain adaptation of supervised
systems is weaker, as only one team tried, and the
differences with respect to MFS are very small.
The best results for English are obtained by a sys-
tem that combines a knowledge-based system with
some targeted hand-tagging. Regarding the tech-
niques used, graph-based methods over WordNet
and distributional thesaurus acquisition methods
have been used by several teams.
