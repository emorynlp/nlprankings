Abstract

Temporal information is important for
many NLP tasks, and there has been ex-
tensive research on temporal tagging with
a particular focus on English texts. Re-
cently, other languages have also been ad-
dressed, e.g., HeidelTime was extended to
process eight languages. Chinese temporal
tagging has achieved less attention, and no
Chinese temporal tagger is publicly avail-
able. In this paper, we address the full task
of Chinese temporal tagging (extraction
and normalization) by developing Chinese
HeidelTime resources. Our evaluation on
a publicly available corpus – which we
also partially re-annotated due to its rather
low quality – demonstrates the effective-
ness of our approach, and we outperform
a recent approach to normalize temporal
expressions. The Chinese HeidelTime re-
source as well as the corrected corpus are
made publicly available.

1 Introduction

Temporal information plays a crucial role in many
documents, and temporal tagging, i.e., the extrac-
tion of temporal expressions and their normaliza-
tion to some standard format, is crucial for sev-
eral NLP tasks. So far, research on temporal in-
formation extraction mostly focused on western
languages, especially English. In contrast, eastern
languages, e.g., Chinese, are less explored. Nev-
ertheless, there is research on Chinese temporal
tagging. While some works addressed either the
extraction or the normalization subtask, a few full
temporal taggers exist, e.g., CTEMP (Wu et al.,
2005b) and CTAT (Jing et al., 2008), but none of
them is publicly available.

In contrast, some temporal taggers were re-
cently made available, e.g., DANTE (Mazur and

Dale, 2009), TipSem (Llorens et al., 2010), and
HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013). Further-
more, Strötgen et al. (2013) showed that Hei-
delTime can be extended to further languages
by developing language-specific resources with-
out modifying the source code. Thus, when de-
veloping temporal tagging capabilities for an ad-
ditional language, one is faced with the question
of whether to develop a new temporal tagger or
to extend an existing one. We decided to extend
HeidelTime for Chinese for the following reasons:
(i) HeidelTime was the best temporal tagger in
the TempEval-2 (English) and TempEval-3 (En-
glish and Spanish) competitions (Verhagen et al.,
2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), (ii) it already sup-
ports eight languages, and (iii) it is the only multi-
lingual temporal tagger for cross-domain temporal
tagging, e.g., news- and narrative-style documents
can be processed with high quality.

2 Related Work
For Chinese temporal tagging, machine learning
and rule-based approaches have been employed.
Wu et al. (2005a) and Wu (2010) report that ma-
chine learning techniques do not achieve as good
results as rule-based approaches when processing
Chinese. Thus, it is reasonable to extend a rule-
based system such as HeidelTime to Chinese.

In general, temporal tagging approaches per-
form the extraction, the normalization, or both,
and create TIDES TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) or
TimeML’s TIMEX3 (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) an-
notations. For development and evaluation, there
are two Chinese temporally annotated corpora,
the ACE 2005 training corpus and TempEval-2
(c.f. Section 3). Table 1 lists approaches to Chi-
nese temporal tagging with some further infor-
mation. The most recent work is the learning-
based language-independent discriminative pars-
ing approach for normalizing temporal expres-
sions by Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).

There are also (semi-)automatic approaches to
port a temporal tagger from one language to an-
other. For instance, TERSEO (Negri et al., 2006;
Saquete et al., 2006) has been extended from
Spanish to English and Italian by automatic rule-
translation and automatically developed parallel
corpora. However, the normalization quality of
this approach was rather low compared to a rule-
based tagger manually developed for the specific
language (Negri, 2007). This finding encour-
aged us to manually create Chinese HeidelTime
resources instead of trying automatic methods.

3 The TempEval-2 Chinese Corpus

There are two Chinese temporally annotated cor-
pora available: While the Chinese part of the ACE
2005 multilingual training corpus (Walker et al.,
2006) has been used by some approaches (c.f. Ta-
ble 1), it only contains TIMEX2 extent annota-
tions. In contrast, the TempEval-2 Chinese data
sets (Verhagen et al., 2010) contain TIMEX3 an-
notations with extent and normalization informa-
tion. However, no TempEval-2 participants ad-
dressed Chinese and only Angeli and Uszkoreit
(2013) report evaluation results on this corpus.
Since HeidelTime is TIMEX3-compliant, and we
address the extraction and normalization subtasks,
we use the TempEval-2 corpus in our work.

3.1 Annotation Standard TimeML
For temporal expressions, TimeML (Pustejovsky
et al., 2005) contains TIMEX3 tags with several
attributes. The two most important ones – also
annotated in the TempEval-2 data – are type and
value. Type specifies if an expression is a date,
time, duration, or set (set of times), and value con-
tains the normalized meaning in standard format.

3.2 Original TempEval-2 Corpus
The Chinese training and test sets consist of 44 and
15 documents with 746 and 190 temporal expres-
sions, respectively. However, several expressions

have no normalized value information (85 in the
training and 47 in the test set), others no type.1

This issue was also reported by Angeli and
Uszkoreit (2013). Thus, they report evaluation re-
sults on two versions of the data sets, the original
version and a cleaned version, in which all expres-
sions without value information were removed.

3.3 Re-annotation of the TempEval-2 Corpus
Due to the significant amount of temporal expres-
sions with undefined value attributes, we decided
to manually assign normalized values to these ex-
pressions instead of excluding them. During this
process, we recognized that the corpus contained
several more errors, e.g., some expressions were
annotated as dates although they refer to durations.
Thus, instead of only substituting undefined val-
ues, we checked all annotations in the two data
sets and corrected errors. For this, one Chinese na-
tive and two further TimeML experts discussed all
modified annotations. Although there were sev-
eral difficult expressions and not all normaliza-
tions were straightforward, we significantly im-
proved the annotation quality. After our modifi-
cation, the improved training and test sets contain
765 and 193 temporal expressions with value in-
formation, respectively. In Table 2, statistics about
the three versions of the data sets are provided.

4 Chinese HeidelTime Resources

HeidelTime is a cross-domain, multilingual tem-
poral tagger that strictly separates the source
code and language-dependent resources (Strötgen
and Gertz, 2013). While the implementation
takes care of domain-dependent normalization is-
sues, language-dependent resources contain pat-
tern, normalization, and rule files. We had to de-
velop such Chinese resources to perform Chinese
temporal tagging with HeidelTime.

1Note that the TempEval-2 corpus developers stated that
the annotations of the non-English documents are rather ex-
perimental (Verhagen, 2011).

4.1 Chinese Linguistic Preprocessing

As input, HeidelTime requires sentence, token,
and part-of-speech information. For most of the
supported languages, HeidelTime uses a UIMA
wrapper of the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). Since
there is also a Chinese model for the TreeTagger
available, we rely on the TreeTagger for Chinese
linguistic preprocessing.2

4.2 Resource Development Process

To develop Chinese HeidelTime resources, we
followed the strategy applied by Strötgen et al.
(2013) for Spanish: Using HeidelTime’s English
resources as starting point, we translated the pat-
tern files, the normalization files, and the rules for
extracting and normalizing temporal expressions.
More details on these steps are provided next.

Pattern & Normalization Resources. English
patterns in the pattern files, which also exist in
Chinese in a similar form, were directly trans-
lated. For instance, there are Chinese expressions
for names of months and weekdays. Patterns ex-
isting in English but not used in Chinese were re-
moved, e.g., there are no abbreviations of month
names in Chinese. In contrast, for other patterns
frequently used in Chinese, additional pattern files
were created. Examples are Chinese numerals.

Based on the pattern files, we built the normal-
ization files. Here, the normalized values of the
patterns are stored. An example of the Chinese
resources is as follows: The three patterns “星
期二”, “礼拜二”, and “周二” can all be trans-
lated as Tuesday and are thus part of the Weekday
pattern resource. Since weekdays are internally
handled by HeidelTime with their English names,
the normalization file for Chinese weekdays con-
tains “星期二,Tuesday” “礼拜二,Tuesday” and
“周二,Tuesday”.

Chinese Rule Development. HeidelTime’s
rules contain three components, a name, an ex-
traction and a normalization part. The extraction
mainly makes use of regular expressions and the
pattern resources, and in the normalization part,
the matched expressions are normalized using the
normalization resources.3 To develop the rules,
we again followed Strötgen et al. (2013) and
applied the following strategy:

(i) A few simple Chinese rules were created
based on the English rules. (ii) We reviewed ex-
tracted temporal expressions in the training set and
improved the extraction and normalization parts of
the rules. (iii) We checked the training texts for
undetected expressions and created rules to match
them. In parallel, we adapted the Chinese pattern
and normalization resources when necessary. (iv)
We translated more complex English rules to also
cover valid expressions not occurring in the Chi-
nese training documents. (v) Steps (ii) to (iv) were
iteratively performed until the results on the train-
ing set could not be improved further.

4.3 Chinese Challenges

Chinese is an isolating language without inflection
and depends on word order and function words
to represent grammatical relations. Although we
only consider modern Mandarin as it is the most
widely used variety of Chinese in contemporary
texts, many challenges occurred during the re-
source development process. Some examples are:

Polysemous words: Many Chinese words have
more than one meaning, e.g., dynasty names such
as “唐” (Tang) or “宋” (Song) can refer to a certain
time period, but also appear as family names.

Further ambiguities: There are many ambigu-
ous expressions in Chinese, e.g., the temporal ex-
pression “五日前” has two meanings: “before the
5th day of a certain month” and also “5 days ago”
– depending on the context.

Calendars: There are various calendars in Chi-
nese culture and thus also in Chinese texts, such
as the lunar calendar and the 24 solar terms, which
are different from the Gregorian calendar and thus
very difficult to normalize. Besides, Taiwan has
a different calendar, which numbers the year from
the founding year of the Republic of China (1911).

and rule syntax, we refer to Strötgen and Gertz (2013).

5 Evaluation
In this section, we present evaluation results of our
newly developed Chinese HeidelTime resources.
In addition, we compare our results for the normal-
ization sub-task to Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).

5.1 Evaluation Setup
Corpus: We use three versions of the TempEval-
2 training and test sets: (i) the original versions,
(ii) the improved versions described in Section 3.3,
and (iii) the cleaned versions also used by Angeli
and Uszkoreit (2013) in which temporal expres-
sions without value information are removed.
Setting: Since the TempEval-2 data already con-
tains sentence and token information, we only
had to perform part-of-speech tagging as linguistic
preprocessing step. For this, we used the TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994) with its Chinese model.
Measures: We use the official TempEval-2 eval-
uation script. For the extraction, precision, recall,
and f-score are calculated on the token-level. For
the normalization, accuracy for the attributes type
and value are calculated on the expression-level.
Note that the use of accuracy makes it difficult to
compare systems having a different recall in the
extraction, as will be explained below.

5.2 Evaluation Results
Table 3 (top) shows the evaluation results on the
training set. Extraction and normalization quality
are high, and value accuracies of over 90% on the
cleaned and improved versions are promising.4

The results on the test sets (Table 3, bottom) are
lower than on the training sets. However, value ac-
curacies of almost 90% with a recall of more than
80% are valuable and comparable to state-of-the-
art systems in other languages. A first error anal-
ysis revealed that while the training documents

4Note that the lower value accuracy on the original set
is due to expressions without value information in the gold
standard, and that the low extraction precision in the clean
version is due to some of those expressions being (correctly)
extracted by the system but removed from the gold standard.

are written in modern Mandarin, some test doc-
uments contain Taiwan-specific expressions (c.f.
Section 4.3) not covered by our rules yet.

Finally, we compare the normalization quality
of our approach to the multilingual parsing ap-
proach of Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013). How-
ever, their approach performs only the normaliza-
tion subtask assuming that the extents of temporal
expressions are provided. For this, they used gold
extents for evaluation. HeidelTime only normal-
izes those expressions that it knows how to extract.
Thus, we run HeidelTime performing the extrac-
tion and the normalization. However, since the
accuracy measure used by the TempEval-2 script
calculates the ratio of correctly normalized expres-
sions to all extracted expressions and not to all
expressions in the gold standard, we additionally
present the raw numbers of correctly normalized
expressions for the two systems. Table 4 shows the
comparison between our approach and the one by
Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013). We outperform their
approach not only with respect to the accuracy but
also with respect to the numbers of correctly nor-
malized expressions (574 vs. 4845 and 121 vs. 865

on the training and test sets, respectively) – despite
the fact that we perform the full task of temporal
tagging and not only the normalization.

6 Conclusions & Ongoing Work
In this paper, we addressed Chinese temporal
tagging by developing Chinese HeidelTime re-
sources. These make HeidelTime the first publicly
available Chinese temporal tagger. Our evaluation
showed the high quality of the new HeidelTime re-
sources, and we outperform a recent normalization
approach. Furthermore, the re-annotated Chinese
TempEval-2 data sets will also be made available.

Currently, we are performing a detailed error
analysis and hope to gain insights to further im-
prove HeidelTime’s Chinese resources.
