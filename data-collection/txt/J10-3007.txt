Word-level alignment of bilingual text is a critical resource for a growing variety of tasks. Proba-
bilistic models for word alignment present a fundamental trade-off between richness of captured
constraints and correlations versus efficiency and tractability of inference. In this article, we
use the Posterior Regularization framework (Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar 2007) to incorporate
complex constraints into probabilistic models during learning without changing the efficiency
of the underlying model. We focus on the simple and tractable hidden Markov model, and
present an efficient learning algorithm for incorporating approximate bijectivity and symmetry
constraints. Models estimated with these constraints produce a significant boost in performance
as measured by both precision and recall of manually annotated alignments for six language
pairs. We also report experiments on two different tasks where word alignments are required:
phrase-based machine translation and syntax transfer, and show promising improvements over
standard methods.

1. Introduction

The seminal work of Brown et al. (1993b) introduced a series of probabilistic models
(IBM Models 1–5) for statistical machine translation and the concept of “word-by-
word” alignment, the correspondence between words in source and target languages.
Although no longer competitive as end-to-end translation models, the IBM Models,
as well as the hidden Markov model (HMM) of Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann (1996),
are still widely used for word alignment. Word alignments are used primarily for
extracting minimal translation units for machine translation (MT) (e.g., phrases [Koehn,
Och, and Marcu 2003] and rules [Galley et al. 2004; Chiang et al. 2005]) as well as for

MT system combination (Matusov, Ueffing, and Ney 2006). But their importance has
grown far beyond machine translation: for instance, transferring annotations between
languages (Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Hwa et al. 2005; Ganchev, Gillenwater, and
Taskar 2009); discovery of paraphrases (Bannard and Callison-Burch 2005); and joint
unsupervised POS and parser induction across languages (Snyder and Barzilay 2008).

IBM Models 1 and 2 and the HMM are simple and tractable probabilistic models,
which produce the target sentence one target word at a time by choosing a source word
and generating its translation. IBM Models 3, 4, and 5 attempt to capture fertility (the
tendency of each source word to generate several target words), resulting in probabilis-
tically deficient, intractable models that require local heuristic search and are difficult to
implement and extend. Many researchers use the GIZA++ software package (Och and
Ney 2003) as a black box, selecting IBM Model 4 as a compromise between alignment
quality and efficiency. All of the models are asymmetric (switching target and source
languages produces drastically different results) and the simpler models (IBM Models 1,
2, and HMM) do not enforce bijectivity (the majority of words translating as a single
word). Although there are systematic translation phenomena where one cannot hope to
obtain 1-to-1 alignments, we observe that in over 6 different European language pairs
the majority of alignments are in fact 1-to-1 (86–98%). This leads to the common practice
of post-processing heuristics for intersecting directional alignments to produce nearly
bijective and symmetric results (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003).

In this article we focus on the HMM word alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and
Tillmann 1996), using a novel unsupervised learning framework that significantly
boosts its performance. The new training framework, called Posterior Regulariza-
tion (Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar 2007), incorporates prior knowledge in the form of
constraints on the model’s posteriors. The constraints are expressed as inequalities on
the expected value under the posterior distribution of user-defined features. Although
the base model remains unchanged, learning guides the model to satisfy these con-
straints. We propose two such constraints: (i) bijectivity: one word should not translate
to many words; and (ii) symmetry: directional alignments should agree. Both of these
constraints significantly improve the performance of the model both in precision and
recall, with the symmetry constraint generally producing more accurate alignments.
Section 3 presents the Posterior Regularization (PR) framework and describes how to
encode such constraints in an efficient manner, requiring only repeated inference in the
original model to enforce the constraints. Section 4 presents a detailed evaluation of
the alignments produced. The constraints over posteriors consistently and significantly
outperform the unconstrained HMM model, evaluated against manual annotations.
Moreover, this training procedure outperforms the more complex IBM Model 4 nine
times out of 12. We examine the influence of constraints on the resulting posterior dis-
tributions and find that they are especially effective for increasing alignment accuracy
for rare words. We also demonstrate a new methodology to avoid overfitting using a
small development corpus. Section 5 evaluates the new framework on two different
tasks that depend on word alignments. Section 5.1 focuses on MT and shows that the
better alignments also lead to better translation systems, adding to similar evidence
presented in Ganchev, Graça, and Taskar (2008). Section 5.2 shows that the alignments
we produce are better suited for transfer of syntactic dependency parse annotations.

2. Background

A word alignment for a parallel sentence pair represents the correspondence between
words in a source language and their translations in a target language (Brown et al.
1993b). There are many reasons why a simple word-to-word (1-to-1) correspondence
is not possible for every sentence pair: for instance, auxiliary verbs used in one lan-
guage but not the other (e.g., English He walked and French Il est allé), articles required
in one language but optional in the other (e.g., English Cars use gas and Portuguese
Os carros usam gasolina), cases where the content is expressed using multiple words
in one language and a single word in the other language (e.g., agglutination such as
English weapons of mass destruction and German Massenvernichtungswaffen), and expres-
sions translated indirectly. Due to this inherent ambiguity, manual annotations usually
distinguish between sure correspondences for unambiguous translations, and possible,
for ambiguous translations (Och and Ney 2003). The top row of Figure 1 shows two
word alignments between an English–French sentence pair. We use the following nota-
tion: the alignment on the left (right) will be referenced as source–target (target–source)
and contains source (target) words as rows and target (source) words as columns. Each
entry in the matrix corresponds to a source–target word pair, and is the candidate for an
alignment link. Sure links are represented as squares with borders, and possible links

are represented as squares without borders. Circles indicate the posterior probability

We use six manually annotated corpora whose characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The corpora are: the Hansard corpus (Och and Ney 2000) of English/French
Canadian Parliamentary proceedings (En-Fr), and the English/Spanish portion of the
Europarl corpus (Koehn 2005) where the annotation is from EPPS (Lambert et al. 2005)
(En-Es) using standard test and development set split. We also used the English/
Portuguese (En-Pt), Portuguese/Spanish (Pt-Es), Portuguese/French (Pt-Fr), and
Spanish/French (Es-Fr) portions of the Europarl corpus using annotations described
by Graça et al. (2008), where we split the gold alignments into a dev/test set in a ratio of
40%/60%. Table 1 shows some of the variety of challenges presented by each corpus.
For example, En-Es has longer sentences and hence more ambiguity for alignment.
Furthermore, it has a smaller percentage of bijective (1-to-1) alignments, which makes
word fertility more important. Overall, the great majority of links are bijective across
the corpora (86–98%). This characteristic will be explored by the constraints described
in this article. For the evaluations in Section 4, the percentage of sure links (out of all
links) will correlate with difficulty because only sure links are considered for recall.

2.1 HMM Word Alignment Model

In this article we focus on the HMM for word alignment proposed by Vogel, Ney, and
Tillmann (1996). This model generalizes IBM Models 1 and 2 (Brown et al. 1993b),
by introducing a first-order Markov dependence between consecutive alignment link
decisions. The model is an (input–output) HMM with I positions whose hidden state
sequence z = (z1, . . . , zI ) with zi ∈ {null, 1, . . . , J} corresponds to a sequence of source
word positions, where J is the source sentence length, and with null representing un-
aligned target words. Each observation corresponds to a word in the target language xi.
The probability of an alignment z and target sentence x given a source sentence y can
be expressed as:

pθ(x, z | y) =
I∏

i=1

pd(zi | zi−1)pt(xi | yzi ) (1)

where pt(xi | yzi ) is the probability of a target word at position i being a translation of the
source word at position zi (translation probability), and pd(zi | zi−1) is the probability

484



Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar Learning Alignment Models with Complex Constraints

of translating a word at position zi, given that the previous translated word was at
position zi−1 (distortion probability). Note that this model is directional: Each target
word (observation) can be aligned to at most one source word (hidden state), whereas a
source word could be used multiple times.

We refer to translation parameters pt and distortions parameters pd jointly as θ.
There are several important standard details of the parametrization: The distortion
probability pd(zi | zi−1) depends only on the distance (zi − zi−1) between the source po-
sitions the states represent. Only distances in the range ±5 are modeled explicitly, with
larger distances assigned equal probabilities. The probability of the initial hidden state,
pd(z1 | z0) is modeled separately from the other distortion probabilities. To incorporate
null links, we add a translation probability given null: pt(xi | ynull). Following standard
practice, null links also maintain position information and do not allow distortion. To
implement this, we create position-specific null hidden states for each source position,
and set pd(nulli|yi′ ) = 0 and pd(nulli|nulli′ ) = 0 for all i �= i′. The model is simple, with
complexity of inference O(I × J2). There are several problems with the model that arise
from its directionality, however.

� Non-bijective: Multiple target words can be linked to a single source
word. This is rarely desirable. For instance, the model produces
non-bijective links 22% of the time for En-Fr instead of 2%.

� Asymmetric: By switching the (arbitrary) choice of which language is
source and which is target, the HMM produces very different results. For
example, intersecting the sets of alignments produced by the two possible
choices for source preserves less than half of their union for both En-Fr
and En-Pt.2

2.2 Training

Standard HMM training seeks model parameters θ that maximize the log-likelihood of
the parallel corpus:

Log-Likelihood : L(θ) = Ê[log pθ(x | y)] = Ê[log
∑

z

pθ(x, z | y)] (2)

where Ê[ f (x, y)] = 1N
∑N

n=1 f (x
n, yn) denotes the empirical average of a function f (xn, yn)

over the N pairs of sentences {(x1, y1) . . . , (xN, yN )} in the training corpus. Because
of the latent alignment variables z, the log-likelihood function for the HMM model
is not concave, and the model is fit using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algo-
rithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977). EM maximizes L(θ) via block-coordinate
ascent on a lower bound F(q, θ) using an auxiliary distribution over the latent variables
q(z | x, y) (Neal and Hinton 1998):

EM Lower Bound : L(θ) ≥ F(q, θ) = Ê
[∑

z

q(z | x, y) log pθ(x, z | y)
q(z | x, y)

]
(3)

2 For both of these points, see the experimental setup in Section 4.1.

485



Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 3

To simplify notation, we will drop the dependence on y and will write pθ(x, z | y) as
pθ(x, z), pθ(z | x, y) as pθ(z | x) and q(z | x, y) as q(z | x). The alternating E and M steps
at iteration t + 1 are given by:

E : qt+1(z | x) = arg max
q(z|x)

F(q, θt) = arg min
q(z|x)

KL(q(z | x) || pθt (z | x)) = pθt (z | x) (4)

M : θt+1 = arg max
θ

F(qt+1, θ) = arg max

Ê

[∑
z

qt+1(z | x) log pθ(x, z)
]

(5)

where KL(q||p) = Eq[log q(·)p(·) ] is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The EM algorithm is
guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of L(θ) under mild conditions (Neal and
Hinton 1998). The E step computes the posteriors qt+1(z | x) = pθt (z | x) over the latent
variables (alignments) given the observed variables (sentence pair) and current param-
eters θt, which is accomplished by the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The M
step uses qt+1 to “softly fill in” the values of alignments z and estimate parameters θt+1.
This step is particularly easy for HMMs, where θt+1 simply involves normalizing (ex-
pected) counts. This modular split into two intuitive and straightforward steps accounts
for the vast popularity of EM.

In Figure 1, each entry in the alignment matrix contains a circle indicating the align-
ment link posterior for that particular word pair after training an HMM model with the
EM algorithm (see the experimental set up in Section 4.1). Note that the link posteriors
are concentrated around particular source words (rare words occurring less than five
times in the corpus) in both directions, instead of being spread across different words.
This is a well-known problem when training using EM called the “garbage collector ef-
fect” (Brown et al. 1993a). A rare word in the source language links to many words in the
target language that we would ideally like to see unaligned, or aligned to other words
in the sentence. The reason this happens is that the generative model has to distribute
translation probability for each source word among different candidate target words.
If one translation is much more common than another, but the rare translation is used
in the sentence, the model might have a very low translation probability for the correct
alignment. On the other hand, because the rare source word occurs only in a few sen-
tences it needs to spread its probability mass over fewer competing translations. In this
case, choosing to align the rare word to all of these words leads to a higher likelihood
than correctly linking them or linking them to the special null word, because it increases
the likelihood of this sentence without lowering the likelihood of many other sentences.

2.3 Decoding

Alignments are normally predicted using the Viterbi algorithm (which selects the single
most probable path through the HMM’s lattice).

Another possibility that often works better is to use Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR)
decoding (Kumar and Byrne 2002; Liang, Taskar, and Klein 2006; Graça, Ganchev, and
Taskar 2007). Using this decoding we include an alignment link i − j if the posterior
probability that word i aligns to word j is above some threshold. This allows the
accumulation of probability from several low-scoring alignments that agree on one
alignment link. The threshold is tuned on some small amount of labeled data—in
our case the development set—to minimize some loss. Kumar and Byrne (2002) study
different loss functions that incorporate linguistic knowledge, and show significant

486



Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar Learning Alignment Models with Complex Constraints

improvement over likelihood decoding. Note that this could potentially result in an
alignment having zero probability under the model, as many-to-many alignments can
be produced in this way. MBR decoding has several advantages over Viterbi decoding.
First, independently of the particular choice of the loss function, by picking a specific
threshold we can trade off precision and recall of the predicted word alignments. In
fact, in this work when comparing different alignment sets we do not commit to any
loss function but instead compare precision vs recall curves, by generating alignments
for different thresholds (0..1). Second, with this method we can ignore the null word
probabilities, which tend to be poorly estimated.

3. Posterior Regularization

Word alignment models in general and the HMM in particular are very gross over-
simplifications of the translation process and the optimal likelihood parameters learned
often do not correspond to sensible alignments. One solution to this problem is to
add more complexity to the model to better reflect the translation process. This is the
approach taken by IBM Models 4+ (Brown et al. 1993b; Och and Ney 2003), and more
recently by the LEAF model (Fraser and Marcu 2007). Unfortunately, these changes
make the models probabilistically deficient and intractable, requiring approximations
and heuristic learning and inference prone to search errors. Instead, we propose to
use a learning framework called Posterior Regularization (Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar
2007) that incorporates side information into unsupervised estimation in the form of
constraints on the model’s posteriors. The constraints are expressed as inequalities on
the expected values under the posterior distribution of user-defined constraint features
(not necessarily the same features used by the model). Because in most applications
what we are interested in are the latent variables (in this case the alignments), con-
straining the posteriors allows a more direct way to achieve the desired behavior.
On the other hand, constraining the expected value of the features instead of adding
them to the model allows us to express features that would otherwise make the model
intractable. For example, enforcing that each hidden state of an HMM model should be
used at most once per sentence would break the Markov property and make the model
intractable. In contrast, we will show how to enforce the constraint that each hidden
state is used at most once in expectation. The underlying model remains unchanged,
but the learning method changes. During learning, our method is similar to the EM
algorithm with the addition of solving an optimization problem similar to a maximum
entropy problem inside the E Step. The following subsections present the Posterior
Regularization framework, followed by a description of how to encode two pieces of
prior information aimed at solving the problems described at the end of Section 2.

3.1 Posterior Regularization Framework

The goal of the Posterior Regularization (PR) framework is to guide a model during
learning towards satisfying some prior knowledge about the desired latent variables
(in this case word alignments), encoded as constraints over their expectations. The
key advantage of using regularization on posterior expectations is that the base model
remains unchanged, but during learning, it is driven to obey the constraints by setting
appropriate parameters θ. Moreover, experiments show that enforcing constraints in ex-
pectation results in predicted alignments that also satisfy the constraints. More formally,
posterior information in PR is specified with sets Qx of allowed distributions over the

487



Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 3

hidden variables z which satisfy inequality constraints on some user-defined feature
expectations, with violations bounded by � ≥ 0:

Constrained Posterior Set : Qx = {q(z | x) : ∃ξ, Eq[f(x, z)] − bx ≤ ξ; ||ξ||22 ≤ �2} (6)

Qx denotes the set of valid distributions where some feature expectations are bounded
by bx and � ≥ 0 is an allowable violation slack. Setting � = 0 enforces inequality
constraints strictly. In order to introduce equality constraints, we use two inequality
constraints with opposite signs. We assume that Qx is non-empty for each example x.
Furthermore, the set Qx needs to be convex. In this work we restrict ourselves to
linear inequalities because, as will be shown, subsequently this simplifies the learning
algorithm. Note that Qx, f(x, z), and bx also depend on y, the corresponding source
sentence, but we suppress the dependence for brevity. In PR, the log-likelihood of a
model is penalized with the KL-divergence between the desired distribution space Qx
and the model posteriors, KL(Qx ‖ pθ(z|x)) = min

q(z|x)∈Qx
KL(q(z | x) ‖ pθ(z|x)). The regu-

larized objective is:

Posterior Regularized Likelihood : L(θ) − Ê[KL(Qx ‖ pθ(z|x))]. (7)

The objective trades off likelihood and distance to the desired posterior subspace (mod-
ulo getting stuck in local maxima) and provides an effective method of controlling the
posteriors.

Another way of interpreting the objective is to express the marginal log-likelihood
L(θ) as a KL distance: KL(δ(xn) ‖ pθ(x)) where δ(xn) is a delta function at xn. Hence the
objective is a sum of two average KL terms, one in the space of distributions over x and
one in the space of distributions over z:

−L(θ) + Ê[KL(Qx ‖ pθ(z|x))] = 1N

N∑
n=1

KL(δ(xn) ‖ pθ(x)) + KL(Qxn ‖ pθ(z|xn)) (8)

This view of the PR objective is illustrated in Figure 2.

on θ is not shown.)

Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar Learning Alignment Models with Complex Constraints

Computing the PR objective involves solving the optimization problem for each x:

Primal Projection : KL(Qx ‖ pθ(z|x)) = min
q(z|x)∈Qx

KL(q(z | x) ‖ pθ(z|x)) (9)

Directly minimizing this objective is hard because there is an exponential number of
alignments z; however, the problem becomes easy to solve in its dual formulation (see
Appendix A for derivation):

Dual Projection : arg min
λ≥0

b�x λ + log Z(λ) + � ||λ||2 (10)

where Z(λ) =
∑

z pθ(z|x) exp(−λ · f(x, z)) is the normalization constant and the primal
solution is q(z|x) = pθ(z|x) exp{−λ�f(x, z)}/Z(λ). There is one dual variable per ex-
pectation constraint, and the dual gradient at λ �= 0 is ∇(λ) = bx − Eq[f(x, z)] + � λi||λ||2 .
Note that this primal–dual relationship is very similar to the one between maximum
likelihood and maximum entropy. If bx corresponds to empirical expectations and
pθ(z|x) is uniform, then Equation (10) would be a log-likelihood and Equation (14) (fol-
lowing) would be a maximum entropy problem. As with maximum entropy, gradient
computation involves computing an expectation under q(z | x), which can be performed
efficiently if the features f(x, z) factor in the same way as the model pθ(x, z), and the
constraints are linear. The conditional distribution over z represented by a graphical
model such as HMM can be written as a product of factors over cliques C:

Factored Posterior : p(z | x) = 1Z
∏
c∈C

φ(x, zc) (11)

In an HMM, the cliques C are simply the nodes zi and the edges (zi, zi+1) and the factors
correspond to the distortion and translation probabilities. We will assume f is factorized
as a sum over the same cliques (we will show below how symmetry and bijectivity
constraints can be expressed in this way):

Factored Features : f(x, z) =
∑
c∈C

f(x, zc) (12)

Then q(z | x) has the same form as pθ(z | x):

q(z | x) = 1Zp(z | x) exp(−λ
�f(x, z)) = 1Z

∏
c∈C

φ(x, zc) exp−λ
�f(x,zc ) (13)

Hence the projection step uses the same inference algorithm (forward–backward for
HMMs) to compute the gradient, only modifying the local factors using the current
setting of λ.

λi ← 0;1
while ||∇(λ)||2 > η do2

φ′(x, zc) ← φ(x, zc) exp−λ
�f(x,zc );3

q(z | x) ← forwardBackward(φ′(x, zc));4
λ ← λ + αβ∇(λ);5

We optimize the dual objective using the gradient based methods shown in
Algorithm 1. Here η is an optimization precision, α is a step size chosen with the strong
Wolfe’s rule (Nocedal and Wright 1999). Here, β∇(λ) represents an ascent direction
chosen as follows: For inequality constraints, it is the projected gradient (Bertsekas
1999); for equality constraints with slack, we use conjugate gradient (Nocedal and
Wright 1999), noting that when λ = 0, the objective is not differentiable. In practice
this only happens at the start of optimization and we use a sub-gradient for the first
direction.

Computing the projection requires an algorithm for inference in the original model,
and uses that inference as a subroutine. For HMM word alignments, we need to make
several calls to forward–backward in order to choose λ. Setting the optimization pre-
cision η more loosely allows the optimization to terminate more quickly but at a less
accurate value. We found that aggressive optimization significantly improves alignment
quality for both constraints we used and consequently choose η so that tighter values
do not significantly improve performance. This explains why we report better results
here in this paper than in Ganchev, Graça, and Taskar (2008), which uses a more naive
optimization (see Section 4.1).

3.2 Posterior Regularization via Expectation Maximization

We can optimize the PR objective using a procedure very similar to the expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm. Recall from Equation (4) that in the E step, q(z | x) is
set to the posterior over hidden variables given the current θ. To converge to the PR
objective, we must modify the E step so that q(z | x) is a projection of the posteriors onto
the constraint set Qx for each example x (Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar 2007).

E′ : arg min
q,ξ

KL(q(z|x) ‖ pθt (z|x)) s.t. Eq[f(x, z)] − bx ≤ ξ; ||ξ||22 ≤ �2 (14)

The new posteriors q(z|x) are used to compute sufficient statistics for this instance and
hence to update the model’s parameters in the M step (Equation (5)), which remains
unchanged. This scheme is illustrated in Figure 3 and in Algorithm 2. The only imple-
mentation difference is that we must now perform the KL projection before collecting
sufficient statistics. We found it can help to also perform this projection at test time,
using q(z | x) = arg min

3.3 Bijectivity Constraints

We observed in Table 1 that most alignments are 1-to-1 and we would like to introduce
this prior information into the model. Unfortunately including such a constraint in the
model directly breaks the Markov property in a fairly fundamental way. In particular
computing the normalization would require the summation of 1-to-1 or near 1-to-1
weighted matchings, which is a classic #P-complete problem. Introducing alignment
degree constraints in expectation using the PR framework is easy and tractable. We
encode them as the constraint E[f(x, z)] ≤ 1 where we have one feature f for each source
word j that counts how many times it is aligned to a target word in the alignment z:

Bijective Features : fj(x, z) =
∑

i

1(zi = j).

The second row of Figure 1 shows an example of the posteriors after applying bijectivity
constraints; the first row is before the projection. Green (respectively, red) circles indicate
that the probability mass for that particular link increased (respectively, decreased)
when compared with the EM-trained HMM. For example, in the top left panel, the
word schism is used more than once, causing erroneous alignments. Projecting to the
bijectivity constraint set prevents this and most of the mass is (for this example) moved
to the correct word pairs. Enforcing the constraint at training and decoding increases
the fraction of 1-to-1 alignment links from 78% to 97.3% for En-Fr (manual annotations
have 98.1%); for En-Pt the increase is from 84.7% to 95.8% (manual annotations have
90.8%) (see Section 4.1).

3.4 Symmetry Constraints

The directional nature of the generative models used to recover word alignments con-
flicts with their interpretation as translations. In practice, we see that the choice of which
language is source versus target matters and changes the mistakes made by the model
(the first row of panels in Figure 1). The standard approach is to train two models
independently and then intersect their predictions (Och and Ney 2003). However, we
show that it is much better to train two directional models concurrently, coupling
their posterior distributions over alignments to approximately agree. Let the directional
models be defined as: −→p (−→z ) (source–target) and ←−p (←−z ) (target–source). We suppress
dependence on x and y for brevity. Define z to range over the union of all possible

491

directional alignments
−→
Z ∪←−Z . We define a mixture model p(z) = 12

−→p (z) + 12
←−p (z)

where ←−p (−→z ) = 0 and vice versa (i.e., the alignment of one directional model has prob-
ability zero according to the other model). We then define the following feature for each
target–source position pair i, j:

Symmetric Features : fij(x, z) =

⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩
+1 z ∈ −→Z and −→z i = j
−1 z ∈ ←−Z and ←−z j = i
0 otherwise

.

If the feature fij has an expected value of zero, then both models predict the i, j link
with equal probability. We therefore impose the constraint Eq[ fij(x, z)] = 0 (possibly with
some small slack). Note that satisfying this implies satisfying the bijectivity constraint
presented earlier. To compute expectations of these features under the model q we only
need to be able to compute them under each directional HMM. To see this, we have by
the definition of qλ and pθ,

qλ(z|x) =
−→p (z | x) + ←−p (z | x)

2
exp{−λ�f(x, z)}

Zλ
=

−→q (z|x) Z−→q−→p (x) +
←−q (z|x) Z←−q←−p (x)

where we have defined:
−→q (z|x) = 1Z−→q

−→p (z, x) exp{−λ�f(x, z)} with Z−→q =
∑

z

−→p (z, x) exp{−λ�f(x, z)}

←−p (z, x) exp{−λ�f(x, z)} with Z←−q =

∑
z

←−p (z, x) exp{−λ�f(x, z)}

All these quantities can be computed separately in each model using forward–backward
and, furthermore, Zλ = 12 (

Z−→q
−→p (x) +

Z←−q
←−p (x) ). The effect of this constraint is illustrated in

the bottom panels of Figure 1. The projected link posteriors are equal for the two
models, and in most cases the probability mass was moved to the correct alignment
links. The exception is the word pair internal/le. In this case, the model chose to incor-
rectly have a high posterior for the alignment link rather than generating internal from
null in one direction and le from null in the other.

We can measure symmetry of predicted alignments as the ratio of the size of the
intersection to the size of the union. Symmetry constraints increase symmetry from 48%
to 89.9% for En-Fr and from 48% to 94.2% for En-Pt (see Section 4.1).

4. Alignment Quality Evaluation

We begin with a comparison of word alignment quality evaluated against manually
annotated alignments as measured by precision and recall. We use the six parallel
corpora with gold annotations described in the beginning of Section 2.

4.1 Experimental Setup

We discarded all training data sentence pairs where one of the sentences contained
more than 40 words. Following common practice, we added the unlabeled development
and test data sets to the pool of unlabeled sentences. We initialized the IBM Model 1
translation table with uniform probabilities over word pairs that occur together in the
same sentence and trained the IBM Model 1 for 5 iterations. All HMM alignment models

492



Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar Learning Alignment Models with Complex Constraints

were initialized with the translation table from IBM Model 1 and uniform distortion
probabilities. We run each training procedure until the area under the precision/recall
curve measured on a development corpus stops increasing (see Figure 4 for an example
of such a curve). Using the precision/recall curve gives a broader sense of the model’s
performance than using a single point (by tuning a threshold for a particular metric). In
most cases this meant four iterations for normal EM training and two iterations using
posterior regularization. We suspect that the constraints make the space easier to search.

The convergence criterion for the projection algorithm was the normalized l2 norm
of the gradient (gradient norm divided by number of constraints) being smaller than
η (see Algorithm 1). For bijective constraints, we set η to 0.005 and used zero slack.
For symmetric constraints, η and slack were set to 0.001. We chose η aggressively
and lower values did not significantly increase performance. Less aggressive settings
cause degradation of performance: For example, for En-Fr using 10k sentences, and
running four iterations of constrained EM, the area under the precision/recall curve for
the symmetric model changed from 70% with η = 0.1 to 85% using η = 0.001. On the
other hand, the number of iterations required to project the constraints increases for
smaller values of η. The number of forward–backward calls for normal HMM is 40k
(one for each sentence and EM iteration), for the symmetric model using η = 0.1 was
around 41k and using η = 0.001 was around 26M (14 minutes to 4 hours 14 minutes
of training time, 17 times slower, for the different settings of η). We note that better
optimization methods, such as L-BFGS, or using a warm start for the parameters at each
EM iteration (parameters from the previous iteration), or training the models online,
would potentially decrease the running time of our method.

The intent of this experimental section is to evaluate the gains from using con-
straints during learning, hence the main comparison is between HMM trained with
normal EM vs. trained with PR plus constraints. We also report results for IBM Model 4,
because it is often used as the default word alignment model, and can be used as a
reference. However, we would like to note that IBM Model 4 is a more complex model,
able to capture more structure, albeit at the cost of intractable inference. Because our
approach is orthogonal to the base model used, the constraints described here could
be applied in principle to IBM Model 4 if exact inference was efficient, hopefully
yielding similar improvements. We used a standard implementation of IBM Model
4 (Och and Ney 2003) and because changing the existing code is not trivial, we could
not use the same stopping criterion to avoid overfitting and we are not able to produce
precision/recall curves. We trained IBM Model 4 using the default configuration of the

HMM, and five iterations of IBM Model 4.

4.2 Alignment Results

In this section we present results on alignment quality. All comparisons are made using
MBR decoding because this decoding method always outperforms Viterbi decoding.4

For the models with constraints we project the posteriors at decode time (i.e., we use
q(z | x) to decode). This gives a small but consistent improvement. Figure 4 shows
precision/recall curves for the different models on the En-Fr corpus using English as
the source language (left), and on the En-Pt corpus using Portuguese as the source.
Precision/recall curves are obtained by varying the posterior threshold from 0 to 1 and
then plotting the different precision and recall values obtained.

We observe several trends from Figure 4. First, both types of constraints improve
over the HMM in terms of both precision and recall (their precision/recall curve is
always above). Second, S-HMM performs slightly better than B-HMM. IBM Model 4
is comparable with both constraints (after symmetrization). The results for all language
pairs are in Figure 5. For ease of comparison, we choose a decoding threshold for HMM
models to achieve the recall of the corresponding IBM Model 4 and report precision.
Our methods always improve over the HMM by 10% to 15%, and improve over IBM
Model 4 nine times out of 12. Comparing the constraints with each other we see that

S-HMM performs better than B-HMM in 10 out of 12 cases. Because S-HMM indirectly
enforces bijectivity and models sequential correlations on both sides, this is perhaps not
surprising.

Figure 6 shows performance as a function of training data size. As before, we decode
to achieve the recall of IBM Model 4. For small training corpora adding the constraints
provides larger improvements (20–30%) but we still achieve significant gains even with
a million parallel sentences (15%). Greater improvements for small data sizes indicate
that our approach can be especially effective for resource-poor language pairs.

4.3 Rare vs. Common Words

One of the main benefits of using the posterior regularization constraints described is
an alleviation of the garbage collector effect (Brown et al. 1993a). Figure 7 breaks down
performance improvements by common versus rare words. As before, we use posterior
decoding, tuning the threshold to match IBM Model 4 recall. For common words, this
tuning maintains recall very close for all models so we do not show this in the figure. In
the top left panel of Figure 7, we see that precision of common words follows the pattern
we saw for the corpus overall: Symmetric and bijective outperform both IBM Model 4
and the baseline HMM, with symmetric slightly better than bijective. The results for
common words vary more slowly as we increase the quantity of training data than they
did for the full corpus. In the top right panel of Figure 7 we show the precision for rare
words. For the baseline HMM as well as for IBM Model 4, this is very low precisely
because of the garbage collector problem: Rare words become erroneously aligned to
untranslated words, leading to low precision. In fact the constrained models achieve
absolute precision improvements of up to 50% over the baseline. By removing these
erroneous alignments the translation table becomes more accurate, allowing higher re-
call on the full corpus. In the bottom panel of Figure 7, we observe a slightly diminished
recall for rare words. This slight drop in recall is due to moving the mass corresponding
to rare words to null.

4.4 Symmetrization

As discussed earlier, the word alignment models are asymmetric, whereas most appli-
cations require a single alignment for each sentence pair. Typically this is achieved by
a symmetrization heuristic that takes two directional alignments and produces a single

alignment. For MT the most commonly used heuristic is called grow diagonal final
(Och and Ney 2003). This starts with the intersection of the sets of aligned points and
adds points around the diagonal that are in the union of the two sets of aligned points.
The alignment produced has high recall relative to the intersection and only slightly
lower recall than the union. In syntax transfer the intersection heuristic is normally
used, because one wants to have high precision links to transfer knowledge between
languages. One pitfall of these symmetrization heuristics is that they can obfuscate the
link between the original alignment and the ones used for a specific task, making errors
more difficult to analyze. Because they are heuristics tuned for a particular phrase-
based translation system, it is not clear when they will help and when they will hinder
system performance. In this work we followed a more principled approach that uses

496

the knowledge about the posterior distributions of each directional model. We include a
point in the final alignment if the average of the posteriors under the two models for that
point is above a threshold. This heuristic is called soft union (DeNero and Klein 2007).
Figure 8 shows the Precision/Recall curves after symmetrization for the En-Fr corpus.
The posterior regularization–trained models still performed better, but the differences
get smaller after doing the symmetrization. This should not be very surprising, because
the soft union symmetrization can be viewed as an approximation of our symmetry
constraint applied only at decode time. Applying the symmetrization to the model with
symmetry constraints does not affect performance.

4.5 Analysis

In this section we discuss some scenarios in which the constraints make the alignments
better, and some scenarios where they fail. We have already discussed the garbage
collector effect and how both models address it. Both of the constraints also bias the
model to have at most probability one in any row or column of the posterior matrix,
encouraging 1-to-1 alignments. Obviously whenever alignments are systematically not
1-to-1 , this can lead to errors (for instance the examples described in Section 2).

An example presented in Figure 9 shows the posterior marginal distributions for an
English/French sentence pair using the same notation as in Figure 1. In the top panel of

from the top row; green = higher probability; red = lower probability.

Figure 9, we see the baseline models, where the English word met is incorrectly being
aligned to séance est ouverte. This makes it impossible to recover the correct alignment
house/séance. Either constraint corrects this problem. On the other hand, by enforcing
a 1-to-1 mapping the correct alignment met / est ouverte is lost. Going back to the first
row (regular HMM) this alignment is correct in one direction and absent in the other
(due to the many-to-1 model restriction) but we can recover that information using the
symmetrization heuristics, since the point is present at least in one direction with high
probability mass. This is not the case for the constraint-based models that reduce the
mass of that alignment in both directions. Going back to the right panel of Figure 8, we
can see that for low values of precision the HMM model actually achieves better recall
than the constraint-based methods. There are two possible solutions to alleviate this
type of problem, both with their caveats. One solution is to model the fertility of each
word in a way similar to IBM Model 4, or more generally to model alignments of multi-
ple words. This can lead to significant computational burden, and is not guaranteed to
improve results. A more complicated model may require approximations that destroy
its performance gain, or require larger corpora to estimate its parameters. Another
option is to perform some linguistically motivated pre-processing of the language pair
to conjoin words. This of course has the disadvantage that it needs to be specific to a
language pair in order to include information such as “English simple past is written
using a single word, so join together French passé composé.” An additional problem
with joining words to alleviate inter-language divergences is that it can increase data
sparsity.

5. Task-Specific Alignment Evaluation

In this section we evaluate the alignments resulting from using the proposed constraints
in two different tasks: Statistical machine translation where alignments are used to
restrict the number of possible minimal translation units; and syntax transfer, where
alignments are used to decide how to transfer dependency links.

5.1 Phrase-Based Machine Translation

We now investigate whether our alignments produce improvements in an end-to-end
phrase-based machine translation system. We use a state-of-the-art machine translation
system,5 and follow the experimental setup used for the 2008 shared task on machine
translation (ACL 2008 Third Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation). The full
pipeline consists of the following steps: (1) prepare the data (lowercase, tokenize, and
filter long sentences); (2) build language models; (3) create word alignments in each
direction; (4) symmetrize directional word alignments; (5) build phrase table; (6) tune
weights for the phrase table. For more details consult the shared task description.6 To
evaluate the quality of the produced alignments, we keep the pipeline unchanged, and
use the models described earlier to generate the word alignments in Step 3. For Step 4,
we use the soft union symmetrization heuristic. Symmetrization has almost no effect on
alignments produced by S-HMM, but we use it for uniformity in the experiments. We
tested three values of the threshold (0.2, 0.4, 0.6) which try to capture different tradeoffs

of precision vs. recall, and pick the best according to the translation performance on
development data. Table 2 summarizes the results for the different corpora. For refer-
ence we include IBM Model 4 as suggested in the task description. PR training always
outperforms EM training and outperforms IBM Model 4 in all but one experiment.
Differences in BLEU range from 0.2 to 0.9. The two constraints help to a different extent
for different corpora and translation directions, in a somewhat unpredictable manner.
In general our impression is that the connection between alignment quality and BLEU
scores is complicated, and changes are difficult to explain and justify. The number of
iterations for MERT optimization to converge varied from 2 to 28; and the best choice of
threshold on the development set did not always correspond to the best on the test set.
Contrary to conventional wisdom in the MT community, bigger phrase tables did not
always perform better. In 14 out of 18 cases, the threshold picked was 0.4 (medium size
phrase tables) and the other four times 0.2 was picked (smaller phrase tables). When
we include only high confidence alignments, more phrases are extracted but many of
these are erroneous. Potentially this leads to a poor estimate of the phrase probabilities.
See Lopez and Resnik (2006) for further discussion.

5.2 Syntax Transfer

In this section, we compare the different alignments produced with and without PR
based on how well they can be used for transfer of linguistic resources across languages.
We used the system proposed by Ganchev, Gillenwater, and Taskar (2009). This system
uses a word-aligned corpus and a parser for a resource-rich language (source language)
in order to create a parser for a resource-poor language (target language). We consider
a parse tree on the source language as a set of dependency edges to be transferred. For
each such edge, if both end points are aligned to words in the target language, then
the edge is transferred. These edges are then used as weak supervision when training
a generative or discriminative dependency parser. In order to evaluate the alignments
we computed the fraction of correctly transferred edges as a function of the average
number of edges transferred by using supervised parse trees on the target side. By
changing the threshold in MBR decoding of alignments, we can trade off accuracy of the
transferred edges vs. transferring more edges. We generated supervised parses using
the first-order model from the MST parser (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005)
trained on the Penn Treebank for English and the CoNLL X parses for Bulgarian and
Spanish. Following Ganchev, Gillenwater, and Taskar (2009), we filter alignment links
between words with incompatible POS tags. Figure 10 shows our results for transferring
from English to Bulgarian (En→Bg) and from English to Spanish (En→Es). The En→Bg

results are based on a corpus of movie subtitles (Tiedemann 2007), and are consequently
shorter sentences, whereas the En→Es results are based on a corpus of parliamentary
proceedings (Koehn 2005). We see in Figure 10 that for both domains, the models trained
using posterior regularization perform better than the baseline model trained using EM.

6. Related Work

The idea of introducing constraints over a model to better guide the learning process
has appeared before. In the context of word alignment, Deng and Byrne (2005) use a
state-duration HMM in order to model word-to-phrase translations. The fertility of each
source word is implicitly encoded in the durations of the HMM states. Without any
restrictions, likelihood prefers to always use longer phrases and the authors try to con-
trol this behavior by multiplying every transition probability by a constant η > 1. This
encourages more transitions and hence shorter phrases. For the task of unsupervised
dependency parsing, Smith and Eisner (2006) add a constraint of the form “the average
length of dependencies should be X” to capture the locality of syntax (at least half
of the dependencies are between adjacent words), using a scheme they call structural
annealing. They modify the model’s distribution over trees pθ(y) by a penalty term
as: p

′
θ(y) ∝ pθ(y)e

(δ
∑

e∈y length(e)), where length(e) is the surface length of edge e. The
factor δ changes from a high value to a lower one so that the preference for short edges
(hence a smaller sum) is stronger at the start of training.

These two approaches also have the goal of controlling unsupervised learning, and
the form of the modified distributions is reminiscent of the form that the projected
posteriors take. However, the approaches differ substantially from PR. Smith and Eisner
(2006) make a statement of the form “scale the total length of edges”, which depending
on the value of δ will prefer to have more shorter/longer edges. Such statements are
not data dependent. Depending on the value of δ, for instance if δ ≤ 0, even if the data
is such that the model already uses too many short edges on average, this value of
δ will push for more short edges. By contrast the statements we can make in PR are
of the form “there should be more short edges than long edges”. Such a statement is
data-dependent in the sense that if the model satisfies the constraints then we do not
need to change it; if it is far from satisfying it we might need to make very dramatic
changes.

Graça, Ganchev, and Taskar Learning Alignment Models with Complex Constraints

PR is closely related to the work of Mann and McCallum (2007, 2008), who concur-
rently developed the idea of using penalties based on posterior expectations of features
to guide semi-supervised learning. They call their method generalized expectation (GE)
constraints or alternatively expectation regularization. In the original GE framework,
the posteriors of the model on unlabeled data are regularized directly. They train a
discriminative model, using conditional likelihood on labeled data and an “expectation
regularization” penalty term on the unlabeled data:

arg max
θ

Llabeled(θ) − λÊ[||Epθ [f(x, z) − b||
2
2]. (16)

Notice that there is no intermediate distribution q. For some kinds of constraints this
objective is difficult to optimize in θ and in order to improve efficiency, Bellare, Druck,
and McCallum (2009) propose interpreting the PR framework as an approximation
to the GE objective in Equation (16). They compare the two frameworks on several
data sets and find that performance is similar. Liang, Jordan, and Klein (2009) cast
the problem of incorporating partial information about latent variables into a Bayesian
framework using “measurements,” and after several approximation steps, they arrive
at the objective we optimize.

The idea of jointly training two directional models has been explored by Liang,
Taskar, and Klein (2006), although under a very different formalization. They de-

7. Conclusion

In this article we explored a novel learning framework, Posterior Regularization, for
incorporating rich constraints over the posterior distributions of word alignments. We
focused on the HMM word alignment model, and showed how we could incorpo-
rate complex constraints like bijectivity and symmetry while keeping the inference
in the model tractable. Using these constraints we showed consistent and significant
improvements in six different language pairs even when compared to a more complex
model such as IBM Model 4. In addition to alleviating the “garbage collector” effect, we
show that the obtained posterior distributions better reflect the desired alignments. Both
constraints are biasing the models towards 1-to-1 alignments, which may be inappro-
priate in some situations, and we show some systematic mistakes that the constraints
introduce and suggest possible fixes.

We experimented with two different tasks that rely on word alignments, phrase-
based MT and syntax transfer. For phrase-based MT, the improved alignments lead
to a modest increase in BLEU performance. For syntax transfer, we have shown that
the number of edges of a dependency tree that can be accurately transferred from one
language to another increases as a result of improved alignments.

Our framework opens up the possibility of efficiently adding many other con-
straints that are directly applicable to word alignments, such as preferring alignments
that respect dependency tree structure, part of speech tags, or syntactic boundaries.
