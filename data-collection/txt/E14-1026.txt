Abstract

We present a simple preordering approach
for machine translation based on a feature-
rich logistic regression model to predict
whether two children of the same node
in the source-side parse tree should be
swapped or not. Given the pair-wise chil-
dren regression scores we conduct an effi-
cient depth-first branch-and-bound search
through the space of possible children per-
mutations, avoiding using a cascade of
classifiers or limiting the list of possi-
ble ordering outcomes. We report exper-
iments in translating English to Japanese
and Korean, demonstrating superior per-
formance as (a) the number of crossing
links drops by more than 10% absolute
with respect to other state-of-the-art pre-
ordering approaches, (b) BLEU scores im-
prove on 2.2 points over the baseline with
lexicalised reordering model, and (c) de-
coding can be carried out 80 times faster.

1 Introduction

Source-side preordering for translation is the task
of rearranging the order of a given source sen-
tence so that it best resembles the order of the tar-
get sentence. It is a divide-and-conquer strategy
aiming to decouple long-range word movement
from the core translation task. The main advan-
tage is that translation becomes computationally
cheaper as less word movement needs to be con-
sidered, which results in faster and better transla-
tions, if preordering is done well and efficiently.
Preordering also can facilitate better estimation
of alignment and translation models as the paral-
lel data becomes more monotonically-aligned, and

∗This work was done during an internship of the first au-
thor at SDL Research, Cambridge.

translation gains can be obtained for various sys-
tem architectures, e.g. phrase-based, hierarchical
phrase-based, etc.

For these reasons, preordering has a clear re-
search and commercial interest, as reflected by the
extensive previous work on the subject (see Sec-
tion 2). From these approaches, we are particu-
larly interested in those that (i) involve little or no
human intervention, (ii) require limited computa-
tional resources at runtime, and (iii) make use of
available linguistic analysis tools.

In this paper we propose a novel preordering
approach based on a logistic regression model
trained to predict whether to swap nodes in
the source-side dependency tree. For each pair
of sibling nodes in the tree, the model uses a
feature-rich representation that includes lexical
cues to make relative reordering predictions be-
tween them. Given these predictions, we conduct
a depth-first branch-and-bound search through
the space of possible permutations of all sibling
nodes, using the regression scores to guide the
search. This approach has multiple advantages.
First, the search for permutations is efficient and
does not require specific heuristics or hard limits
for nodes with many children. Second, the inclu-
sion of the regression prediction directly into the
search allows for finer-grained global decisions as
the predictions that the model is more confident
about are preferred. Finally, the use of a single
regression model to handle any number of child
nodes avoids incurring sparsity issues, while al-
lowing the integration of a vast number of features
into the preordering model.

We empirically contrast our proposed method
against another preordering approach based on
automatically-extracted rules when translating En-
glish into Japanese and Korean. We demonstrate
a significant reduction in number of crossing links
of more than 10% absolute, as well as translation
gains of over 2.2 BLEU points over the baseline.

We also show it outperforms a multi-class classifi-
cation approach and analyse why this is the case.

2 Related work

One useful way to organize previous preordering
techniques is by how they incorporate linguistic
knowledge.

On one end of the spectrum we find those ap-
proaches that rely on syntactic parsers and hu-
man knowledge, typically encoded via a set of
hand-crafted rules for parse tree rewriting or trans-
formation. Examples of these can be found
for French-English (Xia and McCord, 2004),
German-English (Collins et al., 2005), Chinese-
English (Wang et al., 2007), English-Arabic (Badr
et al., 2009), English-Hindi (Ramanathan et al.,
2009), English-Korean (Hong et al., 2009), and
English-Japanese (Lee et al., 2010; Isozaki et
al., 2010). A generic set of rules for transform-
ing SVO to SOV languages has also been de-
scribed (Xu et al., 2009). The main advantage of
these approaches is that a relatively small set of
good rules can yield significant improvements in
translation. The common criticism they receive is
that they are language-specific.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are pre-
ordering models that rely neither on human knowl-
edge nor on syntactic analysis, but only on word
alignments. One such approach is to form a cas-
cade of two translation systems, where the first
one translates the source to its preordered ver-
sion (Costa-jussà and Fonollosa, 2006). Alterna-
tively, one can define models that assign a cost to
the relative position of each pair of words in the
sentence, and search for the sequence that opti-
mizes the global score as a linear ordering prob-
lem (Tromble and Eisner, 2009) or as a travel-
ing salesman problem (Visweswariah et al., 2011).
Yet another line of work attempts to automatically
induce a parse tree and a preordering model from
word alignments (DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011;
Neubig et al., 2012). These approaches are at-
tractive due to their minimal reliance on linguistic
knowledge. However, their findings reveal that the
best performance is obtained when using human-
aligned data which is expensive to create.

Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum are
works that rely on automatic source-language syn-
tactic parses, but no direct human intervention.
Preordering rules can be automatically extracted
from word alignments and constituent trees (Li

et al., 2007; Habash, 2007; Visweswariah et
al., 2010), dependency trees (Genzel, 2010) or
predicate-argument structures (Wu et al., 2011),
or simply part-of-speech sequences (Crego and
Mariño, 2006; Rottmann and Vogel, 2007). Rules
are assigned a cost based on Maximum En-
tropy (Li et al., 2007) or Maximum Likelihood es-
timation (Visweswariah et al., 2010), or directly
on their ability to make the training corpus more
monotonic (Genzel, 2010). The latter performs
very well in practice but comes at the cost of a
brute-force extraction heuristic that cannot incor-
porate lexical information. Recently, other ap-
proaches treat ordering the children of a node as
a learning to rank (Yang et al., 2012) or discrimi-
native multi-classification task (Lerner and Petrov,
2013). These are appealing for their use of finer-
grained lexical information, but they struggle to
adequately handle nodes with multiple children.

Our approach is closely related to this latter
work, as we are interested in feature-rich discrim-
inative approaches that automatically learn pre-
ordering rules from source-side dependency trees.
Similarly to Yang et al. (2012) we train a large
discriminative linear model, but rather than model
each child’s position in an ordered list of children,
we model a more natural pair-wise swap / no-swap
preference (like Tromble and Eisner (2009) did at
the word level). We then incorporate this model
into a global, efficient branch-and-bound search
through the space of permutations. In this way, we
avoid an error-prone cascade of classifiers or any
limit on the possible ordering outcomes (Lerner
and Petrov, 2013).

3 Preordering using logistic regression
and branch-and-bound search

Like Genzel (2010), our method starts with depen-
dency parses of source sentences (which we con-
vert to shallow constituent trees; see Figure 1 for
an example), and reorders the source text by per-
muting sibling nodes in the parse tree. For each
non-terminal node, we first apply a logistic regres-
sion model which predicts, for each pair of child
nodes, the probability that they should be swapped
or kept in their original order. We then apply
a depth-first branch-and-bound search to find the
global optimal reordering of children.

3.1 Logistic regression

We build a regression model that assigns a prob-
ability of swapping any two sibling nodes, a and
b, in the source-side dependency tree. The proba-
bility of swapping them is denoted p(a, b) and the
probability of keeping them in their original order
is 1 − p(a, b). We use LIBLINEAR (Fan et al.,
2008) for training an L1-regularised logistic re-
gression model based on positively and negatively
labelled samples.

3.1.1 Training data
We generate training examples for the logistic re-
gression from word-aligned parallel data which is
annotated with source-side dependency trees. For
each non-terminal node, we extract all possible
pairs of child nodes. For each pair, we obtain a
binary label y ∈ {−1, 1} by calculating whether
swapping the two nodes would reduce the number
of crossing alignment links. The crossing score of
having two nodes a and b in the given order is

cs(a, b) := |{(i, j) ∈ Aa ×Ab : i > j}|

where Aa and Ab are the target-side positions to
which the words spanned by a and b are aligned.
The label is then given as

y(a, b) =
{

1 , cs(a, b) > cs(b, a)
−1 , cs(b, a) > cs(a, b)

Instances for which cs(a, b) = cs(b, a) are not
included in the training data. This usually happens
if either Aa or Ab is empty, and in this case the
alignments provide no indication of which order
is better. We also discard any samples from nodes
that have more than 16 children, as these are rare
cases that often result from parsing errors.

space of permutations for a dependency tree node
with four children. The gray node marks a goal
node. For the root node of the tree in Figure 1, the
permutation corresponding to this path (1,4,3,2)
would produce “he the smell stand could”.

3.1.2 Features
Using a machine learning setup allows us to in-
corporate fine-grained information in the form of
features. We use the following features to charac-
terise pairs of nodes:

l The dependency labels of each node
t The part-of-speech tags of each node.
hw The head words and classes of each node.
lm, rm The left-most and right-most words and classes

of a node.
dst The distances between each node and the head.
gap If there is a gap between nodes, the left-most

and right-most words and classes in the gap.

In order to keep the size of our feature space
manageable, we only consider features which oc-
cur at least 5 times1. For the lexical features, we
use the top 100 vocabulary items from our training
data, and 51 clusters generated by mkcls (Och,
1999). Similarly to previous work (Genzel, 2010;
Yang et al., 2012), we also explore feature con-
junctions. For the tag and label classes, we gen-
erate all possible combinations up to a given size.
For the lexical and distance features, we explicitly
specify conjunctions with the tag and label fea-
tures. Results for various feature configurations
are discussed in Section 4.3.1.

3.2 Search

For each non-terminal node in the source-side de-
pendency tree, we search for the best possible

permutation of its children. We define the score
of a permutation π as the product of the proba-
bilities of its node pair orientations (swapped or
unswapped):

score(π) =
∏

1≤i<j≤k|π[i]>π[j]
p(i, j)

·
∏

1≤i<j≤k|π[i]<π[j]
1− p(i, j)

Here, we represent a permutation π of k nodes
as a k-length sequence containing each integer in
{1, ..., k} exactly once. Define a partial permu-
tation of k nodes as a k′ < k length sequence
containing each integer in {1, ..., k} at most once.
We can construct a search space over partial per-
mutations in the natural way (see Figure 2). The
root node represents the empty sequence � and has
score 1. Then, given a search node representing
a k′-length partial permutation π′, its successor
nodes are obtained by extending it by one element:

score(π′ · 〈i〉) = score(π′)
·

∏
j∈V |i>j

p(i, j)

·
∏

j∈V |i<j
1− p(i, j)

where V = {1, ..., k}\(π′ · 〈i〉) is the set of source
child positions that have not yet been visited. Ob-
serve that the nodes at search depth k correspond
exactly to the set of complete permutations. To
search this space, we employ depth-first branch-
and-bound (Balas and Toth, 1983) as our search
algorithm. The idea of branch-and-bound is to
remember the best scoring goal node found thus
far, abandoning any partial paths that cannot lead
to a better scoring goal node. Algorithm 1 gives
pseudocode for the algorithm2. If the initial bound
(bound0) is set to 0, the search is guaranteed to
find the optimal solution. By raising the bound,
which acts as an under-estimate of the best scor-
ing permutation, search can be faster but possibly
fail to find any solution. All our experiments were
done with bound0 = 0, i.e. exact search, but we
discuss search time in detail and pruning alterna-
tives in Section 4.3.2.

Since we use a logistic regression model and in-
corporate its predictions directly as swap probabil-
ities, our search prefers those permutations with
swaps which the model is more confident about.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup

We report translation results in English-to-
Japanese/Korean. Our corpora are comprised of
generic parallel data extracted from the web, with
some documents extracted manually and some au-
tomatically crawled. Both have about 6M sentence
pairs and roughly 100M words per language.

The dev and test sets are also generic. Source
sentences were extracted from the web and one
target reference was produced by a bilingual
speaker. These sentences were chosen to evenly
represent 10 domains, including world news,
chat/SMS, health, sport, science, business, and
others. The dev/test sets contain 602/903 sen-
tences and 14K/20K words each. We do English
part-of-speech tagging using SVMTool (Giménez
and Màrquez, 2004) and dependency parsing us-
ing MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).

For translation experiments, we use a phrase-
based decoder that incorporates a set of standard
features and a hierarchical reordering model (Gal-
ley and Manning, 2008) with weights tuned us-
ing MERT to optimize the character-based BLEU
score on the dev set. The Japanese and Korean lan-
guage models are 5-grams estimated on > 350M
words of generic web text.

For training the logistic regression model, we
automatically align the parallel training data and
intersect the source-to-target and target-to-source
alignments. We reserve a random 5K-sentence

subset for intrinsic evaluation of preordering, and
use the remainder for model parameter estimation.

We evaluate our preordering approach with lo-
gistic regression and depth-first branch-and-bound
search (in short, ‘df-bnb’) both in terms of reorder-
ing via crossing score reduction on the heldout set,
and in terms of translation quality as measured by
character-based BLEU on the test set.

4.2 Preordering baselines

We contrast our work against two data-driven pre-
ordering approaches. First, we implemented the
rule-based approach of Genzel (2010) and opti-
mised its multiple parameters for our task. We
report only the best results achieved, which corre-
spond to using ∼100K training sentences for rule
extraction, applying a sliding window width of 3
children, and creating rule sequences of∼60 rules.
This approach cannot incorporate lexical features
as that would make the brute-force rule extraction
algorithm unmanageable.

We also implemented a multi-class classifica-
tion setup where we directly predict complete per-
mutations of children nodes using multi-class clas-
sification (Lerner and Petrov, 2013). While this
is straightforward for small numbers of children,
it leads to a very large number of possible per-
mutations for larger sets of children nodes, mak-
ing classification too difficult. While Lerner and
Petrov (2013) use a cascade of classifiers and im-
pose a hard limit on the possible reordering out-
comes to solve this, we follow Genzel’s heuristic:
rather than looking at the complete set of children,
we apply a sliding window of size 3 starting from
the left, and make classification/reordering deci-
sions for each window separately. Since the win-
dows overlap, decisions made for the first window
affect the order of nodes in the second window,
etc. We address this by soliciting decisions from
the classifier on the fly as we preorder. One lim-

racy improve with training data size.

itation of this approach is that it is able to move
children only within the window. We try to rem-
edy this by applying the method iteratively, each
time re-training the classifier on the preordered
data from the previous run.

4.3 Crossing score

We now report contrastive results in the intrin-
sic preordering task, as measured by the num-
ber of crossing links (Genzel, 2010; Yang et al.,
2012) on the 5K held-out set. Without preorder-
ing, there is an average of 22.2 crossing links in
English-Japanese and 20.2 in English-Korean. Ta-
ble 1 shows what percentage of these links re-
main after applying each preordering approach to
the data. We find that the ‘df-bnb’ method out-
performs the other approaches in both language
pairs, achieving more than 10 additional percent-
age points reduction over the rule-based approach.
Interestingly, the multi-class approach is not able
to match the rule-based approach despite using ad-
ditional lexical cues. We hypothesise that this is
due to the sliding window heuristic, which causes
a mismatch in train-test conditions: while samples
are not independent of each other at test time due
to window overlaps, they are considered to be so
when training the classifier.

4.3.1 Impact of training size and feature
configuration

We now report the effects of feature configura-
tion and training data size for the English-Japanese
case. We assess our ‘df-bnb’ approach in terms of
the classification accuracy of the trained logistic

regression model (using it to predict ±1 labels in
the held-out set) and by the percentage of crossing
alignment links reduced by preordering.

Figure 3 shows the performance of the logistic
regression model over different training set sizes,
extracted from the training corpus as described in
Section 3. We observe a constant increase in pre-
diction accuracy, mirrored by a steady decrease in
crossing score. However, gains are less for more
than 8M training examples. Note that a small vari-
ation in accuracy can produce a large variation in
crossing score if two nodes are swapped which
have a large number of crossing alignments.

Table 2 shows an ablation test for various fea-
ture configurations. We start with all features, in-
cluding head word and class (hw), left-most and
right-most word in each node’s span (lm, rm), each
node’s distance to the head (dst), and left-most
and right-most word of the gap between nodes
(gap). We then proceed by removing features to
end with only label and tag features (l,t), as in
Genzel (2010). For each configuration, we gener-
ated all tag- and label- combinations of size 2. We
then specified combinations between tag and label
and all other features. For the lexical features we
always used conjunctions of the word itself, and its
class. Class information is included for all words,
not just those in the top 100 vocabulary. Table 2
shows that lexical and distance feature groups con-
tribute to prediction accuracy and crossing score,
except for the gap features, which we omit from
further experiments.

4.3.2 Run time

We now demonstrate the efficiency of branch-and-
bound search for the problem of finding the opti-
mum permutation of n children at runtime. Even
though in the worst case the search could ex-
plore all n! permutations, making it prohibitive for

Figure 4: Average number of nodes explored in
branch-and-bound search by number of children.

nodes with many children, in practice this does
not happen. Many low-scoring paths are discarded
early by branch-and-bound search so that the opti-
mal solution can be found quickly. The top curve
in Figure 4 shows the average number of nodes
explored in searches run on our validation set (5K
sentences) as a function of the number of children.
All instances are far from the worst case3.

In our experiments, the time needed to conduct
exact search (bound0 = 0) was not a problem ex-
cept for a few bad cases (nodes with more than 16
children), which we simply chose not to preorder;
in our data, 90% of the nodes have less than 6 chil-
dren, while only 0.9% have 10 children or more, so
this omission does not affect performance notice-
ably. We verified this on our held-out set, by car-
rying out exhaustive searches. We found that not
preordering nodes with 16 children did not worsen
the crossing score. In fact, setting a harsher limit
of 10 nodes would still produce a crossing score
of 51.9%, compared to the best score of 51.4%.

There are various ways to speed up the search,
if needed. First, one could impose a hard limit
on the number of explored nodes4. As shown
in Figure 4, a limit of 4K would still allow ex-
act search on average for permutations of up to
11 children, while stopping search early for more
children. We tested this for limits of 1K/4K nodes
and obtained crossing scores of 51.9/51.5%. Al-
ternatively, one could define a higher initial bound;
since the score of a path is a product of proba-
bilities, one would select a threshold probability

3Note that 12!≈479M nodes, whereas our search finds the
optimal permutation path after exploring <10K nodes.

4As long as the limit exceeds the permutation length, a
solution will always be found as search is depth-first.

The curve labels show the crossing score produced

centage of searches that fail to find a solution with
a better score than bound0, in which case children
are left in their original order. As shown, this strat-
egy proves less effective than simply limiting the
number of explored nodes, because the more fre-
quent cases with less children remain unaffected.

4.4 Translation performance

Table 3 reports English-Japanese translation re-
sults for two different values of the distortion limit
d, i.e. the maximum number of source words that
the decoder is allowed to jump during search. We
draw the following conclusions. Firstly, all the
preordering approaches outperform the baseline
and the BLEU score gain they provide increases as
the distortion limit decreases. This is further anal-
ysed in Figure 5, where we report BLEU as a func-
tion of the distortion limit in decoding for both
English-Japanese and English-Korean. This re-
veals the power of preordering as a targeted strat-
egy to obtain high performance at fast decoding
times, since d can be drastically reduced with-
out performance degradation which leads to huge
decoding speed-ups; this is consistent with the
observations in (Xu et al., 2009; Genzel, 2010;
Visweswariah et al., 2011). We also find that with
preordering it is possible to apply harsher pruning
conditions in decoding while still maintaining the

tion limit in decoder (+LRM case). Top: English-
Japanese. Bottom: English-Korean.

exact same performance, achieving further speed-
ups. With preordering, our system is able to de-
code 80 times faster while producing translation
output of the same quality.

Secondly, we observe that the preordering
gains, which are correlated with the crossing score
reductions of Table 1, are largely orthogonal to
the gains obtained when incorporating a lexi-
calised reordering model (LRM). In fact, preorder-
ing gains are slightly larger with LRM, suggest-
ing that this reordering model can be better esti-
mated with preordered text. This echoes the notion
that reordering models are particularly sensitive
to alignment noise (DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011;
Neubig et al., 2012; Visweswariah et al., 2013),
and that a ‘more monotonic’ training corpus leads
to better translation models.

Finally, ‘df-bnb’ outperforms all other preorder-
ing approaches, and achieves an extra 0.5–0.8
BLEU over the rule-based one even at zero distor-
tion limit. This is consistent with the substantial
crossing score reductions reported in Section 4.3.

We argue that these improvements are due to
the usage of lexical features to facilitate finer-
grained ordering decisions, and to our better
search through the children permutation space
which is not restricted by sliding windows, does

not depend heavily on getting the right decision
in a multi-class scenario, and which incorporates
regression to carry out a score-driven search.

4.5 Analysis

Table 4 gives three English-Japanese examples
to illustrate the different preordering approaches.
The first, very short, example is preordered cor-
rectly by the rule-based and the df-bnb approach,
as the order of the brackets matches the order of
the Japanese reference.

For longer sentences we see more differences
between approaches, as illustrated by Example 2.
In this case, both approaches succeed at moving
prepositions to the back of the phrase (“my expe-
rience in”, “the bus of”). However, while the df-
bnb approach correctly moves the predicate of the
second clause (“was just tired”) to the back, the
rule-based approach incorrectly moves the subject
(“a black woman named Rosa Parks”) to this posi-
tion - possibly because of the verb “named” which
occurs in the phrase. This could be an indication
that the df-bnb is better suited for more compli-
cated constructions. With the exception of phrases
4 and 8, all other phrases are in the correct order
in the df-bnb reordering. None of the approaches
manage to reorder “a black woman named Rosa
Parks” to the correct order.

Example 3 shows that the translations into
Japanese also reflect preordering quality. The

original source results in “like” being translated
as the main verb (which is incorrectly interpreted
as “to be like, to be equal to”). The rule-based
version correctly moves “have come” to the end,
but fails to swap “xi’an” and “like”, resulting in
“come” being interpreted as a full verb, rather than
an auxiliary. Only the df-bnb version achieves al-
most perfect reordering, resulting in the correct
word choice of なる (to get to, to become) for
“have come to”.5

5 Conclusion

We have presented a novel preordering approach
that estimates a preference for swapping or not
swapping pairs of children nodes in the source-
side dependency tree by training a feature-rich
logistic regression model. Given the pair-wise
scores, we efficiently search through the space
of possible children permutations using depth-first
branch-and-bound search. The approach is able
to incorporate large numbers of features includ-
ing lexical cues, is efficient at runtime even with
a large number of children, and proves superior to
other state-of-the-art preordering approaches both
in terms of crossing score and translation perfor-
mance.

5This translation is still not perfect, since it uses the wrong
level of politeness, an important distinction in Japanese.
