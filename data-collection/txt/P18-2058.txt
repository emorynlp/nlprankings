Abstract

Recent BIO-tagging-based neural seman-
tic role labeling models are very high per-
forming, but assume gold predicates as
part of the input and cannot incorporate
span-level features. We propose an end-
to-end approach for jointly predicting all
predicates, arguments spans, and the rela-
tions between them. The model makes in-
dependent decisions about what relation-
ship, if any, holds between every possi-
ble word-span pair, and learns contextu-
alized span representations that provide
rich, shared input features for each deci-
sion. Experiments demonstrate that this
approach sets a new state of the art on
PropBank SRL without gold predicates.1

1 Introduction

Semantic role labeling (SRL) captures predicate-
argument relations, such as “who did what to
whom.” Recent high-performing SRL models (He
et al., 2017; Marcheggiani et al., 2017; Tan et al.,
2018) are BIO-taggers, labeling argument spans
for a single predicate at a time (as shown in Fig-
ure 1). They are typically only evaluated with gold
predicates, and must be pipelined with error-prone
predicate identification models for deployment.

We propose an end-to-end approach for predict-
ing all the predicates and their argument spans in
one forward pass. Our model builds on a recent
coreference resolution model (Lee et al., 2017),
by making central use of learned, contextualized
span representations. We use these representations
to predict SRL graphs directly over text spans.
Each edge is identified by independently predict-
ing which role, if any, holds between every possi-
ble pair of text spans, while using aggressive beam

pruning for efficiency. The final graph is simply
the union of predicted SRL roles (edges) and their
associated text spans (nodes).

Our span-graph formulation overcomes a key
limitation of semi-markov and BIO-based mod-
els (Kong et al., 2016; Zhou and Xu, 2015; Yang
and Mitchell, 2017; He et al., 2017; Tan et al.,
2018): it can model overlapping spans across
different predicates in the same output structure
(see Figure 1). The span representations also
generalize the token-level representations in BIO-
based models, letting the model dynamically de-
cide which spans and roles to include, without
using previously standard syntactic features (Pun-
yakanok et al., 2008; FitzGerald et al., 2015).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
span-based SRL model that does not assume that
predicates are given. In this more realistic set-
ting, where the predicate must be predicted, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PropBank. It also reinforces the strong perfor-
mance of similar span embedding methods for
coreference (Lee et al., 2017), suggesting that this
style of models could be used for other span-span
relation tasks, such as syntactic parsing (Stern
et al., 2017), relation extraction (Miwa and Bansal,
2016), and QA-SRL (FitzGerald et al., 2018).

2 Model

We consider the space of possible predicates to
be all the tokens in the input sentence, and the
space of arguments to be all continuous spans. Our
model decides what relation exists between each
predicate-argument pair (including no relation).

Formally, given a sequence X = w1, . . . , wn,
we wish to predict a set of labeled predicate-
argument relations Y ⊆ P × A × L, where P =
{w1, . . . , wn} is the set of all tokens (predicates),
A = {(wi, . . . , wj) | 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n} contains
all the spans (arguments), and L is the space of
semantic role labels, including a null label � indi-
cating no relation. The final SRL output would be
all the non-empty relations {(p, a, l) ∈ Y | l 6= �}.

We then define a set of random variables, where
each random variable yp,a corresponds to a predi-
cate p ∈ P and an argument a ∈ A, taking value
from the discrete label space L. The random vari-
ables yp,a are conditionally independent of each
other given the input X:

P (Y | X) =
∏

p∈P,a∈A
P (yp,a | X) (1)

P (yp,a = l | X) =
exp(φ(p, a, l))∑

l′∈L
exp(φ(p, a, l′))

(2)

Where φ(p, a, l) is a scoring function for a pos-
sible (predicate, argument, label) combination. φ
is decomposed into two unary scores on the pred-
icate and the argument (defined in Section 3), as
well as a label-specific score for the relation:

φ(p, a, l) = Φa(a) + Φp(p) + Φ
(l)
rel (a, p) (3)

The score for the null label is set to a constant:
φ(p, a, �) = 0, similar to logistic regression.

Learning For each input X , we minimize the
negative log likelihood of the gold structure Y ∗:

J (X) =− logP (Y ∗ | X) (4)

Beam pruning As our model deals with O(n2)
possible argument spans and O(n) possible pred-
icates, it needs to consider O(n3|L|) possible re-
lations, which is computationally impractical. To
overcome this issue, we define two beams Ba and
Bp for storing the candidate arguments and pred-
icates, respectively. The candidates in each beam
are ranked by their unary score (Φa or Φp). The
sizes of the beams are limited by λan and λpn. El-
ements that fall out of the beam do not participate

in computing the edge factors Φ(l)rel , reducing the
overall number of relational factors evaluated by
the model to O(n2|L|). We also limit the max-
imum width of spans to a fixed number W (e.g.
W = 30), further reducing the number of com-
puted unary factors to O(n).

3 Neural Architecture

Our model builds contextualized representations
for argument spans a and predicate words p based
on BiLSTM outputs (Figure 2) and uses feed-
forward networks to compute the factor scores in
φ(p, a, l) described in Section 2 (Figure 3).

Word-level contexts The bottom layer con-
sists of pre-trained word embeddings con-
catenated with character-based representations,
i.e. for each token wi, we have xi =
[WORDEMB(wi); CHARCNN(wi)]. We then con-
textualize each xi using an m-layered bidirec-
tional LSTM with highway connections (Zhang
et al., 2016), which we denote as x̄i.

Argument and predicate representation We
build contextualized representations for all can-
didate arguments a ∈ A and predicates p ∈
P . The argument representation contains the fol-
lowing: end points from the BiLSTM outputs
(x̄START(a), x̄END(a)), a soft head word xh(a), and
embedded span width features f(a), similar to Lee
et al. (2017). The predicate representation is sim-
ply the BiLSTM output at the position INDEX(p).

g(a) =[x̄START(a); x̄END(a); xh(a); f(a)] (5)

g(p) =x̄INDEX(p) (6)

The soft head representation xh(a) is an attention
mechanism over word inputs x in the argument
span, where the weights e(a) are computed via a
linear layer over the BiLSTM outputs x̄.

xh(a) = xSTART(a):END(a)e(s)
ᵀ (7)

e(a) = SOFTMAX(wᵀe x̄START(a):END(a)) (8)

xSTART(a):END(a) is a shorthand for stacking a list
of vectors xt, where START(a) ≤ t ≤ END(a).

Scoring The scoring functions Φ are imple-
mented with feed-forward networks based on the
predicate and argument representations g:

Φa(a) =w
ᵀ
a MLPa(g(a)) (9)

Φp(p) =w
ᵀ
pMLPp(g(p)) (10)

Φ
(l)
rel (a, p) =w

4 Experiments

We experiment on the CoNLL 2005 (Carreras and
Màrquez, 2005) and CoNLL 2012 (OntoNotes 5.0,
(Pradhan et al., 2013)) benchmarks, using two
SRL setups: end-to-end and gold predicates. In
the end-to-end setup, a system takes a tokenized
sentence as input, and predicts all the predicates
and their arguments. Systems are evaluated on the
micro-averaged F1 for correctly predicting (pred-
icate, argument span, label) tuples. For compari-
son with previous systems, we also report results
with gold predicates, in which the complete set of
predicates in the input sentence is given as well.
Other experimental setups and hyperparameteres
are listed in Appendix A.1.

ELMo embeddings To further improve perfor-
mance, we also add ELMo word representations
(Peters et al., 2018) to the BiLSTM input (in the
+ELMo rows). Since the contextualized represen-
tations ELMo provides can be applied to most pre-
vious neural systems, the improvement is orthog-
onal to our contribution. In Table 1 and 2, we
organize all the results into two categories: the
comparable single model systems, and the mod-

els augmented with ELMo or ensembling (in the
PoE rows).

End-to-end results As shown in Table 1,2 our
joint model outperforms the previous best pipeline
system (He et al., 2017) by an F1 difference of
anywhere between 1.3 and 6.0 in every setting.
The improvement is larger on the Brown test set,
which is out-of-domain, and the CoNLL 2012 test
set, which contains nominal predicates. On all
datasets, our model is able to predict over 40% of
the sentences completely correctly.

Results with gold predicates To compare with
additional previous systems, we also conduct ex-
periments with gold predicates by constraining
our predicate beam to be gold predicates only.
As shown in Table 2, our model significantly
out-performs He et al. (2017), but falls short of
Tan et al. (2018), a very recent attention-based
(Vaswani et al., 2017) BIO-tagging model that was
developed concurrently with our work. By adding
the contextualized ELMo representations, we are
able to out-perform all previous systems, includ-
ing Peters et al. (2018), which applies ELMo to
the SRL model introduced in He et al. (2017).

5 Analysis

Our model’s architecture differs significantly from
previous BIO systems in terms of both input and
decision space. To better understand our model’s
strengths and weaknesses, we perform three anal-
yses following Lee et al. (2017) and He et al.
(2017), studying (1) the effectiveness of beam

2For the end-to-end setting on CoNLL 2012, we used a
subset of the train/dev data from previous work due to noise
in the dataset; the dev result is not directly comparable. See
Appendix A.2 for detailed explanation.

pendencies, (3) agreement with syntactic spans,
and (4) the ability to predict globally consistent
SRL structures. The analyses are performed on
the development sets without using ELMo embed-
dings. 3

Effectiveness of beam pruning Figure 4 shows
the predicate and argument spans kept in the beam,
sorted with their unary scores. Our model effi-
ciently prunes unlikely argument spans and pred-
icates, significantly reduces the number of edges
it needs to consider. Figure 5 shows the recall of
predicate words on the CoNLL 2012 development
set. By retaining λp = 0.4 predicates per word,
we are able to keep over 99.7% argument-bearing
predicates. Compared to having a part-of-speech
tagger (POS:X in Figure 5), our joint beam prun-
ing allowing the model to have a soft trade-off be-
tween efficiency and recall.4

Long-distance dependencies Figure 6 shows
the performance breakdown by binned distance
between arguments to the given predicates. Our
model is better at accurately predicting arguments
that are farther away from the predicates, even

3For comparability with prior work, analyses (2)-(4) are
performed on the CoNLL 05 dev set with gold predicates.

4The predicate ID accuracy of our model is not compa-
rable with that reported in He et al. (2017), since our model
does not predict non-argument-bearing predicates.

compared to an ensemble model (He et al., 2017)
that has a higher overall F1. This is very likely
due to architectural differences; in a BIO tagger,
predicate information passes through many LSTM
timesteps before reaching a long-distance argu-
ment, whereas our architecture enables direct con-
nections between all predicates-arguments pairs.

Agreement with syntax As mentioned in He
et al. (2017), their BIO-based SRL system has
good agreement with gold syntactic span bound-
aries (94.3%) but falls short of previous syntax-
based systems (Punyakanok et al., 2004). By
directly modeling span information, our model
achieves comparable syntactic agreement (95.0%)
to Punyakanok et al. (2004) without explicitly
modeling syntax.

Global consistency On the other hand, our
model suffers from global consistency issues. For
example, on the CoNLL 2005 test set, our model
has lower complete-predicate accuracy (62.6%)
than the BIO systems (He et al., 2017; Tan et al.,
2018) (64.3%-66.4%). Table 3 shows its viola-

tions of global structural constraints5 compared to
previous systems. Our model made more con-
straint violations compared to previous systems.
For example, our model predicts duplicate core
arguments6 (shown in the U column in Table 3)
more often than previous work. This is due to the
fact that our model uses independent classifiers to
label each predicate-argument pair, making it diffi-
cult for them to implicitly track the decisions made
for several arguments with the same predicate.

The Ours+decode row in Table 3 shows SRL
performance after enforcing the U-constraint us-
ing dynamic programming (Täckström et al.,

test time is effective at eliminating all the core-role
inconsistencies (shown in the U-column), but did
not bring significant gain on the end result (shown

predicate-argument structures.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We proposed a new SRL model that is able to
jointly predict all predicates and argument spans,
generalized from a recent coreference system (Lee
et al., 2017). Compared to previous BIO systems,
our new model supports joint predicate identifi-
cation and is able to incorporate span-level fea-
tures. Empirically, the model does better at long-
range dependencies and agreement with syntactic
boundaries, but is weaker at global consistency,
due to our strong independence assumption.

In the future, we could incorporate higher-order
inference methods (Lee et al., 2018) to relax this
assumption. It would also be interesting to com-
bine our span-based architecture with the self-
attention layers (Tan et al., 2018; Strubell et al.,
2018) for more effective contextualization.
