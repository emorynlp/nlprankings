Abstract

Statistical machine translation (SMT) per-
formance suffers when models are trained
on only small amounts of parallel data.
The learned models typically have both
low accuracy (incorrect translations and
feature scores) and low coverage (high
out-of-vocabulary rates). In this work, we
use an additional data resource, compa-
rable corpora, to improve both. Begin-
ning with a small bitext and correspond-
ing phrase-based SMT model, we improve
coverage by using bilingual lexicon induc-
tion techniques to learn new translations
from comparable corpora. Then, we sup-
plement the model’s feature space with
translation scores estimated over compa-
rable corpora in order to improve accu-
racy. We observe improvements between
0.5 and 1.7 BLEU translating Tamil, Tel-
ugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Hindi, and Urdu
into English.

1 Introduction

Standard statistical machine translation (SMT)
models (Koehn et al., 2003) are trained using
large, sentence-aligned parallel corpora. Unfortu-
nately, parallel corpora are not always available in
large enough quantities to train robust models (Ko-
lachina et al., 2012). In this work, we consider the
situation in which we have access to only a small
amount of bitext for a given low resource language
pair, and we wish to supplement an SMT model
with additional translations and features estimated
using comparable corpora in the source and tar-
get languages. Assuming access to a small amount

of parallel text is realistic, especially considering
the recent success of crowdsourcing translations
(Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Ambati, 2011;
Post et al., 2012).

We frame the shortcomings of SMT models
trained on limited amounts of parallel text1 in
terms of accuracy and coverage. In this con-
text, coverage refers to the number of words and
phrases that a model has any knowledge of at all,
and it is low when the training text is small, which
results in a high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate.
Accuracy refers to the correctness of the transla-
tion pairs and their corresponding probability fea-
tures that make up the translation model. Because
the quality of unsupervised automatic word align-
ments correlates with the amount of available par-
allel text and alignment errors result in errors in
extracted translation pairs, accuracy tends to be
low in low resource settings. Additionally, esti-
mating translation probabilities2 over sparse train-
ing sets results in inaccurate feature scores.

Given these deficiencies, we begin with a base-
line SMT model learned from a small parallel cor-
pus and supplement the model to improve its ac-
curacy and coverage. We apply techniques pre-
sented in prior work that use comparable corpora
to estimate similarities between word and phrases.
In particular, we build on prior work in bilingual
lexicon induction in order to predict translations
for OOV words, improving coverage. We then use
the same corpora to estimate additional translation
feature scores, improving model accuracy. We see
improvements in translation quality between 0.5

1We consider low resource settings to be those with par-
allel datasets of fewer than 1 million words. Most standard
MT datasets contain tens or hundreds of millions of words.

leads to model inaccuracies; we do not tackle that here.

and 1.7 BLEU points translating the following low
resource languages into English: Tamil, Telugu,
Bengali, Malayalam, Hindi, and Urdu.

2 Previous Work

Prior work shows that a variety of signals, in-
cluding distributional, temporal, topic, and string
similarity, may inform bilingual lexicon induc-
tion (Rapp, 1995; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp,
1999; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Koehn and
Knight, 2002; Monz and Dorr, 2005; Huang
et al., 2005; Schafer, 2006; Klementiev and
Roth, 2006; Haghighi et al., 2008; Mimno et al.,
2009; Mausam et al., 2010). Other work has
used decipherment techniques to learn translations
from monolingual and comparable data (Ravi and
Knight, 2011; Dou and Knight, 2012; Nuhn et al.,
2012). Daumé and Jagarlamudi (2011) use con-
textual and string similarity to mine translations
for OOV words in a high resource language do-
main adaptation for a machine translation setting.
Unlike most other prior work on bilingual lexicon
induction, Daumé and Jagarlamudi (2011) use the
translations in end-to-end SMT.

More recently, Irvine and Callison-Burch
(2013) combine a variety of the techniques for
estimating word pair similarity using source and
target language comparable corpora. That work
shows that only a small amount of supervision is
needed to learn how to effectively combine simi-
larity features into a single model for doing bilin-
gual lexicon induction. In this work, because we
assume access to a small amount of bilingual data,
it is natural to take such a supervised approach to
inducing new translations, and we directly apply
that of Irvine and Callison-Burch (2013).

Klementiev et al. (2012) use comparable cor-
pora to score an existing Spanish-English phrase
table extracted from the Europarl corpus. In this
work, we directly apply their technique for scor-
ing an existing phrase table. However, unlike that
work, our initial phrase tables are estimated from
small parallel corpora for genuine low resource
languages. Additionally, we include new transla-
tions discovered in comparable corpora.

Other prior work has mined supplemental paral-
lel data from comparable corpora (Munteanu and
Marcu, 2006; AbduI-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009;
Smith et al., 2010; Uszkoreit et al., 2010; Smith et
al., 2013). Such efforts are orthogonal and com-
plementary to the approach that we take.

3 Using Comparable Corpora to
Improve Accuracy and Coverage

After describing our bilingual and comparable cor-
pora, we briefly describe the techniques proposed
by Irvine and Callison-Burch (2013) and Klemen-
tiev et al. (2012). The contribution of this paper
is the application and combination of these tech-
niques in truly low resource translation conditions.

3.1 Datasets

Post et al. (2012) used Mechanical Turk to col-
lect small parallel corpora for the following Indian
languages and English: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali,
Malayalam, Hindi, and Urdu. They collected both
parallel sentence pairs and a dictionary of word
translations.3 We use all six datasets, which pro-
vide real low resource data conditions for six truly
low resource language pairs. Table 1 shows statis-
tics about the datasets.

Table 2 lists the amount of comparable data
that we use for each language. Following both
Klementiev et al. (2012) and Irvine and Callison-
Burch (2013), we use time-stamped web crawls
as well as interlingually linked Wikipedia docu-
ments. We use the time-stamped data to estimate
temporal similarity and the interlingual Wikipedia
links, which indicate documents about the same
topic written in different languages, to estimate

topic similarity. We use both datasets in combina-
tion with a dictionary derived from the small par-
allel corpora to estimate contextual similarity.

3.2 Improving Coverage

In order to improve the coverage of our low re-
source translation models, we use bilingual lexi-
con induction techniques to learn translations for
words which appear in our test sets but not in our
training data (OOVs). Bilingual lexicon induction
is the task of inducing pairs of words that are trans-
lations of one another from monolingual or com-
parable corpora. Irvine and Callison-Burch (2013)
use a diverse set of features estimated over compa-
rable corpora and a small set of known translations
as supervision for training a discriminative classi-
fier, which makes predictions (translation or not a
translation) on test set words paired with all pos-
sible translations. Possible translations are taken
from the set of all target words appearing in the
comparable corpora. Candidates are ranked ac-
cording to their classification scores. They achieve
very good performance on the induction task itself
compared with an unsupervised baseline that ag-
gregates the same similarity features uniformly. In
our setting, we have access to a small parallel cor-
pus, which makes such a supervised approach to
bilingual lexicon induction a natural choice.

We use the framework described in Irvine and
Callison-Burch (2013) directly, and further details
may be found there. In particular, we use the same
feature set, which includes the temporal, contex-
tual, topic, orthographic, and frequency similarity
between a candidate translation pair. We derive
translations to serve as positive supervision from
our automatically aligned parallel text4 and, like
the prior work, use random word pairs as nega-
tive supervision. Figure 1 shows some examples
of Bengali words, their correct translations, and
the top-3 translations that this framework induces.

In our initial experiments, we add the high-
est ranked English candidate translation for each
source language OOV to our phrase tables. Be-
cause all of the OOVs appear at least once in our
comparable corpora,5 we are able to mine transla-
tions for all of them. Adding these translations by
definition improves the coverage of our MT mod-
els. Then, in additional sets of experiments, we

also induce translations for source language words
which are low frequency in the training data and
supplement our SMT models with top-k transla-
tions, not just the highest ranked.

3.3 Improving Accuracy

In order to improve the accuracy of our mod-
els, we use comparable corpora to estimate ad-
ditional features over the translation pairs in our
phrase tables and include those features in tuning
and decoding. This approach follows that of Kle-
mentiev et al. (2012). We compute both phrasal
features and lexically smoothed features (using
word alignments, like the Moses lexical transla-
tion probabilities) for all of the following except
orthographic similarity, for which we only use lex-
ically smoothed features,6 resulting in nine addi-
tional features: temporal similarity based on time-
stamped web crawls, contextual similarity based
on web crawls and Wikipedia (separately), ortho-
graphic similarity using normalized edit distance,
and topic similarity based on inter-lingually linked
Wikipedia pages. Our hope is that by adding a di-
verse set of similarity features to the phrase tables,
our models will better distinguish between good
and bad translation pairs, improving accuracy.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental setup

We use the data splits given by Post et al. (2012)
and, following that work, include the dictionaries
in the training data and report results on the devtest
set using case-insensitive BLEU and four refer-
ences. We use the Moses phrase-based MT frame-
work (Koehn et al., 2007). For each language, we
extract a phrase table with a phrase limit of seven.
In order to make our results comparable to those
of Post et al. (2012), we follow that work and use

6Because the words within a phrase pair are often re-
ordered, phrase-level orthographic similarity is unreliable.

the English side of the training data to train a lan-
guage model. Using a language model trained on
a larger corpus (e.g. the English side of our com-
parable corpora) may yield better results, but such
an improvement is orthogonal to the focus of this
work. Throughout our experiments, we use the
batch version of MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012)
for tuning the feature set.7 We rerun tuning for
all experimental conditions and report results av-
eraged over three tuning runs (Clark et al., 2011).

Our baseline uses the bilingually extracted
phrase pairs and standard translation probability
features. We supplement it with the top ranked
translation for each OOV to improve coverage (+
OOV Trans) and with additional features to im-
prove accuracy (+Features). In Section 4.2, we
make each modification separately and then to-
gether. Then we present additional experiments
where we induce translations for low frequency
words, in addition to OOVs (4.3), append top-k
translations (4.4), vary the amount of training data
used to induce the baseline model (4.5), and vary
the amount of comparable corpora used to esti-
mate features and induce translations (4.6).

4.2 Results

Before presenting end-to-end MT results, we ex-
amine the performance of the supervised bilingual
lexicon induction technique that we use for trans-
lating OOVs. In Table 3, top-1 accuracy is the per-
cent of source language words in a held out portion
of the training data8 for which the highest ranked
English candidate is a correct translation.9 Perfor-
mance is lowest for Tamil and highest for Hindi.
For all languages, top-10 accuracy is much higher
than the top-1 accuracy. In Section 4.4, we explore

7We experimented with MERT and PRO as well but saw
consistently better baseline performance using batch MIRA.

8Described in Section 3.2. We retrain with all training
data for MT experiments.

9Post et al. (2012) gathered up to six translations for each
source word, so some have multiple correct translations

appending the top-k translations for OOV words to
our model instead of just the top-1.

Table 4 shows our results adding OOV transla-
tions, adding features, and then both. Additional
translation features alone, which improve our
models’ accuracy, increase BLEU scores between
0.18 (Bengali) and 0.60 (Malayalam) points.

Adding OOV translations makes a big differ-
ence for some languages, such as Bengali and
Urdu, and almost no difference for others, like
Malayalam and Tamil. The OOV rate (Table 1) is
low in the Malayalam dataset and high in the Tamil
dataset. However, as Table 3 shows, the translation
induction accuracy is low for both. Since few of
the supplemental translations are correct, we don’t
observe BLEU gains. In contrast, induction ac-
curacies for the other languages are higher, OOV
rates are substantial, and we do observe moderate
BLEU improvements by supplementing phrase ta-
bles with OOV translations.

In order to compute the potential BLEU gains
that we could realize by correctly translating all
OOV words (achieving 100% accuracy in Table
3), we perform an oracle experiment. We use au-
tomatic word alignments over the test sets to iden-
tify correct translations and append those to the
phrase tables.10 The results, in Table 4, show pos-
sible gains between 4.3 (Telugu and Bengali) and
0 (Malayalam) BLEU points above the baseline.
Not surprisingly, the possible gain for Malayalam,
which has a very low OOV rate, is very low. Our
+OOV Trans. model gains between 0% (Tamil)
and 38% (Urdu) of the potential improvement.

Using comparable corpora to improve both ac-
curacy (+Features) and coverage (+OOV Trans.)
results in translations that are better than apply-
ing either technique alone for five of the six lan-
guages. BLEU gains range from 0.48 (Bengali)
to 1.39 (Urdu). We attribute the particularly good
Urdu performance to the relatively large compa-
rable corpora (Table 2). As a result, we have al-
ready begun to expand our web crawls for all lan-
guages. In Section 4.6, we present results varying
the amount of Urdu-English comparable corpora
used to induce translations and estimate additional
features.

Table 4 also shows the Hiero (Chiang, 2005)
and SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) re-
sults that Post et al. (2012) report for the same

10Because the automatic word alignments are noisy, this
oracle is conservative.

datasets. Both syntax-based models outperform
the phrase-based MT baseline for each language
except Urdu, where the phrase-based model out-
performs Hiero. Here, we extend a phrase-based
rather than a syntax-based system because it is
simpler. However, our improvements may also ap-
ply to syntactic models (future work). Because our
efforts have focused on the accuracy and cover-
age of translation pairs and have not addressed re-
ordering or syntax, we expect that combining them
with an SAMT grammar will result in state-of-the
art performance.

4.3 Translations of Low Frequency Words

Given the positive results in Section 4.2, we hy-
pothesize that mining translations for low fre-
quency words, in addition to OOV words, may im-
prove accuracy. For source words which only ap-
pear a few times in the parallel training text, the
bilingually extracted translations in the standard
phrase table are likely to be inaccurate. There-
fore, we perform additional experiments varying
the minimum source word training data frequency
for which we induce additional translations. That
is, if freq(wsrc) ≤ M , we induce a new transla-
tion for it and include that translation in our phrase
table. Note that in the results presented in Table 4,
M = 0. In these experiments, we include our ad-
ditional phrase table features estimated over com-
parable corpora and hope that these scores will as-
sist the model in choosing among multiple trans-
lation options for low frequency words, one or
more of which is extracted bilingually and one of
which is induced using comparable corpora. Table
5 shows the results when we vary M . As before,
we average BLEU scores over three tuning runs.

In general, modest BLEU score gains are made
as we supplement our phrase-based models with
induced translations of low frequency words. The
highest performance is achieved when M is be-
tween 5 and 50, depending on language. The

& Trans model).

largest gains are 0.5 and 0.3 BLEU points for Ben-
gali and Urdu, respectively, at M = 25. This
is not surprising; we also saw the largest rela-
tive gains for those two languages when we added
OOV translations to our baseline model. With the
addition of low frequency translations, our highest
performing Urdu model achieves a BLEU score
that is 1.7 points higher than the baseline.

In different data conditions, inducing transla-
tions for low frequency words may result in better
or worse performance. For example, the size of the
training set impacts the quality of automatic word
alignments, which in turn impacts the reliability
of translations of low frequency words. However,
the experiments detailed here suggest that includ-
ing induced translations of low frequency words
will not hurt performance and may improve it.

4.4 Appending Top-K Translations
So far we have only added the top-1 induced trans-
lation for OOV and low frequency source words to
our phrase-based model. However, the bilingual
lexicon induction results in Table 3 show that ac-
curacies in the top-10 ranked translations are, on
average, nearly twice the top-1 accuracies. Here,
we explore adding the top-k induced translations.
We hope that our additional phrase table features
estimated over comparable corpora will enable the

decoder to correctly choose between the k trans-
lation options. We induce translations for OOV
words only (M = 0) and include all comparable
corpora features.

Table 6 shows performance as we append the
top-k ranked translations for each OOV word and
vary k. With the exception of Bengali, using a
k greater than 1 does not increase performance.
In the case of Bengali, and additional 0.2 BLEU
is observed when the top-25 translations are ap-
pended. In contrast, we see performance decrease
substantially for other languages (0.7 BLEU for
Telugu and 0.2 for Urdu) when the top-25 trans-
lations are used. Therefore, we conclude that, in
general, the models do not sufficiently distinguish
good from bad translations when we append more
than just the top-1. Although using a k greater than
1 means that more correct translations are in the
phrase table, it also increases the number of possi-
ble outputs over which the decoder must search.

4.5 Learning Curves over Parallel Data

In the experiments above, we only evaluated our
methods for improving the accuracy and coverage
of models trained on small amounts of bitext us-
ing the full parallel training corpora released by
Post et al. (2012). Here, we apply the same tech-
niques but vary the amount of parallel data in order
to generate learning curves. Figure 2 shows learn-
ing cures for all six languages. In all cases, results
are averaged over three tuning runs. We sample
both parallel sentences and dictionary entries.

All six learning curves show similar trends. In
all experimental conditions, BLEU performance
increases approximately linearly with the log of
the amount of training data. Additionally, supple-
menting the baseline with OOV translations im-
proves performance more than supplementing the
baseline with additional phrase table scores based

on comparable corpora. However, in most cases,
supplementing the baseline with both translations
and features improves performance more than ei-
ther alone. Performance gains are greatest when
very little training data is used. The Urdu learning
curve shows the most gains as well as the clean-
est trends across training data amounts. As before,
we attribute this to the relatively large comparable
corpora available for Urdu.

4.6 Learning Curves over Comparable
Corpora

In our final experiment, we consider the effect of
the amount of comparable corpora that we use
to estimate features and induce translations. We
present learning curves for Urdu-English because
we have the largest amount of comparable corpora
for that pair. We use the full amount of paral-
lel data to train a baseline model, and then we
randomly sample varying amounts of our Urdu-
English comparable corpora. Sampling is done
separately for the web crawl and Wikipedia com-
parable corpora. Figure 3 shows the results. As
before, results are averaged over three tuning runs.

The phrase table features estimated over com-
parable corpora improve end-to-end MT perfor-
mance more with increasing amounts of compa-
rable corpora. In contrast, the amount of com-
parable corpora used to induce OOV translations
does not impact the performance of the resulting
MT system as much. The difference may be due

Figure 2: Comparison of learning curves over lines of parallel training data for four SMT systems: our
baseline phrase-based model (baseline), model that supplements the baseline with translations of OOV
words induced using our supervised bilingual lexicon induction framework (+Trans), model that supple-
ments the baseline with additional phrase table features estimated over comparable corpora (+Feats), and
a system that supplements the baseline with both OOV translations and additional features (+Trans &
Feats).

to the fact that data sparsity is always more of an
issue when estimating features over phrase pairs
than when estimating features over word pairs be-
cause phrases appear less frequently than words
in monolingual corpora. Our comparable cor-
pora features are estimated over phrase pairs while
translations are only induced for OOV words, not
phrases. So, it makes sense that the former would
benefit more from larger comparable corpora.

5 Conclusion

As Post et al. (2012) showed, it is reasonable
to assume a small parallel corpus for training an
SMT model even in a low resource setting. We
have used comparable corpora to improve the ac-
curacy and coverage of phrase-based MT models
built using small bilingual corpora for six low re-
source languages. We have shown that our meth-
ods improve BLEU score performance indepen-
dently and that their combined impact is nearly ad-
ditive. Additionally, our results show that adding
induced translations of low frequency words im-
proves performance beyond what is achieved by
inducing translations for OOVs alone. Finally, our
results show that our techniques improve relative
performance most when very little parallel train-
ing data is available.
