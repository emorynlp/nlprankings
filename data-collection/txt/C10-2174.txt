Abstract 

The field of information retrieval still 

strives to develop models which allow 

semantic information to be integrated in 

the ranking process to improve perform-

ance in comparison to standard bag-of-

words based models. A conceptual 

model has been adopted in general-

purpose retrieval which can comprise a 

range of concepts, including linguistic 

terms, latent concepts and explicit 

knowledge concepts. One of the draw-

backs of this model is that the computa-

tional cost is significant and often in-

tractable in modern test collections. 

Therefore, approaches utilising concept-

based models for re-ranking initial re-

trieval results have attracted a consider-

able amount of study. This method en-

joys the benefits of reduced document 

corpora for semantic space construction 

and improved ranking results. However, 

fitting such a model to a smaller collec-

tion is less meaningful than fitting it into 

the whole corpus. This paper proposes a 

dual-space model which incorporates 

external knowledge to enhance the space 

produced by the latent concept method. 

This model is intended to produce 

global consistency across the semantic 

space: similar entries are likely to have 

the same re-ranking scores with respect 

to the latent and manifest concepts. To 

illustrate the effectiveness of the pro-

posed method, experiments were con-

ducted using test collections across dif-

ferent languages. The results demon-

strate that the method can comfortably 

achieve improvements in retrieval per-

formance. 

1 Introduction 

Information retrieval often suffers from the so 

called “vocabulary mismatch” problem. A 

document may be semantically relevant to a 

query despite the fact that the specific query 

terms used and the terms found in the document 

completely or partially differ (Furnas et al., 

1987). Consequently, overlap with respect to 

linguistic terms should not be a necessary con-

dition in query-document similarity and meth-

ods relying on the bag-of-words model can dis-

play poor performance as a result. In order to 

overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem, 

several solutions have been suggested which 

exploit semantic relations between text units. 

Among these methods, the latent model, the 

explicit model and the mixed model are com-

monly employed.  

The latent model (Landauer et al., 1998; Blei 

et al., 2003) tries to directly model the internal 

structure of “topics” or “concepts” in the text 

data, thus building meaningful groups beyond 

single words. Typically some form of dimen-

sion reduction (Fodor, 2002) is applied to the 

data matrix to find such latent dimensions 

which correspond to concepts. In contrast, the 

explicit model (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 

2007) indexes texts according to an external 

knowledge base. Typically the meaning of a 

piece of text is represented as a weighted vector 

of knowledge-based concepts derived from ex-

1524



ternal resources such as ODP

 or Wikipedia

articles. The mixed model (Serban et al., 2005) 

extends the bag-of-words vector by adding ex-

ternal categories derived from WordNet or simi-

lar thesaurus. Based upon these definitions, the 

explicit model and the mixed model are similar 

in nature but differ in their use of external 

knowledge sources.  

Models such as those described above, how-

ever, have well documented drawbacks. Firstly, 

these methods are very computationally com-

plex. In the latent model, complexity grows 

linearly with the number of dimensions and the 

number of documents. For example, the compu-

tational cost of singular value decomposition 

(SVD) is significant; no successful experiment 

has been reported with over one million docu-

ments (Manning et al., 2008). This has been the 

biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption of 

this kind of method. For the explicit and mixed 

model, the dimensions of projecting documents 

into the external knowledge space are often lim-

ited to ten thousand (Potthast et al., 2008) in 

order to facilitate the large size of the test col-

lections used. Another problem with the explicit 

model is that the documents are often distrib-

uted over thousands of dimensions in which the 

semantic relatedness will degrade dramatically. 

For example, in (Sorg and Cimiano, 2008) when 

the whole Wikipedia collection is adopted to 

build the space, one document is mapped to ten 

thousand dimensions, in which it may only have 

very few truly semantically related dimensions. 

The means of identifying these dimensions is 

not reported and this may significantly influence 

the retrieval performance.  

Therefore, researchers started to consider in-

tegrating the aforementioned models into 

smaller, controlled document collections to 

overcome these shortcomings and assist the re-

trieval process. (Zhou and Wade, 2009b) pro-

posed a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-

based method to model the latent structure of 

“topics” deduced from the initial retrieval re-

sults. The scores obtained from this process are 

then combined with initial ranking scores to 

produce a re-ranked list of results that are supe-

rior to original ordering.  The method also en-

joys the benefits of fast and tractable latent se-

mantic computation and successfully avoids the 

incremental build problem (Landauer et al., 

1998) which commonly exists in latent semantic 

analysis (LSA) techniques.  

There is an important factor, however, that 

needs to be taken into account when applying 

this method. Due to the smaller corpus size, fit-

ting a latent model into this corpus is less mean-

ingful than fitting the same model into a large, 

web-scale corpus. This means that some form of 

justification has to be applied to achieve better 

performance. A simple approach to address this 

problem is to directly apply the explicit or 

mixed model into a controlled corpus to im-

prove ranking performance. A similar problem 

will arise in the latent model in this single se-

mantic space, resulting in limited improvements.  

To address the challenges described above, 

this paper proposes a dual-space model which 

incorporates external knowledge to enhance the 

semantic space produced by the latent concept 

method. This model is intended to produce 

global consistency across the semantic space: 

similar entries are likely to have the same re-

ranking scores with respect to the latent and 

manifest concepts. In other words: in this model, 

if a group of documents deal with the same 

topic induced from a dual semantic space which 

shares a strong similarity with a query, the 

documents will get allocated similar ranking as 

they are more likely to be relevant to the query. 

In the experiments carried out in this paper, 

the dual-space model is applied to ad-hoc 

document retrieval and compared with the ini-

tial language model-based ranker and single-

space model exploiting latent and explicit fea-

tures. The results show that the explicit model 

could only bring minor improvements over the 

initial ranker. The latent model delivered more 

significant improvements than the explicit 

model. Both, however, are outperformed by the 

dual-space model.  

The main contribution of this paper is to pro-

pose a dual-space semantic model for the re-

ranking problem, which aims to improve preci-

sion, especially of the most highly ranked re-

sults. Other contributions of the paper include 

proposing a novel way of applying the explicit 

model to the re-ranking problem, and perform-

ing a systematic comparison between different 

models.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. 

Related work on re-ranking and concept-based 

methods is briefly summarised in Section 2. 

Section 3 describes the latent space model and 

explicit space model used in the framework de-

veloped by this research, Section 4 presents de-

tails of how to build the dual-space model. In 

Section 5 a report is provided on a series of ex-

periments performed over three different test 

collections written in English, French and Ger-

man. This report includes details of the results 

obtained. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper 

and speculates on future work. 

2 Related Work 

There exist several strands of related work in 

the areas of re-ranking and concept-based 

document retrieval. 

A family of work on the structural re-ranking 

paradigm over different sized document corpora 

was proposed to refine initial ranking scores. 

Kurland and Lee performed re-ranking based on 

measures of centrality in the graph formed by 

the generation of links induced by language 

model scores, through a weighted version of the 

PageRank algorithm (Kurland and Lee, 2005) 

and a HITS-style cluster-based approach 

(Kurland and Lee, 2006). Zhang et al. (Zhang et 

al., 2005) proposed a similar method to improve 

web search based on a linear combination of 

results from text search and authority ranking. 

The graph, which they named an “affinity 

graph”, shares strong similarities with Kurland 

and Lee’s work where the links are induced by a 

modified version of cosine similarity using the 

vector space model. Diaz (Diaz, 2005) used 

score regularisation to adjust document retrieval 

rankings from an initial retrieval by a semi-

supervised learning method. Deng et al. (Deng 

et al., 2009) further developed this method by 

building a latent space graph based on content 

and explicit link information. Unlike their ap-

proach this research attempts to model the ex-

plicit information directly.  

The latent concept retrieval model has a long 

history in information retrieval. (Dumais, 1993; 

Dumais, 1995) conducted experiments with la-

tent semantic indexing (LSI) on TREC
3
 docu-

ments and tasks. These experiments achieved

precision at, or above, that of the median TREC 

participant. On about 20% of TREC topics this 

system was the top scorer, and reportedly 

slightly better than average results in compari-

son to standard vector spaces for LSI at about 

350 dimensions. (Hofmann, 1999) provides an 

initial probabilistic extension of the basic latent 

semantic indexing technique. A more satisfac-

tory formal basis for a probabilistic latent vari-

able model for dimensionality reduction is the 

LDA model (Blei et al., 2003), which is genera-

tive and assigns probabilities to documents out-

side of the training set. Wei and Croft (Wei and 

Croft, 2006) presented the first large-scale 

evaluation of LDA, finding it to significantly 

outperform the query likelihood model. (Zhou 

and Wade, 2009b; Zhou and Wade, 2009a) suc-

cessfully applied this method to document re-

ranking and achieved significant improvement 

over language model-based ranking and various 

graph-based re-ranking methods.  

The explicit concept model has recently at-

tracted much attention in the information re-

trieval community. Notably, explicit semantic 

analysis (ESA) has been proposed as an ap-

proach to computing semantic relatedness be-

tween words and thus, has a natural application 

in this field (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007). 

In essence, ESA indexes documents with re-

spect to the Wikipedia article space, indicating 

how strongly a given word in the document is 

associated to a specific Wikipedia article. In this 

model, each article is regarded as a concept, an 

analogical unit used in the latent model. As in 

the latent model, two words or texts can be se-

mantically related in spite of not having any 

words in common. Specifically, this method has 

been widely adopted in cross-language informa-

tion retrieval (CLIR) as an approach to resolv-

ing  an extreme case of the vocabulary mis-

match problem, where queries and documents 

are written in different languages (Potthast et al., 

2008). (Anderka et al., 2009) showed that this 

approach has comparable performance to lin-

guistic matching methods. (Cimiano et al., 2009) 

compared this method with a latent concept 

model based on LSI/LDA and concluded that it 

will outperform the latent model if trained on 

Wikipedia articles.

3 Latent and Explicit Models 

In this section, an overview of the problem ad-

dressed by this paper is presented and the latent 

and explicit document re-ranking models are 

described in more detail. This section also dem-

onstrates how these models can be used in a re-

ranking setting. 

3.1 Problem Definition 

Let 𝔻 = {𝑑1 ,𝑑2 , … , 𝑑𝑛}  denote the set of 
documents to be retrieved. Given a query 𝑞, a 
set of initial results 𝔻𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 ∈ 𝔻 of top documents 
are returned by a standard information retrieval 

model (initial ranker). However, typically the 

performance of the initial ranker can be im-

proved upon. The purpose of the re-ranking 

method developed by this research is to re-order 

a set of documents  𝔻𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡
′  so as to improve re-

trieval accuracy at the most highly ranked re-

sults.  

3.2 Latent Concept Model 

The specific method used here is borrowed from 

(Zhou and Wade, 2009b), which is based on the 

LDA model. The topic mixture is drawn from a 

conjugate Dirichlet prior that remains the same 

for all documents. The process of generating a 

document corpus is as follows: 

1) Pick a multinomial distribution 𝜑  𝑧  for each 
topic 𝑘  from a Dirichlet distribution with 

hyperparameter 𝛽 . 
2) For each document 𝑑 , pick a multinomial 

distribution 𝜃 𝑑 , from a Dirichlet distribution 
with hyperparameter 𝛼 . 

3) For each word token 𝑤 in document 𝑑, pick 
a topic 𝑧 ∈ {1…𝑘}  from the multinomial 

distribution 𝜃 𝑑 . 
4) Pick word 𝑤 from the multinomial distribu-

tion 𝜑  𝑧 . 
    LDA possesses fully consistent generative 

semantics by treating the topic mixture distribu-

tion as a 𝑘-parameter hidden random variable.  
LDA offers a new and interesting framework to 

model a set of documents. The documents and 

new text sequences (for example, queries) can 

easily be connected by “mapping” them to the 

topics in the corpus.  

    In a re-ranking setting, the probability that a 

document 𝑑  generates 𝑤  is estimated using a 
mixture model LDA. It uses a convex combina-

tion of a set of component distributions to 

model observations. In this model, a word  𝑤 is 
generated from a convex combination of some 

hidden topics 𝑧: 

𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑑 𝑤 =  𝑝 𝑤 𝑧 𝑝(𝑧|𝑑)

𝑘

𝑧=1

 

where each mixture model 𝑝(𝑤|𝑧)  is a multi-
nomial distribution over terms that correspond 

to one of the latent topics 𝑧. This could be gen-
erated to give a distribution on a sequence of 

text: 

𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑑(𝑤1𝑤2 …𝑤𝑛) ≝  𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑑(𝑤𝑗 )

𝑛

𝑗=1

 

    Then the distance between a query and a 

document based on this model can be obtained. 

The method used here adopts the KL divergence 

(Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) between 

the query terms and document terms to compute 

a Re-Rank score 𝑅𝑆𝐿𝐷𝐴
𝐾𝐿 : 

𝑅𝑆𝐿𝐷𝐴
𝐾𝐿 = −𝐷(𝑀𝐿𝐸𝑞(∙)||𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑑 ∙ ) 

    The final score is then obtained through a 

linear combination of the re-ranking scores 

based on the initial ranker and the latent docu-

ment re-ranker, shown as follows: 

𝑅𝑆𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐿𝐷𝐴 = 𝜆 ∙ 𝑂𝑆 + (1 − 𝜆) ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐿𝐷𝐴

𝐾𝐿  

where 𝑂𝑆  denotes original scores returned by 
the initial ranker and 𝜆 is a parameter that can 
be tuned with 𝜆 = 1 meaning no re-ranking is 
performed.  

Another well-known approach to the latent 

model is the LSI method. It is based on SVD, a 

technique from linear algebra. This method has 

not been reported anywhere previously for re-

ranking purposes. It has been included here to 

compare the effectiveness of different latent 

approaches. As a full SVD is a loss-free decom-

position of a matrix 𝑀, which is decomposed 
into two orthogonal matrices 𝑈 and 𝑉 and a di-
agonal matrix Σ. Estimating less singular values 
and their corresponding singular vectors leads to 

reduced dimensions resembling latent concepts 

so that documents are no longer represented by 

terms but by concepts. New documents (que-

ries) are represented in terms of concepts by 

folding them into the LSI model. Next, cosine 

similarities may be used to compute the similar-

ity between a query and a document to obtain 

𝑅𝑆𝐿𝑆𝐼
𝐶𝑂𝑆  and combine it with the original score to 

produce the final re-ranking score: 

1527



𝑅𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐿𝑆𝐼 = 𝜆′ ∙ 𝑂𝑆 + (1 − 𝜆′) ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐿𝑆𝐼

𝐶𝑂𝑆  

3.3 Explicit Concept Model 

As an example of explicit concept model 

(Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), explicit 

semantic analysis attempts to index or classify a 

given text 𝑡 with respect to a set of explicitly 
given external categories. The basic idea is to 

take as input a document 𝑑 and map it to a high-
dimensional, real-valued vector space. This 

space is spanned by a Wikipedia database 

𝑊𝑙 = {𝑎1 ,… , 𝑎𝑛}.This mapping is given by the 
following function: 

Φ𝑙 : 𝑇 → ℝ
|𝑊𝑙| 

Φ𝑙 𝑡 ≔  𝑣1 ,… , 𝑣|𝑊𝑙|  

Where |𝑊𝑙 |  is the number of articles in 
Wikipedia 𝑊𝑙  corresponding to language 𝑙. The 
value 𝑣𝑖  in the vector 𝑡 expresses the strength of 
association between 𝑡 and the Wikipedia article 
𝑎𝑖  and is defined as the cosine similarity: 

𝑅𝑆𝐸𝑆𝐴
𝐶𝑂𝑆 =

 𝑡, 𝑎𝑖 

∥ 𝑡 ∥∥ 𝑎𝑖 ∥
 

As pointed out in section 1, documents are 

often distributed over thousands of dimensions 

in which the semantic relatedness will degrade 

dramatically. The main purpose is to find the 

most relevant dimensions with respect to que-

ries. To apply this method to re-ranking, 𝑊𝑙  is 
limited to the number of highly relevant docu-

ments for a given query. In other words, the en-

tire set of Wikipedia articles in language 𝑙  is 
retrieved, and only return a specific number of 

documents as in 𝑊𝑙 . This modification will also 
lead to fast computation of scores compared to 

scanning through the whole Wikipedia collec-

tion.  

 Similar to the latent model described above, 

the final ranking score is defined as: 

𝑅𝑆𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡
𝐸𝑆𝐴 = 𝜇 ∙ 𝑂𝑆 + (1 − 𝜇) ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐸𝑆𝐴

𝐶𝑂𝑆  

4 Dual space model 

Armed with the latent and explicit models, the 

dual-space model proposed by this paper is now 

described. In order to make a direct connection 

between the two models, the key point is to 

make the dimensions comparable across differ-

ent models. The detail presented on the latent 

and explicit concept models in the previous sec-

tion did not describe how to define a specific 

number of dimensions. A simple assumption is 

taken here in the dual-space model: the number 

of dimensions produced by the explicit model 

has to correspond to the number of dimensions 

induced by the latent model. As the same group 

of documents are being mapped into two differ-

ent semantic spaces, it is assumed that the con-

cepts induced by the latent model reflect the 

hidden structures in this document collection. 

Therefore, the same phenomenon should be ob-

served when applying the explicit model and 

vice-versa. Based on this assumption, the dual-

space model could be conducted so as to make a 

constraint: 

 𝑊𝑙 = 𝑘 
and the final ranking score for this dual 

space is: 

𝑅𝑆𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙
𝐿𝐷𝐴 = 𝜍 ∙ 𝑂𝑆 +  1 − 𝜍− 𝜏 ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐿𝐷𝐴

𝐾𝐿

+ 𝜏 ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐸𝑆𝐴
𝐶𝑂𝑆

 
or 

𝑅𝑆𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙
𝐿𝑆𝐼 = 𝜍 ∙ 𝑂𝑆 +  1 − 𝜍− 𝜏 ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐿𝑆𝐼

𝐶𝑂𝑆

+ 𝜏 ∙ 𝑅𝑆𝐸𝑆𝐴
𝐶𝑂𝑆

 

4 Experiments and Results 

In this section, an empirical study of the effec-

tiveness of the dual-space model over three data 

collections written in English, French and Ger-

4.1 Experimental Setup 

The text corpus used in the experiment de-

scribed below consisted of elements of the 

CLEF-2008
4
 and CLEF-2009 European Library 

(TEL) collections
5
 written in English, French 

and German. These collections are described in 

greater detail in Table 1. All of the documents 

in the experiment were indexed using the Ter-

rier toolkit
6
. Prior to indexing, Porter's stemmer 

and a stopword list
7
 were used for the English 

documents. A French and German analyser
8
 is 

used to analyse French and German documents.  

   It is worth noting that the CLEF TEL data is 

actually multilingual: all collections to a greater 

or lesser extent contain records pointing to 

documents in other languages. However this is 

not a major problem because the majority of 

documents in the test collection are written in 

the primary language of those test collections 

(BL-English, BNF-French, ONB-German). 

Please refer to (Ferro and Peters, 2009) for a 

more detailed discussion about this data. These 

collections were chosen to test the scalability of 

the proposed method in different settings and 

over different languages.  

   The CLEF-2008 and CLEF-2009 query sets 

were also used. Both query sets consist of 50 

topics in each language being tested. The 

CLEF-2008 queries written in English were 

used in training the parameters and all of the 

CLEF-2009 queries were used in the experiment 

for testing purposes. Each topic is composed of 

several parts, including: Title, Description and 

Narrative. Title+Description combinations 

were chosen as queries. The queries are proc-

essed similarly to the treatment of the test col-

lections. The relevance judgments are taken 

from the judged pool of top retrieved documents 

by various participating retrieval systems from 

previous CLEF workshops. The initial ranker 

used in this study is the classic vector space 

model. This was selected to facilitate the LSI 

and ESA models used and the main purpose of 

the experiments is to compare different models

in addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of 

the dual-space model. 

A Wikipedia database in English, French and 

German was used as an explicit concept space. 

Only those articles that are connected via cross-

language links between all three Wikipedia da-

tabases were selected. A snapshot was obtained 

on the 29/11/2009, which contained an aligned 

collection of 220,086 articles in all three lan-

guages. 

The following evaluation metrics were cho-

sen to measure the effectiveness of the various 

approaches: mean average precision (MAP), the 

precision of the top 5 documents (Prec@5), the 

precision of the top 10 documents (Prec@10), 

normalised discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) 

and Bpref. Statistically-significant differences 

in performance were determined using a paired 

t-test at a confidence level of 95%. 

4.2 Parameter Tuning 

Three primary categories of parameter combina-

tions need to be determined in the experiments. 

For the latent re-ranking experiments, the pa-

rameters 𝜆, 𝜆′  must be defined. For the explicit 
model the parameter 𝜇 must be chosen. For both 
models, the weights 𝜍, 𝜏 have to be determined. 
In addition, the number of dimensions |𝑊𝑙 | and 
𝑘 must be specified. Settings for these parame-
ters were optimised with respect to MAP over 

the BL collection using CLEF-2008 English 

queries and were applied to all three collections. 

This optimisation was not conducted for the 

other metrics used. 

    The search ranges for these two parameters 

were: 

𝜆, 𝜆′ ,𝜇, 𝜍, 𝜏:     0.1, 0.2, …, 0.9 
  𝑊𝑙  , 𝑘:     5, 10, 15, …, 40 

Note that parameters 𝜍 and 𝜏 are the weights 
assigned to the latent model and the explicit 

model in the dual-space model. The choice of 

one will have direct influence over another. As 

it turned out, for many instances, the optimal 

value of 𝜆, 𝜆′  with respect to MAP was either 
0.3 or 0.4, suggesting the initial retrieval scores 

still contain valuable information. In contrast, 

parameter 𝜇 shows no obvious difference in per-
formance when the value is above 0.1. With this 

observation, when setting the parameters 𝜍 and 
𝜏 more weight is assigned to the latent model 
rather than the explicit model. The optimal

value of 𝑘 was between 25 and 35 for the LDA 
based model and between 5 and 15 for the LSI 

based model. Although this demonstrates a rela-

tively large variance, the differences in terms of 

MAP have remained small and statistically in-

significant. 𝔻𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡  is set to 50 in all results re-
ported. 

4.3 Results 

Primary Evaluation The main experimental 

results, which describe the performance of the 

different re-ranking algorithms on the CLEF 

document collection, are shown in Table 2. The 

first four rows in each test collection specify the 

most important measurements because this re-

search is particularly interested in performance 

over the most highly ranked results. As illus-

1530



trated by the data, the initial ranker was always 

the lowest performer in terms of nearly all 

measurements. This indicates the need for re-

ranking. Using the method computed by the 

explicit space always led to an improvement in 

retrieval effectiveness. But this improvement is 

only minor in comparison to the other two mod-

els and the results are often statistically insig-

nificant. When the re-ranking score was calcu-

lated using the latent model, retrieval effective-

ness always exceeded initial ranker and the ex-

plicit model. There was a noticeable improve-

ment in retrieval effectiveness in the English 

collection (BL, statistically significant results 

were often observed), but a modest increase for 

the other two collections (BNF and ONB). 

The empirical results obtained using the dual 

space model are very promising. Pleasingly, 

both the LDA+ESA and LSI+ESA models out-

performed the basic latent and explicit space 

model in the majority of retrieval runs, with the 

best scores relating to the LSI-based models. An 

important phenomenon is that statistically sig-

nificant improvements are always recorded in 

the metrics which measure the most highly 

ranked results. An even more exciting observa-

tion is that in many cases, the dual-space model, 

even though tuned for MAP, can outperform 

various baselines and other models for all the 

evaluation metrics, with statistically significant 

improvements in many runs. 

Another observation that can be drawn from 

Table 2 is that the relative performance tends to 

be stable across test collections written in dif-

ferent languages. This indicates a promising 

future for studying document structure with re-

spect to latent and explicit semantic space for 

re-ranking purposes.   

 

The Comparison of Latent Methods  Table 2 

also shows a side-by-side comparison of the 

various performance measurements between the 

latent model used in this research on the CLEF-

2009 BL test collection. The LSI-based method 

appeared to outscore the LDA-based method in 

the latent model in the vast majority of cases, 

while the difference between the various scor-

ings was fairly marginal as both methods de-

liver statistically significant results. For the 

dual-space model, similar results were ob-

served. A possible reason is that the initial 

ranker used was based on the vector space 

model and LSI is also vector based. It shows 

that more research with respect to the latent 

model selection will be necessary in the future.  

 

Effectiveness of Explicit Methods As part of 

experimental objectives of this research, it was 

also necessary to test the newly developed ex-

plicit model for re-ranking. In the parameter 

tuning section, the explicit model displayed no 

obvious difference in terms of combination ef-

fectiveness. However, some variations could be 

observed when applying different dimensions 

where statistically significant results often ap-

pear in lower dimensions. This confirms the 

need to find more relevant dimensions, both for 

performance and efficiency purposes. 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 

This paper proposed and evaluated a dual-space 

document re-ranking method for re-ordering the 

initial retrieval results. The key to refining the 

results is the global consistency over the seman-

tic space, which leverages latent and explicit 

semantic information and results in state-of-art 

performance. This paper also proposed a novel 

way to apply the explicit model to the re-

ranking problem, and performed a systematic 

comparison between different models. 

Further investigation is planned in many re-

search directions. It has been shown that the 

latent model-based retrieval is a promising 

method for ranking the whole corpus. There is a 

desire to call for a direct comparison between 

ranking and re-ranking using the proposed algo-

rithmic variations. Future work will also include 

identifying improvements upon linear combina-

tion for engineering different models. At the 

same time, there exist a sufficient number of 

latent and explicit semantic techniques which 

will be explored to compare their performance.
