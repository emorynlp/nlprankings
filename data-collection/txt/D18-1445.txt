Abstract

We propose a method to perform automatic
document summarisation without using refer-
ence summaries. Instead, our method inter-
actively learns from users’ preferences. The
merit of preference-based interactive sum-
marisation is that preferences are easier for
users to provide than reference summaries.
Existing preference-based interactive learning
methods suffer from high sample complex-
ity, i.e. they need to interact with the ora-
cle for many rounds in order to converge.
In this work, we propose a new objective
function, which enables us to leverage ac-
tive learning, preference learning and rein-
forcement learning techniques in order to re-
duce the sample complexity. Both simula-
tion and real-user experiments suggest that
our method significantly advances the state
of the art. Our source code is freely avail-
able at https://github.com/UKPLab/

1 Introduction

With the rapid growth of text-based information
on the Internet, automatic document summarisa-
tion attracts increasing research attention from the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) community
(Nenkova and McKeown, 2012). Most existing
document summarisation techniques require ac-
cess to reference summaries to train their systems.
However, obtaining reference summaries is very
expensive: Lin (2004) reported that 3,000 hours
of human effort were required for a simple evalu-
ation of the summaries for the Document Under-
standing Conferences (DUC). Although previous
work has proposed heuristics-based methods to
summarise without reference summaries (Ryang
and Abekawa, 2012; Rioux et al., 2014), the gap
between their performance and the upper bound is
still large: the ROUGE-2 upper bound of .212 on

DUC’04 (P.V.S. and Meyer, 2017) is, for example,
twice as high as Rioux et al.’s (2014) .114.

The Structured Prediction from Partial Infor-
mation (SPPI) framework has been proposed to
learn to make structured predictions without ac-
cess to gold standard data (Sokolov et al., 2016b).
SPPI is an interactive NLP paradigm: It inter-
acts with a user for multiple rounds and learns
from the user’s feedback. SPPI can learn from
two forms of feedback: point-based feedback, i.e.
a numeric score for the presented prediction, or
preference-based feedback, i.e. a preference over
a pair of predictions. Providing preference-based
feedback yields a lower cognitive burden for hu-
mans than providing ratings or categorical labels
(Thurstone, 1927; Kendall, 1948; Kingsley and
Brown, 2010; Zopf, 2018). Preference-based SPPI
has been applied to multiple NLP applications, in-
cluding text classification, chunking and machine
translation (Sokolov et al., 2016a; Kreutzer et al.,
2017). However, SPPI has prohibitively high sam-
ple complexities in the aforementioned NLP tasks,
as it needs at least hundreds of thousands rounds of
interaction to make near-optimal predictions, even
with simulated “perfect” users. Figure 1a illus-
trates the workflow of the preference-based SPPI.

To reduce the sample complexity, in this work,
we propose a novel preference-based interactive
learning framework, called APRIL (Active Prefer-
ence ReInforcement Learning). APRIL goes be-
yond SPPI by proposing a new objective func-
tion, which divides the preference-based interac-
tive learning problem into two phases (illustrated
in Figure 1b): an Active Preference Learning
(APL) phase (the right cycle in Figure 1b), and
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase (the left cy-
cle). We show that this separation enables us to
query preferences more effectively and to use the
collected preferences more efficiently, so as to re-
duce the sample complexity.

We apply APRIL to Extractive Multi-Document
Summarisation (EMDS). The task of EMDS is to
extract sentences from the original documents to
build a summary under a length constraint. We
accommodate multiple APL and RL techniques
in APRIL and compare their performance under
different simulation settings. We also compare
APRIL to a state-of-the-art SPPI implementation
using both automatic metrics and human evalua-
tion. Our results suggest that APRIL significantly
outperforms SPPI.

2 Related Work

RL has been previously used to perform EMDS
without using reference summaries. Ryang and
Abekawa (2012) formulated EMDS as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), designed a heuristics-
based reward function considering both informa-
tion coverage rate and redundancy level, and used
the Temporal Difference (TD) algorithm (Sutton,
1984) to solve the MDP. In a follow-up work, Ri-
oux et al. (2014) proposed a different reward func-
tion, which also did not require reference sum-
maries; their experiments suggested that using
their new reward function improved the summary
quality. Henß et al. (2015) proposed a different
RL formulation of EMDS and jointly used super-
vised learning and RL to perform the task. How-
ever, their method requires the access to reference
summaries. More recent works applied encoder-
decoder-based RL to document summarisation
(Ranzato et al., 2015; Narayan et al., 2018; Paulus
et al., 2017; Pasunuru and Bansal, 2018). These
works outperformed standard encoder-decoder as

RL can directly optimise the ROUGE scores and
can tackle the exposure bias problems. However,
these neural RL methods all used ROUGE scores
as their rewards, which in turn relied on reference
summaries. APRIL can accommodate these neu-
ral RL techniques in its RL phase by using a rank-
ing of summaries instead of the ROUGE scores as
rewards. We leave neural APRIL for future study.

P.V.S. and Meyer (2017) proposed a bigram-
based interactive EMDS framework. They asked
users to label important bigrams in candidate sum-
maries and used integer linear programming (ILP)
to extract sentences covering as many important
bigrams as possible. Their method requires no ac-
cess to reference summaries, but it requires con-
siderable human effort during the interaction: in
simulation experiments, their system needed to
collect up to 350 bigram annotations from a (simu-
lated) user. In addition, they did not consider noise
in users’ annotations but simulated perfect oracles.

Preference learning aims at obtaining the rank-
ing (i.e. total ordering) of objects from pairwise
preferences (Fürnkranz and Hüllermeier, 2010).
Simpson and Gurevych (2018) proposed to use an
improved Gaussian process preference learning
(Chu and Ghahramani, 2005) for learning to rank
arguments in terms of convincingness from crowd-
sourced annotations. However, such Bayesian
methods can hardly scale and suffer from high
computation time. Zopf (2018) recently proposed
to learn a sentence ranker from preferences. The
resulting ranker can be used to identify the impor-
tant sentences and thus to evaluate the quality of
the summaries. His study also suggests that pro-
viding sentence preferences takes less time than
writing reference summaries. APRIL not only
learns a ranking over summaries from pairwise
preferences, but also uses the ranking to “guide”
our RL agent to generate good summaries.

There is a recent trend in machine learning to
combine active learning, preference learning and
RL, for learning to perform complex tasks from
preferences (Wirth et al., 2017). The resulting al-
gorithm is termed Preference-based RL (PbRL),
and has been used in multiple applications, includ-
ing training robots (Wirth et al., 2016) and Atari-
playing agents (Christiano et al., 2017). SPPI and
APRIL can both be viewed as PbRL algorithms.
But unlike most PbRL methods that learn a utility
function of the predictions (in EMDS, predictions
are summaries) to guide the RL agent, APRIL



4122

is able to directly use a ranking of predictions
to guide the RL agent without making assump-
tions about the underlying structure of the utility
functions. This also enables APRIL to use non-
utility-based preference learning techniques (e.g.,
Maystre and Grossglauser, 2017).

3 Background

In this section, we recap necessary details of SPPI,
RL and preference learning, and adapt them to the
EMDS use case, laying the foundation for APRIL.

3.1 The SPPI Framework
Let X be the input space and let Y(x) be the set
of possible outputs for input x ∈ X . In EMDS,
x ∈ X is a cluster of documents and Y(x) is the
set of all possible summaries for cluster x. The
function ∆x : Y(x)×Y(x)→ {0, 1} is the prefer-
ence function such that ∆x(yi, yj) = 1 if the user
believes yj is better than yi (denoted by yj � yi or
equivalently yi ≺ yj), and 0 otherwise. Through-
out this paper we assume that users do not equally
prefer two different items. For a given x, the ex-
pected loss is:

LSPPI(w|x) = Epw(yi,yj |x)[∆x(yi, yj)]

=
∑

yi,yj∈Y(x)

∆x(yi, yj) pw(yi, yj |x), (1)

where pw(yi, yj |x) is the probability of querying
the pair (yi, yj). Formally,

pw(yi, yj |x)

=
exp[wᵀ(φ(yi|x)− φ(yj |x))]∑

yp,yq∈Y(x)
exp[wᵀ(φ(yp|x)− φ(yq|x))]

, (2)

where φ(y|x) is the vector representation of y
given x, and w is the weight vector to be learnt.
Eq. (2) is a Gibbs sampling strategy: wᵀ(φ(yi|x)−
φ(yj |x)) can be viewed as the “utility gap” be-
tween yi and yj . The sampling strategy pw en-
courages querying pairs with large utility gaps.

To minimise LSPPI, SPPI uses gradient descent
to update w incrementally. Alg. 1 presents the
pseudo code of our adaptation of SPPI to EMDS.
In the supplementary material, we provide a de-
tailed derivation of∇wLSPPI(w|x).

3.2 Reinforcement Learning
RL amounts to efficient algorithms for searching
optimal solutions in MDPs. MDPs are widely

Input : sequence of learning rates γt; query
budget T ; document cluster x

initialise w0;
while t = 0 . . . T do

sample (yi, yj) according to Eq. (2);

end

teractive document summarisation (adjusted

used to formulate sequential decision making
problems, which EMDS falls into: in EMDS, the
summariser has to sequentially select sentences
from the original documents and add them to the
draft summary. An (episodic) MDP is a tuple
(S,A, P,R, T ). S is the set of states, A is the set
of actions, P : S × A × S → R is the transition
function with P (s′|s, a) yielding the probability of
performing action a in state s and being transited
to a new state s′. R : S × A → R is the reward
function withR(s, a) giving the immediate reward
for performing action a in state s. T ⊆ S is the set
of terminal states; visiting a terminal state termi-
nates the current episode.

In EMDS, we follow the same MDP formu-
lation as Ryang and Abekawa (2012) and Rioux
et al. (2014). Given a document cluster, a state s
is a draft summary, A includes two types of ac-
tions, concatenate a new sentence to the current
draft summary, or terminate the draft summary
construction. The transition function P in EMDS
is trivial because given the current draft summary
and an action, the next state can be easily inferred.
The reward function R returns an evaluation score
of the summary once the action terminate is per-
formed; otherwise it returns 0 because the sum-
mary is still under construction and thus not ready
to be evaluated. Providing non-zero rewards be-
fore the action terminate can lead to even worse
result, as reported by Rioux et al. (2014).

A policy π : S × A → R in an MDP defines
how actions are selected: π(s, a) is the probability
of selecting action a in state s. In EMDS, a policy
corresponds to a strategy to build summaries for a
given document cluster. We let Yπ(x) be the set of
all possible summaries the policy π can construct
in the document cluster x, and we slightly abuse
the notation by letting π(y|x) denote the probabil-



4123

ity of policy π generating a summary y in cluster
x. Then the expected reward of a policy is:

RRL(π|x) = Ey∈Yπ(x)R(y|x)

=
∑

y∈Yπ(x)

π(y|x)R(y|x), (3)

where R(y|x) is the reward for summary y in doc-
ument cluster x. The goal of an MDP is to find the
optimal policy π∗ that has the highest expected re-
ward: π∗ = arg maxπRRL(π).

Note that the loss function in SPPI (Eq. (1)) and
the expected reward function in RL (Eq. (3)) are in
similar forms: if we view the pair selection proba-
bility pw in Eq. (2) as a policy, and view the pref-
erence function ∆x in Eq. (1) as a negative reward
function, we can view SPPI as an RL problem.
The major difference between SPPI and RL is that
SPPI selects and evaluates pairs of outputs, while
RL selects and evaluates single outputs. We will
exploit their connection to propose our new objec-
tive function and the APRIL framework.

3.3 Preference Learning
The linear Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley
and Terry, 1952) is one of the most widely used
methods in preference learning. Given a set of
itemsY , suppose we have observed T preferences:
Q = {q1(y1,1, y1,2), · · · , qT (yT,1, yT,2)}, where
yi,1, yi,2 ∈ Y , and qi ∈ {≺,�} is the oracle’s
preference in the ith round. The BT model min-
imises the following cross-entropy loss:

LBT(w) = −
∑

qi(yi,1,yi,2)∈Q

[ µi,1 logPw(yi,1 � yi,2)

+ µi,2 logPw(yi,2 � yi,1) ], (4)

where Pw(yi � yj) = (1 + exp[wᵀ(φ(yj) −
φ(yi))])

−1, and µi,1 and µi,2 indicate the direc-
tion of preferences: if yi,1 � yi,2 then µi,1 = 1
and µi,2 = 0. Let w∗ = arg minw LBT(w),
then w∗ can be used to rank all items in Y: for
any yi, yj ∈ Y , the ranker prefers yi over yj if
w∗ᵀφ(yi) > w

∗ᵀφ(yj).

4 APRIL: Decomposing SPPI into Active
Preference Learning and RL

A major problem of SPPI is its high sample com-
plexity. We believe this is due to two reasons.
First, SPPI’s sampling strategy is inefficient: From
Eq. (2) we can see that SPPI tends to select pairs
with large quality gaps for querying the user. This

strategy can quickly identify the relatively good
and relatively bad summaries, but needs many
rounds of interaction to find the top summaries.
Second, SPPI uses the collected preferences inef-
fectively: In Alg. 1, each preference is used only
once for performing the gradient descent update
and is forgotten afterwards. SPPI does not gener-
alise or re-use collected preferences, wasting the
useful and expensive information.

These two weaknesses of SPPI motivate us to
propose a new learning paradigm that can query
and generalise preferences more efficiently. Re-
call that in EMDS, the goal is to find the optimal
summary for a given document cluster x, namely
the summary that is preferred over all other pos-
sible summaries in Y(x). Based on this under-
standing, we define a new expected reward func-
tionRAPRIL for policy π as follows:

RAPRIL(π|x)=Eyj∼π[
1

|Y(x)|
∑

yi∈Y(x)

∆x(yi, yj)]

=
1

|Y(x)|
∑

yj∈Yπ(x)

π(yj |x)
∑

yi∈Y(x)

∆x(yi, yj)

=
∑

y∈Yπ(x)

π(y|x) r(y|x), (5)

where r(y|x) =
∑

yi∈Y(x) ∆x(yi, yj)/|Y(x)|.
Note that ∆x(yi, yj) equals 1 if yj is preferred
over yi and equals 0 otherwise (see §3.1). Thus,
r(y|x) is the relative position of y in the (ascend-
ing) sorted Y(x), and it can be approximated by
preference learning. The use of preference learn-
ing enables us to generalise the observed prefer-
ences to a ranker (see §3.3), allowing more ef-
fective use of the collected preferences. Also, we
can use active learning to select summary pairs for
querying more effectively. In addition, the resem-
blance of RAPRIL and RL’s reward function RRL
(in Eq. (3)) enables us to use a wide range of RL
algorithms to maximiseRAPRIL (see §2).

Based on the new objective function, we split
the preference-based interactive learning into two
phases: an Active Preference Learning (APL)
phase (the right cycle in Fig. 1b), responsible for
querying preferences from the oracle and approxi-
mating the ranking of summaries, and an RL phase
(the left cycle in Fig. 1b), responsible for learning
to summarise based on the learned ranking. The
resulting framework APRIL allows for integrating
any active preference learning and RL techniques.
Note that only the APL phase is online (i.e. in-

/* Phase 1: active preference learning */
while t = 0 . . . T do

end
/* Phase 2: RL-based summarisation */

while n = 0 . . . N do

evaluate policy πn according to Eq. (5);
update policy πn using any RL algorithm;

end
Output: y∗ = arg maxy∈YπN (x) πN (y|x)

can be performed offline, helping to improve the
real-time responsiveness. Also, the learned ranker
can provide an unlimited number of rewards (i.e.
r(y|x) in Eq. (5)) to the RL agent, enabling us to
perform many episodes of RL training with a small
number of collected preferences – unlike in SPPI
where each collected preference is used to train the
system for one round and is forgotten afterwards.
Alg. 2 shows APRIL in pseudo code.

5 Experimental Setup

Datasets. We perform experiments on DUC ’04
to find the best performing APL and RL tech-
niques. Then we combine the best-performing
APL and RL to complete APRIL and compare
it against SPPI on the DUC ’01, DUC ’02 and
DUC ’04 datasets.1 Some statistics of these
datasets are summarised in Table 1.

Simulated Users. Existing preference-based in-
teractive learning techniques assume that the or-
acle has an intrinsic evaluation function U∗ and
provides preferences consistent with U∗ by prefer-
ring higher valued candidates. We term this a Per-

1http://duc.nist.gov/

fect Oracle (PO). We believe that assuming a PO
is unrealistic for real-world applications, because
sometimes real users tend to misjudge the prefer-
ence direction, especially when the presented can-
didates have similar quality. In this work, besides
PO, we additionally consider two types of noisy
oracles based on the user-response models pro-
posed by Viappiani and Boutilier (2010):

• Constant noisy oracle (CNO): with prob-
ability c ∈ [0, 1], this oracle randomly se-
lects which summary is preferred; otherwise
it provides preferences consistent with U∗.
We consider CNOs with c = 0.1 and c = 0.3.

• Logistic noisy oracle (LNO): for two sum-
maries yi and yj in cluster x, the or-
acle prefers yi over yj with probability
pU∗(yi � yj |x;m) = (1 + exp[(U∗(yj |x)−
U∗(yi|x))/m])−1. This oracle reflects the in-
tuition that users are more likely to misjudge
the preference direction when two summaries
have similar quality. Note that the parame-
ter m ∈ R+ controls the “noisiness” of the
user’s responses: higher values of m result
in a less steep sigmoid curve, and the result-
ing oracle is more likely to misjudge. We use
LNOs with m = 0.3 and m = 1.

As for the intrinsic evaluation function U∗, re-
cent work has suggested that human preferences
over summaries have high correlations to ROUGE
scores (Zopf, 2018). Therefore, we define:

U∗(y|x)=R1(y|x)
0.47

+
R2(y|x)

0.22
+
RS(y|x)

0.18
(6)

where R1, R2 and RS stand for ROUGE-1,
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4, respectively. The
real values (0.47, 0.22 and 0.18) are used to bal-
ance the weights of the three ROUGE scores. We
choose them to be around the EMDS upper-bound
ROUGE scores reported by P.V.S. and Meyer
(2017). As such, an optimal summary’s U∗ value
should be around 3.

Implementation. All code is written in Python
and runs on a desktop PC with 8 GB RAM and an
i7-2600 CPU. We use NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) to
perform sentence tokenisation. Our source code
is freely available at https://github.com/
UKPLab/emnlp2018-april.

6 Simulation Results

We first study the APL phase (§6.1) and the RL
phase (§6.2)) separately by comparing the perfor-



4125

mance of multiple APL and RL algorithms in each
phase. Then, in §6.3, we combine the best per-
forming APL and RL algorithm to complete Alg.
2 and compare APRIL against SPPI.

6.1 APL Phase Performance

Recall that the task of APL is to output a ranking
of all summaries in a cluster. In this subsection,
we test multiple APL techniques and compare the
quality of their resulting rankings. Two metrics are
used: Kendall’s τ (Kendall, 1948) and Spearman’s
ρ (Spearman, 1904). Both metrics are valued be-
tween −1 and 1, with higher values suggesting
higher rank correlation. Because the number of
possible summaries in a cluster is huge, instead of
evaluating the ranking quality on all possible sum-
maries, we evaluate rankings on 10,000 randomly
sampled summaries, denoted Ŷ(x). During query-
ing, all candidate summaries presented to the ora-
cle are also selected from Ŷ(x). Sampling Ŷ(x) a
priori helps us to reduce the response time to un-
der 500 ms for all APL techniques we test. We
compare four active learning strategies under two
query budgets, T = 10 and T = 100:

• Random Sampling (RND): Randomly se-
lect two summaries from Ŷ(x) to query.
• SPPI Sampling (SBT): Select summary

pairs from Ŷ(x) according to the SPPI strat-
egy in Eq. (2). After each round, the weight
vector w is updated according to Eq. (4).

• Uncertainty Sampling (Unc): Query the
most uncertain summary pairs. In line with
P.V.S. and Meyer (2017), the uncertainty of
a summary is evaluated as follows: first,
we estimate the probability of a summary
y being the optimal summary in cluster x
as popt(y|x) = (1 + exp(−w∗ᵀt φ(x, y)))−1,
where w∗t is the weights learned by the BT
model (see §3.3) in round t. Given popt(y|x),
we let the uncertainty score unc(y|x) = 1 −
popt(y|x) if popt(y|x) ≥ 0.5 and unc(y|x) =
popt(y|x) otherwise.
• J&N is the robust query selection algorithm

proposed by Jamieson and Nowak (2011). It
assumes that the items’ preferences are de-
pendent on their distances to an unknown ref-
erence point in the embedding space: the far-
ther an item to the reference point, the more
preferred the item is. After each round of
interaction, the algorithm uses all collected

preferences to locate the area where the ref-
erence point may fall into, and identify the
query pairs which can reduce the size of this
area, termed ambiguous query pairs. To com-
bat noise in preferences, the algorithm se-
lects the most-likely-correct ambiguous pair
to query the oracle in each round.

After all preferences are collected, we obtain
the ranker as follows: for any yi, yj ∈ Y(x), the
ranker prefers yi over yj if

αw∗ᵀφ(yi|x) + (1− α)HU(yi|x) >
αw∗ᵀφ(yj |x) + (1− α)HU(yj |x), (7)

where w∗ is the weights vector learned by the BT
model (see Eq. (4)), HU is the heuristics-based
summary evaluation function proposed by Ryang
and Abekawa (2012), and α ∈ [0, 1] is a param-
eter. The aim of using HU and α is to trade off
between the prior knowledge (i.e. heuristics-based
HU ) and the posterior observation (i.e. the BT-
learnt w∗), so as to combat the cold-start problem.
Based on some preliminary experiments, we set
α = 0.3 when the query budget is 10, and α = 0.7
when the query budget is 100. The intuition is to
put more weight to the posterior with increasing
rounds of interaction. More systematic research
of α can yield better results; we leave it for future
work. For the vector φ(y|x), we use the same bag-
of-bigram embeddings as Rioux et al. (2014), and
we let its length be 200.

In Table 2, we compare the performance of the
four APL methods on the DUC’04 dataset. The
baseline we compared against is the prior rank-
ing. We find that Unc significantly2 outperforms
all other APL methods, except when the oracle
is LNO-1, where the advantage of Unc to SBT
is not significant. Also, both Unc and SBT are
able to significantly outperform the baseline un-
der all settings. The competitive performance of
SBT, especially with LNO-1, is due to its unique
sampling strategy: LNO-1 is more likely to mis-
judge the preference direction when the presented
summaries have similar quality, but SBT has high
probability to present summaries with large qual-
ity gaps (see Eq. (2)), effectively reducing the
chance that LNOs misjudge preference directions.
However, SBT is more “conservative” compared
to Unc because it tends to exploit the existing

2In this paper we use double-tailed student t-test to com-
pute p-values, and we let significance level be p < 0.01.

ranking to select one good and one bad summary
to query, while Unc performs more exploration by
querying the summaries that are least confident ac-
cording to the current ranking. We believe this ex-
plains the strong overall performance of Unc.

Additional experiments suggest that when we
only use the posterior ranking (i.e. letting α = 1),
no APL we test can surpass the baseline when
T = 10. Detailed results are presented in the sup-
plementary material. This observation reflects the
severity of the cold-start problem, confirms the ef-
fectiveness of our prior-posterior trade-off mecha-
nism in combating cold-start, and indicates the im-
portance of tuning the α value (see Eq. (7)). This
opens up exciting avenues for future work.

6.2 RL Phase Performance
We compare two RL algorithms: TD(λ) (Sut-
ton, 1984) and LSTD(λ) (Boyan, 1999). TD(λ)
has been used in previous RL-based EMDS work
(Ryang and Abekawa, 2012; Rioux et al., 2014).
LSTD(λ) is chosen, because it is an improved TD
algorithm and has been used in the state-of-the-art
PbRL algorithm by Wirth et al. (2016). We let the
learning round (see Alg. 2) N = 5, 000, which we
found to yield good results in reasonable time (less
than 1 minute to generate a summary for one doc-
ument cluster). Letting N = 3, 000 will result in a
significant performance drop, while increasing N
to 10,000 will only bring marginal improvement
at the cost of doubling the runtime. The learn-

Table 3: Upper-bound performance comparison.

ing parameters we use for TD(λ) are the same as
those by Rioux et al. (2014). For LSTD(λ), we let
λ = 1 and initialise its square matrix as a diag-
onal matrix with random numbers between 0 and
1, as suggested by Lagoudakis and Parr (2003).
The rewards we use are theU∗ function introduced
in §5. Note that this serves as the upper-bound
performance, because U∗ relies on the reference
summaries (see Eq. (6)), which are not available
in the interactive setting. As a baseline, we also
present the upper-bound performance of integer
linear programming (ILP) reported by P.V.S. and
Meyer (2017), optimised for bigram coverage.

Table 3 shows the performance of RL and ILP
on the DUC’04 dataset. TD(λ) significantly out-
performs LSTD(λ) in terms of all ROUGE scores
we consider. Although the least-square RL algo-
rithms (which LSTD belongs to) have been proved
to achieve better performance than standard TD
methods in large-scale problems (see Lagoudakis
and Parr, 2003), their performance is sensitive to
many factors, e.g., initialisation values in the di-
agonal matrix, regularisation parameters, etc. We
note that a similar observation about the inferior
performance of least-square RL in EMDS is re-
ported by Rioux et al. (2014).

TD(λ) also significantly outperforms ILP in
terms of all metrics except ROUGE-2. This is not
surprising, because the bigram-based ILP is opti-
mised for ROUGE-2, whereas our reward function
U∗ considers other metrics as well (see Eq. (6)).
Since ILP is widely used as a strong baseline for
EMDS, these results confirm the advantage of us-
ing RL for EMDS problems.

6.3 Complete Pipeline Performance

Finally, we combine the best techniques of the
APL and RL phase (namely Unc and TD(λ), re-
spectively) to complete APRIL, and compare it
against SPPI. As a baseline, we use the heuristic-
based rewards HU to train both TD(λ) (ranking-
based training, i.e. using HU to produce r(y|x) in
Eq. (5) to train) and SPPI (preference-based train-
ing, i.e. using HU for generating pairs to train

SPPI) for up to 5,000 episodes. The baseline re-
sults are presented in the bottom rows of Table 4.

We make the following observations from Ta-
ble 4. (i) Given the same oracle, the performance
of APRIL with 10 rounds of interaction is com-
parable or even superior than that of SPPI after
100 rounds of interaction (see boldface in Table
4), suggesting the strong advantage of APRIL to
reduce sample complexity. (ii) APRIL can sig-
nificantly improve the baseline with either 10 or
100 rounds of interaction, but SPPI’s performance
can be even worse than the baseline (marked by †

in Table 4), especially under the high-noise low-
budget settings (i.e., CNO-0.3, LNO-0.3, and
LNO-1 with T = 10). This is because SPPI lacks
a mechanism to balance between prior and poste-
rior ranking, while APRIL can adjust this trade-off

by tuning α (Eq. (7)). This endows APRIL with
better noise robustness and lower sample com-
plexity in high-noise low-budget settings. Note
that the above observations also hold for the other
two datasets, indicating the consistently strong
performance of APRIL across different datasets.

As for the overall runtime, when budget T =
100, APRIL on average takes 2 minutes to interact
with an oracle and output a summary, while SPPI
takes around 15 minutes due to its expensive gra-
dient descent computation (see §3.1).

7 Human Evaluation

Finally, we invited real users to compare and eval-
uate the quality of the summaries generated by
SPPI and APRIL. We randomly selected three top-
ics (d19 from DUC’01, d117i from DUC’02 and
d30042 from DUC’04), and let both SPPI and our
best-performing APRIL interact with PO for 10
rounds on these topics. The resulting 100-word
summaries, shown in Figure 2, were presented to
seven users, who had already read two background
texts to familiarize with the topic. The users were
asked to provide their preference on the presented

20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted
the question ’Who ? ’ Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker

point Likert scale with higher scores for better
summaries. All users are fluent in English.

In all three topics, all users prefer the APRIL-
generated summaries over the SPPI-generated
summaries. Table 5 shows the users’ ratings. The
APRIL-generated summaries consistently receive
higher ratings. These results are consistent with
our simulation experiments and confirm the sig-
nificant advantage of APRIL over SPPI.

8 Conclusion
We propose a novel preference-based interactive
learning formulation named APRIL (Active Pref-
erence ReInforcement Learning), which is able to
make structured predictions without referring to
the gold standard data. Instead, APRIL learns
from preference-based feedback. We designed a
novel objective function for APRIL, which natu-
rally splits APRIL into an active preference learn-
ing (APL) phase and a reinforcement learning
(RL) phase, enabling us to leverage a wide spec-
trum of active learning, preference learning and
RL algorithms to maximise the output quality with
a limited number of interaction rounds. We ap-
plied APRIL to the Extractive Multi-Document
Summarisation (EMDS) problem, simulated the
users’ preference-giving behaviour using multiple
user-response models, and compared the perfor-
mance of multiple APL and RL techniques. Sim-
ulation experiments indicated that APRIL signif-

icantly improved the summary quality with just
10 rounds of interaction (even with high-noise
oracles), and significantly outperformed SPPI in
terms of both sample complexity and noise robust-
ness. Human evaluation results suggested that real
users preferred the APRIL-generated summaries
over the SPPI-generated ones.

We identify two major lines of future work. On
the technical side, we plan to employ more ad-
vanced APL and RL algorithms in APRIL, such as
sample-efficient Bayesian-based APL algorithms
(e.g., Simpson and Gurevych, 2018) and neural
RL algorithms (e.g. Mnih et al., 2015) to further
reduce the sample complexity of APRIL. On the
experimental side, a logical next step is to imple-
ment an interactive user interface for APRIL and
conduct a larger evaluation study comparing the
summary quality before and after the interaction.
We also plan to apply APRIL to more NLP appli-
cations, including machine translation, informa-
tion exploration and semantic parsing.
