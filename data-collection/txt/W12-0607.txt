Abstract

To what extend can one use Twitter in opin-
ion polls for political elections? Merely
counting Twitter messages mentioning po-
litical party names is no guarantee for ob-
taining good election predictions. By im-
proving the quality of the document col-
lection and by performing sentiment anal-
ysis, predictions based on entity counts in
tweets can be considerably improved, and
become nearly as good as traditionally ob-
tained opinion polls.

1 Introduction

Predicting the future is one of human’s great-
est desires. News companies are well aware of
this, and try to predict tomorrow’s weather and
changes on the stock markets. Another case in
point are the opinion polls, of which the news
is abundant in the period before political elec-
tions. Such polls are traditionally based on ask-
ing a (representative) sample of voters what they
would vote on the day of election.

The question we are interested in, is whether
opinion polls could be conducted on the basis
of the information collected by Twitter, a popu-
lar microblog website, used by millions to broad-
cast messages of no more than 140 characters,
known as tweets. Over the last two years, we have
collected a multi-billion-word corpus of Dutch

scribed in this paper can be retrieved from http://

tweets, with the general aim of developing nat-
ural language processing tools for automatically
analyzing the content of the messages in this new
social medium, which comes with its own chal-
lenges. When the Dutch Senate elections took
place in 2011, we took this as an opportunity to
verify the predictive power of tweets.

More concretely, we wanted to test whether by
simply counting Twitter messages mentioning po-
litical party names we could accurately predict the
election outcome. Secondly, we wanted to inves-
tigate factors that influence the predictions based
on the Dutch tweets.

In this paper we present the results of our exper-
iments. We first summarize related work in Sec-
tion 2. Then we outline our data collection pro-
cess (Section 3). The methods we used for pre-
dicting election results and the obtained results,
are presented in Sections 4, 5 and 6. We discuss
the results of the experiments in Section 7 and
conclude in Section 8.

2 Related work

Tumasjan et al. (2010) investigate how Twitter
is used in political discourse and check if polit-
ical sentiment on Twitter reflects real-life senti-
ments about parties and politicians. As a part of
their study, they compare party mentions on Twit-
ter with the results of the 2009 German parliament
election. They conclude that the relative number
of tweets mentioning a party is a good predictor
for the number of votes of that party in an elec-
tion. A similar finding was earlier reported by
Jean Véronis in a series of blogposts: the number

Figure 1: Overview of our collection of Dutch tweets of the year 2011. The data set contains almost 700 million
tweets. Both the number of tweets (about two million per day) and the number of unique users (about one
million) increase almost every month. The collection is estimated to contain about 37% of the total volume of
Dutch tweets.

of times a French presidential candidate was men-
tioned in the press was a good prediction for his or
her election results (Véronis, 2007). This predic-
tion task involved only two candidates, so it was
easier than predicting the outcome of a multiparty
election.

Jungherr et al. (2011) criticize the work of Tu-
masjan et al. (2010). They argue that the choice
of included parties in the evaluation was not well
motivated and show that the inclusion of a seventh
party, the Pirate Party, would have had a large neg-
ative effect on accuracy of the predictions. Fur-
thermore, Jungherr et al. question the time period
which was used by Tumasjan et al. for collecting
the tweets and show that including the tweets of
the week right before the election would also have
had a significant negative effect on the prediction
accuracy.

Using Twitter data for predicting election re-
sults was popular in 2010 and 2011. Chung
and Mustafaraj (2011) found that merely count-
ing tweets is not enough to obtain good predic-
tions and measure the effect of sentiment analysis
and spam filtering. O’Connor et al. (2010) dis-
covered that while volumes of mentions of obama
on Twitter before the US presidential election of
2008 correlated with high poll ratings for Barack
Obama, volumes of mentions of his rival mccain
also correlated with high poll ratings of the elec-
tion winner. Gayo-Avello et al. (2011) show that
predictions based on Twitter only predicted half
of the winners of US congressional elections with

two candidates correctly, a performance which is
not better than chance.

3 Data collection

We collect Dutch Twitter messages (tweets) with
the filter stream provided by Twitter. We continu-
ously search for messages that contain at least one
of a list of about a hundred high-frequent Dutch
words and a dozen frequent Dutch subject tags
(hashtags). The results of this process also con-
tain some false positives: tweets that contain ap-
parent Dutch words but are actually written in an-
other language. In order to get rid of these mes-
sages, we apply a language guesser developed by
Thomas Mangin (Mangin, 2007). It ranks lan-
guages by comparing character n-grams of an in-
put text to n-gram models of texts in known lan-
guages. We use a set of 74 language models de-
veloped by our students in 2007.

In order to estimate the coverage of our selec-
tion with respect to all tweets in Dutch, we col-
lected all tweets of one month from 1,017 ran-
domly selected users which predominantly post
messages in Dutch. We compared the two data
streams and found that the first contained 37% of
the data found in the second. This suggests that
we collect about 37% of all Dutch tweets. Our
data collection process contains two filters: one is
based on a word list and the other is the language
guesser. The first filter lost 62% of the data while
the second lost another 1%.

2011, converted to Senate seats (column Seats Twitter) and compared with the predictions of two polls from the
same week: from Politieke Barometer of 17 February (Synovate.nl, 2011b) and from Maurice de Hond of 15
February (Peil.nl, 2011b). The offset value is the sum of the differences between the Twitter predictions and the
average poll predictions. The OSF group is a cooperation of 11 local parties which were not tracked on Twitter.

4 Counting party names

The Dutch Senate elections are held once ev-
ery four years. The elections are preceded by
the Dutch Provincial Election in which the vot-
ers choose 566 representatives for the States-
Provincial. Three months later the new repre-
sentatives elect the new Senate. In the second
election, each of the representatives has a weight
which is proportional to the number of people
he or she represents. The 2011 Dutch provincial
elections were held on Wednesday 2 March 2011
and the corresponding Senate elections were held
on Monday 23 May 2011. In the Senate elections
75 seats are contested.

Our work on predicting the results of this elec-
tion was inspired by the work of Tumasjan et al.
(2010), who report that basic counts of tweets
mentioning a political party provided good pre-
dictions for the results of the 2009 German parlia-
ment election. We decided to replicate their work
for the Dutch Senate Elections of 2011.

We started with examining the Dutch tweets of
Wednesday 16 February 2011, two weeks prior
to the Provincial elections. This data set con-
sisted of 1.7 million tweets. From this data set

we extracted the tweets containing names of po-
litical parties. This resulted in 7,000 tweets. This
number was lower than we had expected. Origi-
nally we had planned to use the tweets for predict-
ing local election results. However, further filter-
ing of the tweets to require location information
would have left us with a total of about 70 polit-
ical tweets per day, far too few to make reliable
predictions for twelve different provinces.

In the data, we searched for two variants of
each party: the abbreviated version and the full
name, allowing for minor punctuation and capi-
talization variation. For nearly all parties, the ab-
breviated name was used more often on Twitter
than the full name. The two exceptions are Groen-
Links/GL and 50Plus/50+ (Table 1). Party names
could be identified with a precision close to 100%
except for the party ChristenUnie: its abbreviation
CU is also used as slang for see you. This was the
case for 11% of the tweets containing the phrase
CU. In this paper, the 11% of tweets have already
been removed from the counts of this party.

Apart from the eleven regular parties shown in
Table 1, there was a twelfth party with a chance
of winning a Senate seat: the Independent Senate
Group (OSF), a cooperation of 11 regional par-

55



ties. These parties occur infrequently in our Twit-
ter data (less than five times per party per day),
too infrequent to allow for a reliable base for pre-
dicting election results. Therefore we decided to
use a baseline prediction for them. We assumed
that the group would win exactly one Senate seat,
just like in the two previous elections.

We converted the counts of the party names on
Twitter to Senate seats by counting every tweet
mentioning a party name as a vote for that party.
The results can be found in the column Seats Twit-
ter in Table 1. The predicted number of seats
were compared with the results of two polls of the
same week: one by the polling company Politieke
Barometer of 17 February (Synovate.nl, 2011b)
and another from the company Peil.nl, commonly
referred to as Maurice de Hond, from 15 February
(Peil.nl, 2011b). The predicted numbers of seats
by Twitter were reasonably close to the numbers
of the polling companies. However, there is room
for improvement: for the party PVV, tweets pre-
dicted a total of 18 seats while the polling com-
panies only predicted 12 and for the party 50+,
Twitter predicted no seats while the average of the
polling companies was 1.5 seats.

5 Normalizing party counts

The differences between the Twitter prediction
and prediction of the polling companies could
have been caused by noise. However, the differ-
ences could also have resulted from differences
between the methods for computing the predic-
tions. First, in the polls, like in an election, every-
one has one vote. In the tweet data set this is not
the case. One person may have send out multiple
tweets or may have tweeted about different politi-
cal parties. This problem of the data is easy to fix:
we can keep only one political tweet per user in
the data set and remove all others.

A second problem is that not every message
containing a party name is necessarily positive
about the party. For example:

Wel triest van de vvd om de zondagen
nu te schrappen wat betreft het shop-
pen, jammer! Hierbij dus een #fail

Sadly, the VVD will ban shopping on
Sundays, too bad! So here is a #fail

Table 2: Senate seat predictions based on normalized
tweets: keeping only tweets mentioning one party,
keeping only the first tweet of each user and keeping of
each user only the first tweet which mentioned a single
party. The offset score is the seat difference between
the predictions and the average poll prediction of Ta-
ble 1.

While the tweet is mentioning a political party,
the sender does not agree with the policy of the
party and most likely will not vote for the party.
These tweets need to be removed as well.

A third problem with the data is that the demo-
graphics of Dutch Twitter users are probably quite
different from the demographics of Dutch voters.
Inspection of Dutch tweets revealed that Twitter is
very popular among Dutch teens but they are not
eligible to vote. User studies for other countries
have revealed that senior citizens are underrepre-
sented on the Internet (Fox, 2010) but this group
has a big turnout in elections (Epskamp and van
Rhee, 2010). It would be nice if we could as-
sign weights to tweets based on the representa-
tiveness of certain groups of users. Unfortunately
we cannot determine the age and gender of indi-
vidual Twitter users because users are not required
to specify this information in their profile.

Based on the previous analysis, we tested two
normalization steps for the tweet data. First, we
removed all tweets that mentioned more than one
party name. Next, we kept only the first tweet of
each user. Finally we combined both steps: keep-

56



ing of each user only the first tweet which men-
tioned a single political party. We converted all
the counts to party seats and compared them with
the poll outcomes. The results can be found in
Table 2. The seat predictions did not improve. In
fact, the offsets of the three methods proved to be
larger than the corresponding number of the base-
line approach without normalization (29, 25 and
22 compared to 21). Still, we believe that normal-
ization of the tweet counts is a good idea.

Next, we determined the sentiments of the
tweets. Since we do not have reliable automatic
sentiment analysis software for Dutch, we de-
cided to build a corpus of political tweets with
manual sentiment annotation. Each of the two au-
thors of this paper manually annotated 1,678 po-
litical tweets, assigning one of two classes to each
tweet: negative towards the party mentioned in
the tweet or nonnegative. The annotators agreed
on the sentiment of 1,333 tweets (kappa score:
0.59).

We used these 1,333 tweets with unanimous
class assignment for computing sentiment scores
per party. We removed the tweets that mentioned
more than one party and removed duplicate tweets
of users that contributed more than one tweet. 534
nonnegative tweets and 227 negative tweets were
left. Then we computed weights per party by di-
viding the number of nonnegative tweets per party
by the associated total number of tweets. For ex-
ample, there were 42 negative tweets for the VVD
party and 89 nonnegative, resulting in a weight of
89/(42+89) = 0.68. The resulting party weights
can be found in Table 3.

We multiplied the weights with the tweet
counts obtained after the two normalization steps
and converted these to Senate seats. As a result
the difference with the poll prediction dropped
from 25 to 23 (see Table 3). Incorporating sen-
timent analysis improved the results of the pre-
diction.

After sentiment analysis, the tweets still did not
predict the same number of seats as the polls for
any party. For nine parties, the difference was
two and a half seats or lower but the difference
was larger for two parties: GL (5) and PvdA (6).
A possible cause for these differences is a mis-
match between the demographics of Twitter users

and the Dutch population. We have no data de-
scribing this discrepancy. We wanted to build a
model for this difference so we chose to model the
difference by additional correction weights based
on the seats differences between the two predic-
tions. We based the expected number of seats on
the two poll results of the same time period as
the tweets (Synovate.nl, 2011b; Peil.nl, 2011b).
For example, after normalization, there were 811
tweets mentioning the PVV party. The party has a
sentiment weight of 0.49 so the adjusted number
of tweets is 0.49*811 = 397. The polls predicted
12 of 74 seats for this party. The associated pop-
ulation weight is equal to the average number of
poll seats divided by the total number of seats di-
vided by the adjusted number of tweets divided
by the total number of adjusted tweets (2,285):
(12/74)/(397/2285) is 0.93.

The population weights can be found in Table
4. They corrected most predicted seat numbers
of Twitter to the ones predicted by the polls. A
drawback of this approach is that we have tuned
the prediction system to the results of polls rather
than to the results of elections. It would have been

better to tune the system to the results of past elec-
tions but we do not have associated Twitter data
for these elections. Adjusting the results of the
system to get them as close to the poll predictions
as possible, is the best we can do at this moment.

6 Predicting election outcomes

The techniques described above were applied to
Dutch political tweets collected in the week be-
fore the election: 23 February 2011 – 1 March
2011: 64,395 tweets. We used a week of data
rather than a day because we expected that using
more data would lead to better predictions. We
chose for a week of tweets rather than a month
because we assumed that elections were not an
important discussion topic on Twitter one month
before they were held.

After the first two normalization steps, one
party per tweet and one tweet per user, 28,704
tweets were left. The parties were extracted from
the tweets, and counted, and the counts were mul-
tiplied with the sentiment and population weights
and converted to Senate seats. The results are
shown in Table 5 together with poll predictions

Table 5: Twitter seat prediction for the 2 March 2011
Dutch Senate elections compared with the actual re-
sults (Kiesraad.nl, 2012a) and the predictions of two
polling companies of 1 March 2011: PB: Politieke
Barometer (Synovate.nl, 2011a) and MdH: Maurice de
Hond (Peil.nl, 2011a).

(Synovate.nl, 2011a; Peil.nl, 2011a) and the re-
sults of the elections of 2 March 2011 (Kies-
raad.nl, 2012a).

The seat numbers predicted by the tweets were
close to the election results. Twitter predicted
the correct number of seats for the party PVV
while the polling companies predicted an in-
correct number. However the companies pre-
dicted other seat numbers correctly and they had
a smaller total error: 14 seats compared to 18 for
our approach.

In Dutch elections, there is no strict linear rela-
tion between the number of votes for a party and
the number seats awarded to a party. Seats that
remain after truncating seat numbers are awarded
to parties by a system which favors larger par-
ties (Kiesraad.nl, 2012b). Furthermore, in 2011
there was a voting incident in the Senate elections
which caused one party (D66) to loose one of its
seats to another party (SP). In our evaluation we
have compared seat numbers because that is the
only type of data that we have available from the
polling companies. The election results allow a
comparison based on percentages of votes. This
comparison is displayed in Table 6.

Dutch Provincial elections compared with the actual

With the exception of the three largest par-
ties, all predicted percentages are within 1.7%
of the numbers of the election. The percentages
might prove to be more reliable than seat num-
bers as a base for a election prediction method.
We hope to use percentage figures when the pre-
dicting the outcome of next parliament elections:
one of the polling companies publishes such fig-
ures with their predictions of parliament elections.

7 Discussion

Although we are happy about the accuracy ob-
tained by the Twitter predictions, we have some
concerns about the chosen approach. In Table 4,
we introduced poll-dependent weights to correct
the demographic differences between the Twitter
users and the Dutch electorate. This was neces-
sary because we did not have information about
the demographics of Twitter users, for example
about their gender and age. As already men-
tioned, this choice led to tuning the system to
predicting poll results rather than election results.
But do the population weights not also minimize
the effect that tweet counts have on the predic-
tions? Does the system still use the tweet counts

2CU and SGP were awarded an additional 0.3% and 0.2%
for the 0.5% they won as an alliance.

for the election prediction?

In order to answer the latter question, we de-
signed an additional experiment. Suppose the
tweets per party were uniformly distributed such
that each party name appeared in the same number
of tweets each day. This would make tweet counts
uninteresting for predicting elections. However,
how would our system deal with this situation?
The results of this experiment are shown in Ta-
ble 7.

Since we did not have data to base sentiment
weights on, we assumed that all the sentiment
weights had value 1.0. Since the tweet counts
were different from those in the earlier exper-
iments, we needed to compute new population
weights (see Table 7). The seat numbers predicted
by the system were equal to the average of the seat
numbers of the two polls in Table 4 plus or mi-
nus a half in case the two numbers added up to
an odd number. The VVD party gained one seat,
as a consequence of the system of awarding re-
mainder seats to larger parties. We assume that
the tweet distribution will be uniform at all times
and this means that the system will always predict
the seat distribution. The offset of the new predic-
tion was 3 seats for the test distribution of Table 4
and 8 seats for the election results (see Table 7), a

59



smaller error than either of the polling companies
(compare with Table 5).

This experiment has produced a system which
generates the average of the predictions of the
two polling companies from the week of 16/17
February as an election prediction. It does not re-
quire additional input. This is not a good method
for predicting election outcome but by chance it
generated a better prediction than our earlier ap-
proach and those of two polling companies. We
are not sure what conclusions to draw from this.
Is the method of using population weights flawed?
Is our evaluation method incorrect? Are tweets
bad predictors of political sentiment? Is the mar-
gin of chance error large? It would be good to test
whether the measured differences are statistically
significant but we do not know how to do that for
this data.

8 Concluding remarks

We have collected a large number of Dutch Twit-
ter messages (hundreds of millions) and showed
how they can be used for predicting the results of
the Dutch Senate elections of 2011. Counting the
tweets that mention political parties is not suffi-
cient to obtain good predictions. We tested the
effects of improving the quality of the data col-
lection by removing certain tweets: tweets men-
tioning more than one party name, multiple tweets
from a single user and tweets with a negative sen-
timent. Despite having no gold standard training
data, the total error of our final system was only
29% higher than that of two experienced polling
companies (Table 5). We hope to improve these
results in the future, building on the knowledge
we have obtained in this study.
