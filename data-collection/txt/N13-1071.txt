Abstract

A discourse typically involves numerous en-
tities, but few are mentioned more than once.
Distinguishing discourse entities that die out
after just one mention (singletons) from those
that lead longer lives (coreferent) would ben-
efit NLP applications such as coreference res-
olution, protagonist identification, topic mod-
eling, and discourse coherence. We build a lo-
gistic regression model for predicting the sin-
gleton/coreferent distinction, drawing on lin-
guistic insights about how discourse entity
lifespans are affected by syntactic and seman-
tic features. The model is effective in its own
right (78% accuracy), and incorporating it into
a state-of-the-art coreference resolution sys-
tem yields a significant improvement.

1 Introduction

Not all discourse entities are created equal. Some
lead long lives and appear in a variety of discourse
contexts (coreferent), whereas others never escape
their birthplaces, dying out after just one mention
(singletons). The ability to make this distinction
based on properties of the NPs used to identify these
referents (mentions) would benefit not only corefer-
ence resolution, but also topic analysis, textual en-
tailment, and discourse coherence.

The existing literature provides numerous gen-
eralizations relevant to answering the question of
whether a given discourse entity will be singleton
or coreferent. These involve the internal syntax and
morphology of the target NP (Prince, 1981a; Prince,
1981b; Wang et al., 2006), the grammatical function

and discourse role of that NP (Chafe, 1976; Hobbs,
1979; Walker et al., 1997; Beaver, 2004), and the in-
teraction of all of those features with semantic oper-
ators like negation, modals, and attitude predicates
(Karttunen, 1973; Karttunen, 1976; Kamp, 1981;
Heim, 1982; Heim, 1992; Roberts, 1990; Groe-
nendijk and Stokhof, 1991; Bittner, 2001).

The first step in our analysis is to bring these
insights together into a single logistic regression
model — the lifespan model — and assess their
predictive power on real data. We show that the
features generally behave as the existing literature
leads us to expect, and that the model itself is highly
effective at predicting whether a given mention is
singleton or coreferent. We then provide an initial
assessment of the engineering value of making the
singleton/coreferent distinction by incorporating our
lifespan model into the Stanford coreference resolu-
tion system (Lee et al., 2011). This addition results
in a significant improvement on the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task data, across the MUC, B3, CEAF, and
CoNLL scoring algorithms.

2 Data

All the data used throughout the paper come from
the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task (Pradhan et al.,
2012), which included the 1.6M English words from
OntoNotes v5.0 (Hovy et al., 2006) that have been
annotated with different layers of annotation (coref-
erence, parse trees, etc.). We used the training, de-
velopment (dev), and test splits as defined in the
shared task (Table 1). Since the OntoNotes corefer-
ence annotations do not contain singleton mentions,
we automatically marked as singletons all the NPs

3 Predicting lifespans

Our lifespan model makes a binary distinction be-
tween discourse referents that are not part of a coref-
erence chain (singletons) and items that are part of
one (coreferent). The distribution of lifespans in our
data (Figure 1) suggests that this is a natural divi-
sion. The propensity of singletons also highlights
the relevance of detecting singletons for a coref-
erence system. We fit a binary logistic regression
model in R (R Core Team, 2012) on the training
data, coding singletons as “0” and coreferent men-
tions as “1”. Throughout the following tables of co-
efficient estimates, positive values favor coreferents
and negative ones favor singletons. We turn now to
describing and motivating the features of this model.

Internal morphosyntax of the mention Table 2
summarizes the features from our model that con-
cern the internal morphology and syntactic structure
of the mention. Many are common in coreference
systems (Recasens and Hovy, 2009), but our model
highlights their influence on lifespans. The picture
is expected on the taxonomy of given and new de-
fined by Prince (1981b) and assumed throughout dy-
namic semantics (Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982): pro-
nouns depend on anaphoric connections to previous

mentions for disambiguation and thus are very likely
to be coreferent. This is corroborated by the pos-
itive coefficient estimate for ‘Type = pronoun’ in
Table 2. Few quantified phrases easily participate
in discourse anaphora (Partee, 1987; Wang et al.,
2006), accounting for the association between quan-
tifiers and singletons (negative coefficient estimate
for ‘Quantifier = quantified’ in Table 2). The one
surprise is the negative coefficient for indefinites. In
theories stretching back to Karttunen (1976), indef-
inites function primarily to establish new discourse
entities, and should be able to participate in coref-
erence chains, but here the association with such
chains is negative. However, interactions explain
this fact (see Table 4 and our discussion of it).

The person, number, and animacy values suggest
that singular animates are excellent coreferent NPs,
a previous finding of Centering Theory (Grosz et al.,
1995; Walker et al., 1998) and of cross-linguistic
work on obviative case-marking (Aissen, 1997).

Our model also includes named-entity features for
all of the eighteen OntoNotes entity-types (omitted
from Table 2 for space and clarity reasons). As a
rule, they behave like ‘Type = proper noun’ in asso-
ciating with coreferents. The exceptions are ORDI-
NAL, PERCENT, and QUANTITY, which seem intu-
itively unlikely to participate in coreference chains.

Grammatical role of the mention Synthesizing
much work in Centering Theory and information
structuring, we conclude that coreferent mentions
are likely to appear as core verbal arguments and
will favor sentence-initial (topic-tracking) positions
(Ward and Birner, 2004). The coefficient estimates

in Table 3 corroborate these conclusions. To de-
fine the ‘Relation’ and ‘In coordination’ features, we
used the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al.,
2006) on the gold constituents.

Semantic environment of the mention Table 4
highlights the complex interactions between dis-
course anaphora and semantic operators. These
interactions have been a focus of logical seman-
tics since Karttunen (1976), whose guiding obser-
vation is semantic: an indefinite interpreted inside
the scope of a negation, modal, or attitude predicate
is generally unavailable for anaphoric reference out-
side of the scope of that operator, as in Kim didn’t
understand [an exam question]i. #Iti was too hard.
Of course, such discourses cohere if the indefinite
is interpreted as taking wide scope (‘there is a ques-
tion Kim didn’t understand’). Such readings are of-
ten disfavored, but they become more salient when
modifiers like certain are included (Schwarzschild,
2002) or when the determiner is sensitive to the po-
larity or intensionality of its environment (Baker,
1970; Ladusaw, 1980; van der Wouden, 1997; Is-
rael, 1996; Israel, 2001; Giannakidou, 1999). Sub-
sequent research identified many other factors that
further extend or restrict the anaphoric potential of
an indefinite (Roberts, 1996).

We do not have direct access to semantic scope,
but we expect syntactic scope to correlate strongly
with semantic scope, so we used dependency rep-
resentations to define features capturing syntactic
scope for negation, modal auxiliaries, and a broad
range of attitude predicates. These features tend to
bias in favor of singletons because they so radically
restrict the possibilities for intersentential anaphora.

Interacting these features with those for the inter-
nal syntax of mentions is also informative. Since
proper names and pronouns are not scope-taking,
they are largely unaffected by the environment fea-
tures, whereas indefinites emerge as even more re-
stricted, just as Karttunen and others would predict.

Attitude predicates seem initially anomalous,
though. They share the relevant semantic proper-
ties with negation and modals, and yet they seem
to facilitate coreference. Here, the findings of de
Marneffe et al. (2012) seem informative. Those au-
thors find that, in texts of the sort we are studying,
attitude predicates are used predominantly to mark
the source of information that is effectively asserted
despite being embedded (Rooryck, 2001; Simons,
2007). That is, though X said p does not semanti-
cally entail p, it is often interpreted as a commitment
to p, which correspondingly elevates mentions in p
to main-clause status (Harris and Potts, 2009).

Results The model successfully learns to tease
singletons and coreferent mentions apart. Table 5
summarizes its performance on the dev set. The
STANDARD model uses 0.5 as the decision bound-
ary, with 78% accuracy. The CONFIDENT model
predicts singleton if Pr < .2 and coreferent if Pr > .8,
which increases precision (P) at a cost to recall (R).

4 Application to coreference resolution

To assess the usefulness of the lifespan model in an
NLP application, we incorporate it into the Stanford
coreference resolution system (Lee et al., 2011),
which we take as our baseline. This was the highest-
scoring system in the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task,
and was also part of the highest-scoring system in
the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task (Fernandes et al.,
2012). It is a rule-based system that includes a to-
tal of ten rules (or “sieves”) for entity coreference,
such as exact string match and pronominal resolu-
tion. The sieves are applied from highest to lowest
precision, each rule adding coreference links.

Incorporating the lifespan model The lifespan
model can improve coreference resolution in two
different ways: (i) mentions classified as singletons
should not be considered as either antecedents or
coreferent, and (ii) mentions classified as coreferent
should be linked with another mention(s). By suc-
cessfully predicting singletons (i), we can enhance
the system’s precision; by successfully predicting
coreferent mentions (ii), we can improve the sys-
tem’s recall. Here we focus on (i) and use the lifes-
pan model for detecting singletons. This decision
is motivated by two factors. First, given the large
number of singletons (Figure 1), we are more likely
to see a gain in performance from discarding sin-
gletons. Second, the multi-sieve nature of the Stan-
ford coreference system does not make it straightfor-
ward to decide which antecedent a mention should
be linked to even if we know that it is coreferent.

We leave the incorporation of coreferent predictions
for future work.

To integrate the singleton model into the Stanford
coreference system, we let a sieve consider whether
a pair of mentions is coreferent only if neither of
the two mentions are classified as singletons by our
CONFIDENT model. Experiments on the dev set
showed that the model often made wrong predic-
tions for NEs. We do not trust the model for NE
mentions. Performance on coreference (on the dev
set) was higher with the CONFIDENT model than
with the STANDARD model.

Results and discussion To evaluate the corefer-
ence system with and without the lifespan model, we
used the English dev and test sets from the CoNLL-
2012 Shared Task, presented in Section 2. Although
the CoNLL shared task evaluated systems on only
multi-mention (i.e., non-singleton) entities, by stop-
ping singletons from being linked to multi-mention
entities, we expected the lifespan model to increase
the system’s precision. Our evaluation uses five
of the measures given by the CoNLL-2012 scorer:
MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3 (Bagga and Baldwin,
1998), CEAF-φ3 and CEAF-φ4 (Luo, 2005), and the
CoNLL official score (Denis and Baldridge, 2009).
We do not include BLANC (Recasens and Hovy,
2011) because it assumes gold mentions and so is
not suited for the scenario considered in this paper,
which uses automatically predicted mentions.

Table 6 summarizes the test set performance. All
the scores are on automatically predicted mentions.
We use gold POS, parse trees, and NEs. The base-

630



line is the Stanford system, and ‘w/ Lifespan’ is the
same system extended with our lifespan model to
discard singletons, as explained above.

As expected, the lifespan model increases preci-
sion but decreases recall. Overall, however, we ob-
tain a significant improvement of 0.5–1 points in the
F1 score of MUC, CEAF-φ3, CEAF-φ4 and CoNLL.
The drop in B3 traces to a bug in the CoNLL scorer’s
implementation of Cai and Strube (2010)’s algo-
rithm for aligning gold and automatically predicted
mentions, which affects the computation of B3 and
CEAF-φ3.1 Table 7 presents the results after mod-
ifying the CoNLL-2012 scorer to compute B3 and
CEAF-φ3 according to Cai and Strube (2010).2 We
do see an improvement in the precision and F1
scores of B3, and the overall CoNLL score remains
significant. The CEAF-φ3 F1 score is no longer sig-
nificant, but is still in the expected direction.

5 Conclusion

We built a model to predict the lifespan of discourse
referents, teasing apart singletons from coreferent
mentions. The model validates existing linguistic
insights and performs well in its own right. This
alone has ramifications for tracking topics, identify-
ing protagonists, and modeling coreference and dis-
course coherence. We applied the lifespan model to
coreference resolution, showing how to incorporate
it effectively into a state-of-the-art rule-based coref-
erence system. We expect similar improvements
with machine-learning-based coreference systems,
where incorporating all the power of the lifespan
model would be easier.

Our lifespan model has been integrated into the
latest version of the Stanford coreference resolution
system.3

1At present, if the system links two mentions that do not
exist in the gold standard, the scorer adds two singletons to the
gold standard. This results in a higher B3 F1 score (when it
should be lower) because recall increases instead of staying the
same (precision goes up).

2In the modified scorer, twinless predicted mentions are
added to the gold standard to compute precision but not to com-
pute recall.
