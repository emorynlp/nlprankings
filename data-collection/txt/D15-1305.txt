Abstract

For sentiment classification, it is often
recognized that embedding based on dis-
tributional hypothesis is weak in captur-
ing sentiment contrast–contrasting words
may have similar local context. Based on
broader context, we propose to incorporate
Theta Pure Dependence (TPD) into the
Paragraph Vector method to reinforce top-
ical and sentimental information. TPD has
a theoretical guarantee that the word de-
pendency is pure, i.e., the dependence pat-
tern has the integral meaning whose under-
lying distribution can not be conditionally
factorized. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art performance on text clas-
sification tasks.

1 Introduction

Word embeddings can be learned by training a
neural probabilistic language model or a uni-
fied neural network architecture for various NLP
tasks (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and We-
ston, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011). In global
context-aware neural language model (Huang et
al., 2012), the global context vector is a weighted
average of all word embeddings of a single docu-
ment/paragraph. After trained with all word em-
beddings belonging to the current paragraph, a re-
sulting Paragraph Vector can be obtained. Actu-
ally, Le and Mikolov’s Paragraph Vector (Le and
Mikolov, 2014) is trained based on the log-linear
neural language model (Mikolov et al., 2013a).

For text classification, using a straightforward
extension of language model (e.g. Le and
Mikolov’s Paragraph Vector) is considered not to
be sensible. Embeddings learned for text classifi-
cation should be very different from that learned
for language modeling. For example, language

models often calculate the probability of a sen-
tence, therefore this is a good movie and this is
a bad movie may not be discriminated from each
other. In sentiment analysis task, the semantic
representation of words needs to tell word good
from bad, even if the two words have the same
local context. For this reason, the local depen-
dency is insufficient to model topical or sentiment
information. Fortunately, if we have the global
context of good like interesting or amazing, the
sentiment meaning of the embedding will be ex-
plicit. However, the training of log-linear neural
language model is based on local word dependen-
cies (e.g., the co-occurrence of the words in a local
window). Thus, Paragraph Vector can not explic-
itly model the word dependencies for those words
that do not frequently appear in a local window but
are actually closely dependent on each other.

In this paper, our aim is to extend the Paragraph
Vector with global context which can capture topi-
cal or sentiment information effectively. However,
if one explicitly considers the dependency patterns
that are beyond the local window level, there is a
possibility that the noisy dependency patterns can
be involved and modeled in the distributed repre-
sentation methods. Moreover, there should be an
unique and explicit topical meaning in the patterns
to guarantee no ambiguity in the global context.
Therefore, we need a dependency mining method
that not only models the long range dependency
patterns, but also provides a theoretical guarantee
that the dependency patterns are pure. Here, the
“pure” dependency pattern is an integral seman-
tic meaning/concept that cannot be factorized into
sub dependency patterns.

In the language of statistics, Conditional Pure
Dependence (CPD) means that the underlying dis-
tribution of the dependency patterns cannot be fac-
torized under certain conditions (e.g., priors, ob-
served words, etc.). It has been proved that CPD
is the high-level pure dependence in (Hou et al.,

2551



2013). However, judging CPD is NP-hard (Chick-
ering et al., 2004). Fortunately, Theta Pure De-
pendence (TPD) is the sufficient criteria of CPD
and can be identified in O(N) time, where N is the
number of words (Hou et al., 2013). This finding
motivates us to adopt TPD as the global context.
Moreover, compared with other conventional co-
occurrence-based methods, such as the Apriori al-
gorithm (Agrawal et al., 1993), TPD based on the
Information Geometry (IG) framework has a solid
theoretical interpretations in statistics to guarantee
the dependence is pure.

2 Modeling Topic with TPD

Compared with local context, global context can
usually capture the text topic more precisely. It
is easy to get local context by a sliding window.
We define the centered word as the current word
and the other words in the window as local con-
text words. Global context words are extracted
from all the documents in the corpus and can be
divided into two parts: a) the words in the current
document but outside of the local context window;
b) the words never appeared in the document but
in the corpus. The following example shows the
words mentioned above, and the topic (the scene
of filming) is easily captured by TPD:

• TPD: scene camera acting movie
Text: there [is great atmosphere in the scene from the
location , the] lighting , the fog and such , but the
camera should be slowly following the killer. . .

The bracket stands for the local context window,
and the size of window is 5, i.e. there are five lo-
cal context words (in italics) in both sides of the
current word (in bold). Global context words are
underlined in the example.

In order to model the topic explicitly, the depen-
dence pattern should report one and only one topi-
cal meaning. TPD has a theoretical guarantee that
the dependency has an integral meaning whose un-
derlying distribution can not be conditionally fac-
torized. Formally, given a set of binary random
variables X = {X1, . . . , Xn}, where Xi denotes
the occurrence (Xi = 1) or absence (Xi = 0) of
the i-th word. Then the n-order TPD over X can
be defined as follows.

DEFINITION 1. (TPD): X = {X1, . . . , Xn} is
of n-order Theta Pure Dependence (TPD), iff the
n-order θ coordinate θ12...n is significantly differ-
ent from zero. (Hou et al., 2013)

TPD can be effectively identified by an explicit
statistical test procedure: Log Likelihood Ratio

Test (LLRT) (Nakahara and Amari, 2002) for θ-
coordinate of IG. (Hou et al., 2013)

Here, we introduce two negative examples to
further emphasize the importance of utilizing
TPD. Example 1: can, with, of. The joint distri-
bution of this words combination can be uncon-
ditionally factorized directly, since the occurrence
of any word does not necessarily imply the occur-
rence of others. Example 2: London, Chelsea,
Sherlock Holmes. As we all know, both Chelsea
and Sherlock Holmes are closely related to Lon-
don. Chelsea and Sherlock Holmes are two rela-
tively independent topics, i.e. they are conditional
independent given London. Although the three
phrases are unconditionally dependent, their joint
distribution can be conditionally factorized. Thus
the dependency in both two examples can not be
pure.

To explain TPD and the characteristic “pure”
intuitively, let us look at a typical example of
TPD: climate, conference, Copenhagen. The co-
occurrence of the three words implies an un-
separable high-level semantic entity compared
with the two negative examples, introduced above.
In negative examples, the high frequency of words
co-occurrence can be explained as some kind of
“coincidence”, because each of them or their pair-
wise combinations has a high frequency, indepen-
dently. However, the co-occurrence of TPD words
cannot be fully explained as the random coinci-
dence of, e.g., the co-occurrence of Copenhagen
and conference (which can be any other confer-
ences in Copenhagen) and the occurrence of cli-
mate.

The word “pure” in Hou et al. (2013) means that
the joint probability distribution of these words is
significantly different from the product of lower-
order joint distributions or marginal distributions,
w.r.t all possible decompositions. More formally,
it requires that the joint distribution cannot be
factorized unconditionally (UPD) or conditionally
(CPD) in the language of graphical model. Let
xi ∈ {0, 1} denote the value of Xi. Let p(x),
x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T , be the joint probability dis-
tribution over X. Then the definitions of UPD and
CPD are as follows:

DEFINITION 2. (UPD): X = {X1, . . . , Xn}
is of n-order Unconditional Pure Dependence
(UPD), iff it can NOT be unconditionally fac-
torized, i.e., there does NOT exist a k-partition
{C1, C2, . . . , Ck} of X, k > 1, such at p(x) =

2552



p(c1) ∗ p(c2). . .p(ck), where p(ci), i = 1, . . . , k,
is the joint distribution over Ci. (Hou et al., 2013)

DEFINITION 3. (CPD): X = {X1, . . . , Xn} is
of n-order Conditional Pure Dependence (CPD),
iff it can NOT be conditionally factorized, i.e.,
there does NOT exist C0 ⊂ X and a k-partition
{C1, C2, . . ., Ck} of V = X − C0, k > 1, such at
p(v|c0) = p(c1|c0) ∗ p(c2|c0). . .p(ck|c0), where
p(v|c0) is the conditional joint distribution over
V given C0, and p(ci|c0), i = 1, 2, . . . , k, is the
conditional joint distribution over Ci given C0. In
case that C0 is an empty set, we define p(c0) =
1. (Hou et al., 2013)

Actually, CPD is stricter than UPD, and the
dependence which just satisfies UPD is not pure
enough to model the global context. Therefore,
“pure” in our paper refers to the characteristic of
CPD. However judging CPD is NP-hard. It is
proved that a significant nonzero n-order θ param-
eter (TPD) entails the n-order CPD/UPD in Hou
et al. (2013). The highest-order coordinate pa-
rameter in IG is a proper metric for the purity
(i.e., the unique semantics) of high-order depen-
dence. A pattern is TPD, iff the n-order θ coor-
dinate θ12...n is significantly different from zero.
Moreover, The Log Likelihood Ratio Test imple-
mented in the mixed coordinates can test whether
θ12...n is significantly different from zero.

Contrasting to TPD, the semantic coupling
among the associations in the two negative exam-
ples is much weaker. In conclusion, can, with, of
cannot give an explicit topic and London, Chelsea,
Sherlock Holmes includes at least two topics. the
co-occurrence of words in TPD (e.g. climate,
conference, Copenhagen) implies an un-separable
(pure) high-level semantic entity. A sufficient and
unbroken meaning of dependence can not only
supply the context but also avoid the ambiguity (or
noise) in global context. Therefore, the meaning
of pure is important in such a global context mod-
eling method.

3 Global PV-DBOW and Dependence
Vectors

A version of Paragraph Vector in Le and Mikolov
(2014) PV-DBOW is extended with TPD to a
new model: Global PV-DBOW (Glo-PV-DBOW).
TPD has been extracted from the corpus before
training. Given a sequence of training words w1,
w2, w3, . . . , wT and the global context glot of wt,
the objective of Glo-PV-DBOW is to maximize the

average log probability:

L =

+ log p(wt|glot) + log p(wt|doct)
] (1)

where c is the local context window size. The in-
dicator of the document that the current word wt
belongs to is denoted by doct. Further, we define
p(wt|glot) in equation (2):

p(wt|glot)

=
A∏

[
p(wt|depat )p(wt|wa1 , wa2 , . . . , waN )

] (2)
The indicator of the a-th wt’s TPD pattern is de-
noted as depat and can be trained to be a distributed
representation of TPD: dependence vector vdepat .
This (N+1)-order TPD consists of N+1 words: wa1 ,
wa2 . . . w

N and wt. The energy function of wt and

wi = (wt+j , doct, depat ) is uniform as follows:

E(wt, wi) = −vwtT vwi (3)

Hierarchical softmax (Morin and Bengio, 2005)
is adopted to reduce the cost of computation.
The binary tree is specified with a Huffman tree,
and the Huffman code of pseudo words mi in
wt’s Huffman path is denoted as xmi . For more
about hierarchical softmax we used, please re-
fer to (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Using stochas-
tic gradient descent (SGD), distributed representa-
tions of the word, dependence and document have
been trained. The update procedure of vwi =
(vwt+j , vdoct , vdepat ) is as same as the procedure
described in (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Thus, the
pseudo code for training TPD words is listed indi-
vidually:

4 Experiments

Apriori (not a pure dependency method) is con-
trastively adopted to implement Glo-PV-DBOW.
Glo-PV-DBOW-TPD and Glo-PV-DBOW-Apri
are all evaluated in two text classification tasks:
sentiment analysis and topic discovery. The suffix
(e.g., -2, -5) of our global method name denotes
the order of dependency (the number of words in
a dependence pattern). The order of dependency
is changed because we want to show the superi-
ority of the high-order TPD. The high-order TPD
provides the more rich and explicit global context
than the lower-order one since the high-order TPD
cannot be reduced to the random coincidence of
lower-order dependencies.

We cross-validate the hyperparameters and set
the local context window size as 10, the dimen-
sion of embeddings as 100. In sentiment anal-
ysis task, Apriori’s minimum support and TPD’s
theta 0 is respectively set as 0.004 and 1.4. While
in topic discovery task, Apriori’s minimum sup-
port and TPD’s theta 0 is around 0.020 and 2.0 re-
spectively. Since the classification accuracy of the
approaches compared is a single result, we do not
include any results for test of significance in our
method and only report the average accuracy.

4.1 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

The binary sentiment classification on the IMDB
dataset proposed by (Maas et al., 2011) is con-
ducted. Results in Fig.1 show that global methods’
performance is more stable than PV-DBOW’s.
Moreover, TPD works much better than Apriori,
especially in the high-order dependence. Note
that TPD-5 works better than TPD-2, while Apri-
5 works worse than Apri-2. It can be explained
that the Apriori algorithm is short of an explicit
statistical test procedure to guarantee the pure de-
pendence. Therefore, the Apriori algorithm is not
suitable for generating the high-order dependence.

Instead, the high-order TPD can provide the rich
and explicit global context for the model. Mean-
while, it is verified that our method is good at cap-
turing sentiment contrast.

Table 1 shows that Glo-PV-DBOW with 5-order
TPD achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
A promising result is an improvement of more
than 2% over result published in Le and Mikolov
(2014). Note that the algorithm process of Para-
graph Vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014) is much
more complex than PV-DBOW’s. Paragraph Vec-
tor includes an extra inference stage. In addition,
Paragraph Vector’s document vector is a combina-
tion of two vectors: one learned by PV-DBOW and
the other learned by Distributed Memory Model
of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) (Le and Mikolov,
2014). The combined document vector has 800
dimensions, while all vectors in our experiments
only have 100 dimensions.

4.2 Topic Discovery on News
The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of ap-
proximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, parti-
tioned across 20 different newsgroups. We fol-
low (Crammer et al., 2012) to create binary prob-
lems from the dataset by creating binary decision
problems of choosing between two similar groups.
Therefore, the dataset is split into two sub-datasets
as follows: comp: comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware vs.
comp.sys.mac.hardware and sci: sci.electronics
vs. sci.med. Similarly, 1800 examples balanced
between the two labels were selected for each
problem.

is recorded in Table 2. Compared with
Confidence-weighted (Crammer et al., 2012) and
PV-DBOW (Le and Mikolov, 2014), our extended
models achieve the highest accuracy on each sub-
dataset. Moreover, TPD as a pure dependence
works better than Apriori when they provide the
global context for our model. The topical infor-
mation is effectively reinforced in embeddings by
incorporating TPD.

4.3 Analysis on Word Embeddings

The cosine similarity of each word pair in 20
Newsgroups is computed. We list four center
words and their nearest neighbors in PV-DBOW
and Glo-PV-DBOW groups respectively. The
rankings are labeled in front of neighbor words,
and some notable neighbor words are in bold.

From Table 3, we can see that the statistical
information of corpus like words co-occurrence
can be mined by TPD. Therefore, the Glo-PV-
DBOW’s embeddings are context-aware and it can
help a lot for classification tasks. The top 40 near-
est neighbors of ibm are investigated, and we find
macintosh and mac appeared in the PV-DBOW
group but not in the Glo-PV-DBOW group. In

the corpus, the topic of documents is either ibm or
mac. If we perform a classification task on ”ibm
versus mac”, it will be hard to classify in the PV-
DBOW group. That is because PV-DBOW tends
to regard ibm and mac both as computers. How-
ever, the two different computer brands are distin-
guished in Glo-PV-DBOW. Further, ibm and mac
co-occur rarely in one document, and the statisti-
cal information is noted by TPD.

5 Conclusion

This paper proposes to incorporate Theta Pure De-
pendence into Paragraph Vector to capture more
topical and sentimental information in the con-
text. The extended model is applied to a sen-
timent classification task and a topical detection
task. Our accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-
art result on the movie and news datasets. The ap-
proach can be improved further to fully leverage
the un-factorized sense of high-order Theta Pure
Dependence. In future, we will explore the appli-
cations of dependence distributed representation.
