     In modern time a lot of 

connections   developed among 

various nations, and     people 

became acquainted with several 

languages. New conceptions 

move from their origin in a 

certain language to another 

surrounding. Hebrew also 

adopted many new words from 

foreign origin, but there is a 

difficulty to adopt foreign verbs 

in Hebrew, since a Hebrew verb 

must be in a certain pattern. This 

short paper explains how a 

special device has developed in 

the Hebrew grammar to cope 

with this need.   

 

 

 
1   Hebrew words in array 

Most Hebrew words are arranged in a "root 

pattern array". Each line contains a root, 

which is a sequence of three or more 

consonants, and each column contains a 

pattern built as a sequence of vowels, 

sometimes accompanied by one consonant 

or two. Each pattern also contains three or 

four slots in which the consonants of the 

root should enter (Figure 1). 

Thus a word appears in each square 

containing the consonants of the root 

interwoven into the pattern (Figure 2). There 

are several thousands roots, and 100 – 120 

patterns of nouns but only seven patterns of 

verbs. Nouns may be of foreign origins, but 

verbs should be in the seven patterns only.  

  2   Empty squares for innovations 
Many      squares   in   the   array    are actually 

empty.  They   may   become   full   if     new    

words     are     needed    to    be introduced into 

the language. Usually it happens if a speaker 

does not find a word that expresses his/her 

idea. He/She chooses a proper root, and by 

looking for proper pattern, a new word is 

produced and from here it shifts into the 

dictionary (described in Figure 2). 

 

3   Verbal and nominal expressions 

Languages have both verbal and nominal 

expressions. Speakers sometimes need both. 

In order to express an idea which contains 

both a noun and a verb, it is possible to use a 

"general purpose" verb, which expresses a 

general meaning of doing, such as do, make, 

or act etc., and relate it to the noun. Here are 

some expressions in Hebrew: First, general 

purpose Hebrew verbs: 

 

lipˁol= to act,  

le-bacceˁ =to perform,  

la-ˁsot= to do, to make. 
    

 And some examples of actual use: 

 la-ˁśot  ma`amaççim = to make efforts,  

le-harim telepon = to pick up a 

telephone,  

lišloaḥ mibraq = to send a telegram,   

la-ˁrok biqqur = to pay a visit. 

 

 

4   Same root for both 

It is very common that both the verbal and 

the nominal expressions be of the same root, 

such as:  

94



    

 liktob miktab = to write a letter  

(root:   k't'b' ) 

  lsapper sippur = to tell a story  

 (root:  s'p'r'). 

 

 Such use of expression is specially 

significant in Hebrew for a need to add an 

adjective to the noun while the real meaning 

is to add an adverbial description to the verb. 

E.g., by the nominal phrase "important 

decision" such as in Hebrew : le-haḥliṭ 

haḥlaṭa ḥašuba (root: ḥ ' l ' ṭ ' ) = to decide 

an  important decision. Here  both noun and 

verb are of the same root. Sometimes the 

verbal expression itself includes the idea of 

the nominal expression, such as,  

 

    le-habriq = lišloḥ mibraq (to telegraph, 

or to   send a telegram),   

    le-hištakker= lištot le-šokra (to drink up 

to   toxication),    

    le-hitraggez =  le-habbiˁ  rogez ( to  

    express  anger). 

 

5   Foreign nouns need "squeezing"    

But  what about  foreign nouns?   Modern 

world offers a lot of contacts for  speakers of  

various  languages, and   Hebrew  also   got  

a lot of  foreign  nouns   from    many  

languages. These nouns are not   included in 

the  array.  and what  is more important, they  

do   not  have   roots, while  Hebrew 

speakers   are   used   to   connect    nouns 

and   verbs, preferably through common 

roots. A special procedure developed in 

Hebrew grammar, which produces roots 

from foreign    nouns. This procedure is 

"squeezing": We squeeze the noun and get 

its vowels out
1
. What remain is its 

consonants only.  

   This sequence of consonants is considered 

to be used as a new root. The new root is put 

in a new line in the list of roots at the 

root-pattern array, and of course on the spot a 

lot of new empty squares appear along the 

line of the new root. Some of them are verbal 

patterns.   Now   one   can   choose   a   proper 

verbal pattern   and   here   a new Hebrew 

verb appears.

   See, Ornan 1976 (in Hebrew), Ornan 1990 

p. 88. 

6  Root  is  sequence  of consonants 

For example, a new instrument is invented 

somewhere in a foreign country and has been 

brought to the Hebrew speakers  together  

with  its  name: It  is  the telephone. We have 

mentioned it above in the first appearance in 

the idiom  le-harim telepon,  but sometimes 

after  that  we find another word which 

conveys the same meaning, i.e., le- talpen =  

to phone. This verb  may appear of course in 

various verbal structures, such as  

 

          tilpanti = I phoned, 
          talpenu elay = please phone me,  etc.  

 

   The   verb   appeared   as   a   result   of    the 

squeezing process. From telephone we got the 

sequence of consonants t l p n . and that was 

enough to add a new line in the root lines of 

the root-pattern array. ( [p] and [f] relate to the 

same phoneme /p/ even in Modern Hebrew.)  

 

7   Squeezing is original procedure 

This procedure of squeezing has been active 

even in ancient times. It can be seen in the 

Greek word which entered into Hebrew as 

well as to many languages – basis. We have a 

Hebrew verb based on the root b s s , which 

was squeezed from basis in ancient time and 

is being used since Mishnaic Hebrew until 

modern time. 

 

8   Squeezing in Hebrew increased 

In Modern time squeezing seems to increase. 

Many new ideas appeared in the wide world, 

and Hebrew did not stay behind. Beside other 

ways of innovation of new words from wide 

world origin, we find a lot of new words, 

especially verbs, which have been coined by 

squeezing. See for example what happened to 

English words such as compilation, debug, 

format, fax, discuss, Pascal, Pasteur, Rentgen. 

They all passed through squeezing, even if 

some of them are not necessarily nouns. For 

example, 

le-qampel = to compile (code), 

le-dabbeg = to debug, 

le-farmet = to format, 

le-faqses= to send a  fax note 

le-dasqes = to discuss, to talk 

le-fasqel = run a Pascal code, 

le-faster = pasterize, 

           le-rantgen = to X-ray.

     9   Squeezing of Hebrew words 

Next development of the squeezing 

procedure is that it began to work also on 

Hebrew words. It happened whenever a 

speaker feels that the old root does not 

satisfy his/her needs. A good example is 

the noun mispar which exists in the root-

pattern array, with the root s'p'r' and 

pattern mi—a-. Its meaning is "a 

number", and the verb sapar means "to 

count". Now what happens when you 

need to express the idea of giving  

numbers to a bunch  of  pages or names in 

a long queue. The verb sapar "count" is 

not proper. So the noun mispar has been 

squeezed and a new root,  m ' s ' p ' r '   

appeared in a new line at the array, 

producing a new verb le-masper = to 

give numbers. Another example is himḥiz. 

Its root m ḥ z  squeezed from maḥze = 

stage play, a noun of root ḥ ' z ' y '  (The m 

is from the pattern). The procedure is so 

strong that even a sequence of two  

adjacent  words  may  be  squeezed  such 

as "ˁad ka`n" which means "up to the 

present". This idiom was squeezed, and 

we got a new root: ˁ ' d ' k ' n ' , from 

which a verb as well as an adjective 

appeared:  

  

    le-ˁadken et ha-ḥadašot = to  update 

the   news, or  

    ha-ti``ur lo` mˁudkan = the 

description is  not uptodate.2

 The squeezing procedure suggestion 

explains the connection between verbs and 

their origin much easier and nicer than the 

efforts done by Outi Bat-El, 1994. She speaks 

about "extracting", which is the exact 

"squeezing" described in Ornan, 1976 and 

Ornan, 1990 (without mentioning them), but 

tries to adopt it to another theory based on 

four elements (by McCarthy 1981) which 

includes adding vowels in a separate 

procedure, without including any formative 

consonant to a pattern, while the suggested 

approach here is based on two elements 

(pattern and root) only, and we include 

patterns which may contain consonants.
