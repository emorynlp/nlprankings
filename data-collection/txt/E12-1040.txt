Abstract

In this talk, I will address the problem of grounding linguistic analysis in control applications, such
as game playing and robot navigation. We assume access to natural language documents that describe
the desired behavior of a control algorithm (e.g., game strategy guides). Our goal is to demonstrate
that knowledge automatically extracted from such documents can dramatically improve performance
of the target application. First, I will present a reinforcement learning algorithm for learning to map
natural language instructions to executable actions. This technique has enabled automation of tasks
that until now have required human participation — for example, automatically configuring software
by consulting how-to guides. Next, I will present a Monte-Carlo search algorithm for game playing
that incorporates information from game strategy guides. In this framework, the task of text inter-
pretation is formulated as a probabilistic model that is trained based on feedback from Monte-Carlo
search. When applied to the Civilization strategy game, a language-empowered player outperforms
its traditional counterpart by a significant margin.
