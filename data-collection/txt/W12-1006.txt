Abstract

We present on-going work on the auto-
mated ontology-based detection and recog-
nition of characters in folktales, restricting
ourselves for the time being to the anal-
ysis of referential nominal phrases occur-
ring in such texts. Focus of the presently
reported work was to investigate the inter-
action between an ontology and linguistic
analysis of indefinite and indefinite nomi-
nal phrase for both the incremental annota-
tion of characters in folktales text, includ-
ing some inference based co-reference res-
olution, and the incremental population of
the ontology. This in depth study was done
at this early stage using only a very small
textual base, but the demonstrated feasibil-
ity and the promising results of our small-
scale experiment are encouraging us to de-
ploy the strategy on a larger text base, cov-
ering more linguistic phenomena in a mul-
tilingual fashion.

1 Introduction

In this submission we present on-going work
dealing with the automatic annotation of charac-
ters in folktales. Focus of the investigation lies in
using an iterative approach that combines an in-
cremental ontology population and an incremen-
tal linguistic annotation. Our starting point is
given by an in-house developed ontology, which
is having as its core the description of family rela-
tions, but also some typical elements of folktales,
like supernatural entities, etc.

The use of ontologies in the field of folktales is
not new, but to our knowledge no attempt has been
done so far to use ontologies in combination with
natural language processing for automatizing the

annotation of folktales, or for automatically popu-
lating a knowledge base of characters of folktales.
The work by (Peinado et al., 2004) is dealing in
first line with the Proppian functions that charac-
ter can play and is also geared towards generation
of interactive stories. (Zoelllner-Weber, 2008) is
much closer to our aim, and in fact the author is
proposing lines of research we want to implement
in the near future, but her work is explicitly not
dealing with the automation of annotation, and
she is also not concerned with linguistic annota-
tion in particular, but with general TEI annota-
tion1 of text structures.

At the present stage of development, we re-
stricted ourselves to investigate the role indefi-
nite and definite nominal phrases (NPs) can play
for the detection of characters and their storage
as instances of ontology classes. This decision
is echoing well-established investigations on one
possible function of indefinite NPs, namely to in-
troduce a new referent in a discourse (see among
others (von Heusinger, 2000)), whereas indefinite
NPs can be used in the subsequent text to refer
back to the introduced referential entities. This
fact has also been acknowledged in the field of
folktales and narratives and (Herman, 2000), for
example, stressed the importance of analyzing se-
quences of referring expressions for achieving a
more complete and accurate view on the role of
participants in narratives.

Discourse models resulting from the sequence
of referring expressions can thus support the com-
prehension of narratives (see (Herman, 2000),p.
962). Agreeing with this study, we further think
that the automated analysis of referential expres-

sions in folktales, delivering essential elements
for the character models used in the interpretation
of narratives, can be of help in the automated anal-
ysis of the whole folktale, and more generally for
the automated analysis of narratives.

While (Herman, 2000) treats the role of
anaphora used in transcripts of ghost stories, we
deal (for the time being) only with the relation
between characters introduced by indefinite NPs
and their subsequent enunciation by definite NPs.

In the next sections we present the main com-
ponents of the current version of our system. We
discuss also the results of a first evaluation study,
and conclude with indication on future work.

2 The Ontology

As mentioned above, our starting point is an on-
tology, developed at our lab. This ontology will
be made publicly available, after merging it with
further ontological elements relevant to the field
of narratives, as those are for example described
in (Zoelllner-Weber, 2008), and associating its
classes and relations with elements relevant for
the linguistic and semantic annotation of folk-
tales, as described for example in (Scheidel and
Declerck, 2010).

The class hierarchy and the associated relations
(or properties) are equipped with natural language
labels and comments. The labels are available in
four languages: Bulgarian, English, German and
Russian. But our work is dealing for the time be-
ing only with English.

An example of class of the ontology, with its
labels is given just below:

<owl:Class rdf:about="#BiolDaughter">

<owl:equivalentClass>

<owl:Class>

<owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType="Collection">

<owl:Restriction>

<owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasBiolParent"/>

<owl:onClass rdf:resource="#BiolParent"/>

<owl:minQualifiedCardinality

rdf:datatype="&xsd;nonNegativeInteger">

1</owl:minQualifiedCardinality>

</owl:Restriction>

<owl:Restriction>

<owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasGender"/>

<owl:hasValue>f</owl:hasValue>

</owl:Restriction>

</owl:intersectionOf>

</owl:Class>

</owl:equivalentClass>

<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#BiolChild"/>

<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Daughter"/>

<rdfs:comment>The class of biological daughther is

a subclass of biological child and of daughter.

This class designates all biological daughters.

Each member of this class has gender female

and at least one biological parent.

&#1086;&#1095;&#1100;

</dc:language>

</owl:Class>

The ontology also encodes inference rules that
allow establishing automatically family relations
between entities (characters) that have been stored
at the instance level, which is the process of on-
tology population resulting from detection in the
text.

1. hasParent(?x, ?x1), hasParent(?x, ?x2), hasParent(?y,
?x1), hasParent(?y, ?x2), hasGender(?x, ”f”), notE-
qual(?x, ?y)→ Sister(?x)

2. Daughter(?d) , Father(?f) , Son(?s)→ hasBrother(?d,
?s), hasChild(?f, ?s), hasChild(?f, ?d), hasSister(?s,
?d)

The first rule is about class inference. It states
that if two different individuals in the ontology
(represented by the variables x and y) share the
same parents (represented by the variables x1 and
x2) and if the gender of one of the two individuals
is female, then this individual can be considered
as an instance of the ontology class Sister.

According to the second rule, various relations
(or properties) can be inferred from the fact that
we have three individuals (represented by the vari-
ables d, f and s) that are instances of the classes

31



Daughter, Father and Son respectively. The first
inferred relations state that the Daughter has the
Son as her Brother and the Son reciprocally has
the Daughter as his Sister. In addition, the Father
is being assigned twice the HASCHILD property,
once for the Daughter and second for the Son.

3 Processing Steps

We submit first a folktale, here the ”Magic Swan
Geese”2, to a linguistic processing engine (the
NooJ platform, see (Silberztein, 2003)), applying
to the text nominal phrases recognition rules (in-
cluding coordination), which are differentiated in
being either indefinite or definite (we do not con-
sider pronouns for the time being). All annotated
NPs are indexed with ID numbers.

In the following step, our algorithm extracts
from the whole annotated text the nominal heads
of the indefinite NPs and compares them with the
labels present in the ontology. In case a match can
be established, the nominal head of this phrase is
used for populating the corresponding ontology
class as an individual and the text is annotated
with the nominal head being a (potential) char-
acter, as can be seen in the annotation example
below, where the reader can observe that the (po-
tential) characters are also enumerated, this time
on the base of the (unique) ID they get during
the ontology population phase. In this step thus,
all candidate characters in text are automatically
marked-up with both linguistic and character in-
formation derived from the ontology.

<text>

they had

"daughter" HEAD2="son" Type="and">

<NP id="indef_ph3" SPEC="a"

HEAD="daughter" Gender="f" Num="s">

and

<NP id="indef_ph4" SPEC="a" HEAD="son"

Gender="m" Num="s">

<CHAR id="ch4" TYPE="son" Gender="m"

Num="s">

a little son</CHAR>

</NP>

</NPCOORD>

In the next step, the inference rules of the ontol-
ogy are applied to the candidate characters (the in-
dividuals stored so far in the knowledge base). In
the particular tale we are analysing the class asso-
ciated with the potential character ch2 (Woman)
can be equated with the class Mother and its as-
sociated string in the label (mother), so that all
occurrences of the two strings in the text can be
marked as referring to the same character.

Also some relations are established between
the individuals by the application of the inference
rules described in the ontology section above:
Wife of, Mother Of, etc. (together with the
strings listed in the labels). If the related strings
are found in definite NPs in the text, the cor-
responding segment can then be annotated by

32



our linguistic processing engine with the origi-
nal character identifier. In the example below, the
reader can see that on the base of the inference
rules, the string mother in the definite NP (with
ID DEF PH6) is referred to ch2 (see the first an-
notation example above for the first occurrence of
ch2).

<NP id="def_ph6" SPEC="the" HEAD="mother"

Gender="f" Num="s">

the mother</NP>

said: "Daughter, daughter, we are going

to work; we shall bring you back

<NP id="indef_ph7" SPEC="a" HEAD="bun"

Gender="n" Num="s">

<CHAR id="ch6" TYPE="bun" Gender="n"

Num="s">a little bun</CHAR>

</NP>

, sew you <NP id="indef_ph8" SPEC="a"

HEAD="dress" Gender="n" Num="s">

<CHAR id="ch7" TYPE="dress"

Gender="n" Num="s">

a little dress</CHAR>

</NP>

The same remark is valid for the ch3 (”a
daughter” introduced in the first sentence of the
tale). In the definite NP with ID 12, the string
(daughter) is occurring in the context of a def-
inite NP, and thus marked as referring to ch3.
The string (girl) is occurring four times in the
context of definite NPs (with IDs 18, 25, 56 and
60) and for all those 4 occurrences the inference
driven mark-up of the nominal head with ch3
turns out to be correct.

In this annotation example, the reader can also
see that the heads of all indefinite NPs are first
considered as potential characters. A preliminary
filtering of such expression like dress is not pos-
sible, since in folktales, every object can be an
actant. So for example in this tale, an oven, an
apple tree or a river of milk are play-
ing an important role, and are characters involved
in specific actions. Our filtering is rather taking
place in a post-processing phase: strings that get

only once related to a potential character ID and
which are not involved in an action are at the end
discarded.

The next steps are dealing with finding other
occurrences of the potential characters (within
definite NPs), or to exclude candidates from the
set.

4 Evaluation of the approach

In order to be able to evaluate our approach,
even considering that we are working on a very
small text base, we designed a first basic test data
and annotated manually the folktale ”The magic
swan geese” with linguistic and character anno-
tation. The linguistic annotation is including co-
referential information. In the longer term, we
plan to compare our work applied to more folk-
tales with a real gold standard, the UMIREC cor-
pus (http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/57507)

Our evaluation study shows results in terms of
correct detection of tale characters in compari-
son with the manually annotated data. Eight of
the real characters were correctly classified by the
tool. Three of the instances are actually charac-
ters but they were not detected. One candidate is
not a character according to the manually anno-
tated data, but the system classified it as charac-
ter. Seven entities were correctly detected as non
characters. On this small basis, we calculated the
accuracy of the tool, which is 79%. We also com-
puted the precision, the recall and the F-measure.
The precision amounts to 88%; the recall to 73%;
and the value of the balanced F-measure is 80%.
So these metrics confirm what the accuracy has
been already expressing: the results are encour-
aging.
Looking at the errors made by the tool, we know
that it does not consider the characters that are
mentioned only one time. In our text, a hedge-
hog occurs only once. However, the human intu-
ition is that it is a character and differs from the
phrases a bun and a dress, which have just de-
scriptive function. In a next version of the tool,
it will be checked if the head of an indefinite NP,
which is present only once in the text, is having
an active semantic role, like Agent. In this case, it
can be considered as a character.

Another problem of our actual approach is that
we do not consider yet the possessive phrases and
pronominal expressions. Precise analysis of these
anaphoric expressions will improve the approach

33



in augmenting the number of occurrences of can-
didate characters. We also expect the availability
of related instances in the knowledge base to help
in resolving pronominal co-reference phenomena.

The applied method does not detect one of the
main characters in the sample text namely the
swan-geese. The swan-geese are introduced in the
discourse only via a definite noun phrase. If there
are some equivalent phrases, for example occur-
ring in the title of the tale, they can be annotated
as character by the tool. An additional problem
we have, is the fact that our NP grammar has ana-
lyzed the words swan and geese as separate nouns
and not as a compound noun. So that the linguis-
tic analysis for English compounds has to be im-
proved.

5 Conclusion and future work

Our in depth investigation of the interaction of an
ontology and language processing tools for the
detection of folktale characters and their use for
incrementally populating an ontology seems to be
promising, and it has allowed for example to asso-
ciate a unique character ID to occurrences of dif-
ferent nominal heads, on the base of their inferred
semantic identity. A possible result of our work
would lie in the constitution of larger database
containing characters of narratives extracted au-
tomatically from text.

We plan to tackle the processing of pronominal
and possessive expressions for completing the co-
reference task. We plan also to extend our work to
other languages, and we already started to do this
for anaother folktale in German, in which much
more complex family relationships are involved
(the German version of the tale ”Father Frost”).
But more challenging will be to deal with lan-
guages, which do not know have the difference
between indefinite and definite NPs.
