Abstract

We report on a newly available gazetteer
of historical English place-names and de-
scribe how it was created from a re-
cent digitisation of the Survey of En-
glish Place-Names, published by the En-
glish Place-Name Society (EPNS). The
gazetteer resource is accessible via a num-
ber of routes, not currently as linked data
but in formats that do provide connections
between a number of different datasets. In
particular, connections between the histor-
ical gazetteer and the Unlock1 and GeoN-
ames2 gazetteer services have been es-
tablished along with links to the Key
to English Place-Names database3. The
gazetteer is available via the Unlock API
and in the final part of the paper we
describe how the Edinburgh Geoparser,
which forms the basis of Unlock Text, has
been adapted to allow users to georefer-
ence historical texts.

1 Introduction

Place and time are important concepts for histori-
cal scholarship and it has frequently been observed
that an ability to examine document sets through
spatial and temporal filters is one that is highly
useful to historians. Georeferencing (or geopars-
ing) is therefore a technology that has been applied
to historical data in numerous projects (for exam-
ple Hitchcock et al. (2011), Crane (2004), Rupp et
al. (2013), Isaksen et al. (2011), Hinrichs et al. (to
appear 2014), Grover et al. (2010)). A significant
problem, however, is that available georeferenc-
ing tools are mostly only able to access modern
gazetteer information, meaning that place-names
that have changed over time are less likely to be
recognised and are highly unlikely to be prop-

erly grounded to correct coordinates. The prob-
lems can be illustrated with two examples, first
the name Jorvik which is a well-known historical
name for the English city of York and second the
name Bearla, a historical name attested in a docu-
ment from 1685 for the modern settlement Barlow
in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now North York-
shire). A first observation is that a named entity
recognition (NER) component of a georeferencing
system may or may not recognise these as place-
names: recognition will depend on the lexical re-
sources or training data used as well as the docu-
ment context in which the name occurs. Assuming
both the names can be recognised, they must then
be disambiguated with reference to a gazetteer so
that coordinates can be assigned to them. A search
for the names using Unlock Places, which pro-
vides access to Ordnance Survey records, returns
no results for either. A search in GeoNames re-
turns York for Jorvik but nothing for Bearla. An-
other historical form for Barlow is Borley: both
GeoNames and Unlock have records for a mod-
ern Borley in Essex but this is clearly not the cor-
rect interpretation of the historical Borley. These
examples illustrate some of the problems and in-
dicate that a historian wanting to georeference a
particular document will get patchy output at best
from current technology.

The Digital Exposure of English Place-names
(DEEP) project4 has addressed these issues by
digitising and processing the Survey of En-
glish Place-Names to create the DEEP Histori-
cal Gazetteer (DHG). Below we first describe the
Survey of English Place-Names and then explain
how we have used XML-based language process-
ing tools to convert the digitised volumes into the
DHG and other structured resources. We outline
the ways in which the resources are made available
to users and we discuss the modifications we have
made to the Edinburgh Geoparser to allow users to

georeference their historical documents. We con-
clude by discussing some outstanding issues and
consider the steps that will be needed to turn our
resources into linked data.

2 The Survey of English Place-Names

The Survey of English Place-Names is a schol-
arly body of work aimed primarily at readers in-
terested in the origins and development of the
place-names of England. The Survey is arranged
by historic counties, with the first volume, from
1925, covering Buckinghamshire, and the most re-
cent volume, published in 2012, dealing with part
of Shropshire. In the early volumes the Survey
was largely limited to major place-names, i.e. the
names of towns and villages, but from the 1950s
onwards the volumes have become more complex
and include many minor names as well as field-
names and street-names. More recently treated
counties are described across multiple volumes
and the growing scale of coverage has meant that
there are still some counties which are only partly
covered or not covered at all. Nevertheless, the
vast majority of the English counties have been
surveyed and the resulting body of work is a valu-
able resource for scholars of many kinds.

Figure 1 shows an excerpt from p. 23 of Vol.
33 of the Survey (1961) which covers the Wapen-
takes of Barkston Ash, Skyrack and Ainsty in the
West Riding of Yorkshire. The excerpt shows the
start of the entry for Barlow, the first settlement de-
scribed in the parish of Brayton. In brackets after
the name is an Ordnance Survey (OS) map refer-
ence followed by an indication of the pronuncia-
tion of the name. Next comes a block of historical
forms of the name with information about their at-
testations. For example, Bernlega is attested in a
document dated around 1030 referred to by the ab-

breviation YCh 7, standing for volume 7 of Early
Yorkshire Charters (ed. W. Farrer, C. T. Clay,
1914-55). A set of related forms, Berlai, Berlaia,
Berley, Berleye, Berlay, and Berlaye, have been
attested in several documents ranging from the
Domesday Book (DB) in 1086 through to Inqui-
sitions post mortem (Ipm) in 1498. Other forms,
including Borley and Bearla discussed above, fol-
low. The final paragraph deals with the etymology
of the name, relating it to the Old English words
for ‘barn’ or ‘barley’ (and for the second part to
the element lēah meaning ‘clearing’).

3 Conversion to structured format

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the Survey pro-
vides a wealth of information with the potential
to be useful for many purposes and, in particular,
it contains precisely the kind of information that
is needed to make a historical gazetteer. In the
DEEP project we have digitised all 86 volumes of
the Survey and have processed the output of OCR
to convert it into a structured format.

As the example illustrates, the format of the vol-
umes is semi-structured with a fairly consistent
use of style and font to indicate various kinds of
information (e.g. bold font for etymological ele-
ments, italics for historical forms). The layout is
extremely important with every comma and tab
contributing to the interpretation of the informa-
tion. For this reason, OCR quality needs to be ex-
ceptionally high and we have been fortunate that
our digitisation partner was able to ensure this high
quality. As the survey was created over a period of
decades under the supervision of several editors,
there is some variability in format across the vol-
umes. The most pertinent variation concerns grid
references: early volumes either do not have any
or use grid references that cannot be converted to

120



Figure 2: Processing pipeline

latitude/longitude. In many of the later volumes
modern OS grid references or older OS sheet-
number grid references are provided for main set-
tlements within parishes and sometimes for more
minor settlements. However, many of the later
volumes do not contain any grid references at all
and a significant part of the processing deals with
these problems (see Section 3.2).

3.1 Processing pipeline
Figure 2 shows the XML-based processing
pipeline that we have created for converting from
the OCR output of a Survey volume into a heavily
annotated XML version of the volume’s text. The
input is not raw OCR output but a version in which
human OCR correctors have also added pseudo-
XML tags to indicate very high level structure cor-
responding to the nesting of blocks of text. Thus
the block of text for a parish contains subordinate
blocks for settlements within that parish and they
in turn contain subordinate blocks for minor places
and street- and field-names located within them.
The parish text blocks are themselves contained
within blocks for larger historical administrative
units such as hundreds, wapentakes, wards, bor-
oughs, chapelries etc. and the block that encom-
passes all the places within it is the county itself.

In step 1 in Figure 2 the input file is converted
from Word (.doc file) to OpenOffice’s XML (.odt)
format. From this we extract the textual content,
the manually added structural tags and all relevant
font and style information. The manual structural
mark-up is converted to XML elements so that
containment relations between places are encoded
in the tree-structure of the XML document. From
this point all further processing incrementally adds
mark-up within the XML structure.

We use the LT-XML2 and LT-TTT2 tools which
form the basis of the Edinburgh Geoparser and

which have been developed specifically for rule-
based processing of text in NLP systems (Grover
and Tobin (2006), Tobin et al. (2010)). Along with
shell scripting these tools allow us to build up the
components that comprise the pipeline. The out-
put of step 2 contains XML elements for para-
graphs, sentences and word/punctuation tokens.
Font and style information is encoded as attributes
on the tokens and line break hyphenation is re-
paired. Part-of-speech tagging is unnecessary: the
named entity classes we recognise are primarily
identified by position in the document or on the
page in combination with font and style informa-
tion.

Once the tokens are marked up, finer-grained
structural mark-up can be computed inside the
wider structure (step 3). Blocks of attestations
and etymology descriptions are identified and
the title lines of the sections are segmented into
elements—e.g. in Figure 1 BARLOW is marked up
as the modern name of the place, 97-6428 is recog-
nised as a grid reference and "ba:l@ is recognised as
a pronunciation. Also at this stage, lists of smaller
place-, field- and street-names are segmented into
individual items.

The NER processing in step 4 uses specially de-
veloped rule sets to add detailed mark-up inside
sets of attestations. The first line of the attestations
in Figure 1 is given the following structure (tokeni-
sation, font and style information suppressed):
<altset>
<alt>
<histform>Bernlege</histform>
<attested>
<date>c. 1030</date>
<source id="wr796">YCh <item>7</item></source>

</attested>
</alt>
</altset>

Here YCh is the source of the attestation for the
historical form Bernlege and the interpretation of
the YCh abbreviation is referenced by the id at-

121



tribute on the source element. Step 4 also uses rule
sets to recognise parts of etymological descrip-
tions adding within-sentence mark-up like this:
<s> ...
<etympart>
<lang>OE</lang>
<form>bern</form>
</etympart>
’<gloss>barn</gloss>’ (v.
<etympart>
<pn-element>bere-aern</pn-element>
</etympart>) ...

</s>

Step 5 applies rules for non-geographic ground-
ing. For dates, begin and end attributes are com-
puted with obvious values for simple dates and
date ranges, a twenty-year window for circa dates,
other sized windows for century parts (e.g. the first
twenty-five years for the early part of a century)
and specific periods for regnal dates (Hy 1 denotes
Henry I who reigned from 1100 to 1135):
<date begin="1086" end="1086">1086</date>
<date begin="1130" end="1139">1130-9</date>
<date begin="1020" end="1040">c. 1030</date>
<date begin="1200" end="1225">e. 13</date>
<date begin="1100" end="1135">Hy 1</date>

Place-name elements (<pn-element>) are dealt
with at the same stage. These are etymological
parts, indicated with bold font in the Survey texts,
which belong to a finite set of vocabulary items
used in place-names. Place-name elements are
catalogued in the Key To English Place-Names
(KEPN) database. We look the elements up in
KEPN and record their database ID when a match
is successful. The final two steps in the processing
relate to geographic grounding and are described
in more detail in the next section.

We have not been able to perform a formal eval-
uation of the NER component in the pipeline be-
cause we do not have a manually annotated test
set. However, we did implement cycles of qual-
ity assurance by place-name experts to feed into
rule set improvements, so we are confident that
the information extracted is of high quality. Our
main priority was to capture the historical name
attestations for the parishes and main settlements
in the Survey. For the blocks that these occur in
(e.g. the attestation block in Figure 1) we can get
an informal indication of performance by count-
ing the number of non-punctuation tokens that fail
to be recognised as part of a historical name or
attestation entity. For example, for the three vol-
umes for Derbyshire (published in 1959), there
are 342 blocks of main settlement attestations in
which our system found 4,052 historical forms as-
sociated with 5,817 attestations. There were nine
lines of text in these blocks where the processing
failed to assign all the words to an entity, result-

ing in around 20 histform-attestation pairs being
missed. Performance is slightly more variable for
smaller settlements and lists of streets and field-
names, but it is harder to estimate an error rate for
these.

3.2 Georeferencing the Survey
To create a historical gazetteer, we need to asso-
ciate coordinates with every place-name and we
do this by aggregating information from several
sources and by allowing un-georeferenced place-
names to inherit coordinates from a place higher in
the XML structure. As described above, some of
the Survey volumes associate grid references with
some of the places but the coverage is too sporadic
to rely on. We therefore use the geographic infor-
mation in the KEPN database to acquire reliable
geo-references as far as possible. KEPN supplies
latitude/longitude point coordinates for major set-
tlements (the larger units inside parishes) and we
automatically query KEPN for these references,
adding the coordinates into the XML in special
<geo> elements. For our example of Barlow the
<geo> is this:

<geo source="kepn" kepnref="14600" long="-1.02337"
lat="53.7489" placename="Barlow"/>

This information is the most authoritative geo-
graphic information that we can access but we do
not want to discard the other authoritative source
of information contained in the grid references
in some of the volumes, especially since these
may be attached to smaller places not covered by
KEPN. We therefore recognise them during the
processing, convert them to latitude/longitude and
store their coordinates in <geo source=“epns”>
elements:
<geo source="epns" lat="53.7489" long="-1.02337"/>

(In this case the coordinates from the two sources
are identical but there are cases where they differ
slightly.)

Once we have stored KEPN/EPNS geographic
information, we implement strategies to achieve
high-quality georeferencing of some of the places
which do not yet have a georeference. A first
step is to utilise the containment relations be-
tween places and propagate known georeferences
up and down between certain nodes. For exam-
ple, we do this when a parish with no georefer-
ence has the same name as a settlement within
it—since they are different administrative levels
of the same place, we propagate the <geo> from
the settlement to the parish. We aim to provide
an authoritative georeference for every parish and

122



larger settlement in the output, and we have man-
ually built a separate additional resource to supply
missing coordinates for 560 parishes/settlements
in the entire collection that couldn’t be georefer-
enced using either the volume itself or the KEPN
database. While some of these are missing from
the database, many are present but couldn’t be un-
ambiguously matched because of differences in
spelling and punctuation.

At this point there are still many smaller places
which do not have a georeference, so we turn
to external resources, namely OS data provided
through Unlock and the GeoNames gazetteer. We
use the geoparser in a non-standard set-up to look
up place-names in the external gazetteers and to
select the most probable records. To get the re-
sults, we feed the geoparser algorithm with the in-
formation that we already know from the previous
look-up in KEPN/EPNS and we set parameters to
choose records which are as close as possible to
the known coordinates either of the place-name it-
self or of its immediate parent or child node. We
also apply the geoparser not to whole documents
but to individual parishes. This is because the geo-
resolver maximises geographical coherence in its
input by choosing coordinates for all the places
that will minimize the distance between them—if
it is set to work on a single parish, it will auto-
matically tend to select records which are as close
to each other as possible. In our running exam-
ple, Barlow is the first settlement described in the
parish of Brayton and the other major settlements
within the parish are Brayton, Burn, Gateforth,
Hambleton and Thorpe Willoughby. The georeso-
lution algorithm looks at the parish and considers
possible groundings of these places together, en-
suring as far as possible that the chosen gazetteer
records cluster tightly together. If either Unlock or
GeoNames does not have a correct entry for one
of the places but it does have an entry for some-
where else with the same name, that other entry
would be incorrectly chosen. To remedy this sit-
uation, we filter the georesolution output and dis-
card any choices which are further than a certain
distance (3km) away from coordinates assigned by
the earlier KEPN/EPNS step which are known to
be correct. This conservative strategy sometimes
results in correct groundings being thrown away
but it ensures that the Unlock and GeoNames in-
formation that we add is highly likely to be cor-
rect. The output at this stage for Barlow contains
two more <geo> elements in addition to the two
already created:

<geo source="geonames" gazref="geonames:2656317"
lat="53.7499300" long="-1.0216400"/>

<geo source="unlock" gazref="unlock:4580690"
lat="53.74993" long="-1.02164"/>

The georeferencing with Unlock and GeoN-
ames considers smaller places as well. In our
example there are three minor settlements in the
parish, Brayton Barff, Burton Hall and Hambleton
Hough, which get assigned coordinates from the
OS information in Unlock.

4 User access to the processed data

The XML annotated files that are output from the
processing pipeline are an intermediate represen-
tation of the information in the Survey which is
then converted to other formats in order to make
it available to users. Figure 3 summarises how the
data is handled after this point. Since the XML
output preserves the textual content of the input
volumes along with layout, font and style informa-
tion, it can be used to provide HTML renderings of
the text that are visually very similar to the original
printed text. The website at EPNS5 builds on this
aspect of the XML output by providing a browse
and search interface to all the text associated with
a place-name, including both the historical attes-
tation information and the etymological descrip-
tions. Access to this website is restricted to aca-
demic users but it provides an invaluable resource
for place-name scholars since the information can
be searched using the mark-up that we have added
(e.g. by map coordinates; by date or source of at-
testation; by presence of etymological elements or
languages, etc.).

On the geographic side, the XML annotated
files are converted to a structured format which
stores just the historical gazetteer information
from the Survey (the DHG). The textual content
is discarded while the relevant annotations are
transformed into a data structure conforming to
the Library of Congress Metadata Authority De-
scription Schema (MADS)6. Figure 4 shows parts
of the MADS record for Barlow. The modern
name is encoded in the mads/authority/geographic
element, while the historical variants appear in
mads/variant/geographic elements. Geographi-
cal coordinates appear in mads/extension/geo el-
ements and attestations, linked to particular vari-
ants, are also put in the extension element. The
historical forms may be unexpanded shorthands
from the original volumes, e.g. Berlai(a) mean-
ing either Berlai or Berlaia, so these are expanded

out in mads/extension/searchterm elements to as-
sist indexing for search. The MADS format feeds
all the access mechanisms to the DHG—the data is
ingested into the DEEP gazetteer website7 which
allows unrestricted search and browsing access. It
is also converted into Unlock’s gazetteer format in
order that it can be used programmatically via the
Unlock API, adding a new resource for users of
Unlock Places. The Unlock Text service is one
to which users submit documents for geoparsing,
and this has been extended to allow them to do this
using the DHG. The following section briefly de-
scribes how we have adapted the Edinburgh Geop-
arser for this purpose.

5 Geoparser adaptations

The Edinburgh Geoparser in Unlock standardly
georeferences users’ documents with reference to
the Ordnance Survey and/or GeoNames gazetteers
in Unlock. We have reported on this system in To-
bin et al. (2010) and evaluated its performance on
both modern newspaper text and a variety of his-
torical texts. Other researchers have adapted it for
use on different collections of historical text (Isak-
sen et al., 2011). The two main components of the
geoparser are a rule-based NER system for recog-
nising place-names in text and a heuristics-based
georesolver to ground the place-names to coordi-
nates (i.e. to choose between competing gazetteer
records). In order to update the geoparser to use
the historical gazetteer effectively, both of these
components need to be extended. We have made
the necessary adaptations so that Unlock Text can
be used on historical English documents, however
it is hard to create a one-size-fits-all version of the
system which will perform optimally for all users

7http://placenames.org.uk

on all documents—we return to this issue in the
final section.

Like many other rule-based NER systems, the
NER component in the Edinburgh Geoparser re-
lies in part on lexicons of known entities of rele-
vant types and in part on descriptions of possible
contexts for entities encoded as rules. For mod-
ern names the geoparser NER system uses exten-
sive place-name lexicons both for Great Britain
and globally. To deal with historical names, we
converted the MADS-format data into a lexicon
of over 500,000 unique entries derived from the
searchterms and the modern names and we filtered
it to exclude certain lower case forms correspond-
ing to common words. The NER system was given
a parameter to specify ‘historical mode’ and this
causes the DHG-derived lexicon to be applied in-
stead of the modern place-name lexicons. Rules
for place-name contexts apply as usual, as do rules
and lexical look-up for other entity types.

For the georesolution component, the DHG was
added to the list of available gazetteers. Using it
results in a set of records with associated coor-
dinates that need to be disambiguated in order to
ground the place-names. This is sufficient for use
of the DHG in georeferencing but there are some
extra functionalities that suggest themselves in this
context. The first concerns the users’ knowledge
about the geographic focus of their documents: as-
suming they know that the document is about a
particular county or sub-area of England, it is use-
ful to constrain the georeferencing results to ex-
clude out-of-area interpretations. To achieve this
we allow the user to specify one or more of the
DHG counties as a constraint. A second extension
follows from the fact that Unlock returns DHG
records that include date of attestation. We have

adapted the geoparser to allow the user to specify
a date range as a constraint.

Figure 5 shows a screenshot of our development
visualisation tool where we have used the adapted
geoparser to georeference a Dorset Feet of Fines
document from the Internet Archive8. The geop-
arser was run with the county constraint set to
‘Dorset’ in order to exclude any possible matches
from outwith that county. The display shows a
map with purple (darker) pins for the preferred
groundings of the places that were recognised and
could be grounded, and green (lighter) pins for
alternative possible groundings. The scrollable
text pane shows the text with place-name entities
highlighted (ones which are links are those that
have been successfully grounded). The third pane
shows the coordinates for the gazetteer entries that
have been returned. The first (purple) coordinates
are the preferred ones and the remaining (green)
ones are lower ranked alternatives. Note that be-
cause we use only the historical gazetteer and a
Dorset constraint, several of the modern names
are not grounded (e.g. Westminster, Taunton). The
correct Westminster is in the Survey under Mid-

dlesex and therefore not accessed. In the case of
Taunton, there are two instances in the DHG: a
modern name for a minor settlement in Surrey and
a historical form of modern Taynton in Glouces-
tershire. The actual interpretation is likely to be
modern Taunton in Somerset, which is one of the
counties not yet in the Survey. Several of the his-
torical place-names recognised in the text have not
been grounded to a place in Dorset. There are en-
tries in the DHG for some of these, e.g. a Bundebi
in Lincolnshire and a Rading in Berkshire.

6 Discussion

The example in Figure 5 is intended to illustrate
some of the issues that are involved in using the
geoparser on a particular historical text. The user
who wants this particular text georeferenced has a
number of options. Without using any constraint
on the area to be considered, many of the place-
names would be wrongly grounded. The Dorset-
only constraint is probably too conservative and
the user might instead prefer to use a different op-
tion available as standard with the geoparser which
is to specify a bounding box or circle to weight the
entries within them more highly. This option dif-
fers from the Dorset-only constraint, which only
considers DHG entries known to be in Dorset, in

that it considers entries from all of the counties and
influences the rankings of the possible entries. The
user can follow it with a clean-up stage to remove
groundings which fall outside the bounding box
or circle. To get interpretations for place-names
like Westminster and Taunton, the user could sub-
mit the document to a second run of the geoparser
using the modern OS gazetteer and then combine
the results of the two runs. Alternatively, the user
might opt to manually post-edit the output of the
geoparser: a tool would be useful for this so we
are planning to add a map-based georeference an-
notation capability to the geoparser.

The Edinburgh Geoparser is available as a ser-
vice from Unlock Text but there are so many types
of historical document and so many user needs,
that it is unlikely to provide all the possible op-
tions and flexibility that might be required. For
this reason we anticipate that many users will
prefer to access the DHG via Unlock Places for
integration with their own systems; other users
will want access to the source of the geoparser
in order to tailor it for their specific needs. An
open source version will shortly be available from
http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk.

The data described here is not linked data
in the usual sense of the term (i.e. it is not
RDF). However, we have been careful to add
as many linkages as we can. The core data
structure is the MADS data collection (Figure 4)

and this contains two kinds of URI: in the
valueURI attribute on mads/authority/geographic
there is a link to the relevant page on the
EPNS website, while in the valueURI attribute
on mads/recordInfo/recordContentSource there is
a link to the placenames.org.uk site. Three of the
mads/extension/geo elements contain references
to external data sources: the kepnref id points to
the KEPN database and gazref ids point to the rel-
evant records in Unlock and GeoNames. Because
the MADS data collection conforms to a recog-
nised standard, it would be relatively easy to con-
vert it to RDF and publish it as linked data. More-
over, the Unlock version of the DHG retains all
the information in the MADS collection and this
means that the output of the geoparser can be made
to retain the links out from the entries, enabling the
user to link their historical texts to the DHG and to
KEPN, Unlock and GeoNames.
