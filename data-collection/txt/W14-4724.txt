Abstract

The modelling of the semantics of adjectives is notoriously challenging. We consider this prob-
lem in the context of the so called ontology-lexicon interface, which attempts to capture the
semantics of words by reference to an ontology in description logics or some other, typically
first-order, logical formalism. The use of first order logic (hence also description logics), while
effective for nouns and verbs, breaks down in the case of adjectives. We argue that this is primar-
ily due to a lack of logical expressivity in the underlying ontology languages. In particular, be-
yond the straightforward intersective adjectives, there exist gradable adjectives, requiring fuzzy
or non-monotonic semantics, as well as operator adjectives, requiring second-order logic for
modelling. We consider how we can extend the ontology-lexicon interface as realized by extant
models such as lemon in the face of the issues mentioned above, in particular those arising in the
context of modelling the ontological semantics of adjectives. We show how more complex logical
formalisms that are required to capture the ontological semantics of adjectives can be backward
engineered into OWL-based modelling by means of pseudo-classes. We discuss the implications
of this modelling in the context of application to ontology-based question answering.

1 Introduction
Ontology-lexicon models, such as lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies) (McCrae et al., 2012) model
the semantics of open class words by capturing their semantics with respect to the semantic vocabulary
defined in a given ontology. Such ontology-lexica are built around the separation of a lexical layer, de-
scribing how a word or phrase acts syntactically and morphologically, and a semantic layer describing
how the meaning of a word is expressed in a formal logical model, such as OWL (Web Ontology Lan-
guage) (Deborah L. McGuinness and others, 2004). As such, the modelling is based around a lexical
entry which describes the morphology and syntax of a word, and is linked by means of a lexical sense
to an ontology entity defined in a given ontology described in formal logic. It has been shown that this
principle known as semantics by reference (Buitelaar, 2010) is an effective model that can support the
task of developing question answering systems (Unger and Cimiano, 2011) and natural language gen-
eration (Cimiano et al., 2013) over backends based on Semantic Web data models. The Pythia system,
which builds on the lemon formalism to declaratively capture the lexicon-ontology interface, for exam-
ple, has been instantiated to the case of answering questions from DBpedia (Unger and Cimiano, 2011).
However, as has been shown by the Question Answering over Linked Data (Lopez et al., 2013, QALD)
benchmarking campaigns, there are many questions that can be asked over this database that require a
deeper representation of the semantics of words, adjectives in particular. For example, questions such

as (1a) require understanding of the semantics of ‘high’ in a manner that goes beyond the expressivity of
OWL. The formalization of this question as an executable query formulated with respect to the SPARQL
query language is provided in (1b). In particular, the interpretation of this question involves the formal
interpretation of the word ‘high’ as relating to the property dbo:elevation, including ordering and
subset selection operations.

1. (a) What is the highest mountain in Australia?
(b) SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {

?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .
?uri dbo:locatedInArea res:Australia .
?uri dbo:elevation ?elevation .

} ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) LIMIT 1

In the above query, we select an entity denoted by the query variable ?uri that has the properties
that i) the entity’s type is a mountain, ii) it is located in Australia, and iii) it has an elevation bound to
the variable ?elevation. We then sort the query in descending order by the value of the elevation
and limit so the query returns only the first result, in effect choosing the largest value in the data set.
It has been claimed that first-order logic and thus by extension description logics, such as OWL, “fail
decidedly when it comes to adjectives” (Bankston, 2003). In fact, we largely agree that the semantics of
many adjectives are difficult or impossible to describe in first-order logic. However, from the point of
view of the ontology-lexicon interface, the logical expressivity of the ontology is not a limiting factor. In
fact, due to the separation of the lexical and ontology layers in a model such as lemon, it is possible to
express the meaning of words without worrying about the formalism used in the ontology. To this extent,
we will first demonstrate that adjectives are in general a case where the use of description logics (DL)
breaks down, and for which more sophisticated logical formalisms must be applied. We then consider
to what extent this can be handled in the context of the ontology-lexicon, and introduce pseudo-classes,
that is OWL classes with annotations, which we use to express the semantics of adjectives in a manner
that would allow reasoning with fuzzy, high-order models. To this extent, we base our models on the
previously introduced design patterns (McCrae and Unger, 2014) for modelling ontology-lexica. Finally,
we show how these semantics can be helpful in practical applications of question answering over the
DBpedia knowledge base.

2 Classification of adjectives
There are a number of classifications of adjectives. First we will start with the most fundamental dis-
tinction between attributive and predicative usage, that is the use of adjectives in noun phrases (“X is a
A N”) versus as objects of the copula (“X is A”). It should be noted that there are many adjectives for
which only predicative or attributive usage is allowed, as shown in (3a) and (3).

2. (a) Clinton is a former president.
(b) ∗Clinton is former.

3. (a) The baby is awake.
(b) ∗The awake baby.

One of the principle classifications of the semantics of adjectives (for example (Partee, 2003; Bouillon
and Viegas, 1999; Morzycki, 2013b)) is based on the meaning of adjective noun compounds relative to
the meaning of the single words that form the compound. This classification is as follows (where ⇒
denotes entailment).

Intersective (X is a A N ⇒ X is A ∧ X is a N ) Such adjectives work as if they were another noun
and indicate that the compound noun phrase is a member of class denoted by the noun and the class
denoted by the adjective. For example, in the phrase “Belgian violinist” it refers to a person in the
class intersection Belgian ⊓ V iolinist(X), and hence we can infer that a “Belgian violinist” is a
subclass of a “Belgian”. Furthermore, we could conclude that if the same person were a surgeon,
he/she would also be a “Belgian Surgeon”.

199



Subsective (X is a A N ⇒ X is a N , but X is a A N ̸⇒ X is A) Such adjectives acquire their specific
meaning in combination with the noun the modify. For example, a “skilful violinist” is certainly in
the class V iolinist(X) but the described person is ‘skilful as a violinist’, but not skilful in general,
e.g. as a surgeon.

Privative (X is a A N ̸⇒ X is a N ) These adjectives modify the meaning of a noun phrase to create a
noun phrase that is potentially incompatible with the original meaning. For example, a “fake gun”
is not a member of the class of guns.

Another important distinction is whether adjectives are gradable, i.e. whether a comparative or su-
perlative statement with these adjectives makes sense. For example, adjectives such as ‘big’ or ‘tall’ can
express relationships such as ‘X is bigger than Y ’. However it is not possible to say that one individ-
ual is ‘more former’. Most gradable adjectives are subsective (e. g.‘a big mouse’ is not ‘a big animal’
(Morzycki, 2013a)).

Finally, we consider operator or property-modifying adjectives. They can be understood along the
lines of privative adjectives but differ in that they represent operators that modify some property in the
qualia structure (Pustejovsky, 1991) of the class. For instance, we may express the adjective ‘former’ in
lambda calculus as a function that takes a class C as input and returns the class of entities that were a
member of C to some prior time point t (Partee, 2003):

λC[λx∃tC(x, t) ∩ t < now]
Such adjectives have not only a difference in semantic meaning but can also frequently have syntactic

impact, for example in adjective ordering restrictions, as they may be reordered with only semantic
impact (Teodorescu, 2006), e.g.,

4. (a) A big red car.
(b) ?A red big car.

5. (a) A famous former actor.
(b) A former famous actor.

Finally, we define object-relational adjectives as those adjectives which have a meaning that expresses
a relationship between two individuals or events1, for example:

6. He is related to her.
7. She is similar to her brother.
8. This is useful for something.

3 Representation of adjectives in the ontology-lexicon interface
In general it is assumed that adjectives form frames with exactly one argument except for extra arguments
provided by adjuncts, typically prepositional phrases. Most adjectives are thus associated with a pred-
icative frame, which much like the standard noun predicate frame (X is a N ) is stereotyped in English
as:

X is A
The attributive usage of an adjective is associate to a stereotypical frame where the N? argument is

not semantically bound, but can instead be obtained by syntactic unification to a noun predicate frame:
X is A N?

As such, when we encounter the attributive usage of an adjective such as in 9, we understand this as
the realization of two frames, given in 10.

9. Juan is a Spanish researcher.
10. (a) Juan is a researcher.

(b) Juan is a Spanish N?
Note that we do not provide modelling for adjectives where the meaning is unique for a particular

noun phrase, such as ‘polar bear’, which we would capture as a normal noun phrase with meaning ursus
maritimus.
1Our definition of relational here is borrowed from the idea of relational nouns (De Bruin and Scha, 1988) as a word that requires
an argument. Our definition is also different from the one for ‘relational adjectives’ as proposed by (Morzycki, 2013a).

Figure 1: Modelling of an intersective adjective ‘Belgian’ in lemon

3.1 Intersective adjectives

Intersective adjectives are the most straightforward class, as in many cases they can be modelled es-
sentially as a noun or verb (e.g. deverbal adjectives such as ‘broken’). Intersective adjectives take one
argument and can thus be modelled as unary predicates in first-order logic or classes in OWL, as de-
scribed by McCrae and Unger (2014). For practical modelling examples, we will use the lemon model,
since it is the most prominent implementation of the ontology-lexicon interface.

The primary mechanism of modelling the syntax-semantics interface in the context of lemon is by
means of assigning a frame as a syntactic behaviour of an entry and giving it syntactic arguments, which
can then be linked to the lexical sense, which stands proxy for a true semantic frame in the ontology. For
example, the modelling of an adjective such as ‘Belgian’ can be achieved as follows (depicted in Figure
1)2.
lexicon:belgian a lemon:LexicalEntry ;

lemon:canonicalForm belgian:Lemma ;
lemon:synBehavior belgian:AttrFrame ,

belgian:PredFrame ;
lemon:sense belgian:Sense .

belgian:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "Belgian"@eng .

belgian:AttrFrame lexinfo:attributiveArg belgian:AttrSynArg .
belgian:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg belgian:PredSynArg .

belgian:sense lemon:reference [ a owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty dbpedia:nationality ;
owl:hasValue dbpedia:Belgium ] ;

lemon:isA belgian:AttrSynArg , belgian:PredSynArg .

In this example, the word ‘Belgian’ is associated with a lemma with representation ‘Belgian’, two
frame objects and a lexical sense. The frame objects describe the attributive and predicative usage,
and are associated with an attributive and copulative argument respectively. The sense links the word
to the anonymous ontological class for objects that have ‘Belgium’ as the value of their ‘national-
ity’ property and furthermore the arguments of each frame are linked to the sense in order to estab-
lish a correspondence between the ontology class and the syntactic frames. Note that here we use
the external vocabulary defined in the LexInfo ontology (Cimiano et al., 2011) to define the mean-
ing of the arguments of the frame as the attributive argument, corresponding to the frame stereo-
type ‘X is A N?’ and the copulative argument for the frame stereotype ‘X is A’. Furthermore, the
2We assume that the namespaces are defined for the lexicon as lexicon, e.g., http://www.example.org/lexicon
and for the entry, e.g., belgian is http://www.example.org/lexicon/belgian#. Other namespaces are as-
sumed to be as usual.

class of Belgians is not named in our reference ontology DBpedia, so we introduce an anonymous
class with the axiomatization, i.e. ∃ nationality . Belgium. It is in fact common that the referent of
an adjective is not named in an ontology. An obvious choice is thus to model denominal adjec-
tives as classes of the form ∃ prop.Value, where Value is an individual that represents the seman-
tics of the noun from which the adjective was derived. This modelling is so common that it has al-
ready been encoded as two design patterns, called IntersectiveObjectPropertyAdjective
and IntersectiveDatatypePropertyAdjective (see (McCrae and Unger, 2014)). Simi-
larly, most deverbal adjectives refer to an event, and as such a common modelling is of the form
∃ theme−1. EventClass. For example, ‘vandalized’ may be ∃ theme−1.VandalismEvent.
3.2 Gradable adjectives and relevant observables

Gradable adjectives have a number of properties which differentiate them from intersective adjectives:

• They occur in comparative constructions, in English with either ‘-er’ or ‘more’ (Kennedy and Mc-
Nally, 1999), e.g. ‘smaller’ and ‘more frequent’, as opposed to intersectives such as ‘*less geologi-
cal’ and ‘*more wooden’.

• Gradable adjectives can be defined as ‘scalar’, since their value can ideally be measured on a scale
of set degrees

• They have a context-dependent truth-conditional variability, meaning that their positive form is un-
derstood in relation to the class of the object modified by the adjective. For example, an ‘expensive
watch’ has a different price scale to an ‘expensive bottle of water’.

• They are frequently fuzzy (or vague) (Kennedy, 2007).
• There may be a minimum or maximum of the adjective’s scale, which can be determined by, for

example, whether they can modified by adverbs such as ‘completely’ or ‘utterly’.

As such, we define gradable adjectives relative to a particular property. These adjectives are also
called ‘observable’ (Bennett, 2006)3 as they are related to some observable or measurable property, e.g.
size in the case of ‘big’. However, a specification of the observable property is clearly not sufficient to
differentiate between the meaning of antonyms such as big and small. Thus, we introduce the notions of
covariance and contravariance, which specify whether the comparative form indicates a higher property
value for the subject or the object. In this sense ‘big’ is covariant with size, as bigger things have a
higher size value, and ‘small’ is contravariant with size.4 We also introduce a third concept, i.e. the one
of absolute gradability, which expresses the fact that the degree of membership in the denotation of the
adjective is stronger the more it approaches a prototypical or ideal value. A common example of this is
colours, where we may say that some object is redder than another if it is closer to some ideal value of
red (e.g., RGB 0xff0000).

While these notions can handle the comparative structure of the semantics of adjectives, the predicative
and superlative usage of adjectives is complicated by three factors that we will outline below. We notice
that gradable classes are not crisply defined like in the case of many intersective adjectives. In fact, while
we can clearly define all people in the world as ‘Belgian’ or ‘not Belgian’, according to whom holds
a Belgian passport or not, it is not easy to split the world’s population into ‘tall’ and ‘not tall’ (This is
known as sorites paradox (Bennett, 2006)). Furthermore, while it may be easy to say that someone with
height 6’6” (198cm) is ‘tall’, it is not clear whether someone with height 6’ (182cm) is ‘tall’, although
compared to an average (different) height for a man, they are ‘taller’. As such, one frequently used way
to deal with this class of vague adjectives (and nouns) is via fuzzy logic (Goguen, 1969; Zadeh, 1975;
Zadeh, 1965; Dubois and Prade, 1988; Bennett, 2006). Secondly, we notice that these class boundaries
are non-monotonic, that is that with knowledge of more instances of the relative class we must revise
our class boundaries. This is especially the case for superlatives, as the discovery of a new tallest person
3Note that in many cases the property is quite abstract such as in ‘breakable’.
4The use of these terms is borrowed from type systems, and resembles the concept of ‘converse observables’ as introduced by
((Bennett, 2006):42). As stated by the author, adjectives often come in pairs of polar opposites (e. g. conv(tall) = short, and
both refer to the same observable (in this case size). Some observables analogously hold converse relationships with other
observables (e. g. conv(flexibility) = rigidity or conv(tallness) = shortness).

202



in the world would remove the existing tallest person in the world from the class of tallest person in the
world. This non-monotonicity also affects the class boundaries of the gradable class itself. For example,
in the 18th century, the average height of a male was 5’5” (165cm)5; as such a male of 6’ would have
clearly been considered tall.

It follows from this that each instance added to our ontology might lead to a revision of the class
boundaries of a gradable class, hence leading to the fact that gradable adjectives are fundamentally non-
monotonic. We must also notice that gradability can only be understood relative to the class that we wish
to grade. Thus, while it is a priori unclear whether 6’ is tall for a male, it is clear that 6’ is tall for a
female given the current average height of a female being about 5’4” (162cm).

We can therefore conclude that gradable adjectives are fuzzy, non-monotonic and context-sensitive, all
of which are incompatible with the description logic used in OWL.

Pseudo-classes in lemonOILS

Currently there are only limited models for representing fuzzy logic in the context of the Web (Zhao and
Boley, 2008). In order to capture the properties of gradable adjectives, we introduce a new model which
we name lemonOILS (The lemon Ontology for the Interpretation of Lexical Semantics)6. This ontology
introduces three new classes:

• CovariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is covariant with its bound property
• ContravariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is contravariant with its bound property
• AbsoluteScalar, indicating that the property represents similarity to an absolute value

In addition, the following properties are introduced to enable the description of gradable adjectives.
Note that all these properties are typed as annotation properties in the OWL ontology, so that they do
not interfere with the standard OWL reasoning.

• boundTo indicates the property that a scalar refers to (e.g., ‘size’ for ‘big’)
• threshold specifies a sensible minimal value for which the adjective can be said to hold
• absoluteValue is the ideal value of an absolute scalar
• degree is specified as weak, medium, strong or very strong, corresponding to approxi-

mately 50%, 25%, 5% or 1% of all known individuals
• comparator indicates an object property that is equivalent to the comparison of the adjective

(e.g., an object property biggerThan may be considered a comparator for the adjective class
big)

• measure indicates a unit that can be used as a measure for this adjective, e.g., ‘John is 175 cen-
timetres tall’.

Using such classes we can capture the semantics of gradable adjectives syntactically but not formally
within an OWL model. As such, we call these introduced classes pseudo-classes. An example of mod-
elling an adjective such as ‘high’ is given below (and depicted in Figure 2).

Figure 2: An example of the modelling of ‘high’ in lemon

As an example of a logic in which these annotations could be interpreted, we consider Markov
Logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), which is an extension of first-order logic in which each clause
is given a cost. The process of reasoning is thus transformed into an optimization problem of finding
the extension which minimizes the summed weight of all violated clauses. As such, we can formulate
a gradable adjective based on the number of known instances. For example, we can specify ‘big’ with
respect to size for some class C as in (11).

11. ∀x ∈ C, y ∈ C : size(x) > size(y) → bigC(x) : α
∀x ∈ C, y ∈ C : size(x) < size(y) → ¬bigC(x) : β

In this way, the classification of an object into ‘big’ or ‘small’ can be defined as follows. For an individual
x ∈ C, the property bigC(x) holds if and only if:

|{y ∈ C, size(y) > size(x)}|α < |{y ∈ C, size(y) < size(x)}|β
where the values of α and β are related to the degree defined in the ontology.
We see that ‘big’ defined in this way has the three properties outlined above: it is non-monotonic (in

that more individuals may change whether we consider an individual to be ‘big’ or not), it is fuzzy (given
by the strength of the probability of the proposition bigC(x)), and it is context-sensitive (as whether an
individual counts as big or not depends on the class C). Furthermore, our definition does not rely on
defining ‘big’ for a given class, but instead is inferred from some known number of instances of this
class. This eliminates the need to define a threshold for each individual class, or even to define the
predicate bigC on a per-class basis.

The supervaluation theory and SUMO

Another way to capture the meaning of these vague terms can be achieved by supervaluation semantics.
Through supervaluation theory, the modelling or positioning of sorites vague concepts is grounded in a
judgement or meaning that lies on arbitrary thresholds, but these thresholds are based on a number of
relevant objective measures (Bennett, 2006).

A recent extension of the SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001, Suggested Upper Merged On-
tology)7 includes default measurements (currently amounting to 300+) added to the Artifacts,
Devices and Objects enlisted in the ontology (and marked with capitals). The compilation of
defaultMeasurements in SUMO has been just conducted on observables, not on predicates. Given
for instance an Artifact such as Book, the compilation of its default measurements would look like:
;;Book
(defaultMinimumHeight Book (MeasureFn 10 Inch))
(defaultMaximumHeight Book (MeasureFn 11 Inch))
(defaultMinimumLength Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))
(defaultMaximumLength Book (MeasureFn 7 Inch))
(defaultMinimumWidth Book (MeasureFn 1.2 Inch))
(defaultMaximumWidth Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))

7www.ontologyportal.org

204



The example for Book shows that the default measurements for the observable reflect a standard kind
of book, i.e., one of the most commonly known kinds of the same artifact. As for this case, SUMO
implies Book to be a physical object with a certain length, height and width (and possibly weight). A
weakness here is that the there is no systematic connection between the defaultMinimumHeight
and Height or Width, since these physical properties have been defined in SUMO just in terms of
first-order logic, and have not been assigned default measurements yet. With lemonOILS we can add this
information as follows:
sumo:Book oils:default [

oils:defaultFor sumo:height ;
oils:defaultMin "10in" ;
oils:defaultMax "11in" ] .

Then, if we understand a lexical entry ‘high’ as referring to a scalar covariant pseudo-class for
sumo:height, it is possible to understand that a ‘high’ object exceeds the default minimum set es-
tablished for the same object and owns at the same time a value for ‘high’ which does not go beyond the
established default maximum. A further weakness of this approach is captured by the following example:

12. Avery Johnson is a short basketball player.

Here, we see the difficulty in interpreting the sentence, as Avery Johnson is in fact of average height
(5’10”) but for the class of basketball players he is unusually short. While SUMO has some very specific
listings of subsets for the same Artifact8, SUMO does not provide a well-structured subset net for
e. g. Person.As a way to address this bottleneck, we could introduce default values for every subclass
of Person, as well as to introduce default values for the same Artifact in conjunction with a predicate
or adjective (e. g. BigPerson, BulkyPerson). The creation of such ad hoc subclasses is not feasible
in general, as we would have to introduce a new class into the ontology for every combination of an
adjective and a noun. On the other side though, the SUMO default measurements serve the purpose
they were originally conceived for, namely to be an arbitrary, yet computable approximation of physical
measures.

3.3 Operator adjectives

Operator adjectives are those that combine with a noun to modify the meaning of the noun itself. There
are two primary issues with the understanding of the adjective in this manner. Firstly, the reference
of the lexical item does not generally refer to an existing item in the ontology, but rather is novel and
productive, in the sense that it generates a new class. Secondly, the compositional nature of adjective-
noun compounds is no longer simple, as in the cases of intersective and gradable adjectives. This means
that, in order to understand a concept such as a ‘fake gun’, we must first derive a class of FakeGuns
from the class of Guns. Thus the modified noun phrase must be an argument of the operator adjective.

To this extent we claim that it is not generally possibly to represent the meaning of an operator adjective
within the context of an OWL ontology. Instead, following Bankston (Bankston, 2003), we claim that the
reference of an operator adjective must be a higher order predicate. If we assume that there are operators
of the form of a function, then the argument of an operator is the attributed noun phrase. As such, we
introduce a frame operator attributive, that has one argument which is the noun. Thus we understand
that the interpretation of ‘fake gun’ is by means of an operator fake, which is a function that takes
a class and produces a new class, i.e., [fake(Gun)](X). Capturing such an operator lies beyond the
expressivity of first-order logic. To fully capture the semantics of such an operator adjective, formalisms
beyond first-order logic are thus clearly needed.

3.4 Object-relational adjectives

Object-relational adjectives are those that require a second argument, such as ‘known’, which can only
be understood as being ‘known’ to some person, in comparison to ‘famous’. Thus, the modelling of the
relational adjective known is quite similar to the semantics of the corresponding verb know. It can be
modelled for instance via the frame ‘X is known to Y ’ and reference foaf:knows as:
8For example, some of the subsets Car are: CrewDormCar, GalleryCar, MotorRailcar, FreightCar, BoxCar,
RefrigeratorCar, FiveWellStackCar, and more.

4 Adjectives in question answering
In this section we empirically analyze the adequacy of the modelling proposed in this paper with respect
to the QALD-49 dataset, a shared dataset for Question Answering over Linked Data. The 250 training
and test questions of the QALD-4 benchmark contain 76 adjectives in total (not counting adjectives in
names such as ‘Mean Hamster Software’).

18 of the occurring adjectives do not have a semantic contribution w.r.t. the underlying DBpedia
ontology, or at least none that is separable from the noun, as exemplified in the noun phrases in (13) and
(14).10

13. (a) [[official website]] = dbo:website
(b) [[national anthem]] = dbo:anthem

14. (a) [[official languages]] = dbo:officialLanguages
(b) [[military conflicts]] = dbo:battle

Otherwise, the most common kinds of adjectives among them are gradable (27) and intersective (13)
adjectives.

All intersective adjectives denote restriction classes that are not explicitely named in DBpedia, in
correspondence with the modelling proposed in Section 3.1 above, for example:

15. (a) [[Danish]] = ∃dbo:country .res:Denmark
(b) [[female]] = ∃dbo:gender .res:Female
(c) [[Methodist]] = ∃dbo:religion .res:Methodism

In some cases these intersectives have a context-dependent and highly ontology-specific meaning,
often tightly interwoven with the meaning of the noun, as in the following examples:

16. (a) [[first president of the United States]] = ∃dbo:office . ‘1st President of the United States’
(b) [[first season]] = ∃dbo:seasonNumber . 1

All gradable adjectives that occur in the QALD-4 question set can be captured in terms of lemonOILS
as CovariantScalar (e.g. ‘high’) or ContravariantScalar (e.g. ‘young’) (cf. Section 3.2
above), bound to a DBpedia datatype property (e.g. elevation or birthDate). The positive form
of those adjectives only occurs in ‘how (much)’ questions, denoting the property they are bound to, for
example:

17. (a) [[deep]] = dbo:depth in ‘How deep is Lake Placid?’
(b) [[tall]] = dbo:height in ‘How tall is Michael Jordan?’

9http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/qald/
10[[·]] stands for ‘denotes’ and the prefixes dbo and res abbreviate the DBpedia namespaces

The comparative form denotes the property they are bound to, together with an aggregation operation,
usually a filter invoking a term of comparison that depends on whether the adjective is covariant or
contravariant.

18. (a) [[Which mountains are higher than the Nanga Parbat?]] =
SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {
res:Nanga_Parbat dbo:elevation ?x .
?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .
?uri dbo:elevation ?y .
FILTER (?y > ?x)

}

Finally, the superlative form denotes the property they are bound to, together with an aggregation
operation, usually an ordering with a cut-off of all results except the first one, as exemplified in (19). In
some cases, the superlative property is already encoded in the ontology, e.g., in the case of the property
dbo:highestPlace.

19. [[What is the longest river?]] =

SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {
?uri rdf:type dbo:River .
?uri dbo:length ?l .

} ORDER BY DESC(?l) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1

There are three instances of operator adjectives. Examples are ‘former’, as in 20, which does not
refer to an element in the DBpedia ontology but is instead a disambiguation clue in the given query, and
‘professional’, which refers to the property dbo:occupation, see 21.

20. [[the former Dutch queen Juliana]] = res:Juliana
21. [[professional surfer]] = ∃dbo:occupation .res:Surfing

Finally, there were 8 remaining adjectives totalling 15 occurrences, which do not correspond to mean-
ing in an ontology, but instead are part of the discourse structure, each ‘same’, ‘other’.

5 Related work
The categorization of adjectives in terms of formal semantics goes back to Montague (1970) and
Vendler (1968). However, one of the most significant attempts to assign a formal meaning was car-
ried out in the Mikrokosmos project (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995). The approach to adjective modelling
in the Mikrokosmos provided one of the first computational implementations of a microtheory of adjec-
tive meaning. The modelling of adjectives presented in this paper is clearly inspired by the modelling
of adjectives adopted in the Mikrokosmos project. In particular, scalar adjectives in the Microkosmos
project are modeled by association with an attribute and a range, e.g., ‘big’ is described as being >0.75
(i.e., 75% of all known instances) on the size-attribute. Still, these classifications do not clearly
separate meaning and syntax and also require a separate modelling of comparatives and class-specific
meanings for many adjectives.

Amoia and Gardent (2006) handled the problem of adjectives in the context of textual entailment. They
analyzed 15 classes that show the subtle interaction between the semantic class (e.g., ‘privative’) and the
issues of attributive/predicative use and gradability. Abdullah and Frost (2005) focused on the modelling
of privative adjectives by arguing that these adjectives modify the underlying set itself in a manner that
is naturally second-order. Similarly, Partee (2003) proposed a limited second-order model by means of
the ‘head primary principle’ requiring that adjectives are interpreted within their context. Bankston’s
analysis (2003), however, shows that the fundamental nature of many adjectives is higher-order, and pro-
vides a very sophisticated formal representation framework for adjectives. A more thorough discussion
of non-gradable, non-intersective adjectives is given by Morzycki (2013a). Bouillion and Viegas (1999)
consider the case of the French adjective ‘vieux’ (‘old’), which they interprete as selecting two differ-
ent elements in the event structure of an attributed noun, that is whether the state, e.g., ‘being a mayor’
for ‘mayor’, is considered old or the individual itself. In this way, the introduction of two senses for
‘vieux’ is avoided, however it remains unclear if such reasoning introduces more complexity than the

207



extra senses. In his analysis of adjectives, Larson (1998) suggests that many adjectives denote properties
of events, rather than of simple heads or nouns (which does not fall very far from the statement, made
above, that relational adjectives denote properties of kinds). Pustejovsky (1992; 1991) and Lenci (2000)
state that lexical and semantic decomposition can be achieved generatively, assigning to each lexical item
a specific qualia structure. For instance, in an expression like:
22. The round, heavy, wooden, inlaid magnifying glass

• ‘round’ represents the Formal role (giving indications of shape and dimensionality)
• ‘heavy’ and ‘wooden’ related to the Constitutive role and indicate the relation between the

object and its parts (e. g. by specifying weight, material, parts and components)
• ‘inlaid’ is the Agentive role of the lexical item, denoting the factors that have been involved in

the generation of the objects, such as creator, artifact, natural kind, and causal chain
• ‘magnifying’ describes the Telic role of ‘glass’, since it shows its purpose and function

Finally, Peters and Peters (2000) provide one of the few other practical reports on modelling adjectives
with ontologies, in the context of the SIMPLE lexica. This work is primarily focussed on the categoriza-
tion of by means of intensional and extensional properties, rather than due to their logical modelling.

6 Conclusion
In this paper we have proposed an approach to model the semantics of adjectives in the context of the
lexicon-ontology interface with a focus on the ontology-lexicon model lemon. We have argued that the
semantics of adjectives, in particular gradable and privative adjectives, is beyond what can be expressed
in first-order logics, OWL in particular. Instead, capturing the semantics of such adjectives requires
formalisms that are non-monotonic, second-order and can represent fuzzy concepts. We have proposed
an extension of lemon by the lemonOILS vocabulary that adds ‘syntactic sugar’ that allows us to represent
the semantics of adjectives in a way that abstracts from the actual representational formalism used. This
work has been used in the construction of lexical resources to support a question answering system,
and we found that this framework is sufficient to enable tractable computation of natural language to
SPARQL mapping over at least a small but varied set of test questions used in the QALD evaluation
task. Future work will show whether this model is scalable and applicable to most adjectives as well as
domains and natural languages.
