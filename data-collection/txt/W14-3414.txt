Abstract

The MIMIC II database contains
1,237,686 clinical documents of vari-
ous kinds. A common task for researchers
working with this database is to run
MetaMap, which uses the UMLS
Metathesaurus, on those documents
to identify specific semantic types of
entities mentioned in them. However,
this task is computationally expensive
and time-consuming. Research in many
groups could be accelerated if there were
a community-accessible set of outputs
from running MetaMap on this document
collection, cached and available on the
MIMIC-II website. This paper describes a
repository of all MetaMap output from the
MIMIC II database, publicly available,
assuming compliance with usage agree-
ments required by UMLS and MIMIC-II.
Additionally, software for manipulating
MetaMap output, available on Source-
Forge with a liberal Open Source license,
is described.

1 Introduction

1.1 The MIMIC II database and its textual
contents

The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in In-
tensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database is a public-
access intensive care unit database that contains
a broad array of information for over 33,000 pa-
tients. The data were collected over a 7 year pe-
riod, beginning in 2001 from Boston’s Beth Is-
rael Deaconess Medical Center (Saeed et al, 2011;
Goldberger et al., 2000).

Of particular interest are the 1,237,686 clini-
cal documents, which are broadly classified into
the following four groups: MD notes, discharge
summaries, radiology reports and nursing/other.

Each free-text note contains information describ-
ing such things as a given patient’s health, ill-
nesses, treatments and medications, among others.

1.2 Motivation for the resource: MetaMap
runtimes

Part of the motivation for making this resource
publicly available is that considerable resources
must be expended to process it; if multiple groups
can share the output of one processing run, the sav-
ings across the community as a whole could be
quite large. To illustrate why this would be valu-
able from a resources perspective, we provide here
some statistics on the performance of MetaMap.

Random samples of each category (10% each)
were chosen and Monte Carlo simulation was per-
formed (1,000 iterations per note) to obtain the
running times presented below. The clinical notes
ranged from a minimum of 0 words to a maximum
of 6,684 (some of the notes were 0 bytes because
the note for a particular patient and day contained
no text). The mean, median and mode per doc-
ument processed by MetaMap were 17, 5 and 2
seconds, respectively, with a minimum of 1 and a
maximum of 216 seconds.

Figure 1 below plots the number of words
against processing times in seconds for each of the
of notes, sampled as mentioned above.

The majority of the processing was done on a
Sun Fire X4600M2 server with 16 (4 x Quad-
Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 8356 cores,
2.3GHz), 128GB memory and 12 TB of disk stor-
age, currently running Fedora Core 17 Linux.
(An Apple MacBook Pro and a Windows desktop
server were also used to speed processing. The
analysis of the random sample of notes was per-
formed in its entirety on the Sun machine, thereby
providing consistent results for the data in Figure
1.)

1.3 Motivation for the resource:
reproducibility

Any large-scale run of MetaMap over a huge doc-
ument collection will have occasional failures, etc.
The odds of any two runs having the same out-
put are therefore slim. Moreover, there is po-
tential variability in how documents are prepro-
cessed for use with MetaMap. Using this reposi-
tory of MetaMap outputs will ensure reproducibil-
ity of experiments and also preclude the neces-
sity of performing the same preparatory work and
MetaMap processing on the same data.

1.4 Motivation for the resource: semantic
types

The creation of the MIMIC-II repository is an in-
termediate step in our research. We are extracting
the semantic types found in each clinical note in
an attempt to determine if there exists evidence of
subdomains across the categories used by MIMIC-
II to group the notes.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Materials

MetaMap is a program developed at the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) that maps biomedical
concepts to the UMLS Metathesaurus and reports
on the corresponding semantic types.1 The pro-
gram is used extensively by researchers in the field
of biomedical text mining. See Aronson, 2001;
Aronson and Lang, 2010.

1Users of MetaMap must comply with the UMLS
Metathesaurus license agreement (https://uts.nlm.
nih.gov/license.html).

Although our focus is on the clinical notes con-
tained in a single table, noteevents, MIMIC-II is
both a relational database (PostgreSQL 9.1.9) con-
taining 39 tables of clinical data and bedside mon-
itor waveforms and the associated derived param-
eters and events stored in flat binary files (with
ASCII header descriptors). For each Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) patient, Saeed et al. (2011) col-
lected a wide range of data including inter alia
laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles,
MD and nursing progress notes, discharge sum-
maries, radiology reports, International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a
subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends
and waveforms. All data were scrubbed for per-
sonal information to ensure compliance with the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA). These data were then uploaded to a
relational database thereby allowing for easy ac-
cess to extensive information for each patient’s
stay in the ICU (Saeed et al.). A more detailed
description of the use of the MIMIC-II database
may be found in(Clifford et al. , 2012).

The abbreviated schema in Table 1 below shows
that each ID uniquely identifies a note along with a
SubjectID, a Category and Text.2 We added the ID
attribute to noteevents as a primary key because
SubjectID, Category and Text are not keys. Thus,
a particular patient might have many notes and
many categories but each note is uniquely iden-
tified.

Attribute Type Cardinality Sample Values
ID integer unique 1, 2, 3, 4...

SubjectID integer many to one ID 95, 100, 100, 99,
Category character varying(26) many to one ID radiology

Text text many to one ID interval placement of ICD

Table 1: Schema MIMIC-II noteevents table.

As mentioned above, the notes in the MIMIC-II
database are categorized as MD reports, radiology
reports, discharge summaries and nursing/other
reports. The contents of these notes varied greatly.
The MD and nursing notes tended to be short and
unstructured with a number of abbreviations and
misspellings, whereas the radiology reports were
longer, more structured and showed fewer errors.

The MIMIC-II version used for this research is
2.6 (April 2011; 32,536 subjects).

The distribution of reports with summary statis-
tics is below in Table 2.

2The full noteevents table has ten other attributes such as
admission date, various timestamps and patient information
but these were not relevant to our research.

2.2 Methods

We used MetaMap to process the clinical notes in
order to find semantic concepts, the latter of which
are being used in our current research. For the
work in this paper, we used MetaMap 2013 with
the 2013AB database.

Before processing the notes with MetaMap,
a number of preparatory steps were taken. As
mentioned above, a primary key was added to
the noteevents table to provide a unique id for
each note. A Python script then queried the
database extracting each note and storing it in a
file named according to the following convention:
uniqueID subjectID category.txt where uniqueID
is the primary key value from the noteevents ta-
ble, subjectID is the unique number assigned to
each patient and category is one of the four cate-
gories mentioned above.

Each of the notes was then processed by a Bash
shell script to remove blank lines and control char-
acters. (This important step was added after a sig-
nificant amount of processing had already taken
place. If this is not done, a number of prob-
lems arise when running MetaMap). Finally, all
files with 0 bytes were removed. These files were
present because many tuples in the noteevents ta-
ble contained clinical note entries with no data.

The number of options available when running
MetaMap is considerable so we chose those that
would provide a full and robust result set which
would be useful to a wide range of researchers. In
our first run, we limited the threshold for the Can-
didate Score to 1,000. However, for the repository,
no threshold was set so that a full range of output
is provided. 3

The output is in XML in order to structure the
data systematically and provide an easier and con-
sistent way to parse the data. Although we chose
XML initially, we intend to provide the same data
in plain text and Prolog formats, again to provide
utility to a broad range of researchers.

In order to process all files, a Bash shell script

3The exact MetaMap command we used was
metamap13 –XMLf –silent –blanklines 3 filename.txt

was created that called MetaMap on each note and
created a corresponding XML file, named accord-
ing to the same convention as that for notes but
with the txt extension replaced by xml.

3 Results

3.1 The repository of MetaMap output

The repository for the MetaMap output contains
an XML file for each note that originally contained
text in the MIMIC-II database. Each XML file
contains a wealth of information about each note
and a discussion of this is beyond the scope of
this paper (see http://metamap.nlm.nih.
gov/Docs/MM12_XML_Info.shtml).

For our research, we are interested in the se-
mantic types associated with phrases identified by
MetaMap. Below is a section from output file
768591 19458 discharge.xml. This is a discharge
summary for subject 19458 with a unique note id
of 768591. The note contained the phrase “Admis-
sion Date” which MetaMap matched with a candi-
date score of 1000 and indicated that it is a tempo-
ral concept (tmco).

Ultimately, the MetaMap output files will be up-
loaded to the PhysioNet website and made avail-
able to the public.4 The files will be organized in
a fashion similar to the original data files on the
site. Namely, data are grouped by subject ids and
compressed in archives with approximately 1000
files each.

<Candidate>
<CandidateScore>-1000</CandidateScore>
<CandidateCUI>C1302393</CandidateCUI>
<CandidateMatched>Admission date

</CandidateMatched>
<CandidatePreferred>Date of admission

</CandidatePreferred>
<MatchedWords Count="2">
<MatchedWord>admission</MatchedWord>
<MatchedWord>date</MatchedWord>
</MatchedWords>
<SemTypes Count="1">
<SemType>tmco</SemType>
</SemTypes>

The original note contained 975 lines, whereas
the MetaMap xml file contained 248,198. Thus
it is obvious that there is a very large amount of
MetaMap output that we don’t consider but which
may be of interest to other researchers.

4Subject again to the data usage agreement.

3.2 A Python module for manipulating
MetaMap output

In order to make information in the XML files ac-
cessible to others, we developed a Python module
(parseMM xml.py) containing a number of meth-
ods or functions that allow one to parse the XML
tree and extract relevant information.

Although we will add more functionality as
needed and requested, at this point the following
methods are implemented:

• parseXMLtree(filename) – parses the con-
tents of filename and returns a node repre-
senting the top of the document tree.

• getXMLsummary(XMLtree) – summarizes
the data contained in the parsed XML tree.
The summary contains top-level elements
and their corresponding text. The output is
much like that contained in typical MetaMap
text output.

• getCUIs(XMLtree) – returns the MetaMap
CUIs found in the XML tree along with the
matching concepts.

• getNegatedConcepts(XMLtree) – returns
negated concepts and their corresponding
CUIs.

• getSemanticTypes(XMLtree) – returns
matched concepts, their CUIs, the candidate
scores and the semantic types associated
with the concept.

• findAttribute(attribute) – searches the docu-
ment tree for an attribute of the user’s choos-
ing. Returns the attributes with their corre-
sponding text values.

We chose Python to create our module be-
cause of its ease of use and its multi-platform
capabilities. Once Python is installed and the
parseMM xml.py is placed in a directory along
with the MetaMap xml file which is to be ana-
lyzed, retrieving relevant information is relatively
straightforward. 5

5Under most circumstances, Python is already installed
on the Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

A stylized version of our code is presented be-
low.

# Parse XML tree and return semantic
types.

import parseMM_xml
xml_tree = \
parseXMLtree("noteid_subid_category.xml")
semTypes = getSemanticTypes(xml_tree)

print(semTypes)

A truncated listing of the output:

CandidateCUI – C0011008
CandidateMatched – Date
1 – SemType – Temporal Concept
CandidateCUI – C2348077
CandidateMatched – Date
2 – SemType – Food

In order to fully test the robustness of our mod-
ule, we will do further unit and regression testing,
in addition to providing more exception handling.
Ultimately, the code will be available on Source-
Forge, an Open Source web source code repository
available at www.sourceforge.net.
