Abstract

We propose a simple neural architecture for nat-
ural language inference. Our approach uses at-
tention to decompose the problem into subprob-
lems that can be solved separately, thus making
it trivially parallelizable. On the Stanford Natu-
ral Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, we ob-
tain state-of-the-art results with almost an order
of magnitude fewer parameters than previous
work and without relying on any word-order in-
formation. Adding intra-sentence attention that
takes a minimum amount of order into account
yields further improvements.

1 Introduction
Natural language inference (NLI) refers to the prob-
lem of determining entailment and contradiction re-
lationships between a premise and a hypothesis. NLI
is a central problem in language understanding (Katz,
1972; Bos and Markert, 2005; van Benthem, 2008;
MacCartney and Manning, 2009) and recently the
large SNLI corpus of 570K sentence pairs was cre-
ated for this task (Bowman et al., 2015). We present
a new model for NLI and leverage this corpus for
comparison with prior work.

A large body of work based on neural networks
for text similarity tasks including NLI has been pub-
lished in recent years (Hu et al., 2014; Rocktäschel
et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Yin et al., 2016,
inter alia). The dominating trend in these models is
to build complex, deep text representation models,
for example, with convolutional networks (LeCun et
al., 1990, CNNs henceforth) or long short-term mem-
ory networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997,

LSTMs henceforth) with the goal of deeper sen-
tence comprehension. While these approaches have
yielded impressive results, they are often computa-
tionally very expensive, and result in models having
millions of parameters (excluding embeddings).

Here, we take a different approach, arguing that
for natural language inference it can often suffice to
simply align bits of local text substructure and then
aggregate this information. For example, consider
the following sentences:

• Bob is in his room, but because of the thunder
and lightning outside, he cannot sleep.

• Bob is awake.
• It is sunny outside.

The first sentence is complex in structure and it
is challenging to construct a compact representation
that expresses its entire meaning. However, it is fairly
easy to conclude that the second sentence follows
from the first one, by simply aligning Bob with Bob
and cannot sleep with awake and recognizing that
these are synonyms. Similarly, one can conclude
that It is sunny outside contradicts the first sentence,
by aligning thunder and lightning with sunny and
recognizing that these are most likely incompatible.

We leverage this intuition to build a simpler and
more lightweight approach to NLI within a neural
framework; with considerably fewer parameters, our
model outperforms more complex existing neural ar-
chitectures. In contrast to existing approaches, our
approach only relies on alignment and is fully com-
putationally decomposable with respect to the input
text. An overview of our approach is given in Fig-
ure 1. Given two sentences, where each word is repre-

2249



sented by an embedding vector, we first create a soft
alignment matrix using neural attention (Bahdanau
et al., 2015). We then use the (soft) alignment to
decompose the task into subproblems that are solved
separately. Finally, the results of these subproblems
are merged to produce the final classification. In ad-
dition, we optionally apply intra-sentence attention
(Cheng et al., 2016) to endow the model with a richer
encoding of substructures prior to the alignment step.

Asymptotically our approach does the same total
work as a vanilla LSTM encoder, while being triv-
ially parallelizable across sentence length, which can
allow for considerable speedups in low-latency set-
tings. Empirical results on the SNLI corpus show that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, while
using almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters
compared to complex LSTM-based approaches.

2 Related Work
Our method is motivated by the central role played by
alignment in machine translation (Koehn, 2009) and
previous approaches to sentence similarity modeling
(Haghighi et al., 2005; Das and Smith, 2009; Chang
et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2013), natural language
inference (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005; MacCartney
et al., 2006; Hickl and Bensley, 2007; MacCartney
et al., 2008), and semantic parsing (Andreas et al.,
2013). The neural counterpart to alignment, atten-
tion (Bahdanau et al., 2015), which is a key part
of our approach, was originally proposed and has
been predominantly used in conjunction with LSTMs
(Rocktäschel et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016) and
to a lesser extent with CNNs (Yin et al., 2016). In
contrast, our use of attention is purely based on word
embeddings and our method essentially consists of
feed-forward networks that operate largely indepen-
dently of word order.

3 Approach
Let a = (a1, . . . , a`a) and b = (b1, . . . , b`b) be
the two input sentences of length `a and `b, re-
spectively. We assume that each ai, bj ∈ Rd
is a word embedding vector of dimension d and
that each sentence is prepended with a “NULL”
token. Our training data comes in the form of
labeled pairs {a(n),b(n),y(n)}Nn=1, where y(n) =
(y

(n)
1 , . . . , y

(n)
C ) is an indicator vector encoding the

label and C is the number of output classes. At test

time, we receive a pair of sentences (a,b) and our
goal is to predict the correct label y.

Input representation. Let ā = (ā1, . . . , ā`a) and
b̄ = (b̄1, . . . , b̄`b) denote the input representation of
each fragment that is fed to subsequent steps of the
algorithm. The vanilla version of our model simply
defines ā := a and b̄ := b. With this input rep-
resentation, our model does not make use of word
order. However, we discuss an extension using intra-
sentence attention in Section 3.4 that uses a minimal
amount of sequence information.

The core model consists of the following three
components (see Figure 1), which are trained jointly:

Attend. First, soft-align the elements of ā and b̄
using a variant of neural attention (Bahdanau et al.,
2015) and decompose the problem into the compari-
son of aligned subphrases.

Compare. Second, separately compare each
aligned subphrase to produce a set of vectors
{v1,i}`ai=1 for a and {v2,j}`bj=1 for b. Each v1,i is
a nonlinear combination of ai and its (softly) aligned
subphrase in b (and analogously for v2,j).

Aggregate. Finally, aggregate the sets {v1,i}`ai=1
and {v2,j}`bj=1 from the previous step and use the
result to predict the label ŷ.

3.1 Attend
We first obtain unnormalized attention weights eij ,
computed by a function F ′, which decomposes as:

eij := F
′(āi, b̄j) := F (āi)TF (b̄j) . (1)

This decomposition avoids the quadratic complexity
that would be associated with separately applying F ′

`a × `b times. Instead, only `a + `b applications of
F are needed. We take F to be a feed-forward neural
network with ReLU activations (Glorot et al., 2011).

2250



These attention weights are normalized as follows:

βi :=

`b∑

j=1

exp(eij)∑`b
k=1 exp(eik)

b̄j ,

αj :=

`a∑

i=1

exp(eij)∑`a
k=1 exp(ekj)

āi . (2)

Here βi is the subphrase in b̄ that is (softly) aligned
to āi and vice versa for αj .

3.2 Compare
Next, we separately compare the aligned phrases
{(āi, βi)}`ai=1 and {(b̄j , αj)}`bj=1 using a function G,
which in this work is again a feed-forward network:

v1,i := G([āi, βi]) ∀i ∈ [1, . . . , `a] ,
v2,j := G([b̄j , αj ]) ∀j ∈ [1, . . . , `b] . (3)

where the brackets [·, ·] denote concatenation. Note
that since there are only a linear number of terms in
this case, we do not need to apply a decomposition
as was done in the previous step. Thus G can jointly
take into account both āi, and βi.

3.3 Aggregate
We now have two sets of comparison vectors
{v1,i}`ai=1 and {v2,j}`bj=1. We first aggregate over
each set by summation:

v1 =

`a∑

i=1

v1,i , v2 =

`b∑

j=1

v2,j . (4)

and feed the result through a final classifier H , that
is a feed forward network followed by a linear layer:

ŷ = H([v1,v2]) , (5)

where ŷ ∈ RC represents the predicted (unnormal-
ized) scores for each class and consequently the pre-
dicted class is given by ŷ = argmaxiŷi.

For training, we use multi-class cross-entropy loss
with dropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014):

L(θF , θG, θH) =
1

N

N∑

n=1

C∑

c=1

y(n)c log
exp(ŷc)∑C

c′=1 exp(ŷc′)
.

Here θF , θG, θH denote the learnable parameters of
the functions F, G and H, respectively.

3.4 Intra-Sentence Attention (Optional)
In the above model, the input representations are
simple word embeddings. However, we can augment
this input representation with intra-sentence attention
to encode compositional relationships between words
within each sentence, as proposed by Cheng et al.
(2016). Similar to Eqs. 1 and 2, we define

fij := Fintra(ai)
TFintra(aj) , (6)

where Fintra is a feed-forward network. We then cre-
ate the self-aligned phrases

a′i :=
`a∑

j=1

exp(fij + di−j)∑`a
k=1 exp(fik + di−k)

aj . (7)

The distance-sensitive bias terms di−j ∈ R provides
the model with a minimal amount of sequence infor-
mation, while remaining parallelizable. These terms
are bucketed such that all distances greater than 10
words share the same bias. The input representation
for subsequent steps is then defined as āi := [ai, a′i]
and analogously b̄i := [bi, b′i].

4 Computational Complexity
We now discuss the asymptotic complexity of our
approach and how it offers a higher degree of par-
allelism than LSTM-based approaches. Recall that
d denotes embedding dimension and ` means sen-
tence length. For simplicity we assume that all hid-
den dimensions are d and that the complexity of
matrix(d× d)-vector(d× 1) multiplication is O(d2).

A key assumption of our analysis is that ` < d,
which we believe is reasonable and is true of the
SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) where ` < 80,
whereas recent LSTM-based approaches have used
d ≥ 300. This assumption allows us to bound the
complexity of computing the `2 attention weights.

Complexity of LSTMs. The complexity of an
LSTM cell is O(d2), resulting in a complexity of
O(`d2) to encode the sentence. Adding attention as
in Rocktäschel et al. (2016) increases this complexity
to O(`d2 + `2d).

Complexity of our Approach. Application of a
feed-forward network requires O(d2) steps. Thus,
the Compare and Aggregate steps have complexity
O(`d2) and O(d2) respectively. For the Attend step,

F is evaluated O(`) times, giving a complexity of
O(`d2). Each attention weight eij requires one dot
product, resulting in a complexity of O(`2d).

Thus the total complexity of the model is O(`d2 +
`2d), which is equal to that of an LSTM with atten-
tion. However, note that with the assumption that
` < d, this becomes O(`d2) which is the same com-
plexity as a regular LSTM. Moreover, unlike the
LSTM, our approach has the advantage of being par-
allelizable over `, which can be useful at test time.

5 Experiments

We evaluate our approach on the Stanford Natural
Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al.,
2015). Given a sentences pair (a,b), the task is to
predict whether b is entailed by a, b contradicts a,
or whether their relationship is neutral.

5.1 Implementation Details

The method was implemented in TensorFlow (Abadi
et al., 2015).

Data preprocessing: Following Bowman et al.
(2015), we remove examples labeled “–” (no gold
label) from the dataset, which leaves 549,367 pairs

for training, 9,842 for development, and 9,824 for
testing. We use the tokenized sentences from the
non-binary parse provided in the dataset and prepend
each sentence with a “NULL” token. During training,
each sentence was padded up to the maximum length
of the batch for efficient training (the padding was
explicitly masked out so as not to affect the objec-
tive/gradients). For efficient batching in TensorFlow,
we semi-sorted the training data to first contain ex-
amples where both sentences had length less than
20, followed by those with length less than 50, and
then the rest. This ensured that most training batches
contained examples of similar length.

Embeddings: We use 300 dimensional GloVe
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to represent
words. Each embedding vector was normalized to
have `2 norm of 1 and projected down to 200 di-
mensions, a number determined via hyperparameter
tuning. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are hashed
to one of 100 random embeddings each initialized
to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. All embeddings
remain fixed during training, but the projection ma-
trix is trained. All other parameter weights (hidden
layers etc.) were initialized from random Gaussians
with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01.

Each hyperparameter setting was run on a sin-
gle machine with 10 asynchronous gradient-update
threads, using Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) for opti-
mization with the default initial accumulator value of
0.1. Dropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014)
was used for all ReLU layers, but not for the final
linear layer. We additionally tuned the following
hyperparameters and present their chosen values in

parentheses: network size (2-layers, each with 200
neurons), batch size (4), 1 dropout ratio (0.2) and
learning rate (0.05–vanilla, 0.025–intra-attention).
All settings were run for 50 million steps (each step
indicates one batch) but model parameters were saved
frequently as training progressed and we chose the
model that did best on the development set.

5.2 Results

Results in terms of 3-class accuracy are shown in
Table 1. Our vanilla approach achieves state-of-the-
art results with almost an order of magnitude fewer
parameters than the LSTMN of Cheng et al. (2016).
Adding intra-sentence attention gives a considerable
improvement of 0.5 percentage points over the ex-
isting state of the art. Table 2 gives a breakdown of
accuracy on the development set showing that most
of our gains stem from neutral, while most losses
come from contradiction pairs.

Table 3 shows some wins and losses. Examples A-
C are cases where both variants of our approach are
correct while both SPINN-PI (Bowman et al., 2016)
and the mLSTM (Wang and Jiang, 2016) are incor-
rect. In the first two cases, both sentences contain
phrases that are either identical or highly lexically
related (e.g. “Two kids” and “ocean / beach”) and our
approach correctly favors neutral in these cases. In
Example C, it is possible that relying on word-order
may confuse SPINN-PI and the mLSTM due to how
“fountain” is the object of a preposition in the first
sentence but the subject of the second.

The second set of examples (D-F) are cases where

116 or 32 also work well and are a bit more stable.

our vanilla approach is incorrect but mLSTM and
SPINN-PI are correct. Example F requires sequen-
tial information and neither variant of our approach
can predict the correct class. Examples D-E are in-
teresting however, since they don’t require word or-
der information, yet intra-attention seems to help.
We suspect this may be because the word embed-
dings are not fine-grained enough for the algorithm
to conclude that “play/watch” is a contradiction, but
intra-attention, by adding an extra layer of composi-
tion/nonlinearity to incorporate context, compensates
for this.

Finally, Examples G-I are cases that all methods
get wrong. The first is actually representative of many
examples in this category where there is one critical
word that separates the two sentences (close vs open
in this case) and goes unnoticed by the algorithms.
Examples H requires inference about numbers and
Example I needs sequence information.

6 Conclusion
We presented a simple attention-based approach to
natural language inference that is trivially paralleliz-
able. The approach outperforms considerably more
complex neural methods aiming for text understand-
ing. Our results suggest that, at least for this task,
pairwise comparisons are relatively more important
than global sentence-level representations.
