Abstract

Recent work has established the efficacy of
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for constructing
parallel corpora for machine translation re-
search. We apply this to building a collec-
tion of parallel corpora between English and
six languages from the Indian subcontinent:
Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu,
and Urdu. These languages are low-resource,
under-studied, and exhibit linguistic phenom-
ena that are difficult for machine translation.
We conduct a variety of baseline experiments
and analysis, and release the data to the com-
munity.

1 Introduction

The quality of statistical machine translation (MT)
systems is strongly related to the amount of paral-
lel text available for the language pairs. However,
most language pairs have little or no readily available
bilingual training data available. As a result, most
contemporary MT research tends to opportunisti-
cally focus on language pairs with large amounts of
parallel data.
A consequence of this bias is that language ex-

hibiting certain linguistic phenomena are underrep-
resented, including languages with complex mor-
phology and languages with divergent word order-
ings. In this paper, we describe our work gather-
ing and refining document-level parallel corpora be-
tween English and each of six verb-final languages
spoken on the Indian subcontinent: Bengali, Hindi,
Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This paper’s
contributions are as follows:

• We apply an established protocol for using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to collect
parallel data to train and evaluate translation
systems for six Indian languages.

• We investigate the relative performance of syn-
tactic translation models over hierarchical ones,
showing that syntax results in higher BLEU
scores in most cases.

• We explore the impact of training data quality
on the quality of the resulting model.

• We release the corpora to the research commu-
nity under the Creative Commons Attribution-
Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA

2 Why Indian languages?

Indian languages are important objects of study for
a number of reasons. These languages are low-
resource languages in terms of the availability of
MT systems2 (and NLP tools in general) yet together
they represent nearly half a billion native speakers
(Table 1). Their speakers are well-educated, with
many of them speaking English either natively or as a
second language. Together with the degree of Inter-
net penetration in India, it is reasonably straightfor-
ward to find and hire non-expert translators through
crowdsourcing services like Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk.

word হাত্সিলাম, meaning [I] was walking. CONT denotes
the continuous aspect, while PAST denotes past tense.

In addition to a general desire to collect suitable
training corpora for low-resource languages, Indian
languages demonstrate a variety of linguistic phe-
nomena that are divergent from English and under-
studied. One example is head-finalness, exhibited
most obviously in a subject-object-verb (SOV) pat-
tern of sentence structure, in contrast to the gen-
eral SVO ordering of English sentences. One of
the motivations underlying linguistically-motivated
syntactic translation systems like GHKM (Galley et
al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or SAMT (Zollmann
and Venugopal, 2006) is to describe such transfor-
mations. This difference in word order has the po-
tential to serve as a better test bed for syntax-based
MT3 compared to translating between English and
European languages, most of which largely share its
word order. Figure 1 contains an example of SOV
reordering in Tamil.

A second important phenomenon present in these
languages is a high degree of morphological com-
plexity relative to English (Figure 2). Indian lan-
guages can be highly agglutinative, which means
that words are formed by concatenating morpholog-
ical affixes that convey information such as tense,
person, number, gender, mood, and voice. Mor-
phological complexity is a considerable hindrance at
all stages of the MT pipeline, but particularly align-
ment, where inflectional variations mask patterns
from alignment tools that treat words as atoms.

3Weuse hierarchical to denote translation grammars that use
only a single nonterminal (Chiang, 2007), in contrast to syntac-
tic systems, which make use of linguistic annotations (Zollmann
and Venugopal, 2006; Galley et al., 2006).

3 Data collection

The source of the documents for our translation task
for each of the languages in Table 1 was the set of
the top-100 most-viewed documents from each lan-
guage’s Wikipedia. These lists were obtained us-
ing page view statistics compiled from dammit.lt/
wikistats over a one year period. We did not apply
any filtering for topic or content. Table 2 contains
a manually categorized list of documents for Hindi,
with some minimal annotations indicating how the
documents relate to those in the other languages.
These documents constitute a diverse set of topics,
including culture, the internet, and sex.
We collected the parallel corpora using a three-

step process designed to ensure the integrity of the
non-professional translations. The first step was to
build a bilingual dictionary (§3.1). These dictionar-
ies were used to bootstrap the experimental controls
in the collection of four translations of each source
sentence (§3.2). Finally, as a measure of data qual-
ity, we independently collect votes on the which of
the four redundant translations is the best (§3.3).

3.1 Dictionaries

A key component of managing MTurk workers is to
ensure that they are competently and conscientiously
undertaking the tasks. As non-speakers of all of the
Indian languages, we had no simple and scalable way
to judge the quality of the workers’ translations. Our
solutionwas to bootstrap the process by first building
bilingual dictionaries for each of the datasets. The
dictionaries were then used to produce glosses of the
complete source sentences, which we compared to
the translations produced by the workers as a rough
means of manually gauging trust (§3.2).
The dictionaries were built in a separate MTurk

task, in which workers were asked to translate sin-
gle words and short phrases from the complete set of
Wikipedia documents. For each word, MTurk work-
ers were presented with three sentences containing
that word, which provided context. The control for
this task was obtained from the Wikipedia article ti-
tles which are linked across languages, and can thus
be assumed to be translations of each other. Workers
who performed too poorly on these known transla-
tions had their work rejected.

Table 3 lists the size of the dictionaries we con-
structed.

3.2 Translations

With the dictionaries in hand, we moved on to trans-
late the entireWikipedia documents. Each human in-
telligence task (HIT) posted onMTurk contained ten
sequential source-language sentences from a doc-
ument, and asked the worker to enter a free-form
translation for each. We collected four translations
from different translators for each source sentence.
To discourage cheating through cutting-and-pasting
into automatic translation systems, sentences were
presented as images. Workers were paid $0.70 per
HIT. We then manually determined whether to ac-
cept or reject a worker’s HITs based on a review of
each worker’s submissions, which included a com-
parison of the translations to a monotonic gloss (pro-
duced with the dictionary), the percentage of empty
translations, the amount of time the worker took to
complete the HIT, geographic location (self-reported
and geolocated by way of the worker’s IP address),
and by comparing different translations of the same
source segments against one another.
We obtained translations of the source-language

documents in a relatively short amount of time. Fig-
ure 3 depicts the number of translations collected as
a function of the amount of time from the posting of
the task. Malayalam provided the highest through-
put, generating half a million words in just under a

week. For comparison, the Europarl corpus (Koehn,
2005) has about 50million words of English for each
of the Spanish and French parallel corpora.
As has been previously reported (Zbib et al.,

2012), cost is another advantage of building train-
ing data on Mechanical Turk. Germann (2001) puts
the cost of professionally translated English at about
$0.30 perword for translation fromTamil. Our trans-
lations were obtained for less than $0.01 per word.
The rate of collection could likely be increased by
raising these payments, but it is unclear whether
quality would be affected by raising the base pay
(although it could be improved by paying for sub-
sequent quality control HITs, like editing).
The tradeoff for low-cost translations is increased

variance in translation quality when compared to the
more consistently-good professional translations.
Figure 4 contains some hand-picked examples of the
sorts of translations we obtained. Later, in the Exper-
iments section (§4), we will investigate the effects
this variance in translation quality has on the qual-
ity of the models that can be constructed. For now,
the variancemotivated the collection of an additional
dataset, described in the next section.

3.3 Votes

A prevailing issue with translations collected on
MTurk is the prevalence of low-quality translations.
Quality suffers for a variety of reasons: Turkers

lack formal training, often translate into a nonna-
tive tongue, may give insufficient attention to the
task, and likely desire to maximize their throughput
(and thus their wage). Unlike Zaidan and Callison-
Burch (2011), who embed controls containing source
language sentences with known professional trans-
lations, we had no professionally translated data.
Therefore, we could not measure the BLEU score of
the Turkers.

Motivated by desire to have some measure of the
relative quality and variance of the translations, we
designed another task in which we presented an in-
dependent set of Turkers with an original sentence
and its four translations, and asked them to vote on
which was best.4 Five independent workers voted
on the translations of each source sentence. Tallying
the resulting votes, we found that roughly 65% of
the sentences had five votes cast on just one or two
of the translations, and about 95% of the sentences
had all the votes cast on one, two, or three sentences.
This suggests both (1) that there was a difference in
the quality of the translations, and (2) the voters were
able to discern these differences, and took their task
seriously enough to report them.

3.4 Data sets

For each parallel corpus, we created a standardized
test set in the following manner. We first manu-
ally assigned each of the Wikipedia documents for
each language into one of the following nine cate-
gories: EVENTS, LANGUAGE AND CULTURE,
PEOPLE, PLACES, RELIGION, SEX, TECHNOL-
OGY, THINGS, or MISC. We then assigned doc-
uments to training, development, development test,
and test sets in round-robin fashion using a ratio of
roughly 7:1:1:1. For training data, each source sen-
tence was repeated four times in order to allow it
to be paired with each of its translations. For the
development and test sets, the multiple translations
served as alternate references. Table 4 lists sentence-
and word-level statistics for the datasets for each lan-
guage pair (these counts are prior to any tokeniza-
tion).

4 Experiments

In this section, we present experiments on the col-
lected data sets in order to quantify their perfor-
mance. The experiments aim to address the follow-
ing questions:

1. How well can we translate the test sets?

2. Do linguistically motivated translation models
improve translation results?

3. What is the effect of data quality onmodel qual-
ity?

4.1 Setup
A principal point of comparison in this paper is be-
tween Hiero grammars (Chiang, 2007) and SAMT
grammars (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), the lat-
ter of which make use of linguistic annotations to

improve nonterminal reordering. These grammars
were trained with the Thrax grammar extractor us-
ing its default settings, and translated using Joshua
(Weese et al., 2011). We tuned with minimum error-
rate training (Och, 2003) using Z-MERT (Zaidan,
2009) and present the mean BLEU score on test
data over three separate runs (Clark et al., 2011).
MBR reranking (Kumar and Byrne, 2004) was ap-
plied to Joshua’s 300-best (unique) output, and eval-
uation was conducted with case-insensitive BLEU
with four references.
The training data was produced by pairing a

source sentence with each of its four translations.
We also added the dictionaries to the training data.
We built five-gram language models from the target
side of the training data using interpolated Kneser-
Ney smoothing. We also experimented with a larger-
scale language model built from English Gigaword,
but, notably, found a drop of over a point in BLEU
score. This points forward to some of the difficul-
ties encountered with the lack of text normalization,
discussed in §5.

4.2 Baseline translations

We begin by presenting BLEU scores for Hiero and
SAMT translations of each of the six Indian language
test sets (Table 5). For comparison purposes, we
also present BLEU scores from Google translations
of these languages (where available).
We observe that systems built with SAMT gram-

mars improve measurably above the Hiero models,
with the exception of Tamil and Telugu. As an ex-
ternal reference point, the Google baseline transla-
tion scores far surpass the results of any of our sys-
tems, but were likely constructed from much larger
datasets.
Table 6 lists some manually-selected examples of

Tamil 9.81 9.85 +0.04 13.51

erences). BLEU scores are the mean of three MERT runs.

the sorts of translations we obtained from our sys-
tems. While anecdotal and not characteristic of over-
all quality, together with the generally good BLEU
scores, these examples provide a measure of the abil-
ity to obtain good translations from this dataset.

4.3 Voted training data
We noted above the high variance in the quality of
the translations obtained on MTurk. For data col-
lection efforts, there is a question of how much time
and effort to invest in quality control, since it comes
at the expense of simply collecting more data. We
can either collect additional redundant translations
(to increase quality) or translate more foreign sen-
tences (to increase coverage).
To test this, we constructed two smaller datasets,

each making use of only one of the four translations
of each source sentence:

• Selected randomly

• Selected by choosing the translation that re-
ceived a plurality of the votes (§3.3), breaking
ties randomly (best)

We again included the dictionaries in the training
data (where available). Table 7 contains results on
the same test sets as before. These results do not
clearly indicate that quality control through redun-
dant translations are worth the extra expense. Novot-
ney and Callison-Burch (2010) had a similar finding
for crowdsourced transcriptions.

5 Further Analysis

The previous section has shown that reasonable
BLEU scores can be obtained from baseline transla-
tion systems built from these corpora. While trans-
lation quality is an issue (for example, very lit-

Figure 5: An example of inconsistent orthography. Words

eral translations, etc), the previous section’s voted
dataset experiments suggest this is not one of the
most important issues to address.
In this section, we undertake a manual analysis of

the collected datasets to inform future work. There
are a number of issues that arise due to non-Roman
scripts, high-variance translation quality, and the rel-
atively small amount of training data.

5.1 Orthographic issues

Manual analysis demonstrates that inconsistencies
with orthography are a serious problem. An exam-
ple of this can be found in Figure 5, which contains
a set of translations of a Tamil sentence. In particu-
lar, the spelling of the Tamil word சோழர் has three
different realizations among the sentence’s transla-
tions. The discrepancy between zha and la is due
to phonetic variants (phonetic similarity may also
account for the word solar). This discrepancy is
present throughout the training and test data, where
the -la variant is preferred to -zha by about 6:1 (the
counts are 848 and 142, respectively).
In addition to mistakes potentially caused by for-

eign scripts, there are many mistakes that are sim-
ply spelling errors. Table 8 contains examples of
misspellings (along with their counts) in the train-
ing portion of the Urdu-English dataset. As a point
of comparison, there are no misspellings of the word
in Europarl.
Such errors are present in many collections, of

course, but they are particularly harmful in small
datasets, and they appear to be especially prevalent
in datasets like these, translated as they were by non-
native speakers. Whether caused by Turker care-
lessness or difficulty in translation from non-Roman
scripts, these are common issues, solutions for which
could yield significant improvement in translation
performance.

5.2 Alignments

Inconsistent orthography fragments the training
data, exacerbating problems already present due to
morpohological richness. One place this is mani-
fested is during alignment, where different spellings
mask patterns from the standard alignment tech-
niques. We observe a large number of poor align-
ments, due to interactions among these problems,
as well as the small size of the training data, well-
documented alignment mistakes (such as garbage
collecting), and the divergent sentence structures. In
particular, it seems that the defacto alignment heuris-
tics may be particularly ill-suited to these language

pairs and data conditions. Figure 6 (top) contains an
example of a particularly poor alignment produced
by the default alignment heuristic, the grow-diag-
and method described in Koehn et al. (2003).
As a means of testing this, we varied the align-

ment combination heuristics using five alternatives
described in Koehn et al. (2003) and available in the
symal program distributed with Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007). Experiments on Tamil produce a range
of BLEU scores between 7.45 and 10.19 (each result
is the average of three MERT runs). If we plot gram-
mar size versus BLEU score, we observe a general
trend that larger grammars seem to positively cor-
relate with BLEU score. We tested this more gen-
erally across languages using the Berkeley aligner5
(Liang et al., 2006) instead of GIZA alignments, and
found a consistent increase in BLEU score for the
Hiero grammars, often putting them on par with the
original SAMT results (Table 9). Manual analysis
suggests that the Berkeley aligner produces fewer,
more reasonable-looking alignments than the Moses
heuristics (Figure 6). This suggest a fruitful ap-
proaches in revisiting assumptions underlying align-
ment heuristics.

6 Related Work

Crowdsourcing datasets has been found to be helpful
for many tasks in natural language processing. Ger-
mann (2001) showed that humans could perform sur-
prisingly well with very poor translations obtained
from non-expert translators, in part likely because
coarse-level translational adequacy is sufficient for
the tasks they evaluated. That work was also pitched
as a rapid resource acquisition task, meant to test our
ability to quickly build systems in emergency set-
tings. This work further demonstrates the ability to
quickly acquire training data for MT systems with

Closely related to our work here is that of Novot-

ney and Callison-Burch (2010), who showed that
transcriptions for training speech recognition sys-
tems could be obtained from Mechanical Turk with
near baseline recognition performance and at a sig-
nificantly lower cost. They also showed that redun-
dant annotation was not worthwhile, and suggested
that money was better spent obtaining more data.
Separately, Ambati and Vogel (2010) probed the
MTurk worker pool for workers capable of translat-
ing a number of low-resource languages, including
Hindi, Telugu, and Urdu, demonstrating that such
workers could be found and quantifying acceptable

per extends that work by applying their techniques
to a larger set of Indian languages and scaling it to
training-data-set sizes.

7 Summary

We have described the collection of six parallel cor-
pora containing four-way redundant translations of
the source-language text. The Indian languages of
these corpora are low-resource and understudied,
and exhibit markedly different linguistic properties
compared to English. We performed baseline exper-
iments quantifying the translation performance of a
number of systems, investigated the effect of data
quality on model quality, and suggested a number of
approaches that could improve the quality of models
constructed from the datasets. The parallel corpora
provide a suite of SOV languages for translation re-
search and experiments.
