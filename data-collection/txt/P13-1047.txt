Abstract

To overcome the shortage of labeled data
for implicit discourse relation recogni-
tion, previous works attempted to auto-
matically generate training data by remov-
ing explicit discourse connectives from
sentences and then built models on these
synthetic implicit examples. However, a
previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides,
2008) showed that models trained on these
synthetic data do not generalize very well
to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse
data. In this work we revisit this issue and
present a multi-task learning based system
which can effectively use synthetic data
for implicit discourse relation recognition.
Results on PDTB data show that under the
multi-task learning framework our models
with the use of the prediction of explicit
discourse connectives as auxiliary learn-
ing tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 im-
provement of 5.86% over baseline models.

1 Introduction

The task of implicit discourse relation recognition
is to identify the type of discourse relation (a.k.a.
rhetorical relation) hold between two spans of
text, where there is no discourse connective (a.k.a.
discourse marker, e.g., but, and) in context to ex-
plicitly mark their discourse relation (e.g., Con-
trast or Explanation). It can be of great benefit
to many downstream NLP applications, such as
question answering (QA) (Verberne et al., 2007),
information extraction (IE) (Cimiano et al., 2005),
and machine translation (MT), etc. This task is
quite challenging due to two reasons. First, with-
out discourse connective in text, the task is quite
difficult in itself. Second, implicit discourse rela-
tion is quite frequent in text. For example, almost
half the sentences in the British National Corpus

held implicit discourse relations (Sporleder and
Lascarides, 2008). Therefore, the task of implicit
discourse relation recognition is the key to im-
proving end-to-end discourse parser performance.

To overcome the shortage of manually anno-
tated training data, (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002)
proposed a pattern-based approach to automat-
ically generate training data from raw corpora.
This line of research was followed by (Sporleder
and Lascarides, 2008) and (Blair-Goldensohn,
2007). In these works, sentences containing cer-
tain words or phrases (e.g. but, although) were
selected out from raw corpora using a pattern-
based approach and then these words or phrases
were removed from these sentences. Thus the
resulting sentences were used as synthetic train-
ing examples for implicit discourse relation recog-
nition. Since there is ambiguity of a word or
phrase serving for discourse connective (i.e., the
ambiguity between discourse and non-discourse
usage or the ambiguity between two or more dis-
course relations if the word or phrase is used as a
discourse connective), the synthetic implicit data
would contain a lot of noises. Later, with the re-
lease of manually annotated corpus, such as Penn
Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDTB) (Prasad et al.,
2008), recent studies performed implicit discourse
relation recognition on natural (i.e., genuine) im-
plicit discourse data (Pitler et al., 2009) (Lin et al.,
2009) (Wang et al., 2010) with the use of linguis-
tically informed features and machine learning al-
gorithms.

(Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) conducted a
study of the pattern-based approach presented by
(Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) and showed that the
model built on synthetical implicit data has not
generalize well on natural implicit data. They
found some evidence that this behavior is largely
independent of the classifiers used and seems to
lie in the data itself (e.g., marked and unmarked
examples may be too dissimilar linguistically and

476



removing unambiguous markers in the automatic
labelling process may lead to a meaning shift in
the examples). We state that in some cases it is
true while in other cases it may not always be so.
A simple example is given here:

(E1) a. We can’t win.
b. [but] We must keep trying.

We may find that in this example whether the in-
sertion or the removal of connective but would
not lead to a redundant or missing information be-
tween the above two sentences. That is, discourse
connectives can be inserted between or removed
from two sentences without changing the seman-
tic relations between them in some cases. An-
other similar observation is in the annotation pro-
cedure of PDTB. To label implicit discourse re-
lation, annotators inserted connective which can
best express the relation between sentences with-
out any redundancy1. We see that there should
be some linguistical similarities between explicit
and implicit discourse examples. Therefore, the
first question arises: can we exploit this kind of
linguistic similarity between explicit and implicit
discourse examples to improve implicit discourse
relation recognition?

In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning
based method to improve the performance of im-
plicit discourse relation recognition (as main task)
with the help of relevant auxiliary tasks. Specif-
ically, the main task is to recognize the implicit
discourse relations based on genuine implicit dis-
course data and the auxiliary task is to recognize
the implicit discourse relations based on synthetic
implicit discourse data. According to the princi-
ple of multi-task learning, the learning model can
be optimized by the shared part of the main task
and the auxiliary tasks without bring unnecessary
noise. That means, the model can learn from syn-
thetic implicit data while it would not bring unnec-
essary noise from synthetic implicit data.

Although (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) did
not mention, we speculate that another possible
reason for the reported worse performance may
result from noises in synthetic implicit discourse
data. These synthetic data can be generated from
two sources: (1) raw corpora with the use of
pattern-based approach in (Marcu and Echihabi,

1According to the PDTB Annotation Manual (PDTB-
Group, 2008), if the insertion of connective leads to “redun-
dancy”, the relation is annotated as Alternative lexicalizations
(AltLex), not implicit.

2002) and (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008), and
(2) manually annotated explicit data with the re-
moval of explicit discourse connectives. Obvi-
ously, the data generated from the second source
is cleaner and more reliable than that from the
first source. Therefore, the second question to ad-
dress in this work is: whether synthetic implicit
discourse data generated from explicit discourse
data source (i.e., the second source) can lead to
a better performance than that from raw corpora
(i.e., the first source)? To answer this question,
we will make a comparison of synthetic discourse
data generated from two corpora, i.e., the BILLIP
corpus and the explicit discourse data annotated in
PDTB.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 reviews related work on implicit dis-
course relation classification and multi-task learn-
ing. Section 3 presents our proposed multi-task
learning method for implicit discourse relation
classification. Section 4 provides the implemen-
tation technique details of the proposed multi-task
method. Section 5 presents experiments and dis-
cusses results. Section 6 concludes this work.

2 Related Work

2.1 Implicit discourse relation classification
2.1.1 Unsupervised approaches
Due to the lack of benchmark data for implicit
discourse relation analysis, earlier work used un-
labeled data to generate synthetic implicit dis-
course data. For example, (Marcu and Echi-
habi, 2002) proposed an unsupervised method
to recognize four discourse relations, i.e., Con-
trast, Explanation-evidence, Condition and Elab-
oration. They first used unambiguous pattern to
extract explicit discourse examples from raw cor-
pus. Then they generated synthetic implicit dis-
course data by removing explicit discourse con-
nectives from sentences extracted. In their work,
they collected word pairs from synthetic data set
as features and used machine learning method to
classify implicit discourse relation. Based on this
work, several researchers have extended the work
to improve the performance of relation classifica-
tion. For example, (Saito et al., 2006) showed that
the use of phrasal patterns as additional features
can help a word-pair based system for discourse
relation prediction on a Japanese corpus. Further-
more, (Blair-Goldensohn, 2007) improved previ-
ous work with the use of parameter optimization,

477



topic segmentation and syntactic parsing. How-
ever, (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed
that the training model built on a synthetic data
set, like the work of (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002),
may not be a good strategy since the linguistic dis-
similarity between explicit and implicit data may
hurt the performance of a model on natural data
when being trained on synthetic data.

2.1.2 Supervised approaches
This line of research work approaches this relation
prediction problem by recasting it as a classifica-
tion problem. (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) parsed
the discourse structures of sentences on RST Bank
data set (Carlson et al., 2001) which is annotated
based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and
Thompson, 1988). (Wellner et al., 2006) pre-
sented a study of discourse relation disambigua-
tion on GraphBank (Wolf et al., 2005). Recently,
(Pitler et al., 2009) (Lin et al., 2009) and (Wang
et al., 2010) conducted discourse relation study on
PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008) which has been widely
used in this field.

2.1.3 Semi-supervised approaches
Research work in this category exploited both la-
beled and unlabeled data for discourse relation
prediction. (Hernault et al., 2010) presented a
semi-supervised method based on the analysis of
co-occurring features in labeled and unlabeled
data. Very recently, (Hernault et al., 2011) in-
troduced a semi-supervised work using structure
learning method for discourse relation classifica-
tion, which is quite relevant to our work. However,
they performed discourse relation classification on
both explicit and implicit data. And their work is
different from our work in many aspects, such as,
feature sets, auxiliary task, auxiliary data, class la-
bels, learning framework, and so on. Furthermore,
there is no explicit conclusion or evidence in their
work to address the two questions raised in Sec-
tion 1.

Unlike their previous work, our previous work
(Zhou et al., 2010) presented a method to predict
the missing connective based on a language model
trained on an unannotated corpus. The predicted
connective was then used as a feature to classify
the implicit relation.

2.2 Multi-task learning

Multi-task learning is a kind of machine learning
method, which learns a main task together with

other related auxiliary tasks at the same time, us-
ing a shared representation. This often leads to
a better model for the main task, because it al-
lows the learner to use the commonality among
the tasks. Many multi-task learning methods have
been proposed in recent years, (Ando and Zhang,
2005a), (Argyriou et al., 2008), (Jebara, 2004),
(Bonilla et al., 2008), (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004),
(Baxter, 2000), (Caruana, 1997), (Thrun, 1996).
One group uses task relations as regularization
terms in the objective function to be optimized.
For example, in (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004) the
regularization terms make the parameters of mod-
els closer for similar tasks. Another group is pro-
posed to find the common structure from data and
then utilize the learned structure for multi-task
learning (Argyriou et al., 2008) (Ando and Zhang,
2005b).

3 Multi-task Learning for Discourse
Relation Prediction

3.1 Motivation

The idea of using multi-task learning for implicit
discourse relation classification is motivated by
the observations that we have made on implicit
discourse relation.

On one hand, since building a hand-annotated
implicit discourse relation corpus is costly and
time consuming, most previous work attempted to
use synthetic implicit discourse examples as train-
ing data. However, (Sporleder and Lascarides,
2008) found that the model trained on synthetic
implicit data has not performed as well as expected
in natural implicit data. They stated that the reason
is linguistic dissimilarity between explicit and im-
plicit discourse data. This indicates that straightly
using synthetic implicit data as training data may
not be helpful.

On the other hand, as shown in Section 1, we
observe that in some cases explicit discourse rela-
tion and implicit discourse relation can express the
same meaning with or without a discourse connec-
tive. This indicates that in certain degree they must
be similar to each other. If it is true, the synthetic
implicit relations are expected to be helpful for im-
plicit discourse relation classification. Therefore,
what we have to do is to find a way to train a model
which has the capabilities to learn from their sim-
ilarity and to ignore their dissimilarity as well.

To solve it, we propose a multi-task learn-
ing method for implicit discourse relation classi-

478



fication, where the classification model seeks the
shared part through jointly learning main task and
multiple auxiliary tasks. As a result, the model can
be optimized by the similar shared part without
bringing noise in the dissimilar part. Specifically,
in this work, we use alternating structure optimiza-
tion (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a) to construct
the multi-task learning framework. ASO has been
shown to be useful in a semi-supervised learning
configuration for several NLP applications, such
as, text chunking (Ando and Zhang, 2005b) and
text classification (Ando and Zhang, 2005a).

3.2 Multi-task learning and ASO

Generally, multi-task learning(MTL) considers m
prediction problems indexed by ℓ ∈ {1, ..., m},
each with nℓ samples (Xℓi , Y

ℓ
i ) for i ∈ {1, ...nℓ}

(Xi are input feature vectors and Yi are corre-
sponding classification labels) and assumes that
there exists a common predictive structure shared
by these m problems. Generally, the joint linear
model for MTL is to predict problem ℓ in the fol-
lowing form:

fℓ(Θ, X) = w
T
ℓ X + v

T
ℓ ΘX, ΘΘ

T = I, (1)

where I is the identity matrix, wℓ and vℓ are weight
vectors specific to each problem ℓ, and Θ is the
structure matrix shared by all the m predictors.
The main goal of MTL is to learn a common good
feature map ΘX for all the m problems. Several
MTL methods have been presented to learn ΘX
for all the m problems. In this work, we adopt the
ASO method.

Specifically, the ASO method adopted singu-
lar value decomposition (SVD) to obtain Θ and
m predictors that minimize the empirical risk
summed over all the m problems. Thus, the prob-
lem of optimization becomes the minimization of
the joint empirical risk written as:

m∑

ℓ=1

( nℓ∑

i=1

L(fℓ(Θ, X
ℓ
i ), Yi)

nℓ
+ λ||Wℓ||2

)
(2)

where loss function L(.) quantifies the difference
between the prediction f(Xi) and the true out-
put Yi for each predictor, and λ is a regulariza-
tion parameter for square regularization to control
the model complexity. To minimize the empirical
risk, ASO repeats the following alternating opti-
mization procedure until a convergence criterion
is met:

1) Fix (Θ, Vℓ), and find m predictors fℓ that
minimize the above joint empirical risk.

2) Fix m predictors fℓ, and find (Θ, Vℓ) that
minimizes the above joint empirical risk.

3.3 Auxiliary tasks

There are two main principles to create auxiliary
tasks. First, the auxiliary tasks should be auto-
matically labeled in order to reduce the cost of
manual labeling. Second, since the MTL model
learns from the shared part of main task and aux-
iliary tasks, the auxiliary tasks should be quite rel-
evant/similar to the main task. It is generally be-
lieved that the more the auxiliary tasks are relevant
to the main task, the more the main task can ben-
efit from the auxiliary tasks. Following these two
principles, we create the auxiliary tasks by gener-
ating automatically labeled data as follows.

Previous work (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) and
(Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) adopted prede-
fined pattern-based approach to generate synthetic
labeled data, where each predefined pattern has
one discourse relation label. In contrast, we adopt
an automatic approach to generate synthetic la-
beled data, where each discourse connective be-
tween two texts serves as their relation label. The
reason lies in the very strong connection between
discourse connectives and discourse relations. For
example, the connective but always indicates a
contrast relation between two texts. And (Pitler et
al., 2008) proved that using only connective itself,
the accuracy of explicit discourse relation classifi-
cation is over 93%.

To build the mapping between discourse con-
nective and discourse relation, for each connec-
tive, we count the times it appears in each relation
and regard the relation in which it appears most
frequently as its most relevant relation. Based on
this mapping between connective and relation, we
extract the synthetic labeled data containing the
connective as training data for auxiliary tasks.

For example, and appears 3, 000 times in PDTB
as a discourse connective. Among them, it is man-
ually annotated as an Expansion relation for 2, 938
times. So we regard the Expansion relation as its
most relevant relation and generate a mapping pat-
tern like: “and → Expansion”. Then we extract
all sentences which contain discourse “and” and
remove this connective “and” from sentences to
generate synthetic implicit data. The resulting sen-
tences are used in auxiliary task and automatically

479



marked as Expansion relation.

4 Implementation Details of Multi-task
Learning Method

4.1 Data sets for main and auxiliary tasks

To examine whether there is a difference in syn-
thetic implicit data generated from unannotated
and annotated corpus, we use two corpora. One
is a hand-annotated explicit discourse corpus, i.e.,
the explicit discourse relations in PDTB, denoted
as exp. Another is an unannotated corpus, i.e.,
BLLIP (David McClosky and Johnson., 2008).

4.1.1 Penn Discourse Treebank
PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008) is the largest hand-
annotated corpus of discourse relation so far. It
contains 2, 312 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles.
The sense label of discourse relations is hierarchi-
cally with three levels, i.e., class, type and sub-
type. The top level contains four major seman-
tic classes: Comparison (denoted as Comp.), Con-
tingency (Cont.), Expansion (Exp.) and Temporal
(Temp.). For each class, a set of types is used to
refine relation sense. The set of subtypes is to fur-
ther specify the semantic contribution of each ar-
gument. In this paper, we focus on the top level
(class) and the second level (type) relations be-
cause the subtype relations are too fine-grained
and only appear in some relations.

Both explicit and implicit discourse relations
are labeled in PDTB. In our experiment, the im-
plicit discourse relations are used in the main task
and for evaluation. While the explicit discourse
relations are used in the auxiliary task. A detailed
description of the data sources for different tasks
is given below.

Data set for main task Following previous
work in (Pitler et al., 2009) and (Zhou et al., 2010),
the implicit relations in sections 2-20 are used as
training data for the main task (denoted as imp)
and the implicit relations in sections 21-22 are
for evaluation. Table 1 shows the distribution of
implicit relations. There are too few training in-
stances for six second level relations (indicated by
* in Table 1), so we removed these six relations in
our experiments.

Data set for auxiliary task All explicit in-
stances in sections 00-24 in PDTB, i.e., 18, 459
instances, are used for auxiliary task (denoted as
exp). Following the method described in Section
3.3, we build the mapping patterns between con-

nectives and relations in PDTB and generate syn-
thetic labeled data by removing the connectives.
According to the most relevant relation sense of
connective removed, the resulting instances are
grouped into different data sets.

4.1.2 BLLIP
BLLIP North American News Text (Complete) is
used as unlabeled data source to generate syn-
thetic labeled data. In comparison with the syn-
thetic labeled data generated from the explicit re-
lations in PDTB, the synthetic labeled data from
BLLIP contains more noise. This is because the
former data is manually annotated whether a word
serves as discourse connective or not, while the
latter does not manually disambiguate two types
of ambiguity, i.e., whether a word serves as dis-
course connective or not, and the type of discourse
relation if it is a discourse connective. Finally, we
extract 26, 412 instances from BLLIP (denoted as
BLLIP) and use them for auxiliary task.

4.2 Feature representation

For both main task and auxiliary tasks, we adopt
the following three feature types. These features
are chosen due to their superior performance in
previous work (Pitler et al., 2009) and our previ-
ous work (Zhou et al., 2010).

Verbs: Following (Pitler et al., 2009), we ex-
tract the pairs of verbs from both text spans. The
number of verb pairs which have the same highest

480



Levin verb class levels (Levin, 1993) is counted
as a feature. Besides, the average length of verb
phrases in each argument is included as a feature.
In addition, the part of speech tags of the main
verbs (e.g., base form, past tense, 3rd person sin-
gular present, etc.) in each argument, i.e., MD,
VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, are recorded
as features, where we simply use the first verb in
each argument as the main verb.

Polarity: This feature records the number of
positive, negated positive, negative and neutral
words in both arguments and their cross product
as well. For negated positives, we first locate the
negated words in text span and then define the
closely behind positive word as negated positive.
The polarity of each word in arguments is de-
rived from Multi-perspective Question Answering
Opinion Corpus (MPQA) (Wilson et al., 2009).

Modality: We examine six modal words (i.e.,
can, may, must, need, shall, will) including their
various tenses or abbreviation forms in both argu-
ments. This feature records the presence or ab-
sence of modal words in both arguments and their
cross product.

4.3 Classifiers used multi-task learning

We extract the above linguistically informed fea-
tures from two synthetic implicit data sets (i.e.,
BLLIP and exp) to learn the auxiliary classifier and
from the natural implicit data set (i.e., imp) to learn
the main classifier. Under the ASO-based multi-
task learning framework, the model of main task
learns from the shared part of main task and aux-
iliary tasks. Specifically, we adopt multiple binary
classification to build model for main task. That
is, for each discourse relation, we build a binary
classifier.

5 Experiments and Results

5.1 Experiments

Although previous work has been done on PDTB
(Pitler et al., 2009) and (Lin et al., 2009), we can-
not make a direct comparison with them because
various experimental conditions, such as, differ-
ent classification strategies (multi-class classifica-
tion, multiple binary classification), different data
preparation (feature extraction and selection), dif-
ferent benchmark data collections (different sec-
tions for training and test, different levels of dis-
course relations), different classifiers with various
parameters (MaxEnt, Naı̈ve Bayes, SVM, etc) and

even different evaluation methods (F1, accuracy)
have been adopted by different researchers.

Therefore, to address the two questions raised in
Section 1 and to make the comparison reliable and
reasonable, we performed experiments on the top
and second level of PDTB using single task learn-
ing and multi-task learning, respectively. The sys-
tems using single task learning serve as baseline
systems. Under the single task learning, various
combinations of exp and BLLIP data are incorpo-
rated with imp data for the implicit discourse rela-
tion classification task.

We hypothesize that synthetical implicit data
would contribute to the main task, i.e., the implicit
discourse relation classification. Specifically, the
natural implicit data (i.e., imp) are used to create
main task and the synthetical implicit data (exp or
BLLIP) are used to create auxiliary tasks for the
purpose of optimizing the objective functions of
main task. If the hypothesis is correct, the perfor-
mance of main task would be improved by auxil-
iary tasks created from synthetical implicit data.
Thus in the experiments of multi-task learning,
only natural implicit examples (i.e., imp) data are
used for main task training while different combi-
nations of synthetical implicit examples (exp and
BLLIP) are used for auxiliary task training.

We adopt precision, recall and their combina-
tion F1 for performance evaluation. We also per-
form one-tailed t-test to validate if there is signif-
icant difference between two methods in terms of
F1 performance analysis.

5.2 Results

Table 2 summarizes the experimental results under
single and multi-task learning on the top level of
four PDTB relations with respect to different com-
binations of synthetic implicit data. For each rela-
tion, the first three rows indicate the results of us-
ing different single training data under single task
learning and the last three rows indicate the results
using different combinations of training data un-
der single task and multi-task learning. The best
F1 for every relation is shown in bold font. From
this table, we can find that on four relations, our
multi-task learning systems achieved the best per-
formance using the combination of exp and BLLIP
synthetic data.

Table 3 summarizes the best single task and the
best multi-task learning results on the second level
of PDTB. For four relations, i.e., Synchrony, Con-

Table 4 summarizes the one-tailed t-test results
on the top level of PDTB between the best single
task learning system (i.e., imp) and three multi-
task learning systems (imp:exp+BLLIP indicates
that imp is used for main task and the combi-
nation of exp and BLLIP are for auxiliary task).
The systems with insignificant performance differ-
ences are grouped into one set and ”>” and ”>>”
denote better than at significance level 0.01 and

0.001 respectively.

5.3 Discussion

From Table 2 to Table 4, several findings can be
found as follows.

We can see that the multi-task learning sys-
tems perform consistently better than the single
task learning systems for the prediction of implicit
discourse relations. Our best multi-task learning
system achieves an averaged F1 improvement of
5.86% over the best single task learning system on
the top level of PDTB relations. Specifically, for

the relations Comp., Cont., Exp., Temp., our best
multi-task learning system achieve 4.26%, 7.06%,
8.8% and 3.34% F1 improvements over the best
single task learning system. It indicates that using
synthetic implicit data as auxiliary task greatly im-
proves the performance of the main task. This is
confirmed by the following t-tests in Table 4.

In contrast to the performance of multi-task
learning, the performance of the best single task
learning system has been achieved on natural im-
plicit discourse data alone. This finding is con-
sistent with (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008). It
indicates that under single task learning, directly
adding synthetic implicit data to increase the num-
ber of training data cannot be helpful to implicit
discourse relation classification. The possible rea-
sons result from (1) the different nature of implicit
and explicit discourse data in linguistics and (2)
the noise brought from synthetic implicit data.

Based on the above analysis, we state that it is
the way of utilizing synthetic implicit data that is
important for implicit discourse relation classifica-
tion.

Although all three multi-task learning systems
outperformed single task learning systems, we
find that the two synthetic implicit data sets have
not been shown a universally consistent perfor-
mance on four top level PDTB relations. On one
hand, for the relations Comp. and Temp., the per-
formance of the two synthetic implicit data sets
alone and their combination are comparable to
each other and there is no significant difference
between them. On the other hand, for the rela-
tions Cont. and Exp., the performance of exp data
is inferior to that of BLLIP and their combination.
This is contrary to our original expectation that exp
data which has been manually annotated for dis-
course connective disambiguation should outper-
form BLLIP which contains a lot of noise. This
finding indicates that under the multi-task learn-
ing, it may not be worthy of using manually anno-
tated corpus to generate auxiliary data. It is quite
promising since it can provide benefits to reducing

the cost of human efforts on corpus annotation.

5.4 Ambiguity Analysis
Although our experiments show that synthetic im-
plicit data can help implicit discourse relation clas-
sification under multi-task learning framework,
the overall performance is still quite low (44.64%
in F1). Therefore, we analyze the types of ambi-
guity in relations and connectives in order to mo-
tivate possible future work.

5.4.1 Ambiguity of implicit relation
Without explicit discourse connective, the implicit
discourse relation instance can be understood in
two or more different ways. Given the example
E2 in PDTB, the PDTB annotators explain it as
Contingency or Expansion relation and manually
insert corresponding implicit connective for one
thing or because to express its relation.

(E2) Arg1:Now the stage is set for the battle to
play out
Arg2:The anti-programmers are getting
some helpful thunder from Congress
Connective1:because
Sense1:Contingency.Cause.Reason
Connective2:for one thing
Sense2:Expansion.Instantiation

(wsj 0118)

Thus the ambiguity of implicit discourse rela-
tions makes this task difficult in itself.

5.4.2 Ambiguity of discourse connectives
As we mentioned before, even given an explicit
discourse connective in text, its discourse rela-
tion still can be explained in two or more differ-
ent ways. And for different connectives, the am-
biguity of relation senses is quite different. That
is, the most frequent sense is not always the only
sense that a connective expresses. In example E3,
“since” is explained by annotators to express Tem-
poral or Contingency relation.

(E3) Arg1:MiniScribe has been on the rocks
Arg2:since it disclosed early this year that
its earnings reports for 1988 weren’t accu-
rate.

483



Sense1:Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession
Sense2:Contingency.Cause.Reason

(wsj 0003)

In PDTB, “since” appears 184 times in explicit
discourse relations. It expresses Temporal relation
for 80 times, Contingency relation for 94 times
and both Temporal and Contingency for 10 time
(like example E3). Therefore, although we use its
most frequent sense, i.e., Contingency, to automat-
ically extract sentences and label them, almost less
than half of them actually express Temporal rela-
tion. Thus the ambiguity of discourse connectives
is another source which has brought noise to data
when we generate synthetical implicit discourse
relation.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we present a multi-task learning
method to improve implicit discourse relation
classification by leveraging synthetic implicit dis-
course data. Results on PDTB show that under
the framework of multi-task learning, using syn-
thetic discourse data as auxiliary task significantly
improves the performance of main task. Our best
multi-task learning system achieves an averaged
F1 improvement of 5.86% over the best single task
learning system on the top level of PDTB rela-
tions. Specifically, for the relations Comp., Cont.,
Exp., Temp., our best multi-task learning system
achieves 4.26%, 7.06%, 8.8%, and 3.34% F1 im-
provements over a state of the art baseline system.
This indicates that it is the way of utilizing syn-
thetic discourse examples that is important for im-
plicit discourse relation classification.
