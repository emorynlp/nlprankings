Abstract

The research that we have been carrying out at translators’ workplaces over the past few years has pro-
vided indications that some CAT tools are not being used to their full potential or are even being ignored
by the users they were (or should have been) designed for. Since by nature humans seem to resist chang-
ing habits and procedures that do the job, it is easy to attribute that to the intransigence of older translators
and shift the focus to designing new tools for digital natives. However, the cognitive demands of pro-
cessing complex input in one language while producing and revising and/or assessing and revising output
in another add a new dimension to the usual considerations of the human-machine loop of interaction,
which may be independent of the translators’ age or experience. In fact, the productivity constraints that
many professional translators work under means that they might be adjusting more to their tools than
adjusting their tools’ settings to optimize their (the translators’) performance. And if those tools have not
been designed to meet their users’ cognitive and physical ergonomic needs, their use may actually slow
down the translation process and have potentially detrimental effects on quality.

Maureen Ehrensberger-Dow is a Canadian psycholinguist who has been involved in research into multi-
lingualism and translation in Switzerland for the past 15 years. She is Professor of Translation Studies in
the Zurich University of Applied Sciences’ Institute of Translation and Interpreting and principal inves-
tigator of the SNSF-financed research projects Capturing Translation Processes and the Cognitive and
Physical Ergonomics of Translation.
