Abstract

The quality of bilingual data is a key factor
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
Low-quality bilingual data tends to pro-
duce incorrect translation knowledge and
also degrades translation modeling per-
formance. Previous work often used su-
pervised learning methods to filter low-
quality data, but a fair amount of human
labeled examples are needed which are
not easy to obtain. To reduce the re-
liance on labeled examples, we propose
an unsupervised method to clean bilin-
gual data. The method leverages the mu-
tual reinforcement between the sentence
pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based
on the observation that better sentence
pairs often lead to better phrase extraction
and vice versa. End-to-end experiments
show that the proposed method substan-
tially improves the performance in large-
scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

1 Introduction

Statistical machine translation (SMT) depends on
the amount of bilingual data and its quality. In
real-world SMT systems, bilingual data is often
mined from the web where low-quality data is in-
evitable. The low-quality bilingual data degrades
the quality of word alignment and leads to the in-
correct phrase pairs, which will hurt the transla-
tion performance of phrase-based SMT systems
(Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). There-
fore, it is very important to exploit data quality in-
formation to improve the translation modeling.

Previous work on bilingual data cleaning often
involves some supervised learning methods. Sev-
eral bilingual data mining systems (Resnik and

∗This work has been done while the first author was visit-
ing Microsoft Research Asia.

Smith, 2003; Shi et al., 2006; Munteanu and
Marcu, 2005; Jiang et al., 2009) have a post-
processing step for data cleaning. Maximum en-
tropy or SVM based classifiers are built to filter
some non-parallel data or partial-parallel data. Al-
though these methods can filter some low-quality
bilingual data, they need sufficient human labeled
training instances to build the model, which may
not be easy to acquire.

To this end, we propose an unsupervised ap-
proach to clean the bilingual data. It is intuitive
that high-quality parallel data tends to produce
better phrase pairs than low-quality data. Mean-
while, it is also observed that the phrase pairs that
appear frequently in the bilingual corpus are more
reliable than less frequent ones because they are
more reusable, hence most good sentence pairs are
prone to contain more frequent phrase pairs (Fos-
ter et al., 2006; Wuebker et al., 2010). This kind of
mutual reinforcement fits well into the framework
of graph-based random walk. When a phrase pair
p is extracted from a sentence pair s, s is consid-
ered casting a vote for p. The higher the number
of votes a phrase pair has, the more reliable of the
phrase pair. Similarly, the quality of the sentence
pair s is determined by the number of votes casted
by the extracted phrase pairs from s.

In this paper, a PageRank-style random walk al-
gorithm (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea and Ta-
rau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007) is conducted to itera-
tively compute the importance score of each sen-
tence pair that indicates its quality: the higher the
better. Unlike other data filtering methods, our
proposed method utilizes the importance scores
of sentence pairs as fractional counts to calculate
the phrase translation probabilities based on Maxi-
mum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), thereby none
of the bilingual data is filtered out. Experimen-
tal results show that our proposed approach sub-
stantially improves the performance in large-scale
Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

2 The Proposed Approach

2.1 Graph-based random walk
Graph-based random walk is a general algorithm
to approximate the importance of a vertex within
the graph in a global view. In our method, the ver-
tices denote the sentence pairs and phrase pairs.
The importance of each vertex is propagated to
other vertices along the edges. Depending on dif-
ferent scenarios, the graph can take directed or
undirected, weighted or un-weighted forms. Start-
ing from the initial scores assigned in the graph,
the algorithm is applied to recursively compute the
importance scores of vertices until it converges, or
the difference between two consecutive iterations
falls below a pre-defined threshold.

2.2 Graph construction
Given the sentence pairs that are word-aligned
automatically, an undirected, weighted bipartite
graph is constructed which maps the sentence
pairs and the extracted phrase pairs to the ver-
tices. An edge between a sentence pair vertex and
a phrase pair vertex is added if the phrase pair can
be extracted from the sentence pair. Mutual re-
inforcement scores are defined on edges, through
which the importance scores are propagated be-
tween vertices. Figure 1 illustrates the graph struc-
ture. Formally, the bipartite graph is defined as:

G = (V,E)

where V = S ∪ P is the vertex set, S = {si|1 ≤
i ≤ n} is the set of all sentence pairs. P =
{pj |1 ≤ j ≤ m} is the set of all phrase pairs
which are extracted from S based on the word
alignment. E is the edge set in which the edges
are between S and P , thereby E = {〈si, pj〉|si ∈
S, pj ∈ P, φ(si, pj) = 1}.

φ(si, pj) =

{
1 if pj can be extracted from si
0 otherwise

2.3 Graph parameters
For sentence-phrase mutual reinforcement, a non-
negative score r(si, pj) is defined using the stan-
dard TF-IDF formula:

r(si, pj) =
{ PF (si,pj)×IPF (pj)∑

p′∈{p|φ(si,p)=1} PF (si,p
′)×IPF (p′) if φ(si, pj) = 1

0 otherwise

Figure 1: The circular nodes stand for S and
square nodes stand for P . The lines capture the
sentence-phrase mutual reinforcement.

where PF (si, pj) is the phrase pair frequency in
a sentence pair and IPF (pj) is the inverse phrase
pair frequency of pj in the whole bilingual corpus.
r(si, pj) is abbreviated as rij .

Inspired by (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea
and Tarau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007), we com-
pute the importance scores of sentence pairs and
phrase pairs using a PageRank-style algorithm.
The weights rij are leveraged to reflect the rela-
tionships between two types of vertices. Let u(si)
and v(pj) denote the scores of a sentence pair ver-
tex and a phrase pair vertex. They are computed
iteratively by:

u(si) = (1−d)+d×
∑

j∈N(si)

rij∑
k∈M(pj) rkj

v(pj)

v(pj) = (1−d) +d×
∑

j∈M(pj)

rij∑
k∈N(si) rik

u(si)

where d is empirically set to the default value 0.85
that is same as the original PageRank, N(si) =
{j|〈si, pj〉 ∈ E}, M(pj) = {i|〈si, pj〉 ∈ E}.
The detailed process is illustrated in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 iteratively updates the scores of sen-
tence pairs and phrase pairs (lines 10-26). The
computation ends when difference between two
consecutive iterations is lower than a pre-defined
threshold δ (10−12 in this study).

2.4 Parallelization

When the random walk runs on some large bilin-
gual corpora, even filtering phrase pairs that ap-
pear only once would still require several days of
CPU time for a number of iterations. To over-
come this problem, we use a distributed algorithm

based on the iterative computation in the Sec-
tion 2.3. Before the iterative computation starts,
the sum of the outlink weights for each vertex
is computed first. The edges are randomly par-
titioned into sets of roughly equal size. Each
edge 〈si, pj〉 can generate two key-value pairs
in the format 〈si, rij〉 and 〈pj , rij〉. The pairs
with the same key are summed locally and ac-
cumulated across different machines. Then, in
each iteration, the score of each vertex is up-
dated according to the sum of the normalized
inlink weights. The key-value pairs are gener-
ated in the format 〈si, rij∑

k∈M(pj) rkj
· v(pj)〉 and

〈pj , rij∑
k∈N(si) rik

· u(si)〉. These key-value pairs
are also randomly partitioned and summed across
different machines. Since long sentence pairs usu-
ally extract more phrase pairs, we need to normal-
ize the importance scores based on the sentence
length. The algorithm fits well into the MapRe-
duce programming model (Dean and Ghemawat,
2008) and we use it as our implementation.

2.5 Integration into translation modeling

After sufficient number of iterations, the impor-
tance scores of sentence pairs (i.e., u(si)) are ob-
tained. Instead of simple filtering, we use the

scores of sentence pairs as the fractional counts to
re-estimate the translation probabilities of phrase
pairs. Given a phrase pair p = 〈f̄ , ē〉, A(f̄) and
B(ē) indicate the sets of sentences that f̄ and ē
appear. Then the translation probability is defined
as:

PCW(f̄ |ē) =
∑

i∈A(f̄)∩B(ē) u(si)× ci(f̄ , ē)∑
j∈B(ē) u(sj)× cj(ē)

where ci(·) denotes the count of the phrase or
phrase pair in si. PCW(f̄ |ē) and PCW(ē|f̄) are
named as Corpus Weighting (CW) based transla-
tion probability, which are integrated into the log-
linear model in addition to the conventional phrase
translation probabilities (Koehn et al., 2003).

3 Experiments

3.1 Setup
We evaluated our bilingual data cleaning ap-
proach on large-scale Chinese-to-English machine
translation tasks. The bilingual data we used
was mainly mined from the web (Jiang et al.,
2009)1, as well as the United Nations parallel cor-
pus released by LDC and the parallel corpus re-
leased by China Workshop on Machine Transla-
tion (CWMT), which contain around 30 million
sentence pairs in total after removing duplicated
ones. The development data and testing data is
shown in Table 1.

A phrase-based decoder was implemented
based on inversion transduction grammar (Wu,
1997). The performance of this decoder is simi-
lar to the state-of-the-art phrase-based decoder in
Moses, but the implementation is more straight-
forward. We use the following feature functions
in the log-linear model:

1Although supervised data cleaning has been done in the
post-processing, the corpus still contains a fair amount of
noisy data based on our random sampling.

• phrase translation probabilities and lexical
weights in both directions (4 features);

• 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney
smoothing (1 feature);

• lexicalized reordering model (1 feature);

• phrase count and word count (2 features).

The translation model was trained over the
word-aligned bilingual corpus conducted by
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) in both directions,
and the diag-grow-final heuristic was used to re-
fine the symmetric word alignment. The language
model was trained on the LDC English Gigaword
Version 4.0 plus the English part of the bilingual
corpus. The lexicalized reordering model (Xiong
et al., 2006) was trained over the 40% randomly
sampled sentence pairs from our parallel data.
Case-insensitive BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002)
was used as the evaluation metric. The parame-
ters of the log-linear model are tuned by optimiz-
ing BLEU on the development data using MERT
(Och, 2003). Statistical significance test was per-
formed using the bootstrap re-sampling method
proposed by Koehn (2004).

3.2 Baseline

The experimental results are shown in Table 2. In
the baseline system, the phrase pairs that appear
only once in the bilingual data are simply dis-
carded because most of them are noisy. In ad-
dition, the fix-discount method in (Foster et al.,
2006) for phrase table smoothing is also used.
This implementation makes the baseline system
perform much better and the model size is much
smaller. In fact, the basic idea of our ”one count”
cutoff is very similar to the idea of ”leaving-one-
out” in (Wuebker et al., 2010). The results show

that the ”leaving-one-out” method performs al-
most the same as our baseline, thereby cannot
bring other benefits to the system.

3.3 Results

We evaluate the proposed bilingual data clean-
ing method by incorporating sentence scores into
translation modeling. In addition, we also com-
pare with several settings that filtering low-quality
sentence pairs from the bilingual data based on
the importance scores. The last N = { 0.25M,
0.5M, 1M } sentence pairs are filtered before the
modeling process. Although the simple bilin-
gual data filtering can improve the performance on
some datasets, it is difficult to determine the bor-
der line and translation performance is fluctuated.
One main reason is in the proposed random walk
approach, the bilingual sentence pairs with non-
literal translations may get lower scores because
they appear less frequently compared with those
literal translations. Crudely filtering out these data
may degrade the translation performance. For ex-
ample, we have a sentence pair in the bilingual
corpus shown in the left part of Figure 2. Although
the translation is correct in this situation, translat-
ing the Chinese word ”lingyu” to ”waters” appears
very few times since the common translations are
”areas” or ”fields”. However, simply filtering out
this kind of sentence pairs may lead to some loss
of native English expressions, thereby the trans-

343



lation performance is unstable since both non-
parallel sentence pairs and non-literal but parallel
sentence pairs are filtered. Therefore, we use the
importance score of each sentence pair to estimate
the phrase translation probabilities. It consistently
brings substantial improvements compared to the
baseline, which demonstrates graph-based random
walk indeed improves the translation modeling
performance for our SMT system.

3.4 Discussion

In (Goutte et al., 2012), they evaluated phrase-
based SMT systems trained on parallel data with
different proportions of synthetic noisy data. They
suggested that when collecting larger, noisy par-
allel data for training phrase-based SMT, clean-
ing up by trying to detect and remove incor-
rect alignments can actually degrade performance.
Our experimental results confirm their findings
on some datasets. Based on our method, some-
times filtering noisy data leads to unexpected re-
sults. The reason is two-fold: on the one hand,
the non-literal parallel data makes false positive in
noisy data detection; on the other hand, large-scale
SMT systems is relatively robust and tolerant to
noisy data, especially when we remove frequency-
1 phrase pairs. Therefore, we propose to integrate
the importance scores when re-estimating phrase
pair probabilities in this paper. The importance
scores can be considered as a kind of contribution
constraint, thereby high-quality parallel data con-
tributes more while noisy parallel data contributes
less.

4 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we develop an effective approach
to clean the bilingual data using graph-based ran-
dom walk. Significant improvements on several
datasets are achieved in our experiments. For
future work, we will extend our method to ex-
plore the relationships of sentence-to-sentence and
phrase-to-phrase, which is beyond the existing
sentence-to-phrase mutual reinforcement.
