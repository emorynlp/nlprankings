Abstract 

Emotion, the private state of a human 
entity, is becoming an important topic 
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
with increasing use of search engines. 
The present task aims to manually an-
notate the sentences in a web based 
Bengali blog corpus with the emotional 
components such as emotional expres-
sion (word/phrase), intensity, associ-
ated holder and topic(s). Ekman’s six 
emotion classes (anger, disgust, fear, 
happy, sad and surprise) along with 
three types of intensities (high, general 
and low) are considered for the sen-
tence level annotation. Presence of dis-
course markers, punctuation marks, 
negations, conjuncts, reduplication, 
rhetoric knowledge and especially 
emoticons play the contributory roles 
in the annotation process. Different 
types of fixed and relaxed strategies 
have been employed to measure the 
agreement of the sentential emotions, 
intensities, emotional holders and top-
ics respectively. Experimental results 
for each emotion class at word level on 
a small set of the whole corpus have 
been found satisfactory.    

1 Introduction 

Human emotion described in texts is an impor-
tant cue for our daily communication but the 
identification of emotional state from texts is 
not an easy task as emotion is not open to any 
objective observation or verification (Quirk et 
al., 1985). Emails, weblogs, chat rooms, online 
forums and even twitter are considered as the 

affective communication substrates to analyze 
the reaction of emotional catalysts. Among 
these media, blog is one of the communicative 
and informative repository of text based emo-
tional contents in the Web 2.0 (Lin et al., 
2007).  

Rapidly growing web users from multilin-
gual communities focus the attention to im-
prove the multilingual search engines on the 
basis of sentiment or emotion. Major studies 
on Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analyses 
have been attempted with more focused per-
spectives rather than fine-grained emotions. 
The analyses of emotion or sentiment require 
some basic resource. An emotion-annotated 
corpus is one of the primary ones to start with.  

The proposed annotation task has been car-
ried out at sentence level. Three annotators 
have manually annotated the Bengali blog sen-
tences retrieved from a web blog archive1 with 
Ekman’s six basic emotion tags (anger (A),
disgust (D), fear (F), happy (H), sad (Sa) and 
surprise (Su)). The emotional sentences are 
tagged with three types of intensities such as 
high, general and low. The sentences of non-
emotional (neutral) and multiple (mixed) cate-
gories are also identified. The identification of 
emotional words or phrases and fixing the 
scope of emotional expressions in the sen-
tences are carried out in the present task. Each 
of the emoticons is also considered as individ-
ual emotional expressions. The emotion holder 
and relevant topics associated with the emo-
tional expressions are annotated considering 
the punctuation marks, conjuncts, rhetorical 
structures and other discourse information. The 
knowledge of rhetorical structure helps in re-
moving the subjective discrepancies from the

writer’s point of view. The annotation scheme 
is used to annotate 123 blog posts containing 
4,740 emotional sentences having single emo-
tion tag and 322 emotional sentences for mixed 
emotion tagss along with 7087 neutral sen-
tences in Bengali. Three types of standard 
agreement measures such as Cohen’s kappa 
(�) (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996), Measure of 
Agreement on Set-valued Items (MASI) (Pas-
sonneau, 2004) and agr (Wiebe et al., 2005) 
metrics are employed for annotating the emo-
tion related components. The relaxed agree-
ment schemes like MASI and agr are specially 
considered for fixing the boundaries of emo-
tional expressions and topic spans in the emo-
tional sentences. The inter annotator agreement 
of some emotional components such as senten-
tial emotions, holders, topics show satisfactory 
performance but the sentences of mixed emo-
tion and intensities of general and low show 
the disagreement. A preliminary experiment 
for word level emotion classification on a 
small set of the whole corpus yielded satisfac-
tory results.

The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the related work. The 
annotation of emotional expressions, sentential 
emotion and intensities are described in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 4, the annotation scheme for 
emotion holder is described. The issues of 
emotional topic annotation are discussed in 
Section 5. Section 6 describes the preliminary 
experiments carried out on the annotated cor-
pus. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.     

2 Related Work 

One of the most well known tasks of annotat-
ing the private states in texts is carried out by 
(Wiebe et al., 2005).  They manually annotated 
the private states including emotions, opinions, 
and sentiment in a 10,000-sentence corpus (the 
MPQA corpus) of news articles. The opinion 
holder information is also annotated in the 
MPQA corpus but the topic annotation task has 
been initiated later by (Stoyanov and Cardie, 
2008a). In contrast, the present annotation 
strategy includes the fine-grained emotion 
classes and specially handles the emoticons 
present in the blog posts. 

(Alm et al., 2005) have considered eight 
emotion categories (angry, disgusted, fearful, 

happy, sad, positively surprised, negatively 
surprised) to accomplish the emotion annota-
tion task at sentence level. They have manually 
annotated 1580 sentences extracted from 22 
Grimms’ tales. The present approach discusses 
the issues of annotating unstructured blog text 
considering rhetoric knowledge along with the 
attributes, e.g. negation, conjunct, reduplica-
tion etc.  

Mishne (2005) experimented with mood 
classification in a blog corpus of 815,494 posts 
from Livejournal 
(http://www.livejournal.com), a free weblog 
service with a large community. (Mihalcea and 
Liu, 2006) have used the same data source for 
classifying the blog posts into two particular 
emotions – happiness and sadness. The blog 
posts are self-annotated by the blog writers 
with happy and sad mood labels. In contrast, 
the present approach includes Ekman’s six 
emotions, emotion holders and topics to ac-
complish the whole annotation task. 

(Neviarouskaya et al., 2007) collected 160 
sentences labeled with one of the nine emo-
tions categories (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, in-
terest, joy, sadness, shame, and surprise) and a 
corresponding intensity value from a corpus of 
online diary-like blog posts. On the other hand, 
(Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007) prepare an 
emotion-annotated corpus with a rich set of 
emotion information such as category, inten-
sity and word or phrase based expressions. The 
present task considers all the above emotion 
information during annotation. But, the present 
annotation task additionally includes the com-
ponents like emotion holder, single or multiple 
topic spans. 

The emotion corpora for Japanese were built 
for recognizing emotions (Tokuhisa et al., 
2008). An available emotion corpus in Chinese 
is Yahoo!’s Chinese news 
(http://tw.news.yahoo.com), which is used for 
Chinese emotion classification of news readers 
(Lin, et al., 2007). The manual annotation of 
eight emotional categories (expect, joy, love, 
surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry and hate) 
along with intensity, holder, word/phrase, de-
gree word, negative word, conjunction, rheto-
ric, punctuation and other linguistic expres-
sions are carried out at sentence, paragraph as 
well as document level on 1,487 Chinese blog 
documents (Quan and Ren, 2009). In addition 

48



to the above emotion entities, the present ap-
proach also includes the annotation of single or 
multiple emotion topics in a target span. 

Recent study shows that non-native English 
speakers support the growing use of the Inter-
net 2.  This raises the demand of linguistic re-
sources for languages other than English. Ben-
gali is the fifth popular language in the World, 
second in India and the national language in 
Bangladesh but it is less computerized com-
pared to English. To the best of our knowl-
edge, at present, there is no such available cor-
pus that is annotated with detailed linguistic 
expressions for emotion in Bengali or even for 
other Indian languages. Thus we believe that 
this corpus would help the development and 
evaluation of emotion analysis systems in 
Bengali. 

3 Emotion Annotation 

Random collection of 123 blog posts contain-
ing a total of 12,149 sentences are retrieved 
from Bengali web blog archive 3  (especially 
from comics, politics, sports and short stories) 
to prepare the corpus. No prior training was 
provided to the annotators but they were in-
structed to annotate each sentence of the blog 
corpus based on some illustrated samples of 
the annotated sentences. Specially for annotat-
ing the emotional expressions and topic(s) in 
emotional sentences, the annotators are free in 
selecting the texts spans. This annotation 
scheme is termed as relaxed scheme. For other 
emotional components, the annotators are 
given items with fixed text spans and in-
structed to annotation the items with definite 
tags. 

3.1 Identifying Emotional Expressions for 
Sentential Emotion and Intensity 

The identification of emotion or affect affixed 
in the text segments is a puzzle. But, the puzzle 
can be solved partially using some lexical 
clues (e.g. discourse markers, punctuation 
marks (sym), negations (NEG), conjuncts 
(CONJ), reduplication (Redup)), structural 
clues (e.g. rhetoric and syntactic knowledge) 
and especially some direct affective clues (e.g. 

                                                 
2 http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm 
3 www.amarblog.com 

emoticons (emo_icon)). The identification of 
structural clues indeed requires the identifica-
tion of lexical clues.  

Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) de-
scribes the various parts of a text, how they 
can be arranged and connected to form a whole 
text (Azar, 1999). The theory maintains that 
consecutive discourse elements, termed text 
spans, which can be in the form of clauses, 
sentences, or units larger than sentences, are 
related by a relatively small set (20–25) of rhe-
torical relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988). 
RST distinguishes between the part of a text 
that realizes the primary goal of the writer, 
termed as nucleus, and the part that provides 
supplementary material, termed satellite. The 
separation of nucleus from satellite is done 
based on punctuation marks (, ! @?), emoti-
cons, discourse markers (������  jehetu [as], ���	 
jemon [e.g.], 
�� karon [because], ���	 mane
[means]), conjuncts (e�� ebong [and], �
n 
kintu [but], a��� athoba [or]), causal verbs 
(���� ghotay [caused]) if they are explicitly 
specified in the sentences.  

Use of emotion-related words is not the sole 
means of expressing emotion. Often a 
sentence, which otherwise may not have an 
emotional word, may become emotion bearing 
depending on the context or underlying 
semantic meaning (Aman and Szpakowicz, 
2007). An empirical analysis of the blog texts 
shows two types of emotional expressions. The 
first category contains explicitly stated 
emotion word (EW) or phrases (EP) mentioned 
in the nucleus or in the satellite. Another 
category contains the implicit emotional clues 
that are identified based on the context or from 
the metaphoric knowledge of the expressions. 
Sometimes, the emotional expressions contain 
direct emotion words (EW) (�
���
 koutuk 
[joke], �	� ananda [happy], ���� 
ashcharjyo [surprise]), reduplication (Redup) 
(��  �� sanda sanda [doubt with fear], 
question words (EW_Q) (�
 ki [what], 
�� kobe 
[when]), colloquial words (k���� kshyama 
[perdon]) and foreign words (����� thanku 
[thanks], ������ gossya [anger]). On the other 
hand, the emotional expressions contain 
indirect emotion words e.g. proverbs, idioms 
(����� �� taser ghar [weakly built], ������ grri-
hadaho [family disturbance]) and emoticons 
(�,�).    

49



A large number of emoticons (emo_icon) 
present in the Bengali blog texts vary accord-
ing to their emotional categories and slant. 
Each of the emoticons is treated as individual 
emotional expression and its corresponding 
intensity is set based on the image denoted by 
the emoticon. The labeling of the emoticons 
with Ekman’s six emotion classes is verified 
through the inter-annotator agreement that is 
considered for emotion expressions.  

The intensifiers (!�� khub [too much/very], 
a�	
 anek [huge/large], "#$ bhishon 
[heavy/too much]) associated with the emo-
tional phrases are also acknowledged in anno-
tating sentential intensities. As the intensifiers 
depend solely on the context, their identifica-
tion along with the effects of negation and con-
juncts play a role in annotating the intensity. 
Negations (	� na [no], 	� noy [not]) and con-
juncts freely occur in the sentence and change 
the emotion of the sentence. For that very rea-
son, a crucial analysis of negation and con-
juncts is carried out both at intra and inter 
phrase level to obtain the sentential emotions 
and intensities. An example set of the anno-
tated blog corpus is shown in Figure 1.

3.2 Agreement of Sentential Emotion and 
Intensity  

Three annotators identified as A1, A2 and A3 
have used an open source graphical tool to 
carry out the annotation 4 . As the Ekman’s 
emotion classes and intensity types belong to 
some definite categories, the annotation

agreement for emotion and intensities are 
measured using standard Cohen's kappa coef-
ficient (�) (Cohen, 1960). The annotation 
agreement for emoticons is also measured us-
ing the kappa metric. It is a statistical measure 
of inter-rater agreement for qualitative (cate-
gorical) items. It measures the agreement be-
tween two raters who separately classify items 
into some mutually exclusive categories.  

The agreement of classifying sentential in-
tensities into three classes (high, general and 
low) is also measured using kappa (�). The 
intensities of mixed emotional sentences are 
also considered. Agreement results of emo-
tional, non-emotional and mixed sentences, 
emoticons, along with results for each emotion 
class, intensity types are shown in Table 1. 
Sentential emotions with happy, sad or sur-
prise classes produce comparatively higher 
kappa coefficient than the other emotion 
classes as the emotional expressions of these 
types were explicitly specified in the blog 
texts. It has been observed that the emotion 
pairs such as “sad-anger” and “anger-disgust” 
often cause the trouble in distinguishing the 
emotion at sentence level. Mixed emotion 
category, general and low intensity types give 
poor agreement results as expected. Instead of 
specifying agreement results of emoticons for 
each emotion class, the average results for the 
three annotation sets are shown in Table 1.    

3.3 Agreement of Emotional Expressions 

Emotional expressions are words or strings of 
words that are selected by the annotators. The 
agreement is carried out between the sets of 
text spans selected by the two annotators for 
each of the emotional expressions. As there is 
no fixed category in this case, we have em-
ployed two different strategies instead of 
kappa (�) to calculate the agreement between 
annotators. Firstly, we chose the measure of 
agreement on set-valued items (MASI) (Pas-
sonneau, 2006) that was used for measuring 
agreement on co reference annotation (Passon-
neau, 2004) and in the semantic and pragmatic 
annotation (Passonneau, 2006). MASI is a dis-
tance between sets whose value is 1 for identi-
cal sets, and 0 for disjoint sets. For sets A and 
B it is defined as: MASI = J * M, where the 
Jaccard metric is:  

50



J = | | / | |A B A B� �  
Monotonicity (M) is defined as,  

1,
2 / 3,
1/ 3, , ,
0,

ifA B
ifA BorB A
ifA B A B andB A

ifA B
� � �

�

�
� �

� � � � �
�
�
�

 

 
Secondly, the annotators will annotate dif-

ferent emotional expressions by identifying the 
responsible text anchors and the agreement is 
measured using agr metric (Wiebe et al., 
2005). If A and B are the sets of anchors anno-
tated by annotators a and b, respectively, agr is 
a directional measure of agreement that meas-
ures what proportion of a was also marked by 
b. Specifically, we compute the agreement of b 
to a as: 

 

( || )agr a b �  | |
| |

AmatchingB
A

 

 
The agr (a|| b) metric corresponds to the re-

call if a is the gold standard and b the system, 
and to precision, if b is the gold standard and a 
is the system. The results of two agreement 
strategies for each emotion class are shown in 
Table 1. The annotation agreement of 
emotional expressions produces slightly less 
values for both kappa and agr. It leads to the 
fact that the relaxed annotation scheme that is 
provided for fixing the boundaries of the 
expressions causes the disagreements.  

4 Identifying Emotion Holder  

The source or holder of an emotional expres-
sion is the speaker or writer or experiencer. 
The main criteria considered for annotating 
emotion holders are based on the nested source 
hypothesis as described in (Wiebe et al., 
2005). The structure of Bengali blog corpus (as 
shown in Figure 2) helps in the holder annota-
tion process. Sometimes, the comments of one 
blogger are annotated by other bloggers in the 
blog posts. Thus the holder annotation task in 
user comments sections was less cumbersome 
than annotating the holders inscribed in the 
topic section.

“Figure. 2.  General structure of a blog docu-
ment” 

 
Prior work in identification of opinion hold-

ers has sometimes identified only a single 
opinion per sentence (Bethard et al., 2004), 

51



and sometimes several (Choi et al., 2005).  As 
the blog corpus has sentence level emotion 
annotations, the former category is adopted. 
But, it is observed that the long sentences con-
tain more than one emotional expression and 
hence associated with multiple emotion hold-
ers (EH).  All probable emotion holders of a 
sentence are stored in an anchoring vector suc-
cessively according to their order of occur-
rence.  

The annotation of emotion holder at sen-
tence level requires the knowledge of two ba-
sic constraints (implicit and explicit) sepa-
rately. The explicit constraints qualify single 
prominent emotion holder that is directly in-
volved with the emotional expression whereas 
the implicit constraints qualify all direct and 
indirect nested sources as emotion holders. For 
example, in the following Bengali sentences, 
the pattern shown in bold face denotes the 
emotion holder. In the second example, the 
appositive case (e.g. ����� ��! (Ram’s pleasure)) 
is also identified and placed in the vector by 
removing the inflectional suffix (-e�  in this 
case). Example 2 and Example 3 contain the 
emotion holders ��� (Ram) and 	����	 ��-��	�  
(Nasrin Sultana) based on implicit constraints. 
 
Example 1.  EH_Vector: < ��� > 
���       "#$         �	�        a	�"�     
(Sayan)     (bhishon)     (anondo)      (anubhob)   

���+-

Example 3. EH_Vector: <���� '�'�, 	����	 ��-��	�

(dookher) (kathate)    (kende)   (feli) 
Gedu Chacha says: No my sister, I fall into cry 
on the sad speech of Nasrin Sultana 

4.1 Agreement of Emotion Holder 
Annotation 

The emotion holders containing multi word 
Named Entities (NEs) are assumed as single 
emotion holders. As there is no agreement dis-
crepancy in selecting the boundary of the sin-
gle or multiple emotion holders, we have used 
the standard metric, Cohen’s kappa (�) for 
measuring the inter-annotator agreement. Each 
of the elementary emotion holders in an an-
choring vector is treated as a separate emotion 
holder and the agreement between two annota-
tors is carried out on each separate entity. It is 
to be mentioned that the anchoring vectors 
provided by the two annotators may be dis-
joint.  

To emphasize the fact, a different technique 
is employed to measure the annotation agree-
ment. If X is a set of emotion holders selected 
by the first annotator and Y is a set of emotion 
holders selected by the second annotator for an 
emotional sentence containing multiple emo-
tion holders, inter-annotator agreement IAA 
for that sentence is equal to quotient of number 
of emotion holders in X and Y intersection 
divided by number of emotion holders in X 
and Y union:   

IAA = X � Y / X U Y 
 

Two types of agreement results per emotion 
class for annotating emotion holders (EH) are 
shown in Table 2. Both types of agreements 
have been found satisfactory and the difference 
between the two agreement types is signifi-
cantly less. The small difference indicates the 
minimal error involved in the annotation proc-
ess. It is found that the agreement is highly 
moderate in case of single emotion holder, but 
is less in case of multiple holders. The dis-
agreement occurs mostly in the case of satisfy-
ing the implicit constrains but some issues are 
resolved by mutual understanding. 

5 Topic Annotation and Agreement 

Topic is the real world object, event, or ab-
stract entity that is the primary subject of the 
opinion as intended by the opinion holder 
(Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008). They mention 
that the topic identification is difficult within 
the single target span of the opinion as there 
are multiple potential topics, each identified 

52



with its own topic span and the topic of an 
opinion depends on the context in which its 
associated opinion expression occurs. Hence, 
the actual challenge lies on identification of the 
topics spans from the emotional sentences. The 
writer’s emotional intentions in a sentence are 
reflected in the target span by mentioning one 
or more topics that are related to the emotional 
expressions. Topics are generally distributed in 
different text spans of writer’s text and can be 
distinguished by capturing the rhetorical struc-
ture of the text.

Table 2: Inter-Annotator Agreement for Emo-
tion Holder Annotation 

 
In blog texts, it is observed that an emotion 

topic can occur in nucleus as well as in satel-
lite. Thus, the whole sentence is assumed as 
the scope for the potential emotion topics. The 
text spans containing emotional expression and 
emotion holder can also be responsible for be-
ing the candidate seeds of target span. In Ex-
ample 3 of Section 4, the target span (	����	 
��-��	�� ��8�!� 
���� ‘sad speech of Nasrin Sul-
tana’) contains emotion holder (	����	 ��-��	�� 
‘Nasrin Sultana’) as well as the emotional ex-
pression (��8�!� 
���� ‘sad speech’) For that 
reason, the annotators are instructed to con-
sider the whole sentence as their target span 
and to identify one or more topics related to 
the emotional expressions in that sentence.  

As the topics are multi word components or 
string of words, the scope of the individual 
topics inside a target span is hard to identify. 
To accomplish the goal, we have not used the 

standard metrics Cohen’s kappa (�). We em-
ployed MASI and agr metric (as mentioned in 
Section 3) for measuring the agreement of 
topic spans annotation. The emotional sen-
tences containing single emotion topic has 
shown less disagreement than the sentences 
that contain multiple topics. It is observed that 
the agreement for annotating target span is (� 
0.9). It means that the annotation is almost sat-
isfactory. But, the disagreement occurs in an-
notating the boundaries of topic spans. The 
inter-annotator agreement for each emotion 
class is shown in Table 3. The selection of 
emotion topic from other relevant topics 
causes the disagreement.

6 Experiments on Emotion Classifica-
tion 

A preliminary experiment (Das and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2009b) was carried out on a small set 
of 1200 sentences of the annotated blog corpus 
using Conditional Random Field (CRF) 
(McCallum et al., 2001). We have employed 
the same corpus and similar features (e.g. POS, 
punctuation symbols, sentiment words etc.) for 
classifying the emotion words using Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1999). The 
results on 200 test sentences are shown in Ta-
ble 4. The results of the automatic emotion 
classification at word level show that SVM 
outperforms CRF significantly. It is observed 

53



that both classifiers fail to identify the emotion 
words that are enriched by morphological in-
flections. Although SVM outperforms CRF but 
both CRF and SVM suffer from sequence la-
beling and label bias problem with other non-
emotional words of a sentence. (For error 
analysis and detail experiments, see Das and 
Bandyopadhyay, 2009b).

Another experiment (Das and Bandyop-

adhyay, 2009a) was carried out on a small set 
of 1300 sentences of the annotated blog cor-
pus. They assign any of the Ekman’s (1993) 
six basic emotion tags to the Bengali blog sen-
tences. Conditional Random Field (CRF) 
based word level emotion classifier classifies 
the emotion words not only in emotion or non-
emotion classes but also the emotion words 
into Ekman’s six emotion classes. Corpus 
based and sense based tag weights that are cal-
culated for each of the six emotion tags are 
used to identify sentence level emotion tag. 
Sentence level accuracies for each emotion 
class were also satisfactory.   

Knowledge resources can be leveraged in 
identifying emotion-related words in text and 
the lexical coverage of these resources may be 
limited, given the informal nature of online 
discourse (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007). The 
identification of direct emotion words 
incorporates the lexicon lookup approach. A 
recently developed Bengali WordNet Affect 
lists (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010) have 
been used in determining the directly stated 
emotion words. But, the affect lists covers only 
52.79% of the directly stated emotion words.  

The fact leads not only to the problem of 
morphological enrichment but also to refer the 
problem of identifying emoticons, proverbs, 
idioms and colloquial or foreign words. But, in 

our experiments, the case of typographical er-
rors and orthographic features (for e.g. i���� 
‘disgusting’, ��b� ‘surprising’) that express or 
emphasize emotion in text are not considered.  

7 Conclusion 

The present task addresses the issues of identi-
fying emotional expressions in Bengali blog 
texts along with the annotation of sentences 
with emotional components such as intensity, 
holders and topics. Nested sources are consid-
ered for annotating the emotion holder infor-
mation. The major contribution in the task is 
the identification and fixing the text spans de-
noted for emotional expressions and multiple 
topics in a sentence. Although the preliminary 
experiments carried out on the small sets of the 
corpus show satisfactory performance, but the 
future task is to adopt a corpus-driven ap-
proach for building a lexicon of emotion words 
and phrases and extend the emotion analysis 
tasks in Bengali.
