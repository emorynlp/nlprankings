Evaluation and error analysis of machine translation output are important but difficult
tasks. In this article, we propose a framework for automatic error analysis and classification
based on the identification of actual erroneous words using the algorithms for computation
of Word Error Rate (WER) and Position-independent word Error Rate (PER), which is just
a very first step towards development of automatic evaluation measures that provide more
specific information of certain translation problems. The proposed approach enables the use of
various types of linguistic knowledge in order to classify translation errors in many different
ways. This work focuses on one possible set-up, namely, on five error categories: inflectional
errors, errors due to wrong word order, missing words, extra words, and incorrect lexical
choices. For each of the categories, we analyze the contribution of various POS classes. We
compared the results of automatic error analysis with the results of human error analysis in
order to investigate two possible applications: estimating the contribution of each error type
in a given translation output in order to identify the main sources of errors for a given
translation system, and comparing different translation outputs using the introduced error
categories in order to obtain more information about advantages and disadvantages of different
systems and possibilites for improvements, as well as about advantages and disadvantages of
applied methods for improvements. We used Arabic–English Newswire and Broadcast News
and Chinese–English Newswire outputs created in the framework of the GALE project, several
Spanish and English European Parliament outputs generated during the TC-Star project, and
three German–English outputs generated in the framework of the fourth Machine Translation
Workshop. We show that our results correlate very well with the results of a human error analy-
sis, and that all our metrics except the extra words reflect well the differences between different
versions of the same translation system as well as the differences between different translation
systems.

1. Introduction

The evaluation of machine translation output is an important and at the same time
difficult task for the progress of the field. Because there is no unique reference trans-
lation for a text (as for example in speech recognition), automatic measures are hard
to define. Human evaluation, although of course providing (at least in principle) the
most reliable judgments, is costly and time consuming. A great deal of effort has been
spent on finding measures that correlate well with human judgments when determining
which one of a set of translation systems is the best (be it different versions of the same
system in the development phase or a set of “competing” systems, as for example in a
machine translation evaluation).

However, most of the work has been focused just on best–worst decisions, namely,
finding a ranking between different machine translation systems. Although this is use-
ful information and helps in the continuous improvement of machine translation (MT)
systems, MT researches often would find it helpful to have additional information about
their systems. What are the strengths of their systems? Where do they make errors? Does
a particular modification improve some aspect of the system, although perhaps it does
not improve the overall score in terms of one of the standard measures? Does a worse-
ranked system outperform a best-ranked one in any aspect? Hardly any systematic
work has been done in this direction and developers must resort to looking at the
translation outputs in order to obtain an insight of the actual problems of their systems.
A framework for human error analysis and error classification has been proposed by
Vilar et al. (2006), but as every human evaluation, this is also a difficult and time-
consuming task.

This article presents a framework for automatic analysis and classification of errors
in a machine translation output which is just a very first step in this direction. The
basic idea is to extend the standard error rates using linguistic knowledge. The first
step is the identification of the actual erroneous words using the algorithms for the
calculation of Word Error Rate (WER) and Position-independent word Error Rate (PER).
The extracted erroneous words can then be used in combination with different types of
linguistic knowledge, such as base forms, Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, Name Entity (NE)
tags, compound words, suffixes, prefixes, and so on, in order to obtain various details
about the nature of actual errors, for example, error categories (e.g., morphological
errors, reordering errors, missing words), contribution of different word classes (e.g.,
POS, NE), and so forth.

The focus of this work is the definition of the following error categories:

� inflectional errors
� reordering errors
� missing words
� extra words
� incorrect lexical choices

and the comparison of the results of automatic error analysis with those obtained by
human error analysis for these categories. Each error category can be further classi-
fied according to POS tags (e.g., inflectional errors of verbs, missing pronouns). The
translation outputs used for the comparison of human and automatic error analysis

Popović and Ney Towards Automatic Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output

were produced in the frameworks of the GALE1 project, the TC-STAR2 project, and the
fourth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation3 (WMT09). The comparison with
human error analysis is done considering two possible applications: estimating the
contribution of each error category in a particular translation output, and comparing
different translation outputs using these categories. In addition, we show how the new
error measures can be used to get more information about the differences between
translation systems trained on different source and target languages, between different
training set-ups for a same phrase-based translation system, as well as between different
translation systems.

1.1 Related Work

A number of automatic evaluation measures for machine translation output have been
investigated in recent years. The BLEU metric (Papineni et al. 2002) and the closely
related NIST metric (Doddington 2002), along with WER and PER, have been widely
used by many machine translation researchers. The Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover
et al. 2006) and the CDER measure (Leusch, Ueffing, and Ney 2006) are based on the edit
distance (WER) but allow reordering of blocks. TER uses an edit distance with additional
costs for shifts of word sequences. The CDER measure drops certain constraints for the
hypothesis: Only the words in the reference have to be covered exactly once, whereas
those in the hypothesis can be covered zero, one, or multiple times. Preprocessing and
normalization methods for improving the evaluation using the standard measures WER,
PER, BLEU, and NIST are investigated by Leusch et al. (2005). The same set of measures
is examined by Matusov et al. (2005) in combination with automatic sentence segmen-
tation in order to enable evaluation of translation output without sentence boundaries
(e.g., translation of speech recognition output). The METEOR metric (Banerjee and Lavie
2005) first counts the number of exact word matches between the output and the
reference. In a second step, unmatched words are converted into stems or synonyms
and then matched. A method that uses the concept of maximum matching string (MMS)
is presented by Turian, Shen, and Melamed (2003). IQ (Giménez and Amigó 2006) is
a framework for automatic evaluation in which evaluation metrics can be combined.
Nevertheless, none of these measures or extensions takes into account any details about
actual translation errors, for example, what the contribution of verbs is in the overall
error rate, how many full forms are wrong although their base forms are correct, or how
many words are missing. A framework for human error analysis and error classification
has been proposed by Vilar et al. (2006), where a classification scheme (Llitjós, Carbonell,
and Lavie 2005) is presented together with a detailed analysis of the obtained results.

Automatic error analysis is still a rather unexplored area. A method for automatic
identification of patterns in translation output using POS sequences is proposed by
Lopez and Resnik (2005) in order to see how well a translation system is capable
of capturing systematic reordering patterns. Using relative differences between WER
and PER for three POS classes (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) is proposed by Popović
et al. (2006) for the estimation of inflectional and reordering errors. Semi-automatic
error analysis (Kirchhoff et al. 2007) is carried out in order to identify problematic

characteristics of source documents such as genre, domain, language, and so on. Zhou
et al. (2008) propose a diagnostic evaluation of linguistic check-points obtained auto-
matically by aligning parsed source and target sentences. For each check-point, the
number of matched n-grams of the references is then calculated. Linguistically based
reordering along with the syntax-based evaluation of reordering patterns is described
in Xiong et al. (2010).

In this work, we propose a novel framework for automatic error analysis of ma-
chine translation output based on WER and PER, and systematically investigate a set of
possible methods to carry out an error analysis at the word level.

2. A Framework for Automatic Error Analysis

The basic idea for automatic error analysis described in this work is to take into ac-
count details from the WER (edit distance) and PER algorithms, namely, to identify all
erroneous words which are actually contributing to the error rate, and then to combine
these words with different types of linguistic knowledge. The general procedure for
automatic error analysis and classification is shown in Figure 1. An overview of the
standard error rates WER and PER is given in Section 2.1, and methods for extracting
actual errors are described in the following sections.

In this article, we carried out the error analysis at the word level and we used
base forms of the words and POS tags as linguistic knowledge. However, the analy-
sis described in this work is just a first step towards automatic error analysis and
presents only one of many possibilities—this framework enables the integration of
various knowledge sources such as deeper lingustic knowledge, the introduction of
source words (possibly with additional linguistic information) if appropriate alignment
information is available, and so forth. Investigation at the word group/phrase level
instead of only at the word level is possible as well. The error analysis presented in this

linguistic information.

work is language-independent—nevertheless, availability of base forms and POS tags
for the particular target language is a requisite.

2.1 Standard Word Error Rates (Overview)

The standard procedure for evaluating machine translation output is done by com-
paring the hypothesis document hyp with the given reference document ref , each one
consisting of K sentences (or segments). The reference document ref consists of NR ≥ 1
reference translations of the source text. NR = 1 stands for the case when only a single
reference translation is available, and NR > 1 denotes the case of multiple references.
Let the length of the hypothesis sentence hypk be denoted as Nhypk , and the length
of each reference sentence Nref k,r. Then, the total hypothesis length of the document is
Nhyp =

∑
k Nhypk and the total reference length is Nref =

∑
k N

∗
ref k

, where N∗ref k is defined
as the length of the reference sentence with the lowest sentence-level error rate as
shown to be optimal with respect to the correlation with the human evaluation score’s
adequacy and fluency (Leusch et al. 2005). The overall error rate is then obtained by
normalizing the total number of errors over the total reference length.

The word error rate (WER) is based on the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein
1966)—the minimum number of substitutions, deletions, and insertions that have to be
performed to convert the generated text hyp into the reference text ref . A shortcoming of
the WER is the fact that it does not allow reorderings of words, although the word order
of the hypothesis can be different from the word order of the reference even though it
is a correct translation. The position-independent word error rate (PER) is also based on
substitutions, deletions, and insertions but without taking the word order into account.
The PER is always lower than or equal to the WER. On the other hand, a shortcoming of
the PER is the fact that it does not penalize a wrong word order.

Calculation of WER: The WER of the hypothesis hyp with respect to the reference
ref is calculated as

WER = 1Nref

K∑
k=1

min
r

{
dL(ref k,r, hypk)

}
(1)

where dL(ref k,r, hypk) is the Levenshtein distance between the reference sentence ref k,r
and the hypothesis sentence hypk. The calculation is performed using a dynamic pro-
gramming algorithm.

Calculation of PER: Define n(w, setw) as the number of occurrences of a word w
in a multi-set of words setw. The PER can be calculated using the counts n(e, hypk) and
n(e, ref k,r) of a word e in the hypothesis sentence hypk and the reference sentence ref k,r
respectively:

PER = 1Nref

2.2 Identification of WER Errors

The dynamic programming algorithm for WER enables a simple and straightforward
identification of each erroneous word which actually contributes to WER. An example of
a reference sentence and hypothesis sentence along with the corresponding Levenshtein
alignment and the actual words participating in WER is shown in Table 1. The reference
words involved in WER are denoted as reference errors, and hypothesis errors refer to
the hypothesis words participating in WER.

Table 2 presents an example of introducing linguistic knowledge in the form of
base forms and POS tags. This allows us to compute the contribution of each POS class
p to the overall WER, that is, WER(p). If werrk is the multi-set of erroneous words in
sentence k according to alignment links to the best reference and p is a POS class, then
N(WER(p)) =

∑
e∈p n(e, werrk) is the number of WER errors in werrk produced by words

belonging to the POS class p. For the substitution and the deletion errors, POS tags of

the reference words are used, and for the insertion errors, POS classes of the hypothesis
words are used. The WER for the word class p can be calculated as the standard WER by
normalizing the number of errors over the total reference length:

WER(p) = 1Nref

K∑
k=1

∑
e∈p

n(e, werrk) (4)

Standard WER of the whole sentence is equal to 5/12 = 41.7%. The contribution of
nouns is WER(N) = 1/12 = 8.3%, of verbs is WER(V) = 2/12 = 16.7%, and of adverbs
is WER(ADV) = 2/12 = 16.7%.

2.3 Identification of PER Errors

In contrast to WER, the standard efficient algorithms for the calculation of PER do not
give precise information about contributing words. However, it is possible to identify
all words in the hypothesis which do not have a counterpart in the reference, and vice
versa. These words will be referred to as PER errors.

An illustration of PER errors is given in Table 3. The number of errors contributing
to the standard PER according to Equation (3) is 3—there are two substitutions and
one deletion. The problem with standard PER is that it is not possible to detect which
words are deletion errors, which are insertion errors, and which words are substitution
errors. Therefore we introduce alternative PER-based measures which correspond to
the precision, recall, and F–measure. Let herrk refer to the multi-set of words in the
hypothesis sentence k which do not appear in the reference sentence k (referred to as
hypothesis errors). Analogously, let rerrk denote the multi-set of words in the reference

Table 3

sentence k which do not appear in the hypothesis sentence k (referred to as reference
errors). Then the following measures can be calculated:

� recall-based (reference) PER (RPER):

RPER = 1Nref

K∑
k=1

∑

� precision-based (hypothesis) PER (HPER):

FPER = 1Nref + Nhyp
·

K∑
k=1

∑
e

(
n(e, rerrk) + n(e, herrk)

)
(7)

For the example sentence presented in Table 1, the number of hypothesis errors∑
e n(e, herrk) is 2 and the number of reference errors

∑
e n(e, rerrk) is 3. The number of er-

rors contributing to the standard PER is 3 according to Equation (3), since |Nref − Nhyp| =
1 and

∑
e |n(e, ref k) − n(e, hypk)| = 5. The standard PER is normalized over the reference

length Nref = 12, thus being equal to 25%. The RPER considers only the reference errors,
RPER = 3/12 = 25%, and HPER only the hypothesis errors, HPER = 2/11 = 18.2%. The
FPER is the sum of hypothesis and reference errors divided by the sum of hypothesis
and reference length: FPER = (2 + 3)/(11 + 12) = 5/23 = 21.7%.

The contribution of nouns in the reference translation is RPER(N) = 1/12 = 8.3%, in
the hypothesis is HPER(N) = 1/11 = 9.1%, and together FPER(N) = 2/23 = 8.7%. The
contribution of verbs in the reference is RPER(V) = 2/12 = 16.7%, in the hypothesis is
HPER(V) = 1/11 = 9.1%, and together FPER(V) = 3/23 = 13%.

It should be noted that only the links between raw words are considered both for
WER as well as for RPER and HPER calculation; POS tags are added afterwards as an
additional knowledge. Exact distribution of errors over POS classes depends on the exact
implementation of the WER and the RPER and HPER algorithms. For example, if light#A
and light#N occur in the reference and light#V occurs in the hypothesis, there are two
possibilities: either light#A is linked to light#V and light#N is a missing word, or light#N
is linked to light#V so that light#A is a missing word.

3. Methods for Automatic Error Analysis and Classification

The error details described in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 can be combined with different
types of linguistic knowledge in different ways. Examples with the base forms and POS
tags as linguistic knowledge are presented in Tables 2 and 4. The described error rates

word error rate and their corresponding base forms and POS classes.

reference errors hypothesis errors

can#can#V is#be#V
be#be#V

of particular POS classes give more details than the overall standard error rates and can
be used for error analysis to some extent. However, for more precise information about
certain phenomena some kind of further analysis is required. In this work, we examine
the following error categories:

� inflectional errors — using RPER or HPER errors and base forms;
� reordering errors — using WER and RPER or HPER errors;
� missing words — using WER and RPER errors with base forms;
� extra words — using WER and HPER errors with base forms;
� incorrect lexical choice — errors which belong neither to inflectional errors

nor to missing or extra words.

Furthermore, the contribution of various POS classes for the described error categories
is estimated.

It should be noted that the base forms and POS tags are needed both for the
reference(s) and for the hypothesis. The performance of morpho-syntactic analysis is
slightly lower on the hypothesis, but this does not seem to influence the performance
of the error analysis tools. We choose to use reference words for all cases where it can
be chosen between the reference and the hypothesis, however. Nevertheless, it would
be interesting to investigate the use of hypothesis words in future experiments and
compare the results.

3.1 Inflectional Errors

An inflectional error occurs if the base form of the generated word is correct but the full
form is wrong. Inflectional errors can be estimated using RPER errors and base forms
in the following way: From each reference–hypothesis sentence pair, only erroneous
words which have common base forms are taken into account:

N(infl) =
K∑

k=1

∑
e

n(e, rerrk) −
K∑

k=1

∑
eb

n(eb, rberrk) (8)

where eb denotes the base form of the word e and rberrk stands for the multi-set of
base form errors in the reference. The number of words with erroneous base forms
(representing a multi-set of non–inflectional errors) is subtracted from the number of
total errors. For example, from the PER errors presented in Table 3, the word is will be

665



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

detected as an inflectional error because it shares the same base form with the reference
error be.

An analogous definition is possible using HPER errors and base forms; as explained
at the beginning of this section, however, we choose to use the reference words because
the results of the morpho-syntactic analysis are slightly more reliable for the references
than for the hypotheses.

3.2 Reordering Errors

Differences of word order in the hypothesis with respect to the reference are taken
into account only by WER and not by PER. Therefore, a word which occurs both in
the reference and in the hypothesis but is marked as a WER error is considered as a
reordering error. The contribution of reference reordering errors can be estimated in the
following way:

N(reord) =
K∑

k=1

∑
e

(
n(e, suberrk) + n(e, delerrk) − n(e, rerrk)

)
(9)

where suberrk represents the multi-set of WER substitution errors, delerrk the multi-set
of WER deletion errors, and rerrk the multi-set of RPER errors. A definition using HPER
errors with substitutions and insertions is also possible; this work, however, is focused
on the reference errors. For the example in Table 1, the word sometimes is identified as a
reordering error.

3.3 Missing Words

Missing words can be identified using the WER and PER errors in the following way:
The words considered as missing are those which occur as deletions in WER errors and
at the same time occur only as reference PER errors without sharing the base form with
any hypothesis error, that is, as a non–inflectional RPER error:

N(miss) =
K∑

k=1

∑
eb∈rberrk

n(e, delerrk) (10)

The multi-set of deletion WER errors is defined as delerrk, and rberrk stands for the
multi-set of base form RPER errors. The use of both WER and RPER errors is much
more reliable than using only the WER deletion errors because not all deletion er-
rors are produced by missing words—a number of WER deletions appear due to re-
ordering errors. The information about the base form is used in order to eliminate
inflectional errors. For the example in Table 1, the word can will be identified as
missing.

3.4 Extra Words

Analogously to missing words, extra words are also detected from the WER and PER
errors: The words considered as extra are those that occur as insertions in WER errors

666



Popović and Ney Towards Automatic Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output

and at the same time occur only as hypothesis PER errors without sharing the base form
with any reference error:

N(extra) =
K∑

k=1

∑
eb∈hberrk

n(e, inserrk) (11)

where inserrk is the multi-set of insertion WER errors and hberrk is the multi-set of base
form HPER errors. In the example in Table 1 none of the words will be classified as an
extra word.

3.5 Incorrect Lexical Choice

The erroneous words in the reference translation that are classified neither as inflectional
errors nor as missing words are considered as incorrect lexical choice:

N(lex) =
K∑

k=1

∑
eb

n(eb, rberrk) − N(miss) (12)

As in the case of the inflectional and reordering errors, a definition using hypothesis
errors and extra words is also possible, but in this work we choose to use reference
errors. In the example in Table 1, the word Mister in the reference (or the word Mrs in
the hypothesis) is considered as an incorrect lexical choice.

4. Comparison with Human Error Analysis

In order to compare the results of the proposed automatic error analysis with human
error analysis, the methods described in the previous sections are applied on several
translation outputs with the available results of human error analysis. These translation
outputs were produced in the framework of the GALE project, the TC-STAR project, and
the shared task of the fourth Statistical Machine Translation Workshop (WMT09).

The two main goals of the comparison with the human evaluation are:

� to examine the distribution of errors over the categories, that is, how well
the automatic methods are capable of capturing differences between error
categories and determining which of those are particularly problematic for
a given translation system;

� to examine the differences between the numbers of errors in each category
for different translation outputs, that is, how well the automatic methods
are capable of capturing differences between systems.

4.1 Human Error Analysis

Human error analysis and classification is a time-consuming and difficult task, and it
can be done in various ways. For example, in order to find errors in a translation output
it can be useful to have one or more reference translations. There are often several
correct translations of a given source sentence, however, and some of them might not
correspond to the reference translations, which poses difficulties for evaluation and

667



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

error analysis. The errors can be counted by doing a direct strict comparison between
the references and the translation outputs, which is then very similar to automatic
error analysis. But much more flexibility can be allowed: substitution of words and
expressions by synonyms, syntactically correct different word order, and so on, which
is a more natural way. It is also possible to use the references only for the semantic
aspect, namely, to look only whether the main meaning is preserved. It is even possible
not to use a reference translation at all, but compare the translation output with the
source text. There are also other aspects that may differ between human evaluations,
for example, counting each problematic word as an error or counting groups of words
as one error, and so forth. Furthermore, the human error classification is definitely not
unambigous—often it is not easy to determine in which particular error category some
error exactly belongs, sometimes one word can be assigned to more than one category,
and variations between different human evaluators are possible. For error categories
described in previous sections, especially difficult is disambiguating between incorrect
lexical choice and missing words or extra words. For example, if the translation output
is the day before yesterday and translation reference is yesterday, it could be considered as
a group of incorrectly translated words, but also as a group of extra words. Similarly,
there are several possible interpretations of errors if the one who will come is translated as
which comes.

In this work, three types of human error analysis are used:

� a strict one, comparing the output with a given reference (similar to the
automatic error analysis) (Table 5 );

� a flexible one, where syntactically correct differences in word order,
substitutions by synonyms, and correct alternative expressions are not
considered as errors; less strict than the previous method (Table 5);

� a free one, where the reference is taken into account only from the semantic
point of view (Vilar et al. 2006); less strict than the previous two methods.

The results of both human and automatic error analysis for all analyzed texts
are presented in the following sections. In addition, the Pearson (r) and Spearman
rank (ρ) correlation coefficients between human and automatic results are calculated.
Both coefficients assess how well a monotonic function describes the relationship be-
tween two variables: The Pearson correlation assumes a linear relationship between the
variables, and the Spearman correlation takes only rank into account. Thus Spearman’s

are detected with respect to the reference, whereas no errors are detected when the error analysis
is more flexible.

rank correlation coefficient is equivalent to a Pearson correlation on ranks. A Pearson
correlation of +1 means that there is a perfect positive linear relationship between the
variables, and a Spearman correlation of +1 that the ranking using both variables is
exactly the same. A Pearson correlation of −1 means that there is a perfect negative
linear relationship between variables, and a Spearman correlation of −1 that there is an
exactly inverse ranking. A correlation of 0 means there is no linear relationship between
the two variables. Thus, the higher value of r and ρ, the more similar the metrics are.

4.2 Distribution of Errors Over Categories

The goal of the experiments described in this section is to examine the distribution
of errors over the categories, that is, how well the automatic methods are capable of
capturing differences between error categories and determining which of those are
particularly problematic for a given translation system. For each of the error categories,
the distribution of errors over the basic POS classes—nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives
(A), adverbs (ADV), pronouns (PRON), determiners (DET), prepositions (PREP), conjunc-
tions (CON), numerals (NUM), and punctuation marks (PUN)—is analyzed as well, thus
obtaining more details about errors, namely, which POS classes are the main source
of errors for a particular error category. For the GALE corpora, the strict human error
analysis is carried out, and for the TC-STAR corpora, the free one.

4.2.1 Results on GALE Corpora. The raw error counts for each category obtained on the
GALE corpora both by human and automatic error classification are shown in Table 6. It
can be seen that both the results of the human analysis as well as the automatic analysis
show the same tendencies: For the Arabic-to-English Broadcast News translation, the
main sources of errors are extra words and incorrect lexical choice, for the Newswire
corpus the predominant problem is incorrect lexical choice, and for the Chinese-to-
English the majority of errors are caused by missing words, followed by incorrect lexical
choices and wrong word order.

Three examples of human and automatic error analysis are presented in Table 7.
In the first sentence, the words Japanese and friendly are classified into the same cat-
egory both by human and by automatic analysis, namely, as a reordering error and
a missing word, respectively. The words feeling for represent an example where the
human analysis assigns the error to the category of missing words, but the automatic
analysis classifies it as a lexical error. Similarly, the words can feel are considered as extra
words by humans, but as lexical errors by automatic tools. These examples illustrate the
previous statements about difficulties in disambiguation between missing words and
extra words vs. lexical errors. In the second sentence, the inflectional error based/base
is detected both by humans and by automatic tools. However, contribution is classified

as a lexical error by humans and as a missing word by automatic tools. The human
analysis classified the word wages as missing. The word is detected as an error also
by the automatic tool; nevertheless it is considered as a reordering error because it
is present only as an WER error and neither as an HPER nor as an RPER error. The
third sentence illustrates a total agreement between the human and automatic error
classification: Both words are assigned to the same category. Results for the ten basic POS
classes are shown in Table 8, and again from both human and automatic error analysis
the same conclusions can be drawn.

Table 9 presents correlations between the results of the human and automatic
analysis. The correlation function presented in Table 9(a) is measured between the error
counts in each category, and Table 9(b) presents the correlation between the error counts
for each POS class within a particular error category. It can be seen that the automatic
measures have very high correlation coefficients with respect to the results of human
evaluation. The correlations for the inflectional error category are higher than for the
other categories, which can be explained by the fact mentioned in previous sections that
the disambiguation between missing words, extra words, and incorrect lexical choice is
often difficult, both for humans and for machines.

4.2.2 Results on TC-STAR Corpora. The experiments on the TC-STAR corpora are similar to
those on the GALE corpora. There are some differences, however, because human error
classification is carried out in a somewhat different way and completely independently.
The error categories considered by the human error analysis were inflectional errors,
missing words, reordering errors, and incorrect lexical choice—that is, the same as in
the GALE experiments except extra words. The distribution of errors over POS tags is
not analyzed on this corpora, but the following details about inflectional errors are
investigated: verb tense errors, verb person errors, adjective gender errors, and adjective

number errors. The category of inflectional errors is also different: It is obtained as a sum
of these particular inflectional categories. Correlation coefficients are calculated both for
general error categories and for inflectional details.

The results of this error classification are shown in Table 10, and it can be seen that
human and automatic error analysis again produce similar trends. It can be seen as

well that the numbers of errors obtained by automatic methods is much higher than the
numbers obtained by the free human evaluation.

Table 11 presents the results for the inflectional details about verbs and adjectives
(i.e., tense, person, gender, and number). Both human and automatic error analysis
indicate that the most problematic inflectional category is the tense of verbs, especially
for the translation into Spanish.

Correlation coefficients are shown in Table 12. It can be seen that for this corpus
the correlations for the error categories, although all rather high (above 0.5), are lower
than for the GALE corpus. This is due to the free human evaluation which is carried out
on this corpora, that is, without taking the reference translation strictly into account.
However, for the inflectional error analysis the correlations are very high, above 0.9.

4.3 Differences Between Translation Systems and Methods for Improvements

The focus of this set of experiments is to examine how well the automatic methods are
capable of capturing differences between systems and methods for improvements in
order to

� estimate advantages and disadvantages of different translation systems;
� get ideas for improvements of translation performance;
� estimate advantages and disadvantages of applied methods for

improvements.

The experiments should also show how reliable each error category is for the compar-
ison of translation outputs. For each of the error categories, the basic POS classes are
analyzed as well in order to estimate which POS classes of each category are reliable for
the comparison of translation outputs.

The investigations are carried out on six Spanish-to-English TC-STAR outputs gen-
erated by phrase-based systems (Vilar et al. 2005) and three German-to-English WMT09
outputs produced in the framework of the fourth shared translation task (Callison-
Burch et al. 2009). Two of the WMT09 outputs are generated by standard phrase-based
systems (Zens, Och, and Ney 2002) and one by a hierarchical phrase-based system
(Chiang 2007). For the TC-STAR outputs two reference translations are available for the
automatic error analysis, and for the WMT09 outputs only a single reference is available.
For all texts, the flexible human error analysis is carried out. The following sections
summarize all the results along with the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients
calculated across the different translation outputs.

4.3.1 Results on TC-STAR Corpora. The error analyses were carried out on six Spanish-
to-English outputs generated by phrase-based translation systems built on different
sizes of training corpora in order to examine the effects of data sparseness (Popović and
Ney 2006b). In addition, the effects of local POS-based word reorderings of nouns and
adjectives (Popović and Ney 2006a) were analyzed in order to examine improvements
of the baseline system. Adjectives in the Spanish language are usually placed after the
corresponding noun, whereas for English it is the other way around. Therefore, local
reorderings of nouns and adjective groups in the source language were applied. If the
source language is Spanish, each noun is moved behind the corresponding adjective
group. If the source language is English, each adjective group is moved behind the
corresponding noun. An adverb followed by an adjective (e.g., more important) or two
adjectives with a coordinate conjunction in between (e.g., economic and political) are
treated as an adjective group. Reorderings were applied in the source language, then
training and search were performed using the transformed source language data. Mod-
ifications of the training and search procedure were not necessary. In this work, only
Spanish-to-English translation is analyzed. The English outputs of following training
set-ups for the same phrase-based translation system are examined:

� training on the full bilingual corpus — a large task–specific corpus (1.3M)

673



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

� training on a small task–specific corpus (13k)
� training only on a conventional dictionary

The effects of local reorderings are investigated for each size of the training corpus.
Table 13 presents the raw error counts in each category for each of the six translation

outputs in the form Nhum/Naut. In the last row of the table, the Spearman and Pearson
correlation coefficients ρ and r for each category across different translation outputs are
shown. In addition, the correlations for error distributions within a translation output
(as in Section 4.2) are presented as well in the rightmost column, and it can be seen that,
as in the previous experiments, they are high for each of the translation outputs. As for
the correlations of error categories across translation outputs, the class of inflectional er-
rors and of incorrect lexical choice have very high correlations, which suggests that these
two categories reflect well the differences between translation outputs. The reordering
errors and missing words are also suitable for comparison, whereas the category of extra
words has even a negative correlation—it is not possible to draw conclusions about
differences between translation outputs looking into this category.

From both the human and the automatic error analysis it can be concluded that the
number of inflectional errors is low, and becomes slightly higher for the system trained
on a dictionary, although there is a number of reordering errors, missing words, and
extra words. The most problematic category is the incorrect lexical choice, especially
for the small training corpora. The number of reordering errors and missing words is
also increasing when the corpus size is decreasing, although to a lesser extent. The POS-
based local reordering technique reduces the number of reordering errors, especially for
the small training corpora, and does not harm the other error categories.

4.3.2 Results on WMT Corpora. Three outputs generated by three German-to-English
statistical translation systems are analyzed in order to examine the differences between
a standard phrase-based translation model and a hierarchical translation model. In the
standard phrase-based model, phrases are defined as non-empty contiguous sequences
of words. The hierarchical phrase-based model is an extension of this model where the
phrases are allowed to have “gaps” (i.e., non-contiguous parts of the source sentence
are allowed to be translated into possibly non-contiguous parts of the target sentence).

Popović and Ney Towards Automatic Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output

In this way, long-distance dependencies and reorderings can be modelled better. In
addition, we investigate the effects of long range POS-based reorderings of German
verbs (Popović and Ney 2006a) used to improve the phrase-based system. Verbs in the
German language can often be placed at the end of a clause. This is mostly the case with
infinitives and past participles, but there are many cases when other verb forms also
occur at the clause end. For the translation from German into English, the following
verb types were moved towards the beginning of a clause: infinitives, infinitives with
the German infinitive particle zu, finite verbs, past participles, and verb negations.
Analogously to the local reorderings described in the previous section, training and
search are performed using the transformed source language data.

Table 14 presents the raw error counts in the form Nhum/Naut for all categories and all
translation outputs. Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients are shown as well for
each translation output across error categories (rightmost column), and for each error
category across different translation outputs (last row). Again, the correlations across
the error categories are very high for all translation outputs, although slightly smaller
than for the TC-STAR data. It can be seen that the extra words also have the weakest
correlation among error categories, although the coefficients are not negative as in the
case of the TC-STAR data. This confirms the previous hypothesis that this error category
is not suitable for looking into details about differences between translation outputs.

From the results of both error analyses it can be seen that for all translation outputs
the inflectional errors are again the least problematic category. On the other hand,
there is a large number of reordering errors, missing words, and especially lexical
errors. The main advantage of the hierarchical system compared to the standard phrase-
based system is the smaller number of missing words, and the main disadvantage the
larger number of reordering errors. This looks rather surprising at first, because the
hierarchical system should actually better deal with various reorderings, both local and
long-range. Nevertheless, the produced reorderings are rather unconstrained so that a
number of them are beneficial, but there are also a number of reorderings that make
the translation quality worse. One possibility for improving the hierarchical system is
to introduce certain phrase/gap constraints using POS tags or deeper syntax knowledge
sources. The long-range POS-based reorderings of verbs used to improve the standard
phrase-based system reduced the number of reordering errors, and also the number
of lexical errors. A discrepancy considering the missing words can be observed for
this method: The human error analysis reports reduction of missing words whereas
this is not captured by automatic tools. Deeper analysis regarding different POS classes
could possibly reveal more details about this. It also can be seen that the hierarchical

system produces fewer lexical errors than the baseline phrase-based system, but more
lexical errors than the phrase-based system with reorderings. Syntactic constraints for
the hierarchical model might improve this error category as well.

Table 15 presents examples of differences between translation systems and effects
of improvements along with some differences between human and automatic error
analysis.4 The first sentence represents an example for the missing words error
problem—one can see that there are a number of missing words in the output of the
phrase-based system. All of these missing words are detected both by human and

Popović and Ney Towards Automatic Error Analysis of Machine Translation Output

by automatic error analysis, except for the word amount, which is considered by the
automatic tools as a reordering error (for the same reason as the example in Table 7).
When the reordering technique is applied, the number of errors is reduced and the
translation becomes understandable although still not grammatically correct: The
sequence total amount becomes a reordering error both for humans and for automatic
tools. For the words designed and is, the confusion between missing words (human)
and lexical errors (automatic) is present. The hierarchical system generates even
fewer missing words, although neither this system nor the phrase-based system with
reorderings is able to overcome the reordering problem. It should also be noted that
for all three systems, the word assistance is detected as a word translated by incorrect
lexical choice aid/to help, whereas by the humans it is not considered as an error.

The second example illustrates improvements of the standard phrase-based system
yielded by POS-based reorderings, as well as advantages and disadvantages of the
hierarchical system. The baseline phrase-based system produces several missing words
(they want, price increases), as well as reordering errors (pass on). When the reorderings
are applied, these errors are no longer present and the overall number of errors is
reduced, although there are still some words considered as errors only by automatic
tools (i.e., if and price as lexical errors, to as a reordering error). The output of the
hierarchical system also does not contain missing words, and the problem of the verb
reordering is solved as well (pass on), but some other reordering errors are introduced:
the price increase. It should be noted that for this sentence automatic tools detect that
want is a lexical error because it is translated as wish, whereas the humans of course do
not consider this an error.

The third sentence shows advantages of the hierarchical system. The output of the
phrase-based system has several missing words (made, that will) which are not present
when the reorderings are applied, and are also not present in the output of the hierar-
chical system. The same happens with the verb reordering error be. However, the noun
reordering error Bush is not resolved by the POS-based reorderings of verbs, whereas it
is at the correct position in the hierarchical system output. Apart from this, all outputs
contain an inflectional error representative/representatives, as well as a lexical choice error
caused by an out-of-vocabulary word effective on market/marktwirksam. For the phrase-
based output, this error is classified as a lexical error both by humans and by automatic
tools, but for the other two outputs, the automatic tools classified the words effective on
as missing words.

The fourth example shows a case when the automatic error analysis cannot detect
differences between translation outputs. The baseline phrase-based output contains
verb reordering errors has been abandoned. The same error is present in the output of the
hierarchical system, whereas the sentence obtained by the phrase-based system with
reorderings is completely correct. Nevertheless, these reordering errors are not at all
detected by automatic error analysis—it detects reordering errors only if exactly the
same words in the reference and in the hypothesis are present. Therefore there are more
discrepancies between the human and automatic error analysis for all three outputs:
called off is detected as missing, disappeared as a lexical error, and in the hierarchical
system output have been are considered as extra words. This example, together with the
fact that in general the automatic error analysis detects much higher numbers of lexical
errors than the human evaluation, indicates that the automatic error analysis could be
improved by using a list of synonyms.

error category are presented in Table 16. For the cases when both error analyses detected
zero errors, the correlation coefficients are omitted. It can be seen that the verbs, nouns,
and adverbs have high correlations for each of the error categories (except extra words),
as well as that the inflectional and reordering errors have high correlations for almost all
POS classes. These error categories and POS classes are used in the further experiments
described in the following section.

On the other hand, it can be seen that for the missing words, extra words, and
lexical errors, the correlations for some of the POS classes are low or the behavior is
dependent on the data set. As already mentioned in Section 4.2, the main source of
discrepancies between human and automatic error analysis in general is the difficulty of
disambiguation between missing words, lexical errors, and extra words. Nevertheless,
a deeper analysis (an “error analysis of error analysis”) should be carried out in order

to better understand all the details. Such an analysis is an interesting and important
direction for future work.

5. Comparison of Translation Systems

The experiments in the previous sections showed that the proposed error categories
(with the exception of extra words) can be useful for obtaining more information about
differences between translation outputs. In this section, we will show some applications.
In order to be able to compare translation outputs generated under different conditions
(different target languages, different test set sizes, etc.), we introduce word error rates
for each error category, that is, we normalize the number of errors over the total refer-
ence length. We do not omit the extra words because this category is informative for
the distribution of errors in a particular translation output. Thus the following novel
metrics are defined:

INFER (inflectional error rate):
Number of RPER (reference PER) or HPER (hypothesis PER) errors caused by
wrong choice of the full word form normalized over the (closest) reference length.

RER (reordering error rate):
Number of WER errors that do not occur either as RPER (reference PER) or as HPER
(hypothesis PER) errors normalized over the (closest) reference length.

MISER (missing word error rate):
Number of WER deletions that are not caused by wrong full form choice normal-
ized over the (closest) reference length.

EXTER (extra word error rate):
Number of WER insertions that are not caused by wrong full form choice normal-
ized over the (closest) reference length.

LEXER (lexical error rate):
Number of errors caused neither by wrong full form choice nor by deleting or
inserting words normalized over the (closest) reference length.

ΣER (sum of error rates):
Sum of all error categories.

An overview about how these metrics behave in comparison with the standard word
error rates WER, PER, and TER along with Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients
is presented in Table 17. The BLEU score is also shown as illustration. All error rates are
calculated on the translation outputs analyzed in Section 4. We can see that the sum of all
error categories ΣER is always greater than PER, lower than WER, and similar, although
in a majority of cases lower, than TER.

In the following experiments, we use the error rates to get more details about
differences between

� different language pairs: The error rates are calculated for six translation
outputs generated in the framework of the WMT09 shared task in order to
see the differences between the target languages as well as the differences
in English outputs generated by distinct source languages.

� methods for improvement: Following the ideas from Section 4.3, more
details about the effects of POS-based reordering methods are analyzed:
local reorderings on the TC-STAR data and long range reorderings on the
WMT09 data.

5.1 Different Language Pairs

Table 18 presents the error rates and the BLEU scores for six translation outputs from
the News domain generated by phrase-based systems in the framework of the WMT09
shared task. The test data used in the WMT shared tasks are very suitable for such
comparison because they are parallel for all language pairs. For each language pair
only a baseline phrase-based system is used in order to focus only on the language-
dependent differences. It can be seen that for all English outputs, independently of the
source language, the inflectional error rate (INFER) of about 2% is the smallest error
rate. For the other target languages this is not the case: The French and Spanish outputs
have an INFER between 6% and 7%, and the German output more than 8%. These
results could be expected knowing that the English language is not morphologically
rich, whereas Spanish, French, and especially German are.

The highest reordering error rate (RER) is present when translating from and into
German, and the highest missing word error rate (MISER) can be observed for the
English output generated from the German source text. The category of extra words
has been shown not to be reliable for comparison of translation outputs, although it can
be seen that all EXTER scores are rather low in comparison to the other error categories.
The highest lexical error rate (LEXER) of 35% can be observed for the German output,
followed by the English output generated from the German source text (33%). The
lexical error rates for the translation from and into Spanish and French are lower and
similar, between 29% and 30%.

From the BLEU score and other standard error measures it can be seen that the transla-
tion from and particularly into German is the hardest. It can also be observed that trans-
lation into French and Spanish is more difficult than translation from these languages
into English. The results of the error analysis give more details, for example, such that
for translation from and into German language the number of reordering errors is
higher than for the other language pairs. Furthermore, when translating from German
into English, a high number of missing words should be expected. For translation into
German, morphology is an important issue. A high number of inflectional errors is also
present for the French and Spanish outputs—higher INFER is the main reason why
translation into French and Spanish is more difficult than the other translation direction.

5.2 Methods for Improvement—More Details About POS-Based Reorderings

In order to better understand the reordering problems and improvements obtained
by POS-based reordering techniques, we investigate some more details. For the full

TC-STAR training corpus, we separate the test corpus into two sets—one containing sen-
tences whose source sentences have been actually reordered and the other containing
the rest of the sentences. Then we calculate the overall RER measure as well as the RER
of noun–adjective groups and the RER of verbs for each of the sets translated by both
systems (without and with reorderings). The results in Table 19 show that the overall
RER of the reordered set is decreased by the local reorderings whereas for the rest of
the sentences a small increase can be observed. Furthermore, it can be noted that for
the reordered set the RER of verbs is significantly smaller than the RER of nouns and
adjectives which has been improved by local reorderings. For the rest of the sentences
there are no significant differences either between RERs of different POS groups or
between the system with reorderings and the baseline system. The same tendencies
occur for the other translation direction.

In order to better understand the long-range differences in word order, we carried
out a similar experiment on the WMT09 German-to-English translation output: We
separate the test corpus into two sets, and calculate the RERs. In addition, we also
calculate the MISERs, because the category of missing words has also been shown to
be rather problematic for the translation from German into English, and to be improved
by long-range reorderings. The results are presented in Table 20. It can be observed that
the reordered part of the test corpus has a higher RER, which is improved by long-range
reorderings. However, the RER of the other part is also indirectly improved. Looking
into the specific POS classes, it can be seen that the reordering error rate of nouns and
adjectives RER (N,A) is only slightly higher for the reordered sentences than for the rest,
whereas the RER (V) is significantly higher for the reordered sentences. When the long-
range reorderings are applied, the RER (V) is reduced, but indirectly also the RER (N,A).
As for missing words, the overall MISER is similar for both test sets. For the reordered
set it is reduced by applying long-range reorderings, and for the rest of the sentences
it is slightly increased. The number of missing verbs is much higher for the reordered

set than for the rest, whereas the number of missing nouns and adjectives is similar for
both sets. The MISER (V) of the reordered set is significantly reduced by long-range
reorderings, whereas the MISER (N,A) remains the same. For the rest of the sentences,
there are basically no differences between different POS classes and systems with and
without reorderings.

The experiments have also shown that the local reorderings are more targeted to
the specific word classes (i.e., nouns and adjectives), improving mostly these words,
whereas long-range reorderings do not affect only the words which are actually
reordered (in this case: verbs) but they also introduce some indirect improvements,
such as reducing errors of other word classes and reducing the number of missing
words. This happens due to better alignment learning and better phrase extraction
enabled by applying long-range reorderings.

5.3 Different Translation Systems

For the translation outputs analyzed in the previous section, the same phrase-based
translation system is used for all experiments. In order to examine how the new error
rates reflect the differences between distinct translation systems, we carried out an error
analysis of different translation outputs generated by five distinct translation systems
in the second TC-STAR evaluation. A total of nine different systems participated in the
evaluation, and we selected five representative systems for our experiments which will
be referred to as A, B, C, D, and E. For the English language we used the outputs
of four systems A, B, C, and D, and for Spanish additionally the output of a system
E. The systems A, B, and C are statistical phrase-based and the systems D and E are
rule-based.

In Table 21 the new error rates for all translation outputs are presented along with
the BLEU score as the official metric of the evaluation. For translation into English, the
systems A, B, and C have very similar BLEU scores as well as all error categories. The

worst ranked system according to the BLEU is system D, and from the error rates it can
be seen that the main problem for this system is the incorrect lexical choice. The number
of reordering errors is also larger for this system than for the others.5

For translation into Spanish, the BLEU scores are similar for the three systems A, B,
and C with the two systems D and E having lower scores. The error rates show that the
main differences between systems A, B, and C on the one side and systems D and E on
the other are incorrect lexical choices. The number of reordering errors is also higher for
systems D and E, and system D in addition has a higher INFER than the other systems.

WMT09 systems. Another interesting example can be found for the WMT09 French–
English translation task of News data: Among twenty participants, the output gener-
ated by the Google system6 has the best BLEU score as well as the best human sentence
ranking score (Callison-Burch et al. 2007), whereas the scores for the translation pro-
duced by University of Geneva (Wehrli, Nerima, and Scherrer 2009) are the lowest. The
sentence rank of a translation system is defined as the percentage of sentences for which
this system is judged by human evaluators to be better or equal than any other system.
The results for these two systems along with two additional medium ranked sys-
tems, the statistical Limsi system and a rule based rbmt3 system, can be seen in Table 22.
The BLEU score and the official human rank score are shown along with the five error
categories.

Similarly to the TC-STAR systems, the main problem of the worst-ranked systems
is the lexical error rate LEXER. The reordering error rate RER also has the same rank
as the official overall scores. Nevertheless, the Geneva translation output significantly
outperforms the other systems in terms of the inflectional error rate INFER. Looking

into the details about POS classes in Table 23, it can be seen that the INFER of verbs is
the main reason for the low INFER of the Geneva translation.

6. Discussion

This work describes a framework for automatic error analysis of translation output that
presents just a first step towards the development of automatic evaluation measures
which provide partial and more specific information of certain translation problems.
The basic idea is to use the actual erroneous words extracted from the standard word
error rates WER and PER in combination with linguistic knowledge in order to obtain
more information about the translation errors and to perform further analysis of par-
ticular phenomena. The overall goal is to get a better overview of the nature of actual
translation errors—to identify strong and weak points of a translation system, to get
ideas about possible improvements of the system, to analyze improvements achieved
by particular methods, and to better understand the differences between different trans-
lation systems.

There are many possible ways to carry out automatic error analysis using the
proposed framework. The focus of this work is classifying errors into the following five
categories: morphological (inflectional) errors, reordering errors, missing words, extra
words, and incorrect lexical choice. In addition, the distribution of these error types
over POS classes is investigated. This method can be applied to any language pair; the
prerequisite is the availability of a morpho-syntactic analyzer for the target language.

The results of the proposed method are compared with the results obtained by
human error analysis. Detailed experiments on different types of corpora and various
language pairs are carried out in order to investigate two applications of error analysis:
estimating the contribution of each error category within one translation output, and
comparing different translation outputs using the introduced error categories. For the
distribution of error categories within a translation output, we show that the results of

685



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

automatic error analysis correlate very well with the results of human error analysis
for all translation outputs. In addition, we show that the differences between results of
human and automatic error analysis occur mainly due to the difficulty of disambigua-
tion between missing words, lexical errors, and extra words. As for the comparison
of different translation outputs, we show that all error categories except extra words
correlate well with the human analysis. We also show that verbs, nouns, and adverbs
correlate well in all error categories (except extra words), as well as that inflectional
and reordering errors correlate well for almost all POS classes. Nevertheless, for missing
words, lexical errors, and extra words, some of the POS classes have low correlations.
The main reason for these discrepancies is again the problematic disambiguation be-
tween the three error categories. A deeper analysis should be carried out in order to
understand all details, such as to examine which words/POS classes are classified in one
particular category by humans but in another category automatically. Such an “error
analysis of error analysis” is an interesting and important direction for future work.

The work described in this article also opens many other directions for future work.
The proposed framework can be extended in various ways such as going beyond the
word level, introducing deeper linguistic categories, using other alignments apart from
WER and RPER/HPER (such as TER, GIZA, etc.), investigating the contribution of source
words if source–target alignment information is available, measuring correlations with
the human error analysis carried out without reference translations, measuring inter-
and intra-annotator agreement for human error analysis and its effects, and so forth.

7. Conclusions

This work presents a first step towards automatic error analysis of machine transla-
tion output. We show that the results obtained by the proposed framework correlate
very well with the results of human error analysis, as well as that the main source
of discrepancies is disambiguation between missing words, lexical errors, and extra
words. The new error rates are then calculated for various translation outputs in order
to compare them. Different source and target languages are compared to see particular
problems for each language pair and translation direction. An analysis of improvements
yielded by POS-based reorderings is carried out as well. Finally, we show how the new
measures can show differences between distinct translation systems, namely, what are
the weak/strong points of particular systems. The presented framework offers a number
of possibilities for future work, both to improve the proposed metrics as well as to
investigate other set-ups.
