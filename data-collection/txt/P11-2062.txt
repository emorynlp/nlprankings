Abstract

We present an enriched version of the Penn
Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004),
where latent features necessary for model-
ing morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic are
manually annotated. We describe our pro-
cess for efficient annotation, and present the
first quantitative analysis of Arabic morpho-
syntactic phenomena.

1 Introduction

Arabic morphology is complex, partly because of its
richness, and partly because of its complex morpho-
syntactic agreement rules which depend on features
not necessarily expressed in word forms, such as
lexical rationality and functional gender and num-
ber. In this paper, we present an enriched ver-
sion of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB, part 3)
(Maamouri et al., 2004) that we manually anno-
tated for these features.1 We describe a process
for how to do the annotation efficiently; and fur-
thermore, present the first quantitative analysis of
morpho-syntactic phenomena in Arabic.

This resource is important for building computa-
tional models of Arabic morphology and syntax that
account for morpho-syntactic agreement patterns. It
has already been used to demonstrate added value
for Arabic dependency parsing (Marton et al., 2011).

This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tions 2 and 3 present relevant linguistic facts and
related work, respectively. Section 4 describes our
annotation process and Section 5 presents an analy-
sis of the annotated corpus.

1The annotations are publicly available for research pur-
poses. Please contact authors. The PATB must be acquired
through the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC): http://
www.ldc.upenn.edu/.

2 Linguistic Facts

Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. In addi-
tion to being both templatic (root/pattern) and con-
catenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic’s optional
diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity
(Habash, 2010). This paper focuses on two specific
issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal
morphology involving the features of gender and
number only: the discrepancy between morpholog-
ical form and function and the complex system of
morpho-syntactic agreement.

2.1 Form and Function
Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and
adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: mascu-
line (M ) and feminine (F ), and for number: sin-
gular (S), dual (D) and plural (P ). These fea-
tures are typically realized using a small set of
suffixes that uniquely convey gender and num-
ber combinations: +φ (MS), �è+ +h̄2 (FS),
	
à@+ +An (MD), 	àA�K+ +tAn (FD), 	àð+ +wn (MP ),
and �H@+ +At (FP ).3 For example, the adjective
QëAÓ mAhr ‘clever’ has the following forms among
others: QëAÓ mAhr (MS), �èQëAÓ mAhrh̄ (FS), 	àðQëAÓ
mAhrwn (MP ), and �H@QëAÓ mAhrAt (FP ). For a
sizable minority of words, these features are ex-
pressed templatically, i.e., through pattern change,
coupled with some singular suffix. A typical ex-
ample of this phenomenon is the class of broken

2Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-
Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (in alphabeti-
cal order) AbtθjHxdðrzsšSDTĎςγfqklmnhwy and the additional
symbols: ’ Z, Â


@, Ǎ @


, Ā

�
@, ŵ ð', ŷ Zø', h̄ �è, ý ø.

3Some suffixes have case/state varying forms, e.g.,
	

àð+ +wn appears as 	áK
+ +yn (accusative/genitive case) and

ð+ +w (nominative construct state).

plurals. In such cases, the form of the morphol-
ogy (singular suffix) is inconsistent with the word’s
functional number (plural). For example, the word
I.

�
KA¿ kAtb (MS) ‘writer/scribe’ has two broken plu-

rals: H. A
��
J» ktAb ( MSMP )

4 and �éJ.
�
J» ktbh̄ ( FSMP ). In ad-

dition to broken plurals, Arabic has a class of bro-
ken feminines in which the feminine singular form
is derived templatically: e.g., the adjective ‘red’
QÔg


@ ÂHmr (MSMS ) and Z @QÔg HmrA’ (

MS
FS ). Verbs and

nominal duals do not display this discrepancy. Ad
hoc cases of form-function discrepancy also exist,
e.g., �é 	®J
Ê

	
g xlyfh̄ ( FSMS ) ‘caliph’, ÉÓAg HAml (

MS
FS )

‘pregnant’, and �K
Q£ Tryq ‘road’ which can be
both M and F (MSBS ). Arabic also has some non-
countable collective plurals that behave as singulars
morpho-syntactically although they may translate to
English as plurals, e.g., QÖ

�
ß tmr (MSMS ) ‘palm dates’.

2.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement

Arabic gender and number features participate in
morpho-syntactic agreement within specific con-
structions such as nouns and their adjectives and
verbs and their subjects. Arabic agreement rules are
more complex than the simple matching rules found
in languages such as French or Spanish (Holes,
2004; Habash, 2010).

First, Arabic adjectives agree with the nouns
they modify in gender and number except for plu-
ral irrational (non-human) nouns, which always
take feminine singular adjectives. For example,
the two plural words �HAJ. Ë A£ TAlbAt (

FP
FPR )

5 ‘stu-
dents’ and �HAJ.

�
JºÓ mktbAt ‘libraries’ ( FPFPI ) take

the adjective ‘new’ as �H@YK
Yg. jdydAt (
FP

FPN )
and �èYK
Yg. jdydh̄ (

FS
FSN ), respectively. Ra-

tionality is a morpho-lexical feature. There are
nouns that are semantically rational/human but not
morpho-syntactically, e.g., H. ñª

�
 šςwb ( MSMPI ) ‘na-

tions/peoples’ takes a feminine singular adjective.6

Second, verbs and their nominal subjects have the
same rules as nouns and their adjectives, except that,

4This nomenclature denotes ( Form
Function

).
5We specify rationality as part of the functional features of

the word. The values of this feature are: rational (R), irra-
tional (I), and not-applicable (N ). N is assigned to verbs, ad-
jectives, numbers and quantifiers.

6Rationality (‘humanness’ ‘É�¯A« Q�

	
«/É�¯A«’) is narrower

than animacy. English expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she
vs. it) and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows which...).

based and functional morphology features ( FormFunction ).

additionally, verbs in verb-subject (VSO) order only
agree in gender and default to singular number. For
example, the sentence ‘the men traveled’ can appear
as @ðQ 	¯A ÈAg. QË @ AlrjAl (

MS
MPR ) sAfrwA (

MP
MPN ) or as

ÈAg. QË @ Q
	
¯A sAfr ( MSMSN ) AlrjAl (

MS
MPR ).

Third, number quantification has unique rules
(Dada, 2007), e.g., numbers over 10 always take a
singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plu-
ral noun and inversely agree with the noun’s func-
tional gender.7 Compare, for instance, �HAJ. Ë A£ Ô

ure 1 presents one example that combines the three
phenomena mentioned above. The example is in a
dependency representation based on the Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATIB) (Habash and Roth, 2009).

Finally, although the rules described above are
generally followed, there are numerous exceptions
that can typically be explained as some form of fig-
ure of speech involving elision or overridden ratio-
nality/irrationality. For example, the word ��
k. jyš
( MSMSI ) ‘army’ can take the rational MP agreement
in an elided reference to its members.

7Reverse gender agreement can be modeled as a form-
function discrepancy, although it is typically not discussed as
such in Arabic grammar.

3 Related Work

Much work has been done on Arabic computa-
tional morphology (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi,
2004; Soudi et al., 2007; Habash, 2010). How-
ever, the bulk of this work does not address form-
function discrepancy or morpho-syntactic agree-
ment issues. This is unfortunately the case in some
of the most commonly used resources for Arabic
NLP: the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Ana-
lyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and the Penn
Arabic Tree Bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004).
There are some important exceptions (Goweder et
al., 2004; Smrž, 2007b; Elghamry et al., 2008; Ab-
bès et al., 2004; Attia, 2008; Altantawy et al., 2010).
We focus on comparing with two of these due to
space restrictions.

Smrž (2007b)’s work contrasting illusory (form)
features and functional features inspired our distinc-
tion of morphological form and function. How-
ever, unlike him, we do not distinguish between
sub-functional (logical and formal) features. His
ElixirFM analyzer (Smrž, 2007a) extends BAMA
by including functional number and some functional
gender information, but not rationality. This ana-
lyzer was used as part of the annotation of the Prague
Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and
Hajič, 2006). In the work presented here, we an-
notate for all three features completely in the PATB
and we present a quantitative analysis of morpho-
syntactic agreement patterns in it.

Elghamry et al. (2008) presented an automatic
cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and mono-
lingual cues to build a web-extracted lexicon en-
riched with gender, number and rationality features.
Their automatic technique achieves an F-score of
89.7% against a gold standard set. Unlike them,
we annotate the PATB manually exploiting existing
PATB information to help annotate efficiently and
accurately.

4 Corpus Annotation

4.1 The Corpus
We annotated the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) part
3 (Maamouri et al., 2004) for functional gender,
number and rationality. The corpus contains around
16.6K sentences and over 400K tokens.8 All PATB

8All clitics are separated from words in the PATB except for
the definite article +È@ Al+.

tokens are already diacritized and lemma/part-of-
speech (POS) disambiguated manually. Since verbs
are regular in their form-to-function mapping, we
annotate them automatically. Nominals account for
almost half of all tokens (∼ 197K tokens). The
unique diacritized nominal types are almost 52K
corresponding to 15,720 unique lemmas.

4.2 Annotation Simplification

To simplify the annotation task, we made the follow-
ing decisions. First, we decided to annotate nomi-
nals out of context except for the use of their lem-
mas and POS tags, which were already assigned
manually in context in the PATB. The intuition here
being that the functional features we are after are
not contextually variable. We are consciously ig-
noring usage in figures-of-speech. Second, we nor-
malized the case/state-variant forms of the num-
ber/gender suffixes and removed the definite arti-
cle proclitic. The decision to normalize is condi-
tioned on the manually annotated PATB POS tag.
The normalized forms preserve the most important
information for our task: the stem of the word and
the number/gender suffix. These two decisions al-
low us exploit the PATB POS and lemma annota-
tions to reduce the number of annotation decisions
from 197K tokens and their lemmas to 21,148 mor-
phologically normalized forms and 15,720 lemmas
– an order of magnitude less decisions to make,
which made the task more feasible both in terms of
money and time. Of all nouns, adjectives and proper
nouns, around 4.6% (tokens) and 27.2% (types) have
no lemmas (annotated as DEFAULT, TBupdate, or
nolemma). These cases make our out-of-context an-
notation very hard. We do not currently address
this issue. A smaller set of closed class words (778
types corresponding to 35,675 tokens), e.g. pro-
nouns and quantifiers, were annotated manually sep-
arately. The annotation speed averaged about 675
(words/lemmas) per hour.

4.3 Annotation Guidelines

We summarize the annotation guidelines here due to
space restrictions. Full guidelines will be presented
in a future publication. The core annotation task in-
volves assigning the correct functional gender, num-
ber and rationality to nominals. Gender can be M ,
F , B (both), or U (unknown). Number can be S, D,

359



P , or U . And rationality can be R, I , B,9 N or
U . The annotators were given word clusters each
of which consisting of a lemma and all of its sim-
plified inflected forms appearing in the PATB. We
also provided the POS and English gloss. Annota-
tors were asked to assign the rationality feature to
the lemma only; and the gender and number features
to the inflected forms. Default form-based gender
and number are provided. As for rationality, adjec-
tives receive a default N and everything else gets
I . The guidelines explained the form-function dis-
crepancy problem, and the various morpho-syntactic
agreement rules (Section 2) were given as tests to
allow the annotators to make correct decisions. The
issue figures-of-speech is highlighted as a challenge
and annotators are asked to think of different con-
texts for the word in question.

4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement

We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over
a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word
types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. The type-
based IAA scores for words with known lemmas are
93.7%, 99.0% and 89.6% for gender, number and
rationality respectively. The corresponding token-
based IAA scores are 94.5%, 99.7% and 95.1%. The
respective Kappa values (Cohen, 1960) for types are
0.87, 0.97, 0.82 and for tokens 0.89, 0.99, 0.92.
Based on these scores, the number features is the
easiest to annotate, followed by gender and ratio-
nality. This is explainable by the fact that num-
ber in Arabic is always expressed morphologically
through affix or stem change, while gender is more
lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. The
corresponding IAA scores for all words (including
words with unknown lemmas) drop to 86.8%, 94.9%
and 82.9% (for types) and 93.5%, 99.2% and 94.0%
(for tokens). The respective Kappa values for types
are 0.74, 0.85, 0.73 and for tokens 0.87, 0.97, 0.90
The difference caused by missing lemmas highlights
the need and value for complete annotations in the
PATB. The overall high scores for IAA suggest that
the task is not particularly hard for humans to per-
form, and that disambiguating information is cru-
cial. Points of disagreement will be addressed in
future extensions of the guidelines.

9The rationality value B is used for cases with lemma am-
biguity, e.g., 	àñ�JÊJ
ë hyltwn ‘Hilton’ can refer to the hotel chain
or a member of the Hilton family.

5 Corpus Analysis

We present a quantitative analysis of the annotated
corpus focusing on the issues that motivated it.

5.1 Form-Function Similarity Patterns
Table 1 summarizes the different combinations of
form-function values of gender, number and ratio-
nality for nominals in our corpus. In terms of gen-
der, the M value seems to be twice as common as
F both in form and function. In 91.4% of all nomi-
nals, function and form agree. Adjectives show the
most agreement (98.8%) followed by nouns (92.5%)
and then proper nouns (74.6%). As for number, S
is the dominant value in form (91.8%) and func-
tion (83.1%). Broken plurals ( SP ) are almost 55%
of all plurals. 99.5% of proper nouns are singular,
which means that rationality is effectively irrelevant
for proper nouns as a feature, since it is only rel-
evant morpho-syntactically with plurals. Although
the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper
nouns tend to be almost equally split between ra-
tional and irrational. In terms of gender and number
(jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form
and function values, with adjective having the high-
est ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns.

5.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Patterns
We focus on three agreement classes: Noun-
Adj(ective), Verb-Subject (VSO and SVO orders)
and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). We
only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB
(Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the
training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Mar-
ton et al. (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The
total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost
11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are Noun-
Adj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For
each agreement class, we compare using a simple
agreement rule (parent and child values match) with
using an implementation of the complex agreement
rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare
using form-based features or functional features.10

Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we de-
termine to agree (i.e. be grammatical) under dif-
ferent features and rules. Overall, simple (equality)

10Simple agreement between parent and child in gender
alone is 83.2% (form) and 86.0% (function). The corresponding
agreement for number is 82.0% (form) and 72.5% (function).
The drop in the last number is due to broken plurals.

Table 1: Form-function discrepancy in nominals. All the
numbers are percentages. Numbers in the first row are
percentage of all nominals. Numbers in each column
associated with a particular feature (or feature combi-
nation) and a particular POS are the percentage of oc-
currences within the POS. The second column specifies
(Form/Function) values. =/= signifies complete match.

form-based gender and number agreement between
parent and child is only 66.7%. Using functional
values, the simple gender and number agreement
moves only to 68.5%. Introducing complex agree-
ment rules with form-based values (using the default
N value for rationality of adjectives and I for other
classes) increases grammaticality scores to 80.3%
overall. However, with using both functional mor-
phology features and complex agreement rules, the
grammaticality score jumps to 93.6% overall. These
results validate the need for both functional features
and complex agreement rules in Arabic.

5.3 Manual Analysis of Agreement Problems

The cases we considered ungrammatical when ap-
plying complex agreement rules with functional fea-
tures above add up to 2,540 instances. Out of these,
we took a random sample of 423 cases and analyzed
it manually. About 50% of all problems are the re-
sult of human annotation errors. Almost two-thirds
of these errors involve incorrect rationality assign-
ment and almost one-third involved incorrect gen-
der. Incorrect number assignment occurs around
5% of the time. Treebank errors (as in POS or
tree structure) are responsible for 20% of all agree-

ment problems. Structure and POS tags are almost
equal in their contribution. The rest of the agree-
ment problems (∼30%) are the result of special rules
or figures-of-speech that are not handled. Figures
of speech account for about 7% of all error cases
(or less than 0.5% of all nominals). The most com-
mon cases of unhandled rules include not modeling
conjunctions, which affect number agreement, fol-
lowed by gender-number invariable forms of some
adjectives. After this error analysis, we identi-
fied 379 lemmas involved in incorrect rationality-
affected agreement (as per our rules). All of these
cases had a PI features but did not agreed as FS.
Out of these lemmas, 204 were corrected manually
as R. The functional agreement with rules jumped
from 93.6% to 95.7% (a 33% error reduction).

6 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a large resource enriched with latent
features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic
agreement in Arabic. In future work, we plan to use
both corpus annotations and agreement rules to auto-
matically learn functional features for unseen words
and detect and correct annotation errors. We also
plan to extend agreement rules to include complex
structures beyond bigrams.
