Abstract 

Most opinion mining methods in English 

rely successfully on sentiment lexicons, 

such as English SentiWordnet (ESWN). 

While there have been efforts towards 

building Arabic sentiment lexicons, they 

suffer from many deficiencies: limited 

size, unclear usability plan given Ara-

bic’s rich morphology, or non-

availability publicly. In this paper, we 

address all of these issues and produce 

the first publicly available large scale 

Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon (Ar-

SenL) using a combination of existing re-

sources: ESWN, Arabic WordNet, and 

the Standard Arabic Morphological Ana-

lyzer (SAMA). We compare and com-

bine two methods of constructing this 

lexicon with an eye on insights for Ara-

bic dialects and other low resource lan-

guages. We also present an extrinsic 

evaluation in terms of subjectivity and 

sentiment analysis. 

1 Introduction 

   Opinion mining refers to the extraction of sub-

jectivity and polarity from text (Pang and Lee, 

2005). With the growing availability and popu-

larity of opinion rich resources such as online 

review sites and personal blogs, opinion mining 

is capturing the interest of many researchers due 

to its significant role in helping people make 

their decisions (Taboada et al., 2011). Some 

opinion mining methods in English rely on the 

English lexicon SentiWordnet (ESWN) (Esuli 

and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010) 

for extracting word-level sentiment polarity. 

Some researchers used the stored positive or 

negative connotation of the words to combine 

them and derive the polarity of the text (Esuli 

and Sebastiani, 2005). 

   Recently, special interest has been given to 

mining opinion from Arabic texts, and as a re-

sult, there has also been interest in developing an 

Arabic Lexicon for word-level sentiment evalua-

tion. The availability of a large scale Arabic 

based SWN is still limited (Alhazmi et al., 2013; 

Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012; Elarnaoty et al., 

2012). In fact, there is no publicly available large 

scale Arabic sentiment lexicon similar to ESWN.  

Additionally there are limitations with existing 

Arabic lexicons including deficiency in covering 

the correct number and type of lemmas. 

   In this paper, we propose to address these chal-

lenges, and create a large-scale sentiment lexicon 

benefiting from available Arabic lexica. We 

compare two methods with an eye towards creat-

ing such resources for other Arabic dialects and 

low resource languages. One lexicon is created 

by matching Arabic WordNet (AWN) (Black et 

al., 2006) to ESWN. This path relies on the ex-

istence of a wordnet, a rather expensive resource; 

while the second lexicon is developed by match-

ing lemmas in the SAMA (Graff et al., 2009) 

lexicon to ESWN directly. This path relies on the 

existence of a mere dictionary, still expensive but 

more likely available than a wordnet. Finally, the 

combination of the two lexicons is used to create 

the proposed large-scale Arabic Sentiment Lexi-

con (ArSenL). Each lemma entry in the lexicon 

has three scores associated with the level of 

matching for each of the three sentiment labels: 

positive, negative, and objective. 

   The paper is organized as follows. A literature 

review presented in section 2 is conducted on 

work that involved developing multilingual lexi-

165



cal resources. In section 3, the steps followed to 

create ArSenL are detailed. Extrinsic evaluation 

of ArSenL is discussed in section 4. In section 5, 

we conclude our work and outline possible ex-

tensions. 

2 Literature Review 

   There have been numerous efforts for creating 

sentiment lexica in English and Arabic. Esuli and 

Sebastiani (2006) introduced English Senti-

WordNet (ESWN), a resource that associates 

synsets in the English WordNet (EWN) with 

scores for objectivity, positivity, and negativity.  

ESWN has been widely used for opinion mining 

in English (Denecke, 2008; Ohana and Tierney, 

2009). Staiano and Guerini (2014) introduced 

DepecheMood, a 37K entry lexicon assigning 

emotion scores to words. This lexicon was creat-

ed automatically by harvesting social media data 

and affective annotated data.  

   In the context of developing sentiment lexica 

and resources for Arabic, Abdul-Mageed et al. 

(2011) evaluated the use of an adjective polarity 

lexicon on a manually annotated portion of the 

Penn Arabic Treebank. They describe the pro-

cess of creating the adjective polarity lexicon 

(named SIFAAT) in Abdul-Mageed and Diab 

(2012) using a combination of manual and auto-

matic annotations. The manual annotation con-

sisted of extracting 3,982 Arabic adjectives from 

the Penn Arabic Tree (part 1) and manually la-

beling them into three tags: positive, negative or 

neutral. The automated annotation relied on the 

automatic translation of the ESWN synsets and 

glosses using Google translate. More recently, 

Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2014) extended their 

lexicons creating SANA, a subjectivity and sen-

timent lexicon for Arabic. SANA combines dif-

ferent pre-existing lexica and involves extensive 

manual annotation, automatic machine transla-

tion and statistical formulation based on point-

wise mutual information. The process also in-

volved gloss matching across several resources 

such as THARWA (Diab et al., 2014) and SA-

MA (Graff et al., 2009). SANA included 224,564 

entries which cover Modern Standard Arabic 

(MSA) as well as Egyptian and Levantine dia-

lects. These entries are not distinct and possess 

many duplicates. Through these different publi-

cations, the authors heavily rely on two types of 

techniques: manual annotations, which can be 

rather expensive (yet accurate) and automatic 

translation which is cheap (but very noisy since 

the Arabic output is not diacritized and no POS 

information was used). Their SANA lexicon has 

a mix of lemmas and inflected forms, many of 

which are not diacritized. This is not a problem 

in itself, but it limits the usability of the resource. 

That said, we use their annotated PATB corpus 

and SIFAAT lexicon for evaluating our lexicon. 

We focus on these two resources because they 

were manually created and are of good quality.   

   Alhazmi et al. (2013) linked the Arabic Word-

Net to ESWN through the provided synset offset 

information. Their approach had limited cover-

age (~10K lemmas only) and did not define a 

process for using the lexicon in practical applica-

tion given Arabic’s complex morphology. Fur-

thermore it is not yet publicly available and was 

not evaluated in the context of an application.  

In addition to English and Arabic sentiment 

lexica development, recent efforts were put to 

develop a multilingual sentiment lexicon. Chen 

and Skienna (2014) proposed an automatic ap-

proach for creating sentiment lexicons for 136 

major languages that include Arabic by integrat-

ing several resources to create a graph across 

words in different languages. The resources used 

were Wiktionary, Machine translation (Google), 

Transliteration and WordNet. They created links 

across 100,000 words by retrieving five binary 

fields using the above four resources. Then using 

a seed list obtained from Liu’s English lexicon 

(2010) the sentiment labels are propagated based 

on the links in the developed graph. The result-

ing Arabic sentiment lexicon which is of small 

size was compared to SIFAAT (Abdul-Mageed 

and Diab, 2012). 

   We are inspired by these efforts for Arabic sen-

timent lexicon creation. We extend them by 

comparing different methods for creating such a 

resource with implications for other languages.  

Our lexicon is not only large-scale with high 

coverage and high accuracy, but it is also public-

ly available. Finally, our lemma-based lexicon is 

linked to a morphological analyzer for ease of 

use in conjunction with Arabic lemmatizer such 

as MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005).  

3 Approaches to Lexicon Creation 

We define our target Arabic Sentiment Lexicon 

(or ArSenL) as a resource, pairing Arabic lem-

mas used in the morphological analyzer SAMA 

with sentiment scores such as those used in 

ESWN (positive, negative and neutral scores). 

We briefly describe next the different resources 

we use, followed by two methods for creating 

ArSenL: using an existing Arabic WordNet or 

using English glosses in a dictionary. 

166



3.1 Resources 

We rely on four existing resources to create Ar-

SenL: English WordNet (EWN), Arabic Word-

Net (AWN), English SentiWordNet (ESWN) and 

SAMA. A high level summary of characteristics 

is shown in Table 1.

English 

No N/A ~40K 

ArSenL Arabic Yes 157,969 28,760 

Table 1. The different resources used to build ArSenL. 

 

   The English WordNet (EWN) (Miller et al., 

1990) is perhaps one of the most used resources 

for English NLP. Several offset-linked versions 

of EWN have been released (2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and 

3.1). The offset is a unique identifier for a synset 

in EWN. EWN includes a dictionary augmented 

with lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy, 

etc.) and part-of-speech (POS) tags.  

   Arabic WordNet (AWN 2.0) (Black et al., 
2006) was part of a Global WordNet project 

whose aim was to develop WordNets similar to 

EWN but for different languages. AWN entries 

are connected by offsets to EWN 2.0. AWN does 

not include Arabic examples or glosses as EWN, 

but include POS tags.  

   English SentiWordNet (ESWN 3.0) (Esuli 

and Sebastiani, 2006) is a large-scale English 

Sentiment lexicon that provides for each synset 

in EWN 3.0 three sentiment scores whose sum is 

equal to 1: Pos, Neg, and Obj. ESWN has the 

same offset mappings of EWN across its differ-

ent versions.  

   Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer 

(SAMA 3.1) (Graff et al., 2009) is a commonly 

used morphological analyzer for Arabic. Each 

lemma has a POS tag and English gloss. The 

analyzer produces for a given word all of its pos-

sible readings out of context.  

3.2 Arabic WordNet-based Approach 

In this approach, we rely on the existence of a 

richly annotated resource, namely a wordnet, 

which is aligned to the ESWN. For Arabic, this 

approach requires two steps: mapping AWN to 

ESWN and mapping SAMA to AWN. The map-

ping between AWN to EWSN provides us with 

the sentiment scores and the mapping between 

AWN and SAMA provides us with the correct 

lemma forms for the words in AWN. We refer to 

the resulting lexicon as ArSenL-AWN.  

   Mapping AWN to ESWN. The entries in the 

various Wordnet resources we use are nicely 

linked through offsets to allow backward com-

patibility and linkage (see Figure 1). Figure 1 

shows the connection with a walking example 

for the word َشْعر $aEor1 ‘hair’. We use the avail-

able offset maps to link synsets in AWN 2.0 to 

those in ESWN 3.0 and thus are able to assign 

sentiment scores to the AWN 2.0 entries. We 

make use of sense map files provided by Word-

Net that connect its three different versions 2.0, 

2.1 and 3.0. Since some of the offsets were used 

to refer to different entries in WordNet, POS tags 

were also checked to validate the mapping. The 

process of aligning AWN to ESWN yielded very 

reliable links. 

We manually checked each of the 9,692 terms in 

AWN and their ESWN English complements. 

Out of the 9,692, there were only 9 AWN words 

that did not match with anything in ESWN; and 

48 entries in AWN that had no lemmas to start 

with although they were linked to ESWN. These 

terms were dropped for the next processing per-

formed. Thus, this technique only allowed us to 

line 9,635 synsets corresponding to 6,967 Arabic 

lemmas. Through this process, we noticed that 

there were no sense map files for adjectives in 

WordNet which limited the mappings performed 

in this approach to nouns and verbs only. 

Mapping SAMA to AWN. The alignment of 

Arabic lemmas in SAMA and AWN is compli-

cated due to several issues:  

a. SAMA and AWN do not always agree on 
lemma orthography, e.g., long vowel A is rep-

resented as A in SAMA and aA in AWN, and 

the two resources do not always agree on 

Hamzated Alif forms (Habash, 2010). The is-

sue of Hamzated Alif is solved by replacing it 

in both resources by the letter A. The defini-

tion of lemmas varies between the two, e.g., 

SAMA does not use the definite article in 

nouns, and uses the stem of the 3rd person 

masculine singular verb (as opposed to full 

form): katab not kataba ‘to write’. 

b. AWN has multi-word lemmas, which SAMA 
lacks.

To address these issues, we first exclude the mul-

ti-word lemmas in AWN, which account for 

1,695 lemmas out of 6,967 (24%). Of the rest, 

exact matching against SAMA yields pairings for 

1,736 lemmas. After applying a set of ortho-

graphic and lemma-form normalization rules as 

indicated in Table 2, exact matching yields addi-

tional 1927 lemma matches. Finally, we back off 

to using the SAMA morphological analyzer on 

AWN terms and selecting the lemma with the 

lowest edit distance. This step adds 1,094 lemma 

matches. Overall, 7,326 synsets entries corre-

sponding to 5,002 lemmas in AWN are linked to 

4,507 lemmas in SAMA. The linked lemmas ac-

count for 95% of all single word lemmas in 

AWN, but only correspond to 12% of SAMA 

lemmas. Moreover, we manually validated the 

mapping between SAMA and AWN lemmas, 

specifically the ones that were mapped using 

SAMA back off with minimum edit distance 

computation. 10% were not correct matches.  We 

corrected them and created a gold reference for 

the lexicon, which we use in the evaluation sec-

tion. In Table 3, we report some entries that were 

mapped wrongly between AWN and SAMA and 

which were removed from the lexicon.

3.3 English Gloss-based Approach 

In this approach, we make use of the English 

glosses associated with the SAMA lemma en-

tries. For each entry, we find the synset in 

ESWN with the highest overlap in SAMA Eng-

lish glosses. A walking example of the described 

method is shown in Figure 2. The recall of the 

SAMA gloss is used as a confidence measure of 

the mapping.  We refer to the resulting lexicon as 

ArSenL-Eng. 

Each lemma in SAMA is appended with a gloss 

list that varies in size from 1 up to 6 words. Let n 

denote the number of words available in the 

gloss list. We first attempt to match all the words 

in the list to the glosses of each entry in ESWN. 

If one or more matches are found, the scores are 

retrieved and a new entry in SAMA is processed 

as described. In case there were no matches, we 

try to find an overlap between a combination of 

n-1 words of the SAMA gloss list and the glosses 

of ESWN. If one or more matches are found, the 

scores are retrieved and each match is recorded 

in ArSenL-Eng. Again, if no matches were ob-

tained, the same process is repeated for the com-

bination of n-2 words of the SAMA gloss list.

Table 5. Sizes of the created sentiment lexica.  

This procedure is followed until we span all the 

words in the gloss list. As the number of words 

used in the combination to check for overlap be-

tween the two resources decreases, the confi-

dence percentage decreases. In ArSenL-Eng, the 

confidence measure is equal to the ratio of the 

number of words overlapping between SAMA 

and ESWN over the total number of words avail-

able in the gloss list of the corresponding SAMA 

entry. Besides checking the overlap of glosses, 

POS tags are also used to make sure that verbs 

are not mapped to nouns and vice versa. This 

technique results in mapping 150,700 ESWN 

169



synsets corresponding to 28,540 distinct lemmas 

in SAMA (76%). The validation of ArSenL-Eng 

was performed (a) automatically by using Ar-

SenL-AWN and (b) manually by randomly vali-

dating 400 distinct lemmas. For the automated 

part, we check for each common lemma between 

the two lexicons if the sentiment scores match. A 

total of 3,833 lemmas (out of 4,507) from Ar-

SenL-AWN were matched in ArSenL-Eng. 

Thus, we can inspect that the precision of the 

remaining scores is of 85%. For the manual vali-

dation, we check if the meaning of the SAMA 

lemma corresponds to the one in ESWN. 70% of 

the 400 randomly selected lemmas were accu-

rately mapped to ESWN. The main issue of the 

remaining 30% is the unavailability of enough 

glosses per SAMA lemma, which makes the 

connection weaker. This approach did not in-

volve manual correction and the lemma numbers 

are reported in row 4 of Table 5 along with their 

corresponding number of related synsets. 

3.4 Combining the Two Approaches 

We combine the two lexica created above by tak-

ing their union. We refer to the resulting lexicon 

as ArSenL. The details of the sizes of the three 

lexica are shown in Table 5.  

The union of the two lexicons consisted of com-

bining the two resources and adding a field in the 

lexicon to distinguish the original source of the 

entry. For instance, an entry from the first ap-

proach, i.e. ArSenL-AWN, will have an AWN 

offset while an entry in ArSenL-Eng will have 

the same field set to N.A (Not Available). Fur-

thermore, due to manual correction performed to 

ArSenL-AWN, the gold version of the union lex-

icon includes 28,780 lemmas with the corre-

sponding number of 157,969 synsets. 

A public interface to browsing ArSenL is availa-

ble at http://oma-project.com. The interface al-

lows the user to search for an Arabic word. The 

output would show the different scores for the 

Arabic word along with the corresponding sen-

timent scores, English glosses and examples that 

help in disambiguating different sentiment scores 

for the same Arabic lemma. Work is also being 

done to allow searching for English words and 

finding the corresponding Arabic words. Snap-

shot of the homepage is shown in Figure 3. 

4 Evaluation 

We conduct an extrinsic evaluation to compare 

the different versions of ArSenL on the task of 

subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA). We 

also compare the performance of the SIFAAT 

lexicon (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011) discussed in 

Section 2. 

Experimental Settings We perform our experi-

ments on the same corpus used by Abdul-

Mageed et al. (2011). The corpus consists of 400 

documents form the Penn Arabic Treebank (part 

1 version 3) that are gold segmented and lemma-

tized. The sentences are tagged as objective, sub-

jective-positive, subjective-negative and subjec-

tive-neutral.  

Figure 3. Homepage of the lexicon interface and 

snapshots of examples searched through the interface. 

Positive, negative and objective scores are represented 

in green, red and gray respectively. 

We use nonlinear SVM implementation in 

MATLAB, with the radial basis function (RBF) 

kernel, to evaluate the different lexicons in the 

context of SSA. The classification model is de-

veloped in two steps. In the first step, the kernel 

parameters (kernel’s width 𝛾  and regularization 
parameter 𝐶) are selected, and in the second step 
the classification model is developed and evalu-

170



ated based on the selected parameters. To decide 

on the choice of RBF kernel parameters, we use 

the first 80% of the dataset to tune the kernel pa-

rameters to the values that produce the best F1-

score using 5-fold cross-validation. The resulting 

parameters are then used to develop and evaluate 

the SVM model using 5-fold cross-validation on 

the whole dataset. 

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the 

impact of the different lexicons on opinion min-

ing. The first experiment considers subjectivity 

classification where sentences are classified as 

either subjective or objective. In this experiment, 

the SVM kernel parameters were tuned to max-

imize the F1-score for predicting subjective sen-

tences. The second experiment considers senti-

ment classification, where only subjective sen-

tences are classified as either positive or negative. 

Subjective-neutral sentences are ignored. In this 

experiment, the classifier’s parameters are tuned 

to maximize the average F1-score of positive and 

negative labels. We report the performance 

measures of the individual classes, as well as 

their average. 

For baseline comparison, the majority class is 

chosen in each of the experiments, where all sen-

tences are assigned to the majority class. For 

subjective versus objective baseline classification, 

all sentences were classified as subjective since 

the majority (55.1%) of the sentences were sub-

jective. To further emphasize the importance of 

detecting subjectivity, we chose the F1-score for 

subjective as baseline. For positive versus nega-

tive baseline classification, all sentences were 

classified as negative since the majority (58.4%) 

of the dataset was annotated as negative. The 

resulting baseline performance measures are cap-

tured in Table 6, and serve as basis for compari-

son with our developed models. For the subjec-

tive versus objective the baseline F1-score is 

71.1%, and for positive versus negative, the 

baseline F1-score is averaged as 36.9%. 

Features We train the SVM classifier using sen-

tence vectors consisting of three numerical fea-

tures that reflect the sentiments expressed in each 

sentence, namely positivity, negativity and ob-

jectivity. The value of each feature is calculated 

by matching the lemmas in each sentence to each 

of the lexicons separately: ArSenL-AWN, Ar-

SenL-Eng, ArSenL-Union and SIFAAT. The 

corresponding scores are then accumulated and 

normalized by the length of the sentence. We 

remove all stop words in the process. For words 

that occur in the lexicon multiple times, the aver-

age sentiment score is used. It is worth noting 

that the choice of aggregation for the different 

scores and the choice of nonlinear SVM was 

concluded after a set of experiments, but not re-

ported in the paper. In this regards, we conducted 

a suite of experiments to evaluate the impact of 

using: (a) linear versus Gaussian nonlinear SVM 

kernels, (b) normalization based on sentence 

length, (c) normalization using z-score versus not, 

and (d) using the confidence score from the lexi-

by the lexicons, without considering the baseline 

Results Three evaluations were conducted to 

compare the performances of the developed sen-

timent lexicons. The results of the experiments 

are shown in Table 6. First, we evaluate the cov-

erage of the different lexicons. We define cover-

age as the percentage of lemmas (excluding stop 

words) covered by each lexicon. ArSenL-AWN 

and SIFAAT have lower coverage than the Ar-

SenL-Eng lexicon. The union lexicon has the 

highest coverage. This is normally due to the 

larger number of lemmas included in the English 

and union lexicons, as shown in Table 5. 

In subjectivity classification, ArSenL lexicons 

perform better than the majority baseline and 

outperform SIFAAT in terms of F1-score. Over-

all, the developed ArSenL-Union gives the best 

performance among all lexicons. The only ex-

ception of better performance for SIFAAT for 

subjectivity is in terms of precision, which is as-

sociated with a much lower recall resulting in an 

F1-score that is lower than that of ArSenL’s.

Similarly, sentiment classification experiment 

reveals that ArSenL lexicons produce results that 

are consistently better than SIFAAT and the ma-

jority baseline. The ArSenL-Union lexicon out-

performs all lexicons in all measures without 

exceptions. 

In summary, it can be observed that the English-

based lexicon produces results that are superior 

to the AWN-based lexicon. Combining both re-

sources, through the union, allows further im-

provement in SSA performance. It is also worth 

noting that the English and union lexicons con-

sistently outperform SIFAAT despite the fact 

that the latter was manually derived from the 

same corpus we are using for evaluation. We 

close by showing examples of ArSenL in Table 7.  

The lemmas are in their Buckwalter (2004) for-

mat for easier integration in any NLP task. The 

word NA stands for Not Applicable. In the case 

where AWN Offset is NA and AWN lemma is 

NA, this means that the entry is retrieved from 

ArSenL-Eng. Otherwise, the entries are from 

ArSenL-AWN. The additions to the lemmas such 

as “_v1AR” , “_n1AR”, “_1” or “_2” can be 

dropped when data processing is performed. 

They were kept for easier retrieval in the original 

sources (AWN and SAMA). We added the “Eng-

lish Gloss” field for easier understanding of the 

Arabic word in the table. Moreover, it can be 

seen that only positive and negative scores are 

reported in the lexicon since the objective score 

can be easily derived by subtracting the sum of 

positive and negative scores from 1. 
 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 

We create a large sentiment lexicon for Arabic 

sentiments using different approaches linking to 

ESWN.  We compared the two methods. Our 

results show that using English-based linking 

produces, on average, superior performance in 

comparison to using the WordNet-based ap-

proach. A union of the two resources is better 

than either and outperforms a high-quality manu-

ally-derived adjective sentiment lexicon for Ara-

bic. 

In the future, we plan to make use of this lexicon 

to develop more powerful SSA systems. We also 

plan to extend the effort to Arabic dialects and 

other languages.
