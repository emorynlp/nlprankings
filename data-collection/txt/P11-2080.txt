Abstract
We introduce two simple improvements to the
lexical weighting features of Koehn, Och, and
Marcu  (2003)  for  machine  translation: one
which  smooths  the  probability  of  translating
word f to word e by simplifying English mor-
phology, and one which conditions it  on the
kind of training data that f and e co-occurred
in. These new variations lead to improvements
of up to +0.8 BLEU, with an average improve-
ment of +0.6 BLEU across two language pairs,
two genres, and two translation systems.

1 Introduction
Lexical weighting features (Koehn et al., 2003) es-
timate the probability of a phrase pair or translation
rule word-by-word. In this paper, we introduce two
simple improvements to these features: one which
smooths  the  probability  of  translating  word f to
word e using English morphology, and one which
conditions it on the kind of training data that f and
e co-occurred in. These new variations lead to im-
provements of up to+0.8 BLEU, with an average im-
provement of +0.6 BLEU across two language pairs,
two genres, and two translation systems.

2 Background
Since there  are  slight  variations  in  how the  lexi-
cal weighting features are computed, we begin by
defining the baseline lexical weighting features. If
f = f1 · · · fn and e = e1 · · · em are a training sentence
pair, let ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the (possibly empty) set of
positions in f that ei is aligned to.

First, compute a word translation table from the
word-aligned parallel text: for each sentence pair and

each i, let

c( f j, ei)← c( f j, ei) +
1
|ai|

for j ∈ ai (1)
c(NULL, ei)← c(NULL, ei) + 1 if |ai| = 0 (2)

Then

t(e | f ) = c( f , e)∑
e c( f , e)

(3)

where f can be NULL.
Second, during phrase-pair extraction, store with

each phrase pair the alignments between the words
in the phrase pair. If it is observed with more than
one word alignment pattern, store the most frequent
pattern.

Third, for each phrase pair ( f̄ , ē, a), compute

t(ē | f̄ ) =
|ē|∏

i=1


1
|ai|
∑
j∈ai

t(ēi | f̄ j) if |ai| > 0

t(ēi | NULL) otherwise
(4)

This generalizes to synchronous CFG rules in the ob-
vious way.

Similarly, compute the reverse probability t( f̄ | ē).
Then add two new model features

− log t(ē | f̄ ) and − log t( f̄ | ē)

translation
feature (7) (8)
small LM 26.7 24.3
large LM 31.4 28.2
− log t(ē | f̄ ) 9.3 9.9
− log t( f̄ | ē) 5.8 6.3

Table 1: Although the language models prefer translation
(8), which translates 朋友 and 伙伴 as singular nouns, the
lexical weighting features prefer translation (7), which in-
correctly generates plural nouns. All features are negative
log-probabilities, so lower numbers indicate preference.

3 Morphological smoothing
Consider the following example Chinese sentence:
(5) 温家宝

Wēn Jiābǎo
Wen Jiabao

表示

biǎoshì
said

,

,
,

科特迪瓦

Kētèdíwǎ
Côte d’Ivoire

是

shì
is

中国

Zhōngguó
China

在

zài

非洲

Fēizhōu
Africa

的

de
’s

好

hǎo
good

朋友

péngyǒu
friend

,

,
,

好

hǎo
good

伙伴

huǒbàn
partner

.

.

.
(6) Human: Wen Jiabao said that Côte d’Ivoire is

a good friend and a good partner of China’s in
Africa.

(7) MT (baseline): Wen  Jiabao  said  that  Cote
d’Ivoire  is  China’s  good friends, and  good
partners in Africa.

(8) MT (better): Wen Jiabao said that Cote d’Ivoire
is  China’s  good friend and  good partner in
Africa.

The baseline machine translation (7) incorrectly gen-
erates plural nouns. Even though the language mod-
els (LMs) prefer singular nouns, the lexical weight-
ing features prefer plural nouns (Table 1).1

The reason for this is that the Chinese words do not
have any marking for number. Therefore the infor-
mation needed to mark friend and partner for num-
ber must come from the context. The LMs are able
to capture this context: the 5-gram is China’s good

1The presence of an extra comma in translation (7) affects
the LM scores only slightly; removing the comma would make
them 26.4 and 32.0.

f e t(e | f ) t( f | e) tm(e | f ) tm( f | e)
朋友 friends 0.44 0.44 0.47 0.48
朋友 friend 0.21 0.58 0.19 0.48
伙伴 partners 0.44 0.60 0.40 0.53
伙伴 partner 0.13 0.40 0.17 0.53

Table 2: The morphologically-smoothed lexical weight-
ing features weaken the preference for singular or plural
translations, with the exception of t(friends | 朋友).

friend is observed in our large LM, and the 4-gram
China’s good friend in our small LM, but China’s
good friends is not observed in either LM. Likewise,
the 5-grams good friend and good partner and good
friends and good partners are both observed in our
LMs, but neither good friend and good partners nor
good friends and good partner is.

By contrast, the lexical weighting tables (Table 2,
columns 3–4), which ignore context, have a strong
preference for plural translations, except in the case
of t(朋友 | friend). Therefore  we hypothesize  that,
for Chinese-English translation, we should weaken
the lexical weighting features’ morphological pref-
erences so that more contextual features can do their
work.

Running a morphological stemmer (Porter, 1980)
on  the  English  side  of  the  parallel  data  gives  a
three-way parallel text: for each sentence, we have
French f, English e, and stemmed English e′. We can
then build two word translation tables, t(e′ | f ) and
t(e | e′), and form their product

tm(e | f ) =
∑

e′
t(e′ | f )t(e | e′) (9)

Similarly, we can compute tm( f | e) in the opposite
direction.2 (See Table 2, columns 5–6.) These tables
can then be extended to phrase pairs or synchronous
CFG rules as before and added as two new features
of the model:

− log tm(ē | f̄ ) and − log tm( f̄ | ē)
The feature tm(ē | f̄ ) does still prefer certain word-

forms, as can be seen in Table 2. But because e is
generated from e′ and not from f , we are protected
from the situation where a rare f leads to poor esti-
mates for the e.

2Since the Porter stemmer is deterministic, we always have
t(e′ | e) = 1.0, so that tm( f | e) = t( f | e′), as seen in the last
column of Table 2.

When  we  applied  an  analogous  approach  to
Arabic-English translation, stemming  both  Arabic
and English, we generated very large lexicon tables,
but saw no statistically significant change in BLEU.
Perhaps this is  not surprising, because  in  Arabic-
English translation (unlike Chinese-English transla-
tion), the source language is morphologically richer
than the target language. So we may benefit from fea-
tures that preserve this information, while smoothing
over morphological differences blurs important dis-
tinctions.

4 Conditioning on provenance
Typical machine translation systems are trained on
a fixed set of training data ranging over a variety of
genres, and if the genre of an input sentence is known
in advance, it is usually advantageous to use model
parameters tuned for that genre.

Consider the following Arabic sentence, from a
weblog (words written left-to-right):
(10) ولعل

wlEl
perhaps

ھذا
h*A
this

احد
AHd
one

اھم
Ahm
main

الفروق
Alfrwq
differences

بین
byn
between

صور
Swr
images

انظمة
AnZmp
systems

الحكم
AlHkm
ruling

المقترحة
AlmqtrHp
proposed

.

.

.
(11) Human: Perhaps this is one of the most impor-

tant differences between the images of the pro-
posed ruling systems.

(12) MT (baseline): This may be one of the most
important differences between pictures of the
proposed ruling regimes.

(13) MT (better): Perhaps this is one of the most im-
portant differences between the images of the
proposed regimes.

The Arabic word ولعل can be translated as may or per-
haps (among others), with the latter more common
according to t(e | f ), as shown in Table 3. But some
genres favor perhaps more or less strongly. Thus,
both translations (12) and (13) are good, but the lat-
ter uses a slightly more informal register appropriate
to the genre.

Following Matsoukas et al. (2009), we assign each
training sentence pair a set of binary features which
we call s-features:

t(e | f ) ts(e | f )
f e – nw web bn un

ولعل may 0.13 0.12 0.16 0.09 0.13
ولعل perhaps 0.20 0.23 0.32 0.42 0.19

Table 3: Different genres have different preferences for
word translations. Key: nw = newswire, web = Web, bn =
broadcast news, un = United Nations proceedings.

• Whether the sentence pair came from a particu-
lar genre, for example, newswire or web
• Whether the sentence pair came from a particu-

lar collection, for example, FBIS or UN
Matsoukas et  al. (2009)  use these s-features  to

compute  weights  for  each  training  sentence  pair,
which are in turn used for computing various model
features. They found that the sentence-level weights
were most helpful for computing the lexical weight-
ing  features  (p.c.). The  mapping  from  s-features
to  sentence  weights  was  chosen  to  optimize  ex-
pected TER on held-out data. A drawback of this
method is that we must now learn the mapping from
s-features to sentence-weights and then the model
feature weights. Therefore, we tried an alternative
that incorporates s-features into the model itself.

For each s-feature s, we compute new word trans-
lation tables ts(e | f ) and ts( f | e) estimated from
only those sentence pairsf on which s fires, and ex-
tend them to phrases/rules as before. The idea is to
use these probabilities as new features in the model.
However, two  challenges  arise: first, many  word
pairs are unseen for a given s, resulting in zero or
undefined probabilities; second, this adds many new
features for each rule, which requires a lot of space.

To address the problem of unseen word pairs, we
use Witten-Bell smoothing (Witten and Bell, 1991):

t̂s(e | f ) = λ f sts(e | f ) + (1 − λ f s)t(e | f ) (14)
λ f s =

c( f , s)
c( f , s) + d( f , s)

(15)

where c( f , s) is the number of times f has been ob-
served in sentences with s-feature s, and d( f , s) is the
number of e types observed aligned to f in sentences
with s-feature s.

For each s-feature s, we add two model features

− log t̂s(ē | f̄ )
t(ē | f̄ )

and − log t̂s( f̄ | ē)
t( f̄ | ē)

Table 4: Our variations on lexical weighting improve translation quality significantly across 16 different test conditions.
All improvements are significant at the p < 0.01 level, except where marked with an asterisk (∗), indicating p < 0.05.

In order to address the space problem, we use the
following heuristic: for any given rule, if the absolute
value of one of these features is less than log 2, we
discard it for that rule.

5 Experiments
Setup We  tested  these  features  on  two  ma-
chine  translation  systems: a  hierarchical  phrase-
based (string-to-string) system (Chiang, 2005) and
a syntax-based (string-to-tree) system (Galley et al.,
2004; Galley et al., 2006). For Arabic-English trans-
lation, both systems were trained on 190+220 mil-
lion words of parallel data; for Chinese-English, the
string-to-string system was trained on 240+260 mil-
lion words of parallel data, and the string-to-tree sys-
tem, 58+65 million words. Both used two language
models, one trained on the combined English sides
of the Arabic-English and Chinese-English data, and
one trained on 4 billion words of English data.

The baseline string-to-string system already incor-
porates some simple provenance features: for each
s-feature s, there is a feature P(s | rule). Both base-
line also include a variety of other features (Chiang
et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010).

Both systems were trained using MIRA (Cram-
mer et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al.,
2008) on a held-out set, then tested on two more sets
(Dev and Test) disjoint from the data used for rule
extraction and for  MIRA training. These datasets
have roughly 1000–3000 sentences (30,000–70,000
words) and are drawn from test sets from the NIST
MT evaluation and development sets from the GALE
program.
Individual  tests We  first  tested  morphological
smoothing  using  the  string-to-string  system  on
Chinese-English  translation. The  morphologically

smoothed system generated the improved translation
(8) above, and generally gave a small improvement:

task features Dev
Chi-Eng nw baseline 28.7

morph 29.1
We then tested the provenance-conditioned fea-

tures on both Arabic-English and Chinese-English,
again using the string-to-string system:

task features Dev
Ara-Eng nw baseline 47.1

(Matsoukas et al., 2009) 47.3
provenance2 47.7

Chi-Eng nw baseline 28.7
provenance2 29.4

The  translations  (12)  and  (13)  come  from  the
Arabic-English baseline and provenance systems.
For Arabic-English, we also compared against lex-
ical  weighting  features  that  use  sentence  weights
kindly provided to us by Matsoukas et al. Our fea-
tures performed better, although it should be noted
that those sentence weights had been optimized for
a different translation model.
Combined  tests Finally, we  tested  the  features
across a wider range of tasks. For Chinese-English
translation, we  combined  the  morphologically-
smoothed  and  provenance-conditioned  lexical
weighting  features; for  Arabic-English, we  con-
tinued  to  use  only  the  provenance-conditioned
features. We  tested  using  both  systems, and  on
both  newswire  and  web  genres. The  results  are
shown in Table 4. The features produce statistically
significant improvements across all 16 conditions.

2In these systems, an error crippled the t( f | e), tm( f | e), and
ts( f | e) features. Time did not permit rerunning all of these sys-
tems with the error fixed, but partial results suggest that it did
not have a significant impact.

Figure 1: Feature  weights  for  provenance-conditioned  features: string-to-string, Chinese-English, web  versus
newswire. A higher weight indicates a more useful source of information, while a negative weight indicates a less
useful or possibly problematic source. For clarity, only selected points are labeled. The diagonal line indicates where
the two weights would be equal relative to the original t(e | f ) feature weight.

Figure 1 shows the feature weights obtained for
the provenance-conditioned features ts( f | e) in the
string-to-string Chinese-English system, trained on
newswire and web data. On the diagonal are cor-
pora that were equally useful in either genre. Surpris-
ingly, the UN data received strong positive weights,
indicating usefulness in both genres. Two lists  of
named entities received large weights: the LDC list
(LDC2005T34)  in  the  positive  direction  and  the
NewsExplorer  list  in  the  negative  direction, sug-
gesting  that  there  are  noisy  entries  in  the  latter.
The corpus LDC2007E08, which contains parallel
data mined from comparable corpora (Munteanu and
Marcu, 2005), received strong negative weights.

Off the diagonal are corpora favored in only one
genre or the other: above, we see that the wl (we-
blog)  and ng (newsgroup)  genres  are  more help-
ful for web translation, as expected (although web
oddly seems less helpful), as well as LDC2006G05
(LDC/FBIS/NVTC Parallel Text V2.0). Below are
corpora  more  helpful  for  newswire  translation,
like LDC2005T06 (Chinese News Translation Text
Part 1).

6 Conclusion
Many  different  approaches  to  morphology  and
provenance in machine translation are possible. We
have chosen to implement our approach as exten-
sions  to  lexical  weighting  (Koehn  et  al., 2003),
which is nearly ubiquitous, because it is defined at
the level of word alignments. For this reason, the
features we have introduced should be easily ap-
plicable to a wide range of phrase-based, hierarchi-
cal phrase-based, and syntax-based systems. While
the improvements obtained using them are not enor-
mous, we have demonstrated that they help signif-
icantly across many different conditions, and over
very strong baselines. We therefore fully expect that
these  new  features  would  yield  similar  improve-
ments in other systems as well.
