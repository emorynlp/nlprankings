Abstract

Hashtags in Twitter posts may carry dif-
ferent semantic payloads. Their dual form
(word and label) may serve to categorize
the tweet, but may also add content to the
message, or strengthen it. Some hash-
tags are related to emotions. In a study
on emotional hashtags in Dutch Twitter
posts we employ machine learning classi-
fiers to test to what extent tweets that are
stripped from their hashtag could be re-
assigned to this hashtag. About half of the
24 tested hashtags can be predicted with
AUC scores of .80 or higher. However,
when we apply the three best-performing
classifiers to unseen tweets that do not
carry the hashtag but might have carried
it according to human annotators, the clas-
sifiers manage to attain a precision-at-250
of .7 for only two of the hashtags. We ob-
serve that some hashtags are predictable
from their tweets, and strengthen the emo-
tion already expressed in the tweets. Other
hashtags are added to messages that do not
predict them, presumably to provide emo-
tional information that was not yet in the
tweet.

1 Introduction

Since the launch of Twitter in 2006 the microblog-
ging service has proven to be a valuable source of
research on the linguistic expression of sentiment
and affect. Sentiments and emotions are impor-
tant aspects of status updates and conversations in
Twitter messages (Ritter et al., 2010; Dann, 2010).
Many Twitter messages (tweets) express an emo-
tion of the sender: according to Roberts et al.
(2012), 43 percent of the 7,000 tweets they col-
lected are an emotional expression. Automatically
detecting the emotion in tweets is key to under-

stand the sentiment underlying real world events
and topics.

Potentially, Twitter offers a vast amount of data
to exploit for the construction of computational
models able to detect certain sentiments or emo-
tions in unseen tweets. Yet, in the typical scenario
of applying supervised machine learning classi-
fiers, some annotation effort will be required to
label sentiments and emotions reliably. Currently
there are two main approaches to labeling tweets.
The first is the annotation of data by human ex-
perts (Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakowicz,
2007). This approach is known to result in high-
precision annotated data, but is labor-intensive and
time-consuming.

The second approach is to use the annotations
that Twitter users themselves add to a tweet: hash-
tags. A hashtag (a word prefixed by the typograph-
ical hashmark #) is an explicitly marked keyword
that may also serve as a word in the context of
the other non-tagged words of the post. The us-
age of a hashtag in Twitter serves many purposes
beyond mere categorization, most of which are
conversational (Huang et al., 2010). Hashtags ex-
pressing emotions are often used in tweets and are
therefore potentially useful annotations for train-
ing data. Wang et al. (2012) state that annotating
interpretative labels by humans other than the au-
thor is not as reliable as having the data annotated
by the author himself. As far as emotions can be
self-observed and self-reported, authors arguably
have the best information about their own emo-
tions. Following González-Ibáñez et al. (2011),
Mohammad (2012) presents several experiments
to validate that the emotional labels in tweets are
consistent and match intuitions of trained judges.

Therefore, using hashtags as annotated training
data may be useful for generating emotion detec-
tors. Yet, not all hashtags are equally suitable for
this task. Even a high level of consistency and pre-
dictability in hashtag usage might not be sufficient.

26



Mohammad (2012) argues that emotion hashtags
are included in tweets by users in two different
ways. First, the hashtag can strengthen the emo-
tion already present in the tweet. By adding the
hashtag in for example ‘I hate making homework
#fml’ (#fml is an acronym for ‘fuck my life’), the
sender reflects on his own negative message and
strengthens it with an abbreviated expletive.

Second, the hashtag can add emotion to the
message in order to avoid miscommunication.
Lacking the richness of non-verbal cues in face-to-
face communication, as well as the space to elab-
orate, attenuate, or add nuance, users of Twitter
might deploy hashtags to signify the intention or
emotion of their message. In the expression ‘Mak-
ing homework #fml’ for example, a Twitter user
adds sentiment to the message to clarify his nega-
tive attitude towards the described activity. Mo-
hammad (2012, p. 248) formulates the second
function of a hashtag as follows: ‘reading just the
message before the hashtag does not convey the
emotions of the tweeter. Here, the hashtag pro-
vides information not present (implicitly or explic-
itly) in the rest of the message.’

Arguably, hashtags that are most often used to
add emotion to an otherwise emotionally neutral
message (the second function) will not provide
proper training data for the detection of the emo-
tion linked to the hashtag; only examples of the
first function may serve that purpose. As this in-
formation is not explicit, the suitability of a hash-
tag as an emotion label needs to be revealed in
another way. We propose an automatic method
that uses machine-learning-based text classifica-
tion. We put this method into practice for a
number of hashtags expressing emotion in Dutch
tweets. The novel contribution of this research lies
in the fact that we offer an objective, empirical
handle of the two usages of emotion hashtags as
formulated by Mohammad (2012). Furthermore,
we exemplify a new type of study that tests our
hypothesis in the realistic scenario of testing on a
full day of streaming tweets with no filtering.

2 Related research

Leveraging uncontrolled labeling to obtain large
amounts of training data is referred to as distant
supervision (Mintz et al., 2009). With its con-
ventions for hashtags as extra-linguistic markers,
Twitter is a potentially suitable platform for im-
plementing classification based on distant super-

vision. In the field of sentiment analysis, Pak
and Paroubek (2010) and Go, Bhayani and Huang
(2009) select emoticons representing positive and
negative sentiment to collect tweets with either of
the polarities. Several studies focusing on the spe-
cific task of emotion detection in Twitter also ap-
ply distant supervision. The studies in which it
is applied vary in a number of ways. First, the
type of markers by which data is collected dif-
fers. Most often only hashtags are used, occa-
sionally combined with emoticons. Davidov, Tsur
and Rappoport (2010) use hashtags and emoticons
as distinct prediction labels and find that they are
equally useful. Suttles and Ide (2013) compare the
usage of hashtags, emoticons, and emoji1, and find
that emoji form a valuable addition.

Second, the selection of emotions and mark-
ers differs. In many of the studies a predefined
set of emotions form the starting point for the se-
lection of markers and collection of data. Emo-
tions can be classified according to a set of basic
emotions, such as Ekman’s (Ekman, 1971) six ba-
sic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, sur-
prise, and disgust), or the bipolar emotions defined
by Plutchik’s wheel of emotions (Plutchik, 1980)
which are based on the basic emotions anger, fear,
sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and
joy. The majority of the studies rely on such cat-
egorizations (Mohammad, 2012; Suttles and Ide,
2013; Wang et al., 2012).

In spite of the interesting findings in such stud-
ies, basic emotions do not tell the whole story;
tweets may contain multiple basic emotions com-
bining into more complex emotions (Roberts et al.,
2012; Kamvar and Harris, 2011). Furthermore,
by selecting a set of hashtags that are assumed to
match the same emotion, the potential variation in
the usage of specific hashtags by users is ignored.
A different approach is to select single hashtags
expressing emotion as starting points, regardless
of their theoretical status. Davidov et.al. (2010)
select frequent hashtags from a large twitter cor-
pus and let annotators judge the strength of their
sentiment. The fifty hashtags with the strongest
sentiment are used as label. In our research, we
also single out hashtags, focusing on a set of hash-
tags that are linked to emotions, some of which are
complex.

Third, the way in which a classifier is trained
and tested differs. In some studies multi-class

1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

27



classification is performed, distinguishing the dif-
ferent target emotions and optionally an emotion-
ally neutral class (Purver and Battersby, 2012;
Wang et al., 2012). The multitude of classes, class
imbalance, and the possibility of single tweets
conveying multiple emotions make this a challeng-
ing task. The alternative is to train a binary clas-
sifier for each emotion (Mohammad, 2012; Qadir
and Riloff, 2013; Suttles and Ide, 2013), decid-
ing for each unseen tweet whether it conveys the
trained emotion. We apply the latter type of clas-
sification.

The fourth and final variation is the way in
which classification is evaluated. In the discussed
papers, evaluation is either performed in a ten-fold
cross-validation setting or by testing the trained
classifier on a small, manually annotated set of
tweets. We deviate from these approaches by test-
ing our classifiers on a large set of uncontrolled
tweets gathered in a single day, thereby approx-
imating the real world scenario in which emo-
tion detection is applied to the stream of incoming
tweets.

3 Approach

Our approach is to train a machine learning classi-
fier on tweets containing an emotion-bearing hash-
tag and an equal amount of random tweets as
counter-examples, resulting in a balanced binary
classifier for the hashtag (which itself is stripped
from the tweet and purely considered as a label).
The classifier is then run on a large sample of
tweets, deciding which of the tweets might fit the
target hashtag. As some of these test tweets ac-
tually contain the hashtag, a first evaluation is to
score the amount of tweets of which the hashtag
is correctly predicted by the classifier, when this
hashtag is hidden from the classifier. Second, the
tweets not containing the hashtag can be ranked
by classifier confidence for the hashtag class, af-
ter which the 250 highest ranked tweets are scored
by human annotators, who judge whether these
tweets convey the emotion that is linked to the
hashtag.

This approach is based on the assumption that
a hashtag as a label for emotion detection requires
two relations between the hashtag and the text with
which it co-occurs in tweets:

1. The context in which users include the hash-
tag is to a certain extent consistent with the
hashtag. In other words, the context (the

tweet) would predict the hashtag. If this is
the case, our classifier should score well on
the retrieval of unseen tweets containing the
hashtag (the first evaluation). Consistency
can arise from many different types of fea-
tures, ranging from topical words to emotion-
bearing words.

2. The emotion that is denoted by the hashtag
should be reflected in the words surrounding
it. Hashtags that add emotion to an otherwise
neutral message are inappropriate as annota-
tion label for emotion detection. By evalu-
ating retrieved tweets that do not contain the
hashtag on the conveyed emotion (instead of
their possible fit with the hashtag) we can
score to what extent the classifier trained a
model of the emotion in tweets successfully.

Note that hashtags that add a specific emotion to
otherwise unemotional tweets are good indicators
themselves for detecting emotion in Twitter. Our
goal, however, is to create generalizable models
of emotion in Twitter that are not restricted to the
occurrence of a hashtag.

4 Experimental setup

4.1 Data collection
As a starting point of our experiments we se-
lected 24 hashtags used in Dutch tweets. The se-
lection was inspired on a list of the 2,500 most
frequent hashtags in 2011 and 2012, generated
from twiqs.nl, a database of Dutch tweets from
December 2010 onwards (Tjong Kim Sang and
van den Bosch, 2013). Typically, emotion hash-
tags are not linked to any specific point in time,
and therefore surface in such a list generated from
an extended period of tweets.

To create the training data, tweets contain-
ing any of the hashtags were collected through
twiqs.nl from the time frame of December
2010 up and until January 2013.

We queried a large sample of Dutch tweets
(3,144,781) posted on February 1st 2013, a small
portion of which was used as negative examples
for our training data, and the rest was used as test
data.

4.2 Classification
For each of the hashtags, training data was gener-
ated by balancing the amount of collected tweets
containing the hashtag with an equal amount of

28



randomly selected tweets (not containing the hash-
tag) drawn from the set of tweets collected on
February 1st, 2013. The resulting binary classi-
fier was tested on the remainder of tweets in this
set.

The tweets were pre-processed by extracting
word unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as features.
We maintained capitalization and included punc-
tuation and emoticons as tokens in the n-grams, as
we expected such tokens to have predictive power
in the context of emotions. Both usernames and
URLs were normalized to dummy values. All fea-
tures containing a target hashtag were removed.

Classification was performed by the Balanced
Winnow algorithm (Littlestone, 1988). This algo-
rithm is known to offer state-of-the-art results in
text classification, and produces interpretable per-
class weights that can be used to, for example, in-
spect the highest-ranking features for one class la-
bel. The α and β parameters were set to 1,05 and
0,95 respectively. The major threshold (θ+) and
the minor threshold (θ−) were set to 2,5 and 0,5.
The number of iterations was bounded to a maxi-
mum of three.

4.3 Evaluation

Performance was evaluated by classifying all test
tweets and counting the number of tweets with
the target hashtag that were positively classified
as such, deriving a true positive rate (recall), false
positive rate, and area under the curve (AUC)
score (Fawcett, 2004).

While this first evaluation gives an indication
of the predictability of any hashtag, the ultimate
value of a hashtag for emotion detection can be
scored by assessing the emotion in positively clas-
sified tweets that do not contain the hashtag. This
is done by manually annotating the fraction of
these tweets that are most confidently positively
ranked by the hashtag classifier, as containing the
emotion signalled by the hashtag. Three annota-
tors inspected the top-250 of these rankings.

5 Results

5.1 Hashtag predictability

The results of our classifiers labeling a large sam-
ple of tweets posted on February 1, 2013 are listed
in Table 1. Each line with a target hashtag repre-
sents a separate experiment. The amount of train-
ing tweets ranges from 19 thousand to 677 thou-
sand for the target hashtag (balanced by an equal

amount of random tweets as negative category).
The results are sorted by the AUC score.

In this first evaluation our attention focuses on
the tweets that have one of the target hashtags.
The hashtags themselves are removed at classifica-
tion time, as our goal is to measure how well our
classifiers are able to detect these ‘hidden’ tags.
In this particular stream of tweets, only a limited
number of tweets occur that are labeled with our
hashtags; the most frequent tag #zinin (’looking
forward to it’) occurs 1,328 times. Taking #zinin
as example, the #zinin classifier labels 158,429 of
the test tweets as likely candidates for the hashtag
#zinin. Although this is a substantial overpredic-
tion, partly caused by the 50%-50% ratio between
positive and negative cases in the training set, this
still amounts to a false positive rate of only 6%.
More importantly, of the 1,328 cases for which it
should have predicted #zinin, the classifier labels
1,186 cases correctly, attaining a true positive rate
of 89%. The area under the curve (AUC) in true
positive rate–false positive rate space is 91%.

Inspecting the performance for all 24 hashtags
we observe that about half of the hashtags obtain
an AUC of .80 or more. The influence of the
amount of training data on the AUC score seems
peripheral. Furthermore, there is no clear differ-
ence in the predictability of hashtags denoting a
positive or negative emotion. The predominantly
negative hashtags #geenzin, #fml, #balen and #ni-
etleuk obtain a high AUC, while the other nega-
tive hashtags #grr, #bah and #stom are not as pre-
dictable. There does not seem to be an a priori
property that makes a hashtag more or less pre-
dictable, indicating the need for experimentation
to confirm the usefulness of a hashtag for emotion
detection.

Interestingly, some pairs of synonymous hash-
tags (#jippie-#joepie, #wauw–#wow, #yes–#yeah,
homophonous variants of the same exclama-
tion) and antonymous hashtags (#zinin–#geenzin,
#fml–#lml) achieve similar AUC scores. This out-
come supports the validity of our approach. Syn-
onymous and antonymous hashtags are employed
in similar contexts and should therefore have a
similar predictability. This is indeed confirmed by
our results. There are counterexamples, however.
The pair #yay–#jeej exhibits dissimilar scores. In
the case of #leuk there are two antonyms: #ni-
etleuk and #stom. #leuk and #nietleuk have a dis-
similar score, while #leuk and #stom are rather

similar.

5.2 Emotion detection

The second evaluation is based on the manual an-
notation of the 250 tweets most positively ranked
by a hashtag classifier, on the emotion linked to
the target hashtag. Due to the labour-intensive na-
ture of this evaluation, it was not possible to ana-
lyze all 24 hashtags. We focused on the output for
#zinin, #geenzin, #fml and #omg. The first three
achieved the highest true positive rates ranging be-
tween 86% and 89%, and AUC scores of 90% to
91%. The latter was included as a comparison, ex-
pecting a poor emotion detection in view of its bad
predictability.

For these four hashtags the 250 ‘false positives’
of which the classifier was most certain were an-
notated by the three authors by taking the binary
decision whether a tweet conveyes the emotion
presumed in tweets containing the hashtag. The
emotions most strongly linked to the four hashtags
were the following:

• #zinin: conveying anticipatory excitement;

• #geenzin: conveying uneagerness

• #fml: conveying self pity

• #omg: conveying an aroused level of indig-
nation, fear, or excitement

Note that #omg is not linked to a single emo-
tion, but rather strengthens several sorts of emo-
tions. This might have been a hampering factor
for its predictability. In the annotation for #omg
we focused on all three emotions.

Table 2 displays the precision scores when tak-
ing a simple majority decision over the three anno-
tators (67% majority) and when only counting the
cases in which all three annotators agreed (100%
majority). The outcomes show reasonably high
precision levels for #zinin (75%) and #fml (69%)
along with equally reasonable mutual F-scores be-
tween the annotators (67% for #zinin and 81% for
#fml), although Cohen’s Kappa is rather low in
some cases. On the other hand, #geenzin lags be-
hind with a majority precision of 31%. Also the
top 250 for #omg does not often display any of the
three most strongly linked emotions.

Plotting the annotations of the ranked tweets in
precision-at curves, shown in Figure 1, provides
further insight into the emotion detection quality
in relation to the confidence ranks. Precisions at
higher rank cutoffs tend to peak early (indicating
that the first top-ranked tweets fit the hashtag best),
and decrease slowly or reach a plateau.

The twofold evaluation that was employed in
this study underlines the difference between hash-
tag predictability and emotion detection. Regard-
ing the three best performing hashtags in terms
of predictability, only two, #zinin and #fml, pro-
vide utilizable data for emotion detection. Tweets
retrieved based on #geenzin seem to have a less
overt relation to the emotion of uneagerness, al-
though other cues (such as topical words indirectly
related to the emotion) lead to a fairly correct re-
covery of tweets that had the hashtag. Comparing
the two evaluations for #omg, scoring low on both,
we may assume that hashtag predictability is a re-
quirement for a proper emotion detection.

6 Discussion

6.1 Feature categories

While classifier performance gives an indication
of its ability to detect emotional tweets per hash-
tag, the strong indicators of those hashtags discov-
ered by the classifiers may provide additional in-
sight into the usage patterns of emotional hashtags
by Twitter users. Having scored the emotion de-
tection quality of four hashtags, we set out to an-
alyze the predictive features of these hashtags. To
this end we inspected the feature weights assigned
by the Balanced Winnow classifier ranked by the
strength of their connection to the emotion label,
taking into account the 150 tokens and n-grams
with the highest positive weight towards the hash-
tag.

Based on an analysis of the top 150 features
for the four hashtags, we distinguished seven cat-
egories of features: other emotion-bearing hash-
tags, emoticons, exclamations, states of being,
time expressions, topic reference, and remaining
features. Example features for each category, as
well as their share in the top 150 features for each
hashtag, are presented in Table 3. The percentages
give an impression of the most dominant types of

features in the prediction of the hashtags.
A first observation is that the top features of

the #geenzin classifier are predominantly topic re-
lated; the list hardly contains any feature that bears
emotion. This is in line with the poor perfor-
mance on the emotion detection evaluation, while
the high AUC score can be explained by a relative
consistency of the hashtag being used with topi-
cal words that have an indirect relation with the
emotion, such as homework for school. The more
accurate classifier for the opposite of #geenzin,
#zinin, uses more temporal references pointing to
the event the person is looking forward to. Also,
Dutch positive adjectives such as ‘lekker’ (‘nice’)
and ‘gezellig’ (multiple translations2), which are
strong predictors for #zinin, add to the accuracy of
the classifier. There are no clear counterparts for
the emotion linked to the opposing #geenzin.

The percentages for #omg display the largest
shares of emotion hashtags, emoticons and ex-
clamations, confirming our impression that #omg
functions as an intensifying marker of different
emotions; this is also reflected in the high percent-
age of features in the ‘other’ category.

The most predictive features for the #fml clas-
sifier consist of quite some emoticons, emotional
hashtags and exclamations. Furthermore, this
classifier contains most features in the ‘state of be-
ing’ category, mostly relating to the complex emo-
tion of self pity.

6.2 Emotional cues in Twitter

In contrast to spoken or face-to-face communica-
tion, Twitter does not allow for the use of special
intonation or facial expressions to mark a mes-
sage. However, authors on Twitter have other cues
at their disposal. Previous studies show, for ex-
ample, that they might mark the irony or sarcasm
in their message by using linguistic markers such

as hyperboles, exclamations and emoticons to help
readers to correctly interpret the message (Burgers
et al., 2012; Liebrecht et al., 2013). We argue that
this is also the case for emotional messages.

Tweets are written messages with a strongly re-
stricted length. Authors compensate the lack of
non-verbal cues by adding emotion markers. This
hypothesis is supported by research in the field
of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC),
where many studies have been carried out on (the
lack of) non-verbal emotional cues in (electronic)
messages. Walther (1992) introduced the Social
Information Processing Perspective: a theory that
users can develop relationships via CMC if they
have sufficient time and message exchanges and
if communicative cues, such as non-verbal emo-
tional cues, are available. He argues that hu-
mans easily switch between verbal and non-verbal
cues. Based on previous studies, Walther distin-
guishes textual cues that express affection: re-
lational icons (emoticons, see Asteroff, 1987),
electronic paralanguage (such as intentional mis-
spelling (veeeery), capitalization (NICE), repeti-
tion of exclamation marks (good!!!!!) and lexical

surrogates for vocal segregates (hmmm) (Carey,
1980). Later he also recognizes emoticons as
nonverbal emotion cues (Walther and D’Addario,
2001). Emoticons can serve many purposes, one
of which is expressing emotions (Agarwal et al.,
2011; Davidov et al., 2010).

7 Conclusion

In our experiments we showed that machine learn-
ing classifiers can be relatively successful both
in predicting the hashtag with tweets which were
indeed tagged with them, and classifying tweets
without the hashtag as exhibiting the emotion de-
noted by the hashtag, for two of the four fully anal-
ysed hashtags: #zinin and #fml. In contrast, the
classifier of the hashtag #geenzin was only able
to re-link tweets that are stripped from the target
hashtag with this hashtag, but failed to capture the
complex emotion behind the hashtag. The perfor-
mance of the #omg classifier lags behind in both
tasks.

These findings can be explained by the assump-
tion we made that in order to be a proper emotion
label, the context of the hashtag (the rest of the

tweet) would need to convey the same emotion
as the hashtag. This appears to be the case with
#zinin and #fml. We may assume that the message
in tweets with #zinin or #fml carries the emotion
itself, which is intensified by the hashtag. The al-
ternative relation between the hashtag and the text
is that a hashtag adds emotion to an otherwise neu-
tral message: a signalling function. It seems that
most of the tweets tagged with #geenzin are ex-
amples of this second relation. The classifier per-
formed well at the re-link task, indicating that it
was able to exploit the consistent use of predic-
tive words and phrases, but less well as an emotion
detector when we applied the classifier to unseen
tweets that do not carry the hashtag. The topical
words the classifier used as predictive features ap-
pear to be used in several other settings in which
no emotion is conveyed, or different emotions than
the one expressed by #geenzin. The fourth hash-
tag that was fully analysed, #omg, turned out to
be overall difficult for our classifier. We defined
#omg as conveying an aroused level of indigna-
tion, fear or excitement. In comparison to the other
three hashtags, this definition is less strictly linked
to one emotion (Kim et al., 2012). Rather, the
hashtag is used in the context of three different
emotions and is in itself not an emotion, but an
emotion intensifier. Possibly, as a result thereof
the tweets are more diverse and the hashtag #omg
occurs more frequently with other linguistic ele-
ments to express emotion, such as emotional hash-
tags, emoticons and exclamations.

Although time restrictions prevented us from
performing a similar analysis of more hashtags,
we can conclude that hashtag predictability is
fairly high for most of the 24 hashtags in our
set. Interestingly, a considerate part of the syn-
onymous and antonymous hashtags led to similar

scores, indicating a relationship between the type
of emotion conveyed by a hashtag and the degree
of consistency by which the hashtag is employed
by users. Whether the degree of consistency, along
with an intensifying or emotion adding deploy-
ment, can be deduced from the inherent properties
of an emotion hashtag is open for future research.
