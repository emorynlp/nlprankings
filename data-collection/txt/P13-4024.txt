Abstract 

In this paper, we introduce a Web-scale lin-
guistics search engine, Linggle, that retrieves 
lexical bundles in response to a given query. 
The query might contain keywords, wildcards, 
wild parts of speech (PoS), synonyms, and ad-
ditional regular expression (RE) operators. In 
our approach, we incorporate inverted file in-
dexing, PoS information from BNC, and se-
mantic indexing based on Latent Dirichlet Al-
location with Google Web 1T. The method in-
volves parsing the query to transforming it in-
to several keyword retrieval commands. Word 
chunks are retrieved with counts, further filter-
ing the chunks with the query as a RE, and fi-
nally displaying the results according to the 
counts, similarities, and topics. Clusters of 
synonyms or conceptually related words are 
also provided.  In addition, Linggle provides 
example sentences from The New York Times 
on demand. The current implementation of 
Linggle is the most functionally comprehen-
sive, and is in principle language and dataset 
independent. We plan to extend Linggle to 
provide fast and convenient access to a wealth 
of linguistic information embodied in Web 
scale datasets including Google Web 1T and 
Google Books Ngram for many major lan-
guages in the world. 

1 Introduction 
As a non-native speaker writing in English, one 
encounters many problems. Doubts concerning 
the usage of a preposition, the mandatory presen-
ce of a determiner, the correctness of the associa-
tion of a verb with an object, or the need for syn-
onyms of a term in a given context are issues that 
arise frequently. Printed collocation dictionaries 
and reference tools based on compiled corpora 
offer limited coverage of word usage while 
knowledge of collocations is vital to acquire a 

good level of linguistic competency. We propose 
to address these limitations with a comprehen-
sive system aimed at helping the learners “know 
a word by the company it keeps” (Firth, 1957). 
Linggle (linggle.com). The system based on 
Web-scaled datasets is designed to be a broad 
coverage language reference tool for English 
Second Language learners (ESL). It is conceived 
to search information related to word usage in 
context under various conditions. 

First, we build an inverted file index for the 
Google Web 1T n-grams to support queries with 
RE-like patterns including PoS and synonym 
matches. For example, for the query “$V $D 
+important role”, Linggle retrieves 4-grams that 
start with a verb and a determiner followed by a 
synonym of important and the keyword role (e.g., 
play a significant role 202,800). A natural lan-
guage interface is also available for users who 
are less familiar with pattern-based searches. For 
example, the question “How can I describe a 
beach?” would retrieve two word chunks such as 
“sandy beach 413,300” and “rocky beach 
16,800”. The n-gram search implementation is 
achieved through filtering, re-indexing, populat-
ing an HBase database with the Web 1T n-grams 
and augmenting them with the most frequent PoS 
for words (without disambiguation) derived from 
the British National Corpus (BNC).  

 The n-grams returned for a query can then be 
linked to examples extracted from the New York 
Times Corpus (Sandhaus, 2008) in order to 
provide full sentential context for more effective 
learning. 
 In some situations, the user might need to search 
for words in a specific syntactic relation (e.g., 
Verb-Object collocation). The query absorb $N 
in n-grams display mode returns all the nouns 
that follow the verb ordered by decreasing n-
gram counts. Some of these nouns might not be 
objects of the verb absorb. In contrast, the same 

139



query in cluster display mode will control that 
two words have been labeled verb-object by a 
parser. Moreover, n-grams grouped by object 
topic/domain give the learner an overview of the 
usage of the verb. For example the verb absorb 
takes clusters of objects related to the topics liq-
uid, energy, money, knowledge, and population. 

 

  
Figure 1. An example Linggle search for the que-
ry “absorb $N.” 
 

This tendency of predicates to prefer certain 
classes of arguments is defined by Wilks (1978) 
as selectional preferences and widely reported in 
the literature. Erk and Padó (2010) extend exper-
iments on selectional preference induction to in-
verse selectional preference, considering the re-
striction imposed on predicates. Inverse sectional 
preference is also implemented in linggle (e.g. 
“$V apple”). 

Linggle presents clusters of synonymous col-
locates (adjectives, nouns and verbs) of a query 
keyword. We obtained the clusters by building 
on Lin and Pantel’s (2002) large-scale repository 
of dependencies and word similarity scores. Us-
ing the method proposed by Ritter and Etzioni 
(2010) we induce selectional preference with a 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to seed 
the clusters. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
We review the related work in the next section. 
Then we present the syntax of the queries and the 
functionalities of the system (Section 3). We de-
scribe the details of implementation including the 
indexing of the n-grams and the clustering algo-
rithm (Section 4) and draw perspective of devel-
opment of Web scale search engines (Section 5). 

2 Related work 
Web-scale Linguistic Search Engine (LSE) has 
been an area of active research. Recently, the 
state-of-the-art in LSE research has been re-

viewed in Fletcher (2012). We present in this 
paper a linguistic search engine that provides a 
more comprehensive and powerful set of query 
features.  

Kilgarriff et al. (2001) describe the implemen-
tation of the linguistic search engine Word 
Sketch (2001) that displays collocations and de-
pendencies acquired from a large corpus such as 
the BNC. Word Sketch is not as flexible as typi-
cal search engines, only supporting a fixed set of 
queries.  

Recently, researchers have been attempting to 
go one step further and work with Web scale da-
tasets, but it is difficult for an academic institute 
to crawl a dataset that is on par with the datasets 
built by search engine companies. In 2006, 
Google released the Web 1T for several major 
languages of the world (trillion-word n-gram da-
tasets for English, Japanese, Chinese, and ten 
European languages), to stimulate NLP research 
in many areas.  In 2008, Chang described a pro-
totype that enhances Google Web 1T bigrams 
with PoS tags and supports search in the dataset 
by wildcards (wild-PoS), to identify recurring 
collocations. Wu, Witten and Franken (2010) 
describe a more comprehensive system (FLAX) 
that combines filtered Google data with text ex-
amples from the BNC for several learning activi-
ties.  

In a way similar to Chang (2008) and Wu, 
Witten and Franken (2010), Stein, Potthast, and 
Trenkmann (2010) describe the implementation 
and application of NetSpeak, a system that pro-
vides quick access to the Google Web 1T n-gram 
with RE-like queries (alternator “|”, one arbitrary 
word “*”, arbitrary number of words between 
two specified words “…”). In contrast to Linggle, 
NetSpeak does not support PoS wildcard or con-
ceptual clustering. 

An important function in both Linggle and 
NetSpeak is synonym query. NetSpeak uses 
WordNet (Fellbaum 2010) synsets to support 
synonym match. But WordNet synsets tend to 
contain very little synonyms, leading to poor 
coverage. Alternatively, one can use the distribu-
tional approach to similarity based on a very 
large corpus. Lin and Pantel (2002) report efforts 
to build a large repository of dependencies ex-
tracted from large corpora such as Wikipedia, 
and provide similarity between words 
(demo.patrickpantel.com). We use these results 
both for handling synonym queries and to or-
ganize the n-grams into semantic classes.  

More recently, Ritter and Etzioni (2010) pro-
pose to apply an LDA model (Blei et al. 2003) to 

140



the problem of inducing selectional preference. 
The idea is to consider the verbs in a corpus as 
the documents of a traditional LDA model. The 
arguments of the verb that are encountered in the 
corpus are treated as the words composing a 
document in the traditional model. The model 
seems to successfully infer the semantic classes 
that correspond to the preferred arguments of a 
verb. The topics are semi-automatically labeled 
with WordNet classes to produce a repository of 
human interpretable class-based selectional pref-
erence. This choice might be due to the fact that 
if most LDA topic heads are usually reasonable 
upon human inspection, some topics are also in-
coherent (Newman 2010) and lower frequency 
words are not handled as successfully. We con-
trol the coherence of the topics and rearrange 
them into human interpretable clusters using a 
distributional similarity measure.  

Microsoft Sempute Project (Sempute Team 
2013) also explores core technologies and appli-
cations of semantic computing. As part of 
Sempute project, NeedleSeek is aimed at auto-
matically extracting data to support general se-
mantic Web searches. While Linggle focuses on 
n-gram information for language learning, 
NeedleSeek also uses LDA to support question 
answering (e.g., What were the Capitals of an-
cient China?) . 

In contrast to the previous research in Web 
scale linguistic search engines, we present a sys-
tem that supports queries with keywords, wild-
card words, POS, synonyms, and additional 
regular expression (RE) operators and displays 
the results according the count, similarity, and 
topic with clusters of synonyms or conceptually 
related words. We exploit and combine the 
power of both LDA analysis and distributional 
similarity to provide meaningful semantic classes 
that are constrained with members of high simi-
larity. Distributional similarity (Lin 1998) and 
LDA topics become two angles of attack to view 
language usage and corpus patterns. 

3 Linggle Functionalities 
The syntax of Linggle queries involves basic 
regular expression of keywords enriched with 
wildcard PoS and synonyms. Linggle queries can 
be either pattern-based commands or natural lan-
guage questions. The natural language queries 
are currently handled by simple string matching 
based on a limited set of questions and command 
pairs provided by a native speaker informant.  

3.1 Natural language queries 

The handling of queries formulated in natural 
language has been implemented with handcrafted 
patterns refined from a corpus of questions found 
on various websites. Additionally, we asked both 
native and non-native speakers to use the system 
for text edition and to write down all the ques-
tions that arise during the exercise.  

Linggle transforms a question into commands 
for further processing based on a set of canned 
texts (e.g., “How to describe a beach?” will be 
converted to “$A beach”). We are in the process 
of gathering more examples of language-related 
question and answer pairs from Answers.com to 
improve the precision, versatility, and coverage. 

3.2 Syntax of queries 

The syntax of the patterns for n-grams is shown 
in Table 1. The syntax supports two types of que-
ry functions: basic keyword search with regular 
expression capability and semantic search.  

Basic search operators enable the users to que-
ry zero, one or more arbitrary words up to five 
words. For example, the query “set off … $N” is 
intended to search for all nouns in the right con-
text of set off, within a maximum distance of 
three words.  

In addition, the “?” operator in front of a word 
represents a search for n-grams with or without 
the word. For example, a user wanting to deter-
mine whether to use the word to between listen 
and music can formulate the query “listen ?to 
music.” 

Yet another operation “|” is provided to search 
for information related to word choice. For ex-
ample the query “build | construct ... dream” can 
be used to reveal that people build a dream much 
more often than they construct a dream. 

A set of PoS symbols (shown in Table 2) is 
defined to support queries that need more preci-
sion than the symbol *. More work might be 
needed to resolve PoS ambiguity for n-grams. 
Currently, any word that has been labeled with 
the requested PoS in the BNC more than 5% of 
the time is displayed.  

The “+” operator is provided to support se-
mantic queries. Placed in front of a word, it is 
intended to search for synonyms in the context. 
For example the query “+sandy beach” would 
generate rocky beach, stony beach, barren beach 
in the top three results. The query “+abandoned 
beach” generates deserted, destroyed and empty 
beach at the top of the list. To support conceptual 
clustering of collocational n-grams, we need to 

141



identify synonyms related to different senses of a 
given word. Table 3 shows an example of the 
result obtained for the ambiguous word bank as a 
unigram query. We can see the two main senses 
of the word (river bank and institution) as clus-
ters.

Table 2: Part-of-speech in the Linggle queries  
 
A cluster button on the interface activates or 

cancels conceptual clustering. When Linggle is 
switched into a cluster display mode, adjective-
nouns, verb-objects and subject-verb relations 
can be browsed based on the induced conceptual 
clusters (see Figure 1). 

The New York Times Example Base 

In order to display complete sentence examples 
for users, the New York Times Corpus sentences 
are indexed by word. When the user searches for 
words in a specific syntactic relation, morpho-
logical query expansion is performed and pat-
terns are used to increase both the coverage and 
the precision of the provided examples. For ex-
ample, the bi-gram kill bacteria will be associat-
ed with the example sentence “The bacteria are 
killed by high temperatures.”. 

3.3 Semantic Clusters 

Two types of semantic clusters are provided in 
Linggle: selectional preference and clusters of 
synonyms. Selectional preference expresses for 
example that an apple is more likely to be eaten 
or cooked than to be killed or hanged. Different 
classes of arguments for a predicate (or of predi-
cates for an argument) can be found automatical-
ly. The favorite class of objects for the verb drink 

is LIQUID with the noun water ranked at the top. 
Less frequent objects belonging to the same class 
include liquor in the tail of the list. We aim at 
grouping arguments and predicates into semantic 
clusters for better readability.

vestor broker provider lender owner creditor share-
holder customer employer 
Table 3: First two level-one clusters of synonyms for 
the word “bank” 

We produce clusters with a two-layer structure. 
Level one represents loose topical relatedness 
roughly corresponding to broad domains, while 
level two is aimed at grouping together closely 
similar words. For example, among the objects 
of the verb cultivate, the nouns tie and contact 
belong to the same level-two cluster. Attitude and 
spirit belong to another level-two cluster but 
both pairs are in the same level-one cluster. The 
nouns fruit and vegetable are clustered together 
in another level-one cluster. This double-layer 
representation is a solution to express at once 
close synonymy and topic relatedness. The clus-
ters of symonyms displayed in Table 3 follow the 
same representation. 

4 Implementation of the system 

In this section, we describe the implementation 
of Linggle, including how to index and store n-
grams for a fast access (Section 4.1) and 
construction of the LDA models (Section 4.2). 
We will describe the clustering method in more 
details in section 5.  

4.1 N-grams preprocessing 

The n-grams are first filtered keeping only the 
words that are in WordNet and in the British Na-
tional Corpus, and then indexed by word and 
position in the n-gram, in a way similar to the 
rotated n-gram approach proposed by Lin et. al. 
(2010). The files are then stored in an Apache 

142



HBase NoSQL base. The major advantages of 
using a NoSQL database is the excellent perfor-
mance in querying the ability of storing large 
amounts of data across several servers and the 
capability to scale up when we have additional 
entries in the dataset, or additional datasets to 
add to the system. 

4.2 LDA models computations 

Two types of LDA models are calculated for 
Linggle. The first type is a selectional preference 
model between heads and modifiers. Six models 
are calculated in total for the subject-verb, the 
verb-object and the adjective-noun relations done 
in a similar way to Ritter and Etzioni’s (2010) 
model with binary relations instead of triples. 
The second is a word/synonyms model in which 
a word is considered as a document in LDA and 
its synonyms as the words of the document. This 
second model has the effect of splitting the syno-
nyms of a word into different topics, as shown in 
Table 3. 

 
Seeds                                             parameter: s1 
1. Consider the m first topics for a verb v ac-

cording to the LDA per document-topic dis-
tribution (𝜃) 

2. Consider S = o1,…,on, a set of n objects of v.  
3. Split S into m classes C1,..,Cm according to 

their LDA per topic-word probability: oi  is 
assigned to the topic in which it has the 
highest probability. 

4. For each class Ci, move every object oj that 
is not similar to any other ok of Ci , according 
to a similarity threshold s1 into a new created 
class. 

Level 2                                           parameter: s2 
 While (Argmaxci ,cj Sim( ci , cj ) > s2): 
           Merge Argmaxci ,cj Sim( ci , cj ) into one 
class. 
Level 1                                           parameter: s3 
 While (Argmaxci ,cj Sim(ci , cj ) > s3): 
           Group Argmaxci ,cj Sim( ci ,cj ) under the  
           same level 1 cluster. 

Table 4:  Clustering Algorithm for the object of a giv-
en verb 

 
The hyperparameters alpha, eta, that affect 

the sparsity of the document-topic (theta) and the 
topic-word (lambda) distributions are both set to 
0.5 and the number of topics is set to 300. More 
research would be necessary to optimize the val-
ue for the parameters in the perspective of the 
clustering algorithm, as quickly discussed in the 
next section. 

 

 
Sim (ci, cj): 

1. Build the Cartesian product C = ci × cj 
2. Get P the set of the similarity between all word pairs 

in C 
3. Return Sim(ci,cj) the mean of the scores in P 
 
Table 5:  Similarity between two classes ti and tj 

5 Clustering algorithm 
The clustering algorithm combines topic model-
ing results and a semantic similarity measure. 
We use Pantel’s dependencies repository to 
compute LDA models for subject-verbs, verbs-
objects and adjective-nouns relations in both di-
rections. Currently, we also use Pantel’s similari-
ty measure. It has a reasonable precision partly 
because it relies on parser information instead of 
bag of words windows. However the coverage of 
the available scores is lower than what would be 
needed for Linggle. We will address this issue in 
the near future by extending it with similarity 
scores computed from the n-grams. 

We combine the two distributional semantics 
approaches in a simple manner inspired by clus-
tering by committee algorithm  (CBC). The simi-
larity measure is used to refine the LDA topics 
and to generate finer grain clusters. Conversely, 
LDA topics can also be seen as the seeds of our 
clustering algorithm. 

This algorithm intends to constrain the words 
that belong to a final cluster more strictly than 
LDA does in order to obtain clearly interpretable 
clusters. The exact same algorithm is applied to 
synonym models, for synonyms of nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs (shown in Table 3). 

Table 4 shows the algorithm for constructing 
double layer clusters for a set S of objects of a 
verb v. The objects are first roughly split into 
classes, attributing a single topic to every object 
oi. The topic of a word oi is determined accord-
ing to its per topic-word probability. More exper-
iments could be done using the product of the per 
document-topic and the per topic-word LDA 
probabilities instead, in order to take into account 
the specific verb when assigning a topic to the 
object. Such a way of assigning topics should 
also be more sensitive to the LDA hyperparame-
ters.  

At this stage, some classes are incoherent and 
that low frequency words that do not appear in 
the head of any topic are often misclassified. 
Words are rearranged between the classes and 
create new classes if necessary using the simi-
larity measure. If any word of a class is not simi-

143



lar to any other word in this class (the threshold 
is set to s1 = 0.09), a new class is created for it. 

Any two classes are then merged if their simi-
larity (computer accordingly to Table 5) is above 
s2=0.06, forming the level 2 clusters. Classes are 
then grouped together if the similarity between 
them is above s3 = 0.02 forming the level 1 clus-
ters. 

Finally, the classes that contain less than three 
words are not displayed in Linggle and the predi-
cate-arguments counts in the Web 1T are re-
trieved using a few hand crafted RE and morpho-
logical expansion of the nouns and the verbs. 

 This algorithm appears to generate interpreta-
ble semantic classes and to be quite robust re-
garding the threshold parameters. More tests and 
rigorous evaluation are left to future work.   

6 Conclusion 
There are many different directions in which 
Linggle will be improved. The first one is to al-
low users to work with word forms and with 
multiword expressions. The second one concerns 
the extension of the coverage of the example 
base with several large corpora such as Wikipe-
dia and the extension of the coverage of the simi-
larity measure. The third direction concerns the 
development of automatic suggestions for text 
edition, such as suggesting a better adjective or a 
different preposition in the context of a sentence. 
Finally, Linggle is currently being extended to 
Chinese. 

We presented a prototype that gives access 
to Web Scale collocations. Linggle displays both 
word usage and word similarity information. 
Depending on the type of the input query, the 
results are displayed under the form of lists or 
clusters of n-grams. The system is designed to 
become a multilingual platform for text edition 
and can also become a valuable resource for 
natural language processing research.
