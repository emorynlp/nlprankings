Abstract

We present LLCCM, a log-linear variant of the
constituent context model (CCM) of grammar
induction. LLCCM retains the simplicity of
the original CCM but extends robustly to long
sentences. On sentences of up to length 40,
LLCCM outperforms CCM by 13.9% brack-
eting F1 and outperforms a right-branching
baseline in regimes where CCM does not.

1 Introduction

Unsupervised grammar induction is a fundamental
challenge of statistical natural language processing
(Lari and Young, 1990; Pereira and Schabes, 1992;
Carroll and Charniak, 1992). The constituent con-
text model (CCM) for inducing constituency parses
(Klein and Manning, 2002) was the first unsuper-
vised approach to surpass a right-branching base-
line. However, the CCM only effectively models
short sentences. This paper shows that a simple re-
parameterization of the model, which ties together
the probabilities of related events, allows the CCM
to extend robustly to long sentences.

Much recent research has explored dependency
grammar induction. For instance, the dependency
model with valence (DMV) of Klein and Manning
(2004) has been extended to utilize multilingual in-
formation (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010; Co-
hen et al., 2011), lexical information (Headden III et
al., 2009), and linguistic universals (Naseem et al.,
2010). Nevertheless, simplistic dependency models
like the DMV do not contain information present in
a constituency parse, such as the attachment order of
object and subject to a verb.

Unsupervised constituency parsing is also an ac-
tive research area. Several studies (Seginer, 2007;
Reichart and Rappoport, 2010; Ponvert et al., 2011)

have considered the problem of inducing parses
over raw lexical items rather than part-of-speech
(POS) tags. Additional advances have come from
more complex models, such as combining CCM
and DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004) and model-
ing large tree fragments (Bod, 2006).

The CCM scores each parse as a product of prob-
abilities of span and context subsequences. It was
originally evaluated only on unpunctuated sentences
up to length 10 (Klein and Manning, 2002), which
account for only 15% of the WSJ corpus; our exper-
iments confirm the observation in (Klein, 2005) that
performance degrades dramatically on longer sen-
tences. This problem is unsurprising: CCM scores
each constituent type by a single, isolated multino-
mial parameter.

Our work leverages the idea that sharing infor-
mation between local probabilities in a structured
unsupervised model can lead to substantial accu-
racy gains, previously demonstrated for dependency
grammar induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Our model, Log-Linear
CCM (LLCCM), shares information between the
probabilities of related constituents by expressing
them as a log-linear combination of features trained
using the gradient-based learning procedure of Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al. (2010). In this way, the probabil-
ity of generating a constituent is informed by related
constituents.

Our model improves unsupervised constituency
parsing of sentences longer than 10 words. On sen-
tences of up to length 40 (96% of all sentences in
the Penn Treebank), LLCCM outperforms CCM by
13.9% (unlabeled) bracketing F1 and, unlike CCM,
outperforms a right-branching baseline on sentences
longer than 15 words.

2 Model

The CCM is a generative model for the unsuper-
vised induction of binary constituency parses over
sequences of part-of-speech (POS) tags (Klein and
Manning, 2002). Conditioned on the constituency or
distituency of each span in the parse, CCM generates
both the complete sequence of terminals it contains
and the terminals in the surrounding context.

Formally, the CCM is a probabilistic model that
jointly generates a sentence, s, and a bracketing,
B, specifying whether each contiguous subsequence
is a constituent or not, in which case the span is
called a distituent. Each subsequence of POS tags,
or SPAN, α, occurs in a CONTEXT, β, which is an
ordered pair of preceding and following tags. A
bracketing is a boolean matrix B, indicating which
spans (i, j) are constituents (Bij = true) and which
are distituents (Bij = false). A bracketing is con-
sidered legal if its constituents are nested and form a
binary tree T (B).

The joint distribution is given by:

P(s,B) = PT (B) ·∏
i,j∈T (B)

PS (α(i, j, s)|true) PC (β(i, j, s)|true) ·∏
i,j 6∈T (B)

PS (α(i, j, s)|false) PC (β(i, j, s)|false)

The prior over unobserved bracketings PT (B) is
fixed to be the uniform distribution over all legal
bracketings. The other distributions, PS (·) and
PC (·), are multinomials whose isolated parameters
are estimated to maximize the likelihood of a set of
observed sentences {sn} using EM (Dempster et al.,
1977).1

2.1 The Log-Linear CCM

A fundamental limitation of the CCM is that it con-
tains a single isolated parameter for every span. The
number of different possible span types increases ex-
ponentially in span length, leading to data sparsity as
the sentence length increases.

1As mentioned in (Klein and Manning, 2002), the CCM
model is deficient because it assigns probability mass to yields
and spans that cannot consistently combine to form a valid sen-
tence. Our model does not address this issue, and hence it is
similarly deficient.

The Log-Linear CCM (LLCCM) reparameterizes
the distributions in the CCM using intuitive features
to address the limitations of CCM while retaining
its predictive power. The set of proposed features
includes a BASIC feature for each parameter of the
original CCM, enabling the LLCCM to retain the
full expressive power of the CCM. In addition, LL-
CCM contains a set of coarse features that activate
across distinct spans.

To introduce features into the CCM, we express
each of its local conditional distributions as a multi-
class logistic regression model. Each local distri-
bution, Pt(y|x) for t ∈ {SPAN,CONTEXT}, condi-
tions on label x ∈ {true, false} and generates an
event (span or context) y. We can define each lo-
cal distribution in terms of a weight vector, w, and
feature vector, fxyt, using a log-linear model:

Pt(y|x) =
exp 〈w, fxyt〉∑
y′ exp

〈
w, fxy′t

〉 (1)
This technique for parameter transformation was

shown to be effective in unsupervised models for
part-of-speech induction, dependency grammar in-
duction, word alignment, and word segmentation
(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). In our case, replac-
ing multinomials via featurized models not only im-
proves model accuracy, but also lets the model apply
effectively to a new regime of long sentences.

2.2 Feature Templates
In the SPAN model, for each span y = [α1, . . . , αn]
and label x, we use the following feature templates:

BASIC: I [y = · ∧ x = ·]
BOUNDARY: I [α1 = · ∧ αn = · ∧ x = ·]

PREFIX: I [α1 = · ∧ x = ·]
SUFFIX: I [αn = · ∧ x = ·]

Just as the external CONTEXT is a signal of con-
stituency, so too is the internal “context.” For exam-
ple, there are many distinct noun phrases with differ-
ent spans that all begin with DT and end with NN; a
fact expressed by the BOUNDARY feature (Table 1).

In the CONTEXT model, for each context y =
[β1, β2] and constituent/distituent decision x, we use
the following feature templates:

BASIC: I [y = · ∧ x = ·]
L-CONTEXT: I [β1 = · ∧ x = ·]
R-CONTEXT: I [β2 = · ∧ x = ·]

and (4, 6). The symbol � indicates a sentence boundary.

Notice that although the BASIC span features are
active for at most one span, the remaining features
fire for both spans, effectively sharing information
between the local probabilities of these events.

The coarser CONTEXT features factor the context
pair into its components, which allow the LLCCM
to more easily learn, for example, that a constituent
is unlikely to immediately follow a determiner.

3 Training

In the EM algorithm for estimating CCM parame-
ters, the E-Step computes posteriors over bracket-
ings using the Inside-Outside algorithm. The M-
Step chooses parameters that maximize the expected
complete log likelihood of the data.

The weights, w, of LLCCM are estimated to max-
imize the data log likelihood of the training sen-
tences {sn}, summing out all possible bracketings
B for each sentence:

L(w) =
∑
sn

log
∑
B

Pw(sn, B)

We optimize this objective via L-BFGS (Liu and
Nocedal, 1989), which requires us to compute the

objective gradient. Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010)
showed that the data log likelihood gradient is equiv-
alent to the gradient of the expected complete log
likelihood (the objective maximized in the M-step of
EM) at the point from which expectations are com-
puted. This gradient can be computed in three steps.

First, we compute the local probabilities of the
CCM, Pt(y|x), from the current w using Equa-
tion (1). We approximate the normalization over an
exponential number of terms by only summing over
spans that appeared in the training corpus.

Second, we compute posteriors over bracketings,
P(i, j|sn), just as in the E-step of CCM training,2 in
order to determine the expected counts:

exy,SPAN =
∑
sn

∑
ij

I [α(i, j, sn) = y] δ(x)

exy,CONTEXT =
∑
sn

∑
ij

I [β(i, j, sn) = y] δ(x)

where δ(true) = P(i, j|sn), and δ(false) = 1 −
δ(true).

We summarize these expected count quantities as:

exyt =

{
exy,SPAN if t = SPAN
exy,CONTEXT if t = CONTEXT

Finally, we compute the gradient with respect to
w, expressed in terms of these expected counts and
conditional probabilities:

∇L(w) =
∑
xyt

exytfxyt −G(w)

G(w) =
∑
xt

(∑
y

exyt

)∑
y′

Pt(y|x)fxy′t

Following (Klein and Manning, 2002), we initialize
the model weights by optimizing against posterior
probabilities fixed to the split-uniform distribution,
which generates binary trees by randomly choosing
a split point and recursing on each side of the split.3

2We follow the dynamic program presented in Appendix A.1
of (Klein, 2005).

3In Appendix B.2, Klein (2005) shows this posterior can be
expressed in closed form. As in previous work, we start the ini-
tialization optimization with the zero vector, and terminate after
10 iterations to regularize against achieving a local maximum.

3.1 Efficiently Computing the Gradient
The following quantity appears in G(w):

γt(x) =
∑

y

exyt

Which expands as follows depending on t:

γSPAN(x) =
∑

y

∑
sn

∑
ij

I [α(i, j, sn) = y] δ(x)

γCONTEXT(x) =
∑

y

∑
sn

∑
ij

I [β(i, j, sn) = y] δ(x)

In each of these expressions, the δ(x) term can
be factored outside the sum over y. Each fixed
(i, j) and sn pair has exactly one span and con-
text, hence the quantities

∑
y I [α(i, j, sn) = y] and∑

y I [β(i, j, sn) = y] are both equal to 1.

γt(x) =
∑
sn

∑
ij

δ(x)

This expression further simplifies to a constant.
The sum of the posterior probabilities, δ(true), over
all positions is equal to the total number of con-
stituents in the tree. Any binary tree over N ter-
minals contains exactly 2N − 1 constituents and
1
2(N − 2)(N − 1) distituents.

γt(x) =

{∑
sn

(2|sn| − 1) if x = true
1
2

∑
sn

(|sn| − 2)(|sn| − 1) if x = false

where |sn| denotes the length of sentence sn.
Thus, G(w) can be precomputed once for the en-

tire dataset at each minimization step. Moreover,
γt(x) can be precomputed once before all iterations.

3.2 Relationship to Smoothing
The original CCM uses additive smoothing in its M-
step to capture the fact that distituents outnumber
constituents. For each span or context, CCM adds
10 counts: 2 as a constituent and 8 as a distituent.4

We note that these smoothing parameters are tai-
lored to short sentences: in a binary tree, the number
of constituents grows linearly with sentence length,
whereas the number of distituents grows quadrati-
cally. Therefore, the ratio of constituents to dis-
tituents is not constant across sentence lengths. In
contrast, by virtue of the log-linear model, LLCCM
assigns positive probability to all spans or contexts
without explicit smoothing.

4These counts are specified in (Klein, 2005); Klein and
Manning (2002) added 10 constituent and 50 distituent counts.

Figure 1: CCM and LLCCM trained and tested on sentences of

binary branching upper bound correponds to UBOUND from
(Klein and Manning, 2002).

4 Experiments
We train our models on gold POS sequences from
all sections (0-24) of the WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993)
with punctuation removed. We report bracketing
F1 scores between the binary trees predicted by the
models on these sequences and the treebank parses.

We train and evaluate both a CCM implementa-
tion (Luque, 2011) and our LLCCM on sentences up
to a fixed length n, for n ∈ {10, 15, . . . , 40}. Fig-
ure 1 shows that LLCCM substantially outperforms
the CCM on longer sentences. After length 15,
CCM accuracy falls below the right branching base-
line, whereas LLCCM remains significantly better
than right-branching through length 40.

5 Conclusion
Our log-linear variant of the CCM extends robustly
to long sentences, enabling constituent grammar in-
duction to be used in settings that typically include
long sentences, such as machine translation reorder-
ing (Chiang, 2005; DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011;
Dyer et al., 2011).
