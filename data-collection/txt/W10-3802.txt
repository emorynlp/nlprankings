Abstract

We present two contributions to gram-
mar driven translation. First, since both
Inversion Transduction Grammar and
Linear Inversion Transduction Gram-
mars have been shown to produce bet-
ter alignments then the standard word
alignment tool, we investigate how the
trade-off between speed and end-to-end
translation quality extends to the choice
of grammar formalism. Second, we
prove that Linear Transduction Gram-
mars (LTGs) generate the same transduc-
tions as Linear Inversion Transduction
Grammars, and present a scheme for ar-
riving at LTGs by bilingualizing Linear
Grammars. We also present a method for
obtaining Inversion Transduction Gram-
mars from Linear (Inversion) Transduc-
tion Grammars, which can speed up
grammar induction from parallel corpora
dramatically.

1 Introduction

In this paper we introduce Linear Transduction
Grammars (LTGs), which are the bilingual case
of Linear Grammars (LGs). We also show that
LTGs are equal to Linear Inversion Transduction
Grammars (Saers et al., 2010). To be able to in-
duce transduction grammars directly from par-
allel corpora an approximate search for parses is
needed. The trade-off between speed and end-to-
end translation quality is investigated and com-
pared to Inversion Transduction Grammars (Wu,
1997) and the standard tool for word alignment,

GIZA++ (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996;
Och and Ney, 2003). A heuristic for converting
stochastic bracketing LTGs into stochastic brack-
eting ITGs is presented, and fitted into the speed–
quality trade-off.

In section 3 we give an overview of transduc-
tion grammars, introduce LTGs and show that
they are equal to LITGs. In section 4 we give
a short description of the rational for the trans-
duction grammar pruning used. In section 5 we
describe a way of seeding a stochastic bracketing
ITG with the rules and probabilities of a stochas-
tic bracketing LTG. Section 6 describes the setup,
and results are given in section 7. Finally, some
conclusions are offered in section 8

2 Background

Any form of automatic translation that relies on
generalizations of observed translations needs to
align these translations on a sub-sentential level.
The standard way of doing this is by aligning
words, which works well for languages that use
white space separators between words. The stan-
dard method is a combination of the family of
IBM-models (Brown et al., 1993) and Hidden
Markov Models (Vogel et al., 1996). These
methods all arrive at a function (A) from lan-
guage 1 (F ) to language 2 (E). By running the
process in both directions, two functions can be
estimated and then combined to form an align-
ment. The simplest of these combinations are in-
tersection and union, but usually, the intersection
is heuristically extended. Transduction gram-
mars on the other hand, impose a shared struc-
ture on the sentence pairs, thus forcing a consis-
tent alignment in both directions. This method

10



has proved successful in the settings it has been
tried (Zhang et al., 2008; Saers and Wu, 2009;
Haghighi et al., 2009; Saers et al., 2009; Saers
et al., 2010). Most efforts focus on cutting down
time complexity so that larger data sets than toy-
examples can be processed.

3 Transduction Grammars

Transduction grammars were first introduced in
Lewis and Stearns (1968), and further devel-
oped in Aho and Ullman (1972). The origi-
nal notation called for regular CFG-rules in lan-
guage F with rephrased E productions, either in
curly brackets, or comma separated. The bilin-
gual version of CFGs is called Syntax-Directed
Transduction Grammars (SDTGs). To differenti-
ate identical nonterminal symbols, indices were
used (the bag of nonterminals for the two pro-
ductions are equal by definition).

A → B(1) a B(2) {x B(1) B(2)}
= A → B(1) a B(2), x B(1) B(2)

The semantics of the rules is that one nontermi-
nal rewrites into a bag of nonterminals that is dis-
tributed independently in the two languages, and
interspersed with any number of terminal sym-
bols in the respective languages. As with CFGs,
the terminal symbols can be factored out into
preterminals with the added twist that they are
shared between the two languages, since preter-
minals are formally nonterminals. The above
rule can thus be rephrased as

A → B(1) Xa/x B(2), Xa/x B(1) B(2)
Xa/x → a, x

In this way, rules producing nonterminals and
rules producing terminals can be separated.
Since only nonterminals are allowed to move,
their movement can be represented as the orig-
inal sequence of nonterminals and a permutation
vector as follows:

A → B Xa/x B ; 1, 0, 2
Xa/x → a, x

To keep the reordering as monotone as possible,
the terminals a and x can be produced separately,

but doing so eliminates any possibility of param-
eterizing their lexical relationship. Instead, the
individual terminals are pair up with the empty
string (ǫ).

A → Xx B Xa B ; 0, 1, 2, 3
Xa → a, ǫ
Xx → ǫ, x

Lexical rules involving the empty string are re-
ferred to as singletons. Whenever a preterminal
is used to pair up two terminal symbols, we refer
to that pair of terminals as a biterminal, which
will be written as e/f .

Any SDTG can be rephrased to contain per-
muted nonterminal productions and biterminal
productions only, and we will call this the nor-
mal form of SDTGs. Note that it is not possi-
ble to produce a two-normal form for SDTGs,
as there are some rules that are not binarizable
(Wu, 1997; Huang et al., 2009). This is an
important point to make, since efficient parsing
for CFGs is based on either restricting parsing
to only handle binary grammars (Cocke, 1969;
Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967), or rely on on-
the-fly binarization (Earley, 1970). When trans-
lating with a grammar, parsing only has to be
done in F , which is binarizable (since it is a
CFG), and can therefor be computed in polyno-
mial time (O(n3)). Once there is a parse tree
for F , the corresponding tree for E can be eas-
ily constructed. When inducing a grammar from
examples, however, biparsing (finding an anal-
ysis that is consistent across a sentence pair) is
needed. The time complexity for biparsing with
SDTGs is O(n2n+2), which is clearly intractable.

Inversion Transduction Grammars or ITGs
(Wu, 1997) are transduction grammars that have
a two-normal form, thus guaranteeing binariz-
ability. Defining the rank of a rule as the number
of nonterminals in the production, and the rank
of a grammar as the highest ranking rule in the
rule set, ITGs are a) any SDTG of rank two, b)
any SDTG of rank three or c) any SDTG where no
rule has a permutation vector other than identity
permutation or inversion permutation. It follows
from this definition that ITGs have a two-normal
form, which is usually expressed as SDTG rules,

11



with brackets around the production to distin-
guish the different kinds of rules from each other.

A → B C ; 0, 1 = A → [ B C ]
A → B C ; 1, 0 = A → 〈 B C 〉
A → e/f = A → e/f

By guaranteeing binarizability, biparsing time
complexity becomes O(n6).

There is an even more restricted version of
SDTGs called Simple Transduction Grammar
(STG), where no permutation at all is allowed,
which can also biparse a sentence pair in O(n6)
time.

A Linear Transduction Grammar (LTG) is a
bilingual version of a Linear Grammar (LG).

Definition 1. An LG in normal form is a tuple

GL = 〈N,Σ, R, S〉

Where N is a finite set of nonterminal symbols,
Σ is a finite set of terminal symbols, R is a finite
set of rules and S ∈ N is the designated start
symbol. The rule set is constrained so that

R ⊆ N × (Σ ∪ {ǫ})N(Σ ∪ {ǫ}) ∪ {ǫ}

Where ǫ is the empty string.

To bilingualize a linear grammar, we will take
the same approach as taken when a finite-state
automaton is bilingualized into a finite-state
transducer. That is: to replace all terminal sym-
bols with biterminal symbols.

Definition 2. An LTG in normal form is a tuple

T GL = 〈N,Σ,∆, R, S〉

Where N is a finite set of nonterminal symbols,
Σ is a finite set of terminal symbols in language
E, ∆ is a finite set of terminal symbols in lan-
guage F , R is a finite set of linear transduction
rules and S ∈ N is the designated start symbol.
The rule set is constrained so that

R ⊆ N ×ΨNΨ ∪ {〈ǫ, ǫ〉}

Where Ψ = Σ∪{ǫ}×∆∪{ǫ} and ǫ is the empty
string.

Graphically, we will represent LTG rules as pro-
duction rules with biterminals:

〈A, 〈x, p〉B〈y, q〉〉 = A → x/p B y/q
〈A, 〈ǫ, ǫ〉〉 = B → ǫ/ǫ

Like STGs, LTGs do not allow any reordering,
and are monotone, but because they are linear,
this has no impact on expressiveness, as we shall
see later.

Linear Inversion Transduction Grammars
(LITGs) were introduced in Saers et al. (2010),
and represent ITGs that are allowed to have at
most one nonterminal symbol in each produc-
tion. These are attractive because they can bi-
parse a sentence pair in O(n4) time, which can
be further reduced to linear time by severely
pruning the search space. This makes them
tractable for large parallel corpora, and a viable
way to induce transduction grammars from large
parallel corpora.

Definition 3. An LITG in normal form is a tuple

T GLI = 〈N,Σ,∆, R, S〉

Where N is a finite set of nonterminal symbols,
Σ is a finite set of terminal symbols from lan-
guage E, ∆ is a finite set of terminal symbols
from language F , R is a set of rules and S ∈ N
is the designated start symbol. The rule set is
constrained so that

R ⊆ N × {[], 〈〉} ×ΨN ∪NΨ ∪ {〈ǫ, ǫ〉}

Where [] represents identity permutation and 〈〉
represents inversion permutation, Ψ = Σ∪{ǫ}×
∆ ∪ {ǫ} is a possibly empty biterminal, and ǫ is
the empty string.

Graphically, a rule will be represented as an ITG
rule:

〈A, [], B〈e, f〉〉 = A → [ B e/f ]
〈A, 〈〉, 〈e, f〉B〉 = A → 〈 e/f B 〉

〈A, [], 〈ǫ, ǫ〉〉 = A → ǫ/ǫ

As with ITGs, productions with only biterminals
will be represented without their permutation, as
any such rule can be trivially rewritten into in-
verted or identity form.

12



Definition 4. An ǫ-free LITG is an LITG where
no rule may rewrite one nonterminal into another
nonterminal only. Formally, the rule set is con-
strained so that

R ∩N × {[], 〈〉} × ({〈ǫ, ǫ〉}B ∪B{〈ǫ, ǫ〉}) = ∅

The LITG presented in Saers et al. (2010) is
thus an ǫ-free LITG in normal form, since it has
the following thirteen rule forms (of which 8 are
meaningful, 1 is only used to terminate genera-
tion and 4 are redundant):

A → [ e/f B ]
A → 〈 e/f B 〉
A → [ B e/f ]
A → 〈 B e/f 〉
A → [ e/ǫ B ] | A → 〈 e/ǫ B 〉
A → [ B e/ǫ ] | A → 〈 B e/ǫ 〉
A → [ ǫ/f B ] | A → 〈 B ǫ/f 〉
A → [ B ǫ/f ] | A → 〈 ǫ/f B 〉
A → ǫ/ǫ

All the singleton rules can be expressed either in
straight or inverted form, but the result of apply-
ing the two rules are the same.

Lemma 1. Any LITG in normal form can be ex-
pressed as an LTG in normal form.

Proof. The above LITG can be rewritten in LTG
form as follows:

A → [ e/f B ] = A → e/f B
A → 〈 e/f B 〉 = A → e/ǫ B ǫ/f
A → [ B e/f ] = A → B e/f
A → 〈 B e/f 〉 = A → ǫ/f B e/ǫ
A → [ e/ǫ B ] = A → e/ǫ B
A → [ B e/ǫ ] = A → B e/ǫ
A → [ ǫ/f B ] = A → ǫ/f B
A → [ B ǫ/f ] = A → B ǫ/f
A → ǫ/ǫ = A → ǫ/ǫ

To account for all LITGs in normal form, the fol-
lowing two non-ǫ-free rules also needs to be ac-
counted for:

A → [ B ] = A → B
A → 〈 B 〉 = A → B

Lemma 2. Any LTG in normal form can be ex-
pressed as an LITG in normal form.

Proof. An LTG in normal form has two rules,
which can be rewritten in LITG form, either as
straight or inverted rules as follows

A → x/p B y/q = A → [ x/p B̄ ]
B̄ → [ B y/q ]

= A → 〈 x/q B̄ 〉
B̄ → 〈 B y/p 〉

A → ǫ/ǫ = A → ǫ/ǫ

Theorem 1. LTGs in normal form and LITGs in
normal form express the same class of transduc-
tions.

Proof. Follows from lemmas 1 and 2.

By theorem 1 everything concerning LTGs is also
applicable to LITGs, and an LTG can be expressed
in LITG form when convenient, and vice versa.

4 Pruning the Alignment Space

The alignment space for a transduction grammar
is the combinations of the parse spaces of the
sentence pair. Let e be the E sentence, and f
be the F sentence. The parse spaces would be
O(|e|2) and O(|f |2) respectively, and the com-
bination of these spaces would be O(|e|2×|f |2),
or O(n4) if we assume n to be proportional
to the sentence lengths. In the case of LTGs,
this space is searched linearly, giving time com-
plexity O(n4), and in the case of ITGs there
is branching within both parse spaces, adding
an order of magnitude each, giving a total time
complexity of O(n6). There is, in other words,
a tight connection between the alignment space
and the time complexity of the biparsing al-
gorithm. Furthermore, most of this alignment
space is clearly useless. Consider the case where
the entire F sentence is deleted, and the entire E
sentence is simply inserted. Although it is pos-
sible that it is allowed by the grammar, it should
have a negligible probability (since it is clearly a
translation strategy that generalize poorly), and
could, for all practical reasons, be ignored.

German–English 115,323 1,602,781

Table 1: Size of training data.

Saers et al. (2009) present a scheme for prun-
ing away most of the points in the alignment
space. Parse items are binned according to cov-
erage (the total number of words covered), and
each bin is restricted to carry a maximum of b
items. Any items that do not fit in the bins are
excluded from further analysis. To decide which
items to keep, inside probability is used. This
pruning scheme effectively linearizes the align-
ment space, as is will be of size O(nb), regard-
less of what type grammar is used. An ITG can
thus be biparsed in cubic time, and an LTG in lin-
ear time.

5 Seeding an ITG with an LTG

Since LTGs are a subclass of ITGs, it would be
possible to convert an LTG to a ITG. This could
save a lot of time, since LTGs are much faster to
induce from corpora than ITGs.

Converting a BLTG to a BITG is fairly straight
forward. Consider the BLTG rule

X → [ e/f X ]

To convert it to BITG in two-normal form, the
biterminal has to be factored out. Replacing
the biterminal with a temporary symbol X̄ , and
introducing a rule that rewrites this temporary
symbol to the replaced biterminal produces two
rules:

X → [ X̄ X ]
X̄ → e/f

This is no longer a bracketing grammar since
there are two nonterminals, but equating X̄ to X
restores this property. An analogous procedure
can be applied in the case where the nonterminal
comes before the biterminal, as well as for the
inverting cases.

When converting stochastic LTGs, the proba-
bility mass of the SLTG rule has to be distributed

to two SITG rules. The fact that the LTG rule
X → ǫ/ǫ lacks correspondence in ITGs has to
be weighted in as well. In this paper we took the
maximum entropy approach and distributed the
probability mass uniformly. This means defin-
ing the probability mass function p′ for the new
SBITG from the probability mass function p of
the original SBLTG such that:

6 Setup

The aim of this paper is to compare the align-
ments from SBITG and SBLTG to those from
GIZA++, and to study the impact of pruning
on efficiency and translation quality. Initial
grammars will be estimated by counting cooc-
currences in the training corpus, after which
expectation-maximization (EM) will be used to
refine the initial estimate. At the last iteration,
the one-best parse of each sentence will be con-
sidered as the word alignment of that sentence.

In order to keep the experiments comparable,
relatively small corpora will be used. If larger
corpora were used, it would not be possible to get
any results for unpruned SBITGs because of the
prohibitive time complexity. The Europarl cor-
pus (Koehn, 2005) was used as a starting point,
and then all sentence pairs where one of the sen-
tences were longer than 10 tokens were filtered

out (see table 1). The GIZA++ system was built
according to the instructions for creating a base-
line system for the Fifth Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation (WMT’10),1 but the above
corpora were used instead of those supplied by
the workshop. This includes word alignment
with GIZA++, a 5-gram language model built
with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) and parameter tun-
ing with MERT (Och, 2003). To carry out the ac-
tual translations, Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) was
used. The SBITG and SBLTG systems were built
in exactly the same way, except that the align-
ments from GIZA++ were replaced by those from
the respective grammars.

In addition to trying out exhaustive biparsing

1http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/

for SBITGs and SBLTGs on three different trans-
lation tasks, several different levels of pruning
were tried (1, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100). We also
used the grammar induced from SBLTGs with a
beam size of 25 to seed SBITGs (see section 5),
which were then run for an additional iteration
of EM, also with beam size 25.

All systems are evaluated with BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002).

7 Results

The results for the three different translation
tasks are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4. It is
interesting to note that the trend they portray is
quite similar. When the beam is very narrow,
GIZA++ is better, but already at beam size 10,
both transduction grammars are superior. Con-

sistent with Saers et al. (2009), SBITG has a sharp
rise in quality going from beam size 1 to 10,
and then a gentle slope up to beam size 25, af-
ter which it levels out. SBLTG, on the other hand
start out at a respectable level, and goes up a gen-
tle slope from beam size 1 to 10, after which is
level out. This is an interesting observation, as it
suggests that SBLTG reaches its optimum with a
lower beam size (although that optimum is lower
than that of SBITG). The trade-off between qual-
ity and time can now be extended beyond beam
size to include grammar choice. In Figure 1, run
times are plotted against BLEU scores to illus-

trate this trade-off. It is clear that SBLTGs are
indeed much faster than SBITGs, the only excep-
tion is when SBITGs are run with b = 1, but then
the BLEU score is so low that is is not worth con-
sidering.

The time may seem inconsistent between b =
100 and b = ∞ for SBLTG, but the extra time
for the tighter beam is because of beam manage-
ment, which the exhaustive search doesn’t bother
with.

In table 5 we compare the pure approaches
to one where an LTG was trained during 10 it-
erations of EM and then used to seed (see sec-

tion 5) an SBITG, which was then trained for
one iteration of EM. Although the differences
are fairly small, German–English and Spanish–
English seem to reach the level of SBITG,
whereas French–English is actually hurt. The
big difference is in time, since the combined sys-
tem needs about a fifth of the time the SBITG-
based system needs. This phenomenon needs to
be more thoroughly examined.

It is also worth noting that GIZA++ was beaten
by an aligner that used less than 20 minutes (less
than 2 minutes per iteration and at most 10 itera-
tions) to align the corpus.

8 Conclusions

In this paper we have introduced the bilingual
version of linear grammar: Linear Transduc-
tion Grammars, and found that they generate the
same class of transductions as Linear Inversion
Transduction Grammars. We have also com-
pared Stochastic Bracketing versions of ITGs and
LTGs to GIZA++ on three word alignment tasks.
The efficiency issues with transduction gram-
mars have been addressed by pruning, and the
conclusion is that there is a trade-off between
run time and translation quality. A part of the
trade-off is choosing which grammar framework
to use, as LTGs are faster but not as good as ITGs.
It also seems possible to take a short-cut in this
trade-off by starting out with an LTG and convert-
ing it to an ITG. We have also showed that it is

possible to beat the translation quality of GIZA++
with a quite fast transduction grammar.
