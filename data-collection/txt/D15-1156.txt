Abstract

We describe an approach for machine
learning-based empty category detection
that is based on the phrase structure analy-
sis of Japanese. The problem is formal-
ized as tree node classification, and we
find that the path feature, the sequence of
node labels from the current node to the
root, is highly effective. We also find that
the set of dot products between the word
embeddings for a verb and those for case
particles can be used as a substitution for
case frames. Experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms the previ-
ous state-of the art method by 68.6% to
73.2% in terms of F-measure.

1 Introduction

Empty categories are phonetically null elements
that are used for representing dropped pro-
nouns (“pro” or “small pro”), controlled elements
(“PRO” or “big pro”) and traces of movement
(“T” or “trace”), such as WH-questions and rela-
tive clauses. They are important for pro-drop lan-
guages such as Japanese, in particular, for the ma-
chine translation from pro-drop languages to non-
pro-drop languages such as English. Chung and
Gildea (2010) reported their recover of empty cat-
egories improved the accuracy of machine trans-
lation both in Korean and in Chinese. Kudo et
al. (2014) showed that generating zero subjects in
Japanese improved the accuracy of preordering-
based translation.

State-of-the-art statistical syntactic parsers had
typically ignored empty categories. Although
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) has annota-
tions on PRO and trace, they provide only labeled
bracketing. Johnson (2002) proposed a statistical
pattern-matching algorithm for post-processing
the results of syntactic parsing based on minimal

unlexicalized tree fragments from empty node to
its antecedent. Dienes and Dubey (2003) proposed
a machine learning-based “trace tagger” as a pre-
process of parsing. Campbell (2004) proposed a
rule-based post-processing method based on lin-
guistically motivated rules. Gabbard et al. (2006)
replaced the rules with machine learning-based
classifiers. Schmid (2006) and Cai et al. (2011)
integrated empty category detection with the syn-
tactic parsing.

Empty category detection for pro (dropped pro-
nouns or zero pronoun) has begun to receive at-
tention as the Chinese Penn Treebank (Xue et al.,
2005) has annotations for pro as well as PRO
and trace. Xue and Yang (2013) formalized the
problem as classifying each pair of the location
of empty category and its head word in the de-
pendency structure. Wang et al. (2015) pro-
posed a joint embedding of empty categories and
their contexts on dependency structure. Xiang et
al. (2013) formalized the problem as classifying
each IP node (roughly corresponds to S and SBAR
in Penn Treebank) in the phrase structure.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for
empty category detection for Japanese that uses
conjunction features on phrase structure and word
embeddings. We use the Keyaki Treebank (But-
ler et al., 2012), which is a recent development.
As it has annotations for pro and trace, we show
our method has substantial improvements over the
state-of-the-art machine learning-based method
(Xiang et al., 2013) for Chinese empty category
detection as well as linguistically-motivated man-
ually written rule-based method similar to (Camp-
bell, 2004).

2 Baseline systems

The Keyaki Treebank annotates the phrase struc-
ture with functional information for Japanese sen-
tences following a scheme adapted from the Anno-

tree based on Xiang et al.’s (2013) formalism)

the PCEEC (Santorini, 2010). There are some ma-
jor changes: the VP level of structure is typically
absent, function is marked on all clausal nodes
(such as IP-REL and CP-THT) and all NPs that
are clause level constituents (such as NP-SBJ).
Disambiguation tags are also used for clarifying
the functions of its immediately preceding node,
such as NP-OBJ *を *(wo) for PP, however, we re-
moved them in our experiment.

Keyaki Treebank has annotation for trace mark-
ers of relative clauses (*T*) and dropped pronouns
(*pro*), however, it deliberately has no annota-
tion for control dependencies (PRO) (Butler et al.,
2015). It has also fine grained empty categories
of *pro* such as *speaker* and *hearer*, but we
unified them into *pro* in our experiment.

HARUNIWA(Fang et al., 2014) is a Japanese
phrase structure parser trained on the treebank. It
has a rule-based post-processor for adding empty
categories, which is similar to (Campbell, 2004).
We call it RULE in later sections and use it as one
of two baselines.

We also use Xiang et al’s (2013) model as an-
other baseline. It formulates empty category de-
tection as the classification of IP nodes. For ex-
ample, in Figure 1, empty nodes in the left tree
are removed and encoded as additional labels with
its position information to IP nodes in the right
tree. As we can uniquely decode them from the
extended IP labels, the problem is to predict the
labels for the input tree that has no empty nodes.

Let T = t1t2 · · · tn be the sequence of nodes
produced by the post-order traversal from root

node, and ei be the empty category tag associated
with ti. The probability model of (Xiang et al.,
2013) is formulated as MaxEnt model:

P (en1 |T ) =
n∏

i=1

P (ei|ei−11 , T )

=
n∏

i=1

exp(θ · φ(ei, ei−11 , T ))
Z(ei−11 , T )

(1)

where φ is a feature vector, θ is a weight vector to
φ and Z is normalization factor:

Z(ei−11 , T ) =
∑
e∈E

exp(θ · φ(e, ei−11 , T ))

where E represents the set of all empty category
types to be detected.

Xiang et al. (2013) grouped their features into
four types: tree label features, lexical features,
empty category features and conjunction features
as shown in Table 1. As the features for (Xiang et
al., 2013) were developed for Chinese Penn Tree-
bank, we modify their features for Keyaki Tree-
bank: First, the traversal order is changed from
post-order (bottom-up) to pre-order (top-down).
As PROs are implicit in Keyaki Treebank, the de-
cisions on IPs in lower levels depend on those on
higher levels in the tree. Second, empty category
features are extracted from ancestor IP nodes, not
from descendant IP nodes, in accordance with the
first change.

Table 2 shows the accuracies of Japanese empty
category detection, using the original and our
modification of the (Xiang et al., 2013) with ab-
lation test. We find that the conjunction features

are highly effective compared to the three other
features. This observation leads to the model pro-
posed in the next section.

3 Proposed model

In the proposed model, we use combinations of
path features and three other features, namely head
word feature, child feature and empty category
feature. Path feature (PATH) is a sequence of non-
terminal labels from the current node to the ances-
tor nodes up to either the root node or the nearest
CP node. For example, in Figure 1, if the current
node is IP-REL, four paths are extracted; IP-REL,
IP-REL → NP, IP-REL → NP → PP and IP-REL
→ NP → PP → IP-MAT.

Head word feature (HEAD) is the surface form
of the lexical head of the current node. Child fea-
ture (CHILD) is the set of labels for the children of
the current node. The label is augmented with the
surface form of the rightmost terminal node if it is
a function word. In the example of Figure 1, if the
current node is IP-MAT, HEAD is連れ (tsure) and
CHILD includes: PP-を (wo), VB, VB2, AXD-た
(ta) and PU-。 . Empty category feature (EC) is a
set of empty categories detected in the ancestor IP
nodes. For example in Figure 1, if the current node
is IP-REL, EC is *pro*.

We then combine the PATH with others. If the
current node is the IP-MAT node in right-half of
Figure 1, the combination of PATH and HEAD
is:IP-MAT× 連れ (tsure) and the combinations
of PATH and CHILD are: IP-MAT×PP-を (wo),
IP-MAT×VB, IP-MAT×VB2, IP-MAT×AXD-た
(ta) and IP-MAT×PU-。 .
3.1 Using Word Embedding to approximate

Case Frame Lexicon
A case frame lexicon would be obviously useful
for empty category detection because it provides
information on the type of argument the verb in
question takes. The problem is that case frame lex-
icon is not usually readily available. We propose
a novel method to approximate case frame lexicon
for languages with explicit case marking such as
Japanese using word embeddings. According to
(Pennington et al., 2014), they designed their em-
bedding model GloVe so that the dot product of
two word embeddings approximates the logarithm
of their co-occurrence counts. Using this charac-
teristic, we can easily make a feature that approxi-
mate the case frame of a verb. Given a set of word
embeddings for case particles q1, q2, · · · , qN ∈ Q,
the distributed case frame feature (DCF) for a verb
wi is defined as:

ṽi = wi · (q1, q2, · · · , qN ) (2)
vi =

ṽi
||ṽi|| (3)

In our experiment, we used a set of high frequency
case particlesが (ga),は (ha), も (mo),の (no), を
(wo),に (ni),へ (he) andから (kara) as Q.

are 22,639 sentences in Keyaki Treebank. We used
1,000 sentences as the development set, 1,003
sentences as the test set. They were taken from
the files blog KNB.psd (blog), spoken CIAIR.psd
(transcript), newswire MAINICHI-1995.psd
(newswire) to balance the domain. The remaining
20,646 sentences are used for training. Further
statistics are shown in Table 3.

We used GloVe as word embedding, Wikipedia
articles in Japanese as of January 18, 2015, are
used for training, which amounted to 660 million
words and 23.4 million sentences. By using the
development set, we set the dimension of word
embedding and the window size for co-occurrence
counts as 200 and 10, respectively.

4.2 Result and Discussion

We tested in two conditions: gold parse and sys-
tem parse. In gold parse condition, we used
the trees of Keyaki Treebank without empty cat-
egories as input to the systems. In system parse
condition, we used the output of the Berkeley
Parser model of HARUNIWA before rule-based
empty category detection1. We evaluated them us-
ing the word-position-level identification metrics
described in (Xiang et al., 2013). It projects the
predicted empty category tags to the surface level.
An empty node is regarded as correctly predicted
surface position in the sentence, type (T or pro)
and function (SBJ, OB1 and so on) are matched
with the reference.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
1There are two models available in HARUNIWA, namely

the BitPar model (Schmid, 2004) and Berkeley Parser binary
branching model (Petrov and Klein, 2007). The output of
the later is first flattened, then added disambiguation tags and
empty categories using tsurgeon script (Levy and Andrew,
2006).

distributed case frame (DCF), we used an exist-
ing case frame lexicon (Kawahara and Kurohashi,
2006) and tested three different ways of encod-
ing the case frame information: BIN encodes each
case as binary features. SET encodes each combi-
nation of required cases as a binary feature. DIST
is a vector of co-occurrence counts for each case
particle, which can be thought of an unsmoothed
version of our DCF.

Table 4 shows the accuracies of various empty
category detection methods, for both gold parse
and system parse. In the gold parse condition, the
two baselines, the rule-based method (RULE) and
the modified (Xiang et al., 2013) method, achieved
the F-measure of 62.6% and 68.6% respectively.

We also implemented the third baseline based
on (Johnson, 2002). Minimal unlexicalized tree
fragments from empty node to its antecedent were
extracted as pattern rules based on corpus statis-
tics. For *pro*, which has no antecedent, we used
the statistics from empty node to the root. Al-
though the precision of the method is high, the re-
call is very low, which results in the F-measure of
38.1%.

Among the proposed models, the combination
of path feature and child feature (PATH×CHILD)
even outperformed the baselines. It reached 73.2%
with all features. As for the result of system-
parse condition, the F-measure dropped consider-
ably from 73.2% to 54.7% mostly due to the pars-
ing errors on the IP nodes and its function.

We find that there are no significant differences
among the different encodings of the case frame
lexicon, and the improvement brought by the pro-
posed distributed case frame is comparable to the
existing case frame lexicon.

Table 5 shows the ablation result of the pro-
posed model. It indicates conjunction between
PATH and CHILD feature is most effective.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel model for
empty category detection in Japanese using path
features and the distributed case frames. Although
it achieved fairly high accuracy for the gold parse,
there is much room for improvement when applied
to the output of a syntactic parser. Since the accu-
racy of the empty category detection implemented
as a post-process highly depends on that of the un-
derlying parser, we want to explore models that
can solve them jointly, such as the lattice parsing
approach of (Cai et al., 2011). We would like to
report the results in the future version of this pa-
per.
