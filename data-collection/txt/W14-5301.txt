Abstract 

When PRC was founded on mainland China and the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the 

relation between mainland China and Taiwan became a classical Cold War instance. Neither 

travel, visit, nor correspondences were allowed between the people until 1987, when 

government on both sides started to allow small number of Taiwan people with relatives in 

China to return to visit through a third location. Although the thawing eventually lead to 

frequent exchanges, direct travel links, and close commercial ties between Taiwan and 

mainland China today, 38 years of total isolation from each other did allow the language use to 

develop into different varieties, which have become a popular topic for mainly lexical studies 
(e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang & Li, 1996). Grammatical difference of these two variants, 
however, was not well studied beyond anecdotal observation, partly because the near identity 

of their grammatical systems. This paper focuses on light verb variations in Mainland and 

Taiwan variants and finds that the light verbs of these two variants indeed show distributional 

tendencies. Light verbs are chosen for two reasons: first, they are semantically bleached hence 

more susceptible to changes and variations. Second, the classification of light verbs is a 

challenging topic in NLP. We hope our study will contribute to the study of light verbs in 

Chinese in general. The data adopted for this study was a comparable corpus extracted from 

Chinese Gigaword Corpus and manually annotated with contextual features that may 

contribute to light verb variations. A multivariate analysis was conducted to show that for each 

light verb there is at least one context where the two variants show differences in tendencies 

(usually the presence/absence of a tendency rather than contrasting tendencies) and can be 

differentiated. In addition, we carried out a K-Means clustering analysis for the variations and 

the results are consistent with the multivariate analysis, i.e. the light verbs in Mainland and 

Taiwan indeed have variations and the variations can be successfully differentiated. 

1 Introduction: Language Variations in the Chinese Context 

Commonly dichotomy of language and dialect is not easily maintained in the context of Chinese 

language(s). Cantonese, Min, Hakka, and Wu are traditionally referred to as dialects of Chinese but 

are mutually unintelligible. However, they do share a common writing system and literary and textual 

tradition, which allows speakers to have a shared linguistic identity. To overcome the mutual 

unintelligibility problem, a variant of Northern Mandarin Chinese, is designated as the common 

language about a hundred years ago (called 普通話 Putonghua ‘common language’ in Mainland 

China, and 國語  Guoyu ‘national language’ in Taiwan). Referred to as Mandarin or Mandarin 
Chinese, or simply Chinese nowadays, this is the one of the most commonly learned first or second 

languages in the world now. However, not unlike English, with the fast globalization of the Chinese 

language, both the term ‘World Chineses’ and the recognition that there are different variants of 

Chinese emerged. In this paper, we studied two of the most important variants of Chinese, Mainland 

Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin.

1.1 Variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin: Previous studies 

The lexical differences between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin have been the focus of research in 

Chinese Linguistics in the recent years. A number of studies were carried out on lexical variations 

between these two variants of Mandarin Chinese, including variations in the meanings of the same 

word or using different words to express the same meaning (e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang,1996). 

Some dictionaries also list the lexical differences between Mainland Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin 

(e.g., Qiu, 1990; Wei & Sheng, 2000).  

By contrast, only a few of such studies were corpus driven (e.g. Hong and Huang 2008, 2013; 

Huang and Lin, 2013), and even few studies have been done on the grammatical variations of 

Mainland and Taiwan Chinese. Huang et al. (2013), the only such study based on comparable corpora 

so far, suggested that the subtlety of the underlining grammatical variations of these two dialectal 

variants at early stage of divergence may have contributed to the challenge as well as scarcity of 

previous studies.  

1.2 Light Verbs in Light Verb Variations 

The study of English light verb constructions (LVCs) (e.g., take a look, make an offer) has been an 

important topic in linguistics (Jespersen, 1965; Butt and Geuder, 2003; among others) as well as in 

Computational Linguistics (Tu and Dan, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2010; among others). 

Identification of LVCs is a fundamental crucial task for Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation. For example, Tu and Dan (2011) 

proposed a supervised learning system to automatically identify English LVCs by training with groups 

of contextual or statistical features. Nagy et al. (2013) introduced a system that enables the full 

coverage identification of English LVCs in running context by using a machine leaning approach.  

However, little work has been done to identify Chinese LVCs, especially between different 

variants of Chinese (cf. Hwang et al., 2010). Chinese LVCs are similar to English LVCs in the sense 

that the light verb itself is semantically bleached and does not contain any eventive or contentive 

information, so the predicative information of the construction mainly comes from the complement 

taken by the light verb (e.g., Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982). For instance, 進行 jinxing originally 

meant ‘move forward/proceed’, but in an LVC such as 進行討論 jinxing taolun proceed discuss ‘to 

discuss’, 進行 jinxing only contributes aspectual information whereas the core meaning of the LVC 

comes from the complement 討論 taolun ‘discuss’. Chinese also differs from English in that many of 
the Chinese light verbs have similar usages and thus are often interchangeable, e.g., all the five light 

verbs 從事 congshi, 搞 gao, 加以 jiayi, 進行 jinxing, and 做 zuo can take 研究 yanjiu ‘do research’ 
as their complement and form a LVC. But Huang et al. (2013) also observed that differences in 

collocation constraints can sometimes be found between different variants of Mandarin Chinese. For 

instance, constructions like 進行投票 jinxing tou-piao proceed cast-ticket ‘to cast votes’, where the 
complement is in the V(erb)-O(bject) form, usually can only be found in Taiwan Mandarin. Hence, 

Chinese LVCs are challenging for both linguistic studies and computational applications in two 

aspects: (a) to identify collocation constraints of the different light verbs in order to automatically 

classify and predict their uses in context, and (b) to identify the collocation constraints of the same 

light verb in order to differentiate and predict the two Chinese variants based on the use of such light 

verbs. The first issue has been explored in Lin et al. (2014): by analyzing Mainland and Taiwan 

Mandarin data extracted from comparable corpora with statistical and machine learning approaches, 

the authors find the five light verbs 從事 congshi, 搞 gao, 加以 jiayi, 進行 jinxing, and 做 zuo can 
be reliably differentiated from each other in each variety. But to the best of our knowledge, there has 

been no previous computational study on modeling the light verb variations, or other syntactic 

variations of Chinese dialects or variants of the same dialect. Therefore, this paper builds on the study 

of Lin et al. (2014) and will adopt a comparable corpus driven approach to model light verb variations 

in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 

2 Data and annotation 

Our study focuses on five light verbs, 加以 jiayi, 進行 jinxing, 從事 congshi, 搞 gao and 做 zuo 
(these words literally meant ‘proceed’, ‘inflict’, ‘engage’, ‘do’, and ‘do’ respectively). These five are 

2



chosen for two reasons. First, they are the most frequently used light verbs in Mandarin Chinese (Diao, 

2004); second, although the definition of Chinese light verbs is still debatable, these five are 

considered the most typical light verbs in most previous studies.   

The data for this study was extracted from the Annotated Chinese Gigaword Corpus (Huang, 2009) 

maintained by LDC which contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, consisting of 700 million 

characters from Taiwan Central News Agency (CNA) and 400 million characters from Mainland 

Xinhua News Agency (XNA). For each of the five light verbs, 400 sentences were randomly selected, 

half from the Mainland XNA corpus and the other half from the Taiwan CNA Corpus, which results in 

2,000 sentences in total.  

Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 2013; among others) have 

proposed several syntactic and semantic features to compare and identify the similarities and 

differences among light verbs. For example, while Taiwan 從事 congshi can take informal or 

semantically negative event complements such as 性交易 xingjiaoyi ‘sexual trade’, Mainland 從事 
congshi is rarely found with such complements (Huang et al. 2013). 

In our study, we selected 11 features covering both syntactic and semantic features which may help 

to identify light verb variations, as in Table 1. All 2,000 sentences with light verbs were manually 

annotated with the 11 features. The annotator is a trained expert on Chinese linguistics. All ambiguous 

cases were discussed with another two experts in order to reach an agreement (the features and 

annotation were the same with Lin et al. (2014)). 

 

3 Modelling and Predicting Two Variants 

We carried out both a multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithm to explore the possible 

differences existing between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin light verbs. Our analysis shows that for 

each light verb, there is at least one context where the two variants of Mandarin show differences in 

usage tendencies and thus can be differentiated, although the differences more often lie in the 

presence/absence of a tendency rather than complementary distribution.   

3.1 Multivariate Analysis of Light Verb Variations 

As introduced in Section 1, the five or some of the five light verbs sometimes can be interchangeably 

used in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. This indicates that the interchangeable light verbs share 

some features. In other words, it is unlikely that a particular feature is preferred by only one light verb 

and thus differentiates the verb from the others. This is also proved in Lin et al. (2014). For instance, 

their study finds both Mainland and Taiwan 從事 congshi and 搞 gao significantly prefer nominal 
complements (POS.N). Therefore, to better explore the light verb differences in the two variants, we 

adopt a multivariate analysis for this study.  

The multivariate analysis we used is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe 2008, cf. Han et al. 

2013, Bresnan et al. 2007), and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous 

package in R (Arppe 2008). The polytomous logistic regression is an extension of standard logistic 

regression; it calculates the odds of the occurrence of a particular light verb when a particular feature 

is present, with all other features being equal (Arppe, 2008). In addition, it also allows for 

simultaneous estimation of the occurrence probability of all the five light verbs. 

Before we discuss the light verb variations based on multivariate analysis, we will show that the 

polytomous multivariate model adopted is reliable for our study. Table 2 presents the probability 

estimates of Mainland and Taiwan light verbs calculated by the model. The results indicate that the 

overall performance of the model is good: the most frequently predicted light verb (in each column) 

corresponds to the light verb that actually occurs in the data (in each row) (see the numbers in bold).  

In addition, the recall, precision, and F-measure of the estimates given in Table 3 show that each 

light verb in each variant can be successfully identified with a F-score better than chance (0.2), while 

the performance varies from light verb to light verb, which is thus consistent with the results in Lin et 

al. (2014). The only exception is 搞 gao in Mainland Mandarin, but the low F-score of 搞 gao (0.14) is 
consistent with the linguistic observation that this verb is rarely used as a light verb in Mainland 

Mandarin. More detailed information of the factors that can distinguish the five light verbs in each 

3



variant can also be found in Table 4. In the following of this section, we focus on the variations of

Table 4: Multivariate analysis of light verb variations in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 

Table 4 summarizes the results estimated by the Polytomous multivaraite analysis. The numbers in 

the table are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: odds 

larger than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased by the 

feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland 加以 jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo 
(76.47: 1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25: 1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), PSYEVTyes (19.87: 

1); odds smaller than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly 

descreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland 進行  jinxing occurring is significantly 
decreased by ACCOMPEVTyse (0.1849: 1); in addition, “inf” and “1/inf” refer to odds larger than 

10,000 and smaller than 1/10,000 respectively, and non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given in 

parentheses, regardless of the odds value.  

Table 4 finds that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin indeed show some variations in each light verb. 

Furthermore, the variations of each light verb mainly lie in non-complementary distributional patterns. 

That is, as highlighted in dark grey colour in Table 4, the odds differences are more often between 

non-significance (odds in parentheses) and significance (odds larger or smaller than 1), rather than 

between significant preference (odds larger than 1) and significant dis-preference (odds smaller than 

1). In other words, the difference of a light verb in the two variants is more comparative, rather than 

5



contrastive.  This explains why the variations are not easily found by traditional linguistic studies. 

The following summarizes the key variations of each light verb.  

 

從事 congshi 

從事 congshi in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin has no feature significantly in its favor and it 

is significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (taking two-argument complements, e.g., 研究 yanjiu ‘to 

research’) and INTEREVTyes (taking complements denoting interactive activities, e.g., 商量 

shangliang ‘to discuss’). However, Taiwan 從事  congshi is differentiated from Mainland 從事 
congshi in that the former is also disfavored by FOREVTyes (taking complements denoting formal 

events, e.g., 研究 yanjiu ‘to research’) and VOCOMPyes (taking complements in the form of V(erb)-

O(bject), e.g., 投票 toupiao ‘cast a vote’), whereas the latter is not. The finding that Taiwan 從事 
congshi is less likely to take formal event as its complement is consistent with that in Huang et al. 

(2013).  

 

搞 gao 

Both Mainland and Taiwan 搞 gao are significantly favored by ARGSTRzero (taking zero-argument 
complements, i.e. noun complement in this study). However, compared with Taiwan Mandarin, 

Mainland 搞 gao is more likely to take two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo), but less likely to 

take complements denoting accomplishment events (ACCOMPEVTyes, e.g., 解決 jiejue ‘to solve’), 
and it is also disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (i.e. the intercept, 0.02: 1).  

 

加以  jiayi  

Both Mainland and Taiwan 加 以  jiayi are favored by the feature ACCOMPEVTyes 

(accomplishment complement such as 解決  jiejue ‘to solve’), but the chance of occurrence of 

Mainland 加以  jiayi increases with the presence of two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo), 
complements in VO form (VOCOMPyes), and complements denoting mental or phychological 

activities (PSYEVTyes, e.g., 反省 fanxing ‘to introspect’).  

 

進行 jinxing 

Both Mainland and Taiwan 進行 jinxing have INTEREVTyes (taking complements denoting 

interactive activities) and EVECOMPyes (allowing event complements in subject position, e.g., 會議

進行順利 huiyi jinxing shunli meeting procced smoothly ‘The meeting proceeded smoothly’) in their 

favor. However, 進行  jinxing in Mainland Mandarin is less likely to take accomplishment 

complements (ACCOMPEVTyes); whereas 進行 jinxing in Taiwan Mandarin is more disfavored by 
ARGSTRzero, but more likely to take complements in VO form, which is also consistent with the 

findings in Huang et al. (2013).  

 

做 zuo  

The occurrence of 做 zuo in Mainland Mandarin is decreased by factors such as ARGSTRtwo, 

FOREVTyes, and INTEREVTyes, whereas the occurrence of 做 zuo in Taiwan Mandarin is decreased 

by ACCOMPTEVTyes, but significantly increased by ASPle. It is obvious to linguists that 做 zuo in 

both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are frequently found with the perfective marker 了 le, but our 

analysis reveals that the affixation 了 le to Taiwan 做 zuo is much more frequent than that in Mainland.  

3.2 Clustering Analysis of Light Verb Variations 

We adopted a vector space model (VSM) to represent the use of light verbs. The features in Table 1 

could be expanded to 17 binary features. For example, ASP could be expanded into four binary 

features: ASP.le, ASP.zhe, ASP.guo, ASP.none. Each instance of a light verb in the corpus was 

represented by a vector with 17 dimensions. Each dimension stores the value of one of the 17 binary 

features determined by the context where the light verb is used.

Table 5: The distribution of data origin by the clustering result. 

Then we adopt a clustering algorithm K-Means to identify the variations of light verbs in Taiwan 

and Mainland Mandarin. The assumption is that the instances of a light verb will form different 

clusters in the hyperspace according to the distances among them. Each cluster reflects a special use of 

a light verb. For example, there could be one cluster, where all the instances take non-accomplishment 

event argument, e.g., 加以分析/研究/評論  jiayi fenxi/ yanjiu/ pinglun inflict analyze/ research/ 
comment ‘to analyze/ research/ comment’, etc.  

In this sense, if there are light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, the light 

verbs will be distributed to two clusters, one with data mainly from Mainland Mandarin, whereas the 

other mainly from Taiwan Mandarin. Meanwhile, if a cluster contains much more data from one 

variant than the other, it indicates the usage of a light verb is mainly restricted to the variant with more 

data; or if a cluster contains data of similar amount from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, it 

indicates that the two variants share common usages regarding the light verbs. Therefore, for each 

light verb, all 400 examples from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are mixed together for the 

analysis.  

As the K-Means algorithm requires an input of the number N of the clusters, the selection of N is 

then an issue we need to consider. Remembering that the clusters reflect the use of a light verb rather 

than data origin, the selection of N should be based on the consideration of how many different uses a 

light verb may have. As there are 17 expanded binary features, the whole space of the values of the 

vectors is 2
17

 = 128K. However, the number of different uses for a light verb should not be too large. 

There is no problem if N is set slightly larger than the real number of different uses of a light verb. For 

example, if there are 5 different uses for a light verb and we set N=6, then we can imagine that there 

may be two clusters that reflect the same use of the light verb. On the contrary, if N is set too small, all 

different uses will be mixed together. Then, the clustering result may not be able to show any 

interesting result we expected. In our experiments, we set N=10 for all the five light verbs. Especially, 

we use the WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) implementation of the simple K-Means for our experiments. The 

result is shown in Table 5. The key variations of each light verb are summarized as follows.  
 

從事 congshi 

Cluster 5 shows that Mainland 從事 congshi prefers to take complements denoting formal or 

official events in Mainland Mandarin. However, Taiwan 從事 congshi does not show such preference 

as it can take both formal and informal events. Clusters 6 and 9 show that Taiwan 從事 congshi can 

also take complements in VO form, e.g., 進行開票 jinxing kaipiao proceed ballot counting ‘to proceed 

with ballot counting’, but this is not preferred by Mainland 從事 congshi. 
 

搞 gao 

Clusters 6 and 7 together show that the argument of Mainland 搞 gao can occur in the subject 
position in addition to the complement position, but such word order is rarely found in Taiwan data. 

Cluster 3 shows a possibility for Mainland 搞 gao to take arguments denoting events involving 

interactions of participants (e.g., 討論 taolun ‘to discuss’). In addition, Cluster 9 shows the possibility 

7



that Mainland 搞 gao can take complements describing informal events, while the complements to 

Taiwan Mainland 搞 gao are more often formal events (especially political activities).  
 

加以 jiayi 

Cluster 7 suggests Mainland 加以 jiayi show a preference over complements denoting mental or 
psychological events. However, although Clusters 1 and 6 show some difference between Mainland 

and Taiwan 加以 jiayi, our closer examination of the original data found that such differences actually 
do not reflect any variant-specific uses.  

 

進行 jinxing 

Cluster 6 suggests that Mainland 進行 jinxing show a preference over the aspectual marker 了 -le, 

but such preference is not seen in Taiwan 進行 jinxing. Cluster 8 shows a preference by Taiwan 進行  

jinxing that it could take VO compound (e.g., 投票 toupiao cast-ticket ‘to vote’) as complements, 
while this rarely happens in Mainland. 

 

做 zuo 

Clusters 1 and 3 show that in Mainland Mandarin, it is common for 做 zuo to take the aspectual 

marker 了 -le, but such use of 做 zuo in Taiwan is not as common as in Mainland. 
 

To sum up, the results from the machine learning method are consistent with that from the 

multivariate statistical analysis in Section 3.1. Bringing together, we find that while the light verbs in 

Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin show similarities (as the speakers of these two regions can 

communicate without difficulty), there are indeed also variations in the two variants.   

4 Concluding Remarks 

Our study is the one of the first comparable corpus driven computational modeling studies on newly 

emergent language variants. The automatic identification of Mainland and Taiwan syntactic variations 

has very significant linguistic and computational implications. Linguistically, we showed that our 

comparable corpus driven statistical approach can identify comparative differences which are 

challenging for human analysis. The fact that newly emergent variants differ from each other 

comparatively rather than contrastively may also have important linguistics implications. In addition, 

by successfully differentiating these two variants based on their uses of light verbs, the result also 

suggests that variations among such newly emergent variants may arise from categories that are 

semantically highly bleached and tend to be/or have been grammaticalized. Computationally, the 

ability of machine learning approaches to differentiate Mainland and Taiwan variants of Mandarin 

Chinese potentially contributes to overcoming the challenge of automatic identification of subtle 

language/dialect variations among other light verbs, other lexical categories, as well as other 

languages/dialects.
