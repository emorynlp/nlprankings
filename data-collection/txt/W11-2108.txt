Abstract

SemPOS is an automatic metric of machine
translation quality for Czech and English fo-
cused on content words. It correlates well
with human judgments but it is computation-
ally costly and hard to adapt to other lan-
guages because it relies on a deep-syntactic
analysis of the system output and the refer-
ence. To remedy this, we attempt at approxi-
mating SemPOS using only tagger output and
a few heuristics. At a little expense in corre-
lation to human judgments, we can evaluate
MT systems much faster. Additionally, we de-
scribe our submission to the Tunable Metrics
Task in WMT11.

1 Introduction

SemPOS metric for machine translation quality was
introduced by Kos and Bojar (2009). It is inspired
by a set of metrics relying on various linguistic fea-
tures on syntactic and semantic level introduced by
Giménez and Márquez (2007). One of their best
performing metrics was Semantic role overlapping:
the candidate and the reference translation are rep-
resented as bags of words and their semantic roles.
The similarity between the candidate and the refer-
ence is calculated using a general similarity measure
called Overlapping. The formal definition may be
found in Section 4.

∗ This work has been supported by the grants EuroMa-
trixPlus (FP7-ICT-2007-3-231720 of the EU and 7E09003 of
the Czech Republic), P406/10/P259, P406/11/1499, and MSM
0021620838.

Instead of semantic role labels (not available for
Czech), Kos and Bojar (2009) use TectoMT frame-
work (Žabokrtský et al., 2008) to assign a seman-
tic part of speech defined by Sgall et al. (1986). In
addition they use t-lemmas (deep-syntactic lemmas)
instead of surface word forms, which most impor-
tantly means that the metric considers content words
only. In the following, we will use “sempos” to de-
note the semantic part of speech and “SemPOS” to
denote the whole metric by Kos and Bojar (2009).

SemPOS correlates well with human judgments
on system level, see Section 2 for a brief summary
of how the correlation is computed. The main draw-
back of SemPOS is its computational cost because
it requires full parsing up to the deep syntactic level
to obtain t-lemmas and semposes. In Section 3 we
propose four methods which approximate t-lemmas
and semposes without the deep syntactic analysis.
These methods require only part-of-speech tagging
and therefore they are not only faster but also eas-
ier to adapt for other languages, not requiring more
advanced linguistic tools.

Giménez and Márquez (2007) and Bojar et al.
(2010) used different formulas to calculate the final
overlapping.1 In Section 4, we examine variations
of the formula, adding one version of our own.

By combining one of the approximation tech-
niques with one of the overlapping formulas, we ob-

1In fact, Giménez and Márquez (2007) released two versions
of the paper. Both of them are nearly identical except for the
formula for overlapping, so we asked the authors which of the
two versions is correct. It turns out that Bojar et al. (2010),
unaware of the second version of the paper, used the wrong one
but still obtained good results. We therefore (re-)examine both
versions.

tain a variant of our metric. The performance of the
individual variants is reported in Section 5.

Section 6 is devoted to our submission to the Tun-
able Metrics shared task of the Sixth Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT11).

2 Method of Evaluation

Our primary objective is to create a good metric
for automatic MT evaluation and possibly also tun-
ing. We are not interested much in how close is our
proposed approximation to the (automatic or man-
ual) semposes and t-lemmas. Therefore, we evaluate
only how well do our metrics (the pair of a chosen
approximation and a chosen formula for the overlap-
ping) correlate with human judgments.

2.1 Test Data

We use the data collected during three Workshops on
Statistical Machine Translation: WMT08 (Callison-
Burch et al., 2008), WMT09 (Callison-Burch et al.,
2009) and WMT10 (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). So
far, we study only Czech and English as the target
languages. Our test sets are summarized in Table 1:
we have four sets with Czech as the target language
and 16 sets with English as the target language.

Each testset in each translation direction gives us
for each sentence one hypothesis for each participat-
ing MT system. Human judges (repeatedly) ranked
subsets of these hypotheses comparing at most 5 hy-
potheses at once and indicating some ordering of
the hypotheses. The ordering may include ties. In
WMT, these 5-fold rankings are interpreted as “sim-
ulated pairwise comparisons”: all pairwise compar-
isons are extracted from each ranking. The HUMAN
SCORE for each system is then the percentage of
pairs where the system was ranked better or equal
to its competitor.

2.2 Correlation with Human Judgments

For each metric we examine, the correlation to hu-
man judgments is calculated as follows: given one
of the test sets (the hypotheses and reference transla-
tions), the examined metric provides a single-figure
score for each system. We use Spearman’s rank cor-
relation coefficient between the human scores and
the scores of the given metric to see how well the
metric matches human judgments. Because tied
ranks do not exist, the correlation coefficient is given
by:

ρ = 1−
6

∑
i

(pi − qi)2

n(n2 − 1)
(1)

Human scores across different test sets are not
comparable, so we compute correlations for each
test set separately and average them.

3 Approximations of SemPOS

We would like to obtain t-lemmas and semantic parts
of speech without deep syntactic analysis, assuming
only automatic tagging and lemmatization.

Except for one option (Section 3.4), we approxi-
mate t-lemmas simply by surface lemmas. For the
majority of content words, this works perfectly, but
there are several regular classes of words where the
t-lemma differs. In such cases, the t-lemma usu-
ally consists of the lemma of the main content word
and an auxiliary word that significantly changes the
meaning of the content word. These are e.g. English
phrasal verbs (“blow up” should have the t-lemma
“blow up”) and Czech reflexive verbs (“smát se”).

The approximation of semantic part of speech de-
serves at least some minimal treatment. The follow-
ing sections describe four variations of the approxi-
mation.

Table 2: A sample of the mapping from English morpho-
logical tags to semposes, including the relative frequency,
e.g. count(NN,n.denot)count(NN) .

3.1 Sempos from Tag

We noticed that the morphological tag determines
almost uniquely the semantic part of speech. We use
the Czech-English sentence-parallel corpus CzEng
(Bojar and Žabokrtský, 2009) to create a simple dic-
tionary which maps morphological tags to most fre-
quent semantic parts of speech. Some morpholog-
ical tags belong almost always to auxiliary words
which do not have a corresponding deep-syntactic
node at all, so the t-lemma and sempos are not de-
fined for them. We include these morphological tags
in the dictionary and map them to a special sempos
value “-”. Ultimately, words with such sempos are
not included in the overlapping at all.

Table 2 shows a sample of this dictionary. The
high relative frequencies indicate that we are not los-
ing too much of the accuracy: overall 93.6 % for
English and 88.4 % for Czech on CzEng e-test.

The first approximation relies just on this
(language-specific) dictionary. The input text is au-
tomatically tagged, the morphological tags are de-
terministically mapped to semposes using the dictio-
nary and words where the mapping led to the special
value of “-” are removed.

In the following, we label this method as APPROX.

3.2 Exclude Stop-Words

By definition, the deep syntactic layer we use repre-
sents more or less only content words. Most aux-
iliary words become only attributes of the deep-

syntactic nodes and play no role in the overlapping
between the hypothesis and the reference.

Our first approximation technique (Section 3.1)
identifies auxiliary words only on the basis of the
morphological tag. We attempt to refine the re-
call by excluding a certain number of most frequent
words in each language. The frequency list was ob-
tained from the Czech and English sides of the cor-
pus CzEng. We choose the exact cut-off for stop-
words in each language separately: 100 words in
English and 220 words in Czech. See Section 5.1
below.

In the following, the method is called APPROX-
STOPWORDS.

3.3 Restricting the Set of Examined Semposes
We noticed that the contribution of each sempos to
the overall performance of the metric in terms of cor-
relation to human judgments can differ a lot. One
of the underlying reasons may be e.g. greater or
lower tagging accuracy of certain word classes, an-
other reason may be that translation errors in certain
word classes may be more relevant for human judges
of MT quality.

Tables 3 and 4 report the correlation to human
judgments if only words in a given sempos are con-
sidered in the overlapping. Based on these obser-
vations, we assume that some sempos types raise
the correlation of the overlapping with human judg-
ments and some lower it. We therefore try one more
variant of the approximation which considers only
(language-specific) subset of semposes.

The approximation called APPROX-RESTR con-
siders only these sempos tags in Czech: v, n.denot,
adj.denot, n.pron.def.pers, n.pron.def.demon, adv.-
denot.ngrad.nneg, adv.denot.grad.nneg. The consid-
ered sempos tags for English are: v, n.denot, adj.-
denot, n.pron.indef.

3.4 T-lemma and Sempos Tagging
Our last approximation method differs a lot from the
previous three approximations. We use the sequence
labeling algorithm (Collins, 2002) as implemented
in Featurama2 to choose the t-lemma and sempos
tag. The CzEng corpus (Bojar and Žabokrtský,
2009) serves to train two taggers: one for Czech and

one for English. At each token, each of the taggers
uses the word form, morphological tag and surface
lemma (of the current and the previous two tokens)
to choose one pair of t-lemma and sempos tag from
a given set.

The set of possible t-lemma and sempos pairs is
created as follows. At first the sempos set is ob-
tained. We simply use all semposes being seen with
the given morphological tag in the corpus. Then we
find possible t-lemmas for each sempos. For most
semposes we consider surface lemma as the only
t-lemma. For the sempos tag “v” we also add t-
lemmas composed of the surface lemma and some
auxiliary word present in the sentence (“blow up”,
“smát se”). For some other sempos tags we add spe-

cial t-lemmas for negation and personal pronouns
(“#Neg”, “#PersPron”).

The overall accuracy of the tagger on the e-test is
97.9 % for English and 94.9 % for Czech, a better re-
sult on a harder task (t-lemmas also predicted) than
the deterministic tagging in Section 3.1.

We call this approximation method TAGGER.

4 Variations of Overlapping

The original Overlapping defined by Giménez and
Márquez (2007) is given in Equations 2 and 3:

O(t) =

∑
w∈ri

cnt(w, t, ci)∑
w∈ri∪ci

max(cnt(w, t, ri), cnt(w, t, ci))

(2)
where ci and ri denotes the candidate and refer-
ence translation of sentence i and cnt(w, t, s) de-
notes number of times t-lemma w of type (sempos)
t appears in sentence s. For each sempos type t,
Overlapping O(t) calculates the proportion of cor-
rectly translated items of type t. In this paper we
will call this overlapping BOOST.

Equation 3 describes Overlapping of all types:

O(∗) =

∑
t∈T

∑
w∈ri

cnt(w, t, ci)∑
t∈T

∑
w∈ri∪ci

max(cnt(w, t, ri), cnt(w, t, ci))

(3)
where T denotes the set of all sempos types. We
will call this Overlapping BOOST-MICRO because it
micro-averages the overlappings of individual sem-
pos types.

Kos and Bojar (2009) used a slightly different
Overlapping formula, denoted CAP in this paper:

O(t) =

∑
w∈ri

min(cnt(w, t, ri), cnt(w, t, ci))∑
w∈ri

cnt(w, t, ri)
(4)

To calculate Overlapping of all types, Kos and
Bojar (2009) used ordinary macro-averaging. We
call the method CAP-MACRO:

O(∗) = 1
|T |

∑
t∈T

O(t) (5)

The difference between micro- and macro-
average is that in macro-average all types have

the same weight regardless of count. For exam-
ple O(n.denot) and O(adv.denot.grad.nneg) would
have the same weight, however there are many
more items of type n.denot than items of type
adv.denot.grad.nneg (see Tables 3 and 4). We con-
sider this unnatural and we suggest a new Overlap-
ping formula CAP-MICRO:

O(∗) =

∑
t∈T

∑
w∈ri

min(cnt(w, t, ri), cnt(w, t, ci))∑
t∈T

∑

cnt(w, t, ri)

In sum, we have three Overlappings which should

be evaluated: BOOST-MICRO (Equation 3), CAP-
MACRO (Equation 5), and CAP-MICRO (Equation 6).

To compare metrics to original SemPOS, the ta-

the t-lemmas and semposes are assigned by the Tec-

PROX+CAP-MICRO and BLEU (even weights) under
the name SEMPOS-BLEU since this metric was used
in Tunable Metric Task (Section 6).

The best performing metric is the combination
of approximation APPROX and overlapping CAP-
MICRO. It actually slightly outperforms all non-
approximated metrics. In general, the reductions
APPROX and ORIG combined with CAP-MICRO
or CAP-MACRO perform very well. Reductions
APPROX-STOPWORDS and APPROX-RESTR do not
improve on APPROX.

The TAGGER approximation correlates similarly
to ORIG when micro-average is used.

Table 6 contains the results for Czech as the target
language. The best performing metric for Czech is
APPROX-RESTR together with CAP-MACRO. In gen-
eral approximation APPROX-RESTR is better than
APPROX-STOPWORDS which is slightly better than
APPROX.

The success of overlapping CAP-MACRO in Czech
is due to the higher contribution of less frequent
semposes to the overall correlation. While in En-
glish the best correlating semposes are also very fre-
quent (Table 3), this does not hold for Czech (Ta-
ble 4). The underlying reasons have yet to be ex-
plained.

In both languages, the overlapping BOOST-
MICRO has a very low correlation. We therefore
consider this overlapping not suitable for any met-

On the other hand, most of the examined com-

binations are on average better than the baseline
BLEU, sometimes by a very wide margin.

5.1 Dependency of Correlation on Stopwords
List Length

We tried various stopwords list lengths for the
approximation APPROX-STOPWORDS. Figure 5.1
shows the dependency of the correlation on stop-
words list length for all overlappings in English. We
see that the best correlation arises when no words
are thrown away. One possible explanation is that
auxiliary words are recognized by the morphologi-
cal tag well enough anyway and stopwords lists re-
move also important content words, decreasing the
overall accuracy of the overlapping.

6 Tunable Metric WMT11 Shared Task

The goal of the tunable metric task in WMT11 was
to use the custom metric in MERT optimization
(Och, 2003). The target language was English. We
choose APPROX + CAP-MICRO since this combina-
tion correlates best with human judgments.

Based on the experience of Bojar and Kos (2010),
we combine this metric with BLEU. In our opin-
ion, the SemPOS metric and its variants alone are
are good at comparing systems’ outputs where sen-
tence fluency has been already ensured. On the other
hand, they fail in ranking sentences in n-best lists

in MERT optimization because they observe only
t-lemmas and don’t penalize wrong morphological
forms of words. We thus use BLEU to establish
sentence fluency and our metrics to prefer sentences
with correctly translated content words.

We have tried several weights for the linear com-
bination of BLEU and the chosen approximation.
See Table 7 for details. We have submitted the vari-
ant with equal weights.

The preliminary results of manual evaluation (see
the WMT11 overview paper) indicate that our sys-
tem is fairly distinct from others: we won under the
“> others” metric but we were the fifth of 8 systems
in the official “≥ others” (the percentage of pairs
where the system was ranked better or equal to its
competitor).

7 Conclusions

We have introduced and evaluated several approx-
imations of a deep-syntactic MT evaluation metric
SEMPOS. This allows us to reduce the computa-
tional load by far, use only shallow tagging and still
reach reasonable correlation scores.

For English, our combination of APPROX and
CAP-MICRO performs even marginally better than
the original SEMPOS. For Czech, it is APPROX-
RESTR and TAGGER approximations with CAP-
MACRO that outperform the original SEMPOS.

The applicability of these metrics (in link with
BLEU) in model optimization was confirmed by
the manual judgments for the Tunable Metrics Task.
Our submission was surprisingly different from oth-
ers: the best one in the score excluding ties and
mediocre in the score where ties are rewarded.
