Abstract 

This paper reports about the develop-

ment of clause identification and classi-

fication techniques for Bengali language. 

A syntactic rule based model has been 

used to identify the clause boundary. For 

clause type identification a Conditional 

random Field (CRF) based statistical 

model has been used. The clause identi-

fication system and clause classification 

system demonstrated 73% and 78% pre-

cision values respectively.  

1 Introduction 

The clause identification is one of the shallow 

semantic parsing tasks, which is important in 

various NLP applications such as Machine 

Translation, parallel corpora alignment, Informa-

tion Extraction and speech applications. Gram-

matically a clause is a group of words having a 

subject and a predicate of its own, but forming 

part of a sentence. Clause boundary identifica-

tion of natural language sentences poses consi-

derable difficulties due to the ambiguous nature 

of natural languages. Clause classification is a 

convoluted task as natural language is generally 

syntactically rich in formation of sentences or 

clauses. 

By the classical theory of Panini (Paul and 

Staal, 1969) a clause is the surface level basic 

syntactic element which holds the basic depen-

dent semantics (i.e. lexical semantic have no 

dependency) to represent the overall meaning of 

any sentence. This syntactic to semantic deriva-

tion proceeds through two intermediate stages: 

the level of karaka relations, which are compa-

rable to the thematic role types and the level of 

inflectional or derivational morphosyntax. 

Fillmore’s Case Grammar (Fillmore et. al, 

2003), and much subsequent work, revived the 

Panini’s proposals in a modern setting. A main 

objective of Case Grammar was to identify syn-

tactic positions of semantic arguments that may 

have different realizations in syntax.  

In the year of 1996 Bharati et al. (1996) de-

fines the idea of Chunk or local word group for 

Indian languages. After the successful imple-

mentation of Shakti
1
 , the first publicly available 

English-Hindi machine translation system the 

idea of chunk became the most acceptable syn-

tactic/semantic representation format for Indian 

languages, known as Shakti Standard Format 

(SSF).   

In 2009 Bali et al. (2009) redefines the idea of 

chunk and establishes that the idea of chunking 

varies with prosodic structure of a language. 

Boundary of chunk level is very ambiguous it-

self and can differ by writer or speaker accord-

ing to their thrust on semantic. 

Therefore it is evident that automatic clause 

identification for Indian languages needs more 

research efforts. In the present task, clause 

boundary identification is attempted using the 

classical theory of Panini and the Case Grammar 

approach of Fillmore on the shallow parsed out-

put in SSF structure. It may be worth mentioning 

that several basic linguistic tools in Indian lan-

guages such as part of speech tagger, chunker, 

and shallow parser follow SSF
2
  as a standard.  

Previous research on clause identification was 

done mostly on the English language (Sang and 

Dejean, 2001). There have been limited efforts 

on clause identification for Indian languages. 

One such effort is proposed in Ram and Devi,

(2008) with statistical method. The idea of ge-

nerative grammar based on rule-based descrip-

tions of syntactic structures introduced by 

Chomsky (Chomsky, 1956) points out that every 

language has its own peculiarities that cannot be 

described by standard grammar. Therefore a new 

concept of generative grammar has been pro-

posed by Chomsky. Generative grammar can be 

identified by statistical methods. In the present 

task, conditional random field (CRF)
3

 -based 

machine learning method has been used in 

clause type classification. According to the best 

of our knowledge this is the first effort to identi-

fy and classify clauses in Bengali. 

The present system is divided into two parts. 

First, the clause identification task aims to iden-

tify the start and the end boundaries of the claus-

es in a sentence. Second, Clause classification 

system identifies the clause types. 

Analysis of corpus and standard grammar of 

Bengali revealed that clause boundary identifica-

tion depends mostly on syntactic dependency. 

For this reason, the present clause boundary 

identification system is rule based in nature. 

Classification of clause is a semantic task and 

depends on semantic properties of Bengali lan-

guage. Hence we follow the theory of 

Chomsky’s generative grammar to disambiguate 

among possible clause types. The present classi-

fication system of clause is a statistics-based 

approach. A conditional random field (CRF) 

based machine learning method has been used in 

the clause classification task. The output of the 

rule based identification system is forwarded to 

the machine learning model as input. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 

In section 2 we elaborate the rule based clause 

boundary identification. The next section 3 de-

scribes the implementation detail with all identi-

fied features for the clause classification prob-

lem. Result section 4 reports about the accuracy 

of the hybrid system. In error analysis section 

we reported the limitations of the present sys-

tem. The conclusion is drawn in section 5 along 

with the future task direction. 

2 Resource Acquisition 

Bengali belongs to Indo-Aryan language family. 

A characteristic of Bengali is that it is under-

resourced. Language research for Bengali got 

attention recently. Resources like annotated cor-

pus and linguistics tools for Bengali are very 

rarely available in the public domain. 

2.1 Corpus 

We used the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 

2009

 dependency relation marked training data-

set of 980 sentences for training of the present 

system. The data has been further annotated at 

the clause level. According to the standard 

grammar there are two basic clause types such as 

Principal clause and Subordinate clause. Subor-

dinate clauses have three variations as Noun 

clause, Adjective clause and Adverbial clause. 

The tagset defined for the present task consists 

of four tags as Principal clause (PC), Noun 

clause (NC), Adjective clause (AC) and Adver-

bial clause (RC). The annotation tool used for 

the present task is Sanchay
5
. The detailed statis-

tics of the corpus are reported in Table 1.

2.1.1 Annotation Agreement 

Two annotators (Mr. X and Mr. Y) participated 

in the present task. Annotators were asked to 

identify the clause boundaries as well as the type 

of the identified clause. The agreement of anno-

tations among two annotators has been eva-

luated. The agreements of tag values at clause 

boundary level and clause type levels are listed 

in Table 2.

Table 2: Agreement of annotators at clause 

boundary and type level 

It is observed from the Table 2 that clause 

boundary identification task has lower agree-

ment value. A further analysis reveals that there 

are almost 9% of cases where clause boundary 

has nested syntactic structure. These types of 

clause boundaries are difficult to identify. One 

of such cases is Inquisitive semantic (Groenen-

dijk, 2009) cases, ambiguous for human annota-

tors too. It is better to illustrate with some spe-

cific example. 
If John goes to the party, 

will Mary go as well? 

In an inquisitive semantics for a language of 

propositional logic the interpretation of disjunc-

tion is the source of inquisitiveness. Indicative 

conditionals and conditional questions are 

treated both syntactically and semantically. The 

semantics comes with a new logical-

pragmatically notion that judges and compares 

the compliance of responses to an initiative in 

inquisitive dialogue (Groenendijk, 2009). Hence 

it is evident that these types of special cases 

need special research attention. 

2.2 Shallow Parser 

Shallow parser
6
 for Indian languages, developed 

under a Government of India funded consortium 

project named Indian Language to Indian Lan-

guage Machine Translation System (IL-ILMT), 

are now publicly available. It is a well developed 

linguistic tool and produce good credible analy-

sis. For the present task the linguistic analysis is 

done by the tool and it gives output as pruned 

morphological analysis at each word level, part 

of speech at each word level, chunk boundary 

with type-casted chunk label, vibhakti computa-

tion and chunk head identification. 

2.3 Dependency parser 

A dependency parser for Bengali has been used 

as described in Ghosh et al. (2009). The depen-

dency parser follows the tagset
7
 identified for 

Indian languages as a part of NLP TOOLS 

CONTEST 2009 as a part of ICON 2009. 

3 Rule-based Clause Boundary Identi-
fication 

Analysis of a Bengali corpus and standard 

grammar reveals that clause boundaries are di-

rectly related to syntactic relations at sentence 

level. The present system first identifies the 

number of verbs present in a sentence and sub-

sequently finds out dependant chunks to each 

verb. The set of identified chunks that have rela-

tion with a particular verb is considered as a 

clause. But some clauses have nested syntactic 

                                                 
6
 http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/analyzer/bengali/ 

7
 http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlptools2009/CR/intro-husain.pdf 

formation, known as inquisitive semantic. These 

clauses are difficult to identify by using only 

syntactic relations. The present system has limi-

tations on those inquisitive types of clauses. 

Bengali is a verb final language. Most of the 

Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb 

(SOV) pattern. In Bengali, subject can be miss-

ing in a clause formation. Missing subjects and 

missing keywords lead to ambiguities in clause 

boundary identification. In sentences which do 

not follow the SOV pattern, chunks that appear 

after the finite verb are not considered with that 

clause. For example:  

 
wAra AyZawana o parimANa 

xeKe buJawe asubiXA hayZa ei  

paWa hAwi geCe. 

 

After seeing the size and 

effect, it is hard to under-

stand that an elephant went 

through this way. 

 

In the above example, there is hardly any clue 

to find beginning of subordinate clause. To solve 

this type of problem, capturing only the tree 

structure of a particular sentence has been 

treated as the key factor to the goal of disambig-

uation. One way to capture the regularity of 

chunks over different sentences is to learn a ge-

nerative grammar that explains the structure of 

the chunks one finds. These types of language 

properties make the clause identification prob-

lem difficult.  

3.1 Karaka relation 

Dependency parsing generates the inter chunk 

relation and generates the tree structure. The de-

pendency parser as described in Section 2.3 used 

as a supportive tool for the present problem.   

In the output of the dependency parsing sys-

tems, most of the chunks have a dependency 

relation with the verb chunk. These relations are 

called as karaka relation. Using dependency re-

lations, the chunks having dependency relation 

i.e. karaka relation with same verb chunk are 

grouped. The set of chunks are the members of a 

clause. Using this technique, identification of 

chunk members of a certain clause becomes in-

dependent of SOV patterns of sentences. An ex-

ample is shown in Figure 1. 

19



 
Figure 1: Karaka Relations 

3.2 Compound verbs  

In Bengali language a noun chunk with an infi-

nite verb chunk or a finite verb chunk can form a 

compound verb. An example is shown in Figure 

2. 

 
Figure 2: Compound Verb 

In the above example, the noun chunk and the 

VGF chunk form a compound verb. These two 

consecutive noun and verb chunks appearing in 

a sentence are merged to form a compound verb. 

These chunks are connected with a part-of rela-

tion in Dependency Parsing. The set of related 

chunks with these noun and verb chunks are 

merged.  

3.3 Shasthi Relation (r6) 

In dependency parsing the genitive relation are 

marked with shasthi (r6) relation. The chunk 

with shasthi (r6) (see the tagset of NLP Tool 

Contest: ICON 2009) relation always has a rela-

tion with the succeeding chunk. An example is 

shown in Figure 3. 

In the example as mentioned in Figure 3, the 

word “wadera”(their) has a genitive relation 

with the word in the next chunk “manera”(of 

mind). These chunks are placed in a set. It forms 

a set of two chunks members. The system gene-

rates two different types of set. In one forms a 

set of members having relation with verb 

chunks. Another set contains two noun chunks 

with genitive relation. Now the sets containing 

only noun chunks with genitive relation does not 

form a clause. Those sets are merged with the set 

containing verb chunk and having dependency 

relation with the noun chunks. An example is 

shown in Figure 3. 

 
Figure 3: Shasthi Relation 

 

Consider ω is set of all sets containing two 

chunk members connected with genitive marker. 

Consider β is a set of all sets consisting of re-

lated chunks with a verb chunk. λ is a element of 

ω. α is a element of β. Now, If a set λ which can 

have common chunks from a α set then λ set is 

associated with the proper α set. So, λ ∩ α ≠ 

Null then α = α ∪ λ. If a set λ which can have 

common chunks from two α sets which leads to 

ambiguity of associability of the λ set with the 

proper α set. If λ ∩ α = verb chunk, then λ set 

will be associated with α set containing the verb 

chunk. From the related set of chunk of verb 

chunks, system has identified the clauses in the 

sentence. Afterwards, the clauses are marked 

with the B-I-E (Beginning-Intermediate-End) 

notation.

rian Panini sometime during 600 or 300 B.C. 

(Robins, 1979), includes a sophisticated theory 

of thematic structure that remains influential till 

today. Panini’s Sanskrit grammar is a system of 

rules for converting semantic representations of 

sentences into phonetic representations (Ki-

parsky, 1969). This derivation proceeds through 

two intermediate stages: the level of karaka rela-

tions, which are comparable to the thematic role 

types described above; and the level of morpho-

syntax. 

Fillmore’s Case Grammar (Fillmore, 1968), 

and much subsequent work, revived the Panini’s 

proposals in a modern setting. A main objective 

of Case Grammar was to identify semantic ar-

gument positions that may have different realiza-

tions in syntax. Fillmore hypothesized ‘a set of 

universal, presumably innate, concepts which 

identify certain types of judgments human be-

ings are capable of making about the events that 

are going on around them’. He posited the fol-

lowing preliminary list of cases, noting however 

that ‘additional cases will surely be needed’.  

• Agent: The typically animate perceived 
instigator of the action. 

• Instrument: Inanimate force or object 
causally involved in the action or state. 

• Dative: The animate being affected by 
the state or action. 

• Factitive: The object or being resulting 
from the action or state. 

• Locative: The location or time-spatial 
orientation of the state or action. 

• Objective: The semantically most neu-
tral case, the concept should be limited to 

things which are affected by the action or 

state. 

The SSF specification handles this syntactic 

dependency by a coarse-grain tagset of Nomini-

tive, Accusative, Genitive and Locative case 

markers. Bengali shallow parser identifies the 

chunk heads as part of the chunk level analysis. 

Dependency parsing followed by a rule based 

module has been developed to analyze the inter-

chunk relationships depending upon each verb 

present in a sentence. Described theoretical as-

pect can well define the problem definition of 

clause boundary identification but during prac-

tical implementation of the solution we found 

some difficulties. Bengali has explicit case 

markers and thus long distant chunk relations are 

possible as valid grammatical formation. As an 

example: 
bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa xeKA 

kare gela rAma. 

 

bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa rAma 

xeKA kare gela. 

 

rAma bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa 

xeKA kare gela. 

 

Rama came to meet when he 

was going to market. 

 

In the above example rAma could be placed 

anywhere and still all the three syntactic forma-

tion are correct. For these feature of Bengali 

many dependency relation could be missed out 

located at far distance from the verb chunk in a 

sentence. Searching for uncountable numbers of 

chunks have dependency relation with a particu-

lar verb may have good idea theoretically but we 

prefer a checklist strategy to resolve the problem 

in practice. At this level we decided to check all 

semantic probable constituents by the definition 

of universal, presumably innate, concepts list. 

We found this is a nice fall back strategy to iden-

tify the clause boundary. Separately rules are 

written as described below. 

4.1 Agent 

Bengali is a verb final language. Most of the 

Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb 

(SOV) pattern. In Bengali, subject can be miss-

ing in a clause formation. Missing subjects and 

missing keywords lead to ambiguities in clause 

boundary identification. 

 

������ �� �	��। 
Close the door. 

 

In the previous case system marks 

“������/door” as an “Agent” whereas the 
“Agent” is “you” (2

nd
 person singular number), 

silent here.  

We developed rules using case marker, Gend-

er-Number-Person (GNP), morphological fea-

ture and modality features to disambiguate these 

21



types of phenomena. These rules help to stop 

false hits by identifying no 2
nd

 person phrase 

was there in the example type sentences and em-

power to identify proper phrases by locating 

proper verb modality matching with the right 

chunk.  

4.2 Instrument 

Instrument identification is ambiguous for the 

same type of case marker (nominative) taken by 

agent and instrument. There is no ani-

mate/inanimate information is available at syn-

tactic level. 


��	�� ���
� ��� �������। 
The music of Shyam’s messme-

rized me. 

����� ����। 
The umbrella of Sumi. 

 

Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-

Verb (SOV) pattern. Positional information is 

helpful to disambiguate between agent and in-

strument roles.

Table 3: Categories of Time Expressions 

 

Time expression identification has a different 

aspect in NLP applications. People generally 

studied time expression to track event or any 

other kind of IR task. Time expressions could be 

categorized in two types as General and Rela-

tive.  

In order to apply rule-based process we de-

veloped a manually augmented list with pre de-

fined categories as described in Table 3. Still 

there are many difficulties to identify special 

cases of relative time expressions. As an exam-

ple: 

+�� (ঠ	� &��� �,�� -	��। 
When moon rise we will start 

our journey. 

In the previous example the relative time ex-

pression is “(ঠ	�/when rise” is tagged as infinite 
verb (for Bengali tag level is VGNF). Statistics 

reveals that these special types of cases approx-

imately are only 1.8-2% in overall corpus. 

These types of special cases are not handled 

by the present system. 

4.4 Factitive 

The particular role assignment is the most chal-

lenging task as it separately known as argument 

identification. To resolve this problem we need a 

relatively large corpus to learn fruitful feature 

similarities among argument structures. 

A manually generated list of causative post-

positional words and pair wise conjuncts as re-

ported in Table 4 has been prepared to identify 

argument phrases in sentences.

Table 4: Categories of Causative Expressions 

4.5 Locative 

Rules have been written using a manually edited 

list as described in Table 5. Morphological loca-

tive case marker feature have been successfully 

used in identification of locative marker. There 

is an ambiguity among Agent, Dative and Loca-

tive case marker as they orthographically gene-

rates same type of surface form (using common 

22



suffixes as: �◌, �◌� etc). There is less differences 
we noticed among their syntactic dependency 

structure throughout the corpus. Positional in-

formation helps in many cases to disambiguate 

these cases. 

��

country side. 

A different type of problem we found where 

verb plays locative role. As an example: 

���	� �য��	� ��� �	� ����	�। 
Where people works there. 

Here “�য��	� ��� �	�/Where people works” 
should be identified as locative marker. But this 

is a verb chunk and leads difficulty. Corpus sta-

tistics reveals that this type of syntactic forma-

tion is approximately 0.8-1.0% only and not 

been handled by the present system.

4.6 Objective 

The concept of objectivity is limited to things or 

human which are affected by the action or state. 

Statistical parser is a best way out for the present 

problem. The karma karaka (k2) identified by 

the dependency parser is simply the objective 

constituent of any clause. 

5 Identification the Type of Clauses  

After marking of the clause boundaries, clause 

types are identified. According to the clause 

structure and functions in a sentence, clauses are 

classified in to four types as principal clause, 

noun clause, adverbial clause and adjective 

clause. To identify the clause types, a CRF based 

statistical approach has been adopted.  

5.1 Generative Grammar 

In theoretical linguistics, generative grammar 

refers to a particular approach to the study of 

syntax. A generative grammar of a language at-

tempts to give a set of rules that will correctly 

predict which combinations of words will form 

grammatical sentences. Chomsky has argued 

that many of the properties of a generative 

grammar arise from an "innate" universal gram-

mar. Proponents of generative grammar have 

argued that most grammar is not the result of 

communicative function and is not simply 

learned from the environment. Strongly moti-

vated by Chomsky’s generative grammar we 

adopt the CRF based machine learning to learn 

the properties of a language and apply the know-

ledge to typecast clause classification as well.  

5.2 Conditional Random Fields (CRF)  

CRFs are undirected graphical models which 

define a conditional distribution over a label se-

quence given an observation sequence. CRF 

usually trained based on input features. Maxi-

mum likelihood is being calculated on chosen 

features for training.  

5.2.1 Features  

The vitality of using any machine learning ap-

proach is in identification of proper feature set. 

Conditional Random Field (CRF) works on a 

conditional distribution over a label sequence 

given an observation sequence. Hence CRF used 

here to statistically capture the prosodic structure 

of the language. The features experimentally 

found useful are chosen as listed below.  

5.2.2 Chunk Label 

An n-gram chunk label window has been fixed 

to capture internal arrangement of any particular 

clause type.  

5.2.3 Chunk Heads 

Chunk head pattern is the vital clue to identify 

the any clause pattern.  

5.2.4 Word 

In the clause type identification task words play 

a crucial part as word carries the information of 

the clause type.  

  From the input file in the SSF format, all the 

morphological information like root word, chunk 

heads are retrieved. The clause type identifica-

tion depends on the morphological information 

along with the position in the sentences and also 

the surrounding chunk labels. Therefore the CRF 

based statistical tool calculates the probability of 

23



the morphological information along with the 

dependency relations of the previous three and 

next three chunks. For the present task a quad-

gram technique is used as most of the sentences 

have around 10 chunks.  

The input file in the SSF format includes 

Chunk labels and word. The clause information 

in the input files are in B-I-E format so that the 

begin (B) / inside (I) / end (E) information for a 

clause are associated as a feature. The chunk 

heads, words are identified from the training file 

and noted as an input feature in the CRF based 

system. Each sentence is represented as a feature 

vector for the CRF machine learning task. The 

input features associated with each word in the 

training set are the word, clause boundary tags, 

chunk tag and clause type tags.  

6 Error Analysis  

During the development stage of the system we 

had studied the various clause boundary labeling 

errors committed by the system.  In the above 

examples, the system faces ambiguity to derive 

the rules for the identification of the clause 

members when a noun chunk acts as a noun 

modifier of a clause.  In complex sentences, the 

verb chunk of the subordinate clause may have 

noun modifier relation with the principal clause. 

As System forms the groups the chunks with 

dependency relation, system merges the subor-

dinate clause with principal clause. An example 

is shown in Figure 4.

reported in Table 6. 

8 Conclusion 

This paper reports about our works on clause 

identification and classification in Bengali lan-

guage. We have used the rule based system to 

identify clause boundary and a statistical CRF

and boundary.
