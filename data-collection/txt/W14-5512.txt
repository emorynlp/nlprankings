Abstract

Named entity recognition aims to classify words in a document into pre-defined target entity
classes. It is now considered to be fundamental for many natural language processing tasks such
as information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and question answering.
This paper presents a workflow to build an English-Vietnamese named entity corpus from an
aligned bilingual corpus. The workflow is based on a state of the art named entity recognition
tool to identify English named entities and map them into Vietnamese text. The paper also
presents a detailed discussion about several mapping errors and differences between English and
Vietnamese sentences that affect this task.

1 Introduction

Named entity recognition (NER) is a basic task in natural language processing and one of the most
important subtasks in Information Extraction. It is really essential to identify objects and extract relations
between them. Moreover, recognizing proper names from news articles or newswires is also useful in
detecting events and monitoring them. The NER task aims to identify and classify certain proper nouns
into some pre-defined target entity classes such as person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC),
temporal expressions (TIME), monetary values (MON), and percentage (PCT).

Several previous works in NER have been done on languages such as English (J. Sun et al., 2002;
C.W. Shih et al., 2004), Japanese (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008), Chinese (J. Sun et al., 2002;
C.W. Shih et al., 2004), and Vietnamese (N.C. Tu et al., 2005; T.X. T. Pham et al., 2007; Q.T. Tran et
al., 2007); and NER systems have been developed using supervised learning methods such as Decision
Tree, Maximum Entropy model (D. Nadeau and S. Sekine, 2007), and Support Vector Machine (Q.T.
Tran et al., 2007), which achieved high performance. Moreover, there are several studies for bilingual
named entity recognition (C.J. Lee et al., 2006; D. Feng et al., 2004; F. Huang and S. Vogel, 2002).
However, for the English-Vietnamese pair, this task still presents a significant challenge in a number of
important respects (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008). Firstly, words in Vietnamese are not always
separated by spaces, so word segmentation is necessary and segmentation errors will affect the level
of NER performance. Secondly, some proper names of foreign persons and locations are loanwords or
represented by phonetic symbols, so we can expect wide variations in some Vietnamese terms. Thirdly,
there are considerably fewer available existing resources such as lexicons, parsers, word nets, etc. for
Vietnamese that have been used in previous studies.

In this study, we suggest a process to build a bilingual named entity corpus from aligned news express
articles. In fact, this process is applied to build an English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus by using
available English named entity recognition to tag entities in the English text, and then map them into
Vietnamese text based on word alignments. The mapping results are also corrected manually by using a
visualization tool.

The remainder of this paper describes the details of our work. Firstly we address the data source for
building the corpus in Section 2. Next, we present a procedure to build an English-Vietnamese Named
Entity Corpus by using a bilingual corpus and mapping English entities into Vietnamese entity tags in
Section 3. Experimental results and conclusion appear in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

2 Tagset and Data Source

2.1 Tagset for Named Entities

There are many tagsets for the NER task, such as the hierarchical named entity tagset with 150 types (S.
Sekine et al., 2002), the biological named entity tagset (Y. Tateisi et al., 2000; J-D Kim et al., 2003), or
common named entity tagsets with 3 types and 7 tags (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998). According
to the definition of the MUC-7 conference (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998), we will identify six
types of named entities:

• PERSON (PER): Person entities are limited to humans identified by name, nickname or alias.

• ORGANIZATION (ORG): Organization entities are limited to corporations, institutions, govern-
ment agencies and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure.

• LOCATION (LOC): Location entities include names of politically or geographically defined
places (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.). Lo-
cations also include man-made structures like airports, highways, streets, factories and monuments.

• TIME (TIM): Date/Time entities are complete or partial expressions of time of day, or date expres-
sions.

• PERCENTAGE (PCT): Percentage entities are percentage expressions, including percentage range
expressions.

• MONEY (MON): Money entities include monetary expressions.

We have developed a guide for bilingual named entity tagging and published it as EnVnNEguide at
http://code.google.com/p/evbcorpus/downloads/list.

2.2 Data Source

The data source for building the English-Vietnamese named entity corpus is a part of the EVBCorpus1,
which consists of both original English text and its Vietnamese translations. It contains 1,000 news
articles defined as the EVBNews part of the EVBCorpus (as shown in Table 1) (Q.H. Ngo et al., 2013).
This corpus is also aligned semi-automatically at the word level.

In particular, each article was translated one to one at the whole article level, so we align sentence to
sentence. Then, sentences are aligned semi-automatically at the word level, including automatic align-
ment by class-based method (D. Dien et al., 2002) and use of the BiCAT tool (Q.H. Ngo and W. Wini-
warter, 2012) to correct the alignments manually. The details of the corpus are listed in Table 1.

Parallel documents are also chosen and classified into categories, such as economy, entertainment
(art and music), health, science, social, politics, and technology (percentage of each category is shown
in Table 2 and Figure 1). The wide range of categories ensures that named entities in the corpus are
diversified enough for other following tasks.

3 Building Named Entity Corpus

3.1 Model of Building EVNECorpus from EVBCorpus

Figure 2 shows the main modules of bilingual named entity corpus building, including three main mod-
ules: pre-processing, named entity recognition, bilingual entity mapping, and bilingual entity correction.
According to this workflow, the bilingual corpus will be tagged with named entities on the English text,
then, named entities are mapped from English to Vietnamese text. Finally, annotators will correct both
English and Vietnamese named entities by using the BiCAT tool (Q.H. Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012).

At the first stage, a Named Entity Recognition system is used to tag English entities in the English
sentence. Several Named Entity Recognition systems for English text are available online. For traditional
NER, the most popular publicly available systems are: OpenNLP NameFinder 2 , Illinois NER3 system
by Lev Ratinov (L. Ratinov and D. Roth, 2009), Stanford NER4 system by Jenny Rose Finkel (J.R.
Finkel et al., 3005), and Lingpipe NER5 system by Baldwin, B. and B. Carpenter (B. Carpenter, 2006).
The Stanford NER reports 86.86 F1 on the CoNLL03 NER shared task data. We chose the Stanford NER
to provide for the ability of our corpus for tagging with multi-type, such as 3 classes, 4 classes, and 7
classes.

The following example is the result of the Stanford NER for the English sentence “Prime Minister
Gordon Brown resigned as Britain ’s top politician on Tuesday evening, making way for Conservative

and its mapped named entities in the Vietnamese sentence:

Thủ tướng [Gordon Brown]PER đã từ giã chức vụ cao nhất trên chính trường [Anh]LOC vào tối
[thứ ba]TIM , nhường chỗ cho [David Cameron]PER nhà lãnh đạo [Đảng Bảo thủ]ORG .

3.2 Mapping English to Vietnamese Named Entities
At the next stage, every alignment will be mapped from English into Vietnamese tokens. Every named
entity tag on linked English words is mapped to Vietnamese tokens on the target sentence. Left and right
boundaries are also detected to re-build named entity chunks on the Vietnamese sentence (as shown in
Figure 3):

• Remove all alignments which are not related to English named entity tokens
• Map English named entity tokens to Vietnamese text by using alignments

88



• Identify the boundaries of named entities and rebuild named entity script text.

Figure 3: Mapping named entities

However, there is a difference between the number of tagged English named entities and mapped
Vietnamese named entities (as shown in Table 3). Several English entities in the English sentences are
not translated into the Vietnamese text, therefore, these entities are not mapped.

Table 3: Number of entities at the first stage
Tag Name Tagged English Entity Mapped Vietnamese Entity Unmapped Entity
LOC Location 10,418 10,354 64
ORG Organization 8,197 8,120 77
PER Person 7,217 7,153 64
TIM Time 4,474 4,437 37
MON Money 1,003 992 11
PCT Percent 1,201 1,193 8

Total 32,510 32,249 261

There are several common errors of the mapping stage. The most frequent error is caused by the
separation of entities from English text in Vietnamese. It means that there are several cases of one tagged
English named entity being separated into two distinct Vietnamese named entities in the Vietnamese
text. On the other hand, for example, the phrase “President [Bill Clinton]PER between [1994]TIM and
[1997]TIM” has one PER entity and two TIM entities whereas the Vietnamese translated text “Tổng
thống [Bill Clinton]PER trong giai đoạn [1994-1997]TIM” has one PER entity and only one TIM entity.

Three common reasons which lead to mapping errors (these cases are discussed in the next section by
analysing unmatched cases) are:

• The differences between English and Vietnamese characteristics.

• The splitting of an English named entity to two Vietnamese entities.

• The entities are replaced by pronouns and possessive pronouns in the target sentences or the other
way around.

89



3.3 Correcting Named Entities

As shown in Figure 4, we use the BiCAT tool (Q.H. Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012) for correcting named
entities in both English and Vietnamese sentences. The BiCAT tool is a visualization tool based on drag,
drop, and edit label operations (actions) to correct the sentence pairs. It is designed for annotators to
review whole phrase structures of English and Vietnamese sentences. They can compare the English
named entity result with the Vietnamese named entity result and correct them in both sentences. The
comparison is also used to detect incorrect named entities in both English and Vietnamese text.

Figure 4: Screenshot of BiCAT with the named entity map

Moreover, several additional information, such as POS tagger, chunker, is also shown for building
further linguistic tags. Several features are implemented on the entity matrix at the right panel of the
BiCAT tool:

• Show the sentence where named entities occur.

• Highlight the pairs which have imbalance in number of entities between source sentence and target
sentence.

• Quick jump to the sentence pair on which the user clicks.

4 Experiment and Results

Named entities include six tags: Location (LOC), Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Time including
date tags (TIM), Money (MON), and Percentage (PCT). English text is tagged with English NER tags by
Stanford NER and then mapped to Vietnamese text. Next, Vietnamese entity tags are corrected manually.

In total, the English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus (EVNECorpus) has 32,454 English named
entities and 33,338 Vietnamese named entities in the EVBNews corpus (see Table 4 for details and its
comparison in Figure 5).

Table 4: Number of entities in the EVNECorpus

LOC Location 10,406 11,343 998
ORG Organization 8,177 8,218 189
PER Person 7,201 7,205 199
TIM Time 4,408 4,417 136
MON Money 1,003 993 32
PCT Percent 1,194 1,170 27

Total 32,454 33,338 1,581

There are several common unmatched named entities in English-Vietnamese named entity corpus: the
English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus (EVNECorpus) has 32,454 English named entities and 33,338
Vietnamese named entities in the EVBNews corpus (see Table 5). Moreover, to classify the unmatched
named entities, we also tag part-of-speech for English sentences by the POS Tagger6 of the Stanford
Natural Language Processing Group (K. Toutanova and C. D. Manning, 2000).

As shown in Table 5, a large number of English adjectives (tagged JJ tag) are not tagged as named en-
tities while their translations are tagged as locations. Most of them are coming from country names, such
as French, English, and Vietnamese, and they refer to people or languages. In the English text ”Cuban
missile crisis”, the word Cuban is not tagged as a location because Cuban is an adjective (”Cuban/JJ
missile/NN crisis/NN”), while, in its Vietnamese translation, ”Khủng khoảng tên lửa [Cu Ba]LOC”, ”Cu
Ba” is tagged as a location. Moreover, there are several English named entities that are split into two
entities in the Vietnamese sentences. For example, ”[Thailand]LOC ’s [Ministry of Public Health]ORG”
has two entities while its translation is [Bộ Y tế Thái Lan]ORG. Finally, there are several named entities
that are replaced by pronouns and possessive pronouns (30 cases for PRP and 11 cases for PRP$) in the
translated sentences and the inverse direction (38 cases).

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown a workflow of building an English-Vietnamese named entity corpus. This
workflow is based on an aligned bilingual corpus. In addition, we built a Vietnamese word segmen-
tation corpus for training and evaluating the system. As result, the corpus is built semi-automatically
with over 45,000 sentences, and totally 32,454 English named entities and 33,338 Vietnamese named
entities. Moreover, we also pointed out several differences in named entity tagging between English and
Vietnamese text. These differences can be used to map named entity tags, linguistic information, and in
machine translation systems.

However, adding to the six common named entity types additional names (such as product, disease,
and event names) is also necessary, and we need further research for identifying them in bilingual corpora
because they affect the named entity recognition process as well as the corpus.
