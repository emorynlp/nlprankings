Abstract

We explore the selection of training data
for language models using perplexity. We
introduce three novel models that make
use of linguistic information and evaluate
them on three different corpora and two
languages. In four out of the six scenar-
ios a linguistically motivated method out-
performs the purely statistical state-of-the-
art approach. Finally, a method which
combines surface forms and the linguisti-
cally motivated methods outperforms the
baseline in all the scenarios, selecting data
whose perplexity is between 3.49% and
8.17% (depending on the corpus and lan-
guage) lower than that of the baseline.

1 Introduction

Language models (LMs) are a fundamental piece
in statistical applications that produce natural lan-
guage text, such as machine translation and speech
recognition. In order to perform optimally, a LM
should be trained on data from the same domain
as the data that it will be applied to. This poses a
problem, because in the majority of applications,
the amount of domain-specific data is limited.

A popular strand of research in recent years to
tackle this problem is that of training data selec-
tion. Given a limited domain-specific corpus and
a larger non-domain-specific corpus, the task con-
sists on finding suitable data for the specific do-
main in the non-domain-specific corpus. The un-
derlying assumption is that a non-domain-specific
corpus, if broad enough, contains sentences sim-
ilar to a domain-specific corpus, which therefore,
would be useful for training models for that do-
main.

This paper focuses on the approach that uses
perplexity for the selection of training data. The
first works in this regard (Gao et al., 2002; Lin

et al., 1997) use the perplexity according to a
domain-specific LM to rank the text segments (e.g.
sentences) of non-domain-specific corpora. The
text segments with perplexity less than a given
threshold are selected.

A more recent method, which can be consid-
ered the state-of-the-art, is Moore-Lewis (Moore
and Lewis, 2010). It considers not only the cross-
entropy1 according to the domain-specific LM but
also the cross-entropy according to a LM built
on a random subset (equal in size to the domain-
specific corpus) of the non-domain-specific cor-
pus. The additional use of a LM from the non-
domain-specific corpus allows to select a subset
of the non-domain-specific corpus which is bet-
ter (the perplexity of a test set of the specific do-
main has lower perplexity on a LM trained on
this subset) and smaller compared to the previ-
ous approaches. The experiment was carried out
for English, using Europarl (Koehn, 2005) as the
domain-specific corpus and LDC Gigaword2 as
the non-domain-specific one.

In this paper we study whether the use of two
types of linguistic knowledge (lemmas and named
entities) can contribute to obtain better results
within the perplexity-based approach.

2 Methodology

We explore the use of linguistic information for
the selection of data to train domain-specific LMs
from non-domain-specific corpora. Our hypothe-
sis is that ranking by perplexity on n-grams that
represent linguistic patterns (rather than n-grams
that represent surface forms) captures additional
information, and thus may select valuable data that
is not selected according solely to surface forms.

We use two types of linguistic information at

1note that using cross-entropy is equivalent to using per-
plexity since they are monotonically related.

word level: lemmas and named entity categories.
We experiment with the following models:

• Forms (hereafter f), uses surface forms. This
model replicates the Moore-Lewis approach
and is to be considered the baseline.

• Forms and named entities (hereafter fn), uses
surface forms, with the exception of any word
detected as a named entity, which is substi-
tuted by its type (e.g. person, organisation).

• Lemmas (hereafter l), uses lemmas.

• Lemmas and named entities (hereafter ln),
uses lemmas, with the exception of any word
detected as a named entity, which is substi-
tuted by its type.

A sample sentence, according to each of these
models, follows:
f: I declare resumed the session of the
European Parliament

fn: I declare resumed the session of the
NP00O00

l: i declare resume the session of the
european_parliament

ln: i declare resume the session of the
NP00O00

Table 1 shows the number of n-grams on LMs
built on the English side of News Commentary v8
(hereafter NC) for each of the models. Regarding
1-grams, compared to f, the substitution of named
entities by their categories (fn) results in smaller
vocabulary size (-24.79%). Similarly, the vocabu-
lary is reduced for the models l (-8.39%) and ln (-
44.18%). Although not a result in itself, this might
be an indication that using linguistically motivated
models could be useful to deal with data sparsity.

Table 1: Number of n-grams in LMs built using
the different models

Our procedure follows that of the Moore-Lewis
method. We build LMs for the domain-specific
corpus and for a random subset of the non-
domain-specific corpus of the same size (number
of sentences) of the domain-specific corpus. Each

sentence s in the non-domain-specific corpus is
then scored according to equation 1 where PPI(s)
is the perplexity of s according to the domain-
specific LM and PPO(s) is the perplexity of s ac-
cording to the non-domain-specific LM.

score(s) = PPI(s)− PPO(s) (1)

We build LMs for the domain-specific and non-
domain-specific corpora using the four models
previously introduced. Then we rank the sen-
tences of the non-domain-specific corpus for each
of these models and keep the highest ranked sen-
tences according to a threshold. Finally, we build a
LM on the set of sentences selected3 and compute
the perplexity of the test set on this LM.

We also investigate the combination of the four
models. The procedure is fairly straightforward:
given the sentences selected by all the models for
a given threshold, we iterate through these sen-
tences following the ranking order and keeping all
the distinct sentences selected until we obtain a set
of sentences whose size is the one indicated by the
threshold. I.e. we add to our distinct set of sen-
tences first the top ranked sentence by each of the
methods, then the sentence ranked second by each
method, and so on.

3 Experiments

3.1 Setting
We use corpora from the translation task at
WMT13.4 Our domain-specific corpus is NC, and
we carry out experiments with three non-domain-
specific corpora: a subset of Common Crawl5

(hereafter CC), Europarl version 7 (hereafter EU),
and United Nations (Eisele and Chen, 2010) (here-
after UN). We use the test data from WMT12
(newstest2012) as our test set. We carry out ex-
periments on two languages for which these cor-
pora are available: English (referred to as “en” in
tables) and Spanish (“es” in tables).

We test the methods on three very different non-
domain-specific corpora, both in terms of the top-
ics that they cover (text crawled from web in CC,
parliamentary speeches in EU and official docu-
ments from United Nations in UN) and their size

3For the linguistic methods we replace the sentences se-
lected (which contain lemmas and/or named entities) with the
corresponding sentences in the original corpus (containing
only word forms).

(around 2 million sentences both for CC and EU,
and around 11 million for UN). This can be con-
sidered as a contribution of this paper since pre-
vious works such as Moore and Lewis (2010)
and, more recently, Axelrod et al. (2011) test the
Moore-Lewis method on only one non-domain-
specific corpus: LDC Gigaword and an unpub-
lished general-domain corpus, respectively.

All the LMs are built with IRSTLM
5.80.01 (Federico et al., 2008), use up to 5-grams
and are smoothed using a simplified version of
the improved Kneser-Ney method (Chen and
Goodman, 1996). For lemmatisation and named
entity recognition we use Freeling 3.0 (Padró and
Stanilovsky, 2012). The corpora are tokenised
and truecased using scripts from the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).

3.2 Experiments with Different Models

Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the perplexities obtained
by each method on different subsets selected from
the English corpora CC, EU and UN, respectively.
We obtain these subsets according to different
thresholds, i.e. percentages of sentences selected
from the non-domain-specific corpus. These are
the first 164 ranked sentences,

In all the figures, the results are very similar re-

entities, however, produces substantially different
results. The models that do not use named entity
categories obtain the best results for lower thresh-
olds (up to 1/32 for CC, and up to 1/16 both for

EU and UN). If the best perplexity is obtained
with a lower threshold than this (the case of EU,
1/32, and UN, 1/64), then methods that do not
use named entities obtain the best result. How-
ever, if the optimal perplexity is obtained with a
higher threshold (the case of CC, 1/2), then using
named entities yields the best result.

Table 2 presents the results for each model. For
each scenario (corpus and language combination),
we show the threshold for which the best result is
obtained (column best). The perplexity obtained
on data selected by each model is shown in the
subsequent columns. For the linguistic methods,
we also show the comparison of their performance
to the baseline (as percentages, columns diff). The
perplexity when using the full corpus is shown
(column full) together with the comparison of this
result to the best method (last column diff).

The results, as previously seen in Figures 1, 2
and 3, differ with respect to the corpus but follow
similar trends across languages. For CC we obtain
the best results using named entities. The model
ln obtains the best result for English (5.54% lower

perplexity than the baseline), while the model fn
obtains the best result for Spanish (3.82%), al-
though in both cases the difference between these
two models is rather small.

For the other corpora, the best results are ob-
tained without named entities. In the case of EU,
the baseline obtains the best result, although the
model l is not very far (1.18% higher perplexity
for English and 1.63% for Spanish). This trend
is reversed for UN, the model l obtaining the best
scores but close to the baseline (-0.51%, -0.35%).

3.3 Experiments with the Combination of
Models

Table 3 shows the perplexities obtained by the
method that combines the four models (column
comb) for the threshold that yielded the best re-
sult in each scenario (see Table 2), compares these
results (column diff) to those obtained by the base-
line (column f) and shows the percentage of sen-
tences that this method inspected from the sen-
tences selected by the individual methods (column
perc).

corpus f comb diff perc
cc en 660.77 613.83 -7.10 76.90
eu en 1072.98 1035.51 -3.49 70.51
un en 984.08 908.47 -7.68 74.58

eu es 788.62 748.22 -5.12 68.05
un es 725.93 666.62 -8.17 74.32

Table 3: Results of the combination method

The combination method outperforms the base-
line and any of the individual linguistic models
in all the scenarios. The perplexity obtained by
combining the models is substantially lower than
that obtained by the baseline (ranging from 3.49%
to 8.17%). In all the scenarios, the combination
method takes its sentences from roughly the top
70% sentences ranked by the individual methods.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper has explored the use of linguistic infor-
mation (lemmas and named entities) for the task
of training data selection for LMs. We have intro-
duced three linguistically motivated models, and
compared them to the state-of-the-art method for
perplexity-based data selection across three dif-
ferent corpora and two languages. In four out
of these six scenarios a linguistically motivated
method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.

We have also presented a method which com-
bines surface forms and the three linguistically
motivated methods. This combination outper-
forms the baseline in all the scenarios, select-
ing data whose perplexity is between 3.49% and
8.17% (depending on the corpus and language)
lower than that of the baseline.

Regarding future work, we have several plans.
One interesting experiment would be to apply
these models to a morphologically-rich language,
to check if, as hypothesised, these models deal bet-
ter with sparse data.

Another strand regards the application of these
models to filter parallel corpora, e.g. following the
extension of the Moore-Lewis method (Axelrod et
al., 2011) or in combination with other methods
which are deemed to be more suitable for parallel
data, e.g. (Mansour et al., 2011).

We have used one type of linguistic informa-
tion in each LM, but another possibility is to com-
bine different pieces of linguistic information in
a single LM, e.g. following a hybrid LM that
uses words and tags, depending of the frequency
of each type (Ruiz et al., 2012).

Given the fact that the best result is obtained
with different models depending on the corpus, it
would be worth to investigate whether given a new
corpus, one could predict the best method to be ap-
plied and the threshold for which one could expect
to obtain the minimum perplexity.
