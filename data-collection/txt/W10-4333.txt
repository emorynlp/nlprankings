Abstract 

The purpose of this study is to get a 
working definition that matches people’s 
intuitive notion of gossip and is suffi-
ciently precise for computational imple-
mentation. We conducted two experi-
ments investigating what type of conver-
sations people intuitively understand and 
interpret as gossip, and whether they 
could identify three proposed constitu-
ents of gossip conversations: third per-
son focus, pejorative evaluation and sub-
stantiating behavior. The results show 
that (1) conversations are very likely to 
be considered gossip if all elements are 
present, no intimate relationships exist 
between the participants, and the person 
in focus is unambiguous. (2) Conversa-
tions that have at most one gossip ele-
ment are not considered gossip. (3) Con-
versations that lack one or two elements 
or have an ambiguous element lead to 
inconsistent judgments.  

1 Introduction 

We are interested in creating believable charac-
ters, i.e. “characters that provide the illusion of 
life” (Bates, 1994). Since people engage exten-
sively in gossip, such characters also need to be 
able to understand and engage in gossip in or-
der to be believable in some situations. To en-
able characters to engage in gossip, we need a 
computational model of gossip that can be ap-
plied in the authoring of such characters and/or 
by the characters themselves. Unfortunately, 
such a model does not yet exist.  

Moreover, there is not yet a clear consensus 
on how gossip should be defined, and most of 
the definitions are too vague or too general to 

be useful. Merriam-Webster online dictionary, 
for example, defines gossip as “rumor or report 
of an intimate nature” and “chatty talk”, neither 
of which is specific enough. What we need is a 
working definition that (a) matches people’s 
intuitive notion of gossip to the extent possible, 
given that the notion itself is somewhat vague, 
and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis 
for computational implementation.  

More recent definitions (e.g. Eder and Enke, 
1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al., 
2009) have been derived from analyzing tran-
scriptions of real gossip conversations. These 
definitions have only minor individual differ-
ences and can in essence be formulated as 
“evaluative talk about an absent third person”. 
We have chosen to use this definition as a start-
ing point since it currently is the most specific 
one and since it is based on the observed struc-
ture of naturally occurring gossip conversa-
tions. 

This paper reports the results from two ex-
periments on gossip conversations. The first 
experiment aimed at investigating what type of 
conversations people intuitively perceive as 
gossip. In the second study we also wanted to 
find out whether the subjects would accept a 
given definition and could apply it by identify-
ing three specified gossip elements.  

 The paper is structured as follows. In sec-
tion 2 we give a background to gossip with re-
spect to both its social function as well as its 
conversational structure. Section 3 introduces 
the experimental method. In sections 4 and 5 
we present the two experiments and discuss the 
results. In section 6, finally, we give some final 
remarks and suggestions for future work. 

2 Background 

Gossip has been described as a mechanism for 
social control (e.g. Gluckman, 1963; Fine and 
Rosnow, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; Eggins and 

193



Slade, 1997) that maintains “the unity, morals 
and values of social groups” (Gluckman, 1963). 
It has furthermore been suggested that gossip is 
a form of “information-management”, primar-
ily to improve one’s self-image and “protect 
individual interests” (Paine, 1967), but also to 
influence others (Szwed, 1966; Fine and Ros-
now, 1978). Gossip can furthermore be viewed 
as a form of entertainment (Abrahams, 1970) – 
“a satisfying diversion from the tedium of rou-
tine activities” (Fine and Rosnow, 1978:164).  

Recent studies have used a sociological ap-
proach focusing on analyzing the structure of 
gossip conversations (e.g. Bergmann, 1993; 
Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; 
Hallett et al., 2009). Rather than observing and 
interviewing people in a certain community 
about their gossip behavior, they have analyzed 
transcripts of naturally occurring gossip con-
versations. Their studies show that gossipers 
collaborate in creating the gossip, making it a 
highly interactive genre. They also identified 
two key elements of gossip:  

• Third person focus – the identification 
of an absent third person that is ac-
quainted with, but emotionally disjoint 
from the other participants (Bergmann 
(1993) refers to this as being “virtually” 
absent, while Goodwin (1980) labels it 
“symbolically” absent).  

• An evaluation of the person in focus or 
of his or her behavior. Eggins and 
Slade (1997) propose that the evaluation 
necessarily is pejorative to separate gos-
sip from other types of chat.  

Hallett et al. (2009) found that the gossipers 
often use implicit evaluations to conceal the 
critique, suggesting that the gossipers either 
speak in general terms about something that 
implicitly is understood to be about a certain 
person, or that the gossipers avoid evaluating 
the behavior under the assumption that the 
evaluation is implicit in the behavior itself. In-
stead of specifying the evaluation as being pe-
jorative, they say it is “unsanctioned”.  

In addition to the two elements described 
above, Eggins and Slade (1997) propose a third 
obligatory element: 

• Substantiating behavior – An elabora-
tion of the deviant behavior that can ei-
ther be used as a motivation for the nega-
tive evaluation, or as a way to introduce 
gossip in the conversation. Eder and 

Enke (1991) use a different model, but 
the substantiating behavior component 
corresponds roughly to their optional 
Explanation act.  

There seems to be a consensus that gossip 
conversations have third person focus. The 
question is whether a gossip conversation nec-
essarily has both a substantiating behavior 
component as well as a pejorative evaluation 
component, and if they do, can they be identi-
fied? In the experiments presented later in this 
paper, we hope to shed light on whether these 
components are necessary or not. 

3 Method  

During the fall 2009, we conducted two ex-
periments about gossip conversations. The aim 
of the experiments was to verify to what extent 
the definition of gossip accords with intuitive 
recognition of gossip episodes, and secondly 
whether people could reliably identify constitu-
ent elements. 

The data was collected using online ques-
tionnaires1 that were distributed through differ-
ent email-lists mainly targeting researchers and 
students within game design, language technol-
ogy, and related fields, located primarily in 
North America and Europe. The questionnaires 
had the following structure: The first page con-
sisted of an introduction, including instructions, 
and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt 
retrieved from a screenplay followed by the 
question and/or task.  

3.1 Hypotheses  
Based on the previous studies presented earlier 
(in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke, 
1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the 
following hypotheses: 

• The more gossip elements present in the 
text, the more likely the conversation 
will be considered gossip. 

• Third person focus is a necessary (but 
not sufficient) element of gossip.  

• Conversations in which the participants 
(including the target) are intimately re-
lated will be rated lower than those in 
which all participants are emotionally 
separated.

4 Experiment I: Identifying gossip text 

The aim of the first experiment was to investi-
gate how people intuitively understand and in-
terpret gossip conversations.   

4.1 Material and procedure  
The questionnaire contained 16 different dia-
logue excerpts retrieved from transcripts of the 
famous sitcoms Desperate Housewives 2  and 
Seinfeld3. The excerpts were selected to cover 
different combinations of the elements pre-
sented in the previous section (third person fo-
cus, an evaluation, and a motivation for the 
evaluation), as in the following dialogue4: 

B:  Tisha. Tisha. Oh, I can tell by that look 
on your face you’ve got something good. 
Now, come on, don’t be selfish.  

T:  Well, first off, you’re not friends with 
Maisy Gibbons, are you? 

B:  No. 
T:  Thank god, because this is too good. 

Maisy was arrested. While Harold was at 
work, she was having sex with men in her 
house for money. Can you imagine?  

B:  No, I can’t. 
T:  And that’s not even the best part. Word 

is, she had a little black book with all her 
clients’ names.  

R:  So, uh … you think that’ll get out? 
T:  Of course. These things always do. 

Nancy, wait up. I can’t wait to tell you 
this. Wait, wait. 

A preliminary analysis to determine whether 
the elements were present or not, was made by 
the first author. The instructions contained no 
information about the elements and no defini-
tion was given. To each excerpt we provided 
some contextual information, such as the inter-
personal relationship between the speakers and 
other people mentioned in the dialogue, e.g.: 

The married couple, Bree (B) and Rex (R) 
Van de Kamp, is having lunch at the club. 
Some women laughing at the next table cause 
the two of them to turn and look. One of their 
acquaintances, Tisha (T), walks away from 
that table and heads to another one. Maisy 
Gibbons is another woman in their neigh-
borhood, known to be very dominant and 
judgmental towards the other women.

The subjects were asked to read and rank the 
excerpts using the following scale: 

• Absolutely not gossip  

• Could be considered gossip in some contexts 

• Would be considered gossip in most contexts 

• Absolutely gossip 

For the purpose of analysis we converted the 
above responses to integers from 0 to 3. 

4.2 Results  
A total of 52 participants completed the ex-
periment. The following table shows the distri-
bution of ratings for each of the 16 excerpts 
(the table is sorted by the mean rating).

Table 1: Gossip ratings of all 16 questions 

sorted by their mean value.  
 

It is apparent from the table that a few ex-
cerpts are clearly gossip or clearly not gossip, 
but there is much disagreement on other ex-
cerpts. Inter-rater reliability is α = 0.437: well 
above chance, but not particularly high6.  Only 
7 of the 16 excerpts (ID #2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15) 
were clearly rated as gossip or not gossip by 
more than half of the subjects, and only 5 of 
those have a mean rating below 0.5 or above 
2.5.  

                                                 
5 Presentation was ordered by ID, same for all subjects. 
6 The reported value is Krippendorff’s α with the interval 
distance metric (Krippendorff 1980). Interval α is defined 
as 1 – Do/De, where Do (observed disagreement) is twice 
the mean variance of the individual item ratings, and De 
(expected disagreement) is twice the variance of all the 
ratings. For the above table, Do = 1.327 and De = 2.585. 

195



Despite the apparently low agreement, the 
results correspond fairly well with our expecta-
tions. The 3 excerpts with a mean value below 
0.5 had no gossip elements at all and the other 
two excerpts with a median value of 0 had only 
one gossip element. Similarly, the two excerpts 
rated highest clearly had all gossip elements. 
The rest of the excerpts, however, either lacked 
one element or had one element that was un-
clear in some regard (see discussion, below). 
Conversations between family members or 
partners also caused higher disagreements, 
which seem to support Bergmann’s (1993) re-
mark: “[…] we can ask whether we should call 
gossip the conversations between spouses […] 
alone. This surely is a borderline case for which 
there is no single answer” (p. 68).  

4.3 Discussion  
Among the nine excerpts with a mean value 
approximately between 1 and 2 (ID #1, 3, 4, 9, 
10, 12, 13, 14, and 16), we made the following 
observations: 3 excerpts lacked one element; in 
2 of them, the gossipers were family members 
or partners; 3 excerpts had an ambiguous focus, 
among which one also possibly was perceived 
as a warning.  

By “ambiguous focus” we mean that it is un-
clear whether the person in focus is the speaker, 
the addressee or the absent third person. In-
stead, the absent third person seems to play a 
sub-ordinate role rather than focused role, for 
instance as part of a self-disclosure or a con-
frontation. If the conversation is the least bit 
confrontational, the addressee tends to go into 
defense rather than choosing a more typical 
gossip response, such as support, expansion, or 
challenge (Eder and Enke, 1991) in order to 
protect the face. Hence, no “gossip fuel” is 
added to the conversation.  

The result of the remaining excerpt7 is how-
ever more difficult to explain. One possible 
explanation is that the initiator was unac-
quainted with the target, but perhaps more 
likely is that some of the subjects interpreted 
the conversation as mocking rather than gossip:  

E: Who’s that? 
D:  That’s Sam, the new girl in accounting. 
W: What’s with her arms? They just hang 

like salamis. 
D:  She walks like orangutan. 
E:  Better call the zoo.

5 Experiment II: Identifying gossip 
elements in a text 

The aim of the second experiment was to inves-
tigate whether the subjects could accept and 
apply a given definition by identifying the three 
obligatory elements of gossip according to 
Eggins and Slade (1997) (see section 2); third 
person focus, pejorative evaluation, and sub-
stantiating behavior. In addition to the ele-
ments, we provided the more general definition 
presented in section 1 (“evaluative talk about 
an absent third person”). 

The results from the first experiment indi-
cated that conversations that seemingly had all 
the elements but in which the person in focus 
was ambiguous, received a lower gossip rating 
than those having an unambiguous third person 
focus. So an additional goal was to investigate 
whether changing the relationship between the 
participants would affect the gossip rating.  

5.1 Material  
We used excerpts from Seinfeld8, Desperate 
Housewives 9 , Legally blonde 10 , and Mean 
girls11. In total we selected 21 excerpts, of 
which 8 also occurred in the first experiment. 
Two of the recurring excerpts were used both 
in their original versions as well as in modified 
versions, in which we had removed the emo-
tional connections between the participants. 
The purpose of this was to find out whether 
changing the interpersonal relationship would 
change the gossip rating.  

5.2 Procedure 
The subjects were instructed to read the ex-
cerpts and then identify the gossip elements 
according to the following description: 

• The person being talked about (third per-
son focus) – the “target”, e.g. “Maisy 
Gibbons was arrested”  

• Pejorative evaluation. A judgment of the 
target him-/herself or of the target’s be-
havior. This evaluation is in most cases 
negative, e.g. “She’s a slut”, “He’s 
weird”

• The deviant behavior that motivates the 
gossip and provides evidence for the 
judgment (also called the substantiating 
behavior stage), e.g. “Maisy Gibbons 
was arrested” 

For each element they found, they were 
asked to specify the corresponding line refer-
ence as given in the text. They were also in-
structed to say whether they considered the 
conversation to be gossip or not gossip. If their 
rating disagreed with the definition, i.e. if they 
had found all the elements but still rated the 
conversation as not gossip, or if one or more 
elements were lacking but the conversation was 
considered gossip anyway, they were asked to 
specify why.  

5.3 Results 
We analyzed the results from the 19 subjects 
who completed ratings for all 21 excerpts. This 
gave a total of 399 yes/no judgments on 4 at-
tributes. Inter-coder reliability 12  is shown in 
Table 2.  The easiest attribute to interpret is 
third person focus. All but three of the subjects 
marked either 4 or 5 excerpts as not having 
third person focus, with the remaining subjects 
not deviating by much (marking 3, 6, and 7 
excerpts). Moreover, the subjects agree on 
which excerpts have third person focus: only 
one excerpt gets a substantial number of con-
flicting ratings (see the analysis given below in 
section 5.4), while the remaining 20 excerpts 
get consistent ratings from all subjects with 
only occasional deviation by one or two of the 
deviant subjects. This accounts for the high 
observed agreement on this feature (94.9%). 
Expected agreement is high because the corpus 
is not balanced (16 of 21 excerpts display third 
person focus), but even so, chance-corrected 
agreement is high (85.1%), showing that third 
person focus is an attribute that participants can 
readily and reliably identify. 

The remaining attributes, including gossip, 
are less clear. Agreement on all of them is 
clearly above chance, but is not particularly 
high, showing that these notions are either not 
fully defined, or that the excerpts are ambigu-
ous. Gossip itself is identified somewhat more 
reliably than either substantiating behavior or 
pejorative evaluation; this casts doubt about the 
ability to use the latter two as defining features 
                                                 
12 We used Krippendorff's alpha with the nominal dis-
tance metric. Observed agreement is defined as Ao = 1 – 
Do, while expected agreement is: Ae = 1 – De.

To test the relationship between the various 

features, we looked for co-occurrences among 
the individual judgments. We have a total of 
399 ratings (21 excerpts times 19 judges), each 
with 4 attributes; these are distributed as shown 
in Table 313. We can see that third person focus 
is an almost necessary condition for classifying 
a screenplay conversation as gossip, though it 
is by no means sufficient. Tables 4–6 show the 
co-occurrences of individual features to gossip; 
the association is strongest between gossip and 
third person focus and weakest between gossip 
and pejorative evaluation.

Table 8 shows the correlation between gos-

sip and each of the other three features. The 
first column calculates correlation based on the 
individual judgments (399 items, each score is 
either 0 or 1); the second column calculates 
correlation based on the rated excerpts (21 
items, each score is an integer between 0 and 
19, as in table 7); and the third column groups 
the judgments by subject (19 items, each score 
is an integer between 0 and 21, indicating the 
number of dialogues in which the subject iden-
tified the particular feature; the full data are not 
shown).

All the correlations are significantly different 
from 0 at the p ≤ 0.05 level or greater. The dif-
ferences between the columns are not signifi-
cant, except for the difference between the third 
person correlation by individuals and that by 
excerpt, which is significant at p ≤ 0.05. The 
correlations between the features on the indi-
vidual judgments show that subjects tend to 
identify the different features together; this may 
be partly a reflection of awareness on their part 
that the features are expected to go together, 
given the task definition. The correlations be-
tween the excerpt scores show that the excerpts 
themselves differ along the four dimensions, 
and these differences go hand in hand. Finally, 
we see that the subjects themselves differ in 
how often they identify the different features, 
though the correlations are likely to be just a 
reflection of the first tendency identified above, 
to mark the features together. 

5.4 Discussion 
We wanted to find out whether the subjects 
would accept, understand and be able to apply a 
given definition. The results from the experi-
ment showed that the subjects accepted the 
given definition to some extent and managed to 
apply it. When the subjects disagreed they were 
asked to say why. One of the subjects, for ex-
ample, explicitly disagreed with the definition 
given in the introduction and provided a 
counter definition: “Gossip is idle talk or ru-
mor, especially about the personal or private 
affairs of others”. Yet another subject was un-
certain about which definition to use: “Depends 
what you mean by gossip. It can either mean 
malicious, behind the back talk of other people 
or idle chat.  If you mean ‘idle chat’ with gos-
sip then this is also gossip”. A possible expla-
nation could be that the subjects refer to differ-
ent forms of gossip (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978) 
and therefore apply different definitions (such 
as the lexical definition presented earlier) than 
the one that was given in the experiment.

Several subjects stated that they judged the 
conversation as gossip even if they did not 
identify any pejorative evaluation, and they 
also questioned whether the evaluation had to 
be negative or even present at all, or as one of 
the subjects put it: “Although there is no pejo-
rative evaluation (at least not clearly) I believe 
this is gossip”. These subjects thus explicitly 
reject Eggins and Slade’s (1997) requirement 
that the evaluation has to be pejorative.  

The examples above show that people have 
variable intuitions of gossip and consequently 
the concept of gossip is somewhat vague. Even 
so, the experiment also showed that people to a 
large degree are in agreement when the exam-
ples according to the given definition clearly 
are gossip or not gossip. Meaning that even 
though the definition does not capture all types 
of (potential) gossip conversations, it captures 
those episodes that most people agree to be 
gossip, which for our purpose is sufficient.  

5.5 Effect of interpersonal relations 
In some particular cases, the subjects did not 

choose gossip even if all elements had been 
found. The results from the first experiment 
indicated that this deviation either was related 
to the interpersonal relationship between the 
gossip participants or that the focus was am-
biguous. In order to test whether changing the 
inter-personal relationship between the partici-
pants would change the gossip rating, we com-
pared the results from the conversations we had 
modified with their original counterparts. In 
one of the original excerpts, the addressee was 
romantically involved with the man that the 
speaker was talking about. The speaker formu-
lated the negative assessment and deviant be-
havior in a way that for most people would be 
interpreted as a warning, which probably ex-
plains why only 7 of the 19 subjects rated the 
original conversation as gossip. The modified 
version on the other hand, was rated as gossip 
by all subjects.   

In the second dialogue, the speaker questions 
the addressee’s choice of person to date, and 
does this by both evaluating the person nega-
tively as well as providing evidence for the 
evaluation. It turns out, however, that the ad-
dressee thinks she is going out for a date with 
someone else, so a large part of the conversa-
tion deals with trying to identify the target. 15 
of 19 subjects rated the original conversation as 
gossip, while all subjects rated it as gossip in 
the modified version. These comparisons indi-

cate that the status of the relationship between 
the gossipers and the gossip target affects 
whether the dialogue is considered gossip or 
not. In the original version of both these exam-
ples, the focus was ambiguous, i.e. the focus 
was as much on the addressee as on the absent 
third person. 

We have shown that third person focus is a 
key element of gossip. The correlation was fur-
thermore confirmed by the subjects themselves 
in their comments, where the lack of third per-
son often was listed as a reason for not choos-
ing gossip. In one example, the respondent re-
garded the conversation as gossip even if it 
really was an insult directed towards the ad-
dressee, but explained it as its “…almost like 
he’s forgotten he’s talking to the person he’s 
giving this opinion/gossip about”. 

The highest disagreement concerning third 
person focus was found in the following ex-
cerpt15: 

Karen: Okay, what is it? 
Gretchen: Regina says everyone hates you 

because you’re such a slut. 
Karen: She said that? 
Gretchen: You didn’t hear it from me. 

The dialogue contains an ambiguous focus in 
that it both includes a quote as well as a con-
frontational insult. By using the third person 
reference, Gretchen avoids taking responsibility 
for the insult. In some sense both Karen and 
Regina are in focus, where Karen is the target 
of the pejorative evaluation and Regina can be 
interpreted as being the focus of the substantiat-
ing behavior component. How Regina’s role is 
interpreted is determined by the respondents’ 
personal attitude towards gossiping in general 
(i.e. whether they interpret Gretchen’s utterance 
as containing an implicit evaluation of Regina’s 
behavior or not), and how they perceive the 
interpersonal relationship between Karen and 
Gretchen. Gossip has an inherent contradiction 
in that it both has a function of negotiating the 
accepted way to behave while it at the same 
time often is considered an inappropriate activ-
ity that can have serious negative consequences 
for both the gossipers as well as the gossip tar-
get (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; 
Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al., 2009).

6 Final remarks and future work 

The aim of these studies has been to get a 
workable definition of gossip that people can 
agree upon and that is sufficiently precise to 
provide a basis for computational implementa-
tion.  

We conducted two experiments to investi-
gate people’s intuitive notion of gossip and the 
results show that (1) conversations in which all 
elements are present, where no intimate rela-
tionships exist between the participants, and in 
which the person in focus is unambiguous, are 
very likely to be considered gossip. (2) Conver-
sations that have at most one gossip element 
are not considered gossip. (3) Inconsistencies 
are mainly found in conversations that lack one 
or two elements or have at least one element 
that is ambiguous, or are taking place between 
gossipers that have an intimate relationship.  

We have suggested that third person focus is 
a necessary, but not sufficient, element of gos-
sip, but the other elements are less clear even if 
their co-occurrence in a conversation clearly 
affects the gossip score.  In the second experi-
ment this might be due to the instructions, but it 
does not explain the unbiased results from the 
first experiment. So on the one hand we can 
clearly see that all three elements are important 
for the understanding of gossip, but on the 
other hand, the subjects’ had trouble in identi-
fying them. This suggests that we need to fur-
ther investigate these elements to see how they 
can be specified more clearly.  

We have taken a first step toward a computa-
tional account of gossip, by empirically verify-
ing the extent to which the given definition can 
be applied and the components recognized by 
people. Some of our next steps to further this 
program include authoring content for believ-
able characters that follow this definition, as 
well as attempting to automatically recognize 
these elements. 

Among the possible applications of gossip 
we can think of game characters and virtual 
humans that are capable of engaging in gossip 
conversations to share information and create 
social bonds with a human user or its avatar. 
This involves being able to both generate gos-
sip on basis of the interpersonal relationship 
and selecting content that could be regarded as 
gossip, as well as to automatically detect gossip 
occurring in a conversation. The latter use 
could also be used for characters that actively 

want to avoid taking part in gossip conversa-
tions.
