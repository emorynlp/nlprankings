Abstract
The pyramid method for content evaluation of auto-
mated summarizers produces scores that are shown
to correlate well with manual scores used in edu-
cational assessment of students’ summaries. This
motivates the development of a more accurate auto-
mated method to compute pyramid scores. Of three
methods tested here, the one that performs best re-
lies on latent semantics.

1 Introduction
The pyramid method is an annotation and scor-
ing procedure to assess semantic content of sum-
maries in which the content units emerge from
the annotation. Each content unit is weighted
by its frequency in human reference summaries.
It has been shown to produce reliable rank-
ings of automated summarization systems, based
on performance across multiple summarization
tasks (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Passon-
neau, 2010). It has also been applied to assessment
of oral narrative skills of children (Passonneau et
al., 2007). Here we show its potential for assess-
ment of the reading comprehension of community
college students. We then present a method to au-
tomate pyramid scores based on latent semantics.

The pyramid method depends on two phases of
manual annotation, one to identify weighted con-
tent units in model summaries written by profi-
cient humans, and one to score target summaries
against the models. The first annotation phase
yields Summary Content Units (SCUs), sets of
text fragments that express the same basic content.
Each SCU is weighted by the number of model
summaries it occurs in.

Figure 1 illustrates a Summary Content Unit
taken from pyramid annotation of five model sum-
maries of an elementary physics text. The ele-
ments of an SCU are its index; a label, created by
the annotator; contributors (Ctr.), or text fragments
from the model summaries; and the weight (Wt.),
corresponding to the number of contributors from
distinct model summaries. Four of the five model

summaries contribute to SCU 105 shown here.
The four contributors have lexical items in com-
mon (matter, objects, substances), and many dif-
ferences (makes up, being present). SCU weights,
which range from 1 to the number of model sum-
maries M , induce a partition on the set of SCUs
in all summaries into subsets Tw, w ∈ 1, . . . ,M .
The resulting partition is referred to as a pyramid
because, starting with the subset for SCUs with
weight 1, each next subset has fewer SCUs.

To score new target summaries, they are first
annotated to identify which SCUs they express.
Application of the pyramid method to assessment
of student reading comprehension is impractical
without an automated method to annotate target
summaries. Previous work on automated pyramid
scores of automated summarizers performs well
at ranking systems on many document sets, but
is not precise enough to score human summaries
of a single text. We test three automated pyramid
scoring procedures, and find that one based on dis-
tributional semantics correlates best with manual
pyramid scores, and has higher precision and re-
call for content units in students’ summaries than
methods that depend on string matching.

2 Related Work
The most prominent NLP technique applied to
reading comprehension is LSA (Landauer and Du-
mais, 1997), an early approach to latent semantic
analysis claimed to correlate with reading compre-
hension (Foltz et al., 2000). More recently, LSA

143



has been incorporated with a suite of NLP metrics
to assess students’ strategies for reading compre-
hension using think-aloud protocols (Boonthum-
Denecke et al., 2011). The resulting tool, and sim-
ilar assesment tools such as Coh-Metrix, assess
aspects of readability of texts, such as coherence,
but do not assess students’ comprehension through
their writing (Graesser et al., 2004; Graesser et al.,
2011). E-rater is an automated essay scorer for
standardized tests such as GMAT that also relies
on a suite of NLP techniques (Burstein et al., 1998;
Burstein, 2003). The pyramid method (Nenkova
and Passonneau, 2004), was inspired in part by
work in reading comprehension that scores con-
tent using human annotation (Beck et al., 1991).

An alternate line of research attempts to repli-
cate human reading comprehension. An auto-
mated tool to read and answer questions relies on
abductive reasoning over logical forms extracted
from text (Wellner et al., 2006). One of the perfor-
mance issues is resolving meanings of words: re-
moval of WordNet features degraded performance.

The most widely used automated content evalu-
ation is ROUGE (Lin, 2004; Lin and Hovy, 2003).
It relies on model summaries, and depends on
ngram overlap measures of different types. Be-
cause of its dependence on strings, it performs bet-
ter with larger sets of model summaries. In con-
trast to ROUGE, pyramid scoring is robust with as
few as four or five model summaries (Nenkova and
Passonneau, 2004). A fully automated approach
to evaluation for ranking systems that requires no
model summaries incorporates latent semantic dis-
tributional similarities across words (Louis and
Nenkova, 2009). The authors note, however, it
does not perform well on individual summaries.

3 Criteria for Automated Scoring
Pyramid scores of students’ summaries correlate
well with a manual main ideas score developed
for an intervention study with community college
freshmen who attended remedial classes (Perin et
al., In press). Twenty student summaries by stu-
dents who attended the same college and took the
same remedial course were selected from a larger
set of 322 that summarized an elementary physics
text. All were native speakers of English, and
scored within 5 points of the mean reading score
for the larger sample. For the intervention study,
student summaries had been assigned a score to
represent how many main ideas from the source
text were covered (Perin et al., In press). Inter-

rater reliability of the main ideas score, as given
by the Pearson correlation coefficient, was 0.92.

One of the co-authors created a model pyra-
mid from summaries written by proficient Masters
of Education students, annotated 20 target sum-
maries against this pyramid, and scored the re-
sult. The raw score of a target summary is the
sum of its SCU weights. Pyramid scores have
been normalized by the number of SCUs in the
summary (analogous to precision), or the average
number of SCUs in model summaries (analogous
to recall). We normalized raw scores as the aver-
age of the two previous normalizations (analogous
to F-measure). The resulting scores have a high
Pearson’s correlation of 0.85 with the main idea
score (Perin et al., In press) that was manually as-
signed to the students’ summaries.

To be pedagogically useful, an automated
method to assign pyramid scores to students’ sum-
maries should meet the following criteria: 1) reli-
ably rank students’ summaries of a source text, 2)
assign correct pyramid scores, and 3) identify the
correct SCUs. A method could do well on crite-
rion 1 but not 2, through scores that have uniform
differences from corresponding manual pyramid
scores. Also, since each weight partition will have
more than one SCU, it is possible to produce the
correct numeric score by matching incorrect SCUs
that have the correct weights. Our method meets
the first two criteria, and has superior performance
on the third to other methods.

4 Approach: Dynamic Programming
Previous work observed that assignment of SCUs
to a target summary can be cast as a dynamic
programming problem (Harnly et al., 2005). The
method presented there relied on unigram overlap
to score the closeness of the match of each eli-
gible substring in a summary against each SCU
in the pyramid. It returned the set of matches
that yielded the highest score for the summary.
It produced good rankings across summarization
tasks, but assigned scores much lower than those
assigned by humans. Here we extend the DP ap-
proach in two ways. We test two new semantic
text similarities, a string comparison method and a
distributional semantic method, and we present a
general mechanism to set a threshold value for an
arbitrary computation of text similarity.

Unigram overlap ignores word order, and can-
not consider the latent semantic content of a
string, only the observed unigram tokens. To

144



take order into account, we use Ratcliff/Obershelp
(R/O), which measures overlap of common sub-
sequences (Ratcliff and Metzener, 1988). To take
the underlying semantics into account, we use co-
sine similarity of 100-dimensional latent vectors
of the candidate substrings and of the textual com-
ponents of the SCU (label and contributors). Be-
cause the algorithm optimizes for the total sum of
all SCUs, when there is no threshold similarity to
count as a match, it favors matching shorter sub-
strings to SCUs with higher weights. Therefore,
we add a threshold to the algorithm, below which
matches are not considered. Because each sim-
ilarity metric has different properties and distri-
butions, a single absolute value threshhold is not
comparable across metrics. We present a method
to set comparable thresholds across metrics.

4.1 Latent Vector Representations

To represent the semantics of SCUs and candidate
substrings of target summaries, we applied the la-
tent vector model of Guo and Diab (2012).1 Guo
and Diab find that it is very hard to learn a 100-
dimension latent vector based only on the lim-
ited observed words in a short text. Hence they
include unobserved words that provide thousands
more features for a short text. This produces more
accurate results for short texts, which makes the
method suitable for our problem. Weighted ma-
trix factorization (WMF) assigns a small weight
for missing words so that latent semantics depends
largely on observed words.

A 100-dimension latent vector representation
was learned for every span of contiguous words
within sentence bounds in a target summary, for
the 20 summaries. The training data was selected
to be domain independent, so that our model could
be used for summaries across domains. Thus we
prepared a corpus that is balanced across topics
and genres. It is drawn from from WordNet sense
definitions, Wiktionary sense definitions, and the
Brown corpus. It yields a co-occurrence matrix
M of unique words by sentences of size 46,619
× 393,666. Mij holds the TF-IDF value of word
wi in sentence sj . Similarly, the contributors
to and the label for an SCU were given a 100-
dimensional latent vector representation. These
representations were then used to compare candi-
dates from a summary to SCUs in the pyramid.

4.2 Three Comparison Methods
An SCU consists of at least two text strings: the
SCU label and one contributor. As in Harnly et
al. (2005), we use three similarity comparisons
scusim(X,SCU), where X is the target summary
string. When the comparison parameter is set to
min (max, or mean), the similarity of X to
each SCU contributor and the label is computed
in turn, and the minimum (max, or mean) is re-
turned.

4.3 Similarity Thresholds
We define a threshold parameter for a target SCU
to match a pyramid SCU based on the distributions
of scores each similarity method gives to the target
SCUs identified by the human annotator. Annota-
tion of the target summaries yielded 204 SCUs.
The similarity score being a continuous random
variable, the empirical sample of 204 scores is
very sparse. Hence, we use a Gaussian kernel den-
sity estimator to provide a non-parametric estima-
tion of the probability densities of scores assigned
by each of the similarity methods to the manually
identified SCUs. We then select five threshold val-
ues corresponding to those for which the inverse
cumulative density function (icdf) is equal to 0.05,
0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25. Each threshold rep-
resents the probability that a manually identified
SCU will be missed.

5 Experiment
The three similarity computations, three methods
to compare against SCUs, and five icdf thresh-
olds yield 45 variants, as shown in Figure 2. Each
variant was evaluated by comparing the unnormal-
ized automated variant, e.g., Lvc, max, 0.64 (its
0.15 icdf) to the human gold scores, using each of
the evaluation metrics described in the next sub-
section. To compute confidence intervals for the
evaluation metrics for each variant, we use boot-
strapping with 1000 samples (Efron and Tibshi-
rani, 1986).

To assess the 45 variants, we compared their
scores to the manual scores. We also compared
the sets of SCUs retrieved. By our criterion 1), an
automated score that correlates well with manual
scores for summaries of a given text could be used

(3 Similarities) × (3 Comparisons) × (5 Thresholds) = 45
(Uni, R/O, Lvc) × (min, mean, max) × (0.05, . . . , 0.25)

to indicate how well students rank against other
students. We report several types of correlation
tests. Pearsons tests the strength of a linear cor-
relation between the two sets of scores; it will be
high if the same order is produced, with the same
distance between pairs of scores. The Spearman
rank correlation is said to be preferable for ordi-
nal comparisons, meaning where the unit interval
is less relevant. Kendall’s tau, an alternative rank
correlation, is less sensitive to outliers and more
intuitive. It is the proportion of concordant pairs
(pairs in the same order) less the proportion of dis-
cordant pairs. Since correlations can be high when
differences are uniform, we use Student’s T to test
whether differences score means statistically sig-
nificant. Criterion 2) is met if the correlations are
high and the means are not significantly different.

6 Results
The correlation tests indicate that several variants
achieve sufficiently high correlations to rank stu-
dents’ summaries (criterion 2). On all correla-
tion tests, the highest ranking automated method
is LVc, max, 0.64; this similarity threshold corre-
sponds to the 0.15 icdf. As shown in Table 1, the
Pearson correlation is 0.93. Note, however, that it
is not significantly higher than many of its com-
petitors. LVc, min, 0.40 did not rank as highly for
Speaman and Kendall’s tau correlations, but the
Student’s T result in column 3 of Table 1 shows
that this is the only variant in the table that yields
absolute scores that are not significantly different
from the human annotated scores. Thus this vari-
ant best balances criteria 1 and 2.

The differences in the unnormalized score com-
puted by the automated systems from the score as-
signed by human annotation are consistently posi-
tive. Inspection of the SCUs retrieved by each au-
tomated variant reveals that the automated systems
lean toward the tendency to identify false posi-
tives. This may result from the DP implementation
decision to maximize the score. To get a measure
of the degree of overlap between the SCUs that
were selected automatically versus manually (cri-

terion 4), we computed recall and precision for the
various methods. Table 2 shows the mean recall
and precision (with standard deviations) across all
five thresholds for each combination of similarity
method and method of comparison to the SCU.
The low standard deviations show that the recall
and precision are relatively similar across thresh-
olds for each variant. The LVc methods outper-
form R/O and unigram overlap methods, particu-
larly for the precision of SCUs retrieved, indicat-
ing the use of distributional semantics is a supe-
rior approach for pyramid summary scoring than
methods based on string matching.

The unigram overlap and R/O methods show the
least variation across comparison methods (min,
mean, max). LVc methods outperform them, on
precision (Table 2). Meeting all three criteria is
difficult, and the LVc method is clearly superior.

7 Conclusion
We extended a dynamic programming frame-
work (Harnly et al., 2005) to automate pyramid
scores more accurately. Improvements resulted
from principled thresholds for similarity, and from
a vector representation (LVc) to capture the latent
semantics of short spans of text (Guo and Diab,
2012). The LVc methods perform best at all three
criteria for a pedagogically useful automatic met-
ric. Future work will address how to improve pre-
cision and recall of the gold SCUs.
