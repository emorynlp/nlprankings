Abstract

We present Conditional Random Fields
based approaches for detecting agree-
ment/disagreement between speakers in
English broadcast conversation shows. We
develop annotation approaches for a variety
of linguistic phenomena. Various lexical,
structural, durational, and prosodic features
are explored. We compare the performance
when using features extracted from au-
tomatically generated annotations against
that when using human annotations. We
investigate the efficacy of adding prosodic
features on top of lexical, structural, and
durational features. Since the training data
is highly imbalanced, we explore two sam-
pling approaches, random downsampling
and ensemble downsampling. Overall, our
approach achieves 79.2% (precision), 50.5%
(recall), 61.7% (F1) for agreement detection
and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (recall), and
55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on the
English broadcast conversation data.

1 Introduction

In this work, we present models for detecting
agreement/disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement)
between speakers in English broadcast conversation
shows. The Broadcast Conversation (BC) genre dif-
fers from the Broadcast News (BN) genre in that
it is more interactive and spontaneous, referring to
free speech in news-style TV and radio programs
and consisting of talk shows, interviews, call-in
programs, live reports, and round-tables. Previous�yThis work was performed while the author was at ICSI.

work on detecting (dis)agreements has been focused
on meeting data. (Hillard et al., 2003), (Galley
et al., 2004), (Hahn et al., 2006) used spurt-level
agreement annotations from the ICSI meeting cor-
pus (Janin et al., 2003). (Hillard et al., 2003) ex-
plored unsupervised machine learning approaches
and on manual transcripts, they achieved an over-
all 3-way agreement/disagreement classification ac-
curacy as 82% with keyword features. (Galley et
al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the de-
tection of (dis)agreements. They used adjacency
pair information to determine the structure of their
conditional Markov model and outperformed the re-
sults of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3-
way classification accuracy into 86.9%. (Hahn et al.,
2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms
and reached a competitive performance of 86.7%
3-way classification accuracy on manual transcrip-
tions with only lexical features. (Germesin and Wil-
son, 2009) investigated supervised machine learn-
ing techniques and yields competitive results on the
annotated data from the AMI meeting corpus (Mc-
Cowan et al., 2005).

Our work differs from these previous studies in
two major categories. One is that a different def-
inition of (dis)agreement was used. In the cur-
rent work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a respond-
ing speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with
or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first
speaker. Second, we explored (dis)agreement de-
tection in broadcast conversation. Due to the dif-
ference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality be-
tween speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meet-
ings, (dis)agreement may have different character-

374



istics. Different from the unsupervised approaches
in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised ap-
proaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted su-
pervised training. Also, different from (Hillard et
al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classifica-
tion was carried out on the utterance level, instead
of on the spurt-level. Galley et al. extended Hillard
et al.’s work by adding features from previous spurts
and features from the general dialog context to in-
fer the class of the current spurt, on top of fea-
tures from the current spurt (local features) used by
Hillard et al. Galley et al. used adjacency pairs to
describe the interaction between speakers and the re-
lations between consecutive spurts. In this prelim-
inary study on broadcast conversation, we directly
modeled (dis)agreement detection without using ad-
jacency pairs. Still, within the conditional random
fields (CRF) framework, we explored features from
preceding and following utterances to consider con-
text in the discourse structure. We explored a wide
variety of features, including lexical, structural, du-
rational, and prosodic features. To our knowledge,
this is the first work to systematically investigate
detection of agreement/disagreement for broadcast
conversation data. The remainder of the paper is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and
automatic annotation modules. Section 3 describes
various features and the CRF model we explored.
Experimental results and discussion appear in Sec-
tion 4, as well as conclusions and future directions.

2 Data and Automatic Annotation

In this work, we selected English broadcast con-
versation data from the DARPA GALE pro-
gram collected data (GALE Phase 1 Release
4, LDC2006E91; GALE Phase 4 Release 2,
LDC2009E15). Human transcriptions and manual
speaker turn labels are used in this study. Also,
since the (dis)agreement detection output will be
used to analyze social roles and relations of an inter-
acting group, we first manually marked soundbites
and then excluded soundbites during annotation and
modeling. We recruited annotators to provide man-
ual annotations of speaker roles and (dis)agreement
to use for the supervised training of models. We de-
fined a set of speaker roles as follows. Host/chair
is a person associated with running the discussions

or calling the meeting. Reporting participant is a
person reporting from the field, from a subcommit-
tee, etc. Commentator participant/Topic participant
is a person providing commentary on some subject,
or person who is the subject of the conversation and
plays a role, e.g., as a newsmaker. Audience par-
ticipant is an ordinary person who may call in, ask
questions at a microphone at e.g. a large presenta-
tion, or be interviewed because of their presence at a
news event. Other is any speaker who does not fit in
one of the above categories, such as a voice talent,
an announcer doing show openings or commercial
breaks, or a translator.

Agreements and disagreements are com-
posed of different combinations of initiating
utterances and responses. We reformulated the
(dis)agreement detection task as the sequence
tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for
identifying whether a given utterance is initiating
a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement
response to such an opportunity, or is neither of
these, in the show. For example, a Negative tag
question followed by a negation response forms an
agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not
black and white, is it? B: [Agreeing Response]
No, it isn’t. The data sparsity problem is serious.
Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances
are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or
response utterances, about 10% only among all
data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved.

These annotators also labeled shows with a va-
riety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language
use constituents, LUC), including discourse mark-
ers, disfluencies, person addresses and person men-
tions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dia-
log act tags (DAT). We categorized dialog acts into
statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete.
We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses
(e.g., uh, um), repetitions, corrections, and false
starts. Person address (PA) terms are terms that a
speaker uses to address another person. Person men-
tions (PM) are references to non-participants in the
conversation. Discourse markers (DM) are words
or phrases that are related to the structure of the
discourse and express a relation between two utter-
ances, for example, I mean, you know. Prefaces
(PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving func-
tions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think

375



that...). Extreme case formulations (ECF) are lexi-
cal patterns emphasizing extremeness (e.g., This is
the best book I have ever read). In the end, we man-
ually annotated 49 English shows. We preprocessed
English manual transcripts by removing transcriber
annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation
and case information, and conducting text normal-
ization. We also built automatic rule-based and sta-
tistical annotation tools for these LUCs.

3 Features and Model

We explored lexical, structural, durational, and
prosodic features for (dis)agreement detection. We
included a set of “lexical” features, including n-
grams extracted from all of that speaker’s utter-
ances, denoted ngram features. Other lexical fea-
tures include the presence of negation and acquies-
cence, yes/no equivalents, positive and negative tag
questions, and other features distinguishing differ-
ent types of initiating utterances and responses. We
also included various lexical features extracted from
LUC annotations, denoted LUC features. These ad-
ditional features include features related to the pres-
ence of prefaces, the counts of types and tokens
of discourse markers, extreme case formulations,
disfluencies, person addressing events, and person
mentions, and the normalized values of these counts
by sentence length. We also include a set of features
related to the DAT of the current utterance and pre-
ceding and following utterances.

We developed a set of “structural” and “dura-
tional” features, inspired by conversation analysis,
to quantitatively represent the different participation
and interaction patterns of speakers in a show. We
extracted features related to pausing and overlaps
between consecutive turns, the absolute and relative
duration of consecutive turns, and so on.

We used a set of prosodic features including
pause, duration, and the speech rate of a speaker. We
also used pitch and energy of the voice. Prosodic
features were computed on words and phonetic
alignment of manual transcripts. Features are com-
puted for the beginning and ending words of an ut-
terance. For the duration features, we used the aver-
age and maximum vowel duration from forced align-
ment, both unnormalized and normalized for vowel
identity and phone context. For pitch and energy, we

calculated the minimum, maximum, range, mean,
standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis values. A
decision tree model was used to compute posteriors
from prosodic features and we used cumulative bin-
ning of posteriors as final features , similar to (Liu et
al., 2006).

As illustrated in Section 2, we reformulated the
(dis)agreement detection task as a sequence tagging
problem. We used the Mallet package (McCallum,
2002) to implement the linear chain CRF model for
sequence tagging. A CRF is an undirected graph-
ical model that defines a global log-linear distribu-
tion of the state (or label) sequence E conditioned
on an observation sequence, in our case including
the sequence of sentences S and the corresponding
sequence of features for this sequence of sentencesF . The model is optimized globally over the en-
tire sequence. The CRF model is trained to maxi-
mize the conditional log-likelihood of a given train-
ing set P (EjS; F ). During testing, the most likely
sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm.
One of the motivations of choosing conditional ran-
dom fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found
in hidden Markov models. Compared to Maxi-
mum Entropy modeling, the CRF model is opti-
mized globally over the entire sequence, whereas the
ME model makes a decision at each point individu-
ally without considering the context event informa-
tion.

4 Experiments

All (dis)agreement detection results are based on n-
fold cross-validation. In this procedure, we held
out one show as the test set, randomly held out an-
other show as the dev set, trained models on the
rest of the data, and tested the model on the held-
out show. We iterated through all shows and com-
puted the overall accuracy. Table 1 shows the re-
sults of (dis)agreement detection using all features
except prosodic features. We compared two condi-
tions: (1) features extracted completely from the au-
tomatic LUC annotations and automatically detected
speaker roles, and (2) features from manual speaker
role labels and manual LUC annotations when man-
ual annotations are available. Table 1 showed that
running a fully automatic system to generate auto-
matic annotations and automatic speaker roles pro-

376



duced comparable performance to the system using
features from manual annotations whenever avail-
able.

Table 1: Precision (%), recall (%), and F1 (%) of
(dis)agreement detection using features extracted from
manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annota-
tions when available, denoted Manual Annotation, and
automatic LUC annotations and automatically detected
speaker roles, denoted Automatic Annotation.

Agreement
P R F1

Manual Annotation 81.5 43.2 56.5
Automatic Annotation 79.5 44.6 57.1

Disagreement
P R F1

Manual Annotation 70.1 38.5 49.7
Automatic Annotation 64.3 36.6 46.6

We then focused on the condition of using fea-
tures from manual annotations when available and
added prosodic features as described in Section 3.
The results are shown in Table 2. Adding prosodic
features produced a 0.7% absolute gain on F1 on
agreement detection, and 1.5% absolute gain on F1
on disagreement detection.

(dis)agreement detection using manual annotations with-
out and with prosodic features.

Disagreement

with prosodic 70.8 40.1 51.2

Note that only about 10% utterances among all
data are involved in (dis)agreement. This indicates
a highly imbalanced data set as one class is more
heavily represented than the other/others. We sus-
pected that this high imbalance has played a ma-
jor role in the high precision and low recall results
we obtained so far. Various approaches have been
studied to handle imbalanced data for classifications,

trying to balance the class distribution in the train-
ing set by either oversampling the minority class or
downsampling the majority class. In this prelimi-
nary study of sampling approaches for handling im-
balanced data for CRF training, we investigated two
approaches, random downsampling and ensemble
downsampling. Random downsampling randomly
downsamples the majority class to equate the num-
ber of minority and majority class samples. Ensem-
ble downsampling is a refinement of random down-
sampling which doesn’t discard any majority class
samples. Instead, we partitioned the majority class
samples into N subspaces with each subspace con-
taining the same number of samples as the minority
class. Then we train N CRF models, each based
on the minority class samples and one disjoint parti-
tion from the N subspaces. During testing, the pos-
terior probability for one utterance is averaged over
the N CRF models. The results from these two sam-
pling approaches as well as the baseline are shown
in Table 3. Both sampling approaches achieved sig-
nificant improvement over the baseline, i.e., train-
ing on the original data set, and ensemble downsam-
pling produced better performance than downsam-
pling. We noticed that both sampling approaches
degraded slightly in precision but improved signif-
icantly in recall, resulting in 4.5% absolute gain on
F1 for agreement detection and 4.7% absolute gain
on F1 for disagreement detection.

(dis)agreement detection without sampling, with random

In conclusion, this paper presents our work on
detection of agreements and disagreements in En-

377



glish broadcast conversation data. We explored a
variety of features, including lexical, structural, du-
rational, and prosodic features. We experimented
these features using a linear-chain conditional ran-
dom fields model and conducted supervised train-
ing. We observed significant improvement from
adding prosodic features and employing two sam-
pling approaches, random downsampling and en-
semble downsampling. Overall, we achieved 79.2%
(precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agree-
ment detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (re-
call), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on
English broadcast conversation data. In future work,
we plan to continue adding and refining features, ex-
plore dependencies between features and contextual
cues with respect to agreements and disagreements,
and investigate the efficacy of other machine learn-
ing approaches such as Bayesian networks and Sup-
port Vector Machines.
