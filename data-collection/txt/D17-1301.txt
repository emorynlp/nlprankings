Abstract

In translation, considering the document
as a whole can help to resolve ambiguities
and inconsistencies. In this paper, we pro-
pose a cross-sentence context-aware ap-
proach and investigate the influence of his-
torical contextual information on the per-
formance of neural machine translation
(NMT). First, this history is summarized
in a hierarchical way. We then integrate
the historical representation into NMT in
two strategies: 1) a warm-start of en-
coder and decoder states, and 2) an aux-
iliary context source for updating decoder
states. Experimental results on a large
Chinese-English translation task show that
our approach significantly improves upon
a strong attention-based NMT system by
up to +2.1 BLEU points.

1 Introduction

Neural machine translation (NMT) has been
rapidly developed in recent years (Kalchbrenner
and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bah-
danau et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2016). The encoder-
decoder architecture is widely employed, in which
the encoder summarizes the source sentence into
a vector representation, and the decoder generates
the target sentence word by word from the vector
representation. Using the encoder-decoder frame-
work as well as gating and attention techniques,
it has been shown that the performance of NMT
has surpassed the performance of traditional sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) on various lan-
guage pairs (Luong et al., 2015).

The continuous vector representation of a sym-
bol encodes multiple dimensions of similarity,
equivalent to encoding more than one meaning of

a word. Consequently, NMT needs to spend a
substantial amount of its capacity in disambiguat-
ing source and target words based on the context
defined by a source sentence (Choi et al., 2016).
Consistency is another critical issue in document-
level translation, where a repeated term should
keep the same translation throughout the whole
document (Xiao et al., 2011; Carpuat and Simard,
2012). Nevertheless, current NMT models still
process a documents by translating each sentence
alone, suffering from inconsistency and ambigu-
ity arising from a single source sentence. These
problems are difficult to alleviate using only lim-
ited intra-sentence context.

The cross-sentence context, or global context,
has proven helpful to better capture the meaning
or intention in sequential tasks such as query sug-
gestion (Sordoni et al., 2015) and dialogue model-
ing (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016).
The leverage of global context for NMT, how-
ever, has received relatively little attention from
the research community.1 In this paper, we pro-
pose a cross-sentence context-aware NMT model,
which considers the influence of previous source
sentences in the same document.2

Specifically, we employ a hierarchy of Recur-
rent Neural Networks (RNNs) to summarize the
cross-sentence context from source-side previous
sentences, which deploys an additional document-
level RNN on top of the sentence-level RNN en-
coder (Sordoni et al., 2015). After obtaining the
global context, we design several strategies to inte-
grate it into NMT to translate the current sentence:

• Initialization, that uses the history represen-

(2017) are two independently early attempts to model cross-
sentence context for NMT.

history inversely harms translation performance, since it suf-
fers from serious error propagation problems.

tation as the initial state of the encoder, de-
coder, or both;

• Auxiliary Context, that uses the history rep-
resentation as static cross-sentence context,
which works together with the dynamic intra-
sentence context produced by an attention
model, to good effect.

• Gating Auxiliary Context, that adds a gate to
Auxiliary Context, which decides the amount
of global context used in generating the next
target word at each step of decoding.

Experimental results show that the proposed ini-
tialization and auxiliary context (w/ or w/o gat-
ing) mechanisms significantly improve translation
performance individually, and combining them
achieves further improvement.

2 Approach

Given a source sentence xm to be translated,
we consider its K previous sentences in the
same document as cross-sentence context C =
{xm−K , ...,xm−1}. In this section, we first model
C, which is then integrated into NMT.

archical RNN (xk is the k-th source sentence).

2.1 Summarizing Global Context
As shown in Figure 1, we summarize the represen-
tation of C in a hierarchical way:

Sentence RNN For a sentence xk in C, the
sentence RNN reads the corresponding words
{x1,k, ..., xn,k, . . . , xN,k} sequentially and up-
dates its hidden state:

hn,k = f(hn−1,k, xn,k) (1)

where f(·) is an activation function, and hn,k is the
hidden state at time n. The last state hN,k stores
order-sensitive information about all the words in
xk, which is used to represent the summary of the
whole sentence, i.e. Sk ≡ hN,k. After processing

each sentence in C, we can obtain all sentence-
level representations, which will be fed into docu-
ment RNN.

Document RNN It takes as input the se-
quence of the above sentence-level representations
{S1, ..., Sk, ..., SK} and computes the hidden state
as:

hk = f(hk−1, Sk) (2)

where hk is the recurrent state at time k, which
summarizes the previous sentences that have been
processed to the position k. Similarly, we use the
last hidden state to represent the summary of the
global context, i.e. D ≡ hK .
2.2 Integrating Global Context into NMT

We propose three strategies to integrate the history
representation D into NMT:

Initialization We useD to initialize either NMT
encoder, NMT decoder or both. For encoder, we
useD as the initialization state rather than all-zero
states as in the standard NMT (Bahdanau et al.,
2015). For decoder, we rewrite the calculation
of the initial hidden state s0 = tanh(WshN ) as
s0 = tanh(WshN +WDD) where hN is the last
hidden state in encoder and {Ws,WD} are the cor-
responding weight metrices.

Auxiliary Context In standard NMT, as shown
in Figure 2 (a), the decoder hidden state for time i
is computed by

si = f(si−1, yi−1, ci) (3)

where yi−1 is the most recently generated target
word, and ci is the intra-sentence context sum-
marized by NMT encoder for time i. As shown
in Figure 2 (b), Auxiliary Context method adds
the representation of cross-sentence context D to
jointly update the decoding state si:

si = f(si−1, yi−1, ci, D) (4)

In this strategy, D serves as an auxiliary informa-
tion source to better capture the meaning of the
source sentence. Now the gated NMT decoder has
four inputs rather than the original three ones. The
concatenation [ci, D], which embeds both intra-
and cross-sentence contexts, can be fed to the de-
coder as a single representation. We only need
to modify the size of the corresponding parame-
ter matrix for least modification effort.

tion, and σ is a sigmoid function.

Gating Auxiliary Context The starting point
for this strategy is an observation: the need
for information from the global context differs
from step to step during generation of the target
words. For example, global context is more in de-
mand when generating target words for ambiguous
source words, while less by others. To this end, we
extend auxiliary context strategy by introducing a
context gate (Tu et al., 2017a) to dynamically con-
trol the amount of information flowing from the
auxiliary global context at each decoding step, as
shown in Figure 2 (c).

Intuitively, at each decoding step i, the context
gate looks at decoding environment (i.e., si, yi−1,
and ci), and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for
each element in D, where 1 denotes “completely
transferring this” while 0 denotes “completely ig-
noring this”. The global context vector D is then
processed with an element-wise multiplication be-
fore being fed to the decoder activation layer.

Formally, the context gate consists of a sigmoid
neural network layer and an element-wise mul-
tiplication operation. It assigns an element-wise
weight to D, computed by

zi = σ(Uzsi−1 +Wzyi−1 + Czci) (5)

Here σ(·) is a logistic sigmoid function, and
{Wz, Uz, Cz} are the weight matrices, which are
trained to learn when to exploit global context
to maximize the overall translation performance.
Note that zi has the same dimensionality asD, and
thus each element in the global context vector has
its own weight. Accordingly, the decoder hidden
state is updated by

si = f(si−1, yi−1, ci, zi ⊗D) (6)

3 Experiments

3.1 Setup

We carried out experiments on Chinese–English
translation task. As the document information is
necessary when selecting the previous sentences,
we collect all LDC corpora that contain document
boundary. The training corpus consists of 1M
sentence pairs extracted from LDC corpora3 with
25.4M Chinese words and 32.4M English words.
We chose the NIST05 (MT05) as our development
set, and NIST06 (MT06) and NIST08 (MT08) as
test sets. We used case-insensitive BLEU score
(Papineni et al., 2002) as our evaluation metric,
and sign-test (Collins et al., 2005) for calculating
statistical significance.

We implemented our approach on top of an
open source attention-based NMT model, Nema-
tus4 (Sennrich and Haddow, 2016; Sennrich et al.,
2017). We limited the source and target vocab-
ularies to the most frequent 35K words in Chi-
nese and English, covering approximately 97.1%
and 99.4% of the data in the two languages re-
spectively. We trained each model on sentences
of length up to 80 words in the training data with
early stopping. The word embedding dimension
was 600, the hidden layer size was 1000, and the
batch size was 80. All our models considered the
previous three sentences (i.e., K = 3) as cross-
sentence context.

3.2 Results

Table 1 shows the translation performance in terms
of BLEU score. Clearly, the proposed approaches
significantly outperforms baseline in all cases.

Baseline (Rows 1-2) NEMATUS significantly
outperforms Moses – a commonly used phrase-
based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007), by 2.3
BLEU points on average, indicating that it is a
strong NMT baseline system. It is consistent with
the results in (Tu et al., 2017b) (i.e., 26.93 vs.
29.41) on training corpora of similar scale.

Initialization Strategy (Rows 3-5) Initenc and
Initdec improve translation performance by around
+1.0 and +1.3 BLEU points individually, prov-
ing the effectiveness of warm-start with cross-
sentence context. Combining them achieves a fur-
ther improvement.

Auxiliary Context Strategies (Rows 6-7) The
gating auxiliary context strategy achieves a sig-
nificant improvement of around +1.0 BLEU point
over its non-gating counterpart. This shows that,
by acting as a critic, the introduced context gate
learns to distinguish the different needs of the
global context for generating target words.

Combining (Row 8) Finally, we combine the
best variants from the initialization and auxiliary
context strategies, and achieve the best perfor-
mance, improving upon NEMATUS by +2.1 BLEU
points. This indicates the two types of strategies
are complementary to each other.

3.3 Analysis

We first investigate to what extent the mis-
translated errors are fixed by the proposed system.

We randomly select 15 documents (about 60 sen-
tences) from the test sets. As shown in Table 2,
we count how many related errors: i) are made by
NMT (Total), and ii) fixed by our method (Fixed);
as well as iii) newly generated (New). About
Ambiguity, while we found that 38 words/phrases
were translated into incorrect equivalents, 76% of
them are corrected by our model. Similarly, we
solved 75% of the Inconsistency errors including
lexical, tense and definiteness (definite or indefi-
nite articles) cases. However, we also observe that
our system brings relative 21% new errors.

Fixed 29 24 53
New 7 8 15

Case Study Table 3 shows an example. The
word “腐官” (corrupt officials) is mis-translated
as “enemy” by the baseline system. With the help

of the similar word “贪官” in the previous sen-
tence, our approach successfully correct this mis-
take. This demonstrates that cross-sentence con-
text indeed helps resolve certain ambiguities.

4 Related Work

While our approach is built on top of hierarchi-
cal recurrent encoder-decoder (HRED) (Sordoni
et al., 2015), there are several key differences
which reflect how we have generalized from the
original model. Sordoni et al. (2015) use HRED to
summarize a single representation from both the
current and previous sentences, which limits it-
self to (1) it is only applicable to encoder-decoder
framework without attention model, (2) the rep-
resentation can only be used to initialize decoder.
In contrast, we use HRED to summarize the pre-
vious sentences alone, which provides additional
cross-sentence context for NMT. Our approach is
more flexible at (1) it is applicable to any encoder-
decoder frameworks (e.g., with attention), (2) the
cross-sentence context can be used to initialize ei-
ther encoder, decoder or both.

While both our approach and Serban et al.
(2016) use Auxiliary Context mechanism for in-
corporating cross-sentence context, there are two
main differences: 1) we have separate parameters
to better control the effects of the cross- and intra-
sentence contexts, while they only have one pa-
rameter matrix to manage the single representa-
tion that encodes both contexts; 2) based on the
intuition that not every target word generation re-
quires equivalent cross-sentence context, we intro-
duce a context gate (Tu et al., 2017a) to control the
amount of information from it, while they don’t.

At the same time, some researchers propose to
use an additional set of an encoder and attention
to model more information. For example, Jean
et al. (2017) use it to encode and select part of
the previous source sentence for generating each
target word. Calixto et al. (2017) utilize global
image features extracted using a pre-trained con-
volutional neural network and incorporate them in
NMT. As additional attention leads to more com-
putational cost, they can only incorporate limited
information such as single preceding sentence in
Jean et al. (2017). However, our architecture is
free to this limitation, thus we use multiple pre-
ceding sentences (e.g. K = 3) in our experiments.

Our work is also related to multi-source (Zoph
and Knight, 2016) and multi-target NMT (Dong

et al., 2015), which incorporate additional source
or target languages. They investigate one-to-
many or many-to-one languages translation tasks
by integrating additional encoders or decoders
into encoder-decoder framework, and their exper-
iments show promising results.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We proposed two complementary approaches to
integrating cross-sentence context: 1) a warm-
start of encoder and decoder with global con-
text representation, and 2) cross-sentence context
serves as an auxiliary information source for up-
dating decoder states, in which an introduced con-
text gate plays an important role. We quantita-
tively and qualitatively demonstrated that the pre-
sented model significantly outperforms a strong
attention-based NMT baseline system. We release
the code for these experiments at https://
www.github.com/tuzhaopeng/LC-NMT.

Our models benefit from larger contexts, and
would be possibly further enhanced by other doc-
ument level information, such as discourse rela-
tions. We propose to study such models for full
length documents with more linguistic features in
future work.
