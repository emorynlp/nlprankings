Abstract

This paper describes the NILC USP system
that participated in SemEval-2013 Task 2:
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Our system
adopts a hybrid classification process that
uses three classification approaches: rule-
based, lexicon-based and machine learning
approaches. We suggest a pipeline architec-
ture that extracts the best characteristics from
each classifier. Our system achieved an F-
score of 56.31% in the Twitter message-level
subtask.

1 Introduction

Twitter and Twitter messages (tweets) are a modern
way to express sentiment and feelings about aspects
of the world. In this scenario, understanding the sen-
timent contained in a message is of vital importance
in order to understand users behavior and for mar-
ket analysis (Java et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2010).
The research area that deals with the computational
treatment of opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in
texts is called sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002).

Sentiment analysis is usually associated with a
text classification task. Sentiment classifiers are
commonly categorized in two basic approaches:
lexicon-based and machine learning (Taboada et al.,
2011). A lexicon-based classifier uses a lexicon to
provide the polarity, or semantic orientation, of each
word or phrase in the text. A machine learning clas-
sifier learns features (usually the vocabulary) from
annotated corpus or labeled examples.

In this paper, we present a hybrid system for senti-
ment classification in Twitter messages. Our system

combines three different approaches: rule-based,
lexicon-based and machine learning. The purpose of
our system is to better understand the use of a hybrid
system in Twitter text and to verify the performance
of this approach in an open evaluation contest.

Our system participated in SemEval-2013 Task
2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al.,
2013). The task objective was to determine the sen-
timent contained in Twitter messages. The task in-
cluded two sub-tasks: a expression-level classifi-
cation (Task A) and a message-level classification
(Task B). Our system participated in Task B. In this
task, for a given message, our system should classify
it as positive, negative, or neutral.

Our system was coded using Python and the
CLiPS Pattern library (De Smedt and Daelemans,
2012). This last library provides the part-of-speech
tagger and the SVM algorithm used in this work1.

2 Related work

Despite the significant number of works in senti-
ment analysis, few works have approached Twit-
ter messages. Agarwal et al. (2011) explored new
features for sentiment classification of twitter mes-
sages. Davidov et al. (2010) studied the use of
hashtags and emoticons in sentiment classification.
Diakopoulos and Shamma (2010) analyzed the peo-
ple’s sentiment on Twitter for first U.S. presidential
debate in 2008.

The majority of works in sentiment analysis uses
either machine learning techniques or lexicon-based

techniques. However, some few works have pre-
sented hybrid approaches. König and Brill (2006)
propose a hybrid classifier that utilizes human rea-
soning over automatically discovered text patterns to
complement machine learning. Prabowo and Thel-
wall (2009) evaluates the effectiveness of different
classifiers. This study showed that the use of multi-
ple classifiers in a hybrid manner could improve the
effectiveness of sentiment analysis.

3 System architecture

Our system is organized in four main components:
normalization, rule-based classifier, lexicon-based
classifier and machine learning classifier. These
components are connected in a pipeline architecture
that extracts the best characteristics from each com-
ponent. The Figure 1 shows the system architecture.

Figure 1: System architecture

In this pipeline architecture, each classifier, in a
sequential order, evaluates the Twitter message. In
each step, the classifier may determine the polarity
class of the message if a certain degree of confidence
is achieved. If the classifier may not achieve this
confidence threshold, the classifier in the next step
is called. The machine learning classifier is the last
step in the process. It is responsible to determine the
polarity if the previous classifiers failed to achieve
the confidence level required to classification. The
normalization component is responsible to correct
and normalize the text before the classifiers use it.

This architecture improves the classification pro-
cess because it takes advantage of the multiple ap-
proaches. For example, the rule-based classifier is
the most reliable classifier. It achieves good results
when the text is matched by a high-confidence rule.
However, due the freedom of language, rules may
not match 100% of the unseen examples, conse-
quently it has a low recall rate.

Lexicon-based classifiers, for example, are very
confident in the process to determine if a text is polar
or neutral. Using sentiment lexicons, we can deter-
mine that sentences containing sentiment words are
polar and sentences that do not contain such words
are neutral. Moreover, the presence of a high num-
ber of positive or negative words in the text may be
a strong indicative of the polarity.

Finally, machine learning is known to be highly
domain adaptive and to be able to find deep corre-
lations (Taboada et al., 2011). This last classifier
might provide the final decision when the previous
methods failed. In the following sub-sections, we
describe in more details the components in which
our system is based on. In the next section, we ex-
plain how the confidence level was determined.

3.1 Normalization and rule-based classifier

The normalization module is in charge of correcting
and normalizing the texts. This module performs the
following operations:

• Elements such as hashtags, urls and mentions
are transformed into a consistent set of codes;

• Emoticons are grouped into representative
categories (such as happy, sad, laugh) and con-
verted to particular codes;

• Signals of exaltation (such as repetitive excla-
mation marks) are recognized;

• A simple misspelling correction is performed;

• Part-of-speech tagging is performed.

The rule-based classifier is very simple. The only
rules applied here are concerned to the emoticons
found in the text. Empirically, we evidenced that
positive emoticons are an important indicative of
positiveness in texts. Likewise, negative emoticons

569



indicate negativeness tendency. This module re-
turns the number of positive and negative emoticons
matched in the text.

3.2 Lexicon-based classifier

The lexicon-based classifier is based on the idea that
the polarity of a text can be summarized by the sum
of the individual polarity values of each word or
phrase present in the text. In this assumption, a
sentiment lexicon identifies polar words and assigns
polarity values to them (known as semantic orienta-
tions).

In our system, we used the sentiment lexicon pro-
vided by SentiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2010). This
lexicon provides an emotion vocabulary, an emoti-
cons list, a negation list and a booster word list.

In our algorithm, we sum the semantic orienta-
tions of each individual word in the text. If the word
is negated, the polarity is inverted. If the word is in-
tensified (boosted), we increase its polarity by a fac-
tor determined in the sentiment lexicon. A lexicon-
based classifier usually assumes the signal of the fi-
nal score as the sentiment class: positive, negative
or neutral (score zero).

3.3 Machine learning classifier

The machine learning classifier uses labeled exam-
ples to learn how to classify new instances. The
algorithm learns by using features extracted from
these examples. In our classifier, we used the SVM
algorithm provided by CLiPS Pattern. The features
used by the classifier are bag-of-words, the part-of-
speech set, and the existence of negation in the sen-
tence.

4 Hybrid approach and tuning

The organization from SemEval-2013 Task 2: Senti-
ment Analysis in Twitter provided three datasets for
the task (Wilson et al., 2013). A training dataset
(TrainSet), with 6,686 messages2, a development
dataset (DevSet), with 1,654 messages, and two test-
ing datasets (TestSets), with 3,813 (Twitter TestSet)
and 2,094 (SMS TestSet) messages each.

As we said in the previous section, our system is
a pipeline of classifiers where each classifier may

2The number of messages may differ from other participants

assign a sentiment class if it achieves a particular
confidence threshold. This confidence threshold is a
fixed value we set for each system in order to have
a decision boundary. This decision was made by in-
specting the results table obtained with the develop-
ment set, as shown below.

Table 1 shows how the rule-based classifier per-
formed in the development dataset. The classifier
score consists in the difference between the num-
ber of positive emoticons and the number of nega-
tive emoticons found in the message. For example,
for score of -1 we had 22 negative, 4 neutral and 2
positive messages.

Table 1: Correlation between the rule-based classifier
scores and the gold standard classes in the DevSet

classifier score Negative Neutral Positive

-1 22 4 2
0 311 708 496
1 7 24 71
2 2 4

3 to 6 1 2

Inspecting the Table 1 we adjusted the rule-based
classifier boundary to decide when the score is dif-
ferent from zero. For values greater than zero, the
classifier will assign the positive class and, for val-
ues below zero, the classifier will assign the negative
class. For values equal zero, the classifier will call
the lexicon-based classifier.

Table 2 is similar to the Table 1, but it now shows
the scores obtained by the lexicon-based classifier
for the development set. This score is the message
semantic orientation computed by the sum of the se-
mantic orientation for each individual word.

Inspecting Table 2, we adjusted the lexicon-based
classifier to assign the positive class when the total
score is greater than 3 and negative class when the
total score is below -3. Moreover, we evidenced that,
compared to the other classifiers, the lexicon-based
classifier had better performance to determine the
neutral class. Therefore, we adjusted the lexicon-
based classifier to assign the neutral class when the
total score is zero. For any other values, the machine
learning classifier is called.

Finally, Table 3 shows the confusion matrix for
the machine learning classifier in the development

dataset. The machine learning classifier does not
operate with a confidence threshold, so no decisions
were made for this classifier. We see that machine
learning classifier does not have a good accuracy
in general. Our hybrid approach proposed aims to
overcome this problem. Next section shows the re-
sults achieved for the Semeval test dataset.

5 Results

Table 4 shows the results obtained by each individ-
ual classifier and the hybrid classifier for the test
dataset. In the task, the systems were evaluated with
the average F-Score obtained for positive and nega-
tive classes3. We see that the Hybrid approach could
improve in relation to each classifier score, confirm-
ing our hypothesis.

pares the systems by the average F-score for positive and nega-
tive classes. For more information see Wilson et al. (2013)

sifier in the Twitter dataset. Inspecting our algo-
rithm for the Twitter dataset, we had 277 examples
classified by the rule-based classifier, 2,312 by the
lexicon-based classifier and 1,224 the by machine
learning classifier. The results for the SMS dataset
had similar values.

6 Conclusion

We described a hybrid classification system used for
Semeval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twit-
ter. This paper showed how a hybrid classifier might
take advantage of multiple sentiment analysis ap-
proaches and how these approaches perform in a
Twitter dataset.

A future direction of this work would be im-
proving each individual classifier. In our system,
we used simple methods for each employed classi-
fier. Thus, we believe the hybrid classification tech-
nique applied might achieve even better results. This
strengthens our theory that hybrid techniques might
outperform the current state-of-art in sentiment anal-
ysis.
