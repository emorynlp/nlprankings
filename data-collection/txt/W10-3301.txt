Abstract

This  document  describes  an  open 
text-mining  system  that  was  developed 
for the Asian-European project KYOTO. 
The  KYOTO system uses  an  open text 
representation format and a central onto-
logy to  enable  extraction  of  knowledge 
and facts  from large volumes of text  in 
many different languages. We implemen-
ted a semantic tagging approach that per-
forms off-line reasoning. Mining of facts 
and  knowledge  is  achieved  through  a 
flexible pattern matching module that can 
work in much the same way for different 
languages,  can  handle  efficiently  large 
volumes of documents and is not restric-
ted to a specific domain. We applied the 
system to an English database on estuar-
ies.

1 Introduction

Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) is the 
task of filling template information from previ-
ously unseen text which belongs to a predefined 
domain (Peshkin & Pfeffer 2003). Most systems 
in  the  Message  Understanding  Conferences 
(MUC,  1987-1998)  and the  Automatic  Content 
Extraction  program  (ACE)1 use  a  pipeline  of 
tools to achieve this, ranging from sophisticated 
NLP tools (like deep parsing) to shallower text-
processing (e.g. FASTUS (Appelt 1995)).

Standard  IE  systems  are  based  on  lan-
guage-specific  pattern  matching  (Kaiser  & 

1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace  

Miksch 2005), where each pattern consists of a 
regular  expression  and  an  associated  mapping 
from syntactic to logical form. In general, the ap-
proaches can be categorized into two groups: (1) 
the Knowledge Engineering approach (Appelt et 
al.1995), and (2) the learning approach, such as 
AutoSlog  (Appelt  et  al.  1993),  SRV  (Freitag 
1998), or RAPIER (Califf & R. Mooney 1999). 
Another  important  system  is  GATE (Cunning-
ham et al.2002), which is a platform for creating 
IE systems. It uses regular expressions, but it can 
also  use  ontologies  to  perform semantic  infer-
ences  to  constrain  linguistic  patterns  semantic-
ally. The use of ontologies in IE is an emerging 
field (Bontcheva & Wilks 2004): linking text in-
stances with elements belonging to the ontology, 
instead of consulting flat gazetteers.

The major disadvantage of traditional IE sys-
tems is that they focus on satisfying precise, nar-
row, pre-specified requests from small homogen-
eous corpora (e.g., extract information about ter-
rorist events). Likewise, they are not flexible, are 
limited to specific types of knowledge and need 
to be built by knowledge engineers for each spe-
cific application and language. In fact most text 
mining  systems are  developed for  a  single  do-
main and a single language, and are not able to 
handle  knowledge  expressed  in  different  lan-
guages  or  expressed  and conceptualized  differ-
ently across cultures.

In this paper we describe an open platform for 
text-mining  or  IE that  can  be applied  to many 
different  languages  in  the  same  way  using  an 
open text representation system and a central on-

1



tology that  is  shared across  languages.  Ontolo-
gical implications are inserted in the text through 
off-line  reasoning and ontological  tagging.  The 
events and facts are extracted from large amounts 
of text using a flexible pattern-matching module, 
as specified by profiles  which comprise  ontolo-
gical and shallow linguistic patterns. The system 
is  developed  in  the  Asian-European  project 
KYOTO2.

In the next section,  we describe the general 
architecture of the KYOTO system. In section 3, 
we specify the knowledge structure that is used. 
Section  4,  describes  the  off-line  reasoning  and 
ontological tagging. In section 5, we describe the 
module for mining knowledge from the text that 
is enriched with ontological  statements.  Finally 
in section 6, we describe the first results of ap-
plying the system to databases on Estuaries.

2 KYOTO overview

The  KYOTO  project  allows  communities  to 
model terms and concepts in their domain and to 
use this knowledge to apply text mining on docu-
ments. The knowledge cycle in the KYOTO sys-
tem starts  with a set  of  source  documents pro-
duced by the community, such as PDFs and web-
sites.  Linguistic  processors  apply  tokenization, 
segmentation, morpho-syntactic analysis and  se-
mantic  processing  to  the  text  in  different  lan-
guages. The semantic processing involves the de-
tection of named-entities (persons, organizations, 
places,  time-expressions)  and  determining  the 
meaning of  words  in  the  text  according to  the 
given wordnet.  

The  output  of  the  linguistic  processors is 
stored in an XML annotation format that  is the 
same for  all  the languages,  called  the KYOTO 
Annotation  Format  (KAF,  Bosma  et  al  2009). 
This format incorporates standardized proposals 
for the linguistic annotation of text and represents 
them in an easy-to-use layered structure, which is 
compatible with the Linguistic Annotation Frame-
work  (LAF,  Ide  and  Romary  2003).  In  KAF, 
words, terms, constituents and syntactic depend-
encies  are  stored  in  separate  layers  with  refer-
ences across the structures. This makes it easier 
to harmonize the output of  linguistic processors 

2 Http://www.kyoto-project.eu

for different languages and to add new semantic 
layers to the basic output, when needed (Bosma 
et al. 2009, Vossen et al. 2010). All modules in 
KYOTO draw their input from these structures. 
In fact, the word-sense disambiguation process is 
carried out to the same KAF annotation in differ-
ent languages and is therefore the same for all the 
languages (Agirre et al. 2009). In the current sys-
tem,  there  are  processors  for  English,  Dutch, 
Italian, Spanish, Basque, Chinese and Japanese.

The KYOTO system proceeds in 2 cycles (see 
Figure 1). In the 1st cycle, the Tybot (Term Yield-
ing Robot) extracts the most relevant terms from 
the documents. The Tybot is another generic pro-
gram that  can  do  this  for  all  the  different  lan-
guages in much the same way. The terms are or-
ganized as a structured hierarchy and, wherever 
possible,  related  to  generic  semantic  databases, 
i.e. wordnets for each language. In the left part of 
Figure 1, we show those terms in the input docu-
ment and their classification in wordnet. Terms in 
italics are present in the original wordnet, while 
underlined terms correspond to terms which were 
not in the original wordnet but were automatic-
ally discovered and linked to wordnet by Tybots. 
Straight  terms  correspond  to hyperonyms  in 
wordnet that do not necessarily occur in the text 
but are linked to ontological classes. The result of 
this  1st cycle  is a domain wordnet  for the target 
language.

The 2nd cycle of the system involves the actu-
al extraction of factual knowledge from the docu-
ments by the Kybots  (Knowledge Yielding Ro-
bots). Kybots use a collection of profiles that rep-
resent patterns of information of interest. In the 
profile, conceptual relations are expressed using 
ontological  and morpho-syntactic linguistic pat-
terns. Since the semantics is defined through the 
ontology,  it  is  possible  to  detect  similar  data 
across documents in different languages, even if 
expressed differently. In Figure 1, we give an ex-
ample of a conceptual pattern that relates organ-
isms that live in habitats. The Kybot can combine 
morpho-syntactic and semantic patterns. When a 
match is detected, the instantiation of the pattern 
is saved in a formal representation, either in KAF 
or in RDF. Since the wordnets in different lan-
guages are mapped to the same ontology and the 
text in these languages is represented in the same 
KAF,  similar  patterns  can  easily  be  applied  to 
multiple languages.

3 Ontological  and  lexical  background 
knowledge

As a semantic background model, we defined a 
3-layered  knowledge  architecture  following the 
principle  of  the  division  of  labour  (Putnam 
1975). In this model, the ontology does not need 
to be the central hub for all terms in a domain in 
all  languages.  Following the division  of labour 
principle, we can state that a computer does not 
need  to  distinguish  between  instances  of  a 
European Tree Frog and a Glass Tree frog. We 
assume  that  rigid  concepts  (as  defined  by 
Guarino and Welty 2002) are known to the do-
main experts and do not need to be defined form-
ally in the ontology but can remain in the avail-
able  background  resources,  such  as   databases 
with millions of species.  Terms in the documents 
are mostly non-rigid, e.g.  endangered frogs,  in-
vasive  frogs.  Such  non-rigid  terms  refer  to  in-
stances  of  species  in  contextual  circumstances. 
The processes and states are the important pieces 
of  information  that  matter  to the users  and are 
useful for mining text. The model therefore dis-
tinguishes between background vocabularies, do-
main terms,  wordnets and the central  ontology. 
The  background  vocabularies  are  automatically 
aligned  to  wordnet,  where  we  assume  that 
hyponymy relations to rigid synsets in wordnet 
declare those subconcepts as rigid subtypes too, 
without the necessity to include them in the onto-
logy.  For  non-rigid  terms,  we  defined  a  set  of 
mapping relations to the ontology through which 
we express their non-rigid involvement in these 

processes and states. Likewise, the ontology has 
been extended with processes and states for the 
domain  and  verbs  and  adjectives  have  been 
mapped to be able to detect expressions in text.

The  3-layered  knowledge  model  combines  the 
efforts from 3 different communities:

1.Domain  experts  in  social  communities  that 
continuously build background vocabularies;

2.Wordnet  specialists  that  define  the  basic  se-
mantic model for general concepts for a lan-
guage

3.Semantic Web specialists that define top-level 
and domain-specific ontologies that capture 
formal definitions of concepts;

We formalized the relations between these repos-
itories so that they can developed separately but 
combined within KYOTO to form a coherent and 
formal model.

3.1 Ontology

The KYOTO ontology currently consists of 1149 
classes divided over three layers. The top layer is 
based  on  DOLCE  (DOLCE-Lite-Plus  version 
3.9.7,  Masolo  et  al  2003)  and  OntoWordNet. 
This layer of the ontology has been modified for 
our purposes (Herold et. al. 2009).  The second 
layer consists of so-called Base Concepts (BCs) 
derived  from various  wordnets  (Vossen  1998, 
Izquierdo  et  al. 2007).  Examples  of  BCs  are: 
building,  vehicle,  animal,  plant,  change,  move,  
size, weight. The BCs are those synsets in Word-
Net 3.0 that have the most relations with other 
synsets in the wordnet hierarchies and are selec-
ted in a way that ensures complete coverage of 
the nominal and verbal part of WordNet. This has 
been  completed  for  the  nouns  (about  500 
synsets).  The ontology has also been adapted to 
include important concepts in the domain. Spe-
cial attention has been paid to represents the pro-
cesses  (perdurants)  in  which  objects  (endur-
ants)  of  the domain are  involved and qualities 
they may have. This is typically the information 
that is found in documents on the environment. 
We thus added 40 new event classes for repres-
enting  important  verbs  (e.g.  pollute, absorb, 
damage, drain) and 115 new qualities and qual-
ity-regions for representing important adjectives 
(e.g. airborne, acid, (un)healthy, clear). The full

ontology can be downloaded from the KYOTO 
website, free for use. A considerable set of gener-
al verbs and adjectives (relevant for for the do-
main)  have  then  been  mapped  to  ontological 
classes: 189  verbal  synsets  and  222  adjectival 
synsets.

The  500  nominal  BCs  are  connected  to  the 
complete  WordNet  hierarchy,  whereas  the  189 
verbs represent 5,978 more specific verbal syn-
sets and the 222 adjectives represent  1,081 ad-
jectival synsets through the wordnet relations.

This basic ontology and the mapping to Word-
Net  are  used  to  model  the  shared  and  lan-
guage-neutral  concepts  and  relations  in the do-
main. Instances are excluded from the ontology. 
Instances will be detected in the documents and 
will be mapped to the ontology through instance 
to ontology relations (see below).  Likewise, we 
make a clear separation between the ontological 
model and the instantiation of the model as de-
scribed in the text.

3.2 Wordnet to ontology mappings

In addition to the ontology, we have wordnets for 
each language in the domain. In addition to the 
regular synset to synset relations in the wordnet, 
we will have a specific set of relations for map-
ping the synsets  to the ontology,  which are  all 
prefixed with sc_ standing for synset-to-concept. 
We differentiate between rigid and non-rigid con-
cepts in the wordnets through the mapping rela-
tions:

• sc_equivalenceOf: the synset is fully equi-
valent to the ontology Type & inherits all proper-
ties; the synset is Rigid

• sc_  subclassOf: the synset is a proper sub-
class of the ontology Type & inherits all proper-
ties; the synset is Rigid

• sc_domainOf: the synset is not a proper sub-
class  of  the  ontology  Type  &  is  not  disjoint 
(therefore orthogonal) with other synsets that are 
mapped to the same Type either through sc_sub-
classOf or sc_domainOf; the synset is non-Rigid 
but still inherits all properties of the target onto-
logy Type;  the synset  is  also related to a Role 
with a sc_playRole relation

• sc_playRole:  the  synset  denotes  instances 
for  which  the  context  of  the  Role  applies  for 
some period of time but this is not essential for 
the existence of the instances, i.e. if the context 

ceases to exist then the instances may still exist 
(Mizoguchi et al. 2007).3

• sc_participantOf:  instances of the concept 
(denoted by the synset) participate in some en-
durant, where the specific role relation is indic-
ated by the playRole mapping. 

• sc_hasState: instances of the concept are in 
a particular state which is not essential and can 
be changed. There is no need to represent the role 
for a stative perdurant.

This model  extends  existing  WordNet  to  onto-
logy mappings.  For  instance,  in  the  SUMO to 
Wordnet mapping (Niles and Pease 2003), only 
the  sc_equivalenceOf and  sc_subclassOf rela-
tions  are  used,  represented  by  the symbols  ‘=’ 
and ‘+’ respectively. The SUMO-Wordnet map-
ping likewise does not systematically distinguish 
rigid from non-rigid  synsets.  In our  model,  we 
separate the linguistically and culturally specific 
vocabularies from the shared ontology while us-
ing the ontology  to interface  the concepts used 
by the various communities.

Using these mapping relations, we can express 
that the synset for  duck (which has a hypernym 
relation to the synset  bird, which, in its turn, has 
an  equivalence  relation  to  the  ontology  class 
bird) is  thus  a  proper  subclassOf  the  ontology 
class bird:

wn:duck hypernym wn:bird
wn:bird  sc_equivalenceOf ont:bird

For a concept such as migratory bird, which is 
also  a  hyponym  of  bird in  wordnet  but  not  a 
proper subclass as a non-rigid concept, we thus 
create the following mapping:

wn:migratory bird 
→ sc_domainOf ont:bird
→ sc_playRole ont:done-by
→ sc_participantOf ont:migration

This mapping indicates that the synset is used to 
refer to instances of endurants (not subclasses!), 
where the domain is restricted to birds. Further-
more, these instances participate in the process of 

3 Some terms involve more than one role,  e.g.  gas-
powered-vehicle.  Secondary  participants  are  related 
through  sc_hasCoParticipant and sc_playCoRole 
mappings.

migration in the role of  done-by. The properties 
of  the  process  migration are  further  defined  in 
the  ontology,  which  indicates  that  it  is  a  act-
ive-change-of-location  done-by  some  endurant, 
going from a source, via a path to some destina-
tion. The mapping relations from the wordnet to 
the ontology, need to satisfy the constraints of the 
ontology, i.e. only roles can be expressed that are 
compatible with the role-schema of the process 
in which they participate.

For  implied  non-essential  states,  we  use  the 
sc_hasState relation to express that a synset such 
as wild dog refers to instances of dogs that life in 
the wild but can stop being wild:

wn:wild dog → sc_domainOf ont:dog
wn:wild dog → sc_hasState ont:wild

Ideally, all processes and states that can be ap-
plied to endurants should be defined in the onto-
logy. This may hold for most verbs and adject-
ives in languages, which do not tend to extend in 
specific  domains  and  are  part  of  the  general 
vocabulary  (e.g.  to  pollute,  to  reduce,  wild). 
However, domain specific text contain many new 
nominal terms that refer to domain-specific pro-
cesses and states, e.g. air pollution, nitrogen pol-
lution,  nitrogen  reduction.  These  terms  are 
equally relevant as their counter-parts that refer 
to endurants involved in similar  processes, e.g. 
polluted air, polluting nitrogen or reduced nitro-
gen. We therefore use the reverse participant and 
role mappings to be able to define such terms for 
processes  as  subclasses  of  more  general  pro-
cesses  involving  specific  participants  in  a  spe-
cified role:

wn:air pollution
→ sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)
→ sc_hasParticipant ont:air
→ sc_hasRole ont:patient
wn:nitrogen pollution
→ sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)
→ sc_hasParticipant ont:nitrogen
→ sc_hasRole ont:done-by
 
Further  mapping  relations  are  described  in  the 
documentation on the KYOTO website. Through 
the mapping relations, we can keep the ontology 
relatively small and compact whereas we can still 
define  the  richness  of  the  vocabularies  of  lan-

guages in a precise way. The classes in the onto-
logy can be defined using rich axioms that model 
precise implications for inferencing. The wordnet 
to synset mappings can be used to define rather 
basic relations relative to the given ontology that 
still  captures  the  semantics  of  the  terms. The 
term definitions capture both relevance and per-
spective  (those  relations  that  matter  from  the 
point of the view of the term), on the one hand, 
and some semantics with respect to the concepts 
that are involved and their (role) relation on the 
other  hand.  Likewise,  the  KYOTO  system can 
model the linguistic and cultural diversity of lan-
guages in a domain but at the same time keep a 
firm anchoring to a basic and compact ontology.

3.3 Domain wordnet

We selected 3 representative documents on estu-
aries to extract relevant terms for the domain us-
ing the Tybot module. The terms have been re-
lated  through  structural  relations,  e.g.  nitrogen 
pollution is a hyponym of pollution, and through 
WordNet synsets that are assigned through WSD 
of the text.  We extracted 3950 candidate  terms 
form the KAF representations of the documents. 
Most of these are nouns (2818 terms). The nom-
inal  terms matched for 40% with wordnet syn-
sets, the verbs and adjectives for 98% and 85% 
respectively. For the domain wordnet, we restric-
ted ourselves to the nouns. From the new nomin-
al  terms,  environmentalists selected  390  terms 
that they deem to be important. These terms are 
connected to parent terms, which ultimately are 
connected to wordnet synsets.  The final domain 
wordnet contains 659 synsets: 197 synsets from 
the generic wordnet and 462 new synsets connec-
ted to the former.  The domain wordnet synsets 
got 990 mappings to the ontology, using the rela-
tions described in the previous section. There are 
86 synsets that have a sc_domainOf mapping, in-
dicating  that  they  are  non-rigid.  Note  that 
hyponyms of these synsets are also non-rigid by 
definition. These non-rigid synsets have complex 
mappings to processes and states in which  they 
are involved. The domain wordnet can be down-
loaded from the KYOTO website, free for use.

4 Off-line reasoning and ontological tag-
ging 

The ontological tagging represents the last phase 
in the KYOTO Linguistic  Processor  annotation 
pipeline.  It  consists  of  a three-step module  de-
vised to enrich the KAF documents with know-
ledge derived from the ontology. For each synset 
connected to a term, the first step   adds the Base 
Concepts to which the synset is related through 

the wordnet taxonomical relations. Then, through 
the synset to ontology mapping, it  adds the cor-
responding ontology type with appropriate rela-
tions. Once each synset is specified as to its onto-
logy type,  the  last  ontotagging  step  inserts  the 
full  set  of  ontological  implications  that  follow 
from the explicit ontology. The explicit ontology 
is a new data  structure consisting of a table with 
all  ontology nodes and all  ontological  implica-
tions expressed. The main purpose is to optimize

the performance of the mining module over large 
quantities of documents. The advantage for Ky-
bots from ontotagging are many. First of all, they 
are  able  to  run  and  apply  pattern-matching  to 
Base  Concepts  and  ontological  classes  rather 
than just to words or synsets. Moreover, by mak-
ing explicit  the  implicit  ontological  statements, 
Kybots are able to find the same relations hidden 
in  different  expressions  with  different  surface 
realizations:  fish migration,  migratory  fish,  mi-
gration of fish, fishes that migrate, that directly 
or indirectly express the same relations. With on-
totagging,  they  share  the  same ontological  im-
plications which will allow Kybots to apply the 
same patterns and perform the extraction of facts. 
The implications will be represented in the same 
way across different languages, thus facilitating 
cross-lingual extraction of facts. Lastly, ontotag-
ging is a kind of off-line ontological reasoning: 
without  doing reasoning over concepts,  Kybots 
substantially  improve their  performance.  Figure 
2 shows the result of onto-tagging for the term 
pollution.

5 Event and fact extraction

Kybots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are  com-
puter  programs  that  use  the  mined 
concepts and the generic  concepts  already con-
nected to the language wordnets and the KYOTO 
ontology to extract actual concept instances and 
relations in KAF documents. Kybots incorporate 
technology  for  the  extraction  of  relationships, 
either eventual or not, relative to the general or 
domain concepts already captured by the Tybots. 
That is, the extraction of factual knowledge is be-
ing carried out by the Kybot server by processing 
Kybot profiles on the linguistically enriched doc-

Kybots  are  defined  following  a  declarative 
format,  the  so  called  Kybot  
profiles, which describe general morpho-syntact-
ic  and  semantic  conditions  on  sequences  of 
terms. Profiles are compiled to generate the Ky-
bots, which scan over KAF documents searching 
for the patterns and extract the relevant informa-
tion from each matching.

Linguistic  patterns  include morphologic  con-
straints and also semantic conditions the matched 
terms must hold.  Kybot are thus able to search 
for term lemmas or part-of-speech tags but also 
for terms linked to ontological process and states 

using  the  mappings  described  in  Section  3.2. 
Thus, it is possible to detect similar eventual in-
formation  across  documents  in  different  lan-
guages, even if expressed differently.

5.1 Example of a Kybot Profile

Kybot Profiles are described using XML syn-
tax.  Figure 3 presents an example of a profile. 
Kybot profiles consist of three main parts: 
•Variable  declaration (<variables> element): 
In this section the search entities are defined. The 
example  defines  three  variables:  x (denoting 
terms  whose  part-of-speech is  noun),  y (which 
are  terms whose lemma is “release”, “produce” 
or  “generate”  but   not  “create”)  and  z (terms 
linked to  the  ontological  endurant  “DOLCE-L-
ite.owl#contamination_pollution”, meaning ``be-
ing contaminated with harmful  substances''). 
•Declarations  of  the  relations  among  variables 
(<rel> element): specify the relations among the 
previously  defined variables.  The example pro-
file specifies y  as the main pivot, and states that 
variable  x must  be  preceding  variable  y in  the 
same sentence, and that variable  z must be fol-
lowing variable  y.  Thus,  the Kybot will  search 
for patterns like 'x → y → z' in a sentence.
•Output template (<events> element): describes 
the output to be produced on every matching. In 
the example, each match generates a new event 
targeting term  y,  which becomes the main term 
of the event. It also fills two roles of the event, 
the 'agent' role filled by term x and 'patient' role, 
filled by z. 

Figure  4  presents  the  output  of  the  Kybot 
when applied against the benchmark documents.
The Kybot output follows the stand-off architec-
ture when producing new information, and it thus 
forms  a  new KAF layer  on  the  original  docu-
ments.

6 Experimental results

We applied the KYOTO system and resources to 
English documents on estuaries. We collected 50 
URLs for two English estuaries: the Humber Es-
tuary in Hull (UK) and the Chesapeake Bay estu-
ary in the US and for background documents on 
bird  migration,  sedimentation,  habitat  destruc-
tion,  and  climate  change.  In  addition  to  the 
webpages, we extracted 815 PDF files from the 
sites. In total, 4625 files have been extracted. All 

7



the documents have been processed by the lin-
guistic  processor  for  English,  which  generated 
KAF representations for all the documents. From 
this  database,  3  documents  were  selected  for 
benchmarking.

The  documents  were  processed  by  applying 
multiword  tagging,  word-sense-disambiguation, 
named-entity-recognition  and  the  ontological 
tagging to the 3 documents and to the complete 
database; This was done twice: once without the 
domain model and once with the domain model. 
We thus created 4 datasets:  3 benchmark docu-
ments  processed  with  and  without  the  domain 
model; the complete database processed with and 
without the domain model.

Furthermore, we created Kybot profiles based 
on the type of information represented in the do-
main model. We applied the Kybots to all 4 data 
sets. We generate the following data files through 
an WN-LMF export of the domain wordnet:

1. a set of domain multiwords for the multi-
word tagger

2. an extension of the lexicon and the graph 
of  concepts  that  is  used  by  the  WSD 
module

3. an extension of the wordnet-to-ontology 
mappings for the ontotagger

In addition, we constructed mapping lists for all 
WordNet 3.0 synsets to Base Concepts and to ad-
jective and verbs that are matched to the onto-
logy.  These mappings provide the generic  con-
ceptual model based on wordnet and on the onto-
logy. 

Table 1 shows the effects of using the domain 
model for the first 3 modules. We can see that the 
domain  model  has  a  clear  effect  on  the multi-
word  detection  in  the  3  evaluation  documents. 
Using the domain model,  600 multiwords have 
been detected, against 145 with just the generic 
wordnet. This is obvious since the terms are ex-
tracted  from  the  same  documents.  However, 

when applying it  to the complete  database,  we 
see that  still  over 2,300 more multiwords have 
been  detected  using  the domain wordnet.  Note 
that the domain wordnet has only 97 multiwords 
and the generic wordnet has 19,126 multiwords. 
So 0.5% of the multiwords in the domain word-
net add 1.5 times more multiword tokens in the 
database. The third row specifies the number of 
synsets that have been assigned. We can see that 
for the domain model almost 400 more synsets 
have been detected. In the case of the full estuary 
database, we see that relatively few more have 
been detected, almost 1,500 while the database is 
80 times as big. If we look more closely at the 
numbers of actual  domain synsets detected,  we 
see the following results. In the benchmark docu-
ments  637 (or 5%) of  the synsets  is  a  domain 
wordnet  synset,  whereas  5,353 synsets  are  do-
main synsets in the full estuary database, which 
is only 0.52%. Note that in KAF multiwords are 
represented both as a single terms and in terms of 
their elements. The WSD module assigns synsets 
to  both.  The  domain  model  can  thus  only  add 
synsets compared to the processing without the 
domain. 

Finally, if we look at the named-entity-recogni-
tion module, we see a slight negative effect for 
the detection of named-entities due to the domain 
model.  The  named-entity-recognition  module 
does not consider the elements of multiwords but 
just  the multiword terms as a whole. Grouping 
terms  as  multiwords  thus  leads  to  less  named-
entities being detected. This is not necessarily a 
bad things, since the detection heavily over-gen-
erates and could have now more precision.

Table 2 shows the effect of inserting ontologic-
al  implications  into  the  text  representation.For 
the benchmark documents, we see that more than 
half a million ontological implications have been 
inserted.  Of  these, 82% are implied references, 
that are extracted from the explicit ontology on 
the  basis  of  a  direct  mapping to  the  ontology. 
About  8% of  the  mappings  are  synset-to-onto-
logy mappings (sc) and 9.5% are mappings rep-
resenting the subclass hierarchy. The differences 
between using the domain model and not-using 
the domain model are minimal. For the complete 
database, the implications are 80 times as much 
but the proportions are similar.

Table 3 shows the type of sc-relations that oc-
cur.  Obviously,  sc_subClassOf  and  sc_equival-
entOf  are  the  most  frequent.  Nevertheless,  we 
still  find  about  500  mappings  that  present  the 
participation in a process or state.

42048  reftype="sc_subClassOf"

Table 3: Type of relations for the wordnet to ontology  
mappings using the domain model

The table clearly shows the impact of role rela-
tions  that  are  encoded  in  the  domain  wordnet. 
When  we  extract  the  mappings  for  the  files 
without the domain model (ony using the map-
pings to the generic wordnet), we get only equi-
valence and subclass mappings.

Finally to complete the knowledge cycle, we cre-
ated a few Kybot profiles for extracting events 
from the  onto-tagged  documents.  As  an  initial 
test, 3 profiles have been created:

1. events of destruction
2. destructions of locations
3. destruction of objects

Using  these  profiles,  we  extracted  211  events 
from the 3 benchmark documents with 396 roles. 
The profiles are created to run over the ontolo-
gical  types  inserted  by  the  ontotagger,  e.g.  re-
stricted to events and change_of_integrity.  Des-
pite the generality of the profiles, we still see a 
clear signature of the domain in the output. This 
is a good indication that we will be able to ex-
tract valuable events from the data, even though 
the  ontotagger  generates  a  massive  amount  of 
implications.  Especially  events  that  combine 
multiple  roles  appear  to  give  rich  information. 
For example, the following sentence:

"One of the greatest challenges to restoration is con-
tinued population growth and development, which 
destroys forests, wetlands and other natural areas"

yielded the following output:

   <event target="t1471" lemma="destroy" pos="V" 
eid="e74"/>
   <role target="t1477" rtype="patient" lemma="area" 
pos="N" event="e74" rid="r138"/>
   <role target="t1472" rtype="patient" 
lemma="forest" pos="N" event="e74" rid="r151"/>
   <role target="t1469" rtype="actor" lemma="devel-
opment" pos="N" event="e74" rid="r180"/>

Running the full set of profiles on the complete data-
base with almost 60 million ontological statements 
took about 2 hours. This shows that our approach is 
scalable and efficient.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, we described an open platform for 
text-mining  using wordnets  and a central  onto-
logy.  The  system  can  be  used  across  different 
languages and can be tailored to mine any type of 
conceptual relations. It can handle semantic im-
plications that are expressed in very different lin-
guistic expressions and yield systematic output. 
As future work, we will carry out benchmarking 
and testing of the mining of events, both for Eng-
lish and for the other languages in the KYOTO 
project.
