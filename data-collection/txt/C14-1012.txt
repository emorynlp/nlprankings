Abstract

Image retrieval models typically represent images as bags-of-terms, a representation that is well-
suited to matching images based on the presence or absence of terms. For some information
needs, such as searching for images of people performing actions, it may be useful to retain data
about how parts of an image relate to each other. If the underlying representation of an image
can distinguish between images where objects only co-occur from images where people are in-
teracting with objects, then it should be possible to improve retrieval performance. In this paper
we model the spatial relationships between image regions using Visual Dependency Represen-
tations, a structured image representation that makes it possible to distinguish between object
co-occurrence and interaction. In a query-by-example image retrieval experiment on data set
of people performing actions, we find an 8.8% relative increase in MAP and an 8.6% relative
increase in Precision@10 when images are represented using the Visual Dependency Represen-
tation compared to a bag-of-terms baseline.

1 Introduction

Every day millions of people search for images on the web, both professionally and for personal amuse-
ment. The majority of image searches are aimed at finding a particular named entity, such as Justin
Bieber or supernova, and a typical image retrieval system is well-suited to this type of information need
because it represents an image as a bag-of-terms drawn from data surrounding the image, such as text,
manual tags, and anchor text (Datta et al., 2008). It is not always possible to find useful terms in the sur-
rounding data; the last decade has seen advances in automatic methods for assigning terms to images that
have neither user-assigned tags, nor a textual description (Duygulu et al., 2002; Lavrenko et al., 2003;
Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009). These automatic methods learn to associate the presence and absence
of labels with the visual characteristics of an image, such as colour and texture distributions, shape, and
points of interest, and can automatically generate a bag of terms for an unlabelled image.

It is important to remember that not all information needs are entity-based: people also search for im-
ages reflecting a mood, such as people having fun at a party, or an action, such as using a computer. The
bag-of-terms representation is limited to matching images based on the presence or absence of terms,
and not the relation of the terms to each other. Figures 1(a) and (b) highlight the problem with using
unstructured representations for image retrieval: there is a person and a computer in both images but only
(a) depicts a person actually using the computer. To address this problem with unstructured represen-
tations we propose to represent the structure of an image using the Visual Dependency Representation
(Elliott and Keller, 2013). The Visual Dependency Representation is a directed labelled graph over the
regions of an image that captures the spatial relationships between regions. The representation is inspired
by evidence from the psychology literature that people are better at recognising and searching for objects
when the spatial relationships between the objects in the image are consistent with our expectations of
the world.(Biederman, 1972; Bar and Ullman, 1996). In an automatic image description task, Elliott

and Keller (2013) showed that encoding the spatial relationships between objects in the Visual Depen-
dency Representation helped to generate significantly better descriptions than approaches based on the
spatial proximity of objects (Farhadi et al., 2010) or corpus-based models (Yang et al., 2011). In this
paper we study whether the Visual Dependency Representation of images can improve the performance
of query-by-example image retrieval models. The main finding is that encoding images using the Visual
Dependency Representation leads to significantly better retrieval accuracy compared to a bag-of-terms
baseline, and that the improvements are most pronounced for transitive verbs.

2.1 Representing Images

A central problem in image retrieval is how to abstractly represent images (Datta et al., 2008). A bag-
of-terms representation of an image is created by grouping visual features, such as color, shape (Shi
and Malik, 2000), texture, and interest points (Lowe, 1999), in a vector or as a probability distribution
over the features. Image retrieval can then be performed by trying to find the best matchings of terms
across an image collection. Spatial Pyramid Matching is an approach to constructing low-level image
representations that capture the relationships between features at differently sized partitions of the im-
age (Lazebnik et al., 2006). This approach has proven successful for scene categorisation tasks. An
alternative approach to representing images is to learn a mapping (Duygulu et al., 2002; Lavrenko et al.,

110



2003; Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009) between the bags-of-terms and object tags. An image can then be
represented as a bag-of-terms and image retrieval is similar to text retrieval (Wu et al., 2012).

In this work, we represent an image as a directed acyclic graph over a set of labeled object region
annotations. This representation captures the important spatial relationships between the image regions
and makes it possible to distinguish between co-occurring regions and interacting regions.

2.2 Still-Image Action Recognition

One approach to recognizing actions is to learn appearance models for visual phrases and use these
models to predict actions (Sadeghi and Farhadi, 2011). A visual phrase is defined as the people and the
objects they interact with in an action. In this approach, a fixed number of visual phrase models are
trained using the deformable parts object detector (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010) and used to perform action
recognition.

An alternative approach is to model the relationships between objects in an image, and hence the
visible actions, as a Conditional Random Field (CRF), where each node in the field is an object and the
factors between nodes correspond to features that capture the relationships between the objects (Zitnick
et al., 2013). The factors between object nodes in the CRF include object occurrence, absolute position,
person attributes, and the relative location of pairs of objects. This model has been used to generate novel
images of people performing actions and to retrieve images of people performing actions.

Most recently, actions have been predicted in images by selecting the most likely verb and object pair
given a set of candidate objects detected in an image (Le et al., 2013a). The verb and object is selected
amongst those that maximize the distributional similarity of the pair in a large and diverse collection of
documents. This approach is most similar to ours but it relies on an external corpus and, depending on
the text collections used to train the distributional model, will compound the problem of co-occurrence
of objects instead of the relationships between the objects.

The work presented in this paper uses ground-truth annotation for region labels, an assumption similar
to (Zitnick et al., 2013), but requires no external data to make predictions of the relationships between
objects, unlike the approach of (Le et al., 2013a). The directed acyclic graph representation we propose
for images can be seen as a latent representation of the depicted action in the image, where the spatial
relationships between the regions capture the different types of actions.

3 Task and Baseline

In this paper we study the task of query-by-example image retrieval within the restricted domain of
images depicting actions. More specifically, given an image that depicts a given action, such as using a
computer, the aim of the retrieval model is to find all other images in the image collection that depict the
same action. We define an action as an event involving one or more entities in an image, e.g., a woman
running or boy using a computer, and assume all images have been manually annotated for objects. This
assumption means we can explore the utility of the Visual Dependency Representation without the noise
introduced by automatic computer vision methods. The data available to the retrieval models can be seen
in Figure 1, and Section 5 provides further details about the different sources of data The action label -
which is only used for evaluation - is shown in the labelled bounding box, and the Visual Dependency
Representation - not used by the baseline model - is shown as a tree at the bottom of the figure.

The main hypothesis explored in this paper is that the accuracy of an image retrieval model will
increase if the representation encodes information about the relationships between the objects in images.
This hypothesis is tested by encoding images as either an unstructured bag-of-terms representation or
as the structured Visual Dependency Representation. The Bag-of-Terms baseline represents the query
image and the image collection as an unstructured bags-of-terms vector. All of the models used to test
the main hypothesis use the cosine similarity function is to determine the similarity of the query image
to other images in the collection, and thus to generate a ranked list from the similarity values.

4 Visual Dependency Representation

The Visual Dependency Representation (VDR) is a structured representation of an image that captures the
spatial relationships between pairs of image regions in a directed labelled graph. The Visual Dependency
Grammar defines eight possible spatial relationships between pairs of regions, as shown in Table 1.
The relationships in the grammar were designed to provide sufficient coverage of the types of spatial
relationships required to describe the data, and are mathematically defined in terms of pixel overlap,
distance between regions, and the angle between regions. The frame of reference for annotating spatial
relationships is the image itself and not the object in the image, and angles and distance measurements
are taken or estimated from the centroids of the regions. The VDR of an image is created by a trained
human annotator in a two-stage process:

1. The annotator draws and labels boundaries around the parts of the image they think contribute to
defining the action depicted in the image, and the context within which the action occurs;

2. The annotator draws labelled directed edges between the annotated regions that captures how the
relationships between the image convey the action. In Section 4.1, we will explain how to automate
the second stage of the process from a collection of labelled region annotations.

In addition to the annotated image regions, a VDR also contains a ROOT node, which acts as a place-
holder for the image. In the remainder of this section we describe how a gold-standard VDR is created
by a human annotator. The starting point for the VDR in Figure 1(a) is the following set of regions and
the ROOT node:

ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop Bed

First, the regions are attached to each other based on how the relationship between the objects con-
tributes to the depicted action. In Figure 1(a), the Girl is using the Laptop, therefore a labelled directed
edge is created from the Girl region to the Laptop region. The spatial relationship is labelled as BESIDE.

ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop Bed

The Girl is also attached to the Bed because the bed supports her body. The spatial relation label is
ABOVE because it expresses the spatial relationship between the regions, not the semantic relationship
ON. ROOT is attached to the Girl without an edge label to symbolize that she is an actor in the image.

Now the regions that are not concerned with the depicted action are first attached to each other if there
is a clear spatial relationship between them (for an example, see Figure 1(b), where the laptop is attached
to the table because it is sitting on the table), and then to the ROOT node to signify that they do not play
a part in the depicted action. In this example, neither the Lamp nor the Picture are related to the action
of using the computer, so they are attached to the ROOT node.

This now forms a completed VDR for the image in Figure 1(a). This structured representation of
an image captures the prominent relationship between the girl, the laptop, and the bed. There is no
prominent relationship defined between the girl and either the lamp of the picture, in effect these regions
have been relegated to background objects. The central hypothesis underpinning the Visual Dependency
Representation is that images that contain similar VDR substructures are more likely to depict the same
action than images that only contain the same set of objects. For example, the VDR for Figure 1(a)
correctly captures the relationship between the people and the laptops, whereas this relationship is not
present in Figure 1(b), where the person is playing a trumpet.

4.1 Predicting Visual Dependency Representations

We follow the approach of Elliott and Keller (2013) and predict the VDR y of an image over a collection
of labelled region annotations x. This task is framed as a supervised learning problem, where the aim is
to construct a Maximum Spanning Tree from a fully-connected directed weighted graph over the labelled
regions (McDonald et al., 2005). Reducing the fully-connected graph to the Maximum Spanning Tree
removes the region–region edges that are not important in defining the prominent relationships between
the regions in an image. The score of the VDR y over the image regions is calculated as the sum of the
scores of the directed labelled edges:

score(x, y) =
∑

(a,b)∈y
w · f(a, b) (1)

where the score of an edge between image regions a and b is calculated using a vector of weighted feature
functions f . The feature functions characterize the image regions and the edge between pairs of regions,
and include: the labels of the regions and the spatial relation annotated on the edge; the (normalized)
distance between the centroids of the regions; the angle formed between the annotated regions, which is

113



mapped onto the set of spatial relations; the relative size of the region compared to the image; and the
distance of the region centroid from the center of the image.

The model is trained over i instances of region-annotated images xi associated with human-created
VDR structures yi, Itrain = {xi, yi}. The score of each edge a, b is calculated by applying the feature
functions to the data associated with that edge, and this is performed over each edge in a VDR to obtain
a score for a complete gold-standard structure. The parameters of the weight vector w are iteratively
adjusted to maximise the score of the gold-standard structures in the training data using the Margin
Infused Relaxation Algorithm (Crammer and Singer, 2002).

The test data contains i instances of region-annotated images with image regions xi, Itest = {xi}.
The parsing model computes the highest scoring structure ŷi for each instance in the test data by scoring
each possible directed edge between pairs of regions in xi. This process forms a fully-connected graph
over the image regions, from which the Maximum Spanning Tree is taken and returned as the predicted
VDR.

We evaluate the performance of this VDR prediction model by comparing how well it can recover
the manually created trees in the data set. This evaluation is performed on the development data in a
10-fold cross validation setting where each fold of the data is split 80%/10%/10%. Unlabelled directed
accuracy means the model correctly proposes an edge between a pair of regions in the correct direction;
Labelled directed accuracy means it additionally proposes the correct edge label. The baseline approach
is to assume no latent image structure and attach all image regions to the ROOT node of the VDR; this
achieves 51.6% labelled and unlabelled directed attachment accuracy. The accuracy of our automatic
approach to VDR prediction is 61.3% labelled and 68.8% unlabelled attachment accuracy.

4.2 Comparing Visual Dependency Representations
It remains to define how to compare the Visual Dependency Representation of a pair of images. The most
obvious approach is to use the labelled directed accuracy measurement used for the VDR prediction
evaluation in the previous section, but we did not find significant improvements in retrieval accuracy
using this method. We hypothesise that the lack of weight given to the edges between nodes in the Visual
Dependency Representation results in this comparison function not distinguishing between object–object
relationships that matter, such as PERSON

−−−−→
beside BIKE, compared to ROOT −→ TREES. The former

is a potential person–object relationship that explains the depicted event, whereas the latter is only a
background object.

The approach we adopted in this paper is to compare Visual Dependency Representations of images
by decomposing the structure into a set of labelled and a unlabelled parent–child subtrees in a depth-first
traversal of the VDR. The decomposition process allows use to use the same similarity function as the
Bag-of-Terms baseline model, removing the confound of choosing different similarity functions. The
subtrees can be transformed into tokens and these tokens can be used as weighted terms in a vector
representation. An example of a labelled transformation is shown below:

Girl Bed → Girl above Bed
above

We now demonstrate the outcome of comparing images represented using either a vector that con-
catenates the decomposed transformed VDR and bag-of-terms, or a vector that contains only the bag-of-
terms. In this demonstration, each term has a tf-idf weight of 1. The first illustration (Similar) compares
images that depict the same underlying action: Figure 1 (a) and (c). The second illustration (Dissimilar)
compares images that depict different actions: Figure 1 (a) and (b).

Similar : cos(VDRa, VDRc) = 0.56 > cos(Baga, Bagc) = 0.52

Dissimilar : cos(VDRb, VDRa) = 0.201� cos(Bagb, Baga) = 0.4
It can be seen that when the images represent the same action, the decomposed VDR increases the

similarity of the pair of images compared to the bag-of-terms representation; and when images do not

114



represent the same action, the decomposed VDR yields a lower similarity than the bag-of-terms repre-
sentation. These illustrations confirm that Visual Dependency Representations can be used to distinguish
the difference between presence or absence of objects, and the prominent relationships between objects.

5 Data

We use an existing dataset of VDR-annotated images to study whether modelling the structure of an
image can improve image retrieval in the domain of action depictions. The data set of Elliott and Keller
(2013) contains 341 images annotated with region annotations, three visual dependency representations
per image (making a total of 1,023 instances), and a ground-truth action label for each image. An
example of the annotations can be seen in Figure 1. The image collection is drawn from the PASCAL
Visual Object Classification Challenge 2011 action recognition taster and covers a set of 10 actions
(Everingham et al., 2011): riding a bike, riding a horse, reading, running, jumping, walking, playing an
instrument, using a computer, taking a photo, and talking on the phone.

Image Descriptions

Each image is associated with three human-written descriptions collected from untrained annotators
on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The descriptions do not form any part of the models presented in the
current paper; they were used in the automatic image description task of Elliott and Keller (2013). Each
description contains two sentences: the first sentence describes the action depicted in the image, and
the second sentence describes other objects not involved in the action. A two sentence description of
an image helps distinguish objects that are central to depicting the action from objects that may be
distractors.

Region Annotations

The images contain human-drawn labelled region annotations. The annotations were drawn using the
LabelMe toolkit, which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image (Russell
et al., 2008). The annotated regions were restricted to those present in at least one of three human-
written descriptions. To reduce the effects of label sparsity, frequently occurring equivalent labels were
conflated, i.e., man, child, and boy→ person; bike, bicycle, motorbike→ bike; this reduced the object
label vocabulary from 496 labels to 362 labels. The data set contains a total of 5,034 region annotations,
with a mean of 4.19 ± 1.94 annotations per image.
Visual Dependency Representations

Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions, and that people were free to decide how to
describe the action and background of the image. The differences between how people describe images
leads to the creation of one Visual Dependency Representation per image–description pair in the data
set, resulting in a total of 1,023 instances. The process for creating a visual dependency representation
of an image is described in Section 4. The annotated dataset comprises a total of 5,748 spatial relations,
corresponding to a mean of 4.79 ± 3.51 relations per image. Elliott and Keller (2013) report inter-
annotator agreement on a subset of the data at 84% agreement for labelled directed attachments and
95.1% for unlabelled directed attachments.

Action Labels

The original PASCAL action recognition dataset contains ground truth action class annotations for each
image. These annotations are in the form of labelled bounding boxes around the person performing the
action in the image. The action labels are only used as the gold-standard relevance judgements for the
query-by-example image retrieval experiments.

experiment, a single image (the query image) is used to rank the images in the test collection, where the
goal is to construct a ranking where the top images depict the same action as the query image.

6.1 Protocol
The image retrieval experiment is performed using 10-fold cross-validation in the following manner.
The 341 images in the dataset are randomly partitioned into 80%/10%/10% splits, resulting in 1011 test
queries1. For each query we compute average precision and Precision@10 of the ranked list, and use the
resulting values to test the statistical significance of the results.

The training set is used to train the VDR prediction model and to estimate inverse document frequency
statistics. During the training phase, the VDR-based models have access to region boundaries, region
labels and three manually-created VDRs for each training image. In the test set, all models have access to
the region boundaries and labels for each image. Each image in the test set forms a query and the models
produce a ranked list of the remaining images in the test collection. Images are marked for relevance
as follows: a image at rank r is considered relevant if it has the same action label as the query image;
otherwise it is non-relevant. The dev set was used to experiment with different matching functions and
to optimise the feature functions used in the VDR prediction model.

6.2 Models
We compare the retrieval accuracy of three approaches: Bag-of-Terms uses an unstructured representa-
tion for each image. A tf-idf weight is assigned to each region label in an image, and the cosine measure
is used to calculate the similarity of images. This model allows us to compare the usefulness of a struc-
tured vs. unstructured image representation. Automatic VDR is a model using the VDR prediction
method from Section 4.1, and Manual VDR uses the gold-standard data described in Section 5. Both

6.3 Results

Figure 2(a) shows the interpolated precision/recall curve and Table 2 shows the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) and Precision at 10 retrieved images (P@10). The MAP of the Automatic VDR model increases
by 8.8% relative to the Bag-of-Terms model, and a relative improvement up to 10.1% would possible if
we had a better structure prediction model, as evidenced by Manual VDR. Furthermore, if we assume a
user will only view the top results returned by the retrieval model, then P@10 increases by 8.6% when we
model the structure of an image, relative to using an unstructured representation; a relative improvement
of up to 9.4% would be possible if we had a better image parser.

To determine whether the differences are statistically significant, we perform the Wilcoxon Signed
Ranks Test on the average precision and P@10 values over the 1011 queries in our cross-validation
data set. The results support the main hypothesis of this paper: structured image representations allow
us to find images depicting actions more accurately than the standard bag-of-terms representation. We
find significant differences in average precision and P@10 between the Bag-of-Terms baseline and both
Automatic VDR (p < 0.01) and Manual VDR (p < 0.01). This suggests that structure is very useful in
the query-by-example scenario. We find a significant difference in average precision between Automatic
VDR and Manual VDR (p < 0.01), but no difference in P@10 between Automatic VDR and Manual
VDR (p = 0.442).

6.4 Retrieval Performance by Type of Action and Verb

We now analyse whether image structure is useful when the action does not require a direct object. The
analysis presented here compares the Bag-of-Terms model against the Automatic VDR model because
there was no significant difference in P@10 between the Automatic and Manual VDR models. Table 3
shows the MAP and Precision@10 per type of action. Figure 3 shows the precision/recall curves for (a)
transitive verbs, (b) intransitive verbs, and (c) light verbs.

In Figure 3(a), it can be seen that the actions that can be classified as transitive verbs benefit from
exploiting the structure encoded in the Visual Dependency Representation. The only exception is for the
action to read, which frequently behaves as an intransitive verb: the man reads on a train. The consistent
improvement in both the entirety of the ranked list and at the top of the ranked list can be seen in the
MAP and P@10 results in Table 3.

Figure 3(b) shows that there is a small increase in retrieval performance for intransitive verbs compared
to the transitive verbs. We conjecture this is because there are fewer objects to annotate in an image when
the verb does not require a direct object. The summary results for the intransitive verbs in Table 3 confirm
the small but insignificant increase in MAP and P@10.

Finally, the light verbs, shown in Figure 3(c), exhibit variable behaviour in retrieval performance. One
reason for this could be that if the light verb encodes information about the object, as in using a computer,
then the computer can be annotated in the image, and thus it acts as a transitive verb. Conversely, when

(top), intransitive (middle), and light (bottom) verbs. VDR is the Automatic VDR model and Bag is the
Bag-of-Terms model. It can be seen that the Automatic VDR retrieval model is consistently better than
the Bag-of-Terms model on both MAP and Precision@10. ?: the Automatic VDR model is significantly
different than Bag-of-Terms at p < 0.01.

the light verb conveys information about the outcome of the event, as in the action take a photograph,
the outcome is rarely possible to annotate in an image, and so no improvements can be gained from
structured image representations.

6.5 Discussion

In our experiments we observed that all models can achieve high precision at very low levels of recall. We
found that this happens for testing images that are almost identical to the query image. For such images,
objects that are unrelated to the target action form an effective context, which allows this image to be
placed at the top of the ranking. However, near-identical images are relatively rare, and performance
degrades for higher levels of recall.

It is surprising that image retrieval using automatically predicted VDR model is statistically indistin-
guishable from the manually crafted VDR model, given the relatively low accuracy of our VDR predic-
tion model: 61.3% by the labelled dependency attachment accuracy measure. One possible explanation
could be that not all parts of the VDR structure are useful for retrieval purposes, and our VDR prediction
model does well on the useful ones. This observation also suggests that we are unlikely to achieve better
retrieval performance by continuing to improve the accuracy of VDR prediction. We believe a more
promising direction is refining the current formulation of the VDR, and exploring more sophisticated
ways to measure the similarity of two structured representations.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we argued that a limiting factor of retrieving images depicting actions is the unstructured
bag-of-terms representation typically used for images. In a bag-of-terms representation, images that
share similar sets of regions are deemed to be related even when the depicted actions are different. We
proposed that representing an image using the Visual Dependency Representation (VDR) can prevent
this type of misclassification in image retrieval. The VDR of an image captures the region–region re-
lationships that explain what is happening in an image, and it can be automatically predicted from a
region-annotated image.

In a query-by-example image retrieval task, we found that representing images as automatically pre-
dicted VDRs resulted in statistically significant 8.8% relative improvement in MAP and 8.6% relative
improvement in Precision@10 compared to a Bag-of-Terms model. There was a significant difference
in MAP when using manually or automatically predicted image structures, but no difference in the Pre-
cision@10, suggesting that the proposed automatic prediction model is accurate enough for retrieval
purposes. Future work will focus on using automatically generated visual input, such as the output of
the image tagger (Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009), or an automatic object detector (Felzenszwalb et al.,
2010), which will make it possible to tackle image ranking tasks (Hodosh et al., 2013). It would also be
interesting to explore alternative structure prediction methods, such as predicting the relationships using
a conditional random field (Zitnick et al., 2013), or by leveraging distributional lexical semantics (Le et
al., 2013b).
