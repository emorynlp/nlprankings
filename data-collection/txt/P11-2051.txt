Abstract

We present an approach of expanding paral-
lel corpora for machine translation. By uti-
lizing Semantic role labeling (SRL) on one
side of the language pair, we extract SRL sub-
stitution rules from existing parallel corpus.
The rules are then used for generating new
sentence pairs. An SVM classifier is built to
filter the generated sentence pairs. The fil-
tered corpus is used for training phrase-based
translation models, which can be used directly
in translation tasks or combined with base-
line models. Experimental results on Chinese-
English machine translation tasks show an av-
erage improvement of 0.45 BLEU and 1.22
TER points across 5 different NIST test sets.

1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation (SMT) relies on par-
allel corpus. Aside from collecting parallel cor-
pus, we have seen interesting research on automat-
ically generating corpus from existing resources.
Typical examples are paraphrasing using bilingual
(Callison-Burch et al., 2006) or monolingual (Quirk
et al., 2004) data. In this paper, we propose a dif-
ferent methodology of generating additional parallel
corpus. The basic idea of paraphrasing is to find al-
ternative ways that convey the same information.
In contrast, we propose to build new parallel sen-
tences that convey different information, yet retain
correct grammatical and semantic structures.

The basic idea of the proposed method is to sub-
stitute source and target phrase pairs in a sentence
pair with phrase pairs from other sentences. The
problem is how to identify where a substitution
should happen and which phrase pairs are valid can-
didates for the substitution. While syntactical con-
straints have been proven to helpful in identifying

good paraphrases (Callison-Burch, 2008), it is in-
sufficient in our task because it cannot properly filter
the candidates for the replacement. If we allow all
the NPs to be replaced with other NPs, each sen-
tence pair can generate huge number of new sen-
tences. Instead, we resort to Semantic Role Labeling
(Palmer et al., 2005) to provide more lexicalized and
semantic constraints to select the candidates. The
method only requires running SRL labeling on ei-
ther side of the language pair, and that enables ap-
plications on low resource languages. Even with the
SRL constraints, the generated corpus may still be
large and noisy. Hence, we apply an additional fil-
tering stage on the generated corpus. We used an
SVM classifier with features derived from standard
phrase based translation models and bilingual lan-
guage models to identify high quality sentence pairs,
and use these sentence pairs in the SMT training. In
the remaining part of the paper, we introduce the ap-
proach and present experimental results on Chinese-
to-English translation tasks, which showed improve-
ments across 5 NIST test sets.

2 The Proposed Approach

The objective of the method is to generate new syn-
tactically and semantically well-formed parallel sen-
tences from existing corpus. To achieve this, we first
collect a set of rules as the candidates for the substi-
tution. We also need to know where we should put in
the replacements and whether the resulting sentence
pairs are grammatical.

First, standard word alignment and phrase extrac-
tion are performed on existing corpus. Afterwards,
we apply an SRL labeler on either the source or tar-
get language, whichever has a better SRL labeler.
Third, we extract SRL substitution rules (SSRs)
from the corpus. The rules carry information of se-
mantic frames, semantic roles, and corresponding

included in the phrase table are shown on the bottom.

source and target phrases. Fourth, we replace phrase
pairs in existing sentences with the SSR if they have
the same semantic frames and semantic roles.

The newly generated sentence pairs will pass
through a classifier to determine whether they are
acceptable parallel sentences. And, finally, we train
MT system using the new corpus. The resulting
phrase table can either be used directly in translation
tasks or be interpolated with baseline phrase tables.

3 SRL Substitution Rules
Swapping phrase pairs that serve as the same seman-
tic role of the same semantic frame can provide more
combinations of words and phrases. Figure 1 shows
an example. The phrase pair “新疆伊犁将举行→
Xinjiang’s Yili will hold” would not be observed in
the original corpus without substitution. In this pa-
per, we call a tuple of semantic frame and semantic
role a semantic signature. Two phrase pairs with the
same semantic signature are considered valid substi-
tutions of each other.

The extraction of SSRs is similar to the well-
known phrase extraction algorithm (Och and Ney,
2004). The criteria of a phrase pair to be included in
the SSR set are1:

• The phrase on side A must cover a whole se-
mantic role constituent, and it must not contain

1We call the language which has SRL labels side A, and the
other language side B.

words in any other semantic role constituent of
the same frame.
• The phrase on side B must not contain words

that link to words not in the phrase on side A.
• Both of the two boundary words on side B

phrases must have at least one link to a word
of the phrases on side A. The boundary words
on side A phrases can be unaligned only if they
are inside the semantic role constituent.

Utilizing these rules, we can perform the sentence
generation process. For each semantic structure of
each sentence,2 we determine the phrase pair to be
replaced by the same criteria as mention above, and
search for suitable SSRs with the same semantic sig-
nature. Finally, we replace the original phrases with
the source and target side phrases given by the SSRs.
Notice that for each new sentence generated, we al-
low for application of only one substitution.

Although the idea is straightforward, we face two
problems in practice. First, for frequent semantic
frames, the number of substitution candidates can be
very large. It will generate many new sentence pairs,
and can easily exceed the capacity of our system.
To deal with the problem, we pre-filter the SSRs so
that each semantic signature is associated with no
more than 100 SSRs. As we can see from the cri-
teria for extracting SSRs, all the entries in the SSR
rule set satisfies the commonly used phrase extrac-
tion heuristics. Therefore, the set of SSRs is a subset
of the phrase table. Because of this, We use the fea-
tures in the phrase table to sort the rules, and keep
100 rules with highest the arithmetic mean of the
feature values.

The second problem is the phrase boundaries are
often inaccurate. To handle this problem, we use a
simple “glue” algorithm during the substitution. If
the inserted phrase has a prefix or suffix sub-phrase
that is the same as the suffix or prefix of the adjacent
parts of the original sentence, then the duplication
will be removed.

4 Classification of Generated Sentences

We can expect the generated corpus be noisy, and
needs to be filtered. In this paper we use an SVM
classifier to perform this task. First we label a set of

2One sentence can have multiple semantic structures.

sentence pairs 3 randomly sampled from the gener-
ated data. We ask the following questions:

1. Are the two sentences grammatical, especially
on the boundaries of substituted phrase pairs?

2. Are the two sentences still parallel?

If both questions have positive answers, we label
the sentence pair as positive. We can then use the la-
bels together with the features to train the classifier.
It is worth mentioning that when we say “grammat-
ical”, we do not care about the validity of the actual
meaning of the sentence.

The set of SSR is a subset of the phrase table.
Therefore, the features in the phrase table can be
used as features. It includes the bidirectional phrase
and lexicon translation probabilities.

In addition, we use the language model features.
The language model score of the whole sentence
is useless because it is dominated by words not af-
fected by the substitution. Therefore, we only con-
sider n-grams that are affected by the substitution.
I.e. only the boundary words are taken into account.
Given an n-gram language model, we only calculate
the scores in windows with the size 2n−2, centered
on the boundary of the substituted phrases. In other
words, n − 1 words before and after the boundaries
will be included in the calculation.

Finally, there are two additional features: the
probability of observing the source/target phrase
given the semantic signature. They can be calculated
by counting the frequencies of source/target phrases
and the semantic signature in extracted rules.

As we have abundant sentence pairs generated,
we prefer to apply a more harsh filtering, keeping
only the best candidates. Therefore, when training
the SVM model, we intentionally increase the cost
of false positive errors, so as to maximize the pre-
cision rate of positive decisions and reduce possible
contamination. In an experiment, we used 900 of
the 1000 labeled sentence pairs as the training set,
and the remaining 100 (41 positive and 59 negative
samples) sentence pairs as the test set. By setting the
cost of false positive errors to 1.33, we classified 20
of 41 positive samples correctly, and only 3 of the
59 negative samples are classified as positive.

5 Utilizing the Generated Corpus

With the generated corpus, we perform training and
generate a new phrase table. There are many ways
of utilizing the new phrase table; the simplest way is
to use it directly for translation tasks. However, the
new phrase table may be noisier than the original
one. To solve this, we interpolate the new phrase ta-
ble with the baseline phrase table. If a phrase pair is
only observed in the baseline phrase table, we keep
it intact in the interpolated phrase table. If a phrase
pair is observed only in the new phrase table, we
discount all the feature values by a factor of 2. And
if the phrase pair is in both of the phrase tables, the
feature values will be the arithmetic mean of the cor-
responding values in the two phrase tables.

We also noticed that the new corpus may have
very different distribution of words comparing to the
baseline corpus. The word alignment process us-
ing generative models is more likely to be affected
by the radical change of distributions. Therefore,
we also experimented with force aligning the gener-
ated corpus with the word alignment models trained
baseline corpus before building the phrase table.

6 Experiments

We performed experiments on Chinese to English
MT tasks with the proposed approach. The base-
line system is trained on the FBIS corpus, the statis-
tics of the corpus is shown in Table 1. We adopted
the ASSERT English SRL labeler (Pradhan et al.,
2004), which was trained on PropBank data us-
ing SVM classifier. The labeler reports 81.87%
precision and 73.21% recall rate on CoNLL-2005
shared task on SRL. We aligned the parallel sen-
tences with MGIZA(Gao and Vogel, 2008), and per-
formed experiments with the Moses toolkit (Koehn
et al, 2007).

lion SSRs. As we can observe in Table 1, we gener-
ated 29.6 million sentences from the 387K sentence
pairs, and by using the SVM-based classifier, we fil-
ter the corpus down to 7.2 million. We also observed
that the average sentence length increases by 15% in
the generated corpus. That is because longer sen-
tences have more slots for substitution. Therefore,
they have more occurrences in the generated corpus.

We used the NIST MT06 test set for tuning, and
experimented with 5 test sets, including MT02, 03,
04, 05, 08. Table 2 shows the BLEU and TER scores
of the experiments. As we can see in the results,
by using only the generated sentence pairs, the per-
formance of the system drops. However the inter-
polated phrase tables outperform the baseline. On
average, the improvements on all the 5 test sets are
0.45 on BLEU score and -1.22 on TER when using
the interpolated phrase table. We do observe MT08
drops on BLEU scores; however, the TER scores
are consistently improved across all the test sets.
When using baseline alignment model, we observe a
quite different phenomenon. In this case, interpolat-
ing the phrase tables no longer show improvements.

-1.80 on average TER. An explanation is that us-
ing identical alignment model makes the phrases ex-
tracted from the baseline and generated corpus sim-
ilar, which undermines the idea of interpolating two
phrase tables. As shown in Table 3, it generates less
new source phrases and 10% more phrase pairs that
overlaps with the baseline phrase table. For com-
parison, we also provide scores from a system that
uses the training data for GALE project, which has
8.7M sentence pairs4. In Table 3 we observe that
the large GALE system yields better BLEU results
while the IT or GA systems have even better TER
scores than the GALE system. The expanded cor-
pus performs almost as well as the GALE system
even though the large system has a phrase table that
is four time larger.

The statistics of the phrase tables and translation
outputs are listed in Table 3. As we can see, the
generated sentence introduces a large number of new
source phrases and the average lengths of matching
source phrases of all the systems are longer than the
baseline, which could be an evidence for our claim
that the proposed approach can generate more high
quality sentences and phrase pairs that have not been
observed in the original corpus.

7 Conclusion
In this paper we explore a novel way of generating
new parallel corpus from existing SRL labeled cor-
pus. By extracting SRL substitution rules (SSRs) we
generate a large set of sentence pairs, and by apply-
ing an SVM-based classifier we can filter the corpus,

keeping only grammatical sentence pairs. By inter-
polating the phrase table with the baseline phrase ta-
ble, we observed improvement on Chinese-English
machine translation tasks and the performance is
comparable to system trained with larger manually
collected parallel corpus. While our experiments
were performed on Chinese-English, the approach is
more useful for low resource languages. The advan-
tage of the proposed method is that we only need the
SRL labels on either side of the language pair, and
we can choose the one with a better SRL labeler.

The features we used in the paper are still prim-
itive, which results in a classifier radically tuned
against false positive rate. This can be improved by
designing more informative features.

Since the method will only introduce new phrases
across the phrase boundaries of phrases in existing
phrase table, it is desirable to be integrated with
other paraphrasing approaches to further increase
the coverage of the generated corpus.
