Abstract
In Semantic Textual Similarity, systems
rate the degree of semantic equivalence
between two text snippets. This year,
the participants were challenged with new
data sets for English, as well as the in-
troduction of Spanish, as a new language
in which to assess semantic similarity.
For the English subtask, we exposed the
systems to a diversity of testing scenar-
ios, by preparing additional OntoNotes-
WordNet sense mappings and news head-
lines, as well as introducing new gen-
res, including image descriptions, DEFT
discussion forums, DEFT newswire, and
tweet-newswire headline mappings. For
Spanish, since, to our knowledge, this is
the first time that official evaluations are
conducted, we used well-formed text, by
featuring sentences extracted from ency-
clopedic content and newswire. The an-
notations for both tasks leveraged crowd-
sourcing. The Spanish subtask engaged 9
teams participating with 22 system runs,
and the English subtask attracted 15 teams
with 38 system runs.

1 Introduction and motivation

Given two snippets of text, Semantic Textual Sim-
ilarity (STS) captures the notion that some texts
are more similar than others, measuring their de-
gree of semantic equivalence. Textual similar-
ity can range from complete unrelatedness to ex-
act semantic equivalence, and a graded similar-
ity intuitively captures the notion of intermediate

shades of similarity, as pairs of text may differ
from some minor nuanced aspects of meaning, to
relatively important semantic differences, to shar-
ing only some details, or to simply being related
to the same topic (cf. Section 2).

One of the goals of the STS task is to create a
unified framework for combining several seman-
tic components that otherwise have historically
tended to be evaluated independently and with-
out characterization of impact on NLP applica-
tions. By providing such a framework, STS al-
lows for an extrinsic evaluation of these modules.
Moreover, such an STS framework itself could in
turn be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically as
a grey/black box within various NLP applications
such as Machine Translation (MT), Summariza-
tion, Generation, Question Answering (QA), etc.

STS is related to both Textual Entailment (TE)
and Paraphrasing, but differs in a number of ways
and it is more directly applicable to a number of
NLP tasks. STS is different from TE inasmuch
as it assumes bidirectional graded equivalence be-
tween the pair of textual snippets. In the case of
TE the equivalence is directional, e.g. a car is a
vehicle, but a vehicle is not necessarily a car. STS
also differs from both TE and Paraphrasing (in as
far as both tasks have been defined to date in the
literature) in that, rather than being a binary yes/no
decision (e.g. a vehicle is not a car), we define
STS to be a graded similarity notion (e.g. a ve-
hicle and a car are more similar than a wave and
a car). A quantifiable graded bidirectional notion
of textual similarity is useful for a myriad of NLP
tasks such as MT evaluation, information extrac-
tion, question answering, summarization, etc.

In 2012 we held the first pilot task at SemEval
2012, as part of the *SEM 2012 conference, with
great success: 35 teams participated with 88 sys-
tem runs (Agirre et al., 2012). In addition, we held

a DARPA sponsored workshop at Columbia Uni-
versity.1 In 2013, STS was selected as the offi-
cial Shared Task of the *SEM 2013 conference,
with two subtasks: The Core task, which is sim-
ilar to the 2012 task; and a Pilot task on Typed-
similarity between semi-structured records. The
Core task attracted 34 participants with 89 runs,
and the Typed-similarity task attracted 6 teams
with 14 runs.

For STS 2014 we defined two subtasks: En-
glish and Spanish. For the English subtask we pro-
vided five test datasets: two datasets that extend
already released genres (the OntoNotes-WordNet
sense mappings and news headlines) and three
new genres: image descriptions, DEFT discus-
sion forum data and newswire, as well as tweet-
newswire headline mappings. Participants could
use all datasets released in 2012 and 2013 as train-
ing data. The Spanish subtask introduced two di-
verse datasets on different genres, namely ency-
clopedic descriptions extracted from the Spanish
Wikipedia and contemporary Spanish newswire.
For the Spanish subtask, the participants had ac-
cess to a limited amount of labeled data, consist-
ing of 65 sentence pairs, which they could use for
training.

2 Task Description

2.1 English Subtask
The English dataset comprises pairs of news head-
lines (HDL), pairs of glosses (OnWN), image de-
scriptions (Images), DEFT-related discussion fo-
rums (Deft-forum) and news (Deft-news), and

tweet comments and newswire headline mappings
(Tweets).

For HDL, we used naturally occurring news
headlines gathered by the Europe Media Moni-
tor (EMM) engine (Best et al., 2005) from sev-
eral different news sources. EMM clusters to-
gether related news. Our goal was to generate
a balanced data set across the different similar-
ity ranges, hence we built two sets of headline
pairs: (i) a set where the pairs come from the same
EMM cluster, (ii) and another set where the head-
lines come from a different EMM cluster, then
we computed the string similarity between those
pairs. Accordingly, we sampled 375 headline pairs
of headlines that occur in the same EMM cluster,
aiming for pairs equally distributed between min-
imal and maximal similarity using simple string
similarity. We sampled other 375 pairs from the
different EMM cluster in the same manner.

For OnWN, we used the sense definition pairs
of OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) and WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998). Different from previous tasks,
the two definition sentences in a pair belong to dif-
ferent senses. We sampled 750 pairs based on a
string similarity ranging from 0.5 to 1.

The Images data set is a subset of the PAS-
CAL VOC-2008 data set (Rashtchian et al., 2010),
which consists of 1,000 images and has been used
by a number of image description systems. It was
also sampled from string similarity values between
0.6 and 1.

Deft-forum and Deft-news are from DEFT
data.2 Deft-forum contains the forum post sen-
tences, and Deft-news are news summaries. We
selected 450 pairs for Deft-forum and 300 pairs for
Deft-news. They are sampled evenly from string
similarities falling in the interval 0.6 to 1.

The Tweets data set contains tweet-news pairs
selected from the corpus released in (Guo et al.,
2013), where each pair contains a sentence that
pertains to the news title, while the other one rep-
resents a Twitter comment on that particular news.
They are evenly sampled from string similarity
values between 0.5 and 1.

Table 1 shows the explanations and values as-
sociated with each score between 5 and 0. As
in prior years, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT)3 to crowdsource the annotation of the En-
glish pairs.4 Annotators are presented with the

Five sentence pairs are presented to each annota-
tor at once, per human intelligence task (HIT), at
a payrate of $0.20; we collect five separate anno-
tations per sentence pair. Annotators were only el-
igible to work on the task if they had the Mechan-
ical Turk Master Qualification. This is a special

Amazon Mechanical Turk, since it provides numerous useful
tools to assist in running a successful annotation project using
crowdsourcing, such as support for hidden ’golden’ questions
that can be used both to train annotators and to automatically
stop people who repeatedly make mistakes from contribut-
ing to the task. However, in 2013, CrowdFlower dropped
Amazon Mechanical Turk as an annotation source. When we
tried running pairs for STS 2014 on CrowdFlower using the
same templates that were successfully used for the 2013 task,
we found that we obtained significantly degraded annotation
quality, with an average Pearson (AMT provider vs. rest of
AMT providers) of only 22.8%. In contrast, when we ran the
task for 2014 on AMT, we obtained a one-vs-rest annotation
of 73.6%.

qualification conferred by AMT (using a priority
statistical model) to annotators who consistently
maintain a very high level of quality across a vari-
ety of tasks from numerous requesters). Access to
these skilled workers entails a 20% surcharge.

To monitor the quality of the annotations, we
use the gold dataset of 105 pairs that were manu-
ally annotated by the task organizers during STS
2013. We include one of these gold pairs in each
set of five sentence pairs, where the gold pairs are
indistinguishable from the rest. Unlike when we
ran on CrowdFlower for STS 2013, the gold pairs
are not used for training purposes, nor are workers
automatically banned from the task if they make
too many mistakes on annotating them. Rather, the
gold pairs are only used to help in identifying and
removing the data associated with poorly perform-
ing annotators. With few exceptions, 90% of the
answers from each individual annotator fall within
+/-1 of the answers selected by the organizers for

the gold dataset.
The distribution of scores obtained from the

AMT providers in the Deft-forum, Deft-news,
OnWN and tweet-news datasets is roughly uni-
form across the different grades of similarity, al-
though the scores are slightly higher for tweet-
news. Compared to the other data sets, the scores
for OnWN, were more bimodal, ranging between
4.6 to 5 and 0 to 0.4, when compared to middle
values (2.6-3.4).

In order to assess the annotation quality, we
measure the correlation of each annotator with the
average of the rest of the annotators, and then aver-
age the results. This approach to estimate the qual-
ity is identical to the method used for evaluations
(see Section 3), and it can thus be considered as
the upper bound of the systems. The inter-tagger
correlation for each English dataset is as follows:
• HDL: 79.4%
• OnWN: 67.2%
• Deft-forum: 58.6%
• Deft-news: 70.7%
• Images: 83.6%
• Tweets-news: 74.4%
The correlation figures are generally high (over

70%), with the exception of the OnWN and Deft
datasets, which score 67.2% and 58.6%, respec-
tively. The reason for the low inter-tagger correla-

tion on OnWN compared to the higher correlations
in previous years is that we only used unmapped
sense definitions, i.e., the two sentences in a pair
belong to two different senses. For the Deft-forum
dataset, we found that similarity values tend to be
lower than in the other datasets, and more annota-
tion disagreements happen in these low similarity
values.

2.2 Spanish Subtask

The Spanish subtask follows a setup similar to the
English subtask, except that the similarity scores
were adapted to fit a range from 0 to 4 (see Table
1). We thought that the distinction between a score
of 3 and 4 for the English task will pose more dif-
ficulty for us in conveying into Spanish, as the sole
difference between the two lies in how the annota-
tors perceive the importance of additional details
or missing information with respect to the core se-
mantic interpretation of the pair. As this aspect en-
tails a subjective judgement, and since it is the first
time that a Spanish STS evaluation is organized,
we casted the annotation guidelines into straight-
forward and unambiguous instructions, and thus
opted to use a similarity range from 0 to 4.

Prior to the evaluation window, we released 65
Spanish sentence pairs for trial / training. In or-
der to evaluate system performance under differ-

84



ent scenarios, we developed two test datasets, one
extracted from the Spanish Wikipedia5 (December
2013 dump) and one from contemporary news ar-
ticles collected from media in Spanish (February
2014).

2.2.1 Spanish Wikipedia
The Wikipedia dump was processed using the
Parse::MediaWikiDump Perl library. We removed
all titles, html tags, wiki tags and hyperlinks
(keeping only the surface forms). Each article was
split into paragraphs, where the first paragraph
was considered to be the article’s abstract, while
the remaining ones were deemed to be its content.
Each of these were split into sentences using the
Perl library Uplug::PreProcess::SentDetect, and
only the sentences longer than eight words were
used. We iteratively computed the lexical simi-
larity6 between every sentence in the abstract and
every sentence in the content, and retained those
pairs whose sentence length ratio was higher than
0.5, and their similarity scored over 0.35.

The final set of sentence pairs was split into five
bins, and their scores normalized to range from
0 to 1. The more interesting and difficult pairs
were found, perhaps not surprisingly, in bins 0 and
1, where synonyms/short paraphrases where more
frequent. An example extracted from those bins,
where the text in italics highlights the differences
between the two sentences:
• “America” es el segundo continente más

grande del planeta, después de Asia.
“America” is the second largest continent in the world,

following Asia.

• America corresponde a la segunda masa de
tierra más grande del planeta, luego de Asia.
America is the second largest land mass on the planet,

after Asia.

The Spanish verb “Es” maps to (En:7 is), ”cor-
responde a” (En: corresponds to), the phrase “el
segundo continente” (En: the second continent) is
equivalent to “la segunda masa de tierra” (the sec-
ond land mass), and “despues” (En: following) to
“luego” (En: after). Despite the difference in vo-
cabulary choice, the two sentences are paraphrases
of each other.

From the candidate pairs, we manually selected
324 sentence pairs, in order to ensure a diverse

rithm::Diff Perl module).

and challenging set. This set was annotated in two
ways, first by two graduate students in Computer
Science who are native speakers of Spanish, and
second by using AMT.

The AMT framework was set up to contain
seven sentence pairs per HIT, where six of them
were part of the test dataset, while one was used
for control. AMT providers were eligible to com-
plete a task if they had more than 500 accepted
HITs, with 90%+ acceptance rate.8 We paid $0.30
per HIT, and each HIT was annotated by five AMT
providers. We sought to ensure that only Spanish
speaking annotators would complete the HITs by
providing all the information related to the task (its
title, abstract, description, guidelines and exam-
ples), as well as the control pair in Spanish only.
The participants were instructed to label the pairs
on a scale from 0 to 4 (see Table 1). Each sentence
pair was followed by a comment text box, which
the AMT providers used to provide the topic of the
sentences, corrections, etc.

The two students achieved a Pearson correla-
tion of 0.6974 on the Wikipedia dataset. To see
how their judgement compares to the crowd wis-
dom, we averaged the AMT scores for each pair,
and computed their correlation with our annota-
tors, obtaining 0.824 and 0.742, respectively. Sur-
prisingly enough, both these correlation values are
higher than the correlation among the annotators
themselves. When averaging the annotator scores
and comparing them with the AMT providers’
average score per pair, the correlation becomes
0.8546, indicating that the task is well defined,
and that the annotations contributed by the AMT
providers are of satisfactory quality. Given these
scores, the gold standard was annotated using the
average AMT provider judgement per pair.

2.2.2 Spanish News
The second Spanish dataset was extracted from
news articles published in Spanish language me-
dia from around the world in February 2014. The
hyperlinks to the articles were obtained by pars-
ing the ”International” page of Spanish Google
News,9 which aggregates or clusters in real time
articles describing a particular event from a di-
verse pool of news sites, where each grouping

tation task to require Master level providers (as those partici-
pating in the English annotations), yet after approximately 4
days, no HIT had been completed.

is labeled with the title of one of the predomi-
nant articles. By leveraging these clusters of links
pointing to the sites where the articles were orig-
inally published, we are able to gather raw text
that has a high probability of containing seman-
tically similar sentences. We encountered several
difficulties while mining the articles, ranging from
each article having its own formatting depend-
ing on the source site, to advertisements, cookie
requirements, to encoding for Spanish diacritics.
We used the lynx text-based browser,10 which was
able to standardize the raw articles to a degree.
The output of the browser was processed using a
rule based approach taking into account continu-
ous text span length, ratio of symbols and num-
bers to the text, etc., in order to determine when
a paragraph is part of the article content. After
that, a second pass over the predictions corrected
mislabeled paragraphs if they were preceded and
followed by paragraphs identified as content. All
the content pertaining to articles on the same event
was joined, sentence split, and diff pairwise simi-
larities were computed. The set of candidate sen-
tences followed the same requirements as for the
Wikipedia dataset, namely length ratio higher than
0.5 and similarity score over 0.35. From these, we
manually extracted 480 sentence pairs which were
deemed to pose a challenge to an automated sys-
tem.

Due to the high correlations obtained between
the AMT providers’ scores and the annotators’
scores on Wikipedia, the news dataset was only
annotated using AMT, following exactly the same
task setup as for Wikipedia.

3 Evaluation

Evaluation of STS is still an open issue.
STS experiments have traditionally used Pearson
product-moment correlation between the system
scores and the GS scores, or, alternatively, Spear-
man rank order correlation. In addition, we also
need a method to aggregate the results from each
dataset into an overall score. The analysis per-
formed in (Agirre and Amigó, In prep) shows that
Pearson and averaging across datasets are the best
suited combination in general. In particular, Pear-
son is more informative than Spearman, in that
Spearman only takes the rank differences into ac-
count, while Pearson does account for value dif-
ferences as well. The study also showed that other

10lynx.browser.org

alternatives need to be considered, depending on
the requirements of the target application.

We leave application-dependent evaluations for
future work, and focus on average Pearson correla-
tion. When averaging, we weight each individual
correlation by the size of the dataset. In order to
compute statistical significance among system re-
sults, we use a one-tailed parametric test based on
Fisher’s z-transformation (Press et al., 2002, equa-
tion 14.5.10). In addition, English subtask partic-
ipants could provide an optional confidence mea-
sure between 0 and 100 for each of their predic-
tions. Team RTM-DCU is the only one who has
provided these, and the evaluation of their runs us-
ing weighted Pearson (Pozzi et al., 2012) is listed
at the end of Table 3.

Participants11 could take part in the shared task
with a maximum of 3 system runs per subtask.

3.1 English Subtask

In order to provide a simple word overlap baseline
(Baseline-tokencos), we tokenize the input sen-
tences splitting on white spaces, and then repre-
sent each sentence as a vector in the multidimen-
sional token space. Each dimension has 1 if the to-
ken is present in the sentence, 0 otherwise. Vector
similarity is computed using the cosine similarity
metric.

We also run the freely available system, Take-
Lab (Šarić et al., 2012), which yielded state of the
art performance in STS 2012 and strong results
out-of-the-box in 2013.12

15 teams participated in the English subtask,
submitting 38 system runs. One team submitted
the results past the deadline, as explicitly marked
in Table 3. After the submission deadline expired,
the organizers published the gold standard and par-
ticipant submissions on the task website, in order
to ensure a transparent evaluation process.

task, with runs listed in alphabetical order. The

by the mean correlation (the official measure),
and the rank of the run. The highest correla-
tions are for OnWN (87.5%, by Meerkat Mafia)
and images (83.4%, by NTNU), followed by
Tweets (79.2%, by NTNU), HEADL (78.4%, by
NTNU) and deft news and forums (78.1% and
53.1%, respectively, by NTNU). Compared to the
inter-annotator agreement correlation, the ranking
among datasets is very similar, with the exception
of OnWN, as it gets the best score but has very low
agreement. One possible reason is that the partic-
ipants used previously available data. The results
of the best 4 top system runs are significantly dif-
ferent (p-value < 0.05) from the 5th top scoring
system run and below. The top 4 systems did not
show statistical significant variation among them.

Only three runs (cf. lower rows in Table 3) in-
cluded non-uniform confidence scores, barely af-
fecting their ranking.

Interestingly, the two top performing systems
on the English STS sub-task are both unsuper-
vised. DLS@CU (Sultan et al., 2014b) presents
an unsupervised algorithm which predicts the STS
score based on the proportion of word alignments
in the two sentences. Two related words are
aligned depending on how similar the two words
are, and also on how similar the contexts of the
words are in the respective sentences (Sultan et al.,
2014a). Meerkat Mafia pairingWords (Kashyap
et al., 2014) also follows a fully unsupervised ap-
proach. The authors train LSA on an English cor-
pus of three billion words using a sliding window
approach, resulting in a vocabulary size of 29,000
words associated with 300 dimensions. They ac-
count for named entities and out-of-vocabulary
words by leveraging external resources such as
DBpedia13 and Wordnik.14 In Spanish, the sys-
tem equivalent to this run ranked second following
a cross-lingual approach, by applying the English
system to the translated version of the dataset (see
3.2).

The Table also shows the results of TakeLab,
which was trained with all datasets from previ-
ous years. TakeLab would rank 18th, ten absolute
points below the best system, a smaller difference
than in 2013.

3.2 Spanish Subtask

The Spanish subtask attracted 9 teams with 22
participating systems, out of which 16 were su-
pervised and 6 unsupervised. The participants
were from both Spanish (Colombia, Cuba, Mex-
ico, Spain), and non-Spanish speaking countries
(two teams from France, Germany, Ireland, UK,
US). The evaluation results appear in Table 4.

The top ranking system is the 2nd run of
UMCC DLSI SemSim (Chavez et al., 2014),
which achieves a weighted correlation of 0.807. It
entails a cross-lingual approach, as it leverages a
SVM-based English framework, by mapping the
Spanish words to their English equivalent using
the most common sense in WordNet 3.0. The clas-
sifier uses a combination of features, such as those
derived from traditional knowledge-based ((Lea-
cock and Chodorow, 1998; Wu and Palmer, 1994;
Lin, 1998), and others) and corpus-based metrics
(LSA (Landauer et al., 1997)), paired with lexi-
cal features (such as Dice-Similarity, Euclidean-
distance, etc.). It is trained on a cumulative En-
glish STS dataset comprising train and test data
released as part of tasks in SemEval2012 (Agirre
et al., 2012) and *Sem 2013 (Agirre et al., 2013),
as well as training data available from tasks 1 and
10 in SemEval 2014. Interestingly enough, run 2
of the system performs better than run 1, despite
the fact that it uses half the features, and focuses
on string based similarity measures only. This dif-
ference between runs is noticed on the Wikipedia
dataset only, and it amounts to 4% Pearson corre-
lation. While the system had a robust performance
on the Spanish subtask, for English, its overall
rank was 16, 18, and 33, respectively.

Coming in close at only 0.3% difference, is
Meerkat-Mafia PairingAvg (run 2) (Kashyap et
al., 2014), which also follows a cross-lingual ap-
proach, by applying the system the team devel-
oped for the English subtask to the translated ver-
sion of the datasets (see 3.1). The interesting as-
pect of their work is that in their first submission
(run 1), they only consider the similarity result-
ing from the sentence pair translation through the
Google Translate service.15 In the second run,
they expand each sentence to 20 possible combi-
nations by accounting for the multiple translation
meanings of a given word, and considering the av-
erage similarity of all resulting pairs. While the
first run achieves a weighted correlation of 73.8%,

the second one performs significantly better at
80.4%, indicating that the additional context may
also include multiple instances of accurate trans-
lations, hence significantly impacting the overall
similarity score. In English, the system equiva-
lent to run 2 in Spanish, namely Meerkat Mafia-
pairingWords, achieves a competitive ranked per-
formance across all six datasets, ranking second,
at an order of 10−4 distance from the top sys-
tem. This supports the claim that, despite its unsu-
pervised nature, the system is quite versatile and
highly competitive with the top performing super-
vised frameworks, and that it may achieve an even
higher performance in Spanish if accurate sen-
tence translations were provided.

Overall, most systems were cross-lingual, rely-
ing on different translation approaches, such as 1)
translating the test data into English (as the two
systems above), and then exporting the score ob-
tained for the English sentences back to Spanish,
or 2) performing automatic translation of the En-
glish training data, and learning a classifier di-
rectly in Spanish. (Buscaldi et al., 2014) supple-
mented their training dataset with human annota-
tions conducted in Spanish, using definition pairs
extracted from a Spanish dictionary. A different
angle was explored by (Rios, 2014), who proposed
a multilingual framework using transfer learning
across English and Spanish by training on tradi-
tional lexical, knowledge-based and corpus-based
features. The semantic similarity task was ap-

proached from a monolingual perspective as well
(Gupta, 2014), by focusing on Spanish resources,
such as the trial data we released as part of the
subtask, and the Spanish WordNet;16 these were
leveraged using meta-learning over variations of
overlap-based metrics. Following the same line,
(Biçici and Way, 2014) pursued language inde-
pendent methods, who avoided relying on task or
domain specific information through the usage of
referential translation machines. This approach
models textual semantic similarity as a decision in
terms of translation quality between two datasets
(in our case Spanish STS trial and test data) given
relevant examples from an in-language reference
corpus.

In comparison to the correlations obtained in the
English subtask, where the highest weighted mean
was 76.1%, for Spanish, we obtained 80.7%, prob-
ably due to the more formal nature of the datasets,
since Wikipedia and news articles employ mostly
well formed and grammatically correct sentences,
and we selected all snippets to be longer than 8
words. The overall correlation scores obtained for
English were hurt by the deft-forum data, which
scored significantly lower (at a maximum corre-
lation of 50.8%), when compared to all the other
datasets whose correlation was higher than 70%.
The OnWN data was most similar to our test sets,
and it attained a maximum of 85.9%.

4 Conclusion

This year’s STS task comprised a multilingual
flair, by introducing Spanish datasets alongside the
English ones. In English, the datasets sought to ex-
pose the participating teams to more diverse sce-
narios compared to the previous years, by intro-
ducing image descriptions, forum and newswire
genre, and tweet-newswire headline mappings.
For Spanish, two datasets were developed consist-
ing of encyclopedic and newswire text acquired
from Spanish sources. Overall, the English sub-
task attracted 15 teams (with 38 system varia-
tions), while the Spanish subtask had 9 teams
(with 22 system runs). Most teams from the Span-
ish subtask have also submitted runs for the En-
glish evaluations.
