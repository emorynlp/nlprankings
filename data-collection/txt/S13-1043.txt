Abstract

Implicit arguments are a discourse-level phe-
nomenon that has not been extensively stud-
ied in semantic processing. One reason for
this lies in the scarce amount of annotated data
sets available. We argue that more data of
this kind would be helpful to improve exist-
ing approaches to linking implicit arguments
in discourse and to enable more in-depth stud-
ies of the phenomenon itself. In this paper, we
present a range of studies that empirically val-
idate this claim. Our contributions are three-
fold: we present a heuristic approach to auto-
matically identify implicit arguments and their
antecedents by exploiting comparable texts;
we show how the induced data can be used as
training data for improving existing argument
linking models; finally, we present a novel ap-
proach to modeling local coherence that ex-
tends previous approaches by taking into ac-
count non-explicit entity references.

1 Introduction

Semantic role labeling systems traditionally process
text in a sentence-by-sentence fashion, construct-
ing local structures of semantic meaning (Palmer et
al., 2010). Information relevant to these structures,
however, can be non-local in natural language texts
(Palmer et al., 1986; Fillmore, 1986, inter alia). In
this paper, we view instances of this phenomenon,
also referred to as implicit arguments, as elements
of discourse. In a coherent discourse, each utter-
ance focuses on a salient set of entities, also called
“foci” (Sidner, 1979) or “centers” (Joshi and Kuhn,
1979). According to the theory of Centering (Grosz

et al., 1995), the salience of an entity in a discourse
is reflected by linguistic factors such as choice of
referring expression and syntactic form. Both ex-
tremes of salience, i.e., contexts of referential conti-
nuity (Brown, 1983) and irrelevance, can also be re-
flected by the non-realization of an entity. Altough
specific instances of non-realization, so-called zero
anaphora, have been well-studied in discourse anal-
ysis (Sag and Hankamer, 1984; Tanenhaus and Carl-
son, 1990, inter alia), this phenomenon has widely
been ignored in computational approaches to entity-
based coherence modeling. It could, however, pro-
vide an explanation for local coherence in cases that
are not covered by current models of Centering (cf.
Louis and Nenkova (2010)). In this work, we pro-
pose a new model to predict whether realizing an
argument contributes to local coherence in a given
position in discourse. Example (1) shows a text frag-
ment, in which argument realization is necessary in
the first sentence but redundant in the second.

(1) El Salvador is now the only Latin Ameri-
can country which still has troops in [Iraq].
Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican
Republic have withdrawn their troops [∅].

From a semantic processing perspective, a human
reader can easily infer that “Iraq”, the marked en-
tity in the first sentence of Example (1), is also an
implicit argument of the predicate “withdraw” in the
second sentence. This inference step is, however,
difficult to model computationally as it involves an
interplay of two challenging sub-tasks: first, a se-
mantic processor has to determine that an argument
is not realized (but inferrable); and second, a suit-

306



able antecedent has to be found within the discourse
context. For the remainder of this paper, we refer to
these steps as identifying and linking implicit argu-
ments to discourse antecedents.

As indicated by Example (1), implicit arguments
are an important aspect in semantic processing, yet
they are not captured in traditional semantic role la-
beling systems. The main reasons for this are the
scarcity of annotated data, and the inherent difficulty
of inferring discourse antecedents automatically.

In this paper, we propose to induce implicit ar-
guments and discourse antecedents by exploiting
complementary (explicit) information obtained from
monolingual comparable texts (Section 3). We ap-
ply the empirically acquired data in argument link-
ing (Section 4) and coherence modeling (Section 5).
We conclude with a discussion on the advantages of
our data set and outline directions for future work
(Section 6).

2 Related work

The most prominent approach to entity-based coher-
ence modeling nowadays is the entity grid model by
Barzilay and Lapata (2005). It has originally been
proposed for automatic sentence ordering but has
also been applied in coherence evaluation and read-
ability assessment (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008; Pitler
and Nenkova, 2008), and story generation (McIntyre
and Lapata, 2009). Based on the original model,
a few extensions have been proposed: for exam-
ple, Filippova and Strube (2007) and Elsner and
Charniak (2011b) suggested additional features to
characterize semantic relatedness between entities
and features specific to single entities, respectively.
Other entity-based approaches to coherence model-
ing include the pronoun model by Charniak and El-
sner (2009) and the discourse-new model by Elsner
and Charniak (2008). All of these approaches are,
however, based on explicitly realized entity men-
tions only, ignoring references that are inferrable.

The role of implicit arguments has been studied
early on in the context of semantic processing (Fill-
more, 1986; Palmer et al., 1986). Yet, the phe-
nomenon has mostly been ignored in semantic role
labeling. First data sets, focusing on implicit argu-
ments, have only recently become available: Rup-
penhofer et al. (2010) organized a SemEval shared

task on “linking events and participants in dis-
course”, Gerber and Chai (2012) made available im-
plicit argument annotations for the NomBank corpus
(Meyers et al., 2008) and Moor et al. (2013) pro-
vide annotations for parts of the OntoNotes corpus
(Weischedel et al., 2011). However, these resources
are very limited: The annotations by Moor et al. and
Gerber and Chai are restricted to 5 and 10 predi-
cate types, respectively. The training set of the Se-
mEval task contains only 245 resolved implicit argu-
ments in total. As pointed out by Silberer and Frank
(2012), additional training data can be heuristically
created by treating anaphoric mentions as implicit
arguments. Their experimental results showed that
artificial training data can indeed improve results,
but only when obtained from corpora with manual
semantic role annotations (on the sentence level) and
gold coreference chains.

3 Identifying and linking implicit
arguments

The aim of this work is to automatically construct
a data set of implicit arguments and their discourse
antecedents. We propose an induction approach that
exploits complementary information obtained from
pairs of comparable texts. As a basis for this ap-
proach, we rely on several preparatory steps pro-
posed in the literature that first identify informa-
tion two documents have in common (cf. Figure 1).
In particular, we align corresponding predicate-
argument structures (PAS) using graph-based clus-
tering (Roth and Frank, 2012b). We then determine
co-referring entities across the texts using corefer-
ence resolution techniques on concatenated docu-
ment pairs (Lee et al., 2012). These preprocessing
steps are described in more detail in Section 3.1.

Given the preprocessed comparable texts and
aligned PAS, we propose to heuristically iden-
tify implicit arguments and link them to their
antecedents via the cross-document coreference
chains. We describe the details of this approach in
Section 3.2.
3.1 Data preparation
The starting point for our approach is the data set of
automatically aligned predicate pairs that has been
released by Roth and Frank (2012a).1 This data

set, henceforth just R&F data, is a collection of
283,588 predicate pairs that have been aligned “with
high precision”2 across comparable newswire arti-
cles from the Gigaword corpus (Parker et al., 2011).
To use these documents for our argument induc-
tion technique, we apply a couple of pre-processing
tools on each single document and perform cross-
document entity coreference on pairs of documents.

Single document pre-processing. We apply sev-
eral preprocessing steps to all documents in
the R&F data: we use the Stanford CoreNLP
package3 for tokenization and sentence split-
ting. We then apply MATE tools (Bohnet, 2010;
Björkelund et al., 2010), including the integrated
PropBank/NomBank-style semantic parser, to re-
construct local predicate-argument structures for
aligned predicates. Finally, we resolve pronouns that
occur in a PAS using the coreference resolution sys-
tem by Martschat et al. (2012).

2The used method achieved a precision of 86.2% at a recall
of 29.1% on the Roth and Frank (2012a) test set.

Cross-document coreference. We apply cross-
document coreference resolution to induce an-
tecedents for implicit arguments. In practice, we
use the Stanford Coreference System (Lee et al.,
2013) and run it on pairs of texts by simply pro-
viding a single document as input, comprising of a
concatenation of the two texts. To perform this step
with high precision, we only use the most precise
resolution sieves: “String Match”, “Relaxed String
Match”, “Precise Constructs”, “Strict Head Match
[A-C]”, and “Proper Head Noun Match”.

3.2 Identification and linking approach
Given a pair of aligned predicates from two compa-
rable texts, we examine the parser output to identify
the arguments in each predicate-argument structure
(PAS). We compare the set of realized argument po-
sitions in both structures to determine whether one
PAS contains an argument position (explicit) that
has not been realized in the other PAS (implicit).
For each implicit argument, we identify appropri-
ate antecedents by considering the cross-document
coreference chain of its explicit counterpart. As our
goal is to link arguments within discourse, we re-
strict candidate antecedents to mentions that occur
in the same document as the implicit argument.

We apply a number of restrictions to the resulting
pairs of implicit arguments and antecedents to mini-
mize the impact of errors from preprocessing:

- The aligned PAS should consist of a different
number of arguments (to minimize the impact
of argument labeling errors)

- The antecedent should not be a resolved pro-
noun (to avoid errors resulting from incorrect
pronoun resolution)

- The antecedent should not be in the same sen-
tence as the implicit argument (to circumvent
cases, in which an implicit argument is actu-
ally explicit but has not been recognized by the
parser)

3.3 Resulting data set
We apply the identification and linking approach to
the full R&F data set of aligned predicates. As a re-
sult, we induce a total of 701 implicit argument and
antecedent pairs, each in a separate document, in-
volving 535 different predicates. Examples are dis-
played in Table 1. Note that 701 implicit arguments
from 283,588 pairs of predicate-argument structures
seem to represent a fairly low recall. Most predicate
pairs in the high precision data set of Roth and Frank
(2012a) do, however, consist of identical argument
positions (84.5%). In the remaining cases, in which
an implicit argument can be identified (15.5%), an
antecedent in discourse cannot always be found us-
ing the high precision coreference sieves. This does
not mean that implicit arguments are a rare phe-
nomenon in general. In fact, 38.9% of all manually
aligned predicate pairs in Roth and Frank (2012a)
involved a different number of arguments.

We manually evaluated a subset of 90 induced im-
plicit arguments and found 80 discourse antecedents
to be correct (89%). Some incorrectly linked in-
stances still result from preprocessing errors. In Ta-
ble 2, we present a range of different error types that
occurred when extracting implicit arguments with-
out any restrictions.

4 Experiment 1: Linking implicit
arguments

Our first experiment assesses the utility of automat-
ically induced implicit arguments and antecedent
pairs for the task of implicit argument linking. For
evaluation, we use the data sets from the SemEval
2010 task on Linking Events and their Participants
in Discourse (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010, henceforth
just SemEval). For direct comparison with previous
results and heuristic acquisition techniques (cf. Sec-
tion 2), we apply the implicit argument identifica-
tion and linking model by Silberer and Frank (2012,
henceforth S&F) for training and testing.

4.1 Task summary
Both the training and test sets of the SemEval task
are text corpora extracted from Sherlock Holmes
novels, with manual frame semantic annotations in-
cluding implicit arguments. In the actual linking
task (“NI-only”), labels are provided for local argu-
ments and participating systems have to perform the

following three sub-tasks: (1) identify implicit argu-
ments (IA), (2) predict whether each IA is resolvable
and, if so, (3) find an appropriate antecedent.

The task organizers provide two versions of their
data sets: one based on FrameNet annotations and
one based on PropBank/NomBank annotations. We
found that the latter, however, only contains a sub-
set of the implicit argument annotations from the
FrameNet-based version. As all previous results in
this task have been reported on the FrameNet data
set, we adopt the same setting. Note that our addi-
tional training data is automatically labeled with a
PropBank/NomBank-style parser. That is, we need
to map our annotations to FrameNet. The organizers
of the SemEval shared task provide a manual map-
ping dictionary for predicates in the annotated data
set. We make use of this manual mapping and ad-
ditionally use SemLink 1.14 for mapping predicates
and arguments not in the dictionary.

4.2 Model details

We make use of the system by S&F to train a new
model for the NI-only task. As mentioned in the pre-
vious sub-section, this task consists of three steps:
In step (1), implicit arguments are identified as un-
filled FrameNet core roles that are not competing
with roles that are already filled; in step (2), a SVM
classifier is used to predict whether implicit argu-
ments are resolvable based on a small amount of
features – semantic type of the affected Frame Ele-
ment, the relative frequency of its realization type in
the SemEval training corpus, and a boolean feature
that indicates whether the affected sentence is in pas-
sive voice and does not contain a (deep) subject. In
step (3), we apply the same features and classifier as
S&F, i.e., the BayesNet implementation from Weka
(Witten and Frank, 2005), to find appropriate an-
tecedents for (predicted) resolvable arguments. S&F
report that their best results were obtained when
considering all entities as candidate antecedents that
are syntactic constituents from the present and the
past two sentences, or entities that occurred at least
five times in the previous discourse (“Chains+Win”
setting). In their evaluation, the latter of these two
restrictions crucially depended on gold coreference
chains. As the automatic coreference chains in our

data are rather sparse (and noisy), we only consider
syntactic constituents from the present and the past
two sentences as antecedents (“SentWin” setting).

Before training and testing a new model with
our own data, we perform feature selection us-
ing 10-fold cross validation. We run the feature
selection on a combination of the SemEval train-
ing data and our additional data set in order to
find a set of features that generalizes best across
the two different corpora. We found these to be
features regarding “prominence”, selectional pref-
erences (“sp supersense”), the POS tags of entity
mentions, and semantic types of argument positions
(“semType dni.entity”). Note that the S&F system
does not make use of any lexicalized information.
Instead, semantic features are computed based on
the highest abstraction level in WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998). For detailed description of all features, see
Silberer and Frank (2012).

4.3 Results

For direct comparison in the full task, both with
S&F’s model and other previously published results,
we adopt the precision, recall and F1 measures as
defined in Ruppenhofer et al. (2010). We compare
our results with those previously reported on the Se-
mEval task (see Table 3 for a summary): Chen et
al. (2010) adapted SEMAFOR, the best performing
system that participated in the actual task in 2010.
Tonelli and Delmonte (2011) presented a revised
version of their SemEval system (Tonelli and Del-
monte, 2010), which outperformed SEMAFOR in
terms of recall (6%) and F1 score (8%). The best
results in terms of recall and F1 score up to date
have been reported by Laparra and Rigau (2012),
with 25% and 19%, respectively. Our model outper-
forms their state-of-the-art system in terms of preci-
sion (21%) but at a higher cost of recall (8%). Two

influencing factors for their high recall are probably
(1) their improved method for identifying (resolv-
able) implicit arguments, and (2) their addition of
lexicalized and ontological features.

Comparison to the original results reported by
S&F, whose system we use, shows that our addi-
tional data improves precision (from 6% to 21%)
and F1 score (from 7% to 12%). The loss in recall
is marginal (-1%) given the size of the test set (259
resolvable cases in total). The result in precision is
the second highest score reported on this task. Inter-
estingly, the improvements are higher than those of
the best training set used in the original study by Sil-
berer and Frank (2012), even though their additional
data set is three times bigger than ours and is based
on manual semantic annotations. We conjecture that
their low gain in precision could be a side effect trig-
gered by two factors: on the one hand, their model
crucially relies on coreference chains, which are au-
tomatically generated for the test set and hence are
rather noisy. On the other hand, their heuristically
created training data might not represent implicit ar-
gument instances adequately.

5 Experiment 2: Implicit arguments in
coherence modeling

In our second experiment, we examine the effect of
implicit arguments on local coherence, i.e., the ques-
tion of how well a local argument (non-)realization
fits into a given context. We approach this question
as follows: first, we assemble a data set of document
pairs that differ only with respect to a single realiza-
tion decision (Section 5.1). Given each pair in this
data set, we ask human annotators to indicate their
preference for the implicit or explicit argument re-
alization in the pre-specified context (Section 5.2).
Second, we attempt to emulate the decision pro-
cess computationally using a discriminative model
based on discourse and entity-specific features (Sec-
tion 5.3).

5.1 Data compilation

We use the induced data set (henceforth source
data), as described in Section 3, as a starting point
for composing a set of document pairs that involve
implicit and explicit arguments. To make sure that
each document pair in this data set only differs with
respect to a single realization decision, we first cre-
ate two copies of each document from the source
data: one copy remains in its original form, and the
other copy will be modified with respect to a sin-
gle argument realization. Example (2) illustrates an
example of an original and modified (marked by an
asterik) sentence:

(2) [The Dalai Lama’sA0] visit [to FranceA1] ends
on Tuesday.

* [The Dalai Lama’sA0] visit ends on Tuesday.

Note that adding and removing arguments at ran-
dom can lead to structures that are semantically
implausible. Hence, we restrict this procedure to
predicate-argument structures (PAS) that actually
occur and are aligned across two texts, and create
modifications by replacing a single argument posi-
tion in one text with the corresponding argument po-
sition in the comparable text. Examples (2) and (3)

file that contained more instances.

show two such comparable texts. The original PAS
in Example (2) contains an explicit argument that is
implicit in the aligned PAS and hence removed in
the modified version. Vice versa, the original text
in (3) involves an implicit argument, which is made
explicit in the modified version.

(3) [The Dalai Lama’sA0] visit coincides with the
Beijing Olympics.

* [The Dalai Lama’sA0] visit [to FranceA1] co-
incides with the Beijing Olympics.

We ensure that the modified structure fits into
the given context grammatically by only consid-
ering PAS with identical predicate form and con-
stituent order. We found that this restriction con-
strains affected arguments to be modifiers, prepo-
sitional phrases and direct objects. We argue that
this is actually a desirable property because more
complicated alternations could affect coherence by
themselves; resulting interplays would make it diffi-
cult to distinguish between the isolated effect of ar-
gument realization itself and other effects, triggered
for example by sentence order (Gordon et al., 1993).

5.2 Annotation
We set up a web experiment using the NLTK pack-
age (Belz and Kow, 2011) to collect (local) coher-
ence ratings for implicit and explicit arguments. For
this experiment, we compiled a data set of 150 doc-
ument pairs. As described in Section 5.1, each text
pair consists of mostly the same text, with the only
difference being one argument realization.

We presented all 150 pairs to two annotators7 and
asked them to indicate their preference for one al-
ternative over the other using a continuous slider
scale. The annotators got to see the full texts, with
the alternatives presented next to each other. To
make texts easier to read and differences easier to
spot, we collapsed all identical sentences into one
column and highlighted the aligned predicate (in
both texts) and the affected argument (in the explicit
case). An example is shown in Figure 2. To avoid
any bias in the annotation process, we shuffled the
sequence of text pairs and randomly assigned the
side of display (left/right) of each realization type

tional Linguistics.

(explicit/implicit). Note that instead of providing a
definition of local coherence ourselves, we simply
asked the annotators to rate how “natural” a realiza-
tion sounds given the discourse context.

We found that annotators made use of the full rat-
ing scale, which spans from -50 to +50, with the ex-
tremes indicating either a strong preference for the
text on the left hand side or the right hand side, re-
spectively. Most ratings are, however, concentrated
more towards the center of the scale (i.e., around
zero). This seems to imply that the use of im-
plicit or explicit arguments did not make a consid-
erable difference most of the time. The first author
confirmed this assumption and resolved disagree-
ments between annotators in several group discus-
sions. The annotators also affirmed that some cases
do not read naturally when a specific argument is or
is not realized at a given position in discourse. Ex-
amples (4) and (5) illustrate two cases, in which a
redundant argument is realized (A4, or destination)
or a coherence establishing argument has been omit-
ted (A2, or co-signer).8

ing the agreement of intent [∅].

Following discussions with the annotators, we
discarded all items from the final data set, for which
no clear preference could be established (72%) or
the annotators had different preferences (9%). We
mapped all remaining items into two classes accord-
ing to whether the affected argument had to be im-
plicit (9 texts) or explicit (20 texts). All 29 uniquely
classified texts are used as a small gold standard test
set for evaluation.

5.3 Coherence model

We model the decision process that underlies the
(non-)realization of arguments using a SVM classi-
fier and a range of discourse features. The features
can be classified into three groups: features specific
to the affected predicate-argument structure (Parg),
the (automatic) coreference chain of the affected ar-
gument (Coref), and the discourse context (Disc).

Parg includes the absolute and relative number of
realized arguments; the number of modifiers in the
PAS; and the total length (in words) of the PAS and
the complete sentence.

Coref includes the number of previous/follow-up
mentions in a fixed sentence window; the distance
(in number of words/sentences) to the previous/next
mention; the distribution of occurrences over the
previous/succeeding two sentences;9 and the POS of
previous/follow-up mentions.

Disc includes the total number of coreference
chains in the text; the occurrence of pronouns
in the current sentence; lexical repetitions in the
previous/follow-up sentence; the current position in
discourse (begin, middle, end); and a feature indi-
cating whether the affected argument occured in the
first sentence.

Note that most of these features overlap with
those successfully applied in previous work. For
example, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) also use text

9This type of feature is very similar to the transition pat-
terns in the original entity grid. The only difference is that our
features are not typed with respect to the grammatical function
of explicit realizations. The reason for skipping this informa-
tion lies in the insignificant amount of relevant samples in our
(noisy) training data.

length, sentence-to-sentence transitions, word over-
lap and pronoun occurrences as features for predict-
ing readability. Our own contribution lies in the defi-
nition of PAS-specific features and the adaptation of
all features to the task of predicting (non-)realization
of arguments in a predicate-argument structure.

5.4 Training data

We do not make use of any manually annotated data
for training. Instead, our model relies solely on the
automatically induced source data, described in Sec-
tion 3, for learning. We prepare this data set as fol-
lows: first, we remove all data points that also occur
in the test set. Second, we split all pairs of texts into
two groups – texts that contain a predicate-argument
structure in which an implicit argument has been
identified (IA), and their comparable counterparts
that contain the aligned PAS with an explicit argu-
ment (EA). All texts are labelled according to their
group. For all texts in group EA, we remove the ex-
plicit argument from the aligned PAS. This way, the
feature extractor always gets to see the text and au-
tomatic annotations as if the realization decision had
not been performed and can thus extract unbiased
feature values for the affected entity and argument
position.

5.5 Evaluation setting

The goal of this task is to correctly predict the re-
alization type (implicit or explicit) of an argument
that maximizes the coherence of the document. As
a proxy for coherence, we use the naturalness rat-
ings given by our annotators. We evaluate classifica-
tion performance on the part of our test set for which
clear preferences have been established. We report
results in terms of precision, recall and F1 score. We
compute precision as the fraction of correct classifier
decisions divided by the total number of classifica-
tions; and recall as the fraction of correct classifier
decisions divided by the total number of test items.
Note that precision and recall are identical when the
model provides a class label for every test item. We
compute F1 as the harmonic mean between precision
and recall.

For comparison with previous work, we further
apply a couple of previously proposed local co-
herence models: the original entity grid model by
Barzilay and Lapata (2005), a modified version that

uses topic models (Elsner and Charniak, 2011a) and
an extended version that includes entity-specific fea-
tures (Elsner and Charniak, 2011b). We further ap-
ply the discourse-new model by Elsner and Charniak
(2008) and the pronoun-based model by Charniak
and Elsner (2009). For all of the aforementioned
models, we use their respective implementation pro-
vided with the Brown Coherence Toolkit10. Note
that the toolkit only returns one coherence score for
each document. To use the toolkit for argument clas-
sification, we use two documents per data point –
one that contains the affected argument explicitly
and one that does not (implicit argument) – and treat
the higher scoring variant as classification output. If
both documents achieve the same score, we neither
count the test item as correctly nor as incorrectly
classified. In contrast, we apply our own model only
on the document that contains the implicit argument,
and use the classifier to predict whether this realiza-
tion type fits into the given context or not. Note that
our model has an advantage here because it is specif-
ically designed for this task. Yet, all models com-
pute local coherence ratings based on entity occur-
rences and should thus be able to predict which re-
alization type coheres best with the given discourse
context.11

5.6 Results

The results are summarized in Table 4. As all mod-
els provided class labels for almost all test instances,
we focus our discussion on F1 scores. The majority
class in our test set is the explicit realization type,
making up 20 of the 29 test items (69%).

The original entity grid model produced differing
scores for the two realization types only in 26 cases.
The model exhibits a strong preference for the im-
plicit realization type: it predicts this class in 22
cases, resulting in an F1 score of only 15%. Tak-
ing a closer look at the features of the model reveals
that this an expected outcome: in its original set-
ting, the entity grid learns realization patterns in the
form of sentence-to-sentence transitions. Most enti-
ties are, however, only mentioned a few times in a

10cf. http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/%7Emelsner/
11Recall that input document pairs are identical except for the

affected argument position. Consequently, the resulting coher-
ence scores only differ with respect to affected entity realiza-
tions.

text, which means that non-realizations make up the
‘most probable’ class – independently of whether
they are relevant in a given context or not. The mod-
els by Charniak and Elsner (2009) and Elsner and
Charniak (2011a), which are not based on an entity
grid, do not suffer from this effect and achieve bet-
ter results, with F1 scores of 38% and 48%, respec-
tively. The topical and entity-specific refinements to
the entity grid model also alleviate the bias towards
non-realizations, resulting in improved F1 scores of
18% and 34%, respectively.

To counter-balance this issue altogether, we train
a simplified version of our own model that only
uses features that involve occurrence patterns. The
main difference between this simplified model and
the original entity grid model lies in the different
use of training data: while entity grid models treat
all non-realized items equally, our model gets to
“see” actual examples of entities that are implicit.
In other words, our simplified model takes into ac-
count implicit mentions of entities, not only explicit
ones. The results show that this extra information
has a significant (p<0.01, using a randomization test
(Yeh, 2000)) impact on test set performance, basi-
cally raising F1 from 15% to 83%. Using all features
of our model further increases F1 score to 90%, the
highest score achieved overall.

The highest weighted features in our model in-
clude all three feature groups: for example, the

number of coreferent mentions within the preceed-
ing/following two sentences (Coref), the number
of words already realized in the affected predicate-
argument structure (Parg), and the total number of
coreference chains in the document (Disc).

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to ac-
curately induce implicit arguments and discourse an-
tecedents from comparable texts (cf. Section 3). We
demonstrated the benefit of this kind of data for link-
ing implicit arguments and modeling local coher-
ence. Our experiments revealed three particularly
interesting results.

Firstly, a small data set of (automatically induced)
implicit arguments can have a greater impact on ar-
gument linking models than a bigger data set of ar-
tificially created instances (cf. Section 4). Secondly,
the use of implicit vs. explicit arguments, while be-
ing a subtle difference in most contexts, can have a
clear impact on text ratings. Thirdly, our automat-
ically created training data enables models to learn
features that considerably improve prediction of lo-
cally coherent argument realizations (cf. Section 5).

For the task of implicit argument linking, more
training data will be needed to further advance
the state-of-the-art. Our method for inducing
this kind of data, by exploiting aligned predicate-
argument structures from comparable texts, has
shown promising results. Future work will have
to explore this direction more fully, for example,
by identifying ways to induce data with higher re-
call. Integrating argument (non-)realization into a
full model of local coherence also remains part of
future work. In this paper, we presented a suitable
basis for such work: a training set that contains em-
pirical data on implicit arguments in discourse; and
a feature set that models argument realization with
high accuracy.
