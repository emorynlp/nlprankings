Abstract

This paper describes the fuzzy boundaries between support verb constructions (SVC) with ter
“have” and dar “give” and causative operator verb (VopC) constructions involving these same
verbs, in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), which form a complex set of relations: (i) both verbs are
the support verb of the same noun (SVC); (ii) dar is the standard (active-like) SVC while ter
is a converse (passive-like) SVC; and (iii) dar is a VopC, operating on a ter SVC. In this paper
we have systematically studied these complex relations involving SVC and VopC for BP, which
constitute a challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and have been often ig-
nored in related work. The paper proposes a lexically-based strategy to implement SVC in a
fully-fledged, rule-based parsing system, yielding an adequate semantic structure of the events
(predicates) denoted by predicative nouns in SVC.

1 Introduction: basic concepts and a little history

The notion of support verb has been in use for a long time, under many different theoretical perspectives
and various terminologies. In this paper, we adopt the Zellig S. Harris’s (1991) transformational operator
grammar framework. As early as 1964, Harris (1964, p.216-7) proposed the concept and named this
particular type of construction as “U operator” nominalizations, linking sentences such as He studies
eclipes = He makes studies of eclipses. It was, however, M. Gross (1981) who first provided the definition
of support verb we will rely upon here. The support verb make (in the example above) can be seen as
a sort of an auxiliary of the predicative noun studies, in charge of carrying the grammatical values of
tense and person-number agreement that the noun is morphologically unable to express. In many cases,
support verbs are practically devoid of meaning. For lack of space, we cannot detail further the properties
of SVC, and only the briefest outline is provided here; a good overview can be found in (Gross, 1996;
Gross, 1998; Lamiroy, 1998).

One of the most important theoretical contribution of the notion of support verb came from the fact
that it provides a natural framework to adequately include in the kernel sentences of the language the
large number of ‘abstract’ nouns, which do not have neither a verbal nor an adjectival counterpart; that
is, they are isolated or autonomous nouns, lacking any nominalizations (in a synchronic perspective,
at least). This phenomenon is particularly evident in Romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese,
Romanian and Spanish): FR: Jean a fait grève “Jean did strike”; IT: Giovanni ha fatto sciopero “id.”;
PT: O João fez greve “id.”; RU: Ioan a făcut grevă “id.”; SP: Joan hizo huelga “id.”; cp. EN: *John did
strike, John was on strike).

Finally, nominal constructions are unlike any other predicative part-of-speech by the fact that predica-
tive nouns can present more than one construction with different support verbs, while still expressing the
same semantic predicate. Hence, for example, greve “strike” can have a SVC with both fazer “to make”
(as above) and estar em “to be in”: O João está em greve “João is on strike” (Ranchhod, 1990). Each
SVC has its own specific properties, e.g. only SVC with fazer can undergo passive, while the general
predicate remains the same.

In this paper, we also consider the concept of operator verb (VopC), introduced in the same paper
(Gross, 1981, p. 23-39); two relatively clear situations were distinguished:

• a causative operator verb (VopC), which adds a new element to an elementary sentence; this ele-
ment has an easily identifiable meaning: CAUSE; distributionally, this element suffers very loose
constraints (and we define this as a distributionally non constraint position (Nnr)); if the base sen-
tence under the operator is a support verb construction 1, the VopC may “absorb” the support verb
and it may also introduce some formal changes in that sentence 1;

(1) Isso dá # Max tem (fome + medo + sede). 1 “This gives # Max has (hungry + fear + thirst).”

(2) Isso dá (fome + medo + sede) em Max. “This gives Max (hungry + fear + thirst).”

In (2), the support verb ter is absorbed under the operator dar and its subject becomes a dative, indirect
complement, though the semantic roles of subject of dar (CAUSE) and of the subject of the predicative
noun (EXPERIENCER), after this restructuring, remain the same.

• a linking operator-verb (VopL), which hardly modifies the meaning of the underlying sentence; it
also adds an argument to the base sentence 1, but this is not a new one since it is bounded linked to
a noun complement of the base sentence 1 (Ranchhod, 1990).

(3) Max tem # Ana está sob o controle do Max. “Max has # Ana is under Max’s control.”

(4) = Maxi tem Ana sob o (seui + *meu + *teu) controle. “Maxi has Ana under (hisi + *my + *your)
control.”

This paper reports an ongoing research to systematically classify the predicative nouns built with the
support verbs dar and ter in Brazilian Portuguese (Rassi and Vale, 2013; Santos-Turati, 2012). Similar
work has already been developed for the European variety (Vaza, 1988; Ranchhod, 1990; Baptista, 1997;
Baptista, 2005). For many languages, including Portuguese, the studies on support verb constructions
and causative constructions use a lexical approach, aiming at building dictionaries or lists of predicative
nouns or at identifying those constructions (semi)automatically, e.g. for Portuguese (Hendrickx et al.,
2010; Duran et al., 2011), for English (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), for German (Hanks et al., 2006;
Storrer, 2007) and many other languages. As far as we could ascertain, no implementation of these SVC
constructions has been made yet in NLP systems, particularly in parsers. Most systems considering these
constructions just treat them as multiword expressions, ignoring their internal syntactic structure.

In this paper, we will show the complex set of relations involved in these SVC, where these verbs
can function not only as support but also as operator verbs, thus rendering their description remarkably
complex, particularly in view of Natural Language Processing. We aim at capturing the syntactic de-
pendencies involved in these expressions, not as multiword, fixed strings, but as analyzable syntactic
structures.

The paper is structured as follows: Next, Section 2 presents the current state of the collection and
classification if these SVC in Brazilian Portuguese; Section 3 illustrates the syntactic-semantic relations
between different constructions of ter and dar; Section 4 proposes a strategy for implementing the data in
a rule-based parsing system; and, finally, Section 5 presents some concluding remarks and perspectives
on future work.

2 Support verb constructions with ter “have” and dar “give”

The predicative nouns in this paper select the support verbs dar “give” and ter “have”, and were retrieved
from previous lists of predicative nouns in European Portuguese (Vaza, 1988; Baptista, 1997) and from
the PLN.BR Full corpus (Bruckschein et al., 2008). This corpus contains 103,080 texts, with 29 million
tokens, consisting of news pieces from Folha de São Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper (from 1994 to 2005).
All these constructions were validated in real data, and in some cases also ressourcing to the web.

1In the examples, elements between brackets and separated by the ‘+’ sign can all appear in that given syntactic slot. The
symbol ‘#’ delimits clauses, while the ‘*’ mark signals the sentence as unacceptable. Correferent elements are linked by
correference indexes i. For clarity, all support verbs will be shown without italics in the examples. An approximate translation
of Portuguese examples is provided, but its acceptability is irrelevant for the paper.

2.1 Nominal predicates with support verb ter “have”
We adopted several criteria that allowed us to constitute lexical-syntactic, relatively homogeneous,
classes. These criteria were inspired in those taken from previous classifications, developed in the
Lexicon-grammar framework of Maurice Gross (1975; 1988; 1996), for both Portuguese and other lan-
guages. The main classification criteria can be summarized as follows: (i) the number of arguments,
considering constructions with a subject and one or two essential complements as arguments; (ii) the
possibility of a noun admitting a sentential construction (in subject or complement position); (iii) the
distributional nature of the arguments: if they are obligatorily human or allow for non-human nouns; (iv)
the property of symmetry 2 between the arguments.

Following these criteria, we have so far classified around 1,000 nominal constructions from a list with
3,000 candidates of predicative nouns censed in the corpus (Santos-Turati, 2012). The already classified
nominal predicates that select the support verb ter “have” in Brazilian Portuguese were divided into 9
classes (Table 1) 3.

TOTAL 1,005

Table 1: SVC with support verb ter (Santos-Turati, 2012)

2.2 Nominal predicates with support verb dar “give”
The same criteria were also adopted for SVC with verb dar “give” (Rassi and Vale, 2013), though
two differences were considered: (i) the constructions with a body-part noun (Npc) as argument were
distinguished as a special class for their particular properties; and (ii), no symmetric constructions were
found. We classified 900 support verb constructions with verb dar “give” in Brazilian Portuguese into
11 classes (Table 2).

3 Relations between ter “have” and dar “give”

First of all, it is necessary to distinguish three different kinds of relations established between verb dar
and verb ter constructions. The first type of relation considers the verbs dar “give” and ter “have” as
synonymous and classified as standard support verb constructions. The verb dar can replace the verb ter
without any changes in the meaning of the sentence or in the selection restrictions of the arguments:

2The notion of symmetry in verbal constructions was initially presented by Borillo (1971) for French verbs - Paul rencontre
son frère “Paul meets his brother” / Paul et son frère se rencontrent “Paul and his brother meet”. In the case of the Portuguese
nominal constructions, symmetry was presented in Ranchhod (1990) and Baptista (2005), who described the nominal predicates
with the support verbs estar com and ser de, respectively.

3In Table 1 and Table 2, the left column shows the conventional codes for designating each class; and the second column
represents its syntactic structure, indicated as follows: Nhum and N-hum for human and non-human noun respectively; N±hum
for both human or non-human noun; Npc for body-part noun; the indexes ‘0’ and ‘1’ indicate the subject and the complement
position, respectively; Npred stand for the predicative noun; Prep for preposition; QueF for completive.

Table 2: SVC with support verb dar (Rassi and Vale, 2013)

(5) Ana (deu + teve) um + um(a) (birra + chilique + pirepaque + tremelique + troço).
“Ana (gave + had) (a + an) (tantrum + hissy fit + outburst + shiver + thing).”

The second type of relation concerns the transformation named Conversion by G. Gross (1982; 1989),
in which the predicative noun is maintained and their arguments change their relative position, without,
however, changing their semantic roles. In these constructions, the sentence with AGENT subject is
called the standard construction, while its equivalent sentence with the reversed argument order is called
the converse construction. Usually, the support verbs of the standard and the converse construction are
different, as it is also the preposition introducing the converse complement:

(6) Ana deu algum apoio ao Max. “Ana gave some support to Max.”
[Conv.] = Max teve algum apoio da Ana. “Max had some support from Ana.”

The third kind of relation linking the sentences with the verb ter and the verb dar is the causative
operator construction (already mentioned in §1):
(7) Isso deu # Ana tem coragem. “This gave # Ana has courage.”

= Isso deu coragem à Ana. “This gave courage to Ana.”

These three types of relations are presented in the table below, with an example and the respective
number of constructions in each type. From the intersection between the list of predicative nouns con-
structed with verb ter “have” and those with verb dar “give”, we found 693 predicative nouns, distributed
as shown in Table 3.

3.1 Verbs dar and ter in standard SVC

Around 4.8% of the predicative nouns (35 constructions) accept both support verbs dar and ter in stan-
dard constructions, such as:

(8) A empresa (dá + tem) atenção ao cliente. “The company (gives + has) attention to the client.”

(9) O remédio (dá + tem) um efeito positivo no organismo. “The medicine (gives + has) a positive effect
on human body.”

(10) O resultado (deu + teve) um impacto significativo para o time. “The result (gave + had) a significant
impact to the team.”

In Brazilian Portuguese, around 35 predicative nouns, such as febre “fever” and dengue “dengue”,
besides having both dar and ter as their support verb also allow dar as a causative operator on them
(examples taken from the web):

[VopC]: [Sua lição de casa:] água parada dá dengue. “[...] still water gives (= causes) dengue.”
[CVS dar]: Inclusive, a vizinha também deu dengue. “Inclusive, the neighbour gave (= had) dengue.”
[CVS ter]: O meu esposo já teve dengue. “My husband already had dengue.”

A few nouns (around 10), such as amor “love”, confiança “trust” and respeito “respect”, besides
admitting the two support verbs in their basic construction, also admit ter in a converse construction:

(11) O filho dá respeito à mãe. “The son gives respect to the mother.”
= O filho tem respeito pela mãe. “The son has respect for the mother.”
[conv.] = A mãe tem o respeito do filho. “The mother has respect from her son.”

3.2 Verb dar as standard SVC and ter as converse SVC

Around 10.4% of the predicative nouns (72 constructions) admit the verb dar in the standard construction
and the verb ter in a converse construction, but not ter as a standard support. In Brazilian Portuguese,
predicative nouns constructed with the support verb dar in a standard construction accept other converse
verbs beyond the verb ter “have”, such as receber “receive”, ganhar “gain”, levar “get” and tomar
“take”4.

(12) Ana deu proteção ao Max. “Ana gave protection to Max.”
= Max (teve + recebeu) a proteção da Ana. “Max (had + received) the protection from Ana.”

(13) Ana deu uma ajuda ao Max. “Ana gave a help to Max.”
= Max (teve + ganhou) uma ajuda da Ana. “Max (had + gained) a help from Ana.”

(14) Ana deu uma resposta no Max. “Ana gave an answer to Max.”
= Max (teve + levou) uma resposta da Ana. “Max (had + got) an answer from Ana.”

(15) O policial deu uma multa ao Max. “The officer gave a fine to Max.”
= Max (teve + tomou) uma multa do policial. “Max (had + took) a fine from the officer.”

3.3 Verb dar as VopC and ter as SVC

Around 84.8% (586 predicative nouns) of the elementary constructions with the support verb ter “have”
also allow the causative operator verb dar “give”; some of these nouns constitute relatively homogenous
semantic sets, e.g. the predicative nouns that express <feeling>, <sensation>, <emotion> or those that
indicate <disease> (this semantic classification is just approximative):

4For European Portuguese equivalent converse constructions, see Baptista (1997); for a comparison between the two lan-
guage variants, see Rassi et al. (2014).

96



(16) Ana tem alegria. “Ana has happiness.”
(Zé + A vinda do Zé + O fato de Zé ter voltado + Isso) deu alegria à Ana.
“(Zé + Zé’s coming + The fact of Zé has came + That) gave happiness to Ana.”

(17) Ana tem cólica. “Ana has colic.”
(O chocolate + O fato de ter comido chocolate + Isso) deu cólica na Ana.
“(The chocolat + The fact of she has eaten chocolat + That) gave a colic in Ana.”

These predicative nouns allow a particular (impersonal?) construction with dar, in which the argument
in subject position is not explicit, so the CAUSE element is also absent, and the sentence has the same
overall meaning of the SVC with verb ter standard, but with an inchoative aspect; notice that the verb
dar must be in the 3rd person singular, and it does not agree with the predicative noun:

(18) (Deu + *Deram) (uma) (alegria + cólica) na Ana. “Gives/gave (a) (hapiness + colic) in Ana.”
= Ana teve (uma) (alegria + cólica). “Ana had (a) (hapiness + colic).”

(19) (Deu + ?*Deram) umas (palpitações + cólicas) na Ana. “Gives/gave some (palpitations + colics) in
Ana.”
= Ana teve umas (palpitações + cólicas). “Ana had some (palpitations + colics).”

3.4 Formalization into the Lexicon-Grammar
Because of the complex relations and the different syntactic status that the verbs dar and ter may show,
these constructions are essentially determined by the lexicon, i.e., they depend on the specific predicative
noun. It is only natural that a lexically-based approach be taken in order to describe this properties, partic-
ularly in view of the implementation of such type of expressions in NLP systems. The Lexicon-Grammar
framework constitutes such a methodological setting, as it presupposes the extensive and systematical
survey and formal representation of the lexicon properties.

In the Lexicon-Grammar, a systematic description of linguistic phenomena is usually presented in
the form of binary matrices: the lines contain the lexical entries while the columns represent syntactic-
semantic properties of each entry. For example, for each predicative noun, distributional constraints
on the arguments are represented; the elementary support verb and the main variants of this verb are
encoded; the possibility of accepting conversion and the converse support verbs are explicitly provided;
and all these syntactic-semantic informations are specified for each predicative noun. Besides its intrinsic
linguistic interest, the main purpose for this formalization requirements is the application of the data in
NLP. In the next section, we present a preliminary proposal for the implementation problems of these
type of SVC in a rule-based parsing system of Portuguese.

4 Towards the implementation of SVC in a NLP system

Besides its linguistic interest, one of the goals of the formal representation of the lexical properties of
predicative nouns and SVC into a Lexicon-Grammar such as described above (§3.4) is to allow for the
implementation of these data in NLP systems. In this section an outline of the strategy adopted for
its implementation specifically into a rule-based system, namely STRING (Mamede et al., 2012) 5, is
presented. This is still an on-going work, so in the next lines we briefly sketch the system’s architecture
(§4.1.) and then (§4.2.) we present the strategy that we intend to implement for the adequate parsing of
SVC with ter and dar, having in mind the complex structures and relations mentioned in §3.
4.1 STRING architecture
STRING is an NLP chain with a modular structure that executes all the basic processing tasks, namely:
tokenization and text segmentation, part-of-speeh tagging, morphosyntactic disambiguation, shallow
parsing (chuking) and deep parsing (dependency extraction). The parsing stage is performed by the
rule-based parser XIP (Xerox Incremental Parser) (Mokhtar et al., 2002). XIP identifies the elementary

5http://string.l2f.inesc-id.pt/

97



constituents of a sentence, such as noun phrases (NP) or prepositional phrases (PP), and then these are
structured by binary dependencies between them, corresponding to the syntactic relations, such as sub-
ject (SUBJ), direct complement (CDIR) or modifier (MOD). STRING also extracts Named Entities,
performs time expressions identification and normalization, Anaphora Resolution and some Word-Sense
disambiguation (WSD).

At the final stages of parsing, the system extracts the text events (or predicates) and their participants
(arguments). The system currently extracts the EVENT structure for all full verbs and predicative nouns.
In the case of verbs, it associates the events to their participants and circumstances, identifying their
corresponding semantic roles (Talhadas, 2014), based on the sentence parse and the information available
on the Portuguese full verbs Lexicon-Grammar (Baptista, 2012) 6. Hence, for a sentence such as (20),
the system parser extracts the event structure by way of the following dependencies:

(20) Max costuma ler o jornal no café às sextas-feiras. “Max uses to read the newspaper at the caffée on
Fridays.”

EVENT AGENT(ler,Max)

EVENT OBJECT(ler,jornal)

EVENT LOC-PLACE(ler,café)

EVENT TIME-FREQUENCY(ler,a as sextas-feiras)

4.2 Strategy
In the case of a predicative noun in a SVC, one would want the predicative noun also to be captured as an
EVENT, but not the support verb, since its role is basically that of an auxiliary of the noun. However, since
the support verb conveys several important grammatical information, particularly the standard/converse
orientation of the predicate7, a SUPPORT dependency is first extracted, so in sentences such as in (21)
one would get the dependency shown below:

(21) Max deu um beijo na Ana. “Max gave a kiss in Ana.”

SUPPORT STANDARD(beijo,deu)

To do so, one needs to provide the system with the information that dar is the (basic) standard support
verb of the predicative noun beijo “kiss”. It is also necessary to know that in this construction, the
predicative noun is the direct complement (CDIR) of the support verb and that the dative complement
can be introduced, in Brazilian Portuguese, by preposition em “in/on”. The following rules illustrate (in
a simplified way8) the functioning of the rule-based system:

if (CDIR(#1[lemma:dar],#2[lemma:beijo]) & ˜SUPPORT(#2,#?))
SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1,#2)

if (SUPPORT(#1,?))
EVENT[OTHER=+](#1).

if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) &
EVENT[other](#1) & SUBJ(#2,#3))
EVENT[agent-generic=+](#1,#3).

if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) & EVENT[other](#1) &
ˆMOD(#2,#3) & PREPD(#3,?[lemma:em]) )
COMPL(#1,#3),
EVENT[patient=+](#1,#3).

6This semantic role information is still not available for the predicative nouns, but it is currently being encoded.
7The support verb can convey aspectual, modal and even stylistic values, which are encoded in the lexicon and remain

available in the system’s output, even if not necessarily visible in the EVENT representation.
8The rule system should also take into account the distributional constraints on the argument slots, but, for simplicity, we

dismissed it in this paper.

98



if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) & EVENT[other](#1) &
(ˆMOD[dat](#2,#3) || ˆCLITIC(#2,#3[dat]) ) )
CINDIR[dat=˜](#1,#3),
EVENT[patient=+](#1,#3).

The rules read as follows: First, a SUPPORT dependency with the feature VSUP-STANDARD is
extracted when the noun beijo “kiss” is the direct complement of the verb dar “give” (and no other
support verb was extracted yet for that noun); based on this dependency, an EVENT (unary) dependency
is extracted for the predicative noun; then, the subject of the standard support verb is assigned the
agent semantic role (agent-generic in STRING’s terminology); next, the prepositional phrase
modifying (MOD) the support verb and introduced by preposition em “in” is converted into a complement
(COMPL) of the predicative noun and assigned a semantic role of patient; a similar procedure is
used for the dative complement, when reduced to a dative pronominal form, but in this case, instead
of COMPL the CINDIR (indirect complement) dependency is used. All these rules are automatically
produced for each predicative noun, from the information in the Lexicon-Grammar. The corresponding
EVENT structure is represented below:

SUPPORT VSUP-STANDARD(beijo,deu)

EVENT AGENT(beijo,Max)

EVENT PATIENT(beijo,Ana)

For the converse construction 4.2, while the EVENT structure remains the same, the SUPPORT depen-
dency is:

(22) Ana ganhou um beijo do Max. “Ana got a kiss from Max.”

SUPPORT VSUP-CONVERSE(beijo,ganhou)

The converse construction entails the “swapping” of the arguments’ syntactic function, while keeping
their respective semantic roles. The detection of the converse construction triggers a set of rules that
also swap the semantic roles associated to the predicative noun’s syntactic slots. In the case where the
same verb is both the standard and the converse support of a predicative noun, they are both extracted, at
first, and then the presence of prepositional complements or the determiner of the noun can be used for
disambiguation. This will be part of future work as, for the moment, whenever this happens, the converse
construction is discarded. The assigning of semantic roles to the predicative noun’s arguments is then
made only once, and by general rules, both in the standard and in the converse constructions.

The situation is somewhat similar in the case of a causative-operator verb 4.2:

(23) Essa notı́cia deu estresse no Max. “This news gave stress in Max.”

In this case, since the Lexicon-Grammar has encoded that the verb dar can be an operator on ter,
and since the predicative noun estresse “stress” does not allow for dar to be its support, a general rule
can apply, extracting the CAUSE relation expressed by the VopC, in a similar way as for the SUPPORT
dependency. The EVENT structure is thus construed as shown below:

VOPC(estresse,deu)

EVENT(estresse,other)

EVENT EXPERIENCER(estresse,Max)

EVENT CAUSE(estresse,notı́cia)

However, when the same verb can be both a support and an operator verb, in the absence of tell-tale
prepositional complements or other syntactic evidence, the detection of the adequate structure can not be
done at this stage. We found only 35 predicative nouns which can be associated to the verb dar “give”
with both categories, i.e. as a support and a VopC. It is also possible that both dependencies SUPPORT
and CAUSE be extracted in order to disambiguate them at a later stage.

99



5 Conclusions and future work

In the near future, we intend to use the data encoded in the Lexicon-Grammar of these predicative nouns
and build a SVC identification module for STRING. For the moment, the identification of all the syn-
tactic phenomena, constituting as many different parsing cases as possible, is underway, in order to
fully automatize the processing of converting the Lexicon-Grammar tables into the STRING, with XIP-
compliant rules, in a similar way as it has already been done for the verbs (Baptista, 2012; Travanca,
2013; Talhadas, 2014). After implementing all the data in STRING we also intend to evaluate the system
in order to check the extraction of the dependencies involving the support verbs and predicative nouns.

An important task ahead is the systematic comparison of the structures and properties here described
against those of European Portuguese. First of all, the set of nouns available in each variant is not exactly
the same, even if the concepts are shared; for example, carona in BP corresponds to the EP boleia “ride”;
in other cases, the choice of the nominalization suffixes differ: in BP one uses the term parada cardı́aca,
while its equivalent in EP is paragem cardı́aca “cardiac arrest”. False-friends are also common: in BP,
chamada “rebuke” is unrelated to EP chamada “phone call” (but, in this sense, it is also used in BP);
the set of support verbs for each noun are different: as a synonym of rebuke we find the pair dar-levar
(only in BP), while as equivalent to phone call the basic support verbs are fazer-receber (the same in
BP and EP). Naturally, much in both variants is quite similar, though some patterns begin to emerge:
the different choice of prepositions for the complement, mostly the alternation between em “in” in BP
and a “to” in EP (both as dative complements); the choice of support verbs, with some being used for
these predicative noun exclusively in BP (ganhar “gain” and tomar “take”) or in EP (pregar “throw” and
apanhar “take”).
