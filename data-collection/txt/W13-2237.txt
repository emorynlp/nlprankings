Abstract

We present a novel online learning ap-
proach for statistical machine translation
tailored to the computer assisted transla-
tion scenario. With the introduction of
a simple online feature, we are able to
adapt the translation model on the fly
to the corrections made by the transla-
tors. Additionally, we do online adaption
of the feature weights with a large mar-
gin algorithm. Our results show that our
online adaptation technique outperforms
the static phrase based statistical machine
translation system by 6 BLEU points abso-
lute, and a standard incremental adaptation
approach by 2 BLEU points absolute.

1 Introduction

The growing needs of the localization and trans-
lation industry have recently boosted research
around computer assisted translation (CAT) tech-
nology. The purpose of CAT is to increase the pro-
ductivity of a human translator. A CAT tool comes
as a package of a Translation Memory (TM), built-
in spell checkers, a dictionary, a terminology list
etc. which help the translator while translating
a sentence. Recent research has led to the in-
tegration of CAT tools with statistical machine
translation (SMT) engines. SMT makes use of a
large available parallel corpus to generate statisti-
cal models for translation. Due to their generaliza-
tion capability, SMT systems are a good fit in this
scenario and a seamless integration of SMT en-
gines in CAT have shown to increase translator’s
productivity (Federico et al., 2012).

Although automatic systems generate reliable
translations they are not accurate enough to be
used directly and need postedition by human trans-
lators. In state-of-the-art CAT tools, the SMT sys-
tems are static in nature and so they cannot adapt

to these corrections. When a SMT system keeps
repeating the same error, productivity of transla-
tors as well as their trust in SMT technology are
negatively affected. As an example, technical doc-
umentation typically contains a lot of repetitions
due to the employed writing style and pervasive
use of terminology. Hence, in order to provide
useful hints, SMT systems are expected to behave
consistently regarding the translation of domain-
specific terms. However, if the user edits the trans-
lation of a technical term in the target text, most
current SMT systems are incapable to learn from
those corrections.

Online learning is a machine learning task
where a predictor iteratively: (1) receives an input
and outputs a label, (2) receives the correct label
from a human and if the two labels do not match, it
learns from the mistake. The task of learning from
user corrections at the sentence level fits well the
online learning scenario, and its expected useful-
ness is clearly related to the amount of repetitions
occurring in the text. The higher the number of
repetititions in a document the more the SMT sys-
tem has chances to translate consistently through
the use of online learning.

In this paper, we implemented two online learn-
ing methods through which a phrase-based SMT
system evolves over time, sentence after sentence,
by taking advantage of the post-edition or transla-
tion of the previous sentence by the user.1

In the first approach, we focus on the translation
model aspect of SMT which is represented by five
conventional features, namely lexical and phrase
translation probabilities in both directed and in-
verted directions, plus a phrase penalty score.
Translation, language and reordering models are
combined in a linear fashion to obtain a score for

tory. https://github.com/mtresearcher/

the translation hypothesis as shown in Equation 1.

score(e∗, f) = Σiλihi(e∗, f) (1)

where hi(·) are the feature functions representing
the models and λi are the linear weights. The
highest scored translation is the best hypothesis
e∗ output by the system. We extend the transla-
tion model with a new feature which provides ex-
tra phrase-pair scores changing according to the
user feedback. The scores of the new feature are
adapted in a discriminative fashion, by reward-
ing phrase-pairs observed in the search space and
in the reference, and penalizing phrase-pairs ob-
served in the search space but not in the reference.

In the second approach, we also adapt the model
weights of the linear combination after each test
sentence by using a margin infused relaxed algo-
rithm (MIRA).

For assessing the robustness of our methods, we
performed experiments on two datasets from dif-
ferent domains and language pairs (§6). More-
over, our online learning approaches are compared
against a static baseline system and against the in-
cremental adaptation approach proposed by Lev-
enberg et. al. (2010) (§5).

2 Related Works

Several online adaptation strategies have been pro-
posed in the past, only a few deal with adaptation
of post-edited/evaluation data while most works
are on adaptation over development data during
tuning of parameters (Och and Ney, 2003).

2.1 Online Adaptation during Tuning

Liang et. al. (2006) improved SMT perfor-
mance by online adaptation of scaling factors (λ in
(1)) using averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins,
2002). They presented different strategies to up-
date the SMT models towards reference or oracle
translation: (1) aggressively updating towards ref-
erence, bold update; (2) update towards the ora-
cle translation in N-Best list, local update; (3) a
hybrid approach in which a bold update is per-
formed when the reference is reachable, other-
wise a local update is performed. Liang and Klein
(2009) compared two online EM algorithms, step-
wise online EM (Sato and Ishii, 2000; Cappé and
Moulines, 2007) and incremental EM (Neal and
Hinton, 1998) which they use to update the align-
ment models (the generative component of SMT)

on the fly. However, stepwise EM is prone to fail-
ure if mini-batch size and stepsize parameters are
not chosen correctly, while incremental EM re-
quires substantial storage costs because it has to
store sufficient statistics for each sample. Other
works on online minimum error rate training in
SMT (Och and Ney, 2003) that deserve mention-
ing are (Hopkins and May, 2011; Hasler et al.,
2011).

2.2 Online Adaptation during Decoding

Cesa-Bianchi et. al. (2008) proposed an online
learning approach during decoding. They con-
struct a layer of online weights over the regu-
lar feature weights and update these weights at
sentence level using margin infused relaxed algo-
rithm (Crammer and Singer, 2003); to our knowl-
edge, this is the first work on online adaptation
during decoding. Martı́nez-Gómez et. al. (2011;
2012) presented a comparison of online adapta-
tion techniques in post editing scenario. They
compared different adaptation strategies on scal-
ing factors and feature functions (respectively, λ
and h(·) in (1)). However, they modified the fea-
ture values during adaptation without any normal-
ization, which disregards the initial assumption of
the feature values being probabilities.

In our approach, the value of the additional on-
line feature can be modified during decoding with-
out changing other feature values (probabilities)
and thus preserving their probability distribution.

3 Feature Adaptation

In the CAT scenario, the user receives a translation
suggestion for each source segment, post-edits it
and finally approves it. From the SMT point of
view, for each source segment the decoder ex-
plores a search space of possible translations and
finally returns the best scoring one (bestHyp) to
the user. The user possibly corrects this suggestion
thus generating the final translation (postedit).

Our online learning procedure is based on the
following idea. For each N-best translation (candi-
date) in the search space, we compute a similarity
score against the postedit using the sentence-level
BLEU metric (Lin and Och, 2004), a smoothed
variant of the popular BLEU metric (Papineni
et al., 2001). We hence compare the similar-
ity score of each candidate against the similar-
ity score achieved by the bestHyp, that was also
computed against the postedit. If the candidate

302



scores better than the bestHyp, then we promote
the building blocks, i.e. phrase-pairs, of candi-
date that were not used in bestHyp and demote the
phrase-pairs used in bestHyp that were not used
for candidate. On the contrary, if the candidate
scores worse than the bestHyp, we promote the
building blocks of bestHyp that are not in candi-
date and demote those of candidate that are not in
bestHyp.

Our promotion/demotion mechanism could be
implemented by updating the features values of
the phrase pairs used in the candidate and bestHyp
translations. However, features in the translation
models are conditional probabilities and perturb-
ing a subset of them by also preserving their nor-
malization constraints can be computationally ex-
pensive. Instead, we propose to introduce an addi-
tional online feature which represents a goodness
score of each phrase-pair in the test set.

We call the set of phrase pairs used to generate
a candidate as candidatePP and the set of phrase
pairs used to generate the bestHyp as bestPP . The
online feature value of each phrase-pair is initial-
ized to a constant and is updated according to the
perceptron update (Rosenblatt, 1958) method. In
particular, the amount by which a current feature
value is rewarded or penalized depends on a learn-
ing rate α and on the difference between the model
scores (i.e. h ·w) of candidate and bestHyp as cal-
culated by the MT system. A sketch of our online
learning procedure is shown in Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1: Online Learning
foreach sourceSeg do

bestHyp = Translate(sourceSeg);
postedit = Human(bestHyp);
for i = 1 → iterations do

N-best=Nbest(source);
foreach candidate ∈ N-best do

sign = sgn |sBLEU(candidate) -
sBLEU(bestHyp)| ;
foreach phrasePair ∈ candidatePP do

if phrasePair /∈ bestPP then
f i = f i−1 + (α · (∆h · w) ·
sign);

end
end
foreach phrasePair ∈ bestPP do

if phrasePair /∈ candidatePP then
f i = f i−1 - (α · (∆h · w) ·
sign);

end
end

end
end

end

In Algorithm 1, ∆h · w is the above mentioned
score difference as computed by the decoder; mul-
tiplied by α, it is the margin, that is the value with
which the online feature score (f ) of the phrase
pair under processing is modified. We can observe
that the feature scores are unbounded and could
lead to instability of the algorithm; therefore, we
normalise the scores through the sigmoid function:

f(x) =
2

1 + exp(x)
− 1 (2)

4 Weight Adaptation

In addition to adapting the online feature values,
we can also apply online adaptation on the fea-
ture weights of the linear combination (eq. 1). In
particular, after translating each sentence we can
adapt the parameters depending on how good the
last translation was. A commonly used algorithm
in this online paradigm for tuning of parameters is
the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA).

MIRA is an online large margin algorithm that
updates the parameter ŵ of a given model accord-
ing to the loss that is occurred due to incorrect
classification. In the case of SMT this margin
can be coupled with the loss function, which in
this case is the complement of the sentence level
BLEU(sBLEU). Thus, the loss function can be
formulated as:

l(ŷ) = sBLEU(y∗)− sBLEU(ŷ) (3)

where y∗ is the oracle (closest translation to the
reference) and ŷ is the candidate being processed.
Ideally, this loss should correspond to the differ-
ence between the model scores:

∆h · ŵ = score(y∗)− score(ŷ) (4)

MIRA is an ultraconservative algorithm, meaning
that the update of the current weight vector is the
smallest possible value satisfying the constraint
that the variation incurred by the objective func-
tion must not be larger than the variation incurred
by the model (plus a non-negative slack variable
ξ). Formally, weight update at ith iteration is de-
fined as:

wi = argmin
w

||w − wi−1||2︸ ︷︷ ︸

conservative

+ C︸︷︷︸
aggressive

∑

j

ξj

subject to

lj ≤ ∆hj · w + ξj ∀j ∈ J ⊆ {1 . . . N}
(5)

303



where j ranges over all candidates in the N-
best list, lj is the loss between oracle and the
candidate j, and ∆hj · w is the corresponding
difference in the model scores. C is an aggressive
parameter which controls the size of the update, η
is the learning rate of the algorithm and ξ is usu-
ally a very small value (in our experiments we kept
it as 0.0001). After partial differentiation and lin-
earizing the loss, equation 5 can be rewritten as:

wi = wi−1 + η ·
∑

j

αj ·∆hj

where

αj = min

{
C,

lj −∆hj · w
||∆hj ||2

}
(6)

We solve equation 5, by computing α with
the optimizer integrated in the Moses toolkit by
(Hasler et al., 2011). Algorithm 2 gives an
overview of the online margin infused relaxed al-
gorithm we implemented in Moses.

bestHyp = Translate(sourceSeg);

if ∆hj · w + ξj ≥ lj then
αj = Optimize(lj , hj , w, C);
wi = wi−1 + η ·

end
end

end
end

In the following section we overview a stream
based adaptation method with which we exper-
imentally compared our two online learning ap-
proaches as it well fits the framework we are work-
ing in.

5 Stream based adaptation

Continuously updating an SMT system to an in-
coming stream of parallel data comes under stream
based adaptation. Levenberg et. al. (2010) pro-
posed an incremental adaptation technique for the
core generative component of the SMT system,

word alignments and language models (Leven-
berg and Osborne, 2009). To get the word align-
ments on the new data they use a Stepwise online
EM algorithm, where old counts (from previous
alignment models) are interpolated with the new
counts.

Since we work at the sentence level, on-the-
fly computation of probabilities of translation and
reordering models is expensive in terms of both
computational and memory requirements. To save
these costs, we prefer using dynamic suffix ar-
ray approach described in (Levenberg et al., 2010;
Callison-Burch et al., 2005; Lopez, 2008). They
are used to efficiently store the source and the tar-
get corpus and alignments in efficient data struc-
ture, namely the suffix array. When a phrase
translation is asked by the decoder, the corpus is
searched, the counts are collected and its probabil-
ities are computed on the fly. However, the current
implementation in Moses of the stream based MT
relying on the suffix arrays is severely limited as
it allows the computation of only three translation
features, namely the two direct translation proba-
bilities and the phrase penalty. This results in a
significant degradation of performance.

6 Experiments

6.1 Datasets

We compared our online learning approaches
(Sections 3 and 4) and the stream based adapta-
tion method (Section 5) on two datasets from dif-
ferent domains, namely Information Technology
(IT) and TED talks, and two different language
pairs. The IT domain dataset is proprietary, it in-
volves the translation of technical documents from
English to Italian and has been used in the field
test carried out under the MateCat project2. Ex-
periments are also conducted on English to French
TED talks dataset (Cettolo et al., 2012) to assess
the robustness of the proposed approaches in a dif-
ferent scenario and to provide results on a publicly
available dataset for the sake of reproducibility.
The training, development (dev2010) and evalu-
ation (tst20103) sets are the same as used in the
last IWSLT last evaluation campaigns. In experi-
ments on TED data, we considered the human ref-
erence translations as post edits, even if they were

3As the size of evaluation set in TED data is too large with

respect to the current implementation of our algorithms, we
performed evaluation on the first 200 sentences only.

actually generated from scratch.
In our experiments, the extent of usefulness of

online learning highly depends on the amount of
repetition of text. A reasonable way to measure the
quantity of repetition in each document is through
the repetition rate (Bertoldi et al., 2013). It com-
putes the rate of non-singleton n-grams, n=1...4,
averaging the values over sub-samples S of thou-
sand words from the text, and then combining the
rate of each n-gram to a single score by using the
geometric mean. Equation 7 shows the formula
for calculating the repetition rate of a document,
where dict(n) represents the total number of
different n-grams and nr is the number of different
n-grams occurring exactly r times:

RR =

(
4∏

n=1

∑
S dict(n)− n1∑

S dict(n)

)1/4
(7)

Statistics of the parallel sets and their repetition
rate on both sides are reported in Table 1.

It can be noted that the repetition rates of IT
and TED sets are significantly different, partic-
ularly high in IT documents, much lower in the
TED talks.

6.2 Systems

The SMT systems were built using the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). Training data in each
domain was used to create translation and lexical
reordering models. We created a 5-gram LM for
TED talks and a 6-gram LM for the IT domain
using IRSTLM (Federico et al., 2008) with im-
proved Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Good-
man, 1996) on the target side of the training paral-
lel corpora. The log linear weights for the baseline
systems are optimized using MERT (Och, 2003)
provided in the Moses toolkit. To counter the in-
stability of MERT, we averaged the weights of
three MERT runs in each case. Performance is

measured in terms of BLEU and TER (Snover
et al., 2006) computed using the MultEval script
(Clark et al., 2011). Since the implementations of
standard Giza and of incremental Giza combined
with dynamic suffix arrays are not comparable,
we constructed two baselines, a standard phrase
based SMT system and an incremental Giza base-
line (§5). Details on experimental SMT systems
we built follow.

Baseline This system was built on the parallel
training data for each domain. We run 5 iterations
of model 1, 5 of HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), 3 of
model 3, 3 of model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) us-
ing MGiza (Gao and Vogel, 2008) toolkit to align
the parallel corpus at word level. Translation and
reordering models were built using Moses, while
log-linear weights were optimized with MERT on
the corresponding development sets. The same IT
baseline system was used in the field test of Mate-
Cat and the references in the IT data are actual
postedits of its translation.

IncGiza Baseline We trained alignment models
with incGiza++4 with 5 iterations of model 1 and
10 iterations of the HMM model. To build in-
cremental Giza baselines, we used dynamic suf-
fix arrays as implemented in Moses which allow
the addition of new parallel data during decod-
ing. In the incremental Giza baseline, once a sen-
tence of the test set is translated, the sentence pair
(source and target post-edit/reference) along with
the alignment provided by incGiza are added to
the models.

Online learning systems We developed several
online systems on top of the two aforementioned
baseline systems: (1) +O employ the additional
online feature (Section 3) updated with Algorithm
1; (2) +O+NS as (1) but with the online fea-
ture normalized with the sigmoid function; (3)
+W weights updated (Section 4) with Algorithm
2; (4) +O+W combination of online feature and
weight update; (5) +O+NS+W as system (4) with
normalized online feature score.

In the online learning system we have three ad-
ditional parameters: a weight for the online fea-
ture, a learning rate for features (used in the per-
ceptron update), and a learning rate for feature
weights used by MIRA. These additional param-
eters were optimized by maximizing the BLEU

score on the devset and on top of already opti-
mized feature weights. For practical reasons, opti-
mization of the parameters was run with the Sim-
plex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965).

7 Results and Discussion

Tables 2 and 3 collect results by the systems de-
scribed in Section 6.2 on the IT and TED transla-
tion tasks, respectively.

In Table 2, the online system (1st block
”+O+NS+W” system with 10 iterations of online
learning) shows significant improvements, over 6
BLEU points absolute above the baseline. In this
case the online feature can clearly take advantage
of the high repetition rates observed in the IT dev
and test sets (Table 1). Similarly, in the second
block, the online system (2nd block ”+O+NS+W”
with 10 iterations of online learning) outperforms
IncGiza baseline, too. It is interesting to note that
by continuously updating the baseline system af-
ter each translation step, even the plain translation
models are capable to learn from the correction in
the post-edited text.

Figure 1 depicts learning curve of Baseline sys-
tem, “+O+NS” (referred as +online feature) and
“+O+NS+W” (referred as +MIRA). We plotted in-
cremental BLEU scores after translation of each
sentence, thereby the last point on the plot shows
the corpus level BLEU on the whole test set.

In Table 3, from the first block we can observe
that online learning systems perform only slightly
better than the baseline systems, the main reason
being the low repetition rate observed in the eval-
uation set (as shown in Table 1). The positive re-
sults observed in the second block (”+O+W” with
10 iterations) are probably due to the larger room
for improvement available for translation models
implemented with dynamic suffix arrays, as they
only incorporate 3 features instead of 5. Some-
times, online learning systems show worse results
with higher numbers of iterations, which seems
due to overfitting. It is also interesting to notice
that after optimization the weight value of the on-
line feature was 0.509 for the IT task and 0.072 for
the TED talk task. This confirms the different use
and potential assigned to the online feature by the
SMT systems in the two tasks.

8 Conclusion

We have shown a new way to update the transla-
tion model on the fly without changing the original

probability distribution. We empirically proved
that this method is robust and works for differ-
ent domain datasets be it Information Technology
or TED talks. In addition, if the repetition rate is
high in the text, online learning works much bet-
ter than if the rate is low. We tested both with an
unbounded and a bounded range on the online fea-
ture and found out that bounded values produce
more stable and consistent results. From previous
works, it has been proven that MIRA works well
with sparse features too, so, as for the future plan
we would like to treat each phrase pair as a sparse
feature and tune the sparse weights using MIRA.
From the results, it is evident that we have not used
any sort of stopping criterion for online learning; a
random of 1, 5 and 10 iterations were chosen in a
naive way. Our future plan will extend to working
on finding a stopping criterion for online learning
process.
