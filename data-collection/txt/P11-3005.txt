Abstract

This paper describes a method for automati-
cally extracting and classifying multiword ex-
pressions (MWEs) for Urdu on the basis of a
relatively small unannotated corpus (around
8.12 million tokens). The MWEs are extracted
by an unsupervised method and classified into
two distinct classes, namely locations and per-
son names. The classification is based on sim-
ple heuristics that take the co-occurrence of
MWEs with distinct postpositions into account.
The resulting classes are evaluated against a
hand-annotated gold standard and achieve an
f-score of 0.5 and 0.746 for locations and
persons, respectively. A target application is
the Urdu ParGram grammar, where MWEs are
needed to generate a more precise syntactic
and semantic analysis.

1 Introduction

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are expressions
which can be semantically and syntactically idiosyn-
cratic in nature; acting as a single unit, their mean-
ing is not always predictable from their components.
Their identification is therefore an important task for
any Natural Language Processing (NLP) application
that goes beyond the analysis of pure surface struc-
ture, in particular for languages with few other NLP
tools available.

There is a vast amount of literature on extract-
ing and classifying MWEs automatically; many ap-
proaches rely on already available resources that aid
during the acquisition process. In the case of the
Indo-Aryan language Urdu, a lack of linguistic re-

sources such as annotated corpora or lexical knowl-
edge bases impedes the task of detecting and classi-
fying MWEs. Nevertheless, statistical measures and
language-specific syntactic information can be em-
ployed to extract and classify MWEs.

Therefore, the method described in this paper can
partly overcome the bottleneck of resource sparsity,
despite the relatively small size of the available cor-
pus and the simplistic approach taken. With the help
of heuristics as to the occurrence of Urdu MWEs with
characteristic postpositions and other cues, it is pos-
sible to cluster the MWEs into two groups: locations
and person names. It is also possible to detect junk
MWEs. The classification is then evaluated against a
hand-annotated gold standard of Urdu MWEs.

An NLP tool where the MWEs can be employed is
the Urdu ParGram grammar (Butt and King, 2007;
Bögel et al., 2007; Bögel et al., 2009), which is
based on the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
formalism (Dalrymple, 2001). For this task, differ-
ent types of MWEs need to be distinguished as they
are treated differently in the syntactic analysis.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 pro-
vides a brief review of related work, in particular
on MWE extraction in Indo-Aryan languages. Sec-
tion 3 describes our methodology, with the evalua-
tion following in Section 4. Section 5 presents the
Urdu ParGram Grammar and its treatment of MWEs,
followed by the discussion and the summary of the
paper in Section 6.

2 Related Work

MWE extraction and classification has been the focus
of a large amount of research. However, much work

24



has been conducted for well-resourced languages
such as English, benefiting from large enough cor-
pora (Attia et al., 2010), parallel data (Zarrieß and
Kuhn, 2009) and NLP tools such as taggers or depen-
dency parsers (Martens and Vandeghinste (2010),
among others) and lexical resources (Pearce, 2001).

Related work on Indo-Aryan languages has
mostly focused on the extraction of complex pred-
icates, with the focus on Hindi (Mukerjee et al.,
2006; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Sinha, 2009) and
Bengali (Das et al., 2010; Chakraborty and Bandy-
opadhyay, 2010). While complex predicates also
make up a large part of the verbal inventory in Urdu
(Butt, 1993), for the scope of this paper, we restrict
ourselves to classifying MWEs as locations or person
names and filter out junk bigrams.

Our approach deviates in several aspects to the re-
lated work in Indo-Aryan: First, we do not concen-
trate on specific POS constructions or dependency
relations, but use an unannotated middle-sized cor-
pus. For classification, we use simple heuristics by
taking the postpositions of the MWEs into account.
These can provide hints as to the nature of the MWE.

3 Methodology

3.1 Extraction and Identification of MWE
Candidates

The bigram extraction was carried out on a corpus of
around 8.12 million tokens of Urdu newspaper text,
collected by the Center for Research in Urdu Lan-
guage Processing (CRULP) (Hussain, 2008). We did
not perform any pre-processing such as POS tagging
or stop word removal.

Due to the relatively small size of our corpus, the
frequency cut-off for bigrams was set to 5, i.e. all
bigrams that occurred five times or more in the cor-
pus were considered. This rendered a list of 172,847
bigrams which were then ranked with the X2 asso-
ciation measure, using the UCS toolkit.1

The reasons for employing the X2 association
measure are twofold. First, papers using compara-
tively sized corpora reported encouraging results for
similar experiments (Ramisch et al., 2008; Kizito et
al., 2009). Second, initial manual comparison be-
tween MWE lists ranked according to all measures

Evert (2004) for documentation.

implemented in the UCS toolkit revealed the most
convincing results for the X2 test.

For the time being, we focus on bigram MWE
extraction. While the UCS toolkit readily supports
work on Unicode-based languages such as Urdu,
it does not support trigram extraction; other freely
available tools such as TEXT-NSP2 do come with
trigram support, but cannot handle Unicode script.
As a consequence, we currently implement our own
scripts to overcome these limitations.

3.2 Syntactic Cues
The clustering approach taken in this paper is based
on Urdu-specific syntactic information that can be
gathered straightforwardly from the corpus. Urdu
has a number of postpositions that can be used to
identify the nature of an MWE. Typographical cues
such as initial capital letters do not exist in the Urdu
script.

Locative postpositions The postposition QK� (par)
either expresses location on something which has a
surface or that an object is next to something.3 In
addition, it expresses movement to a destination.

Ó (mEN) expresses location in or at a point in
space or time, whereas ½�K (tak) denotes that some-
thing extends to a specific point in space. ú

shows movement away from a certain point in space.
These postpositions mostly occur with locations

and are thus syntactic indicators for this type of
MWE. However, in special cases, they can also occur
with other nouns, in which case we predict wrong
results during classification.

Person-indicating syntactic cues To classify an
MWE as a person, we consider syntactic cues that
usually occur after such MWEs. The ergative marker

The same holds for the possessive markers

» (kE) and ú



» (kI).

The accusative and dative case marker ñ» (kO) is
also a possible indicator that the preceding MWE is
a person.

These cues can also appear with common nouns,
but the combination of MWE and syntactic cue hints
to a person MWE. However, consider cases such as
New Delhi said that the taxes will rise., where New
Delhi is treated as an agent with nE attached to it,
providing a wrong clue as to the nature of the MWE.

3.3 Classifying Urdu MWEs

The classification of the extracted bigrams is solely
based on syntactic information as described in the
previous section. For every bigram, the postpo-
sitions that it occurs with are extracted from the
corpus, together with the frequency of the co-
occurrence.

Table 1 shows which postpositions are expected
to occur with which type of MWE. The first stipula-
tion is that only bigrams that occur with one of the
locative postpositions plus the ablative/instrumental
marker ú



æ (sE) one or more times are considered

to be locative MWEs (LOC). In contrast, bigrams
are judged as persons (PERS) when they co-occur
with all postpositions apart from the locative post-
positions one or more times. If a bigram occurs with
none of the postpositions, it is judged as being junk
(JUNK). As a consequence this means that theoreti-
cally valid MWEs such as complex predicates, which

never occur with a postposition, are misclassified as
being JUNK.

Without any further processing, the resulting clus-
ters are then evaluated against a hand-annotated gold
standard, as described in the following section.

4 Evaluation

4.1 Gold Standard

Our gold standard comprises the 1300 highest
ranked Urdu multiword candidates extracted from
the CRULP corpus, using the X2 association mea-
sure. The bigrams are then hand-annotated by a na-
tive speaker of Urdu and clustered into the following
classes: locations, person names, companies, mis-
cellaneous MWEs and junk. For the scope of this
paper, we restrict ourselves to classifying MWEs as
either locations or person names,. This also lies in
the nature of the corpus: companies can usually be
detected by endings such as “Corp.” or “Ltd.”, as is
the case in English. However, these markers are of-
ten left out and are not present in the corpus at hand.
Therefore, they cannot be used for our clustering.
The class of miscellaneous MWEs contains complex
predicates that we do not attempt to deal with here.

In total, the gold standard comprises 30 compa-
nies, 95 locations, 411 person names, 512 miscella-
neous MWEs (mostly complex predicates) and 252
junk bigrams. We have not analyzed the gold stan-
dard any further, and restricting it to n < 1300 might
improve the evaluation results.

4.2 Results

The bigrams are classified according to the heuris-
tics outlined in Section 3.3. Evaluating against the
hand-annotated gold standard yields the results in
Table 2.

While the results are encouraging for persons with
an f-score of 0.746, there is still room for improve-
ment for locative MWEs. Part of the problem for per-

son names is that Urdu names are generally longer
than two words, and as we have not considered tri-
grams yet, it is impossible to find a postposition after
an incomplete though generally valid name. Loca-
tions tend to have the same problem, however the
reasons for missing out on a large part of the loca-
tive MWEs are not quite clear and are currently being
investigated.

Junk bigrams can be detected with an f-score of
0.379. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the mis-
cellaneous MWEs (e.g., complex predicates), many
of them are judged as being junk because they never
occur with a postposition. If one could detect com-
plex predicate and, possibly, other subgroups from
the miscellaneous class, then classifying the junk
MWEs would become easier.

5 Integration into the Urdu ParGram
Grammar

The extracted MWEs are integrated into the Urdu
ParGram grammar (Butt and King, 2007; Bögel et
al., 2007; Bögel et al., 2009), a computational gram-
mar for Urdu running with XLE (Crouch et al., 2010)
and based on the syntax formalism of LFG (Dal-
rymple, 2001). XLE grammars are generally hand-
written and not acquired a machine learning pro-
cess or the like. This makes grammar development a
very conscious task and it is imperative to deal with
MWEs in order to achieve a linguistically valid and
deep syntactic analysis that can be used for an addi-
tional semantic analysis.

MWEs that are correctly classified according to the
gold standard are automatically integrated into the
multiword lexicon of the grammar, accompanied by
information about their nature (see example (3)).

In general, grammar input is first tokenized by a
standard tokenizer that separates the input string into
single tokens and replaces the white spaces with a
special token boundary symbol. Each token is then
passed through a cascade of finite-state morpholog-
ical analyzers (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). For

MWEs, the matter is different as they are treated as
a single unit to preserve the semantic information
they carry. Apart from the meaning preservation, in-
tegrating MWEs into the grammar reduces parsing
ambiguity and parsing time, while the perspicuity of
the syntactic analyses is increased (Butt et al., 1999).

In order to prevent the MWEs from being inde-
pendently analyzed by the finite-state morphology,
a look-up is performed in a transducer which only
contains MWEs with their morphological informa-
tion. So instead of analyzing t3ul and AbEb sep-
arately, for example, they are analyzed as a sin-
gle item carrying the morphological information
+Noun+Location.4

(3) t3ul` AbEb: /t3ul` AbEb/ +Noun
+Location

The resulting stem and tag sequence is then
passed on to the grammar. See (4) for an example
and Figures 1 and 2 for the corresponding c- and
f-structure; the +Location tag in (3) is used to
produce the location analysis in the f-structure. Note
also that t3ul AbEb is displayed as a multiword
under the N node in the c-structure.

6 Discussion, Summary and Future Work

Despite the simplistic approach for extracting and
clustering Urdu MWEs taken in this paper, the re-
sults are encouraging with f-scores of 0.5 and 0.746
for locations and person names, respectively. We
are well aware that this paper does not present a
complete approach to classifying Urdu multiwords,
but considering the targeted tool, the Urdu ParGram
grammar, this methodology provides us with a set of
MWEs that can be implemented to improve the syn-
tactic analyses.

The methodology provided here can also guide
MWE work in other languages facing the same re-
source sparsity as Urdu, given that distinctive syn-
tactic cues are available in the language.

For Urdu, the syntactic cues are good indica-
tions of the nature of the MWE; future work on
this subtopic might prove beneficial to the clustering
regarding companies, complex predicates and junk
MWEs. Another area for future work is to extend
the extraction and classification to trigrams to im-
prove the results especially for locations and person
names. We also consider harvesting data sources
from the web such as lists of cities, common names
and companies in Pakistan and India. Such lists are
not numerous for Urdu, but they may nevertheless
help to generate a larger MWE lexicon.
