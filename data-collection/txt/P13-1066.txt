Abstract 

Online discussion forums are a popular 
platform for people to voice their opinions on 
any subject matter and to discuss or debate 
any issue of interest. In forums where users 
discuss social, political, or religious issues, 
there are often heated debates among users or 
participants. Existing research has studied 
mining of user stances or camps on certain 
issues, opposing perspectives, and contention 
points. In this paper, we focus on identifying 
the nature of interactions among user pairs. 
The central questions are: How does each 
pair of users interact with each other? Does 
the pair of users mostly agree or disagree? 
What is the lexicon that people often use to 
express agreement and disagreement? We 
present a topic model based approach to 
answer these questions. Since agreement and 
disagreement expressions are usually multi-
word phrases, we propose to employ a 
ranking method to identify highly relevant 
phrases prior to topic modeling. After 
modeling, we use the modeling results to 
classify the nature of interaction of each user 
pair. Our evaluation results using real-life 
discussion/debate posts demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed techniques.  

1 Introduction 
Online discussion/debate forums allow people 
with common interests to freely ask and answer 
questions, to express their views and opinions on 
any subject matter, and to discuss issues of 
common interest. A large part of such 
discussions is about social, political, and 
religious issues. On such issues, there are often 
heated discussions/debates, i.e., people agree or 
disagree and argue with one another. Such 
ideological discussions on a myriad of social and 
political issues have practical implications in the 
fields of communication and political science as 
they give social scientists an opportunity to study 
real-life discussions/debates of almost any issue 
and analyze participant behaviors in a large scale. 

In this paper, we present such an application, 
which aims to perform fine-grained analysis of 
user-interactions in online discussions.  

There have been some related works that focus 
on discovering the general topics and ideological 
perspectives in online discussions (Ahmed and 
Xing, 2010), placing users in support/oppose 
camps (Agarwal et al., 2003), and classifying 
user stances (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009). 
However, these works are at a rather coarser 
level and have not considered more fine-grained 
characteristics of debates/discussions where users 
interact with each other by quoting/replying each 
other to express agreement or disagreement and 
argue with one another. In this work, we want to 
mine the following information: 
1. The nature of interaction of each pair of users 

or participants who have engaged in the 
discussion of certain issues, i.e., whether the 
two persons mostly agree or disagree with 
each other in their interactions. 

2. What language expressions are often used to 
express agreement (e.g., “I agree” and “you’re 
right”) and disagreement (e.g., “I disagree” 
and “you speak nonsense”).  

We note that although agreement and 
disagreement expressions are distinct from 
traditional sentiment expressions (words and 
phrases) such as good, excellent, bad, and 
horrible, agreement and disagreement clearly 
express a kind of sentiment as well. They are 
usually emitted during interactive exchanges of 
arguments in ideological discussions. This idea 
prompted us to introduce the concept of AD-
sentiment. We define the polarity of agreement 
expressions as positive and the polarity of 
disagreement expressions as negative. We refer 
agreement and disagreement expressions as AD-
sentiment expressions, or AD-expressions for 
short. AD-expressions are crucial for the analysis 
of interactive discussions and debates just as 
sentiment expressions are instrumental in 
sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012). We thus regard 
this work as an extension to traditional sentiment 

671



analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012).  
In our earlier work (Mukherjee and Liu, 

2012a), we proposed three topic models to mine 
contention points, which also extract AD-
expressions. In this paper, we further improve the 
work by coupling an information retrieval 
method to rank good candidate phrases with topic 
modeling in order to discover more accurate AD-
expressions. Furthermore, we apply the resulting 
AD-expressions to the new task of classifying the 
arguing or interaction nature of each pair of 
users. Using discovered AD-expressions for 
classification has an important advantage over 
traditional classification because they are domain 
independent. We employ a semi-supervised 
generative model called JTE-P to jointly model 
AD-expressions, pair interactions, and discussion 
topics simultaneously in a single framework. 
With such complex interactions mined, we can 
produce many useful summaries of discussions. 
For example, we can discover the most 
contentious pairs for each topic and ideological 
camps of participants, i.e., people who often 
agree with each other are likely to belong to the 
same camp. The proposed framework also 
facilitates tracking users’ ideology shifts and the 
resulting arguing nature. 

The proposed methods have been evaluated 
both qualitatively and quantitatively using a large 
number of real-life discussion/debate posts from 
four domains. Experimental results show that the 
proposed model is highly effective in performing 
its tasks and outperforms several baselines. 

2 Related Work 
There are several research areas that are related 
to our work. We compare with them below.  
Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis 
determines positive and negative opinions 
expressed on entities and aspects (Hu and Liu, 
2004). Main tasks include aspect extraction (Hu 
and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), 
polarity identification (Hassan and Radev, 2010; 
Choi and Cardie, 2010) and subjectivity analysis 
(Wiebe, 2000). As discussed earlier, agreement 
and disagreement are a special form of 
sentiments and are different from the sentiment 
studied in the mainstream research. Traditional 
sentiment is mainly expressed with sentiment 
terms (e.g., great and bad), while agreement and 
disagreement are inferred by AD-expressions 
(e.g., I agree and I disagree), which we also call 
AD-sentiment expressions. Thus, this work 
expands the sentiment analysis research.  

Topic models: Our work is also related to topic 
modeling and joint modeling of topics and other 
information as we jointly model several aspects 
of discussions/debates.  

Topic models like pLSA (Hofmann, 1999) and 
LDA (Blei et al., 2003) have proved to be very 
successful in mining topics from large text 
collections. There have been various extensions 
to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008), 
labeled (Ramage et al., 2009), and sequential (Du 
et al., 2010) topic models. Yet other approaches 
extend topic models to produce author specific 
topics (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), author persona 
(Mimno and McCallum, 2007), social roles 
(McCallum et al., 2007), etc. However, these 
models do not model debates and hence are 
unable to discover AD-expressions and 
interaction natures of author pairs.  

Also related are topic models in sentiment 
analysis which are often referred to as Aspect 
and Sentiment models (ASMs). ASMs come in 
two main flavors: Type-1 ASMs discover aspect 
(or topic) words sentiment-wise (i.e., discovering 
positive and negative topic words and sentiments 
for each topic without separating topic and 
sentiment terms) (e.g., Lin and He, 2009; Brody 
and Elhadad, 2010, Jo and Oh, 2011). Type-2 
ASMs separately discover both aspects and 
sentiments (e.g., Mei et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 
2010). Recently, domain knowledge induced 
ASMs have also been proposed (Mukherjee and 
Liu, 2012b; Chen et al., 2013). The generative 
process of ASMs is, however, different from our 
model. Specifically, Type-1 ASMs use 
asymmetric hyper-parameters for aspects while 
Type-2 assumes that sentiments and aspects are 
emitted in the same sentence. However, AD-
expressions are emitted differently. They are 
mostly interleaved with users’ topical viewpoints 
and span different sentences. Further, we capture 
the key characteristic of discussions by encoding 
pair-wise user interactions. Existing models do 
not model pair interactions. 

In terms of discussions and comments, Yano 
et al., (2009) proposed the CommentLDA model 
which builds on the work of LinkLDA (Erosheva 
et al., 2004). Mukherjee and Liu (2012d) mined 
comment expressions. These works, however, 
don’t model pair interactions in debates. 
Support/oppose camp classification: Several 
works have attempted to put debate authors into 
support/oppose camps. Agrawal et al. (2003) 
used a graph based method. Murakami and 
Raymond (2010) used a rule-based method. In 
(Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003), speaker 

672



utterances were classified into agreement, 
disagreement and backchannel classes. 
Stances in online debates: Somasundaran and 
Wiebe (2009), Thomas et al. (2006), Bansal et al. 
(2008), Burfoot et al. (2011), and Anand et al. 
(2011) proposed methods to recognize stances in 
online debates. Some other research directions 
include subgroup detection (Abu-Jbara et al., 
2012), tolerance analysis (Mukherjee et al., 
2013), mining opposing perspectives (Lin and 
Hauptmann, 2006), linguistic accommodation 
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012c), and contention 
point mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a). For 
this work, we adopt the JTE-P model in 
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a), and make two 
major advances. We propose a new method to 
improve the AD-expression mining  and a new 
task of classifying pair interaction nature to 
determine whether each pair of users who have 
interacted based on replying relations mostly 
agree or disagree with each other. 

3 Model  
We now introduce the JTE-P model with 
additional details. JTE-P is a semi-supervised 
generative model motivated by the joint 
occurrence of expression types (agreement and 
disagreement), topics in discussion posts, and 
user pairwise interactions. Before proceeding, we 
make the following observation about online 
discussions. 

In a typical debate/discussion post, the user 
(author) mentions a few topics (using 
semantically related topical terms) and expresses 
some viewpoints with one or more AD-
expression types (using agreement and 
disagreement expressions). AD-expressions are 
directed towards other user(s), which we call 
target(s). In this work, we focus on explicit 
mentions (i.e., using @name or quoting other 
authors’ posts). In our crawled dataset, 77% of 
all posts exhibit explicit quoting/reply-to 
relations excluding the first posts of threads 
which start the discussions and usually have 
nobody to quote/reply-to. Such author-target 
exchanges usually go back and forth between 
pairs of users populating a thread of discussion. 
The discussion topics and AD-expressions 
emitted are thus caused by the author-pairs’ 
topical interests and their nature of interaction 
(agreeing vs. disagreeing).  

In our discussion data obtained from 
Volconvo.com, we found that a pair of users 
typically exhibited a dominant arguing nature 

(agreeing vs. disagreeing) towards each other 
across various topics or threads. We believe this 
is because our data consists of topics like 
elections, theism, terrorism, vegetarianism, etc. 
which are often heated and attract people with 
pre-determined, strong, and polarized stances1. 

This observation motivates the generative 
process of our model. Referring to the notations 
in Table 1, we explain the generative process of 
JTE-P. Given a document (post) 𝑑, its author, 𝑎𝑑, 
and the list of targets to whom 𝑎𝑑 replies/quotes 
                                                           
1 These hardened perspectives are supported by theoretical 
studies in communications like the polarization effect 
(Sunstein, 2002), and the hostile media effect, a scenario 
where partisans rigidly hold on to their stances (Hansen and 
Hyunjung, 2011).

in 𝑑 , 𝑏𝑑 = [𝑏1 … 𝑏𝑛] , the document 𝑑  exhibits 
shared topics and arguing nature of various pairs, 
𝑝 = (𝑎𝑑 , 𝑐)   , where 𝑐 ∈ 𝑏𝑑 . More precisely, the 
pair specific topic and AD-expression 
distributions (𝜃𝑝𝑇 ; 𝜃𝑝𝐸 ) “shape” the topics and 
AD-expressions emitted in 𝑑  as agreement and 
disagreement on topical viewpoints are directed 
towards certain target authors. Each topic (𝜑𝑡𝑇) 
and AD-expression type (𝜑𝑒𝐸) is characterized by 
a multinomial distribution over terms 
(words/phrases). Assume we have 𝑡 = 1 …𝑇 
topics and 𝑒 = 1 …𝐸  expression types in our 
corpus. Note that in our case of discussion/debate 
forums, we hypothesize 𝐸 = 2 as in debates, we 
mostly find two expression types: agreement and 
disagreement (more details in §6.1). Like most 
generative models for text, a post (document) is 
viewed as a bag of n-grams and each n-gram 
(word/phrase) takes one value from a predefined 
vocabulary. In this work, we use up to 4-grams, 
i.e., n = 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead of using all n-grams, a 
relevance based ranking method is proposed to 
select a subset of highly relevant n-grams for 
model building (details in §4). For notational 
convenience, we use terms to denote both words 
(unigrams) and phrases (n-grams). 

JTE-P is a switching graphical model (Ahmed 
and Xing, 2010; Zhao et al., 2010) performing a 
switch between AD-expressions and topics. 𝜓𝑑,𝑗 
denotes the distribution over topics and AD-
expressions with 𝑟𝑑,𝑗 ∈ {�̂�, �̂�} denoting the binary 
indicator/switch variable (topic or AD-
expression) for the 𝑗 th term of 𝑑 , 𝑤𝑑,𝑗 .  To 
perform the switch we use a maximum entropy 
(Max-Ent) model. The idea is motivated by the 
observation that topical and AD-expression terms 
usually play different roles in a sentence. Topical 
terms (e.g., “elections” and “income tax”) tend to 
be noun and noun phrases while AD-expression 
terms (“I refute”, “how can you say”, and 
“probably agree”) usually contain pronouns, 
verbs, wh-determiners, and modals. In order to 
utilize the part-of-speech (POS) tag information, 
we place the topic/AD-expression distribution 
𝜓𝑑,𝑗 (the prior over the indicator variable 𝑟𝑑,𝑗) in 
the term plate (see Figure 1) and set it from a 
Max-Ent model conditioned on the observed 
feature context 𝑥𝑑,𝑗  associated with 𝑤𝑑,𝑗  and the 
learned Max-Ent parameters, 𝜆 (details in §6.1). 
In this work, we use both lexical and POS 
features of the previous, current, and next POS 
tags/lexemes of the term 𝑤𝑑,𝑗  as the contextual 
information, i.e., 𝑥𝑑,𝑗 = [𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑑,𝑗−1 , 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑑,𝑗 ,
𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑑,𝑗+1 , 𝑤𝑑,𝑗−1,𝑤𝑑,𝑗 , 𝑤𝑑,𝑗+1], which is used to 

produce the feature functions for Max-Ent. For 
phrasal terms (n-grams), all POS tags and 
lexemes of 𝑤𝑑,𝑗  are considered as contextual 
information for computing feature functions in 
Max-Ent. We now detail the generative process 
of JTE-P (plate notation in Figure 1) as follows: 

1. For each AD-expression type 𝑒, draw 𝜑𝑒𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛽𝐸) 
2. For each topic 𝑡, draw 𝜑𝑡𝑇~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛽𝑇) 
3. For each pair 𝑝, draw 𝜃𝑝𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛼𝐸); 𝜃𝑝𝑇~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛼𝐸) 
4. For each forum discussion post 𝑑 ∈ {1 …𝐷}: 

i. Given the author 𝑎𝑑 and the list of targets 𝑏𝑑 , for 
each term 𝑤𝑑,𝑗, 𝑗 ∈ {1 …𝑁𝑑}: 
a. Draw a target 𝑐~𝑈𝑛𝑖(𝑏𝑑) 
b. Form pair 𝑝 = (𝑎𝑑 , 𝑐), 𝑐 ∈ 𝑏𝑑   
c. Set 𝜓𝑑,𝑗 ← 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑛𝑡(𝑥𝑑,𝑗; 𝜆) 
d. Draw 𝑟𝑑,𝑗~𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛(𝜓𝑑,𝑗) 
e. if (𝑟𝑑,𝑗 = �̂�) // 𝑤𝑑,𝑗 is an AD-expression term 

Draw 𝑧𝑑,𝑗~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃𝑝𝐸) 
else // 𝑟𝑑,𝑗 = �̂�, 𝑤𝑑,𝑗 is a topical term 

Draw 𝑧𝑑,𝑗~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃𝑝𝑇) 
f. Emit 𝑤𝑑,𝑗~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜑𝑧𝑑,𝑗

𝑟𝑑,𝑗) 

𝐷𝑖𝑟 , 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡 , 𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛 , and 𝑈𝑛𝑖  correspond to the 
Dirichlet, Multinomial, Bernoulli, and Uniform 
distributions respectively. To learn JTE-P, we 
employ approximate posterior inference using 
Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling. Denoting the 
random variables {𝑤, 𝑧,𝑝, 𝑟} associated with each 
term by singular subscripts {𝑤𝑘, 𝑧𝑘,𝑝𝑘, 𝑟𝑘}, 𝑘1…𝐾 , 
𝐾 = ∑ 𝑁𝑑𝑑 , a single Gibbs sweep consists of 
performing the following sampling.

denoted by (·)  represents the marginalized sum 
over the latter index. 𝑘 = (𝑑, 𝑗)  denotes the 𝑗 th

the counts excluding the term at (𝑑, 𝑗). 𝜆1…𝑛  are 
the parameters of the learned Max-Ent model 
corresponding to the 𝑛  binary feature functions 
𝑓1…𝑛  for Max-Ent. These learned Max-Ent 𝜆 
parameters in conjunction with the observed 
feature context, 𝑥𝑑,𝑗  feed the supervision signal 
for topic/expression switch parameter, r which is 
updated during inference in equations (1) and (2).

4 Phrase Ranking based on Relevance 
We now detail our method of pre-processing n-
grams (phrases) based on relevance to select a 
subset of highly relevant n-grams for model 
building. This has two advantages: (i). A large 
number of irrelevant n-grams slow inference. (ii). 
Filtering irrelevant terms in the vocabulary 
improves the quality of AD-expressions. Before 
proceeding, we review some existing approaches. 
Topics in most topic models like LDA are 
usually unigram distributions. This offers a great 
computational advantage compared to more 
complex models which consider word ordering 
(Wallach, 2006; Wang et al., 2007). This thread 
of research models bigrams by encoding them 
into the generative process. For each word, a 
topic is sampled first, then its status as a unigram 
or bigram is sampled, and finally the word is 
sampled from a topic-specific unigram or bigram 
distribution. This method, however, is expensive 
computationally and has a limitation for arbitrary 
length n-grams. In (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003), 
a language model approach is used for bigram 
phrase extraction. 

Yet another thread of research post-processes 
the discovered topical unigrams to form multi-
word phrases using likelihood scores (Blei and 
Lafferty, 2009). This approach considers adjacent 
word pairs and identifies n-grams which occur 
much more often than one would expect by 
chance alone by computing likelihood ratios. 
While this is reasonable, a significant n-gram 
with high likelihood score may not necessarily be 
relevant to the problem domain. For instance, in 
our case of discovering AD-expressions, the 
likelihood score 2  of 𝑝1  = “the government of” 
happens to be more than 𝑝2  = “I completely 
disagree”. Clearly, the former is irrelevant for the 
task of discovering AD-expressions. The reason 
for this is that likelihood scores or other 
statistical test scores rely on the relative counts in 
the multi-way contingency table to compute 
significance. Since the relative counts of different 
fragments of the irrelevant phrase 𝑝1 , e.g. “the 
government”, and “government of”, happen to 
appear more than the corresponding counts in the 
contingency table of 𝑝2, the tests assign a higher 
score. This is nothing wrong per se because the 
statistical tests only judge significance of an n-
gram, but a significant n-gram may not 
necessarily be relevant in a given problem 
domain. 
                                                           
2 Computed using N-gram statistics package, NSP; http://n-
gram.sourceforge.net 

Thus, the existing approaches have some 
major shortcomings for our task. As our goal is 
to enhance the expressiveness of our models by 
considering relevant n-grams preserving the 
advantages of exchangeable modeling, we 
employ a pre-processing technique to rank n-
grams based on relevance and consider certain 
number of top ranked n-grams based on coverage 
(details follow) in our vocabulary. The idea 
works as follows. 

We first induce a unigram JTE-P whereby we 
cluster the relevant AD-expression unigrams in 
𝜑𝐴𝑔𝐸  and 𝜑𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 . Our notion of relevance of AD-
expressions is already encoded into the model 
using priors set from Max-Ent. Next, we rank the 
candidate phrases (n-grams) using our 
probabilistic ranking function. The ranking 
function is grounded on the following 
hypothesis: a relevant phrase is one whose 
unigrams are closely related to (or appear with 
high probabilities in) the given AD-expression 
type, 𝑒 : Agreement ( 𝐴𝑔 ) or disagreement 
(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔). Continuing from the previous example, 
given the expression type 𝜑𝑒=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 , 𝑝2 is relevant 
while 𝑝1 is not as “government” and “disagree” 
are highly unlikely and likely respectively to be 
clustered in 𝜑𝑒=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 . Thus, we want to rank 
phrases based on 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑒,𝑝) where 𝑒 denotes 
the expression type (Agreement/Disagreement), 
𝑝  denotes a candidate phrase. Following the 
probabilistic relevance model in (Lafferty and 
Zhai, 2003), we use a similar technique to that in 
(Zhao et al., 2011) for deriving our relevance 
ranking function as follows: 

 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑒,𝑝) = 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1|𝑒,𝑝)
𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=0|𝑒,𝑝)+𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1|𝑒,𝑝)

=
1

1+𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=0|𝑒,𝑝)𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1|𝑒,𝑝)
= 1

1+𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑝| 𝑒)𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑝|𝑒)
=

 1
1+[𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)×𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=0|𝑒)][𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)×𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1|𝑒)]

               (3) 

We further define 𝜀 = 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=0|𝑒)
𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙=1|𝑒)

. Without loss of 
generality, one can say that 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 0|𝑒) ≫
𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑒) , because there are many more 
irrelevant phrases than relevant ones, i.e., 𝜀 ≫ 1. 
Thus, taking log, from equation (3), we get, 

log𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑒,𝑝) = log� 1
1+𝜀×𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)

� ≈

log �𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)
𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)

× 1
𝜀
� = log �𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)

𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)
� − log 𝜀    (4) 

Thus, our ranking function actually computes the 
relevance score log �𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)

𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)
� . The last term, 

log 𝜀  being a constant is ignored because it 
cancels out while comparing candidate n-grams.

We now estimate the relevance score of a phrase 
𝑝 = (𝑤1,𝑤2, … ,𝑤𝑛). Using the conditional 
independence assumption of words given the 
indicator variable 𝑅𝑒𝑙 and expression type 𝑒, we 
have: 

log �𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)
𝑃(𝑝|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)

� = ∑ log 𝑃(𝑤𝑖|𝑅𝑒𝑙=1,𝑒)
𝑃(𝑤𝑖|𝑅𝑒𝑙=0,𝑒)

𝑛
𝑖=1              (5) 

Given the expression model 𝜑𝑒𝐸  previously 
learned by inducing the unigram JTE-P, it is 
intuitive to set 𝑃(𝑤𝑖|𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1, 𝑒)  to the point 

estimate of the posterior on 𝜑𝑒,𝑤𝑖
𝐸 =

𝑛𝑒,𝑤𝑖
𝐸𝑉 +𝛽𝐸

𝑛𝑒,(·)
𝐸𝑉 +𝑉𝛽𝐸

, 

where 𝑛𝑒,𝑤𝑖
𝐸𝑉  is the number of times 𝑤𝑖  was 

assigned to AD-expression type 𝑒  and 𝑛𝑒,(·)𝐸𝑉  
denotes the marginalized sum over the latter 
index. On the other hand, 𝑃(𝑤𝑖|𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 0, 𝑒) can be 
estimated using a Laplace smoothed ( 𝜇  = 1) 
background model, i.e., (𝑤𝑖|𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 0, 𝑒) =

𝑛𝑤𝑖+𝜇

𝑛𝑉+𝑉𝜇
 , 

where 𝑛𝑤𝑖  denotes the number of times 𝑤𝑖 
appears in the whole corpus and 𝑛𝑉 denotes the 
number of terms in the entire corpus. 

Next, we throw light on the issue of choosing 
the number of top k phrases from the ranked 
candidate n-grams. Precisely, we want to analyze 
the coverage of our proposed ranking based on 
relevance models. By coverage, we mean that 
having selected top k candidate n-grams based on 
the proposed relevance ranking, we want to get 
an estimate of how many relevant terms from a 
sample of the collection were covered. To 
compute coverage, we randomly sampled 500 
documents from the corpus and listed the 
candidate n-grams3 in the collection of sampled 
500 documents. For this and subsequent human 
judgment tasks, we use two judges (graduate 
students well versed in English). We asked our 
judges to mark all relevant AD-expressions. 
Agreement study yielded κCohen = 0.77 showing 
substantial agreement according to scale 4 
provided in (Landis and Koch, 1977). This is 
understandable as identifying AD-expressions is 
a relatively easy task. Finally, a term was 
considered to be relevant if both judges marked it 
so. We then computed the coverage to see how 
many of the relevant terms in the random sample 
were also present in top k phrases from the 
ranked candidate n-grams. We summarize the 

                                                           
3 These are terms appearing at least 20 times in the entire 
collection. We do this for computational reasons as there 
can be many n-grams and n-grams with very low frequency 
are less likely to be relevant. 
4 No agreement (κ < 0), slight agreement (0 < κ ≤ 0.2), fair 
agreement (0.2 < κ ≤ 0.4), moderate agreement (0.4 < κ ≤ 
0.6), substantial agreement (0.6 < κ ≤ 0.8), and almost 
perfect agreement 0.8 < κ ≤ 1.0. 

coverage results below in Table 2. 

k 3000 4000 5000 

JTE-P Agreement 81.34 84.24 87.01 Disagreement 84.96 87.86 89.64 
Table 2: Coverage (in %) of AD-expressions. 

We find that choosing top k = 5000 candidate n-
grams based on our proposed ranking, we obtain 
a coverage of 87% for agreement and 89.64 for 
disagreement expression types which are 
reasonably good. Thus, we choose top 5000 
candidate n-grams for each expression type and 
add them to the vocabulary beyond all unigrams.  

 Like expression types 𝑒1…𝐸 , we also ranked 
candidate phrases for topics 𝑡1…𝑇  using 
𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑡,𝑝). However, for topics, selecting k 
based on coverage of each topic is more difficult 
because we induce 50 topics and it is also much 
more difficult to manually find relevant topical 
phrases in the sampled data as a topical phrase 
may belong to more than one topic. We selected 
top 2000 ranked candidate phrases for each topic 
using 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 1|𝑡,𝑝) as we feel that is sufficient 
for a topic. Note that phrases for topics are not as 
crucial as for AD-expressions because topics can 
more or less be defined by unigrams. 

5 Classifying Pair Interaction Nature 
We now determine whether two users (also 
called a user pair) mostly agree or disagree with 
each other in their exchanges, i.e., their pair 
interaction or arguing nature. This is a relatively 
new task. We first summarize the closest related 
works. In (Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 
2003; Thomas et al., 2006, Bansal et al., 2008), 
conversational speeches (i.e., U.S. Congress 
meeting transcripts) are classified into for or 
against an issue using various types of features: 
durational (e.g., time taken by a speaker; speech 
rate, etc.), structural (e.g., no. of speakers per 
side, no. of votes cast by a speaker on a bill, etc.), 
and lexical (e.g., first word, last word, n-grams, 
etc.). Burfoot et al., (2011) builds on the work of 
(Thomas et al., 2006) and proposes collective 
classification using speaker contextual features 
(e.g., speaker intentions based on vote labels). 
However, above works do not discover pair 
interactions (arguing nature) in debate authors. 
Online discussion forums are textual rather than 
conversational (e.g., U.S. Congress meeting 
transcripts). Thus, the durational, structural, and 
contextual features used in prior works are not 
directly applicable.  

Instead, the model posterior on 𝜃𝑝𝐸  for JTE-P 

676



can actually give an estimate of the overall 
interaction nature of a pair, i.e., the probability 
masses assigned to expression types, 𝑒 =
𝐴𝑔(Agreement) and 𝑒 = 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔 (Disagreement). 
As 𝜃𝑝𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛼𝐸), we have 𝜃𝑝,𝑒=𝐴𝑔𝐸 + 𝜃𝑝,𝑒=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 = 1. 
Hence, if the probability mass assigned to any 
one of the expression types (agreement, 
disagreement) > 0.5 then according to the model 
posterior, that expression type is dominant, i.e., if 
𝜃𝑝,𝐴𝑔𝐸  > 0.5, the pair is agreeing else disagreeing.  

However, this approach is not the best. As we 
will see in the experiment section, supervised 
classification using labeled training data with 
discovered AD-expressions as features performs 
better.  

6 Empirical Evaluation 
We now evaluate the proposed techniques in the 
context of the JTE-P model. We first evaluate the 
discovered AD-expressions by comparing results 
with and without using the phrase ranking 
method in Section 4, and then evaluate the 
classification of interaction nature of pairs. 

6.1 Dataset and Experiment Settings 
We crawled debate/discussion forum posts from 
Volconvo.com. The forum is divided into various 
domains. Each domain consists of multiple 
threads of discussions. For each post, we 
extracted the post id, author, domain, ids of all 
posts to which it replies/quotes, and the post 
content. In all, we extracted 26137, 34986, 
22354, and 16525 posts from Politics, Religion, 
Society and Science domains respectively.  
Experiment Data: As it is not interesting to 
study pairs who only exchanged a few posts, we 
restrict to pairs with at least 20 post exchanges. 
This resulted in 1241 authors and 1461 pairs. The 
reduced dataset consists of 1095586 tokens (after 
n-gram preprocessing in §4), 40102 posts with an 
average of 27 posts or interactions per pair. Data 
from all 4 domains are combined for modeling. 
Parameter Settings: For all our experiments, we 
set the hyper-parameters to the heuristic values 
𝛼𝑇  = 50/𝑇, 𝛼𝐸  = 50/𝐸, 𝛽𝑇  = 𝛽𝐸  = 0.1 suggested 
in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). We set the 
number of topics, 𝑇 = 50 and the number of AD-
expression types, 𝐸 = 2 (agreement and 
disagreement) as in discussion/debate forums, 
there are usually two expression types5. To learn 
                                                           
5 Values for 𝐸 > 2 were also tried. However, they did not 
produce any new dominant expression type. There was also 
a slight increase in the model perplexity showing that values 
of 𝐸 > 2 do not fit the debate forum data well. 

the Max-Ent parameters 𝜆, we randomly sampled 
500 terms from the held-out data (10 threads in 
our corpus which were excluded from the 
evaluation of tasks in §6.2, §6.3) appearing at 
least 10 times and labeled them as topical (361) 
or AD-expressions (139) and used the 
corresponding features of each term (in the 
context of posts where it occurs, §3) to train the 
Max-Ent model. 

6.2 AD-Expression Evaluation 
We first list some discovered top AD-expressions 
in Table 3 for qualitative inspection. From Table 
3, we can see that JTE-P can cluster many correct 
AD-expressions, e.g., “I accept”, “I agree”, 
“you’re correct”, etc. in agreement and “I 
disagree”, “don’t accept”, “I refute”, etc. in 
disagreement. In addition, it also discovers and 
clusters highly specific and more “distinctive” 
expressions beyond those used in Max-Ent 
training, e.g., “valid point”, “I do support”, and 
“rightly said” in agreement; and phrases like “can 
you prove”, “I don’t buy your”, and “you fail to” 
in disagreement. Note that terms in black in 
Table 3 were used in Max-Ent training. The 
newly discovered terms are marked blue in 
italics. Clustering errors are in red (bold). 

For quantitative evaluation, topic models are 
often compared using perplexity. However, 
perplexity does not reflect our purpose since we 
are not trying to evaluate how well the AD-
expressions in an unseen discussion data fit our 
learned models. Instead our focus is to evaluate 
how well our learned AD-expression types 
perform in clustering semantic phrases of 
agreement/disagreement. Since AD-expressions 
(according to top terms in 𝜑𝐸) produced by JTE-
P are rankings, we choose precision @ n (p@n) 
as our metric. p@n is commonly used to evaluate 
a ranking when the total number of correct items 
is unknown (e.g., Web search results, aspect 
terms in topic models for sentiment analysis 
(Zhao et al., 2010), etc.). This situation is similar 
to our AD-expression rankings, 𝜑𝐸 . Further, as 
𝜑𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟, the Dirichlet smoothing effect ensures 
that every term in the vocabulary has some non-
zero mass to agreement or disagreement 
expression type. Thus, it is the ranking of terms 
in each AD-expression type that matters (i.e., 
whether the model is able to rank highly relevant 
terms at the top).  

The above method evaluates the original 
ranking. Another way of evaluating the AD-
expression rankings is to evaluate only those 
newly discovered terms, i.e., beyond those 

677



labeled terms used in Max-Ent training. For this 
evaluation, we remove those terms that have 
been used in Max-Ent (ME) training. We report 
both results in Table 4. We also studied inter-
rater agreement using two judges who 
independently labeled the top n terms as correct 
or incorrect. A term was marked correct if both 
judges deemed it so which was then used to 
compute p@n. Agreement using 𝜅𝐶𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑛  was 
greater than 0.78 for all p@n computations 
implying substantial and good agreements as 
identifying whether a phrase implies agreement 
or disagreement or none is an easy task. P@n 
excluding ME labeled terms (Table 4, second 

column) are slightly lower than those using all 
terms but are still decent. This is because p@n 
excluding ME labeled terms removes many 
correct AD-expressions used in training. 

Further to evaluate the sensitivity of 
performance on the amount of labeled terms for 
Max-Ent, we computed p@n across different 
sizes of labeled terms. Table 4 shows p@n for 
agreement and disagreement expressions across 
different sizes of labeled terms (L). We find that 
more labeled terms improves p@n which is 
intuitive. We used 500 labeled terms in all our 
subsequent experiments. The result in Table 4 
uses relevance ranking (§4). 

Disagreement expressions (𝜑𝑒=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐸  ) 
I, disagree, I don’t, I disagree, argument, reject, claim, I reject, I refute, and, your, I refuse, won’t, the claim, 
nonsense, I contest, dispute, I think, completely disagree, don’t accept, don’t agree, incorrect, doesn’t, hogwash, I 
don’t buy your, I really doubt, your nonsense, true, can you prove, argument fails, you fail to, your assertions, 
bullshit, sheer nonsense, doesn’t make sense, you have no clue, how can you say, do you even, contradict yourself, … 

Agreement expressions (𝜑𝑒=𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐸 ) 
agree, I, correct, yes, true, accept, I agree, don’t, indeed correct, your, I accept, point, that, I concede, is valid, your 
claim, not really, would agree, might, agree completely, yes indeed, absolutely, you’re correct, valid point, 
argument, the argument, proves, do accept, support, agree with you, rightly said, personally, well put, I do 
support, personally agree, doesn’t necessarily, exactly, very well put, kudos, point taken, ...

We now compare with the performance of the 
model without using phrase relevance ranking. 
P@n results using all tokens (4356787) are 
shown in Table 5 (with 500 labeled terms for 
Max-Ent training). Clearly, P@n is lower than in 
Table 4 (last row; with phrase relevance ranking) 
because without phrase relevance ranking (Table 
5) many irrelevant terms can rank high due to co-
occurrences which may not be semantically 
related. This shows that relevance ranking of 
phrases is beneficial.   

6.3 Pair Interaction Nature 
We now evaluate the overall interaction nature of 
each pair of users. The evaluation of this task 
requires human judges to read all the posts where 
the two users forming the pair have interacted.  
Thus, it is hard to evaluate all 1461 pairs in our 
dataset. Instead, we randomly sampled 500 pairs 
(≈ 34% of the population) for evaluation. Two 
human judges were asked to independently read 
all the post interactions of 500 pairs and label 
each pair as overall “disagreeing” or overall 
“agreeing” or “none”. The 𝜅𝐶𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑛  for this task 
was 0.81. Pairs were finally labeled as agreeing 
or disagreeing if both judges deemed them so. 
This resulted in 320 disagreeing and 152 
agreeing pairs. Out of the rest 28 pairs, 10 were 
marked “none” by both judges while 18 pairs had 
disagreement in labels. We only focus on the 472 
agreeing and disagreeing pairs. 

As we have labeled data for 472 pairs, we can 
treat identifying pair arguing nature as a text 
classification problem where all interactions 
between a pair are merged in one document 
representing the pair along with the label given 
by judges: agreeing or disagreeing. To compare 
classification performance, we use two feature 
sets: (i) standard word + POS 1-4 grams and (ii) 
AD-expressions from 𝜑𝐸. We use TF-IDF as our 
feature value assignment scheme. We also try 
two well-known feature selection schemes Chi-
Squared Test (χ2) and Information Gain (IG). We 
use the linear kernel6 SVM (SVMlight system in 
(Joachims, 1999)) as our text classifier. For 
feature selection using χ2 and IG, we use two 
settings: top 1% and 2% of all features ranked 
according to the selection metric. Also, for 
estimated AD-expressions (according to 
probabilities in 𝜑𝐸 ), we experiment with top 
1000 and 2000 AD-expressions terms for both 
agreement and disagreement. We summarize 

                                                           
6  Other kernels polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid did not 
perform as well. 

comparison results using 5-fold Cross Validation 
(CV) with two classes: agreeing and disagreeing 
in Table 6. JTE-P-posterior represents the 
method using simply the model posterior on 𝜃𝑝𝐸 
to make the decision (see §5). From Table 6, we 
can make the following observations.  

Predicting agreeing arguing nature is harder 
than that of disagreeing across all feature 
settings. Feature selection improves performance. 
χ2 and IG perform similarly. AD-expressions, 
𝜑𝐸yields the best performance showing that the 
discovered AD-expressions are of high quality 
and reflect the user pair arguing nature well. 
Selecting certain top terms in 𝜑𝐸  can also be 
viewed as a form of feature selection. Although 
prediction performance using model posterior 
(JTE-P-posterior) is slightly lower than 
supervised SVM (Table 6, second row), the F1 
scores are decent. Using the discovered AD-
expressions (Table 6, last low) as features 
renders a statistically significant (see Table 6 
caption) improvement over other baseline feature 
settings. This shows that discovered AD-
expressions are useful for downstream 
applications, e.g., the task of identifying pair 
interactions. 

7 Conclusion 
This paper studied the problem of modeling user 
pair interactions in online discussions with the 
purpose of discovering the interaction or arguing 
nature of each author pair and various AD-
expressions emitted in debates. A novel 
technique was also proposed to rank n-gram 
phrases where relevance based ranking was used 
in conjunction with a semi-supervised generative 
model. This method enables us to find better AD-
expressions. Experiments using real-life online 
debate data showed the effectiveness of the 
model. In our future work, we intend to extend 
the model to account for stances, and issue 
specific interactions which would pave the way 
for user profiling and behavioral modeling.
