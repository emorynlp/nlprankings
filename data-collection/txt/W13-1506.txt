Abstract 

Many existing approaches for measuring text 
complexity tend to overestimate the complexi-
ty levels of informational texts while simulta-
neously underestimating the complexity levels 
of literary texts. We present a two-stage esti-
mation technique that successfully addresses 
this problem.  At Stage 1, each text is classi-
fied into one or another of three possible ge-
nres:  informational, literary or mixed.  Next, 
at Stage 2, a complexity score is generated for 
each text by applying one or another of three 
possible prediction models:  one optimized for 
application to informational texts, one opti-
mized for application to literary texts, and one 
optimized for application to mixed texts.  
Each model combines lexical, syntactic and 
discourse features, as appropriate, to best rep-
licate human complexity judgments. We dem-
onstrate that resulting text complexity 
predictions are both unbiased, and highly cor-
related with classifications provided by expe-
rienced educators. 

1 Introduction 

Automated text analysis systems, such as reada-
bility metrics, are frequently used to assess the 
probability that texts with varying combinations of 
linguistic features will be more or less accessible to 
readers with varying levels of reading comprehen-
sion skill (Stajner, Evans, Orasan and Mitkov, 

2012).  This paper introduces TextEvaluator, a ful-
ly-automated text analysis system designed to faci-
litate such work.1

 Our approach for addressing these differences 
can be summarized as follows.  First, a large set of 
lexical, syntactic and discourse features is ex-
tracted from each text.  Next, either human raters, 
or an automated genre classifier is used to classify 
each text into one or another of three possible ge-
nre categories: informational, literary, or mixed.  
Finally, a complexity score is generated for each 
text by applying one or another of three possible 
prediction models: one optimized for application to 
informational texts, one optimized for application 
to literary texts, and one optimized for application 
to mixed texts. We demonstrate that resulting 
complexity measures are both unbiased, and highly 
correlated with text grade level (GL) classifications 
provided by experienced educators.  

 TextEvaluator successfully 
addresses an important limitation of many existing 
readability metrics:  the tendency to over-predict 
the complexity levels of informational texts, while 
simultaneously under-predicting the complexity 
levels of literary texts (Sheehan, Kostin & Futagi, 
2008; Sheehan, Kostin, Futagi & Flor, 2010). We 
illustrate this phenomenon, and argue that it results 
from two fundamental differences between infor-
mational and literary texts:  (a) differences in the 
way that common every-day words are used and 
combined; and (b) differences in the rate at which 
rare words are repeated.

Our paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 
summarizes related work on readability assess-
ment. Section 3 describes the two corpora assem-
bled for use in this study, and outlines how genre 
and GL classifications were assigned.  Section 4 
illustrates the problem of genre bias by considering 
the specific biases detected in two widely-used 
readability metrics.  Section 5 describes the Text- 
Evaluator features, methods and results. Section 6 
presents a summary and discussion. 

2    Related Work  

Despite the large numbers of text features that may 
potentially contribute to the ease or difficulty of 
comprehending complex text, many widely-used 
readability metrics are based on extremely limited 
feature sets.  For example, the Flesch-Kincaid GL 
score (Kincaid, et al., 1975), the FOG Index (Gun-
ning, 1952), and the Lexile Framework (Stenner, et 
al., 2006) each consider just two features: a single 
measure of syntactic complexity (average sentence 
length) and a single measure of lexical difficulty 
(either average word length in syllables, average 
frequency of multi-syllable words, or average word 
familiarity estimated via a word frequency, WF, 
index).  

Recently, more computationally sophisticated 
modeling techniques such as Statistical Language 
Models (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson 
and Callan, 2004, Heilman, et al., 2007, Pitler and 
Nenkova, 2008), Support Vector Machines 
(Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), Principal Com-
ponents Analyses (Sheehan, et al., 2010) and Mul-
ti-Layer Perceptron classifiers (Vajjala and 
Meurers, 2012) have enabled researchers to inves-
tigate a broader range of potentially useful fea-
tures.  For example: Schwarm and Ostendorf 
(2005) demonstrated that vocabulary measures 
based on trigrams were effective at distinguishing 
articles targeted at younger and older readers; Pit-
ler and Nenkova (2008) reported improved validity 
for measures based on the likelihood of vocabulary 
and the likelihood of discourse relations; and Vaj-
jala and Meurers (2012) demonstrated that features 
inspired by Second Language Acquisition research 
also contributed to validity improvements.  Impor-
tantly, however, while this research has contributed 
to our understanding of the types of text features 
that may cause texts to be more or less compre-

hensible, evaluations focused on the presence and 
degree of genre bias have not been reported. 

3   Corpora   

Two text collections are considered in this re-
search.  Our training corpus includes 934 passages 
selected from a set of previously administered 
standardized assessments constructed to provide 
valid and reliable feedback about the types of ver-
bal reasoning skills described in U.S. state and na-
tional assessment frameworks. Human judgments 
of genre (informational, literary or mixed) and GL 
(grades 3-12) were available for all texts.  Genre 
classifications were based on established guide-
lines which place texts structured to inform or per-
suade (e.g., newspaper text, excerpts from science 
or social studies textbooks) in the informational 
category, and texts structured to provide a reward-
ing literary experience (e.g., folk tales, short sto-
ries, excerpts from novels) in the literary category 
(see American Institutes for Research, 2008). We 
added a Mixed category to accommodate texts 
classified as incorporating both informational and 
literary elements.  Nelson, Perfetti, Liben and Li-
ben (2012) describe an earlier, somewhat smaller 
version of this dataset.  We added additional pas-
sages downloaded from State Department of Edu-
cation web sites, and from the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  In 
each case, GL classifications reflected the GLs at 
which passages were administered to students.  
Thus, all passages classified at Grade 3 appeared 
on high-stakes assessments constructed to provide 
evidence of student performance relative to Grade 
3 reading standards.  

Two important characteristics of this dataset 
should be noted.  First, unlike many previous cor-
pora, (e.g., Stenner, et al., 2006; Zeno, et al., 2005) 
accurate paragraph markings are included for all 
texts. Second, while many of the datasets consi-
dered in previous readability research were com-
prised entirely of informational text (e.g., Pitler 
and Nenkova, 2008; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 
2005;  Vajjala and Meurers, 2012) the current da-
taset covers the full range of text types considered 
by teachers and students in U.S. classrooms.   

Table 1 shows the numbers of informational, li-
terary and mixed training passages at each targeted 
GL.  Passage lengths ranged from 112 words at 
Grade 3, to more than 2000 words at Grade 12. 

50



Average passage lengths were 569 words and 695 
words in the informational and literary subsets, 
respectively.

now been adopted in 46 U.S. states. Individual 
texts were contributed by teachers, librarians, cur-
riculum experts, and reading researchers.  GL clas-
sifications are designed to illustrate the “staircase 
of increasing complexity” that teachers and test 
developers are being encouraged to replicate when 
selecting texts for use in K-12 instruction and as-
sessment in the U.S.  The staircase is specified in 
terms of five grade bands:  Grades 2-3, Grades 4-5, 
Grades 6-8, Grades 9-10 or Grades 11+.  Table 2

4   Genre Bias 
   
This section examines the root causes of genre bi-
as. We focus on two fundamental differences be-
tween informational and literary texts: differences 
in the types of vocabularies employed, and differ-
ences in the rate at which rare words are repeated.  
These differences have been examined in several 
previous studies.  For example, Lee (2001) docu-
mented differences in the use of “core” vocabulary 
within a corpus of informational and literary texts 
that included over one million words downloaded 
from the British National Corpus.  Core vocabulary 
was defined in terms of a list of 2000 common 
words classified as appropriate for use in the dic-
tionary definitions presented in the Longman Dic-
tionary of Contemporary English.  The analyses 
demonstrated that core vocabulary usage was high-
er in literary texts than in informational texts.  For 
example, when literary texts such as fiction, poetry 
and drama were considered, the percent of total 
words classified as “core” vocabulary ranged from 
81% to 84%.  By contrast, when informational 
texts such as science and social studies texts were 
considered, the percent of total words classified as 
“core” vocabulary ranged from 66% to 71%.  In 
interpreting these results Lee suggested that the 
creativity and imaginativeness typically associated 
with literary writing may be less closely tied to the 
type or level of vocabulary employed and more 
closely tied to the way that core words are used 
and combined.  Note that this implies that an indi-
vidual word detected in a literary text may not be 
indicative of the same level of processing chal-
lenge as that same word detected in an informa-
tional text. 

Differences in the vocabularies employed within 
informational and literary texts, and subsequent 
impacts on readability metrics, are also discussed 
in Appendix A of the Common Core State Stan-
dards (CCSSI, 2010).  The tendency of many exist-
ing readability metrics to underestimate the 
complexity levels of literary texts is described as 
follows: “The Lexile Framework, like traditional 
formulas, may underestimate the difficulty of texts 
that use simple, familiar language to convey so-
phisticated ideas, as is true of much high-quality 
fiction written for adults and appropriate for older 
students” (p. 7).  

Genre bias may also result from genre-specific 
differences in word repetition rates.  Hiebert and 

51



Mesmer (2013, p.46) describe this phenomenon as 
follows:  “Content area texts often receive inflated 
readability scores since key concept words that are 
rare (e.g., photosynthesis, inflation) are often re-
peated which increases vocabulary load, even 
though repetition of content words can support 
student learning (Cohen & Steinberg, 1983)”.  

Table 3 provides empirical evidence of these 
trends.  The table presents mean GL classifications 
estimated conditional on mean WF scores, for the 
informational (n = 399) and literary (n = 452) pas-
sages in our training dataset.  WF scores were gen-
erated via an in-house WF index constructed from 
a corpus of more than 400 million word tokens.  
The corpus includes more than 17,000 complete 
books, including both fiction and nonfiction titles.

Table 3.  Mean GL classifications, by Average WF 
score, for informational and literary passages targeted at 
readers in grades 3 through 12.   

 
The results in Table 3 confirm that, consistent 

with expectations, texts with lower average WF 
scores are more likely to appear on assessments 
targeted at older readers, while texts with higher 
average WF scores are more likely to appear on 
assessments targeted at younger readers.  But note 
that large genre differences are also present. Figure 
1 provides a graphical representation of these 
trends.  Results for informational texts are plotted 
with a solid line; those for literary texts are plotted 
with a dashed line. Note that the literary curve ap-
pears above the informational curve throughout the 
entire observed range of the data. This suggests 
that a given value of the Average WF measure is 
indicative of a higher GL classification if the text 
in question is a literary text, and a lower GL classi-

fication if the text in question is an informational 
text. Since a readability measure that includes this 
feature (or a feature similar to this feature) without 
also accounting for genre effects will tend to yield 
predictions that fall between the two curves, result-
ing GL predictions will tend to be too high for in-
formational texts (positive bias) and too low for 
literary texts (negative bias).

2 All Lexile scores were obtained via the Lexile Analyzer 
available at www.lexile.com. Scores are only available for a 
subset of texts since our training corpus included just 548 
passages at the time that these data were collected. Corres-
ponding human GL classifications were approximately evenly 
distributed across grades 3 through 12. 

. Each individual plot compares 
Flesch-Kincaid GL scores (top row), or Lexile 
scores (bottom row) to the human GL classifica-
tions stored in our training dataset, i.e., classifica-
tions that were developed and reviewed by 
experienced educators, and were subsequently used 
to make high-stakes decisions about students and 
teachers, e.g., requiring students to repeat a grade 
rather than advancing to the next GL. The plots 
confirm that, in each case, the predicted pattern of 
over- and under-estimation is present. That is, on 
average, both Flesch-Kincaid scores and Lexile 
scores tend to be slightly too high for informational 
texts, and slightly too low for literary texts, thereby 
calling into doubt any cross-genre comparisons.

5  Features, Components and Results 

5.1 Features 
 

The TextEvaluator feature set is designed to 
measure the ease or difficulty of implementing 
four types of processes believed to be critically 
involved in comprehending complex text: (1) 
processes involved in word recognition and decod-
ing, (2) processes associated with using relevant 
syntactic knowledge to assemble words into mea-
ningful propositions, (3) processes associated with 
inferring connections across propositions or larger 
sections of text, and (4) processes associated with 
using relevant prior knowledge and experience to 
develop a more complete, more integrated mental 
representation of a text. (See Kintsch, 1998). 

A total of 43 candidate features were developed. 
Since many of these were expected to be moderate-
ly inter-correlated, a Principal Components Analy-
sis (PCA) was used to locate clusters of features 
that exhibited high within-cluster correlation and 

low between-cluster correlation.  Linear combina-
tions defined in terms of the resulting feature clus-
ters provided the independent variables considered 
in subsequent investigations.  Biber and his col-
leagues (2004) justify this approach by noting that, 
because many important aspects of text variation 
are not well captured by individual linguistic fea-
tures, investigation of such characteristics requires 
a focus on “constellations of co-occurring linguis-
tic features” as opposed to individual features (p. 
45). 

The PCA suggested that more than 60% of the 
variation captured by the full set of 43 features 
could be accounted for via a set of eight compo-
nent scores, where each component is estimated as 
a linear combination of multiple correlated fea-
tures, and only 3 of the 43 features had moderately 
high loadings on more than one component, and 
most loadings exceeded 0.70.  The individual fea-
tures comprising each component are described 
below.  

Component #1:  Academic Vocabulary.  Ten 
features loaded heavily on this component.  Two 
are based on the Academic Word List described in 
Coxhead (2000). These include:  the frequency per 
thousand words of all words on the Academic 
Word List, and the ratio of listed words to total 
words.  In a previous study, Vajjala and Meurers 
(2012)  demonstrated that the ratio of listed words 
to total wards was very effective at distinguishing 
texts at lower and higher levels in the Weekly 
Reader corpus. Two additional features focus on 
the frequency of nominalizations, including one 
estimated from token counts and one estimated 
from type counts. Four additional features are 
based on word lists developed by Biber and his 
colleagues.  These include the frequency per thou-
sand words of academic verbs, abstract nouns, top-
ical adjectives and cognitive process nouns (see 
Biber, 1986, 1988; and Biber, et al., 2004). Two 
measures of word length also loaded on this di-
mension:  average word length measured in syl-
lables, and the frequency per thousand words of 
words containing more than 8 characters.  

Component #2:  Syntactic Complexity. Seven 
features loaded heavily on this component. These 
include features determined from the output of the 
Stanford  Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), as 
well as more easily computed measures such as 
average sentence length, average frequency of long 
sentences (>= 25 words), and average number of 

53



words between punctuation marks (commas, semi-
colons, etc.).  Parse-based features include average 
number of dependent clauses, and an automated 
version of the word “depth” measure introduced by 
Yngve (1960). This last feature, called Average 
Maximum Yngve Depth, is designed to capture 
variation in the memory load imposed by sentences 
with varying syntactic structures. It is estimated by 
first assigning a depth classification to each word 
in the text, then determining the maximum depth 
represented within each sentence, and then averag-
ing over resulting sentence-level estimates to ob-
tain a passage-level estimate.  Several studies of 
this word depth measure have been reported. For 
example, Bormuth (1964) reported a correlation of 
-0.78 between mean word depth scores and cloze 
fill-in rates provided by Japanese EFL learners.  

Component #3:  Concreteness. Words that are 
more concrete are more likely to evoke meaningful 
mental images, a response that has been shown to 
facilitate comprehension (Coltheart, 1981). Alder-
son (2000) argued that the level of concreteness 
present in a text is a useful feature to consider 
when evaluating passages for use on reading as-
sessments targeted at L2 readers. A total of five 
concreteness and imageability measures loaded 
heavily on this dimension.  All five measures are 
based on concreteness and imageability ratings 
downloaded from the MRC psycholinguistic data-
base (Coltheart, 1981).  Ratings are expressed on a 
7 point scale with 1 indicating least concrete, or 
least imageable, and 7 indicating most concrete or 
most imageable.   

Component #4:  Word Unfamiliarity. This com-
ponent summarizes variation detected via six dif-
ferent features.  Two features are measures of 
average word familiarity: one estimated via our in-
house WF Index, and one estimated via the TASA 
WF Index (see Zeno, et al., 1995).  Both features 
have negative loadings, suggesting that the com-
ponent is measuring vocabulary difficulty as op-
posed to vocabulary easiness. The other features 
with high loadings on this component are all meas-
ures of rare word frequency. These all have posi-
tive loadings since texts with large numbers of rare 
words are expected to be more difficult. Two types 
of rare word indices are included: indices based on 
token counts and indices based on type counts. 
Vocabulary measures based on token counts view 
each new word as an independent comprehension 
challenge, even when the same word occurs re-

peatedly throughout the text. By contrast, vocabu-
lary measures based on type counts assume that a 
passage containing five different unfamiliar words 
may be more challenging than a passage contain-
ing the same unfamiliar word repeated five times. 
This difference is consistent with the notion that 
each repetition of an unknown word provides an 
additional opportunity to connect to prior know-
ledge (Cohen & Steinberg, 1983).  

Component #5:  Interactive/Conversational 
Style.  This component includes the frequency per 
thousand words of:  conversation verbs, fiction 
verbs, communication verbs, 1st person plural pro-
nouns, contractions, and words enclosed in quotes.  
Verb types were determined from one or more of 
the following studies: Biber (1986),  Biber (1988), 
and Biber, et al. (2004).   

Component #6:  Degree of Narrativity. Three 
features had high positive loadings on this dimen-
sion:  Frequency of past perfect aspect verbs, fre-
quency of past tense verbs and frequency of 3rd 
person singular pronouns.  All three features have 
previously been classified as providing positive 
evidence of the degree of narrativity exhibited in a 
text (see Biber, 1986 and Biber, 1988). 

Component #7:  Cohesion. Cohesion is that 
property of a text that enables it to be interpreted as 
a “coherent message” rather than a collection of 
unrelated clauses and sentences.  Halliday and Ha-
san (1976) argued that readers are more likely to 
interpret a text as a “coherent message”  when cer-
tain observable features are present.  These include 
repeated content words and explicit connectives.  
The seventh component extracted in the PCA in-
cludes three different types of cohesion features.  
The first two features measure the frequency of 
content word repetition across adjacent sentences 
within paragraphs. These measures differ from the 
cohesion measures discussed in Graesser et al. 
(2004) and in Pitler and Nenkova (2008) in that a 
psychometric linking procedure is used to ensure 
that results for different texts are reported on com-
parable scales (See Sheehan, in press).  The fre-
quency of causal conjuncts (therefore, 
consequently, etc.) also loads on this dimension. 

Component #8:  Argumentation.  Two features 
have high loadings on this dimension:  the fre-
quency of concessive and adversative conjuncts 
(although, though, alternatively, in contrast, etc.), 
and the frequency of negations (no, neither, etc.), 
Just and Carpenter, (1987).

5.2  An Automated Genre Classifier 
 

A preliminary automated genre classifier was 
developed by training a logistic regression model 
to predict the probability that a text is classified as 
informational  as opposed to literary.  A signifi-
cant positive coefficient was obtained for the Aca-
demic Vocabulary component defined above, 
suggesting that a high score on this component 
may be interpreted as an indication that the text is 
more likely to be informational.  Significant nega-
tive coefficients were obtained for Narrativity, In-
teractive/Conversational Style, and Syntactic 
Complexity, indicating that a high score on any of 
these components may be interpreted as an indica-
tion that the text is more likely to be literary.  Two 
individual features that were not included in the 
PCA were also significant:  the proportion of adja-
cent sentences containing at least one overlapping 
stemmed content word, and the frequency of 1st 
person singular pronouns.  These features were not 
included in the PCA because they are not reliably 
indicative of differences in text complexity (See 
Sheehan, in press; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008.) Re-
sults confirmed, however, that these features are 
useful for predicting a text’s genre classification.  

Alternative decision rules based on this model 
were investigated. Table 4 summarizes the levels 
of precision (P), recall (R) and F1 = 2RP/(R+P) 
obtained for the selected decision rule which was 
defined as follows: Classify as informational if 
P(Inf) >= 0.52, classify as literary if P(inf) < 0.48, 
else classify as mixed. This decision rule is defined 
such that few texts are classified into the mixed 
category since, at present, the training dataset in-
cludes very few mixed texts. The table shows de-
creased precision in the Validation dataset since 
many more mixed texts are included, and the ma-
jority of these were classified as informational.

5.3  Prediction Equations 
 

We use separate genre-specific regression mod-
els to generate GL predictions for texts classified 
as informational, literary, or mixed. The coeffi-
cients estimated for informational and literary texts 
are shown in Table 5. Note that each component is 
significant in one or both models.  The table also 
highlights key genre differences. For example, note 
that the Interactive/Conv. Style score is significant 
in the Inf. model but not in the Literary model.  
This reflects the fact that, while literary texts at all 
GLs tend to exhibit relatively high interactivity, 
similarly high interactivity among inf. texts tends 
to only be present at the lowest GLs.  Thus, a high 
Interactivity is an indication of low complexity if 
the text in question is an informational text, but 
provides no statistically significant evidence about 
complexity if the text in question is a literary text.

5.4  Validity Evidence 
 

Two aspects of system validity are of interest: 
(a) whether genre bias is present, and (b) whether 
complexity scores correlate well with judgments 
provided by professional educators, i.e., the educa-
tors involved in selecting texts for use on high-
stakes state reading assessments. The issue of ge-
nre bias is addressed in Figure 3. Each plot com-
pares GL predictions generated via TextEvaluator 
to GL predictions provided by experienced educa-
tors.  Note that no evidence of a systematic tenden-
cy to under-predict the complexity levels of 
literary texts is present. This suggests that our 
strategy of developing distinct prediction models 
for informational and literary texts has succeeded 
in overcoming the genre biases present among 
many key features.

TestEvaluator performance relative to the goal of 
predicting the human grade band classifications in 
the validation dataset was also examined. Results 
are summarized in Table 6 along with correspond-
ing results for the Lexile Framework (Stenner, et 
al., 2006) and the REAP system (Heilman, et al., 
2007).  All results are reprinted, with permission, 
from Nelson, et al., (2012).  In each case, perfor-
mance is summarized in terms of the Spearman 
rank order correlation between the readability 
scores generated for each text, and corresponding 
human grade band classifications.  95% confidence 
limits estimated via the Fisher r to z transformation 
are also listed.

The comparison suggests that, relative to the task 
of  predicting the human grade band classifications 
assigned to the informational, literary and mixed 
texts in Appendix B of the new Common Core 
State Standards, TextEvaluator is significantly 
more effective than both the Lexile Framework 
and the REAP system. 

6  Summary and Discussion 
 
In many recent studies, proposed readability me-
trics have been trained and validated on text collec-
tions composed entirely of informational text, e.g., 
Wall Street Journal articles (Pitler and Nenkova, 
2008), Encyclopedia Britannica articles (Schwarm 
and Ostendorf, 2005) and Weekly Reader articles 
(Vajjala and Meurers, 2012). This paper considers 
the more challenging task of predicting human-
assigned GL classifications in a corpus of texts 
constructed to be representative of the broad range 
of reading materials considered by teachers and 
students in U.S. classrooms.   

Two approaches for modeling the complexity 
characteristics of these passages were compared.  
In Approach #1, a single, non-genre specific pre-
diction equation is estimated, and that equation is 
then applied to texts in all genres.  Two measures 
developed via this approach were evaluated:  the 
Lexile Framework and the REAP system.    

Approach #2 differs from Approach #1 in that 
genre-specific prediction equations are used, there-
by ensuring that important genre effects are ac-
commodated.  This approach is currently only 
available via the TextEvaluator system.  

Measures developed via each approach were 
evaluated on a held-out sample.  Results confirmed 
that complexity classifications obtained via                       
TextEvaluator are significantly more highly corre-
lated with the human grade band classifications in 
the held-out sample than are classifications ob-
tained via the Lexile Framework or REAP system.  

This study also demonstrated that, when genre 
effects are ignored, readability scores for informa-
tional texts tend to be overestimated, while those 
for literary texts tend to be underestimated. Note 
that this finding significantly complicates the 
process of using readability metrics to generate 
valid cross-genre comparisons. For example, 
Stajner, et al. (2012) conclude that SimpleWiki 
may not serve as a “gold standard” of high acces-
sibility because comparisons based on readability 
metrics suggest that it is more complex than Fic-
tion. We intend to further investigate this finding 
using TextEvaluator since conclusions that are not 
impacted by genre bias can then be reported. Addi-
tional planned work involves investigating addi-
tional measures of genre, and incorporating these 
into our genre classifier.
