Abstract

When applying machine learning to prob-
lems in NLP, there are many choices to
make about how to represent input texts.
They can have a big effect on perfor-
mance, but they are often uninteresting
to researchers or practitioners who simply
need a module that performs well. We ap-
ply sequential model-based optimization
over this space of choices and show that it
makes standard linear models competitive
with more sophisticated, expensive state-of-
the-art methods based on latent variables or
neural networks on various topic classifica-
tion and sentiment analysis problems. Our
approach is a first step towards black-box
NLP systems that work with raw text and
do not require manual tuning.

1 Introduction

NLP researchers and practitioners spend a consid-
erable amount of time comparing machine-learned
models of text that differ in relatively uninteresting
ways. For example, in categorizing texts, should
the “bag of words” include bigrams, and is tf-idf
weighting a good idea? In learning word embed-
dings, distributional similarity approaches have
been shown to perform competitively with neural
network models when the hyperparameters (e.g.,
context window, subsampling rate, smoothing con-
stant) are carefully tuned (Levy et al., 2015). These
choices matter experimentally, often leading to big
differences in performance, with little consistency
across tasks and datasets in which combination of
choices works best. Unfortunately, these differ-
ences tell us little about language or the problems
that machine learners are supposed to solve.

We propose that these decisions can be auto-
mated in a similar way to hyperparameter selection
(e.g., choosing the strength of a ridge or lasso regu-
larizer). Given a particular text dataset and classi-
fication task, we show a technique for optimizing
over the space of representational choices, along

with other “nuisances” that interact with these de-
cisions, like hyperparameter selection. For exam-
ple, using higher-order n-grams means more fea-
tures and a need for stronger regularization and
more training iterations. Generally, these decisions
about instance representation are made by humans,
heuristically; our work seeks to automate them, not
unlike Daelemans et al. (2003), who proposed to
use genetic algorithms to optimize representational
choices.

Our technique instantiates sequential model-
based optimization (SMBO; Hutter et al., 2011).
SMBO and other Bayesian optimization ap-
proaches have been shown to work well for hyper-
parameter tuning (Bergstra et al., 2011; Hoffman
et al., 2011; Snoek et al., 2012). Though popular
in computer vision (Bergstra et al., 2013), these
techniques have received little attention in NLP.

We apply it to logistic regression on a range of
topic and sentiment classification tasks. Consis-
tently, our method finds representational choices
that perform better than linear baselines previously
reported in the literature, and that, in some cases,
are competitive with more sophisticated non-linear
models trained using neural networks.

2 Problem Formulation and Notation

Let the training data consist of a collection of pairs
dtrain = 〈〈d.i1, d.o1〉, . . . , 〈d.in, d.on〉〉, where
each input d.i ∈ I is a text document and each
output d.o ∈ O, the output space. The overall
training goal is to maximize a performance func-
tion f (e.g., classification accuracy, log-likelihood,
F1 score, etc.) of a machine-learned model, on a
held-out dataset, ddev ∈ (I× O)n′ .

Classification proceeds in three steps: first,
x : I → RN maps each input to a vector rep-
resentation. Second, a predictive model (typi-
cally, its parameters) is learned from the inputs
(now transformed into vectors) and outputs: L :
(RN × O)n → (RN → O). Finally, the resulting
classifier c : I → O is fixed as L(dtrain) ◦ x (i.e.,
the composition of the representation function with

2100



the learned mapping).
Here we consider linear classifiers of the form

c(d.i) = arg maxo∈O w>o x(d.i), where the param-
eters wo ∈ RN , for each output o, are learned
using logistic regression on the training data. We
let w denote the concatenation of all wo. Hence
the parameters can be understood as a function of
the training data and the representation function
x. The performance function f , in turn, is a func-
tion of the held-out data ddev and x—also w and
dtrain , through x. For simplicity, we will write
“f(x)” when the rest are clear from context.

Typically, x is fixed by the model designer, per-
haps after some experimentation, and learning fo-
cuses on selecting the parameters w. For logistic
regression and many other linear models, this train-
ing step reduces to convex optimization in N |O|
dimensions—a solvable problem that is costly for
large datasets and/or large output spaces. In seek-
ing to maximize f with respect to x, we do not wish
to carry out training any more times than necessary.

Choosing x can be understood as a problem of
selecting hyperparameter values. We therefore turn
to Bayesian optimization, a family of techniques
that can be used to select hyperparameter values
intelligently when solving for parameters (w) is
costly.

3 Bayesian Optimization

Our approach is based on sequential model-based
optimization (SMBO; Hutter et al., 2011). It itera-
tively chooses representation functions x. On each
round, it makes this choice through a probabilistic
model of f , then evaluates f—we call this a “trial.”
As in any iterative search algorithm, the goal is to
balance exploration of options for x with exploita-
tion of previously-explored options, so that a good
choice is found in a small number of trials.

More concretely, in the tth trial, xt is selected
using an acquisition function A and a “surrogate”
probabilistic model pt. Second, f is evaluated
given xt—an expensive operation which involves
training to learn parameters w and assessing per-
formance on the held-out data. Third, the surrogate
model is updated. See Algorithm 1; details on A
and pt follow.

Acquisition Function. A good acquisition func-
tion returns high values for x when either the value
f(x) is predicted to be high, or the uncertainty
about f(x)’s value is high; balancing between
these is the classic tradeoff between exploitation

and exploration. We use a criterion called Expected
Improvement (EI; Jones, 2001),1 which is the ex-
pectation (under the current surrogate model pt)
that f(x) = y will exceed f(x∗) = y∗:

A(x; pt, y∗) =
∫ ∞
−∞

max(y − y∗, 0)pt(y | x)dy

where x∗ is chosen depending on the surrogate
model, discussed below. (For now, think of it as
a strongly-performing “benchmark” discovered in
earlier iterations.) Other options for the acquisition
function include maximum probability of improve-
ment (Jones, 2001), minimum conditional entropy
(Villemonteix et al., 2009), Gaussian process up-
per confidence bound (Srinivas et al., 2010), or a
combination of them (Hoffman et al., 2011).

Surrogate Model. As a surrogate model, we use
a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE; Bergstra
et al., 2011).2 This is a nonparametric approach to
density estimation. We seek to estimate pt(y | x)
where y = f(x), the performance function that is
expensive to compute exactly. The TPE approach

seeks pt(y | x) ∝ pt(y) ·
{

p<t (x), if y<y
∗

p≥t (x), if y≥y∗
, where

p<t and p
≥
t are densities estimated using observa-

tions from previous trials that are less than and
greater than y∗, respectively. In TPE, y∗ is defined
as some quantile of the observed y from previous
trials; we use 15-quantiles.

As shown by Bergstra et al. (2011), the Ex-
pected Improvement in TPE can be written as:

1EI is the most widely used acquisition function that has
been shown to work well on a range of tasks.

2Another common approach to the surrogate is the Gaus-
sian process (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Hoffman et al.,
2011; Snoek et al., 2012). Like Bergstra et al. (2011), our
preliminary experiments found the TPE to perform favorably.
Further TPE’s tree-structured configuration space is advanta-
geous, because it allows nested definitions of hyperparameters,
which we exploit in our experiments (e.g., only allows bigrams
to be chosen if unigrams are also chosen).

, where

γ = pt(y < y∗), fixed at 0.15 by definition of
y∗ (above). Here, we prefer x with high probability
under p≥t (x) and low probability under p

<
t (x). To

maximize this quantity, we draw many candidates
according to p≥t (x) and evaluate them according
to p<t (x)/p

≥
t (x). Note that p(y) does not need to

be given an explicit form. To compute p<t (x) and
p≥t (x), we associate each hyperparameter with a
node in the graphical model and multiply individ-
ual probabilities at every node—see Bergstra et al.
(2011) for details.

4 Experiments

We fix L to logistic regression. We optimize text
representation based on the types of n-grams used,
the type of weighting scheme, and the removal of
stopwords; we also optimize the regularizer and
training convergence criterion, which interact with
the representation. See Table 1 for a complete list.

Note that even with this limited number of
options, the number of possible combinations is
huge,3 so exhaustive search is computationally ex-
pensive. In all our experiments for all datasets, we
limit ourselves to 30 trials per dataset. The only
preprocessing we applied was downcasing.

We always use a development set to evaluate
f(x) during learning and report the final result on
an unseen test set. We summarize the hyperparam-
eters selected by our method, and the accuracies
achieved (on test data) in Table 5. We discuss com-
parisons to baselines for each dataset in turn. For
each of our datasets, we select supervised, non-
ensemble classification methods from previous lit-
erature as baselines. In each case, we emphasize
comparisons with the best-published linear method

erance are continuous values, but we could discretize them.

(often an SVM with a linear kernel with represen-
tation selected by experts) and the best-published
method overall. In the following, “SVM” always
means “linear SVM.” All methods were trained
and evaluated on the same training/testing splits
as baselines; in cases where standard development
sets were not available, we used a random 20% of
the training data as a development set.

binary classification task where the goal is to pre-
dict whether a review is positive or negative (no
neutral). Our logistic regression model outperforms
the baseline SVM reported by Socher et al. (2013),
who used only unigrams but did not specify the
weighting scheme for their SVM baseline. While
our result is still below the state-of-the-art based
on the the recursive neural tensor networks (Socher
et al., 2013) and the paragraph vector (Le and
Mikolov, 2014), we show that logistic regression is
comparable with recursive and matrix-vector neu-
ral networks (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al.,
2012).

different representations (see Table 5). The last task
is to classify related science documents into four
science topics (sci.crypt, sci.electronics, sci.space,
sci.med; test size = 1, 899). We were not able to
find previous results that are comparable to ours on
this task; we include our result (95.82%) to enable
further comparisons in the future.

5 Discussion

Optimized representations. For each task, the
chosen representation is different. Out of all possi-
ble choices in our experiments (Table 1), each of
them is used by at least one of the datsets (Table 5).
For example, on the Congress vote dataset, we only
need to use bigrams, whereas on the Amazon elec-
tronics dataset we need to use {1, 2, 3}-grams. The
binary weighting scheme works well for most of
the datasets, except the sentence-level sentiment
analysis task, where the tf-idf weighting scheme
was selected. `2 regularization was best in all cases
but one. We do not believe that an NLP expert
would be likely to make these particular choices,
except through the same kind of trial-and-error pro-
cess our method automates efficiently.

Number of trials. We ran 30 trials for each
dataset in our experiments. Figure 1 shows each
trial accuracy and the best accuracy on develop-
ment data as we increase the number of trials for
two datasets. We can see that 30 trials are gener-
ally enough for the model to obtain good results,
although the search space is large.

Transfer learning and multitask setting. We
treat each dataset independently and create a sep-
arate model for each of them. It is also possible
to learn from previous datasets (i.e., transfer learn-
ing) or to learn from all datasets simultaneously
(i.e., multitask learning) to improve performance.
This has the potential to reduce the number of trials

required even further. See Bardenet et al. (2013),
Swersky et al. (2013), and Yogatama and Mann
(2014) for more about how to perform Bayesian
optimization in these settings.

Beyond supervised learning. Our framework
could also be extended to unsupervised and semi-
supervised models. For example, in document clus-
tering (e.g., k-means), we also need to construct
representations for documents. Log-likelihood
might serve as a performance function. A range of
random initializations might be considered. Inves-
tigation of this approach for nonconvex problems
is an exciting area for future work.

6 Conclusion

We used Bayesian optimization to optimize choices
about text representations for various categoriza-
tion problems. Our technique identifies settings for
a standard linear model (logistic regression) that
are competitive with far more sophisticated meth-
ods on topic classification and sentiment analysis.
