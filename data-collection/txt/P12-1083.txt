Abstract

The Chinese comma signals the boundary of
discourse units and also anchors discourse
relations between adjacent text spans. In
this work, we propose a discourse structure-
oriented classification of the comma that can
be automatically extracted from the Chinese
Treebank based on syntactic patterns. We
then experimented with two supervised learn-
ing methods that automatically disambiguate
the Chinese comma based on this classifica-
tion. The first method integrates comma clas-
sification into parsing, and the second method
adopts a “post-processing” approach that ex-
tracts features from automatic parses to train
a classifier. The experimental results show
that the second approach compares favorably
against the first approach.

1 Introduction

The Chinese comma, which looks graphically very
similar to its English counterpart, is functionally
quite different. It has attracted a significant amount
of research that studied the problem from the view-
point of natural language processing. For exam-
ple, Jin et al ( 2004) and Li et al ( 2005) view
the disambiguation of the Chinese comma as a way
of breaking up long Chinese sentences into shorter
ones to facilitate parsing. The idea is to split a
long sentence into multiple comma-separated seg-
ments, parse them individually, and reconstruct the
syntactic parse for the original sentence. Although
both studies show a positive impact of this approach,
comma disambiguation is viewed merely as a con-
venient tool to help achieve a more important goal.

Xue and Yang ( 2011) point out that the very rea-
son for the existence of these long Chinese sentences
is because the Chinese comma is ambiguous and in
some context, it identifies the boundary of a sentence
just as a period, a question mark, or an exclamation
mark does. The disambiguation of comma is viewed
as a necessary step to detect sentence boundaries in
Chinese and it can benefit a whole range of down-
stream NLP applications such as syntactic parsing
and Machine Translation. In Machine Translation,
for example, it is very typical for “one” Chinese
sentence to be translated into multiple English sen-
tences, with each comma-separated segment corre-
sponding to one English sentence. In the present
work, we expand this view and propose to look at
the Chinese comma in the context of discourse anal-
ysis. The Chinese comma is viewed as a delimiter
of elementary discourse units (EDUs), in the sense
of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Carlson et al.,
2002; Mann et al., 1988). It is also considered to
be the anchor of discourse relations, in the sense of
the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDT) (Prasad et al.,
2008). Disambiguating the comma is thus necessary
for the purpose of discourse segmentation, the iden-
tification of EDUs, a first step in building up the dis-
course structure of a Chinese text.

Developing a supervised or semi-supervised
model of discourse segmentation would require
ground truth annotated based on a well-established
representation scheme, but as of right now no such
annotation exists for Chinese to the best of our
knowledge. However, syntactically annotated tree-
banks often contain important clues that can be used
to infer discourse-level information. We present

786



a method of automatically deriving a preliminary
form of discourse structure anchored by the Chinese
comma from the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB)
(Xue et al., 2005), and using this information to
train and test supervised models. This discourse
information is formalized as a classification of the
Chinese comma, with each class representing the
boundary of an elementary discourse unit as well
as the anchor of a coarse-grained discourse rela-
tion between the two discourse units that it delimits.
We then develop two comma classification methods.
In the first method, we replace the part-of-speech
(POS) tag of each comma in the CTB with a de-
rived discourse category and retrain a state-of-the-
art Chinese parser on the relabeled data. We then
evaluate how accurately the commas are classified
in the parsing process. In the second method, we
parse these sentences and extract lexical and syn-
tactic information as features to predict these new
discourse categories. The second approach gives us
more control over what features to extract and our
results show that it compares favorably against the
first approach.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we present our approach to automati-
cally extract discourse information from a syntac-
tically annotated treebank and present our classifi-
cation scheme. In Section 3, we describe our su-
pervised learning methods and the features we ex-
tracted. Section 4 presents our experiment setup and
experimental results. Related work is reviewed in
Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.

2 Chinese comma classification

There are many ways to conceptualize the discourse
structure of a text (Mann et al., 1988; Prasad et
al., 2008), but there is more of a consensus among
researchers about the fundamental building blocks
of the discourse structure. For the Rhetorical Dis-
course Theory, the building blocks are Elementary
Discourse Units (EDUs). For the PDT, the build-
ing blocks are abstract objects such as propositions,
facts. Although they are phrased in different ways,
syntactically these discourse units are generally re-
alized as clauses or built on top of clauses. So the
first step in building the discourse structure of a text
is to identify these discourse units.

In Chinese, these elementary discourse units are
generally delimited by the comma, but not all com-
mas mark the boundaries of a discourse unit. In (1),
for example, Comma [1] marks the boundary of a
discourse unit while Comma [2] does not. This is
reflected in its English translation: while the first
comma corresponds to an English comma, the sec-
ond comma is not translated at all, as it marks the
boundary between a subject and its predicate, where
no comma is needed in English. Disambiguating
these two types of commas is thus an important first
step in identifying elementary discourse units and
building up the discourse structure of a text.

Although to the best of our knowledge, no such
discourse segmented data for Chinese exists in the
public domain, this information can be extracted
from the syntactic annotation of the CTB. In the
syntactic annotation of the sentence, illustrated in
(a), it is clear that while the first comma in the sen-
tence marks the boundary of a clause, the second
one marks the demarcation between the subject NP
and the predicate VP and thus is not an indicator of
a discourse boundary.

In addition to a binary distinction of whether a
comma marks the boundary of a discourse unit,
the CTB annotation also allows the extraction of a
more elaborate classification of commas based on
coordination and subordination relations of comma-
separated clauses. This classification of the Chinese

787



comma can be viewed as a first approximation of the
discourse relations anchored by the comma that can
be refined later via a manual annotation process.

Based on the syntactic annotation in the CTB, we
classify the Chinese comma into seven hierarchi-
cally organized categories, as illustrated in Figure
1. The first distinction is made between commas
that indicate a discourse boundary (RELATION)
and those that do not (OTHER). Commas that in-
dicate discourse boundaries are further divided into
commas that separate coordinated discourse units
(COORD) vs commas that separate discourse units
in a subordination relation (SUBORD). Based on
the levels of embedding and the syntactic category
of the coordinated structures, we define three dif-
ferent types of coordination (SB, IP COORD and
VP COORD). We also define three types of subordi-
nation relations (ADJ, COMP, Sent SBJ), based on
the syntactic structure. As we will show below, each
of the six relations has a clear syntactic pattern that
can be exploited for their automatic detection.

Sentence Boundary (SB): Following (Xue and
Yang, 2011), we consider the loosely coordinated
IPs that are the immediate children of the root IP to
be independent sentences, and the commas separat-
ing them to be delimiters of sentence boundary. This
is illustrated in (2), where a Chinese sentence can be
split into two independent shorter sentences at the
comma. We view this comma to be a marker of the
sentence boundary and it serves the same function as
the unambiguous sentence boundary delimitors (pe-
riods, question marks, exclamation marks) in Chi-
nese. The syntactic pattern that is used to infer this
relation is illustrated in (b).

ample is given in (3) and its typical syntactic pattern
is illustrated in (c).

VP Coordination (VP COORD): Coordinated
VPs, when separated by the comma, are not seman-
tically different from coordinated IPs. The only dif-
ference is that in the latter case, the coordinated VPs

share a subject, while coordinated IPs tend to have
different subjects. Maintaining this distinction allow
us to model subject (dis)continuity, which helps re-
cover a subject when it is dropped, a prevalent phe-
nomenon in Chinese. As shown in (4), the VPs in the
text spans separated by Comma [6] have the same
subject, thus the subject in the second VP is dropped.
The syntactic pattern that allows us to extract this
structure is given in (d).

Adjunction (ADJ): Adjunction is one of three
types of subordination relations we define. It holds
between a subordinate clause and its main clause.
The subordinate clause is normally introduced by a
subordinating conjunction and it typically provides
the cause, purpose, manner, or condition for the
main clause. In the PDT terms, these subordinate
conjunctions are discourse connectives that anchor
a discourse relation between the subordinate clause
and the main clause. In Chinese, with few excep-
tions, the subordinate clause comes before the main
clause. (5) is an example of this relation.

of the functional (dash) tags provided in the tree-
bank. The functional tags are attached to the sub-
ordinate clause and they include CND (conditional),
PRP (purpose or reason), MNR (manner), or ADV
(other types of subordinate clauses that are adjuncts
to the main clause).

Complementation (COMP): When a comma
separates a verb governor and its complement
clause, this verb and its subject generally describe
the attribution of the complement clause. Attribu-
tion is an important notion in discourse analysis in
both the RST framework and in the PDT. An exam-
ple of this is given in (6), and the syntactic pattern
used to extract this relation is illustrated in (f).

Our proposed comma classification scheme
serves the dual purpose of identifying elementary
discourse units and at the same time detecting
coarse-grained discourse relations anchored by the
comma. The discourse relations identified in this
manner by no means constitute the full discourse
analysis of a text, they are, however, a good first
approximation. The advantage of our approach is
that we do not require manual discourse annotations,
and all the information we need is automatically ex-
tracted from the syntactic annotation of the CTB
and attached to instances of the comma in the cor-
pus. This makes it possible for us to train supervised
models to automatically classify the commas in any
Chinese text.

3 Two comma classification methods

Given the gold standard parses, based on the syntac-
tic patterns described in Section 2, we can map the
POS tag of each comma instance in the CTB to one
of the seven classes described in Section 2. Using
this relabeled data as training data, we experimented
with two automatic comma disambiguation meth-
ods. In the first method, we simply retrained the
Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) on the re-
labeled data and computed how accurately the com-
mas are labeled in a held-out test set. In the second
method, we trained a Maximum Entropy classifier
with the Mallet (McCallum et al., 2002) machine
learning package to classify the commas. The fea-
tures are extracted from the CTB data automatically
parsed with the Berkeley parser. We implemented
features described in (Xue and Yang, 2011), and
also experimented with a set of new features as fol-
lows. In general, these new features are extracted
from the two text spans surrounding the comma.
Given a comma, we define the preceding text span as
i span and the following text span as j span. We also
collected a number of subject-predicate pairs from a
large corpus that doesn’t overlap with the CTB. We
refer to this corpus as the auxiliary corpus.

Subject and Predicate features: We explored
various combinations of the subject (sbj), predicate
(pred) and object (obj) of the two spans. The sub-
ject of i span is represented as sbji, etc.

1. The existence of sbji, sbjj , both, or neither.
2. The lemma of predi, the lemma of predj , the

conjunction of sbji and predj , the conjunction
of predi and sbjj

3. whether the conjunction of sbji and predj oc-
curs more than 2 times in the auxiliary corpus
when j does not have a subject.

4. whether the conjunction of obji and predj oc-
curs more than 2 times in the auxiliary corpus
when j does not have a subject

5. Whether the conjunction of predi and sbjj oc-
curs more than 2 times in the auxiliary corpus
when i does not have a subject.

Mutual Information features: Mutual informa-
tion is intended to capture the association strength
between the subject of a previous span and the predi-
cate of the current span. We use Mutual Information

790



(Church and Hanks, 1989) as shown in Equation
(1) and the frequency count computed based on the
auxiliary corpus to measure such constraints.

MI = log2
# co-occur of S and P * corpus size

# S occur * # P occur
(1)

1. The conjunction of sbji and predj when j does
not have a subject if their MIvalue is greater
than -8.0, an empirically established threshold.

2. Whether obji and predj has an MI value
greater than 5.0 if j does not have a subject.

3. Whether the MI value of sbji and predj is
greater than 0.0, and they occur 2 times in the
auxiliary corpus when j doesn’t have a subject.

4. Whether the MI value of obji and predj is
greater than 0.0 and they occur 2 times in the
auxiliary corpus when j doesn’t have a subject.

5. Whether the MI value of predi and sbjj is
greater than 0.0 and they occur more than 2
times in the auxiliary corpus when i does not
have a subject.

Span features: We used span features to cap-
ture syntactic information, e.g. the comma separated
spans are constituents in Tree (b) but not in Tree (d).

1. Whether i forms a single constituent, whether
j forms a single constituent.

2. The conjunction and hierarchical relation of all
constituent labels in i/j, if i/j does not form
a single constituent. The conjunction of all
constituent labels in both spans, if neither span
form a single constituent.

Lexical features:

1. The first word in i if it is an adverb, the first
word in j if it is an adverb.

2. The first word in i span if it is a coordinating
conjunction, the first word in j if it is a coordi-
nating conjunction.

4 Experiments

4.1 Datasets

We use the CTB 6.0 in our experiments and divide
it into training, development and test sets using the
data split recommended in the CTB 6.0 documenta-
tion, as shown in Table 1. There are 5436 commas

in the test set, including 1327 commas that are sen-
tence boundaries (SB), 539 commas that connect co-
ordinated IPs (IP COORD), 1173 commas that join
coordinated VPs (VP COORD), 379 commas that
delimits a subordinate clause and its main clause
(ADJ), 314 commas that anchor complementation
relations (COMP), and 1625 commas that belong to
the OTHER category.

4.2 Results

As mentioned in Section 3, we experimented with
two comma classification methods. In the first
method, we replace the part-of-speech (POS) tags of
the commas with the seven classes defined in Sec-
tion 2. We then retrain the Berkeley parser (Petrov
and Klein, 2007) using the training set as presented
in Table 1, parse the test set, and evaluate the comma
classification accuracy.

In the second method, we use the relabeled com-
mas as the gold-standard data to train a supervised
classifier to automatically classify the commas. As
shown in the previous section, syntactic structures
are an important source of information for our clas-
sifier. For feature extraction purposes, the entire
CTB6.0 is automatically parsed in a round-robin
fashion. We divided CTB 6.0 into 10 portions,
and parsed each portion with a model trained on
other portions, using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and
Klein, 2007). Measured by the ParsEval metric
(Black et al., 1991), the parsing accuracy on the
CTB test set stands at 83.29% (F-score), with a pre-
cision of 85.18% and a recall of 81.49%.

The results are presented in Table 2, which shows
the overall accuracy of the two methods as well as
the results for each individual category. As should
be clear from Table 2, the results for the two meth-
ods are very comparable, with the second method
performing modestly better than the first method.

4.2.1 Subject continuity
One of the goals for this classification scheme is

to model subject continuity, which answers the ques-
tion of how accurately we can predict whether two
comma-separated text spans have the same subject
or different subjects. When the two spans share
the same subject, the comma belongs to the cate-
gory VP COORD. When they have different sub-
jects, they belong to the categories IP COORD or

SB. When this question is meaningless, e.g., when
one of the span does not even have a subject, the
comma belongs to other categories. To evaluate the
performance of our model on this problem, we re-
computed the results by putting IP COORD and SB
in one category, putting VP COORD in another cat-
egory and the rest of the labels in a third category.
The results are presented in Table 3.

4.2.2 The effect of genre
CTB 6.0 consists of data from three different gen-

res, including newswire, magazine and broadcast
news. Data genres may have very different char-
acteristics. To evaluate how our model works on
different genres, we train a model using training
and development sets, and test the model on differ-
ent genres as described in Table 1. The results on
these three genres are presented in Table 4, and they
shows a significant fluctuation across genres. Our
model works the best on newswire, but not as good
on broadcast news and magazine articles.

4.2.3 Comparison with prior work
(Xue and Yang, 2011) presented results on a

binary classification of whether or not a comma
marks a sentence boundary, while the present work
addresses a multi-category classification problem
aimed at identifying discourse segments and prelim-
inary discourse relations anchored by the comma.
However, since we also have a SB category, com-
parison is possible. For comparison purposes, we
retrained our model on their data sets, and computed
the results of SB vs other categories. The results are
shown in Table 5. Our results are very comparable
with (Xue and Yang, 2011) despite that we are per-
forming a multicategory classification.

4.3 Error analysis

Even though our feature-based approach can the-
oretically “correct” parsing errors, meaning that a
comma can in theory be classified correctly even if a
sentence is incorrectly parsed, when examining the
system output, errors in automatic parses often lead
to errors in comma classification. A common pars-
ing error is the confusion between Structures (h) and
(i). If the subject of the text span after a comma is
dropped as shown in (h), the parser often produces
a VP coordination structure as shown in (i) and vice
versa. This kind of parsing errors would lead to er-
rors in our syntactic features and thus directly affect
the accuracy of our model.

5 Related Work

There is a large body of work on discourse analysis
in the field of Natural Language Processing. Most of
the work, however, are on English. An unsupervised
approach was proposed to recognize discourse rela-
tions in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), which extracts
discourse relations that hold between arbitrary spans
of text making use of cue phrases. Like the present
work, a lot of research on discourse analysis is car-
ried out at the sentence level. (Soricut and Marcu,
2003; Sporleder and Lapata, 2005; Polanyi et al.,
2004). (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and (Polanyi et
al., 2004) implement models to perform discourse
parsing, while (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005) intro-
duces discourse chunking as an alternative to full-

The emergence of linguistic corpora annotated

with discourse structure such as the RST Discourse
Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002) and PDT (Miltsakaki
et al., 2004; Prasad et al., 2008) have changed the
landscape of discourse analysis. More robust, data-
driven models are starting to emerge.

Compared with English, much less work has
been done in Chinese discourse analysis, presum-
ably due to the lack of discourse resources in Chi-

Table 5: Comparison of (Xue and Yang, 2011) and the

trains a statistical classifier to recognize discourse
relations. Their work, however, is only concerned
with discourse relations between adjacent sentences,
thus side-stepping the hard problem of disambiguat-
ing the Chinese comma and analyzing intra-sentence
discourse relations. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first in attempting to disambiguating
the Chinese comma as the first step in performing
Chinese discourse analysis.

6 Conclusions and future work

We proposed a approach to disambiguate the Chi-
nese comma as a first step toward discourse analy-
sis. Training and testing data are automatically de-
rived from a syntactically annotated corpus. We pre-
sented two automatic comma disambiguation meth-
ods that perform comparably. In the first method,
comma disambiguation is integrated into the parsing
process while in the second method we train a super-
vised classifier to classify the Chinese comma, us-
ing features extracted from automatic parses. Much
needs to be done in the area, but we believe our work
provides insight into the intricacy and complexity of
discourse analysis in Chinese.
