Abstract

We propose a hierarchical attention network
for document classification. Our model has
two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hier-
archical structure that mirrors the hierarchical
structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels
of attention mechanisms applied at the word-
and sentence-level, enabling it to attend dif-
ferentially to more and less important con-
tent when constructing the document repre-
sentation. Experiments conducted on six large
scale text classification tasks demonstrate that
the proposed architecture outperform previous
methods by a substantial margin. Visualiza-
tion of the attention layers illustrates that the
model selects qualitatively informative words
and sentences.

1 Introduction

Text classification is one of the fundamental task in
Natural Language Processing. The goal is to as-
sign labels to text. It has broad applications includ-
ing topic labeling (Wang and Manning, 2012), senti-
ment classification (Maas et al., 2011; Pang and Lee,
2008), and spam detection (Sahami et al., 1998).
Traditional approaches of text classification repre-
sent documents with sparse lexical features, such
as n-grams, and then use a linear model or kernel
methods on this representation (Wang and Manning,
2012; Joachims, 1998). More recent approaches
used deep learning, such as convolutional neural net-
works (Blunsom et al., 2014) and recurrent neural
networks based on long short-term memory (LSTM)
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to learn text
representations.

pork belly = delicious . || scallops? || I don’t even
like scallops, and these were a-m-a-z-i-n-g . || fun
and tasty cocktails. || next time I in Phoenix, I will
go back here. || Highly recommend.

Figure 1: A simple example review from Yelp 2013 that con-
sists of five sentences, delimited by period, question mark. The

first and third sentence delivers stronger meaning and inside,

the word delicious, a-m-a-z-i-n-g contributes the most in defin-

ing sentiment of the two sentences.

Although neural-network–based approaches to
text classification have been quite effective (Kim,
2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Johnson and Zhang, 2014;
Tang et al., 2015), in this paper we test the hypoth-
esis that better representations can be obtained by
incorporating knowledge of document structure in
the model architecture. The intuition underlying our
model is that not all parts of a document are equally
relevant for answering a query and that determining
the relevant sections involves modeling the interac-
tions of the words, not just their presence in isola-
tion.

Our primary contribution is a new neural archi-
tecture (§2), the Hierarchical Attention Network
(HAN) that is designed to capture two basic insights
about document structure. First, since documents
have a hierarchical structure (words form sentences,
sentences form a document), we likewise construct a
document representation by first building represen-
tations of sentences and then aggregating those into
a document representation. Second, it is observed
that different words and sentences in a documents
are differentially informative. Moreover, the impor-

1480



tance of words and sentences are highly context de-
pendent, i.e. the same word or sentence may be dif-
ferentially important in different context (§3.5). To
include sensitivity to this fact, our model includes
two levels of attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al.,
2014; Xu et al., 2015) — one at the word level and
one at the sentence level — that let the model to
pay more or less attention to individual words and
sentences when constructing the representation of
the document. To illustrate, consider the example
in Fig. 1, which is a short Yelp review where the
task is to predict the rating on a scale from 1–5. In-
tuitively, the first and third sentence have stronger
information in assisting the prediction of the rat-
ing; within these sentences, the word delicious,
a-m-a-z-i-n-g contributes more in implying
the positive attitude contained in this review. At-
tention serves two benefits: not only does it often
result in better performance, but it also provides in-
sight into which words and sentences contribute to
the classification decision which can be of value in
applications and analysis (Shen et al., 2014; Gao et
al., 2014).

The key difference to previous work is that our
system uses context to discover when a sequence of
tokens is relevant rather than simply filtering for (se-
quences of) tokens, taken out of context. To evaluate
the performance of our model in comparison to other
common classification architectures, we look at six
data sets (§3). Our model outperforms previous ap-
proaches by a significant margin.

2 Hierarchical Attention Networks
The overall architecture of the Hierarchical Atten-
tion Network (HAN) is shown in Fig. 2. It con-
sists of several parts: a word sequence encoder, a
word-level attention layer, a sentence encoder and a
sentence-level attention layer. We describe the de-
tails of different components in the following sec-
tions.

2.1 GRU-based sequence encoder

The GRU (Bahdanau et al., 2014) uses a gating
mechanism to track the state of sequences without
using separate memory cells. There are two types of
gates: the reset gate rt and the update gate zt. They
together control how information is updated to the

state. At time t, the GRU computes the new state as

ht = (1− zt)⊙ ht−1 + zt ⊙ h̃t. (1)

This is a linear interpolation between the previous
state ht−1 and the current new state h̃t computed
with new sequence information. The gate zt decides
how much past information is kept and how much
new information is added. zt is updated as:

zt = σ(Wzxt + Uzht−1 + bz), (2)

where xt is the sequence vector at time t. The can-
didate state h̃t is computed in a way similar to a tra-
ditional recurrent neural network (RNN):

h̃t = tanh(Whxt + rt ⊙ (Uhht−1) + bh), (3)

Here rt is the reset gate which controls how much
the past state contributes to the candidate state. If rt
is zero, then it forgets the previous state. The reset
gate is updated as follows:

rt = σ(Wrxt + Urht−1 + br) (4)

2.2 Hierarchical Attention
We focus on document-level classification in this
work. Assume that a document has L sentences

1481



si and each sentence contains Ti words. wit with
t ∈ [1, T ] represents the words in the ith sentence.
The proposed model projects the raw document into
a vector representation, on which we build a classi-
fier to perform document classification. In the fol-
lowing, we will present how we build the document
level vector progressively from word vectors by us-
ing the hierarchical structure.

Word Encoder Given a sentence with words
wit, t ∈ [0, T ], we first embed the words to vectors
through an embedding matrix We, xij = Wewij .
We use a bidirectional GRU (Bahdanau et al., 2014)
to get annotations of words by summarizing infor-
mation from both directions for words, and therefore
incorporate the contextual information in the anno-
tation. The bidirectional GRU contains the forward
GRU

−→
f which reads the sentence si from wi1 to

wiT and a backward GRU
←−
f which reads from wiT

to wi1:

xit =Wewit, t ∈ [1, T ],
−→
h it =

−−−→
GRU(xit), t ∈ [1, T ],

←−
h it =

←−−−
GRU(xit), t ∈ [T, 1].

We obtain an annotation for a given word wit by
concatenating the forward hidden state

−→
h it and

backward hidden state
←−
h it, i.e., hit = [

−→
h it,
←−
h it],

which summarizes the information of the whole sen-
tence centered around wit.

Note that we directly use word embeddings. For
a more complete model we could use a GRU to get
word vectors directly from characters, similarly to
(Ling et al., 2015). We omitted this for simplicity.

Word Attention Not all words contribute equally
to the representation of the sentence meaning.
Hence, we introduce attention mechanism to extract
such words that are important to the meaning of the
sentence and aggregate the representation of those
informative words to form a sentence vector. Specif-
ically,

uit =tanh(Wwhit + bw) (5)

αit =
exp(u⊤ituw)∑
t exp(u

⊤
ituw)

(6)

si =
∑

t

αithit. (7)

That is, we first feed the word annotation hit through
a one-layer MLP to get uit as a hidden represen-
tation of hit, then we measure the importance of
the word as the similarity of uit with a word level
context vector uw and get a normalized importance
weight αit through a softmax function. After that,
we compute the sentence vector si (we abuse the no-
tation here) as a weighted sum of the word annota-
tions based on the weights. The context vector uw
can be seen as a high level representation of a fixed
query “what is the informative word” over the words
like that used in memory networks (Sukhbaatar et
al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015). The word context
vector uw is randomly initialized and jointly learned
during the training process.

Sentence Encoder Given the sentence vectors si,
we can get a document vector in a similar way. We
use a bidirectional GRU to encode the sentences:

−→
h i =

−−−→
GRU(si), i ∈ [1, L],

←−
h i =

←−−−
GRU(si), t ∈ [L, 1].

We concatenate
−→
h i and

←−
h j to get an annotation of

sentence i, i.e., hi = [
−→
h i,
←−
h i]. hi summarizes the

neighbor sentences around sentence i but still focus
on sentence i.

Sentence Attention To reward sentences that are
clues to correctly classify a document, we again use
attention mechanism and introduce a sentence level
context vector us and use the vector to measure the
importance of the sentences. This yields

ui =tanh(Wshi + bs), (8)

αi =
exp(u⊤i us)∑
i exp(u

⊤
i us)

, (9)

v =
∑

i

αihi, (10)

where v is the document vector that summarizes
all the information of sentences in a document.
Similarly, the sentence level context vector can be
randomly initialized and jointly learned during the
training process.

2.3 Document Classification
The document vector v is a high level representation
of the document and can be used as features for doc-

1482



ument classification:

p = softmax(Wcv + bc). (11)

We use the negative log likelihood of the correct la-
bels as training loss:

L = −
∑

d

log pdj , (12)

where j is the label of document d.

3 Experiments

3.1 Data sets

We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on six
large scale document classification data sets. These
data sets can be categorized into two types of doc-
ument classification tasks: sentiment estimation and
topic classification. The statistics of the data sets are
summarized in Table 1. We use 80% of the data for
training, 10% for validation, and the remaining 10%
for test, unless stated otherwise.

Yelp reviews are obtained from the Yelp Dataset
Challenge in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (Tang et al.,
2015). There are five levels of ratings from 1 to
5 (higher is better).

IMDB reviews are obtained from (Diao et al.,
2014). The ratings range from 1 to 10.

Yahoo answers are obtained from (Zhang et al.,
2015). This is a topic classification task with 10
classes: Society & Culture, Science & Mathe-
matics, Health, Education & Reference, Com-
puters & Internet, Sports, Business & Finance,
Entertainment & Music, Family & Relation-
ships and Politics & Government. The docu-
ment we use includes question titles, question
contexts and best answers. There are 140,000
training samples and 5000 testing samples. The
original data set does not provide validation
samples. We randomly select 10% of the train-
ing samples as validation.

Amazon reviews are obtained from (Zhang et al.,
2015). The ratings are from 1 to 5. 3,000,000
reviews are used for training and 650,000 re-
views for testing. Similarly, we use 10% of the
training samples as validation.

3.2 Baselines
We compare HAN with several baseline meth-
ods, including traditional approaches such as lin-
ear methods, SVMs and paragraph embeddings us-
ing neural networks, LSTMs, word-based CNN,
character-based CNN, and Conv-GRNN, LSTM-
GRNN. These baseline methods and results are re-
ported in (Zhang et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015).

3.2.1 Linear methods
Linear methods (Zhang et al., 2015) use the con-

structed statistics as features. A linear classifier
based on multinomial logistic regression is used to
classify the documents using the features.

BOW and BOW+TFIDF The 50,000 most fre-
quent words from the training set are selected
and the count of each word is used features.
Bow+TFIDF, as implied by the name, uses the
TFIDF of counts as features.

n-grams and n-grams+TFIDF used the most fre-
quent 500,000 n-grams (up to 5-grams).

Bag-of-means The average word2vec embedding
(Mikolov et al., 2013) is used as feature set.

3.2.2 SVMs
SVMs-based methods are reported in (Tang et

al., 2015), including SVM+Unigrams, Bigrams,
Text Features, AverageSG, SSWE. In detail, Uni-
grams and Bigrams uses bag-of-unigrams and bag-
of-bigrams as features respectively.

Text Features are constructed according to (Kir-
itchenko et al., 2014), including word and char-
acter n-grams, sentiment lexicon features etc.

AverageSG constructs 200-dimensional word vec-
tors using word2vec and the average word em-
beddings of each document are used.

SSWE uses sentiment specific word embeddings
according to (Tang et al., 2014).

3.2.3 Neural Network methods
The neural network based methods are reported

in (Tang et al., 2015) and (Zhang et al., 2015).

CNN-word Word based CNN models like that of
(Kim, 2014) are used.

CNN-char Character level CNN models are re-
ported in (Zhang et al., 2015).

Table 1: Data statistics: #s denotes the number of sentences (average and maximum per document), #w denotes the number of
words (average and maximum per document).

LSTM takes the whole document as a single se-
quence and the average of the hidden states of
all words is used as feature for classification.

Conv-GRNN and LSTM-GRNN were proposed
by (Tang et al., 2015). They also explore
the hierarchical structure: a CNN or LSTM
provides a sentence vector, and then a gated
recurrent neural network (GRNN) combines
the sentence vectors from a document level
vector representation for classification.

3.3 Model configuration and training

We split documents into sentences and tokenize each
sentence using Stanford’s CoreNLP (Manning et al.,
2014). We only retain words appearing more than
5 times in building the vocabulary and replace the
words that appear 5 times with a special UNK token.
We obtain the word embedding by training an un-
supervised word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) model
on the training and validation splits and then use the
word embedding to initialize We.

The hyper parameters of the models are tuned
on the validation set. In our experiments, we set
the word embedding dimension to be 200 and the
GRU dimension to be 50. In this case a com-
bination of forward and backward GRU gives us
100 dimensions for word/sentence annotation. The
word/sentence context vectors also have a dimension
of 100, initialized at random.

For training, we use a mini-batch size of 64 and
documents of similar length (in terms of the number
of sentences in the documents) are organized to be a
batch. We find that length-adjustment can accelerate
training by three times. We use stochastic gradient
descent to train all models with momentum of 0.9.
We pick the best learning rate using grid search on
the validation set.

3.4 Results and analysis

The experimental results on all data sets are shown
in Table 2. We refer to our models as HN-{AVE,
MAX, ATT}. Here HN stands for Hierarchical
Network, AVE indicates averaging, MAX indicates
max-pooling, and ATT indicates our proposed hi-
erarchical attention model. Results show that HN-
ATT gives the best performance across all data sets.

The improvement is regardless of data sizes. For
smaller data sets such as Yelp 2013 and IMDB, our
model outperforms the previous best baseline meth-
ods by 3.1% and 4.1% respectively. This finding is
consistent across other larger data sets. Our model
outperforms previous best models by 3.2%, 3.4%,
4.6% and 6.0% on Yelp 2014, Yelp 2015, Yahoo An-
swers and Amazon Reviews. The improvement also
occurs regardless of the type of task: sentiment clas-
sification, which includes Yelp 2013-2014, IMDB,
Amazon Reviews and topic classification for Yahoo
Answers.

From Table 2 we can see that neural network
based methods that do not explore hierarchical doc-
ument structure, such as LSTM, CNN-word, CNN-
char have little advantage over traditional methods
for large scale (in terms of document size) text clas-
sification. E.g. SVM+TextFeatures gives perfor-
mance 59.8, 61.8, 62.4, 40.5 for Yelp 2013, 2014,
2015 and IMDB respectively, while CNN-word has
accuracy 59.7, 61.0, 61.5, 37.6 respectively.

Exploring the hierarchical structure only, as in
HN-AVE, HN-MAX, can significantly improve over
LSTM, CNN-word and CNN-char. For exam-
ple, our HN-AVE outperforms CNN-word by 7.3%,
8.8%, 8.5%, 10.2% than CNN-word on Yelp 2013,
2014, 2015 and IMDB respectively. Our model
HN-ATT that further utilizes attention mechanism

combined with hierarchical structure improves over

in the experiments, HN-AVE is equivalent to us-
ing non-informative global word/sentence context
vectors (e.g., if they are all-zero vectors, then the
attention weights in Eq. 6 and 9 become uniform
weights). Compared to HN-AVE, the HN-ATT
model gives superior performance across the board.
This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed global word and sentence importance vec-
tors for the HAN.

3.5 Context dependent attention weights

If words were inherently important or not important,
models without attention mechanism might work
well since the model could automatically assign low
weights to irrelevant words and vice versa. How-
ever, the importance of words is highly context de-
pendent. For example, the word good may appear
in a review that has the lowest rating either because
users are only happy with part of the product/service
or because they use it in a negation, such as not

good. To verify that our model can capture context
dependent word importance, we plot the distribution
of the attention weights of the words good and bad
from the test split of Yelp 2013 data set as shown in
Figure 3(a) and Figure 4(a). We can see that the dis-
tribution has a attention weight assigned to a word
from 0 to 1. This indicates that our model captures
diverse context and assign context-dependent weight
to the words.

For further illustration, we plot the distribution
when conditioned on the ratings of the review. Sub-
figures 3(b)-(f) in Figure 3 and Figure 4 correspond
to the rating 1-5 respectively. In particular, Fig-
ure 3(b) shows that the weight of good concentrates
on the low end in the reviews with rating 1. As
the rating increases, so does the weight distribution.
This means that the word good plays a more im-
portant role for reviews with higher ratings. We can
observe the converse trend in Figure 4 for the word
bad. This confirms that our model can capture the
context-dependent word importance.

3.6 Visualization of attention

In order to validate that our model is able to select in-
formative sentences and words in a document, we vi-
sualize the hierarchical attention layers in Figures 5
and 6 for several documents from the Yelp 2013 and
Yahoo Answers data sets.

Every line is a sentence (sometimes sentences
spill over several lines due to their length). Red de-
notes the sentence weight and blue denotes the word

weight. Due to the hierarchical structure, we nor-
malize the word weight by the sentence weight to
make sure that only important words in important
sentences are emphasized. For visualization pur-
poses we display

√
pspw. The

√
ps term displays the

important words in unimportant sentences to ensure
that they are not totally invisible.

Figure 5 shows that our model can select the
words carrying strong sentiment like delicious,
amazing, terrible and their corresponding
sentences. Sentences containing many words
like cocktails, pasta, entree are disre-
garded. Note that our model can not only select
words carrying strong sentiment, it can also deal
with complex across-sentence context. For example,
there are sentences like i don’t even like
scallops in the first document of Fig. 5, if look-
ing purely at the single sentence, we may think this
is negative comment. However, our model looks at
the context of this sentence and figures out this is a
positive review and chooses to ignore this sentence.

Our hierarchical attention mechanism also works
well for topic classification in the Yahoo Answer
data set. For example, for the left document
in Figure 6 with label 1, which denotes Science
and Mathematics, our model accurately localizes
the words zebra, strips, camouflage,
predator and their corresponding sentences. For
the right document with label 4, which denotes
Computers and Internet, our model focuses on web,
searches, browsers and their corresponding
sentences. Note that this happens in a multiclass set-
ting, that is, detection happens before the selection
of the topic!

Kim (2014) use neural networks for text classifi-
cation. The architecture is a direct application of
CNNs, as used in computer vision (LeCun et al.,
1998), albeit with NLP interpretations. Johnson and
Zhang (2014) explores the case of directly using
a high-dimensional one hot vector as input. They
find that it performs well. Unlike word level mod-
elings, Zhang et al. (2015) apply a character-level
CNN for text classification and achieve competitive
results. Socher et al. (2013) use recursive neural
networks for text classification. Tai et al. (2015)

explore the structure of a sentence and use a tree-
structured LSTMs for classification. There are also
some works that combine LSTM and CNN struc-
ture to for sentence classification (Lai et al., 2015;
Zhou et al., 2015). Tang et al. (2015) use hierarchi-
cal structure in sentiment classification. They first
use a CNN or LSTM to get a sentence vector and
then a bi-directional gated recurrent neural network
to compose the sentence vectors to get a document
vectors. There are some other works that use hier-
archical structure in sequence generation (Li et al.,
2015) and language modeling (Lin et al., 2015).

The attention mechanism was proposed by (Bah-
danau et al., 2014) in machine translation. The en-
coder decoder framework is used and an attention
mechanism is used to select the reference words in
original language for words in foreign language be-
fore translation. Xu et al. (2015) uses the attention
mechanism in image caption generation to select the
relevant image regions when generating words in the
captions. Further uses of the attention mechanism
include parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014), natural lan-
guage question answering (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015;

Kumar et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2015), and im-
age question answering (Yang et al., 2015). Un-
like these works, we explore a hierarchical attention
mechanism (to the best of our knowledge this is the
first such instance).

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed hierarchical attention net-
works (HAN) for classifying documents. As a con-
venient side-effect we obtained better visualization
using the highly informative components of a doc-
ument. Our model progressively builds a document
vector by aggregating important words into sentence
vectors and then aggregating important sentences
vectors to document vectors. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model performs significantly
better than previous methods. Visualization of these
attention layers illustrates that our model is effective
in picking out important words and sentences.
