Abstract
MedEval is a Swedish medical test collection
where assessments have been made, not only
for topical relevance, but also for target reader
group: Doctors or Patients. The user of the
test collection can choose if s/he wishes to
search in the Doctors or the Patients scenar-
ios where the topical relevance assessments
have been adjusted with consideration to user
group, or to search in a scenario which regards
only topical relevance. MedEval makes it pos-
sible to compare the effectiveness of search
terms when it comes to retrieving documents
aimed at the different user groups. MedEval is
also the first medical Swedish test collection.

1 A New Test Collection

When the decision was made to build a new test col-
lection, the Department of Swedish at the Univer-
sity of Gothenburg was involved in projects of re-
search in medical language processing. There was
also a growing interest of research in information re-
trieval. There existed no Swedish medical test col-
lection. Creating one seemed to be a good invest-
ment in knowledge and resources, even though this
involved a team of people during many months. As
building a test collection is a major undertaking not
many exist. OHSUMED is a medical test collection,
albeit in English. It is built on nearly 350 000 refer-
ences from MEDLINE. The OHSUMED documents
are assessed on a three graded scale: definitely, pos-
sibly and not relevant. OHSUMED contains 106
topics generated by physicians from authentic situa-
tions. The topics consist of both information about
the patient and the request. (OHSUMED, 2007)

With a new collection such as MedEval, the
Swedish department could take control over the ar-
chitecture and make decisions such as using a four
graded scale of relevance, making it possible to em-
ploy a variety of evaluation tools. However, the
most important decision was to assess documents,
not only for relevance to topics, but also for intended
groups of readers, ‘Doctors: medical professionals’
or ‘Patients: lay persons’, and to allow the user to
choose user scenario: None, Doctors or Patients.

2 Documents

The MedEval test collection is built on docu-
ments from the MedLex medical corpus (Kokki-
nakis, 2004). MedLex consists of scientific arti-
cles from medical journals, teaching material, guide-
lines, patient FAQs, health care information, etc.
The set of documents used in MedEval is a snapshot
of MedLex in October 2007, approximately 42 200
documents or 15 million tokens (see table 1). The
documents are stored in the trectext format.

3 Indexes

The MedEval test collection has two indexes. One
where the documents are converted to lower case,
tokenized and lemmatized, and one where the com-
pounds also are decomposed. In the second index,
the compound terms are indexed as a whole together
with the compound constituents. For instance: the
compound saltkoncentration ‘salt concentration’ is
indexed as saltkoncentration, salt, and koncentra-
tion.

4 Topics

Two medical students in their fourth year of studies
were hired to create the topics. Their instructions
were to create information needs that could be re-
quested in real medical situations. 100 topics were
created in the first stage. 62 of these were used in
the collection.

A topic consists of a title, a description and a nar-
rative. The title is a short phrase summarizing the in-
formation need. The description is concise informa-
tion about the topic, usually in the form of a question
or a request. The narrative is a few sentences long
and it stipulates what makes a document relevant to
the topic. The narrative contains the guidelines for
the assessors when judging the relevance of the doc-
uments in the next stage. An example of a topic is
given below. The English equivalent of the descrip-
tion of topic 51 is: Why can a patient with cancer
contract anemia?

5 Selecting Documents to Assess

In the ideal test collection every document would be
assessed for relevance with respect to every topic.
But with over 42 000 documents and 62 topics, tak-
ing 8 minutes to assess each document, it would take
four persons more than 40 years working 40 hours
per week to finish the assessments.

Instead, only the documents that were considered
most likely to be relevant to each topic were as-
sessed. The documents were filtered out by use of
four queries, one specific and one exhaustive for
each index. The documents selected for each topic
were sorted by document ID and duplicates were re-
moved. This was done so that the assessors would
not know how high a document had been ranked,
or in how many searches it had been retrieved. For
each topic and each of the four queries the 100 high-
est ranked documents were selected, if, in fact, there
were that many.

6 Relevance Judgments

For the relevance judgments four new medical stu-
dents were consulted. For each of 62 topics, an as-
sessor read through the documents to be assessed
and decided, for each document, the intended group
of readers and the degree of relevance to the topic.
The documents for each individual need were as-
sessed by one and the same assessor for reasons of
consistency.

The MedEval relevance assessments were made
on a four graded scale, 0-3, where 0 is ‘Not at all
relevant’ and 3 is ‘Highly relevant’. The scale is
easily turned into a binary scale by stating that the
documents with the lower grades are to be consid-

2



ered non-relevant and the ones with higher grades
relevant. Where the division is made between rel-
evant and non-relevant depends on the needs of the
user in each case.

The relevance considered by the assessors was
topical relevance, how well a document corresponds
to a topic. The assessors were instructed not to in-
volve user relevance in this score. Each document
was judged on its own merits. The novelty of the
contents of a document should not be considered.

7 Target Groups

In addition to topical relevance the assessors judged
each document for reader target group, that is which
group of readers was the intended: Patients, if a doc-
ument was written for lay persons, or Doctors, if it
was written for medical professionals.

For a classification of documents according to
intended reader group to be useful, there must be
a measureable difference between the document
classes. Table 2 shows a number of type/token fre-
quencies in different subsets of the collection. In
each set duplicates were removed in the case that
a document had been assessed for more than one
topic. The subsets considered are described below.
Full form types are the original terms of the doc-
uments before lemmatization and lemma types are
the same terms after lemmatization.

Entire collection All documents of the MedEval
collection.

Assessed documents All documents that have been
assessed for any topic.

Doctors assessed All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have target
group Doctors.

Patients assessed All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have target
group Patients.

Common files All documents that for at least one
topic have been assessed to have target group
Doctors and for another to have target group
Patients.

Doctors relevant All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have at least

relevance grade 1 and to have target group Doc-
tors.

Patients relevant All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have at least
relevance grade 1 and to have target group Pa-
tients.

Before counting frequencies, the files were
cleaned from tags, IDs, dates (in the date tag, not
in the actual text), web information and punctua-
tion marks. Some observations are readily made by
studying table 2.

The number of tokens per document is signifi-
cantly smaller for the entire collection, than for any
subset. This means that there is a large number
of short documents that were not retrieved by any
query when the documents to be assessed were se-
lected. Maybe not surprising, since short documents
contain few terms which can match the queries.

The documents in the set ‘Patients assessed’ had
only 57% the number of tokens per document, com-
pared to the documents in ‘Doctors assessed’. Even
though there were over 1 000 more documents in
‘Patients assessed’ than in ‘Doctors assessed’, there
were over 50 000 more lemma types in the doctor
documents and almost 30 000 more lemma com-
pound types. The average word length in ‘Doctors
assessed’ was 6.29 compared to 5.73 for ‘Patients
assessed’. The ratio of compound tokens was also
higher in the doctor documents, 0.128 compared to
0.098.

Table 3 illustrates the fact that the doctor docu-
ments contain more and longer terms and more com-
pounds than patient documents. This table shows
frequencies of all full form types of strings be-
ginning with förmak ‘atria’ in ‘Patients assessed’
and ‘Doctors assessed’ respectively. The patient
documents have 18 full form types beginning with
förmak while doctor documents have 75. That is
more than four times more types for the doctor doc-
uments.

A closer look at the frequencies of förmak∗ in the
professional and lay person texts reveals that not all
frequencies are higher for professionals. The fre-
quencies of nouns in the definite form in the lay per-
son texts are close to, equal or higher than the same
forms in the professional texts.

Table 2: Type and token frequencies of the terms in different subsets of the MedEval test collection.

Looking at all instances of strings beginning with
förmak∗ in the two sets of documents there is a sig-
nificant difference. In the patient documents 66 to-
kens of 372, or 17.7%, are nouns in the definite
form, while the corresponding numbers for the doc-
tor documents is 89 of 932 tokens, or 9.6%. At this
stage one can only speculate why this is so. A hy-
pothesis is that doctors/medical professionals often
discuss matters in a generic point of view, while pa-
tients/lay persons discuss specific cases.

8 User Groups

The MedEval test collection allows the user to state
user group: None (no specified group), Doctors or
Patients. This choice directs the user to one of three
scenarios. The None scenario contains the topical
relevance grades as made by the assessors. The Doc-
tors scenario contains the same grades with the ex-
ception that the grades of the documents marked for
Patients target group are downgraded by one. In
the same way the Patients scenario has the docu-

ments marked for Doctors target group downgraded
by one. This means that for a doctor user patient
documents originally given relevance 3, are graded
with 2, documents given relevance 2 are graded 1
and documents given relevance 1 are graded 0. The
same is done in the Patients scenario with the doc-
tor documents. The idea is that a document that is
written for a reader from one target group but re-
trieved for a user from the other group will not be
non-relevant, but less useful than a document from
the correct target group. Put differently, a docu-
ment intended for patients would contain informa-
tion that doctors (hopefully) already know. On the
other hand, documents intended for doctors, even
though they might be topically relevant for a pa-
tient’s need, run a great risk of being written in such
a way that a patient will have problems grasping the
whole content.

Adjusting relevance in the manner described af-
fects the scenario recall bases. Since relevance
grades are downgraded for documents of the oppos-
ing target group there will be fewer relevant docu-
ments in the Doctors and Patients scenarios than in
the None scenario. This is demonstrated in figure 1
where the ideal cumulated gain for the three scenar-
ios of topics 28, 36 and 92 are shown. The ideal cu-
mulated gain is the maximum score of retrieved in-
formation possible at each position in a ranked list of
documents (Järvelin, Kekäläinen, 2002). The score
for each position is the sum of all relevance scores
so far in the ranked list.

The three topics of figure 1 show different char-
acteristics with reference to the number of relevant

sessed to have target group Doctors. Topic 36 had the rel-
evant documents spread fairly evenly between the Doc-
tors and Patients target groups. Topic 92 showed no doc-
uments of any relevance grade for documents marked for
target group Doctors. Thus the None and the Patients
ideal gain vector coincide fully, while the cumulated gain
for the Doctors scenario is very low.

doctor and patient documents. Topic 36 has fairly
similar cumulated gain curves for the Doctors and
Patients scenarios. Topic 28 has a majority of doc-
tor documents, while topic 92 had no documents of
any relevance grade for documents marked for tar-
get group Doctors. Thus the None and the Patients
ideal gain vector coincide fully, while the cumulated
gain for the Doctors scenario is very low, originating
from downgraded patient documents.

9 Example Runs

To demonstrate the effectiveness of search terms
from the different styles of language of the two tar-
get groups, the synonyms anemi ‘anemia’ and blod-
brist ‘blood lack’ were run as search keys for topic
51 in the Doctors and Patients scenarios. anemi is a
neoclassical term, belonging to the professional lan-
guage and blodbrist is the corresponding lay person
term.

In the Doctors scenario the difference between
the results of the two search keys was striking: full
recall for the neoclassical term quite early in the
ranked list of documents and no recall at all for the
lay person term. The Patients scenario did not show
as big difference between the search keys. Note that
the resulting ranked lists of documents is the same
for both scenarios for the same search key. It is the
relevance grades of the retrieved documents that dif-
fer.

Scenario Recall anemi blodbrist
Doctors @10 50% (4/8) 0% (0/8)

@20 100% (8/8) 0% (0/8)
@100 100% (8/8) 0% (0/8)

Patients @10 22% (4/18) 33% (6/18)
@20 39% (7/18) 39% (7/18)
@100 66% (12/18) 56% (10/18)

Table 5: Running the synonyms anemi ‘anemia’ and
blodbrist ‘blood lack’ as search keys for topic 51 in the
Doctors scenario gave full recall early in the ranking list
for the neoclassical term anemi, but no recall at all for
the lay person term blodbrist. In the Patients scenario the
difference in effectiveness for these search keys was not
as striking.

10 Final Words

This paper shows a few aspects of medical informa-
tion retrieval which can be studied with the use of
the MedEval test collection. The main novelty of the
collection is the marking of document target groups,
Doctors and Patients, together with with the possi-
bility to choose user group. This opens up new areas
of research in Swedish information retrieval such as
how one can retrieve documents suited for different
groups of users.

The Department of Swedish at the University of
Gothenburg is in the process of making the MedEval
test collection available to academic researchers.
