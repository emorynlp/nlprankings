Abstract 

With the advent of e-learning, there is a 
strong demand for tools that help to cre-
ate e-learning courses in an automatic or 
semi-automatic way. While resources for 
new courses are often freely available, 
they are generally not properly structured 
into easy to handle units. In this paper, 
we investigate how state of the art text 
segmentation algorithms can be applied 
to automatically transform unstructured 
text into coherent pieces appropriate for  
e-learning courses. The feasibility to 
course generation is validated on a test 
corpus specifically tailored to this scenar-
io. We also introduce a more generic 
training and testing method for text seg-
mentation algorithms based on a Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. 
In addition we introduce a scalable ran-
dom text segmentation algorithm, in or-
der to establish lower and upper bounds 
to be able to evaluate segmentation re-
sults on a common basis. 

1 Introduction 

The creation of e-learning courses is generally a 
time consuming effort. However, separating text 
into topically cohesive segments can help to re-
duce this effort whenever textual content is al-
ready available but not properly structured ac-
cording to e-learning standards. Since these seg-

ments textually describe the content of learning 
units, automatic pedagogical annotation algo-
rithms could be applied to categorize them into 
introductions, descriptions, explanations, exam-
ples and other pedagogical meaningful concepts 
(K.Sathiyamurthy & T.V.Geetha, 2011).   

Course designers generally assume that learn-
ing content is composed of small inseparable 
learning objects at the micro level which in turn 
are wrapped into Concept Containers (CCs) at 
the macro level. This approach is followed, e.g., 
in the Web-Didactic approach by Swertz et al. 
(2013) where CCs correspond to chapters in a 
book and Knowledge Objects (KOs) correspond 
to course pages. To automate the partition of an 
unstructured text source into appropriate seg-
ments for the macro and micro level we applied 
different text segmentation algorithms (segment-
ers) on each level.  

To evaluate the segmenters in the described 
scenario, we created a test corpus based on fea-
tured Wikipedia articles. For the macro level we 
exploit sections from different articles and the 
corresponding micro structure consists of subse-
quent paragraphs from these sections. On the 
macro level the segmenter TopicTiling (TT) by 
Riedl and Biemann (2012) is used. It is based on 
a LDA topic model which we train based on the 
articles from Wikipedia to extract a predefined 
number of different topics. On the micro level, 
the segmenter BayesSeg (BS) is applied 
(Eisenstein & Barzilay, 2008). 

We achieved overall good results measured in 
three different metrics over a baseline approach, 
i.e., a scalable random segmenter, that indicate

text segmentation algorithms are ready to be ap-
plied to facilitate the creation of e-learning 
courses. 

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
gives an overview of related work on automatic 
course generation as well as text segmentation 
applications. In the main sections 3 and 4 we de-
scribe our approach and evaluation results on our 
corpus. In the last section we summarize the pre-
sented findings and give an outlook on further 
research needed for the automatic generation of 
e-learning courses. 

2 Related Work 

Automatic course generation can roughly be di-
vided into two different areas. One is concerned 
with generation from existing courses and is 
mainly focused on adaption to the learner or in-
structional plans see Lin et al. (2009), Capuno et 
al. (2009) and Tan et al. (2010). The other area is 
the course creation itself on which we focus on 
in this paper.  

Since the publication of the segmenter Text-
Tiling by Hearst (1997) at least a dozen different 
segmenters have been developed. They can be 
divided into linear and hierarchical segmenters. 
Linear segmenters process the text sequentially 
sentence by sentence. Hierarchical segmenters 
first process the whole text and extract topics 
with varying granularities. These topics are then 
agglomerated based on a predefined criterion.  

Linear segmenters have been developed by 
Kan et al. (1998) and Galley et al. (2003). One of 
the first probabilistic algorithms has been intro-
duced by Utiyama and Isahara (2001). LDA 
based approaches were first described by Sun et 
al. (2008) and improved by Misra et al. (2009). 
The newest LDA based segmenter is TT. It per-
forms linear text segmentation based on a pre-
trained LDA topic model and calculates the simi-
larity between segments (adjacent sentences) to 
measure text coherence on the basis of a topic 
vector representation using cosine similarity. For 
reasons of efficiency, only the most frequent top-
ic ID is assigned to each word in the sentence, 
using Gibbs sampling. 

Hierarchical text segmentation algorithms 
were first introduced by Yaari (1997). The latest 
approach by Eisenstein (2008) uses a generative 
Bayesian model BS for text segmentation, as-
suming that a) topic shifts are likely to occur at 
points marked by cue phrases and b) a linear dis-
course structure. Each sentence in the document 
is modeled by a language model associated with 

a segment. The algorithm then calculates the 
maximum likelihood estimates of observing the 
whole sequence of sentences at selected topic 
boundaries.  

The applications of text segmentation algo-
rithms range from information retrieval (Huang, 
et al., 2002) to topic tracking and segmentation 
of multi-party conversations (Galley, et al., 
2003). 

Similar to our work Sathiyamurthy and Geetha 
(2011) showed how LDA based text segmenta-
tion algorithms combined with hierarchical do-
main ontology and pedagogical ontology can be 
applied to content generation for e-learning 
courses. They focussed on the segmentation of 
existing e-learning material in the domain of 
computer science and introduced new metrics to 
measure the segmentation results with respect to 
concepts from the ontologies. Our work focusses 
on the appropriate segmentation of unstructured 
text instead of existing e-learning material. Alt-
hough the usage of domain models is an interest-
ing approach the availability of such models is 
very domain dependent. We rely on the LDA 
model parameters and training to accomplish a 
word to topic assignment.  

Rather than introducing new aspects such as 
pedagogical concepts we investigated the general 
usability of segmentation algorithms with focus 
on the macro and micro structure which is char-
acteristic for most e-learning content. 

3 Automatic Generation of E-Learning 
Courses 

The main objective is to provide e-learning 
course designers with a tool to efficiently organ-
ize existing textual content for new e-learning 
courses. This can be done by the application of 
text segmenters that automatically generate the 
basic structure of the course. The intended web-
didactic conform two-level structure differenti-
ates between macro and micro levels. The levels 
have different requirements with respect to the-
matic coherence: the CCs are thematically rather 
independent and the KOs within each CC need to 
be intrinsically coherent but still separable.  

We chose the linear LDA-based segmenter TT 
to find the boundaries between CCs. The LDA-
based topic model can be trained on content 
which is topically related to the target course. 
This approach gives the course creator flexibility 
in the generation of the macro level structure by 
either adjusting the training documents or by 

133



changing the number and size of topics that 
should be extracted for the topic model. 

On the micro level we did not use TT. The 
training of an appropriate LDA model would 
have to be done for every CC separately since 
they are thematically relatively unrelated. Apart 
from that the boundaries between the KOs 
should be an optimal division for a given number 
of expected boundaries. The reason for this is 
that the length of KOs should be adapted to the 
intended skill and background of the learners. 
This is why we decided to use the hierarchical 
segmenter BS.    

3.1 Application Setting and Corpus 

To evaluate segmenters many different corpora 
have been created. The most commonly used 
corpus was introduced by Choi (2000). It is 
based on the Brown Corpus and contains 700 
samples, each containing a fixed number of sen-
tences from 10 different news texts, which are 
randomly chosen from the Brown Corpus. Two 
other widely tested corpora were introduced by 
Galley et al. (2003). Both contain 500 samples, 
one with concatenated texts from the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ) and the other with concatenated 
texts from the Topic Detection and Tracking 
(TDT) corpus (Strassel, et al., 2000). A standard 
for the segmentation of speech is the corpus from 
the International Computer Science Institute 
(ICSI) by Janin et al. (2003). A medical text 
book has been used by Eisenstein and Barzilay 
(2008). The approaches to evaluate segmenters 
are always similar: they have to find the bounda-
ries in artificially concatenated texts. 

We developed our own dataset because we 
wanted to use text that potentially could be used 
as a basis for creating e-learning courses. We 
therefore need samples which, on the one hand, 
have relatively clear topic boundaries on the 
macro level and, on the other hand resemble the 
differences in number of topics and inter-topic 
cohesion on the micro level. 

We based our corpus on 530 featured1 articles 
from 6 different categories of the English Wik-
ipedia. It can be assumed that Wikipedia articles 
are often the source for learning courses. We 
used featured articles because the content struc-
ture is very consistent and clear, i.e., sections and 
paragraphs are well defined.  

The corpus is divided into a macro and micro 
dataset in the following manner: The macro da-

                                                 
1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_arti
cles 

taset contains 1200 samples. Each sample is a 
concatenation of paragraphs from 6-8 different 
sections from featured articles. Each topic in a 
sample consists of 3-6 subsequent paragraphs 
from a randomly selected section. We propose 
that one paragraph describes one KO. One CC 
contains all KOs which are from the same sec-
tion in the article. Thus, one sample from the 
macro dataset contains 6-8 CCs, each containing 
3-6 KOs. The segmentation task is to find the 
topic boundaries between the CCs. The macro 
dataset is quite similar in structure to the Choi-
Corpus. 

The micro dataset is extracted from the macro 
dataset. It contains 8231 samples, where each 
sample contains all KOs from one CC of the 
macro dataset. The segmentation task is to find 
the topic boundaries between the KOs, i.e, sub-
sequent paragraphs of one section, see Figure 1. 

 

 
 

Figure 1: Schema for corpus samples: left and 
right Wikipedia articles with sections and para-
graphs, in the middle three samples, dashed rec-
tangle is a macro sample and dashed circles are 

micro samples. Filled squares indicate topic 
boundaries in the macro sample and filled circles 

in the micro samples. 
 

All texts in our corpus are stemmed and stop-
words are removed with the NLP-Toolkit for 
Python (Bird, et al., 2009) using an adapted vari-
ant2 of the keyword extraction method by Kim et 
al. (2013).  

The macro and micro dataset themselves are 
divided into multiple subsets to evaluate the sta-
bility of the segmenters when the number of sen-
tences per topic or the number of topics per sam-
ple have changed. The detailed configuration is 
shown in Table 1 and 2. Each subset is identified 
by the number of CCs per sample and the num-
ber of KOs per CC (the subset is denoted as 
#CC_#KO). Subsets of the micro dataset are 
identified by a single value which is the number

of KOs per sample (#KO). In Table 1 the identi-
fier R means that the number of CCs or KOs is 
not the same for all samples, it is chosen random-
ly from the set depicted by curly brackets.

Table 2: Micro dataset and its subsets. 

 
The important difference between the macro and 
micro dataset is that every subset of the macro 
dataset contains a constant number of topics 
which differ in number of sentences per topic 
between 20 and 40, except the subset R_R which 
contains a random number of topics between 6 
and 8. In contrast, each micro-level subset differs 
in number of topics but not significantly in the 
number of sentences per topic.  

This difference between the datasets allows us 
to focus on the different level-specific aspects. 
On the macro dataset we can evaluate the stabil-
ity of TT over topics with highly varying lengths 
and on the micro dataset we can evaluate BS 
when the number of strongly coherent topics 
changes. 

3.2 Text Segmentation Metrics  

The performance of a segmenter cannot simply 
be measured by false positive and false negative 
boundaries compared to the true boundaries be-
cause, if the predicted boundary is only one sen-
tence away from the true boundary this could 
still be very close, e.g., if the next true topic 
boundary is 30 sentences away. Thus, the rela-
tive proximity to true boundaries should also be 

considered. There is an ongoing discussion about 
what kind of metric is appropriate to measure the 
performance of segmenters (Fournier & Inkpen, 
2012). Most prominent and widely used are 
WindowDiff wd (Pevzner & Hearst, 2002) and 
the probabilistic metric pk (Beeferman, et al., 
1999). The basic principle is to slide a window of 
fixed size over the segmented text, i.e., fixed 
number of words or sentences, and assess wheth-
er the sentences on the edges are correctly seg-
mented with respect to each other. Both metrics 
wd and pk are penalty metrics, therefore lower 
values indicate better segmentations. The prob-
lem with these metrics is that they strongly de-
pend on the arbitrarily defined window size pa-
rameter and do not penalize all error types equal-
ly, e.g., pk penalizes false negatives more than 
false positives and wd penalizes false positive 
and negative boundaries more at the beginning 
and end of the text (Lamprier, et al., 2007). Be-
cause of that we also used a rather new metric 
called BoundarySimilarity b. This metric is pa-
rameter independent and has been developed by 
Fournier and Inkpen (2013) to solve the men-
tioned deficiencies. Since b measures the similar-
ity between the boundaries, higher values indi-
cate better segmentations. We used the imple-
mentations of wd, pk and b by Fournier3 (wd and 
pk with default parameters). 

3.3 LDA Topic Model Training 

Riedl and Biemann evaluated TT on the Choi-
Corpus based on a 10-fold cross validation. 
Thus, the LDA topic model was generated with 
90% of the samples and TT then tested on the 
remaining 10% of the samples. The 700 samples 
in the Choi-Corpus are only concatenations of 
1111 different excerpts from the Brown Corpus 
and each sample contains 10 of these excepts it is 
clear that there are just not enough excerpts to 
make sure that the samples in the training set do 
not contain any excerpt that is also part of some 
samples in the testing set. 

That is one reason why we do not use the 
same approach since we want to make sure that 
training and testing sets are truly disjoint to eval-
uate TT on the macro dataset. The other reason is 
that the topic structure generated by TT should 
be based on an LDA topic model with topics ex-
tracted from documents which are thematically 
related to certain parts of the course that is to be 
created without using its text source.

We train the LDA topic model to extract top-
ics from the real Wikipedia articles. This model 
is then used to evaluate TT on the macro dataset 
and not the Wikipedia articles. This approach has 
consequences for the LDA topic model training 
and respective TT testing sets, since the LDA 
training set contains real articles and the TT test 
set contains the samples from the macro dataset. 
Because training and testing set should truly be 
disjoint we cannot train with any article that is 
part of a sample from the test set. Because each 
test sample from the macro dataset contains parts 
of 6 to 8 articles, the training set is reduced by a 
large factor, even with little test set size, which is 
shown for different number of folds (k) for cross 
validation in Table 3.

Table 3: Mean size and standard deviation of

If we truly separate training and testing sets and 
train the LDA topic model with real articles a 10-
fold cross validation  leads to very small training 
sets (only 26% of all articles are used), which is 
why we also used higher folds to evaluate the 
results of TT on the macro dataset. 

4 Evaluation Results 

We evaluated TT on the macro dataset without 
providing the number of boundaries. On the mi-
cro dataset we evaluated BS with the expected 
number of boundaries provided. We also imple-
mented a scalable random segmenter (RS) to 
compare TT and BS against some algorithm with 
interpretable performance. The interpretation of 
the values in any metric even with respect to dif-
ferent metrics is very difficult without compari-
son to another segmenter. For every true bounda-
ry in a document, RS predicts a boundary drawn 

from a normally distributed set around the true 
boundary with scalable standard deviation σ. 
Thus smaller values for σ result in better seg-
mentations because the probability of selecting 
the true boundary increases, e.g., for σ = 2, more 
than 68% of all predicted boundaries are at most 
2 sentences away from the true boundary and 
more than 99% of all predicted boundaries are 
located within a range of 6 sentences from it. But 
whether 6 sentences is a large or small distance 
should depend on the average topic size. We 
therefore relate the performance of RS to the 
mean number of sentence per topic by defining σ 
in percentages of that number as shown in the 
table below. 
 

Distance from True 
Boundary: 

Standard Deviation 

very close σ = 0% - 5% 
close σ = 5% -15% 
large σ = 15% - 30% 

 
Table 4: Defined performance of RS for different 

standard deviations σ, given in percentage of 
mean sentences per topic. 

 
To give an example, the subset 7_6 of the macro 
dataset has an average of 40 sentences per topic, 
therefore RS with σ=15% means that it is set to 6 
which is 15% of 40. This is defined as a medium 
performance in Table 4 because 68% of the 
boundaries predicted are within a range of 6 sen-
tences from the true boundaries and 99% within 
18 sentences.  

One important difference between the macro 
and micro dataset is that all subsets of the macro 
dataset have 7 topics, differing in length, except 
for subset R_R where this number is only slightly 
varied (Table 1). In contrast, all topics subsets of 
the micro dataset have roughly the same number 
of sentences but highly differ in the number of 
topics (Table 2). We therefore do not compare 
the performance of BS and TT since they are 
evaluated on quite different datasets designed for 
testing different types of segmentation tasks rel-
evant to course generation, as explained earlier. 
We compare both to RS for different standard 
deviations σ. 

4.1 Results for TopicTiling on the Macro 
Dataset 

For the LDA topic model training we used the 
following default parameters:  alpha=0.5, 
beta=0.1,ntopics=100,niters=1000, 

136



twords=20,savestep=100, for details we 
refer to (Griffiths & Steyvers, 2004). To compare 
TT’s performance for different folds of the mac-
ro dataset we optimized the window parameter 
which has to be set for TT, it specifies the num-
ber of sentences to the left and to the right of the 
current position p between two sentences that are 
used to calculate the coherence score between 
these sentences (Riedl & Biemann, 2012). The 
performance for TT has been best with window 
sizes between 9 and 11 for all metrics as shown 
in Figure 2. As expected, higher folds increase 
TT’s overall performance especially with respect 
to metric b (Figure 3). This is due to the larger 
training set sizes of the LDA topic model. 
 

 
Figure 2: TT performance for different window 

sizes with 30-fold cross validation. 
 

 
Figure 3: TT performance for different folds and 

window size set to 9. 
 
In general smaller window sizes increase the 
number of predicted boundaries. The optimal 
window size is between 9 and 11 and we would 
expect the measures for 5 and 15 to be similar 

(Figure 2). This is only the case for metric b, the 
metrics wd and pk seem to penalize false posi-
tives more than false negatives. This would be a 
contradiction to the findings of Lamprier et al. 
(2007) since they actually found the opposite to 
be true. This behaviour is explained by the non-
linear relation between the window parameter 
and number of predicted boundaries by TT as 
shown in Figure 4. 

 
Figure 4: Mean number of predicted boundaries 
by TT for different window sizes and an LDA 

topic model trained with 30 folds. 
 

Another important finding is the stability of TT’s 
performance over different window sizes (from 9 
to 11). This is important since a very sensitive 
behaviour would be very difficult to handle for 
course creators because they would have to esti-
mate this parameter in advance. 

For the following detailed evaluation TT win-
dow size is set to 9 because of the best overall 
results with respect to metric b and 30-fold cross 
validation. The detailed performance with re-
spect to metric wd, pk and b of TT compared to 
RS with different standard deviations σ is shown 
in Figure 5 i), ii) and iii).

Figure 5: Performance of TT on the macro da-

taset. 
 

First of all we want to point out that the graphs 
of RS for different values of σ are ordered as ex-
pected by all metrics. Lower percentages indicate 
better results. And with respect to metric wd and 
pk the performance for each σ is nearly constant 
over all subsets, which indicates that the metrics 
correctly consider the relative distance of a pre-
dicted boundary from the true boundary by using 
the mean number of sentences per topic. In met-
ric b only the RS with σ=30%, 15% and 5% are 
constant. For σ=5% there is a strong decrease in 
performance for subsets with more sentences per 
topic. 

The overall performance of TT is between that 
of RS for σ=1% and σ=15%, except for subset 
7_6 with respect to metric wd. With respect to 
metric b TT even predicts very close boundaries. 
In all metrics TT has the worst results on subset 
7_6, which has the largest number of sentences 
per topic (see Table 1). This is due to TT’s win-
dow parameter which influences the number of 
predicted boundaries as shown in Figure 4. 

4.2 Results for BayesSeg on the Micro Da-

BS does not need any training or parameter fit-
ting, since it is provided with the number of ex-
pected segments. We therefore used the default 
parameter settings.

number of topics leads to slightly increasing 
penalties for constant values of σ, which clearly 
indicates that the metrics do not treat all errors 
equally, as repeatedly pointed out. Metric b treats 
errors equally over increasing number of topics 
for RS. BS predicts with respect to all metrics 
close boundaries since it is better than RS with 
σ=15% except on subset 6 (Table 4). With an 
increasing number of topics BS is getting worse 
in all metrics.  

Comparing the measures of metric b for macro 
and micro dataset it seems that it handles increas-
ing numbers of topics better than increasing size 
of topics. On the micro dataset the results with 
respect to all metrics are far more similar than 
the once on the macro dataset, where the differ-
ences are very large. Since we are only interested 
in comparative measures of the performance of 
the segmenters and RS, which has shown to be a 
very useful approach to interpret segmentation 
results, we leave detailed explanations of the 
metrics behaviours itself to further research. 

5 Conclusion 

We demonstrated that text segmentation algo-
rithms can be applied to the generation of e-
learning courses. We use a web-didactic ap-
proach that is based on a flat two-level hierar-
chical structure. A new corpus has been com-
piled based on featured articles from the English 
Wikipedia that reflects this kind of course struc-
ture. On the broader macro level we applied the 
linear LDA-based text segmentation algorithm 
TopicTiling without providing the expected 
number of boundaries. The LDA topic model is 
usually trained with concatenated texts from the 
very same dataset TopicTiling is tested on. We 
showed that it is very difficult to ensure that the 
two sets are always truly disjoint. The reason is 
that concatenated texts normally always have 
identical parts. This problem is solved by apply-
ing a different training and testing method. 

The more fine grained micro level was seg-
mented using BayesSeg, a hierarchical algorithm 
which we provided with the expected number of 
boundaries. 

We used three different evaluation metrics and 
presented a scalable random segmentation algo-
rithm to establish upper and lower bounds for 
baseline comparison. The results, especially on 
the macro level, demonstrate that text segmenta-
tion algorithms have evolved enough to be used 
for the automatic generation of e-learning cours-
es. 

An interesting aspect of future research would 
be the application and creation of real e-learning 
content. Based on the textual segments, summa-
rization and question generation algorithms as 
well as automatic replacement with appropriate 
pictures and videos instead of text could be used 
to finally evaluate an automatically generated e-
learning course with real learners.  

Regarding text segmentation in general, future 
research especially needs to address the difficult 
task of transparently and equally measuring the 
performance of segmentation algorithms. Our 
results, i.e., the ones from the random segmenta-
tion algorithm, indicate that there are still un-
solved issues regarding the penalization of false 
positives and false negatives when the number of 
topics or sentences per topic is changed.
