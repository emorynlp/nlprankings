Abstract

The new frontier of computer assisted transla-
tion technology is the effective integration of
statistical MT within the translation workflow.
In this respect, the SMT ability of incremen-
tally learning from the translations produced
by users plays a central role. A still open
problem is the evaluation of SMT systems that
evolve over time. In this paper, we propose
a new metric for assessing the quality of an
adaptive MT component that is derived from
the theory of learning curves: the percentage
slope.

1 Introduction

Translation memories and computer assisted trans-
lation (CAT) tools are currently the dominant tech-
nologies in the translation and localization market,
but recent achievements in statistical MT have raised
new expectations in the translation industry. So far,
statistical MT has focused on providing ready-to-use
translations, rather than outputs that minimize the
effort of a human translator. The MateCAT project1

aims at pushing what can be considered the new
frontier of CAT technology: how to effectively inte-
grate statistical MT within the translation workflow.

One pursued research direction is developing do-
main adaptive SMT models, i.e. models that dynam-
ically adapt to the translations that are continuously
added to the translation memory by the user dur-
ing her/his work. The ideal goal is to progressively
reduce the mismatch between training and testing

data, in such a way that the adapted SMT engine will
be able to provide the user with useful suggestions
– i.e. perfect or worth being post-edited – when the
translation memory fails to retrieve perfect or almost
perfect matches. Among the well known machine
learning paradigms that fit with this scenario are on-
line learning and incremental learning, which basi-
cally differ in the amount of data that is employed
to dynamically adapt the system: a single piece of
data in the first case and a batch of data in the lat-
ter. Notice that in both cases one assumes that do-
main adaptation is performed efficiently, i.e. by only
processing the newly received data. Moreover, al-
though the quantity of acquired in-domain data is
generally limited, their high quality and relevance to
the translation task justify their exploitation by all
means possible.

Domain adaptive SMT embeds two challenges:
(1) the design of effective adaptation algorithms, and
(2) the evaluation of MT systems evolving over time.
Since the ultimate goal of our efforts is to increase
the productivity of human translators, the most ac-
curate assessment methodology would be of course
to run a field test. This way, we could compare pro-
ductivity of human translators receiving suggestions
from an MT engine featuring dynamic domain adap-
tation against the productivity of human translators
working with a static MT engine. As this evaluation
is infeasible during daily MT development, we can
resort to the several automatic MT metrics, which
however, as we will see later, are unsuitable to track
the dynamic behaviors we are interested to inves-
tigate. Metrics for measuring performance in the
case of interactive MT, see for example (Khadivi,

433



2008), like Key-Stroke Ratio (KSR), Mouse-Action
Ratio (MAR), Key-Stroke and Mouse-Action Ratio
(KSMR) are known to correlate well with the pro-
ductivity of human translators, but their computation
requires the actual use of an interactive MT system,
i.e. a field test.

In the SMART project,2 the evaluation of adap-
tive interactive MT is explored (Cesa-Bianchi et al.,
2008). While no specific metric is proposed, the
analysis is based on a plot of cumulative differences
of BLEU scores between a baseline and an adaptive
system. These differences are computed sentence by
sentence and present an interesting view of the dy-
namic change of the MT system. We are going to
further elaborate on this idea.

Other metrics like Character Error Rate (CER)
and Translation Edit Rate (TER) would accurately
predict the translators’ productivity if references
were generated by using the CAT system; on the
contrary, references are usually, as in this paper, gen-
erated from scratch based only on the source text
and can thus be quite far from CAT-based transla-
tions, both lexically and syntactically. The Human-
targeted variant of TER, HTER (Snover et al., 2006),
needs human intervention and is therefore unfit to
meet our requirements.

The main goal of this paper is to design an objec-
tive automatic evaluation methodology for an MT
system adapting over time. We propose to use the
percentage slope from the theory on learning curves
to measure the learning ability of adaptive MT sys-
tems.

To assess the proposed metric, we have imple-
mented a simple but effective adaptation strategy
suitable for an MT system integrated in a CAT tool.
We show that the percentage slope is able to expose
different dynamic behaviors, such as learning, no
learning, and forgetting.

2 Dynamic Adaptation Framework

In the MateCAT project scenario, the MT system,
which is embedded in the CAT tool to increase the
translators’ productivity, adapts over time by ex-
ploiting translations generated by the user. The
adapted system is then used to provide the user
with translation suggestions for the next sentences.

2http://www.smart-project.eu

We refer to this process as dynamic (or incremen-
tal) adaptation to emphasize that adaptation hap-
pens continuously based on a stream of data.

2.1 Abstract View of the Adaptation Process

From an abstract point of view, the framework of in-
cremental adaptation can be summarized as follows:

i) before the process starts, an initial system is
built on available data including a parallel cor-
pus;

ii) a stream of parallel data becomes available that
is split into blocks of (not necessarily) similar
size;

iii) the first/next block is considered, but only the
source is available yet;

iv) the latest instance of the adapting system trans-
lates the source text of the current block;

v) the target part of the current block becomes
available for use;3

vi) the system is adapted using the current parallel
block and possibly all the previous ones;

vii) the loop continues from step iii) until all blocks
are processed.

In each adaptation step, all of the data available
so far can be used, but no look ahead is possible.
Note that, in principle, each block is translated with
a different instance of the adapting system; hence,
the same text occurring in two different blocks can
be translated differently.

2.2 Evaluation Goals and Requirements

Although dynamic adaptation is closely related to
static domain adaptation (Foster and Kuhn, 2007),
in this scenario we are not interested in the quality
of the final model. In fact, this model is only avail-
able once the stream is depleted and therefore is not
used anymore.

What we are interested in, and what we want to
compare among different approaches, is the systems
evolvement over time.

Consider a translator who uses such an incremen-
tally adapting system and performs post-editing on
its suggested translations. The highest productivity

3In the CAT framework, the target part of a block is the
translation post-edited by the user.

434



gain is achieved when the adaptation is quick and
persistent.

Even though in this paper we are concerned with
an automatic metric, it is important to keep the use
case of CAT in mind, in particular the presence of
a human translator. The TransType2 project4 has
found that repeated correction of the same error is
strongly disliked by editors (Macklovitch, 2006) and
may lead to rejection of the entire system. Similarly,
segments that were translated correctly by previous,
less adapted systems, should not be negatively af-
fected by updates. We will refer to these particular
aspects of adaptation as backward reliability.

Automatic measures, which are aimed at static
MT modules, can not take the evolution of the sys-
tem into account and are therefore unable to pinpoint
such problems. Thus, they are not suitable for the
dynamic adaptation scenario.

A new evaluation methodology should satisfy the
following requirements:

• ability to compare different strategies
• show behavior over time and reward early im-

provements and consistent adaptation
• expose possible overfitting, i.e. check whether

generalization is lost due to overly aggressive
adaptation

• strong correlation to human productivity
• estimate benefit over a static baseline model

without adaptation
• check backward reliability.

2.3 Evaluation Protocol
The performance of adaptive systems as sketched
in Section 2.1 is evaluated on different parts of the
stream as opposed to the global evaluation used for
static systems. We distinguish between two proto-
cols which differ in their use of historic data.

For block-wise evaluation only the translations of
the most recent block are evaluated with respect to
the correct translations once these become available.
Any static automatic MT score, e.g. TER (Snover
et al., 2006), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), can be
used, provided that it is reliable on a block of usually
relatively small size.

In contrast, in incremental evaluation the scores
are computed on all blocks available so far. The

4http://tt2.atosorigin.es

translations of previous blocks are kept fixed, i.e.
blocks are not translated again once a newly adapted
system becomes available as this new system has al-
ready seen this data.

Both the block-wise and incremental protocols
yield a sequence of scores that reflects the adaptation
behavior over time. The former is useful to expose
potential weaknesses as discussed above: we expect
to see improvement at first and after a while, when
enough adaptation data is available, a level curve. If
this is not the case, this indicates a problem:

i) should the scores deteriorate over time we
might be facing overfitting, possibly due to un-
expected heterogeneity in our corpus;

ii) if the scores continue to improve, then the adap-
tation method is not aggressive enough and the
system underfits.

The incremental evaluation on the other hand allows
for easy comparison of different adaptation strate-
gies. While the performance on the most recent
block becomes less important over time, the perfor-
mance on all the blocks processed so far nicely re-
flects the utility of the system in the application set-
ting.

The metric we are going to propose in the next
section processes such sequences of partial scores.
It accumulates the trend into a single number and
offers an interpretation that relates adaptive behavior
to productivity gains.

3 The Percentage Slope

Learning curves (see (Stump P.E., 2002) for a de-
tailed introduction) are mathematical models used
to estimate the efficiency gain when an activity is
repeated. The learning effect was noted in indus-
trial environment: the underlying notion is that when
people repeat an activity, there tends to be a gain in
efficiency. That is exactly the expected behavior of
our dynamically adapting MT system: it should im-
prove its performance on texts including terms and
expressions whose proper translation has been pre-
viously provided. Thus we decided to exploit ele-
ments from learning theory to measure the evolution
of translation capability.

Several learning curve models have been pro-
posed, but only two are in widespread use, the unit

435



(U) model due to Crawford and the cumulative av-
erage (CA) model due to Wright. Both models are
based on a common mathematical form:

y = axb (1)

where:

a represents the theoretical labor hours required
to build the first unit produced (a positive num-
ber)

b represents the rate of learning (negative value,
except for “forgetting”)

x represents the number of an item in the produc-
tion sequence (unit #1, #2, #3, . . .)

The models differ in the interpretation of y:

U: y is the labor hours required to build unit #x

CA: y is the average labor hours per unit required
to build the first x units

Since b is a mathematically appropriate but
counter-intuitive number for describing the slope,
the percentage slope S is typically used:

S = 10b log10(2)+2 (2)

S provides the rate of learning on a scale of 0 to 100,
as a percentage. A 100% slope represents no learn-
ing at all, zero percentage reflects a theoretically in-
finite rate of learning. In practice, human operations
hardly ever achieve a rate of learning faster than 70%
as measured on this scale.

The correspondence between our block-wise eval-
uation (Section 2.3) with the U model, and the incre-
mental evaluation with the CA model is straightfor-
ward. In the first case, y is the number of errors
done in the translation of the block #x; in the sec-
ond case, y is the average number of errors (that is
the TER score or the 100-BLEU score) made on the
first x blocks.

From a practical point of view, the sequence of
scores can be provided while the adapting system is
being used; the learning curve which best matches
the sequence is then found5 and eventually the per-
centage slope S is computed.

5Notice that the best fitting learning curve can be estimated
in the log scale with a simple linear regression analysis.

4 Experiments

In order to test-drive the evaluation metric intro-
duced in Section 3, several SMT systems showing
effective, weak, poor or absent adaptation capabil-
ity have been developed. Moreover, a preliminary
investigation on backward reliability has been car-
ried out. The next paragraphs detail and discuss the
experiments performed.

4.1 Data

The task considered in this work involves the trans-
lation from English into Italian of documents in the
Information Technology (IT) domain.

The training set consists of a large Translation
Memory in the IT domain and several OPUS6 sub-
corpora, namely KDE4, KDEdoc and PHP. The test
set includes the human generated translation of 6
documents, disjoint from the training set. Although
in the same domain, the test set is quite different
from the training data as shown by comparing val-
ues of perplexity (650 vs. 40) and OOV rate (2.4%
vs. 0.4%) computed on the source side.7 Further-
more, the 6 documents significantly differ among
each other: perplexity and OOV rate range from 465
to 880 and from 0.8 to 3.3, respectively. Table 1 col-
lects overall statistics on training and test sets.

To simulate the stream of fresh data, the IT test
set has been split into blocks of about a thousand8

words each. Before splitting, sentences have been
scrambled, with the rationale of generating a large
number of homogeneous blocks, simulating a test
set consisting of a single document.

7Figures for the training data were measured through a

cross-validation technique.
8Different sizes have been also considered (three and five

thousands) to test different adaptation rates, but results were
qualitatively similar to those on shorter blocks and then are not
reported.

4.2 Baseline System

The SMT baseline system is built upon the open-
source MT toolkit Moses9 (Koehn et al., 2007).
The translation and the lexicalized reordering mod-
els are estimated on parallel training data with the
default setting; a 5-gram LM smoothed through the
improved Kneser-Ney technique (Chen and Good-
man, 1999) is estimated on monolingual texts via
the IRSTLM toolkit (Federico et al., 2008). Here-
inafter, these models are referred to as background
(BG) models. The log-linear interpolation weights
are optimized by means of the standard MERT pro-
cedure provided within the Moses toolkit.

4.3 Adaptive System

The adapting SMT system is built on Moses as well.
Besides the BG models of the baseline system, trans-
lation, reordering and language models estimated on
the stream of fresh data are employed as additional
features. Hereinafter, these models are referred to
as foreground (FG) models. Unless differently spec-
ified, the FG models employed to translate a given
block are trained on all preceding blocks. Note that
the first instance of the adapting system (i.e. that
translating the first block) is exactly the baseline sys-
tem, because no adaptation data is available to train
FG models yet. FG translation and reordering mod-
els are trained in the same way as the BG models.
Due to the limited amount of adaptation data, the FG
LM is a 3-gram LM smoothed through the more ro-
bust Witten-Bell technique (Witten and Bell, 1991).

The interpolation weights are inherited from a
companion system trained and tuned on a different
domain – official documents of the European Union
organization – and are kept fixed.

4.4 Experiments on Adaptive SMT

First of all, the baseline and adapting systems were
run on the scrambled test set and compared at both
block-wise and incremental mode (see Section 2.3).

Figure 1 plots block-wise TER and BLEU scores
of the baseline and adapting systems as functions of
the amount (number of words) of adaptation data.
On one hand, it can be guessed that the adapting
system performs gradually better and better than the
baseline; on the other hand, it is evident that such

9http://www.statmt.org/moses

plots are not the most effective way to show the evo-
lution of the adapting system. In fact, the transla-
tion difficulty of contiguous blocks can differ a lot.
Hence, scores computed on them are not comparable
and the corresponding curves are jagged.

The block-wise differences of TER and BLEU
scores between the adapting and the baseline sys-
tems are plotted in Figure 2: the plots are now
cleaner and more readable and vaguely suggest a
positive trend, but still remain too jagged and do not
provide any information about the absolute perfor-
mance of the systems.

Figure 3 plots the incremental TER and BLEU
scores of the baseline and adapting systems as func-
tions of the amount of adaptation data. First of all,
it is worth noting that the right-most values are the
scores computed on the whole test set. In standard
evaluation, those would be the only scores provided
to show how the adapting system outperforms the
baseline system; in particular, the relative improve-
ment is larger for TER (9.3%) than for BLEU (3.9%)
supposedly because tuning was performed to opti-
mize BLEU score which thus is harder to improve.
However, the overall scores obscure the way they
are reached, that is the evolution over time of the
systems, which is especially important for adaptive
systems.

Secondly, the incremental evaluation yields much
smoother plots clearly showing that after initial fluc-
tuations: (i) performance of the baseline stabilizes
around an average which does not change over time;
(ii) scores of the adapting system tend to get increas-
ingly better as more adaptation data is available for
updating FG models.

The evaluation metric we are proposing, the per-
centage slope introduced in Section 3, is indeed able
to spot such kind of paradigmatic behaviors as we
will see in the next section. But before going on
with the assessment of the metric, some further com-
ments on Figure 3:

• in early stages, the adaptation is not effective,
likely because of the scarcity of data. This
raises two issues: design of more effective
adaptation strategies and, in the CAT frame-
work, identifying the appropriate time to re-
place the baseline with the adapting system;

• the adaptive system outperforms the baseline in

terms of TER very soon, while the overtaking
with regard to BLEU is observed much later.
This is because the baseline SMT system was
tuned with respect to the BLEU score on in-
domain data, differently to the adapting system.

Both these issues are out of the scope of this paper
and will be subject of future investigations.

4.5 Assessment of the Percentage Slope
To assess its effectiveness, the percentage slope has
been computed on errors committed by the baseline
system, the adapting system and an adapting system
featuring only FG models (that is without BG mod-
els). The FG-only system was used to translate each
block either fairly and unfairly: the former mode fits
the adaptation process sketched in Section 2.1; in the
latter mode, the FG model is adapted on the block

before its translation starts.
Figure 4 shows the TER and BLEU scores of such

systems in the incremental evaluation. The four dif-
ferent behaviors are expected to correspond to dif-
ferent percentage slopes. In fact, the S values col-
lected in Table 2 confirm the expectations:

• the baseline, completely unable to learn, has in
fact an S of 100%

• the adapting system, that learns through a dy-
namic adaptation of FG models and generalizes
thanks to BG models, has an S of 96-98%

• the FG-only adapting system tested in unfair
mode worsens its performance as the models
become larger, i.e. less focused on the block to
be translated: this is evidenced by an S greater
than 100%

• the FG-only adapting system tested in fair
mode increases its performance as the models
become larger, i.e. more general, as evidenced
by an S similar to that of our original adapting
system (96%).

Therefore, we can state that S exposes common
behaviors of evolving SMT systems; however, stan-
dard metrics like TER and BLEU are still in charge
of providing absolute performance measures.

In order to give a hint for properly interpret-
ing the values reported, we summarize the discus-
sion in (Stump P.E., 2002) about “typical learning
slopes”. Operations that are fully automated tend
to have slopes of 100%, 70% if entirely manual, an
intermediate value if mixed. In real industrial envi-
ronments, the average slope depends on the type of
manufacturing activity: for example, in aircraft in-
dustry it is about 85%, it ranges in 90-95% in elec-
tronics and in machining. Hence, a 96-98% slope
as we measured in our experiments must be con-
sidered a significant learning ability of a fully au-

tomated system.

4.6 Experiments on Backward Reliability
A proper assessment of the backward reliability of
an evolving system as defined in Section 2.2 would
require the identification of patterns translated dif-
ferently by the system during its life. We will inves-
tigate this issue in the future. For the moment, we
try to attack the problem from a global point of view:
we simply check that the adaptive system does ”re-
member” its previous translation capabilities “on av-
erage”, while it learns to better translate novel texts.

To this end, a cross-validation policy was fol-
lowed: the first two thirds of each test set document
are used for dynamically training the FG models,
while the remaining portions are used as held-out
test sets.

Figure 5 reports the TER and BLEU scores on
the 6 test sets of three systems: the baseline sys-
tem (bsln), the adapting system (ada) fed by in-
crementally merging the available reduced adapta-
tion sets, and the system adapted on all adaptation
data sets (final).

The final system achieves performance close
to ada system on each held-out set; this reveals that
our adaptation process is effective both in learning
and in remembering.

We think that the monitoring of the backward re-
liability of adapting systems is a good practice. A
cross validation scheme like ours allows not only to
reveal the backward reliability as shown before, but
also to discover the forgetting trend of, for example,
an MT system featuring an overly aggressive learn-

ing method. On the other hand, it only provides cues
about the average behavior and it is not as quickly
informative as a single score could be. Hence, the
design of a proper metric for measuring the back-
ward reliability of MT systems is a challenging task
that should be faced by the research community.

5 Summary and Future Work

The evaluation of a dynamically adapting system is
an open issue. Metrics used in interactive MT such
as HTER or field tests, are infeasible in the daily de-
velopment as they involve human translators/judges.
On the other hand, standard MT evaluation met-
rics either do not expose changes over time (BLEU,
TER) or cannot be applied (CER).

The main contribution of this paper is to propose
the use of the percentage slope for the evaluation of
adapting MT systems, a metric borrowed from the
theory on learning curves. For assessing its effec-
tiveness, we have developed a simple but effective
adapting SMT system suitable to work in the context
of a CAT tool supported by MT. We have compared
several ways to plot the change in error rate over
time for different systems and identified the most
suitable for computing the percentage slope. Finally,
we have shown that the percentage slope well ex-
poses the paradigmatic behaviors of evolving SMT
systems.

The MateCAT project has scheduled field tests
for the near future which will allow for inclusion
of human productivity in the assessment of the per-
centage slope. Moreover, efforts will be devoted to
the design of adaptation techniques which are more

sophisticated than the simple approach used in this
work.

We have also identified the issue of backward re-
liability of an adapting system, that is the ability to
learn without forgetting the past, and the importance
of monitoring it. A best practice based on a cross
validation scheme has been proposed. Future inves-
tigations will concern finding an effective metric to
measure backward reliability.
