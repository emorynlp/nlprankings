Abstract

The SemEval-2010 benchmark dataset has brought renewed attention to the task of automatic
keyphrase extraction. This dataset is made up of scientific articles that were automatically con-
verted from PDF format to plain text and thus require careful preprocessing so that irrevelant
spans of text do not negatively affect keyphrase extraction performance. In previous work, a
wide range of document preprocessing techniques were described but their impact on the overall
performance of keyphrase extraction models is still unexplored. Here, we re-assess the perfor-
mance of several keyphrase extraction models and measure their robustness against increasingly
sophisticated levels of document preprocessing.

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen a surge of interest in automatic keyphrase extraction, thanks to the availability
of the SemEval-2010 benchmark dataset (Kim et al., 2010). This dataset is composed of documents
(scientific articles) that were automatically converted from PDF format to plain text. As a result, most
documents contain irrelevant pieces of text (e.g. muddled sentences, tables, equations, footnotes) that re-
quire special handling, so as to not hinder the performance of keyphrase extraction systems. In previous
work, these are usually removed at the preprocessing step, but using a variety of techniques ranging from
simple heuristics (Wang and Li, 2010; Treeratpituk et al., 2010; Zervanou, 2010) to sophisticated docu-
ment logical structure detection on richly-formatted documents recovered from Google Scholar (Nguyen
and Luong, 2010). Under such conditions, it may prove difficult to draw firm conclusions about which
keyphrase extraction model performs best, as the impact of preprocessing on overall performance cannot
be properly quantified.

While previous work clearly states that efficient document preprocessing is a prerequisite for the ex-
traction of high quality keyphrases, there is, to our best knowledge, no empirical evidence of how prepro-
cessing affects keyphrase extraction performance. In this paper, we re-assess the performance of several
state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction models at increasingly sophisticated levels of preprocessing. Three
incremental levels of document preprocessing are experimented with: raw text, text cleaning through
document logical structure detection, and removal of keyphrase sparse sections of the document. In
doing so, we present the first consistent comparison of different keyphrase extraction models and study
their robustness over noisy text. More precisely, our contributions are:

• We show that performance variation across keyphrase extraction systems is, at least in part, a func-
tion of the (often unstated) effectiveness of document preprocessing.

• We empirically show that supervised models are more resilient to noise, and point out that the
performance gap between baselines and top performing systems is narrowing with the increase in
preprocessing effort.

• We compare the previously reported results of several keyphrase extraction models with that of
our re-implementation, and observe that baseline performance is underestimated because of the
inconsistence in document preprocessing.

• We release both a new version of the SemEval-2010 dataset1 with preprocessed documents and our
implementation of the state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction models2 using the pke toolkit (Boudin,
2016) for use by the community.

2 Dataset and Preprocessing

The SemEval-2010 benchmark dataset (Kim et al., 2010) is composed of 244 scientific articles collected
from the ACM Digital Library (conference and workshop papers). The input papers ranged from 6
to 8 pages and were converted from PDF format to plain text using an off-the-shelf tool3. The only
preprocessing applied is a systematic dehyphenation at line breaks4 and removal of author-assigned
keyphrases. Scientific articles were selected from four different research areas as defined in the ACM
classification, and were equally distributed into training (144 articles) and test (100 articles) sets. Gold
standard keyphrases are composed of both author-assigned keyphrases collected from the original PDF
files and reader-assigned keyphrases provided by student annotators.

Long documents such as those in the SemEval-2010 benchmark dataset are notoriously difficult to
handle due to the large number of keyphrase candidates (i.e. phrases that are eligible to be keyphrases)
that the systems have to cope with (Hasan and Ng, 2014). Furthermore, noisy textual content, whether
due to format conversion errors or to unusable elements (e.g. equations), yield many spurious keyphrase
candidates that negatively affect keyphrase extraction performance. This is particularly true for systems
that make use of core NLP tools to select candidates, that in turn exhibit poor performance on degraded
text. Filtering out irrelevant text is therefore needed for addressing these issues.

In this study, we concentrate our effort on re-assessing keyphrase extraction performance on three
increasingly sophisticated levels of document preprocessing described below.

Level 1: We process each input file with the Stanford CoreNLP suite (Manning et al., 2014)5. We use
the default parameters and perform tokenization, sentence splitting and Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging.

Level 2: Similarly to (Nguyen and Luong, 2010; Lopez and Romary, 2010), we retrieve6 the original
PDF files from the ACM Digital Library. We then extract the enriched7 textual content of the PDF
files using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system8, and perform document logical structure
detection using ParsCit (Kan et al., 2010)9. We use the detected logical structure to remove author-
assigned keyphrases and select only relevant elements: title, headers, abstract, introduction, related
work, body text10 and conclusion. We finally apply a systematic dehyphenation at line breaks and run
the Stanford CoreNLP suite.

Level 3: As pointed out by (Treeratpituk et al., 2010; Nguyen and Luong, 2010; Wang and Li, 2010;
Eichler and Neumann, 2010; El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2010), considering only the keyphrase dense parts
of the scientific articles allows to improve keyphrase extraction performance. Accordingly we follow
previous work and further abridge the input text from level 2 preprocessed documents to the following:
title, headers, abstract, introduction, related work, background and conclusion. Here, the idea is to
achieve the best compromise between search space (number of candidates) and maximum performance
(recall).

Table 1 shows the average number of sentences and words along with the maximum possible recall
for each level of preprocessing. The maximum recall is obtained by computing the fraction of the ref-
erence keyphrases that occur in the documents. We observe that the level 2 preprocessing succeeds in
eliminating irrelevant text by significantly reducing the number of words (-19%) while maintaining a
high maximum recall (-2%). Level 3 preprocessing drastically reduce the number of words to less than
a quarter of the original amount while interestingly still preserving high recall.

3 Keyphrase Extraction Models

We re-implemented five keyphrase extraction models : the first two are commonly used as baselines, the
third is a resource-lean unsupervised graph-based ranking approach, and the last two were among the top
performing systems in the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction task (Kim et al., 2010). We note that two
of the systems are supervised and rely on the training set to build their classification models. Document
frequency counts are also computed on the training set11. Stemming12 is applied to allow more robust
matching. The different keyphrase extraction models are briefly described below:

TF×IDF: we re-implemented the TF×IDF n-gram based baseline computed by the task organizers.
We use 1, 2, 3-grams as keyphrase candidates and filter out those shorter than 3 characters, containing
words made of only punctuation marks or one character long13.

Kea (Witten et al., 1999): keyphrase candidates are 1, 2, 3-grams that do not begin or end with a stop-
word14. Keyphrases are selected using a naı̈ve bayes classifier15 with two features: TF×IDF and the
relative position of first occurrence.

TopicRank (Bougouin et al., 2013): keyphrase candidates are the longest sequences of adjacent nouns
and adjectives. Lexically similar candidates are clustered into topics and ranked using TextRank (Mi-
halcea and Tarau, 2004). Keyphrases are produced by extracting the first occurring candidate of the
highest ranked topics.

KP-Miner (El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2010): keyphrase candidates are sequences of words that do not
contain punctuation marks or stopwords. Candidates that appear less than three times or that first occur
beyond a certain position are removed16. Candidates are then weighted using a modified TF×IDF
formula that account for document length.

WINGNUS (Nguyen and Luong, 2010): keyphrase candidates are simplex nouns and noun phrases
detected using a set of rules described in (Kim and Kan, 2009). Keyphrases are then selected using
a naı̈ve bayes classifier with the optimal set of features found on the training set17: TF×IDF, relative
position of first occurrence and candidate length in words.
11For more reliable estimates, we rely on level 2 counts when experimenting with level 3.
12We use the Porter stemmer in nltk.
13This filtering process is also applied to the other models.
14We use the stoplist in nltk, http://www.nltk.org
15We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn with default parameters, http://scikit-learn.

16To better see the impact of preprocessing, we do not consider the cutoff parameter in our experiments. The least allowable

seen frequency parameter is set to 2 which is the optimal value found on the training set.
17The optimal set of features in (Nguyen and Luong, 2010) also include the term frequency of substrings, but we observed a

significant drop in performance when this feature is included.

123



Each model uses a distinct keyphrase candidate selection method that provides a trade-off between the
highest attainable recall and the size of set of candidates. Table 2 summarizes these numbers for each
model. Syntax-based selection heuristics, as used by TopicRank and WINGNUS, are better suited to
prune candidates that are unlikely to be keyphrases. As for KP-miner, removing infrequent candidates
may seem rather blunt, but it turns out to be a simple yet effective pruning method when dealing with
long documents. For details on how candidate selection methods affect keyphrase extraction, please refer
to (Wang et al., 2014).

WINGNUS 75.2% 1 355 73.0% 1 007 63.0% 403

Table 2: Maximum recall and average number of keyphrase candidates for each model.

Apart from TopicRank that groups similar candidates into topics, the other models do not have any
redundancy control mechanism. Yet, recent work has shown that up to 12% of the overall error made
by state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction systems were due to redundancy (Hasan and Ng, 2014; Boudin,
2015). Therefore as a post-ranking step, we remove redundant keyphrases from the ranked lists generated
by all models. A keyphrase is considered redundant if it is included in another keyphrase that is ranked
higher in the list.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental settings
We follow the evaluation procedure used in the SemEval-2010 competition and evaluate the perfor-
mance of each model in terms of f-measure (F) at the top N keyphrases18. We use the set of combined
author- and reader-assigned keyphrases as reference keyphrases. Extracted and reference keyphrases are
stemmed to reduce the number of mismatches.

4.2 Results
The performances of the keyphrase extraction models at each preprocessing level are shown in Table 3.
Overall, we observe a significant increase of performance for all models at levels 3, confirming that
document preprocessing plays an important role in keyphrase extraction performance. Also, the differ-
ence of f-score between the models, as measured by the standard deviation σ1, gradually decreases with
the increasing level of preprocessing. This result strengthens the assumption made in this paper, that
performance variation across models is partly a function of the effectiveness of document preprocessing.

Somewhat surprisingly, the ordering of the two best models reverses at level 3. This showcases that
rankings are heavily influenced by the preprocessing stage, despite the common lack of details and
analysis it suffers from in explanatory papers. We also remark that the top performing model, namely
KP-Miner, is unsupervised which supports the findings of (Hasan and Ng, 2014) indicating that recent
unsupervised approaches have rivaled their supervised counterparts in performance.

In an attempt to quantify the performance variation across preprocessing levels, we compute the stan-
dard deviation σ2 for each model. Here we see that unsupervised models are more sensitive to noisy
input, as revealed by higher standard deviations. We found two main reasons for this. First, using multi-
ple discriminative features to rank keyphrase candidates adds inherent robustness to the models. Second,
the supervision signal helps models to disregard noise.

In Table 4, we compare the outputs of the five models by measuring the percentage of valid keyphrases
that are retrieved by all models at once for each preprocessing level. By these additional results, we aim

to assess whether document preprocessing smoothes differences between models. We observe that the
overlap between the outputs of the different models increases along with the level of preprocessing. This
suggests that document preprocessing reduces the effect that the keyphrase extraction model in itself has
on overall performance. In other words, the singularity of each model fades away gradually with increase
in preprocessing effort.

4.3 Reproducibility

Being able to reproduce experimental results is a central aspect of the scientific method. While assessing
the importance of the preprocessing stage for five approaches, we found that several results were not
reproducible, as shown in Table 5.

TopicRank 12.1 +0.1 +0.4 +2.4
TF×IDF 14.4 +1.6 +2.0 +4.9
KP-Miner 23.2 −3.2 −3.4 −0.7
WINGNUS 24.7 −4.2 −4.4 −2.8

Table 5: Difference in f-score between our re-implementation and the original scores reported in (Hasan
and Ng, 2014; Bougouin et al., 2013).

We note that the trends for baselines and high ranking systems are opposite: compared to the published
results, our reproduction of top systems under-performs and our reproduction of baselines over-performs.
We hypothesise that this stems from a difference in hyperparameter tuning, including the ones that the
preprocessing stage makes implicit. Competitors have strong incentives to correctly optimize hyperpa-
rameters, to achieve a high ranking and get more publicity for their work while competition organizers
might have the opposite incentive: too strong a baseline might not be considered a baseline anymore.

We also observe that with this leveled preprocessing, the gap between baselines and top systems is
much smaller, lessening again the importance of raw scores and rankings to interpret the shared task
results and emphasizing the importance of understanding correctly the preprocessing stage.

5 Additional experiments

In the previous sections, we provided empirical evidence that document preprocessing weighs heavily on
the outcome of keyphrase extraction models. This raises the question of whether further improvement
might be gained from a more aggressive preprocessing. To answer this question, we take another step
beyond content filtering and further abridge the input text from level 3 preprocessed documents using
an unsupervised summarization technique. More specifically, we keep the title and abstract intact, as
they are the two most keyphrase dense parts within scientific articles (Nguyen and Luong, 2010), and
select only the most content bearing sentences from the remaining contents. To do this, sentences are
ordered using TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and the less informative ones, as determined by
their TextRank scores normalized by their lengths in words, are filtered out.

Finding the optimal subset of sentences from already shortened documents is however no trivial task
as maximum recall linearly decreases with the number of sentences discarded. Here, we simply set the
reduction ratio to 0.865 so that the average maximum recall on the training set does not lose more than
5%. Table 6 shows the reduction in the average number of sentences and words compared to level 3
preprocessing.

Table 6: Statistics computed at level 4 of document preprocessing on the training set. We also report the
relative difference with respect to level 3 preprocessing.

The performances of the keyphrase extraction models at level 4 preprocessing are shown in Table 7.
We note that two models, namely TopicRank and TF×IDF, lose on performance. These two models
mainly rely on frequency counts to rank keyphrase candidates, which in turn become less reliable at level
4 because of the very short length of the documents. Other models however have their f-scores once
again increased, thus indicating that further improvement is possible from more reductive document
preprocessing strategies.

6 Conclusion

In this study, we re-assessed the performance of several keyphrase extraction models and showed that
performance variation across models is partly a function of the effectiveness of the document prepro-
cessing. Our results also suggest that supervised keyphrase extraction models are more robust to noisy
input.

Given our findings, we recommend that future works use a common preprocessing to evaluate the
interest of keyphrase extraction approaches. For this reason we make the four levels of preprocessing
used in this study available for the community.
