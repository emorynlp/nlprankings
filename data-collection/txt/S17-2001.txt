Abstract

Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) mea-
sures the meaning similarity of sentences.
Applications include machine translation
(MT), summarization, generation, question
answering (QA), short answer grading, se-
mantic search, dialog and conversational
systems. The STS shared task is a venue
for assessing the current state-of-the-art.
The 2017 task focuses on multilingual and
cross-lingual pairs with one sub-track ex-
ploring MT quality estimation (MTQE)
data. The task obtained strong participa-
tion from 31 teams, with 17 participating
in all language tracks. We summarize per-
formance and review a selection of well
performing methods. Analysis highlights
common errors, providing insight into the
limitations of existing models. To support
ongoing work on semantic representations,
the STS Benchmark is introduced as a new
shared training and evaluation set carefully
selected from the corpus of English STS
shared task data (2012-2017).

1 Introduction
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) assesses the
degree to which two sentences are semantically
equivalent to each other. The STS task is moti-
vated by the observation that accurately modeling
the meaning similarity of sentences is a founda-
tional language understanding problem relevant to
numerous applications including: machine trans-
lation (MT), summarization, generation, question
answering (QA), short answer grading, semantic
search, dialog and conversational systems. STS en-
ables the evaluation of techniques from a diverse
set of domains against a shared interpretable perfor-
mance criteria. Semantic inference tasks related to

STS include textual entailment (Bentivogli et al.,
2016; Bowman et al., 2015; Dagan et al., 2010),
semantic relatedness (Bentivogli et al., 2016) and
paraphrase detection (Xu et al., 2015; Ganitkevitch
et al., 2013; Dolan et al., 2004). STS differs from
both textual entailment and paraphrase detection
in that it captures gradations of meaning overlap
rather than making binary classifications of par-
ticular relationships. While semantic relatedness
expresses a graded semantic relationship as well, it
is non-specific about the nature of the relationship
with contradictory material still being a candidate
for a high score (e.g., “night” and “day” are highly
related but not particularly similar).

To encourage and support research in this area,
the STS shared task has been held annually since
2012, providing a venue for evaluation of state-of-
the-art algorithms and models (Agirre et al., 2012,
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). During this time, di-
verse similarity methods and data sets1 have been
explored. Early methods focused on lexical se-
mantics, surface form matching and basic syntac-
tic similarity (Bär et al., 2012; Šarić et al., 2012a;
Jimenez et al., 2012a). During subsequent evalua-
tions, strong new similarity signals emerged, such
as Sultan et al. (2015)’s alignment based method.
More recently, deep learning became competitive
with top performing feature engineered systems
(He et al., 2016). The best performance tends to
be obtained by ensembling feature engineered and
deep learning models (Rychalska et al., 2016).

Significant research effort has focused on STS
over English sentence pairs.2 English STS is a

glosses from lexical resources including WordNet (Miller,
1995; Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998),
OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), web discussion fora, plagia-
rism, MT post-editing and Q&A data sets. Data sets are sum-
marized on: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki.

2The 2012 and 2013 STS tasks were English only. The
2014 and 2015 task included a Spanish track and 2016 had a

1



well-studied problem, with state-of-the-art systems
often achieving 70 to 80% correlation with human
judgment. To promote progress in other languages,
the 2017 task emphasizes performance on Arabic
and Spanish as well as cross-lingual pairings of
English with material in Arabic, Spanish and Turk-
ish. The primary evaluation criteria combines per-
formance on all of the different language condi-
tions except English-Turkish, which was run as a
surprise language track. Even with this departure
from prior years, the task attracted 31 teams pro-
ducing 84 submissions.

STS shared task data sets have been used exten-
sively for research on sentence level similarity and
semantic representations (i.a., Arora et al. (2017);
Conneau et al. (2017); Mu et al. (2017); Pagliardini
et al. (2017); Wieting and Gimpel (2017); He and
Lin (2016); Hill et al. (2016); Kenter et al. (2016);
Lau and Baldwin (2016); Wieting et al. (2016b,a);
He et al. (2015); Pham et al. (2015)). To encourage
the use of a common evaluation set for assessing
new methods, we present the STS Benchmark, a
publicly available selection of data from English
STS shared tasks (2012-2017).

2 Task Overview
STS is the assessment of pairs of sentences accord-
ing to their degree of semantic similarity. The task
involves producing real-valued similarity scores
for sentence pairs. Performance is measured by the
Pearson correlation of machine scores with human
judgments. The ordinal scale in Table 1 guides
human annotation, ranging from 0 for no meaning
overlap to 5 for meaning equivalence. Intermediate
values reflect interpretable levels of partial overlap
in meaning. The annotation scale is designed to
be accessible by reasonable human judges with-
out any formal expertise in linguistics. Using rea-
sonable human interpretations of natural language
semantics was popularized by the related textual
entailment task (Dagan et al., 2010). The result-
ing annotations reflect both pragmatic and world
knowledge and are more interpretable and useful
within downstream systems.

3 Evaluation Data
The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)
corpus (Bowman et al., 2015) is the primary evalu-
ation data source with the exception that one of the

pilot track on cross-lingual Spanish-English STS. The English
tracks attracted the most participation and have the largest use
of the evaluation data in ongoing research.

5

The two sentences are completely equivalent, as they
mean the same thing.
The bird is bathing in the sink.
Birdie is washing itself in the water basin.

4

The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some
unimportant details differ.
Two boys on a couch are playing video games.
Two boys are playing a video game.

3

The two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some
important information differs/missing.
John said he is considered a witness but not a suspect.
“He is not a suspect anymore.” John said.

2

The two sentences are not equivalent, but share some
details.
They flew out of the nest in groups.
They flew into the nest together.

1

The two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the
same topic.
The woman is playing the violin.
The young lady enjoys listening to the guitar.

0

The two sentences are completely dissimilar.
The black dog is running through the snow.
A race car driver is driving his car through the mud.

English examples from Agirre et al. (2013).

cross-lingual tracks explores data from the WMT
2014 quality estimation task (Bojar et al., 2014).3

Sentences pairs in SNLI derive from Flickr30k
image captions (Young et al., 2014) and are labeled
with the entailment relations: entailment, neutral,
and contradiction. Drawing from SNLI allows STS
models to be evaluated on the type of data used to
assess textual entailment methods. However, since
entailment strongly cues for semantic relatedness
(Marelli et al., 2014), we construct our own sen-
tence pairings to deter gold entailment labels from
informing evaluation set STS scores.

Track 4b investigates the relationship between
STS and MT quality estimation by providing STS
labels for WMT quality estimation data. The data
includes Spanish translations of English sentences
from a variety of methods including RBMT, SMT,
hybrid-MT and human translation. Translations
are annotated with the time required for human cor-
rection by post-editing and Human-targeted Trans-
lation Error Rate (HTER) (Snover et al., 2006).4

Participants are not allowed to use the gold quality
estimation annotations to inform STS scores.

3Previous years of the STS shared task include more data
sources. This year the task draws from two data sources and
includes a diverse set of languages and language-pairs.

4HTER is the minimal number of edits required for cor-
rection of a translation divided by its length after correction.

3.1 Tracks

Table 2 summarizes the evaluation data by track.
The six tracks span four languages: Arabic, En-
glish, Spanish and Turkish. Track 4 has subtracks
with 4a drawing from SNLI and 4b pulling from
WMT’s quality estimation task. Track 6 is a sur-
prise language track with no annotated training
data and the identity of the language pair first an-
nounced when the evaluation data was released.

3.2 Data Preparation

This section describes the preparation of the eval-
uation data. For SNLI data, this includes the se-
lection of sentence pairs, annotation of pairs with
STS labels and the translation of the original En-
glish sentences. WMT quality estimation data is
directly annotated with STS labels.

3.3 Arabic, Spanish and Turkish Translation

Sentences from SNLI are human translated into
Arabic, Spanish and Turkish. Sentences are trans-
lated independently from their pairs. Arabic trans-
lation is provided by CMU-Qatar by native Arabic
speakers with strong English skills. Translators
are given an English sentence and its Arabic ma-
chine translation5 where they perform post-editing
to correct errors. Spanish translation is completed
by a University of Sheffield graduate student who
is a native Spanish speaker and fluent in English.
Turkish translations are obtained from SDL.6

3.4 Embedding Space Pair Selection

We construct our own pairings of the SNLI sen-
tences to deter gold entailment labels being used
to inform STS scores. The word embedding sim-
ilarity selection heuristic from STS 2016 (Agirre
et al., 2016) is used to find interesting pairs. Sen-
tence embeddings are computed as the sum of in-

Sentences with likely meaning overlap are identi-
fied using cosine similarity, Eq. (1).

simv(s1, s2) =
v(s1)v(s2)

‖v(s1)‖2‖v(s2)‖2 (1)

4 Annotation
Annotation of pairs with STS labels is performed
using Crowdsourcing, with the exception of Track
4b that uses a single expert annotator.

4.1 Crowdsourced Annotations

Crowdsourced annotation is performed on Amazon
Mechanical Turk.8 Annotators examine the STS
pairings of English SNLI sentences. STS labels
are then transferred to the translated pairs for cross-
lingual and non-English tracks. The annotation in-
structions and template are identical to Agirre et al.
(2016). Labels are collected in batches of 20 pairs
with annotators paid $1 USD per batch. Five anno-
tations are collected per pair. The MTurk master9

qualification is required to perform the task. Gold
scores average the five individual annotations.

4.2 Expert Annotation

English-Spanish WMT quality estimation pairs for
Track 4b are annotated for STS by a University of
Sheffield graduate student who is a native speaker
of Spanish and fluent in English. This track differs
significantly in label distribution and the complex-
ity of the annotation task. Sentences in a pair are
translations of each other and tend to be more se-
mantically similar. Interpreting the potentially sub-
tle meaning differences introduced by MT errors
is challenging. To accurately assess STS perfor-
mance on MT quality estimation data, no attempt
is made to balance the data by similarity scores.

5 Training Data
The following summarizes the training data: Ta-
ble 3 English; Table 4 Spanish;10 Table 5 Spanish-
English; Table 6 Arabic; and Table 7 Arabic-
English. Arabic-English parallel data is supplied
by translating English training data, Table 8.

nington et al., 2014) trained on a combination of Gigaword

Table 4: Spanish training data.

English, Spanish and English-Spanish training
data pulls from prior STS evaluations. Arabic and
Arabic-English training data is produced by trans-
lating a subset of the English training data and
transferring the similarity scores. For the MT qual-
ity estimation data in track 4b, Spanish sentences
are translations of their English counterparts, dif-
fering substantially from existing Spanish-English
STS data. We release one thousand new Spanish-
English STS pairs sourced from the 2013 WMT
translation task and produced by a phrase-based
Moses SMT system (Bojar et al., 2013). The data
is expert annotated and has a similar label distribu-
tion to the track 4b test data with 17% of the pairs
scoring an STS score of less than 3, 23% scoring
3, 7% achieving a score of 4 and 53% scoring 5.

5.1 Training vs. Evaluation Data Analysis

that are slightly shorter than those from prior years
of the STS shared task, while the track 4b MT qual-

ity estimation data has sentences that are much
longer. The track 5 English data has an average
sentence length of 8.7 words, while the English
sentences from track 4b have an average length of
19.4. The English training data has the following
average lengths: 2012 10.8 words; 2013 8.8 words
(excludes restricted SMT data); 2014 9.1 words;
2015 11.5 words; 2016 13.8 words.

Similarity scores for our pairings of the SNLI
sentences are slightly lower than recent shared task
years and much lower than early years. The change
is attributed to differences in data selection and
filtering. The average 2017 similarity score is 2.2
overall and 2.3 on the track 7 English data. Prior
English data has the following average similarity
scores: 2016 2.4; 2015 2.4; 2014 2.8; 2013 3.0;
2012 3.5. Translation quality estimation data from
track 4b has an average similarity score of 4.0.

individual word appears in a sentence.12 For cross-
lingual pairs, non-English sentences are translated
into English using state-of-the-art machine trans-
lation.13 The baseline achieves an average corre-
lation of 53.7 with human judgment on tracks 1-5
and would rank 23rd overall out the 44 system sub-
missions that participated in all tracks.

6.5 Rankings

Participant performance is provided in Table 10.
ECNU is best overall (avg r: 0.7316) and achieves
the highest participant evaluation score on: track
2, Arabic-English (r: 0.7493); track 3, Spanish (r:
0.8559); and track 6, Turkish-English (r: 0.7706).
BIT attains the best performance on track 1, Arabic
(r: 0.7543). CompiLIG places first on track 4a,
SNLI Spanish-English (r: 0.8302). SEF@UHH
exhibits the best correlation on the difficult track
4b WMT quality estimation pairs (r: 0.3407). RTV
has the best system for the track 5 English data (r:
0.8547), followed closely by DT Team (r: 0.8536).

Especially challenging tracks with SNLI data
are: track 1, Arabic; track 2, Arabic-English; and
track 6, English-Turkish. Spanish-English perfor-
mance is much higher on track 4a’s SNLI data than
track 4b’s MT quality estimation data. This high-
lights the difficulty and importance of making fine
grained distinctions for certain downstream appli-
cations. Assessing STS methods for quality estima-
tion may benefit from using alternatives to Pearson
correlation for evaluation.14

Results tend to decrease on cross-lingual tracks.
The baseline drops > 10% relative on Arabic-
English and Spanish-English (SNLI) vs. mono-
lingual Arabic and Spanish. Many participant sys-
tems show smaller decreases. ECNU’s top ranking
entry performs slightly better on Arabic-English
than Arabic, with a slight drop from Spanish to
Spanish-English (SNLI).

6.6 Methods

Participating teams explore techniques ranging
from state-of-the-art deep learning models to elabo-
rate feature engineered systems. Prediction signals
include surface similarity scores such as edit dis-
tance and matching n-grams, scores derived from
word alignments across pairs, assessment by MT
evaluation metrics, estimates of conceptual simi-
larity as well as the similarity between word and
sentence level embeddings. For cross-lingual and
non-English tracks, MT was widely used to convert
the two sentences being compared into the same
language.15 Select methods are highlighted below.

14e.g., Reimers et al. (2016) report success using STS labels
with alternative metrics such as normalized Cumulative Gain
(nCG), normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) and
F1 to more accurately predict performance on the downstream
tasks: text reuse detection, binary classification of document
relatedness and document relatedness within a corpus.

ECNU (Tian et al., 2017) The best overall sys-
tem is from ENCU and ensembles well perform-
ing a feature engineered models with deep learn-
ing methods. Three feature engineered models
use Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB)
and XGBoost (XGB) regression methods with fea-
tures based on: n-gram overlap; edit distance;
longest common prefix/suffix/substring; tree ker-
nels (Moschitti, 2006); word alignments (Sul-
tan et al., 2015); summarization and MT evalua-
tion metrics (BLEU, GTM-3, NIST, WER, ME-
TEOR, ROUGE); and kernel similarity of bags-
of-words, bags-of-dependencies and pooled word-
embeddings. ECNU’s deep learning models are
differentiated by their approach to sentence em-
beddings using either: averaged word embeddings,
projected word embeddings, a deep averaging net-
work (DAN) (Iyyer et al., 2015) or LSTM (Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Each network feeds
the element-wise multiplication, subtraction and
concatenation of paired sentence embeddings to
additional layers to predict similarity scores. The
ensemble averages scores from the four deep learn-
ing and three feature engineered models.16

BIT (Wu et al., 2017) Second place overall is
achieved by BIT primarily using sentence informa-
tion content (IC) informed by WordNet and BNC
word frequencies. One submission uses sentence
IC exclusively. Another ensembles IC with Sul-
tan et al. (2015)’s alignment method, while a third
ensembles IC with cosine similarity of summed
word embeddings with an IDF weighting scheme.
Sentence IC in isolation outperforms all systems
except those from ECNU. Combining sentence IC
with word embedding similarity performs best.

HCTI (Shao, 2017) Third place overall is ob-
tained by HCTI with a model similar to a convolu-
tional Deep Structured Semantic Model (CDSSM)
(Chen et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2013). Sentence
embeddings are generated with twin convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). The embeddings are then
compared using cosine similarity and element wise
difference with the resulting values fed to addi-
tional layers to predict similarity labels. The archi-

and MITRE. HCTI submitted a separate run using ar, es and
en trained models that underperformed using their en model
with MT for ar and es. CompiLIG’s model is cross-lingual
but includes a word alignment feature that depends on MT.
SEF@UHH built ar, es, and en models and use bi-directional
MT for cross-lingual pairs. LIM-LIG and DT Team only par-
ticipate in monolingual tracks.

16The two remaining ECNU runs only use either RF or GB
and exclude the deep learning models.

tecture is abstractly similar to ECNU’s deep learn-
ing models. UMDeep (Barrow and Peskov, 2017)
took a similar approach using LSTMs rather than
CNNs for the sentence embeddings.

MITRE (Henderson et al., 2017) Fourth place
overall is MITRE that, like ECNU, takes an ambi-
tious feature engineering approach complemented
by deep learning. Ensembled components in-
clude: alignment similarity; TakeLab STS (Šarić
et al., 2012b); string similarity measures such as
matching n-grams, summarization and MT metrics
(BLEU, WER, PER, ROUGE); a RNN and recur-
rent convolutional neural networks (RCNN) over
word alignments; and a BiLSTM that is state-of-
the-art for textual entailment (Chen et al., 2016).

FCICU (Hassan et al., 2017) Fifth place overall
is FCICU that computes a sense-base alignment us-
ing BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010). Babel-
Net synsets are multilingual allowing non-English
and cross-lingual pairs to be processed similarly to
English pairs. Alignment similarity scores are used
with two runs: one that combines the scores within
a string kernel and another that uses them with a
weighted variant of Sultan et al. (2015)’s method.
Both runs average the Babelnet based scores with
soft-cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2012b).

CompiLIG (Ferrero et al., 2017) The best
Spanish-English performance on SNLI sentences
was achieved by CompiLIG using features in-
cluding: cross-lingual conceptual similarity using
DBNary (Serasset, 2015), cross-language Multi-
Vec word embeddings (Berard et al., 2016), and
Brychcin and Svoboda (2016)’s improvements to
Sultan et al. (2015)’s method.

LIM-LIG (Nagoudi et al., 2017) Using only
weighted word embeddings, LIM-LIG took sec-
ond place on Arabic.17 Arabic word embeddings
are summed into sentence embeddings using uni-
form, POS and IDF weighting schemes. Sentence
similarity is computed by cosine similarity. POS
and IDF outperform uniform weighting. Combin-
ing the IDF and POS weights by multiplication is
reported by LIM-LIG to achieve r 0.7667, higher
than all submitted Arabic (track 1) systems.

DT Team (Maharjan et al., 2017) Second place
on English (track 5)18 is DT Team using feature en-

17The approach is similar to SIF (Arora et al., 2017) but
without removal of the common principle component

18RTV took first place on track 5, English, but submitted
no system description paper.

gineering combined with the following deep learn-
ing models: DSSM (Huang et al., 2013), CDSSM
(Shen et al., 2014) and skip-thoughts (Kiros et al.,
2015). Engineered features include: unigram over-
lap, summed word alignments scores, fraction of
unaligned words, difference in word counts by type
(all, adj, adverbs, nouns, verbs), and min to max
ratios of words by type. Select features have a mul-
tiplicative penalty for unaligned words.

SEF@UHH (Duma and Menzel, 2017) First
place on the challenging Spanish-English MT pairs
(Track 4b) is SEF@UHH. Unsupervised similar-
ity scores are computed from paragraph vectors
(Le and Mikolov, 2014) using cosine, negation
of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and vector correlation.
MT converts cross-lingual pairs, L1-L2, into two
monolingual pairs, L1-L1 and L2-L2, with aver-
aging used to combine the monolingual similarity
scores. Bray-Curtis performs well overall, while
cosine does best on the Spanish-English MT pairs.

7 Analysis

Figure 1 plots model similarity scores against hu-
man STS labels for the top 5 systems from tracks
5 (English), 1 (Arabic) and 4b (English-Spanish
MT). While many systems return scores on the
same scale as the gold labels, 0-5, others return
scores from approximately 0 and 1. Lines on the
graphs illustrate perfect performance for both a 0-5
and a 0-1 scale. Mapping the 0 to 1 scores to range
from 0-5,20 approximately 80% of the scores from
top performing English systems are within 1.0 pt of
the gold label. Errors for Arabic are more broadly
distributed, particularly for model scores between
1 and 4. The English-Spanish MT plots the weak
relationship between the predicted and gold scores.

Table 12 provides examples of difficult sentence
pairs for participant systems and illustrates com-
mon sources of error for even well-ranking systems
including: (i) word sense disambiguation “making”

19ECNU, BIT and LIM-LIG are scaled to the range 0-5.
20snew = 5× s−min(s)max(s)−min(s) is used to rescale scores.

and “preparing” are very similar in the context of
“food”, while “picture” and “movie” are not similar
when picture is followed by “day”; (ii) attribute
importance “outside” vs. “deserted” are smaller
details when contrasting “The man is in a deserted
field” with “The man is outside in the field”; (iii)
compositional meaning “A man is carrying a ca-
noe with a dog” has the same content words as
“A dog is carrying a man in a canoe” but carries
a different meaning; (iv) negation systems score
“. . . with goggles and a swimming cap” as nearly
equivalent to “. . . without goggles or a swimming
cap”. Inflated similarity scores for examples like
“There is a young girl” vs. “There is a young boy
with the woman” demonstrate (v) semantic blend-
ing, whereby appending “with a woman” to “boy”
brings its representation closer to that of “girl”.

For multilingual and cross-lingual pairs, these is-
sues are magnified by translation errors for systems
that use MT followed by the application of a mono-
lingual similarity model. For track 4b Spanish-
English MT pairs, some of the poor performance
can in part be attributed to many systems using MT
to re-translate the output of another MT system, ob-
scuring errors in the original translation.

7.1 Contrasting Cross-lingual STS with MT
Quality Estimation

Since MT quality estimation pairs are translations
of the same sentence, they are expected to be min-
imally on the same topic and have an STS score
≥ 1.21 The actual distribution of STS scores is
such that only 13% of the test instances score be-
low 3, 22% of the instances score 3, 12% score 4
and 53% score 5. The high STS scores indicate
that MT systems are surprisingly good at preserv-
ing meaning. However, even for a human, inter-
preting changes caused by translations errors can
be difficult due both to disfluencies and subtle er-
rors with important changes in meaning.

The Pearson correlation between the gold MT
quality scores and the gold STS scores is 0.41,
which shows that translation quality measures and
STS are only moderately correlated. Differences
are in part explained by translation quality scores
penalizing all mismatches between the source seg-
ment and its translation, whereas STS focuses on
differences in meaning. However, the difficult in-
terpretation work required for STS annotation may

21The evaluation data for track 4b does in fact have STS
scores that are≥ 1 for all pairs. In the 1,000 sentence training
set for this track, one sentence that received a score of zero.

increase the risk of inconsistent and subjective la-
bels. The annotations for MT quality estimation
are produced as by-product of post-editing. Hu-
mans fix MT output and the edit distance between
the output and its post-edited correction provides
the quality score. This post-editing based proce-
dure is known to produce relatively consistent esti-
mates across annotators.

8 STS Benchmark

The STS Benchmark is a careful selection of the
English data sets used in SemEval and *SEM STS
shared tasks between 2012 and 2017. Tables 11
and 13 provide details on the composition of the
benchmark. The data is partitioned into training,

development and test sets.22 The development set
can be used to design new models and tune hy-
perparameters. The test set should be used spar-
ingly and only after a model design and hyperpa-
rameters have been locked against further changes.
Using the STS Benchmark enables comparable as-
sessments across different research efforts and im-
proved tracking of the state-of-the-art.

Table 14 shows the STS Benchmark results for
some of the best systems from Track 5 (EN-EN)23

and compares their performance to competitive
baselines from the literature. All baselines were
run by the organizers using canonical pre-trained
models made available by the originator of each
method,24 with the exception of PV-DBOW that

22Similar to the STS shared task, while the training set
is provided as a convenience, researchers are encourage to
incorporate other supervised and unsupervised data as long as
no supervised annotations of the test partitions are used.

23Each participant submitted the run which did best in the
development set of the STS Benchmark, which happened to
be the same as their best run in Track 5 in all cases.

9 Conclusion
We have presented the results of the 2017 STS
shared task. This year’s shared task differed sub-
stantially from previous iterations of STS in that
the primary emphasis of the task shifted from
English to multilingual and cross-lingual STS in-
volving four different languages: Arabic, Spanish,
English and Turkish. Even with this substantial
change relative to prior evaluations, the shared task
obtained strong participation. 31 teams produced
84 system submissions with 17 teams producing
a total of 44 system submissions that processed
pairs in all of the STS 2017 languages. For lan-
guages that were part of prior STS evaluations

Text, to our knownledge, the preprocessing for the pre-trained
Word2vec embeddings is not publicly described. We use the
following heuristics for the Word2vec experiment: All num-
bers longer than a single digit are converted into a ‘#’ (e.g.,
24→ ##) then prefixed, suffixed and infixed punctuation is
recursively removed from each token that does not match an
entry in the model’s lexicon.

(e.g., English and Spanish), state-of-the-art sys-
tems are able to achieve strong correlations with
human judgment. However, we obtain weaker
correlations from participating systems for Ara-
bic, Arabic-English and Turkish-English. This
suggests further research is necessary in order to
develop robust models that can both be readily
applied to new languages and perform well even
when less supervised training data is available. To
provide a standard benchmark for English STS, we
present the STS Benchmark, a careful selection
of the English data sets from previous STS tasks
(2012-2017). To assist in interpreting the results
from new models, a number of competitive base-
lines and select participant systems are evaluated
on the benchmark data. Ongoing improvements
to the current state-of-the-art is available from an
online leaderboard.
