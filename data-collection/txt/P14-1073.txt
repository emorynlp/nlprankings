Abstract

Entity clustering must determine when two
named-entity mentions refer to the same
entity. Typical approaches use a pipeline ar-
chitecture that clusters the mentions using
fixed or learned measures of name and con-
text similarity. In this paper, we propose a
model for cross-document coreference res-
olution that achieves robustness by learn-
ing similarity from unlabeled data. The
generative process assumes that each entity
mention arises from copying and option-
ally mutating an earlier name from a sim-
ilar context. Clustering the mentions into
entities depends on recovering this copying
tree jointly with estimating models of the
mutation process and parent selection pro-
cess. We present a block Gibbs sampler for
posterior inference and an empirical evalu-
ation on several datasets.

1 Introduction

Variation poses a serious challenge for determin-
ing who or what a name refers to. For instance,
Wikipedia contains more than 100 variations of the
name Barack Obama as redirects to the U.S. Presi-
dent article, including:

President Obama Barack H. Obama, Jr.
Barak Obamba Barry Soetoro

To relate different names, one solution is to use
specifically tailored measures of name similarity
such as Jaro-Winkler similarity (Winkler, 1999; Co-
hen et al., 2003). This approach is brittle, however,
and fails to adapt to the test data. Another option is
to train a model like stochastic edit distance from
known pairs of similar names (Ristad and Yian-
ilos, 1998; Green et al., 2012), but this requires
supervised data in the test domain.

Even the best model of name similarity is not
enough by itself, since two names that are similar—

even identical—do not necessarily corefer. Docu-
ment context is needed to determine whether they
may be talking about two different people.

In this paper, we propose a method for jointly
(1) learning similarity between names and (2) clus-
tering name mentions into entities, the two major
components of cross-document coreference reso-
lution systems (Baron and Freedman, 2008; Finin
et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2011;
Lee et al., 2012; Green et al., 2012). Our model
is an evolutionary generative process based on the
name variation model of Andrews et al. (2012),
which stipulates that names are often copied from
previously generated names, perhaps with mutation
(spelling edits). This can deduce that rather than
being names for different entities, Barak Obamba
and Barock obama more likely arose from the fre-
quent name Barack Obama as a common ancestor,
which accounts for most of their letters. This can
also relate seemingly dissimilar names via multiple
steps in the generative process:

Taylor Swift→ T-Swift→ T-Swizzle
Our model learns without supervision that these all
refer to the the same entity. Such creative spellings
are especially common on Twitter and other so-
cial media; we give more examples of coreferents
learned by our model in Section 8.4.

Our primary contributions are improvements on
Andrews et al. (2012) for the entity clustering task.
Their inference procedure only clustered types (dis-
tinct names) rather than tokens (mentions in con-
text), and relied on expensive matrix inversions for
learning. Our novel approach features:
§4.1 A topical model of which entities from previ-

ously written text an author tends to mention
from previously written text.

§4.2 A name mutation model that is sensitive to
features of the input and output characters and
takes a reader’s comprehension into account.

§5 A scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo sam-
pler used in training and inference.

§7 A minimum Bayes risk decoding procedure
to pick an output clustering. The procedure is
applicable to any model capable of producing
a posterior over coreference decisions.

We evaluate our approach by comparing to sev-
eral baselines on datasets from three different gen-
res: Twitter, newswire, and blogs.

2 Overview and Related Work

Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR)
was first introduced by Bagga and Baldwin (1998b).
Most approaches since then are based on the intu-
itions that coreferent names tend to have “similar”
spellings and tend to appear in “similar” contexts.
The distinguishing feature of our system is that both
notions of similarity are learned together without
supervision.

We adopt a “phylogenetic” generative model of
coreference. The basic insight is that coreference is
created when an author thinks of an entity that was
mentioned earlier in a similar context, and men-
tions it again in a similar way. The author may
alter the name mention string when copying it, but
both names refer to the same entity. Either name
may later be copied further, leading to an evolution-
ary tree of mentions—a phylogeny. Phylogenetic
models are new to information extraction. In com-
putational historical linguistics, Bouchard-Côté et
al. (2013) have also modeled the mutation of strings
along the edges of a phylogeny; but for them the
phylogeny is observed and most mentions are not,
while we observe the mentions only.

To apply our model to the CDCR task, we ob-
serve that the probability that two name mentions
are coreferent is the probability that they arose from
a common ancestor in the phylogeny. So we design
a Monte Carlo sampler to reconstruct likely phylo-
genies. A phylogeny must explain every observed
name. While our model is capable of generating
each name independently, a phylogeny will gener-
ally achieve higher probability if it explains similar
names as being similar by mutation (rather than
by coincidence). Thus, our sampled phylogenies
tend to make similar names coreferent—especially
long or unusual names that would be expensive to
generate repeatedly, and especially in contexts that
are topically similar and therefore have a higher
prior probability of coreference.

For learning, we iteratively adjust our model’s
parameters to better explain our samples. That is,
we do unsupervised training via Monte Carlo EM.

What is learned? An important component of
a CDCR system is its model of name similarity
(Winkler, 1999; Porter and Winkler, 1997), which
is often fixed up front. This role is played in our sys-
tem by the name mutation model, which we take to
be a variant of stochastic edit distance (Ristad and
Yianilos, 1996). Rather than fixing its parameters
before we begin CDCR, we learn them (without
supervision) as part of CDCR, by training from
samples of reconstructed phylogenies.

Name similarity is also an important component
of within-document coreference resolution, and ef-
forts in that area bear resemblance to our approach.
Haghighi and Klein (2010) describe an “entity-
centered” model where a distance-dependent Chi-
nese restaurant process is used to pick previous
coreferent mentions within a document. Similarly,
Durrett and Klein (2013) learn a mention similarity
model based on labeled data. Our cross-document
setting has no observed mention ordering and no
observed entities: we must sum over all possibili-
ties, a challenging inference problem.

The second major component of CDCR is
context-based disambiguation of similar or iden-
tical names that refer to the same entity. Like
Kozareva and Ravi (2011) and Green et al. (2012)
we use topics as the contexts, but learn mention
topics jointly with other model parameters.

3 Generative Model of Coreference

Let x = (x1, . . . , xN ) denote an ordered sequence
of distinct named-entity mentions in documents
d = (d1, . . . , dD). We assume that each doc-
ument has a (single) known language, and that
its mentions and their types have been identified
by a named-entity recognizer. We use the object-
oriented notation x.v for attribute v of mention x.

Our model generates an ordered sequence x al-
though we do not observe its order. Thus each men-
tion x has latent position x.i (e.g., x729.i = 729).
The entire corpus, including these entities, is gen-
erated according to standard topic model assump-
tions; we first generate a topic distribution for a
document, then sample topics and words for the
document (Blei et al., 2003). However, any topic
may generate an entity type, e.g. PERSON, which is
then replaced by a specific name: when PERSON is
generated, the model chooses a previous mention
of any person and copies it, perhaps mutating its
name.1 Alternatively, the model may manufacture

1We make the closed-world assumption that the author is

776



a name for a new person, though the name itself
may not be new.

If all previous mentions were equally likely, this
would be a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) in
which frequently mentioned entities are more likely
to be mentioned again (“the rich get richer”). We
refine that idea by saying that the current topic, lan-
guage, and document influence the choice of which
previous mention to copy, similar to the distance-
dependent CRP (Blei and Frazier, 2011).2 This will
help distinguish multiple John Smith entities if they
tend to appear in different contexts.

Formally, each mention x is derived from a par-
ent mention x.p where x.p.i < x.i (the parent
came first), x.e = x.p.e (same entity) and x.n is
a copy or mutation of x.p.n. In the special case
where x is a first mention of x.e, x.p is the special
symbol ♦, x.e is a newly allocated entity of some
appropriate type, and the name x.n is generated
from scratch.

Our goal is to reconstruct mappings p, i, z that
specify the latent properties of the mentions x. The
mapping p : x 7→ x.p forms a phylogenetic tree on
the mentions, with root♦. Each entity corresponds
to a subtree that is rooted at some child of ♦. The
mapping i : x 7→ x.i gives an ordering consistent
with that tree in the sense that (∀x)x.p.i < x.i.
Finally, the mapping z : x 7→ x.z specifies, for
each mention, the topic that generated it. While i
and z are not necessary for creating coref clusters,
they are needed to produce p.

4 Detailed generative story

Given a few constants that are referenced in the
main text, we assume that the corpus d was gener-
ated as follows.

First, for each topic z = 1, . . .K and each lan-
guage `, choose a multinomial βz` over the word
vocabulary, from a symmetric Dirichlet with con-
centration parameter η. Then set m = 0 (entity

only aware of previous mentions from our corpus. This means
that two mentions cannot be derived from a common ancestor
outside our corpus. To mitigate this unrealistic assumption, we
allow any ordering x of the observed mentions, not respecting
document timestamps or forcing the mentions from a given
document to be generated as a contiguous subsequence of x.

2Unlike the ddCRP, our generative story is careful to pro-
hibit derivational cycles: each mention is copied from a previ-
ous mention in the latent ordering. This is why our phylogeny
is a tree, and why our sampler is more complex. Also unlike
the ddCRP, we permit asymmetric “distances”: if a certain
topic or language likes to copy mentions from another, the
compliment is not necessarily returned.

count), i = 0 (mention count), and for each docu-
ment index d = 1, . . . , D:

1. Choose the document’s length L and language
`. (The distributions used to choose these
are unimportant because these variables are
always observed.)

2. Choose its topic distribution ψd from an
asymmetric Dirichlet prior with parameters
m (Wallach et al., 2009).3

3. For each token position k = 1, . . . , L:

(a) Choose a topic zdk ∼ ψd.
(b) Choose a word conditioned on the topic

and language, wdk ∼ βzdk`.
(c) If wdk is a named entity type (PERSON,

PLACE, ORG, . . . ) rather than an ordinary
word, then increment i and:

i. create a new mention x with
x.e.t = wdk x.d = d x.` = `
x.i = i x.z = zdk x.k = k

ii. Choose the parent x.p from a distri-
bution conditioned on the attributes
just set (see §4.1).

iii. If x.p = ♦, increment m and set
x.e = a new entity em. Else set
x.e = x.p.e.

iv. Choose x.n from a distribution con-
ditioned on x.p.n and x.` (see §4.2).

Notice that the tokens wdk in document d are
exchangeable: by collapsing out ψd, we can re-
gard them as having been generated from a CRP.
Thus, for fixed values of the non-mention tokens
and their topics, the probability of generating the
mention sequence x is proportional to the prod-
uct of the probabilities of the choices in step 3 at
the positions dk where mentions were generated.
These choices generate a topic x.z (from the CRP
for document d), a type x.e.t (from βx.z), a par-
ent mention (from the distribution over previous
mentions), and a name string (conditioned on the
parent’s name if any). §5 uses this fact to construct
an MCMC sampler for the latent parts of x.

4.1 Sub-model for parent selection
To select a parent for a mention x of type t = x.e.t,
a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a
CRP: each previous mention of the same type is
selected with probability proportional to 1, and♦ is

3Extension: This choice could depend on the language d.`.

777



selected with probability proportional to αt > 0. A
larger choice of αt results in smaller entity clusters,
because it prefers to create new entities of type t
rather than copying old ones.

We modify this story by re-weighting ♦ and
previous mentions according to their relative suit-
ability as the parent of x:

Prφ(x.p | x) = exp (φ · f(x.p, x))
Z(x)

(1)

where x.p ranges over ♦ and all previous mentions
of the same type as x, that is, mentions p such that
p.i < x.i and p.e.t = x.e.t. The normalizing con-
stant Z(x) def=

∑
p exp (φ · f(x.p, x)) is chosen

so that the probabilities sum to 1.
This is a conditional log-linear model parameter-

ized by φ, where φk ∼ N (0, σ2k). The features f
are extracted from the attributes of x and x.p. Our
most important feature tests whether x.p.z = x.z.
This binary feature has a high weight if authors
mainly choose mentions from the same topic. To
model which (other) topics tend to be selected, we
also have a binary feature for each parent topic
x.p.z and each topic pair (x.p.z, x.z).4

4.2 Sub-model for name mutation
Let x denote a mention with parent p = x.p. As in
Andrews et al. (2012), its name x.n is a stochastic
transduction of its parent’s name p.n. That is,

Prθ(x.n | p.n) (2)

is given by the probability that applying a random
sequence of edits to the characters of p.n would
yield x.n. The contextual probabilities of different
edits depend on learned parameters θ.

(2) is the total probability of all edit sequences
that derive x.n from p.n. It can be computed in
time O(|x.n| · |p.n|) by dynamic programming.

The probability of a single edit sequence, which
corresponds to a monotonic alignment of x.n to
p.n, is a product of individual edit probabilities of
the form Prθ((ab) | â), which is conditioned on the
next input character â. The edit (ab) replaces input
a ∈ {�, â} with output b ∈ {�} ∪ Σ (where � is

4Many other features could be added. In a multilingual
setting, one would similarly want to model whether English
authors select Arabic mentions. One could also imagine fea-
tures that reward proximity in the generative order (x.p.i ≈
x.i), local linguistic relationships (when x.p.d = x.d and
x.p.k ≈ x.k), or social information flow (e.g., from main-
stream media to Twitter). One could also make more specific
versions of any feature by conjoining it with the entity type t.

the empty string and Σ is the alphabet of language
x.`). Insertions and deletions are the cases where
respectively a = � or b = �—we do not allow both
at once. All other edits are substitutions. When
â is the special end-of-string symbol #, the only
allowed edits are the insertion (�b) and the substi-
tution (##). We define the edit probability using a
locally normalized log-linear model:

Prθ((ab) | â) =
exp(θ · f(â, a, b))∑

a′,b′ exp(θ · f(â, a′, b′))
(3)

We use a small set of simple feature functions f ,
which consider conjunctions of the attributes of the
characters â and b: character, character class (letter,
digit, etc.), and case (upper vs. lower).

More generally, the probability (2) may also be
conditioned on other variables such as on the lan-
guages p.` and x.`—this leaves room for a translit-
eration model when x.` 6= p.`—and on the entity
type x.t. The features in (3) may then depend on
these variables as well.

Notice that we use a locally normalized proba-
bility for each edit. This enables faster and sim-
pler training than the similar model of Dreyer et al.
(2008), which uses a globally normalized probabil-
ity for the whole edit sequence.

When p = ♦, we are generating a new name x.n.
We use the same model, taking♦.n to be the empty
string (but with #♦ rather than # as the end-of-
string symbol). This yields a feature-based unigram
language model (whose character probabilities may
differ from usual insertion probabilities because
they see #♦ as the lookahead character).

Pragmatics. We can optionally make the model
more sophisticated. Authors tend to avoid names
x.n that readers would misinterpret (given the pre-
viously generated names). The edit model thinks
that Prθ(CIA | ♦) is relatively high (because CIA is
a short string) and so is Prθ(CIA | Chuck’s Ice Art).
But in fact, if CIA has already been frequently used
to refer to the Central Intelligence Agency, then an
author is unlikely to use it for a different entity.

To model this pragmatic effect, we multiply
our definition of Prθ(x.n | p.n) by an extra fac-
tor Pr(x.e | x)γ , where γ ≥ 0 is the effect
strength.5 Here Pr(x.e | x) is the probability that
a reader correctly identifies the entity x.e. We
take this to be the probability that a reader who
knows our sub-models would guess some parent

model. Our training procedure also ignores the extra factor.

having the correct entity (or ♦ if x is a first men-
tion):

∑
p′:p′.e=x.ew(p

′, x)/
∑

p′ w(p
′, x). Here p′

ranges over mentions (including ♦) that precede
x in the ordering i, and w(p′, x)—defined later in
sec. 5.3—is proportional to the posterior probabil-
ity that x.p = p′, given name x.n and topic x.z.6

5 Inference by Block Gibbs Sampling

We use a block Gibbs sampler, which from an ini-
tial state (p0, i0, z0) repeats these steps:

1. Sample the ordering i from its conditional
distribution given all other variables.

2. Sample the topic vector z likewise.
3. Sample the phylogeny p likewise.
4. Output the current sample st = (p, i, z).

It is difficult to draw exact samples at steps 1
and 2. Thus, we sample i or z from a simpler
proposal distribution, but correct the discrepancy
using the Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH)
strategy: with an appropriate probability, reject the
proposed new value and instead use another copy
of the current value (Tierney, 1994).

5.1 Resampling the ordering i

We resample the ordering i of the mentions x,
conditioned on the other variables. The current
phylogeny p already defines a partial order on x,
since each parent must precede its children. For
instance, phylogeny (a) below requires ♦ ≺ x and
♦ ≺ y. This partial order is compatible with 2
total orderings, ♦ ≺ x ≺ y and ♦ ≺ y ≺ x. By
contrast, phylogeny (b) requires the total ordering
♦ ≺ x ≺ y.

♦

yx

(a)

♦

x

y

(b)

We first sample an ordering i♦ (the ordering
of mentions with parent ♦, i.e. all mentions) uni-
formly at random from the set of orderings compat-
ible with the current p. (We provide details about
this procedure in Appendix A.)7 However, such or-
derings are not in fact equiprobable given the other
variables—some orderings better explain why that
phylogeny was chosen in the first place, according

6Better, one could integrate over the reader’s guess of x.z.

to our competitive parent selection model (§4.1).
To correct for this bias using IMH, we accept the
proposed ordering i♦ with probability

a = min
(

1,
Pr(p, i♦, z,x | θ,φ)
Pr(p, i, z,x | θ,φ)

)
(4)

where i is the current ordering. Otherwise we reject
i♦ and reuse i for the new sample.

5.2 Resampling the topics z
Each context word and each named entity is asso-
ciated with a latent topic. The topics of context
words are assumed exchangeable, and so we re-
sample them using Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and
Steyvers, 2004).

Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive for
the (non-exchangeable) topics of the named men-
tions x. A Gibbs sampler would have to choose
a new value for x.z with probability proportional
to the resulting joint probability of the full sample.
This probability is expensive to evaluate because
changing x.z will change the probability of many
edges in the current phylogeny p. (Equation (1)
puts x is in competition with other parents, so ev-
ery mention y that follows x must recompute how
happy it is with its current parent y.p.)

Rather than resampling one topic at a time, we re-
sample z as a block. We use a proposal distribution
for which block sampling is efficient, and use IMH
to correct the error in this proposal distribution.

Our proposal distribution is an undirected graph-
ical model whose random variables are the topics
z and whose graph structure is given by the current
phylogeny p:

Q(z) ∝
∏
x 6=♦

Ψx(x.z)Ψx.p,x(x.p.z, x.z) (5)

Q(z) is an approximation to the posterior distri-
bution over z. As detailed below, a proposal can
be sampled from Q(z) in time O(|z|K2) where K
is the number of topics, because the only interac-
tions among topics are along the edges of the tree
p. The unary factor Ψx gives a weight for each
possible value of x.z, and the binary factor Ψx.p,x
gives a weight for each possible value of the pair
(x.p.z, x.z).

The Ψx(x.z) factors in (5) approximate the topic
model’s prior distribution over z. Ψx(x.z) is pro-
portional to the probability that a Gibbs sampling
step for an ordinary topic model would choose this
value of x.z. This depends on whether—in the

779



current sample—x.z is currently common in x’s
document and x.t is commonly generated by x.z.
It ignores the fact that we will also be resampling
the topics of the other mentions.

The Ψx.p,x factors in (5) approximate Pr(p |
z, i) (up to a constant factor), where p is the current
phylogeny. Specifically, Ψx.p,x approximates the
probability of a single edge. It ought to be given
by (1), but we use only the numerator of (1), which
avoids modeling the competition among parents.

We sample from Q using standard methods, sim-
ilar to sampling from a linear-chain CRF by run-
ning the backward algorithm followed by forward
sampling. Specifically, we run the sum-product
algorithm from the leaves up to the root ♦, at each
node x computing the following for each topic z:

βx(z)
def= Ψx(z) ·

∏
y∈children(x)

∑
z′

Ψx,y(z, z′) · βy(z′)

Then we sample from the root down to the leaves,
first sampling ♦.z from β♦, then at each x 6= ♦
sampling the topic x.z to be z with probability
proportional to Ψx.p,x(x.p.z, z) · βx(z).

Again we use IMH to correct for the bias in Q:
we accept the resulting proposal ẑ with probability

min
(

1,
Pr(p, i, ẑ,x | θ,φ)
Pr(p, i, z,x | θ,φ) ·

Q(z)
Q(ẑ)

)
(6)

While Pr(p, i, ẑ,x | θ,φ) might seem slow to
compute because it contains many factors (1) with
different denominators Z(x), one can share work
by visiting the mentions x in their order i. Most
summands in Z(x) were already included in Z(x′),
where x′ is the latest previous mention having the
same attributes as x (e.g., same topic).

5.3 Resampling the phylogeny p
It is easy to resample the phylogeny. For each x, we
must choose a parent x.p from among the possible
parents p (having p.i < x.i and p.e.t = x.e.t).
Since the ordering i prevents cycles, the resulting
phylogeny p is indeed a tree.

Given the topics z, the ordering i, and the ob-
served names, we choose an x.p value according
to its posterior probability. This is proportional to
w(x.p, x) def= Prφ(x.p | x) · Prθ(x.n | x.p.n),
independent of any other mention’s choice of par-
ent. The two factors here are given by (1) and (2)
respectively. As in the previous section, the de-
nominators Z(x) in the Pr(x.p | x) factors can be
computed efficiently with shared work.

With the pragmatic model (section 4.2), the par-
ent choices are no longer independent; then the
samples of p should be corrected by IMH as usual.

5.4 Initializing the sampler

The initial sampler state (z0,p0, i0) is obtained as
follows. (1) We fix topics z0 via collapsed Gibbs
sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). The sam-
pler is run for 1000 iterations, and the final sam-
pler state is taken to be z0. This process treats all
topics as exchangeable, including those associated
with named entities.(2) Given the topic assignment
z0, initialize p0 to the phylogeny rooted at ♦ that
maximizes

∑
x logw(x.p, x). This is a maximum

rooted directed spanning tree problem that can be
solved in time O(n2) (Tarjan, 1977). The weight
w(x.p, x) is defined as in section 5.3—except that
since we do not yet have an ordering i, we do not
restrict the possible values of x.p to mentions p
with p.i < x.p.i. (3) Given p0, sample an ordering
i0 using the procedure described in §5.1.

6 Parameter Estimation

Evaluating the likelihood and its partial derivatives
with respect to the parameters of the model requires
marginalizing over our latent variables. As this
marginalization is intractable, we resort to Monte
Carlo EM procedure (Levine and Casella, 2001)
which iterates the following two steps:
E-step: Collect samples by MCMC simulation as
in §5, given current model parameters θ and φ.
M-step: Improve θ and φ to increase8

L def= 1
S

S∑
s=1

log Prθ,φ(x,ps, is, zs) (7)

It is not necessary to locally maximize L at each
M-step, merely to improve it if it is not already
at a local maximum (Dempster et al., 1977). We
improve it by a single update: at the tth M-step, we
update our parameters to Φt = (θt,φt)

Φt = Φt−1 + εΣt∇ΦL(x,Φt−1) (8)

where ε is a fixed scaling term and Σt is an adap-
tive learning rate given by AdaGrad (Duchi et al.,
2011).

We now describe how to compute the gradient
∇ΦL. The gradient with respect to the parent se-

the log-likelihoods of θ and φ under a Gaussian prior.

Prφ(p′ | x)f(p′, x)
 (9)

The outer summation ranges over all edges in the
S samples. The other variables in (9) are associ-
ated with the edge being summed over. That edge
explains a mention x as a mutation of some parent
p in the context of a particular sample (ps, is, zs).
The possible parents p′ range over ♦ and the men-
tions that precede x according to the ordering is,
while the features f and distribution Prφ depend
on the topics zs.

As for the mutation parameters, let cp,x be the
fraction of samples in which p is the parent of x.
This is the expected number of times that the string
p.n mutated into x.n. Given this weighted set of
string pairs, let câ,a,b be the expected number of
times that edit (ab) was chosen in context â: this
can be computed using dynamic programming to
marginalize over the latent edit sequence that maps
p.n to x.n, for each (p, x). The gradient of L with
respect to θ is∑

7 Consensus Clustering

From a single phylogeny p, we deterministically
obtain a clustering e by removing the root ♦. Each
of the resulting connected components corresponds
to a cluster of mentions. Our model gives a distribu-
tion over phylogenies p (given observations x and
learned parameters Φ)—and thus gives a posterior
distribution over clusterings e, which can be used
to answer various queries.

A traditional query is to request a single cluster-
ing e. We prefer the clustering e∗ that minimizes
Bayes risk (MBR) (Bickel and Doksum, 1977):

e∗ = argmin
e′

∑
e

L(e′, e) Pr(e | x,θ,φ) (11)

This minimizes our expected loss, where L(e′, e)
denotes the loss associated with picking e′ when
the true clustering is e. In practice, we again esti-
mate the expectation by sampling e values.

The Rand index (Rand, 1971)—unlike our actual
evaluation measure—is an efficient choice of loss

function L for use with (11):

R(e′, e) def=
TP + TN

TP + FP + TN + FN
=

TP + TN(
N
2

)
where the true positives (TP), true negatives (TN),
false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) use
the clustering e to evaluate how well e′ classi-
fies the

(
N
2

)
mention pairs as coreferent or not.

More similar clusterings achieve larger R, with
R(e′, e) = 1 iff e′ = e. In all cases, 0 ≤
R(e′, e) = R(e, e′) ≤ 1.

The MBR decision rule for the (negated) Rand
index is easily seen to be equivalent to

e∗ = argmax
e′

E[TP] + E[TN] (12)

= argmax
e′

∑
i,j: xi∼xj

sij +
∑

i,j: xi 6∼xj
(1− sij)

where ∼ denotes coreference according to e′. As
explained above, the sij are coreference probabil-
ities sij that can be estimated from a sample of
clusterings e.

This objective corresponds to min-max graph
cut (Ding et al., 2001), an NP-hard problem with
an approximate solution (Nie et al., 2010).9

8 Experiments

In this section, we describe experiments on three
different datasets. Our main results are described
first: Twitter features many instances of name vari-
ation that we would like our model to be able to
learn. We also report the performance of different
ablations of our full approach, in order to see which
consistently helped across the different splits. We
report additional experiments on the ACE 2008 cor-
pus, and on a political blog corpus, to demonstrate
that our approach is applicable in different settings.

For Twitter and ACE 2008, we report the stan-
dard B3 metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998a). For
the political blog dataset, the reference does not
consist of entity annotations, and so we follow the
evaluation procedure of Yogatama et al. (2012).

8.1 Twitter
Data. We use a novel corpus of Twitter posts dis-
cussing the 2013 Grammy Award ceremony. This
is a challenging corpus, featuring many instances

9In our experiments, we run the clustering algorithm five
times, initialized from samples chosen at random from the last
10% of the sampler run, and keep the clustering that achieved
highest expected Rand score.

of name variation. The dataset consists of five splits
(by entity), the smallest of which is 604 mentions
and the largest is 1374. We reserve the largest split
for development purposes, and report our results
on the remaining four. Appendix B provides more
detail about the dataset.

Baselines. We use the discriminative entity cluster-
ing algorithm of Green et al. (2012) as our baseline;
their approach was found to outperform another
generative model which produced a flat cluster-
ing of mentions via a Dirichlet process mixture
model. Their method uses Jaro-Winkler string sim-
ilarity to match names, then clusters mentions with
matching names (for disambiguation) by compar-
ing their unigram context distributions using the
Jenson-Shannon metric. We also compare to the
EXACT-MATCH baseline, which assigns all strings
with the same name to the same entity.

Procedure. We run four test experiments in which
one split is used to pick model hyperparameters
and the remaining three are used for test. For the
discriminative baseline, we tune the string match
threshold, context threshold, and the weight of the
context model prior (all via grid search). For our
model, we tune only the fixed weight of the root
feature, which determines the precision/recall trade-
off (larger values of this feature result in more
attachments to ♦ and hence more entities). We
leave other hyperparameters fixed: 16 latent top-
ics, and Gaussian priors N (0, 1) on all log-linear
parameters. For PHYLO, the entity clustering is
the result of (1) training the model using EM, (2)
sampling from the posterior to obtain a distribu-
tion over clusterings, and (3) finding a consensus
clustering. We use 20 iterations of EM with 100
samples per E-step for training, and use 1000 sam-
ples after training to estimate the posterior. We
report results using three variations of our model:
PHYLO does not consider mention context (all men-
tions effectively have the same topic) and deter-
mines mention entities from a single sample of
p (the last); PHYLO+TOPIC adds context (§5.2);
PHYLO+TOPIC+MBR uses the full posterior and
consensus clustering to pick the output clustering
(§7). Our results are shown in Table 1.10

10Our single-threaded implementation took around 15 min-
utes per fold of the Twitter corpus on a personal laptop with
a 2.3 Ghz Intel Core i7 processor (including time required to
parse the data files). Typical acceptance rates for ordering and
topic proposals ranged from 0.03 to 0.08.

8.2 Newswire

Data. We use the ACE 2008 dataset, which is
described in detail in Green et al. (2012). It is
split into a development portion and a test portion.
The baseline system took the first mention from
each (gold) within-document coreference chain as
the canonical mention, ignoring other mentions in
the chain; we follow the same procedure in our
experiments.11

Baselines & Procedure. We use the same base-
lines as in §8.1. On development data, modeling
pragmatics as in §4.2 gave large improvements for
organizations (8 points in F-measure), correcting
the tendency to assume that short names like CIA
were coincidental homonyms. Hence we allowed
γ > 0 and tuned it on development data.12 Results
are in Table 2.

8.3 Blogs

Data. The CMU political blogs dataset consists of
3000 documents about U.S. politics (Yano et al.,
2009). Preprocessed as described in Yogatama et al.
(2012), the data consists of 10647 entity mentions.

11That is, each within-document coreference chain is
mapped to a single mention as a preprocessing step.

12We used only a simplified version of the pragmatic model,
approximating w(p′, x) as 1 or 0 according to whether p′.n =
x.n. We also omitted the IMH step from section 5.3. The
other results we report do not use pragmatics at all, since we
found that it gave only a slight improvement on Twitter.

782



Unlike our other datasets, mentions are not anno-
tated with entities: the reference consists of a table
of 126 entities, where each row is the canonical
name of one entity.

Baselines. We compare to the system results
reported in Figure 2 of Yogatama et al. (2012).
This includes a baseline hierarchical clustering ap-
proach, the “EEA” name canonicalization system
of Eisenstein et al. (2011), as well the model pro-
posed by Yogatama et al. (2012). Like the output
of our model, the output of their hierarchical clus-
tering baseline is a mention clustering, and there-
fore must be mapped to a table of canonical entity
names to compare to the reference table.

Procedure & Results We tune our method as in
previous experiments, on the initialization data
used by Yogatama et al. (2012) which consists of
a subset of 700 documents of the full dataset. The
tuned model then produced a mention clustering
on the full political blog corpus. As the mapping
from clusters to a table is not fully detailed in Yo-
gatama et al. (2012), we used a simple heuristic:
the most frequent name in each cluster is taken as
the canonical name, augmented by any titles from
a predefined list appearing in any other name in
the cluster. The resulting table is then evaluated
against the reference, as described in Yogatama et
al. (2012). We achieved a response score of 0.17
and a reference score of 0.61. Though not state-of-
the-art, this result is close to the score of the “EEA”
system of Eisenstein et al. (2011), as reported in
Figure 2 of Yogatama et al. (2012), which is specif-
ically designed for the task of canonicalization.

8.4 Discussion
On the Twitter dataset, we obtained a 12.6-point F1
improvement over the baseline. To understand our
model’s behavior, we looked at the sampled phy-
logenetic trees on development data. One reason
our model does well in this noisy domain is that
it is able to relate seemingly dissimilar names via
successive steps. For instance, our model learned
to relate many variations of LL Cool J:

Cool James LLCoJ El-El Cool John
LL LL COOL JAMES LLCOOLJ

In the sample we inspected, these mentions were
also assigned the same topic, further boosting the
probability of the configuration.

The ACE dataset, consisting of editorialized
newswire, naturally contains less name variation
than Twitter data. Nonetheless, we find that the

variation that does appear is often properly handled
by our model. For instance, we see several in-
stances of variation due to transliteration that were
all correctly grouped together, such as Megawati
Soekarnoputri and Megawati Sukarnoputri. The prag-
matic model was also effective in grouping com-
mon acronyms into the same entity.

We found that multiple samples tend to give dif-
ferent phylogenies (so the sampler is mobile), but
essentially the same clustering into entities (which
is why consensus clustering did not improve much
over simply using the last sample). Random restarts
of EM might create more variety by choosing dif-
ferent locally optimal parameter settings. It may
also be beneficial to explore other sampling tech-
niques (Bouchard-Côté, 2014).

Our method assembles observed names into an
evolutionary tree. However, the true tree must in-
clude many names that fall outside our small ob-
served corpora, so our model would be a more
appropriate fit for a far larger corpus. Larger cor-
pora also offer stronger signals that might enable
our Monte Carlo methods to mix faster and detect
regularities more accurately.

A common error of our system is to connect
mentions that share long substrings, such as dif-
ferent PERSONs who share a last name, or differ-
ent ORGANIZATIONs that contain University of. A
more powerful name mutation than the one we use
here would recognize entire words, for example
inserting a common title or replacing a first name
with its common nickname. Modeling the internal
structure of names (Johnson, 2010; Eisenstein et
al., 2011; Yogatama et al., 2012) in the mutation
model is a promising future direction.

9 Conclusions

Our primary contribution consists of new model-
ing ideas, and associated inference techniques, for
the problem of cross-document coreference resolu-
tion. We have described how writers systematically
plunder (φ) and then systematically modify (θ) the
work of past writers. Inference under such models
could also play a role in tracking evolving memes
and social influence, not merely in establishing
strict coreference. Our model also provides an al-
ternative to the distance-dependent CRP.2

search use at: https://bitbucket.org/
