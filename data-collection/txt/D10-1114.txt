Abstract

We introduce tiered clustering, a mixture
model capable of accounting for varying de-
grees of shared (context-independent) fea-
ture structure, and demonstrate its applicabil-
ity to inferring distributed representations of
word meaning. Common tasks in lexical se-
mantics such as word relatedness or selec-
tional preference can benefit from modeling
such structure: Polysemous word usage is of-
ten governed by some common background
metaphoric usage (e.g. the senses of line or
run), and likewise modeling the selectional
preference of verbs relies on identifying com-
monalities shared by their typical arguments.
Tiered clustering can also be viewed as a form
of soft feature selection, where features that do
not contribute meaningfully to the clustering
can be excluded. We demonstrate the applica-
bility of tiered clustering, highlighting partic-
ular cases where modeling shared structure is
beneficial and where it can be detrimental.

1 Introduction

Word meaning can be represented as high-
dimensional vectors inhabiting a common space
whose dimensions capture semantic or syntactic
properties of interest (e.g. Erk and Pado, 2008;
Lowe, 2001). Such vector-space representations of
meaning induce measures of word similarity that can
be tuned to correlate well with judgements made
by humans. Previous work has focused on de-
signing feature representations and semantic spaces
that capture salient properties of word meaning (e.g.
Curran, 2004; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;
Landauer and Dumais, 1997), often leveraging the
distributional hypothesis, i.e. that similar words ap-

pear in similar contexts (Miller and Charles, 1991;
Pereira et al., 1993).

Since vector-space representations are con-
structed at the lexical level, they conflate multiple
word meanings into the same vector, e.g. collaps-
ing occurrences of bankinstitution and bankriver. Meth-
ods such as Clustering by Committee (Pantel, 2003)
and multi-prototype representations (Reisinger and
Mooney, 2010) address this issue by perform-
ing word-sense disambiguation across word occur-
rences, and then building meaning vectors from
the disambiguated words. Such approaches can
readily capture the structure of homonymous words
with several unrelated meanings (e.g. bat and club),
but are not suitable for representing the common
metaphor structure found in highly polysemous
words such as line or run.

In this paper, we introduce tiered clustering, a
novel probabilistic model of the shared structure
often neglected in clustering problems. Tiered
clustering performs soft feature selection, allocat-
ing features between a Dirichlet Process cluster-
ing model and a background model consisting of
a single component. The background model ac-
counts for features commonly shared by all occur-
rences (i.e. context-independent feature variation),
while the clustering model accounts for variation
in word usage (i.e. context-dependent variation, or
word senses; Table 1).

Using the tiered clustering model, we derive a
multi-prototype representation capable of capturing
varying degrees of sharing between word senses,
and demonstrate its effectiveness in lexical seman-
tic tasks where such sharing is desirable. In partic-
ular we show that tiered clustering outperforms the
multi-prototype approach for (1) selectional prefer-
ence (Resnik, 1997; Pantel et al., 2007), i.e. predict-

1173



ing the typical filler of an argument slot of a verb,
and (2) word-relatedness in the presence of highly
polysemous words. The former case exhibits a high
degree of explicit structure, especially for more se-
lectionally restrictive verbs (e.g. the set of things that
can be eaten or can shoot).

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 gives relevant background on the
methods compared, Section 3 outlines the multi-
prototype model based on the Dirichlet Process mix-
ture model, Section 4 derives the tiered cluster-
ing model, Section 5 discusses similarity metrics,
Section 6 details the experimental setup and in-
cludes a micro-analysis of feature selection, Section
7 presents results applying tiered clustering to word
relatedness and selectional preference, Section 8 dis-
cusses future work, and Section 9 concludes.

2 Background

Models of the attributional similarity of concepts,
i.e. the degree to which concepts overlap based on
their attributes (Turney, 2006), are commonly imple-
mented using vector-spaces derived from (1) word
collocations (Schütze, 1998), directly leveraging the
distributional hypothesis (Miller and Charles, 1991),
(2) syntactic relations (Padó and Lapata, 2007), (3)
structured corpora (e.g. Gabrilovich and Markovitch
(2007)) or (4) latent semantic spaces (Finkelstein
et al., 2001; Landauer and Dumais, 1997). Such
models can be evaluated based on their correlation
with human-reported lexical similarity judgements
using e.g. the WordSim-353 collection (Finkelstein
et al., 2001). Distributional methods exhibit a high
degree of scalability (Gorman and Curran, 2006) and
have been applied broadly in information retrieval
(Manning et al., 2008), large-scale taxonomy induc-
tion (Snow et al., 2006), and knowledge acquisition
(Van Durme and Paşca, 2008).

Reisinger and Mooney (2010) introduced a multi-
prototype approach to vector-space lexical seman-
tics where individual words are represented as col-
lections of “prototype” vectors. This representation
is capable of accounting for homonymy and poly-
semy, as well as other forms of variation in word
usage, like similar context-dependent methods (Erk
and Pado, 2008). The set of vectors for a word
is determined by unsupervised word sense discov-
ery (Schütze, 1998), which clusters the contexts in
which a word appears. Average prototype vectors

Table 1: Example tiered clustering representation of
words with varying degrees of polysemy. Each boxed
set shows the most common background (shared) fea-
tures, and each prototype captures one thematic usage
of the word. For example, wizard is broken up into a
background cluster describing features common to all us-
ages of the word (e.g., magic and evil) and several genre-
specific usages (e.g. Merlin, fairy tales and Harry Potter).

are then computed separately for each cluster, pro-
ducing a distributed representation for each word.

Distributional methods have also proven to be a
powerful approach to modeling selectional prefer-
ence (Padó et al., 2007; Pantel et al., 2007), rivaling
methods based on existing semantic resources such
as WordNet (Clark and Weir, 2002; Resnik, 1997)
and FrameNet (Padó, 2007) and performing nearly
as well as supervised methods (Herdaǧdelen and Ba-
roni, 2009). Selectional preference has been shown
to be useful for, e.g., resolving ambiguous attach-
ments (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), word sense disam-
biguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and seman-
tic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

3 Multi-Prototype Models

Representing words as mixtures over several pro-
totypes has proven to be a powerful approach to

1174



vector-space lexical semantics (Pantel, 2003; Pantel
et al., 2007; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010). In this
section we briefly introduce a version of the multi-
prototype model based on the Dirichlet Process Mix-
ture Model (DPMM), capable of inferring automat-
ically the number of prototypes necessary for each
word (Rasmussen, 2000). Similarity between two
DPMM word-representations is then computed as a
function of their cluster centroids (§5), instead of the
centroid of all the word’s occurrences.

Multiple prototypes for each word w are gener-
ated by clustering feature vectors vpcq derived from
each occurrence c P Cpwq in a large textual cor-
pus and collecting the resulting cluster centroids
πkpwq, k P r1,Kws. This approach is commonly
employed in unsupervised word sense discovery;
however, we do not assume that clusters correspond
to word senses. Rather, we only rely on clusters to
capture meaningful variation in word usage.

Instead of assuming all words can be repre-
sented by the same number of clusters, we allocate
representational flexibility dynamically using the
DPMM. The DPMM is an infinite capacity model
capable of assigning data to a variable, but finite
number of clusters Kw, with probability of assign-
ment to cluster k proportional to the number of data
points previously assigned to k. A single parameter
η controls the degree of smoothing, producing more
uniform clusterings as η Ñ 8. Using this model,
the number of clusters no longer needs to be fixed
a priori, allowing the model to allocate expressivity
dynamically to concepts with richer structure. Such
a model naturally allows the word representation to
allocate additional capacity for highly polysemous
words, with the number of clusters growing loga-
rithmically with the number of occurrences. The
DPMM has been used for rational models of con-
cept organization (Sanborn et al., 2006), but to our
knowledge has not yet been applied directly to lexi-
cal semantics.

4 Tiered Clustering

Tiered clustering allocates features between two
submodels: a (context-dependent) DPMM and a sin-
gle (context-independent) background component.
This model is similar structurally to the feature se-
lective clustering model proposed by Law et al.
(2002). However, instead of allocating entire feature
dimensions between model and background compo-

rant Process.

nents, assignment is done at the level of individual
feature occurrences, much like topic assignment in
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Griffiths et al.,
2007). At a high level, the tiered model can be
viewed as a combination of a multi-prototype model
and a single-prototype back-off model. However,
by leveraging both representations in a joint frame-
work, uninformative features can be removed from
the clustering, resulting in more semantically tight
clusters.

Concretely, each word occurrence wd first selects
a cluster φd from the DPMM; then each feature wi,d
is generated from either the background modelφback
or the selected cluster φd, determined by the tier
indicator zi,d. The full generative model for tiered
clustering is given by

where α controls the per-data tier distribution
smoothing and β controls the uniformity of the DP
cluster allocation. The DP is parameterized by a
base measure G0, controlling the per-cluster term
distribution smoothing; which use a Dirichlet with
hyperparameter η, as is common (Figure 1).

Since the background topic is shared across all oc-
currences, it can account for features with context-
independent variance, such as stop words and other
high-frequency noise, as well as the central tendency
of the collection (Table 1). Furthermore, it is possi-
ble to put an asymmetric prior on η, yielding more
fine-grained control over the assumed uniformity of
the occurrence of noisy features, unlike in the model
proposed by Law et al. (2002).

1175



Although exact posterior inference is intractable
in this model, we derive an efficient collapsed Gibbs
sampler via analogy to LDA (Appendix 1).

5 Measuring Semantic Similarity
Due to its richer representational structure, comput-
ing similarity in the multi-prototype model is less
straightforward than in the single prototype case.
Reisinger and Mooney (2010) found that simply av-
eraging all similarity scores over all pairs of proto-
types (sampled from the cluster distributions) per-
forms reasonably well and is robust to noise. Given
two words w and w1, this AvgSim metric is

AvgSimpw,w1q def�
1

KwKw1

Kw̧

j�1

Kw1¸
k�1

dpπkpwq, πjpw
1qq

Kw andKw1 are the number of clusters for w and w1

respectively, and dp�, �q is a standard distributional
similarity measure (e.g. cosine distance). As cluster
sizes become more uniform, AvgSim tends towards
the single prototype similarity,1 hence the effective-
ness of AvgSim stems from boosting the influence
of small clusters.

Tiered clustering representations offer more pos-
sibilities for computing semantic similarity than
multi-prototype, as the background prototype can be
treated separately from the other prototypes. We
make use of a simple sum of the distance between
the two background components, and the AvgSim
of the two sets of clustering components.

6 Experimental Setup

6.1 Corpus
Word occurrence statistics are collected from a snap-
shot of English Wikipedia taken on Sept. 29th, 2009.
Wikitext markup is removed, as are articles with
fewer than 100 words, leaving 2.8M articles with a
total of 2.05B words. Wikipedia was chosen due to
its semantic breadth.

6.2 Evaluation Methodology
We evaluate the tiered clustering model on two prob-
lems from lexical semantics: word relatedness and
selectional preference. For the word relatedness

1This can be problematic for certain clustering methods
that specify uniform priors over cluster sizes; however the
DPMM naturally exhibits a linear decay in cluster sizes with
the Er# clusters of size M s � η{M .

evaluation, we compared the predicted similarity of
word pairs from each model to two collections of hu-
man similarity judgements: WordSim-353 (Finkel-
stein et al., 2001) and the Princeton Evocation rela-
tions (WN-Evocation, Ma et al., 2009).

WS-353 contains between 13 and 16 human sim-
ilarity judgements for each of 353 word pairs, rated
on a 1–10 integer scale. WN-Evocation is signif-
icantly larger than WS-353, containing over 100k
similarity comparisons collected from trained hu-
man raters. Comparisons are assigned to only 3-
5 human raters on average and contain a signifi-
cantly higher fraction of zero- and low-similarity
items than WS-353 (Figure 2), reflecting more ac-
curately real-world lexical semantics settings. In our
experiments we discard all comparisons with fewer
than 5 ratings and then sample 10% of the remain-
ing pairs uniformly at random, resulting in a test set
with 1317 comparisons.

For selectional preference, we employ the Padó
dataset, which contains 211 verb-noun pairs with
human similarity judgements for how plausible the
noun is for each argument of the verb (2 arguments
per verb, corresponding roughly to subject and ob-
ject). Results are averaged across 20 raters; typical
inter-rater agreement is ρ � 0.7 (Padó et al., 2007).

In all cases correlation with human judgements
is computed using Spearman’s nonparametric rank
correlation (ρ) with average human judgements

(Agirre et al., 2009).

6.3 Feature Representation

In the following analyses we confine ourselves to
representing word occurrences using unordered un-
igrams collected from a window of size T�10 cen-
tered around the occurrence, represented using tf-idf
weighting. Feature vectors are pruned to a fixed
length f , discarding all but the highest-weight fea-
tures (f is selected via empirical validation, as de-
scribed in the next section). Finally, semantic simi-
larity between word pairs is computed using cosine
distance (`2-normalized dot-product).2

6.4 Feature Pruning

Feature pruning is one of the most significant factors
in obtaining high correlation with human similarity
judgements using vector-space models, and has been
suggested as one way to improve sense disambigua-
tion for polysemous verbs (Xue et al., 2006). In this
section, we calibrate the single prototype and multi-
prototype methods on WS-353, reaching the limit
of human and oracle performance and demonstrat-
ing robust performance gains even with semanti-
cally impoverished features. In particular we obtain
ρ�0.75 correlation on WS-353 using only unigram
collocations and ρ�0.77 using a fixed-K multi-
prototype representation (Figure 3; Reisinger and
Mooney, 2010). This result rivals average human
performance, obtaining correlation near that of the
supervised oracle approach of Agirre et al. (2009).

The optimal pruning cutoff depends on the fea-
ture weighting and number of prototypes as well as
the feature representation. t-test and χ2 features are
most robust to feature noise and perform well even
with no pruning; tf-idf yields the best results but is
most sensitive to the pruning parameter (Figure 3).
As the number of features increases, more pruning
is required to combat feature noise.

Figure 4 breaks down the similarity pairs into four
quantiles for each data set and then shows corre-
lation separately for each quantile. In general the
more polarized data quantiles (1 and 4) have higher
correlation, indicating that fine-grained distinctions

2(Parameter robustness) We observe lower correlations on
average for T�25 and T�5 and therefore observe T�10 to
be near-optimal. Substituting weighted Jaccard similarity for
cosine does not significantly affect the results in this paper.

ture pruning improves correlations in quantiles 2–4
while reducing correlation in quantile 1 (lowest sim-
ilarity). This result is to be expected as more fea-
tures are necessary to make fine-grained distinctions
between dissimilar pairs.

7 Results

We evaluate four models: (1) the standard single-
prototype approach, (2) the DPMM multi-prototype
approach outlined in §3, (3) a simple combina-
tion of the multi-prototype and single-prototype ap-
proaches (MP+SP)4 and (4) the tiered clustering ap-
proach (§4). Each data set is divided into 5 quan-
tiles based on per-pair average sense counts,5 col-
lected from WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998); ex-
amples of pairs in the high-polysemy quantile are
shown in Table 2. Unless otherwise specified,
both DPMM multi-prototype and tiered clustering

3The fact that the per-quantile correlation is significantly
lower than the full correlation e.g. in the human case indicates
that fine-grained ordering (within quantile) is more difficult than
coarse-grained (between quantile).

4(MP+SP) Tiered clustering’s ability to model both shared
and idiosyncratic structure can be easily approximated by us-
ing the single prototype model as the shared component and
multi-prototype model as the clustering. However, unlike in the
tiered model, all features are assigned to both components. We
demonstrate that this simplification actually hurts performance.

5Despite many skewed pairs (e.g. line has 36 senses while
insurance has 3), we found that arithmetic average and geomet-
ric average perform the same.

representation size. In general tf-idf features are the most sensitive to pruning level, yielding the highest correlation for
moderate levels of pruning and significantly lower correlation than other representations without pruning. The optimal
amount of pruning varies with the number of prototypes used, with fewer features being optimal for more clusters.

7.1 WordSim-353
Correlation results for WS-353 are shown in Table
3. In general the approaches incorporating multiple
prototypes outperform single prototype (ρ � 0.768
vs. ρ � 0.734). The tiered clustering model does not
significantly outperform either the multi-prototype
or MP+SP models on the full set, but yields signifi-
cantly higher correlation on the high-polysemy set.

The tiered model generates more clusters than
DPMM multi-prototype (27.2 vs. 14.8), despite us-
ing the same hyperparameter settings: Since words
commonly shared across clusters have been allo-
cated to the background component, the cluster
components have less overlap and hence the model
naturally allocates more clusters.

words from WS-353 are shown in Table 1 and corre-
sponding clusters from the multi-prototype approach
are shown in Table 4. In general the background
component does indeed capture commonalities be-
tween all the sense clusters (e.g. all wizards use
magic) and hence the tiered clusters are more se-
mantically pure. This effect is most visible in the-

ilarity is a sparse relation (Figure 2 top). Further-
more, it contains proportionally more highly polyse-
mous words relative to WS-353 (Figure 2 bottom).

On WN-Evocation, the single prototype and
multi-prototype do not differ significantly in terms
of correlation (ρ�0.198 and ρ�0.201 respectively;
Table 5), while SP+MP yields significantly lower
correlation (ρ�0.176), and the tiered model yields
significantly higher correlation (ρ�0.224). Restrict-
ing to the top 20% of pairs with highest human
similarity judgements yields similar outcomes, with
single prototype, multi-prototype and SP+MP sta-
tistically indistinguishable (ρ�0.239, ρ�0.227 and
ρ�0.235), and tiered clustering yielding signifi-
cantly higher correlation (ρ�0.277). Likewise tiered
clustering achieves the most significant gains on the
high polysemy subset.

tional preference, especially for more selectionally
restrictive verbs: the set of words that appear in a

commonality (i.e. they can be eaten or can promise).
The background component of the tiered clustering
model can capture such general argument structure.
We model each verb argument slot in the Padó set
with a separate tiered clustering model, separating
terms co-occurring with the target verb according to
which slot they fill.

On the Padó set, the performance of the DPMM
multi-prototype approach breaks down and it yields
significantly lower correlation with human norms
than the single prototype (ρ�0.202 vs. ρ�0.258;
Table 6), due to its inability to capture the shared
structure among verb arguments. Furthermore com-
bining with the single prototype does not signif-
icantly change its performance (ρ�0.197). Mov-
ing to the tiered model, however, yields significant
improvements in correlation over the other models
(ρ�0.294), primarily improving correlation in the
case of highly polysemous verbs and arguments.

8 Discussion and Future Work

We have demonstrated a novel model for dis-
tributional lexical semantics capable of capturing
both shared (context-independent) and idiosyncratic
(context-dependent) structure in a set of word occur-
rences. The benefits of this tiered model were most
pronounced on a selectional preference task, where
there is significant shared structure imposed by con-
ditioning on the verb. Although our results on the
Padó are not state of the art,6 we believe this to be
due to the impoverished vector-space design; tiered
clustering can be applied to more expressive vec-
tor spaces, such as those incorporating dependency
parse and FrameNet features.

One potential explanation for the superior perfor-
mance of the tiered model vs. the DPMM multi-
prototype model is simply that it allocates more
clusters to represent each word (Reisinger and
Mooney, 2010). However, we find that decreas-
ing the hyperparameter β (decreasing vocabulary
smoothing and hence increasing the effective num-
ber of clusters) beyond β � 0.1 actually hurts multi-
prototype performance. The additional clusters do
not provide more semantic content due to significant
background similarity.

Finally, the DPMM multi-prototype and tiered
clustering models allocate clusters based on the vari-
ance of the underlying data set. We observe a neg-
ative correlation (ρ��0.33) between the number of
clusters allocated by the DPMM and the number of
word senses found in WordNet. This result is most
likely due to our use of unigram context window
features, which induce clustering based on thematic
rather than syntactic differences. Investigating this
issue is future work.

(Future Work) The word similarity experiments
can be expanded by breaking pairs down further into
highly homonymous and highly polysemous pairs,
using e.g. WordNet to determine how closely related
the senses are. With this data it would be interest-
ing to validate the hypothesis that the percentage of
features allocated to the background cluster is corre-
lated with the degree of homonymy.

The basic tiered clustering can be extended with
additional background tiers, allocating more expres-
sivity to model background feature variation. This
class of models covers the spectrum between a pure

topic model (all background tiers) and a pure clus-
tering model and may be reasonable when there is
believed to be more background structure (e.g. when
jointly modeling all verb arguments). Furthermore,
it is straightforward to extend the model to a two-
tier, two-clustering structure capable of additionally
accounting for commonalities between arguments.

Applying more principled feature selection ap-
proaches to vector-space lexical semantics may
yield more significant performance gains. Towards
this end we are currently evaluating two classes of
approaches for setting pruning parameters per-word
instead of globally: (1) subspace clustering, i.e.
unsupervised feature selection (e.g., Parsons et al.,
2004) and (2) multiple clustering, i.e. finding fea-
ture partitions that lead to disparate clusterings (e.g.,
Shafto et al., 2006).

9 Conclusions

This paper introduced a simple probabilistic model
of tiered clustering inspired by feature selective
clustering that leverages feature exchangeability to
allocate data features between a clustering model
and shared component. The ability to model back-
ground variation, or shared structure, is shown to be
beneficial for modeling words with high polysemy,
yielding increased correlation with human similarity
judgements modeling word relatedness and selec-
tional preference. Furthermore, the tiered clustering
model is shown to significantly outperform related
models, yielding qualitatively more precise clusters.

A Collapsed Gibbs Sampler

In order to sample efficiently from this model, we
leverage the Chinese Restaurant Process represen-
tation of the DP (cf., Aldous, 1985), introducing a
per-word-occurrence cluster indicator cd. Word oc-
currence features are then drawn from a combination
of a single cluster component indicated by cd and the
background topic.

By exploiting conjugacy, the latent variables θ, φ
and ηd can be integrated out, yielding an efficient

collapsed Gibbs sampler. The likelihood of word
occurrence d is given by

P pwd|z, cd,φq �¹
i

P pwi,d|φcdq
δpzd,i�0qP pwi,d|φnoiseq

δpzd,i�1q.

Hence, this model can be viewed as a two-topic
variant of LDA with the addition of a per-word-
occurrence (i.e. document) cluster indicator.7 The
update rule for the latent tier indicator z is similar
to the update rule for 2-topic LDA, with the back-
ground component as the first topic and the second
topic being determined by the per-word-occurrence
cluster indicator c.

We can efficiently approximate ppz|wq via Gibbs
sampling, which requires the complete conditional
posteriors for all zi,d. These are
