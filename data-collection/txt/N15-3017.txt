Abstract

We present Brahmi-Net - an online system for
transliteration and script conversion for all ma-
jor Indian language pairs (306 pairs). The sys-
tem covers 13 Indo-Aryan languages, 4 Dra-
vidian languages and English. For training
the transliteration systems, we mined paral-
lel transliteration corpora from parallel trans-
lation corpora using an unsupervised method
and trained statistical transliteration systems
using the mined corpora. Languages which
do not have parallel corpora are supported
by transliteration through a bridge language.
Our script conversion system supports con-
version between all Brahmi-derived scripts as
well as ITRANS romanization scheme. For
this, we leverage co-ordinated Unicode ranges
between Indic scripts and use an extended
ITRANS encoding for transliterating between
English and Indic scripts. The system also pro-
vides top-k transliterations and simultaneous
transliteration into multiple output languages.
We provide a Python as well as REST API to
access these services. The API and the mined
transliteration corpus are made available for
research use under an open source license.

1 Introduction

The Indian subcontinent is home to some of the most
widely spoken languages of the world. It is unique
in terms of the large number of scripts used for writ-
ing these languages. Most of the these are abugida
scripts derived from the Brahmi script. Brahmi is

one of the oldest writing systems of the Indian sub-
continent which can be dated to at least the 3rd cen-
tury B.C.E. In addition, Arabic-derived and Roman
scripts are also used for some languages. Given the
diversity of languages and scripts, transliteration and
script conversion are extremely important to enable
effective communication.
The goal of script conversion is to represent the

source script accurately in the target script, without
loss of phonetic information. It is useful for exactly
reading manuscripts, signboards, etc. It can serve
as a useful tool for linguists, NLP researchers, etc.
whose research is multilingual in nature. Script con-
version enables reading text written in foreign scripts
accurately in a user's native script. On the other
hand, transliteration aims to conform to the phonol-
ogy of the target language, while being close to the
source language phonetics. Transliteration is needed
for phonetic input systems, cross-lingual informa-
tion retrieval, question-answering, machine transla-
tion and other cross-lingual applications.

Brahmi-Net is a general purpose transliteration
and script conversion system that aims to provide so-
lutions for South Asian scripts and languages. While
transliteration and script conversion are challenging
given the scale and diversity, we leverage the com-
monality in the phonetics and the scriptural systems
of these languages. The major features of Brahmi-
Net are:

1. It supports 18 languages and 306 language
pairs for statistical transliteration. The sup-
ported languages cover 13 Indo-Aryan lan-
guage (Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi,
Konkani, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, San-
skrit, Sindhi, Sinhala, Urdu) , 4 Dravidian lan-

81



guages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu)
and English. To the best of our knowledge,
no other system covers as many languages and
scripts.

2. It supports script conversion among the fol-
lowing 10 scripts used by major Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian languages: Bengali, Gujarati,
Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, Devana-
gari, Sinhala, Tamil and Telugu. Some of these
scripts are used for writing multiple languages.
Devanagari is used for writing Hindi, Sanskrit,
Marathi, Nepali, Konkani and Sindhi. The Ben-
gali script is also used for writing Assamese.
Also, Sanskrit has historically been written in
many of the above mentioned scripts.

3. The system also supports an extended ITRANS
transliteration scheme for romanization of the
Indic scripts.

4. The transliteration and script conversion sys-
tems are accessible via an online portal. Some
additional features include the ability to simul-
taneously view transliterations to all available
languages and the top-k best transliterations.

5. AnApplication Programming Interface (API) is
available as a Python package and a REST in-
terface for easy integration of the transliteration
and script conversion systems into other appli-
cations requiring transliteration services.

6. As part of the project, parallel transliteration
corpora has been mined for transliteration be-
tween 110 languages pairs for the following 11
languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Konkani,
Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu, Malayalam, Tamil,
Telugu and English. The parallel translitera-
tion corpora is comprised of 1,694,576 word
pairs across all language pairs, which is roughly
15,000 mined pairs per language pair.

2 Script Conversion

Our script conversion engine contains two rule-
based systems: one for script conversion amongst
scripts of the Brahmi family, and the other for ro-
manization of Brahmi scripts.

2.1 Among scripts of the Brahmi family
Each Brahmi-derived Indian language script has
been allocated a distinct codepoint range in the Uni-
code standard. These scripts have a similar char-
acter inventory, but different glyphs. Hence, the
first 85 characters in each Unicode block are in the
same order and position, on a script by script basis.
Our script conversion method simply maps the code-
points between the two scripts.
The Tamil script is different from other scripts

since it uses the characters for unvoiced, unaspi-
rated plosives for representing voiced and/or aspi-
rated plosives. When converting into the Tamil
script, we substitute all voiced and/or aspirated plo-
sives by the corresponding unvoiced, unaspirated
plosive in the Tamil script. For Sinhala, we do an ex-
plicit mapping between the characters since the Uni-
code ranges are not coordinated.
This simple script conversion scheme accounts for

a vast majority of the characters. However, there
are some characters which do not have equivalents
in other scripts, an issue we have not addressed so
far. For instance, the Dravidian scripts do not have
the nukta character.

2.2 Between a Roman transliteration scheme
and scripts from the Brahmi family

We chose ITRANS1 as our transliteration scheme
since: (i) it can be entered using Roman keyboard
characters, (ii) the Roman character mappings map
to Indic script characters in a phonetically intuitive
fashion. The official ITRANS specification is lim-
ited to the Devanagari script. We have added a few
extensions to account for some characters not found
in non-Devanagari scripts. Our extended encoding
is backward compatible with ITRANS. We convert
Devanagari to ITRANS using Alan Little's python
module2. For romanization of other scripts, we use
Devanagari as a pivot script and use the inter-Brahmi
script converter mentioned in Section 2.1.

3 Transliteration

Though Indian language scripts are phonetic and
largely unambiguous, script conversion is not a sub-

stitute for transliteration which needs to account for
the target language phonology and orthographic con-
ventions. The main challenges that machine translit-
eration systems encounter are: script specifications,
missing sounds, transliteration variants, language of
origin, etc. (Karimi et al., 2011). A summary of the
challenges specific to Indian languages is described
by Antony, P. J. and Soman, K.P. (2011).

3.1 Transliteration Mining
Statistical transliteration can address these chal-
lenges by learning transliteration divergences from a
parallel transliteration corpus. For most Indian lan-
guage pairs, parallel transliteration corpora are not
publicly available. Hence, we mine transliteration
corpora for 110 language pairs from the ILCI corpus,
a parallel translation corpora of 11 Indian languages
(Jha, 2012). Transliteration pairs are mined using
the unsupervised approach proposed by Sajjad et al.
(2012) and implemented in the Moses SMT system
(Durrani et al., 2014). Their approach models paral-
lel translation corpus generation as a generative pro-
cess comprising an interpolation of a transliteration
and a non-transliteration process. The parameters of
the generative process are learnt using the EM proce-
dure, followed by extraction of transliteration pairs
from the parallel corpora.
Table 1 shows the statistics of mined pairs. We

mined a total of 1.69 million word pairs for 110 lan-
guage pairs. We observed disparity in the counts of
mined transliteration pairs across languages. Lan-
guage pairs of the Indo-Aryan family from geo-
graphically contiguous regions have more number
of mined pairs. For instance, the hin-pan, hin-
guj, mar-guj, kok-mar pairs have high number of
mined transliterations averaging more than 30,000
entries. The mined pairs are diverse, containing
spelling variations, orthographic variations, sound
shifts, cognates and loan words.

3.2 Training transliteration systems
We model the transliteration problem as a phrase
based translation problem, a common approach
which learns mappings from character sequences in
the source language to the target language. The sys-
tems were trained on the mined transliteration par-
allel corpus using Moses. The mined pairs are first
segmented and a phrase-based machine translation

system is trained on them.
We used a hybrid approach for transliteration in-

volving languages for which we could not mine
a parallel transliteration corpus. Source languages
which cannot be statistically transliterated are first
transliterated into a phonetically close language
(bridge language) using the above-mentioned rule-
based system. The bridge language is then transliter-
ated into the target language using statistical translit-
eration. Similarly, for target languages which cannot
be statistically transliterated, the source is first sta-
tistically transliterated into a phonetically close lan-
guage, followed by rule-based transliteration into the
target language.

4 Brahmi-Net Interface

Brahmi-Net is accessible via a web interface as well
an API. We describe these interfaces in this section.

4.1 Web Interface

The purpose of the Web interface is to allow users
quick access to transliteration and script conversion
services. They can also choose to see the translitera-
tion/script conversion output in all target languages,
making comparison easier. Alternative choices of
transliteration can also be studied by requesting the
top-5 transliterations for each input. A snapshot of
the interface is shown in Figure 1. The web interface
is accessible at:
http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/brahminet/

4.2 REST API

We provide a REST interface to access the transliter-
ation and script conversion services. Simultaneous
transliterations/script conversion into all languages
and top-k transliterations are also available. The
REST endpoints have an intuitive signature. For in-
stance, to fetch the transliteration for a word from
English (en) to Hindi (hi), the REST endpoint is:

http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indicnlpweb/

indicnlpws/transliterate/en/hi/<input>/statistical

The API returns a serialized JSON object containing
a dictionary of target language to top-k translitera-
tions. The detailed API reference is available on the
website.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Transliteration Accuracy

We evaluated the top-1 and top-5 transliteration ac-
curacy for a sample set of language pairs. For this
evaluation, we used an internally available, manu-
ally created corpus of 1000 transliteration pairs for
each language pair. These transliterations were man-
ually curated from synsets in IndoWordNet3 Though
this corpus does not reflect the diversity in the mined
transliterations, evaluation on this corpus could be a
pointer to utility of the transliteration corpus. We
compare the accuracy of match for transliteration

5.2 Case Study: Improving SMT output

Our work in developing the transliteration systems
was initially motivated by the need for transliterating
the untranslated words in SMT output. To evaluate
the transliteration systems in the context of machine
translation, we post-edited the phrase based system
(PB-SMT) outputs of Indian language pairs provided
by Kunchukuttan et al. (2014) using our translitera-
tion systems. Each untranslated word was replaced
by each of its top-1000 transliterations and the re-
sulting candidate sentences were re-ranked using a
language model. We observe a significant improve-
ment in translation quality across language pairs, as
measured by the BLEU evaluation metric. Due to
space constraints, we present results for only 8 lan-
guage pairs in Table 3. We observed that though
the system's best transliteration is not always correct,
the sentence context and the language model select
the right transliteration from the top-k transliteration

6 Conclusion

Brahmi-Net is an effort to provide a comprehen-
sive transliteration and script conversion solution
for all languages of the Indian subcontinent. Un-
supervised transliteration mining and leveraging the
phonetic and scriptural similarities between the lan-
guages have been the key ingredients in scaling the
system to a large number of languages. Even the
simple phrase based SMT model of transliteration
has proved useful for transliterating the output of
MT systems. A natural extension would be to em-
ploy richer transliteration models. There is scope
for improvement in the hybrid models of transliter-
ation used in the system. Some of the finer details
regarding script conversions have to be ironed out.
Finally, a long term goal is to support other major
languages from South Asia, which differ phoneti-
cally from the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages
or use non-Brahmi scripts.
