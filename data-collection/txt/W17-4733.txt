Abstract

We introduce the Helsinki Neural Machine
Translation system (HNMT) and how it
is applied in the news translation task at
WMT 2017, where it ranked first in both
the human and automatic evaluations for
English–Finnish. We discuss the success
of English–Finnish translations and the
overall advantage of NMT over a strong
SMT baseline. We also discuss our sub-
missions for English–Latvian, English–
Chinese and Chinese–English.

1 Introduction

The Helsinki Neural Machine Translation system
(HNMT) is a full-featured system for neural ma-
chine translation, with a particular focus on mor-
phologically rich languages. We participated in
the WMT 2017 shared task on news translation,
obtaining the highest BLEU score for English–
Finnish translation, while also performing well
on English–Latvian and acceptably on English–
Chinese and Chinese–English.

In addition to our participation in the shared
task, this paper also details some of the other
methods we have implemented and evaluated with
HNMT, many of which yielded negative results
and were subsequently not used in our submis-
sions for the shared task.

1.1 HNMT

HNMT is based on the attentional encoder–
decoder model due to Bahdanau et al. (2014). This
is a rather minimalistic framework for NMT, and
many extensions have been proposed. Of particu-
lar interest are those that allow proper and efficient

handling of morphologically rich languages, such
as Finnish. We combine two such approaches: the
hybrid character/word model of Luong and Man-
ning (2016), which is used for the source language
encoder, and the byte-pair encoding (BPE) tech-
nique of Sennrich et al. (2016c), which is used
for the target language decoder and has been suc-
cessfully used for Finnish previously (Sánchez-
Cartagena and Toral, 2016). As BPE can be added
as a simple pre- and post-processing step, it does
not affect the structure of the translation model.
This means that our system can be used with char-
acter, word and BPE level generation on the tar-
get side. The structure of the network, thus, con-
sists of three Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) layers:

1. A character-level encoder that transforms
out-of-vocabulary source tokens into the
same vector space as the source word embed-
dings.

2. A token-level bidirectional encoder that
transforms a sequence of source word em-
beddings (or outputs from network (1) in case
of OOV items) into an encoded sequence of
the same length.

3. A character-, token- or BPE-level decoder
that works as language model conditioned
(via an attention mechanism) on the encoded
source sequence from (2).

HNMT is implemented using Theano (Theano De-
velopment Team, 2016), which supports efficient
training with a GPU. For optimization we use
minibatch stochastic gradient descent with Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2015) for learning rate adapta-
tion.

2 Tricks from the NMT arsenal

We have implemented and evaluated a number
of proposed extensions to the basic attentional
encoder–decoder model. Basic experiments were
carried out on English–Finnish data, unless speci-
fied otherwise.

2.1 Layer normalization

Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) has been
proposed as a technique for speeding up train-
ing of recurrent network models. We have imple-
mented it into HNMT as the modified LSTM de-
scribed by equations (20)–(22) in Ba et al. (2016).
However, as preliminary experiments did not in-
dicate any consistent effect of using layer normal-
ization we did not include it in our evaluation.

2.2 Variational dropout

Gal and Ghahramani (2016) proposed a method
for regularization of recurrent neural networks.
This has also been implemented in HNMT, but
preliminary experiments on Finnish did not in-
dicate any improvement over the baseline sys-
tem. While Sennrich et al. (2016a) reported large
improvements for the Romanian news translation
task at WMT 2016, the amount of training data
is lower than what is available for Finnish, which
should explain some of the difference. They also
apply dropout on the word level, whereas the
HNMT application currently only drops recurrent
states.

2.3 Context gates

Context gates (Tu et al., 2017) introduce an ex-
plicit model for selecting to which extent the tar-
get sentence generation should focus on the source
sentence or the target context, giving the network a
chance to tune the balance between adequacy and
fluency. While we obtained better cross-entropy
on the development set, particularly early during
training, the BLEU and chrF3 evaluations on de-
velopment data made us decide against the slower
context gates in the final run.

2.4 Coverage decoder

Wu et al. (2016) present an empirically determined
method for using the attention vectors produced
during decoding in the search algorithm, to bias
the decoder towards translations with reasonable

length and good coverage of the source sentence.1

We performed a grid search of the parameter space
for the length, coverage and overtranslation penal-
ties, but did not find any that resulted in higher
BLEU scores on the development set than the de-
coder without penalties.

2.5 Forward-Backward reranking
It is trivial to train a translation model to generate
translations either from the beginning or the end
of the target sentence. HNMT supports selecting
translation direction, and combined with its n-best
list and reranking features it is simple to gener-
ate candidate translations in both directions and to
combine them based on their scores. This led to
some minor improvements in our English–Finnish
translations.

2.6 Ensembling
HNMT supports two general modes of ensem-
bling, as well as their combination:

• Proper ensembling where p(w) =
1
M

∑M
m=1 pm(w) is used to predict tar-

get symbol w, given predictions pm(w) for
each model m in the ensemble.

• Parameter averaging where the model’s pa-
rameter vector θ is computed as 1N

∑M
m=1 θm

for each model m. This only works if the
different θm are relatively similar, typically
because they were saved at different points
during the same training process.

The overhead for proper ensembling is linear in
the number of ensembled systems, both for train-
ing (assuming one is building an ensemble of sepa-
rately trained models) and inference, while param-
eter averaging is essentially free. HNMT allows
proper ensembling of groups of models where the
parameters are averaged within each group. This
flexible structure allows a number of setups, which
are explored further in Section 3.2.

3 English–Finnish

In our experiments, we used all English–Finnish
parallel data sets provided by WMT except the
Wiki headlines, which is a small and rather noisy
data set that did not contribute anything in our
experiments from last year. We also added sub-
stantial amounts of backtranslated data that has

been shown to help especially in neural machine
translation (Sennrich et al., 2016b) but also in sta-
tistical MT (Tiedemann et al., 2016). Table 1
lists some basic statistics of the backtranslated
data sets we created out of WMT’s monolingual
Finnish news data from 2014 and from 2016. We
applied our best constrained phrase-based SMT
model for Finnish to English from last year (Tiede-
mann et al., 2016) that uses a factored model with
multiple translation paths, morphological tags and
pseudo-tokens for case-markers that correspond
to English prepositions (Tiedemann et al., 2015).
The system scored 20.5% lowercased BLEU on
the newstest 2016 data, which was the second-best
system for the task in 2016.

Table 1: Backtranslated Finnish news data.

3.1 Preprocessing and postprocessing

We trained our models on tokenized and true-
cased data, except for the character-level mod-
els which were trained on raw untokenized data.
For the former, we applied Moses tools for Uni-
code/punctuation normalisation, tokenization and
truecasing using a model trained on the parallel
training data.

We tested three different types of word segmen-
tation: basic word-based segmentation, supervised
morphological segmentation using OMorFi (Piri-
nen, 2015) and byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016c). For the latter, we opted for
a fine-grained segmentation that results in a small
vocabulary of 20,000 tokens when trained on the
parallel data, expecting BPE to handle various
cases of compound splitting and morphological
segmentation. We always used the same BPE-
based segmentation and did not try to optimize the
BPE parameters in any way.

During development, we observed that the En-
glish development files contained a lot of verb
form contractions (of the type wouldn’t), but that
such contracted forms appear rarely in the training
data. Therefore, we also added a preprocessing
routine to transform the contracted forms to their
uncontracted equivalents.

Finally, we found that our tokenizer/detokenizer
pipeline for Finnish did not handle the hy-
phen/dash distinction correctly. In Finnish, the ‘-’

sign can be used with spaces on both sides, with-
out spaces, with a space only on the left, and with
a space only on the right, as in the following ex-
amples:

(1) a. Draamaa Riossa - suomalaisnostaja
pyörtyi. . .
‘Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter
fainted. . . ’

b. Kempinski-hotelli
‘Kempinski[-]hotel’

c. kissa ja hiiri -leikkiä
‘cat and mouse [-]game’

d. öljy- ja kaasutoiminnot
‘oil[-] and gas functions’

The tokenizer always introduces spaces on both
sides, which means that the detokenizer is then un-
able to retrieve the original configuration. In order
to remedy this problem, we applied a postprocess-
ing step to the translated data. After detokeniz-
ing the output, for every hyphen sign, the four to-
kenization variants were generated and scored by
the hybrid-to-character system; we then chose the
tokenization variant with the highest score.

3.2 NMT Models
In preliminary experiments, we focused on dif-
ferent segmentation strategies for the source and
target sides as well as on different proportions of
backtranslations and parallel data. The models
were evaluated on newsdev2015 using lowercased
BLEU and chrF3.2 Table 2 shows some results.

In these experiments, we found BPE to be use-
ful on the target side, but not so much on the
source side. Character-level decoders are favoured
by character-level evaluation scores such as chrF3,
whereas BLEU favours decoders using larger units
such as BPE. The best results were obtained
with a combination of backtranslated and paral-
lel data; using all backtranslations was slightly
better than restricting the amount of backtransla-
tions to match the size of the parallel data. The
model based on supervised morphological seg-
mentation followed by BPE encoding (OMorFi)
yielded promising chrF3 results, but lagged be-
hind in terms of BLEU. Further investigation is
needed on the benefits and shortcomings of com-
bining these segmentation approaches.

2The HNMT-internal BLEU computation is based on
https://github.com/vikasnar/Bleu and on the
NLTK tokenizer. The reported results are thus not directly
comparable with official WMT results.

Table 3: Development results with different en-
sembling setups. Each configuration consists of M
models, with SP/M savepoints per model, where
the savepoints may be averaged (+AVG) or in-
cluded as equal members in the ensemble (-AVG).

The model based on a hybrid encoder and
a BPE decoder did not yield the best results
in this preliminary evaluation, but showed the
most robust performance across different evalua-
tion types, training configurations and evaluation
data (in particular, it outperformed other models
on the newstest2015 set). Therefore, four of our
five submissions use that configuration. For com-
parison, we also submitted a system based on a
character-level decoder.

We also investigated the effect of different en-
sembling combinations, and the result can be
found in Table 3. In general, proper ensembling
is better than savepoint averaging, but savepoint
averaging is better than nothing. Further experi-
ments revealed that the difference between an en-
semble of averaged savepoints from independent
models setup (second row from the bottom) and
an ensemble of several savepoints each from inde-
pendent models (bottom row) is not consistent, so
we use the former (faster) variant for our official
submissions.

The submitted character-decoder system uses
256 dimensions for word embeddings, 64 for char-
acter embeddings, 512 encoder state dimensions,
1024 decoder state dimensions, and 256 attention
dimensions. We train four independent models for
72h each, and the savepoint with the best heldout

chrF3 score is used (in practice we do not observe
any significant overfitting, so this amounts to us-
ing nearly 72h of training for all models). Train-
ing data are the unprocessed versions of all paral-
lel and backtranslated data. For decoding, we used
proper ensembling of the four models, and averag-
ing of the four last savepoints of each model (states
were saved after each 5000 training batches).

The submitted BPE-decoder systems use the
same model size as the character-decoder sys-
tem. Again, we train four independent models
for 72h each, using the preprocessed and BPE-
encoded data, with hyphen retokenization applied
as a postprocessing step. We provide two con-
trastive systems: one without input normalization,
which shows a decrease of 0.3 BLEU, and one
without hyphen retokenization, which shows a de-
crease of 0.9 BLEU (see Table 4).

We also propose an extended system that is
based on the four models above and four addi-
tional backwards models (i.e., trained right-to-
left). At test time, we generate a 10-best list of
forward translations and a similar one of back-
ward translations. We choose the best translation
that occurred in both lists, or if the lists are dis-
joint, the translation with the highest likelihood
according to the model (forward or backward) that
generated it. This reranking only provided +0.1
BLEU; 48% of translations were chosen from the
forward model, 22% from the backward model,
and 30% occurred in both lists. This system has
been ranked first in the automatic and manual eval-
uations.

3.3 SMT Baselines

Besides the neural MT models, we also trained
various phrase-based SMT models to contrast our
results with another popular paradigm. In par-
ticular, we were interested to see the effect of
BPE segmentation and backtranslation on statis-

tical MT. Both techniques are popular in neural
MT but their impact on statistical MT has not
been evaluated properly before. Therefore, we
started a systematic comparison of different se-
tups including various types of segmentations and
data collections. All systems are based on Moses
(Koehn et al., 2007) and we use standard con-
figurations for training non-factored phrase-based
SMT models using KenLM for language modeling
(Heafield, 2011) and BLEU-based MERT for tun-
ing. The only difference to the standard pipeline is
the use of efmaral (Östling and Tiedemann, 2016),
an efficient implementation of fertility-based IBM
word alignment models with a Bayesian extension
and Gibbs sampling.3 Table 5 summarizes the
results of our SMT experiments during develop-
ment.

The first observation is that BPE (and also su-
pervised morphological segmentation) is not very
helpful. This is somewhat surprising as we expect
a similar problem as with neural MT in the sense
that the productive and rich morphology in Finnish
causes problems due to data sparseness. We can
see that some models benefit from BPE (see back
and opus) especially if tuning is done on the word
level and not on BPE-segmented output. However,
we have to admit that we did not attempt to opti-
mize the segmentation level and it can well be that
the small BPE vocabulary in our setup is not work-
ing well for SMT.

Another observation is that the operation-
sequence model does not lead to significant (or
any) improvements. This is in contrast to related
work and may be due to data sparseness again due
to the morphological richness of Finnish.

The biggest surprise is the positive effect of
backtranslated data. The models trained on those

data sets only are in fact better than the ones
trained on the official training data provided by
WMT. This demonstrates the strong domain mis-
match between training and test data and the use
of in-domain data, even very noisy ones, seems to
lead to visible benefits. In combination, we can
see substantial improvements over the individual
models, which demonstrates the use of backtrans-
lation even for SMT.

Another common outcome in SMT is the strong
impact of language models. We can confirm this
once again. Adding a second language model
trained on common-crawl data (CC) has a strong
influence on translation quality as we can see by
the BLEU scores in Table 5.

In the manual evaluation, our best SMT system
shared 6th rank with four other systems (interest-
ingly a mix of phrase-based, rule-based and neural
systems), of which two were constrained like ours.

3.4 NMT with Pre-translated Data

We were also interested in the combination of
SMT and NMT using the pre-translation approach
proposed by Niehues et al. (2016). In their model,
SMT-based translations of the source text are sim-
ply concatenated to the input to make it possi-
ble for an NMT system to draw information from
other MT models. Niehues et al. show that the
attention model is capable of learning the connec-
tions between the pre-translated part and the orig-
inal source language input to jointly influence the
generated target language translations. The ap-
proach is straightforward and interesting because
it may improve the faithfulness (or adequacy) of
the translation engine, which can be a problem in
neural encoder–decoder models.

One challenge is that training data has to be
translated completely to make it possible to learn
the final NMT model. One of the problems dis-
cussed by Niehues et al. is the issue of overfitting
to the SMT-based translation if the SMT model is
trained on the same data set as will be used for
learning the NMT model. They propose to weaken
the phrase table by removing longer segments and,
hence, reducing the capacity of the SMT model to
create very generic translation options.

In our setup, we use a different strategy: Instead
of using the same data sets for training and trans-
lating, we use the backtranslated news data to train
a model that can be used to translate the parallel
WMT data (Europarl and Rapid2016). With this,
we get the same domain-mismatch as during test
time with a realistically weak model that avoids
over-trusting its capacity when training the NMT
model in pre-translated data. Furthermore, we use
a WMT-model trained on Europarl and Rapid2016
to translate the backtranslated news data from En-
glish back to Finnish again. The latter may be a
problem because of the significant noise added due
to the double backtranslation but we do not want
to discard the important news data completely.

Another difference in our setup is that we use
BPE-segmented SMT models to obtain segmented
output that we can use directly to be concatenated
with the original (BPE-segmented) source. We
mark the pre-translated part with a special suf-
fix and then train a standard attention-based NMT
model. We use similar parameters as for our stan-
dard NMT experiments: 256-dimensional word
embeddings, encoder states and attentions, 512-
dimensional decoder states, and a vocabulary of

50,000 in source and target language. It turns out
that, indeed, the model learns to look at both the
source language and the pre-translated text, as we
can see in the attention plot in Figure 1.

Unfortunately, the training process is very slow
due to the extended input sequence and, hence,
converges very slowly. No useful model could be
submitted before the official deadline. Our final
system tested after the official submission is an en-
semble of four independently trained models with
savepoint averaging over the last four savepoints
and reaches a lowercased BLEU score of 17.34%
on newsdev 2015 and 20.92% on newstest 2017 in
our internal evaluations (but only 19.8% BLEU in
the official on-line system). Even tough this looks
quite encouraging compared to the SMT scores,
it is still below the plain NMT models, which is,
of course, a bit disappointing. However, the re-
sults are not directly comparable and there is some
variation that needs to be accounted for. More de-
tailed analyses are required to study the possible
contributions by the pre-translations. Further in-
vestigations of attention plots may reveal whether
the model still overfits to the SMT output, which
could be a good reason why it underperforms in
the end. The additional complexity and the in-
creased length of the input sequences are certainly
other reasons for the negative outcome. It also
seems that the strong performance of the NMT
model also with respect to adequacy make it dif-
ficult to improve it further with a weaker SMT
model.

3.5 Manual Evaluation

The outputs of the best SMT and NMT systems
were partially reviewed and compared by a profes-

343



sional translator. The impression of the reviewer
was that the perceived quality of NMT far exceeds
that of SMT, mainly due to the superior fluency of
NMT. The BLEU scores of the systems also in-
dicate a significant quality difference in favor of
NMT. However, single-reference BLEU scores are
known to be unreliable indicators of quality for
morphologically complex languages (Bojar et al.,
2010), and they are also known to favor SMT over
other MT methods (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).
Due to this, it is possible that the BLEU scores,
impressive as they are, do not reflect the real qual-
itative impact of NMT for English–Finnish MT.

To explore whether single-reference evaluation
underestimates NMT quality, a sample of 68 sen-
tences was extracted from the test set. Both SMT
and NMT translations of the sample were poste-
dited with minimal changes to the same quality
level as the reference translation. The minimally
edited MT was then used as a TER reference to
obtain a more reliable estimate of the MT qual-
ity. The sample was chosen from sentences where
SMT has a sentence-level TER that is at least 10
points lower than the corresponding NMT TER,
since such differences can indicate evaluation er-
rors. The sample was also restricted to sentences
with an SMT TER lower than 40 to reduce poste-
diting workload and filter out low-quality MT.

When postedited MT was used as a refer-
ence, total TER/BLEU for the sample changed
from 24.7/50.2 to 12.5/76.0 for SMT and from
48.4/25.0 to 18.3/70.5 for NMT. While the score
improved for both SMT and NMT, the improve-
ment is clearly much larger for NMT. The test
was then repeated for another sample of 68 sen-
tences from the test set, this time selected from
the sentences where NMT had lower sentence-
level TER. The purpose of this sample was to see
if evaluation errors affect single-reference scores
for SMT to the same extent as for NMT. With
the second sample, total TER/BLEU changed
from 58.9/22.1 to 42.5/39.3 for SMT and from
28.2/48.5 to 12.1/77.01 for NMT, so the result was
even more favorable for NMT. While the sample
size was small, these results strongly suggest that
single-reference BLEU scores indeed underesti-
mate NMT quality.

4 English–Latvian

Training models for English–Latvian was a rather
spontaneous decision and we did not spend a lot

of time optimizing our settings. Backtranslations
were produced with simplistic Latvian–English
models. We used a quickly trained character-level
NMT model to translate Latvian news data from
2016 and a standard phrase-based SMT model to
translate parts of 2014-2016 news data. The statis-
tics of the backtranslations are given in Table 6.

Table 6: Backtranslated Latvian news data using
SMT and NMT.

4.1 NMT Models

We submitted one NMT system that follows the
basic BPE-decoder system for English–Finnish in
terms of model size and training settings. It is
trained on the preprocessed versions of the par-
allel data and the NMT-based backtranslations.
This system yielded a case-sensitive BLEU score
of 16.8. We again applied hyphen retokeniza-
tion as a postprocessing step, although it was
less useful here than for Finnish (+0.1 BLEU).
Again, we trained four independent models and
used savepoint-averaging. For time reasons and
given the low impact of forward-backward rerank-
ing observed for Finnish, we refrained from sub-
mitting such a system for English–Latvian.

4.2 SMT Baselines

The SMT models we trained use the provided data
sets for training translation models and language
models (including a second language model based
on common crawl data) with the same tools as for
our English–Finnish systems. We applied BPE to
all data sets again with a rather fine-grained seg-
mentation into 20,000 types on training data. Ta-
ble 7 summarizes the results of our models on the
newstest data from 2017.

We can see that the backtranslated data sets
do not work very well in the Latvian case. A
small improvement can be observed when com-
bined with the provided training data but the qual-
ity of the backtranslations is too poor to have a
strong impact on translation quality.

Table 7: Statistical MT for English–Latvian tested
on newstest 2017 (lowercased BLEU). The offi-
cial score in the on-line evaluation system (low-
ercased) is surprisingly different from our own
evaluations. The manual evaluation for English–
Latvian produced no statistically significant rank-
ing.

5 English–Chinese and Chinese–English

For English/Chinese, we performed experiments
with the HNMT system only. We trained both
English–Chinese and Chinese–English models,
using all of the available parallel training data
from the WMT/CWMT news translation task. Af-
ter cleaning, 24,954,952 sentence pairs remained.
Using the standard Moses tools, we tokenized and
truecased the English data. Two methods were
used for Chinese word segmentation, as detailed
below.

All the models are trained by a hybrid
character–word level encoder and a character-level
decoder. The final submissions are generated by
ensembles with parameters averaging. The offi-
cial BLEU scores of these two tasks are shown in
Table 8. The manual evaluation ranked our system
in a shared last place (shared with four other sys-
tems) for Chinese–English, while it was ranked #9
(better than two unconstrained online systems) for
English–Chinese.

5.1 Translating Chinese into English

Chinese is a language without word boundaries,
so word segmentation is necessary before us-
ing our hybrid encoder with Chinese source sen-
tences. There are different segmentation meth-
ods at different granularities, and they will lead
to different translations. In the work of Su et al.
(2017), they proposed a lattice-based recurrent en-
coder which applied three segmentations at differ-
ent granularities (from the CTB, PKU and MSRA
corpora). In our model, we just tried two seg-
mentations: One is a fine-grained method imple-
mented in Zpar (Zhang and Clark, 2011), the other
is a coarse-granularity method by THULAC (Sun
et al., 2016). The model with THULAC segmen-

Chinese language pair news translation task.

tation achieved a slightly lower BLEU score com-
pared to the model with Zpar segmentation. Thus,
we did not train more models on THULAC seg-
mentation data after 6-day training. Unlike our re-
sults with English–Finnish translation, our exper-
iments with BPE using a 30,000 size vocabulary
did not yield any improvements.

The final submission uses Zpar for segmenta-
tion, a hybrid encoder with 60,000 item vocab-
ulary, and a character-level decoder. We use di-
mensionalities of 256 for both word and character
embedding, encoder LSTM and attention. The de-
coder uses an LSTM of size 512. We use a single
model with parameters averaged from savepoints
at 6, 9, 10, 12 and 14 days to generate the final
submission. This is a rather unusual setup and dif-
ferent from the Finnish and Latvian submissions,
but it shows parameter averaging works even when
days have passed between savepoints. The beam
size in the decoding is set to 10.

5.2 Translating English into Chinese

In addition to translating English into Chinese or-
thography (using Chinese characters, Hanzi), we
also explored translating into romanized Chinese
(using the Pinyin system), and then disambiguat-
ing the Pinyin to Hanzi with a 3-gram language
model. This reduces the vocabulary to the circa
1300 syllables in Standard Mandarin. However,
the final disambiguation step introduces new er-
rors that were not outweighed by the easier task
of predicting Pinyin output, and we did not pursue
this method.

For our official submission, we used a hy-
brid encoder with 50,000 vocabulary size, and a
character-level decoder. Again, we used a single
model with parameters averaged from savepoints
at 6, 7.5 and 11.5 days.

6 Conclusions

This paper introduces the Helsinki Neural Ma-
chine Translation system (HNMT) and its suc-
cesful application to the news translation task in
WMT 2017. The models we trained handle well
the translation into morphologically complex lan-

guages such as Finnish and our submission scored
best among the participants in the English–Finnish
task. The evaluations show that the neural mod-
els are superior to the strong SMT baselines that
exploit the same tricks such as backtranslated data
and automatic word segmentation. Manual inspec-
tions suggest that the advantage of NMT is even
underestimated by single-reference BLEU scores.
We also applied our models to English–Latvian
and English–Chinese (in both directions) with a
more moderate success. This is not very surpris-
ing for Latvian, for which we only invested about
a week to set up the experiments and to train the
models. For Chinese, manual evaluation will be
important to judge the outcome of our systems
fairly.
