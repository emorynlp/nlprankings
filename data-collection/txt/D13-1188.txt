Abstract

A very valuable piece of information in news-
paper articles is the tonality of extracted state-
ments. For the analysis of tonality of newspa-
per articles either a big human effort is needed,
when it is carried out by media analysts, or an
automated approach which has to be as accu-
rate as possible for a Media Response Anal-
ysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare
several state-of-the-art approaches for Opin-
ion Mining in newspaper articles in this pa-
per. Furthermore, we will introduce a new
technique to extract entropy-based word con-
nections which identifies the word combina-
tions which create a tonality. In the evalua-
tion, we use two different corpora consisting
of news articles, by which we show that the
new approach achieves better results than the
four state-of-the-art methods.

1 Introduction

The Web keeps many potentially valuable opinions
in news articles which are partly new online articles
or uploaded print media articles. Many companies
or organisations such as political parties or even dis-
tinguished public figures perform a Media Response
Analysis (MRA) (Watson and Noble, 2007) in order
to analyse the output of their effort in public rela-
tions. So, an opinion-oriented analysis of news arti-
cles is important, because the tonality (Watson and
Noble, 2007; Scholz et al., 2012a) is the key indi-
cator of a MRA. A purely manual solution implies
a big human effort for so-called media analysts, be-
cause they have to read and rate approx. 200 to 800
news articles each week.

As a consequence, an automated Opinion Mining
solution is very attractive. At the same time, Opin-
ion Mining in newspaper articles appears to be dif-
ficult, because not all parts of news articles are as
subjective (Balahur et al., 2010) as reviews, for ex-
ample. Also, different parts of one article can con-
tain different opinions (Watson and Noble, 2007).
Therefore, we work with extracted statements of
news articles, in which a sequence of consecutive
sentences has the same tonality value. At the same
time, some approaches focus more on differentiating
only between positive and negative news and leave
out neutral examples (Taboada et al., 2011; Scholz et
al., 2012b). Conversely, we have noticed that even if
the used words in the news domain are quite similar,
the tonality which the words express can be differ-
ent, especially if neutral examples are involved (cf.
section 3.1). We propose this task formulation:

Problem definition: Let s ⊆ d be a statement and
document d represents a newspaper article. The task
is to determine the tonality y for a given statement
s, consisting of k words:

t : s = (w1, w2, ..., wk) 7→
y ∈ {positive,neutral,negative} (1)

Normally, a statement consists of one up to four
sentences. But also longer statements are possible,
but they appear less frequently in a MRA. An au-
tomated approach (Scholz and Conrad, 2013) for
the extraction of statements already exists. The ap-
proach applies machine learning to extract relevant
sentences from a collection of news articles and
combine them to statements. So, we concentrate on
the tonality classification, which is not provided by

1828



the approach for the statements extraction (Scholz
and Conrad, 2013). Furthermore, we define the po-
larity of sentiment as the distinction between posi-
tive and negative sentiment and the subjectivity as
the distinction between subjective (positive and neg-
ative) statements and neutral statements.

The following example is a positive statement
from an article in The Telegraph (8th Aug 2012)
which deals with the prospects of British companies
in Africa:

• Example statement (positive): There are
structural factors behind the African growth
story: a growing and sizeable population which
is increasingly urbanised with disposable in-
come; growing political stability; and a finan-
cial services industry that is still in its infancy.

The so-called pressrelations dataset (Scholz et al.,
2012a), which represents a publicly available cor-
pus1 of a MRA on German news articles, contains
1,521 annotated statements. Since this is the only
publicly available corpus of a MRA as far as we
know, we perform our experiments in German. We
are aware of the fact that viewpoints play a signif-
icant role in a newspaper, but since we concentrate
on the determination of the tonality, the extraction of
viewpoints can be solved in a separate step (Scholz
and Conrad, 2012). This is possible, because the
tonality of a statement can be determined without
knowledge of the viewpoint in almost all cases. The
only exception is a statement with multiple view-
points and different tonalities, but these statements
are very rare (cf. also section 4.1).

Our approach learns a graph from an annotated
collection of statements, in which nodes and edges
model tonality-bearing word connections. For un-
seen statements, we recognize subgraphs of the
learned graph, compare two weighting methods for
extracting different tonality features, and classify the
statements by a support vector machine.

In this paper, we describe four state-of-the-art
techniques for Opinion Mining in the next section
about related work. In the third section, we intro-
duce our graph-based and entropy-based approach
to calculate the tonality features T . We will evaluate
our approach against the state-of-the-art methods in
section 4, before we conclude in the last section.

2 Related Work

Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis represent a
broad subject area (Pang and Lee, 2008).

The different contributions reach from applying
Opinion Mining in reviews and recommending new
multimedia products for individuals (Qumsiyeh and
Ng, 2012) to sentiment analyses for different topics
in social media (Wang et al., 2011) or the creation
of sentiment dictionaries (Baccianella et al., 2009).
In this paper, we focus on state-of-the-art methods
for Opinion Mining which differ from each other in
their methodology.

In the news domain, Wilson et al. (2009) de-
veloped a word-based classification approach which
can extract contextual polarity. This method (de-
noted as Wilson) uses a lexicon and POS-tagging
to generate word features and sentence features.
Moreover, it also uses deep natural language anal-
yses with dependency parse trees in order to cal-
culate (general and polarity) modification features
and structure features. Finally, they compute 32 fea-
tures for neutral-polar classification and 10 features
for the polarity classification. These features can be
used by different kinds of machine learning tech-
niques such as Ripper (Cohen, 1996) or BoosTexter
(Schapire and Singer, 2000).

Based on a sentiment lexicon, Taboada et al.
(2011) calculate the semantic orientation of opinion-
bearing words (SO-CAL). They begin with a fine-
grained dictionary of adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and
nouns which have a score from -5 to +5. “Master-
piece” has a score of +5 and “monstrosity” of -5,
for example. In addition, the approach takes inten-
sifiers, negations, and irrealis (Taboada et al., 2011)
into account and thereby modifies the score of the
words through rules and formulas. SO-CAL iden-
tifies some special expressions and constructions,
which tell the reader, that this text part does not re-
ally contain an actual opinion or sentiment. The lin-
guistic term for this situation is called irrealis. Also,
text-level features weight the final score by mere
presence of the words.

In the field of customer reviews, Ding et al.
(2008) also work with a dictionary, which even
includes context-dependent words (positive, neu-
tral, and negative words) as well as rules to iden-
tify the sentiment orientation of words (Opinion

1829



Observer). The rules deal with negations, inter-
sentence conjunctions, but-clauses, and the modifier
“too”. Furthermore, they extract relations between
opinion words and corresponding product features.
Thereby, a detailed analysis of product reviews is
possible.

Sarvabhotla et al. (2011) propose to extract the
subjective excerpt of a text (RSUMM). They con-
struct two word-vectors: An average document fre-
quency vector represents the most important and
most specific word features for the given domain.
Subsequently, an average subjective measure vector
selects the most subjective terms. As a result, they
require hardly any natural language preprocessing
except a sentence splitter and a tokenizer. The fi-
nal classification is accomplished by a SVM (SVM-
Light (Joachims, 1999)).

For product reviews, graph-based approaches
(Goldberg and Zhu, 2006; Wu et al., 2009) can
increase the performance in cross-domain tasks
(Ponomareva and Thelwall, 2012). By contrast, our
graph nodes do not represent documents, but words
to overcome the problem of similar bag-of-words
representations (cf. next section).

One important resource for Opinion Mining in
news is the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005)
which contains word and phrase-based annotation
for 523 news articles. Unfortunately, since the cor-
pus does not have statements and a statement-based
tonality, it is not designed as a MRA. A slightly
larger corpus, the pressrelations dataset (Scholz et
al., 2012a) with 617 articles, is the result of a MRA
in German. We use this corpus as one part of our
evaluation.

3 Learning Tonality with Entropy-based
Word Connections

3.1 Graph Model for Word Connections

To solve the Opinion Mining task for a MRA,
we propose a graph-based approach to capture
the opinion-bearing words and modifiers such as
negations. In this way, our approach is able to
recognize tonality-indicating structures (subgraphs)
which provide precise information about the tonal-
ity, even if statements have a very similar bag-of-
words representation and at the same time different
tonalities. One could also say that we create a graph

instead of a sentiment dictionary from training ex-
amples, as other approaches (Kaji and Kitsuregawa,
2007; Du et al., 2010) proceed.

In figure 1, simple examples are shown with a
possible graph (the nodes and edges are taken from
the given statements; of course, the graphs and
weights become larger in practice). These simple
examples are concentrated on nouns, verbs, and ad-
verbs, but also examples with combinations of other
categories are possible, such as, for example, dif-
ferent combinations of adjectives, nouns, and verbs:
“This is a black day for the company”, “The com-
pany is in the black”, “The company is in the red”
and “The company prevents to be in the red”. Thus,
even though the word representation is quite similar,
the tonality can be different.

For opinion-bearing words, we use adjectives,
nouns, verbs, and adverbs, which are widely ac-
knowledged as opinion-bearing word categories
(Bollegala et al., 2011; Remus et al., 2010; Taboada
et al., 2011). Furthermore, we also include negation
particles. Therefore, the vocabulary V is the set of
words in lemma for one set of statements S. Thus,
for every lemma w ∈ V , the approach creates one
node υ in the graph. A node υ also contains the type
information (adjective, noun, verb, adverb, or nega-
tion).

The edge eij shows the appearance of node υi and
υj in combination with tonality y by means of a
weight εi,j (the sequence of the values in equation
2 is also used in figure 1 and 2).

εij = (yijπ, yijo, yijν) (2)

yijπ is the number of co-occurrences of node υi
and υj in positive statements within the same sen-
tence. In analogy, yijo belongs to sentences of neu-
tral statements and yijν to sentences of negative
statements. Figure 1 shows a small example for this
calculation, too.

3.2 Generating Features for Learning

From a learned graph, we can combine different
edges to calculate tonality features for an unseen
statement s. An unseen statement is a statement,
which is of course not used to learn the graph. We
use all edges of the subgraph Gsl which contains the
nodes for every lemma wi in the l-th sentence of s.

Figure 2: An example of a learned graph: The nodes and
edges, which are drawn in solid lines, represent the recog-
nized subgraph Gsl for the sentence “There are structural
factors behind the African growth story.”.

We explain this with an example. Assuming that
our learned graph is shown in figure 2. It con-
tains seven nodes and nine edges (also the nodes and
edges in dashed lines). If we further assume that an
unseen statement is the example of section 1. To
keep this example short, we take the part until the
colon as the first sentence of the statement: “There
are structural factors behind the African growth
story.”

Our approach recognizes the nodes for “be”,
“structural”, “factors”, “growth”, and “story”. Thus,
the subgraphGsl for the first sentence (l = 0) would
be the graph which is drawn in solid lines in figure 2.
In this example, it is a connected graph, but it does
not have to be.

We could also look for complete or connected
graphs in the statement instead of using all edges.
The largest complete graph would consist of the
nodes “structural”, “factor”, and “be” in our ex-
ample. But using all edges achieves better results,
because this method provides all information. In
addition, this method is quicker (search for largest
complete or connected graph can be omitted, which
would be an additional check).

If we have found our subgraphs Gsl, we can then
compute the vectorial sum of all edges for one node

υi and we get the probability for a tonality y, if we
observe υi in the l-th sentence:

P (pos|υi) =

∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ + yijν
(3)

P (neg|υi) =

∑
eij∈Gsl

yijν∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ + yijν
(4)

P (sub|υi) =

∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ + yijν∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ + yijo + yijν
(5)

P (neu|υi) =

∑
eij∈Gsl

yijo∑
eij∈Gsl

yijπ + yijo + yijν
(6)

For the subjective class (sub), we add the appear-
ance in positive statements (yijπ) and negative state-
ments (yijν). Otherwise we take the appearances in
statements of the same class. The denominators of
the polarity refer only to positive and negative ap-
pearances, while the denominators for the subjectiv-
ity refer to every tonality.

By calculating the vectorial sum, we combine
several edges in order to estimate precise tonality
scores. In this way, we can get the correct tonal-
ity score for the noun “crisis”, if a sentence con-
tains also “solve” and “slowly” (→ more neutral) or
“intensify” (→ more negative) (cf. figure 1). And
we get the correct tonality score for the adjective
“structural”, if a sentence includes also “crisis” (→
negative) or the nodes “factor”, “be”, “growth”, and
“story” (→ positive) (cf. figure 2).

We distinguish between different word categories
(we have noticed that this creates better results than

1831



just having a single feature for one statement). Thus,
every category gets its own feature and every node
only has a tonality value, if it belongs to the category
of the feature. This does not mean that we only con-
sider edges which connect two nodes with the same
category; we divide the influence of different cate-
gories into different features:

Tcat,z(υi) =

{
fz(υi) if υi ∈ cat

0 if υi /∈ cat
(7)

cat ∈ {adj, adv, n, v} indicates the category of
the node (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, or verbs) and
z specifies the type of feature. One type shows
the difference between positive and negative polarity
(z = pol), for the other type we replace the positive
class by the subjective one (the sum of positive and
negative) and the negative by a neutral one in order
to differentiate between neutral and non-neutral ex-
amples (z = sub). As a result, we calculate eight
features (see table 1) for the tonality, two for each
important word category. For the weighting, we ap-
ply and compare two methods, presented in the next
sections.

3.2.1 Kullback-Leibler Weighting
For the final score, we can use the Kullback-

Leibler divergence (relative entropy) (Kullback and
Leibler, 1951) of P2 from P1:

DKL(P1||P2) =
∑
x∈X

P1(x) log
P1(x)

P2(x)
(8)

To measure the information about tonality, we can
define our tonality scores based on the divergence
between the two category pairs:

fpol(υi) = DKL(P (pos|υi)||P (neg|υi)) (9)

fsub(υi) = DKL(P (sub|υi)||P (neu|υi)) (10)

Here, we measure the information lost, if
P (neg|υi) approximates P (pos|υi), for example.
The Kullback-Leibler is an asymmetric measure, so
a switch of the distributions would give a different
result. This is one reason why we prefer our second
method, but we evaluate both in order to find out
how important the choice of the weighting method
is.

3.2.2 Entropy-summand Weighting
Also, the basic idea of the entropy (Shannon,

1948) can be applied to extract the importance of
the edges for the tonality.

H(X) = −
n∑
i=1

p(xi) log2(p(xi)) (11)

Here, the p(xi) refer to the probabilities in the
equations 3 to 6. We add or subtract the entropy-
summand of the assumed tonality class for one node
υi to/from a perfect state (normalized to 1 and -1):

fpol(υi) =


1 + P (pos|υi) ∗ log2(P (pos|υi))

if P (neg|υi) ≤ P (pos|υi)
−1− P (neg|υi) ∗ log2(P (neg|υi))

otherwise
(12)

fsub(υi) =


1 + P (sub|υi) ∗ log2(P (sub|υi))

if P (neu|υi) ≤ P (sub|υi)
−1− P (neu|υi) ∗ log2(P (neu|υi))

otherwise
(13)

In this way, we measure how much disorder one
node υi provides for a certain tonality class. For a
clearly positive node (appears only in positive state-
ments), e.g., the disorder will be 0 and so fpol(υi) =
1 and also fsub(υi) = 1.

3.3 Final Scores and Classification

To compute the eight final features values (four
for each z-class), we calculate the average scores
of all nodes, which share the same category, over
all sentences of the statement. If no nodes/edges
could be recognized in an unseen statement, all fea-
tures would be zero. We use a SVM2 to clas-
sify the statements by the extracted features. This
works according to the one-versus-all strategy for
a non-binary classification, which achieved slightly
better results than a one-versus-one strategy or a
subjective-objective classification first and then a
positive-negative classification. Linear kernels are
used and the parameters are the default ones. This

Tadj,pol: polarity for edges w. adjectives Tadj,sub: subjectivity for edges w. adjectives

Table 1: Polarity and subjectivity features based on word connections

means that every class has the same priority, for in-
stance.

By using only 8 features, we actually achieve bet-
ter results if compared with the use of one edge as
a feature, because we abstract from individual word
combinations in order to prevent overfitting. We will
demonstrate that in section 4, where this method of
using all edges as features is denoted as the graph
edges method. Another positive aspect of restrict-
ing the number of features to a constant limit is that
we save computing time (for the calculation of dis-
tances within machine learning, e.g.), because the
graphs can be large (cf. section 4).

4 Experiments

4.1 Data and Experimental Setup

We use two different datasets for our evaluation: The
pressrelations dataset3 (called PDS) contains 1,521
statements (446 positive, 492 neutral, 583 negative),
and a real world dataset contains 8,500 statements
(2,125 positive, 2,125 negative, 4,250 neutral) from
5,352 news items about a financial service provider,
the so-called Finance dataset. Up to ten media ana-
lysts (professional experts in the field of MRA) an-
notate the extracted statements with a tonality. We
have investigated their inter-annotator agreement.
So, four analysts annotate the same statements from
a small part of the statements. They achieve an
agreement of 81.8% by using the simple accuracy
metric. The PDS has an inter-annotator agreement
of 88.06% (Cohen’s kappa) (Scholz et al., 2012a).
We do not use the viewpoint information contained
in the PDS. This is not a problem, because the tonal-
ity of statements can be estimated without knowl-
edge of the viewpoint in the most cases.

Nevertheless, a statement can have two different
viewpoints in a MRA. This is the case for 116 state-
ments (approx. 7.62%) of the pressrelations dataset

3http://www.pressrelations.de/research/

and 279 statements of the Finance dataset (approx.
3.28%). Statements can have two different tonal-
ities for different viewpoints, but this is rarely the
case (for less than 3.56% of the pressrelations state-
ments and less than 0.17% of the statements of the
Finance dataset). One of these examples is the fol-
lowing statement, which is a translated statement of
the PDS:

• Example: The logical consequence would be
a substantial increase of the subsidies, which
the SPD fraction has demanded several times.
But the government has limited the funding
for 2011 and a too slight rise is planned for
2012. (Code A: positive, SPD; Code B: nega-
tive, CDU)

At the time of the creation of this dataset, the
SPD is the biggest opposing party of the CDU in
Germany. The CDU is the governing party under
its chairwoman Chancellor Merkel. We keep these
statements within the dataset, because this case can
occur in a MRA. However, we will show that this
situation does not irritate our approach too much.

We use approx. 30% of the statements, that is 420
statements (the first 140 positive, neutral, or nega-
tive statements) or 2,500 statements (the first 625
positive or negative and the first 1,250 neutral state-
ments) in order to create our graph (the graph has
41,470 or 154,001 edges, resp.). For POS-tagging,
identification of negations, and lemmatisation, we
apply the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995). Unless oth-
erwise stated, 20% of the remaining statements (220
and 1,200 statements) are the training set for the
SVM and the rest is test set. The size of the test
is so large, because we are aiming at a real signifi-
cance of the solution which can actually be operated
in practice.

4.2 Adapting the State-of-the-Art Approaches
for a German MRA

For the approaches of Ding et al. (2008), Wilson et
al. (2009), and Taboada et al. (2011) we need a sen-
timent dictionary. Thus, we use the same statements
which we use for the creation of our graphs for the
creation of a dictionary as one variant.

To create the lexicon of subjectivity clues for the
method of Wilson et al. (2009), all words which ap-
pear more often in neutral statements get the prior
polarity neutral. For all other words, we calculate
the number of appearances in positive statements
minus the appearances in negative statements di-
vided by all appearances. A positive word has a
value of over 0.2, a negative word has a value of
less than -0.2 and the rest has the prior polarity both.
A positive word with a value above 0.6 belongs to
the reliability class strongsubj, the other positive
words are weaksubj. We treat the negative words
analogously. We use the Stanford Parser for Ger-
man (Rafferty and Manning, 2008) to calculate the
dependency trees for the sentences (Wilson et al.,
2009), in order to extract the General Modification
Features, the Polarity Modification Features and the
Structure Features. The lists of intensifiers, copu-
lar verbs, modals, negations, and polarity shifters
are translated by a domain expert, who also added
such elements which are not direct translations, but
have the same function. The result of this method
is a classification of words and phrases. Thus, for
a statement classification, we classify the words of
the statements and the class of the most frequently
used words is the class of the statement (ambigu-
ous statements are classified as the most frequent
class). According to the authors, we apply the best
machine learning techniques for the word classifica-
tion (BoosTexter for tonality classification and Rip-
per for Subjectivity Analysis with parameters as in
(Wilson et al., 2009)).

For Opinion Observer (Ding et al., 2008), we
also identify neutral words if they appear more often
in neutral than in subjective statements and subjec-
tive words are positive if they appear more often in
positive than in negative statements and vice versa
for negative words. In contrast to Opinion Mining
in customer reviews, we exchange product features
through statements and calculate the orientation of

opinions for all statements with their opinion ori-
entation algorithm. For this purpose, we adapt the
negation rules, the but-clause rule, the inter-sentence
conjunction rule, and the “too” rules for German
(by translating important words such as “but” or the
negations).

SO-CAL (Taboada et al., 2011) needs dictionar-
ies with sentiment values from -5 to +5 with inter-
vals of one. Thus, we use the same scores as the
Wilson method and a word with a value above 0.818
to 1 gets a sentiment score of +5 and so on. This
means, that neutral words also exist. Our domain ex-
pert translated the list of intensifiers (amplifiers and
downtoners) and negations, as well as the expert also
added missing elements. The authors propose two
approaches for the negation search. We use the sec-
ond, more conservative approach, because this ap-
proach works better according to the authors. Also,
we use the value 4 for the negation shift. Further-
more, we implement the algorithm of irrealis block-
ing and translate the list of irrealis markers (modal
verbs, conditional markers, negative polarity items,
private-state verbs (Taboada et al., 2011)).

For all dictionary-based methods (Wilson, Opin-
ion Observer, SO-CAL), we also evaluate an addi-
tional variant which use a sentiment dictionary and
not the statements which we use to construct the
graphs on each fold. We apply the SentiWS (Remus
et al., 2010) for this purpose. As the SentiWS has
sentiment values between −1 and 1, we apply simi-
lar procedures to construct the method-specific dic-
tionaries as described above: For SO-CAL, it is the
same procedure by using the SentiWS values, pos-
itive words has a score above 0.33 for Wilson and
Opinion Observer, strongsubj words have an abso-
lute value above 0.66 and so on. The methods are
denoted as method (dictionary).

RSUMM (Sarvabhotla et al., 2011) needs less
specific adaptation, because only a sentence split-
ter and a tokenizer are needed. So, RSUMM
is very language-independent. We test two ver-
sions of this method: one includes the optimiza-
tion step to estimate the best values for X and Y
(notated as RSUMM(X%, Y%)) and the other ver-
sion (RSUMM(100%)) does without this step, be-
cause we believe that every sentence is important in
the statements and also because more words mean
more information about the tonality in our domain.

We use the sets for the creation of the graphs and
lexicons as the validation dataset (VDS) (Sarvab-
hotla et al., 2011) and the subjectivity dataset (SDS)
(Sarvabhotla et al., 2011). As in (Sarvabhotla et al.,
2011), we apply the SVMLight package4 for classi-
fication.

Opinion Observer (Ding et al., 2008) and SO-
CAL (Taboada et al., 2011) do not use supervised
learning. Therefore, we have also added our SVM in
order to classify the statements based on the scores
of Opinion Observer and SO-CAL (as shown in ta-
bles with (+ SVM)).

4.3 Results

Table 2 and 4 (left side) show the results on the
pressrelations dataset (PDS) and table 3 and 4 (right
side) show the results on Finance. Table 2 and 3
present the tonality classification (positive, neutral,
negative) and table 4 displays the Subjectivity Anal-
ysis (subjective, neutral).

Word connections (Entropy-summand) achieve
the best results with 63.45% accuracy on PDS (more
than 15% better than Wilson, which is the best of the
’classical’ state-of-the-art methods) and best results
on Finance with 65.17% (more than 4% better than
RSUMM, which comes in second). The weight-
ing of the edges through the Entropy-summand per-
forms better than the Kullback-Leibler weighting
on both datasets, so we use the Entropy-summand
weighting for all further experiments.

Also, the improved methods (RSUMM(100%),
Opinion Observer (+ SVM), and SO-CAL(+ SVM))
get better results in the majority of cases (the im-
provement of SO-CAL is more than 13% on PDS
and more than 4% on Finance, e.g.). Furthermore,
the variants of the methods, which are expanded by a
general sentiment dictionary, perform rather worse.
The ’classical’ Opinion Observer performs better
with a general sentiment dictionary, while Wilson
tends to achieve worse results in this variant.

Wilson (without an additional dictionary)
achieves an accuracy of 42.91% on PDS (Subjec-
tivity Analysis 69.36%) and 48.67% on Finance
(Subjectivity Analysis 60.96%) for their word clas-
sification. The accuracy of the dictionary variant is
43.44% on PDS and 40.12% on Finance. Therefore,

4http://svmlight.joachims.org/

the tonality classification by the most frequent word
class seems appropriate for this task and method,
because this method achieves better results in the
classification of statements than on the word level.

The findings of RSUMM are ambiguous. The
’classical’ RSUMM with parameter optimization
does not perform very well on PDS, but it performs
well on Finance with a high proportion of sentences
and words (RSUMM(90%,95%)). Also, if we use
all sentences and all features (RSUMM(100%)) we
obtain better results on Finance and PDS. This fits in
with our assumption that every sentence of a state-
ment is important and that more words lead to more
tonality information. The number of word features
for RSUMM(100%) is 4,985 features for one state-
ment on PDS and 13,608 features on Finance. Af-
ter the parameter optimization the size is 974 word
features on PDS (RSUMM(80%,20%)) and 12,248
features on Finance (RSUMM(90%,95%)).

The outcomes of this study suggest that methods
which include machine learning techniques tend to
perform better than unsupervised techniques. The
results of the approaches which we expand with a
SVM support this conclusion. As mentioned before,
only the graph edges obtain a not so high accuracy.
This shows the importance of the aggregation of the
edges and entropy-based weighting.

We evaluate the influence of the different input
sizes and so we performed experiments with 5%,
10%, 40%, and 80% training for machine learning
as well as 210 and 840 statements for the creation of
dictionaries/graphs on PSD (0.17% training for 210
statements and 0.32% training for 840 statements in
order to create the same size of training according to
the results of 420 statements). The results are shown
in table 5. Opinion Observer and SO-CAL are writ-
ten in italics, because the results on the left side (size
of the training set) belongs to their (+ SVM) variants
and the results on the right side are the ’classical’
methods with no supervised learning. These exper-
iments show that our word connections remain very
stable if the training set is decreased. However, it
does not benefit from more training, especially when
the training set is very large (80%). Opinion Ob-
server and RSUMM(80%,20%) has the same prob-
lem. Nevertheless, it still receives the second-best
results, even if another method gets a higher accu-
racy. However, in our opinion, it is more important

sible practical implementation would not save much
human effort.

4.4 Statistical Significance of the Features

We perform a 10-fold cross validation with our
method, Wilson (as the best ’classical’ state-of-the-
art-method) and SO-CAL (+ SVM) on the pressre-
lations dataset in order to evaluate the contribution
of single tonality features. Our approach (Entropy-
summand with all features) achieves an accuracy of
61.94%, while Wilson gets 56.36% and SO-CAL
46.68%. As an analogy to Wilson et al. (2009),
we carry out a two-sided t-test with Wilson and SO-
CAL (+ SVM) as baselines. The results are shown
in table 6. The pluses indicate a significant increase
to the baseline, the minuses show a significant de-
crease. For one sign, changes are significant at the
level p ≤ 0.1, two signs mean p ≤ 0.05, three signs
p ≤ 0.025, four signs p ≤ 0.01 and five signs in-
dicate p ≤ 0.005. “nsc” stands for no significant
change.

As shown in table 6, the features with type z =
sub are more important than the polarity features. In
the categories, the nouns and verbs are more signifi-
cant than adjectives and adverbs (adverbs are a little
stronger in the polarity difference). Combining all
features produces a very significant increase against
both baselines.

5 Conclusion

We have shown that the word connections outper-
form state-of-the-art-methods in most cases of tonal-
ity classification for a MRA. As a major advantage,
our approach does not need much training data. The
combination of all tonality features is a significant
increase against both baselines, too. The findings
show that the word connections in combination with
the entropy weighting allow to learn the tonality
structure of different word combinations accurately,
even though the training size is small. This is a ma-
jor advantage for a solution, which operates in prac-
tice for media analysts, which have to analyse arti-
cles for a MRA.

So, this approach in combination with an extrac-
tion of statements (Scholz and Conrad, 2013) and
the determination of viewpoints (Scholz and Con-
rad, 2012) represents a fully automated solution in
order to perform Opinion Mining for a MRA.
