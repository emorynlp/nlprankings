Abstract

We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate
computer-generated reading comprehension
questions about Wikipedia articles. Such
application-specific ratings can be used to
train statistical rankers to improve systems’
final output, or to evaluate technologies that
generate natural language. We discuss the
question rating scheme we developed, assess
the quality of the ratings that we gathered
through Amazon Mechanical Turk, and show
evidence that these ratings can be used to im-
prove question generation.

1 Introduction

This paper discusses the use of Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk (MTurk) to rate computer-generated read-
ing comprehension questions about Wikipedia arti-
cles.

We have developed a question generation sys-
tem (Heilman and Smith, 2009; Heilman and
Smith, 2010) that uses the overgenerate-and-rank
paradigm (Langkilde and Knight, 1998). In the
the overgenerate-and-rank approach, many system-
generated outputs are ranked in order to select higher
quality outputs. While the approach has had con-
siderable success in natural language generation
(Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Walker et al., 2001),
it often requires human labels on system output for
the purpose of learning to rank. We employ MTurk
to reduce the time and cost of acquiring these labels.

For many problems, large labeled datasets do not
exist. One alternative is to build rule-based sys-
tems, but it is often difficult and time-consuming
to accurately encode relevant linguistic knowledge
in rules. Another alternative, unsupervised or semi-
supervised learning, usually requires clever formu-
lations of bias that guide the learning process (Car-
roll and Charniak, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995); such

intuitions are not always available. Thus, small,
application-specific labeled datasets, which can be
cheaply constructed using MTurk, may provide con-
siderable benefits by enabling the use of supervised
learning.

In addition to using MTurk ratings to train a
learned ranking component, we could also use
MTurk ratings to evaluate the final top-ranked out-
put of our system. More generally, MTurk can be a
useful evaluation tool for systems that output natu-
ral language (e.g., systems for natural language gen-
eration, summarization, translation). For example,
Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evaluate ma-
chine translations. MTurk facilitates the efficient
measurement and understanding of errors made by
such technologies, and could be used to complement
automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004).

It is true that, for our task, MTurk workers
annotate computer-generated rather than human-
generated natural language. Thus, the data will
not be as generally useful as other types of anno-
tations, such as parse trees, which could be used to
build general purpose syntactic parsers. However,
for the reasons described above, we believe the use
of MTurk to rate computer-generated output can be
useful for the training, development, and evaluation
of language technologies.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: §2 and §3 briefly describe the question gener-
ation system and corpora used in our experiments.
§4 provides the details of our rating scheme. §5 dis-
cusses the quantity, cost, speed, and quality of the
ratings we gathered. §6 presents preliminary experi-
ments showing that the MTurk ratings improve ques-
tion ranking. Finally, in §7, we conclude.

2 Question Generation System

We use MTurk to improve and evaluate a system
for automatic question generation (QG). In our QG
approach, hand-crafted rules transform declarative
sentences from an input text into a large set of ques-
tions (i.e., hundreds per page). This rule system is
complemented by a statistical ranker, which ranks
questions according to their quality. Currently, we
focus on basic linguistic issues and the goal of pro-
ducing acceptable questions—that is, questions that
are grammatical, make sense, and are not vague. We
believe an educator could select and revise output
from the system in order to produce a final set of
high-quality, challenging questions.

Our system is described by Heilman and Smith
(2010). In that work, we employed a differ-
ent scheme involving binary judgments of question
quality according to various factors such as gram-
maticality, vagueness, and others. We also employed
university students as novice annotators. For the
training dataset, only one human rated each ques-
tion. See Heilman and Smith (2009) for more de-
tails.1

3 Corpora

In our experiments, we generated questions from
60 articles sampled from the “featured” articles in
the English Wikipedia2 that have between 250 and
2,000 word tokens. This collection provides expos-
itory texts written at an adult reading level from a
variety of domains, which roughly approximates the
prose that a secondary or post-secondary level stu-
dent would encounter. By choosing from the fea-
tured articles, we intended to select well-edited ar-
ticles about topics of general interest. We then ran-
domly selected 20 questions from each of 60 articles
for labeling with MTurk.3

1We also generated some questions using a technique that
replaces pronouns and underspecified noun phrases with an-
tecedent mentions identified by a coreference resolver. We will
not provide details about this component here because they are
not relevant to our use of MTurk to rate questions. A forthcom-
ing paper will describe these additions.

2The English Wikipedia data were downloaded on Decem-
ber 16, 2008 from http://en.wikipedia.org

3Five questions were later eliminated from this set due to
minor implementation changes, the details of which are unin-
teresting. The final set contained 1,195 questions.

Rating Details
1 Bad The question has major prob-

lems.
2 Unacceptable The question definitely has a

minor problem.
3 Borderline The question might have a

problem, but I’m not sure.
4 Acceptable The question does not have

problems.
5 Good The question is as good as one

that a human teacher might
write for a reading quiz.

4 Rating Scheme

This section describes the rating scheme we de-
veloped for evaluating the quality of computer-
generated questions on MTurk.

Questions were presented independently as sin-
gle human intelligence tasks (HITs). At the top of
the page, raters were given the instructions shown
in Figure 1 along with 7 examples of good and bad
questions with their appropriate ratings. Below the
instructions and examples was an excerpt from the
source text consisting of up to 5 sentences of con-
text, ending with the primary sentence that the ques-
tion was generated from. The question to be rated
then followed.

Below each question was the five-point rating
scale shown in Table 1. Workers were required to
select a single rating by clicking a radio button. At
the bottom of the page, the entire source article text
was given, in case the worker felt it was necessary
to refer back to more context.

We paid 5 cents per rating,4 and each question was
rated by five workers. With the 10% commission
charge by Amazon, each question cost 27.5 cents.

The final rating value was computed by taking
the arithmetic mean of the ratings. Table 2 provides
some examples of questions and their mean ratings.

4.1 Monitoring Turker Ratings

During some pilot tests, we found that it was par-
ticularly important to set some qualification criteria
for workers. Specifically, we only allowed workers

4Given the average time spent per HIT, the pay rate can be
extrapolated to $5–10 per hour.

who had completed at least 50 previously accepted
HITs. We also required that at least 95% of workers’
previous submissions had been accepted.

We also submitted HITs in batches of 100 to 500
so that we could more closely monitor the process.

In addition, we performed a limited amount of
semi-automated monitoring of the ratings, and re-
jected work from workers who were clearly ran-
domly clicking on answers or not following the rat-
ing scheme properly. We tried to err on the side of
accepting bad work. After all ratings for a batch
of questions were received, we calculated for each
worker the number of ratings submitted, the aver-
age time spent on each question, the average rating,
and the correlation of the worker’s rating with the
mean of the other 4 ratings. We used a combination
of these statistics to identify extremely bad workers
(e.g., ones who had negative correlations with other
workers and spent less than 10 seconds per ques-
tion). If some of the ratings for a question were
rejected, then the HIT was “extended” in order to

receive 5 ratings.

5 Quantity, Cost, Speed, and Quality

This section discusses the quantity and quality of the
question ratings we received from MTurk.

5.1 Quantity and Cost of Ratings

We received 5 ratings each for 1,200 questions, cost-
ing a total of $330. 178 workers participated. Work-
ers submitted 33.9 ratings on average (s.d. = 58.0).
The distribution of ratings per worker was highly
skewed, such that a handful of workers submitted
100 or more ratings (max = 395). The ratings from
these who submitted more than 100 ratings seemed
to be slightly lower in quality but still acceptable.
The median number of ratings per worker was 11.

5.2 Speed of Ratings

Ratings were received very quickly once the HITs
were submitted. Figure 2 shows the cumulative
number of ratings received for a batch of questions,

ceived per hour.

5.3 Quality of Ratings

We evaluated inter-rater agreement by having the
first author and an independent judge rate a random
sample of 40 questions from 4 articles. The indepen-
dent judge was a computational linguist. The Pear-
son correlation coefficient between the first author’s
ratings and the mean ratings from MTurk work-
ers was r = 0.79, which is fairly strong though
not ideal. The correlation between the independent
judge’s ratings and the MTurk workers was r =

0.74. These fairly strong positive correlations be-
tween the MTurk ratings and the two human judges
provide evidence that the rating scheme is consis-
tent and well-defined. The results also agree with
Snow et al. (2008), who found that aggregating la-
bels from 3 to 7 workers often provides expert lev-
els of agreement. Interestingly, the agreement be-
tween the two human raters was somewhat lower
(r = 0.65), suggesting that aggregated labels from a
crowd of MTurk workers can be more reliable than
individual humans.5

6 Using Labeled Data to Improve Question
Ranking

In this section, we provide some preliminary results
to demonstrate that MTurk ratings can be used for
learning to rank QG output.

First, we briefly characterize the quality of un-
ranked output. Figure 3 shows a histogram of the
mean MTurk ratings for the 1,195 questions, show-
ing that only a relatively small fraction of the ques-
tions created by the overgenerating steps of our sys-
tem are acceptable: 12.9% when using 3.5 as the
threshold for acceptability.

However, ranking can lead to substantially higher
levels of quality in the top-ranked questions, which

5We also converted the ratings into binary values based on
whether they exceeded a threshold of 3.5. After this conversion
to a nominal scale, we computed a Cohen’s κ of 0.54, which
indicates “moderate” agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).

might be presented first in a user interface. There-
fore, we investigated how many MTurk-rated ques-
tions are needed to train an effective statistical ques-
tion ranker. Our ranking model is essentially the
same as the one used by Heilman and Smith (2010).
Rather than logistic regression, which we used pre-
viously, here we use a linear regression with `2 reg-
ularization to account for the ordinal scale of the av-
eraged question ratings. We set the regularization
parameter through cross-validation with the training
data.

The regression includes all of the features de-
scribed by Heilman and Smith (2010). It includes
features for sentence lengths, whether the question
includes various WH words, whether certain syntac-
tic transformations performed during QG, whether
negation words are present in questions, how many
times various parts of speech appeared, and others.
It also includes some additional coreference features
for parts of speech and lengths of noun phrase men-
tions and their antecedents.6 In all, the ranker in-
cludes 326 features.

For our experiments, we set aside a randomly cho-
sen 200 of the 1,195 rated questions as a test set.
We then trained statistical rankers on randomly sam-
pled subsets of the remaining questions, from size
N = 50 up to N = 995. For each value of N ,
we used the ranker trained on that amount of data
to rank the 200 test questions. We then computed

6Since these additional coreference features are not immedi-
ately relevant to this work, we will not describe them fully here.
A forthcoming paper will describe them in more detail.

the percentage of the top fifth of the ranked test set
questions with a mean rating above 3.5. For each
N less than 995, we repeated the entire sampling,
training, and ranking process 10 times and averaged
the results. (We used the same 200 question test set
throughout the process.)

Figure 4 presents the results, with the acceptabil-
ity of unranked questions (23%) included at N = 0
for comparison. We see that ranking more than dou-
bles the acceptability of the top-ranked questions,
consistent with findings from Heilman and Smith
(2010). It appears that ranking performance im-
proves as more training data are used. When 650 ex-
amples were used, 49% of the top-ranked questions
were acceptable. Ranking performance appears to
level off somewhat when more than 650 training ex-
amples are used. However, we speculate that if the
model included more fine-grained features, the value
of additional labeled data might increase.7

In this paper, we used MTurk to gather quality rat-
ings for computer-generated questions. We pre-

7To directly compare the ranker’s predictions to the correla-
tions presented in §5.3, we computed a correlation coefficient
between the test set ratings from MTurk and the ratings pre-
dicted by the ranker when it was trained on all 995 training ex-
amples. The coefficient was r = 0.36, which is statistically sig-
nificant (p < .001) but suggests that there is substantial room
for improvement in the ranking model.

sented a question rating scheme, and found high lev-
els of inter-rater agreement (r ≥ 0.74) between rat-
ings from reliable humans and ratings from MTurk.
We also showed that ratings can be gathered from
MTurk quickly (more than 1,000 per hour) and
cheaply (less than 30 cents per question).

While ratings of computer-generated language are
not as generally useful as, for example, annotations
of the syntactic structure of human-generated lan-
guage, many research paradigms involving the auto-
matic generation of language may be able to benefit
from using MTurk to quickly and cheaply evaluate
ongoing work. Also, we demonstrated that such rat-
ings can be used in an overgenerate-and-rank strat-
egy to greatly improve the quality of a system’s top-
ranked output.
