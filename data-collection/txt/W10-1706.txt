Abstract

This paper describes a statistical machine
translation system for our participation
for the WMT10 shared task. Based on
MOSES, our system is capable of translat-
ing German, French and Spanish into En-
glish. Our main contribution in this work
is about effective parameter tuning. We
discover that there is a significant perfor-
mance gap as different development sets
are adopted. Finally, ten groups of devel-
opment sets are used to optimize the model
weights, and this does help us obtain a sta-
ble evaluation result.

1 Introduction

We present a machine translation system that rep-
resents our participation for the WMT10 shared
task from Brain-like Computing and Machine In-
telligence Lab of Shanghai Jiao Tong University
(SJTU-BCMI Lab). The system is based on the
state-of-the-art SMT toolkit MOSES (Koehn et al.,
2007). We use it to translate German, French and
Spanish into English. Though different develop-
ment sets used for training parameter tuning will
certainly lead to quite different performance, we
empirically find that the more sets we combine to-
gether, the more stable the performance is, and a
development set similar with test set will help the
performance improvement.

2 System Description

The basic model of the our system is a log-linear
model (Och and Ney, 2002). For given source lan-

obtained by the following equation,

where hm is the m-th feature function and λm is
the m-th model weight. There are four main parts
of features in the model: translation model, lan-
guage model, reordering model and word penalty.
The whole model has been well implemented by
the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation
toolkit MOSES.

For each language that is required to translated
into English, two sets of bilingual corpora are pro-
vided by the shared task organizer. The first set
is the new release (version 5) of Europarl cor-
pus which is the smaller. The second is a com-
bination of other available data sets which is the
larger. In detail, two corpora, europarl-v5 and
news-commentary10 are for German, europarl-v5
and news-commentary10 plus undoc for French
and Spanish, respectively. Details of training data
are in Table 1. Only sentences with length 1 to 40
are acceptable for our task. We used the larger set
for our primary submission.

We adopt word alignment toolkit GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) to learn word-level alignment with
its default setting and grow-diag-final-and param-
eters. Given a sentence pair and its corresponding
word-level alignment, phrases will be extracted by
using the approach in (Och and Ney, 2004). Phrase
probability is estimated by its relative frequency
in the training corpus. Lexical reordering is deter-
mined by using the default setting of MOSES with
msd-bidirectional parameter.

For training the only language model (English),
the data sets are extracted from monolingual parts
of both europarl-v5 and news-commentary10,

which include 1968914 sentences and 47.48M
words. And SRILM is adopted with 5-gram, in-
terpolate and kndiscount settings (Stolcke, 2002)
.

The next step is to estimate feature weights by
optimizing translation performance on a develop-
ment set. We consider various combinations of 10
development sets with 18207 sentences to get a
stable performance in our primary submission.

We use the default toolkits which are provided
by WMT10 organizers for preprocessing (i.e., to-
kenize) and postprocessing (i.e., detokenize, re-
caser).

3 Development Set Selection

3.1 Motivation

Given the previous feature functions, the model
weights will be obtained by optimizing the follow-
ing maximum mutual information criterion, which
can be derived from the maximum entropy princi-
ple:

λ̂M1 = arg max
λM1

{
S∑

i=1

log pλM1 (ti | si)}

As usual, minimum error rate training (MERT) is
adopted for log-linear model parameter estimation
(Och, 2003). There are many improvements on
MERT in existing work (Bertoldi et al., 2009; Fos-
ter and Kuhn, 2009), but there is no demonstration
that the weights with better performance on the
development set would lead to a better result on
the unseen test set. In our experiments, we found
that different development sets will cause signifi-
cant BLEU score differences, even as high as one
percent. Thus the remained problem will be how
to effectively choose the development set to obtain
a better and more stable performance.

3.2 Experimental Settings

Our empirical study will be demonstrated through
German to English translation on the smaller cor-
pus. The development sets are all development
sets and test sets from the previous WMT shared
translation task as shown in Table 2, and labeled
as dev-0 to dev-9. Meanwhile, we denote 10 batch
sets from batch-0 to batch-9 where the batch-i set
is the combination of dev- sets from dev-0 to dev-i.
The test set is newstest2009, which includes 2525
sentences, 54K German words and 58K English
words, and news-test2008, which includes 2051
sentences, 41K German words and 43K English
words.

Table 2: Development data.

3.3 On the Scale of Development Set

Having 20 different development sets (10 dev- sets
and batch- sets), 20 models are correspondingly
trained.The decode results on the test set are sum-
marized in Table 3 and Figure 1. The dotted lines
are the performances of 10 different development
sets on the two test sets, we will see that there
is a huge gap between the highest and the lowest
score, and there is not an obvious rule to follow. It
will bring about unsatisfied results if a poor devel-
opment set is chosen. The solid lines represents
the performances of 10 incremental batch sets on
the two test sets, the batch processing still gives a
poor performance at the beginning, but the results
become better and more stable when the develop-
ment sets are continuously enlarged. This sort of
results suggest that a combined development set
may produce reliable results in the worst case. Our
primary submission used the combined develop-
ment set and the results as Table 4.

3.4 On BLEU Score Difference

To compare BLEU score differences between test
set and development set, we consider two groups
of BLEU score differences, For each development
set, dev-i, the BLEU score difference will be com-
puted between b1 from which adopts itself as the
development set and b2 from which adopts test
set as the development set. For the test set, the
BLEU score difference will be computed between
b′1 from which adopts each development set, dev-i,
as the development set and b′2 from which adopts
itself as the development set.

These two groups of results are illustrated in
Figure 2 (the best score of the test set under self
tuning, newstest2009 is 17.91). The dotted lines
have the inverse trend with the dotted in Figure
1(because the addition of these two values is con-
stant), and the solid lines have the same trend
with the dotted, which means that the good per-
formance is mutual between test set and develop-
ment sets: if tuning using A set could make a good
result over B set, then vice versa.

3.5 On the Similarity between Development
Set and Test Set

This experiment is motivated by (Utiyama et al.,
2009), where they used BLEU score to measure
the similarity of a sentences pair and then ex-
tracted sentences similar with those in test set to

construct a specific tuning set. In our experiment,
we will try to measure data set similarity instead.
Given two sets of sentences, one is called as candi-
date(cnd) set and the other reference(ref) set. For
any cnd sentence, we let the whole ref set to be its
reference and then multi-references BLEU score is
computed for cnd set. There comes a problem that
the sentence penalty will be constant for any cnd
sentence, we turn to calculate the average length
of whose sentences which have common n-gram
with the given cnd sentence.

Now we may define three measures. The mea-
sure which uses dev- and batch- sets as cnd sets
and news-test2009 set as ref set is defined as
precision-BLEU , and the measure which uses the
above sets on the contrary way is defined as recall-
BLEU. Then F1-BLEU is defined as the harmonic
mean of precision-BLEU and recall-BLEU. These
results are illustrated in Figure 3. From the fig-
ure, we find that F1-BLEU plays an important
role to predict the goodness of a development set,
F1-BLEU scores of batch- sets have an ascending
curve and batch data set sequence will cause a sta-
ble good test performance, the point on dev- sets
which has high F1-BLEU(eg, dev-0,4,5) would
also has a good test performance.

3.6 Related Work

The special challenge of the WMT shared task is
domain adaptation, which is a hot topic in recent
years and more relative to our experiments. Many
existing works are about this topic (Koehn and
Schroeder, 2007; Nakov, 2008; Nakov and Ng,
2009; Paul et al., 2009; Haque et al., 2009). How-
ever, most of previous works focus on language

69



model, translation phrase table, lexicons model
and factored translation model, few of them pay
attention to the domain adaptation on the develop-
ment set. For future work we consider to use some
machine learning approaches to select sentences in
development sets more relevant with the test set in
order to further improve translation performance.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we present our machine translation
system for the WMT10 shared task and perform an
empirical study on the development set selection.
According to our experimental results, Choosing
different development sets would play an impor-
tant role for translation performance. We find that
a development set with higher F1-BLEU yields
better and more stable results.
