Abstract

State-of-the-art semantic role labelling
systems require large annotated corpora to
achieve full performance. Unfortunately,
such corpora are expensive to produce and
often do not generalize well across do-
mains. Even in domain, errors are often
made where syntactic information does
not provide sufficient cues. In this pa-
per, we mitigate both of these problems
by employing distributional word repre-
sentations gathered from unlabelled data.
While straight-forward word representa-
tions of predicates and arguments improve
performance, we show that further gains
are achieved by composing representa-
tions that model the interaction between
predicate and argument, and capture full
argument spans.

1 Introduction

The goal of semantic role labelling (SRL) is to
discover the relations that hold between a pred-
icate and its arguments in a given input sen-
tence (e.g., “who” did “what” to “whom”, “when”,
“where”, and “how”). This semantic knowl-
edge at the predicate-argument level is required
by inference-based NLP tasks in order to iden-
tify meaning-preserving transformations, such as
active/passive, verb alternations and nominaliza-
tions. Several manually-build semantic resources,
including FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010)
and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), have been
developed with the goal of documenting and pro-
viding examples of such transformations and how
they preserve semantic role information. Given
that labelled corpora are inevitably restricted in
size and coverage, and that syntactic cues are not
by themselves unambiguous or sufficient, the suc-
cess of systems that automatically provide corre-
sponding analyses has been limited in practice.

Recent work on SRL has explored approaches
that can leverage unlabelled data, following a
semi-supervised (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2012;
Titov and Klementiev, 2012) or unsupervised
learning paradigm (Abend et al., 2009; Titov and
Klementiev, 2011). Unlabelled data provides ad-
ditional statistical strength and can lead to more
consistent models. For instance, latent representa-
tions of words can be computed, based on distri-
butional similarity or language modelling, which
can be used as additional features during tradi-
tional supervised learning. Although we would
expect that extra features would improve classifier
performance, this seems in part counter-intuitive.
Just because one word has a specific representa-
tion does not mean that it should be assigned a
specific argument label. Instead, one would ex-
pect a more complex interplay between predicate,
argument and the context they appear in.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of dis-
tributional word representations for SRL. Initially,
we augment the feature space with word repre-
sentations for a predicate and its argument head.
Furthermore, we use a compositional approach to
model a representation of the full argument, by
composing a joint representation of all words in
the argument span, and we also investigate the in-
teraction between predicate and argument, using
a compositional representation of the dependency
path. We demonstrate the benefits of these com-
positional features using a state-of-the-art seman-
tic role labeller, which we evaluate on the English
part of the CoNLL-2009 data set.

2 Related Work

Research into using distributional information
in SRL dates back to Gildea and Jurafsky
(2002), who used distributions over verb-object
co-occurrence clusters to improve coverage in ar-
gument classification. The distribution of a word
over these soft clusters assignments was added as

407



features to their classifier. The SRL system by
Croce et al. (2010) combines argument clustering
based on co-occurrence frequencies with a lan-
guage model. Collobert et al. (2011) used dis-
tributional word representations in a neural net-
work model that can update representations dur-
ing training. Zapirain et al. (2013) suggested dis-
tributional information as a basis for a selectional
preference model that can be used as a single addi-
tional feature for classifying potential arguments.
Most recently, Hermann et al. (2014) used distri-
butional word representations within pre-defined
syntactic contexts as input to a classifier which
learns to distinguish different predicate senses.

A complementary line of research explores the
representation of sequence information. Promi-
nent examples are the works by Deschacht and
Moens (2009) and Huang and Yates (2010) who
learned and applied Hidden Markov Models to
assign state variables to words and word spans,
which serve as supplementary features for classifi-
cation. One drawback of this approach is that state
variables are discrete and the number of states
(i.e., their granularity) has to be chosen in advance.

The popularity of distributional methods for
word representation has been a motivation for de-
veloping representations of larger constructions
such as phrases and sentences, and there have
been several proposals for computing the meaning
of word combinations in vector spaces. Mitchell
and Lapata (2010) introduced a general frame-
work where composition is formulated as a func-
tion f of two vectors u and v. Depending on
how f is chosen, different composition models
arise, the simplest being an additive model where
f(u, v) = u + v. To capture relational functions,
Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) expanded on this
approach by representing verbs, adjectives and ad-
verbs by matrices which can modify the properties
of nouns (represented by vectors). Socher et al.
(2012) combined word representations with syn-
tactic structure information, through a recursive
neural network that learns vector space represen-
tations for multi-word phrases and sentences. An
empirical comparison of these composition meth-
ods was provided in (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012).

In this work, we use type-based continuous rep-
resentations of words to compose representations
of multiple word sequences and spans, which can
then be incorporated directly as features into SRL
systems.

3 Method

Following the set-up of the CoNLL shared task
in 2009, we consider predicate-argument struc-
tures that consist of a verbal or nominal pred-
icate p and PropBank-labelled arguments ai ∈
{a1 . . . an}, where each ai corresponds to the head
word of the phrase that constitutes the respective
argument. Traditional semantic role labelling ap-
proaches compute a set of applicable features on
each pair 〈p, ai〉, such as the observed lemma type
of a word and the grammatical relation to its head,
that serve as indicators for a particular role label.

The disadvantage of this approach lies in the
fact that indicator features such as word and
lemma type are often sparse in training data and
hence do not generalize well across domains. In
contrast, features based on distributional represen-
tations (e.g., raw co-occurrence frequencies) can
be computed for every word, given that it occurs
in some unlabelled corpus. In addition to this ob-
vious advantage for out-of-domain settings, dis-
tributional representations can provide a more ro-
bust input signal to the classifier, for instance by
projecting a matrix of co-occurrence frequencies
to a lower-dimensional space. We hence hypoth-
esize that such features enable the model to be-
come more robust out-of-domain, while providing
higher precision in-domain.

Although simply including the components of
a word representation as features to a classifier
can lead to immediate improvements in SRL per-
formance, this observation seems in part counter-
intuitive. Just because one word has a specific
representation does not mean that it should be as-
signed a specific argument label. In fact, one
would expect a more complex interplay between
the representation of an argument ai and the con-
text it appears in. To model aspects of this inter-
play, we define an extended set of features that

408



further includes representations for the combina-
tion of p and ai, the set of words in the depen-
dency path between p and ai, and the set of words
in the full span of ai. We compute additive com-
positional representations of multiple words, us-
ing the simplest method of Mitchell and Lapata
(2010) where the composed representation is the
uniformly weighted sum of each single represen-
tation. Our full set of feature types based on distri-
butional word representations is listed in Table 1.

4 Experimental Setup

We evaluate the impact of different types of fea-
tures by performing experiments on a benchmark
dataset for semantic role labelling. To assess the
gains of distributional representations realistically,
we incorporate the features described in Section 3
into a state-of-the-art SRL system. The follow-
ing paragraphs summarize the details of our ex-
perimental setup.

Semantic Role Labeller. In all our experi-
ments, we use the publicly available system by
Björkelund et al. (2010).1 This system com-
bines the first-ranked SRL system and the first-
ranked syntactic parser in the CoNLL 2009 shared
task for English (Björkelund et al., 2009; Bohnet,
2010). To the best of our knowledge, this
combination represents the current state-of-the-art
for semantic role labelling following the Prop-
Bank/NomBank paradigm (Palmer et al., 2005;
Meyers et al., 2004). To re-train and evaluate mod-
els with different feature sets, we use the same
training, development and test sets as provided
in the CoNLL shared task (Hajič et al., 2009).
Although the employed system features a full
syntactic-semantic parsing pipeline, we only mod-
ify the feature sets of the two components directly
related to the actual role labelling task, namely ar-
gument identification and argument classification.

Word Representations. As a baseline, we sim-
ply added as features the word representations of
the predicate and argument head involved in a
classification decision (first two lines in Table 1).
We experimented with a range of publicly avail-
able sets of word representations, including em-
beddings from various neural language models

post-processed co-occurrence counts (Lebret and
Collobert, 2014). Results on the development set
for various off-the-shelf representations are shown
in Table 2. The numbers reveal that any kind of
word representation can be employed to improve
results. We choose to perform all follow-up exper-
iments using the 50-dimensional embeddings in-
duced by Turian et al. (2010), using the method by
Collobert et al., as they led to slightly better results
in F1-score than other representations. No signif-
icant differences were observed, however, using
other types of representations or vector sizes.

5 Results

We evaluate our proposed set of additional fea-
tures on the CoNLL-2009 in-domain and out-of-
domain test sets, using the aforementioned SRL
system and word representations. All results are
computed using the system’s built-in preprocess-
ing pipeline and re-trained models for argument
identification and classification. We report la-
belled precision, recall and semantic F1-score as
computed by the official scorer.

The upper part of Table 3 shows SRL perfor-
mance on the in-domain CoNLL-2009 test set,
with and without (Original) additional features
based on distributional representations. The re-
sults reveal that any type of additional feature
helps to improve precision and recall in this setting
(from 85.2% F1-score up to 85.5%), with signifi-
cant gains for 4 of the 5 additional features (com-
puted using a randomization test; cf. Yeh, 2000).
Interestingly, we find that the features do not seem

to have a cumulative effect here, as indicated by
the results with all features (+All, 85.5% F1). We
conjecture that this is due to the high volume of
existing in-domain training data, which renders
our full feature set redundant. To test this conjec-
ture, we further assess performance on the out-of-
domain test set of the CoNLL-2009 shared task.

The results for the out-of-domain experiment
are summarized in the lower part of Table 3.
We again observe that each single feature type
improves classification, with absolute gains be-
ing slightly higher than in the in-domain setting.
More interestingly though, we find that the com-
plete feature set boosts performance even further,
achieving an overall gain in precision and recall
of 0.6 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively. The
resulting F1-score of 75.2 lies even higher than the
top score for this particular data set reported in the
CoNLL shared task (Zhao et al., 2009; 74.6 F1).

We next investigate the benefits of compo-
sitional representations over features for single
words by assessing their impact on the overall re-
sult in an ablation study. Table 4 shows results
of ablation tests performed for the three composi-
tional feature types Interaction, Span and Path
on the out-of-domain test set. The results reveal

a considerable loss in recall, indicating the impor-
tance of including compositional word represen-
tations and confirming our intuition that they can
provide additional gains over simple type-level
representations. In the next section, we discuss
this result in more detail and provide examples of
improved classification decisions.

6 Discussion

As a more detailed qualitative analysis, we exam-
ined the impact of word representations on SRL
performance with respect to different argument la-
bels and predicate types. Results on the in-domain
data set, shown in the upper part of Table 5, sug-
gest that most improvements in terms of preci-
sion are gained for verbal predicates, while nom-
inal predicates primarily benefit from higher re-
call. One reason for the latter observation might
be that arguments of nominal predicates are gen-
erally much harder to identify for the Original
model, as the cues provided by indicator features
on words and syntax are often inconclusive. For
verbal predicates, the word representations mainly
provide reinforcing signals to the classifier, im-
proving its precision at a slight cost of recall.

The results on the out-of-domain data set pro-
vide more insights regarding the suitability of
word representations for generalization. As shown
in the lower half of Table 5, the additional features
on average have a positive impact on precision and
recall. For verbal predicates, we observe only one
case, namely A0, in which improvements in recall
came with a decline in precision. Regarding nomi-
nal predicates, the trend is similar to what we have
seen in the in-domain setting, with most gains be-
ing achieved in terms of recall.

Apart from assessing quantitative effects, we
further examined cases that directly show the qual-
itative gains of the compositional features defined

in Section 3. Table 6 lists examples from the
out-of-domain data set that were misclassified by
the Original model but could be correctly pre-
dicted using our enhanced feature set. As illus-
trated by Examples (1) and (2), the Interaction
feature seems to help recall by guiding classifica-
tion decisions towards more meaningful and com-
plete structures.

Improvements using the Path feature can be ob-
served in cases where nested syntactic structures
need to be processed, as required in Example (2).
In another instance, Example (3), the following
path is predicted between argument and predicate:
He SBJ−→ rose COORD←−−−and CONJ←−−went OPRD←−− to IM←−have.

Such cases are particularly problematic for the
Original model because long and potentially er-
roneous paths are sparse in the training data.

Further gains in performance are achieved using
the Span feature, which enables the model to bet-
ter handle infrequent and out-of-vocabulary words
occurring in an argument span, including “hours”
and “softly” in Example (4) and (5), respectively.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed to enhance the feature
space of a state-of-the-art semantic role labeller by
applying and composing distributional word rep-
resentations. Our results indicate that combining
such features with standard syntactic cues leads to
more precise and more robust models, with sig-
nificant improvements both in-domain and out-of-
domain. Ablation tests on an out-of-domain data
set have shown that gains in recall are mostly due
to features based on composed representations.
Given the novelty of these features for SRL, we
believe that this insight is remarkable and deserves
further investigation. In future work, we plan to
apply more sophisticated models of composition-
ality to better represent predicate-argument struc-
tures and to guide classification decisions towards
outcomes that are semantically more plausible.
We anticipate that this line of research will also be
of interest for a range of related tasks beyond tra-
ditional SRL, including predicate-argument struc-
ture alignment (Roth and Frank, 2012) and im-
plicit argument linking (Gerber and Chai, 2012).
