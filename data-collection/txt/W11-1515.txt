Abstract

While the study of the connection between
discourse patterns and personal identification
is decades old, the study of these patterns us-
ing language technologies is relatively recent.
In that more recent tradition we frame author
age prediction from text as a regression prob-
lem. We explore the same task using three
very different genres of data simultaneously:
blogs, telephone conversations, and online fo-
rum posts. We employ a technique from do-
main adaptation that allows us to train a joint
model involving all three corpora together as
well as separately and analyze differences in
predictive features across joint and corpus-
specific aspects of the model. Effective fea-
tures include both stylistic ones (such as POS
patterns) as well as content oriented ones. Us-
ing a linear regression model based on shallow
text features, we obtain correlations up to 0.74
and mean absolute errors between 4.1 and 6.8
years.

1 Introduction

A major thrust of research in sociolinguistics is to
understand the connection between the way peo-
ple use language and their community membership,
where community membership can be construed
along a variety of dimensions, including age, gen-
der, socioeconomic status and political affiliation. A
person is a member of a multiplicity of communi-
ties, and thus the person’s identity and language are
influenced by many factors.

In this paper we focus on the relationship between
age and language use. Recently, machine learning

methods have been applied to determine the age of
persons based on the language that they utter. Stud-
ies of the stylistic and content-based features that
predict age or other personal characteristics yield
new insights into the connection between discourse
and identity. However, that connection is known to
be highly contextual, such as whether the data were
collected synchronously or asynchronously, through
typed or spoken interaction, or whether participants
can see one another or not. Recent work in the area
of domain adaptation raises awareness about the ef-
fect of contextual factors on the generality of text
prediction models.

Our first contribution to this literature is an in-
vestigation of age prediction using a multi-corpus
approach. We present results and analysis across
three very different corpora: a blog corpus (Schler
et al., 2006), a transcribed telephone speech corpus
(Cieri et al., 2004) and posts from an online forum
on breast cancer. By using the domain adaptation
approach of Daumé III (2007), we train a model on
all these corpora together and separate the global
features from corpus-specific features that are asso-
ciated with age.

A second contribution is the investigation of age
prediction with age modeled as a continuous vari-
able rather than as a categorical variable. Most
prior research on age prediction has framed this as a
two-class or three-class classification problem (e.g.,
Schler et al., 2006 and Garera and Yarowsky, 2009).
In our work, modeling age as a continuous variable
is interesting not only as a more realistic representa-
tion of age, but also for practical benefits of joint
modeling of age across corpora since the bound-

115



aries for discretizing age into a categorical variable
in prior work have been chosen heuristically and in
a corpus-dependent way, making it hard to compare
performance across different kinds of data.

In the remainder of the paper, we first discuss re-
lated work and present and compare the different
datasets. We then outline our approach and results.
We conclude with discussion and future work.

2 Related work

Time is an important factor in sociolinguistic analy-
sis of language variation. While a thorough review
of this work is beyond the scope of this paper, Eckert
(1996) gives an overview of the literature on age as
a sociolinguistic variable. Linguistic variation can
occur as an individual moves through life, or as a re-
sult of changes in the community itself as it moves
through time. As an added complexity, Argamon et
al. (2007) found connections between language vari-
ation and age and gender. Features that were used
with increasing age were also used more by males
for any age. Features that were used with decreas-
ing age were used more by females. In other work,
the same features that distinguish male and female
writing also distinguish non-fiction and fiction (Arg-
amon et al., 2003). Thus, the separate effects of age,
time period, gender, topic, and genre may be diffi-
cult to tease apart in naturalistic data where many of
these variables are unknown.

Recently, machine learning approaches have been
explored to estimate the age of an author or speaker
using text uttered or written by the person. This
has been modeled as a classification problem, in a
similar spirit to sociolinguistic work where age has
been investigated in terms of differences in distri-
butions of characteristics between cohorts. In the
sociolinguistic literature, cohorts such as these are
determined either etically (arbitrary, but equal age
spans such as decades) or emically (related to life
stage, such as adolescence etc.). In machine learn-
ing research, these cohorts have typically been deter-
mined for practical reasons relating to distribution of
age groups within a corpus, although the boundaries
sometimes have also made sense from a life stage
perspective. For example, researchers have mod-
eled age as a two-class classification problem with
boundaries at age 40 (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009)

or 30 (Rao et al., 2010). Another line of work has
looked at modeling age estimation as a three-class
classification problem (Schler et al., 2006; Goswami
et al., 2009), with age groups of 13-17, 23-27 and
33-42. In addition to machine learning experiments,
other researchers have published statistical analyses
of differences in distribution related to age and lan-
guage and have found similar patterns.

As an example of one of these studies, Pen-
nebaker and Stone (2003) analyzed the relationship
between language use and aging by collecting data
from a large number of previous studies. They
used LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) for analysis.
They found that with increasing age, people tend to
use more positive and fewer negative affect words,
more future-tense and less past-tense, and fewer
self-references. Furthermore, a general pattern of
increasing cognitive complexity was seen. Barbieri
(2008) uses key word analysis to analyze language
and age. Two groups (15–25 and 35–60) were com-
pared. Analysis showed that younger speakers’ talk
is characterized by slang and swear words, indica-
tors of speaker stance and emotional involvement,
while older people tend to use more modals.

Age classification experiments have been con-
ducted on a wide range of types of data, in-
cluding blogs (Schler et al., 2006; Goswami et
al., 2009), telephone conversations (Garera and
Yarowsky, 2009), and recently Twitter (Rao et al.,
2010). Effective features were both content fea-
tures (such as unigrams, bigrams and word classes)
as well as stylistic features (such as part-of-speech,
slang words and average sentence length). These
separate published studies present some common-
alities of findings. However, based on these re-
sults from experiments conducted on very different
datasets, it is not possible to determine how gener-
alizable the models are. Thus, there is a need for an
investigation of generalizability specifically in the
modeling of linguistic variation related to age, which
we present in this paper.

Age classification from speech data has been of
interest for many years. Recently, age regression us-
ing speech features has been explored (Spiegl et al.,
2009). Spiegel’s system obtained a mean absolute
error of approximately 10 years using support vec-
tor regression. Van Heerden et al. (2010) explore
combining regression estimates to improve age clas-

116



sification. As far as we are aware, we are the first to
publish results from a regression model that directly
predicts age using textual features.

3 Data description

We explore three datasets with different characteris-
tics. The data was divided into a training, develop-
ment and test set. Statistics are listed in Table 1.

3.1 Blog corpus

In August 2004 Schler et al. (2006) crawled blogs
from blogger.com. Information such as gen-
der and age were provided by the users in their re-
spective profiles. Users were divided into three age
groups, and each group had an equal number of fe-
male and male bloggers. In our experiments, ev-
ery document consists of all posts from a particular
blogger.

3.2 Fisher telephone corpus

The Fisher corpus (Cieri et al., 2004) contains tran-
scripts of telephone conversations. People were ran-
domly assigned to pairs, and for (almost) every per-
son, characteristics such as gender and age were
recorded. Furthermore, for each conversation a topic
was assigned. The data was collected beginning De-
cember 2002 and continued for nearly one year. In
our experiments, we aggregate the data for each per-
son.

3.3 Breast cancer forum

We drew data from one of the most active online fo-
rums for persons with breast cancer.1 All posts and
user profiles of the forum were crawled in January
2011. Only a small proportion of users had indicated
their age in their profile. We manually annotated the
age of approximately 200 additional users with less
common ages by looking manually at their posts. An
author’s age can often be annotated because users
tend to make references to their age when they intro-
duce themselves or when telling their treatment his-
tory (e.g., I was diagnosed 2 years ago when I was
just 38). Combining this with the date of the specific
post, a birth year can be estimated. Because a per-
son’s data can span multiple years, we aggregate all
the data per year for each person. Each person was

assigned randomly to one of the data splits, to make
sure all documents representing the same person ap-
peared in only one split. The dataset contains posts
from October 2002 until January 2011.

3.4 Dataset comparison and statistics

The datasets differ in several respects: specificity
(general topics versus breast cancer), modality of in-
teraction (telephone conversations versus online fo-
rum versus blog post), age distribution, and amount
of data per person. The blog and Fisher dataset con-
tain approximately equal amounts of males and fe-
males, while the breast cancer dataset is heavily bi-
ased towards women.

A comparison of the age distributions of the three
corpora is given in Figure 1. The Fisher dataset
has the most uniform distribution across the ages,
while the blog data has a lot of young persons and
the breast cancer forum has a lot of older people.
The youngest person in our dataset is 13 years old
and the oldest is 88. Note that our blog corpus con-
tains gaps between different age categories, which
is an artifact of the experimental approach used by
the people who released this dataset (Schler et al.,
2006).

Because all datasets were created between 2002
and 2011, we are less likely to observe results due to
cohort effects (changes that occur because of collec-
tive changes in culture, such as use of the Internet).

4 Experimental setup

4.1 Linear regression

Given an input vector x ∈ Rm, where x1, . . . , xm
represent features (also called independent variables
or predictors), we find a prediction ŷ ∈ R for the age
of a person y ∈ R using a linear regression model:
ŷ = β0 + x

>β where β0 and β are the parame-
ters to estimate. Usually, the parameters are learned
by minimizing the sum of squared errors. In order
to strive for a model with high explanatory value,
we use a linear regression model with Lasso (also
called L1) regularization (Tibshirani, 1996). This
minimizes the sum of squared errors, but in addition
adds a penalty term λ

∑m
j=1 |βj |. λ is a constant and

can be found by optimizing over the development
data. As a result, this method delivers sparse mod-
els. We use OWLQN to optimize the regularized
empirical risk (Andrew and Gao, 2007; Gao et al.,
2007). We evaluate the models by reporting the cor-
relation and mean absolute error (MAE).

4.2 Joint model

To discover which features are important across
datasets and which are corpus-specific, we train a
model on the data of all corpora using the feature
representation proposed by Daumé III (2007). Using
this model, the original feature space is augmented
by representing each individual feature as 4 new fea-
tures: a global feature and three corpus-specific fea-
tures, specifically one for each dataset. Thus for ev-
ery feature f , we now have fglobal , fblogs , ffisher and
fcancer . For every instance, only the global and the
one specific corpus feature are set. For example for
a particular feature value xj for the blog dataset we
would have 〈xj , xj , 0, 0〉. If it would appear in the
cancer dataset we would have 〈xj , 0, 0, xj〉. Because
the resulting model using L1 regression only selects
a small subset of the features, some features may
only appear either as global features or as corpus-

specific features in the final model.

4.3 Overview different models
Besides experimenting with the joint model, we are
also interested in the performance using only the dis-
covered global features. This can be achieved by ap-
plying the weights for the global features directly as
learned by the joint model, or retraining the model
on the individual datasets using only the global fea-
tures. In summary, we have the following models:

• INDIV: Models trained on the three corpora in-
dividually.

• JOINT: Model trained on all three corpora with
features represented as in Daumé III (2007).

• JOINT-Global: Using the learned JOINT
model but only keeping the global features.

• JOINT-Global-Retrained: Using the discov-
ered global features by the JOINT model, but
retrained on each specific dataset.

4.4 Features
4.4.1 Textual features

We explore the following textual features; all fea-
tures are frequency counts normalized by the length
(number of tokens) of the document.

• Unigrams.

• POS unigrams and bigrams. Text is tagged us-
ing the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al.,
2003).

• LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001). This is a word
counting program that captures word classes
such as inclusion words (LIWC-incl: “with,”
“and,” “include,” etc.), causation words (LIWC-
cause: “because,” “hence,” etc.), and stylis-
tic characteristics such as percentage of words
longer than 6 letters (LIWC-Sixltr).

4.4.2 Gender
Because the gender of a person also influences

how age is reflected in a person’s text or speech (e.g.
Argamon et al. (2007) ), we add a binary feature for
the gender of the person (Male = 1, Female = 0).
This feature is only known for the blog and Fisher
dataset. For the breast cancer dataset the gender is
not known, but we assume they are all women.

5 Results and discussion

As discussed, we experiment with four different
models. We explore three different feature sets: only
unigrams, only POS, and the full feature set. The re-
sults are presented in Table 2. The most important
features using the JOINT model with the full feature
set (condition 10) are presented in Table 3.

5.1 Quantitative analysis

Overall, similar performance is obtained on the
Fisher and blog datasets. The highest correlations
were achieved on the Fisher dataset, with a best cor-
relation of r = 0.742. This gives an r2 value of
0.551, indicating that 55% of the variance can be
explained by the model. However, a higher mean
absolute error (MAE) was observed compared to
the blog dataset. This may be caused by the larger
spread in distribution of ages in the Fisher dataset.
The lowest correlations were observed on the cancer
dataset. This is probably caused by the small amount

of training instances, the noisy text, and the fact that
the ages lie very close to each other.

Overall, the joint model using all features per-
formed best (condition 10). In Figure 2 a plot is
presented that relates the true and predicted ages for
this condition. We find that for the high ages there
are more instances with high errors, probably caused
by the small amount of training data for the extreme
ages.

We find the correlation metric to be very sensitive
to the amount of data. For example, when comput-
ing the correlation over the aggregated results of all
corpora, we get a much higher correlation (0.830),
but the MAE (5.345) is closer to that computed over
the individual datasets. However, the MAE is de-
pendent on the age distributions in the corpus, which
can be observed by contrasting the MAE on the runs
of the Fisher and cancer dataset. This thus suggests
that these two measures are complementary and both
are useful as evaluation metrics for this task.

For most experiments the joint models show im-
provement over the individual models. Returning
to our question of generality, we can make several
observations. First, performance decreases signif-
icantly when only using the global features (com-
paring JOINT and JOINT-Global-retrained), con-
firming that corpus-specific features are important.
Second, learned weights of global features are rea-
sonably generalizable. When using the full feature
set, retraining the global features on the corpora di-
rectly only gives a slight improvement (e.g. com-
pare conditions 11 and 12). Third, the bias term
(β0) is very corpus-specific and has a big influence
on the MAE. For example, when comparing condi-
tions 11 and 12, the correlations are very similar but
the MAEs are much lower when the model is re-
trained. This is a result of adjusting the bias term
to the specific dataset. For example the bias term of
the model trained on only the blog dataset is 22.45,
compared to the bias of 46.11 when trained on the
cancer dataset.

In addition, we observe better performance in the
cancer dataset when retraining the model using only
the global features compared to the initial feature
set. This suggests that using the global features
might have been an effective method for feature se-
lection to prevent overfitting on this small dataset.

5.2 Feature analysis

The most important features using the JOINT model
with the full feature set (condition 10) are presented
in Table 3. Features associated with a young age
have a negative weight, while features associated
with old age have a positive weight. For almost all
runs and evaluation metrics the full feature set gives
the best performance. However, looking at the per-
formance increase, we observe that the unigram only
baseline gives strong results. Overall, both stylistic
as well as content features are important. For con-
tent features, we see that references to family (e.g.,
“granddaughter” versus “son”) as well as to daily
life (e.g., “school” versus “job”) are very predictive.

Although the performance using only POS tags
is lower, reasonable correlations are obtained using
only POS tags. In Table 3 we see many POS features
associated with old age. This is confirmed when an-
alyzing the whole feature set selected by the JOINT
model (condition 10). In this model 510 features are
nonzero, 161 of which are POS patterns. Of these,
43 have a negative weight, and 118 have a positive
weight. This thus again suggests that old age is char-
acterized more by syntactic effects than young age.

Most important features are consistent with obser-
vations from previous research. For example, in the
Fisher dataset, similar to findings from classification

experiments by Garera and Yarowsky (2009), the
word “well” is most predictive of older age. “Like”
has the highest association with younger age. This
agrees with observations by Barbieri (2008). As
was also observed by others, “just” is highly associ-
ated with young persons. Consistent with literature
that males generally “sound older” than they truly
are (Argamon et al., 2007, and others), our male
speaker feature has a high negative weight. And, in
agreement with previous observations, younger peo-
ple use more swear words and negative emotions.

The differences between the corpora are reflected
in the features that have the most weight. The effec-
tive features in the Fisher dataset are more typical
of conversational settings and effective features in
the cancer dataset are about being pregnant and hav-
ing kids. Features associated with the blog dataset
are typical of the story telling nature of many blog
posts.

Comparing the extracted corpus-specific features
with the features selected when training on the indi-
vidual corpora, we do see evidence that the JOINT
model separates general versus specific features.
For example, the most important features associ-
ated with young people in the cancer dataset when
only training on the cancer dataset (condition 9)
are: LIWC - Emoticons, LIWC - Pronoun, definitely,

mom, mum, really, LIWC - Family, LIWC - Humans,
thank, and she. The difference in age distribution is
reflected in the feature weights. In the JOINT model,
the bias term is 24.866. Because most of the persons
in the cancer dataset are older, the features associ-
ated with young age in the cancer dataset have much
lower weights compared to the other datasets.

Because our goal is to compare features across
the corpora, we have not exploited corpus-specific
features. For example, thread or subforum features
could be used for the breast cancer corpus, and for
the Fisher dataset, one could add features that ex-
ploit the conversational setting of the data.

5.3 Examples

We present examples of text of younger and older
persons and connect them to the learned model.
The examples are manually selected to illustrate
strengths and weaknesses of the model.

5.3.1 Younger people
We first present some examples of text by young

persons. The following is an example of a 17-year
old in the blog dataset, the system predicted this to
be from a 16.48-year-old:

I can’t sleep, but this time I have school
tommorow, so I have to try I guess. My
parents got all pissed at me today because
I forgot how to do the homework [...]. Re-
ally mad, I ended it pissing off my mom
and [...] NOTHING! Damn, when I’m at
my cousin’s I have no urge to use the com-
puter like I do here, [...].

This example matches with important features de-
termined by the system, containing references to
school and parents, and usage of swearing and anger
words.

121



The following are selected turns (T) by a 19-year
old (system prediction: 17.37 years) in a conversa-
tion in the Fisher dataset.

T: yeah it’s too i just just freaked out [...]
T: that kinda sucks for them
T: they were they were like going crazy
[...]
T: it’s like against some law to like

The text has many informal words such as “kinda”
and well as many occurrences of the word “like.”

This example is from a 19-year old from the can-
cer dataset. The system’s prediction was far off, es-
timating an age of 35.48.

Im very young and an athlete and I really
do not want to look disfigured, especially
when I work so hard to be fit. I know it
sounds shallow, but Im young and hope
to [...] my husband one day :) [...] My
grandmother died of breast cancer at 51,
and my mother is currently dealing with a
cancerous tumor on her ovaries.

Besides explicit references to being “very young,”
the text is much more formal than typical texts, mak-
ing it a hard example.

5.3.2 Older people
The following is a snippet from a 47-year-old

(system prediction: 34.42 years) in the blog dataset.

[...]In the weeks leading up to this meet-
ing certain of the managers repeatedly as-
serted strong positions. [...] their previous
(irresponsible yet non-negotiable) opin-
ions[...] Well, today’s my first Father’s
day [...]. Bringing a child into this world
is quite a responsibility especially with all
the fears and challenges we face. [...]

This matches some important features such as ref-
erences to jobs, as well as having kids. The many
references to the word “father” in the whole text
might have confused the model. The following are
selected turns (T) by a 73-year old (system predic-
tion: 73.26 years) in a conversation in the Fisher
dataset.

T: ah thoughts i’m retired right now
T: i i really can’t ah think of anyth- think
of i would ah ah change considerably ah
i’m i’m very i’ve been very happily mar-
ried and i have ah three children and six
grandchildren
T: yeah that’s right well i i think i would do
things more differently fair- fairly recently
than a long time ago

This example contains references to being retired
and having grandchildren, as well as many usages
of “ah”. The following is an example of a 70-year
old (system prediction: 71.53 years) in the cancer
dataset.

[...] I was a little bit fearful of having
surgery on both sides at once (reduction
and lift on the right, tissue expander on
the left) [...] On the good side, my son
and family live near the plastic surgeon’s
office and the hospital, [...], at least from
my son and my granddaughter [...]

6 Conclusion

We presented linear regression experiments to pre-
dict the age of a text’s author. As evaluation metrics,
we found correlation as well as mean absolute er-
ror to be complementary and useful measures. We
obtained correlations up to 0.74 and mean absolute
errors between 4.1 and 6.8 years. In three different
corpora, we found both content features and stylis-
tic features to be strong indicators of a person’s age.
Even a unigram only baseline already gives strong
performance and many POS patterns are strong in-
dicators of old age. By learning jointly from all of
the corpora, we were able to separate generally ef-
fective features from corpus-dependent ones.
