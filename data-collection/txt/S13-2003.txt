Abstract

In this paper, we describe our participation in
the TempEval-3 challenge. With our multi-
lingual temporal tagger HeidelTime, we ad-
dressed task A, the extraction and normaliza-
tion of temporal expressions for English and
Spanish. Exploiting HeidelTime’s strict sep-
aration between source code and language-
dependent parts, we tuned HeidelTime’s ex-
isting English resources and developed new
Spanish resources. For both languages, we
achieved the best results among all partici-
pants for task A, the combination of extraction
and normalization. Both the improved English
and the new Spanish resources are publicly
available with HeidelTime.

1 Introduction

The task of temporal annotation, which is addressed
in the TempEval-3 challenge, consists of three sub-
tasks: (A) the extraction and normalization of tem-
poral expressions, (B) event extraction, and (C) the
annotation of temporal relations (UzZaman et al.,
2012). This makes sub-task A, i.e., temporal tag-
ging, a prerequisite for the full task of temporal an-
notating documents. In addition, temporal tagging
is important for many further natural language pro-
cessing and understanding tasks, and can also be ex-
ploited for search and exploration scenarios in infor-
mation retrieval (Alonso et al., 2011).

In the context of the TempEval-2 challenge (Ver-
hagen et al., 2010), we developed our temporal tag-
ger HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2010), which
achieved the best results for the extraction and nor-

malization of temporal expressions for English doc-
uments. For our work on multilingual information
retrieval (e.g., Strötgen et al. (2011)), we extended
HeidelTime with a focus on supporting the simple
integration of further languages (Strötgen and Gertz,
2012a). For TempEval-3, we now tuned Heidel-
Time’s English resources and developed new Span-
ish resources to address both languages that are part
of TempEval-3. As the evaluation results demon-
strate, HeidelTime outperforms the systems of all
other participants for the full task of temporal tag-
ging by achieving high quality results for the extrac-
tion and normalization for English and Spanish.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: We explain HeidelTime’s system architecture
in Section 2. Section 3 covers the tuning of Heidel-
Time’s English and the development of the Spanish
resources. Finally, we discuss the evaluation results
in Section 4, and conclude the paper in Section 5.

2 HeidelTime

HeidelTime is a multilingual, cross-domain tempo-
ral tagger. So far, it can process English, Ger-
man, and Dutch text. In previous work, we an-
alyzed domain-dependent challenges and demon-
strated that domain-sensitive strategies for normal-
izing temporal expressions result in significant nor-
malization improvements when switching between
news- and narrative-style documents (Strötgen and
Gertz, 2012b). Although TempEval-3 only ad-
dresses news documents, the tuned English and new
Spanish resources can be used to process news and
also narrative-style documents such as Wikipedia ar-
ticles with high extraction and normalization quality.

Architecture of HeidelTime. HeidelTime is a
rule-based system with a strict separation between
source code and language-dependent resources.
While the strategies for processing different do-
mains are part of the source code, resources con-
sist of files for (i) patterns, (ii) normalizations, and
(iii) rules. They are read by HeidelTime’s resource
interpreter and thus have to be developed based on
HeidelTime’s well-defined rule syntax.

The pattern files contain words and phrases,
which are typically used to express temporal ex-
pressions, e.g., names of months. The normaliza-
tion files contain normalization information about
the patterns, e.g., the value of a specific month’s
name. Finally, the rule files contain rules for date,
time, duration, and set expressions.

All rules have an extraction part and a normal-
ization part. The extraction part, in which the pat-
tern resources can be used for generalization, de-
fines the expressions that have to be matched in a
document. The normalization part normalizes the
context-independent content of the expression using
the normalization resources. While explicit tempo-
ral expressions (e.g., May 1st, 2013) can directly
be fully normalized, underspecified (November) and
relative (today, two weeks ago) expressions can only
be normalized in an underspecified manner. The full
normalization depends on the domain of the docu-
ment that is to be processed and the context of the
expression. For this, HeidelTime applies domain-
sensitive strategies to normalize such expressions
during its disambiguation phase, which is called af-
ter the extraction and the normalization phases.

The TempEval-3 data is from the news domain.
Here, HeidelTime usually uses the document cre-
ation time as reference time. The temporal relation
to it is identified based on the tense in the sentence.1

Preprocessing. HeidelTime requires sentence, to-
ken, and part-of-speech information. For this, the
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) is used. Since there is
a Spanish model for the TreeTagger, adding Spanish
preprocessing capabilities to HeidelTime was fairly
easy. A wrapper for the TreeTagger is also part of
the UIMA HeidelTime kit described next.

1For further details on HeidelTime’s rule syntax, its domain-
dependent normalization strategies, and its architecture in gen-
eral, we refer to Strötgen and Gertz (2012a).

UIMA HeidelTime kit. For processing Temp-
Eval-3 data, we used the UIMA version of Heidel-
Time, developed a collection reader and a CAS con-
sumer to read and write TempEval-3 input and out-
put data, and added both components to our UIMA
HeidelTime kit. This makes HeidelTime’s evalua-
tion results reproducible on the training and test sets.

3 HeidelTime for TempEval-3

In TempEval-3, we participated with one Spanish
and three English runs: For Spanish, we used our
newly developed resources. For English, we used
(i) HeidelTime 1.2, which was released in May
2012, (ii) a version containing several bug fixes and
improvements, which were implemented indepen-
dently from TempEval-3, and (iii) HeidelTime with
its new English resources tuned for TempEval-3.

In general, our goal when developing HeidelTime
resources is to achieve high quality normalization re-
sults. Thus, we only want to extract temporal ex-
pressions which can be normalized correctly with
high probability – an issue, which will be further
looked at in the discussion in the evaluation section.
Before that, we next describe language-independent
adaptations to HeidelTime. Then, we present the
tuning of the English resources (Section 3.2) and the
development of the Spanish resources (Section 3.3).

3.1 General HeidelTime Adaptations

We performed the following language-independent
changes to HeidelTime:

(i) Weekday normalization: In news-style doc-
uments, extracted weekdays that are equal to the
weekday of the document creation time (dct) are
now normalized to the date of the dct independent
of the tense in the sentence.

(ii) Century/decade normalization: So far, decade
and century expressions were not correctly normal-
ized by HeidelTime according to TimeML, e.g.,
“199X” instead of “199” for “the 1990s”.

The first change is based on the intuitive assump-
tion that information in news-style documents is
temporally focused around the dct. In addition,
this assumption is supported by the English and the
Spanish training data. The second change is related
to the annotation standard. Both changes can thus
be generalized in a language-independent manner.

3.2 Tuning HeidelTime’s English Resources

Three training corpora were provided by the orga-
nizers: the Aquaint and TimeBank gold standard
corpora, and a large corpus referred to as silver stan-
dard, which was created by merging results of three
tools (Llorens et al., 2012). After a brief analysis,
we decided not to use the silver standard due to the
rather low annotation quality. Motivated by observa-
tions in the gold standard corpora, we performed the
following English-specific modifications in addition
to the general adaptations described above:

(i) REF-value expressions: expressions normal-
ized to past, present, or future are not consistently
annotated in the training data. Since such expres-
sions are rather less valuable for further tasks and
to avoid false positives, we removed some of those
patterns from the resources.

(ii) Ambiguous expressions: We added negative
rules for expressions such as may, march, and fall to
filter them out if they do not refer to a date.

(iii) Article/modifier: We allowed some more
combinations of articles and modifiers.

Note that HeidelTime was already a state-of-the-
art tool for English temporal tagging so that the
changes are rather minor.

3.3 Developing Spanish Resources

In this section, we explain the resource develop-
ment process for Spanish. Then, we detail language-
specific challenges we faced during this process.

Resource Development Process. So far, there
were no HeidelTime resources for Spanish, and we
thus started the development from scratch.

(i) Preprocessing: As mentioned in Section 2, we
use the TreeTagger with its Spanish module for sen-
tence, token, and part-of-speech annotation.

(ii) Translation of pattern files: Starting with Hei-
delTime’s English pattern resources, we developed
the Spanish pattern resources. The goal was that all
patterns that are frequently used to express tempo-
ral expressions are included in the resources. Note
that it is not important that the patterns are context
independent. The context in which a pattern should
occur can be defined within the rules.

(iii) Translation of normalization files: Similar to
the patterns, we translated the English normalization
files and adapted them to the new Spanish patterns.

(iv) Rule Development: Based on the English
rules for dates, times, durations, and sets, we de-
veloped similar Spanish rules. Using the Spanish
training corpus to check for partially matching pat-
terns, false positives, false negatives, and incorrect
normalizations, we then iteratively adapted the rules,
but also the pattern and normalization resources.

Challenges. Spanish as a Romance language is
rich in inflection. Nouns, adjectives, and determin-
ers are inflected with respect to number and gender.
During the development of the pattern and normal-
ization resources, this had to be taken into account.

As for nouns, there are many inflection forms of
verbs in Spanish, e.g., to represent tense. While
verbs are usually not part of temporal expressions,
the inflection of verbs has to be considered for the
normalization of ambiguous expressions such as el
lunes (Monday) or junio (June). As mentioned
above, in news-style documents, HeidelTime uses
the tense of the sentence to determine the relation
to the reference time, i.e., to decide whether the ex-
pression refers to a previous or upcoming date.

The tense is determined using part-of-speech in-
formation, and, if necessary, pattern information of
words with specific part-of-speech tags. For each
language, this information is defined in the pattern
resources. Unfortunately, the Spanish tag-set of the
TreeTagger module does not contain tags covering
tense information, e.g., all finite lexical verbs are
tagged as VLfin. Thus, we created regular expres-
sion patterns to match typical inflection patterns rep-
resenting tense information and check words tagged
as verbs by the tagger for these patterns.

However, due to the ambiguity of the Spanish in-
flection, we can only add patterns to detect future
tense. If no tense is identified, the year is set to the
year of the reference time. As detailed in the discus-
sion of the evaluation results described in Section 4,
identifying the correct relation to the reference time
is a frequent source of normalization errors.

4 Evaluation Results

Measures. For the extraction task, precision (P),
recall (R), and f1-score (F1) are used for strict and
relaxed matching. The value F1 and type F1 mea-
sures combine relaxed matching with correct nor-
malization. Systems are ranked by value F1 (value).

Results on Training Data. Table 1 shows the re-
sults on the Aquaint (a), TimeBank (b), and Spanish
training corpora (c). On both English corpora, Hei-
delTime’s TempEval-3 tuned version outperforms
the other two versions. The big differences between
the two English corpora are rather due to the better
annotation quality of TimeBank than due to different
challenges in the documents of the two corpora.

TempEval-3 Evaluation. The evaluation results
on the test data are presented in Table 2. For English,
HeidelTime’s TempEval-3 tuned version achieves
the best results, and all three HeidelTime versions
outperform the systems of the eight other partici-
pating teams with a total number of 21 submissions
(task A ranking measure value F1). For comparison,
the results of the next best system (NavyTime) is
listed in Table 2(a). For Spanish, we highly outper-
form the other two systems, as shown in Table 2(b).

Discussion. In order to be able to interpret Hei-
delTime’s results on the training and test data, we
performed an error analysis (TimeBank and Spanish
training corpus). The most important findings are:

(i) For a rule-based system, HeidelTime’s recall
is relatively low (many false negatives; FN). How-
ever, note that several FN are intentional. 55% and
29% of 117 and 149 FN in the English and Span-
ish training corpora are due to imprecise expressions
(some time; the latest period). These are difficult
to normalize correctly, e.g., some time can refer to
seconds or years. To guarantee high quality normal-
ization, we do not extract expressions that cannot be
normalized correctly with high probability.

(ii) There is a trade-off between precision and re-
call due to expressions referring to past, present, or
future (X REF). These are annotated either only in
some contexts or inconsistently throughout the train-

ing data, and thus result in FN (21%/en; 34%/es) and
false positives (43% of 98 FP in English training and
43%/es of 35 FP in Spanish training corpora).

(iii) The main sources for incorrect value normal-
ization of underspecified expressions (Feb. 1; Mon-
day) are wrongly detected reference times or rela-
tions to them (e.g., due to wrong tense identifica-
tion), annotation errors in the corpora (e.g., last week
annotated as WXX instead of the week it is referring
to), granularity errors (e.g., a year ago can refer to a
day, month, quarter, or year), and ambiguities (e.g.,
the year can be a duration or a specific year).

(iv) Some expressions in the Spanish test set were
extracted and normalized correctly although no sim-
ilar expressions exist in the Spanish training data.
Here, the Spanish resources highly benefited from
the high quality English resources as starting point
of the development process, and from HeidelTime’s
language-independent normalization strategies.

(v) A reoccurring error in the English test set
is that HeidelTime matches and normalizes expres-
sions such as two days earlier while only two days
should be annotated according to TimeML. This re-
sults in a relaxed match with false type and value.

5 Conclusions & Ongoing Work

In this paper, we presented HeidelTime’s results in
the TempEval-3 temporal tagging task. For both lan-
guages, English and Spanish, we achieved the best
results of all participants (value F1). We showed that
adding a new language to HeidelTime can result in
high quality temporal tagging of the new language.

Currently, we are working on improving the Span-
ish tense detection to better normalize underspec-
ified temporal expressions. Furthermore, we will
make available HeidelTime resources for Arabic,
Italian, and Vietnamese (HeidelTime, 2013).
