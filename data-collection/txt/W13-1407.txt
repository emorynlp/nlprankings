Abstract

This work performs some basic research upon
topical poetry segmentation in a pilot study
designed to test some initial assumptions and
methodologies. Nine segmentations of the
poem titled Kubla Khan (Coleridge, 1816,
pp. 55-58) are collected and analysed, pro-
ducing low but comparable inter-coder agree-
ment. Analyses and discussions of these cod-
ings focus upon how to improve agreement
and outline some initial results on the nature
of topics in this poem.

1 Introduction

Topical segmentation is the division of a text by
placing boundaries between segments. Within a seg-
mentation, each segment should represent a coherent
and cohesive topic. The decision to place a boundary
between two segments of text is subjective and must
often be determined manually. The factors involved
in performing this subjective task are poorly under-
stood, which motivates this work to begin the basic
research required to understand this phenomenon.

For literature, topical segmentations have been
produced for a short story (Kozima, 1993) and a
novel (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2012). Poetry,
however, has had little attention in terms of topical
segmentation. Brooke et al. (2012) collected seg-
mentations of poetry that sought to delineate which
voices communicate various segments of The Waste-
land by T.S. Elliot (1888-1965), but a voice seg-
ment does not necessarily correlate with a topical
segment. Because The Wasteland’s defining feature
is its voice-shifts, more data is required to under-
stand the variety of topical segments that could exist
within poetry besides those delineated by changing
voice — which this work aims to provide.1

This work’s goal is to begin to provide some
initial information about what constitutes a topic
in poetry by analysing the Romantic-era poem ti-
tled Kubla Khan (Coleridge, 1816, pp. 55-58) by
Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834). Chosen for
its beauty, variety, short length (54 lines), and lack of
strict adherence to a prescribed structure (e.g., son-
nets, odes, etc.), it is assumed that this purported
fragment of a dream will contain a wide variety of
different topics (as judged by manual coders).

This work aims to discover from reader’s interpre-
tations of topical segmentation in poetry the:

• Structure of these topics (e.g., are they linear,
hierarchical, or something else?);

• Types and variety of topics (e.g., do topics shift
when there are changes in time, place, descrip-
tion, exposition, etc.); and

• Relationship between poetic features and topi-
cal boundaries (e.g., do stanzas correlate with
topical boundaries?).

Unfortunately, this work is simply a pilot study
and it cannot make any generalizations about poetry
overall, but inferences can be made about this single
poem and its topical structure.

2 Related Work

Topical Segmentation Topical segmentation of
expository texts such as popular science magazine
articles have been well studied by Hearst (1993,
1994, 1997) while developing the automatic topi-
cal segmenter named TextTiling. On a parallel track,
Kozima (1993) segmented a simplified version of O.
Henry’s (William Sydney Porter; 1862–1910) short
story titled Springtime à la Carte (Thornley, 1816).
Both bodies of work focused upon using lexical co-
hesion to model where topic boundaries occur and
collected manual segmentations to study. This data,

47



however, was never analysed for the types of seg-
ments contained, but only for the presence or ab-
sence of topic boundaries at specific positions.

Kazantseva and Szpakowicz (2012) delved deeper
into topical segmentation of literature by collecting
segmentations of Wilkie Collins’ (1824–1883) ro-
mantic novel The Moonstone (Collins, 1868). In
the novel, 20 of its chapters were segmented indi-
vidually by 27 annotators (in groups of 4–6) into
episodes. Episodes were defined as “topically con-
tinuous spans of text demarcated by the most percep-
tible shifts of topic in the chapter” (Kazantseva and
Szpakowicz, 2012, p. 213). This work also analysed
the boundaries placed by the coders themselves, but
not the types of segments that they produced.

Brooke et al. (2012) collected voice-switch seg-
mentations of The Wasteland by T.S. Elliot (1888-
1965). Although voices are not topics, voice switch-
ing could constitute topical boundaries. Segmenta-
tions from 140 English literature undergraduate stu-
dents and 6 expert readings were collected and used
to compose one authoritative reference segmentation
to test a large number automatic segmenters upon.

Agreement and Comparison Inter-coder agree-
ment coefficients measure the agreement between a
group of human judges (i.e. coders) and whether
their agreement is greater than chance. Low coeffi-
cient values indicate that a task may have restricted
coders such that their responses do not represent an
empirical model of the task, or the task instructions
did not sufficiently define the task. High coefficient
values indicate the degree of reliability and repli-
cability of a coding scheme and the coding collec-
tion methodology (Carletta, 1996). Although there
is much debate about what coefficient value repre-
sents adequate agreement, any coefficient value can
be used to compare studies of the same task that use
different coding schemes or methodologies.

Many inter-coder agreement coefficients exist, but
this work uses Fleiss’ multi-π (π∗, Fleiss 1971; oc-
casionally referred to as K by Siegel and Castellan
1988) to measure agreement because it generalizes
individual coder performance to give a better pic-
ture of the replicability of a study. Specifically, an
adaptation of the proposal by Fournier and Inkpen
(2012, pp. 154–156) for computing π∗ is used that
is detailed by Fournier (2013).

Fournier (2013) modifies the work of Fournier
and Inkpen (2012) to provide a more discriminative
measure of similarity between segmentations called
boundary similarity (B) — an edit distance based
measure which is unbiased, more consistent, and
more intuitive than traditional segmentation compar-
ison methods such as Pk (Beeferman and Berger,
1999, pp. 198–200) and WindowDiff (Pevzner
and Hearst, 2002, p. 10). Using the inter-coder
agreement formulations provided in Fournier and
Inkpen (2012), Fournier (2013) provides B-based
inter-coder agreement coefficients including Fleiss’
multi-π (referred to as π∗B) which can discern be-
tween low/high agreement while still awarding par-
tial credit for near misses.

3 Study Design

This work is a small study meant to inform future
larger studies on topical poetry segmentation. To
that end, a single 54 line poem, Kubla Khan (Co-
leridge, 1816, pp. 55-58), is segmented. Written
in four stanzas (originally published in two) com-
posed of tetra and penta-meter iambs, this well stud-
ied work appears to show a large variety of topical
segment breaks, including time, place, scenery, nar-
ration, exposition, etc. Stripped of its indentation
and with its stanzas compressed into one long se-
quence of numbered lines, this poem was presented
to segmenters to divide into topics.

Objectives The objective of this study is to iden-
tify whether topics in poems fit well into a linear
topic structure (i.e., boundaries cannot overlap) and
to test the annotation instructions used. Addition-
ally, a survey of the types and variety of topics is de-
sirable to inform whether more than one boundary
type might be needed to model segment boundaries
(and to inspire statistical features for training an au-
tomatic topical poetry segmenter). Finally, the re-
lationship between poem features and topic bound-
aries is of interest; specifically, for this initial work,
do stanzas correlate with topical boundaries?

Subjects Nine subjects were recruited using Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk from the United States who
had an exemplary work record (i.e., were “Mas-
ter Tukers”). Segment text summaries were anal-
ysed for correct language use to ensure that coders

48



demonstrated English language proficiency.

Granularity Segmentations were solicited at the
line level (arbitrarily assuming that a topic will not
change within a line, but may between lines). This
level is assumed to be fine enough to partition seg-
ments accurately while still being coarse enough to
make the task short (only 54 lines can be divided into
segments). Because there may be a great number of
topics found in the poem by readers, it is assumed
that a nearly missed boundary would only be those
that are adjacent to another (i.e., nt for B is set to 2).

Collection procedure Segmenters were asked to
read the poem and to divide it into topical segments
where a topic boundary could represent a change
in time, scenery, or any other detail that the reader
deems important. A short example coding was also
provided to augment the instructions. Along with
line number spans, a single sentence description of
the segment was requested (for segment type analy-
sis and to verify coder diligence and thoughtfulness)
and overall comments on the task were solicited.

4 Study Results and Analysis

Time The 9 subjects took 35.1556±18.6796 min-
utes to read and segment the poem.2 Each was remu-
nerated $8 USD, or $18.91± 11.03 USD per hour.

Segmentations The 9 coders placed 17.6667 ±
6.2716 boundaries within the 54 lines of the poem.
The number of segmentations produced by each
coder is shown in Figure 1a, along with the mean
and standard deviation (SD).

Agreement The segmentations provided by the 9
coders in this study have an inter-coder agreement
coefficient value of π∗B = 0.3789. This value is low,
but it is only slightly below that of Hearst (1997)
(0.4405) and Kazantseva and Szpakowicz (2012)
(0.20, 0.18, 0.40, 0.38, 0.23 for each of the 5 groups)
as reported in Fournier (2013). This value is also not
unexpected given the different coding behaviours
(e.g., boundary placement frequency) in Figure 1a.

Similarity Using Boundary Similarity (B), taking
1 − B can yield a simple distance function between

segmentations. Because of the low agreement of
this study, it is assumed that there must be subsets
of coders who agree more with each other than with
others (i.e., clusters). Using 1−B as a distance func-
tion between segmentations, hierarchical agglom-
erative clustering was used to obtain the clusters
shown in Figure 1b. Computing inter-coder agree-
ment for these clusters produces subsets with signif-
icantly higher than overall agreement (Table 1).

Labels Taking the single-sentence descriptions of
each topic, an attempt was made to label them as
belonging to one or more of these categories:

1. Exposition (e.g, story/plot development);
2. Event (e.g., an action or event occurred);
3. Place (Location is stated or changed);
4. Description (of an entity; can be specific):

a) Scenery b) Person c) Sound d) Comparison
(simile or metaphor)

5. Statement (to the reader).

These labels were decided by the author while read-
ing the segmentations and were iteratively con-
structed until they suitably described the one-line
segment topic summaries. Using Jaccard similarity,
the labels placed on each position were compared
to those of each other coder to obtain mean similar-
ity of each line, as plotted in Figure 1c. This shows
that in terms of topic types, actual agreement varies
by position. The portions with the highest agree-
ment are at the beginning of the poem and contain
scenery description which appear to have been easy
to agree upon (type-wise). Overall, mean label sim-
ilarity between all coders was 0.5330 ± 0.4567, but
some of the identified clusters exhibited even higher
similarity (Table 1).

Feature correlations There is some evidence to
suggest that boundaries between the four stanzas at
lines 11–12, 30–31, and 36–37 correlate with top-
ical shifts because 6/9, 9/9, and 9/9 (respectively)
coders placed boundaries at these locations. There is
little evidence to suggest that the indentation of line
5 and lines 31–34 (not shown) correlate with topical
shifts because only 1/9 and 5/9 (respectively) coders
placed boundaries between these segments.

Topical structure One of the coders commented
that they felt that the segments should overlap and

thor to not overlap for analysis, but the coder’s com-
ment highlights that perhaps these segments should
be able to overlap, or that linear segmentation may
not be an adequate model for topics in poetry.

5 Discussion

Given the low (but comparable) inter-coder agree-
ment values of this study, it is evident that some vari-
ables are not properly being controlled by the proce-
dure used herein. Before a larger study is performed,
the issue of low agreement must be explained; some
hypotheses for this are that:

1. Coders may have been of varying levels of ed-
ucation, English proficiency, or motivation;

2. Instructions may have not been clear or exhaus-
tive in terms of the potential topics types;

3. A linear segmentation not allowing for overlap
may artificially constrain coders; and

4. The poem selected may simply be inherently
difficult to interpret and thus segment.

This study has, however, catalogued a number
of topic labels which can be used to better educate
coders about the types of topical segments that ex-
ist, which could lead to obtaining higher inter-coder
agreement. Pockets of agreement do exist, as shown
in the clusters and their agreement and topic label
similarity values (Table 1). If more data is collected,
but inter-coder agreement stays steady, perhaps in-
stead these clusters will remain and become more

populated. Maybe these clusters will reveal that the
problem was modelled correctly, but that there is
simply a difference between the coders that was not
previously known. Such a difference could be spot-
ted using clustering, but what the actual difference is
may remain a mystery unless more biographical de-
tails are available (e.g., sex, age, education, English
proficiency, reading preferences, etc.).

6 Conclusions and Future Work

Although Kubla Khan is a beautiful poem, its topical
segmentation is vexing. Low inter-coder agreement
exemplified by this study indicates that the method-
ology used to investigate topical poetry segmenta-
tion may require some modifications, or more bio-
graphical details must be sought to identify the cause
of the low agreement. Clustering was able to iden-
tify pockets of high agreement and similarity, but
the nature of these clusters is largely unknown —
what biographical details or subjective opinions of
the task separate these groups?

Future work will continue with subsequent pilot
studies to attempt to raise the level of inter-coder
agreement or to explain the low agreement by look-
ing for clusters of coders who agree (and attempting
to explain the relationships between coders in these
clusters). Also, more poems need to be analysed to
make generalisations about poetry overall. The re-
lationships between topical segments in poetry and
other poetic features such as rhyme, meter, and ex-
pert opinions are also worth investigation.
