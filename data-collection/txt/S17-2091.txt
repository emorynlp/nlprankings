Abstract

We describe the SemEval task of extract-
ing keyphrases and relations between them
from scientific documents, which is cru-
cial for understanding which publications
describe which processes, tasks and ma-
terials. Although this was a new task, we
had a total of 26 submissions across 3 eval-
uation scenarios. We expect the task and
the findings reported in this paper to be
relevant for researchers working on under-
standing scientific content, as well as the
broader knowledge base population and
information extraction communities.

1 Introduction

Empirical research requires gaining and maintain-
ing an understanding of the body of work in spe-
cific area. For example, typical questions re-
searchers face are which papers describe which
tasks and processes, use which materials and how
those relate to one another. While there are re-
view papers for some areas, such information is
generally difficult to obtain without reading a large
number of publications.

Current efforts to address this gap are search en-
gines such as Google Scholar,1 Scopus2 or Seman-
tic Scholar,3 which mainly focus on navigating au-
thor and citations graphs.

The task tackled here is mention-level iden-
tification and classification of keyphrases, e.g.
Keyphrase Extraction (TASK), as well as extract-
ing semantic relations between keywords, e.g.
Keyphrase Extraction HYPONYM-OF Informa-
tion Extraction. These tasks are related to the
tasks of named entity recognition, named entity

classification and relation extraction. However,
keyphrases are much more challenging to identify
than e.g. person names, since they vary signifi-
cantly between domains, lack clear signifiers and
contexts and can consist of many tokens. For this
purpose, a double-annotated corpus of 500 pub-
lications with mention-level annotations was pro-
duced, consisting of scientific articles of the Com-
puter Science, Material Sciences and Physics do-
mains.

Extracting keyphrases and relations between
them is of great interest to scientific publishers as
it helps to recommend articles to readers, high-
light missing citations to authors, identify poten-
tial reviewers for submissions, and analyse re-
search trends over time. Note that organising
keyphrases in terms of synonym and hypernym re-
lations is particularly useful for search scenarios,
e.g. a reader may search for articles on informa-
tion extraction, and through hypernym prediction
would also receive articles on named entity recog-
nition or relation extraction.

We expect the outcomes of the task to be rele-
vant to the wider information extraction, knowl-
edge base population and knowledge base con-
struction communities, as it offers a novel appli-
cation domain for methods researched in that area,
while still offering domain-related challenges.

Since the dataset is annotated for three tasks
dependent on one another, it could also be used
as a testbed for joint learning or structured pre-
diction approaches to information extraction (Kate
and Mooney, 2010; Singh et al., 2013; Augenstein
et al., 2015; Goyal and Dyer, 2016).

Furthermore, we expect the task to be interest-
ing for researchers studying tasks aiming at under-
standing scientific content, such as keyphrase ex-
traction (Kim et al., 2010b; Hasan and Ng, 2014;
Sterckx et al., 2016; Augenstein and Søgaard,
2017), semantic relation extraction (Tateisi et al.,

546



2014; Gupta and Manning, 2011; Marsi and
Öztürk, 2015), topic classification of scientific ar-
ticles (Ó Séaghdha and Teufel, 2014), citation con-
text extraction (Teufel, 2006; Kaplan et al., 2009),
extracting author and citation graphs (Peng and
McCallum, 2006; Chaimongkol et al., 2014; Sim
et al., 2015) or a combination of those (Radev and
Abu-Jbara, 2012; Gollapalli and Li, 2015; Guo
et al., 2015).

The expected impact of the task is an interest
of the above mentioned research communities be-
yond the task due to the release of a new corpus,
leading to novel research methods for information
extraction from scientific documents. What will
be particularly useful about the proposed corpus
are annotations of hypernym and synonym rela-
tions on mention-level, as existing hypernym and
synonym relation resources are on type-level, e.g.
WordNet.4 Further, we expect that these methods
will directly impact industrial solutions to making
sense of publications, partly due to the task organ-
isers’ collaboration with Elsevier.5

2 Task Description

The task is divided into three subtasks:

A) Mention-level keyphrase identification

B) Mention-level keyphrase classification.
Keyphrase types are PROCESS (including
methods, equipment), TASK and MATE-
RIAL (including corpora, physical materials)

C) Mention-level semantic relation extraction
between keyphrases with the same keyphrase
types. Relation types used are HYPONYM-
OF and SYNONYM-OF.

We will refer to the above subtasks as Subtask A,
Subtask B, and Subtask C respectively.

A shortened (artificial) example of a data in-
stance for the Computer Science area is displayed
in Example 1, examples for Material Science and
Physics are included in the appendix. The first part
is the plain text paragraph (with keyphrases in ital-
ics for better readability), followed by stand-off
keyphrase annotations based on character offsets,
followed relation annotations.

Text: Information extraction is the process of
extracting structured data from unstructured text,
which is relevant for several end-to-end tasks, in-
cluding question answering. This paper addresses
the tasks of named entity recognition (NER), a sub-
task of information extraction, using conditional
random fields (CRF). Our method is evaluated on
the ConLL-2003 NER corpus.

3 Resources for SemEval-2017 Task

3.1 Corpus
A corpus for the task was built from ScienceDi-
rect6 open access publications and was available
freely for participants, without the need to sign a
copyright agreement. Each data instance consists
of one paragraph of text, drawn from a scientific
paper.

Publications were provided in plain text, in ad-
dition to xml format, which included the full text
of the publication as well as additional metadata.
500 paragraphs from journal articles evenly dis-
tributed among the domains Computer Science,
Material Sciences and Physics were selected.

The training data part of the corpus consists of
350 documents, 50 for development and 100 for
testing. This is similar to the pilot task described
in Section 5, for which 144 articles were used for
training, 40 for development and for 100 testing.

We present statistics about the dataset in Ta-
ble 1. Notably, the dataset contains many long
keyphrases. 22% of all keyphrases in the train-
ing set consist of words of 5 or more tokens.
This contributes to making the task of keyphrase
identification very challenging. However, 93% of
those keyphrases are noun phrases7, which is valu-
able information for simple heuristics to identify
keyphrase candidates. Lastly, 31% of keyphrases
contained in the training dataset only appear in it
once, systems will have do generalise to unseen
keyphrases well.

3.2 Annotation Process

Mention-level annotation is very time-consuming,
and only a handful of semantic relations such as
hypernymy and synonymy can be found in each
publication. We therefore only annotate para-
graphs of publications likely to contain relations.

We originally intended to identify suitable doc-
uments by automatically extracting a knowledge
graph of relations from a large scientific dataset
using Hearst-style patterns (Hearst, 1991; Snow
et al., 2005), then using those to find potential re-
lations in a distinct set of documents, similar to
the distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Snow
et al., 2005) heuristic. Documents containing a
high number of such potential relations would
then be selected. However, this requires auto-
matically learning to identify keyphrases between
which those potential relations hold, and requires
relations to appear several times in a dataset for
such a knowledge graph to be useful.

In the end, this strategy was not feasible due to
the difficulty of learning to detect keyphrases au-
tomatically and only a small overlap between rela-
tions in different documents. Instead, keyphrase-
dense paragraphs were detected automatically us-
ing a coarse unsupervised approach (Mikolov
et al., 2013) and those likely to contain relations
were selected manually for annotation.

For annotation, undergraduate student volun-
teers studying Computer Science, Material Sci-
ence or Physics were recruited using UCL’s stu-

7Parts of speech are determined automatically, using the
nltk POS tagger

dent newsletter, which reaches all of its students.
Students were shown example annotations and the
annotation guidelines, and if they were still inter-
ested in participating in the annotation exercise,
afterwards asked to select beforehand how many
documents they wanted to annotate. Approxi-
mately 50% of students were still interested, hav-
ing seen annotated documents and read annotation
guidelines. They were then given two weeks to an-
notate documents with the BRAT tool (Stenetorp
et al., 2012), which was hosted on an Amazon EC2
instance as a web service. Students were compen-
sated for annotations per document. Annotation
time was estimated as approximately 12 minutes
per document and annotator, on which basis they
were paid roughly 10 GBP per hour. They were
only compensated upon completion of all annota-
tions, i.e. compensation was conditioned on an-
notating all documents. The annotation cost was
covered by Elsevier. To develop annotation guide-
lines, a small pilot annotation exercise on 20 doc-
uments was performed with one annotator after
which annotation guidelines were refined.8

We originally intended for student annotators
to triple annotate documents and apply majority
voting on the annotations, but due to difficulties
with recruiting high-quality annotators we instead
opted to double-annotate documents, where the
second annotator was an expert annotator. Where
annotations disagreed, we opted for the expert’s
annotation. Pairwise inter-annotator agreement
between the student annotator and the expert anno-
tator measured with Cohen’s kappa is shown in Ta-
ble 2. The * indicates annotation quality decreased
over time, ending with the annotator not complet-
ing annotating all documents. To account for this,
documents for which no annotations are given are
excluded from computing inter-annotator agree-
ment. Out of the annotators completing the an-
notation exercise, Cohen’s kappa ranges between
0.45 and 0.85, with half of them having a substan-
tial agreement of 0.6 or higher. For future itera-
tions of this task, we recommend to invest signifi-
cant efforts into recruiting high-quality annotators,
perhaps with more pre-annotation quality screen-
ing.

pants, they can be found here: https://scienceie.

4 Evaluation

SemEval 2017 Task 10 offers three different eval-
uation scenarios:

1) Only plain text is given (Subtasks A, B, C).

2) Plain text with manually annotated keyphrase
boundaries are given (Subtasks B, C).

3) Plain text with manually annotated
keyphrases and their types are given
(Subtask C).

We refer to the above scenarios as Scenario 1, Sce-
nario 2, and Scenario 3 respectively.

4.1 Metrics
Keyphrase identification (Subtask A) has tradi-
tionally been evaluated by calculating the ex-
act matches with the gold standard. There is
existing work for capturing semantically similar
keyphrases (Zesch and Gurevych, 2009; Kim

et al., 2010a), however since these are captured us-
ing relations, similar to the pilot task on keyphrase
extraction (Section 5) we evaluate keyphrases,
keyphrase types and relations with exact match
criteria. The output of systems is matched ex-
actly against the gold standard. The traditionally
used metrics of precision, recall and F1-score are
computed and the micro-average of those metrics
across publications of the three genres are calcu-
lated. These metrics are also calculated for Sub-
tasks B and C. In addition, for Subtasks B and
C, participants are given the option of using text
manually annotated with keyphrase mentions and
types.

5 Pilot Task

A pilot task on keyphrase extraction from scien-
tific documents was run by other organisers at Se-
mEval 2010 (Kim et al., 2010b). The task was
to extract a list of keyphrases representing key
topics from scientific documents, i.e. similar to
the first part of our proposed Subtask A, only on
type-level. Participants were allowed to submit
up to 3 runs and were required to submit a list
of 15 keyphrases for each document, ranked by
the probability of being reader-assigned phrases.
Data was collected from the ACM Digital Library
for the research areas Distributed Systems, Infor-
mation Search and Retrieval, Distributed Artifi-
cial Intelligence Multiagent Systems and Social
and Behavioral Sciences Economics. Participants
were provided with 144 training, 40 development
and 100 test articles, each set containing a mix
of articles of the different research areas. The
data was provided in plain text, converted from
pdf with pdftotext. Publications were annotated
with keyphrases by 50 Computer Science students
and added to author-provided keyphrases required
by the journals they were published in. Guide-
lines were for the keyphrases to exactly appear

549



anywhere in the text of the paper, in reality 15%
of annotator-provided keyphrases did not, as well
as 19% of author-provided keyphrases. The num-
ber of author-specified keywords was 4 on aver-
age, whereas annotators identified 12 on average.
Returned phrases are considered correct if they are
exact matches of either the annotator- or author-
assigned keyphrases, allowing for minor syntactic
variations (A of B→ B A ; A’s B→ A B). Preci-
sion, recall and F1 is calculated for the top 5, top
10 and all keywords. 19 systems were submitted
to the task, the best one achieving an F1 of 27.5%
on the combined author-assigned and annotator-
assigned keywords.

Lessons learned from the task were that perfor-
mance varies depending on how many keywords
are to be extracted, the task organisers recom-
mend against fixing a threshold for a number of
keyphrases to extract lead. They further recom-
mend a more semantically-motivated task, taking
into account synonyms of keyphrases instead of
requiring exact matches. Both of those recommen-
dations will be taken into account for future task
design. To fulfill the latter, we will ask annotator
to assign types to the identified keywords (process,
task, material) and identify semantic relations be-
tween them (hypernym, synonym).

6 Existing Resources

As part of the FUSE project with IARPA, we cre-
ated a small annotated corpus of 100 noun phrases
generated from the titles and abstracts derived
from the Web Of Science corpora9 of the domains
Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Com-
puter Science. These corpora cannot be distributed
publicly and were made available by the IARPA
funding agency. Annotation was performed by 3
annotators using 14 fine-grained types, including
PROCESS.

We measured inter-annotator agreement among
the three annotators for the 14 categories using
Fleiss’ Kappa. The k value was found to be 0.28
which implies that there was fair agreement be-
tween them, however distinguishing between the
fine-grained types added significantly to the an-
notation time. Therefore we only use three main
types for the SemEval 2017 Task 10.

There are some existing keyphrase extraction
corpora, however, they are not similar enough to
the proposed task to justify reuse. Below is a de-
scription of existing corpora.

The SemEval 2010 Keyphrase Extraction cor-
pus (Kim et al., 2010b)10 consists of a handful of
document-level keyphrases per article. In contrast
to the task proposed, the keyphrases are annotated
on type-level and not further classified as process,
task or material and semantic relations are not an-
notated. Further, the domains considered are dif-
ferent and mostly sub-domains of Computer Sci-
ence.

The corpus released by Tateisi et al. (2014)11

contains sentence-level fine-grained semantic an-
notations for 230 publication abstracts in Japanese
and 400 in English. In contrast to what we pro-
pose, the annotations are more fine-grained and
annotations are only available for abstracts.

Gupta and Manning (2011) studied keyphrase
extraction from ACL Anthology articles, applying
a pattern-based bootstrapping approach based on
15 016 documents and assigning the types FO-
CUS, TECHNIQUE and DOMAIN. Performance
was evaluated on 30 manually annotated docu-
ments. Although the latter corpus is related to
what we propose, manual annotation is only avail-
able for a small number of documents and only for
the Natural Language Processing domain.

The ACL RD-TEC 2.0 dataset (QasemiZadeh
and Schumann, 2016) consists of 300 ACL An-
thology abstracts annotated on mention-level with
seven different types of keyphrases. Unlike our
dataset, it does not contain relation annotations.
Note that this corpus was created at the same time
as the one SemEval 2017 Task 10 dataset and thus
we did not have the chance to build on it. A more
in-depth comparison between the two datasets as
well as keyphrase identification and classification
methods evaluated on them can be found in Au-
genstein and Søgaard (2017).

6.1 Baselines
We frame the task as a sequence-to-sequence pre-
diction task. We preprocess the files by splitting
documents into sentences and tokenising them
with nltk, then aligning span annotations from
.ann files to tokens. Each sentence is regarded
as one sequence. We then split the task into the

AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction

550



three subtasks, keyphrase boundary identification,
keyphrase classification and relation classification
and add three output layers. We predict the fol-
lowing types, for the three subtasks respectively:
Subtask A: tA = O,B, I for tokens being outside,
at the beginning, or inside a keyphrase
Subtask B: tB = O,M, P, T for tokens being out-
side a keyphrase, or being part of a material, pro-
cess or task
Subtask C: tC = O,S,H for Synonym-of and
Hyponym-of relations. For Subtask A and B, we
predict one output label per input token. For Sub-
task C we predict a vector for each token, that
encodes what the relationship between that token
and every other token in the sequence is for the
first token in each keyphrase. After predictions
for tokens are obtained, these are converted back
to spans and relations between them in a post-
processing step.

We report results for two simple models: one to
estimate the upper bound, that converts .ann files
into instances, as described above, then converts
them back into .ann files. Next, to estimate a lower
bound, a random baseline, that for each token as-
signs a random label for each of the subtasks.

The upper bound span-token-span round-trip
conversion performance, an F1 of 0.84, shows that
we already lose a significant amount of perfor-
mance due to sentence splitting and tokenisation
alone. The random baseline further shows hard
especially the keyphrase boundary identification
task is and as a result the overall task, since the
subtasks depend on one another. For Subtask A,
a random baseline achieves an F1 of 0.03. The
overall tasks gets easier if keyphrase boundaries
are given, resulting in F1 of 0.23 for keyphrase
classification, and if keyphrase types are given, an
F1 of 0.04 are achieved with the random baseline
for Subtask C.

7 Summary of Participating Systems

In this section, we summarise the outcome of
the competition. For more details please re-
fer to the respective system description papers
and the task website https://scienceie.
github.io/.

We had three subtasks, described in Sec 2,
which were grouped together in three evaluation
scenarios, described in Sec 4. The competition
was hosted in CodaLab12 in two phases: (i) de-

12https://competitions.codalab.org/

velopment phase and (ii) testing phase. Fifty four
teams participated in the development phase, and
out of them twenty six teams participated in the fi-
nal competition. One of the major success of the
competition is due to such wide participation and
application of various different techniques start-
ing from neural networks, supervised classifica-
tion with careful feature engineering to simple rule
based methods. We present a summary of ap-
proaches used by task participants below.

7.1 Evaluation Scenario 1

In this scenario teams need to solve all three sub-
tasks A, B, and C; where no annotation informa-
tion was given. Some teams participated only in
Subtask A, or B; but the overall micro F1 perfor-
mance across subtasks is considered for the rank-
ing of the teams. Seventeen teams participated in
this scenario. The F1 scores range from 0.04 to
0.43. Complete results are given in Table 3.

Various different types of methods have been
applied by different teams with various levels of
supervision. The best three teams TTI COIN,
TIAL UW, and s2 end2end have used recurrent
neural network (RNN) based approaches to ob-
tain F1 scores of 0.38, 0.42 and 0.43 respectively.
However, TIAL UW, and s2 end2end, by using a
conditional random fields (CRF) layer on top of
RNNs achieve a higher F1 in Subtask A compared
to TTI COIN.

The fourth team PKU ICL with an F1 of 0.37
found classification models based on random for-
est and support vector machines (SVM) useful
with carefully engineered feature such as TF-IDF
over a very large external corpus, IDF weighted
word-embeddings etc, along with an existing tax-
onomy. SciX on the other hand used noun phrase
chunking and trained an SVM classifier on pro-
vided training data to classify phrases, and used a
CRF to predict labels of the phrases. CRF based
methods with parts-of-speech (POS) tagging and
orthographic features such as presence of symbols
and capitalisation have been tried by several teams
(NTNU, SZTE-NLP, WING-NUS) and they lead-
ing to a reasonable performance (F1: 0.23, 0.26,
and 0.27, respectively).

Noun phrase extraction with length constraint
by HCC-NLP, and using a global list of keyphrases
by NITK IT PG are found not to perform satis-
factorily (F1: 0.16 and 0.14 respectively). The

Subtask B, and Subtask C. Ranking of the teams is based on overall performance measured in Micro F1.

former is surprising, as keyphrases are with an
overwhelming majority noun phrases, the latter
not as much, many keyphrases only appear once
in the dataset (see Table 1). GMBUAP further
tried using empirical rules obtained by observ-
ing the training data for Subtask A, and a Naive
Bayes classifier trained on provided training data
for Subtask B. Such simple methods on their own
prove not to be accurate enough. Attempts of such
give us additional insight about the hardness of the
problem and applicability of simple methods to the
task.

7.2 Evaluation Scenario 2

In this scenario teams needed to solve sub-tasks
B, and C. Partial annotation was provided to the
teams, that is, solution to the Subtask A. Four
teams participated in this scenario with F1 cores
ranging from 0.43 to 0.64. Please refer to Table 4
for complete result.

Except MayoNLP, other three teams partici-
pated only in Subtask B. Although ranking is done
based on overall performance, but in this scenario

13After the end of the evaluation period, team
UKP/EELECTION discovered those results were based
on training on the development set. For training on the
training set, their results are: 0.69 F1 overall and 0.72 F1 for
Subtask B only

rankings are consistent in each category. BUAP
with the worst F1 score for Subtask B (0.45),
is still better than the best team in Scenario 1
s2 end2end for Subtask B (0.44). Partial annota-
tion or accuracy for Subtask A proves to be crit-
ical, reinforcing again that identifying keyphrase
boundaries is the most difficult part of the shared
task.

Unlike the Scenario 1, in this case the top
two teams used classifiers with lexical features
(F1: 0.64) as well as neural networks (F1: 0.63).
The first team MayoNLP used SVM with rich
feature sets like n-grams, lexical features, or-
thographic features, whereas the second team
UKP/EELECTION used used three different neu-
ral network approaches and subsequently com-
bined them via majority voting. Both these meth-
ods perform quite similarly. However, a CRF
based approach and an SVM with simpler fea-
ture sets attempted by the two teams LABDA and
BUAP are found to be less effective in this sce-
nario.

MayoNLP applied a simple rule based method
for synonym-of relation extraction, and Hearst
patterns for hyponym-of relation detection. The
rules for synonym-of detection is based on pres-
ence of phrases such as in terms of, equivalently,

keyphrases. Interestingly, the RNN based ap-
proach of s2 end2end in Scenario 1 performs bet-
ter than MayoNLP without using partial annota-
tion of Subtask A.

7.3 Evaluation Scenario 3

In this scenario, teams need to solve only Subtask
C. Partial annotations were provided to the teams
for Subtask B and C. Five teams participated in
this scenario, and F1 scores ranged from 0.1 to
0.64. Please refer to Table 5 for complete result.

Neural network (NN) based models are found to
perform better than other methods in this scenario.
The best method by MIT uses a convolutional NN
(CNN). The other method uses two phases of NN
and found to be reasonably effective (F1: 0.54).

On the other hand, application of supervised
classification with five different classifiers (SVM,
decision tree, random forest, multinomial naive

TTI COIN rel discovered a bug in preprocessing, lead-
ing to low results. Their overall result after having corrected
for that error is a Macro F1 of 0.48.

Bayes and k-nearest neighbour) using three differ-
ent feature selection techniques (chi square, deci-
sion tree, and recursive feature elimination) found
close accuracy (F1: 0.5) with the top performing
ones.

LaBDA also use a CNN based method. How-
ever, the rule based post-processing and argument
ordering strategy applied by MIT seemed to give
additional advantage as also observed by them.

However most of the teams in this scenario out-
perform, all teams from other scenarios (who did
not have access to partial information for Subtask
B, and C) in relation prediction. This also asserts
the significance of accuracy on Subtask A, and B
in order to perform accurately on Subtask C.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we present the setup and discuss
participating systems of SemEval 2017 Task 10
on identifying and classifying keyphrases and re-
lations between them from scientific articles, to
which 26 systems were submitted. Successful
systems vary in their approaches. Most of them
use RNNs, often in combination with CRFs as
well as CNNs, however the system performing
best for evaluation scenario 1 uses an SVM with
a well-engineered lexical feature set. Identify-
ing keyphrases is the most challenging subtask,
since the dataset contains many long and infre-
quent keyphrases, and systems relying on remem-
bering them do not perform well.
