Abstract

Although the ideal length of summaries dif-
fers greatly from topic to topic on Twitter, pre-
vious work has only generated summaries of
a pre-fixed length. In this paper, we propose
an event-graph based method using informa-
tion extraction techniques that is able to cre-
ate summaries of variable length for different
topics. In particular, we extend the Pagerank-
like ranking algorithm from previous work to
partition event graphs and thereby detect fine-
grained aspects of the event to be summarized.
Our preliminary results show that summaries
created by our method are more concise and
news-worthy than SumBasic according to hu-
man judges. We also provide a brief survey of
datasets and evaluation design used in previ-
ous work to highlight the need of developing a
standard evaluation for automatic tweet sum-
marization task.

1 Introduction

Tweets contain a wide variety of useful information
from many perspectives about important events tak-
ing place in the world. The huge number of mes-
sages, many containing irrelevant and redundant in-
formation, quickly leads to a situation of informa-
tion overload. This motivates the need for automatic
summarization systems which can select a few mes-
sages for presentation to a user which cover the most
important information relating to the event without
redundancy and filter out irrelevant and personal in-
formation that is not of interest beyond the user’s
immediate social network.

Although there is much recent work focusing on
the task of multi-tweet summarization (Becker et al.,
2011; Inouye and Kalita, 2011; Zubiaga et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2011a; Takamura et al., 2011; Harabagiu
and Hickl, 2011; Wei et al., 2012), most previous
work relies only on surface lexical clues, redun-
dancy and social network specific signals (e.g. user
relationship), and little work has considered taking
limited advantage of information extraction tech-
niques (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2011) in generative
models. Because of the noise and redundancy in
social media posts, the performance of off-the-shelf
news-trained natural language process systems is de-
graded while simple term frequency is proven pow-
erful for summarizing tweets (Inouye and Kalita,
2011). A natural and interesting research question
is whether it is beneficial to extract named entities
and events in the tweets as has been shown for clas-
sic multi-document summarization (Li et al., 2006).
Recent progress on building NLP tools for Twitter
(Ritter et al., 2011; Gimpel et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2011b; Ritter et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012) makes
it possible to investigate an approach to summariz-
ing Twitter events which is based on Information Ex-
traction techniques.

We investigate a graph-based approach which
leverages named entities, event phrases and their
connections across tweets. A similar idea has been
studied by Li et al. (2006) to rank the salience
of event concepts in summarizing news articles.
However, the extreme redundancy and simplicity of
tweets allows us to explicitly split the event graph
into subcomponents that cover various aspects of the
initial event to be summarized to create comprehen-

sive and non-redundant summaries. Our work is the
first to use a Pagerank-like algorithm for graph parti-
tioning and ranking in the context of summarization,
and the first to generate tweet summaries of variable
length which is particularly important for tweet sum-
marization. Unlike news articles, the amount of in-
formation in a set of topically clustered tweets varies
greatly, from very repetitive to very discrete. For ex-
ample, the tweets about one album release can be
more or less paraphrases, while those about another
album by a popular singer may involve rumors and
release events etc. In the human study conducted by
Inouye and Kalita (2011), annotators strongly prefer
different numbers of tweets in a summary for dif-
ferent topics. However, most of the previous work
produced summaries of a pre-fixed length and has
no evaluation on conciseness. Liu et al. (2011a)
and Takamura et al. (2011) also noticed the ideal

length of summaries can be very different from topic
to topic, and had to use the length of human refer-
ence summaries to decide the length of system out-
puts, information which is not available in practice.
In contrast, we developed a system that is capable
of detecting fine-grained sub-events and generating
summaries with the proper number of representative
tweets accordingly for different topics.

Our experimental results show that with informa-
tion extraction it is possible to create more mean-
ingful and concise summaries. Tweets that contain
real-world events are usually more informative and
readable. Event-based summarization is especially
beneficial in this situation due to the fact that tweets
are short and self-contained with simple discourse
structure. The boundary of 140 characters makes it
efficient to extract semi-structured events with shal-
low natural language processing techniques and re-

Table 2: Event-related information extracted from tweets

duces the complexity of the relationship (or no re-
lationship) between events according to their co-
occurrence, resulting in differences in constructing
event graphs from previous work in news domain
(Li et al., 2006).

2 Issues in Current Research on Tweet

Summarization

The most serious problem in tweet summarization
is that there is no standard dataset, and conse-
quently no standard evaluation methodology. Al-
though there are more than a dozen recent works on
social media summarization, astonishingly, almost
each research group used a different dataset and a
different experiment setup. This is largely attributed
to the difficulty of defining the right granularity of a
topic in Twitter. In Table 1, we summarize the exper-
iment designs of several selective works. Regardless
of the differences, researchers generally agreed on :

• clustering tweets topically and temporally

• generating either a very short summary for a
focused topic or a long summary for large-size
clusters

• difficulty and necessity to generate summaries
of variable length for different topics

Although the need of variable-length summaries
have been raised in previous work, none has pro-
vide a good solution (Liu et al., 2011a; Takamura
et al., 2011; Inouye and Kalita, 2011). In this pa-
per, our focus is study the feasibility of generating
concise summaries of variable length and improv-
ing meaningfulness by using information extraction
techniques. We hope this study can provide new in-
sights on the task and help in developing a standard
evaluation in the future.

3 Approach

We first extract event information including named
entities and event phrases from tweets and construct
event graphs that represent the relationship between
them. We then rank and partition the events using
PageRank-like algorithms, and create summaries of
variable length for different topics.

3.1 Event Extraction from Tweets

As a first step towards summarizing popular events
discussed on Twitter, we need a way to identify
events from Tweets. We utilize several natural lan-
guage processing tools that specially developed for
noisy text to extract text phrases that bear essential
event information, including named entities (Ritter
et al., 2011), event-referring phrases (Ritter et al.,

22



2012) and temporal expressions (Mani and Wilson,
2000). Both the named entity and event taggers uti-
lize Conditional Random Fields models (Lafferty,
2001) trained on annotated data, while the temporal
expression resolver uses a mix of hand-crafted and
machine-learned rules. Example event information
extracted from Tweets are presented in Table 2.

The self-contained nature of tweets allows effi-
cient extraction of event information without deep
analysis (e.g. co-reference resolution). On the other
hand, individual tweets are also very terse, often
lacking sufficient context to access the importance
of events. It is crucial to exploit the highly redun-
dancy in Twitter. Closely following previous work
by Ritter et al. (2012), we group together sets of
topically and temporally related tweets, which men-
tion the same named entity and a temporal refer-
ence resolved to the same unique calendar date. We
also employ a statistical significance test to measure
strength of association between each named entity
and date, and thereby identify important events dis-
cussed widely among users with a specific focus,
such as the release of a new iPhone as opposed to in-
dividual users discussing everyday events involving
their phones. By discarding frequent but insignifi-
cant events, we can produce more meaningful sum-
maries about popular real-world events.

3.2 Event Graphs

Since tweets have simple discourse and are self-
contained, it is a reasonable assumption that named
entities and event phrases that co-occurred together
in a single tweet are very likely related. Given a col-
lection of tweets, we represent such connections by
a weighted undirected graph :

• Nodes: named entities and event phrases are
represented by nodes and treated indifferently.

• Edges: two nodes are connected by an undi-
rected edge if they co-occurred in k tweets, and
the weight of edge is k.

We find it helpful to merge named entities and
event phrases that have lexical overlap if they are fre-
quent but not the topic of the tweet cluster. For ex-
ample, ’bbc’, ’radio 1’, ’bbc radio 1’ are combined
together in a set of tweets about a band. Figure 1
shows a very small toy example of event graph. In

the experiments of this paper, we also exclude the
edges with k < 2 to reduce noise in the data and
calculation cost.

Figure 1: A toy event graph example built from the three
sentences of the event ’Nokia - 9/5/2012’ in Table 2

3.3 Event Ranking and Partitioning

Graph-based ranking algorithms are widely used in
automatic summarization to decide salience of con-
cepts or sentences based on global information re-
cursively drawn from the entire graph. We adapt the
PageRank-like algorithm used in TextRank (Mihal-
cea and Tarau, 2004) that takes into account edge
weights when computing the score associated with a
vertex in the graph.

Formally, let G = (V, E) be a undirected graph
with the set of vertices V and set of edges E, where
E is a subset of V ⇥ V . For a given vertex Vi, let
Ad(Vi) be the set of vertices that adjacent to it. The
weight of the edge between Vi and Vj is denoted as
wij , and wij = wji. The score of a vertex Vi is
defined as follows:

S(Vi) = (1� d) + d⇥
X

Vj2Ad(Vi)

wij ⇥ S(Vj)P
Vk2Ad(Vj) wjk

where d is a damping factor that is usually set to 0.85
(Brin and Page, 1998), and this is the value we are
also using in our implementation.

23



Starting from arbitrary values assigned to each
node in the graph, the computation iterates until con-
vergence. Note that the final salience score of each
node is not affected by the choice of the initial val-
ues assigned to each node in the graph, but rather the
weights of edges.

In previous work computed scores are then used
directly to select text fractions for summaries (Li et
al., 2006). However, the redundancy and simplic-
ity of tweets allow further exploration into sub-event
detection by graph partitioning. The intuition is that
the correlations between named entities and event
phrases within same sub-events are much stronger
than between sub-events. This phenomena is more
obvious and clear in tweet than in news articles,
where events are more diverse and complicated re-
lated to each other given lengthy context.

As theoretically studied in local partitioning prob-
lem (Andersen et al., 2006), a good partition of the
graph can be obtained by separating high ranked ver-
tices from low ranked vertices, if the nodes in the
graph have ranks that are distinguishable. Utilizing
a similar idea, we show that a simple greedy algo-
rithm is efficient to find important sub-events and
generate useful summaries in our tasks. As shown
in Figure 2 and 3, the high ranked nodes (whose
scores are greater than 1, the average score of all
nodes in the graph) in tweet event graphs show the
divisions within a topic. We search for strongly con-
nected sub-graphs, as gauged by parameter ↵, from
the highest ranked node to lower ranked ones.The
proportion of tweets in a set that are related to a
sub-event is then estimated according to the ratio be-
tween the sum of node scores in the sub-graph ver-
sus the entire graph. We select one tweet for each
sub-event that best covers the related nodes with the
highest sum of node scores normalized by length as
summaries. By adding a cutoff (parameter �) on
proportion of sub-event required to be included into
summaries, we can produce summaries with the ap-
propriate length according to the diversity of infor-
mation in a set of tweets.

In Figure 2, 3 and 4, the named entity which is
also the topic of tweet cluster is omitted since it is
connected with every node in the event graph. The
size of node represents the salience score, while the
shorter, straighter and more vertical the edge is, the
higher its weight. The nodes with rectangle shapes

are named entities, while round shaped ones are
event phrases. Note that in most cases, sub-events
correspond to connected components in the event
graph of high ranked nodes as in Figure 2 and 3.
However, our simple greedy algorithm also allows
multiple sub-events for a single connected compo-
nent that can not be covered by one tweet in the
summary. For example, in Figure 4, two sub-events
e1 = {sell, delete, start, payment} and e2 =
{facebook, share user data, privacy policy, debut}
are chosen to accommodate the complex event.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data

We gathered tweets over a 4-month period spanning
November 2012 to February 2013 using the Twitter
Streaming API. As described in more details in pre-
vious work on Twitter event extraction by Ritter et
al. (2012), we grouped together all tweets which
mention the same named entity (recognized using

Figure 4: Event graph of ’West Ham - 1/16/2013’, an
example of event cluster with a single focus

a Twitter specific name entity tagger1) and a refer-
ence to the same unique calendar date (resolved us-
ing a temporal expression processor (Mani and Wil-
son, 2000)). Tweets published during the whole pe-
riod are aggregated together to find top events that
happen on each calendar day. We applied the G2

test for statistical significance (Dunning, 1993) to
rank the event clusters, considering the corpus fre-
quency of the named entity, the number of times the
date has been mentioned, and the number of tweets
which mention both together. We randomly picked
the events of one day for human evaluation, that is
the day of January 16, 2013 with 38 events and an
average of 465 tweets per event cluster.

For each cluster, our systems produce two ver-
sions of summaries, one with a fixed number (set
to 3) of tweets and another one with a flexible num-
ber (vary from 1 to 4) of tweets. Both ↵ and � are
set to 0.1 in our implementation. All parameters are
set experimentally over a small development dataset
consisting of 10 events in Twitter data of September
2012.

4.2 Baseline

SumBasic (Vanderwende et al., 2007) is a simple
and effective summarization approach based on term
frequency, which we use as our baseline. It uses
word probabilities with an update function to avoid
redundancy to select sentences or posts in a social
media setting. It is shown to outperform three other
well-known multi-document summarization meth-
ods, namely LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004),
TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and MEAD
(Radev et al., 2004) on tweets in (Inouye and Kalita,
2011), possibly because that the relationship be-
tween tweets is much simpler than between sen-
tences in news articles and can be well captured by
simple frequency methods. The improvement over
the LexRank model on tweets is gained by consid-
ering the number of retweets and influential users is
another side-proof (Wei et al., 2012) of the effective-
ness of frequency.

4.3 Preliminary Results

We performed a human evaluation in which two an-
notators were asked to rate the system on a five-
point scale (1=very poor, 5=very good) for com-
pleteness and compactness. Completeness refers to
how well the summary cover the important content
in the tweets. Compactness refers to how much
meaningful and non-redundant information is in the
summary. Because the tweets were collected ac-
cording to information extraction results and ranked
by salience, the readability of summaries generated
by different systems are generally very good. The
top 38 events of January 16, 2013 are used as test
set. The aggregate results of the human evaluation
are displayed in Figure 5. Agreement between an-
notators measured using Pearson’s Correlation Co-

efficient is 0.59, 0.62, 0.62 respectively for compact-
ness, completeness and overall judgements.

Results suggest that the models described in this
paper produce more satisfactory results as the base-
line approaches. The improvement of EventRank-
Flexible over SumBasic is significant (two-tailed
p < 0.05) for all three metrics according to stu-
dent’s t test. Example summaries of the events in
Figure 2, 3 and 4 are presented respectively in Table
3. The advantages of our method are the follow-
ing: 1) it finds important facts of real-world events
2) it prefers tweets with good readability 3) it in-
cludes the right amount of information with diversity
and without redundancy. For example, our system
picked only one tweet about ’West Ham -1/16/2013’
that convey the same message as the three tweets to-

27



gether of the baseline system. For another example,
among the tweets about Google around 1/16/2013,
users intensively talk about the Google doodle game
with a very wide range of words creatively, giving
word-based methods a hard time to pick up the di-
verse and essential event information that is less fre-
quent.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We present an initial study of feasibility to gen-
erate compact summaries of variable lengths for
tweet summarization by extending a Pagerank-like
algorithm to partition event graphs. The evalua-
tion shows that information extraction techniques
are helpful to generate news-worthy summaries of
good readability from tweets.

In the future, we are interested in improving the
approach and evaluation, studying automatic met-
rics to evaluate summarization of variable length
and getting involved in developing a standard eval-
uation for tweet summarization tasks. We wonder
whether other graph partitioning algorithms may im-
prove the performance. We also consider extending
this graph-based approach to disambiguate named
entities or resolve event coreference in Twitter data.
Another direction of future work is to extend the
proposed approach to different data, for example,
temporal-aware clustered tweets etc.
