Abstract

We describe a new probabilistic model
for extracting events between major polit-
ical actors from news corpora. Our un-
supervised model brings together famil-
iar components in natural language pro-
cessing (like parsers and topic models)
with contextual political information—
temporal and dyad dependence—to in-
fer latent event classes. We quantita-
tively evaluate the model’s performance
on political science benchmarks: recover-
ing expert-assigned event class valences,
and detecting real-world conflict. We also
conduct a small case study based on our
model’s inferences.

tion software/data are available online, at:

1 Introduction

The digitization of large news corpora has pro-
vided an unparalleled opportunity for the system-
atic study of international relations. Since the mid-
1960s political scientists have used political events
data, records of public micro-level interactions be-
tween major political actors of the form “someone
does something to someone else” as reported in
the open press (Schrodt, 2012), to study the pat-
terns of interactions between political actors and
how they evolve over time. Scaling this data effort
to modern corpora presents an information extrac-
tion challenge: can a structured collection of ac-
curate, politically relevant events between major
political actors be extracted automatically and ef-
ficiently? And can they be grouped into meaning-
ful event types with a low-dimensional structure
useful for further analysis?

We present an unsupervised approach to event
extraction, in which political structure and linguis-
tic evidence are combined. A political context

model of the relationship between a pair of polit-
ical actors imposes a prior distribution over types
of linguistic events. Our probabilistic model in-
fers latent frames, each a distribution over textual
expressions of a kind of event, as well as a repre-
sentation of the relationship between each political
actor pair at each point in time. We use syntactic
preprocessing and a logistic normal topic model,
including latent temporal smoothing on the politi-
cal context prior.

We apply the model in a series of compar-
isons to benchmark datasets in political science.
First, we compare the automatically learned verb
classes to a pre-existing ontology and hand-crafted
verb patterns from TABARI,1 an open-source and
widely used rule-based event extraction system for
this domain. Second, we demonstrate correlation
to a database of real-world international conflict
events, the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID)
dataset (Jones et al., 1996). Third, we qualitatively
examine a prominent case not included in the MID
dataset, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and compare
the recovered trends to the historical record.

We outline the data used for event discovery
(§2), describe our model (§3), inference (§4), eval-
uation (§5), and comment on related work (§6).

2 Data

The model we describe in §3 is learned from a
corpus of 6.5 million newswire articles from the
English Gigaword 4th edition (1994–2008, Parker
et al., 2009). We also supplement it with a sam-
ple of data from the New York Times Annotated
Corpus (1987–2007, Sandhaus, 2008).2 The Stan-

http://eventdata.psu.edu/

2For arbitrary reasons this portion of the data is much
smaller (we only parse the first five sentences of each arti-
cle, while Gigaword has all sentences parsed), resulting in
less than 2% as many tuples as from the Gigaword data.

ford CoreNLP system,3 under default settings, was
used to POS-tag and parse the articles, to eventu-
ally produce event tuples of the form

〈s, r, t, wpredpath〉
where s and r denote “source” and “receiver” ar-
guments, which are political actor entities in a pre-
defined set E , t is a timestep (i.e., a 7-day pe-
riod) derived from the article’s published date, and
wpredpath is a textual predicate expressed as a de-
pendency path that typically includes a verb (we
use the terms “predicate-path” and “verb-path” in-
terchangeably). For example, on January 1, 2000,
the AP reported “Pakistan promptly accused In-
dia,” from which our preprocessing extracts the tu-
ple 〈PAK, IND, 678, accuse dobj←−− 〉. (The path ex-
cludes the first source-side arc.) Entities and verb
paths are identified through the following sets of
rules.

Named entity recognition and resolution is done
deterministically by finding instances of country
names from the CountryInfo.txt dictionary from
TABARI,4 which contains proper noun and adjec-
tival forms for countries and administrative units.
We supplement these with a few entries for in-
ternational organizations from another dictionary
provided by the same project, and clean up a few
ambiguous names, resulting in a final actor dictio-
nary of 235 entities and 2,500 names.

Whenever a name is found, we identify its en-
tity’s mention as the minimal noun phrase that
contains it; if the name is an adjectival or noun-
noun compound modifier, we traverse any such
amod and nn dependencies to the noun phrase
head. Thus NATO bombing, British view, and
Palestinian militant resolve to the entity codes IG-
ONAT, GBR, and PSE respectively.

We are interested in identifying actions initi-
ated by agents of one country targeted towards an-
other, and hence concentrate on verbs, analyzing
the “CCprocessed” version of the Stanford Depen-
dencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). Verb
paths are identified by looking at the shortest de-
pendency path between two mentions in a sen-
tence. If one of the mentions is immediately dom-
inated by a nsubj or agent relation, we consider
that the Source actor, and the other mention is the
Receiver. The most common cases are simple di-
rect objects and prepositional arguments like talk

prep with←−−−− and fight prep alongside←−−−−−− (“talk with R,” “fight
alongside R”) but many interesting multiword con-
structions also result, such as reject dobj←−− allegation

poss←−− (“rejected R’s allegation”) or verb chains as
in offer xcomp←−− help dobj←−− (“offer to help R”).

We wish to focus on instances of directly re-
ported events, so attempt to remove factively com-
plicated cases such as indirect reporting and hy-
potheticals by discarding all predicate paths for
which any verb on the path has an off-path gov-
erning verb with a non-conj relation. (For exam-
ple, the verb at the root of a sentence always sur-
vives this filter.) Without this filter, the 〈s, r, w〉
tuple 〈USA, CUB, want xcomp←−− seize dobj←−− 〉 is ex-
tracted from the sentence “Parliament Speaker Ri-
cardo Alarcon said the United States wants to seize
Cuba and take over its lands”; the filter removes
it since wants is dominated by an off-path verb
through say ccomp←−− wants. The filter was iteratively
developed by inspecting dozens of output exam-
ples and their labelings under successive changes
to the rules.

Finally, only paths length 4 or less are allowed,
the final dependency relation for the receiver may
not be nsubj or agent, and the path may not contain
any of the dependency relations conj, parataxis,
det, or dep. We use lemmatized word forms in
defining the paths.

Several document filters are applied before tu-
ple extraction. Deduplication removes 8.5% of ar-
ticles.5 For topic filtering, we apply a series of
keyword filters to remove sports and finance news,
and also apply a text classifier for diplomatic and
military news, trained on several hundred man-
ually labeled news articles (using `1-regularized
logistic regression with unigram and bigram fea-
tures). Other filters remove non-textual junk and
non-standard punctuation likely to cause parse er-
rors.

For experiments we remove tuples where the
source and receiver entities are the same, and re-
strict to tuples with dyads that occur at least 500
times, and predicate paths that occur at least 10
times. This yields 365,623 event tuples from
235,830 documents, for 421 dyads and 10,457
unique predicate paths. We define timesteps
to be 7-day periods, resulting in 1,149 discrete

5We use a simple form of shingling (ch. 3, Rajaraman and
Ullman, 2011): represent a document signature as its J = 5
lowercased bigrams with the lowest hash values, and reject a
document with a signature that has been seen before within
the same month. J was manually tuned, as it affects the pre-
cision/recall tradeoff.

jority of data starts in 1994).

3 Model

We design two models to learn linguistic event
classes over predicate paths by conditioning on
real-world contextual information about interna-
tional politics, p(wpredpath | s, r, t), leveraging the
fact there tends to be dyadic and temporal coher-
ence in international relations: the types of actions
that are likely to occur between nations tend to be
similar within the same dyad, and usually their dis-
tribution changes smoothly over time.

Our model decomposes into two submodels:
a Context submodel, which encodes how politi-
cal context affects the probability distribution over
event types, and a Language submodel, for how
those events are manifested as textual predicate
paths (Figure 1). The overall generative process is
as follows. We color global parameters for a frame
blue, and local context parameters red, and use
the term “frame” as a synonym for “event type.”
The fixed hyperparameter K denotes the number
of frames.

• The context model generates a frame prior θs,r,t
for every context (s, r, t).

• Language model:

• Draw lexical sparsity parameter b from a dif-
fuse prior (see §4).

• For each frame k, draw a multinomial distri-
bution of dependency paths, φk ∼ Dir(b/V )
(where V is the number of dependency path
types).
• For each (s, r, t), for every event tuple i in

that context,
• Sample its frame z(i) ∼ Mult(θs,r,t).
• Sample its predicate realization
w

(i)
predpath ∼ Mult(φz(i)).

Thus the language model is very similar to a topic
model’s generation of token topics and wordtypes.

We use structured logistic normal distributions
to represent contextual effects. The simplest is the
vanilla (V) context model,

• For each frame k, draw global parameters from
diffuse priors: prevalence αk and variability σ2k.

• For each (s, r, t),
• Draw ηk,s,r,t ∼ N(αk, σ2k) for each frame k.
• Apply a softmax transform,

θk,s,r,t =
exp ηk,s,r,t∑K

k′=1 exp ηk′,s,r,t

Thus the vector η∗,s,r,t encodes the relative log-
odds of the different frames for events appearing
in the context (s, r, t). This simple logistic nor-
mal prior is, in terms of topic models, analogous
to the asymmetric Dirichlet prior version of LDA
in Wallach et al. (2009), since the αk parameter
can learn that some frames tend to be more likely
than others. The variance parameters σ2k control
admixture sparsity, and are analogous to a Dirich-
let’s concentration parameter.

Smoothing Frames Across Time
The vanilla model is capable of inducing frames
through dependency path co-occurences, when
multiple events occur in a given context. How-
ever, many dyad-time slices are very sparse; for
example, most dyads (all but 18) have events in
fewer than half the time slices in the dataset. One
solution is to increase the bucket size (e.g., to
months); however, previous work in political sci-
ence has demonstrated that answering questions
of interest about reciprocity dynamics requires re-
covering the events at weekly or even daily gran-
ularity (Shellman, 2004), and in any case wide
buckets help only so much for dyads with fewer
events or less media attention. Therefore we pro-
pose a smoothed frames (SF) model, in which the

1096



frame distribution for a given dyad comes from a
latent parameter β∗,s,r,t that smoothly varies over
time. For each (s, r), draw the first timestep’s val-
ues as βk,s,r,1 ∼ N(0, 100), and for each context
(s, r, t > 1),

• Draw βk,s,r,t ∼ N(βk,s,r,t−1, τ2)
• Draw ηk,s,r,t ∼ N(αk + βk,s,r,t, σ2k)

Other parameters (αk, σ2k) are same as the vanilla
model. This model assumes a random walk pro-
cess on β, a variable which exists even for contexts
that contain no events. Thus inferences about η
will be smoothed according to event data at nearby
timesteps. This is an instance of a linear Gaussian
state-space model (also known as a linear dynami-
cal system or dynamic linear model), and is a con-
venient formulation because it has well-known ex-
act inference algorithms. Dynamic linear models
have been used elsewhere in machine learning and
political science to allow latent topic frequencies
(Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Quinn et al., 2010) and
ideological positions (Martin and Quinn, 2002) to
smoothly change over time, and thus share statis-
tical strength between timesteps.

4 Inference

After randomly initializing all ηk,s,r,t, inference is
performed by a blocked Gibbs sampler, alternat-
ing resamplings for three major groups of vari-
ables: the language model (z,φ), context model
(α, γ, β, p), and the η, θ variables, which bottle-
neck between the submodels.

The language model sampler sequentially up-
dates every z(i) (and implicitly φ via collapsing)
in the manner of Griffiths and Steyvers (2004):
p(z(i)|θ, w(i), b) ∝ θs,r,t,z(nw,z + b/V )/(nz + b),
where counts n are for all event tuples besides i.

For the context model, α is conjugate resam-
pled as a normal mean. The random walk vari-
ables β are sampled with the forward-filtering-
backward-sampling algorithm (FFBS; Harrison
and West, 1997; Carter and Kohn, 1994); there is
one slight modification of the standard dynamic
linear model that the zero-count weeks have no η
observation; the Kalman filter implementation is
appropriately modified to handle this.

The η update step is challenging since it is a
nonconjugate prior to the z counts. Logistic nor-
mal distributions were introduced to text mod-
eling by Blei and Lafferty (2007), who devel-
oped a variational approximation; however, we

find that experimenting with different models is
easier in the Gibbs sampling framework. While
Gibbs sampling for logistic normal priors is pos-
sible using auxiliary variable methods (Mimno
et al., 2008; Holmes and Held, 2006; Polson et al.,
2012), it can be slow to converge. We opt for
the more computationally efficient approach of
Zeger and Karim (1991) and Hoff (2003), using
a Laplace approximation to p(η | η̄,Σ, z), which
is a mode-centered Gaussian having inverse co-
variance equal to the unnormalized log-posterior’s
negative Hessian (§8.4 in Murphy, 2012). We find
the mode with the linear-time Newton algorithm
from Eisenstein et al. (2011), and sample in linear
time by only using the Hessian’s diagonal as the
inverse covariance (i.e., an axis-aligned normal),
since a full multivariate normal sample requires
a cubic-time-to-compute Cholesky root of the co-
variance matrix. This η∗ sample is a proposal for a
Metropolis-within-Gibbs step, which is moved to
according to the standard Metropolis-Hastings ac-
ceptance rule. Acceptance rates differ by K, rang-
ing approximately from 30% (K = 100) to nearly
100% (small K).

Finally, we use diffuse priors on all global pa-
rameters, conjugate resampling variances τ2, σk
once per iteration, and slice sampling (Neal, 2003)
the Dirichlet concentration b every 100 iterations.
Automatically learning these was extremely con-
venient for model-fitting; the only hyperparameter
we set manually wasK. It also allowed us to mon-
itor the convergence of dispersion parameters to
help debug and assess MCMC mixing. For other
modeling and implementation details, see the on-
line appendix and software.

5 Experiments

We fit the two models on the dataset described in
§2, varying the number of frames K, with 8 or
more separate runs for each setting. Posteriors are
saved and averaged from 11 Gibbs samples (every
100 iterations from 9,000 to 10,000) for analysis.

We present intrinsic (§5.1) and extrinsic (§5.2)
quantitative evaluations, and a qualitative case
study (§5.4).

5.1 Lexical Scale Impurity

In the international relations literature, much of
the analysis of text-based events data makes use of
a unidimensional conflict to cooperation scale. A
popular event ontology in this domain, CAMEO,
consists of around 300 different event types, each

1097



given an expert-assigned scale in the range from
−10 to +10 (Gerner et al., 2002), derived from
a judgement collection experiment in Goldstein
(1992). The TABARI pattern-based event extrac-
tion program comes with a list of almost 16,000
manually engineered verb patterns, each assigned
to one CAMEO event type.

It is interesting to consider the extent to which
our unsupervised model is able to recover the
expert-designed ontology. Given that many of
the categories are very fine-grained (e.g. “Express
intent to de-escalate military engagement”), we
elect to measure model quality as lexical scale pu-
rity: whether all the predicate paths within one
automatically learned frame tend to have similar
gold-standard scale scores. (This measures clus-
ter cohesiveness against a one-dimensional con-
tinuous scale, instead of measuring cluster cohe-
siveness against a gold-standard clustering as in
VI, Rand index, or purity.) To calculate this, we
construct a mapping between our corpus-derived
verb path vocabulary and the TABARI verb pat-
terns, many of which contain one to several word
stems that are intended to be matched in surface
order. Many of our dependency paths, when tra-
versed from the source to receiver direction, also
follow surface order, due to English’s SVO word
order.6 Therefore we convert each path to a
word sequence and match against the TABARI
lexicon—plus a few modifications for differences
in infinitives and stemming—and find 528 depen-
dency path matches. We assign each path w a
gold-standard scale g(w) by resolving through its
matching pattern’s CAMEO code.

We formalize lexical scale impurity as the av-
erage absolute difference of scale values between
two predicate paths under the same frame. Specif-
ically, we want a token-level posterior expectation

E(|g(wi)− g(wj)| | zi = zj , wi 6= wj) (1)

which is taken over pairs of path instances (i, j)
where both paths wi, wj are in M , the set of verb
paths that were matched between the lexicons.
This can be reformulated at the type level as:7

1

N

∑

k

∑

w,v∈M
w 6=v

nw,k nv,k |g(w)− g(v)| (2)

6There are plenty of exceptions where a Source-to-
Receiver path traversal can have a right-to-left move, such
as dependency edges for posessives. This approach can not
match them.

where n refers to the averaged Gibbs samples’
counts of event tuples having frame k and a par-
ticular verb path,8 and N is the number of to-
ken comparisons (i.e. the same sum, but with a
1 replacing the distance). The worst possible im-
purity is upper bounded at 20 (= max(g(w)) −
min(g(w))) and the best possible is 0. We also
compute a randomized null hypothesis to see how
low impurity can be by chance: each of ∼1000
simulations randomly assigns each path in M to
one of K frames (all its instances are exclusively
assigned to that frame), and computes the impu-
rity. On average the impurity is same at all K,
but variance increases with K (since small clus-
ters might by chance get a highly similar paths in
them), necessitating this null hypothesis analysis.
We report the 5th percentile over simulations.

5.2 Conflict Detection
Political events data has shown considerable
promise as a tool for crisis early warning systems
(O’Brien, 2010; Brandt et al., 2011). While con-
flict forecasting is a potential application of our
model, we conduct a simpler prediction task to
validate whether the model is learning something
useful: based on news text, tell whether or not an
armed conflict is currently happening. For a gold
standard, we use the Militarized Interstate Dispute
(MID) dataset (Jones et al., 1996; Ghosn et al.,
2004), which documents historical international
disputes. While not without critics, the MID data
is the most prominent dataset in the field of in-
ternational relations. We use the Dyadic MIDs,
each of which ranks hostility levels between pairs
of actors on a five point scale over a date inter-
val; we define conflict to be the top two categories
“Use of Force” (4) and “War” (5). We convert
the data into a variable ys,r,t, the highest hostility
level reached by actor s directed towards receiver
r in the dispute that overlaps with our 7-day in-
terval t, and want to predict the binary indicator
1{ys,r,t ≥ 4}. For the illustrative examples (USA
to Iraq, and the Israel-Palestine example below)
we use results from a smaller but more internally
comparable dataset consisting of the 2 million As-
sociated Press articles within the Gigaword cor-
pus.

For an example of the MID data, see Figure 2,
which depicts three disputes between the US and

8Results are nearly identical whether we use counts av-
eraged across samples (thus giving posterior marginals),
or simply use counts from a single sample (i.e., iteration
10,000).

Iraq in this time period. The MID labels are
marked in red.

The first dispute is a “display of force” (level
3), cataloguing the U.S. response to a series of
troop movements along the border with Kuwait.
The third dispute (10/7/1997 to 10/10/2001) be-
gins with increasing Iraqi violations of the no-
fly zone, resulting in U.S. and U.K. retaliation,
reaching a high intensity with Operation Desert
Fox, a four-day bombing campaign from Decem-
ber 16 to 19, 1998—which is not shown in MID.
These cases highlight MID’s limitations—while it
is well regarded in the political science literature,
its coarse level of aggregation can fail to capture
variation in conflict intensity.

Figure 2 also shows model inferences. Our
smoothed model captures some of these phenom-
ena here, showing clear trends for two relevant
frames, including a dramatic change in Decem-
ber 1998. The vanilla model has a harder time,
since it cannot combine evidence between differ-
ent timesteps.

The MID dataset overlaps with our data for 470
weeks, from 1993 through 2001. After excluding
dyads with actors that the MID data does not in-
tend to include—Kosovo, Tibet, Palestine, and in-
ternational organizations—we have 267 directed
dyads for evaluation, 117 of which have at least

one dispute in the MID data. (Dyads with no dis-
pute in the MID data, such as Germany-France,
are assumed to have y = 0 throughout the time
period.) About 7% of the dyad-time contexts have
a dispute under these definitions.

We split the dataset by time, training on the first
half of the data and testing on the second half, and
measure area under the receiver operating charac-
teristic curve (AUC).9 For each model, we train an
`1-regularized logistic regression10 with the K el-
ements of θ∗,s,r,t as input features, tuning the reg-
ularization parameter within the training set (by
splitting it in half again) to optimize held-out like-
lihood. We weight instances to balance positive
and negative examples. Training is on all individ-
ual θ samples at once (thus accounting for pos-
terior uncertainty in learning), and final predicted
probabilities are averaged from individual proba-
bilities from each θ test set sample, thus propa-
gating posterior uncertainty into the predictions.
We also create a baseline `1-regularized logistic
regression that uses normalized dependency path
counts as the features (10,457 features). For both
the baseline and vanilla model, contexts with no
events are given a feature vector of all zeros.11

(We also explored an alternative evaluation setup,
to hold out by dyad; however, the performance
variance is quite high between different random
dyad splits.)

5.3 Results

Results are shown in Figure 3.12

The verb-path logistic regression performs
strongly at AUC 0.62; it outperforms all of
the vanilla frame models. This is an exam-
ple of individual lexical features outperforming a
topic model for predictive task, because the topic
model’s dimension reduction obscures important
indicators from individual words. Similarly, Ger-
rish and Blei (2011) found that word-based regres-
sion outperformed a customized topic model when
predicting Congressional bill passage, and Eisen-

9AUC can be interpreted as follows: given a positive and
negative example, what is the probability that the classifier’s
confidences order them correctly? Random noise or predict-
ing all the same class both give AUC 0.5.

10Using the R glmnet package (Friedman et al., 2010).
11For the vanilla model, this performed better than linear

interpolation (about 0.03 AUC), and with less variance be-
tween runs.

12Due to an implementation bug, the model put the vast
majority of the probability mass only on K − 1 frames,
so these settings might be better thought of as K =
1, 2, 3, 4, 9, . . .; see the appendix for details.

stein et al. (2010) found word-based regression
outperformed Supervised LDA for geolocation,13

and we have noticed this phenomenon for other
text-based prediction problems.

However, adding smoothing to the model sub-
stantially increases performance, and in fact out-
performs the verb-path regression at K = 100.
It is unclear why the vanilla model fails to in-
crease performance in K. Note also, the vanilla
model exhibits very little variability in prediction
performance between model runs, in comparison
to the smoothed model which is much more vari-
able (presumably due to the higher number of pa-
rameters in the model); at small values of K, the
smoothed model can perform poorly. It would also
be interesting to analyze the smoothed model with
higher values of K and find where it peaks.

We view the conflict detection task only as one
of several validations, and thus turn to lexical eval-
uation of the induced frames. For lexical scale
purity (bottom of Figure 3), the models perform
about the same, with the smoothed model a lit-
tle bit worse at some values of K (though some-
times with better stability of the fits—opposite of
the conflict detection task). This suggests that se-
mantic coherence does not benefit from the longer-

range temporal dependencies.
In general, performance improves with higher

K, but not beyond K = 50. This suggests the
model reaches a limit for how fine-grained of se-
mantics it can learn.

5.4 Case study

Here we qualitatively examine the narrative story
between the dyad with the highest frequency of
events in our dataset, the Israeli-Palestinian rela-
tionship, finding qualitative agreement with other
case studies of this conflict (Brandt et al., 2012;
Goldstein et al., 2001; Schrodt and Gerner, 2004).
(The MID dataset does not include this conflict be-
cause the Palestinians are not considered a state
actor.) Using the Associated Press subset, we plot
the highest incidence frames from one run of the
K = 20 smoothed frame models, for the two di-
rected dyads, and highlight some of the interesting
relationships.

Figure 4(a) shows that tradeoffs in the use of
military vs. police action by Israel towards the
Palestinians tracks with major historical events.
The first period in the data where police actions
(‘impose, seal, capture, seize, arrest’) exceed mil-
itary actions (‘kill, fire, enter, attack, raid’) is
with the signing of the “Interim Agreement on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip,” also known as the
Oslo II agreement. This balance persists until the
abrupt breakdown in relations that followed the
unsuccessful Camp David Summit in July of 2000,
which generally marks the starting point of the
wave of violence known as the Second Intifada.

In Figure 4(b) we show that our model produces
a frame which captures the legal aftermath of par-
ticular events (‘accuse, criticize,’ but also ‘detain,
release, extradite, charge’). Each of the major
spikes in the data coincides with a particular event
which either involves the investigation of a par-
ticular attack or series of attacks (as in A,B,E) or
a discussion about prisoner swaps or mass arrests
(as in events D, F, J).

Our model also picks up positive diplomatic
events, as seen in Figure 4(c), a frame describ-
ing Israeli diplomatic actions towards Palestine
(‘meet with, sign with, praise, say with, arrive
in’). Not only do the spikes coincide with major
peace treaties and negotiations, but the model cor-
rectly characterizes the relative lack of positively
valenced action from the beginning of the Second
Intifada until its end around 2005–2006.

In Figure 4(d) we show the relevant frames de-

‘meet with, sign with, praise, say with, arrive in, host, tell, welcome, join, thank’ (d): again the same ‘kill, fire at’ frame in (a),

picting use of force from the Palestinians towards
the Israelis (brown trend line). At first, the drop
in the use of force frame immediately following
the start of the Second Intifada seems inconsis-
tent with the historical record. However, there is a
concucrrent rise in a different frame driven by the
word ‘include’, which actually appears here due
to an NLP error compounded with an artifact of
the data source. A casualties report article, con-
taining variants of the text “The Palestinian fig-
ure includes... 13 Israeli Arabs...”, is repeated 27
times over two years. “Palestinian figure” is er-
roneously identified as the PSE entity, and several
noun phrases in a list are identified as separate re-
ceivers. This issue causes 39 of all 86 PSE→ISR
events during this period to use the word ‘in-
clude’, accounting for the rise in that frame. (This
highlights how better natural language processing
could help the model, and the dangers of false
positives for this type of data analysis, especially
in small-sample drilldowns.) Discounting this er-
roneous inference, the results are consistent with
heightened violence during this period.

We conclude the frame extractions for the
Israeli-Palestinian case are consistent with the his-
torical record over the period of study.

6 Related Work

6.1 Events Data in Political Science
Projects using hand-collected events data repre-
sent some of the earliest efforts in the statisti-
cal study of international relations, dating back to
the 1960s (Rummel, 1968; Azar and Sloan, 1975;
McClelland, 1970). Beginning in the mid-1980s,
political scientists began experimenting with au-
tomated rule-based extraction systems (Schrodt
and Gerner, 1994). These efforts culminated in
the open-source program, TABARI, which uses
pattern matching from extensive hand-developed
phrase dictionaries, combined with basic part of
speech tagging (Schrodt, 2001); a rough analogue
in the information extraction literature might be
the rule-based, finite-state FASTUS system for
MUC IE (Hobbs et al., 1997), though TABARI is
restricted to single sentence analysis. Later pro-
prietary work has apparently incorporated more
extensive NLP (e.g., sentence parsing) though
few details are available (King and Lowe, 2003).
The most recent published work we know of, by
Boschee et al. (2013), uses a proprietary parsing
and coreference system (BBN SERIF, Ramshaw
et al., 2011), and directly compares to TABARI,
finding significantly higher accuracy. The origi-

1101



nal TABARI system is still actively being devel-
oped, including just-released work on a new 200
million event dataset, GDELT (Schrodt and Lee-
taru, 2013).14 All these systems crucially rely on
hand-built pattern dictionaries.

It is extremely labor intensive to develop these
dictionaries. Schrodt (2006) estimates 4,000
trained person-hours were required to create dic-
tionaries of political actors in the Middle East, and
the phrase dictionary took dramatically longer; the
comments in TABARI’s phrase dictionary indicate
some of its 15,789 entries were created as early as
1991. Ideally, any new events data solution would
incorporate the extensive work already completed
by political scientists in this area while minimiz-
ing the need for further dictionary development. In
this work we use the actor dictionaries, and hope
to incorporate the verb patterns in future work.

6.2 Events in Natural Language Processing

Political event extraction from news has also re-
ceived considerable attention within natural lan-
guage processing in part due to government-
funded challenges such as MUC-3 and MUC-4
(Lehnert, 1994), which focused on the extraction
of terrorist events, as well as the more recent
ACE program. The work in this paper is inspired
by unsupervised approaches that seek to discover
types of relations and events, instead of assuming
them to be pre-specified; this includes research un-
der various headings such as template/frame/event
learning (Cheung et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2012;
Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011; Li et al., 2010; Be-
jan, 2008), script learning (Regneri et al., 2010;
Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009), relation learning
(Yao et al., 2011), open information extraction
(Banko et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010), verb
caseframe learning (Rooth et al., 1999; Gildea,
2002; Grenager and Manning, 2006; Lang and La-
pata, 2010; Ó Séaghdha, 2010; Titov and Klemen-
tiev, 2012), and a version of frame learning called
“unsupervised semantic parsing” (Titov and Kle-
mentiev, 2011; Poon and Domingos, 2009). Un-
like much of the previous literature, we do not
learn latent roles/slots. Event extraction is also
a large literature, including supervised systems
targeting problems similar to MUC and political
events (Piskorski and Atkinson, 2011; Piskorski
et al., 2011; Sanfilippo et al., 2008).

One can also see this work as a relational ex-

tension of co-occurence-based methods such as
Gerrish (2013; ch. 4), Diesner and Carley (2005),
Chang et al. (2009), or Newman et al. (2006),
which perform bag-of-words-style analysis of text
fragments containing co-occurring entities. (Ger-
rish also analyzed the international relations do-
main, using supervised bag-of-words regression
to assess the expressed valence between a pair
of actors in a news paragraph, using the predic-
tions as observations in a latent temporal model,
and compared to MID.) We instead use parsing to
get a much more focused and interpretable repre-
sentation of the relationship between textually co-
occurring entities; namely, that they are the source
and target of an action event. This is more in line
with work in relation extraction on biomedical sci-
entific articles (Friedman et al., 2001; Rzhetsky
et al., 2004) which uses parsing to extracting a net-
work of how different entities, like drugs or pro-
teins, interact.

7 Conclusion

Large-scale information extraction can dramati-
cally enhance the study of political behavior. Here
we present a novel unsupervised approach to an
important data collection effort in the social sci-
ences. We see international relations as a rich
and practically useful domain for the development
of text analysis methods that jointly infer events,
relations, and sociopolitical context. There are
numerous areas for future work, such as: using
verb dictionaries as semi-supervised seeds or pri-
ors; interactive learning between political science
researchers and unsupervised algorithms; build-
ing low-dimensional scaling, or hierarchical struc-
ture, into the model; and learning the actor lists
to handle changing real-world situations and new
domains. In particular, adding more supervision
to the model will be crucial to improve semantic
quality and make it useful for researchers.
