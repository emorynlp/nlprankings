Abstract

Van der Sandt’s algorithm for handling
presupposition is based on a “presuppo-
sition as anaphora” paradigm and is ex-
pressed in the realm of Kamp’s DRT. In
recent years, we have proposed a type-
theoretic rebuilding of DRT that allows
Montague’s semantics to be combined
with discourse dynamics. Here we ex-
plore van der Sandt’s theory along the
line of this formal framework. It then re-
sults that presupposition handling may be
expressed in a purely Montagovian set-
ting, and that presupposition accommoda-
tion amounts to exception handling.

1 Introduction

Montague (1970) argued that there is no essen-
tial difference between natural and mathematical
languages. He developed a theory that assigns a
lambda-term for each lexical item, and the mean-
ing of a whole sentence could be obtained by com-
posing the lambda-terms via functional applica-
tion. However, his theory was limited to single
sentences. De Groote (2006) extends Montague’s
framework with a continuation-passing-style tech-
nique, developing a framework that is dynamic in
a sense reminiscent of Dynamic Predicate Logic
(Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991).

While Montague’s semantics is based on
Church’s (1940) simple type theory and has only
two atomic types (ι, the type of individuals; and o,
the type of propositions), de Groote (2006) adds
an atomic type γ representing the type of the envi-
ronment. For each lambda-term the continuation is
what is still to be processed, and its type is γ → o.

Since anaphoric expressions are known to be
similar to presuppositional expressions (van der
Sandt, 1992), it is natural to ask whether our type-
theoretic framework can be extended to handle

presuppositions. The goal of this paper is to an-
swer this question positively, at least in the case of
presuppositions triggered by definite descriptions.
To achieve this goal γ will not be defined simply
as a list of individuals, but as a list of individuals
together with their properties.

2 Background

Van der Sandt (1992) argues that presuppositions
and anaphors display similar behavior: they pri-
marily have to be bound to some antecedent pre-
viously introduced in the discourse. Therefore,
they can be treated by similar mechanisms. He
implements his ideas in DRT (Kamp and Reyle,
1993) in such a way that for each new sentence a
provisional DRS encoding possible anaphoric ele-
ments is constructed. This provisional DRS is then
merged with the main DRS, and the presupposi-
tional anaphors are resolved in accordance with
certain pragmatic constraints, so that presupposi-
tions can be accommodated when lacking a suit-
able antecedent.

Geurts (1999) proposes an improvement of van
der Sandt’s theory, called the binding theory, ac-
cording to which anaphora is a kind of presupposi-
tion. Therefore, presuppositions triggered by pro-
nouns and definite descriptions can also be accom-
modated: a referent is introduced with a poor de-
scriptive content and the descriptive content can be
enhanced as the discourse unfolds. Moreover, ac-
cording to the presuppositional version of the quo-
tation theory of names (Kneale, 1962), names (e.g.
John) are synonymous with definite noun phrases
of the form “the individual named John”. Hence,
presuppositions triggered by names and by defi-
nite descriptions can be handled similarly.

De Groote’s (2006) dynamic theory provides
some improvement over classical DRT. It allows
the representations of sentence and discourse to be
built from the lexical items in the spirit of Mon-
tague. It provides reference marker renaming for

71



free and may be implemented using well estab-
lished techniques. We claim that Geurts’ binding
theory can be incorporated into this framework,
providing a fully compositional treatment of defi-
nite descriptions.

3 Presupposition in Dynamic Theory

We focus here on presuppositions triggered
by definite descriptions, particularly by proper
names, pronouns and possessive noun phrases.

3.1 Basic Principles
Imagine that somebody is about to tell a new story
and the first sentence of this story is (1).

This story is about John. (1)

If the listener does not know John, he or she will
immediately imagine a person named “John” and
memorize it. In other words, the listener will ac-
commodate the presuppositional content triggered
by the proper name John in the following way:
he or she will create a slot in the environment,
which is some unit representing the knowledge
about John, and put there what was just learned
about John. Therefore, the listener will be able
to refer to the created slot representing John as the
discourse evolves. Moreover, the slot for John will
be different from other slots, i.e. it will have some
identity marker, which we call, following Kart-
tunen (1976), reference marker or simply refer-
ent. There is a direct analogy between memory
slots introduced above and Heim’s (1982; 1983)
file cards: they are both aimed to store what has
been learned about some individual.

Let j be the referent for John and assume that
sentence (1) is followed by sentence (2).

John loves Mary. (2)

Mary is a new individual in the discourse and
therefore Mary will be accommodated introducing
a reference marker m exactly as it happened for
John after the utterance of (1). The story is differ-
ent for John now. The listener already has a rep-
resentation standing for John in the environment,
and he or she just has to turn to the correspond-
ing slot (select the marker in the environment) and
update the slot with the new information that John
loves Mary (bind John from (2) to the referent j).

3.2 Proper Names
To encode, following Montague’s legacy, the ob-
servations discussed above as lambda-terms, we

first define a selection function sel as a function
taking two arguments: a property and an environ-
ment; and returning a reference marker:

sel : (ι→ o)→ γ → ι (3)

According to Montague, proper names can be
interpreted as type-raised individuals, thus the
lambda-term standing for John in Montague’s se-
mantics is (4), where j is a constant.

[[John]] = λP.Pj (4)

In the dynamic interpretation, instead of the con-
stant j we would like to have a referent corre-
sponding to John. For this, we attempt to select
such a referent given a property of being named
John, as shown in (5).

[[John]] = λP.P(sel(named “John”)) (5)

Whether the selection of the marker for John suc-
ceeds depends on the current environment. Hence,
instead of using Montague’s individuals (i.e. of
type ι) directly, we use individuals parameterized
by the environment (i.e. having type (γ → ι)).

Noun phrases are regarded as having type (6),
which is analogous to the type for noun phrases
(7) given by Montague, i.e. a noun phrase is in-
terpreted by a lambda-term that accepts a prop-
erty and returns a proposition. The only differ-
ence is that now individuals are always parameter-
ized by an environment, and propositions are dy-
namic1, i.e. they have type Ω that is defined as
γ → (γ → o)→ o.

[[NP]] = ((γ → ι)→ Ω)→ Ω (6)
[[NP]] = (ι → o) → o (7)

3.3 Pronouns
Pronouns are also presupposition triggers. It can
be seen in the case of cataphora, such as, for ex-
ample, in sentence (8), where in the first part of
the sentence the pronoun he introduces an individ-
ual. Since pronouns have poorer descriptive con-
tent than proper names and they have the type of
noun phrases (6), they are represented by lambda-
terms that are at most as complex as the terms
for proper names. The term for the pronoun he is
shown in (9), which expresses an attempt to select
a human individual having masculine gender.

When he woke up, Tom f elt better. (8)

1Analogously, dynamic predicates take two additional ar-
guments (environment, of type γ, and continuation, of type
(γ → o)) compared to Montague’s interpretation.

72



[[he]] = λP.P(sel (λx.human(x) ∧masculine(x))) (9)

If the sentence (8) is uttered in a discourse that
does not provide a suitable referent, the presuppo-
sition trigerred by he will be accommodated (as it
happened for John in (1) and for Mary in (2)). The
presuppositional anaphora trigerred by Tom in the
second part of the sentence could be successfully
bound to the introduced referent.

3.4 Possessives
Consider the sentence (10), where we have a pos-
sessive noun phrase John’s car triggering a pre-
supposition that there is a car owned by John.

John′s car is red. (10)

The desired interpretation of John’s car is shown
in (11), which requires a search in the environment
for a referent having the property of being a car
possessed by John. The embedded presupposition
is encoded via a selection function (for the inner
presupposition triggered by John) embedded into
another selection function (for the outer presuppo-
sition related to car).

[[John′s car]] = (11)
λP.P(λe.sel(λx.carx ∧ poss x sel(named “John”)e)e)

However, we would like to express John’s car
compositionally in terms of its constituents. To do
so, we define a term (12) taking two arguments -
a noun phrase standing for a possessor and a noun
standing for an object being possessed, and return-
ing a noun phrase in form of (11). f is a dynamic
conjunction having type (13) and defined in (14).

[[′s]] = λYX.λP.P(SEL(λx.((Xx) f Y([[poss]]x)))) (12)

f : Ω→ (Ω→ Ω) (13)

A f B = λeφ.Ae(λe.Beφ) (14)

The term [[poss]] in (12) is a usual dynamic two-
arguments predicate, its lambda-term is shown in
(15). SEL is a higher-order selection function. It
has the same designation as (3), with the only dif-
ference that it functions on the level of dynamic
propositions. Thus, the type of SEL is (16) and it
is analogous to the type of sel spelled in (3). More-
over, SEL is defined via sel, and the corresponding
lambda-term is presented in (17).

[[poss]] = λxy.λeφ.poss(xe)(ye) ∧ φe (15)

S EL : ((γ → ι)→ Ω)→ γ → (γ → ι) (16)

S EL = λPe.sel(λx.P(λe.x)e(λe.>))e (17)

[[car]] = λx.λeφ.car(xe) ∧ φe (18)

If we apply the term [[′s]] to the term (5) for John
and the term (18) for car, which is just a dynamic
unary predicate, we will get the desired result (11).

3.5 Implicit Referents
Sometimes an anaphora wants to be bound, even
though no referent was introduced explicitly, as in
(19). Already after the first sentence, a listener
will learn that John has a wife, i.e. introduce a
new referent. The presuppositional anaphora trig-
gerred by the possessive noun phrase his wife in
the second sentence will be bound to this referent.

John is married. His wi f e is beauti f ul. (19)

This case can be accounted with the lexical in-
terpretation in (20) for being married, which is
defined by a two-arguments relation is married.
The first argument of the relation is the argument
x being passed to the lexical interpretation. The
second argument is an individual selected from the
environment given the property of being either the
wife or the husband of x.

[[is married]] =
λx.λeφ.is married(xe)(sel(λy.(wife(y, x)

∨ husband(y, x)))e) ∧ φe
(20)

3.6 Discourse Update
A discourse is updated by appending the next sen-
tence, as shown in equation (21). A sentence is
defined as a term having the type of a dynamic
proposition, i.e. its type is (22), while a discourse
is defined as a term having the type of a dynamic
proposition evaluated over the environment, i.e its
type is (23). A discourse D updated with a sen-
tence S results in a term having type (23), thus it
has one parameter φ of type (γ → o). The body
must be a term, of type o, contributed by D. D it-
self is a term of type (23). Therefore, it must be
given a continuation as an argument constructed
with S and its continuation.

D� S = λφ. D(λe.Seφ) (21)

[[S ]] = Ω = γ → (γ → o)→ o (22)

[[D]] = (γ → o)→ o (23)

However, during the computation of
λφ.D(λe.Seφ) one of the selection functions
can raise an exception containing a message that
a referent having some property Q was not found
in the environment. The exception will be catched
and the property will be returned to the exception

73



handler. The handler will have to introduce a
referent having the property Q into the represen-
tation of the discourse, add this referent to the
environment, and call the update function passing
to it the amended interpretation of the discourse
and the sentence S as parameters. This can be
encoded using an exception handling mechanism
as shown in (24) for global accommodation. Note
that the definition of discourse update is recursive.

D� S = λφ. D(λe.Seφ)
handle (fail Q) with
λφ.D(λe.∃x.(Qx) ∧ φ((x,Qx) :: e))� S

(24)

The environment is defined as a list of pairs “ref-
erent × proposition” (25). The two-place list con-
structor :: appends a referent together with the
corresponding propositions into the environment,
therefore it has the type shown in (26).

γ = list of (ι × o) (25)
:: : (ι × o)→ γ → γ (26)

The selection function sel can implement any
anaphora resolution algorithm, and hence our
framework is not confined to any of them.

Considering that the lambda-term for Mary is
similar to (5) and the lambda-term for the tran-
sitive verb love is (27), the interpretation for the
sentence (2) after beta-reductions will be (28).

[[love]] = λYX.X(λx.Y(λy.(λeφ.love(xe)(ye) ∧ φe))) (27)

S2 = [[love]][[John]][[Mary]]→∗β
λeφ.(love(sel(named “John”)e)

(sel(named “Mary”)e)) ∧ φe
(28)

After the sentence (1), the lambda-term represent-
ing discourse will be (29).

D1 = λφ.∃y.(story y)∧
∃ j.(named “John” j)∧
about (y, j)∧
φ((y, story y) :: ( j, named “John” j))

(29)

After the sentence (2), the lambda-termD1 in (29)
will have to be updated with the term S2 in (28)
as it is defined by the function (24). Since we
have a referent for John in the environment of D1,
it will be successfuly selected and John from S2
will get bound to it. However, there will be a fail-
ure for Mary, particularly on the property (named
“Mary”) since there is no corresponding referent
in D1 yet. The failure will be handled by accom-
modating Mary and introducing the sentence S2
into the amended interpretation of the discourse,
which results in the term shown in (30).

D2 = D1 � S2 = λφ.∃y.(story y)∧
∃ j.(named “John” j)∧
about (y, j)∧
∃m.(named “Mary” j)∧
love ( j,m)∧
φ((m, named “Mary”m) ::

(y, story y) ::
( j, named “John” j))

(30)

4 Conclusions

We showed that de Groote’s (2006) dynamic
framework can be applied to presuppositions trig-
gered by definite descriptions, such as proper
names, possessive noun phrases and pronouns;
and that the exception handling mechanisms offer
a proper way of modeling the dynamics of presup-
position. Other presuppositional expressions, such
as, for example, factives and aspectual verbs, will
require more technicalities. Nevertheless, we be-
lieve that the approach can be extended to encom-
pass a general theory of presupposition and we in-
tend to address this in future work.
