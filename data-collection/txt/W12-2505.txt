Abstract

Electronic versions of literary works abound on the In-
ternet and the rapid dissemination of electronic read-
ers will make electronic books more and more com-
mon. It is often the case that literary works exist in
more than one language, suggesting that, if properly
aligned, they could be turned into useful resources for
many practical applications, such as writing and lan-
guage learning aids, translation studies, or data-based
machine translation. To be of any use, these bilin-
gual works need to be aligned as precisely as possible,
a notoriously difficult task. In this paper, we revisit
the problem of sentence alignment for literary works
and explore the performance of a new, multi-pass,
approach based on a combination of systems. Ex-
periments conducted on excerpts of ten masterpieces
of the French and English literature show that our
approach significantly outperforms two open source
tools.

1 Introduction

The alignment of bitexts, i.e. of pairs of texts as-
sumed to be mutual translations, consists in find-
ing correspondences between logical units in the in-
put texts. The set of such correspondences is called
an alignment. Depending on the logical units that
are considered, various levels of granularity for the
alignment are obtained. It is usual to align para-
graphs, sentences, phrases or words (see (Wu, 2010;
Tiedemann, 2011) for recent reviews). Alignments
are used in many fields, ranging from Translation
Studies and Computer Assisted Language Learn-
ing (CALL) to Multilingual Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) applications (Cross-Lingual Informa-
tion Retrieval, Writing Aids for Translators, Multi-

lingual Terminology Extraction and Machine Trans-
lation (MT)). For all these applications, sentence
alignments have to be computed.

Sentence alignment is generally thought to be
fairly easy and many efficient sentence alignment
programs are freely available1. Such programs rely
on two main assumptions: (i) the relative order of
sentences is the same on the two sides of the bi-
text, and (ii) sentence parallelism can be identified
using simple surface cues. Hypothesis (i) warrants
efficient sentence alignment algorithms based on
dynamic programming techniques. Regarding (ii),
various surface similarity measures have been pro-
posed: on the one hand, length-based measures
(Gale and Church, 1991; Brown et al., 1991) rely
on the fact that the translation of a short (resp. long)
sentence is short (resp. long). On the other hand,
lexical matching approaches (Kay and Röscheisen,
1993; Simard et al., 1993) identify sure anchor
points for the alignment using bilingual dictionar-
ies or surface similarities of word forms. Length-
based approaches are fast but error-prone, while lex-
ical matching approaches seem to deliver more re-
liable results. Most state-of-the-art approaches use
both types of information (Langlais, 1998; Simard
and Plamondon, 1998; Moore, 2002; Varga et al.,
2005; Braune and Fraser, 2010).

In most applications, only high-confidence one-
to-one sentence alignments are considered useful
and kept for subsequent processing stages. Indeed,
when the objective is to build subsentential align-

eral sentence alignment tools in a unified framework:

ments (at the level of words, terms or phrases), other
types of mappings between sentences are deemed
to be either insufficiently reliable or inappropriate.
As it were, the one-to-one constraint is viewed as a
proxy to literalness/compositionality of the transla-
tion and warrants the search of finer-grained align-
ments. However, for certain types of bitexts2, such
as literary texts, translation often departs from a
straight sentence-by-sentence alignment and using
such a constraint can discard a significant propor-
tion of the bitext. For MT, this is just a regrettable
waste of potentially useful training material (Uszko-
reit et al., 2010), all the more so as parallel liter-
ary texts constitute a very large reservoir of par-
allel texts online. For other applications implying
to mine, visualize or read the actual translations in
their context (second language learning (Nerbonne,
2000; Kraif and Tutin, 2011), translators training,
automatic translation checking (Macklovitch, 1994),
etc.), the entire bitext has to be aligned. Further-
more, areas where the translation is only partial or
approximative need to be identified precisely.

The work reported in this study aims to explore
the quality of existing sentence alignment tech-
niques for literary work and to explore the usability
of a recently proposed multiple-pass approach, espe-
cially designed for recovering many-to-one pairings.
In a nutshell, this approach uses sure one-to-one
mappings detected in a first pass to train a discrim-
inative sentence alignment system, which is then
used to align the regions which remain problem-
atic. Our experiments on the BAF corpus (Simard,
1998) and on a small literary corpus consisting of ten
books show that this approach produces high quality
alignments and also identifies the most problematic
passages better than its competitors.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
we first report the results of a pilot study aimed at
aligning our corpus with existing alignment meth-
ods (Section 2). In Section 3, we briefly describe our
two-pass method, including some recent improve-
ments, and present experimental performance on the
BAF corpus. Attempts to apply this technique to our
larger literary corpus are reported and discussed in

2Actual literary bitexts are not so easily found over the Inter-
net, notably due to (i) issues related to variations in the source
text and (ii) issues related to the variations, over time, of the
very notion of what a translation should be like.

Section 4. We discuss further prospects and con-
clude in Section 5.

2 Book alignment with off-the-shelf tools

2.1 A small bilingual library

The corpus used in this study contains a random se-
lection of ten books written mostly in the 19th and
in the early 20th century: five are English classics
translated into French, and five are French classics
translated into English. These books and their trans-
lation are freely available3 from sources such as the
Gutenberg project4 or wikisource5, and are repre-
sentative of the kinds of collections that can be easily
collected from the Internet. These texts have been
preprocessed and tokenized using in-house tools,
yielding word and sentence counts in Table 1.

2.2 Baseline sentence alignments

2.2.1 Public domain tools

Baseline alignments are computed using two
open-source sentence alignment packages, the sen-
tence alignment tool of Moore (2002)6, and Hu-
nalign (Varga et al., 2005). These two tools were
chosen as representative of the current state-of-the-
art in sentence alignment. Moore’s approach im-
plements a two-pass, coarse-to-fine, strategy: a first
pass, based on sentence length cues, computes a
first alignment according to the principles of length-
based approaches (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and
Church, 1991). This alignment is used to train a sim-
plified version of IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993),
which provides the alignment system with lexical
association scores; these scores are then used to re-
fine the measure of association between sentences.
This approach is primarily aimed at delivering high
confidence, one-to-one, sentence alignments to be
used as training material for data-intensive MT. Sen-
tences that cannot be reliably aligned are discarded
from the resulting alignment.

3Getting access to more recent books (or their translation) is
problematic, due to copyright issues: literary works fall in the
public domain 70 years after the death of their author.

Hunalign7, with default settings, also implements
a two-pass strategy which resembles the approach of
Moore. Their main difference is that Hunalign also
produces many-to-one and one-to-many alignment
links, which are needed to ensure that all the input
sentences appear in the final alignment.

Both systems also deliver confidence measures
for the automatic alignment: a value between 0 and
1 for Moore’s tool, which can be interpreted as a
posterior probability; the values delivered by Hu-
nalign are less easily understood, and range from−1
to some small positive real values (greater than 1).

2.2.2 Evaluation metrics
Sentence alignment tools are usually evaluated

using standard recall [R] and precision [P] mea-
sures, combined in the F-measure [F], with respect
to some manually defined gold alignment (Véronis
and Langlais, 2000). These measures can be com-
puted at various levels of granularity: the level of
alignment links, of sentences, of words, and of char-
acters. As gold references only specify alignment
links, the other references are automatically derived
in the most inclusive way. For instance, if the refer-
ence alignment links state that the pair of source sen-
tences f1, f2 is aligned with target e, the reference
sentence alignment will contain both (f1, e) and

7ftp://ftp.mokk.bme.hu/Hunglish/src/hunalign; we have
used the version that ships with Uplug.

(f2, e); likewise, the reference word alignment will
contain all the possible word alignments between
tokens in the source and the target side. For such
metrics, missing the alignment of a large “block”
of sentences gets a higher penalty than missing a
small one; likewise, misaligning short sentences is
less penalized than misaligning longer ones. As a
side effect, all metrics, but the more severe one, ig-
nore null alignments. Our results are therefore based
on the link-level and sentence-level F-measure, to
reflect the importance of correctly predicting un-
aligned sentences in our applicative scenario.

2.2.3 Results
Previous comparisons of these alignment tools

on standard benchmarks have shown that both typ-
ically yield near state-of-the-art performance. For
instance, experiments conducted using the literary
subpart of the BAF corpus (Simard, 1998), con-
sisting of a hand-checked alignment of the French
novel De la Terre à la Lune (From the Earth to
the Moon), by Jules Verne, with a slightly abridged
translation available from the Gutenberg project8,
have yielded the results in Table 2 (Moore’s system
was used with its default parameters, Hunalign with
the --realign option).

All in all, for this specific corpus, Moore’s strat-
egy delivers slightly better sentence alignments than

Hunalign does; in particular, it is able to identify 1-
to-1 links with a very high precision.

2.3 Aligning a small library
In a first series of experiments, we simply run the
two alignment tools on our small collection to see
how much of it can be aligned with a reasonable con-
fidence. The main results are reproduced in Figure 1,
where we display both the number of 1-to-1 links
extracted by the baselines (as dots on the Figure), as
well as the average size of pseudo-paragraphs (see
definition below) in French and English. As ex-
pected, less 1-to-1 links almost always imply larger
blocks.

As expected, these texts turn out to be rather
difficult to align: in the best case (Swann’s way
(SW)), only about 80% of the total sentences are
aligned by Moore’s system; in the more problem-
atic cases (Emma (EM) and Vanity Fair (VF)), more
than 50% of the book content is actually thrown
away when one only looks at Moore’s alignments.
Hunalign’s results look more positive, as a signifi-
cantly larger number of one-to-one correspondences
is found. Given that this system is overall less reli-

able than Moore’s approach, it might be safe to filter
these alignments and keep only the surer ones (here,
keeping only links having a score greater than 0.5).
The resulting number of sentences falls way below
what is obtained by Moore’s approach.

To conclude, both systems seem to have more dif-
ficulties with the literary material considered here
than with other types of texts. In particular, the
proportion of one-to-one links appears to be signif-
icantly smaller than what is typically reported for
other genres; note, however, that even in the worst
case, one-to-one links still account for about 50% of
the text. Another finding is that the alignment scores
which are output are not very useful: for Moore, fil-
tering low scoring links has very little effect; for Hu-
nalign, there is a sharp transition (around a threshold
of 0.5): below this value, filtering has little effect;
above this value, filtering is too drastic, as shown on
Figure 1.

3 Learning sentence alignments

In this section, we outline the main principles of
the approach developed in this study to improve the
sentence alignments produced by our baseline tools,
with the aim to salvage as many sentences as possi-
ble, which implies to come up with a way for better
detecting many-to-one and one-to-many correspon-
dences. Our starting point is the set of alignments
delivered by Moore’s tool. As discussed above,
these alignments have a very high precision, at the
expense of an unsatisfactory recall. Our sentence
alignment method considers these sentence pairs as
being parallel and uses them to train a binary classi-
fier for detecting parallel sentences. Using the pre-
dictions of this tool, it then attempts to align the re-
maining portions of the bitext (see Figure 2).

In Figure 2, Moore’s links are displayed with
solid lines; these lines delineate parallel pseudo-
paragraphs in the bitexts (appearing in boxed areas),
which we will try to further decompose. Note that
two configurations need to be distinguished: (i) one
side of a paragraph is empty: no further analysis
is performed and a 0-to-many alignment is output;
(ii) both sides of a paragraph are non-empty and de-
fine a i-to-j alignment that will be processed by the
block alignment algorithm described below.

3.1 Detecting parallelism

Assuming the availability of a set of example paral-
lel sentences, the first step of our approach consists
in training a function for scoring candidate align-
ments. Following (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), we
train a Maximum Entropy classifier9 (Rathnaparkhi,
1998); in principle, many other binary classifiers
would be possible here. Our motivation for using
a maxent approach was to obtain, for each possible
pair of sentences (f ,e), a link posterior probability
P (link|f , e).

We take the sentence alignments of the first step
as positive examples. Negative examples are artifi-
cially generated as follows: for all pairs of positive
instances (e, f) and (e′, f ′) such that e′ immediately
follows e, we select the pair (e, f ′) as a negative ex-
ample. This strategy produced a balanced corpus
containing as many negative pairs as positive ones.
However, this approach may give too much weight
on the length ratio feature and it remains to be seen
whether alternative approaches are more suitable.

Formally, the problem is thus to estimate a con-
ditional model for deciding whether two sentences
e and f should be aligned. Denoting Y the corre-
sponding binary variable, this model has the follow-

ing form:

P (Y = 1|e, f) = 1
1 + exp[−

∑K
k=1 θkFk(e, f)]

,

where {Fk(e, f), k = 1 . . .K} denotes a set of fea-
ture functions testing arbitrary properties of e and f ,
and {θk, k = 1 . . .K} is the corresponding set of
parameter values.

Given a set of training sentence pairs, the opti-
mal values of the parameters are set by optimizing
numerically the conditional likelihood; optimization
is performed here using L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal,
1989); a Gaussian prior over the parameters is used
to ensure numerical stability of the optimization.

In this study, we used the following set of feature
functions:

• lexical features: for each pair of words10 (e, f)
occurring in Ve × Vf , there is a corresponding
feature Fe,f which fires whenever e ∈ e and
f ∈ f .

• length features: denoting le (resp. lf ) the
length of the source (resp. target) sentence,
measured in number of characters, we in-
clude features related to length ratio, defined
as Fr(e, f) =

|le−lf |
max(le,lf )

. Rather than taking the
numerical value, we use a simple discretization
scheme based on 6 bins.

• cognate features: we loosely define cog-
nates11 as words sharing a common prefix of
length at least 3. This gives rise to 4 features,
which are respectively activated when the num-
ber of cognates in the parallel sentence is 0, 1,
2, or greater than 2.

• copy features: an extreme case of similarity
is when a word is copied verbatim from the
source to the target. This happens with proper
nouns, dates, etc. We again derive 4 features,
depending on whether the number of identical
words in f and e is 0, 1, 2 or greater than 2.

10A word is an alphabetic string of characters, excluding
punction marks.

11Cognates are words that share a similar spelling in two or
more different languages, as a result of their similar meaning
and/or common etymological origin, e.g. (English-Spanish):
history - historia, harmonious - armonioso.

40



3.2 Filling alignment gaps
The third step uses the posterior alignment proba-
bilities computed in the second step to fill the gaps
in the first pass alignment. The algorithm can be
glossed as follows. Assume a bitext block compris-
ing the sentences from index i to j in the source
side of the bitext, and from k to l in the target side
such that sentences ei−1 (resp. ej+1) and fk−1 (resp.
el+1) are aligned12.

The first case is when j < i or k > l, in which
case we create a null alignment for fk:l or for ei:j . In
all other situations, we compute:

∀i′, j′, k′, l′, i ≤ i′ ≤ j′ ≤ j, k ≤ k′ ≤ l′ ≤ l,
ai′,j′,k′,l′ = P (Y = 1|ei′:j′ , fk′:l′)− αS(i′, j′, k′, l′)

where ei′:j′ is obtained by concatenation of all the
sentences in the range [i′:j′], and S(i, j, k, l) = (j −
i+1)(l−k+1)−1 is proportional to the block size.
The factor αS(i′, j′, k′, l′) aims at penalizing large
blocks, which, for the sentence-based metrics, yield
much more errors than the small ones. This strategy
implies to compute O(|j − i + 1|2 × |k − l + 1|2)
probabilities, which, given the typical size of these
blocks (see above), can be performed very quickly.

These values are then iteratively visited by de-
creasing order in a greedy fashion. The top-scoring
block i′ : j′, k′ : l′ is retained in the final alignment;
all overlapping blocks are subsequently deleted from
the list and the next best entry is then considered.
This process continues until all remaining blocks
imply null alignments, in which case these n− 0 or
0− n alignments are also included in our solution.

This process is illustrated in Figure 3: assuming
that the best matching link is f2-e2, we delete all
the links that include f2 or e2, as well as links that
would imply a reordering of sentences, meaning that
we also delete links such as f1-e3.

3.3 Experiments
In this section, we report the results of experiments
run using again Jules Verne’s book from the BAF
corpus. Figures are reported in Table 3 where we
contrast our approach with two simple baselines:
(i) keep only Moore’s links; (ii) complete Moore’s
links with one single many-to-many alignment for

12We enclose the source and target texts between begin and
end markers to enforce alignment of the first and last sentences.

each block. For the maxent-based approach, we also
report the precision on just those links that are not
predicted by Moore. A more complete set of experi-
ments conducted with other portions of the BAF are
reported elsewhere (Yu et al., 2012) and have shown
to deliver state-of-the-art results.

As expected, complementing the very accurate
prediction of Moore’s systems with our links sig-
nificantly boosts the sentence-based alignment per-
formance: recall rises from 0.62 to 0.80 for α = 0,
which has a clear effect on the corresponding F-
measure (from 0.76 to 0.86). The performance dif-
ferences with the default strategy of keeping those
blocks unsegmented are also very clear. Sentence-
wise, maxent-based alignments are also quite pre-
cise, especially when the value of α is chosen with
care (P=0.91 for α=0.06); however, this optimiza-
tion has a very small overall effect, given that only a
limited number of alignment links are actually com-
puted by the maxent classifier.

4 Sentence alignment in the real world

In this section, we analyze the performance obtained
with our combined system, using excerpts of our
small corpus as test set. For this experiment, the
first two to three hundreds sentences in each book,
corresponding to approximately two chapters, were
manually aligned (by one annotator), using the same
guidelines that were used for annotating the BAF
corpus. Except for two books (EM and VF), produc-
ing these manual alignments was found to be quite
straightforward. Results are in Table 4.

A first comment is that both baselines are signifi-
cantly outperformed by our algorithm for almost all
conditions and books. For several books (LM, AM,
SW), the obtained sentence alignments are almost
as precise as those predicted by Moore and have a
much higher recall, resulting in very good overall
alignments. The situation is, of course, much less
satisfactory for other books (EM, VF, 5S). All in all,
our method salvages many useful sentence pairs that
would otherwise be left unaligned.

Moore’s method remains remarkably accurate
throughout the whole collection, even for the most
difficult books. It also outputs a significant propor-
tion of wrong links, which, for lack of reliable confi-
dence estimators, are difficult to spot and contribute
to introduce noise into the maxent training set.

The variation of performance can mostly be at-
tributed to idiosyncrasies in the translation. For in-
stance, Emma (EM) seems very difficult to align,
which can be attributed to the use of an old transla-
tion dating back to 1910 (by P. de Puliga), and which
often looks more like an adaptation than a transla-
tion. Some passages even question the possibility of
producing any sensible (human) alignment between
source and target13:

(en) Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by
matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off,
was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October
and November evening must be struggled through at Hart-
field, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella
and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
and give her pleasant society again.

(fr) La sœur d’Emma habitait Londres depuis son mariage,
c’est-à-dire, en réalité, à peu de distance; elle se trouvait

13In this excerpt, in addition to several approximations, the
end of the last sentence (and their children...) is not translated
in French.

néanmoins hors de sa portée journalière, et bien des longues
soirées d’automne devraient être passées solitairement à
Hartfield avant que Noël n’amenât la visite d’Isabelle et de
son mari.

Les confessions (CO) is much most faithful to the
content, yet, the translator has significantly departed
from Rousseau’s style14, mostly made up of short
sentences, and it is often the case that several French
sentences align with one single English sentence,
which is detrimental to Moore, and by ricochet, to
the quality of maxent predictions. A typical excerpt:

(fr) Pendant deux ans entiers je ne fus ni témoin ni victime
d’un sentiment violent. Tout nourrissait dans mon coeur les
dispositions qu’il reçut de la nature.

(en) Everything contributed to strengthen those propensities
which nature had implanted in my breast, and during the
two years I was neither the victim nor witness of any violent
emotions.

The same goes for Thackeray (VF), with a lot of re-
structurations of the sentences as demonstrated by
the uneven number of sentences on both sides of the
bitext. Lord Jim (LJ) poses another type of diffi-
culty: approximately 100 sentences are missing on
the French side, the rest of the text being fairly paral-
lel (more than 82% of the reference links are actually
1-to-1). Du côté de chez Swann (SW) represents the
other extreme of the spectrum, where the translation
sticks as much as possible to the very peculiar style
of Proust: nearly 90% of the reference alignments
are 1-to-1, which explains the very good F-measure
for this book.

It is difficult to analyze more precisely our er-
rors; however, a fairly typical pattern is the infer-
ence of a 1-to-1 link rather than a 2-to-1 link made
up of a short and a long sentence. An example from
Hugo (TM), where our approach prefers to leave
the second English sentence unaligned, even though
the corresponding segment (un enfant...) is the in
French sentence:

(fr) Dans tout le tronçon de route qui sépare la première tour
de la seconde tour, il n’y avait que trois passants, un enfant,
un homme et une femme.

(en) Throughout that portion of the highway which separates
the first from the second tower, only three foot-passengers
could be seen. These were a child, a man, and a woman.

A possible walk around for this problem would be
to also add a penalty for null alignments.

Table 4: Evaluating alignment systems on a sample of “real-world” books
For each book, we report the number of French and English test sentences, the number of reference links and standard performance
measures. For the maxent approach, we also report separately the number of empty (S = 0) and non-empty (S 6= 0) paragraphs.

5 Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we have presented a novel two-pass ap-
proach aimed at improving existing sentence align-
ment methods in contexts where (i) all sentences
need to be aligned and/or (ii) sentence alignment
confidence need to be computed. By running ex-
periments with several variants of this approach, we
have been able to show that it was able to signif-
icantly improve the bare results obtained with the
sole Moore alignment system. Our study shows
that the problem of sentence alignment for literary
texts is far from being solved and additional work
is needed to obtain alignments that could be used in
real applications, such as bilingual reading aids.

The maxent-based approach proposed here is thus
only a first step, and we intend to explore various
extensions: an obvious way to go is to use more
resources (larger training corpora, bilingual dictio-
naries, etc.) and add more features, such as part-of-
speech, lemmas, or alignment features as was done
in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005). We also plan to
provide a much tighter integration with Moore’s al-

gorithm, which already computes such alignments,
so as to avoid having to recompute them. Finally,
the greedy approach to link selection can easily be
replaced with an exact search based on dynamic pro-
gramming techniques, including dependencies with
the left and right alignment links.

Regarding applications, a next step will be to pro-
duce and evaluate sentence alignments for a much
larger and more diverse set of books, comprising
more than 100 novels, containing books in 7 lan-
guages (French, English, Spanish, Italian, German,
Russian, Portuguese) from various origins. Most
were collected on the Internet from Gutenberg, wik-
isource and GoogleBooks15, and some were col-
lected in the course of the Carmel project (Kraif et
al., 2007). A number of these books are translated
in more than one language, and some are raw OCR
outputs and have not been cleaned from errors.
