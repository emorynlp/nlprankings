Abstract

In this paper I present a Master’s thesis
proposal in syntax-based Statistical Machine
Translation. I propose to build discrimina-
tive SMT models using both tree-to-string
and tree-to-tree approaches. Translation and
language models will be represented mainly
through the use of Tree Automata and Tree
Transducers. These formalisms have im-
portant representational properties that makes
them well-suited for syntax modeling. I also
present an experiment plan to evaluate these
models through the use of a parallel corpus
written in English and Brazilian Portuguese.

1 Introduction

Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has domi-
nated Machine Translation (MT) research in the
last two decades. One of its variants, Phrase-based
SMT (PB-SMT), is currently considered the state
of the art in the area. However, since the advent
of PB-SMT by Koehn et al. (2003) and Och and
Ney (2004), purely statistical MT systems have not
achieved considerable improvements. So, new re-
search directions point toward the use of linguistic
resources integrated into SMT systems.

According to Lopez (2008), there are four steps
when building an SMT system: translational equiv-
alence modeling1, parameterization, parameter esti-
mation and decoding. This Master’s thesis proposal
aims to improve SMT systems by including syntac-
tic information in the first and second steps. There-

1For the remainder of this proposal, I will refer to this step
as simply translation model.

fore, I plan to investigate two approaches: the Tree-
to-String (TTS) and the Tree-to-Tree (TTT) models.
In the former, syntactic information is provided only
for the source language while in the latter, it is pro-
vided for both source and target languages.

There are many formal theories to represent
syntax in a language, like Context-free Gram-
mars (CFGs), Tree Substitution Grammars (TSGs),
Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) and all its syn-
chronous counterparts. In this work, I represent each
sentence as a constituent tree and use Tree Automata
(TAs) and Tree Transducers (TTs) in the language
and translation models.

Although this work is mainly language indepen-
dent, proof-of-concept experiments will be executed
on the English and Brazilian Portuguese (en-ptBR)
language pair. Previous research on factored trans-
lation for this pair (using morphological informa-
tion) showed that it improved the results in terms
of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and NIST (Dod-
dington, 2002) scores, as shown in Table 1 (Caseli
and Nunes, 2009). However, even factored transla-
tion models have limitations: many languages (and
Brazilian Portuguese is not an exception) have rela-
tively loose word order constraints and present long-
distance agreements that cannot be efficiently repre-
sented by those models. Such phenomena motivate
the use of more powerful models that take syntactic
information into account.

tion, reordering and translation rules, Nguyen et al.
(2008) uses synchronous CFGs rules and Liu et al.
(2006) uses TTs. Galley et al. (2006) also uses
transducer rules but extract them from parse trees in
target language instead (the string-to-tree approach
- STT). Works that apply the TTT model include
Gildea (2003) and Zhang et al. (2008). All those
works also include methods and algorithms for ef-
ficient rule extraction since it’s unfeasible to extract
all possible rules from a parsed corpus due to expo-
nential cost.

There have been research efforts to combine
syntax-based systems with phrase-based systems.
These works mainly try to incorporate non-syntatic
phrases into a syntax-based model: while Liu et al.
(2006) integrates bilingual phrase tables as separate
TTS templates, Zhang et al. (2008) uses an algo-
rithm to convert leaves in a parse tree to phrases be-
fore rule extraction.

Language models that take into account syntac-
tic aspects have also been an active research subject.
While works like Post and Gildea (2009) and Van-
deghinste (2009) focus solely on language modeling
itself, Graham and van Genabith (2010) shows an
experiment that incorporates a syntax-based model
into an PB-SMT system.

3 Tree automata and tree transducers

Tree Automata are similar to Finite-state Automata
(FSA), except they recognize trees instead of strings
(or sequences of words). Formally, FSA can only
represent Regular Languages and thus, cannot ef-
ficiently model several syntactic features, includ-
ing long-distance agreement. TA recognize the so-
called Regular Tree Languages (RTLs), which can
represent Context-free Languages (CFLs) since a set
of all syntactic trees of a CFL is an RTL (Comon
et al., 2007). However, it is important to note that

the reciprocal is not true: there are RTLs that cannot
be modeled by a CFL because those cannot capture
the inner structure of trees. Figure 1 shows such an
RTL, composed of two trees. If we extract an CFG
from this RTL it would have the recursive rule S→
SS, which would generate an infinite set of syntac-
tic trees. In other words, there isn’t an CFG capable
to generate only the syntactic trees contained in the
RTL shown in Figure 1. This feature implies that
RTLs have more representational power than CFLs.

As a Finite-state Transducer (FST) is an extension
of an FSA that produces strings, a Tree Transducer is
an extension of a TA that produces trees. An FST is
composed by an input RTL, an output RTL and a set
of transformation rules. Restrictions can be added to
the rules, leading to many TT variations, each with
its properties (Graehl et al., 2008). The variations
studied in this work are the xT (extended top-down,
for TTT models) and xTS (extended top-down tree-
to-string, for TTS models).

Top-down (T) transducers processes input trees
starting from its root and descending through its
nodes until it reaches the leaves, in contrast to
bottom-up transducers, which do the opposite. Fig-
ure 2 shows a T rule, where uppercase letters (NP)
represent symbols, lowercase letters (q, r, s) repre-
sent states and x1 and x2 are variables (formal def-
initions can be found in Comon et al. (2007)). De-
fault top-down transducers must have only one sym-
bol on the left-hand sides and thus cannot model
some syntactic transformations (like local reorder-
ing, for example) without relying on copy and delete
operations (Maletti et al., 2009). Extended top-
down transducers allow multiple symbols on left-
hand sides, making them more suited for syntax
modeling. This property is shown on Figure 3
(adapted from Maletti et al. (2009)). Tree-to-string
transducers simply drop the tree structure on right-

37



hand sides, which makes them adequate for transla-
tion models wihtout syntactic information in one of
the languages. Figure 4 shows an example of a xTS
rule, applied for the en-ptBR pair.

4 SMT Model

The systems will be implemented using a discrim-
inative, log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), us-
ing the language and translation models as feature
functions. Settings that uses more features besides
those two models will also be built. In particu-
lar, I will investigate settings that incorporate non-
syntactic phrases, using methods similar to Liu et al.
(2006) and Zhang et al. (2008)

The translation models will be weighted TTs
(Graehl et al., 2008), which add probabilities to the
rules. These probabilities will be learned by an EM
algorithm similar to the one described in Graehl et
al. (2008). Rule extraction for TTS will be similar
to the GHKM algorithm described in Galley et al.
(2004) but I also plan to investigate the approaches
used by Liu et al. (2006) and Nguyen et al. (2008).
For TTT rule extraction, I will use a method similar
to the one described in Zhang et al. (2008).

I also plan to use language models which takes
into account syntactic properties. Although most
works in syntactic language models uses tree gram-
mars like TSGs and TAGs, these can be simulated by
TAs and TTs (Shieber, 2004; Maletti, 2010). This
property can help the systems implementation be-
cause it’s possible to unite language and translation
modeling in one TT toolkit.

5.1 Materials

To implement and evaluate the techniques described,
a parallel corpus with syntactic annotation is re-
quired. As the focus of this thesis is the English and
Brazilian Portuguese language pair, I will use the
PesquisaFAPESP corpus2 in my experiments. This
corpus is composed of 646 scientific papers, origi-
nally written in Brazilian Portuguese and manually
translated into English, resulting in about 17,000
parallel sentences. As for syntactic annotation, I will
use the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) for

Brazilian Portuguese.

In addition to the corpora and parsers, the follow-
ing tools will be used:

• GIZA++3 (Och and Ney, 2000) for lexical
alignment

• Tiburon4 (May and Knight, 2006) for trans-
ducer training in both TTS and TTT systems

• Moses5 (Koehn et al., 2007) for decoding

5.2 Experiments and evaluation
Initially the corpus will be parsed using the tools de-
scribed in section 5.1 and divided into a training set
and a test set. For the TTS systems (one for each
translation direction), the training set will be lexi-
cally aligned using GIZA++ and for the TTT system,
its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniques
similar to the ones proposed by Gildea (2003) and
by Zhang et al. (2008). Both TTS and TTT systems
will be implemented using Tiburon and Moses. For
evaluation, BLEU and NIST scores on the test set
will be used. The baseline will be the score for fac-
tored translation, shown in Table 1.
