Abstract

In this paper we deal with Named En-
tity Recognition (NER) on transcriptions of
French broadcast data. Two aspects make
the task more difficult with respect to previ-
ous NER tasks: i) named entities annotated
used in this work have a tree structure, thus
the task cannot be tackled as a sequence la-
belling task; ii) the data used are more noisy
than data used for previous NER tasks. We
approach the task in two steps, involving
Conditional Random Fields and Probabilis-
tic Context-Free Grammars, integrated in a
single parsing algorithm. We analyse the
effect of using several tree representations.
Our system outperforms the best system of
the evaluation campaign by a significant
margin.

1 Introduction

Named Entity Recognition is a traditinal task of
the Natural Language Processing domain. The
task aims at mapping words in a text into seman-
tic classes, such like persons, organizations or lo-
calizations. While at first the NER task was quite
simple, involving a limited number of classes (Gr-
ishman and Sundheim, 1996), along the years
the task complexity increased as more complex
class taxonomies were defined (Sekine and No-
bata, 2004). The interest in the task is related to
its use in complex frameworks for (semantic) con-
tent extraction, such like Relation Extraction ap-
plications (Doddington et al., 2004).

This work presents research on a Named Entity
Recognition task defined with a new set of named
entities. The characteristic of such set is in that
named entities have a tree structure. As conce-
quence the task cannot be tackled as a sequence

labelling approach. Additionally, the use of noisy
data like transcriptions of French broadcast data,
makes the task very challenging for traditional
NLP solutions. To deal with such problems, we
adopt a two-steps approach, the first being real-
ized with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Laf-
ferty et al., 2001), the second with a Probabilistic
Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) (Johnson, 1998).
The motivations behind that are:

• Since the named entities have a tree struc-
ture, it is reasonable to use a solution com-
ing from syntactic parsing. However pre-
liminary experiments using such approaches
gave poor results.

• Despite the tree-structure of the entities,
trees are not as complex as syntactic trees,
thus, before designing an ad-hoc solution for
the task, which require a remarkable effort
and yet it doesn’t guarantee better perfor-
mances, we designed a solution providing
good results and which required a limited de-
velopment effort.

• Conditional Random Fields are models ro-
bust to noisy data, like automatic transcrip-
tions of ASR systems (Hahn et al., 2010),
thus it is the best choice to deal with tran-
scriptions of broadcast data. Once words
have been annotated with basic entity con-
stituents, the tree structure of named entities
is simple enough to be reconstructed with
relatively simple model like PCFG (Johnson,
1998).

The two models are integrated in a single pars-
ing algorithm. We analyze the effect of the use of

several tree representations, which result in differ-
ent parsing models with different performances.
We provide a detailed evaluation of our mod-
els. Results can be compared with those obtained
in the evaluation campaign where the same data
were used. Our system outperforms the best sys-
tem of the evaluation campaign by a significant
margin.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in
the next section we introduce the extended named
entities used in this work, in section 3 we describe
our two-steps algorithm for parsing entity trees,
in section 4 we detail the second step of our ap-
proach based on syntactic parsing approaches, in
particular we describe the different tree represen-
tations used in this work to encode entity trees
in parsing models. In section 6 we describe and
comment experiments, and finally, in section 7,
we draw some conclusions.

2 Extended Named Entities

The most important aspect of the NER task we
investigated is provided by the tree structure of
named entities. Examples of such entities are
given in figure 1 and 2, where words have been re-
move for readability issues and are: (“90 persons
are still present at Atambua. It’s there that 3 employ-
ees of the High Conseil of United Nations for refugees
have been killed yesterday morning”):

90 personnes toujours présentes à
Atambua c’ est là qu’ hier matin ont
été tués 3 employés du haut commis-
sariat des Nations unies aux réfugiés ,
le HCR

Words realizing entities in figure 2 are in bold,
and they correspond to the tree leaves in the
picture. As we see in the figures, entities
can have complex structures. Beyond the use
of subtypes, like individual in person (to give
pers.ind), or administrative in organization
(to give org.adm), entities with more specific con-
tent can be constituents of more general enti-
ties to form tree structures, like name.first and

These named entities have been annotated on
transcriptions of French broadcast news coming
from several radio channels. The transcriptions
constitute a corpus that has been split into train-
ing, development and evaluation sets.The evalu-
ation set, in particular, is composed of two set
of data, Broadcast News (BN in the table) and
Broadcast Conversations (BC in the table). The
evaluation of the models presented in this work
is performed on the merge of the two data types.
Some statistics of the corpus are reported in ta-
ble 1 and 2. This set of named entities has been
defined in order to provide more fine semantic in-
formation for entities found in the data, e.g. a
person is better specified by first and last name,
and is fully described in (Grouin, 2011) . In or-
der to avoid confusion, entities that can be associ-
ated directly to words, like name.first, name.last,
val and object, are called entity constituents, com-
ponents or entity pre-terminals (as they are pre-
terminals nodes in the trees). The other entities,
like pers.ind or amount, are called entities or non-
terminal entities, depending on the context.

3 Models Cascade for Extended Named
Entities

sented here cannot be modeled as sequence la-
belling and, as mentioned previously, an approach

Figure 3: Processing schema of the two-steps approach proposed
in this work: CRF plus PCFG

coming from syntactic parsing to perform named
entity annotation in “one-shot” is not robust on
the data used in this work, we adopt a two-steps.
The first is designed to be robust to noisy data and
is used to annotate entity components, while the
second is used to parse complete entity trees and
is based on a relatively simple model. Since we
are dealing with noisy data, the hardest part of the
task is indeed to annotate components on words.
On the other hand, since entity trees are relatively
simple, at least much simpler than syntactic trees,
once entity components have been annotated in a
first step, for the second step, a complex model is
not required, which would also make the process-
ing slower. Taking all these issues into account,
the two steps of our system for tree-structured
named entity recognition are performed as fol-
lows:

1. A CRF model (Lafferty et al., 2001) is used
to annotate components on words.

2. A PCFG model (Johnson, 1998) is used
to parse complete entity trees upon compo-
nents, i.e. using components annotated by
CRF as starting point.

This processing schema is depicted in figure 3.
Conditional Random Fields are described shortly
in the next subsection. PCFG models, constituting
the main part of this work together with the analy-
sis over tree representations, is described more in
details in the next sections.

3.1 Conditional Random Fields

CRFs are particularly suitable for sequence la-
belling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001). Beyond the
possibility to include a huge number of features
using the same framework as Maximum Entropy
models (Berger et al., 1996), CRF models en-
code global conditional probabilities normalized
at sentence level.

Given a sequence of N words WN1 =
w1, ..., wN and its corresponding components se-
quence EN1 = e1, ..., eN , CRF trains the condi-
tional probabilities

P (EN1 |WN1 ) =

1

Z

NY
n=1

exp

 
MX
m=1

λm · hm(en−1, en, wn+2n−2)
!

(1)

where λm are the training parameters.
hm(en−1, en, wn+2n−2) are the feature functions
capturing dependencies of entities and words. Z
is the partition function:

Z =
X
ẽN1

NY
n=1

H(ẽn−1, ẽn, w
n+2
n−2) (2)

which ensures that probabilities sum up to one.
ẽn−1 and ẽn are components for previous and cur-
rent words, H(ẽn−1, ẽn, wn+2n−2) is an abbreviation
for

∑M
m=1 λm · hm(en−1, en, w

n+2
n−2), i.e. the set

of active feature functions at current position in
the sequence.

In the last few years different CRF implemen-
tations have been realized. The implementation
we refer in this work is the one described in
(Lavergne et al., 2010), which optimize the fol-
lowing objective function:

−log(P (EN1 |WN1 )) + ρ1‖λ‖1 +
ρ2

2
‖λ‖22 (3)

‖λ‖1 and ‖λ‖22 are the l1 and l2 regulariz-
ers (Riezler and Vasserman, 2004), and together
in a linear combination implement the elastic net
regularizer (Zou and Hastie, 2005). As mentioned
in (Lavergne et al., 2010), this kind of regulariz-
ers are very effective for feature selection at train-
ing time, which is a very good point when dealing
with noisy data and big set of features.

4 Models for Parsing Trees

The models used in this work for parsing en-
tity trees refer to the models described in (John-
son, 1998), in (Charniak, 1997; Caraballo and
Charniak, 1997) and (Charniak et al., 1998), and
which constitutes the basis of the maximum en-
tropy model for parsing described in (Charniak,
2000). A similar lexicalized model has been pro-
posed also by Collins (Collins, 1997). All these
models are based on a PCFG trained from data
and used in a chart parsing algorithm to find the
best parse for the given input. The PCFG model
of (Johnson, 1998) is made of rules of the form:

• Xi ⇒ XjXk

• Xi ⇒ w

where X are non-terminal entities and w are
terminal symbols (words in our case).1 The prob-
ability associated to these rules are:

pi→j,k =
P (Xi ⇒ Xj , Xk)

P (Xi)
(4)

pi→w =
P (Xi ⇒ w)
P (Xi)

(5)

The models described in (Charniak, 1997;
Caraballo and Charniak, 1997) encode probabil-
ities involving more information, such as head
words. In order to have a PCFG model made of
rules with their associated probabilities, we ex-
tract rules from the entity trees of our corpus. This
processing is straightforward, for example from
the tree depicted in figure 2, the following rules
are extracted:

S⇒ amount loc.adm.town time.dat.rel amount
amount⇒ val object
time.date.rel⇒ name time-modifier
object⇒ func.coll
func.coll⇒ kind org.adm
org.adm⇒ name

Using counts of these rules we then compute
maximum likelihood probabilities of the Right
Hand Side (RHS) of the rule given its Left Hand
Side (LHS). Also binarization of rules, applied to

1These rules are actually in Chomsky Normal Form, i.e.
unary or binary rules only. A PCFG, in general, can have any
rule, however, the algorithm we are discussing convert the
PCFG rules into Chomsky Normal Form, thus for simplicity
we provide directly such formulation.

model

ing model

have all rules in the form of 4 and 5, is straight-
forward and can be done with simple algorithms
not discussed here.

4.1 Tree Representations for Extended
Named Entities

As discussed in (Johnson, 1998), an important
point for a parsing algorithm is the representation
of trees being parsed. Changing the tree represen-
tation can change significantly the performances
of the parser. Since there is a large difference be-
tween entity trees used in this work and syntac-
tic trees, from both meaning and structure point
of view, it is worth performing an analysis with
the aim of finding the most suitable representa-
tion for our task. In order to perform this analy-
sis, we start from a named entity annotated on the
words de notre president , M. Nicolas Sarkozy(of
our president, Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy). The corre-
sponding named entity is shown in figure 4. As
decided in the annotation guidelines, fillers can be
part of a named entity. This can happen for com-
plex named entities involving several words. The
representation shown in figure 4 is the default rep-
resentation and will be referred to as baseline. A
problem created by this representation is the fact
that fillers are present also outside entities. Fillers
of named entities should be, in principle, distin-
guished from any other filler, since they may be
informative to discriminate entities.

Following this intuition, we designed two dif-
ferent representations where entity fillers are con-

177



Figure 6: Parent-context tree representations used in the PCFG
parsing model

Figure 7: Parent-node tree representations used in the PCFG pars-
ing model

textualized so that to be distinguished from the
other fillers. In the first representation we give to
the filler the same label of the parent node, while
in the second representation we use a concatena-
tion of the filler and the label of the parent node.
These two representations are shown in figure 5
and 6, respectively. The first one will be referred
to as filler-parent, while the second will be re-
ferred as parent-context. A problem that may be
introduced by the first representation is that some
entities that originally were used only for non-
terminal entities will appear also as components,
i.e. entities annotated on words. This may intro-
duce some ambiguity.

Another possible contextualization can be to
annotate each node with the label of the parent
node. This representation is shown in figure 7
and will be referred to as parent-node. Intuitively,
this representation is effective since entities an-
notated directly on words provide also the en-
tity of the parent node. However this representa-
tion increases drastically the number of entities,
in particular the number of components, which
in our case are the set of labels to be learned by
the CRF model. For the same reason this repre-
sentation produces more rigid models, since label
sequences vary widely and thus is not likely to
match sequences not seen in the training data.

Finally, another interesting tree representation
is a variation of the parent-node tree, where en-
tity fillers are only distinguished from fillers not
in an entity, using the label ne-filler, but they are
not contextualized with entity information. This
representation is shown in figure 8 and it will be

Figure 8: Parent-node-filler tree representations used in the PCFG
parsing model

referred to as parent-node-filler. This representa-
tion is a good trade-off between contextual infor-
mation and rigidity, by still representing entities
as concatenation of labels, while using a common
special label for entity fillers. This allows to keep
lower the number of entities annotated on words,
i.e. components.

Using different tree representations affects both
the structure and the performance of the parsing
model. The structure is described in the next sec-
tion, the performance in the evaluation section.

4.2 Structure of the Model
Lexicalized models for syntactic parsing de-
scribed in (Charniak, 2000; Charniak et al., 1998)
and (Collins, 1997), integrate more information
than what is used in equations 4 and 5. Consider-
ing a particular node in the entity tree, not includ-
ing terminals, the information used is:

• s: the head word of the node, i.e. the most
important word of the chunk covered by the
current node

• h: the head word of the parent node

• t: the entity tag of the current node

• l: the entity tag of the parent node

The head word of the parent node is defined
percolating head words from children nodes to
parent nodes, giving the priority to verbs. They
can be found using automatic approaches based
on words and entity tag co-occurrence or mutual
information. Using this information, the model
described in (Charniak et al., 1998) is P (s|h, t, l).
This model being conditioned on several pieces
of information, it can be affected by data sparsity
problems. Thus, the model is actually approxi-
mated as an interpolation of probabilities:

P (s|h, t, l) =

λ1P (s|h, t, l) + λ2P (s|ch, t, l)+

λ3P (s|t, l) + λ4P (s|t) (6)

178



where λi, i = 1, ..., 4, are parameters of the
model to be tuned, and ch is the cluster of head
words for a given entity tag t. With such model,
when not all pieces of information are available to
estimate reliably the probability with more con-
ditioning, the model can still provide a proba-
bility with terms conditioned with less informa-
tion. The use of head words and their percola-
tion over the tree is called lexicalization. The
goal of tree lexicalization is to add lexical infor-
mation all over the tree. This way the probabil-
ity of all rules can be conditioned also on lexi-
cal information, allowing to define the probabili-
ties P (s|h, t, l) and P (s|ch, t, l). Tree lexicaliza-
tion reflects the characteristics of syntactic pars-
ing, for which the models described in (Charniak,
2000; Charniak et al., 1998) and (Collins, 1997)
were defined. Head words are very informative
since they constitute keywords instantiating la-
bels, regardless if they are syntactic constituents
or named entities. However, for named entity
recognition it doesn’t make sense to give prior-
ity to verbs when percolating head words over the
tree, even more because head words of named en-
tities are most of the time nouns. Moreover, it
doesn’t make sense to give priority to the head
word of a particular entity with respect to the oth-
ers, all entities in a sentence have the same im-
portance. Intuitively, lexicalization of entity trees
is not straightforward as lexicalization of syntac-
tic trees. At the same time, using not lexicalized
trees doesn’t make sense with models like 6, since
all the terms involve lexical information. Instead,
we can use the model of (Johnson, 1998), which
define the probability of a tree τ as:

P (τ) =
Y
X→α

P (X → α)Cτ (X→α) (7)

here the RHS of rules has been generalized with
α, representing RHS of both unary and binary
rules 4 and 5. Cτ (X → α) is the number of times
the rule X → α appears in the tree τ . The model
7 is instantiated when using tree representations
shown in Fig. 4, 5 and 6. When using representa-
tions given in Fig. 7 and 8, the model is:

P (τ |l) (8)

where l is the entity label of the parent node.
Although non-lexicalized models like 7 and 8

have shown less effective for syntactic parsing
than their lexicalized couter-parts, there are evi-
dences showing that they can be effective in our
task. With reference to figure 4, considering the
entity pers.ind instantiated by Nicolas Sarkozy,
our algorithm detects first name.first for Nicolas
and name.last for Sarkozy using the CRF model.
As mentioned earlier, once the CRF model has de-
tected components, since entity trees have not a
complex structure with respect to syntactic trees,
even a simple model like the one in equation 7
or 8 is effective for entity tree parsing. For ex-
ample, once name.first and name.last have been
detected by CRF, pers.ind is the only entity hav-
ing name.first and name.last as children. Am-
biguities, like for example for kind or qualifier,
which can appear in many entities, can affect the
model 7, but they are overcome by the model 8,
taking the entity tag of the parent node into ac-
count. Moreover, the use of CRF allows to in-
clude in the model much more features than the
lexicalized model in equation 6. Using features
like word prefixes (P), suffixes (S), capitalization
(C), morpho-syntactic features (MS) and other
features indicated as F2, the CRF model encodes
the conditional probability:

P (t|w,P, S, C,MS, F ) (9)

where w is an input word and t is the corre-
sponding component.

The probability of the CRF model, used in the
first step to tag input words with components,
is combined with the probability of the PCFG
model, used to parse entity trees starting from
components. Thus the structure of our model is:

P (t|w,P, S, C,MS, F ) · P (τ) (10)

or
P (t|w,P, S, C,MS, F ) · P (τ |l) (11)

depending if we are using the tree representa-
tion given in figure 4, 5 and 6 or in figure 7 and 8,
respectively. A scale factor could be used to com-
bine the two scores, but this is optional as CRFs
can provide normalized posterior probabilities.

2The set of features used in the CRF model will be de-
scribed in more details in the evaluation section.

5 Related Work

While the models used for named entity detection
and the set of named entities defined along the
years have been discussed in the introduction and
in section 2, since CRFs and models for parsing
constitute the main issue in our work, we discuss
some important models here.

Beyond the models for parsing discussed in
section 4, together with motivations for using or
not in our work, another important model for syn-
tactic parsing has been proposed in (Ratnaparkhi,
1999). Such model is made of four Maximum
Entropy models used in cascade for parsing at
different stages. Also this model makes use of
head words, like those described in section 4, thus
the same considerations hold, moreover it seems
quite complex for real applications, as it involves
the use of four different models together. The
models described in (Johnson, 1998), (Charniak,
1997; Caraballo and Charniak, 1997), (Charniak
et al., 1998), (Charniak, 2000), (Collins, 1997)
and (Ratnaparkhi, 1999), constitute the main in-
dividual models proposed for constituent-based
syntactic parsing. Later other approaches based
on models combination have been proposed, like
e.g. the reranking approach described in (Collins
and Koo, 2005), among many, and also evolutions
or improvements of these models.

More recently, approaches based on log-linear
models have been proposed (Clark and Curran,
2007; Finkel et al., 2008) for parsing, called also
“Tree CRF”, using also different training criteria
(Auli and Lopez, 2011). Using such models in our
work has basically two problems: one related to
scaling issues, since our data present a large num-
ber of labels, which makes CRF training problem-
atic, even more when using “Tree CRF”; another
problem is related to the difference between syn-
tactic parsing and named entity detection tasks,
as mentioned in sub-section 4.2. Adapting “Tree
CRF” to our task is thus a quite complex work, it
constitutes an entire work by itself, we leave it as
feature work.

Concerning linear-chain CRF models, the
one we use is a state-of-the-art implementation
(Lavergne et al., 2010), as it implements the
most effective optimization algorithms as well as
state-of-the-art regularizers (see sub-section 3.1).
Some improvement of linear-chain CRF have
been proposed, trying to integrate higher order

target-side features (Tang et al., 2006). An inte-
gration of the same kind of features has been tried
also in the model used in this work, without giv-
ing significant improvements, but making model
training much harder. Thus, this direction has not
been further investigated.

6 Evaluation

In this section we describe experiments performed
to evaluate our models. We first describe the set-
tings used for the two models involved in the en-
tity tree parsing, and then describe and comment
the results obtained on the test corpus.

6.1 Settings
The CRF implementation used in this work is de-
scribed in (Lavergne et al., 2010), named wapiti.3

We didn’t optimize parameters ρ1 and ρ2 of the
elastic net (see section 3.1), although this im-
proves significantly the performances and leads
to more compact models, default values lead in
most cases to very accurate models. We used a
wide set of features in CRF models, in a window
of [−2,+2] around the target word:

• A set of standard features like word prefixes
and suffixes of length from 1 to 6, plus some
Yes/No features like Does the word start with
capital letter?, etc.

• Morpho-syntactic features extracted from
the output of the tool tagger (Allauzen and
Bonneau-Maynard, 2008)

• Features extracted from the output of the se-
mantic analyzer (Rosset et al., (2009)) pro-
vided by the tool WMatch (Galibert, 2009).

This analysis morpho-syntactic information as
well as semantic information at the same level
of named entities. Using two different sets of
morpho-syntactic features results in more effec-
tive models, as they create a kind of agreement
for a given word in case of match. Concerning
the PCFG model, grammars, tree binarization and
the different tree representations are created with
our own scripts, while entity tree parsing is per-
formed with the chart parsing algorithm described
in (Johnson, 1998).4

6.2 Evaluation Metrics

All results are expressed in terms of Slot Error
Rate (SER) (Makhoul et al., 1999) which has a
similar definition of word error rate for ASR sys-
tems, with the difference that substitution errors
are split in three types: i) correct entity type with
wrong segmentation; ii) wrong entity type with
correct segmentation; iii) wrong entity type with
wrong segmentation; here, i) and ii) are given half
points, while iii), as well as insertion and deletion
errors, are given full points. Moreover, results are
given using the well known F1 measure, defined
as a function of precision and recall.

6.3 Results

In this section we provide evaluations of the mod-
els described in this work, based on combination
of CRF and PCFG and using different tree repre-
sentations of named entity trees.

6.3.1 Model Statistics
As a first evaluation, we describe some statis-

tics computed from the CRF and PCFG models
using the tree representations. Such statistics pro-
vide interesting clues of how difficult is learning
the task and which performance we can expect
from the model. Statistics for this evaluation are
presented in table 3. Rows corresponds to the dif-
ferent tree representations described in this work,
while in the columns we show the number of fea-
tures and labels for the CRF models (# features
and # labels), and the number of rules for PCFG
models (# rules).

As we can see from the table, the number
of rules is the same for the tree representations
baseline, filler-parent and parent-context, and
for the representations parent-node and parent-
node-filler. This is the consequence of the con-
textualization applied by the latter representa-
tions, i.e. parent-node and parent-node-filler
create several different labels depending from
the context, thus the corresponding grammar

will have more rules. For example, the rule
pers.ind⇒ name.first name.last can
appear as it is or contextualized with func.ind,
like in figure 8. In contrast the other tree repre-
sentations modify only fillers, thus the number of
rules is not affected.

Concerning CRF models, as shown in table 3,
the use of the different tree representations results
in an increasing number of labels to be learned by
CRF. This aspect is quite critical in CRF learn-
ing, as training time is exponential in the number
of labels. Indeed, the most complex models, ob-
tained with parent-node and parent-node-filler
tree representations, took roughly 8 days for train-
ing. Additionally, increasing the number of labels
can create data sparseness problems, however this
problem doesn’t seem to arise in our case since,
apart the baseline model which has quite less fea-
tures, all the others have approximately the same
number of features, meaning that there are actu-
ally enough data to learn the models, regardless
the number of labels.

6.3.2 Evaluations of Tree Representations
In this section we evaluate the models in terms

of the evaluation metrics described in previous
section, Slot Error Rate (SER) and F1 measure.

In order to evaluate PCFG models alone, we
performed entity tree parsing using as input ref-
erence transcriptions, i.e. manual transcriptions
and reference component annotations taken from
development and test sets. This can be consid-
ered a kind of oracle evaluations and provides us
an upper bound of the performance of the PCFG
models. Results for this evaluation are reported in

table 4. As it can be intuitively expected, adding
more contextualization in the trees results in more
accurate models, the simplest model, baseline,
has the worst oracle performance, filler-parent
and parent-context models, adding similar con-
textualization information, have very similar ora-
cle performances. Same line of reasoning applies
to models parent-node and parent-node-filler,
which also add similar contextualization and have
very similar oracle predictions. These last two
models have also the best absolute oracle perfor-
mances. However, adding more contextualization
in the trees results also in more rigid models, the
fact that models are robust on reference transcrip-
tions and based on reference component annota-
tions, doesn’t imply a proportional robustness on
component sequences generated by CRF models.

This intuition is confirmed from results re-
ported in table 5, where a real evaluation of our
models is reported, using this time CRF out-
put components as input to PCFG models, to
parse entity trees. The results reported in ta-
ble 5 show in particular that models using base-
line, filler-parent and parent-context tree repre-
sentations have similar performances, especially
on test set. Models characterized by parent-node
and parent-node-filler tree representations have
indeed the best performances, although the gain
with respect to the other models is not as much
as it could be expected given the difference in
the oracle performances discussed above. In par-
ticular the best absolute performance is obtained
with the model parent-node-filler. As we men-
tioned in subsection 4.1, this model represents the
best trade-off between rigidity and accuracy using
the same label for all entity fillers, but still distin-
guishing between fillers found in entity structures
and other fillers found in words not instantiating
any entity.

6.3.3 Comparison with Official Results

As a final evaluation of our models, we pro-
vide a comparison of official results obtained at

the 2011 evaluation campaign of extended named
entity recognition (Galibert et al., 2011; 2) Re-
sults are reported in table 6, where the other two
participants to the campaign are indicated as P1
and P2. These two participants P1 and P2, used
a system based on CRF, and rules for deep syn-
tactic analysis, respectively. In particular, P2 ob-
tained superior performances in previous evalua-
tion campaign on named entity recognition. The
system we proposed at the evaluation campaign
used a parent-context tree representation. The
results obtained at the evaluation campaign are
in the first three lines of Table 6. We compare
such results with those obtained with the parent-
node and parent-node-filler tree representations,
reported in the last two rows of the same table. As
we can see, the new tree representations described
in this work allow to achieve the best absolute per-
formances.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a Named Entity
Recognition system dealing with extended named
entities with a tree structure. Given such represen-
tation of named entities, the task cannot be mod-
eled as a sequence labelling approach. We thus
proposed a two-steps system based on CRF and
PCFG. CRF annotate entity components directly
on words, while PCFG apply parsing techniques
to predict the whole entity tree. We motivated
our choice by showing that it is not effective to
apply techniques used widely for syntactic pars-
ing, like for example tree lexicalization. We pre-
sented an analysis of different tree representations
for PCFG, which affect significantly parsing per-
formances.

We provided and discussed a detailed evalua-
tion of all the models obtained by combining CRF
and PCFG with the different tree representation
proposed. Our combined models result in better
performances with respect to other models pro-
posed at the official evaluation campaign, as well
as our previous model used also at the evaluation
campaign.
