Abstract 

This paper proposes the definition, classification and structure of the Kazakh basic phrases, and sets up a 

framework for classifying them according to their syntactic functions. Meanwhile, the structure of the 

Kazakh basic phrases were analyzed; and the determination of the Kazakh basic phrases collocation and 

extraction of the Kazakh basic phrases based on rules were followed. The Maximum Entropy (ME) 

model uses for the identification of the phrases from texts and achieved a result of automatic identifica-

tion of Kazakh phrases with an accuracy of 78.22% based on rules System and additional artificial mod-

ification. Design feature of this ME model join rely on templates of Kazakh Word, part of speech, affix-

es. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate reached 87.89％． 

 

1 Introduction 

Automatic phrase identification is an important task in natural language processing. A phrase is a 

group of words that work together. Phrase recognition is a grammatical unit agent between words and 

sentences in natural language processing. Phrase identification Parser has been developed for different 

languages, for example, the Church's Base NP Recognition for English (Church, 1988). The rule-based 

Model and Maximum Entropy Model (ME) are the most commonly used technology for phrase repre-

sentation and parsing. 

Kazakh Language belongs to the Turkish Language group in the Altaic language family. It is an agglu-

tinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational or inflectional affixes to root 

words. Phrase identification is also an indispensable part for Kazakh information processing. In the 

past a few year, we have put forward methods for Kazakh morphological analysis, which includes 

stem extraction, part of speech(POS) tagging, spelling check, etc. Recently, we are working on syntax 

parsing, analysis of phrase structure, automatic identification of phrase and in-depth analysis of sen-

tence structure. 

Kazakh phrases are syntactic units consisting of two or more than two words. The phrases can be clas-

sified into two categories, which are free phrase and fixed phrase. We are exploring methods which 

are more suitable for shallow syntactic parsing of Kazakh according to the nature of Kazakh language. 

The research includes a systematic study on information regularity and disambiguation of the Kazakh 

phrase, and automatic recognition of basic phrases of Kazakh language. We have developed a rule-

based method for the automatic recognition of Kazakh basic phrases, and automatic identification of 

verb phrase, noun phrase and adjective phrase based on maximum entropy in Kazakh language at the 

same time. Moreover, the ambiguity of structures is also resolved based on rules. 

This study solves the problem of Kazakh phrase recognition by providing some effective methods. 

This sets up a basis for further syntactic process and tree bank building. This research also provides a 

way to build database for various fields like knowledge acquisition, syntactic understanding, Chinese-

Kazakh machine translation, the process of large-scale corpus, etc.

In this paper, our work focuses on identifying noun phrases, adjective phrase and verb phrases, which 

are the most difficult aspects of Kazakh phrase recognition analysis. This is achieved by using rules 

are ME method. 

2 Related work 

There are a variety of techniques used for phrase recognition, which include rule-based technique, sta-

tistical technique, and a combination of them. Church's (1988) approach used manual or semi-

automatic annotation phrase corpus as a training corpus. Another popular method is to use a Chunk 

parsing for statistics model to determine the boundary (Koeling, 2000). Chunk parsing was first intro-

duced by Abney (1991), which is one of the most widely used syntactic parsing methods. The main 

idea of chunk parsing lies in seeking the appropriate breakthrough point, and decomposing the full 

parsing problems into a syntax topology statistical structure and syntactic relations. Zhao and Huang 

(1998) are pioneers in Chinese phrase studies; Tsinghua University had also completed its TCT 

(Tsinghua Chinese Treebank) for Chinese (Zhou, 2004). The method has been also applied into studies 

of other languages, such as Kazakh Base NP recognition (Altenbek et al, 2009), and Uyghur Base VP 

Recognition by CRF (Mamatmin et al, 2012). 

Maximum Entropy was first introduced to NLP area by Berger et al (1996) and Della Pietra et al. 

(1997). Maximum Entropy is an extremely flexible technique for linguistic modelling. It can use a vir-

tually unrestricted and rich feature set in the framework of a probability model. It is a conditional, dis-

criminative model and allows mutually dependent variables (Ratnaparkhi, 1999). 

3 Kazakh Phase Parsing 

3.1 Kazakh Morphology 

Morphological analysis is an important task in natural language processing research. It was developed 

for different languages, included English  (Porter, 1980), Finnish  (Karttunen, 1983), Turkish  (Oflaz-

er, 1994; Gülşen, 2004), and Arabic (Beesley, 1996). 

Comparing with other languages, the Kazakh morphological system uses a large number of suffixes 

and a small number of prefixes. Every word has a root, or a stem (Milat, 2003;Zhang 2004). The basic 

Kazakh phrase is an adjacent and non-nested phrase which does not contain recursive structure.  

3.2 The Categories of Kazakh Phrase 

Parsing is one of the most basic and fundamental components in natural language processing. Chunk 

parsing intends to obtain a fragment without thinking deeply.  

A Kazakh phrase is composed of two or more than two words which connected with meaning and 

grammatical structure. There is only a core word in a Kazakh phrase. In the case of Kazakh, Kazakh 

phrases can be divided into fixed phrases and temporary phrases by the meanings of the phrases.  

Abney propose the first complete description of lexical chunks system. In this study the basic phrase 

chunks base was found according to Abney’s system. The five most common phrase in Kazakh are  

NO. Category Explanation Example (Kazakh) Example (English） 
1 NP noun phrase  The golden autumn 
2 VP verb phrase  Achieve dreams 

3 ADJP adjective phrase  Very clean 

4 NUMP Numeral phrases  Eight & nine thousand 

5 ADVP Adverb phrase  The front of 

Table 1.  Part of Kazakh phrase categories.

noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, Numeral phrases, Adverb phrase as shown in table 1. 

Kazakh language is rich in the external morphology which shows prominent in phrase structure. 

3.3 The Basic Kazakh phrase mark specification 

Basic Kazakh phrase marks both its own attribute, for example part of speech, stems and affixes, and 

types of phrase. We used IOB Tagging to mark the start and end of chunks. 

Basic Kazakh phrase start of chunks Inner tag of chunks Out tag of chunks 

noun phrase B-NP I-NP  

 

O 
verb phrase B-VP I-VP 

adjective phrase B-ADJP I-ADJP 

Adverb phrases B-ADVP I-ADVP 

Numeral phrase B-NUMP I-NUMP 

Table 2.  The Basic Kazakh phrase IOB Tagging. 

4 Statistics and Analysis of Kazakh Phrase Structure 

Referring to modern Kazakh grammar (Milat, 2003; Dingjing Zhong. 2004), the basic rules of phrase 

structure of Kazakh language was summarized. The phrase structures are extracted from the corpus, 

and a set of rules are created based on it as well.  

In the representation of basic phrase structures, the following part of speech tagging symbols are used 

in XML documents of Kazakh corpus: v (verb), n. (noun), adj. (adjective), num. (number), adv. (ad-

verb), pron. (pronoun), ono. (onomatopoeia), int.(interjections), conj. (conjunction), part. (partical). 

The Kazakh phrases Structure divided by the function of phrases in our system are shown below.   

Kazakh verb phrase structure: 

1) n+v;   2) v+v;   3) adv+v;  4) adj+v;  5) v+adv;  6) v+v+v;  7) pron+v; 8) n+part+v; 9) n+conj+v; 

10) ono+v; 11) int+v; 12) v+part+v; 13)v+part; 14) v+conj+v;  15)pron+part+v. 

Kazakh noun phrase structure: 

1) n+n; 2) n+conj+n; 3) pron+conj+pron; 4) pron+n; 5) adj+conj+adj; 6) adj+n; 7) adj+adv+n;  

8) num+n; 9) v+n; 10) [ ]+n. 

Kazakh adjective phrase structure: 

1) adj+n; 2) adj+v; 3) adj+n+v; 4) pron+adj; 5) adv+adj+n; 6) adj+adj+n; 7) num+adv+n;  
Collocations, like v+adv, n+part+v, pron+adv, v+part+v, v+part, also exist in other phrase except verb 

phrase. These conditions easily cause ambiguity.  

5 Rule-based phrase tagging 

Kazakh language has two characteristics that have to be taken into account: agglutinative morphology 

and rather free word order with explicit case marking. 

The corpus we used in this process has been already segmented. The way we extracted stem and affix 

was briefly mentioned in the paper. In this paper we used the segmented results of early work, as it is 

not the core part of the algorithm. 

Input: word segmentation (extraction stem and affix) and POS tagged corpus (test.xml); 

Output: First: Phrase tagged file; Second: Phrase file; 

Based on the basic rules of phrase, we have done extraction of phrases from POS tagged Kazakh cor-

pus. The extraction process is as follows: 

(a) First roughly segmented XML corpus. The common segmentation marks include semicolon, com-

ma, full stop, exclamation mark, question mark. 

(b) For the segmented data, we extract the three elements of basic phrase: part of speech (POS), affix, 

and the word.

(c) Look for the matched rule in the rule set. If found, save the basic phrase. Otherwise go back step 1. 

According to combination rules of basic Kazakh phrase, basic phrase was extracted from corpus and 

modified by manual work. The correct combination of basic Kazakh phrase was marked. 

6 Analysis of Kazakh phrase structure ambiguity 

Ambiguity computer analysis of language structure has been one of the difficulties problems. This ar-

ticle from the delimitation ambiguity and structural relationship is to study two aspects of phrase struc-

ture ambiguity.  

One of the difficulties in Kazakh phrase research is the phrase disambiguation problem. Ambiguous 

reasons is word POS ambiguity, phrase boundaries is not easy to determine, POS with the same se-

quence, E.g.  there are five  ambiguous forms: 

(1) VD form (v + adv ) 

Eg.1a：   is verb phrase. (Admission to reduce) 

Eg.1b：  is adverb phrase. ( Admission to more than) 
(2) ND for (n+adv, pron+adv) 

Eg.2a：  is verb phrase.( Change a new clothes) 

Eg.2b：  is adverb phrase.( Good record) 
(3) NPV form（ n+part+v,  pron+part+v) 

Eg.3a：  is verb phrase.( Learn about unity) 
Eg.3b：  is noun phrase.( only Ashan) 
(4) VPV form (v+part+v) 

Eg.4a：  is verb phrase.( came then left) 
Eg.4b：  is adverb phrase. (Relevant research to understand) 
(5) VP form (v+part) 

Eg.5a：  is verb phrase.( Speaking before) 

Eg.5b：  is verb phrase.( Organize the relevant) 
For these ambiguities, we can't simply use the rules to match ways to eliminate, but rather to use max-

imum entropy model to solve the problem. 

7 Kazakh Phrase Identification based Maximum Entropy Model 

Maximum Entropy Model is an effective machine learning model which is proposed to solve the POS 

tagging problem, it using ME model is the ability to incorporate various features into the conditional 

probability. The Kazakh phrase recognition task is presented as follow.

Note: X represents the environmental context words to be marked and y is the output. 

Maximum Entropy Model： Such a model can be shown to have the following form:

                                                     (2) 

Goal: select a distribution p from a set of allowed distributions that maximizes H(y|X).   

7.1 Feature defined 

Kazakh language is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational, 

inflectional affixes or suffixes to root words. The features include words, part of speech (POS), inflec-

tional affixes of the training corpus. It seems that the features are naïve. However, these three kinds of 

features are the most important components of Kazakh language, and they reflect the characteristic of 

Kazakh language. 

According to its own characteristics of a Kazakh, this feature space is defined as follows: 

(1) the word, including the current word, the previous word and next word. 

 

 

 

 
1010



 

(2) part of speech(POS), including the part-of-speech types of the current word, previous word and  

next word. 

(3) Affix ingredients, including the current word and the word about the additional ingredient info-

mation. 
(4) Phrase tag that contains the current word and the words to the right and the left two words Phrase 

marker. 

This rule-based approach was applied to generate the maximum entropy model training corpus. Based 

on Kazakh linguistics, the atomic feature space is as shown in table 3.

7.2  Feature selection 

Basic phrases with statistical model recognition need to select a high correlation, and the Kazakh lan-

guage features to train with good effect. Establish model based on rule of the language, this work se-

lected feature through templates. After several rounds of experimental debugging, then used artificial 

selection, twenty one templates were selected for Kazakh verb  phrase, only considered important fea-

tures. According to each one’s feature, templates were defined as follow. 

No. template No. template No. template

                           Table 4.  Combined  feature of Kz Base VP. 

In order to get the best template, this work structured and processed six template based on Table 4.

Each information function valued in the context of current word, combine the various function values 

into the premise of features, got the characteristics of the movement through the word tag, then it can 

extract features. 

Template A: [RRPos, RRVP, RWord, RAffix, RPos, RVP, CPos, CVP, CWord, CAffix, LLPos, 

LLVP, LWord, LAffix, LPos, LVP] Observation of effects of all the words in the feature space on the 

result of the experiment.  

Template B: [CPos, CVP, CWord, CAffix, LLPos, LLVP, LWord, LAffix, LPos, LVP] Observation of 

effects of left side two words of the candidate word on the result of the experiment. 

Template C:[ RRPos，RRVP，RWord，RAffix，RPos，RVP，CPos，CVP，CWord,CAffix] Ob-
servation of effects of right side two words of the candidate word on the result of the experiment. 

Template D:[ RWord，RAffix，RPos，RVP，CPos，CVP，CWord,CAffix， LWord，LAffix，

LPos，LVP] Observation of effects of each side one word of the candidate word on the result of the 
experiment. 

Template E:[ RWord，RAffix，RPos，RVP，CPos，CVP，CWord，CAffix, LLPos，LLVP，

LWord，LAffix，LPos，LVP] Observation of effects of left side two words and right side one word 
of the candidate word on the result of the experiment.  

Template F:[ RRPos，RRVP，RWord，RAffix，RPos，RVP，CPos，CVP，CWord，CAffix，

LWord，LAffix，LPos，LVP] Observation of effects of left side one word and right side two words 
of the candidate word on the result of the experiment. 

We selected some corpus from Xinjiang Daily tested on six features above, we got different influences 

of different characters. It shows that the C and F template give us the most highest result, namely the 

two words on the right have the biggest influence to the result. It proves Kazakh verb phrases are 

commonly at the end of the sentence.  

7.3    General threshold selection 

There are two general feature selection methods: incremental feature selection and feature selection of 

based on frequency threshold. The frequency is greater than a threshold value equal to a characteristic. 

Through repeating them many times, the frequency threshold value was characterized k = 5, character-

ized in that the use of the frequency characteristic is greater than 5.

10 Conclusion 

This paper provided solution for identifying Kazakh basic phrases. We have tried rule-based and the 

maximum entropy methods. The Kazakh words, part of speech, affixes context information are used to 

design template of features for maximum entropy model. Based on statistical methods, higher accura-

cy could be obtained in the test, but it was requires more training data.  

The recognition of basic Kazakh phrase could simplify sentence structure, reduce the difficulty of syn-

tactic analyzer. This work put maximum entropy model into recognition of basic Kazakh phrase. 

However, there are still space for improvement on scale and accuracy rate comparing to English and 

Chinese. In the future, our work will focus on completing of corpus and other models.
