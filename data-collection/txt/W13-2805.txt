Abstract

Dependency parsers are almost ubiqui-
tously evaluated on their accuracy scores,
these scores say nothing of the complex-
ity and usefulness of the resulting struc-
tures. The structures may have more com-
plexity due to their coordination structure
or attachment rules. As dependency parses
are basic structures in which other systems
are built upon, it would seem more reason-
able to judge these parsers down the NLP
pipeline.

We show results from 7 individual parsers,
including dependency and constituent
parsers, and 3 ensemble parsing tech-
niques with their overall effect on a Ma-
chine Translation system, Treex, for En-
glish to Czech translation. We show that
parsers’ UAS scores are more correlated
to the NIST evaluation metric than to the
BLEU Metric, however we see increases
in both metrics.

1 Introduction

Ensemble learning (Dietterich, 2000) has been
used for a variety of machine learning tasks and
recently has been applied to dependency parsing
in various ways and with different levels of suc-
cess. (Surdeanu and Manning, 2010; Haffari
et al., 2011) showed a successful combination of
parse trees through a linear combination of trees
with various weighting formulations. To keep
their tree constraint, they applied Eisner’s algo-
rithm for reparsing (Eisner, 1996).

Parser combination with dependency trees has
been examined in terms of accuracy (Sagae and
Lavie, 2006; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Zeman
and Žabokrtský, 2005; Holan and Žabokrtský,
2006). Other methods of parser combinations
have shown to be successful such as using one

parser to generate features for another parser. This
was shown in (Nivre and McDonald, 2008), in
which Malt Parser was used as a feature to MST
Parser. The result was a successful combination of
a transition-based and graph-based parser, but did
not address adding other types of parsers into the
framework.

We will use three ensemble approaches. First a
fixed weight ensemble approach in which edges
are added together in a weighted graph. Sec-
ond, we added the edges using weights learned
through fuzzy clustering based on POS errors.
Third, we will use a meta-classifier that uses an
SVM to predict the correct model for edge using
only model agreements without any linguistic in-
formation added. Parsing accuracy and machine
translation has been examined in terms of BLEU
score (Quirk and Corston-Oliver, 2006). How-
ever, we believe our work is the first to examine
the NLP pipeline for ensemble parsing for both de-
pendency and constituent parsers as well as exam-
ining both BLEU and NIST scores’ relationship to
their Unlabeled Accuracy Score(UAS).

2 Methodology

2.1 Annotation

To find the maximum effect that dependency pars-
ing can have on the NLP pipeline, we annotated
English dependency trees to form a gold standard.
Annotation was done with two annotators using
a tree editor, Tred (Pajas and Fabian, 2011), on
data that was preprocessed using MST parser. For
the annotation of our gold data, we used the stan-
dard developed by the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) (Hajič, 1998). PDT is annotated on
three levels, morphological, analytical, and tec-
togrammatical. For our gold data we do not touch
the morphological layer, we only correct the ana-
lytical layer (i.e. labeled dependency trees). For
machine translation experiments later in the paper

19



we allow the system to automatically generate a
new tectogrammatical layer based on our new an-
alytical layer annotation. Because the Treex ma-
chine translation system uses a tectogrammatical
layer, when in doubt, ambiguity was left to the tec-
togrammatical (t-layer in Figure 1) to handle.

2.1.1 Data Sets

For the annotation experiments we use data pro-
vided by the 2012 Workshop for Machine Trans-
lation (WMT2012). The data which consists
of 3,003 sentences was automatically tokenized,
tagged, and parsed. This data set was also chosen
since it is disjoint from the usual dependency train-
ing data, allowing researchers to use it as a out-of-
domain testing set. The parser used was an imple-
mentation of MST parser. We then hand corrected
the analytical trees to have a “Gold” standard de-
pendency structure. Analytical trees were anno-
tated on the PDT standard. Most changes involved
coordination construction along with prepositional
phrase attachment. We plan to publicly release this
data and corresponding annotations in the near fu-
ture1.

Having only two annotators has limited us
to evaluating our annotation only through spot
checking and through comparison with other base-
lines. Annotation happened sequentially one after
another. Possible errors were additionally detected
through automatic means. As a comparison we
will evaluate our gold data set versus other parsers
in respect to their performance on previous data
sets, namely the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section
23.

2.2 Translation

2.2.1 Data Sets

All the parsers were trained on sections 02-21 of
the WSJ, except the Stanford parser which also
uses section 01. We retrained MST and Malt
parsers and used pre-trained models for the other
parsers. Machine translation data was used from
WMT 2010, 2011, and 2012. Using our gold
standard we are able to evaluate the effective-
ness of different parser types from graph-base,
transition-based, constituent conversion to ensem-
ble approaches on the 2012 data while finding data
trends using previous years data.

2.2.2 Translation Components
To examine the effects of dependency parsing
down the NLP pipeline, we now turn to syntax
based machine translation. Our dependency mod-
els will be evaluated using the Treex translation
system (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010). This sys-
tem, as opposed to other popular machine transla-
tion systems, makes direct use of the dependency
structure during the conversion from source to tar-
get languages via a tectogrammatical tree transla-
tion approach.

Figure 1: Treex syntax-based translation scenario
(Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010)

We use the different parsers in separate trans-
lation runs each time in the same Treex parsing
block. So each translation scenario only differs in
the parser used and nothing else. As can be seen
in Figure 1, we are directly manipulating the An-
alytical portion of Treex. The parsers used are as
follows:

• MST: Implementation of Ryan McDonald’s
Minimum spanning tree parser (McDonald et
al., 2005)

• MST with chunking: Same implementation
as above but we parse the sentences based on
chunks and not full sentences. For instance
this could mean separating parentheticals or
separating appositions (Popel et al., 2011)

• Malt: Implementation of Nivre’s Malt Parser
trained on the Penn Treebank (Nivre, 2003)

• Malt with chunking: Same implementation
as above but with chunked parsing

• ZPar: Yue Zhang’s statistical parser. We
used the pretrained English model (en-
glish.tar.gz) available on the ZPar website for
all tests (Zhang and Clark, 2011)

• Charniak: A constituent based parser
(ec50spfinal model) in which we transform

20



the results using the Pennconverter (Johans-
son and Nugues, 2007)

• Stanford: Another constituent based
parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) whose
output is converted using Pennconverter as
well (wsjPCFG.ser.gz model)

• Fixed Weight Ensemble: A stacked en-
semble system combining five of the parsers
above (MST, Malt, ZPar, Charniak, Stan-
ford). The weights for each tree are as-
signed based on UAS score found in tun-
ing data, section 22 of the WSJ (Green and
Žabokrtský, 2012)

• Fuzzy Cluster: A stacked ensemble system
as well but weights are determined by a clus-
ter analysis of POS errors found in the same
tuning data as above (Green and Žabokrtský,
2012)

• SVM: An ensemble system in which each in-
dividual edge is picked by a meta classifier
from the same 5 parsers as the other ensemble
systems. The SVM meta classifier is trained
on results from the above tuning data (Green
et al., 2012a; Green et al., 2012b).

2.2.3 Evaluation
For Machine Translation we report two automatic
evaluation scores, BLEU and NIST. We examine
parser accuracy using UAS. This paper compares
a machine translation system integrating 10 differ-
ent parsing systems against each other, using the
below metrics.

The BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)
and NIST(from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology), are automatic scoring mecha-
nisms for machine translation that are quick and
can be reused as benchmarks across machine
translation tasks. BLEU and NIST are calculated
as the geometric mean of n-grams multiplied by a
brevity penalty, comparing a machine translation
and a reference text (Papineni et al., 2002). NIST
is based upon the BLEU n-gram approach how-
ever it is also weighted towards discovering more
“informative” n-grams. The more rare an n-gram
is, the higher the weight for a correct translation of
it will be.

Made a standard in the CoNLL shared tasks
competition, UAS studies the structure of a depen-
dency tree and assesses how often the output has

the correct head and dependency arcs (Buchholz
and Marsi, 2006). We report UAS scores for each
parser on section 23 of the WSJ.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Type of Changes in WMT Annotation

Since our gold annotated data was preprocessed
with MST parser, our baseline system at the time,
we started with a decent baseline and only had
to change 9% of the dependency arcs in the data.
These 9% of changes roughly increase the BLEU
score by 7%.

3.2 Parser Accuracy

As seen in previous Ensemble papers (Farkas and
Bohnet, 2012; Green et al., 2012a; Green et al.,
2012b; Green and Žabokrtský, 2012; Zeman and
Žabokrtský, 2005), parsing accuracy can be im-
proved by combining parsers’ outputs for a variety
of languages. We apply a few of these systems, as
described in Section 2.2.2, to English using mod-
els trained for both dependencies and constituents.

3.2.1 Parsers vs our Gold Standard
On average our gold data differed in head agree-
ment from our base parser 14.77% of the time.
When our base parsers were tested on the WSJ
section 23 data they had an average error rate of
12.17% which is roughly comparable to the differ-
ence with our gold data set which indicates overall
our annotations are close to the accepted standard
from the community. The slight difference in per-
centage fits into what is expect in annotator error
and in the errors in the conversion process of the
WSJ by Pennconverter.

3.3 Parsing Errors Effect on MT

3.3.1 MT Results in WMT with Ensemble
Parsers

WMT 2010
As seen in Table 1, the highest resulting BLEU
score for the 2010 data set is from the fixed weight
ensemble system. The other two ensemble sys-
tems are beaten by one component system, Char-
niak. However, this changes when comparing
NIST scores. Two of the ensemble method have
higher NIST scores than Charniak, similar to their
UAS scores.
WMT 2011
The 2011 data corresponded the best with UAS
scores. While the BLEU score increases for all

21



Parser UAS NIST(10/11/12) BLEU(10/11/12)
MST 86.49 5.40/5.58/5.19 12.99/13.58/11.54

MST w chunking 86.57 5.43/5.63/5.23 13.43/14.00/11.96
Malt 84.51 5.37/5.57/5.14 12.90/13.48/11.27

Malt w chunking 87.01 5.41/5.60/5.19 13.39/13.80/11.73
ZPar 76.06 5.26/5.46/5.08 11.91/12.48/10.53

Charniak 92.08 5.47/5.65/5.28 13.49/13.95/12.26
Stanford 87.88 5.40/5.59/5.18 13.23/13.63/11.74

Fixed Weight 92.58 5.49/5.68/5.29 13.53/14.04/12.23
Fuzzy Cluster 92.54 5.47/5.68/5.26 13.47/14.06/12.06

SVM 92.60 5.48/5.68/5.28 13.45/14.11/12.22

Table 1: Scores for each machine translation run for each dataset (WMT 2010, 2011 and 2012)

the ensemble systems, the order of systems by
UAS scores corresponds exactly to the systems or-
dered by NIST score and corelates strongly (Table
2). Unlike the 2010 data, the MST parser was the
highest base parser in terms of the BLEU metric.
WMT 2012
The ensemble increases are statistically significant
for both the SVM and the Fixed Weight system
over the MST with chunking parser with 99% con-
fidence, our previous baseline and best scoring
base system from 2011 in terms of BLEU score.
We examine our data versus MST with chunking
instead of Charniak since we have preprocessed
our gold data set with MST, allowing us a direct
comparison in improvements. The fuzzy cluster
system achieves a higher BLEU evaluation score
than MST, but is not significant. In pairwise tests
it wins approximately 78% of the time. This is the
first dataset we have looked at where the BLEU
score is higher for a component parser and not an
ensemble system, although the NIST score is still
higher for the ensemble systems.

2010 0.98 0.93
2011 0.98 0.94
2012 0.95 0.97

Table 2: Pearson correlation coefficients for each
year and each metric when measured against UAS.
Statistics are taken from the WMT results in Table
1. Overall NIST has the stronger correlation to
UAS scores, however both NIST and BLEU show
a strong relationship.

3.3.2 Human Manual Evaluation: SVM vs
the Baseline System

We selected 200 sentences at random from our an-
notations and they were given to 7 native Czech
speakers. 77 times the reviewers preferred the
SVM system, 48 times they preferred the MST
system, and 57 times they said there was no differ-
ence between the sentences. On average each re-
viewer looked at 26 sentences with a median of 30
sentences. Reviewers were allowed three options:
sentence 1 is better, sentence 2 is better, both sen-
tences are of equal quality. Sentences were dis-
played in a random order and the systems were
randomly shuffled for each question and for each
user.

+ = -
+ 12 12 0
= 3 7
- 7

Table 3: Agreement for sentences with 2 or more
annotators for our baseline and SVM systems. (-,-)
all annotators agreed the baseline was better, (+,+)
all annotators agreed the SVM system was better,
(+,-) the annotators disagreed with each other

Table 3 indicates that the SVM system was pre-
ferred. When removing annotations marked as
equal, we see that the SVM system was preferred
24 times to the Baseline’s 14.

Although a small sample, this shows that using
the ensemble parser will at worse give you equal
results and at best a much improved result.

3.3.3 MT Results with Gold Data

In the perfect situation of having gold standard de-
pendency trees, we obtained a NIST of 5.30 and
a BLEU of 12.39. For our gold standard system
run, the parsing component was removed and re-
placed with our hand annotated data. These are
the highest NIST and BLEU scores we have ob-
tained including using all base parsers or any com-
binations of parsers. This indicates that while an
old problem which is a “solved” problem for some
languages, Parsing is still worth researching and
improving for its cascading effects down the NLP
pipeline.

4 Conclusion

We have shown that ensemble parsing techniques
have an influence on syntax-based machine trans-
lation both in manual and automatic evaluation.
Furthermore we have shown a stronger correlation
between parser accuracy and the NIST rather than
the more commonly used BLEU metric. We have
also introduced a gold set of English dependency
trees based on the WMT 2012 machine translation
task data, which shows a larger increase in both
BLEU and NIST. While on some datasets it is in-
conclusive whether using an ensemble parser with
better accuracy has a large enough effect, we do
show that practically you will not do worse using
one and in many cases do much better.
