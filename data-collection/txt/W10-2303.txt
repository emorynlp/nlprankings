Abstract 

 

This work extends the study of Germann et al. 

(2010) in investigating the lexical organization 

of verbs. Particularly, we look at the influence 

of frequency on the process of lexical acquis i-

tion and use. We examine data obtained from 

psycholinguistic action naming  tasks per-

formed by children and adults (speakers of 

Brazilian Portuguese), and analyze some cha-

racteristics of the verbs used by each group in 

terms of similarity of content, using Jaccard‟s 

coefficient, and of topology, using graph 

theory. The experiments suggest that younger 

children tend to use more frequent verbs than 

adults to describe events in the world.  

1 Introduction 

The cognitive influence of frequency has been 
proven strong in the learning process of both 
sense and nonsense words (Howes and Solomon, 
1951; Solomon and Postman, 1952). Frequency 
has also been shown to highly correlate with se-
mantic factors, endorsing its importance, through 
the so called “light verbs” (Goldberg, 1999).  

In this study, we investigate whether words 
that are more frequent have a higher chance of 
earlier acquisition. For this purpose, we com-
pare data from children and adults, native speak-
ers of Brazilian Portuguese, on an action naming 
task, looking at lexical evolution, using statistical 
and topological analysis of the data modeled as 
graphs. Our approach innovates in the sense that 
it directly simulates the influence of a linguistic 
factor over the process of lexical evolution.  

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
describes related work. Section 3 presents the 

materials and methods employed. Section 4 
presents the results and section 5 concludes.  

2 Related Work  

Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), use some prop-
erties of language networks to propose a model 
of semantic growth, which is compatible with the 
effects of age of acquisition and frequency, in 
semantic processing tasks. The approach pro-
posed in this paper follows Steyvers and Tenen-
baum in the sense of iterative modifications of 
graphs, but differs in method (we use involutions 
instead of evolutions) and objective: modifica-
tions are motivated by the study of frequency 
instead of production of a topological arrange-
ment. It also follows Deyne and Storms (2008), 
in directly relating linguistic factors and graph 
theory metrics, and Coronges et al. (2007), in 
comparing networks of different populations. 

This study also follows Tonietto et al. (2008) 
in using data from a psycholinguistic action nam-
ing task. However, the analysis is done in terms 
of graph manipulation, instead of pure statistics.  

3 Materials and Methods  

3.1 The Data 

The action naming task was performed by differ-
ent age groups: 55 children and 55 young adults. 
Children‟s data are longitudinal; partic ipants of 
the first data collection (G1) aged between 2;0 
and 3;11 (average 3;1), and in the second collec-
tion (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6 (average 5;5) as 
described by Tonietto et al. (2008). The adult 
group is unrelated to the children, and aged be-
tween 17;0 and 34;0 (average 21;8). Participants 
were shown 17 actions of destruction or division 
(Tonietto et al, 2008) and asked to describe it. 

19



Data processing and justification of the chosen 
domain are described in Germann et al. (2010).  

The answers given by each participant were 
collected and annotated with two frequency 
scores, each calculated from a different source. 
The first, Fscore, is the number of occurrences of 
the verb in the “Florianópolis” corpus (Scliar-
Cabral, 1993; MacWhinney, 2000). The second, 
Yscore, is the number of given results searching 
for the infinitive form of the verb in the “Ya-
hoo!" Searcher (http://br.yahoo.com). In the ad-
vanced settings, “Brazil” was selected as country 
and “Portuguese” as language. Information about 
these two scores for each group is shown in Ta-
ble 1.

All scores but type Yscore, decrease as age in-
creases, which is compatible with the hypothesis 
investigated. 

3.2 Simulation Dynamics 

Linguistic production of each group was ex-
pressed in terms of graphs, whose nodes 
represent the mentioned verbs. All verbs uttered 
for the same video were assumed share semantic 
information, and then linked together, forming a 
(clique) subgraph. The subgraphs were then con-
nected in a merging step, through the words ut-
tered for more than one video.  

To investigate the influence of frequency on 
the language acquisition process, we used it to 
change the network over time. Network involu-
tion, the strategy adopted, works in the opposite 
way than network growth (Albert and Barabási, 
2002). Instead of adding nodes, it takes an older 
group graph as the source and decides on the 
nodes to iteratively remove (taking the younger 
group graph only as a reference for comparison).  

Verbs were ranked in increasing order of fre-
quency. At each step of graph involution, the less 
frequent verb was selected to be removed, and 

                                                 
1 Given the measure magnitude, values of Yscore were pre-
sented without the decimal fraction.  

the resulting graph was measured. Results are 
reported in terms of the averages of 10-fold 
cross-validation (because ties imply in random 
selection).  

Graph theory metrics were used to measure 
structural similarity: average minimal path length 
(L), density (D), average node connectivity (k) 
and average clustering coefficient (C/s)

2
. In the 

involution, k and D, measure semantic share, 
since that is what relations among nodes are sup-
posed to mean (see above). L and C/s are in-
tended to measure vocabulary uniformity, since 
greater distances and lower clusterization are 
related to the presence of subcenters of meaning.  

In order to compare the contents of each graph 
as well, we employed a measure of set similarity: 
Jaccard‟s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901). 
Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard‟s coefficient 
J can be calculated as follows:  

  , 

where “x” is the number of elements in both A 
and B, “y” is the number of elements only in A, 
and “z” is the number of elements only in B.  

4 Simulation Results  

As we remove the verbs with lower frequency 
from the graph of an older group, the overall 
structure should approximate to that of a younger 
group, and both should get more similar concern-
ing content. Therefore, the most relevant part of 
each chart is the begging: the first removed verbs 
are expected to be those that differentiate graphs. 

4.1 Network Involution Topology 

The graph theory metrics are shown in Figures 1 
and 2 in terms of 2 lines: network involution (a) 
by using the selected criterion, and (b) by using 
random selection (10-fold cross validation). In 
addition, each figure also shows the measure for 
the younger group as reference (a dashed, 
straight, thick line). 

In Figure 1, columns represent a graph theory 
metric, and rows represent the use of a different 
score. Each legend refers to all charts. 

The results for the simulations from G2 to G1, 
(Figure 1) show that the four metrics are clearly 
distinct from random elimination from the be-
ginning, indicating that frequency plays a role in 
the process. C/s is particularly distinct from ran-

                                                 
2 We adopted the local clustering coefficient of Watts and 

Strogatz (1998), but as the graphs may become discon-

nected during network modification, this value is further 
divided by the number of disconnected subgraphs.

dom: while the former remains constant almost 
to the end, indicating a highly structured (clus-
tered) graph, the later shows effects of graph par-
titioning. The remaining metrics presented their 
greatest approximations to the reference line be-
fore the middle of the chart, suggesting that the 
initial verbs were actually the ones differentiat-
ing both graphs. These results suggest an initial 
increase in semantic share, as k and D increase, 
and in uniformity, as nodes get closer to one 
another (L) and remain clustered (C/s). In Figure 
2, the same tendencies are maintained, although 
not as clearly as the previous results. The great-
est approximations of k and D happen in the first 
half of the chart, but in a smoother way. C/s still 
behaves steadily, remaining stable during most 
of the simulation. Yscore resembles Fscore (the 
same way as in Figure 1), and was not presented 
due to space restrictions. 

4.2 Network Involution Set Similarity 

In the Jaccard‟s coefficient charts, a rise or stabi-
lization means that “different verbs” (present 
only in the older graph) were eliminated (in-
creasing set similarity), and a descent means that 
“common verbs” (present in both graphs) were 
eliminated instead. 

Charts for “excluded different” and “excluded 
common” verbs (and their random counterparts) 
are presented in percentage. By doing so, it is 
possible to measure the exact evolution of both, 
despite the proportion between them (there are 
much more “common” than “different” verbs). A 
rise in the “Excluded Different” line means that 
sets are getting similar, while stabilization (des-
cents are not possible) means that they are get-
ting different. The opposite applies to the “Ex-
cluded Common” line.  

In the figures, charts are arranged in columns 
(the score being used) and rows (the parameter 
being measured). Each legend is particular to 
each row (one to Jaccard‟s coefficient and anoth-
er to the excluded verbs). 

Both simulation sets (Figures 3 and 4) confirm 
the expected pattern in general: an initial in-
crease in the proportion between "different" and 
“common” verbs. In Figure 3, Yscore presents an 
unexpected descent just before the middle, fol-
lowed by a sharp rise. Since the greatest descent 
happens just in the end, we interpret this middle 
descent as data noise. In Figure 4, Fscore 
presents an almost random result, indicating that 
the score had low impact in content similarity for 
this simulation. Fscore in Figure 3 and Yscore in 
Figure 4 behaved as expected, with most “differ-

5 Conclusions and Future Work 

This study has investigated the influence of fre-
quency on verb acquisition and organization us-
ing both graph and set theory metrics. In general, 
results from the topological analysis showed a 
tendency towards the reference value, and the 
greatest similarities were mostly collected in the 
beginning, pointing for a preference of children 
to use verbs more frequently perceived in the 
language. So we conclude that both the model of 
involution and the given analysis are appropriate 
for linguistic studies concerning vocabulary evo-
lution

3 Since the measures were taken from the whole graph, it is 

not possible to determine a measure of significance. How-
ever, the comparisons with random elimination can be seen 

 For future work, we intend to apply the same 
approach to other parameters, such as concrete-
ness, and syntactic complexity (and combina-
tions, and to investigate lexical dissolution in the 
context of pathologies, such as Alzheimer‟s dis-
ease, and in larger data sets, in order to further 
confirm the results obtained so far.
