Abstract

We present the Carnegie Mellon University
Stat-XFER group submission to the WMT
2011 shared translation task. We built a hy-
brid syntactic MT system for French–English
using the Joshua decoder and an automati-
cally acquired SCFG. New work for this year
includes training data selection and grammar
filtering. Expanded training data selection
significantly increased translation scores and
lowered OOV rates, while results on grammar
filtering were mixed.

1 Introduction

During the past year, the statistical transfer ma-
chine translation group at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity has continued its work on large-scale syntactic
MT systems based on automatically acquired syn-
chronous context-free grammars (SCFGs). For the
2011 Workshop on Machine Translation, we built
a hybrid MT system, including both syntactic and
non-syntactic rules, and submitted it as a constrained
entry to the French–English translation task. This
is our fourth yearly submission to the WMT shared
translation task.

In design and construction, the system is sim-
ilar to our submission from last year’s workshop
(Hanneman et al., 2010), with changes in the meth-
ods we employed for training data selection and
SCFG filtering. Continuing WMT’s general trend,
we worked with more data than in previous years,
basing our 2011 system on 13.9 million sentences
of parallel French–English training data and an En-
glish language model of 1.8 billion words. Decod-

ing was carried out in Joshua (Li et al., 2009), an
open-source framework for parsing-based MT. We
managed our experiments with LoonyBin (Clark and
Lavie, 2010), an open-source tool for defining, mod-
ifying, and running complex experimental pipelines.

We describe our system-building process in more
detail in Section 2. In Section 3, we evaluate the sys-
tem’s performance on WMT development sets and
examine the aftermath of training data selection and
grammar filtering. Section 4 concludes with possi-
ble directions for future work.

2 System Construction

2.1 Training Data Selection

WMT 2011’s provided French–English training data
consisted of 36.8 million sentence pairs from the Eu-
roparl, news commentary, UN documents, and Giga-
FrEn corpora (Table 1). The first three of these are,
for the most part, clean data resources that have been
successfully employed as MT corpora for a number
of years. The Giga-FrEn corpus, though the largest,
is also the least precise, as its Web-crawled data
sources are less homogeneous and less structured
than the other corpora. Nevertheless, Pino et al.
(2010) found significant improvements in French–
English MT output quality by including it. Our goal
for this year was to strike a middle ground: to avoid
computational difficulties in using the entire 36.8
million sentence pairs of training data, but to mine
the Giga-FrEn corpus for sentences to increase our
system’s vocabulary coverage.

Our method of training data selection proceeded
as follows. We first tokenized all the parallel training

data using the Stanford parser’s tokenizer (Klein and
Manning, 2003) for English and our own in-house
script for French. We then passed the Europarl, news
commentary, and UN data through a filtering script
that removed lines longer than 95 tokens in either
language, empty lines, lines with excessively imbal-
anced length ratios, and lines containing tokens of
more than 25 characters in either language. From
the filtered data, we computed a list of the source-
side vocabulary words along with their frequency
counts. Next, we searched the Giga-FrEn corpus for
relatively short lines on the source side (up to 50 to-
kens long) that contained either a new vocabulary
word or a word that had been previously seen fewer
than 20 times. Such lines were added to the filtered
training data to make up our system’s final parallel
training corpus.

The number of sentences retained from each data
source is listed in Table 1; in the end, we trained our
system from 13.9 million parallel sentences. With
the Giga-FrEn data included, the source side of our
parallel corpus had a vocabulary of just over 1.9
million unique words, compared with a coverage of
545,000 words without using Giga-FrEn.

We made the decision to leave the training data in
mixed case for our entire system-building process.
At the cost of slightly sparser estimates for word
alignments and translation probabilities, a mixed-
case system avoids the extra step of building a sta-
tistical recaser to treat our system’s output.

2.2 Grammar Extraction and Scoring

Once we had assembled the final training corpus,
we annotated it with statistical word alignments and
constituent parse trees on both sides. Unidirec-
tional word alignments were provided by MGIZA++
(Gao and Vogel, 2008), then symmetrized with the

grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2005).
For generating parse trees, we used the French and
English grammars of the Berkeley statistical parser
(Petrov and Klein, 2007).

Except for minor bug fixes, our method for ex-
tracting and scoring a translation grammar remains
the same as in our WMT 2010 submission. We ex-
tracted both syntactic and non-syntactic portions of
the translation grammar. The non-syntactic gram-
mar was extracted from the parallel corpus and
word alignments following the standard heuristics
of phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003). The
syntactic grammar was produced using the method
of Lavie et al. (2008), which decomposes each pair
of word-aligned parse trees into a series of minimal
SCFG rules. The word alignments are first gener-
alized to node alignments, where nodes s and t are
aligned between the source and target parse trees if
all word alignments in the yield of s land within
the yield of t and vice versa. Minimal SCFG rules
are derived from adjacent levels of node alignments:
the labels from each pair of aligned nodes forms a
rule’s left-hand side, and the right-hand side is made
up of the labels from the frontier of aligned nodes
encountered when walking the left-hand side’s sub-
trees. Within a phrase length limit, each aligned
node pair generate an all-terminal phrase pair rule
as well.

Since both grammars are extracted from the same
Viterbi word alignments using similar alignment
consistency constraints, the phrase pair rules from
the syntactic grammar make up a subset of the rules
extracted according to phrase-based SMT heuristics.
We thus share instance counts between identical
phrases extracted in both grammars, then delete the
non-syntactic versions. Remaining non-syntactic
phrase pairs are converted to SCFG rules, with the
phrase pair forming the right-hand side and the
dummy label PHR::PHR as the left-hand side. Ex-
cept for the dummy label, all nonterminals in the fi-
nal SCFG are made up of a syntactic category label
from French joined with a syntactic category label
from English, as extracted in the syntactic grammar.
A sampling of extracted SCFG rules is shown in Fig-
ure 1.

The combined grammar was scored according to
the 22 translation model features we used last year.

Figure 1: Sample extracted SCFG rules. They include
non-syntactic phrase pairs, single-word and multi-word
syntactic phrase pairs, partially lexicalized hierarchical
rules, and fully abstract hierarchical rules.

[rs ] :: [rt ], we computed 11 maximum-likelihood
features as follows:

• Phrase translation scores P (rs | rt) and
P (rt | rs) for phrase pair rules, using the larger
non-syntactic instance counts for rules that
were also extracted syntactically.

• Hierarchical translation scores P (rs | rt) and
P (rt | rs) for syntactic rules with nonterminals
on the right-hand side.

• Labeling scores P (ℓs :: ℓt | rs), P (ℓs :: ℓt | rt),
and P (ℓs :: ℓt | rs, rt) for syntactic rules.

• “Not syntactically labelable” scores P (ℓs ::
ℓt = PHR :: PHR | rs) and P (ℓs :: ℓt =
PHR :: PHR | rt), with additive smoothing
(n = 1), for all rules.

• Bidirectional lexical scores for all rules with
lexical items, calculated from a unigram lexi-
con over Viterbi-aligned word pairs as in the
Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007).

We also included the following 10 binary indicator
features using statistics local to each rule:

• Three low-count features that equal 1 when the
extracted frequency of the rule is exactly equal
to 1, 2, or 3.

• A syntactic feature that equals 1 when the rule’s
label is syntactic, and a corresponding non-
syntactic feature that equals 1 when the rule’s
label is PHR::PHR.

• Five rule format features that equal 1 when the
rule’s right-hand side has a certain composi-
tion. If as and at are true when the source and

target sides contain only nonterminals, respec-
tively, our rule format features are equal to as,
at, as ∧ āt, ās ∧ at, and ās ∧ āt.

Finally, our model includes a glue rule indicator fea-
ture that equals 1 when the rule is a generic glue
rule. In the Joshua decoder, glue rules monotoni-
cally stitch together adjacent parsed translation frag-
ments at no model cost.

2.3 Language Modeling

This year, our constrained-track system made use of
part of the English Gigaword data, along with other
provided text, in its target-side language model.
From among the data released directly for WMT
2011, we used the English side of the Europarl,
news commentary, French–English UN document,
and English monolingual news corpora. From the
English Gigaword corpus, we included the entire
Xinhua portion and the most recent 13 million sen-
tences of the AP Wire portion. Some of these cor-
pora contain many lines that are repeated a dispro-
portionate number of times — the monolingual news
corpus in particular, when filtered to only one oc-
currence of each sentence, reaches only 27% of its
original line count. As part of preparing our lan-
guage modeling data, we deduplicated both the En-
glish news and the UN documents, the corpora with
the highest percentages of repeated sentences. We
also removed lines containing more than 750 char-
acters (about 125 average English words) before to-
kenization.

The final prepared corpus was made up of approx-
imately 1.8 billion words of running text. We built
a 5-gram language model from it with the SRI lan-
guage modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). To match
the treatment given to the training data, the language
model was also built in mixed case.

2.4 Grammar Filtering for Decoding

As is to be expected from a training corpus of 13.9
million sentence pairs, the grammars we extract ac-
cording to the procedure of Section 2.2 are quite
large: approximately 2.53 billion non-syntactic and
440 million syntactic rule instances, for a combined
grammar of 1.26 billion unique rules. In preparation
for tuning or decoding, we are faced with the engi-
neering challenge of selecting a subset of the gram-

367



mar that contains useful rules and fits in a reasonable
amount of memory.

Before even extracting a syntactic grammar, we
passed the automatically generated parse trees on the
training corpus through a small tag-correction script
as a pre-step. In previous experimentation, we no-
ticed that a surprising proportion of cardinal num-
bers in English had been tagged with labels other
than CD, their correct tag. We also found errors in
labeling marks of punctuation in both English and
French, when again the canonical labels are unam-
biguous. To fix these errors, we forcibly overwrote
the labels of English tokens made up of only digits
with CD, and we overwrote the labels of 25 English
and 24 French marks of punctuation or other sym-
bols with the appropriate tag as defined by the rele-
vant treebank tagging guidelines.

After grammar extraction and combination of
syntactic and non-syntactic rules, we ran an addi-
tional filtering step to reduce derivational ambiguity
in the case where the same SCFG right-hand side ap-
peared with more than one left-hand-side label. For
each right-hand side, we sorted its possible labels by
extracted frequency, then threw out the labels in the
bottom 10% of the left-hand-side distribution.

Finally, we ran a main grammar filtering step prior
to tuning or decoding, experimenting with two dif-
ferent filtering methods. In both cases, the phrase
pair rules in the grammar were split off and filtered
so that only those whose source sides completely
matched the tuning or test set were retained.

The first, more naive grammar filtering method
sorted all hierarchical rules by extracted frequency,
then retained the most frequent 10,000 rules to join
all matching phrase pair rules in the final translation
grammar. This is similar to the basic grammar filter-
ing we performed for our WMT 2010 submission.
It is based on the rationale that the most frequently
extracted rules in the parallel training data are likely
to be the most reliably estimated and also frequently
used in translating a new data set. However, it also
passes through a disproportionate number of fully
abstract rules — that is, rules whose right-hand sides
are made up entirely of nonterminals — which can
apply more recklessly on the test set because they
are not lexically grounded.

Our second, more advanced method of filtering
made two improvements over the naive approach.

First, it controlled for the imbalance of hierarchi-
cal rules by splitting the grammar’s partially lexical-
ized rules into a separate group that can be filtered
independently. Second, it applied a lexical-match
filter such that a partially lexicalized rule was re-
tained only if all its lexicalized source phrases up
to bigrams matched the intended tuning or testing
set. The final translation grammar in this case was
made up of three parts: all phrase pair rules match-
ing the test set (as before), the 100,000 most fre-
quently extracted partially lexicalized rules whose
bigrams match the test set, and the 2000 most fre-
quently extracted fully abstract rules.

3 Experimental Results and Analysis

We tuned each system variant on the newstest2008
data set, using the Z-MERT package (Zaidan, 2009)
for minimum error-rate training to the BLEU metric.
We ran development tests on the newstest2009 and
newstest2010 data sets; Table 2 reports the results
obtained according to various automatic metrics.
The evaluation consists of case-insensitive scoring
according to METEOR 1.0 (Lavie and Denkowski,
2009) tuned to HTER with the exact, stemming,
and synonymy modules enabled, case-insensitive
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as implemented by
the NIST mteval-v13 script, and case-insensitive
TER 0.7.25 (Snover et al., 2006).

Table 2 gives comparative results for two major
systems: one based on our WMT 2011 data selec-
tion as outlined in Section 2.1, and one based on
the smaller WMT 2010 training data that we used
last year (8.6 million sentence pairs). Each system
was run with the two grammar filtering variants de-
scribed in Section 2.4: the 10,000 most frequently
extracted hierarchical rules of any type (“10k”), and
a combination of the 2000 most frequently extracted
abstract rules and the 100,000 most frequently ex-
tracted partially lexicalized rules that matched the
test set (“2k+100k”). Our primary submission to the
WMT 2011 shared task was the fourth line of Ta-
ble 2 (“WMT 2011 2k+100k”); we also made a con-
strastive submission with the system from the sec-
ond line (“WMT 2010 2k+100k”).

— is beneficial to translation quality, as there is
a clear improvement in metric scores between the
2010 and 2011 systems. Our BLEU score improve-
ments of 1.2 to 1.9 points are statistically significant
according to the paired bootstrap resampling method
(Koehn, 2004) with n = 1000 and p < 0.01. They
are also larger than the 0.7- to 1.1-point gains re-
ported by Pino et al. (2010) when the full Giga-FrEn
was added. The 2011 system also shows a signifi-
cant reduction in the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate
on both test sets: 38% and 47% fewer OOV types,
and 44% and 45% fewer OOV tokens, when com-
pared to the 2010 system.

Differences between grammar filtering tech-
niques, on the other hand, are much less signifi-
cant according to all three metrics. Under paired
bootstrap resampling on the newstest2009 set, the
grammar variants in both the 2010 and 2011 systems
are statistically equivalent according to BLEU score.
On newstest2010, the 2k+100k grammar improves
over the 10k version (p < 0.01) in the 2010 system,
but the situation is reversed in the 2011 system.

We investigated differences in grammar use with
an analysis of rule applications in the two variants
of the 2011 system, the results of which are summa-
rized in Table 3. Though the configuration with the
2k+100k grammar does apply syntactic rules 20%
more frequently than its 10k counterpart, the 10k
system uses overall 53% more unique rules. One
contributing factor to this situation could be that the

fully abtract rule cutoff is set too low compared to
the increase in partially lexicalized rules. The ef-
fect of the 2k+100k filtering is to reduce the number
of abstract rules from 4000 to 2000 while increas-
ing the number of partially lexicalized rules from
6000 to 100,000. However, we find that the 10k
system makes heavy use of some short, meaningful
abstract rules that were excluded from the 2k+100k
system. The 2k+100k grammar, by contrast, in-
cludes a long tail of less frequently used partially
lexicalized grammar rules.

In practice, there is a balance between the use
of syntactic and non-syntactic grammar rules dur-
ing decoding. We highlight an example of how
both types of rules work together in Figure 2, which
shows our primary system’s translation of part of
newstest2009 sentence 2271. The French source
text is given in italics and segmented into phrases.
The SCFG rules used in translation are shown
above each phrase, where numerical superscripts on
the nonterminal labels indicate those constituents’
relative ordering in the original French sentence.
(Monotonic glue rules are not shown.) While non-
syntactic rules can be used for short-distance re-
ordering and fixed phrases, such as téléphones mo-
biles ↔ mobile phones, the model prefers syntac-
tic translations for more complicated patterns, such
as the head–children reversal in appareils musicaux
portables ↔ portable music devices.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

Compared to last year, the two main differences in
our current WMT submission are: (1) a new train-
ing data selection strategy aimed at increasing sys-
tem vocabulary without hugely increasing corpus
size, and (2) a new method of grammar filtering that
emphasizes partially lexicalized rules over fully ab-

stract ones.
Based on the results presented in Section 3, we

feel confident in declaring vocabulary-based filter-
ing of the Giga-FrEn corpus a success. By increas-
ing the size of our parallel corpus by 26%, we more
than tripled the number of unique words appearing
in the source text. In conjunction with supplements
to the Europarl, news commentary, and UN docu-
ment corpora, this improvement led to 44% fewer
OOV tokens at decoding time on two different test
sets, as well as a boost in automatic metric scores
of 0.6 METEOR, 1.2 BLEU, and 1.5 TER points
compared to last year’s system. We expect to em-
ploy similar data selection techniques when building
future systems, especially as the amount of parallel
data available continues to increase.

We did not, however, find significant improve-
ments in translation quality by changing the gram-
mar filtering method. As discussed in Section 3, lim-
iting the grammar to only 2000 fully abstract rules
may not have been enough, since additional abstract
rules applied fairly frequently in test data if they
were available. We plan to experiment with larger
filtering cutoffs in future work. A complementary
solution could be to increase the number of par-
tially lexicalized rules. Although we found mixed
results in their application within our current sys-
tem, the success of Hiero-derived MT systems (Chi-

ang, 2005; Chiang, 2010) shows that high transla-
tion quality can be achieved with rules that are only
partially abstract. A major difference between such
systems and our current implementation is that ours,
at 102,000 rules, has a much smaller grammar.
