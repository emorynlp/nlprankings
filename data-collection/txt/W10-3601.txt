Abstract

Automatic  word  segmentation  errors, 
for  languages  having  a  writing  system 
without word boundaries, negatively af-
fect the performance of language mod-
els.  As a solution, the use of  multiple, 
instead of unique, segmentation has re-
cently  been  proposed.  This  approach 
boosts  N-gram  counts  and  generates 
new  N-grams.  However,  it  also  pro-
duces bad N-grams that  affect the lan-
guage models' performance. In this pa-
per, we study more deeply the contribu-
tion  of  our  multiple  segmentation  ap-
proach  and experiment on an efficient 
solution to minimize the effect of adding 
bad N-grams.

1 Introduction

A language model  is  a  probability assignment 
over  all  possible  word  sequences  in  a  natural 
language. It assigns a relatively large probabili-
ty to meaningful, grammatical, or frequent word 
sequences and a low probability or a zero proba-
bility  to  nonsensical,  ungrammatical  or  rare 
ones.  The statistical  approach used in N-gram 
language modeling requires a large amount of 
text data in order to make an accurate estimation 
of probabilities. These data are not available in 
large  quantities  for  under-resourced  languages 
and the lack of text data has a direct impact on 
the performance of language models. While the 
word is  usually  a  basic  unit  in  statistical  lan-
guage  modeling,  word  identification  is  not  a 
simple  task  even  for  languages  that  separate 
words by a special character (a white space in 
general).  For  unsegmented  languages,  which 

have a writing system without obvious word de-
limiters, the N-grams of words are usually esti-
mated  from  the  text  corpus  segmented  into 
words employing automatic methods. Automat-
ic segmentation of text is not a trivial task and 
introduces errors due to the ambiguities in natu-
ral language and the presence of out of vocabu-
lary words in the text. 

While the lack of text resources has a nega-
tive  impact  on  the  performance  of  language 
models,  the  errors  produced by the  word seg-
mentation make those data even less usable. The 
word N-grams not found in the training corpus 
could be due not only to the errors introduced 
by the automatic segmentation but  also to the 
fact  that  a  sequence  of  characters  could  have 
more than one correct segmentation. 

In  previous  article  (Seng  et  al.,  2009),  we 
have proposed a method to estimate an N-gram 
language  model  from  the  training  corpus  on 
which each sentence is segmented into multiple 
ways instead of a unique segmentation. The ob-
jective of multiple segmentation is to generate 
more N-grams from the training corpus to use in 
language modeling. It was possible to show that 
this  approach  generates  more  N-grams  (com-
pared  to  the  classical  dictionary-based  unique 
segmentation method) that are potentially useful 
and relevant in language modeling. The applica-
tion of multiple segmentation in language mod-
eling  for  Khmer  and  Vietnamese  showed im-
provement in terms of tri-gram hits and recogni-
tion error rate in Automatic Speech Recognition 
(ASR) systems. 

This work is a continuation of our previous 
work on the use of multiple segmentation. It is 
conducted on Vietnamese only. A close analysis 
of N-gram counts shows that the approach has 
in fact two contributions: boosting the N-gram 

1



counts that are generated with first best segmen-
tation  and  generating  new N-grams.  We have 
also identified that there are N-grams that nega-
tively  affect  the  performance  of  the  language 
models. In this paper, we study the contribution 
of boosting N-gram counts and  of new N-grams 
to the performance of the language models and 
consequently  to  the  recognition  performance. 
We also present experiments where rare or bad 
N-grams are cut off in order to minimize their 
negative effect on the performance of the lan-
guage models.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 
presents the theoretical background of our mul-
tiple  segmentation  approach;  in  section  3  we 
point out the set up of our experiment; in sec-
tion 4 we present the results of our detailed sta-
tistical analysis of N-grams generated by multi-
ple  segmentation  systems.  Section  5  presents 
the  evaluation  results  of  our  language  models 
for  ASR  and  finally,  we  give  concluding  re-
marks.

2 Multiple Text Segmentation

Text segmentation is a fundamental task in nat-
ural language processing (NLP). Many NLP ap-
plications require the input text segmented into 
words before making further progress because 
the word is considered the basic semantic unit in 
natural  languages.  For unsegmented languages 
segmenting text into words is not a trivial task. 
Because of ambiguities in human languages, a 
sequence  of  characters  may  be  segmented  in 
more than one way to  produce a  sequence of 
valid words.  This is due to the fact  that there 
are different segmentation conventions and the 
definition of  word in a language is  often am-
biguous. 

Text  segmentation  techniques  generally  use 
an  algorithm  which  searches  in  the  text  the 
words corresponding to those in a dictionary. In 
case of ambiguity, the algorithm selects the one 
that  optimizes  a  parameter  dependent  on  the 
chosen  strategy.  The  most  common optimiza-
tion strategies consist of maximizing the length 
of  words  (“longest  matching”)  or  minimizing 
the  number  of  words  in  the  entire  sentence 
(“maximum matching”). These techniques rely 
heavily on the availability and the quality of the 
dictionaries and while it is possible to automati-
cally generate a dictionary from an unsegment-

ed text corpus using unsupervised methods, dic-
tionaries are often created manually. The state-
of-the-art methods generally use a combination 
of hand-crafted, dictionary and statistical tech-
niques to obtain a better result. However, statis-
tical  methods  need  a  large  corpus  segmented 
manually  beforehand.  Statistical  methods  and 
complex training methods are not appropriate in 
the context of under-resourced languages as the 
resources  needed to  implement  these  methods 
do not exist. For an under-resourced language, 
we seek segmentation methods that allow better 
exploitation of the limited resources. In our pre-
vious paper (Seng et al., 2009) we have indicat-
ed the  problems of  existing text  segmentation 
approaches  and  introduced  a  weighted  finite 
state  transducer  (WFST)  based  multiple  text 
segmentation algorithm.

Our approach is implemented using the AT & 
T FSM Toolkit (Mohri et al., 1998). The algo-
rithm is inspired with the work on the segmen-
tation of Arabic words (Lee et al., 2003).  The 
multiple segmentation of a sequence of charac-
ters is made using the composition of three con-
trollers.  Given  a  finite  list  of  words  we  can 
build a finite state transducer M (or word trans-
ducer) that, once composed with an acceptor I 
of the input string that represent a single charac-
ter  with  each  arc,  generates  a  lattice  of  the 
words that represent all of the possible segmen-
tations. To handle out-of-vocabulary entries, we 
make a model of any string of characters by a 
star closure operation over all the possible char-
acters.  Thus,  the  unknown  word  WFST  can 
parse any sequence of characters and generate a 
unique  unk word symbol. The word transducer 
can,  therefore,  be  described  in  terms  of  the 
WFST  operations  as  M  =  (WD   UNK)+∪  
where WD is a WFST that represents the dictio-
nary  and  UNK  represents  the  unknown  word 
WFST. Here,  and + are the union and Kleene∪  
“+” closure operations. A language model L is 
used to score the lattice of all possible segmen-
tations obtained by the composition of our word 
transducer M and the input string I. A language 
model  of  any  order  can  be  represented  by  a 
WFST. In our case, it is important to note that 
only a simple uni-gram language model is used. 
The uni-gram model is estimated from a small 
training  corpus  segmented  automatically  into 
words  using  a  dictionary  based  method.  The 
composition  of  the  sequence  of  input  string  I 

2



with the word transducer M yields a transducer 
that represents all possible segmentations. This 
transducer is then composed with the language 
model  L,  resulting  in  a  transducer  that  repre-
sents  all  possible  segmentations  for  the  input 
string  I,  scored  according  to  L.  The  highest 
scoring paths of the compound transducer is the 
segmentation m that can be defined as:

P m =maxP mk   
The segmentation procedure can then be ex-

pressed formally as:
 m=bestpath  I◦M◦L 
where ◦ is the composition operator. The N-

best segmentations are obtained by decoding the 
final lattice to output the N-best highest scoring 
paths and will be used for the N-gram count.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Language Modeling

First,  it  is  important  to  note  that  Vietnamese 
texts are naturally segmented into syllables (not 
words). Each  syllable  tends  to  have  its  own 
meaning and thus  a  strong identity.  However, 
the  Vietnamese  monosyllable  is  not  automati-
cally a word as we would define a word in Eng-
lish. Often, two syllables go together to form a 
single word, which can be identified by the way 
it  functions  grammatically  in  a  sentence.  To 
have a word-based language model, word seg-
mentation would, therefore, be a must in Viet-
namese.

A Vietnamese training corpus that contains 3 
millions sentences from broadcast news domain 
has been used in this experiment. A Vietnamese 
dictionary of 30k words has been used both for 
the  segmentation  and  counting  the  N-grams. 
Therefore, in the experiments, the ASR vocabu-
lary always remains the same and only the lan-
guage model is changing. The segmentation of 
the  corpus  with  dictionary  based,  “longest 
matching” unique segmentation method gives a 
corpus  of  46  millions  words.  A  development 
corpus of 1000 sentences, which has been seg-
mented automatically to obtain 44k words, has 
been used to evaluate the tri-gram hits and the 
perplexity.  The performance of  each language 
model  produced will  be evaluated in  terms of 
the tri-gram hits and perplexity on the develop-
ment corpus and in terms of ASR performance 

on a separate speech test set (different from the 
development set).

First of all, a language model named lm_1 is 
trained using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke 2002) 
from  the  first  best  segmentation  (Segmul1), 
which has the highest scoring paths (based on 
the transducer explained in section 2) of  each 
sentence in the whole corpus. Then,  additional 
language  models  have  been  trained  using  the 
corpus  segmented  with  N-best  segmentation: 
the number of N-best segmentations to generate 
for each sentence is fixed to 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 
and 1000. The resulting texts are named accord-
ingly  as  Segmul2,  Segmul5,  Segmul10,  Seg-
mul50,  Segmul100,  Segmul1000.  Using  these 
as  training  data,  we  have  developed  different 
language models. Note that a tri-gram that ap-
pears several times in multiple segmentations of 
a single sentence has a count set to one. 

3.2 ASR System

Our automatic speech recognition systems use 
the CMU’s Sphinx3 decoder. The decoder uses 
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with continu-
ous  output  probability  density  functions.  The 
model topology is a 3-state, left-to-right HMM 
with 16 Gaussian mixtures per state.  The pre-
processing of the system consists of extracting a 
39 dimensional  features vector  of  13 MFCCs, 
the  first  and  second  derivatives.  The  CMU’s 
SphinxTrain has been used to train the acoustic 
models used in our experiment. 

The  Vietnamese  acoustic  modeling  training 
corpus is  made up of  14 hours  of  transcribed 
read  speech.  More  details  on  the  automatic 
speech recognition system for Vietnamese lan-
guage can be found in (Le et al., 2008). While 
the evaluation metric WER (Word Error Rate) 
is  generally used to evaluate and compare the 
performance  of  the  ASR  systems,  this  metric 
does not fit well for unsegmented languages be-
cause the errors introduced during the segmen-
tation of the references and the output hypothe-
sis may prevent a fair comparison of different 
ASR system outputs.  We,  therefore,  used  the 
Syllable Error Rate (SER) as Vietnamese text is 
composed  of  syllables  naturally  separated  by 
white space. The automatic speech recognition 
is  done  on  a  test  corpus  of  270  utterances 
(broadcast news domain).

4 Statistical  Analysis  of  N-grams  in 
Multiple Text Segmentation

The  change  in  the  N-gram  count  that  results 
from  multiple  segmentation  is  two  fold:  first 
there is a boosting of the counts of the N-grams 
that  are  already found with the first  best  seg-
mentation,  and  secondly  new  N-grams  are 
added.  As  we have made a  closed-vocabulary 
counting, there are no new uni-grams resulting 
from  multiple segmentation. For the counting, 
the SRILM toolkit  (Stolcke 2002) is used set-
ting the -gtnmin option to zero so that all the N-
gram counts can be considered.

Figure  1  shows  the  distribution  of  tri-gram 
counts for the unique and multiple segmentation 
of the training corpus.  It  can be seen that  the 
majority  of  the  tri-grams  have  counts  in  the 
range of one to three.

Figure 1: Distribution of tri-gram counts
The boosting (the counts of the tri-grams that 

are already found with the first best segmenta-
tion) effect of the multiple segmentation is indi-
cated in table 1. We can see from the table that 
Segmul2, for example, reduced the  number of 
rare tri-grams (count range 1-3) from 19.04 to 
16.15  million.  Consequently,  the  ratio  of  rare 
tri-grams to all tri-grams that are in Segmul1 is 
reduced  from 94% (19.04/20.31*100)  of  Seg-
mul1  only  to  79%  (15.96/20.31*100)  by  the 
boosting effect of Segmul1000, which increased 

the number of tri-grams with count range of 4-9 
from 0.91M to 3.34M. This implies, in the con-
text of under-resourced languages, that multiple 
segmentation  is  boosting  the  N-gram  counts. 
However, one still has to verify if this boosting 
is relevant or not for ASR.

Table 1. boosting tri-gram counts 

We have also analyzed the statistical behav-
ior of the newly added tri-grams with regard to 
their count distribution (see figure 2). As we can 
see from the figure, the distribution of the new 
tri-grams is somehow similar to the distribution 
of the whole tri-grams that is indicated in figure 
1. 

As  shown  in  table  2,  the  total  number  of 
newly  added  tri-grams  is  around  15  millions. 
We can see from the table that the rate of new 
tri-gram contribution of each segmentation in-
creases as N increases in the N-best segmenta-
tion. However, as it is indicated in figure 2, the 
major  contribution  is  in  the  area  of  rare  tri-
grams.

5 Experimental Results

In this section we present the various language 
models  we  have  developed  and  their  perfor-
mance in terms of perplexity, tri-gram hits and 
ASR performance (syllable error rate).

We use the results obtained with the method 
presented in (Seng et al., 2009) as baseline. This 
method  consists  in  re-estimating  the  N-gram 
counts  using the  multiple  segmentation of  the 
training data and add one to the count of a tri-
gram that appears several times in multiple seg-
mentations of a single sentence. These baseline 
results  are  presented  in  Table  3. The  results 
show an increase of the tri-gram coverage and 
slight improvements of the ASR performance.

5.1 Separate  effect  of  boosting  tri-gram 
counts

To see  the  effect  of  boosting  tri-gram counts 
only,  we  have  updated  the  counts  of  the  tri-
grams  obtained  from  the  1-best  segmentation 
(baseline  approach)  by  the  tri-gram counts  of 
different  multiple  segmentations.  Note  that  no 
new tri-grams are added here, and we evaluate 
only the effect  and,  therefore,  the tri-gram hit 
remains the same as that of lm_1.

We have then developed different  language 
models using the uni-gram and bi-gram counts 
of  the first  best  segmentation and the updated 
trigram counts after multiple segmentation. The 
performance of the language models have been 

evaluated in terms of perplexity and their contri-
bution  to  the  performance  improvement  of  a 
speech recognition system.  We have observed 
(detailed  results  are  not  reported  here)  that 
boosting only the tri-gram counts has not con-
tributed any improvement in the performance of 
the  language  models.  The  reason  is  probably 
due  to  the  fact  that  simply  updating  tri-gram 
counts without updating the uni-grams and the 
bi-grams lead to a biased and inefficient LM.

5.2 Separate effect of new tri-grams

To  explore  the  contributions  of  only  newly 
added tri-grams, we have added their counts to 
the N-gram counts of Segmul1. It is important 
to note that the model obtained in that case is 
different from the baseline model whose results 
are presented in Table 3 (the counts of the tri-
grams already found in the unique segmentation 
are different between models). As it is presented 
in table 4, including only the newly added tri-
grams  consistently  improved  tri-gram  hits, 
while the improvement in perplexity stopped at 
Segmul10. Moreover, the use of only new tri-
grams do not reduce the speech recognition er-
ror rate.

5.3 Pooling unique and multiple segmenta-
tion models

We have developed language models by pooling 
unique and multiple segmentation models alto-
gether.  For  instance,  all  the  N-grams of  lm_5 
multiple  segmentation  are  pooled  with  all  N-
grams of lm_1 unique segmentation before esti-
mating the language model probabilities. In oth-
er  words,  ngram-count  command is  used with 
multiple count files. The results are presented in 
table 5.

As it can be noted from table 5, we have got a 
significant  improvement  in  all  the  evaluation 
criteria  as  compared  with  the  performance  of 
lm_1 that has perplexity of 126.6, tri-gram hit 

5



of 46.91% and SER of 27. The best result ob-
tained (25.4) shows a 0.8 absolute SER reduc-
tion  compared  to  the  best  result  presented  in 
(Seng et al., 2009).

5.4 Cutting off rare tri-grams

With  the  assumption  that  bad  N-grams  occur 
rarely, we cut off rare tri-grams from the counts 
in developing language models. We consider all 
tri-grams with a count of 1 to be rare. Our hope, 
here, is that using this cut off we will remove 
bad  N-grams  introduced  by  the  multiple  seg-
mentation approach, while keeping correct new 
N-grams in the model. Table 6 shows the per-
formance  of  the  language  models  developed 
with or without tri-gram cut off for the baseline 
method (the results presented on the lines indi-
cating All3gs are the same as the ones presented 
in Table 3) .

Table 6. Performance with cut off.

The result shows that cutting off reduced the 
number of tri-grams highly (4 tri-grams over 5 
are removed in that case). It, therefore, reduces 
the  size  of  the  language  models  significantly. 
Although  the  results  obtained  are  not  conclu-
sive, a reduction of  recognition error rate has 

been  observed  in  four  out  of  the  seven  cases 
while the perplexity increased and the tri-gram 
hits decreased in all cases. 

5.5 Hybrid  of  pooling  and  cutting  off 
methods

As it has been already indicated, cutting off in-
creased the perplexity of  the language models 
and decreased the tri-gram hits. To reduce the 
negative  effect  of  cutting  off  on  tri-gram hits 
and  perplexity,  we  have  developed  language 
models using both pooling and cut off methods. 
We then cut off tri-grams of count 1 from the 
pooled N-grams. The result, as presented in ta-
ble 7, shows that we can gain significant reduc-
tion in recognition error rate and  improvement 
in tri-gram hits as compared to lm_1 that is de-
veloped with cut off, even if no improvement in 
perplexity is observed. 

The best  result  obtained (25.9) shows a 0.3 
absolute  SER reduction  compared  to  the  best 
system presented in (Seng et al., 2009).

6 Conclusion

The  two  major  contributions  of  multiple  seg-
mentation are generation of new N-grams and 
boosting N-gram counts of those found in first 
best  segmentation.  However,  it  also  produces 
bad N-grams that affect the performance of lan-
guage models. In this paper, we studied the con-
tribution  of  multiple  segmentation  approach 
more deeply and conducted experiments on effi-
cient solutions to minimize the effect of adding 
bad N-grams. Since only boosting the tri-gram 
counts  of  first  best  segmentation  and  adding 
only new tri-grams did not  reduce recognition 
error  rate,  we  have  proposed  to  pool  all  N-
grams of N-best  segmentations to that  of  first 
best  segmentation  and  got  a  significant  im-
provement in perplexity and tri-gram hits from

which we obtained the maximum (0.8 absolute) 
reduction in recognition error rate. 

To   minimize  the  effect  of  adding  bad  N-
grams,  we  have  cut  off  rare  tri-grams in  lan-
guage modeling and got  reduction in  recogni-
tion error rate. The significant reduction of tri-
grams that  resulted  from the  cut  off  revealed 
that the majority of tri-grams generated by mul-
tiple  segmentation  have  counts  1.  Cutting  off 
such a big portion of the trigrams reduced tri-
gram hits and as a solution, we  proposed a hy-
brid of both pooling  and cutting off tri-grams 
from which we obtained a significant reduction 
in recognition error rate. 

It  is  possible  to  conclude  that  our  methods 
make the multiple segmentation approach more 
useful by minimizing the effect of bad N-grams 
that it generates and utilizing the contribution of 
different multiple segmentations. 

However,  we  still  see  rooms  for  improve-
ment.  A systematic selection of new tri-grams 
(for example, based on the probabilities of the 
N-grams and/or application of simple linguistic 
criteria  to  evaluate  the  usefulness  of  new tri-
grams), with the aim of reducing bad tri-grams, 
might lead to performance improvement. Thus, 
we will do experiments in this line. We will also 
apply these methods to other languages, such as 
Khmer.
