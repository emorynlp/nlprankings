Abstract

Although parsing performances have greatly
improved in the last years, grammar inference
from treebanks for morphologically rich lan-
guages, especially from small treebanks, is
still a challenging task. In this paper we in-
vestigate how state-of-the-art parsing perfor-
mances can be achieved on Spanish, a lan-
guage with a rich verbal morphology, with a
non-lexicalized parser trained on a treebank
containing only around 2,800 trees. We rely
on accurate part-of-speech tagging and data-
driven lemmatization to provide parsing mod-
els able to cope lexical data sparseness. Pro-
viding state-of-the-art results on Spanish, our
methodology is applicable to other languages
with high level of inflection.

1 Introduction

Grammar inference from treebanks has become the
standard way to acquire rules and weights for pars-
ing devices. Although tremendous progress has
been achieved in this domain, exploiting small tree-
banks is still a challenging task, especially for lan-
guages with a rich morphology. The main difficulty
is to make good generalizations from small exam-
ple sets exhibiting data sparseness. This difficulty
is even greater when the inference process relies
on semi-supervised or unsupervised learning tech-
niques which are known to require more training ex-
amples, as these examples do not explicitly contain
all the information.

In this paper we want to explore how we can cope
with this difficulty and get state-of-the-art syntac-
tic analyses with a non-lexicalized parser that uses
modern semisupervised inference techniques. We
rely on accurate data-driven lemmatization and part-
of-speech tagging to reduce data sparseness and ease

the burden on the parser. We try to see how we
can improve parsing structure predictions solely by
modifying the terminals and/or the preterminals of
the trees. We keep the rest of the tagset as is.
In order to validate our method, we perform ex-
periments on the Cast3LB constituent treebank for
Spanish (Castillan). This corpus is quite small,
around 3,500 trees, and Spanish is known to have
a rich verbal morphology, making the tag set quite
complex and difficult to predict. Cowan and Collins
(2005) and Chrupała (2008) already showed inter-
esting results on this corpus that will provide us with
a comparison for this work, especially on the lexical
aspects as they used lexicalized frameworks while
we choose PCFG-LAs.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2
we describe the Cast3LB corpus in details. In Sec-
tion 3 we present our experimental setup and results
which we discuss and compare in Section 4. Finally,
Section 5 concludes the presentation.

2 Data Set

The Castillan 3LB treebank (Civit and Martì, 2004)
contains 3,509 constituent trees with functional an-
notations. It is divided in training (2,806 trees), de-
velopment (365 trees) and test (338 trees).

We applied the transformations of Chrupała
(2008) to the corpus where CP and SBAR nodes
are added to the subordinate and relative clauses but
we did not perform any other transformations, like
the coordination modification applied by Cowan and
Collins (2005).

The Cast3LB tag set is rich. In particular part-of-
speech (POS) tags are fine-grained and encode pre-
cise morphological information while non-terminal
tags describe subcategorization and function labels.

55



Without taking functions into account, there are 43
non-terminal tags. The total tag set thus comprises
149 symbols which makes the labeling task chal-
lenging.

The rich morphology of Spanish can be observed
in the treebank through word form variation. Table 1
shows some figures extracted from the corpus (train-
ing, development and test). In particular the word
form/lemma ratio is 1.54, which is similar to other
Romance language treebanks (French FTB and Ital-
ian ITB).

# of tokens 94 907
# of unique word forms 17 979
# of unique lemmas 11 642
ratio word form/lemma 1.54

Table 1: C3LB properties

Thus, we are confronted with a small treebank
with a rich tagset and a high word diversity. All
these conditions make the corpus a case in point for
building a parsing architecture for morphologically-
rich languages.

3 Experiments

We conducted experiments on the Cast3LB develop-
ment set in order to test various treebank modifica-
tions, that can be divided in two categories: (i) mod-
ification of the preterminal symbols of the treebank
by using simplified POS tagsets; (ii) modification of
the terminal symbols of the treebank by replacing
word tokens by lemmas.

3.1 Experimental Setup

In this section we describe the parsing formalism
and POS tagging settings used in our experiments.

PCFG-LAs To test our hypothesis, we use the
grammatical formalism of Probabilistic Context-
Free Grammars with Latent Annotations (PCFG-
LAs) (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).
These grammars depart from the standard PCFGs by
automatically refining grammatical symbols during
the training phase, using unsupervised techniques.
They have been applied successfully to a wide range
of languages, among which French (Candito and
Seddah, 2010), German (Petrov and Klein, 2008),
Chinese and Italian (Lavelli and Corazza, 2009).

For our experiments, we used the LORG PCFG-
LA parser implementing the CKY algorithm. This
software also implements the techniques from Attia
et al. (2010) for handling out-of-vocabulary words,
where interesting suffixes for part-of-speech tagging
are collected on the training set, ranked according
to their information gain with regards to the part-
of-speech tagging task. Hence, all the experiments
are presented in two settings. In the first one, called
generic, unknown words are replaced with a dummy
token UNK, while in the second one, dubbed IG, we
use the collected suffixes and typographical infor-
mation to type unknown words.1 We retained the 30
best suffixes of length 1, 2 and 3.

The grammar was trained using the algorithm
of Petrov and Klein (2007) using 3 rounds of
split/merge/smooth2 . For lexical rules, we applied
the strategy dubbed simple lexicon in the Berkeley
parser. Rare words – words occurring less than 3
times in the training set – are replaced by a special
token, which depends on the OOV handling method
(generic or IG), before collecting counts.

POS tagging We performed parsing experiments
with three different settings regarding POS infor-
mation provided as an input to the parser: (i) with
no POS information, which constitutes our base-
line; (ii) with gold POS information, which can be
considered as a topline for a given parser setting;
(iii) with POS information predicted using the MElt
POS-tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009), using three
different tagsets that we describe below.

MElt is a state-of-the-art sequence labeller that
is trained on both an annotated corpus and an ex-
ternal lexicon. The standard version of MElt relies
on Maximum-Entropy Markov models (MEMMs).
However, in this work, we have used a multiclass
perceptron instead, as it allows for much faster train-
ing with very small performance drops (see Table 2).
For training purposes, we used the training section
of the Cast3LB (76,931 tokens) and the Leffe lexi-
con (Molinero et al., 2009), which contains almost
800,000 distinct (form, category) pairs.3

We performed experiments using three different

vide results obtained with the standard MElt algorithm
(MEMM) as well as with the multiclass perceptron, used
in this paper, for which training is two orders of magni-
tude faster. Unknown words represent as high as 13.5 %
of all words.

tagsets: (i) a baseline tagset which is identical
to the tagset used by Cowan and Collins (2005)
and Chrupała (2008); with this tagset, the training
corpus contains 106 distinct tags;
(ii) the reduced2 tagset, which is a simplification
of the baseline tagset: we only retain the first two
characters of each tag from the baseline tagset; with
this tagset, the training corpus contains 42 distinct
tags;
(iii) the reduced3 tagset, which is a variant of
the reduced2 tagset: contrarily to the reduced2
tagset, the reduced3 tagset has retained the mood
information for verb forms, as it proved relevant
for improving parsing performances as shown by
(Cowan and Collins, 2005); with this tagset, the
training corpus contains 57 distinct tags.

Melt POS tagging accuracy on the Cast3LB de-
velopment set for these three tagsets is given in Ta-
ble 2, with overall figures together with figures com-
puted solely on unknown words (words not attested
in the training corpus, i.e., as high as 13.5 % of all
tokens).

3.2 Baseline

The first set of experiments was conducted with the
baseline POS tagset. Results are summarized in Ta-
ble 3. This table presents parsing statistics on the
Cast3LB development set in the 3 POS settings in-

nal lexicon as constraints, but as features. Therefore, the set of
categories in the external lexicon need not be identical to the
tagset. In this work, the Leffe categories we used include some
morphological information (84 distinct categories).

troduced above (i) no POS provided, (ii) gold POS
provided and (iii) predicted POS provided. For each
POS tagging setting it shows labeled precision, la-
beled recall, labeled F1-score, the percentage of ex-
act match and the POS tagging accuracy. The latter
needs not be the same as presented in Section 3.1 be-
cause (i) punctuation is ignored and (ii) if the parser
cannot use the information provided by the tagger,
it is discarded and the parser performs POS-tagging
on its own.

As already mentioned above, this tagset contains
106 distinct tags. On the one hand it means that POS
tags contain useful information. On the other hand it
also means that the data is already sparse and adding
more sparseness with the IG suffixes and typograph-
ical information is detrimental. This is a major dif-
ference between this POS tagset and the two follow-
ing ones.

3.3 Using simplified tagsets

We now turn to the modified tagsets and measure
their impact on the quality of the syntactic analyses.
Results are summarized in Table 4 for the reduced2
tagset and in Table 5 for reduced3. In these two set-
tings, we can make the following remarks.

• Parsing results are better with reduced3, which
indicates that verbal mood is an important fea-
ture for correctly categorizing verbs at the syn-
tactic level.

• When POS tags are not provided, using suffixes
and typographical information improves OOV
word categorization and leads to a better tag-
ging accuracy and F1 parsing score (78.94 vs.
81.81 for reduced2 and 79.69 vs. 82.44 for re-
duced3).

57



• When providing the parser with POS tags,
whether gold or predicted, both settings show
an interesting difference w.r.t. to unknown
words handling. When using reduced2, the IG
setting is better than the generic one, whereas
the situation is reversed in reduced3. This indi-
cates that reduced2 is too coarse to help finely
categorizing unknown words and that the re-
finement brought by IG is beneficial, however
the added sparseness. For reduced3 it is diffi-
cult to say whether it is the added richness of
the POS tagset or the induced OOV sparseness
that explains why IG is detrimental.

3.4 Lemmatization Impact

Being a morphologically rich language, Spanish ex-
hibits a high level of inflection similar to several
other Romance languages, for example French and
Italian (gender, number, verbal mood). Furthermore,
Spanish belongs to the pro-drop family and clitic
pronouns are often affixed to the verb and carry
functional marks. This makes any small treebank

of this language an interesting play field for statis-
tical parsing. In this experiment, we want to use
lemmatization as a form of morphological cluster-
ing. To cope with the loss of information, we pro-
vide the parser with predicted POS. Lemmatization
is carried out by the morphological analyzer MOR-
FETTE, (Chrupała et al., 2008) while POS tagging
is done by the MElt tagger. Lemmatization perfor-
mances are on a par with previously reported results
on Romance languages (see Table 6)

reduced2 98.37 98.88 95.18
reduced3 98.24 98.88 94.23

Table 6: Lemmatization performance on the Cast3LB.

To make the parser less sensitive to lemmatization
and tagging errors, we train both tools on a 20 jack-
kniffed setup4. Resulting lemmas and POS tags are
then reinjected into the train set. The test corpora
is itself processed with tools trained on the unmod-
ified treebank. Results are presented Table 7. They
show an overall small gain, compared to the previ-
ous experiments but provide a clear improvement on
the richest tagset, which is the most difficult to parse
given its size (106 tags).

First, we remark that POS tagging accuracy with
the baseline tagset when no POS is provided is lower
than previously observed. This can be easily ex-
plained: it is more difficult to predict POS with mor-
phological information when morphological infor-
mation is withdrawn from input.

Second, and as witnessed before, reduction of the
POS tag sparseness using a simplified tagset and in-
crease of the lexical sparseness by handling OOV
words using typographical information have adverse
effects. This can be observed in the generic Pre-
dicted POS section of Table 7 where the baseline
tagset is the best option. On the other hand, in IG
Predicted POS, using the reduced3 is better than
baseline and reduced2. Again this tagset is a trade-
off between rich information and data sparseness.

4The training set is split in 20 chunks and each one is pro-
cessed with a tool trained on the 19 other chunks. This enables
the parser to be less sensitive to lemmatization and/or pos tag-
ging errors.

Table 7: Lemmmatization Experiments

In all cases reduced2 is below the other tagsets
wrt. to Parseval F1 although tagging accuracy is bet-
ter. We can conclude that it is too poor from an in-
formational point of view.

4 Discussion

There is relatively few works actively pursued on
statistical constituency parsing for Spanish. The ini-
tial work of Cowan and Collins (2005) consisted
in a thorough study of the impact of various mor-
phological features on a lexicalized parsing model
(the Collins Model 1) and on the performance gain
brought by the reranker of Collins and Koo (2005)
used in conjunction with the feature set developed
for English. Direct comparison is difficult as they
used a different test set (approximately, the concate-
nation of our development and test sets). They report
an F-score of 85.1 on sentences of length less than
40.5

However, we are directly comparable with Chru-
pała (2008)6 who adapted the Collins Model 2 to
Spanish. As he was focusing on wide coverage LFG
grammar induction, he enriched the non terminal an-
notation scheme with functional paths rather than
trying to obtain the optimal tagset with respect to
pure parsing performance. Nevertheless, using the

work.

parable.

same split and providing gold POS, our system pro-
vides better performance (around 2.3 points better,
see Table 8).

It is of course not surprising for a PCFG-LA
model to outperform a Collins’ model based lexi-
calized parser. However, it is a fact that, on such
small treebank configurations, PCFG-LA are cru-
cially lacking annotated data. It is only by greatly
reducing the POS tagset and using either a state-of-
the-art tagger or a lemmatizer (or both), that we can
boost our system performance.
The sensitivity of PCFG-LA models to lexical data
sparseness was also shown on French by Seddah
et al. (2009). In fact they showed that perfor-
mance of state-of-the-art lexicalized parsers (Char-
niak, Collins models, etc.) were crossing that
of Berkeley parsers when the training set contains
around 2500–3000 sentences. Here, with around
2,800 sentences of training data, we are probably
in a setting where both parser types exhibit simi-
lar performances, as we suspect French and Spanish
to behave in the same way. It is therefore encour-
aging to notice that our approach, which relies on
accurate POS tagging and lemmatization, provides
state-of-the-art performance. Let us add that a simi-
lar method, involving only MORFETTE, was applied
with success to Italian within a PCFG-LA frame-
work and French with a lexicalized parser, both lead-
ing to promising results (Seddah et al., 2011; Seddah
et al., 2010).

5 Conclusion

We presented several experiments reporting the im-
pact of lexical sparseness reduction on non lexical-
ized statistical parsing. We showed that, by using
state-of-the-art lemmatization and POS tagging on
a reduced tagset, parsing performance can be on a
par with lexicalized models that manage to extract
more information from a small corpus exhibiting a
rich lexical diversity. It remains to be seen whether
applying the same kind of simplifications to the rest
of the tagset, i.e. on the internal nodes, can further
improve parse structure quality. Finally, the methods
we presented in this paper are not language specific
and can be applied to other languages if similar re-
sources exist.
