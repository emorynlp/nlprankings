Abstract

Previous work on bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion from comparable corpora aimed at
ﬁnding a good representation for the usage
patterns of source and target words and at
comparing these patterns efﬁciently.
In
this paper, we try to work it out in an-
other way:
improving the quality of the
comparable corpus from which the bilin-
gual lexicon has to be extracted. To do
so, we propose a measure of comparabil-
ity and a strategy to improve the qual-
ity of a given corpus through an iterative
construction process. Our approach, be-
ing general, can be used with any existing
bilingual lexicon extraction method. We
show here that it leads to a signiﬁcant im-
provement over standard bilingual lexicon
extraction methods.

Introduction

1
Bilingual dictionaries are an essential resource
in many multilingual natural language process-
ing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation (Och
and Ney, 2003) and cross-language information
retrieval (CLIR) (Ballesteros and Croft, 1997).
Hand-coded dictionaries are of high quality, but
expensive to build and researchers have tried,
since the end of the 1980s,
to automatically
extract bilingual lexicons from parallel corpora
(see (Chen, 1993; Kay and R¨oscheisen, 1993;
Melamed, 1997a; Melamed, 1997b) for early
work). Parallel corpora are however difﬁcult to
get at in several domains, and the majority of
bilingual collections are comparable and not par-
allel. Due to their low cost of acquisition, sev-

eral researchers have tried to exploit such com-
parable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction
(Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998;
Rapp, 1999; D´ejean et al., 2002; Gaussier et al.,
2004; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007;
Yu and Tsujii, 2009). The notion of comparability
is however a loose one, and comparable corpora
range from lowly comparable ones to highly com-
parable ones and parallel ones. For data-driven
NLP techniques, using better corpora often leads
to better results, a fact which should be true for
the task of bilingual lexicon extraction. This point
has largely been ignored in previous work on the
subject. In this paper, we develop a well-founded
strategy to improve the quality of a comparable
corpus, so as to improve in turn the quality of the
bilingual lexicon extracted. To do so, we ﬁrst pro-
pose a measure of comparability which we then
use in a method to improve the quality of the ex-
isting corpus.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 introduces the experimental mate-
rials used for the different evaluations; compara-
bility measures are then presented and evaluated
in Section 3; in Section 4, we detail and evaluate
a strategy to improve the quality of a given corpus
while preserving its vocabulary; the method used
for bilingual lexicon extraction is then described
and evaluated in Section 5. Section 6 is then de-
voted to a discussion, prior to the conclusion given
in Section 7.

2 Experimental Materials

For the experiments reported here, several cor-
the parallel English-French
pora were used:
Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005),
the TREC

645

(http://trec.nist.gov/) Associated Press corpus
(AP, English) and the corpora used in the
multilingual
track of CLEF (http://www.clef-
campaign.org) which includes the Los Angeles
Times (LAT94, English), Glasgow Herald (GH95,
English), Le Monde (MON94, French), SDA
French 94 (SDA94, French) and SDA French 95
(SDA95, French).
In addition to these exist-
ing corpora, two monolingual corpora from the
Wikipedia dump1 were built. For English, all
the articles below the root category Society with
a depth less than 42 were retained. For French,
all the articles with a depth less than 7 below the
category Soci´et´e are extracted. As a result, the
English corpus Wiki-En consists of 367,918 doc-
uments and the French one Wiki-Fr consists of
378,297 documents.

The bilingual dictionary used in our experi-
ments is constructed from an online dictionary.
It consists of 33,372 distinct English words and
27,733 distinct French words, which constitutes
75,845 translation pairs. Standard preprocessing
steps: tokenization, POS-tagging and lemmatiza-
tion are performed on all the linguistic resources.
We will directly work on lemmatized forms of
content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs).

3 Measuring Comparability
As far as we can tell, there are no practical mea-
sures with which we can judge the degree of com-
parability of a bilingual corpus. In this paper, we
propose a comparability measure based on the ex-
pectation of ﬁnding the translation for each word
in the corpus. The measure is light-weighted and
does not depend on complex resources like the
machine translation system. For convenience, the
following discussions will be made in the context
of the English-French comparable corpus.

3.1 The Comparability Measure
For the comparable corpus C, if we consider the
translation process from the English part Ce to the

http://download.wikimedia.org. In this paper, we use the En-
glish dump ﬁle on July 13, 2009 and the French dump ﬁle on
July 7, 2009.

2There are several cycles in the category tree of
Wikipedia. It is thus necessary to deﬁne a threshold on the
depth to make the iterative process feasible.

French part Cf , a comparability measure Mef can
be deﬁned on the basis of the expectation of ﬁnd-
ing, for each English word we in the vocabulary
e of Ce, its translation in the vocabulary Cv
f of Cf .
Cv
Let σ be a function indicating whether a transla-
tion from the translation set Tw of w is found in
the vocabulary Cv of a corpus C, i.e.:

σ(w,Cv) =(cid:26) 1 iff Tw ∩ Cv 6= ∅

0 else

Mef is then deﬁned as:

e

e

=

Aw

Aw

e∩Dv

f )|w ∈ Cv
e )
}

Mef (Ce,Cf ) = E(σ(w,Cv
= Xw∈Cv
f ) · P r(w ∈ Cv
σ(w,Cv
e )
{z
|
e| Xw∈Cv
|Cv
e|
|Cv
e ∩ Dv
where Dv
e is the English part of a given, inde-
pendent bilingual dictionary D, and where the last
equality is based on the fact that, the compara-
ble corpus and the bilingual dictionary being in-
dependent of one another, the probability of ﬁnd-
f of a word w is the same
ing the translation in Cv
3. Furthermore,
for w is in Cv
the presence of common words suggests that one
should rely on a presence/absence criterion rather
than on the number of occurrences to avoid a bias
towards common words. Given the natural lan-
guage text, our evaluation will show that the sim-
ple presence/absence criterion can perform very
well. This leads to P r(w ∈ Cv
e|, and
ﬁnally to:
e| Xw∈Cv

Mef (Ce,Cf ) =

e ) = 1/|Cv

e and in Cv

σ(w,Cv
f )

|Cv
e ∩ Dv

e ∩ Dv

e

This formula shows that Mef is actually the pro-
portion of English words translated in the French
part of the comparable corpus. Similarly, the
counterpart of Mef , Mf e, is deﬁned as:

Mf e(Ce,Cf ) =

1

|Cv
f ∩ Dv

f| Xw∈Cv

f∩Dv

f

σ(w,Cv
e )

3The fact can be reliable only when a substantial part of
the corpus vocabulary is covered by the dictionary. Fortu-
nately, the constraint is satisﬁed in most applications where
the common but not the specialized corpora like the medical
corpora are involved.

and measures the proportion of French words in
f translated in the English part of the compara-
Cv
ble corpus. A symmetric version of these mea-
sures is obtained by considering the proportion of
the words (both English and French) for which a
translation can be found in the corpus:

M (Ce,Cf )

= Pw∈Cv

e

σ(w,Cv
|Cv
e ∩ Dv

f ) +Pw∈Cv

e| + |Cv

σ(w,Cv
e )

We now present an evaluation of these measures
on artiﬁcial test corpora.

3.2 Validation
In order to test the comparability measures, we de-
veloped gold-standard comparability scores from
the Europarl and AP corpora. We start from the
parallel corpus, Europarl, of which we degrade
the comparability by gradually importing some
documents from either Europarl or AP. Three
groups (Ga, Gb, Gc) of comparable corpora are
built in this fashion. Each group consists of test
corpora with a gold-standard comparability rang-
ing, arbitrarily, from 0 to 1 and corresponding to
the proportion of documents in “parallel” transla-
tion. The ﬁrst group Ga is built from Europarl
only. First, the Europarl corpus is split into 10
equal parts, leading to 10 parallel corpora (P1, P2,
. . . , P10) with a gold-standard comparability arbi-
trarily set to 1. Then for each parallel corpus, e.g.
Pi, we replace a certain proportion p of the En-
glish part with documents of the same size from
another parallel corpus Pj(j 6= i), producing the
new corpus P 0i with less comparability which is
the gold-standard comparability 1 − p. For each
Pi, as p increases, we obtain several comparable
corpora with a decreasing gold-standard compara-
bility score. All the Pi and their descendant cor-
pora constitute the group Ga. The only difference
between Gb and Ga is that, in Gb, the replacement
in Pi is done with documents from the AP cor-
pus and not from Europarl. In Gc, we start with
10 ﬁnal, comparable corpora P 0i from Ga. These
corpora have a gold-standard comparability of 0
in Ga, and of 1 in Gc. Then each P 0i is further
degraded by replacing certain portions with docu-
ments from the AP corpus.

Figure 1: Evolution of M wrt gold-standard
on the corpus group Gc (x-axis: gold-standard
scores, y-axis: M scores)

We then computed, for each comparable cor-
pus in each group, its comparability according
to one of the comparability measures. Figure 1
plots the measure M for ten comparable corpora
and their descendants from Gc, according to their
gold-standard comparability scores. As one can
note, the measure M is able to capture almost all
the differences in comparability and is strongly
correlated with the gold-standard. The correla-
tion between the different measures and the gold-
standard is ﬁnally computed with Pearson corre-
lation coefﬁcient. The results obtained are listed
in Table 1. As one can note, Mf e performs worst
among the three measures, the reason being that
the process to construct Gb and Gc yields unbal-
anced bilingual corpora, the English section being
larger than the French one. Translations of French
words are still likely to be found in the English
corpus, even though the corpora are not compara-
ble. On all the 3 groups, M performs best and cor-
relates very well with the gold standard, meaning
that M was able to capture all the differences in
comparability artiﬁcially introduced in the degra-
dation process we have considered. This is the
measure we will retain in the following parts.

Having established a measure for the degree of
comparability of bilingual corpora, we now turn
to the problem of improving the quality of com-
parable corpora.

Improving Corpus Quality

4
We here try to improve the quality of a given cor-
pus C, which we will refer to as the base corpus,
by extracting the highly comparable subpart CH
which is above a certain degree of comparability
η (Step 1), and by enriching the lowly comparable
part CL with texts from other sources (Step 2). As
we are interested in extracting information related
to the vocabulary of the base corpus, we want the
newly built corpus to contain a substantial part of
the base corpus. This can be achieved by preserv-
ing in Step 1 as many documents from the base
corpus as possible (e.g. by considering low values
of η), and by using in step 2 sources close to the
base corpus.
4.1 Step 1: Extracting CH
The strategy consisting of building all the possible
sub-corpora of a given size from a given compa-
rable corpora is not realistic as soon as the num-
ber of documents making up the corpora is larger
than a few thousands. In such cases, better ways
for extracting subparts have to be designed. The
strategy we have adopted here aims at efﬁciently
extracting a subpart of C above a certain degree of
comparability and is based on the following prop-
erty.
Property 1. Let d1
f )
f and d2
be two English (resp. French) documents from a
bilingual corpus C. We consider, as before, that
the bilingual dictionary D is independent from C.
f0 ⊆ d1
f ,
Let (d1
f0 is a
which means d1
subpart of d1
f .
We assume:

e0 ⊆ d1
e0 is a subpart of d1

f0) be such that: d1

e, d1
e and d1

e (resp. d1

e and d2

e0, d1

(i)

= |d1

|d2

|d2

(ii) Mef (d1
Mf e(d1

f ) ≥ Mef (d2
f0) ≥ Mf e(d2

e, d2
f )
e, d2
f )

M (d2

e, d2

f ) ≤ M (d1

e ∪ d2

e, d1

f ∪ d2
f )

Then:

Proof [sketch]: Let B = (d1
e ∩
e ). One can show, by exploiting condition (ii),
Dv
that:

e) ∩ Dv

e )\(d2

e ∪ d2

σ(w, d1

f ∪ d2

f ) ≥ |B|Mef (d2

e, d2
f )

and similarly that:

Xw∈B
Xw∈d2

e∩Dv

e

σ(w, d1

f ∪ d2

f ) ≥ |d2

e ∩ Dv

e|Mef (d2

e, d2
f )

Then exploiting condition (i), and the indepen-
dence between the corpus and the dictionary, one
arrives at:

e

Pw∈(d1
e ∪ d2
|(d1
e ∩ Dv
≥ |d2
|d2
e ∩ Dv

e∪d2
e) ∩ Dv

σ(w, d1
e)∩Dv
e| + |(d1
f ∪ d2
e, d2
f )
f ∩ Dv
f|

e|Mef (d2
e| + |d2

f ∪ d2
f )
f ) ∩ Dv
f|

e, d2

The same development on Mf e completes the
proof. 2
Property 1 shows that one can incrementally ex-
tract from a bilingual corpus a subpart with a guar-
anteed minimum degree of comparability η by it-
eratively adding new elements, provided (a) that
the new elements have a degree of comparability
of at least η and (b) that they are less comparable
than the currently extracted subpart (conditions
(ii)). This strategy is described in Algorithm 1.
Since the degree of comparability is always above
a certain threshold and since the new documents
f ) are the most comparable among
selected (d2
the remaining documents, condition (i) is likely
to be satisﬁed, as this condition states that the in-
crease in the vocabulary from the second docu-
ments to the union of the two is the same in both
languages. Similarly, considering new elements
by decreasing comparability scores is a necessary
step for the satisfaction of condition (ii), which
states that the current subpart should be uniformly
more comparable than the element to be added.
Hence, the conditions for property 1 to hold are
met in Algorithm 1, which ﬁnally yields a corpus
with a degree of comparability of at least η.
4.2 Step 2: Enriching CL
This step tries to absorb knowledge from other
resources, which will be called external corpus,

to enrich the lowly comparable part CL which is
the left part in C during the creation of CH. One
choice for obtaining the external corpus CT is to
fetch documents which are likely to be compara-
ble from the Internet.
In this case, we ﬁrst ex-
tract representative words for each document in
CL, translate them using the bilingual dictionary
and retrieve associated documents via a search en-
gine. An alternative approach is of course to use
existing bilingual corpora. Once CT has been con-
structed, the lowly comparable part CL can be en-
riched in exactly the same way as in section 4.1:
First, Algorithm 1 is used on the English part of
CL and the French part of CT to get the high-
quality document pairs. Then the French part of
CL is enriched with the English part of CT by the
same algorithm. All the high-quality document
pairs are then added to CH to constitute the ﬁnal
result.

pora after elimination of short documents (< 30

For the extraction of the highly comparable part
CH from the base corpus C0, we set η to 0.3
so as to extract a substantial subpart of C0. Af-
ter this step, corresponding to Algorithm 1, we
have 20,124 English-French document pairs in
CH. The second step is to enrich the lowly compa-
rable part CL of the base corpus documents from
the external resources C1
T . The ﬁnal cor-
pora we obtain consist of 46,996 document pairs
for C1 (with C1
T ) and of 54,402 document pairs for
T ), size similar to the one of C0. The
C2 (with C2
proportion of documents (columns “D-e” and “D-
f”), sentences (columns “S-e” and “S-f”) and vo-
cabulary (columns “V-e” and “V-f”) of C0 found
in C1 and C2 is given in Table 3. As one can note,
the ﬁnal corpora obtained through the method pre-
sented above preserve most of the information
from the base corpus. Especially for the vocab-
ulary, the ﬁnal corpora cover nearly all the vocab-
ulary of the base corpus. Considering the compa-
rability scores, the comparability of C1 is 0.912
and the one of C2 is 0.916. Both of them are
more comparable than the base corpus of which
the comparability is 0.882.

From these results of the intrinsic evaluation,
one can conclude that the strategy developed to
improve the corpus quality while preserving most
of its information is efﬁcient: The corpora ob-
tained here, C1 and C2, are more comparable than
the base corpus C0 and preserve most of its infor-
mation. We now turn to the problem of extracting
bilingual lexicons from these corpora.

5 Bilingual Lexicon Extraction

Following standard practice in bilingual lexicon
extraction from comparable corpora, we rely on
the approach proposed by Fung and Yee (1998).
In this approach, each word w is represented as a

context vector consisting of the weight a(wc) of
each context word wc, the context being extracted
from a window running through the corpus. Once
context vectors for English and French words have
been constructed, a general bilingual dictionary D
can be used to bridge them by accumulating the
contributions from words that are translation of
each other. Standard similarity measures, as the
cosine or the Jaccard coefﬁcient, can then be ap-
plied to compute the similarity between vectors.
For example, the cosine leads to:

sc(we, wf ) =P(wc

e)a(wc
f )

e,wc

f )∈D a(wc
k−→wek · k−→wfk

(1)

5.1 Using Algorithm 1 pseudo-Alignments
The process we have deﬁned in the previous sec-
tion to improve the quality of a given corpus while
preserving its vocabulary makes use of highly
comparable document pairs, and thus provides
some loose alignments between the two corpora.
One can thus try to leverage the above approach
to bilingual lexicon extraction by re-weighting
sc(we, wf ) by a quantity which is large if we and
wf appear in many document pairs with a high
comparability score, and small otherwise. In this
section, we can not use the alignments in algo-
rithm 1 directly because the alignments in the
comparable corpus should not be 1 to 1 and we
did not try to ﬁnd the precise 1 to 1 alignments in
algorithm 1.

Let η be the threshold used in algorithm 1 to
construct the improved corpus and let φ(de, df )
be deﬁned as:

φ(de, df ) =(cid:26) 1 iff M (de, df ) ≥ η

0 else

Let He (resp. Hf ) be the set of documents con-
taining word we (resp. wf ). We deﬁne the joint
probability of we and wf as being proportional

to the number of comparable document pairs they
belong to, where two documents are comparable
if their comparability score is above η, that is:

p(we, wf ) ∝ Xde∈He,df∈Hf

φ(de, df )

The marginal probability p(we) can then be writ-
ten as:

p(we) ∝ Xwf∈Cv

f

p(we, wf )

∝ Xde∈He Xdf∈Cd

f

|df| · φ(de, df )

Assuming that all df in Cd
f have roughly the
same vocabulary size and all de have the same
number of comparable counterparts in Cd
f , then
the marginal probability can be simpliﬁed as:
p(we) ∝ |He|. By resorting to the exponential
of the point-wise mutual information, one ﬁnally
obtains the following weight:

π(we, wf ) =

∝

p(we, wf )
p(we) · p(wf )

1

|He| · |Hf| Xde∈He,df∈Hf

φ(de, df )

which has the desired property: It is large if the
two words appear in comparable document pairs
more often than chance would predict, and small
otherwise. We thus obtain the revised similarity
score for we and wf :

scr(we, wf ) = sc(we, wf ) · π(we, wf )

(2)

5.2 Validation
In order to measure the performance of the bilin-
gual lexicon extraction method presented above,
we divided the original dictionary into 2 parts:
10% of the English words (3,338 words) together
with their translations are randomly chosen and
used as the evaluation set, the remaining words
(30,034 words) being used to compute context
vectors and similarity between them.
In this
study, the weight a(wc) used in the context vec-
tors (see above) are taken to be the tf-idf score
of wc: a(wc) = tf-idf(wc). English words not

650

e or with no translation in Cv

present in Cv
f are ex-
cluded from the evaluation set. For each English
word in the evaluation set, all the French words
f are then ranked according to their similar-
in Cv
ity with the English word (using either equation 1
or 2). To evaluate the quality of the lexicons ex-
tracted, we ﬁrst retain for each English word its
N ﬁrst translations, and then measure the preci-
sion of the lists obtained, which amounts in this
case to the proportion of lists containing the cor-
rect translation (in case of multiple translations, a
list is deemed to contain the correct translation as
soon as one of the possible translations is present).
This evaluation procedure has been used in pre-
vious work (e.g.
(Gaussier et al., 2004)) and is
now standard for the evaluation of lexicons ex-
tracted from comparable corpora.
In this study,
N is set to 20. Furthermore, several studies have
shown that it is easier to ﬁnd the correct transla-
tions for frequent words than for infrequent ones
(Pekar et al., 2006). To take this fact into account,
we distinguished different frequency ranges to as-
sess the validity of our approach for all frequency
ranges. Words with frequency less than 100 are
deﬁned as low-frequency words (WL), whereas
words with frequency larger than 400 are high-
frequency words (WH), and words with frequency
in between are medium-frequency words (WM ).
We then tested the standard method based on
the cosine similarity (equation 1) on the corpora
C0, CH, C0H, C1 and C2. The results obtained are
displayed in Table 4, and correspond to columns
2-6. They show that the standard approach per-
forms signiﬁcantly better on the improved corpora
C1/C2 than on the base corpus C0. The overall pre-
cision is increased by 5.3% on C1 (corresponding
to a relative increase of 26%) and 9.5% on C2 (cor-
responding to a relative increase of 51%), even
though the low-frequency words, which dominate
the overall precision, account for a higher pro-
portion in C1 (61.3%) and C2 (61.3%) than in
C0 (56.2%). For the medium and high frequency
words, the precision is increased by over 11% on
C1 and 16% on C2. As pointed out in other stud-
ies, the performance for the low-frequency words
is usually bad due to the lack of context informa-
tion. This explains the relatively small improve-
ment obtained here (only 2.2% on C1 and 6.7%

on C2). It should also be noticed that the perfor-
mance of the standard approach is better on C2
than on C1, which may be due to the fact that C2
is slightly larger than C1 and thus provides more
information or to the actual content of these cor-
pora. Lastly, if we consider the results on the cor-
pus CH which is produced by only choosing the
highly comparable part from C0, the overall preci-
sion is increased by only 1.9%, which might come
from the fact that the size of CH is less than half
the size of C0. We also notice the better results on
CH than on C0H of the same size which consists of
randomly choosing documents from C0.
The results obtained with the reﬁned approach
making use of the comparable document pairs
found in the improved corpus (equation 2) are
also displayed in Table 4 (columns “C1 new” and
“C2 new”). From these results, one can see that
the overall precision is further improved by 2.0%
on C1 and 2.3% on C2, compared with the stan-
dard approach. For all the low, medium and
high-frequency words, the precision has been im-
proved, which demonstrates that the information
obtained through the corpus enrichment process
contributes to improve the quality of the extracted
bilingual lexicons. Compared with the original
base corpus C0, the overall improvement of the
precision on both C1 and C2 with the reﬁned ap-
proach is signiﬁcant and important (respectively
corresponding to a relative improvement of 35%
and 62%), which also demonstrates that the efﬁ-
ciency of the reﬁned approach is not conﬁned to a
speciﬁc external corpus.

6 Discussion
It is in a way useless to deploy bilingual lexicon
extraction techniques if translation equivalents are
not present in the corpus. This simple fact is at the
basis of our approach which consists in construct-
ing comparable corpora close to the original cor-
pus and which are more likely to contain transla-
tion equivalents as they have a guaranteed degree
of comparability. The pseudo-alignments identi-
ﬁed in the construction process are then used to
leverage state-of-the-art bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion methods. This approach to bilingual lexicon
extraction from comparable corpora radically dif-
fers, to our knowledge, from previous approaches

Table 4: Precision of the different approaches on different corpora

which are mainly variants of the standard method
proposed in (Fung and Yee, 1998) and (Rapp,
1999). For example, the method developed in
(D´ejean et al., 2002) and (Chiao and Zweigen-
baum, 2002) involves a representation of dictio-
nary entries with context vectors onto which new
words are mapped. Pekar et al.
(2006) smooth
the context vectors used in the standard approach
in order to better deal with low frequency words.
A nice geometric interpretation of these processes
is proposed in (Gaussier et al., 2004), which fur-
thermore introduces variants based on Fisher ker-
nels, Canonical Correlation Analysis and a com-
bination of them, leading to an improvement of
the F1-score of 2% (from 0.14 to 0.16) when con-
sidering the top 20 candidates. In contrast, the ap-
proach we have developed yields an improvement
of 7% (from 0.13 to 0.20) of the F-1 score on C2,
again considering the top 20 candidates. More im-
portant, however, is the fact that the approach we
have developed can be used in conjunction with
any existing bilingual extraction method, as the
strategies for improving the corpus quality and the
re-weighting formula (equation 2) are general. We
will assess in the future whether substantial gains
are also attained with other methods.

Some studies have tried to extract subparts of
comparable corpora to complement existing par-
allel corpora. Munteanu (2004) thus developed a
maximum entropy classiﬁer aiming at extracting
those sentence pairs which can be deemed paral-
lel. The step for choosing similar document pairs
in this work resembles some of our steps. How-
ever their work focuses on high quality and spe-
ciﬁc documents pairs, as opposed to the entire cor-
pus of guaranteed quality we want to build.
In
this latter case, the cross-interaction between doc-
uments impacts the overall comparability score,
and new methods, as the one we have introduced,

need to be proposed. Similarly, Munteanu and
Marcu (2006) propose a method to extract sub-
sentential fragments from non-parallel corpora.
Again,
the targeted elements are very speciﬁc
(parallel sentences or sub-sentences) and limited,
and the focus is put on a few sentences which can
be considered parallel. As already mentioned, we
rather focus here on building a new corpus which
preserves most of the information in the original
corpus. The construction process we have pre-
sented is theoretically justiﬁed and allows one to
preserve ca. 95% of the original vocabulary.

7 Conclusion
We have ﬁrst introduced in this paper a compara-
bility measure based on the expectation of ﬁnd-
ing translation word pairs in the corpus. We have
then designed a strategy to construct an improved
comparable corpus by (a) extracting a subpart of
the original corpus with a guaranteed compara-
bility level, and (b) by completing the remaining
subpart with external resources, in our case other
existing bilingual corpora. We have then shown
how the information obtained during the construc-
tion process could be used to improve state-of-
the-art bilingual lexicon extraction methods. We
have furthermore assessed the various steps of
our approach and shown: (a) that the compara-
bility measure we introduced captures variations
in the degree of comparability between corpora,
(b) that the construction process we introduced
leads to an improved corpus preserving most of
the original vocabulary, and (c) that the use of
pseudo-alignments through simple re-weighting
yields bilingual lexicons of higher quality.
