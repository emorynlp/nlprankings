Abstract 

This work presents the tentative version of the 

protocol designed for annotation of a Russian 

metaphor corpus using the rapid annotation 

tool BRAT. 

The first part of the article is devoted to the 

procedure of "shallow" annotation in which 

metaphor-related words are identified 

according to a slightly modified version of the 

MIPVU procedure. The paper presents the 

results of two reliability tests and the measures 

of inter-annotator agreement obtained in them. 

Further on, the article gives a brief account of 

the linguistic problems that were encountered 

in adapting MIPVU to Russian. The rest of the 

first part describes the classes of metaphor-

related words and the rules of their annotation 

with BRAT. The examples of annotation show 

how the visualization functionalities of BRAT 

allow the researcher to describe the 

multifaceted nature of metaphor related words 

and the complexity of their relations. 

The second part of the paper speaks about the 

annotation of conceptual metaphors (the "deep" 

annotation), where formulations of conceptual 

metaphors are inferred from the basic and 

contextual meanings of metaphor-related words 

from the "shallow" annotation, which is 

expected to make the metaphor formulation 

process more controllable. 

1 Introduction 

The manually annotated Russian-language 
metaphor corpus is an ongoing project in its initial 
stage, in which a group of native Russian experts 

aims to annotate a corpus of contemporary Russian 
texts. 

The annotation is performed at the two levels:  

1) shallow annotation – identification of 
metaphor-related words according to a slightly 

modified version of MIPVU, the procedure for 
linguistic metaphor identification (Steen et al., 

2010); 

2) deep annotation – identification of cross-
domain mappings and formulation of conceptual 

metaphors on the basis of basic and contextual 
meanings of metaphor-related words.  

The annotations are visualized with the BRAT 

annotation tool (http://brat.nlplab.org/, Stenetorp et 
al., 2012).  

2. Shallow annotation 

The shallow annotation, based on the MIPVU 
procedure for linguistic metaphor identification 

(Steen et al., 2010), consists in indentifying and 
annotating all metaphor-related words in the 
corpus. 

2.1 MIPVU procedure 

In MIPVU, metaphor-related words are the 

words whose contextual meanings are opposed to 

their basic meanings.  
The basic meaning of a word is: 
a) more concrete; what it evokes is easier to 

imagine, see, hear, feel, smell and taste; 

b) related to bodily action; 
c) more precise (as opposed to vague) (ibid.).

Table 1. Inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) in Reliability Tests 1 and 2 

The contextual meaning of a word is the 

meaning observed in a given context. 
Annotators establish the basic and the contextual 

meaning for each word in the corpus using 
dictionary definitions from (Dictionary of the 

Russian Language, 1981-1984) which is the 

primary dictionary, and (Dictionary of the Russian 
Language, 1999) as a subsidiary dictionary.  

According to MIPVU, a lexical unit is annotated 
as a metaphor-related word if its contextual 

meaning contrasts with its basic meaning (by the 

basis of concreteness, body-relatedness and 
preciseness, as described above), and the 

contextual and the basic meanings can be 
understood in comparison with each other: 

CM�BM. 
A lexical unit is not a metaphor-related word if 

its contextual meaning is the same as its basic 

meaning, or if the contrast by the basis of 
concreteness, body-relatedness and preciseness is 

not conspicuous enough: CM=BM. 
MIPVU does not take into account the historical 

aspect, i.e. it does not differentiate between older 

and newer meanings or look into the etymology of 
words, and treats all meanings from the standpoint 

of an average contemporary user of the language 
(Steen et al., 2010). 

In BRAT annotation tool, the contextual and the 
basic meanings of metaphor-related words are 
recorded in a special text field which is displayed 

when a viewer hovers the computer mouse over a 
word. 

2.2. Reliability Tests 

We have performed two Reliability Tests in order 
to 1) to check the transferability and applicability 
of MIPVU, which was originally designed for 

English, to Russian-language material and 2) to 

assess the reliability of MIPVU on Russian-

language material by measuring the rate of inter-
annotator agreement.  

The Reliability Tests had the following setup:  

– 3 annotators (PhDs and current PhD 
students with prior experience in conceptual 
metaphor studies); 

– a collection of 4 text excerpts (500-600 
words each), representing the 4 genres: fiction, 

transcribed spoken, popular science/academic, and 

news texts; 
– POS-tagged files from the National 

Russian Corpus (http://ruscorpora.ru/) in xhtml-
format; 

– 2 dictionaries used to define the word 
meanings: (Dictionary of the Russian Language, 
1981-1984, Dictionary of the Russian Language, 

1999).  
The inter-annotator agreement was measured by 

Fleiss' kappa (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) using 
binary classification, i.e. 1 for any metaphor-

related word and 0 for otherwise. The measure of 

Fleiss' kappa in Reliability Tests 1 and 2 is 
presented in Table 1 in comparison with the similar 

tests done for VUAMC, the VU Amsterdam 
Metaphor Corpus (Steen et al., 2010).  

In the first Reliability Test, the annotators were 

instructed to follow the basic rules of MIPVU, as 
described in 2.1. As seen from Table 1, the 

resultant agreement was below both the inter-
annotator agreement observed on VUAMC and the 

minimum threshold accepted for Fleiss' kappa. 
Following Reliability Test 1, we analyzed the 

cases of disagreement between the annotators, and 

the reports from the annotators about the 
difficulties they experienced when applying 

MIPVU.  

After that we designed the new version of the 
MIPVU rules which attempted to address those 

problems (see 2.3). 
The second Reliability Test, which was run on a 

new collection, was annotated according to the 

revised rules. As a result, the inter-annotator 
agreement significantly improved, exceeding the 

statistical threshold for Fleiss' kappa and 

78



outperforming the agreement measures reported 
for VUAMC (see Table 1). 

2.3. MIPVU rules: revised and extended 

The analysis of the cases of disagreement and the 

annotators' problem reports has identified 3 major 

groups of difficulties. Two of them concerned the 
application of the MIPVU procedure in general, 
and one group of problems was specific for using 

MIPVU with Russian dictionaries on Russian 

texts.  

The first major problem had to do with defining 
the basic meanings of words; the annotators 
reported significant difficulties in singling out one 

basic meaning from all the available meanings, as 

required by MIPVU. The solution for this problem 

suggests defining a group of basic meanings rather 
than one basic meaning, each of which shares the 

feature of concreteness, body-relatedness and 
preciseness. We have also listed the basic 

meanings of all major Russian prepositions, as 

prepositions are reported to account for 38.5-
46.9% of metaphor-related words in a corpus 

(Steen et al., 2010) and therefore are essential for 
inter-annotator agreement. 

The second issue concerned the treatment of 

idioms and proper names, for which MIPVU does 
not offer a comprehensive solution. In our version 

of annotation, we introduced special tags for these 
classes – Set Expression and Proper Name (see 
2.4.6, 2.4.7). 

The most numerous group of problems dealt 
with using Russian dictionaries and adjusting 

MIPVU to the specific morphological, 
grammatical, etc. features of Russian, such as: 

- In the dictionaries, word meanings are often 

defined through the meanings of words that have 
the same morphological root, but belong to a 

different part of speech (deverbal nouns, adjectival 
participles and adverbs, adverbs formed on the 
basis of adverbial participles). 

- Some of the meanings of imperfecitve verbs 

are defined on the basis of their perfective 

counterparts. Some of the meanings of passive 
verbs are defined on the basis of their active 

counterparts. 
- Homonymous grammatical forms belonging to 

different parts of speech are listed in one dictionary 

entry.  

- Agglutinative and abbreviated compound 
words (consisting of more than one stem) require 

separate analysis of each of their stems. 
- Specialist terms and slang words are not listed 

in general dictionaries. 
- The best candidate for the basic meaning may 

be a stylistically marked meaning of a word. 

The solutions we offered to address these 
linguistic issues of MIPVU adaptation to Russian 

are described in detail in (Badryzlova et al., 2013). 

2.4. Classes of metaphor-related words in 

the shallow annotation 

Depending on the type of relation between the 
contextual meaning and the basic meaning, the 

shallow annotation of the Russian metaphor corpus 

distinguishes the following classes of metaphor-

related words that were present in the original 
MIPVU procedure (Steen et al., 2010): Indirect 

Metaphor, borderline cases, or WIDLII (When in 
Doubt, Leave It In), Implicit Metaphors, Direct 
Metaphors, Metaphor Flags (mFlag), 

Personification, and lexical units discarded for 
metaphor analysis (DFMA). Additionally, we 

annotate the classes of Set Expression and Proper 
Name.  

Importantly, the functionalities provided by 

BRAT annotation tool allow assigning multiple 
tags to a lexical unit; for example, a word or a 

phrase can take the tags of Indirect Metaphor and 
Personifier/Personified at the same time (e.g. see 
the word "liniya" in Fig. 3); metaphor-related 

annotations can overlap, thus displaying the multi-
faceted nature of metaphor-related words and the 

complexity of their relations. 

2.4.1  Indirect Metaphor 

Indirect Metaphor is observed when the contextual 

meaning of a lexical unit contrasts with its basic 

meaning: CM � BM (Steen et al., 2010).  
Figure 1: В последнее время все чаще 

выпускают полноприводные машины, в 
которых раздаточная коробка вообще не 

предусмотрена. [Recently, all-wheel drive 

vehicles have been produced ("released") which 
feature no transfer case at all.] 

79



 
Figure 2. A WIDLII case 

 

The verb "vypuskat'" in Figure 1 is an Indirect 
Metaphor because CM � BM: 

Contextual 

Meaning 

"vypuskat'" 

 Basic Meaning 
"vypuskat'" 

Произвести, 

выработать 

(изделия, товары) 
[To produce, to 
turn out (products, 

goods)] 

� Дать возможность или 

разрешить кому-л. 

уйти, удалиться 
откуда-л., куда-л.; 
отпустить [To allow or 

permit smb to leave or 
go out; to release smb 

(The fields above the sentence lines in Figures 
1-6 contain the definitions of the contextual and 
the basic meanings. The definitions are given 

according to (Dictionary of the Russian Language, 
1981-1984). 

2.4.2 Borderline cases (WIDLII – When 

In Doubt, Leave It In) 

We state a WIDLII case when it is not quite clear 
whether the contextual and the basic are identical 

or not, i.e. whether CM � BM or CM = BM 

(Steen et al., 2010). 
Figure 2: Камнем преткновения стал вопрос: 

сколько же колес должно крутиться от 
мотора? [The following question has become the 

stumbling block: how many wheels should be 
rotated by the engine?] 

The noun "vopros" in Figure 2 is a WIDLII case 

because it simultaneously displays a dual relation 

between the contextual and the basic meaning: CM 

� BM, and CM = BM: 

Contextual 

Meaning "vorpos" 

 Basic Meaning 

"vopros" 
Дело, предмет 
обсуждения, 

внимания и т. п. 

[The matter or the 

subject of a 
discussion, 
consideration, etc.] 

� Обращение к кому-
л., требующее 

ответа, разъяснения 

и т. п. [An utterance 

requiring response, 
explanation, etc.] 

and  

Contextual Meaning 

"vopros" 

 Basic Meaning 

"vopros" 

Обращение к кому-
л., требующее 

ответа, разъяснения 
и т. п. [An utterance 

requiring response, 

explanation, etc.] 

= Обращение к кому-
л., требующее 

ответа, разъяснения 
и т. п. [An utterance 

requiring response, 

explanation, etc.] 

2.4.3 Implicit Metaphor 

Implicit Metaphors are anaphoric pronouns that are 

coreferential with a metaphor-related antecedent 
(Steen et al., 2010). In the shallow annotation 

proposed in this paper, the Implicit Metaphor and 
its metaphoric antecedent are connected by the 

relation "Coreference". 
Figure 3: Однако вопреки расчетам 

террористов наша линия на политическое 

урегулирование в Чечне, опирающаяся на 
поддержку чеченского народа, остается 

неизменной. Мы высоко ценим то понимание, 

Figure 1. Indirect Metaphor 

80



которая она встречает в исламском мире. 

[However, despite the expectations of the 

terrorists, our line on political settlement in 
Chechnya, which leans on the support of the 

Chechen people, has stayed unchanged. We highly 
appreciate the understanding she (it) meets in the 

Islamic world.] 

The pronoun "ona" [she (it)]) in Figure 3 is an 

anaphor of the Indirect Metaphor "liniya" [line], 
as:  

Contextual 

Meaning "liniya" 

 Basic Meaning 

"liniya" 
Узкая полоса, 

черта, проведенная 
на какой-л. 
поверхности от 

одной точки к 
другой. [Thin mark 

drawn on a surface 
from one point to 
another]. 

� Направление, 

образ действий, 
мыслей. [Direction 
or manner of action 

or thought]. 

Therefore, "ona" is a case of Implicit Metaphor. 

2.4.4 Personification 

We have elaborated the structure of Personification 

that was suggested by the original MIPVU 
procedure. The visualization functionalities of 
BRAT annotation tool have enabled us to regard 

personification as a relation between the two 
entities: the source of personification and the target 

of personification. 

The source of personification (Personifier) is a 

lexical unit whose basic meaning implies the 

presence of an animate agent. 
The target of personification (Personified) is a 

lexical unit denoting inanimate subjects, 
phenomena, or abstract notions onto which the 

features of an animate agent from the Personifier 

are mapped. 

The Personifier and the Personified are 
connected by the relation of "Personification". 

Figure 3: Однако вопреки расчетам 

террористов наша линия на политическое 

урегулирование в Чечне, опирающаяся на 

поддержку чеченского народа, остается 
неизменной. Мы высоко ценим то понимание, 
которая она встречает в исламском мире. 

[However, despite the expectations of the 

terrorists, our line on political settlement in 

Chechnya, which leans on the support of the 
Chechen people, has stayed unchanged. We highly 
appreciate the understanding she (it) meets in the 

Islamic world.] 
In this sentence, already discussed above, the 

verb "vstrechat'" [to meet] (which has been tagged 
as Indirect Metaphor) is also the source of 
personification (Personifier), as its basic meaning 

implies an animate agent:  

Contextual 

Meaning 

"vstrechat'" 

 Basic Meaning 

"vstrechat'" 

Увидеть идущего 

навстречу, сойтись 

� Получить, 

испытать, 

 
Figure 3. Implicit Metaphor, Personification 

81



Figure 4. DFMA 

с ним; Выйдя 
навстречу 

прибывающему 
(прибывающим), 

принять, 

приветствовать их. 
[To see a person 

walking towards 
you, and to approach 

him/her; to walk 

towards arriving 
visitor(s) while 

greeting and 
welcoming them].  

оказавшись в 
каком-л. 

положении, при 
каком-л. действии 

и т. п. [To receive 

or experience smth 
while being in a 

certain situation, in 
the course of a 

certain action, 

etc.]. 

The target of personification (Personified) is the 
anaphoric pronoun "ona" [she] and, consequently, 

its metaphorical antecedent, the noun "liniya" 
[line]. 

2.4.5 DFMA (Discarded for Metaphor 

Analysis) 

The tag DFMA is used in MIPVU and in our 

shallow annotation when the incompleteness of the 
context does not allow the annotator to establish 

the contextual meaning (Steen et al., 2010). Such 
cases are commonly observed either in incomplete, 

or syntactically, lexically or stylistically incorrect 

utterances that are characteristic of spoken 
language. 

Figure 4 presents an excerpt from a TV talk 
show in which two female hosts interview a female 

rock singer: "Смирнова. Мы/ старые тётеньки / 

нам нравятся ваши песни / но вот это на нас 
решительно не действует. Поэтому весь этот 

напор / и эффектное" я / космополит !"/" меня 
волнует..."/ как вы там сказали ... секунду.../" 

меня волнует наводнение в Чехии "...   

Арбенина. Что-что?   Смирнова. Я вам 
покажу. Девушка/ я вам покажу!   [Host. We / 

old ladies / we like your songs / but these things 

have absolutely no effect on us / And all that drive 
/ and the pretentious "I am / a cosmopolitan!" / "I 

am concerned about…" / how did you put it… just 
a second… / "I am concerned about the flooding in 

the Czech Republic"… Guest. Come again? Host. I 

will show you. Young lady, I will show you!] 
The contextual meaning of the verb "pokazat'" 

[to show] is not apparent from the context. It is 
possible that the host indeed intends to 

demonstrate a certain object to the guest; then the 

contextual meaning will be identical to the basic 
meaning:  

Contextual Meaning 

"pokazat'" 

 Basic Meaning 

"pokazat'" 

Дать увидеть, 
представить для 

разглядывания, 
рассматривания [To 

allow smb to see 

smth, to present smth 
for display] 

= Дать увидеть, 
представить для 

разглядывания, 
рассматривания [To 

allow smb to see 

smth, to present smth 
for display] 

However, it is also possible that the host's 

purport was somewhat different, for example: 

Contextual 

Meaning 

"pokazat'" 

 Basic Meaning 

"pokazat'" 

Проучить кого-л., 
сделать нагоняй 
кому-л. за что-л. 

[To call smb to 

task, to tell smb 

off] 

� Дать увидеть, 
представить для 
разглядывания, 

рассматривания [To 

allow smb to see smth, 

to present smth for 
display] 

After all, in the absence of the extra-linguistic 

context, the available linguistic context does not 
appear sufficient for making a judgment about the 

speaker's actual intention, so the case of "pokazat'" 
is discarded for metaphor analysis. 

82



 
Figure 5. Set Expression 

 
Figure 6. Proper Name 

 
Figure 7. Direct Metaphor, mFlag 

2.4.6 Set Expression 

This class, initially not present in the original 
version of MIPVU, was introduced by us into the 

shallow annotation as a solution to insufficient 

guidelines on treatment of idiomatic expressions in 
MIPVU (see 2.3). 

The class of Set Expressions includes idioms 
and multi-word units as they are listed in the 

dictionary. Set Expressions present a special case 
for metaphor analysis as semantically inseparable 
units with various degree of internal semantic 

motivation. The dictionary definition of a Set 
Expression in annotation is recorded as its 

contextual meaning. 

Figure 5: Камнем преткновения стал вопрос: 
сколько же колес должно крутиться от 

мотора? [The following question has become the 
stumbling block: how many wheels should be 

rotated by the engine?] 

The phrase "kamen' pretknoveniya" [stumbling 
block] in Figure 5 is a Set Expression whose 

contextual meaning is: Препятствие, 
затруднение [Hindrance, complication]. 

2.4.7 Proper Name 

The class of Proper Names, which was not present 
in the original version of MIPVU, was added to 

our tagset in order to offer a solution to the 
treatment of proper names in the shallow 
annotation. 

Proper names that have common nouns, 

adjectives etc. among their constituents are similar 

to Indirect Metaphors in that the contextual 
meaning contrasts the basic meaning; the 

difference is that the contextual meanings of 
proper names are normally not listed in 

dictionaries.  

In Figure 6, the noun "avtopilot" is the title of an 
automotive magazine, which is its contextual 

meaning. At the same time, the basic meaning of 
the corresponding common noun is that of a 

technical device: 

Contextual 

Meaning 

"avtopilot" 

 Basic Meaning 

"avtopilot" 

Название 
журнала об 

автомобилях 
[Title of an 

automotive 

magazine] 

� Устройство для 
автоматического 

управления 
летательным 

аппаратом [Device for 

automatic control of an 
aircraft] 

83



2.4.8 Direct Metaphor 

According to MIPVU, the contextual meaning of a 
Direct Metaphor is identical to its basic meaning 

(CM = BM), and they belong to a distinctly 
different conceptual domain than their immediate 

context (Steen et al., 2010). Direct Metaphors in 
our annotation scheme lie on the borderline of the 
shallow and the deep annotation, acting as a source 

of cross-domain mapping.  
Direct Metaphors may be introduced into the 

context either by means of signalling devices 

(metaphor flags, mFlags), or immediately, without 
any signalling devices (Steen et al, 2010). 

Figure 7: Если жизнь колес протекает 
гладко, как асфальт на автомагистрали, то 

достаточно и подключаемого полного привода. 

[If the life of the wheels flows smoothly like 

asphalt on a motorway, a part-time 4-wheel-drive 
system will do.].  

The phrase "kak asfalt na avtomagistrali" [like 

asphalt on a motorway] is a Direct Metaphor 

signalled by the Metaphor Flag (mFlag) "kak" 

[like]. The Metaphor Flag and the Direct Metaphor 
it introduces are connected by the relation 
"Marker". 

3. Deep annotation 

By deep annotation in our corpus we mean the 
annotation of conceptual metaphors. 

We think that the coverage of conceptual 
metaphor identification in a corpus and the 
objectivity of metaphor formulation can increase to 

some extent if these procedures rely on the shallow 
annotation of metaphor-related words. 

In a typical study of conceptual metaphor in 
discourse, annotators would a) go through a text 
and mark conceptual mappings, sources and targets 

when they feel there is a shift from one conceptual 

domain to another; b) assign the identified 

conceptual structure to a metaphor from a 
previously formulated list and label the Source and 
the Target; or they would formulate a new 

metaphor, Source, and Target, if they were not 

found in the list (e.g. Chudinov, 2001). 

When we take shallow annotation as the basis 
for conceptual metaphor identification, a 

substantial component of linguistic intuition 
remains, as step (a) basically does not change. 

However, the coverage is likely to increase, 

because annotators would examine each metaphor-
related word in the shallow annotation and assess 

their potential for triggering a conceptual mapping, 
which arises from the nature and extent of the 

contrast between the basic and the contextual 
meanings. 

The objectivity of assigning conceptual 

metaphors to the mappings may also be expected 
to increase, because definitions of metaphors 

would be based on the dictionary definitions of the 
basic and the contextual meanings of metaphor-
related words (MRWs). In our annotation, the 

inferred conceptual metaphors are recorded in the 
field "Possible Inferences" of the "Target" tag. 

We have described several most frequent 

scenarios of formulating MRW-based conceptual 

metaphors: 
1) if the Target is a non-metaphor-related 

word, the definition of the Target will be expressed 

by the contextual meaning of the non-metaphor-

related word; 

2) if the Target is an Indirect Metaphor, the 
definition of the Target will be expressed by the 
contextual meaning of the Indirect Metaphor; 

3) if the Source is an Indirect Metaphor, the 
definition of the Source will be expressed by the 

basic meaning of the Indirect Metaphor;  
4) if either the Source or the Target is a 

Proper Name, the definition of the Source or the 

Target will be expressed by the contextual 

meaning of the Proper Name; 

5) if either the Source or the Target is a Set 
Expression, the definition of the Source or the 
Target will be expressed by the contextual 

meaning of the Set Expression; 
6) if the Source is a Direct Metaphor, the 

definition of the Source will be expressed by the 
Direct Metaphor itself. 

For example, the noun "liniya" [line] in Figure 

3, which in itself is an Indirect Metaphor with the 
contextual meaning of "Direction or manner of 

action or thought" is the Target for mappings from 
the two Sources. The first is a participle of the verb 

"operet'sya" [to lean on smth], which is tagged as 
an Indirect Metaphor, as: 

Contextual 

Meaning 

"operet'sya" 

 Basic Meaning 

"operet'sya" 

Найти себе 
поддержку в ком-, 

� Прислониться к 
кому-, чему-л., 

84



 

Figure 8. Explicit Source, Implicit Target and mapping 

 

Figure 9. First- and second-order inferences 

чем-л.,

кем-, чем-л. в 

качестве опоры, 
поддержки. [To find 

help in smb/smth, to

support] 

налечь на кого-, 
что-л., перенося на 
него часть тяжести 

своего тела. [To 
lean against 

smb/smth, 
transferring part of 

your body weight 
onto that object] 

The second Source is the noun "podderzhka" 

[support], which is also an Indirect Metaphor:  

Contextual 

Meaning 

"podderzhka" 

 Basic Meaning 

"podderzhka" 

Помощь, 

содействие. 
[help, assistance] 

� То, что поддерживает, 

служит опорой чему-
л. [Smth that supports 

or holds the weight of 
smth] 

The following conceptual metaphor can be 

inferred from these mappings and from the 
underlying meanings of metaphor-related words: 

"Direction/manner of action/thought is something 
that uses support to lean on or to hold its weight". 

In some cases, not all the components of a 

conceptual metaphor may be present explicitly in 
the text; this happens when only the Source is 

expressed explicitly, while the Target and the 

mapping are implicit. The Implicit Target may be 
inferred either from the contextual meanings of the 

metaphor-related word(s) that express the Source, 
or from the topical framework of the context. 

We use the tag "Source implMap" to annotate 

the Source of Implicit Mapping. We also record 

the Implicit Target in a special text field of the 
"Source implMap" tag, as in Figures 8-9. 

Figure 8: Но классическая вискомуфта уже 

одной ногой стоит в могиле. [But the classic 
viscous coupling is standing with one foot in the 

grave]. "Odnoy nogoy stoit v mogile" [is standing 
with one foot in the grave] is a Set Expression 

whose contextual meaning is "To be nearing one's 
death". In the given context which speaks about the 
evolution of automotive technology, this phrase 

means "To come into disuse", which constitutes 
the Implicit Target (the Implicit Target is inferred 

from the topic of the context). The possible 
inference from the mapping of the explicit Source 
onto the Implicit Target may be worded as the 

following: "Coming into disuse is approaching 
one's death". 

When making inferences from Source/Target 
mappings we have often observed that the first-
order inferences that follow immediately from the 

metaphor-related words of the shallow level may 

logically entail further, second-order inferences 

which are also recorded in the field "Possible 
Inferences". 

Figure 9: (Заголовок статьи) Три стадии 

путинской политики: реанимация, прострация, 

революция. [(Editorial headline) The three stages 

of Putin's policy: life support, prostration, 
revolution.]  

"Reanimatsiya" [life support] is a Direct 

Metaphor with the basic meaning of "Actions 

intended to bring a person back to life from clinical 

death". At the same time, "reanimatsiya" is the 
Source of an Implicit Mapping, whose Implicit 

Target is expressed by the topic of the text, where

"life support" refers to Putin's policy during his 
first presidential term in 2000-2004. The possible 

first-order inference from this mapping is: "Putin's 
policy in the early 2000s is life support to Russia". 

The possible second-order inference is: "Russia 
during the early 2000s is a person in the state of 
clinical death". 

4 Conclusion 

The work presented in this paper has shown that:  

1) Introducing the classes of Set Expression and 
Proper Name has proved to be a viable solution 
for the insufficiency of instructions for idioms 
and proper names in the original version of 

MIPVU. 

2) The visualization functionalities of BRAT 
annotation tool allow elaborating and expanding 
the structure of Implicit Metaphor (relation 

"Coreference" to connect the antecedent and the 
anaphor); of Personification (source of 

personification (Personifier) connected with the 

target of personification (Personified) by the 
relation "Personification"); and of Direct 

Metaphor (Direct Metaphor connected with 
Metaphor Flag by the relation "Marker"). Cross-
domain mappings can be annotated as relations 

between the Source and the Target. 
3) BRAT annotation tool enables recording and 

storing the basic and the contextual meanings of 
metaphor-related words and the conceptual 
metaphors inferred from them. Implicit 

conceptual mappings can be annotated, where 
only the Source is expressed explicitly. 

4) Using multiple overlapping tags and relations 
visualized through BRAT helps reveal the 
complexity of the metaphoric structure of a text. 

5) The attempt to identify and formulate 
conceptual metaphors on the basis of the basic 

and contextual meanings of the underlying 
metaphor-related words tends to lead to 
increased coverage and more controlled 

metaphor formulation.
