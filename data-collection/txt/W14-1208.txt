Abstract
Good readability of text is important
to ensure efficiency in communication
and eliminate risks of misunderstanding.
Patent claims are an example of text whose
readability is often poor. In this paper,
we aim to improve claim readability by
a clearer presentation of its content. Our
approach consist in segmenting the origi-
nal claim content at two levels. First, an
entire claim is segmented to the compo-
nents of preamble, transitional phrase and
body, using a rule-based approach. Sec-
ond, a conditional random field is trained
to segment the components into clauses.
An alternative approach would have been
to modify the claim content which is, how-
ever, prone to also changing the mean-
ing of this legal text. For both segmen-
tation levels, we report results from sta-
tistical evaluation of segmentation perfor-
mance. In addition, a qualitative error
analysis was performed to understand the
problems underlying the clause segmenta-
tion task. Our accuracy in detecting the
beginning and end of preamble text is 1.00
and 0.97, respectively. For the transitional
phase, these numbers are 0.94 and 1.00
and for the body text, 1.00 and 1.00. Our
precision and recall in the clause segmen-
tation are 0.77 and 0.76, respectively. The
results give evidence for the feasibility of
automated claim and clause segmentation,
which may help not only inventors, re-
searchers, and other laypeople to under-
stand patents but also patent experts to
avoid future legal cost due to litigations.

1 Introduction

Clear language is important to ensure efficiency in
communication and eliminate risks of misunder-

standing. With written text, this clarity is mea-
sured by readability. In the last years, we have
witnessed an increasing amount work towards im-
proving text readability. In general, these efforts
focus on making general text easier to understand
to non-native speakers and people with special
needs, poor literacy, aphasia, dyslexia, or other
language deficits.

In this paper, we address making technical text
more readable to laypeople, defined as those with-
out professional or specialised knowledge in a
given field. Technical documentation as scientific
papers or legal contracts are two genres of writ-
ten text that are difficult to understand (Alberts
et al., 2011). An extreme example that takes the
worst from both these worlds is the claim section
of patent documents: it defines the boundaries of
the legal protection of the invention by describing
complex technical issues and using specific legal
jargon (Pressman, 2006). Moreover, due to inter-
national conventions, each patent claim must be
written into a single sentence. This leads to very
long sentences with complex syntactic structures
that are hard to read and comprehend not only for
laypeople but also for technical people who are not
trained to read patent claims.

As an example of other efforts with similar
goals to improve the readability of technical text to
laypeople, we mention the CLEF eHealth shared
tasks in 2013 and 2014 (Suominen et al., 2013).
However, instead of inventors, researchers, and
other claim readers, they target patients and their
next-of-kins by developing and evaluating tech-
nologies to improve the readability of clinical re-
ports and help them in finding further information
related to their condition in the Internet.

Some proposals have also been made in order to
improve claim readability, for example, by apply-
ing simplification, paraphrasing, and summarisa-
tion methods (see Section 2). However, these ap-
proaches modify the claim content. This increases

66



the risk of changing also the meaning, which is not
desirable in the context of patent claims and other
legal documents.

In this paper, we propose an alternative method
that focuses on clarifying the presentation of the
claim content rather than its modification. Since
readability strongly affects text comprehension
(Inui et al., 2003), the aim of this study is to make
the content of the patent claims more legible and
consequently make them easier to comprehend.

As the first steps towards this improved presen-
tation of the patent claims, we propose to segment
the original text. Our approach is data driven and
we perform the segmentation at two levels: first,
an entire claim is segmented into three compo-
nents (i.e., preamble, transition, and body text) and
second, the components are further segmented into
clauses. At the first level, we use a rule-based
method and at the second level, we apply a con-
ditional random field.

We evaluate segmentation performance statisti-
cally at both levels and in addition, we analyse er-
rors in clause segmentation qualitatively; because
our performance at the first level is almost perfect
(i.e., for detecting the beginning and end of the
preamble, the accuracy percentages are 100 and
97 and these numbers are 94 and 100 for the tran-
sition and 100 and 100 for the body text), we focus
on the errors at the second level alone. In com-
parison, we have the precision of 77 per cent and
recall of 76 per cent in clause segmentation. Even
though this performance at the second level is not
perfect, it is significantly better than the respec-
tive percentages of 41 and 29 (0.2 and 0.3) for a
baseline based on both punctuation and keywords
(punctuation only).

The rest of the paper is organised as follows:
Section 2 describes as background information
of this study includes an explanation about what
patent claims are, how to read them, and what kind
of related work exists on claim readability. Sec-
tion 3 outlines our materials and methods. Section
4 presents the experiments results and discussion.
Finally, conclusions and ideas for future work are
presented in Section 5.

2 Background

2.1 Patent claims

Patent documents have a predefined document
structure that consists of several sections, such as
the title, abstract, background of the invention, de-

[Toolholder]p, [comprising]t [a holder body with
an insert site at its forward end comprising a
bottom surface and at least one side wall where
there projects a pin from said bottom surface
upon which there is located an insert having
a central bore, a clamping wedge for wedging
engagement between a support surface of the
holder and an adjacent edge surface of said
insert and an actuating screw received in said
wedge whilst threadably engaged in a bore of
said holder, said support surface and said edge
surface are at least partially converging down-
wards said wedge clamp having distantly pro-
vided protrusions for abutment against the top
face and the edge surface of said insert, char-
acterised in that the wedge consists of a pair of
distantly provided first protrusions for abutment
against a top face of the insert, and a pair of
distantly provided second protrusions for abut-
ment against an adjacent edge surface]b.

scription of the drawings, and claims. As already
mentioned, the claims can be seen as the most im-
portant section as they define the scope of legal
protection of the invention. In most modern patent
laws, patent applications must have at least one
claim (Pressman, 2006).

The claims are written into a single sentence be-
cause of international conventions. Figure 1 pro-
vides an example claim.

Furthermore, a claim should be composed by, at
least, the following parts,

1. Preamble is an introduction, which describes
the class of the invention.

2. Transition is a phrase or linking word that re-
lates the preamble with the rest of the claim.
The expressions comprising, containing, in-
cluding, consisting of, wherein and charac-
terise in that are the most common transi-
tions.

3. Body text describes the invention and recites
its limitations.

We have also included an illustration of these
claim components in Figure 1.

Because a claim is a single sentence, special
punctuation conventions have been developed and
are being used by patent writers. Modern claims
follow a format where the preamble is separated

from the transition by a comma, the transition
from the body text by a colon, and each invention
element in the body text by a semicolon (Radack,
1995). Other specifications regarding punctua-
tion are the following text elaboration and element
combination conventions:

- A claim should contain a period only in
the end.

- A comma should be used in all natu-
ral pauses.

- The serial comma1 should be used to separate
the elements of a list.

- Dashes, quotes, parentheses, and abbrevia-
tions should be avoided.

Because a claim takes the form of a single sen-
tence, long sentences are common. Meanwhile,
in the general discourse (e.g., news articles) sen-
tences are composed of twenty to thirty words,
claim sentences with over a hundred words are
very frequent (see, e.g., Table 1 related to mate-
rials used in this paper). As a consequence, claims
usually contain several subordinate and coordi-
nate clauses, as they enable the aforementioned
elaboration and the combination of elements of
equal importance, respectively.

As claims are difficult to read and interpret, sev-
eral books and tutorials suggest how claims should
be read (Radack, 1995; Pressman, 2006). The first
step towards reading a claim is to identify its com-
ponents (i.e., preamble, transition, and body text).
Another suggestion is to identify and highlight the
different elements of the invention spelled out in
the body text of the claims.

1The serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma)
is the comma used mediately before a coordination con-
junction (e.g., CDs, DVDs, and magnetic tapes where the
last comma indicates that DVDs and magnetic tapes are
not mixed). http://oxforddictionaries.com (ac-
cessed 28 Feb, 2014)

The clear punctuation marks and lexical mark-
ers enable the claim component segmentation, as
suggested above. Moreover, the predominance
of intra-sentential syntactic structures (e.g., subor-
dinate and coordinate constructions) favours seg-
menting patent claims into clauses. These clauses
can then be presented as a sequence of segments
which is likely to improve claim readability.

2.2 Related work

So far, not many studies have addressed the prob-
lem of improving the readability of patents claims.
In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there
is no research that specifically targets the problem
of presenting the claims in a more readable lay-
out. Consequently, we focus on efforts devoted to
claim readability in general with an emphasis on
text segmentation.

We begin by discussing three studies that ad-
dress text simplification in patent claims. Note that
these approaches modify the claim content which
may also change their meaning. This is riskier in
the context of patent documents and other legal
text than our approach of clarifying the presen-
tation. Moreover, in order achieve a reasonable
performance, the methods of these studies require
sophisticated tools for discourse analysis and syn-
tactic parsing. Usually these tools also need to be
tailored to the genre of claim text.

First, a parsing methodology to simplify sen-
tences in US patent documents has been pro-
posed (Sheremetyeva, 2003). The resulting analy-
sis structure is a syntactic dependency tree and the
simplified sentences are generated based on the in-
termediate chunking structure of the parser. How-
ever, neither the tools used to simplify sentences
nor the resulting improvement in readability has
been formally measured.

Second, simplification of Japanese claim sen-
tences has been addressed through a rule-based
method (Shinmori et al., 2003). It identifies the
discourse structure of a claim using cue phrases
and lexico-syntactic patterns. Then it paraphrases
each discourse segment.

Third, a claim simplification method to para-
phrase and summarise text has been intro-
duced (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2009). It is multilin-
gual and consists of claim segmentation, corefer-
ence resolution, and discourse tree derivation. In
claim segmentation, a rule-based system is com-
pared to machine learning with the conclusion of

68



the former approach outperforming the latter. The
machine learning approach is, however, very sim-
ilar to the clause segmentation task described in
this paper. They differ in the features used to
characterized the clause boundaries and in eval-
uation. For the evaluation, these authors use the
cosine similarity to calculate a 1:1 term overlap
between the automated solution and gold standard
set whereas we assess whether a token is an accu-
rate segment boundary or not.

We continue by discussing a complementary
method to our approach of improving the read-
ability of claims through their clearer presentation
without modifying the text itself. This work by
Shinmori et al. (2012) is inspired by the fact that
claims must be understood in the light of the def-
initions provided in the description section of the
patents. It aims to enrich the content by aligning
claim phrases with relevant text from the descrip-
tion section. For the evaluation, the authors have
inspected 38 patent documents. The automated
method generates 35 alignments for these docu-
ments (i.e., twenty correct and fifteen false) and
misses only six. It would be interesting to test if
this alignment method and the claim segmentation
proposed in this paper complement each other.

We end by noting that the task of segmenting
claim phrases is similar to the task of detecting
phrase boundaries by Sang and Déjean (2001) in
the sense that the segments we want to identify are
intra-sentential. However, the peculiar syntactic
style of claims makes the phrase detection strate-
gies not applicable (see Ferraro (2012) for a de-
tailed study on the linguistic idiosyncrasy of patent
claims).

3 Materials and methods

In this paper, we performed statistical experiments
and qualitative error analyses related to two seg-
mentation tasks (see Figure 2):

1. Segmenting claims section to the components
for preamble, transition, and body text.

2. Segmenting each claim to subordinate and
coordinate clauses.

For Task 1, we developed a rule-based method
using the General Architecture for Text Engineer-
ing (GATE) (Cunningham et al., 2011). The sys-
tem had three rules, one for each of the claim parts
we were interested in identifying. The rules were

Table 2: Dataset demographics

# claims # segments # words
Training set 811 4397 48939
Development set 10 15 260
Test set 80 491 5517

written in terms of JAPE grammars.2 In order to
process the rules, the GATE pipeline illustrated in
Figure 3 was applied. Because transitions should
match with the first instance of a closed set of key-
words (we used comprise, consist, wherein, char-
acterize, include, have, and contain), our first rule
identified a transition and, using its boundary in-
dices, we restricted the application of our further
rules. This resulted in the following application
order:

transition −→ preamble −→ body text.
Our two other rules relied on lexico-syntactic

patterns and punctuation marks. Note that even
though punctuation conventions have been devel-
oped for claim writing (see Section 2.1), their fol-
lowing is not mandatory. This led us to experi-
ment these more complex rules. The first task was
applied to the complete dataset (training, develop-
ment, and test sets merged into one single dataset)
described in Table 2.

For Task 2, our method was based on supervised
machine learning (ML). To train this ML classi-
fier, we used a patent claim corpus annotated with
clause boundaries. This corpus was provided by
the TALN Research Group from Universitat Pom-
peu Fabra. The aim of the segmentation classifier
was to decide whether a claim token is a segment
boundary or not, given a context. Thus, every to-
ken was seen as a candidate for placing a segment
boundary. Following standard ML traditions, we
split the dataset in training, development, and test
sets (Tables 2 and 1).

The corpus was analysed with a transitional3

version of Bohnet’s parser (Bohnet and Kuhn,
2012). It was one of the best parsers in the CoNLL
Shared Task 2009 (Hajič et al., 2009).

2JAPE, a component of GATE, is a finite state transducer
that operates over annotations based on regular expressions.

3Patent claim sentences can be very long which im-
plies long-distance dependencies. Therefore, transition-
based parsers, which typically have a linear or quadratic com-
plexity (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Attardi, 2006), are better
suited for parsing patent sentences than graph-based parsers,
which usually have a cubic complexity.

In order to characterise the clause boundaries,
the following features were used for each token in
the corpus:

- lemma of the current token,

- part-of-speech (POS) tag4 of the current to-
ken as well as POS-tags of the two immedi-
ately preceding and two immediately subse-
quent words,

- syntactic head and dependent of the current
token, and

- syntactic dependency relation between the
current token and its head and dependent to-
kens.

Moreover, the fifteen most frequent lemmas and
five most frequent POS-tags and punctuation
marks were used as features we called segmenta-
tion keywords (Table 3).

For classification we used the CRF++ toolkit,
an open source implementation of conditional ran-
dom fields (Lafferty et al., 2001). This framework
for building probabilistic graphical models to seg-
ment and label sequence data has been success-
fully applied to solve chunking (Sha and Pereira,

ple; WRB = Wh-adverb.

other sequential labelling problems. We compared
the results obtained by CRF++ with the following
baselines:

ment boundary, and

word is a segment boundary.

Performance in Task 1 was assessed using the
accuracy. Due to the lack of a corpus anno-
tated with claims components, we selected twenty
claims randomly and performed the annotation
ourselves (i.e., one of the authors annotated the
claims). The annotator was asked to assess
whether the beginning and ending of a claim com-
ponent was successfully identified.

Performance in Task 2 was evaluated using the
precision, recall, and F-score on the test set. We
considered that clause segmentation is a precision
oriented task, meaning that we emphasised the de-
mand for a high precision at the expense of a pos-
sibly more modest recall.

In order to better understand errors in clause
segmentation, we analysed errors qualitatively us-
ing content analysis (Stemler, 2001). This method
is commonly used in evaluation of language tech-
nologies. Fifty segmentation errors were ran-
domly selected and manually analysed by one of
the authors.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Statistical performance evaluation in
Tasks 1 and 2

We achieved a substantial accuracy in Task 1,
claim component segmentation (Table 4). That
is, the resulting segmentation was almost perfect.
This was not surprising since we were processing
simple and well defined types of segments. How-
ever, there was a small mismatch in the bound-
ary identification for the preamble and the transi-
tion segments.

Our ML method clearly outperformed both its
baselines in Task 2 (Table 5). It had the precision
of 77 per cent and recall of 76 per cent in clause
segmentation. The respective percentages were 41
and 29 for the baseline based on both punctuation
and keywords. If punctuation was used alone, both
the precision and recall were almost zero.

Baseline 1 0.2% 0.3% 2.6%
Baseline 2 41% 29% 34%
CRF++ 77% 76% 76%

4.2 Qualitative analysis of errors in Task 2

The most common errors in clause segmentation
were due to two reasons: first, ambiguity in co-
ordinating conjunctions (e.g., commas as wll as
and, or, and other particles) and second, consec-
utive segmentation keywords.

Segmentation errors caused by ambiguous coor-
dinating conjunctions were due to the fact that not
all of them were used as segment delimiters. Let
us illustrate this with the following automatically
segmented claim fragment with two coordinating
conjunctions (a segment is a string between square
brackets, the integer sub-script indicating the seg-
ment number, and the conjunctions in italics):

. . . [said blade advancing member comprises a worm
rotatable by detachable handle]1 [or key]2 [and meshin-
georm wheel secured to a shift]3 . . .

In this example, the two conjunctions were con-
sidered as segment delimiters which resulted in
an incorrect segmentation. The correct analysis
would have been to maintain the fragment as a sin-
gle segment since simple noun phrases are not an-
notated as individual segments in our corpus.

Segmentation errors due to consecutive seg-
mentation keywords resulted in undesirable seg-
ments only once in our set of fifty cases. This hap-
pened because the classifier segmented every en-
counter with a segmentation keyword, even when
the keywords were consecutive. We illustrate this
case with the following example, which contains
two consecutive keywords, a verb in past partici-
ple (selected) and a subordinate conjunction (for).
Example (a) shows a wrong segmentation, while
example (b) shows its correct segmentation.

. . . (a) [said tool to be]1 [selected]2 [for the next work-
ing operation]3 . . .

. . . (b) [said tool to be selected]1 [for working]2 . . .

In general, correcting both these error types
should be relatively straightforward. First, to solve
the problem of ambiguous commas, a possible so-
lution could be to constrain their application as
keywords, for example, by combining commas

71



with other context features. Second, segmentation
errors caused by consecutive segmentation key-
words could be solved, for example, by applying a
set of correction rules after the segmentation algo-
rithm (Tjong and Sang, 2001).

5 Conclusion and future work

In this paper we have presented our on-going re-
search on claim readability. We have proposed a
method that focuses on presenting the claims in
a clearer way rather than modifying their text con-
tent. This claim clarity is an important characteris-
tic for inventors, researchers, and other laypeople.
It may also be useful for patent experts, because
clear clauses may help them to avoid future legal
cost due to litigations. Moreover, better capabili-
ties to understand patent documents contribute to
democratisation of the invention and, therefore, to
human knowledge.

For future work, we plan to conduct a user-
centered evaluation study on claim readability. We
wish to ask laypeople and patents experts to as-
sess the usability and usefulness of our approach.
Furthermore, we plan to consider text highlight-
ing, terminology linking to definitions, and other
content enrichment functionalities as ways of im-
proving claim readability.
