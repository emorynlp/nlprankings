Abstract

This paper presents the first attempt to
semi-automatically translate SNOMED
CT (Systematized Nomenclature of
Medicine – Clinical Terms) terminology
content to Basque, a less resourced lan-
guage. Thus, it would be possible to build
a new clinical healthcare terminology for
Basque. We have designed the translation
algorithm and the first two phases of the
algorithm that feed the SNOMED CT’s
Terminology content, have been imple-
mented (it is composed of four phases).
The goal of the translation is twofold: the
enforcement of the use of Basque in the
bio-sanitary area and the access to a rich
multilingual resource in our language.

1 Introduction

SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT)
(IHTSDO, 2014) is considered the most com-
prehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare
terminology in the world. The use of a standard
clinical terminology improves the quality and
health care by enabling consistent representation
of meaning in an electronic health record1.

Osakidetza, the Basque Sanitary System ought
to provide its service in the two co-official lan-
guages of the Basque Autonomous Community,
in Spanish and in Basque. However, and being
Basque a minority language in front of the power-
ful Spanish language, the use of Basque in the doc-
umentation services (for example in the Electronic
Medical Records (EMR)) of Osakidetza, is almost
zero. One of our goals in this work is to offer a
medical terminology in Basque to the bio-medical
personnel to try to enforce the use of Basque in
the bio-sanitary area and in this way protect the

1http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/whysnomedct/
snomedfeatures/

linguistic rights of patients and doctors. Another
objective in this work is to be able to access multi-
lingual medical resources in Basque language. To
try to reach the mentioned objectives, we want to
semi-automatically translate the terminology con-
tent of SNOMED CT focusing in some of its main
hierarchies.

To achieve our translation goal, we have defined
an algorithm that is based on Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques and that is composed
of four phases. In this paper we show the systems
and results obtained when developing the first two
phases of the algorithm that, in this case, trans-
lates English terms into Basque. The first phase
of the algorithm is based on the use of multilin-
gual lexical resources, while the second one uses
a finite-state approach to obtain Basque equivalent
terms using medical affixes and also transcription
rules.

In this paper we will leave aside explanations
about i) the translation application, ii) the knowl-
edge management and iii) the knowledge repre-
sentation, and we will focus on term generation.
The application framework that manages the terms
has been already developed and it is in use. The
knowledge representation schema has been de-
signed and implemented and it is also being used
(Perez-de-Viñaspre and Oronoz, 2013).

In the rest of the paper after motivating the work
and connecting it to other SNOMED CT transla-
tions (sections 2 and 3), the algorithm and the ma-
terial that are needed to implement the first two
phases of the translation-algorithm are described
(section 4). After that, results are shown and dis-
cussed (sections 5 and 6). Finally, some conclu-
sions and future work are listed in the last section
(section 7).

2 Background and significance

“Basque is the ancestral language of the Basque
people, who inhabit the Basque Country, a region

38



spanning an area in northeastern Spain and south-
western France. It is spoken by 27% of Basques in
all territories (714,136 out of 2,648,998). Of these,
663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque
country (Basque Country and Navarre) and the re-
maining 51,100 live in the French part (Pyrénées-
Atlantiques)2”. Basque is a minority language in
its standardization process and persists between
two powerful languages, Spanish and French. Al-
though today Basque holds co-official language
status in the Basque Autonomous Community,
during centuries Basque was not an official lan-
guage; it was out of educational systems, out of
media, and out of industrial environments. Due to
this features, the use of the Basque Language in
the bio-sanitary system is low. One of the reasons
for translating SNOMED CT is to try to increase
the use of the Basque language in this area.

SNOMED CT is a multilingual resource as its
concepts are linked to terms in different languages
by means of a concept identifier. Thus, terms in
our language will be linked to terms in all the lan-
guages in which SNOMED CT is released. Be-
sides, as SNOMED CT is part of the Metathe-
saurus of UMLS (Unified Medical Language Sys-
tem (Bodenreider, 2004)), Basque speakers will
have the possibility of accessing other lexical med-
ical resources (RxNorm, MeSH) containing the
concepts of SNOMED CT.

SNOMED CT has been already translated to
other languages using different techniques. These
translations were done either manually (this is the
case of the Danish language (Petersen, 2011)),
combining automatic translation with manual
work (in Chinese, for example (Zhu et al., 2012)),
or using exclusively an automatic translation help-
ing system (that is the case of French (Abdoune et
al., 2011)). In the design of the translation task,
we have followed the guidelines for the transla-
tion of SNOMED CT (Høy, 2010) published by
the IHTSDO as it is recommended.

3 SNOMED CT

SNOMED CT provides the core terminology for
electronic health records and contains more than
296,000 active concepts with their descriptions or-
ganized into hierarchies. (Humphreys et al., 1997)
shows that SNOMED CT has an acceptable cov-
erage of the terminology needed to record patient

2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque language (January
23, 2014)

conditions. Concepts are defined by means of de-
scription logic axioms and are used also to group
terms with the same meaning. Those descriptions
are more generally considered as terms.

There are three types of descriptions in
SNOMED CT: Fully Specified Names (FSN), Pre-
ferred Terms (PT) and Synonyms. Fully Speci-
fied Names are the descriptions used to identify
the concepts and they usually have a semantic tag
in parenthesis that indicates its semantic type and,
consequently, its hierarchy. Regarding what we
sometimes refer to as “terms” we can distinguish
between PTs and Synonyms.

There are 19 hierarchies to organize the con-
tent of SNOMED CT (plus 1 hierarchy for meta-
data). The concepts of SNOMED CT are grouped
into hierarchies as Clinical finding/disorder, Or-
ganism, and so on. For translation purposes it is
important to deeply analyze these hierarchies as
some of them need to translate all the terms while
others as Organism only admit the translation of
the synonyms (the preferred term should be the
taxonomic one). The guidelines for the transla-
tion of the hierarchies are given in (Høy, 2010).
We want to remark that only the terms classified
as PTs and synonyms in SNOMED CT have been
taken into consideration for the translation pur-
poses, as the structure (relationships, for example)
is the ontological core of SNOMED CT.

Considering the lexical resources available in
the bio-sanitary domain for Basque and the
SNOMED CT language versions released, two
source languages can be used for our translation
task: English and Spanish. Basque is classified as
a language isolate, and in consequence it is not re-
lated to English or Spanish and its linguistic char-
acteristics are far away from both of them. For that
reason, no English nor Spanish offers any advan-
tage as translation source. Thus, we deeply ana-
lyzed both of them to choose the best option. Our
starting point was the Release Format 2 (RF2),
Snapshot distributions and the versions dated the
31-07-2012 for English and the 30-10-2012 for
Spanish. It must be taken into consideration that
the Spanish version of SNOMED CT is a manual
translation of the English version.

To choose the source version of SNOMED CT
that will be translated, we analyzed aspects as i)
general numbers of FSNs, PTs and Synonyms, ii)
length of the terms in each language and, ii) the
lack of elements in each version. These data help

39



us to come to a decision:

1. The number of active concepts in both lan-
guages is the same (296,433) as the Spanish
version uses the English concept file. Nev-
ertheless, the number of terms in Spanish is
significantly smaller. In Spanish 15,715 con-
cepts lack of PTs and Synonyms.

2. Regarding the length of the PTs and syn-
onyms, we counted the terms containing one
token, two tokens, three tokens, four tokens
and those with more than four tokens. In the
English version the 6.76% of the terms has
one token, the 23.28% two and the 20.70%
three tokens. That is, quite simple terms com-
pose the half of the synonyms in the lexicon.
In the Spanish version, nevertheless, only the
33.79% of the synonyms has three tokens or
less, and there are 66.21% synonyms with
four tokens or more.

Considering these data, we can conclude that i)
the English version is more complete and consis-
tent than the Spanish one, and that ii) the terms
in the English version are shorter in length and, in
consequence, simpler to translate than the ones in
the Spanish version. Thus, we decided to use the
English version of SNOMED CT as the translation
source as starting point.

We fix the priority between hierarchies for the
translation taking into account the number of
terms in each hierarchy. The most populated hi-
erarchies are Clinical finding/disorder (139,643
concepts) and Procedure (75,078 concepts). The
next most populated hierarchies are Organism
(35,870 concepts) and Body Structure (26,960).
The translation guidelines indicate that the PTs
of the organisms should not be translated. For
this reason and being conscious of our limita-
tion to translate this huge terminology, we decided
to prioritize the translation of the Clinical find-
ing/disorder, the Procedure and the Body Struc-
ture hierarchies.

4 Translation Algorithm

We have defined a general algorithm that tries to
achieve the translation with an incremental ap-
proach. Although the design is general and the al-
gorithm could be used for any language pair, some
linguistic resources for the source and objective
languages are necessary. In our implementation,

the algorithm takes a term in English as input and
obtains one or more equivalent terms in Basque.

The mapping of SNOMED CT with ICD-10
works at concept level. Thus, before executing the
implementation of the algorithm the mapping be-
tween them should be done (see section 5).

The algorithm is composed of four main phases.
The first two phases are already developed and re-
sults regarding quantities are given in section 5.
The last two phases will be undertaken in the very
near future.

We want to remark that all the processes fin-
ish in the step numbered as 4 in the algorithm
(see Figure 1). The Basque equivalents with their
original English terms, and relative information
(for instance, the SNOMED CT concept identi-
fier) are stored in an XML document that follows
the TermBase eXchange (TBX) (Melby, 2012) in-
ternational standard (ISO 30042) as exposed in
(Perez-de-Viñaspre and Oronoz, 2013). All the
lexical resources are stored in another simpler
TBX document called ItzulDB (see number 1 in
Figure 1). This document is initialized with all
the lexical resources available, such as specialized
dictionaries and it is enriched with the new trans-
lation pairs generated that overcome a confidence
threshold with the intention of using them to trans-
late new terms. In this way we achieve feedback.

Let us describe the main phases:

1. Lexical knowledge. In this phase of the al-
gorithm (see numbers 1-2-4 in Figure 1),
some specialized dictionaries and the En-
glish, Spanish and Basque versions of the In-
ternational Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Related Health in its 10th ver-
sion (ICD-10) are used. ItzulDB is initial-
ized with all the translation pairs (English-
Basque) extracted from different dictionaries
of the bio-medical domain and the pairs ex-
tracted from the ICD-10. For example the in-
put term “abortus” will be stored with all its
Basque equivalents “abortu”, “abortatze”
and “hilaurtze”. This XML database is en-
riched with the new elements that are gener-
ated when the algorithm is applied (number 4
in Figure 1). Figure 2 shows an example of
some translations obtained using ItzulDB.

2. Morphosemantics. When a simple term (term
with a unique token) is not found in ItzulDB
(number 3 in Figure 1) it is analyzed at word-
level, and some generation-rules are used to

create the translation. We apply medical suf-
fix and prefix equivalences and morphotactic
rules, as well as some transcription rules, for
this purpose. This is the case in Figure 3.

3. Shallow Syntax. In the case that the input
term does not appear in ItzulDB and it can
not be generated by word-level rules (number
8 in the algorithm), chunk-level generation
rules are used. Our hypothesis is that some
chunks of the term will appear in ItzulDB
with their translation. The application should
generate the entire term using the translated
components (see example in Figure 4).

2nd chunk: sample
Basque: lagin

Translation: Azido desoxirribonukleikoaren
lagin, ADN lagin, DNA lagin

Figure 4: Terms obtained using chunk-level gen-
eration rules.

4. Machine Translation. In the last phase, our
aim is to use a rule-based automatic trans-
lation system called Matxin (Mayor et al.,
2011) that we want to adapt to the medical
domain. Figure 5 shows an attempt of trans-
lation with the non adapted translator. For ex-
ample, Matxin translates “colon” as the punc-
tuation mark (“bi puntu” or “:”) because it
lacks the anatomical meaning.

and interposition of colon
Steps in Figure 1 number: 12, 4
Translation: Esofagoaren zati baten exci-
siona eta interpositiona bi puntua

Figure 5: Terms obtained using Matxin.

The IHTSDO organization releases a semi-
automatic mapping between SNOMED CT and
the ICD-10. By identifying the sense of a con-
cept in SNOMED CT, the best semantic space in
the ICD-10 for this concept is searched obtaining
linked codes. In this way we can obtain the corre-
sponding Basque term for some of the SNOMED
CT concepts through ICD-10. Considering that
the structures of SNOMED CT and the ICD-10
are quite different, and that the mapping some-
times has “mapping conditions”, the use of this

41



resource has been complex, but fruitful for very
specialised terms. Although as we said this map-
ping is the unique source for obtaining very spe-
cialised terms, it should be used carefully as the
objectives of SNOMED CT and ICD-10 are dif-
ferent. ICD-10 has classification purposes while
SNOMED CT has representation purposes.

A brief description of the first two phases of the
algorithm is done in the next subsections (subsec-
tions 4.1 and 4.2):

4.1 Phase 1: Lexical Resources
The multilingual specialized dictionaries with En-
glish and Basque equivalences that have been used
to enrich ItzulDB in the first phase of the algorithm
are:

• ZT Dictionary3: This is a dictionary about
science and technology that contains areas
as medicine, biochemistry, biology. . . It con-
tains 13,764 English-Basque equivalences.

• Nursing Dictionary4: It has 5,393 entries in
the English-Basque chapter.

• Glossary of Anatomy: It contains anatomi-
cal terminology (2,578 useful entries) used
by University experts in their lectures.

• ICD-105: This classification of diseases was
translated into Basque in 1996. It is also
available in English and in Spanish. The
mapping between the different language edi-
tions conforming a little dictionary, allowed
us to obtain 7,061 equivalences between En-
glish and Basque.

• EuskalTerm6: This terminology bank con-
tains 75,860 entries from wich 26,597 term
equivalences are labeled as from the biomed-
ical domain.

• Elhuyar Dictionary7: This English-Basque
dictionary, is a general dictionary that con-
tains 39,164 equivalences from English to
Basque.

All these quite different dictionaries have been
preprocessed in order to initialize ItzulDB. Elhu-
yar Dictionary is a general dictionary that has

7http://hiztegiak.elhuyar.org/en

both not domains pairs but also contains some spe-
cialized terminology. This general dictionary will
help i) in the translation of not domain terms and
ii) also in the translation of the chunks in Phase
3, and thus, on the generation of new terms in
Basque.

4.2 Phase 2: Finite State Transducers and
Biomedical Affixes

A first approach to this work is presented in
(Perez-de-Viñaspre et al., 2013). In that work, fi-
nite state transducers described in Foma (Hulden,
2009) are used to automatically identify the affixes
in English Medical terms and by means of affix
translation pairs, to generate the equivalent terms
in Basque. We observed that the behavior of the
roots in this type of words is similar to prefixes, so,
we will not make distinction between them and we
will name them prefixes. A list of 826 prefixes and
143 suffixes with medical meanings was manually
translated. An evaluation of the system was per-
formed in a Gold Standard of 885 English-Basque
pairs. The Gold Standard was composed of the
simple terms that were previously translated in the
first phase of the algorithm. A precision of 93%
and a recall of 41% were obtained.

In that occasion, only SNOMED CT terms for
which all the prefixes and suffixes were identified
were translated. For example, terms with the pref-
fix “phat” were not translated as this affix does
not appear in the prefixes and suffixes list. For
instance, the “hypophosphatemia” term was not
translated even though the “hypo”, “phos” and
“emia” affixes were identified.

We have improved this work by increasing the
number of affixes and implementing transcription
rules from English/Latin/Greek to Basque.

Figure 6 will help us to get a wider view of
the work exposed. The input term “symphys-
iolysis” is split into the possible affix combi-
nation in the first step (“sym+physio+lysis” or
“sym+physi+o+lysis”). Then, those affixes are
translated by means of its equivalents in Basque
(“sim+fisio+lisi” or “sim+fisi+o+lisi”). And fi-
nally, by means of morphotactic rules, the well-
formed Basque term is composed (in both cases
“sinfisiolisi” is generated).

cess easy to handle, we have divided it into hier-
archies. The Clinical finding/disorder hierarchy is
specially populated so we have split it consider-
ing its semantic tags: disorders and findings. In
addition, the terms from the Procedure and Body
Structure hierarchies have been evaluated too.

Before showing the results, we want to remark
some aspects of the evaluation:

• Phase 1: the evaluation has been performed
in terms of quantity, not of quality of the
equivalent terms obtained. As the used re-
sources are dictionaries manually generated
by lexicographers and domain experts, the
quality of the Basque terms is assumed. In
any case, and due to the fact that Basque is in
its standardization process, the orthographic
correctness of the descriptions (see section 6)
will be manually checked in the near future.

• Phase 2: the quality of the generated terms
could be measured extrapolating the results
in the evaluation of the baseline system de-
scribed in subsection 4.2. That is, 93% pre-
cision and 41% recall. The quantity results
are shown considering the improvements de-
scribed in the same subsection.

Table 1 shows the results for the mentioned hi-
erarchies and semantic tags when the translation is

performed using both methods: dictionary match-
ing and morphosemantics. Remind that in a pre-
vious phase a concept level mapping is completed
between SNOMED CT and ICD-10. The first row
in Table 1 labeled as “ICD-10 mapping” shows
that it is relevant only for the Clinical disorders
and findings hierarchy, being the disorder seman-
tic tag the most benefited one with 11,228 equiv-
alences. The remainder of the results is given at
term level.

We made a distinction between the number of
obtained Basque terms (1st column, labeled as
“#Synonyms”) and the number of English terms
translated (2nd column, labeled as “#Matches”).
Let us see the difference between those two
columns looking at the numbers in Table 1. For ex-
ample, in the disorder semantic tag there are 3,488
matches (3,488 original English terms translated),
but the number of obtained Basque terms is 4,804
(adding the number of equivalents of all the dic-
tionaries). The reason is that the same input term
may have synonyms or even the same equivalent
term given by different dictionaries. For example,
for the term “allopathy”, the same term “alopatia”
is obtained in the ZT and Nursing dictionaries (this
equivalence will be counted in both ZT and Nurs-
ing dictionaries rows).

Table 2 shows the number of tokens in the origi-
nal English terms. This table refers not to the con-
cepts, but to the terms in the source SNOMED CT
in English. The first row shows the number of En-
glish terms to which we obtained a Basque equiv-
alent or synonym, the second one the total of En-
glish terms and finally, the last row the percentage
of translated terms.

Table 3 gives the overall numbers of the trans-
lated concepts, in order to take a wide view of the
process done.

Let us see the highlights of the results for each

hierarchy or semantic tag:

• 21.60% of the disorders has been translated
(see Table 3). This can be considered a very
good result. The ICD-10 mapping produces
the majority of the translations as it could be
expected in this hierarchy (11,227 synonyms
obtained). In Table 2 the strength of the mor-
phosemantics phase is evident as the 81.53%
of the simple terms is translated.

• The finding semantic tag is the most bal-
anced, as no one of the algorithm phase’s
contribution outlines. The translation of the
8.36% of the concepts is achieved.

• Regarding the results of the Body Structure
hierarchy, Table 1 shows that the Glossary of
Anatomy only contributes in this area. The
10.39% of the concepts get a Basque equiva-
lent.

• In the translation of the Procedure hierarchy
the dictionaries do not help much as shown
in Table 1. In contrast, the mophosemantics
contribution allows to translate the 87.84% of
the simple terms (see Table 2).

6 Discussion

Some general dictionaries as the ZT dictionary
usually contribute in the translation of most of the
terms, while more specialized dictionaries only
provide translations in the terms related to their

domain. For example, both dictionaries, the ZT
dictionary and the Nursing dictionary, obtained the
Basque terms “mikrozefalia” for “microcephaly”
and “metatartso” for “metatarsus”. The ICD-10
mapping contributed mainly in the translation of
the disorders, and the Glossary of Anatomy in the
translation of terms from the Body Structure hi-
erarchy. Sometimes more than an equivalent in
Basque is obtained in the translation. For exam-
ple, for the term “leprosy” we got the equivalents
“legen beltz”, “legen” and “legenar”. Some prob-
lems were detected in the Basque terms regarding
the standard orthography (the ICD-10 was trans-
lated in 1996 and the spelling rules have changed
since then) and the form of the word (some obtain
the word in finite forms, i.e. “abdomena” for “ab-
domen” and other in non finite form, “abdomen”).

To which the terms generated by finite-state
transducers concern, we detected many new af-
fixes from the SNOMED CT terms that do not ap-
pear in our lexicon. Even most of those affixes
will be correctly transcripted by our transducers,
experts insist on enriching the lexicon with new
pairs.

7 Conclusions

We have designed a translation algorithm for the
multilingual terminology content of SNOMED CT
and we have implemented the first two phases. On
the one hand, lexical resources feed our database,
and on the other hand, Basque equivalents are gen-
erated using transducers and medical and biologi-

44



cal affixes.
Dictionaries provide Basque equivalents of any

term length (i.e. unique and multitoken terms)
while transducers get as input unique token terms.

In both translation methods results for the most
populated hierarchies are shown even though they
are applied for all the hierarchies in SNOMED CT.
When using lexical resources, results are promis-
ing and the contribution of the ICD-10 mapping
is remarkable. We obtained the equivalents in
Basque of 21.60% of the disorders.

In any case, as we said before, our objective in
the future is that specialist in medical terminol-
ogy can check the quality of the obtained terms
and correct them with the help of a domain cor-
pus in Basque. A platform is being developed for
this purpose. After the evaluation, and only if it
reaches high quality results, our aim is to contact
SNOMED CT providers to offer them the result of
our work, that at the moment only pertains to the
research area.

Regarding the developed systems evaluation,
the system used in the first phase extracts English-
Basque pairs from dictionaries, so being quite a
simple system, does not need of a deep evalua-
tion. A first evaluation of the system that generates
terms using medical affixes has been presented.
At present, we are evaluating the improvements of
this second system with promising results.

In a near future, we want to implement the re-
mainder of the phases in the algorithm: the use of
syntax rules for term generation, and the adapta-
tion of the machine translation tool. The promis-
ing results in this first approximation encourage us
in the way to semi-automatically generate a ver-
sion in Basque of SNOMED CT.
