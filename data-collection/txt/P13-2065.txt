Abstract
Current translation models are mainly de-
signed for languages with limited mor-
phology, which are not readily applicable
to agglutinative languages as the differ-
ence in the way lexical forms are gener-
ated. In this paper, we propose a nov-
el approach for translating agglutinative
languages by treating stems and affixes
differently. We employ stem as the atomic
translation unit to alleviate data spare-
ness. In addition, we associate each stem-
granularity translation rule with a distri-
bution of related affixes, and select desir-
able rules according to the similarity of
their affix distributions with given spans to
be translated. Experimental results show
that our approach significantly improves
the translation performance on tasks of
translating from three Turkic languages to
Chinese.

1 Introduction

Currently, most methods on statistical machine
translation (SMT) are developed for translation
of languages with limited morphology (e.g., En-
glish, Chinese). They assumed that word was the
atomic translation unit (ATU), always ignoring the
internal morphological structure of word. This
assumption can be traced back to the original
IBM word-based models (Brown et al., 1993) and
several significantly improved models, including
phrase-based (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al.,
2003), hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) and syntac-
tic (Quirk et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et
al., 2006) models. These improved models worked
well for translating languages like English with
large scale parallel corpora available.

Different from languages with limited morphol-
ogy, words of agglutinative languages are formed
mainly by concatenation of stems and affixes.
Generally, a stem can attach with several affixes,
thus leading to tens of hundreds of possible inflect-
ed variants of lexicons for a single stem. Modeling
each lexical form as a separate word will generate
high out-of-vocabulary rate for SMT. Theoretical-
ly, ways like morphological analysis and increas-
ing bilingual corpora could alleviate the problem
of data sparsity, but most agglutinative languages
are less-studied and suffer from the problem of
resource-scarceness. Therefore, previous research
mainly focused on the different inflected variants
of the same stem and made various transformation
of input by morphological analysis, such as (Lee,
2004; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Yang and
Kirchhoff, 2006; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Bisazza
and Federico, 2009; Wang et al., 2011). These
work still assume that the atomic translation unit
is word, stem or morpheme, without considering
the difference between stems and affixes.

In agglutinative languages, stem is the base
part of word not including inflectional affixes.
Affix, especially inflectional affix, indicates dif-
ferent grammatical categories such as tense, per-
son, number and case, etc., which is useful for
translation rule disambiguation. Therefore, we
employ stem as the atomic translation unit and
use affix information to guide translation rule
selection. Stem-granularity translation rules have
much larger coverage and can lower the OOV
rate. Affix based rule selection takes advantage
of auxiliary syntactic roles of affixes to make a
better rule selection. In this way, we can achieve
a balance between rule coverage and matching
accuracy, and ultimately improve the translation
performance.

2 Affix Based Rule Selection Model

Figure 1 (B) shows two translation rules along
with affix distributions. Here a translation rule
contains three parts: the source part (on stem lev-
el), the target part, and the related affix distribution
(represented as a vector). We can see that, al-
though the source part of the two translation rules
are identical, their affix distributions are quite
different. Affix “gha” in the first rule indicates
that something is affiliated to a subject, similar to
“of” in English. And “da” in second rule implies
location information. Therefore, given a span
“zunyi/STM yighin/STM+i/SUF+da/SUF+...” to
be translated, we hope to encourage our model to
select the second translation rule. We can achieve
this by calculating similarity between the affix
distributions of the translation rule and the span.

The affix distribution can be obtained by keep-
ing the related affixes for each rule instance during
translation rule extraction ((A) in Figure 1). After
extracting and scoring stem-granularity rules in a
traditional way, we extract stem-granularity rules
again by keeping affix information and compute
the affix distribution with tf-idf (Salton and Buck-
ley, 1987). Finally, the affix distribution will be
added to the previous stem-granularity rules.

2.1 Affix Distribution Estimation

Formally, translation rule instances with the same
source part can be treated as a document collec-
tion1, so each rule instance in the collection is

1We employ concepts from text classification to illustrate
how to estimate affix distribution.

some kind of document. Our goal is to classify the
source parts into the target parts on the document
collection level with the help of affix distribu-
tion. Accordingly, we employ vector space model
(VSM) to represent affix distribution of each rule
instance. In this model, the feature weights are
represented by the classic tf-idf (Salton and Buck-
ley, 1987):

tf i,j =
ni,j∑
k nk,j

idf i,j = log
|D|

|j : ai ∈ rj|
tfidf i,j = tf i,j × idf i,j

(1)

where tfidf i,j is the weight of affix ai in transla-
tion rule instance rj . ni,j indicates the number of
occurrence of affix ai in rj . |D| is the number
of rule instance with the same source part, and
|j : ai ∈ rj| is the number of rule instance which
contains affix ai within |D|.

Let’s take the suffix “gha” from (A1) in Figure
1 as an example. We assume that there are only
three instances of translation rules extracted from
parallel corpus ((A) in Figure 1). We can see that
“gha” only appear once in (A1) and also appear
once in whole instances. Therefore, tfgha,(A1) is
0.5 and idfgha,(A1) is log(3/2). tfidfgha,(A1) is
the product of tfgha,(A1) and idfgha,(A1) which
is 0.09.

Given a set of N translation rule instances with
the same source and target part, we define the
centroid vector dr according to the centroid-based
classification algorithm (Han and Karypis, 2000),

dr is the final affix distribution.
By comparing the similarity of affix distribu-

tions, we are able to decide whether a translation
rule is suitable for a span to be translated. In
this work, similarity is measured using the cosine
distance similarity metric, given by

sim(d1,d2) =
d1 · d2

∥d1∥ × ∥d2∥
(3)

where di corresponds to a vector indicating affix
distribution, and “·” denotes the inner product of
the two vectors.

Therefore, for a specific span to be translated,
we first analyze it to get the corresponding stem
sequence and related affix distribution represented
as a vector. Then the stem sequence is used to
search the translation rule table. If the source part
is matched, the similarity will be calculated for
each candidate translation rule by cosine similarity
(as in equation 3). Therefore, in addition to the
traditional translation features on stem level, our
model also adds the affix similarity score as a
dynamic feature into the log-linear model (Och
and Ney, 2002).

3 Related Work

Most previous work on agglutinative language
translation mainly focus on Turkish and Finnish.
Bisazza and Federico (2009) and Mermer and
Saraclar (2011) optimized morphological analysis
as a pre-processing step to improve the translation
between Turkish and English. Yeniterzi and Oflaz-
er (2010) mapped the syntax of the English side
to the morphology of the Turkish side with the
factored model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007). Yang

and Kirchhoff (2006) backed off surface form to
stem when translating OOV words of Finnish.
Luong and Kan (2010) and Luong et al. (2010)
focused on Finnish-English translation through
improving word alignment and enhancing phrase
table. These works still assumed that the atomic
translation unit is word, stem or morpheme, with-
out considering the difference between stems and
affixes.

There are also some work that employed the
context information to make a better choice of
translation rules (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et
al., 2007; He et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2010). all the
work employed rich context information, such as
POS, syntactic, etc., and experiments were mostly
done on less inflectional languages (i.e. Chinese,
English) and resourceful languages (i.e. Arabic).

4 Experiments

In this work, we conduct our experiments on
three different agglutinative languages, including
Uyghur, Kazakh and Kirghiz. All of them are
derived from Altaic language family, belonging to
Turkic languages, and mostly spoken by people in
Central Asia. There are about 24 million people
take these languages as mother tongue. All of
the tasks are derived from the evaluation of Chi-
na Workshop of Machine Translation (CWMT)2.
Table 1 shows the statistics of data sets.

For the language model, we use the SRI Lan-
guage Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train
a 5-gram model with the target side of training
corpus. And phrase-based Moses3 is used as our

optimized with MERT (Och, 2003) to maximum
word-level BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002).

4.1 Using Unsupervised Morphological
Analyzer

As most agglutinative languages are resource-
poor, we employ unsupervised learning method
to obtain the morphological structure. Follow-
ing the approach in (Virpioja et al., 2007), we
employ the Morfessor4 Categories-MAP algorith-
m (Creutz and Lagus, 2005). It applies a hierar-
chical model with three categories (prefix, stem,
and suffix) in an unsupervised way. From Table 1
we can see that vocabulary sizes of the three lan-
guages are reduced obviously after unsupervised
morphological analysis.

Table 2 shows the translation results. All the
three translation tasks achieve obvious improve-
ments with the proposed model, which always per-
forms better than only employ word, stem and
morph. For the Uyghur to Chinese translation
(UY-CH) task in Table 2, performances after unsu-
pervised morphological analysis are always better
than the baseline. And we gain up to +2.6 BLEU
points improvements with affix compared to the
baseline. For the Kazakh to Chinese translation
(KA-CH) task, the improvements are also signifi-
cant. We achieve +2.27 and +0.77 improvements
compared to the baseline and stem, respectively.
As for the Kirghiz to Chinese translation (KI-CH)
task, improvements seem relative small compared
to the other two language pairs. However, it also
gains +0.91 BLEU points over the baseline.

4.2 Using Supervised Morphological
Analyzer

Taking it further, we also want to see the effect of
supervised analysis on our model. A generative
statistical model of morphological analysis for
Uyghur was developed according to (Mairehaba
et al., 2012). Table 3 shows the difference of
statistics of training corpus after supervised and
unsupervised analysis. Supervised method gen-
erates fewer type of stems and affixes than the
unsupervised approach. As we can see from
Figure 2, except for the morph method, stem
and affix based approaches perform better after
supervised analysis. The results show that our
approach can obtain even better translation per-
formance if better morphological analyzers are
available. Supervised morphological analysis gen-
erates more meaningful morphemes, which lead to
better disambiguation of translation rules.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we propose a novel framework for
agglutinative language translation by treating stem
and affix differently. We employ the stem se-
quence as the main part for training and decod-
ing. Besides, we associate each stem-granularity
translation rule with an affix distribution, which
could be used to make better translation decisions
by calculating the affix distribution similarity be-

tween the rule and the instance to be translated.
We conduct our model on three different language
pairs, all of which substantially improved the
translation performance. The procedure is totally
language-independent, and we expect that other
language pairs could benefit from our approach.
