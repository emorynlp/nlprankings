Abstract

We develop a novel generative model of con-
versation that jointly captures both the top-
ical content and the speech act type asso-
ciated with each utterance. Our model ex-
presses both token emission and state tran-
sition probabilities as log-linear functions of
separate components corresponding to topics
and speech acts (and their interactions). We
apply this model to a dataset comprising anno-
tated patient-physician visits and show that the
proposed joint approach outperforms a base-
line univariate model.

1 Introduction

Communication involves at least two aspects: the
words one says and the acts one performs in saying
them. Examples of the latter include asking ques-
tions, issuing commands, and so on. These are re-
ferred to as speech acts under the sociolinguistic the-
ory of Austin (1955), which was further developed
by Searle (1969; 1985). Recognizing speech acts is
crucial to understanding communication because a
speaker’s meaning is only partially captured by the
words they use; much of their intent is expressed im-
plicitly via speech acts (Searle, 1969).

On this view, conversational utterances can be as-
signed both a topic and a speech act. The former
describes the subject matter of what was said and
the latter captures the “social act” (e.g., promising)
performed by saying it. For example, the utterance
“Obama won the election” is topically political and
is an example of an information giving speech act.
“Did Obama win the election?”, meanwhile, belongs

to the same topic but is a question. Both aspects are
necessary to understand conversation.

Previous computational work on speech acts –
which we review in Section 6 – has modeled them
in isolation (Perrault and Allen, 1980; Stolcke et al.,
1998; Stolcke et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2010), i.e.,
independent of topical content. But a richer model
would account for both speech acts and the contex-
tualizing topic of each utterance. To this end, we de-
velop a novel joint, generative model of topics and
speech acts.

We focus on physician-patient communication as
a motivating domain. This is of interest because

1765



it is widely appreciated that effective communica-
tion is an integral part of clinical practice (Irwin and
Richardson, 2006; Makoul, 2001; Teutsch, 2003).
We provide an excerpt of a conversation between a
patient and their doctor annotated with topics and
speech acts in Table 1. Such annotations can provide
substantive insights into how doctors communicate
with patients (Ong et al., 1995).

A concrete example of this is the use of topic
and speech act codes to assess the efficacy of an
intervention meant to influence physician-patient
communication regarding adherence to antiretrovi-
ral (ARV) medication (Wilson et al., 2010). To
measure the effect of the intervention, investigators
performed a randomized control trial in which they
quantified change in communication patterns by tal-
lying the number of information giving speech acts
that fell under the ARV adherence topic. Without
assigning both topics and speech acts to utterances,
this analysis would not have been possible.

In this work, we develop a novel component-
based generative model for bivariate, sequentially
structured problems. Our approach extends the re-
cently proposed Sparse Additive Generative (SAGE)
model (Eisenstein et al., 2011) and similar recently
developed additive models (Paul and Dredze, 2012;
Paul et al., 2013) to the case of supervised sequen-
tial tasks to capture the joint conditional influence
of topics and speech acts, both with respect to token
generation and state transitions. For brevity, we refer
to this generative Joint, Additive, Sequential model
as JAS. In contrast to previous work on speech acts,
JAS provides a single, coherent generative model of
conversations. And because it is component-based,
this model provides a flexible framework for analyz-
ing communication patterns. We demonstrate that
JAS outperforms a generative univariate baseline in
topic/speech act prediction. Further, we automati-
cally reproduce an analysis of the aforementioned
randomized control trial, and in doing so show that
JAS reproduces the results more faithfully than a
univariate approach.

2 The Markov-Multinomial Model

We begin by considering a baseline generative ap-
proach to modeling topics and speech acts indepen-
dently. This simple approach was used by Stolcke et

al. (2000) to model speech acts. It accounts for only
a single output at each time point yt ∈ Y , and hence
here we model topics and speech acts independently.

A straight-forward (albeit naı̈ve) alternative
would be to treat the Cartesian product of topics
and speech acts as a single output space on which
emissions and transitions are conditioned, but this
space is too large and sparse for this approach to be
practicable. We note that the fully coupled HMM
(Brand et al., 1997) suffers from a similar exponen-
tial output state problem. The related factorial HMM
(FHMM) (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997; Van Gael
et al., 2008), meanwhile, imposes unwarranted (in
our case) independence assumptions with respect to
state transitions along parallel chains, does not obvi-
ously lend itself to discrete observations (typically
Gaussians are assumed), and does not scale well
enough (in terms of training time) to be feasible for
our application.

The Markov-Multinomial (MM) comprises two
components; transitions and emissions. The former
is modeled by making a first-order Markov assump-
tion, specifically:

P (yt|y0, ..., yt−1) = P (yt|yt−1) = λyt−1,yt (1)

Emissions can be modeled via a multinomial
that captures the conditional probabilities of to-
kens given labels. Denoting an utterance (an utter-
ance comprises the words corresponding to a single
speech act; see Section 4) at time t by ut and its la-
bel by yt, and making the standard naı̈ve assumption
that words are generated independently conditioned
on a label, we have:

P (ut|yt) =
∏

w∈ut
P (w|yt) =

∏
w∈ut

τyt,w (2)

Both sets of parameters (the λ’s and the τ ’s) can be
estimated straight-forwardly using maximum like-
lihood (i.e., using observed counts). We can use
Viterbi decoding (Rabiner and Juang, 1986) to make
predictions for new sequences, as usual. To make
both topic and speech act predictions, we simply in-
duce models for each and make predictions indepen-
dently.

3 JAS: A Joint, Additive, Sequential Model

An obvious shortcoming of the simple MM model
outlined above is that it treats topics and speech acts

1766



as statistically independent. They are not (as con-
firmed at statistical significance p < .001 using a
χ2 test). One would prefer a more expressive model
that conditions topic and speech act transitions as
well as the production of utterances jointly on both
the current topic and the current speech act.

More specifically, we would like a model that re-
flects the assumption that some latent intent gives
rise to both the topic and the speech act associated
with an utterance. This is consistent with Searle’s
(1969) notion of perlocutionary effects; one per-
forms speech acts with the aim of getting someone
to do something. Intent gives rise to the current
topic and speech act, and the current intent affects
the next; this induces a correlation between adjacent
topics and speech acts. This conceptual model is de-
picted graphically in the left-half of Figure 1.

The latent intent may be, e.g., to encourage a pa-
tient to take their medication more regularly. In our
application the topical content may be ARV adher-
ence and the type of speech act would be selected
by the provider (presumably to maximize the likeli-
hood of patient adherence). For example, she may
opt to urge imperatively (“You really need to take
your medicine”) or to implore with a question (“Will
you please remember to take your medicine?”). Be-
cause we have no way of explicitly modeling intent
(it is never observed), we instead rely on variables
for which we have annotations (i.e., the topics and
speech acts; see Figure 1). We next describe the
model in more detail.

We refer to the topic set by Y , the speech act
set by S and the vocabulary as W . We denote the
(log of the) background probability of word w by
θw, and we will denote components corresponding
to deviations from θw due to a specific topic (speech
act) by ηyw (ηsw). Further, we include the component
ηy,sw to capture interaction effects between topics and
speech acts. We assume that the conditional proba-
bility of word w belonging to an utterance ut with
corresponding topic yt and speech act st is log-linear
with respect to these components, i.e.:

P (w|yt, st) =
1

Zw
exp{θw +ηytw +ηstw +ηst,ytw } (3)

Where Zw is a normalizing term (implicitly condi-

tioned on yt and st) defined as:

Zw =
∑

w′∈W
exp{θw′ + ηytw′ + η

st
w′ + η

st,yt
w′ } (4)

We make the standard naı̈ve assumption that words
are generated independently, given the topic and
speech act of the utterance to which they belong:

P (ut|yt, st) =
∏

w∈ut
P (w|yt, st) (5)

The per-token emission probability just described
falls under the additive generative family of models
recently proposed by Eisenstein et al. (2011). How-
ever, in addition to conditional token emission prob-
abilities, here we need also to model the transition
probabilities such that the likelihood of transition-
ing to topic yt (and to speech act st) reflects both the
previous topic and the previous speech act, captur-
ing the dependencies illustrated in Figure 1. To this
end, we model topic and speech act transition proba-
bilities as log-linear functions of the preceding topic
and speech act.

We denote log of the background topic frequen-
cies by πY , and components capturing the influence
of transitioning to topic yt due to the preceding topic
and speech act by σyt−1,yt and σst−1,yt respectively.
We also include a component σ(yt−1,st−1),yt that cor-
responds to the interaction effect on topic transi-
tion probability due to the preceding topic/speech
act pair. We then model the topic transition prob-
ability (given the preceding states) as:

P (yt|yt−1, st−1) =
1

Zy
exp{πYyt +σyt−1,yt +σst−1,yt +σ(yt−1,st−1),yt}

(6)
Where Zy is a normalizing term for the topic transi-
tions (implicitly conditioned on st−1, yt−1):

Zy =
∑
y′∈Y

exp{πYy′+σyt−1,y′+σst−1,y′+σ(yt−1,st−1),y′}

(7)
Similarly, denoting by πS log-transformed speech
act background frequencies, and including analo-
gous components as above that correspond to the in-
fluence of the preceding topic, speech act and their
interaction on transitioning into speech act st, we

have:

P (st|st−1, yt−1) =
1

Zs
exp{πSst +σst−1,st +σyt−1,st +σ(yt−1,st−1),st}

(8)

Where Zs is a normalizing constant for speech acts
analogous to Equation 7. Putting things together:

P (yt, st|st−1, yt−1, ut) =
P (ut|yt, st) · P (yt|yt−1, st−1) · P (st|st−1, yt−1)

(9)

As implied by Figure 1, this model assumes that the
topic and speech act at time t are conditionally in-
dependent given the preceding topic and speech act
(yt−1 and st−1). This is intuitively agreeable be-
cause time intervenes as a blocking factor; condi-
tioning the current topic on the current speech act
(or vice versa) would contradict the fact that these
occur simultaneously. Instead, the correlation is in-
duced by the preceding topic/speech act pair. (That
said, this is still a simplifying assumption, as one
may instead choose to model speech act selection as
conditional on topic (Traum and Larsson, 2003).)

Predictions can again be made via Viterbi de-
coding (Rabiner and Juang, 1986) over a matrix of
pairs of joint topic/speech act states. The strategy of
modeling (additive) components allows JAS to avoid
problems due to sparsity in this large output space.

Model parameters can be estimated using stan-
dard optimization techniques. We fix the ‘back-
ground’ frequencies θ, πY , πS to the log of the

corresponding observed proportions of words, top-
ics and speech acts, respectively. For the remaining
parameters, one can use descent-based optimization
methods. The partial derivative for the topic-to-topic
transition component σy,y′ with respect to the likeli-
hood, for example, is:

∂

∂σy,y′
=

∑
s∈S

C(y,s),y′ − P (y′|y, s)C(y,s),∗ (10)

Where C(y,s),y′ denotes the observed count of tran-
sitions from topic/speech act pair (y, s) to y′, and
C(y,s),∗ denotes the total number of observed transi-
tions out of this pair. The term P (y′|y, s) is with
respect to the current parameter estimates and is
defined in Equation 6. The partial derivatives for
the other component parameters (both transition and
emission) are analogous. We use a Newton opti-
mization method similar to the approach outlined by
Eisenstein et al. (2011).1 We assess convergence
by calculating predictive performance on a held-out
portion (5%) of the training dataset at each step,
halting the descent when this declines.

with Generalized Medical Interaction Anaylsis Sys-
tem (GMIAS) codes. The GMIAS has been used

patient communication about ARV adherence in the

context of an intervention trial (Wilson et al., 2010);
analyze communication about sexual risk behavior
(Laws et al., 2011a); elucidate the association of
visit length with constructs of patient-centeredness
(Laws et al., 2011b); and to describe provider-
patient communication regarding ARV adherence
compared with communication about other issues
(Laws et al., 2012). GMIAS annotation is described
at length elsewhere,2 but we summarize it here for
completeness.

GMIAS segments conversation into utterances.
An utterance is here defined as a single completed
speech act. Previous coding systems have simply
defined an utterance as conveying a single thought
(Roter and Larson, 2002) or any independent or un-
restrictive dependent clause of a sentence (Ford and
Ford, 1995). Stolcke et al. (2000) followed Meteer
et al. (1995) in using “sentence-level units”. These
definitions provide helpful guidance to coders, but
many speech acts are poorly formed grammatically,
and cannot be described as a “clause”. Further, some
speech acts cannot be said to convey a “thought” (or
sentence) at all, but rather are pre-syntactical (e.g.,
interjections and non-lexical utterances like laugh-
ter). In any case, most natural segmentations of con-
versations probably largely agree with intuition, and
are not likely to differ substantially.

The model we develop in this work assumes that
transcripts have been manually segmented. While
this comes at some cost, segmenting is still much
cheaper than annotating transcripts. Manually an-
notating a single visit with GMIAS codes takes 2-
4 hours and must be performed by someone with
substantive domain expertise. By contrast, segment-
ing transcripts into utterances takes at most 1/4th of
the time as annotation and can be done by a less
highly-skilled individual. That said, in future work
we hope to explore incorporating automatic segmen-
tation methods (Galley et al., 2003; Eisenstein and
Barzilay, 2008) into our approach.

Each utterance is assigned a single topic code and
a single speech act code. Inter-rater agreement has
been observed to be relatively high for this task:
Kappa between three trained annotators and a ref-
erence annotation ranged from 0.89 to 1.0 for top-
ics and 0.81 to 0.95 for speech acts. We next de-

scribe the topics and speech acts we consider in
more detail; Table 2 enumerates all pairs of these
and their respective counts in the corpus. We note
that GMIAS defines a hierarchy of both topic and
speech act codes, but here we only attempt to cap-
ture the highest level codes in these hierarchies.

Topics comprise six major categories: ARV
adherence, biomedical, logistics, missing/other,
psycho-social and socializing. Antiretroviral (ARV)
adherence applies to utterances that address ARV
medication usage. Biomedical utterances subsume
clinical observations and diagnostic conclusions.
Utterances that concern the business of conducting a
physical examination fall under logistics. The miss-
ing/other topic covers a few cases, including utter-
ances that are effectively outside of the GMIAS uni-
verse and inaudible utterances; however we note that
missing/other is a topic explicitly assigned by hu-
man annotators. The psycho-social topic includes
such issues as substance abuse, recovery, employ-
ment and relationships. Finally, socializing refers to
casual conversation unrelated to the business of the
medical visit, and to social rituals such as greetings.

There are 10 speech acts:3 ask question, commis-
sive, continuation, conversation management, direc-
tive, empathy, give information, humor/levity, miss-
ing/other, and social-ritual. Ask question is self-
explanatory. Utterances in which the speaker makes
a promise or resolves to take action are commissives.
A continuation refers to the completion of a previ-
ously interrupted speech act (these are rare). Con-
versation management describes utterances that fa-
cilitate turn-taking or guide discussion (‘talk about
talk’). Directives refer to statements that look to
control or influence the behavior of the interlocutor.
Utterances that express responses to emotions, con-
cerns or feelings are coded under empathy. Com-
munication of (purported) facts falls under give in-
formation. Humor/levity captures jokes and jovial
conversation. Missing/other is the same as for top-
ics. Finally, social-ritual utterances represent for-
malities (e.g., “thank you”).

The corpus we use includes 360 GMIAS anno-
tated patient-provider interactions (median length:
605 utterances). This data originated as part of

tutes a category of speech act types.

regarding whether we can make this data publicly

a randomized control trial that assessed the efficacy
of an intervention meant to alter physician-patient
communication. We show that JAS outperforms the
baseline approach with respect to both tasks.

We emphasize that while we are here compar-
ing predictive performance, we are specifically in-
terested in fully generative models of conversations
due to the longer-term applications we have in mind.
We would like, e.g., to use this model to assess the
variation in communicative approaches across dif-
ferent doctors, and generative models are more nat-
urally amenable to answering such exploratory ques-
tions. Indeed, perhaps the main strength of the ad-
ditive component based sequential model we have
proposed here is that it will allow us to easily in-
corporate physician-specific parameters that capture
deviations in provider speech act and/or topic tran-
sition patterns. Further, we may soon have access
to many unannotated transcripts, and we would like
to learn from these; generative approaches allow
straight-forward exploitation of unlabeled data. For
these reasons, we did not experiment with discrim-
inative models, e.g., Dynamic Conditional Random
Fields (DCRFs) (Sutton et al., 2007) for this work.

5.1 Cross-fold Validation
Our aim is to measure model performance in terms
of correctly identifying both the topic and speech act
corresponding to each utterance. We quantify this
via the F-score calculated for each topic/speech act
pair that is observed at least once. One can see in
Table 2 that many such pairs have low prevalence;
this can result in undefined F-scores (e.g., when no
utterances are assigned to a given pair). In this case,
it is reasonable to treat these as zero values, as is
commonly done (Forman and Scholz, 2010). This
penalizes models when they completely fail to iden-
tify an entire class of utterances.

We first report macro-averages, that is, averages
of the individual topic/speech act pair F-scores.
Figure 2 displays the macro-averaged F-score for
each of the 10 folds (grey lines connect folds)
and the average of these (thick black line). The
JAS model achieves an average macro-averaged F-
score of .234 versus the .207 achieved by base-
line Markov-Multinomial (MM) model; JAS outper-
forms MM on every fold.

For a more granular picture, Figure 3 displays av-

erage F-score differences with respect to every indi-
vidual topic and speech act pair for which this differ-
ence was non-zero. This is the (signed) difference of
the F-score achieved using JAS minus that achieved
using the MM model; black lines thus correspond
to pairs for which JAS outperformed MM, and red
lines to pairs for which MM outperformed JAS. The
latter achieves an improvement of >= .05 for 10
pairs, and results in an F-score of > .02 below that
attained by MM only once.

The relatively low F-scores for the metrics quanti-
fying performance with respect to the cross of topic
and speech act codes belie relatively good over-
all (marginal) predictive performance. That is, we
achieve much better performance with respect to
metrics that measure topic and speech act predic-
tions independently of one another. This is due to the
very large output space under consideration (see Ta-
ble 2). Specifically, averaged over ten runs, the MM
model achieves a marginal mean topic F-score of
.667 and marginal mean speech act F-score of .516.
JAS begets a marginal mean topic F-score of .661
and a marginal mean speech act F-score of .544;
hence the JAS model incurs an F-score loss of .006
(a 0.9% decrease) with respect to marginal topic
code prediction, but improves the marginal speech
act F-score by .028 (a 5.4% increase).

5.2 (Re-)Analysis of Randomized Control Trial

We also evaluated performance by tallying model
predictions over 116 held-out cases collected from
a randomized, cross-over study of an intervention
aimed at improving physicians knowledge of pa-
tients anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence (Wilson et al.,
2010). The intervention was a report given to the
physician before a routine office visit that contained
information regarding the patients ARV usage and
their beliefs about ARV therapy. To explore the ef-
ficacy of this intervention, 58 paired (116 total) au-
dio recorded visits were annotated with GMIAS; 58
correspond to visits before which the provider was
not provided with the report (control cases), while
the other 58 correspond to visits before which they
were (intervention cases).

Wilson et al. (2010) demonstrated that the in-
tervention indeed increased adherence-related dia-
logue, and specifically the number of information
giving speech acts performed by the physician un-

derneath this topic. We attempted to reproduce this
finding using automated rather manual annotations.
To this end, we trained MM and JAS models over
the aforementioned 360 annotated visits and then
used this model to generate topic and speech act
code predictions for the utterances comprising the
116 held-out visits used for the analysis (these were
not part of the training set). We then assessed the
direction and magnitude of the change in the num-
ber of ARV adherence/information giving utterances
in the paired control versus intervention cases. We
compared the results for this analysis calculated us-
ing the true (manually assigned) codes to the results
calculated using the predicted codes.

Following the original analysis (Wilson et
al., 2010), we report the median number of

ARV/information giving utterances and correspond-
ing 25th and 75th percentiles over the 58 control and
intervention visits, as counted using the true (hu-
man) annotations and using the codes predicted by
the MM and JAS models. These are reported in Ta-
ble 3. The JAS model predictions better match the
true labels in all except one case (the lower 25th for
the controls, for which it predicts the same number
as the MM model).

6 Related work

There is a relatively long history of research into
modeling conversational speech acts in computa-
tional linguistics. Perrault and Allen (1980) con-
ducted pioneering work on computationally formal-
izing speech acts, though their work pre-dates statis-
tical NLP and is therefore not directly relevant to the
present work.

Stolcke et al. (2000; 1998) proposed a probabilis-
tic approach to modeling conversational speech acts
based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Ra-
biner and Juang, 1986). They were interested in
modeling an unrestricted set of conversations, and
did not impose a hierarchy on the speech acts; they

1772



therefore enumerated many more speech acts (42)
than we do in the present work (recall that we use 10
‘high-level’ speech acts).5 Their model has served
as the baseline approach in the present work. Stol-
cke et al. also considered jointly performing speech
recognition and speech act classification.

Others have investigated visual structures of
patient-provider interactions to qualitatively assess
communication in care. Specifically, (Cretchley et
al., 2010) leveraged concept maps to explore conver-
sations between people with schizophrenia and their
carers. Briefly, this approach allowed them to (qual-
itatively) identify two distinct conversational strate-
gies used by care-takers and their patients. Angus et
al. (Angus et al., 2012) presented a similar approach
in which they used text visualization software to ex-
plore patterns of (inferred) topics in consultations.

Another thread of research has investigated classi-
fying speech acts in emails into one of a small set of
“email speech acts”, e.g., request, propose, commit
(Cohen et al., 2004; Goldstein et al., 2006). Cohen et
al. (2004) demonstrated that good performance can
be achieved for this task via existing text classifica-
tion technologies. Elsewhere, researchers have ex-
plored automatically inferring “speech acts” in vari-
ous other online social mediums, including message
board posts (Qadir and Riloff, 2011), Wikipedia talk
pages (Ferschke et al., 2012) and Twitter (Zhang et
al., 2012).

A separate line of inquiry concerns classifying di-
alogue acts in chat. Researchers have attempted di-
alogue act classification both for 1-on-1 (Kim et al.,
2010) and multi-party (Kim et al., 2012; Clark and
Popescu-Belis, 2004) online chats. Ang et al. (2005)
considered the task of jointly segmenting and clas-
sifying utterances comprising multiparty meetings,
while Hsueh and Moore (2006) proposed analogous
methods for topic segmentation and labeling (other
works on topic segmentation include (Galley et al.,
2003) and (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)). Incor-
porating such segmentation methods into the pro-
posed model (rather than relying on inputs to be
manually segmented beforehand) would be a natu-
ral extension of this work.

Additive component models of text have recently

5We note that only 8 of the 42 speech acts appeared with
greater than 1% frequency in Stolcke et al.’s corpus.

gained traction (Eisenstein et al., 2011; Paul, 2012;
Paul and Dredze, 2012; Paul et al., 2013). To our
knowledge, this is the first extension of supervised
additive component models to a sequential task.6

7 Conclusions and Future Directions

We have proposed a novel Joint, Additive, Sequen-
tial (JAS) model of conversational topics and speech
acts. In contrast to previous approaches to mod-
eling conversational exchanges, this model factors
both the current topic and the current speech act into
token emission and state transition probabilities. We
demonstrated that this model consistently outper-
forms a univariate generative baseline that treats
speech acts and topics independently. Furthermore,
we showed JAS can automatically re-produce the
analysis of a randomized control trial designed to as-
sess the efficacy of an intervention to alter physician
communication habits with high-fidelity.

The generative component-based framework we
have introduced in this work provides a means of
exploring factors in patient-physician communica-
tion. One limitation of the model we have pre-
sented is that it makes several simplifying assump-
tions around dialogue. For example, we have ig-
nored non-linearities and ‘back-channels’ in con-
versation, and we have ignored differences across
physicians with respect to communication styles.

Going forward, we hope to address these limita-
tions. We also plan on extending this model to in-
vestigate qualitative questions surrounding patient-
physician communication quantitatively. For exam-
ple, we are interested in investigating how communi-
cation varies across hospitals and physicians. To ex-
plore this, we can add additional components to the
transition probability terms corresponding to differ-
ent hospitals and doctors. Ultimately, we would like
to correlate patterns in physician communication (as
gleaned from the model) with objective, measured
health outcomes (e.g., patient satisfaction and adher-
ence to ARVs).

membership’ Markov models for unsupervised conversation
