Abstract 

This paper presents a hybrid approach to the 

enhancement of English to Arabic statistical 

machine translation quality. Machine Transla-

tion has been defined as the process that utiliz-

es computer software to translate text from one 

natural language to another. Arabic, as a mor-

phologically rich language, is a highly flex-

ional language, in that the same root can lead 

to various forms according to its context. Sta-

tistical machine translation (SMT) engines of-

ten show poor syntax processing especially 

when the language used is morphologically 

rich such as Arabic. In this paper, to overcome 

these shortcomings, we describe our hybrid 

approach which integrates knowledge of the 

Arabic language into statistical machine trans-

lation. In this framework, we propose the use 

of a featured language model SFLM (Smaïli et 

al., 2004) to be able to integrate syntactic and 

grammatical knowledge about each word. In 

this paper, we first discuss some challenges in 

translating from English to Arabic and we ex-
plore various techniques to improve perfor-

mance on this task. We apply a morphological 

segmentation step for Arabic words and we 

present our hybrid approach by identifying 

morpho-syntactic class of each segmented 

word to build up our statistical feature lan-

guage model. We propose the scheme for re-
combining the segmented Arabic word, and 

describe their effect on translation. 

1 Introduction 

Arabic is characterized by complex morphology 

and rich vocabulary. It is a derivational, flexional 

language. In addition, Arabic is an agglutinative 

language. In fact, most Arabic words are made 

up by the concatenation of certain morphemes 

together.  An Arabic corpus will therefore have 

more surface forms than an English corpus of the 

same size. 

On the other hand, many Arabic words are hom-

ographic: they have the same orthographic form, 

but they have not the same meaning. This prop-

erty can reduce the size of the translation vo-

cabulary and has an important implication for 

statistical modeling of the Arabic language. 

These factors affect the performance of English-

Arabic Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). 

To overcome these weaknesses of SMT, we pro-

pose a hybrid approach that seeks to integrate the 

linguistic information and enrich the lexical and 

syntactic resources in the statistical machine 

translation. 

Arabic language translation has been widely 

studied recently. Most of the time, the rich mor-

phology of Arabic language is seen as a serious 

problem that must be resolved to build up an ef-

ficient translation system. It has been proven that 

pre-processing Arabic data and integrating its 

morpho-syntactic features is useful to improve 

machine translation results. The use of similar 

techniques for English-to-Arabic SMT requires 

recombination of the target side into valid sur-

face forms, which is not a trivial task. 

In this paper, we describe an initial set of exper-

iments on English-to-Arabic machine translation: 

we apply a morphological segmentation step for 

Arabic words and we present our hybrid ap-

proach by identifying morpho-syntactic class of 

each segmented word to build up our statistical 

feature language model. We propose the scheme 

for recombining the segmented Arabic, and de-

scribe their effect on translation.

This paper is organized as follows: section 2 

gives a brief description of some related works 

using hybrid approach to Machine Translation to 

introduce morpho-syntactic features in a machine 

translation process. Section 3 describes the base-

line system. Then, section 4 presents the used 

morphological analyzer MORPH2 for Arabic 

texts, able to recognize word composition and to 

provide more specific morphological information 

about it. Next, we give information about Arabic 

syntax and morphology in section 5; in the re-

mainder of this section, we discuss the complexi-

ty of the Arabic morphology and the challenge of 

recombining the translated and segmented Ara-

bic words in to their surface forms. The Statisti-

cal Feature Language Model (SFLM) is ex-

plained in section 6, when used it aims to inte-

grate morpho-syntactic knowledge about word in 

the language model. We propose in section 7 a 

scheme for recombining the translated and seg-

mented Arabic words in to their surface forms. 

Section 8 gives a short overview of the data and 

tools used to build up our SMT system and 

shows the experimental details of our system 

using SFLM and the morphological analyzer 

MORPH2. Section 9 discusses the obtained re-

sults and, finally, section 10 presents some con-

clusions. 

2 Related work 

Arabic language translation has been widely 

studied recently. Most of the time, the rich mor-

phology of Arabic language is seen as a serious 

problem that must be resolved to build up an ef-

ficient translation system. Research into machine 

translation hybridization has increased over the 

last few years particulary with the statistical ap-

proach for machine translation. Habash et al. 

(Habash et al., 2006) boost generation-heavy 

machine translation (GHMT) with statistical ma-

chine translation components. They use hybridi-

zation approach from the opposite direction by 

incorporating SMT components into rule-based 

systems. In (Sawaf, 2010), authors described a 

novel approach on how to deal with Arabic noisy 

and dialectal data. They normalize the input text 

to a commun form to be able to process it. 

In recent years, the overall quality of machine 

translation output has been improved greatly. 

Still, SMT engines often show poor results in 

their syntactic forms. Hybrid approach try to 

overcome these typical errors by integrating 

knowledge of Arabic language. It has been prov-

en that pre-processing Arabic data and integrat-

ing its features such as morphological infor-

mation and syntactic structure is useful to im-

prove machine translation results. 

In the next, we review this body of research. Our 

own research differs in that how to integrate in-

formation into SMT components systems. 

Most of the related work is on Arabic-to-English 

SMT. In prior work (Lee, 2004) (Habash and 

Sadat, 2006), it has been shown that morphologi-

cal segmentation of the Arabic source benefits 

the performance of Arabic-to-English SMT. In 

(Lee, 2004), the author uses a trigram language 

model to segment Arabic words. He then pro-

ceeds to deleting or merging some of the seg-

mented morphemes in order to make the seg-

mented Arabic source align better with the Eng-

lish target. Habash and Sadat (Habash and Sadat, 

2006) compared the use of the BAMA (Buck-

walter, 2002. ) and MADA (Habash and Ram-

bow, 2005) toolkits to segment the Arabic source 

as well as simple pattern matching to do morpho-

logical analysis for Arabic-English SMT, and 

were able to improve translation for tasks with 

out-of-domain training corpora. Sadat and Ha-

bash (Sadat and Habash. 2006) also showed that 

it was possible to combine the use of several var-

iations of morphological analysis both while de-

coding (combining multiple phrase tables) and 

rescoring the combined outputs of distinct sys-

tems.  

Introducing morphological analyzers in Arabic 

machine translation process is very present in the 

literature. The recent work (Besacier et al., 2008) 

conducted in depth a study of the influence of 

Arabic segmenters on the translation quality of 

an Arabic to English phrase-based system using 

the Moses decoder. In this work, authors demon-

strate that the use of the morphology information 

in the SMT has a great impact in improving re-

sults. They believe that simultaneously using 

multiple segmentations is a promising way to 

improve machine translation of Arabic. 

Arabic is an inflected language with several 

homonyms words, consequently linguistic fea-

tures are very useful to reduce statistical machine 

translation errors due to this phenomena. Some 

research works have been conducted in this area 

(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) (Schwenk and Dé-

chelotte, 2007). The factored language model 

(FLM) approach of Bilmes and Kirchhoff 

(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) is a more linguisti-

75



cally-informed modeling approach than the n-

gram one. FLM are an extension of standard lan-

guage model where the prediction is based upon 

a set of features (and not only on previous occur-

rences of the predicted word). FLM addresses the 

problems of data-sparsity in morphologically 

complex languages by representing words as 

bundles of features, thus one can easily capture 

dependencies between subword parts of adjacent 

words. Some other works have been proposed to 

integrate linguistic information such as part-of-

speech, morphology and shallow syntax in con-

ventional phrase-based statistical translation 

(Koehn and Hoang. 2007). These translation 

models allow integrating multiple levels of in-

formation into the translation process instead of 

incorporating linguistic markers in either prepro-

cessing or postprocessing steps. For example, in 

morphologically rich languages it may be prefer-

able to translate lemma, part-of-speech and mor-

phological information separately and combine 

the information on the target side to generate the 

output surface words. In this model the transla-

tion process is broken up into three steps. Trans-

late input lemmas into output lemmas in a first 

step. Then, translate morphological and POS fac-

tors in a second step. Finally, generate surface 

forms given the lemma and the linguistic factors. 

These factored translation models have been 

used to improve the word level translation accu-

racy by incorporating the factors in phrase-based 

translation. In (Schwenk and Déchelotte. 2007), 

authors focus on incorporating morpho-syntactic 

features in the translation model for the English-

Spanish machine translation process. In this 

work, authors propose the use of augmented 

units in the translation model instead of simple 

words. These units are composed by surface 

word forms combined with their morpho-

syntactic categories. This method allows lexical 

disambiguation of words using their roles and 

their grammatical contexts. 

Previous works on English-to-Arabic SMT using 

factored models were proposed in (Sarikaya and 

Deng. 2007) and (Badr et al., 2008). The first 

uses shallow segmentation, and does not make 

use of contextual information. In this work au-

thors use Joint Morphological-Lexical Language 

Models to rerank the output. The second work 

shows that morphological decomposition of the 

Arabic text is beneficial, especially for smaller-

size corpora, and investigates different recombi-

nation techniques. In this work, authors propose 

the use of factored translation models for English 

to Arabic translation. The factors on the English 

side are POS tags and the surface word. On the 

Arabic side, they use the surface word, the stem 

and the POS tag concatenated to the segmented 

clitics. 

In (Kholy and Habash. 2010), authors empha-

sized on the sparsity problem of English-Arabic 

translation. They considered the tokenization and 

normalization of Arabic data to improve English-

to-Arabic SMT. 

3 Phrase-Based Machine Translation 

Statistical machine translation methods have 

evolved from using the simple word based mod-

els (Brown et al., 1993) to phrase based models 

(Marcu and Wong, 2002; Och and Ney. 2003). 

The SMT has been formulated as a noisy channel 

model in which the target language sentence, s is 

seen as distorted by the channel into the foreign 

language t. In that, we try to find the sentence t 

which maximizes the  P(t|s) probability: 
 

argmaxtP(t|s) = argmaxtP(s|t)P(t)   (1) 
 

Where P(t) is the language model and P(s|t) is the 

translation model. We can get the language mod-

el from a monolingual corpus (in the target lan-

guage). The translation model is obtained by us-

ing an aligned bilingual corpus. 

The translation model is combined together with 

the following six additional feature models: the 

target language model, the word and the phrase 

bonus and the source-to-target and target-to-

source lexicon model and the reordering model. 

These models are optimized by the decoder1. In 

our case, we use the open source Moses decoder 

described in (Koehn et al., 2007). 

4 Segmentation for Arabic translation 

Arabic is a morphologically complex language. 

Compared with English, an Arabic word can 

sometimes correspond to a whole English sen-

tence (Example: the Arabic word "أتتذّكروننا" corre-

sponds in English to: "Do you remember us"). 

The aim of a morphological analysis step is to 

recognize word composition and to provide spe-

cific morphological information about it. For

Example: the word "يعرفون" (in English: they 

know) is the result of the concatenation of the 

prefix "ي" indicating the present and suffix "ون" 

indicating the plural masculine of the verb عرف" " 

(in English: to know). The morphological ana-

lyzer determines for each word the list of all its 

possible morphological features. 

In Arabic language, some conjugated verbs or 

inflected nouns can have the same orthographic 

form due to absence of vowels (Example: non-

voweled Arabic word "فصل" can be a verb in the 

past "ََفََصل" (He dismissed), or a masculine noun 

"  chapter / season), or a concatenation of) "فَْصلَ 

the coordinating conjunction " ََف" (then)َwith the 

verb "صل": imperative of the verb (bind)). 

In order to handle the morphological ambigui-

ties, we decide to use MORPH2, an Arabic mor-

phological analyzer developed at the Miracl la-

boratory2. MORPH2 is based on a knowledge-

based computational method. It accepts as input 

an Arabic text, a sentence or a word. Its morpho-

logical disambiguation and analysis method is 

based on five steps: 

 A tokenization process is applied in a first 
step. It consists of two sub-steps. First, the 

text is divided into sentences, using the 

system Star (Belguith et al., 2005), an Ar-

abic text tokenizer based on contextual 

exploration of punctuation marks and con-

junctions of coordination. The second sub-

step detects the different words in each 

sentence. 

 A morphological preprocessing step which 
aims to extract clitics agglutinated to the 

word. A filtering process is then applied to 

check out if the remaining word is a parti-

cle, a number, a date, or a proper noun. 

 An affixal analysis is then applied to de-
termine all possible affixes and roots. It 

aims to identify basic elements belonging 

to the constitution of a word (the root and 

affixes i.e. prefix, infix and suffix). 

 The morphological analysis step consists 
of determining for each word, all its pos-

sible morpho-syntactic features (i.e, part 

of speech, gender, number, time, person, 

etc.). Morpho-syntactic features detection 

is made up on three stages. The first stage 

identifies the part-of-speech of the word 

                                                 
2 http://www.miracl.rnu.tn 

(i.e. verb "فعل", noun "اسم", particle "أداة" 

and proper noun "َعلم  The second .("اسم

stage extracts for each part-of-speech a list 

of its morpho-syntactic features. A filter-

ing of these feature lists is made in the 

third stage. 

 Vocalization and validation step: each 
handled word is fully vocalized according 

to its morpho-syntactic features deter-

mined in the previous step. 

5  Challenges on English-Arabic SMT 

In this section, we briefly explore the challenges 

that prevent the construction of successful SMT. 

The divergence of Arabic and English puts a 

rocky barrier in building a prosperous machine 

translation system. Morphological and syntactic 

preprocessing is important in order to converge 

the two languages. 

Arabic is a highly agglutinative language with a 

rich set of suffixes. Inflectional and derivational 

productions introduce a big growth in the num-

ber of possible word forms. In Arabic, articles, 

prepositions, pronouns, etc. can be affixed to ad-

jectives, nouns, verbs and particles to which they 

are related. The richness in morphology intro-

duces many challenges to the translation problem 

both to and from Arabic.  

In general, ambiguities in Arabic word are main-

ly caused by the absence of the short vowels. 

Thus, a word can have different meanings. There 

are also the usual homographs of uninflected 

words with/without the same pronunciation, 

which have different meanings and usually dif-

ferent POS’s. For example: the word "ذھب", can 

correspond in English to: "gold" or to: "go". In 

Arabic there are four categories of words: noun, 

proper noun, verbs and particles. The absence of 

short vowels can cause ambiguities within the 

same category or cross different categories. For 

example: the word "بعد" corresponds to many 

categories (table 1). 

 

meanings of a word "بعد" Categories 

after Particule 

remoteness Noun 

remove Verb 

go away Verb 

 
Table 1: Different meanings of the word "بعد" 

 

77



In table 1, there exist four different analyses for 

the word "بعد". This ambiguity can be resolved 

only in the phrase context. 

Due to the Arabic is an agglutinative language, 

the morphological decomposition is required. So 

as mentioned above, both training and decoding 

use segmented Arabic. The final output of the 

decoder must therefore be recombined into a sur-

face form. This proves to be a non-trivial chal-

lenge for a reason that Arabic uses diverse sys-

tems of prefixes, suffixes, and pronouns that are 

attached to the words (Soudi et al., 2007). For 

example, the Arabic sentence "قبلَتَعرضَك" can 

be recombined as presented in table 2. 

 

Table 2: Ambiguity in recombining sentence 

6 Statistical Feature Language Model  

One of the problems of statistical language mod-

els is to consider that the word is depending only 

on its previous history (words or classes). But in 

fact, in natural language the appearance of a 

word depends not only on its history but also on 

some others features. The word "كتب" (write) and 

 books) are two different words, but we) "كتب"

can’t predict them if we don’t know their fea-

tures and their contexts.  

In order to settle such problem we are trying to 

introduce knowledge about the word features by 

using a featured statistical language model: Sta-

tistical Feature Language Model (Smaïli et al., 

2004). 

Arabic is an inflected natural language, linguis-

tic features are very useful to reduce translation 

errors due to homonyms. By employing SFLM, 

each word is considered as an array of m fea-

tures: 

 

 wi
1..m =

(

 
 

f1
i

f2
i

.

.
fm
i )

 
 

            (2)                                             

 

Each fj
i is a linguistic characteristic of wi. These 

characteristics or features could be the surface 

word, its syntactic class, its gender, its number, 

its semantic class, ... 

(Smaïli et al., 2004) substitute in the classical n-

gram language model, the words by their feature 

arrays which contain surface words and their 

linguistic characteristics. Thus, a SFLM model 

is built up by analogy with the classical n-gram 

model given by: 

 

P(w1, w2, … ,wL) =
∏ P(wi|wi−1
L
i=1 …wi−n+1)          (3) 
 

To define SFLM model it is enough to replace 

each word wi by its feature array  (f1
i , f2

i , … , fm
i )t 

as follows: 

 

P(w1
1..m, w2

1..m, … ,wL
1..m) =

∏ P(

(

 
 

f1
i

f2
i

.

.
fm
i )

 
 
|

(

 
 

f1
i−1

f2
i−1

.

.
fm
i−1)

 
 

L
i=1 …

(

 
 

f1
i−n+1

f2
i−n+1

.

.
fm
i−n+1)

 
 
)           (4)                                    

 

Where (f1
i , f2

i , … , fm
i )t is the feature array corre-

sponding to the ith word. This model is very sim-

ple to implement with classical language model-

ing toolkits like CMU (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 

1997) and SLRIM (Stolcke, 2002). In fact, we 

replace each word in the Arabic training and test 

corpora by its feature array. Thus the following 

notation is adopted: 

 

 wi
1…m = f1

i_f2
i , … , _fm

i               (5)                                                  

 

The feature array f1
i__f2

i , … , __fm
i  will be treated 

like only one string. In our experiments, we de-

cided to employ a SFLM with two features. We 

choose to consider the word itself as first feature 

and its syntactic class (category) as second one. 

In this case, a word wi is represented like the 
concatenation of the two strings wi and C(wi) as 
follows: 

wi_C(wi )                  (6) 

where  𝐂(𝐰𝐢 )  represents the morpho-syntactic 
class of 𝐰𝐢. 

7 Arabic recombination 

As mentioned in Section 1, Arabic is character-

ized by a rich morphology. In addition to being 

inflected for gender and number, words can be 

attached to various clitics for conjunction "و" 

(and), the definite article ال"" َ( so(iَ psop)h, ,)ehَ

(o.eب"َ. " (by/with), "ل" (for), "ك" (as)) and object 

pronouns (e.g. "ھم" (their/them)).  

Recombined  sentence meanings 
 Before exposure قبلََتعرضك
 Accepted the offer قبلتَعرضك

78



We apply decomposition before aligning the 

training data, by splitting off each clitic and affix 

agglutinated to the word separately, such that 

any given word is split into at most five parts: 

 

Proclitic + prefix+ stem +suffix + enclitic. 

Then, the stem is associated with its morpho-

syntactic feature. For example the word 

 in English: "do you  know them" is) "أتعرفونهم"

replaced by: 
 

 أََتََعرف_َفعلَونََھمَ

 

So in both training and decoding processes, seg-

mented Arabic words are used. The final output 

of the decoder will be also a list of segmented 

words. Therefore this output must be recombined 

into a surface form to be able to evaluate the 

translation result by using the right surface 

words. 

This proves to be a non-trivial challenge for a 

reason of order ambiguity:  a segmented word 

can be recombined into two grammatically cor-

rect forms. Clitics can correspond to enclitic or 

proclitic.  For example: in the segmented words:  

" َتَكَذلك ال كتاب سلم " the clitic "ك" can be recom-

bined with the previous word ("ك": enclitic). So 

the segmented words " َذلك َك َت ال كتاب سلم " can b 

erecombined to " َذلك الكتابَسلمتك ", in English: "I 

gave this book".  

The clitic "ك" can be recombined also with the 

following word ("ك": proclitic), in this case, the 

segmented words " ذلكَسلمَتَك"  can be recombined 

to " الكتابَكذلك  in English: "I also gave the ,"سلمت 

book". 

Those two sentences have the same segmented 

form, but they have different meanings. By in-

troducing morphological features (e.g. proclitic, 

prefix, stem, suffix and enclitic) for each seg-

ment, we may remove this ambiguity:  

Therefore we apply reconstruction of the Arabic 

segmented words by agglutinating the morpho-

logical segments in the following order:  
 

ھم_suffixََعرف_َفعلَون_prefixََت_procliticََأ_َ

enclitic 

8 Experiments 

8.1 Used data 

In this paper, we consider the translation task of 

texts from English into Arabic. We used 

IWSLT2010 data as a parallel corpus. For 

training the translation models, the train part of 

the IWSLT10 data was used which contains 

19972 sentence pairs. For testing, we used a 

subset data made up of 469 sentences (there were 

1 Arabic reference translation for each Arabic 

sentence). All BLEU scores presented in this 

paper are case-sensitive and include 

punctuations. For the Arabic language model we 

use trigrams to build up the baseline system and 

a 7-grams to build up our translation system. In 

fact, we use a 7-gram language model because in 

our system, each word in the training Arabic 

corpus is replaced by its list of morphological 

segments: proclitic, prefix, stem, suffix and 

enclitic. 

8.2 Baseline system 

The English-Arabic baseline system is built upon 

the open-source MT toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 

2007). Phrase pairs are extracted from word 

alignments generated by GIZA++ (Och and Ney. 

2003). The phrase-based translation model pro-

vides direct and inverted frequency-based and 

lexical-based probabilities for each phrase pair. 

To train the trigram language models, SRILM 

(Stolcke, 2002) was used. The performances re-

ported in this paper were measured using the 

BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). 

8.3 Experimental results 

 Arabic word  segmenter: 

In our method, each Arabic word, from the target 

training data, is replaced by its segmented form. 

For example: the word "فعرفناھم" (in English: "and 

we have known them") is the result of the con-

catenation of the proclitic "ََف" (then): coordinat-

ing conjunction, the suffix "نا" for the present 

masculine plural, enclitic "ھم" (for the masculine 

plural posession pronoun), and the rest of the 

word "عرف" indicating the stem. So, the word 

 :will be replaced by "فعرفناھم"

 
 "فََعرفَََناََھمَ"

 SFLM for introducing Morpho-syntactic 
features: 

For introducing morpho-syntactic features into 

the English-Arabic translation system, we use 

part of speech tagging provided by MORPH2. 

We believe that using these features can improve 

79



our language modeling when used with the 

SFLM model. 

In our proposed method, each Arabic word, from 

the target Arabic training data, is replaced by the 

reduced word (obtained by removing its clitics 

and its affixes), combined with its syntactic class 

(category), where clitic and affix are featured 

with their morphological classes (e.g. proclitic, 

prefix, suffix and enclitic). 

For example : the word "سيخبرھم" (in English: "he 

will notify them") is the result of the concatena-

tion of the proclitic "س" indicating the future,  the 

prefix "ي" for the present, enclitic "ھم" (for the 

masculine plural posession pronoun),  and the 

rest of the word "خبر" such as its syntactic class is 

verb: "فعل". So, the word "سيخبرھم" will be re-

placed by: 

 enclitic"خبر_فعلَھم_prefixَ ي_procliticَ س_" 

In this notation, its morpho-syntactic feature (as 

verb "فعل", noun "اسم", particle "أداة" and proper 

noun "اسمَعلم"). The language model is then gen-

erated using the so obtained target Arabic train-

ing data, by the standard SRILM toolkit. The so 

obtained Arabic corpus in then used for training 

(without any change on the English side).  

 Arabic post-processing 

As mentioned above, both training and decoding 

phases use Arabic segmented words. The final 

output of the decoder will be also composed of 

segmented words. Therefore these words must be 

recombined into their surface forms. Therefore 

we apply reconstruction of the Arabic segmented 

words just by agglutinating the morphological 

segments in the following order:  

Proclitic + prefix+ stem +suffix + enclitic. 

The English-Arabic translation performance of 

this new system is reported in table3, and com-

pared to the baseline system. 

 
 Bleu  

Baseline 12.58% 

SMT hybrid 13.16% 
 

Table 3: Comparison of the English-Arabic transla-

tion systems 

 

Table 3 shows a significant improvement of the 

BLEU score when we use segmentation and in-

troduce morpho-syntactic features into the Eng-

lish-Arabic translation system by using SFLM. 

The BLEU score increases from 12.58% to 

13.16%. 

These results attest that the use of morpho-

syntactic features within SMT system can en-

hance translation performances, especially for 

agglutinative and inflectional languages, such as 

Arabic. Also, using the word category concate-

nated to the word, can avoid the problem of 

homographics and can improve language model-

ing efficacity.  

9 Conclusion 

English-to-Arabic machine translation has been a 

challenging research issue for many researchers 

in the field of Arabic Natural Language Pro-

cessing. In this study, we have evaluated the ef-

fectiveness of morphological decomposition of 

the Arabic text and SFLM language modeling 

method to integrate morpho-syntactic features in 

English to Arabic machine translation. We also 

presented our method for recombining the seg-

mented Arabic target. Our results suggest that 

morphological decomposition of the Arabic text 

is beneficial and that using morpho-syntactic fea-

tures is a promising way to improve English to 

Arabic machine translation. The use of recombi-

nation of the target side technique is beneficial to 

overcome ambiguity in recombining Arabic text.
