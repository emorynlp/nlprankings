Abstract

This work discusses the evaluation of
baseline algorithms for Web search re-
sults clustering. An analysis is performed
over frequently used baseline algorithms
and standard datasets. Our work shows
that competitive results can be obtained by
either fine tuning or performing cascade
clustering over well-known algorithms. In
particular, the latter strategy can lead to
a scalable and real-world solution, which
evidences comparative results to recent
text-based state-of-the-art algorithms.

1 Introduction

Visualizing Web search results remains an open
problem in Information Retrieval (IR). For exam-
ple, in order to deal with ambiguous or multi-
faceted queries, many works present Web page re-
sults using groups of correlated contents instead
of long flat lists of relevant documents. Among
existing techniques, Web Search Results Cluster-
ing (SRC) is a commonly studied area, which
consists in clustering “on-the-fly” Web page re-
sults based on their Web snippets. Therefore,
many works have been recently presented includ-
ing task adapted clustering (Moreno et al., 2013),
meta clustering (Carpineto and Romano, 2010)
and knowledge-based clustering (Scaiella et al.,
2012).

Evaluation is also a hot topic both in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and IR. Within the
specific case of SRC, different metrics have been
used such as F1-measure (F1), kSSL1 and Fb3-
measure (Fb3) over different standard datasets:
ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and
Moresque (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010). Unfor-
tunately, comparative results are usually biased as

such is out of the scope of this paper.

baseline algorithms are run with default parame-
ters whereas proposed methodologies are usually
tuned to increase performance over the studied
datasets. Moreover, evaluation metrics tend to cor-
relate with the number of produced clusters.

In this paper, we focus on deep understand-
ing of the evaluation task within the context of
SRC. First, we provide the results of baseline algo-
rithms with their best parameter settings. Second,
we show that a simple cascade strategy of base-
line algorithms can lead to a scalable and real-
world solution, which evidences comparative re-
sults to recent text-based algorithms. Finally, we
draw some conclusions about evaluation metrics
and their bias to the number of output clusters.

2 Related Work

Search results clustering is an active research area.
Two main streams have been proposed so far:
text-based strategies such as (Hearst and Peder-
sen, 1996; Zamir and Etzioni, 1998; Zeng et al.,
2004; Osinski et al., 2004; Carpineto and Romano,
2010; Carpineto et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2013)
and knowledge-based ones (Ferragina and Gulli,
2008; Scaiella et al., 2012; Di Marco and Nav-
igli, 2013). Successful results have been obtained
by recent works compared to STC (Zamir and Et-
zioni, 1998) and LINGO (Osinski et al., 2004)
which provide publicly available implementations,
and as a consequence, are often used as state-
of-the-art baselines. On the one hand, STC pro-
poses a monothetic methodology which merges
base clusters with high string overlap relying on
suffix trees. On the other hand, LINGO is a poly-
thetic solution which reduces a term-document
matrix using single value decomposition and as-
signs documents to each discovered latent topic.

All solutions have been evaluated on differ-
ent datasets and evaluation measures. The well-
known F1 has been used as the standard evaluation
metric. More recently, (Carpineto and Romano,

the Rand Index metric and (Moreno et al., 2013)
used Fb3 introduced by (Amigó et al., 2009) as a
more adequate metric for clustering.

Different standard datasets have been built such
as AMBIENT2 (Carpineto and Romano, 2009),
ODP-2393 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and
Moresque4 (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010). ODP-
239, an improved version of AMBIENT, is based
on DMOZ5 where each query, over 239 ones, is a
selected category in DMOZ and its associated sub-
categories are considered as the respective clus-
ter results. The small text description included in
DMOZ is considered as a Web snippet. Moresque
is composed by 114 queries selected from a list
of ambiguous Wikipedia entries. For each query, a
set of Web results have been collected from a com-
mercial search engine and manually classified into
the disambiguation Wikipedia pages which form
the reference clusters.

In Table 2, we report the results obtained so
far in the literature by text-based and knowledge-
based strategies for the standard F1 over ODP-239
and Moresque datasets.

results of baseline algorithms are usually run with

default parameters based on available implemen-
tations. As such, no conclusive remarks can be
drawn knowing that tuned versions might provide
improved results.

In particular, available implementations6 of
STC, LINGO and the Bisection K-means (BiKm)
include a fixed stopping criterion. However, it
is well-known that tuning the number of output
clusters may greatly impact the clustering perfor-
mance. In order to provide fair results for base-
line algorithms, we evaluated a k-dependent7 ver-
sion for all baselines. We ran all algorithms for
k = 2..20 and chose the best result as the “op-
timal” performance. Table 1 sums up results for
all the baselines in their different configurations
and shows that tuned versions outperform standard
(available) ones both for F1 and Fb3 over ODP-
239 and Moresque.

4 Cascade SRC Algorithms

In the previous section, our aim was to claim that
tunable versions of existing baseline algorithms
might evidence improved results when faced to
the ones reported in the literature. And these
values should be taken as the “real” baseline re-
sults within the context of controllable environ-
ments. However, exploring all the parameter space
is not an applicable solution in a real-world situa-
tion where the reference is unknown. As such, a
stopping criterion must be defined to adapt to any
dataset distribution. This is the particular case for
the standard implementations of STC and LINGO.

Previous results (Carpineto and Romano, 2010)
showed that different SRC algorithms provide dif-
ferent results and hopefully complementary ones.
For instance, STC demonstrates high recall and
low precision, while LINGO inversely evidences
high precision for low recall. Iteratively apply-
ing baseline SRC algorithms may thus lead to
improved results by exploiting each algorithm’s
strengths.

In a cascade strategy, we first cluster the ini-
tial set of Web page snippets with any SRC al-
gorithm. Then, the input of the second SRC al-
gorithm is the set of meta-documents built from
the documents belonging to the same cluster8. Fi-
nally, each clustered meta-document is mapped to
the original documents generating the final clus-
ters. This process can iteratively be applied, al-
though we only consider two-level cascade strate-
gies in this paper.

This strategy can be viewed as an easy, re-
producible and parameter free baseline SRC im-
plementation that should be compared to existing
state-of-the-art algorithms. Table 3 shows the re-
sults obtained with different combinations of SRC
baseline algorithms for the cascade strategy both
for F1 and Fb3 over ODP-239 and Moresque. The
“Stand.” column corresponds to the performance
of the cascade strategy and k to the automatically
obtained number of clusters. Results show that
the combination STC-STC achieves the best per-
formance overall for the F1 and STC-LINGO is
the best combination for the Fb3 in both datasets.

In order to provide a more complete evaluation,
we included in column “Equiv.” the performance
that could be obtained by the tunable version of
each single baseline algorithm based on the same
k. Interestingly, the cascade strategy outperforms
the tunable version for any k for F1 but fails to
compete (not by far) with Fb3 . This issue will be
discussed in the next section.

5 Discussion

In Table 1, one can see that when using the tuned
version and evaluating with F1, the best perfor-
mance for each baseline algorithm is obtained for
the same number of output clusters independently
of the dataset (i.e. around 3 for STC and LINGO
and 2 for BiKm). As such, a fast conclusion would
be that the tuned versions of STC, LINGO and
BiKm are strong baselines as they show similar
behaviour over datasets. Then, in a realistic situa-
tion, k might be directly tuned to these values.

However, when comparing the output number
of clusters based on the best F1 value to the refer-
ence number of clusters, a huge difference is ev-
idenced. Indeed, in Moresque, the ground-truth
average number of clusters is 6.6 and exactly 10
in ODP-239. Interestingly, Fb3 shows more accu-
rate values for the number of output clusters for

the best tuned baseline performances. In particu-
lar, the best Fb3 results are obtained for LINGO
with 5.8 clusters for Moresque and 8.7 clusters
for ODP-239 which most approximate the ground-
truths.

In order to better understand the behaviour of
each evaluation metric (i.e. Fβ and Fb3) over dif-
ferent k values, we experienced a uniform random
clustering over Moresque and ODP-239. In Fig-
ure 1(c), we illustrate these results. The important
issue is that Fβ is more sensitive to the number
of output clusters than Fb3 . On the one hand, all
Fβ measures provide best results for k = 2 and
a random algorithm could reach F1=0.5043 for
Moresque and F1=0.2980 for ODP-239 (see Ta-
ble 1), thus outperforming almost all standard im-
plementations of STC, LINGO and BiKm for both
datasets. On the other hand, Fb3 shows that most
standard baseline implementations outperform the
random algorithm.

Moreover, in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), we illus-
trate the different behaviours between F1 and Fb3
for k = 2..20 for both standard and tuned ver-
sions of STC, LINGO and BiKm. One may clearly
see that Fb3 is capable to discard the algorithm
(BiKm) which performs worst in the standard ver-
sion while this is not the case for F1. And, for
LINGO, the optimal performances over Moresque
and ODP-239 are near the ground-truth number of
clusters while this is not the case for F1 which ev-
idences a decreasing tendency when k increases.

In section 4, we showed that competitive results
could be achieved with a cascade strategy based on
baseline algorithms. Although results outperform
standard and tunable baseline implementations for
F1, it is wise to use Fb3 to better evaluate the SRC
task, based on our previous discussion. In this
case, the best values are obtained by STC-LINGO
with Fb3=0.4980 for Moresque and Fb3=0.4249
for ODP-239, which highly approximate the val-
ues reported in (Moreno et al., 2013): Fb3=0.490
(Moresque) and Fb3=0.452 (ODP-239). Addition-
ally, when STC is performed first and LINGO later
the cascade algorithm scale better due to LINGO
and STC scaling properties9.

adapted to evaluate SRC systems than the com-
monly used F1 over the standard datasets avail-
able so far. New baseline values which approxi-
mate state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clus-

tering performance can also be obtained by an
easy, reproducible and parameter free implemen-
tation (the cascade strategy) and could be consid-
ered as the “new” baseline results for future works.
