Abstract

We propose a real-time machine translation
system that allows users to select a news
category and to translate the related live
news articles from Arabic, Czech, Danish,
Farsi, French, German, Italian, Polish, Por-
tuguese, Spanish and Turkish into English.
The Moses-based system was optimised for
the news domain and differs from other
available systems in four ways: (1) News
items are automatically categorised on the
source side, before translation; (2) Named
entity translation is optimised by recog-
nising and extracting them on the source
side and by re-inserting their translation in
the target language, making use of a sep-
arate entity repository; (3) News titles are
translated with a separate translation sys-
tem which is optimised for the specific style
of news titles; (4) The system was opti-
mised for speed in order to cope with the
large volume of daily news articles.

1 Introduction

Being able to read news from other countries and
written in other languages allows readers to be
better informed. It allows them to detect national
news bias and thus improves transparency and
democracy. Existing online translation systems
such as Google Translate and Bing Translator1

are thus a great service, but the number of docu-
ments that can be submitted is restricted (Google
will even entirely stop their service in 2012) and
submitting documents means disclosing the users’
interests and their (possibly sensitive) data to the
service-providing company.

1http://translate.google.com/ and http:
//www.microsofttranslator.com/

For these reasons, we have developed our
in-house machine translation system ONTS. Its
translation results will be publicly accessible as
part of the Europe Media Monitor family of ap-
plications, (Steinberger et al., 2009), which gather
and process about 100,000 news articles per day
in about fifty languages. ONTS is based on
the open source phrase-based statistical machine
translation toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007),
trained mostly on freely available parallel cor-
pora and optimised for the news domain, as stated
above. The main objective of developing our in-
house system is thus not to improve translation
quality over the existing services (this would be
beyond our possibilities), but to offer our users a
rough translation (a “gist”) that allows them to get
an idea of the main contents of the article and to
determine whether the news item at hand is rele-
vant for their field of interest or not.

A similar news-focused translation service is
“Found in Translation” (Turchi et al., 2009),
which gathers articles in 23 languages and trans-
lates them into English. “Found in Translation” is
also based on Moses, but it categorises the news
after translation and the translation process is not
optimised for the news domain.

2 Europe Media Monitor

Europe Media Monitor (EMM)2 gathers a daily
average of 100,000 news articles in approximately
50 languages, from about 3,400 hand-selected
web news sources, from a couple of hundred spe-
cialist and government websites, as well as from
about twenty commercial news providers. It vis-
its the news web sites up to every five minutes to

search for the latest articles. When news sites of-
fer RSS feeds, it makes use of these, otherwise
it extracts the news text from the often complex
HTML pages. All news items are converted to
Unicode. They are processed in a pipeline struc-
ture, where each module adds additional informa-
tion. Independently of how files are written, the
system uses UTF-8-encoded RSS format.

Inside the pipeline, different algorithms are im-
plemented to produce monolingual and multilin-
gual clusters and to extract various types of in-
formation such as named entities, quotations, cat-
egories and more. ONTS uses two modules of
EMM: the named entity recognition and the cate-
gorization parts.

2.1 Named Entity Recognition and Variant
Matching.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is per-
formed using manually constructed language-
independent rules that make use of language-
specific lists of trigger words such as titles
(president), professions or occupations (tennis
player, playboy), references to countries, regions,
ethnic or religious groups (French, Bavarian,
Berber, Muslim), age expressions (57-year-old),
verbal phrases (deceased), modifiers (former)
and more. These patterns can also occur in
combination and patterns can be nested to capture
more complex titles, (Steinberger and Pouliquen,
2007). In order to be able to cover many different
languages, no other dictionaries and no parsers or
part-of-speech taggers are used.

To identify which of the names newly found
every day are new entities and which ones are
merely variant spellings of entities already con-
tained in the database, we apply a language-
independent name similarity measure to decide
which name variants should be automatically
merged, for details see (Pouliquen and Stein-
berger, 2009). This allows us to maintain a
database containing over 1,15 million named en-
tities and 200,000 variants. The major part of
this resource can be downloaded from http:
//langtech.jrc.it/JRC-Names.html

2.2 Category Classification across
Languages.

All news items are categorized into hundreds of
categories. Category definitions are multilingual,
created by humans and they include geographic

regions such as each country of the world, organi-
zations, themes such as natural disasters or secu-
rity, and more specific classes such as earthquake,
terrorism or tuberculosis,

Articles fall into a given category if they sat-
isfy the category definition, which consists of
Boolean operators with optional vicinity opera-
tors and wild cards. Alternatively, cumulative
positive or negative weights and a threshold can
be used. Uppercase letters in the category defi-
nition only match uppercase words, while lower-
case words in the definition match both uppercase
and lowercase words. Many categories are de-
fined with input from the users themselves. This
method to categorize the articles is rather sim-
ple and user-friendly, and it lends itself to dealing
with many languages, (Steinberger et al., 2009).

3 News Translation System

In this section, we describe our statistical machine
translation (SMT) service based on the open-
source toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and its
adaptation to translation of news items.

Which is the most suitable SMT system for
our requirements? The main goal of our system
is to help the user understand the content of an ar-
ticle. This means that a translated article is evalu-
ated positively even if it is not perfect in the target
language. Dealing with such a large number of
source languages and articles per day, our system
should take into account the translation speed, and
try to avoid using language-dependent tools such
as part-of-speech taggers.

Inside the Moses toolkit, three different
statistical approaches have been implemented:
phrase based statistical machine translation (PB-
SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrase
based statistical machine translation (Chiang,
2007) and syntax-based statistical machine trans-
lation (Marcu et al., 2006). To identify the
most suitable system for our requirements, we
run a set of experiments training the three mod-
els with Europarl V4 German-English (Koehn,
2005) and optimizing and testing on the News
corpus (Callison-Burch et al., 2009). For all of
them, we use their default configurations and they
are run under the same condition on the same ma-
chine to better evaluate translation time. For the
syntax model we use linguistic information only
on the target side. According to our experiments,
in terms of performance the hierarchical model

26



performs better than PBSMT and syntax (18.31,
18.09, 17.62 Bleu points), but in terms of transla-
tion speed PBSMT is better than hierarchical and
syntax (1.02, 4.5, 49 second per sentence). Al-
though, the hierarchical model has the best Bleu
score, we prefer to use the PBSMT system in our
translation service, because it is four times faster.

Which training data can we use? It is known
in statistical machine translation that more train-
ing data implies better translation. Although, the
number of parallel corpora has been is growing
in the last years, the amounts of training data
vary from language pair to language pair. To
train our models we use the freely available cor-
pora (when possible): Europarl (Koehn, 2005),
JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al., 2006), DGT-
TM3, Opus (Tiedemann, 2009), SE-Times (Ty-
ers and Alperen, 2010), Tehran English-Persian
Parallel Corpus (Pilevar et al., 2011), News
Corpus (Callison-Burch et al., 2009), UN Cor-
pus (Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009), CzEng0.9 (Bo-
jar and Žabokrtský, 2009), English-Persian paral-
lel corpus distributed by ELRA4 and two Arabic-
English datasets distributed by LDC5. This re-
sults in some language pairs with a large cover-
age, (more than 4 million sentences), and other
with a very small coverage, (less than 1 million).
The language models are trained using 12 model
sentences for the content model and 4.7 million
for the title model. Both sets are extracted from
English news.

For less resourced languages such as Farsi and
Turkish, we tried to extend the available corpora.
For Farsi, we applied the methodology proposed
by (Lambert et al., 2011), where we used a large
language model and an English-Farsi SMT model
to produce new sentence pairs. For Turkish we
added the Movie Subtitles corpus (Tiedemann,
2009), which allowed the SMT system to in-
crease its translation capability, but included sev-
eral slang words and spoken phrases.

How to deal with Named Entities in transla-
tion? News articles are related to the most impor-
tant events. These names need to be efficiently
translated to correctly understand the content of
an article. From an SMT point of view, two main
issues are related to Named Entity translation: (1)
such a name is not in the training data or (2) part

3http://langtech.jrc.it/DGT-TM.html
4http://catalog.elra.info/
5http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/

of the name is a common word in the target lan-
guage and it is wrongly translated, e.g. the French
name “Bruno Le Maire” which risks to be trans-
lated into English as “Bruno Mayor”. To mitigate
both the effects we use our multilingual named
entity database. In the source language, each news
item is analysed to identify possible entities; if
an entity is recognised, its correct translation into
English is retrieved from the database, and sug-
gested to the SMT system enriching the source
sentence using the xml markup option 6 in Moses.
This approach allows us to complement the train-
ing data increasing the translation capability of
our system.

How to deal with different language styles
in the news? News title writing style contains
more gerund verbs, no or few linking verbs,
prepositions and adverbs than normal sentences,
while content sentences include more preposi-
tion, adverbs and different verbal tenses. Starting
from this assumption, we investigated if this phe-
nomenon can affect the translation performance
of our system.

We trained two SMT systems, SMTcontent
and SMTtitle, using the Europarl V4 German-
English data as training corpus, and two dif-
ferent development sets: one made of content
sentences, News Commentaries (Callison-Burch
et al., 2009), and the other made of news ti-
tles in the source language which were trans-
lated into English using a commercial transla-
tion system. With the same strategy we gener-
ated also a Title test set. The SMTtitle used a
language model created using only English news
titles. The News and Title test sets were trans-
lated by both the systems. Although the perfor-
mance obtained translating the News and Title
corpora are not comparable, we were interested
in analysing how the same test set is translated
by the two systems. We noticed that translat-
ing a test set with a system that was optimized
with the same type of data resulted in almost 2
Blue score improvements: Title-TestSet: 0.3706
(SMTtitle), 0.3511 (SMTcontent); News-TestSet:
0.1768 (SMTtitle), 0.1945 (SMTcontent). This
behaviour was present also in different language
pairs. According to these results we decided
to use two different translation systems for each
language pair, one optimized using title data

and the other using normal content sentences.
Even though this implementation choice requires
more computational power to run in memory two
Moses servers, it allows us to mitigate the work-
load of each single instance reducing translation
time of each single article and to improve transla-
tion quality.

3.1 Translation Quality

To evaluate the translation performance of ONTS,
we run a set of experiments where we translate a
test set for each language pair using our system
and Google Translate. Lack of human translated
parallel titles obliges us to test only the content
based model. For German, Spanish and Czech we
use the news test sets proposed in (Callison-Burch
et al., 2010), for French and Italian the news test
sets presented in (Callison-Burch et al., 2008),
for Arabic, Farsi and Turkish, sets of 2,000 news
sentences extracted from the Arabic-English and
English-Persian datasets and the SE-Times cor-
pus. For the other languages we use 2,000 sen-
tences which are not news but a mixture of JRC-
Acquis, Europarl and DGT-TM data. It is not
guarantee that our test sets are not part of the train-
ing data of Google Translate.

Each test set is translated by Google Translate
- Translator Toolkit, and by our system. Bleu
score is used to evaluate the performance of both
systems. Results, see Table 1, show that Google
Translate produces better translation for those lan-
guages for which large amounts of data are avail-
able such as French, German, Italian and Spanish.
Surprisingly, for Danish, Portuguese and Polish,
ONTS has better performance, this depends on
the choice of the test sets which are not made of
news data but of data that is fairly homogeneous
in terms of style and genre with the training sets.

The impact of the named entity module is ev-
ident for Arabic and Farsi, where each English
suggested entity results in a larger coverage of
the source language and better translations. For
highly inflected and agglutinative languages such
as Turkish, the output proposed by ONTS is poor.
We are working on gathering more training data
coming from the news domain and on the pos-
sibility of applying a linguistic pre-processing of
the documents.

4 Technical Implementation

The translation service is made of two compo-
nents: the connection module and the Moses
server. The connection module is a servlet im-
plemented in Java. It receives the RSS files,
isolates each single news article, identifies each
source language and pre-processes it. Each news
item is split into sentences, each sentence is to-
kenized, lowercased, passed through a statisti-
cal compound word splitter, (Koehn and Knight,
2003), and the named entity annotator module.
For language modelling we use the KenLM im-
plementation, (Heafield, 2011).

According to the language, the correct Moses
servers, title and content, are fed in a multi-
thread manner. We use the multi-thread version
of Moses (Haddow, 2010). When all the sentences
of each article are translated, the inverse process
is run: they are detokenized, recased, and untrans-
lated/unknown words are listed. The translated ti-
tle and content of each article are uploaded into
the RSS file and it is passed to the next modules.

The full system including the translation mod-
ules is running in a 2xQuad-Core with In-
tel Hyper-threading Technology processors with
48GB of memory. It is our intention to locate
the Moses servers on different machines. This is
possible thanks to the high modularity and cus-
tomization of the connection module. At the mo-
ment, the translation models are available for the
following source languages: Arabic, Czech, Dan-
ish, Farsi, French, German, Italian, Polish, Por-
tuguese, Spanish and Turkish.

Figure 1: Demo Web site.

4.1 Demo

Our translation service is currently presented on
a demo web site, see Figure 1, which is available
at http://optima.jrc.it/Translate/.
News articles can be retrieved selecting one of the
topics and the language. All the topics are as-
signed to each article using the methodology de-
scribed in 2.2. These articles are shown in the left
column of the interface. When the button “Trans-
late” is pressed, the translation process starts and
the translated articles appear in the right column
of the page.

The translation system can be customized from
the interface enabling or disabling the named
entity, compound, recaser, detokenizer and un-
known word modules. Each translated article is
enriched showing the translation time in millisec-
onds per character and, if enabled, the list of un-
known words. The interface is linked to the con-
nection module and data is transferred using RSS
structure.

5 Discussion

In this paper we present the Optima News Trans-
lation System and how it is connected to Eu-
rope Media Monitor application. Different strate-
gies are applied to increase the translation perfor-
mance taking advantage of the document struc-
ture and other resources available in our research
group. We believe that the experiments described
in this work can result very useful for the develop-
ment of other similar systems. Translations pro-
duced by our system will soon be available as part
of the main EMM applications.

The performance of our system is encouraging,

but not as good as the performance of web ser-
vices such as Google Translate, mostly because
we use less training data and we have reduced
computational power. On the other hand, our in-
house system can be fed with a large number of
articles per day and sensitive data without includ-
ing third parties in the translation process. Per-
formance and translation time vary according to
the number and complexity of sentences and lan-
guage pairs.

The domain of news articles dynamically
changes according to the main events in the world,
while existing parallel data is static and usually
associated to governmental domains. It is our in-
tention to investigate how to adapt our translation
system updating the language model with the En-
glish articles of the day.
