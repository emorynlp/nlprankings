Abstract

We describe our experiments with phrase-
based machine translation for the WMT
2012 Shared Task. We trained one sys-
tem for 14 translation directions between
English or Czech on one side and English,
Czech, German, Spanish or French on the
other side. We describe a set of results
with different training data sizes and sub-
sets.

1 Introduction
With so many official languages, Europe is a
paradise for machine translation research. One
of the largest bodies of electronically available
parallel texts is being nowadays generated by
the European Union and its institutions. At the
same time, the EU also provides motivation and
boosts potential market for machine translation
outcomes.

Most of the major European languages belong
to one of three branches of the Indo-European
language family: Germanic, Romance or Slavic.
Such relatedness is responsible for many struc-
tural similarities in European languages, al-
though significant differences still exist. Within
the language portfolio selected for the WMT
shared task, English, French and Spanish seem
to be closer to each other than to the rest.

German, despite being genetically related to
English, differs in many properties. Its word or-
der rules, shifting verbs from one end of the sen-
tence to the other, easily create long-distance de-
pendencies. Long German compound words are

notorious for increasing out-of-vocabulary rate,
which has led many researchers to devising unsu-
pervised compound-splitting techniques. Also,
uppercase/lowercase distinction is more impor-
tant because all German nouns start with an
uppercase letter by the rule.

Czech is a language with rich morphology
(both inflectional and derivational) and rela-
tively free word order. In fact, the predicate-
argument structure, often encoded by fixed word
order in English, is usually captured by inflec-
tion (especially the system of 7 grammatical
cases) in Czech. While the free word order of
Czech is a problem when translating to English
(the text should be parsed first in order to de-
termine the syntactic functions and the English
word order), generating correct inflectional af-
fixes is indeed a challenge for English-to-Czech
systems. Furthermore, the multitude of possible
Czech word forms (at least order of magnitude
higher than in English) makes the data sparse-
ness problem really severe, hindering both direc-
tions.

Our goal is to run one system under as similar
conditions as possible to all fourteen translation
directions, to compare their translation accura-
cies and see why some directions are easier than
others. Future work will benefit from knowing
what are the special processing needs for a given
language pair. The current version of the system
does not include really language-specific tech-
niques: we neither split German compounds,
nor do we address the peculiarities of Czech
mentioned above.

2 The Translation System

Our translation system is built around Moses1
(Koehn et al., 2007). Two-way word align-
ment was computed using GIZA++2 (Och and
Ney, 2003), and alignment symmetrization us-
ing the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et
al., 2003). Weights of the system were optimized
using MERT (Och, 2003). No lexical reordering
model was trained.

For language modeling we use the SRILM
toolkit3 (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen
and Goodman, 1998).

3 Data and Pre-processing Pipeline

We applied our system to all the eight offi-
cial language pairs. In addition, we also ex-
perimented with translation between Czech on
one side and German, Spanish or French on
the other side. Training data for these addi-
tional language pairs were obtained by combin-
ing parallel corpora of the officially supported
pairs. For instance, to create the Czech-German
parallel corpus, we identified the intersection of
the English sides of Czech-English and English-
German corpora, respectively; then we com-
bined the corresponding Czech and German sen-
tences.

We took part in the constrained task. Un-
less explicitly stated otherwise, the translation
model in our experiments was trained on the
combined News-Commentary v7 and Europarl
v7 corpora.4 Table 1 shows the sizes of the train-
ing data.

The News Test 2010 data set5 (2489 sentences
in each language) was used as development data
for MERT. BLEU scores reported in this paper
were computed on the News Test 2012 set (3003
sentences each language). We do not use the
News Tests 2008, 2009 and 2011.

Table 1: Number of sentence pairs and tokens for
every language pair in the parallel training corpus.
Languages are identified by their ISO 639 codes: cs
= Czech, de = German, en = English, es = Spanish,
fr = French. Every line corresponds to the respective
version of EuroParl + News Commentary.

All parallel and monolingual corpora un-
derwent the same preprocessing. They were
tokenized and some characters normalized or
cleaned. A set of language-dependent heuris-
tics was applied in an attempt to restore and
normalize the directed (opening/closing) quota-
tion marks (i.e. "quoted" → “quoted”). The
motivation is twofold here: First, we hope that
paired quotation marks could occasionally work
as brackets and better denote parallel phrases
for Moses; second, if Moses learns to output di-
rected quotation marks, subsequent detokeniza-
tion will be easier.

The data are then tagged and lemmatized.
We used the Morče tagger for Czech and En-
glish lemmatization and TreeTagger for Ger-
man, Spanish and French lemmatization. All
these tools are embedded in the Treex analysis
framework (Žabokrtský et al., 2008).

The lemmas are used later to compute word
alignment. Besides, they are needed to apply
“supervised truecasing” to the data: we cast
the case of the lemma to the form, relying on
our morphological analyzers and taggers to iden-
tify proper names, all other words are lower-
cased. Note that guessing of the true case is
only needed for the sentence-initial token. Other
words can typically be left in their original form,
unless they are uppercased as a form of HIGH-
LIGHTING.

3.1 Quotation Marks

A broad range of characters is used to represent
quotation marks in the training data: straight
ASCII quotation mark; Unicode directed quo-
tation marks (U+2018 to U+201F); acute and
grave accents; math symbols such as prime and
double prime (U+2032 to U+2037) etc. Spaces
around quotes in the original untokenized text
ought to provide hints as to the direction of the
quotes (no space between the opening quote and
the next word, and no space between the clos-
ing quote and the previous word) but unfortu-
nately there are numerous cases where superflu-
ous spaces are inserted or required spaces are
missing.

Nested quoting is also possible, such as in
As the Wise Men ’ s Report also says , and

I quote : ’ It is elementary ’ common sense ’
that the Commission should have supported the
Parliament ’ s decision - making process . ’

We want all possible quotation marks con-
verted to one pair of characters. We do not mind
the distinction between single and double quotes
but we want to keep (or restore) the distinction
between opening and closing quotes. In addi-
tion, we want to identify the apostrophe acting
as grapheme in some languages, and keep it (or
normalize it, as it could also be mis-typed as
acute accent or something else):

As the Wise Men ’ s Report also says , and
I quote : “ It is elementary “ common sense ”
that the Commission should have supported the
Parliament ’ s decision - making process . ”

We attempt at solving the problem by a set
of rules that consider mutual positions of quota-
tion marks, spaces and other punctuation, and
also some language-dependent rules (especially
on the lexical apostrophe, e.g. in French d’, l’).

Our rules applied to 1.84 % of Spanish sen-
tences, 2.47 % Czech, 2.77 % German, 4.33 %
English and 16.9 % French (measured on Eu-
roparl data).

Our approach is different from the normaliza-
tion script provided and applied by the organiz-
ers of the shared task, which merely converts all
quotes to the undirected ASCII characters. We
believe that such MT output is incorrect, so we

submitted two versions of each system run: the
primary version is intended for human evalua-
tion and does not apply the “official” normaliza-
tion of punctuation. In contrast, the secondary
version is normalized, which naturally leads to
higher scores in the automatic evaluation.

4 Experiments

In the following section we describe several dif-
ferent settings and corpora combinations we ex-
perimented with. BLEU scores have been com-
puted by our system, comparing truecased tok-
enized hypothesis with truecased tokenized ref-
erence translation.

Such scores must differ from the official evalu-
ation—see Section 4.4 for discussion of the final
results.

The confidence interval for most of the scores
lies between ±0.5 and ±0.6 BLEU % points.

4.1 Baseline Experiments
The set of baseline experiments were trained on
the supervised truecased combination of News
Commentary and Europarl. As we had lem-
matizers for the languages, word alignment was
computed on lemmas. (But our previous ex-
periments showed that there was little differ-
ence between using lemmas and lowercased 4-
character “stems”.) A hexagram language model
was trained on the monolingual version of the
News Commentary + Europarl corpus (typically
a slightly larger superset of the target side of the
parallel corpus).

4.2 Larger Monolingual Data
Besides the monolingual halves of the parallel
corpora, additional monolingual data were pro-
vided / permitted:

• The Crawled News corpus from the years
2007 to 2011, various sizes for each language
and year.

• The Gigaword corpora published by the
Linguistic Data Consortium, available only
for English (4th edition), Spanish (3rd) and
French (3rd).

Due to bugs in the lemmatizers, we were not
able to process certain parts of the large corpora
in time. Table 2 gives the sizes of the subsets
available for our experiments and Table 3 com-
pares BLEU scores with large language models
against the baseline.

Table 2: Number of segments (paragraphs in Giga-
word, sentences elsewhere) and tokens of additional
monolingual training corpora. “newsc+euro” are the
monolingual versions of the News Commentary and
Europarl parallel corpora. “news.all” denotes all
years of the Crawled News corpus for the given lan-
guage.

The Crawled News corpora, in-domain and
larger than the parallel corpora by an order of
magnitude, turned out to help significantly im-
prove the scores of all language pairs. On the
other hand, and to our surprise, we were not
able to achieve any further improvement by us-
ing the Gigaword corpora. Taking into account
the extra requirements on memory when build-
ing such big language models, this makes the
usefulness of Gigaword questionable. We have
no plausible explanation at the moment.

4.3 Larger Parallel Data
Even stranger behavior was observed when
adding the large UN parallel corpus (over 10
million sentence pairs). When used separately
(even for language model) it decreased BLEU
significantly, which could be explained by dif-
ferent domain. When used together with News

Table 3: BLEU scores of the baseline experiments
(left column) on News Test 2012 data, computed by
the system on tokenized data, versus similar setup
with large monolingual corpus (news.all, middle col-
umn). Gigaword never brought significant improve-
ment.

Commentary and Europarl, and with a language
model trained on the Crawled News corpus, it
barely outperformed the same setting without
the UN corpus.6 However, the es-en direction is
a notable exception where the UN corpus alone
gave by far the best score. See Table 4 for de-
tails.

We failed to lemmatize the giga French-
English corpus in time, so we do not present
any results with that corpus.

4.4 Final Results
Table 5 compares our BLEU scores with those
computed at matrix.statmt.org.

BLEU (without flag) denotes BLEU score
computed by our system, comparing truecased
tokenized hypothesis with truecased tokenized
reference translation.

The official evaluation by matrix.statmt.
org gives typically lower numbers, reflecting the
loss caused by detokenization and new (differ-
ent) tokenization.

6One of the anonymous reviewers mentioned that the
quality of the UN corpus is relatively low. That could
explain our observations.

4.5 Efficiency
The baseline experiments were conducted
mostly on 64bit AMD Opteron quad-core
2.8 GHz CPUs with 32 GB RAM (decoding
run on 15 machines in parallel) and the whole
pipeline typically required between a half and a
whole day.

However, we used machines with up to 500 GB
RAM to train the large language models and
translation models. Aligning the UN corpora
with Giza++ took around 5 days.

5 Conclusion
We have described the Moses-based SMT system
we used for the WMT 2012 shared task. We
discussed experiments with large data for many
language pairs from the point of view of both
the translation accuracy and efficiency. We were
unable to process all data that was available;
even the experiments where we did use larger
data did not outperform the smaller experiments
significantly. Nevertheless, using the Crawled
News monolingual corpus proved essential.
