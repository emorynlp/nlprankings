Abstract

This paper develops a minimally supervised
approach, based on focused distributional sim-
ilarity methods and discourse connectives,
for identifying of causality relations between
events in context. While it has been shown
that distributional similarity can help identify-
ing causality, we observe that discourse con-
nectives and the particular discourse relation
they evoke in context provide additional in-
formation towards determining causality be-
tween events. We show that combining dis-
course relation predictions and distributional
similarity methods in a global inference pro-
cedure provides additional improvements to-
wards determining event causality.

1 Introduction

An important part of text understanding arises from
understanding the semantics of events described in
the narrative, such as identifying the events that are
mentioned and how they are related semantically.
For instance, when given a sentence “The police
arrested him because he killed someone.”, humans
understand that there are two events, triggered by
the words “arrested” and “killed”, and that there is
a causality relationship between these two events.
Besides being an important component of discourse
understanding, automatically identifying causal re-
lations between events is important for various nat-
ural language processing (NLP) applications such
as question answering, etc. In this work, we auto-
matically detect and extract causal relations between
events in text.

Despite its importance, prior work on event
causality extraction in context in the NLP litera-
ture is relatively sparse. In (Girju, 2003), the au-
thor used noun-verb-noun lexico-syntactic patterns
to learn that “mosquitoes cause malaria”, where the
cause and effect mentions are nominals and not nec-
essarily event evoking words. In (Sun et al., 2007),
the authors focused on detecting causality between
search query pairs in temporal query logs. (Beamer
and Girju, 2009) tried to detect causal relations be-
tween verbs in a corpus of screen plays, but limited
themselves to consecutive, or adjacent verb pairs.
In (Riaz and Girju, 2010), the authors first cluster
sentences into topic-specific scenarios, and then fo-
cus on building a dataset of causal text spans, where
each span is headed by a verb. Thus, their focus was
not on identifying causal relations between events in
a given text document.

In this paper, given a text document, we first iden-
tify events and their associated arguments. We then
identify causality or relatedness relations between
event pairs. To do this, we develop a minimally su-
pervised approach using focused distributional sim-
ilarity methods, such as co-occurrence counts of
events collected automatically from an unannotated
corpus, to measure and predict existence of causal-
ity relations between event pairs. Then, we build on
the observation that discourse connectives and the
particular discourse relation they evoke in context
provide additional information towards determining
causality between events. For instance, in the ex-
ample sentence provided at the beginning of this
section, the words “arrested” and “killed” probably
have a relatively high apriori likelihood of being ca-

294



sually related. However, knowing that the connec-
tive “because” evokes a contingency discourse re-
lation between the text spans “The police arrested
him” and “he killed someone” provides further ev-
idence towards predicting causality. The contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized below:

• Our focus is on identifying causality between
event pairs in context. Since events are of-
ten triggered by either verbs (e.g. “attack”) or
nouns (e.g. “explosion”), we allow for detec-
tion of causality between verb-verb, verb-noun,
and noun-noun triggered event pairs. To the
best of our knowledge, this formulation of the
task is novel.

• We developed a minimally supervised ap-
proach for the task using focused distributional
similarity methods that are automatically col-
lected from an unannotated corpus. We show
that our approach achieves better performance
than two approaches: one based on a frequently
used metric that measures association, and an-
other based on the effect-control-dependency
(ECD) metric described in a prior work (Riaz
and Girju, 2010).

• We leverage on the interactions between event
causality prediction and discourse relations
prediction. We combine these knowledge
sources through a global inference procedure,
which we formalize via an Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (ILP) framework as a constraint op-
timization problem (Roth and Yih, 2004). This
allows us to easily define appropriate con-
straints to ensure that the causality and dis-
course predictions are coherent with each other,
thereby improving the performance of causality
identification.

2 Event Causality

In this work, we define an event as an action or oc-
currence that happens with associated participants
or arguments. Formally, we define an event e
as: p(a1, a2, . . . , an), where the predicate p is the
word that triggers the presence of e in text, and
a1, a2, . . . , an are the arguments associated with
e. Examples of predicates could be verbs such as
“attacked”, “employs”, nouns such as “explosion”,

“protest”, etc., and examples of the arguments of
“attacked” could be its subject and object nouns.

To measure the causality association between a
pair of events ei and ej (in general, ei and ej
could be extracted from the same or different doc-
uments), we should use information gathered about
their predicates and arguments. A simple approach
would be to directly calculate the pointwise mu-
tual information (PMI)1 between pi(ai1, a

i
2, . . . , a

i
n)

and pj(aj1, a
j
2, . . . , a

j
m). However, this leads to very

sparse counts as the predicate pi with its list of ar-
guments ai1, . . . , a

i
n would rarely co-occur (within

some reasonable context distance) with predicate pj

and its entire list of arguments aj1, . . . , a
j
m. Hence,

in this work, we measure causality association us-
ing three separate components and focused distribu-
tional similarity methods collected about event pairs
as described in the rest of this section.

2.1 Cause-Effect Association

We measure the causality or cause-effect association
(CEA) between two events ei and ej using the fol-
lowing equation:

CEA(ei, ej) =

spp(ei, ej) + spa(ei, ej) + saa(ei, ej) (1)

where spp measures the association between event
predicates, spa measures the association between the
predicate of an event and the arguments of the other
event, and saa measures the association between
event arguments. In our work, we regard each event
e as being triggered and rooted at a predicate p.

2.1.1 Predicate-Predicate Association
We define spp as follows:

spp(ei, ej) = PMI(p
i, pj)×max(ui, uj)

×IDF (pi, pj)×Dist(pi, pj) (2)

which takes into account the PMI between pred-
icates pi and pj of events ei and ej respectively,
as well as various other pieces of information. In
Suppes’ Probabilistic theory of Casuality (Suppes,
1970), he highlighted that event e is a possible cause
of event e′, if e′ happens more frequently with e than

1PMI is frequently used to measure association between
variables.

295



by itself, i.e. P (e′|e) > P (e′). This can be easily
rewritten as P (e,e

′)
P (e)P (e′) > 1, similar to the definition

of PMI:

PMI(e, e′) = log
P (e, e′)
P (e)P (e′)

which is only positive when P (e,e
′)

P (e)P (e′) > 1.
Next, we build on the intuition that event predi-

cates appearing in a large number of documents are
probably not important or discriminative. Thus, we
penalize these predicates when calculating spp by
adopting the inverse document frequency (idf):

IDF (pi, pj) = idf(pi)× idf(pj)× idf(pi, pj),

where idf(p) = log D1+N , D is the total number of
documents in the collection and N is the number of
documents that p occurs in.

We also award event pairs that are closer together,
while penalizing event pairs that are further apart in
texts, by incorporating the distance measure of Lea-
cock and Chodorow (1998), which was originally
used to measure similarity between concepts:

Dist(pi, pj) = −log |sent(p
i)− sent(pj)|+ 1
2× ws ,

where sent(p) gives the sentence number (index) in
which p occurs and ws indicates the window-size
(of sentences) used. If pi and pj are drawn from the
same sentence, the numerator of the above fraction
will return 1. In our work, we set ws to 3 and thus,
if pi occurs in sentence k, the furthest sentence that
pj will be drawn from, is sentence k + 2.

The final component of Equation 2, max(ui, uj),
takes into account whether predicates (events) pi and
pj appear most frequently with each other. ui and uj

are defined as follows:

ui =
P (pi, pj)

maxk[P (pi, pk)]− P (pi, pj) + �

uj =
P (pi, pj)

maxk[P (pk, pj)]− P (pi, pj) + �
,

where we set � = 0.01 to avoid zeros in the denom-
inators. ui will be maximized if there is no other
predicate pk having a higher co-occurrence proba-
bility with pi, i.e. pk = pj . uj is treated similarly.

2.1.2 Predicate-Argument and
Argument-Argument Association

We define spa as follows:

spa(ei, ej) =
1

|Aej |
∑

a∈Aej

PMI(pi, a)

+
1

|Aei |
∑

a∈Aei

PMI(pj , a), (3)

where Aei and Aej are the sets of arguments of ei
and ej respectively.

Finally, we define saa as follows:

saa(ei, ej) =
1

|Aei ||Aej |
∑

a∈Aei

∑

a′∈Aej

PMI(a, a′) (4)

Together, spa and saa provide additional contexts
and robustness (in addition to spp) for measuring the
cause-effect association between events ei and ej .

Our formulation of CEA is inspired by the ECD
metric defined in (Riaz and Girju, 2010):

ECD(a, b) = max(v, w)×−log dis(a, b)
2×maxDistance , (5)

where

v =
P (a, b)

P (b)− P (a, b) + � ×
P (a, b)

maxt[P (a, bt)]− P (a, b) + �

w=
P (a, b)

P (a)− P (a, b) + � ×
P (a, b)

maxt[P (at, b)]− P (a, b) + �
,

where ECD(a,b) measures the causality between two
events a and b (headed by verbs), and the sec-
ond component in the ECD equation is similar to
Dist(pi, pj). In our experiments, we will evaluate
the performance of ECD against our proposed ap-
proach.

So far, our definitions in this section are generic
and allow for any list of event argument types. In
this work, we focus on two argument types: agent
(subject) and patient (object), which are typical core
arguments of any event. We describe how we extract
event predicates and their associated arguments in
the section below.

3 Verbal and Nominal Predicates

We consider that events are not only triggered by
verbs but also by nouns. For a verb (verbal predi-
cate), we extract its subject and object from its as-
sociated dependency parse. On the other hand, since

296



events are also frequently triggered by nominal pred-
icates, it is important to identify an appropriate list
of event triggering nouns. In our work, we gathered
such a list using the following approach:

• We first gather a list of deverbal nouns from the
set of most frequently occurring (in the Giga-
word corpus) 3,000 verbal predicate types. For
each verb type v, we go through all its Word-
Net2 senses and gather all its derivationally re-
lated nouns Nv 3.

• From Nv, we heuristically remove nouns that
are less than three characters in length. We also
remove nouns whose first three characters are
different from the first three characters of v. For
each of the remaining nouns in Nv, we mea-
sured its Levenstein (edit) distance from v and
keep the noun(s) with the minimum distance.
When multiple nouns have the same minimum
distance from v, we keep all of them.

• To further prune the list of nouns, we next re-
moved all nouns ending in “er”, “or”, or “ee”,
as these nouns typically refer to a person, e.g.
“writer”, “doctor”, “employee”. We also re-
move nouns that are not hyponyms (children)
of the first WordNet sense of the noun “event”4.

• Since we are concerned with nouns denoting
events, FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010)
(FN) is a good resource for mining such nouns.
FN consists of frames denoting situations and
events. As part of the FN resource, each FN
frame consists of a list of lexical units (mainly
verbs and nouns) representing the semantics of
the frame. Various frame-to-frame relations are
also defined (in particular the inheritance re-
lation). Hence, we gathered all the children
frames of the FN frame “Event”. From these
children frames, we then gathered all their noun
lexical units (words) and add them to our list of

2http://wordnet.princeton.edu/
3The WordNet resource provides derivational information

on words that are in different syntactic (i.e. part-of-speech) cat-
egories, but having the same root (lemma) form and that are
semantically related.

4The first WordNet sense of the noun “event” has the mean-
ing: “something that happens at a given place and time”

nouns. Finally, we also add a few nouns denot-
ing natural disaster from Wikipedia5.

Using the above approach, we gathered a list of
about 2,000 noun types. This current approach is
heuristics based which we intend to improve in the
future, and any such improvements should subse-
quently improve the performance of our causality
identification approach.

Event triggering deverbal nouns could have as-
sociated arguments (for instance, acting as subject,
object of the deverbal noun). To extract these ar-
guments, we followed the approach of (Gurevich
et al., 2008). Briefly, the approach uses linguistic
patterns to extract subjects and objects for deverbal
nouns, using information from dependency parses.
For more details, we refer the reader to (Gurevich et
al., 2008).

4 Discourse and Causality

Discourse connectives are important for relating dif-
ferent text spans, helping us to understand a piece of
text in relation to its context:
[The police arrested him] because [he killed someone].

In the example sentence above, the discourse con-
nective (“because”) and the discourse relation it
evokes (in this case, the Cause relation) allows read-
ers to relate its two associated text spans, “The po-
lice arrested him” and “he killed someone”. Also,
notice that the verbs “arrested” and “killed”, which
cross the two text spans, are causally related. To
aid in extracting causal relations, we leverage on the
identification of discourse relations to provide addi-
tional contextual information.

To identify discourse relations, we use the Penn
Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2007),
which contains annotations of discourse relations
in context. The annotations are done over the
Wall Street Journal corpus and the PDTB adopts a
predicate-argument view of discourse relations. A
discourse connective (e.g. because) takes two text
spans as its arguments. In the rest of this section,
we briefly describe the discourse relations in PDTB
and highlight how we might leverage them to aid in
determining event causality.

Coarse-grained relations Fine-grained relations

Contingency Cause, Condition, Pragmatic-cause, Pragmatic-condition
Expansion Alternative, Conjunction, Exception, Instantiation, List, Restatement
Temporal Asynchronous, Synchronous

Table 1: Coarse-grained and fine-grained discourse relations.

4.1 Discourse Relations

PDTB contains annotations for four coarse-grained
discourse relation types, as shown in the left column
of Table 1. Each of these are further refined into
several fine-grained discourse relations, as shown in
the right column of the table.6 Next, we briefly de-
scribe these relations, highlighting those that could
potentially help to determine event causality.

Comparison A Comparison discourse relation
between two text spans highlights prominent differ-
ences between the situations described in the text
spans. An example sentence is:
Contrast: [According to the survey, x% of Chinese Inter-
net users prefer Google] whereas [y% prefer Baidu].

According to the PDTB annotation manual
(Prasad et al., 2007), the truth of both spans is in-
dependent of the established discourse relation. This
means that the text spans are not causally related and
thus, the existence of a Comparison relation should
imply that there is no causality relation across the
two text spans.

Contingency A Contingency relation between
two text spans indicates that the situation described
in one text span causally influences the situation in
the other. An example sentence is:
Cause: [The first priority is search and rescue] because
[many people are trapped under the rubble].

Existence of a Contingency relation potentially
implies that there exists at least one causal event
pair crossing the two text spans. The PDTB an-
notation manual states that while the Cause and
Condition discourse relations indicate casual influ-
ence in their text spans, there is no causal in-
fluence in the text spans of the Pragmatic-cause
and Pragmatic-condition relations. For instance,
Pragmatic-condition indicates that one span pro-

6PDTB further refines these fine-grained relations into a fi-
nal third level of relations, but we do not use them in this work.

vides the context in which the description of the sit-
uation in the other span is relevant; for example:
Pragmatic-condition: If [you are thirsty], [there’s beer in
the fridge].

Hence, there is a need to also identify fine-grained
discourse relations.

Expansion Connectives evoking Expansion dis-
course relations expand the discourse, such as by
providing additional information, illustrating alter-
native situations, etc. An example sentence is:
Conjunction: [Over the past decade, x women were
killed] and [y went missing].

Most of the Expansion fine-grained relations (ex-
cept for Conjunction, which could connect arbitrary
pieces of text spans) should not contain causality re-
lations across its text spans.

Temporal These indicate that the situations de-
scribed in the text spans are related temporally. An
example sentence is:
Synchrony: [He was sitting at his home] when [the whole
world started to shake].

Temporal precedence of the (cause) event over the
(effect) event is a necessary, but not sufficient req-
uisite for causality. Hence by itself, Temporal re-
lations are probably not discriminative enough for
determining event causality.

4.2 Discourse Relation Extraction System

Our work follows the approach and features de-
scribed in the state-of-the-art Ruby-based discourse
system of (Lin et al., 2010), to build an in-
house Java-based discourse relation extraction sys-
tem. Our system identifies explicit connectives in
text, predict their discourse relations, as well as their
associated text spans. Similar to (Lin et al., 2010),
we achieved a competitive performance of slightly
over 80% F1-score in identifying fine-grained rela-
tions for explicit connectives. Our system is devel-
oped using the Learning Based Java modeling lan-

298



guage (LBJ) (Rizzolo and Roth, 2010) and will be
made available soon. Due to space constraints, we
refer interested readers to (Lin et al., 2010) for de-
tails on the features, etc.

In the example sentences given thus far in this sec-
tion, all the connectives were explicit, as they appear
in the texts. PDTB also provides annotations for im-
plicit connectives, which we do not use in this work.
Identifying implicit connectives is a harder task and
incorporating these is a possible future work.

5 Joint Inference for Causality Extraction

To exploit the interactions between event pair
causality extraction and discourse relation identifi-
cation, we define appropriate constraints between
them, which can be enforced through the Con-
strained Conditional Models framework (aka ILP for
NLP) (Roth and Yih, 2007; Chang et al., 2008). In
doing this, the predictions of CEA (Section 2.1) and
the discourse system are forced to cohere with each
other. More importantly, this should improve the
performance of using only CEA to extract causal
event pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this ap-
proach for causality extraction is novel.

5.1 CEA & Discourse: Implementation Details

Let E denote the set of event mentions in a docu-
ment. Let EP = {(ei, ej) ∈ E × E | ei ∈ E , ej ∈
E , i < j, |sent(ei) − sent(ej)| ≤ 2} denote the
set of event mention pairs in the document, where
sent(e) gives the sentence number in which event e
occurs. Note that in this work, we only extract event
pairs that are at most two sentences apart. Next, we
define LER = {“causal”, “¬ causal”} to be the set of
event relation labels that an event pair ep ∈ EP can
be associated with.

Note that the CEA metric as defined in Section 2.1
simply gives a score without it being bounded to be
between 0 and 1.0. However, to use the CEA score
as part of the inference process, we require that it be
bounded and thus can be used as a binary prediction,
that is, predicting an event pair as causal or ¬causal.
To enable this, we use a few development documents
to automatically find a threshold CEA score that sep-
arates scores indicating causal vs ¬causal. Based
on this threshold, the original CEA scores are then
rescaled to fall within 0 to 1.0. More details on this

are in Section 6.2.
Let C denote the set of connective mentions in a

document. We slightly modify our discourse sys-
tem as follows. We define LDR to be the set of
discourse relations. We initially add all the fine-
grained discourse relations listed in Table 1 to LDR.
In the PDTB corpus, some connective examples are
labeled with just a coarse-grained relation, with-
out further specifying a fine-grained relation. To
accommodate these examples, we add the coarse-
grained relations Comparison, Expansion, and Tem-
poral to LDR. We omit the coarse-grained Con-
tingency relation from LDR, as we want to sepa-
rate Cause and Condition from Pragmatic-cause and
Pragmatic-condition. This discards very few exam-
ples as only a very small number of connective ex-
amples are simply labeled with a Contingency label
without further specifying a fine-grained label. We
then retrained our discourse system to predict labels
in LDR.

5.2 Constraints
We now describe the constraints used to support
joint inference, based on the predictions of the CEA
metric and the discourse classifier. Let sc(dr) be
the probability that connective c is predicated to be
of discourse relation dr, based on the output of our
discourse classifier. Let sep(er) be the CEA pre-
diction score (rescaled to range in [0,1]) that event
pair ep takes on the causal or ¬causal label er. Let
x〈c,dr〉 be a binary indicator variable which takes on
the value 1 iff c is labeled with the discourse relation
dr. Similarly, let y〈ep,er〉 be a binary variable which
takes on the value 1 iff ep is labeled as er. We then
define our objective function as follows:

max
[
|LDR|

∑

c∈C

∑

dr∈LDR
sc(dr) · x〈c,dr〉

+|LER|
∑

ep∈EP

∑

er∈LER
sep(er) · y〈ep,er〉

]
(6)

subject to the following constraints:
∑

dr∈LDR
x〈c,dr〉 = 1 ∀c ∈ C (7)

∑

er∈LER
y〈ep,er〉 = 1 ∀ep ∈ EP (8)

x〈c,dr〉 ∈ {0, 1} ∀c ∈ C, dr ∈ LDR (9)
y〈ep,er〉 ∈ {0, 1} ∀ep ∈ EP, er ∈ LER(10)

299



Equation (7) requires that each connective c can
only be assigned one discourse relation. Equation
(8) requires that each event pair ep can only be
causal or ¬causal. Equations (9) and (10) indicate
that x〈c,dr〉 and y〈ep,er〉 are binary variables.

To capture the relationship between event pair
causality and discourse relations, we use the follow-
ing constraints:

x〈c,“Cause”〉 ≤
∑

ep∈EPc
y〈ep,“causal”〉 (11)

x〈c,“Condition”〉 ≤
∑

ep∈EPc
y〈ep,“causal”〉, (12)

where both equations are defined ∀c ∈ C. EPc is
defined to be the set of event pairs that cross the two
text spans associated with c. For instance, if the first
text span of c contains two event mentions ei, ej ,
and there is one event mention ek in the second text
span of c, then EPc = {(ei, ek), (ej , ek)}. Finally,
the logical form of Equation (11) can be written as:
x〈c,“Cause”〉 ⇒ y〈epi,“causal”〉 ∨ . . . ∨ y〈epj ,“causal”〉,
where epi, . . . , epj are elements in EPc. This states
that if we assign the Cause discourse label to c,
then at least one of epi, . . . , epj must be assigned as
causal. The interpretation of Equation (12) is simi-
lar.

We use two more constraints to capture the inter-
actions between event causality and discourse rela-
tions. First, we defined Cep as the set of connectives
c enclosing each event of ep in each of its text spans,
i.e.: one of the text spans of c contain one of the
event in ep, while the other text span of c contain the
other event in ep. Next, based on the discourse rela-
tions in Section 4.1, we propose that when an event
pair ep is judged to be causal, then the connective
c that encloses it should be evoking one of the dis-
course relations in LDRa = {“Cause”, “Condition”,
“Temporal”, “Asynchronous”, “Synchrony”, “Con-
junction”}. We capture this using the following con-
straint:

y〈ep,“causal”〉 ≤
∑

dra∈LDRa

x〈c,dra〉 ∀c ∈ Cep (13)

The logical form of Equation (13) can be written as:
y〈ep,“causal”〉 ⇒ x〈c,“Cause”〉 ∨ x〈c,“Condition”〉 . . . ∨
x〈c,“Conjunction”〉. This states that if we assign ep as
causal, then we must assign to c one of the labels in
LDRa .

Finally, we propose that for any connectives evok-
ing discourse relations LDRb = {“Comparison”,
“Concession”, “Contrast”, “Pragmatic-concession”,
“Pragmatic-contrast”, “Expansion”, “Alternative”,
“Exception”, “Instantiation”, “List”, “Restate-
ment”}, any event pair(s) that it encloses should be
¬causal. We capture this using the following con-
straint:

x〈c,drb〉 ≤ y〈ep,“¬causal”〉
∀ drb ∈ LDRb , ep ∈ EPc, (14)

where the logical form of Equation (14) can be writ-
ten as: x〈c,drb〉 ⇒ y〈ep,“¬causal”〉.

6 Experiments

6.1 Experimental Settings
To collect the distributional statistics for measuring
CEA as defined in Equation (1), we applied part-
of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and dependency
parsing (Marneffe et al., 2006) on about 760K docu-
ments in the English Gigaword corpus (LDC catalog
number LDC2003T05).

We are not aware of any benchmark corpus for
evaluating event causality extraction in contexts.
Hence, we created an evaluation corpus using the
following process: Using news articles collected
from CNN7 during the first three months of 2010, we
randomly selected 20 articles (documents) as evalu-
ation data, and 5 documents as development data.

Two annotators annotated the documents for
causal event pairs, using two simple notions for
causality: the Cause event should temporally pre-
cede the Effect event, and the Effect event occurs be-
cause the Cause event occurs. However, sometimes
it is debatable whether two events are involved in a
causal relation, or whether they are simply involved
in an uninteresting temporal relation. Hence, we al-
lowed annotations of C to indicate causality, and R
to indicate relatedness (for situations when the exis-
tence of causality is debatable). The annotators will
simply identify and annotate the C or R relations be-
tween predicates of event pairs. Event arguments are
not explicitly annotated, although the annotators are
free to look at the entire document text while mak-
ing their annotation decisions. Finally, they are free

to annotate relations between predicates that have
any number of sentences in between and are not re-
stricted to a fixed sentence window-size.

After adjudication, we obtained a total of 492
C+R relation annotations, and 414C relation anno-
tations on the evaluation documents. On the devel-
opment documents, we obtained 92 C+R and 71 C
relation annotations. The annotators overlapped on
10 evaluation documents. On these documents, the
first (second) annotator annotated 215 (199) C + R
relations, agreeing on 166 of these relations. To-
gether, they annotated 248 distinct relations. Us-
ing this number, their agreement ratio would be 0.67
(166/248). The corresponding agreement ratio for
C relations is 0.58. These numbers highlight that
causality identification is a difficult task, as there
could be as many as N2 event pairs in a document
(N is the number of events in the document). We
plan to make this annotated dataset available soon.8

6.2 Evaluation

As mentioned in Section 5.1, to enable translat-
ing (the unbounded) CEA scores into binary causal,
¬causal predictions, we need to rescale or calibrate
these scores to range in [0,1]. To do this, we first
rank all the CEA scores of all event pairs in the de-
velopment documents. Most of these event pairs will
be ¬causal. Based on the relation annotations in
these development documents, we scanned through

this ranked list of scores to locate the CEA score
t that gives the highest F1-score (on the develop-
ment documents) when used as a threshold between
causal vs ¬causal decisions. We then ranked all
the CEA scores of all event pairs gathered from the
760K Gigaword documents, discretized all scores
higher than t into B bins, and all scores lower than
t into B bins. Together, these 2B bins represent the
range [0,1]. We used B = 500. Thus, consecu-
tive bins represent a difference of 0.001 in calibrated
scores.

To measure the causality between a pair of
events ei and ej , a simple baseline is to calculate
PMI(pi, pj). Using a similar thresholding and cali-
bration process to translate PMI(pi, pj) scores into
binary causality decisions, we obtained a F1 score of
23.1 when measured over the causality C relations,
as shown in the row PMIpp of Table 2.

As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, Riaz and Girju
(2010) proposed the ECD metric to measure
causality between two events. Thus, as a point of
comparison, we replaced spp of Equation (1) with
ECD(a, b) of Equation (5), substituting a = pi and
b = pj . After thresholding and calibrating the scores
of this approach, we obtained a F1-score of 29.7, as
shown in the row ECDpp&PMIpa,aa of Table 2.

Next, we evaluated our proposed CEA approach
and obtained a F1-score of 38.6, as shown in the row
CEA of Table 2. Thus, our proposed approach ob-
tained significantly better performance than the PMI
baseline and the ECD approach. Next, we per-
formed joint inference with the discourse relation
predictions as described in Section 5 and obtained

an improved F1-score of 41.7. We note that we ob-
tained improvements in both recall and precision.
This means that with the aid of discourse relations,
we are able to recover more causal relations, as well
as reduce false-positive predictions.

Constraint Equations (11) and (12) help to re-
cover causal relations. For improvements in pre-
cision, as stated in the last paragraph of Section
5.2, identifying other discourse relations such as
“Comparison”, “Contrast”, etc., provides counter-
evidence to causality. Together with constraint
Equation (14), this helps to eliminate false-positive
event pairs as classified by CEA and contributes
towards CEA+Discourse having a higher precision
than CEA.

The corresponding results for extracting both
causality and relatedness C + R relations are given
in Table 3. For these experiments, the aim was for a
more relaxed evaluation and we simply collapsed C
and R into a single label.

Finally, we also measured the precision of the
top K causality C predictions, showing the preci-
sion trends in Figure 1. As shown, CEA in general
achieves higher precision when compared toPMIpp
and ECDpp&PMIpa,aa. The trends for C+R pre-
dictions are similar.

Thus far, we had included both verbal and nom-
inal predicates in our evaluation. When we repeat
the experiments for ECDpp&PMIpa,aa and CEA
on just verbal predicates, we obtained the respective
F1-scores of 31.8 and 38.3 on causality relations.
The corresponding F1-scores for casuality and relat-
edness relations are 35.7 and 43.3. These absolute
F1-scores are similar to those in Tables 2 and 3, dif-
fering by 1-2%.

7 Analysis

We randomly selected 50 false-positive predictions
and 50 false-negative causality relations to analyze
the mistakes made by CEA.

Among the false-positives (precision errors), the
most frequent error type (56% of the errors) is that
CEA simply assigns a high score to event pairs that
are not causal; more knowledge sources are required
to support better predictions in these cases. The next
largest group of error (22%) involves events contain-
ing pronouns (e.g. “he”, “it”) as arguments. Ap-

plying coreference to replace these pronouns with
their canonical entity strings or labeling them with
semantic class information might be useful.

Among the false-negatives (recall errors), 23%
of the errors are due to CEA simply assigning a
low score to causal event pairs and more contex-
tual knowledge seems necessary for better predic-
tions. 19% of the recall errors arises from causal
event pairs involving nominal predicates that are not
in our list of event evoking noun types (described in
Section 3). A related 17% of recall errors involves
nominal predicates without any argument. For these,
less information is available for CEA to make pre-
dictions. The remaining group (15% of errors) in-
volves events containing pronouns as arguments.

8 Related Work

Although prior work in event causality extraction
in context is relatively sparse, there are many prior
works concerning other semantic aspects of event
extraction. Ji and Grishman (2008) extracts event
mentions (belonging to a predefined list of target
event types) and their associated arguments. In other
prior work (Chen et al., 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu,
2010), the authors focused on identifying another
type of event pair semantic relation: event corefer-
ence. Chambers and Jurafsky (2008; 2009) chain
events sharing a common (protagonist) participant.
They defined events as verbs and given an existing
chain of events, they predict the next likely event in-
volving the protagonist. This is different from our
task of detecting causality between arbitrary event
pairs that might or might not share common argu-
ments. Also, we defined events more broadly, as
those that are triggered by either verbs or nouns. Fi-
nally, although our proposed CEA metric has resem-
blance the ECD metric in (Riaz and Girju, 2010), our
task is different from theirs and our work differs in
many aspects. They focused on building a dataset of
causal text spans, whereas we focused on identifying
causal relations between events in a given text doc-
ument. They considered text spans headed by verbs
while we considered events triggered by both verbs
and nouns. Moreover, we combined event causality
prediction and discourse relation prediction through
a global inference procedure to further improve the
performance of event causality prediction.

9 Conclusion

In this paper, using general tools such as the depen-
dency and discourse parsers which are not trained
specifically towards our target task, and a minimal
set of development documents for threshold tuning,
we developed a minimally supervised approach to
identify causality relations between events in con-
text. We also showed how to incorporate discourse
relation predictions to aid event causality predictions
through a global inference procedure. There are sev-
eral interesting directions for future work, including
the incorporation of other knowledge sources such
as coreference and semantic class predictions, which
were shown to be potentially important in our er-
ror analysis. We could also use discourse relations
to aid in extracting other semantic relations between
events.
