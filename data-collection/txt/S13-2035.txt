Abstract

In this paper we describe our Semeval-2013
task on Word Sense Induction and Dis-
ambiguation within an end-user application,
namely Web search result clustering and diver-
sification. Given a target query, induction and
disambiguation systems are requested to clus-
ter and diversify the search results returned by
a search engine for that query. The task en-
ables the end-to-end evaluation and compari-
son of systems.

1 Introduction

Word ambiguity is a pervasive issue in Natural Lan-
guage Processing. Two main techniques in compu-
tational lexical semantics, i.e., Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) and Word Sense Induction (WSI)
address this issue from different perspectives: the
former is aimed at assigning word senses from a pre-
defined sense inventory to words in context, whereas
the latter automatically identifies the meanings of a
word of interest by clustering the contexts in which
it occurs (see (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012) for a
survey).

Unfortunately, the paradigms of both WSD and
WSI suffer from significant issues which hamper
their success in real-world applications. In fact, the
performance of WSD systems depends heavily on
which sense inventory is chosen. For instance, the
most popular computational lexicon of English, i.e.,
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides fine-grained
distinctions which make the disambiguation task
quite difficult even for humans (Edmonds and Kil-
garriff, 2002; Snyder and Palmer, 2004), although

disagreements can be solved to some extent with
graph-based methods (Navigli, 2008). On the other
hand, although WSI overcomes this issue by allow-
ing unrestrained sets of senses, its evaluation is par-
ticularly arduous because there is no easy way of
comparing and ranking different representations of
senses. In fact, all the proposed measures in the lit-
erature tend to favour specific cluster shapes (e.g.,
singletons or all-in-one clusters) of the senses pro-
duced as output. Indeed, WSI evaluation is actually
an instance of the more general and difficult problem
of evaluating clustering algorithms.

Nonetheless, many everyday tasks carried out by
online users would benefit from intelligent systems
able to address the lexical ambiguity issue effec-
tively. A case in point is Web information retrieval, a
task which is becoming increasingly difficult given
the continuously growing pool of Web text of the
most wildly disparate kinds. Recent work has ad-
dressed this issue by proposing a general evaluation
framework for injecting WSI into Web search result
clustering and diversification (Navigli and Crisa-
fulli, 2010; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013). In this
task the search results returned by a search engine
for an input query are grouped into clusters, and di-
versified by providing a reranking which maximizes
the meaning heterogeneity of the top ranking results.

The Semeval-2013 task described in this paper1

adopts the evaluation framework of Di Marco and
Navigli (2013), and extends it to both WSD and WSI
systems. The task is aimed at overcoming the well-
known limitations of in vitro evaluations, such as
those of previous SemEval tasks on the topic (Agirre

193



and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar et al., 2010), and en-
abling a fair comparison between the two disam-
biguation paradigms. Key to our framework is the
assumption that search results grouped into a given
cluster are semantically related to each other and
that each cluster is expected to represent a specific
meaning of the input query (even though it is possi-
ble for more than one cluster to represent the same
meaning). For instance, consider the target query
apple and the following 3 search result snippets:

1. Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is...

2. The science of apple growing is called pomology...

3. Apple designs and creates iPod and iTunes...

Participating systems were requested to produce a
clustering that groups snippets conveying the same
meaning of the input query apple, i.e., ideally {1, 3}
and {2} in the above example.

2 Task setup

For each ambiguous query the task required partic-
ipating systems to cluster the top ranking snippets
returned by a search engine (we used the Google
Search API). WSI systems were required to iden-
tify the meanings of the input query and cluster the
snippets into semantically-related groups according
to their meanings. Instead, WSD systems were re-
quested to sense-tag the given snippets with the ap-
propriate senses of the input query, thereby implic-
itly determining a clustering of snippets (i.e., one
cluster per sense).

2.1 Dataset
We created a dataset of 100 ambiguous queries.
The queries were randomly sampled from the AOL
search logs so as to ensure that they had been used in
real search sessions. Following previous work on the
topic (Bernardini et al., 2009; Di Marco and Navigli,
2013) we selected those queries for which a sense
inventory exists as a disambiguation page in the En-
glish Wikipedia2. This guaranteed that the selected
queries consisted of either a single word or a multi-
word expression for which we had a collaboratively-
edited list of meanings, including lexicographic and
encyclopedic ones. We discarded all queries made

up of > 4 words, since the length of the great ma-
jority of queries lay in the range [1, 4]. In Table
1 we compare the percentage distribution of 1- to
4-word queries in the AOL query logs against our
dataset of queries. Note that we increased the per-
centage of 3- and 4-word queries in order to have
a significant coverage of those lengths. Anyhow,
in both cases most queries contained from 1 to 2
words. Note that the reported percentage distribu-
tions of query length is different from recent statis-
tics for two reasons: first, over the years users have
increased the average number of words per query in
order to refine their searches; second, we selected
only queries which were either single words (e.g.,
apple) or multi-word expressions (e.g., mortal kom-
bat), thereby discarding several long queries com-
posed of different words (such as angelina jolie ac-
tress).

Finally, we submitted each query to Google
search and retrieved the 64 top-ranking results re-
turned for each query. Therefore, overall the dataset
consists of 100 queries and 6,400 results. Each
search result includes the following information:
page title, URL of the page and snippet of the page
text. We show an example of search result for the
apple query in Figure 1.

2.2 Dataset Annotation

For each query q we used Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk3 to annotate each query result with the

3https://www.mturk.com

194



most suitable sense. The sense inventory for q
was obtained by listing the senses available in the
Wikipedia disambiguation page of q augmented
with additional options from the classes obtained
from the section headings of the disambiguation
page plus the OTHER catch-all meaning. For in-
stance, consider the apple query. We show its disam-
biguation page in Figure 2. The sense inventory for
apple was made up of the senses listed in that page
(e.g., MALUS, APPLE INC., APPLE BANK, etc.)
plus the set of generic classes OTHER PLANTS AND
PLANT PARTS, OTHER COMPANIES, OTHER FILMS,
plus OTHER.

For each query we ensured that three annotators
tagged each of the 64 results for that query with
the most suitable sense among those in the sense
inventory (selecting OTHER if no sense was appro-
priate). Specifically, each Turker was provided with
the following instructions: “The goal is annotating
the search result snippets returned by Google for a
given query with the appropriate meaning among
those available (obtained from the Wikipedia disam-
biguation page for the query). You have to select
the meaning that you consider most appropriate”.
No constraint on the age, gender and citizenship of
the annotators was imposed. However, in order to
avoid random tagging of search results, we provided
3 gold-standard result annotations per query, which
could be shown to the Turker more than once during
the annotation process. In the case (s)he failed to
annotate the gold items, the annotator was automat-
ically excluded.

2.3 Inter-Annotator Agreement and
Adjudication

In order to determine the reliability of the Turkers’
annotations, we calculated the individual values of
Fleiss’ kappa κ (Fleiss, 1971) for each query q and
then averaged them:

κ =

∑
q∈Q κq

|Q|
, (1)

where κq is the Fleiss’ kappa agreement of the three
annotators who tagged the 64 snippets returned by
the Google search engine for the query q ∈ Q, and
Q is our set of 100 queries. We obtained an average
value of κ = 0.66, which according to Landis and

Figure 2: The Wikipedia disambiguation page of Apple.

Koch (1977) can be seen as substantial agreement,
with a standard deviation σ = 0.185.

In Table 2 we show the agreement distribution
of our 6400 snippets, distinguishing between full
agreement (3 out of 3), majority agreement (2 out of
3), and no agreement. Most of the items were anno-
tated with full or majority agreement, indicating that
the manual annotation task was generally doable for
the layman. We manually checked all the cases of
majority agreement, correcting only 7.92% of the
majority adjudications, and manually adjudicated
all the snippets for which there was no agreement.
We observed during adjudication that in many cases
the disagreement was due to the existence of sub-
tle sense distinctions, like between MORTAL KOM-
BAT (VIDEO GAME) and MORTAL KOMBAT (2011
VIDEO GAME), or between THE DA VINCI CODE
and INACCURACIES IN THE DA VINCI CODE.

The average number of senses associated with
the search results of each query was 7.69
(higher than in previous datasets, such as AMBI-
ENT4+MORESQUE5, which associates 5.07 senses

per query on average).

3 Scoring

Following Di Marco and Navigli (2013), we eval-
uated the systems’ outputs in terms of the snippet
clustering quality (Section 3.1) and the snippet di-
versification quality (Section 3.2). Given a query
q ∈ Q and the corresponding set of 64 snippet re-
sults, let C be the clustering output by a given system
and let G be the gold-standard clustering for those
results. Each measure M(C,G) presented below is
calculated for the query q using these two cluster-
ings. The overall results on the entire set of queries
Q in the dataset is calculated by averaging the val-
ues of M(C,G) obtained for each single test query
q ∈ Q.

3.1 Clustering Quality
The first evaluation concerned the quality of the
clusters produced by the participating systems.
Since clustering evaluation is a difficult issue, we
calculated four distinct measures available in the lit-
erature, namely:

• Rand Index (Rand, 1971);

• Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie,
1985);

• Jaccard Index (Jaccard, 1901);

• F1 measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979).

The Rand Index (RI) of a clustering C is a mea-
sure of clustering agreement which determines the
percentage of correctly bucketed snippet pairs across
the two clusterings C and G. RI is calculated as fol-
lows:

RI(C,G) = TP + TN
TP + FP + FN + TN

, (2)

where TP is the number of true positives, i.e., snip-
pet pairs which are in the same cluster both in C and

Table 3: Contingency table for the clusterings G and C.

G, TN is the number of true negatives, i.e., pairs
which are in different clusters in both clusterings,
and FP and FN are, respectively, the number of false
positives and false negatives. RI ranges between 0
and 1, where 1 indicates perfect correspondence.

Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is a development of
Rand Index which corrects the RI for chance agree-
ment and makes it vary according to expectaction:

ARI(C,G) = RI(C,G)− E(RI(C,G))
maxRI(C,G)− E(RI(C,G))

.

(3)
where E(RI(C,G)) is the expected value of the RI.
Using the contingency table reported in Table 3 we
can quantify the degree of overlap between C and G,
where nij denotes the number of snippets in com-
mon between Gi and Cj (namely, nij = |Gi ∩ Cj |),
ai and bj represent, respectively, the number of snip-
pets inGi and Cj , andN is the total number of snip-
pets, i.e., N = 64. Now, the above equation can be
reformulated as:

ARI(C,G)=
∑

ij (
nij
2 )−[

∑
i (

ai
2 )

∑
j (

bj
2 )]/(

N

∑
j (

bj
2 )]−[

∑
i (

ai
2 )

∑
j (

bj
2 )]/(

N
2 )

.

(4)
The ARI ranges between −1 and +1 and is 0

when the index equals its expected value.
Jaccard Index (JI) is a measure which takes into

account only the snippet pairs which are in the same
cluster both in C and G, i.e., the true positives (TP),
while neglecting true negatives (TN), which are the
vast majority of cases. JI is calculated as follows:

JI(C,G) = TP
TP + FP + FN

. (5)

Finally, the F1 measure calculates the harmonic
mean of precision (P) and recall (R). Precision de-
termines how accurately the clusters of C represent

196



the query meanings in the gold standard G, whereas
recall measures how accurately the different mean-
ings in G are covered by the clusters in C. We follow
Crabtree et al. (2005) and define the precision of a
cluster Cj ∈ C as follows:

P (Cj) =
|Csj |
|Cj |

, (6)

whereCsj is the intersection betweenCj ∈ C and the
gold cluster Gs ∈ G which maximizes the cardinal-
ity of the intersection. The recall of a query sense s
is instead calculated as:

R(s) =
|
⋃

Cj∈Cs C
s
j |

ns
, (7)

where Cs is the subset of clusters of C whose ma-
jority sense is s, and ns is the number of snippets
tagged with query sense s in the gold standard. The
total precision and recall of the clustering C are then
calculated as:

P =

∑
Cj∈C P (Cj)|Cj |∑

Cj∈C |Cj |
; R =

∑
s∈S R(s)ns∑

s∈S ns
(8)

where S is the set of senses in the gold standard G
for the given query (i.e., |S| = |G|). The two values
of P and R are then combined into their harmonic
mean, namely the F1 measure:

F1(C,G) = 2PR
P +R

. (9)

3.2 Clustering Diversity
Our second evaluation is aimed at determining the
impact of the output clustering on the diversifica-
tion of the top results shown to a Web user. To
this end, we applied an automatic procedure for flat-
tening the clusterings produced by the participating
systems to a list of search results. Given a clus-
tering C = (C1, C2, . . . , Cm), we add to the ini-
tially empty list the first element of each cluster Cj
(j = 1, . . . ,m); then we iterate the process by se-
lecting the second element of each cluster Cj such
that |Cj | ≥ 2, and so on. The remaining elements re-
turned by the search engine, but not included in any
cluster of C, are appended to the bottom of the list
in their original order. Note that systems were asked
to sort snippets within clusters, as well as clusters
themselves, by relevance.

Since our goal is to determine how many differ-
ent meanings are covered by the top-ranking search
results according to the output clustering, we used
the measures of S-recall@K (Subtopic recall at rank
K) and S-precision@r (Subtopic precision at recall
r) (Zhai et al., 2003).

S-recall@K determines the ratio of different
meanings for a given query q in the top-K results
returned:

S-recall@K =
|{sense(ri) : i ∈ {1, . . . ,K}}|

g
,

(10)
where sense(ri) is the gold-standard sense associ-
ated with the i-th snippet returned by the system,
and g is the total number of distinct senses for the
query q in our gold standard.

S-precision@r instead determines the ratio of dif-
ferent senses retrieved for query q in the first Kr
snippets, where Kr is the minimum number of top
results for which the system achieves recall r. The
measure is defined as follows:

S-precision@r =
| ∪Kri=1 sense(ri)|

Kr
. (11)

3.3 Baselines

We compared the participating systems with two
simple baselines:

• SINGLETONS: each snippet is clustered as a
separate singleton cluster (i.e., |C| = 64).

• ALL-IN-ONE: all snippets are clustered into a
single cluster (i.e., |C| = 1).

These baselines are important in that they make
explicit the preference of certain quality measures
towards clusterings made up with a small or large
number of clusters.

4 Systems

5 teams submitted 10 systems, out of which 9 were
WSI systems, while 1 was a WSD system, i.e., us-
ing the Wikipedia sense inventory for performing
the disambiguation task. All systems could exploit
the information provided for each search result, i.e.,
URL, page title and result snippet. WSI systems
were requested to use unannotated corpora only.

Table 4: Resources used for WSI/WSD.

We asked each team to provide information about
their systems. In Table 4 we report the resources
used by each system. The HDP and UKP systems
use Wikipedia as raw text for sampling word counts;
DULUTH-SYS9-PK2 uses the first 10,000 paragraphs
of the Associated Press wire service data from the
English Gigaword Corpus (Graff, 2003, 1st edition),
whereas DULUTH-SYS1-PK2 and DULUTH-SYS7-
PK2 both use the snippets for inducing the query
senses. Finally, the UKP systems were the only ones
to retrieve the Web pages from the corresponding
URLs and exploit them for WSI purposes. They
also use WaCky (Baroni et al., 2009) and a distri-
butional thesaurus obtained from the Leipzig Cor-
pora Collection6 (Biemann et al., 2007). SATTY-
APPROACH1 just uses snippets.

The only participating WSD system, RAKESH,
uses the YAGO hierarchy (Suchanek et al., 2008) to-
gether with DBPedia abstracts (Bizer et al., 2009).

5 Results

We show the results of RI and ARI in Table 5. The
best performing systems are those from the HDP
team, with considerably higher RI and ARI. The
next best systems are SATTY-APPROACH1, which
uses only the words in the snippets, and the only
WSD system, i.e., RAKESH. SINGLETONS perform
well with RI, but badly when chance agreement is
taken into account.

As for F1 and JI, whose values are shown in Table
6, the two HDP systems again perform best in terms
of F1, and are on par with UKP-WSI-WACKY-LLR in
terms of JI. The third best approach in terms of F1
is again SATTY-APPROACH1, which however per-

forms badly in terms of JI. The SINGLETONS base-
line clearly obtains the best F1 performance, but the
worst JI results. The ALL-IN-ONE baseline outper-
forms all other systems with the JI measure, because
TN are not considered, which favours large clusters.

To get more insights into the performance of the
various systems, we calculated the average number
of clusters per clustering produced by each system
and compared it with the gold standard average. We
also computed the average cluster size, i.e., the aver-
age number of snippets per cluster. The statistics are
shown in Table 7. Interestingly, the best performing
systems are those with the cluster number and aver-
age number of clusters closest to the gold standard
ones. This finding is also confirmed by Figure 3,
where we draw each system according to its average
values regarding cluster number and size: again the
distance from the gold standard is meaningful.

We also graph the diversification performance
trend of S-recall@K and S-precision@r in Fig-
ures 4 and 5 for K = 1, . . . , 25 and r ∈
{40, 50, . . . , 100}.

6 Conclusions and Future Directions

One of the aims of the SemEval-2013 task on Word
Sense Induction & Disambiguation within an End
User Application was to enable an objective compar-
ison of WSI and WSD systems when integrated into
Web search result clustering and diversification. The
task is a hard one, in that it involves clustering, but
provides clear-cut evidence that our end-to-end ap-
plication framework overcomes the limits of previ-
ous in-vitro evaluations. Indeed, the systems which
create good clusters and better diversify search re-
sults, i.e., those from the HDP team, achieve good
performance across all the proposed measures, with
no contradictory evidence.

Our annotation experience showed that the
Wikipedia sense inventory, augmented with our
generic classes, is a good choice for semantically
tagging search results, in that it covers most of the
meanings a Web user might be interested in. In fact,
only 20% of the snippets was annotated with the
OTHER class.

Future work might consider large-scale multilin-
gual lexical resources, such as BabelNet (Navigli
and Ponzetto, 2012), both as sense inventory and for

performing the search result clustering and diversi-
fication task.
