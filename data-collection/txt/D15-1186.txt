Abstract

Traditional approaches to Chinese Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) almost heavily re-
ly on feature engineering. Even worse,
the long-range dependencies in a sentence
can hardly be modeled by these method-
s. In this paper, we introduce bidirection-
al recurrent neural network (RNN) with
long-short-term memory (LSTM) to cap-
ture bidirectional and long-range depen-
dencies in a sentence with minimal fea-
ture engineering. Experimental results on
Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) show a
significant improvement over the state-of-
the-art methods. Moreover, our model
makes it convenient to introduce hetero-
geneous resource, which makes a further
improvement on our experimental perfor-
mance.

1 Introduction

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is defined as the
task to recognize arguments for a given predicate
and assign semantic role labels to them. Because
of its ability to encode semantic information, there
has been an increasing interest in SRL on many
languages (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Sun and Ju-
rafsky, 2004). Figure 1 shows an example in Chi-
nese Proposition Bank (CPB) (Xue and Palmer,
2003), which is a Chinese corpus annotated with
semantic role labels.

Traditional approaches to Chinese SRL often
extract a large number of handcrafted features
from the sentence, even its parse tree, and feed
these features to statistical classifiers such as CRF,
MaxEnt and SVM (Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Xue,
2008; Ding and Chang, 2008; Ding and Chang,
2009; Sun, 2010). However, these methods suf-
fer from three major problems. Firstly, their per-
formances are heavily dependent on feature engi-

neering, which needs domain knowledge and la-
borious work of feature extraction and selection.
Secondly, although sophisticated features are de-
signed, the long-range dependencies in a sentence
can hardly be modeled. Thirdly, a specific anno-
tated dataset is often limited in its scalability, but
the existence of heterogenous resource, which has
very different semantic role labels and annotation
schema but related latent semantic meaning, can
alleviate this problem. However, traditional meth-
ods cannot relate distinct annotation schemas and
introduce heterogeneous resource with ease.

Concerning these problems, in this paper, we
propose bidirectional recurrent neural network
(RNN) with long-short-term memory (LSTM) to
solve the problem of Chinese SRL. Our approach
makes the following contributions:

• We formulate Chinese SRL with bidirection-
al LSTM RNN model. With bidirectional
RNN, the dependencies in a sentence from
both directions can be captured, and with L-
STM architecture, long-range dependencies
can be well modeled. The test results on the
bechmark dataset CPB show a significant im-
provement over the state-of-the-art methods.

• Compared with previous work that relied on
a huge number of handcrafted features, our
model can achieve much better performance
only with minimal feature engineering.

• The framework of our model makes the intro-
duction of heterogeneous resource efficient

and convenient, and this can further improve
our experimental performance.

2 Chinese SRL with RNN

Following previous work, we regard Chinese S-
RL as a task of sequence labeling, which assigns
a label for each word in the sequence. To iden-
tify the boundary information of semantic roles,
we adopt the IOBES tagging schema for the la-
bels as shown in Figure 1. For sequence labeling,
it is important to capture dependencies in the se-
quence, especially for the problem of SRL, where
the semantic role label for a word not only relies
on its local information, but also is determined by
long-range dependencies from other words. The
advantage of RNN is the ability to better capture
the contextual information, which is beneficial to
capture dependencies in SRL. Moreover, we en-
rich the basic RNN model with bidirectional LST-
M RNN, which can model bidirectional and long-
range dependencies simultaneously.

2.1 Model Architecture

The architecture of our approach is illustrated in
Figure 2. Given a sentence, we first get repre-
sentation for each word to be labeled. Then af-
ter a nonlinear transformation, bidirectional LST-
M RNN layer is designed to combine the local in-

formation of a word and its contextual information
from both directions. With a nonlinear layer to
form more complex features, a linear output lay-
er follows. For each word to be labeled, there is
an output vector, whose each dimension is a score
corresponding to a kind of semantic role label.

2.2 Word Representation
Word representation captures the features locally
embedded around the word. The features used in
our work are: the current word, the current POS
tag, the predicate, left and right words, left and
right POS tags, distance to the predicate. Note that
these features are all basic information about the
word, hence we alleviate the heavy job of feature
engineering. All these features are introduced by
embeddings. After concatenation, we get the word
representation feature vector.

To get more complex features, we adopt a non-
linear transformation:

zt = f(W1xt) 1 ≤ t ≤ N
where xt is the word representation of the t-th
word, W1 ∈ Rn1×n0 , n0 is the length of word rep-
resentation, f is an activation function and we use
tanh in our experiments,N is the number of words
to be labeled in the sequence.

2.3 Bidirectional LSTM RNN
Representation zt only captures the local informa-
tion. Here we adopt RNN to capture contextual
information. Traditional RNN has the problem of
vanishing or exploding gradients, which means the
long-term dependencies can hardly be modeled.
LSTM is designed to mitigate this problem.

At each word position t, the LSTM RNN com-
putes six internal vectors: C̃, gi, gf , go, Ct and ht
for the memory cell, which is a structure used in
LSTM to store information. C̃ computes the can-
didate value for the state of the memory cell:

C̃ = f(Wczt + Ucht−1 + bc)

The activations of the memory cell’s input gate,
forget gate and output gate are defined as:

gj = σ(Wjzi + Ujht−1 + bj)

where j stands for i, f or o. σ is taken sigmoid in
experiments. Then we can compute Ct, the mem-
ory cell’s new state at position t:

Ct = gi � C̃ + gf � Ct−1

1627



where � indicates elementwise vector multiplica-
tion. With the new state of the memory cell, we
can compute the value of output state ht:

ht = go � f(Ct)

ht contains the information not only from local
representation zt, but also from previous output
state ht−1, hence can capture dependencies in
a sentence. Because the dependencies forward
and backward are both important to label seman-
tic roles, we extend LSTM with bidirectional ap-
proach, resulting in:

at = [
−→
ht

T ,
←−
ht

T ]T 1 ≤ t ≤ N

Further, a nonlinear transformation follows:

vt = f(W2at) 1 ≤ t ≤ N

where W2 ∈ Rn3×n2 , n2 is the dimension of at.
2.4 Output Representation
For each word to be labeled, we adopt linear trans-
formation to get the output vector ot:

ot = W3vt 1 ≤ t ≤ N

W3 ∈ Rn4×n3 , where n4 is the number of seman-
tic role labels in IOBES tagging schema. There-
fore, the resulting vector ot for the t-th word is of
length n4, and each dimension corresponds to the
score of a certain semantic role label.

2.5 Training Criteria
Because there are dependencies among word la-
bels in a sentence, isolated training approach
which independently considers each word will be
inappropriate. Therefore, we adopt sentence tag
approach, in which we encourage the correct path
of tags, while discouraging all other valid paths.

Given all our training examples:

T = (x(i), y(i))

where x(i) denotes the i-th training sentence, y(i)

is the corresponding Ni (the number of words to
be labeled) dimension vector, which indicates the
correct path of tags, and y(i)t = k means the t-th
word has the k-th semantic role label. The score
of x(i) along the path y(i) is defined as follows:

s(x(i), y(i), θ) =
Ni∑
t=1

o
ty

(i)
t

where θ is an ensemble of all the parameters in the
network.

The log likelihood with a single sample is then:

logp(y(i)|x(i), θ) = log exp
(
s(x(i), y(i), θ)

)∑
y′ exp

(
s(x(i), y′, θ))

= s(x(i), y(i), θ)− log
∑
y′

exp
(
s(x(i), y′, θ)

)
where y′ ranges from all the valid paths of tags.

The full log likelihood of the whole training cor-
pus is as follows:

J(θ) =
T∑

i=1

logp(y(i)|x(i), θ)

To compute the network parameter θ, we maxi-
mize the log likelihood J(θ) using stochastic gra-
dient ascent in the experiments.

2.6 Introducing Heterogeneous Resource

A single annotated corpus with semantic role la-
bels is often limited in its scalability. Heteroge-
neous resource in our work is defined as another
dataset annotated with semantic roles, which also
provides predicate-argument structure annotation,
but uses very different semantic role labels and an-
notation schema. However, in spite of these differ-
ences, the latent semantic meaning may be highly
correlated. Therefore, the introduction of hetero-
geneous data can alleviate the problem of scalabil-
ity with a single annotated corpus.

Traditional approaches hardly concern the ex-
istence of heterogeneous resource and are diffi-
cult to relate different annotation schemas, but in
the framework of our model, heterogeneous data
can be introduced in a relatively convenient way.
Specifically, we learn a bidirectional LSTM RN-
N model based on heterogeneous data, then with
the fine-tuned word embeddings we initialize the
model on our experimental dataset. The princi-
ple behind is that the words almost convey the
same semantic meaning albeit in distinct annota-
tion schemas. The introduction of heterogenous
resource in this way is efficient and can lead to
performance improvement on our experiment.

with previous landmark methods on the bench-
mark dataset CPB for Chinese SRL. The result

reveals that even with our basic model, which
does not resort to other resources, our approach
can significantly outperform all of the competitors.
Moreover, we enrich our work with introducing
heterogenous resource to make a further improve-
ment on performance. And the result also shows
the influence of heterogeneous resource is more
evident than the standard method of pre-training
for word embeddings.

3.1 Experimental Setting

To facilitate comparison with previous work, we
conduct experiments on the standard benchmark
dataset CPB 1.0.1 We follow the same data setting
as previous work (Xue, 2008; Sun et al., 2009),
which divided the dataset into three parts: 648
files (from chtb 081.fid to chtb 899.fid) are used
as the training set. The development set includes
40 files, from chtb 041.fid to chtb 080.fid. The
test set includes 72 files, which are chtb 001.fid
to chtb 040.fid, and chtb 900.fid to chtb 931.fid.
We use another annotated corpus2 with distinct se-
mantic role labels and annotation schema, which is
designed by ourselves for other projects, as hetero-
geneous resource. This labeled dataset has 17,308
annotated sentences, and the semantic roles con-
cerned are like “agent” and “patient”, resulting in
21 kinds of types, which are all distinct from the
semantic roles defined in CPB. We use the devel-
opment set of CPB for model selection, and the
hyper parameter setting of our model is reported
in Table 1.

3.2 Chinese SRL Performance

pared to previous landmark results. The work of

B for comparison. As indicated by this table, our
approach significantly outperforms previous state-
of-the-art methods even with all parameters ran-
domly initialized, that is without introducing other
resources. This result can prove the ability of our
model to capture useful dependencies for Chinese
SRL with minimal feature engineering.

Further, we conduct experiments with the intro-
duction of heterogenous resource. Previous work
found that the performance can be improved by
pre-training the word embeddings on large unla-
beled data and using the obtained embeddings to
make initialization. With the result in Table 2,
it is true that these pre-trained word embeddings
have a good effect on our performance (we use
word2vec3 on Chinese Gigaword Corpus for word
pre-training). However, as shown in Table 2, com-
pared to standard pre-training, the influence of het-
erogenous data is more evident. We can explain
this difference via the distinction between these
two kinds of methods for performance improve-
ment. The information provided by standard pre-
training with unlabeled data is more general, while
that of heterogenous resource is more relevant to
our task, hence is more informative and evident.

4 Related Work

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) was first defined
by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), who presented a
a system based on statistical classifiers trained on
hand-annotated corpus FrameNet. Sun and Ju-
rafsky (2004) did the preliminary work on Chi-
nese SRL without any large semantically annotat-
ed corpus and produced promising results. Af-
ter CPB (Xue and Palmer, 2003) was built, X-
ue and Palmer (2005) and Xue (2008) produced
more complete and systematic research on Chi-
nese SRL. Ding and Chang (2009) established a

word based Chinese SRL system, which is quite
different from the previous parsing based ones.
Sun et al. (2009) extended the work of Chen et
al. (2006), performed Chinese SRL with shallow
parsing, which took partial parses as inputs. Yang
and Zong (2014) proposed multi-predicate SRL,
which showed improvements both on English and
Chinese Proposition Bank. Different from most
work relying on a large number of handcrafted
features, Collobert and Weston (2008) proposed a
convolutional neural network for SRL. Their ap-
proach achieved competitive performance on En-
glish SRL without requiring task specific feature
engineering. However, by max-pooling operation,
the convolution approach only preserved the most
evident features in a sentence, thus can only weak-
ly model the dependencies. With our bidirectional
LSTM RNN model, this problem can be well alle-
viated.

Our model is based on recurrent neural network
(RNN), which uses iterative function loops to store
contextual information. To remedy the problem
of vanishing and exploding gradients when train-
ing the standard RNN, Hochreiter and Schmidhu-
ber (1997) proposed long-short-term memory (L-
STM), which has been shown capable of storing
and accessing information over very long time s-
pans. Bidirectional RNN (Schuster and Paliwal,
1997) and bidirectional LSTM RNN (Graves et
al., 2005) are the extensions of RNN and LSTM
RNN with the capability of capturing contextual
information from both directions in the sequence.
In recent years, RNN has shown the state-of-the-
art results in many NLP problems such as lan-
guage modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010) and ma-
chine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bah-
danau et al., 2014). Sundermeyer et al. (2014)
also used bidirectional LSTM RNN model to im-
prove strong baselines when modeling translation.
More recently, Zhou and Xu (2015) proposed L-
STM RNN approach for English Semantic Role
Labeling, which shared similar idea with our mod-
el. However, the features used and the network ar-
chitecture were different from ours. Moreover, it is
delightful that our work can achieve a rather good
result with a relatively simpler model architecture.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we formulate Chinese SRL problem
with the framework of bidirectional LSTM RN-
N model. In our approach, the bidirectional and

long-range dependencies in a sentence, which are
important for Chinese SRL, can be well modeled.
And with the framework of deep neural network,
the heavy job of feature engineering is much alle-
viated. Moreover, our model makes the introduc-
tion of heterogenous data, which can alleviate the
problem of scalability with a single annotated cor-
pus, more convenient. Experiments show that our
approach achieves much better results than previ-
ous work, and the introduction of heterogenous re-
source can make further improvement on perfor-
mance.
