Abstract 

We discuss the notion of language and dialect-specific search in the context of audio indexing. A system 
is described where users can find dialect or language-specific pronunciations of Afghan placenames in 
Dari and Pashto. We explore the efficacy of a phonetic speech recognition system employed in this task. 

1 Introduction 
The Audio Gazetteer hotspotting tool was developed by MITRE (2012) and employs the Nexidia 

phonetic speech recognition engine (Gavalda and Schlueter, 2010) in several languages, including Dari 
(the Afghan variety of Persian) and Pashto, the two main languages of Afghanistan. These languages 
are both members of the Iranian language family and share a number of phonetic characteristics (Miller 
et al., 2013). This tool enables a user to load audio clips and to search them for words contained within 
them using one of three methods: the Dari or Pashto alphabets, a Romanization scheme, or phonetics in 
SAMPA (Wells, 1997). Such a search will yield each starting timepoint in an audio file where the system 
has identified the term being searched, along with a number between 0 and 100 indicating the level of 
confidence the system has in its determination. While terms of any kind can be searched, the system 
provides additional mapping capabilities for placenames. 

Audio hotspotting, also known as keyword spotting or audio indexing, is a form of information re-
trieval employing speech recognition that is used for quickly identifying passages of interest within 
audio files. It can be used to identify calls of interest in call centers, or to explore reports of natural 
disasters or political crises in the media. There are two main approaches to audio hotspotting; one in-
volves speech-to-text (STT), also known as large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), 
and the other employs phonetic speech recognition.   

STT ingests speech and outputs orthographic text.  To do this, it requires language-specific acoustic 
and language models mediated by a pronunciation model or dictionary that maps words to phonetic 
forms. The output text transcript can then be mined for terms of interest.  Raytheon’s BBN Broadcast 
Monitoring System is an example of such a system (Raytheon, 2012).  One liability of this approach is 
the need to establish the vocabulary, upon which the language and pronunciation models depend, up-
front.  That means that one cannot easily search for terms that have not been programmed into the system 
beforehand.  This is an especially challenging impediment when confronting natural disasters and polit-
ical crises in regions with towns and personalities whose names are “out of vocabulary” (OOV).   

Phonetic speech recognition uses language-specific acoustic models directly; allowing users to query 
phonetic strings, possibly with the aid of a pronunciation model allowing orthographic search.  The 
ability to query phonetic strings removes the OOV problem; any string that can be composed of the 
phonemes of a particular language can be searched.  While this technology is useful for keyword spot-
ting, it cannot be used to generate a meaningful orthographic transcript of speech, due to its lack of a 
language model.

Our purpose is to explore the feasibility of using phonetic speech recognition technology to explore 
subtle dialect and language differences, with the ultimate aim of enabling language or dialect specific 
search.  In such a scenario, a user is not simply interested in finding a particular term of interest, he is 
also interested in the sociolinguistic characteristics of the speaker of that term of interest. 

Various researchers have performed promising experiments using STT to explore phonetic variation.  
These experiments utilize STT in forced alignment mode; that is, given a pre-existing orthographic tran-
script, they ask the recognizer to focus on deciding which pronunciation among a finite set supplied by 
the researcher maps best onto particular audio exemplars.  Fox (2006) used this technique to examine 
several realizations of syllable-final /s/1 in Spanish including [s], [h] and deletion, while Wester et al. 
(2001) explored variable deletion of /n/, /r/ and /t/ in Dutch, as well as schwa-insertion and deletion.  
Both demonstrated promising agreement between the STT-based approaches and human coding. 

In contrast, the phonetic speech recognizer employed here requires neither an orthographic transcript, 
nor a predetermined set of phonetic variants from which to choose.  For that reason, we felt it offered a 
flexible platform from which to explore phonetic variation, and thus enabled employing knowledge of 
that variation to perform dialect and language-specific search for Dari and Pashto. 

2 Data collection and transcription 
We developed an interview protocol consisting of three components: a sociolinguistic background in-
terview, a map task and a word list. This interview was designed to elicit Afghan placename data from 
Afghans residing in the United States whose native language was either Dari or Pashto. Speakers bilin-
gual in Dari and Pashto were interviewed in both languages sequentially. Seven Dari and three Pashto 
interviews, comprising approximately six hours in total, were digitally recorded and later downsampled 
to 16 MHz with 16-bit precision. 

The purpose of the sociolinguistic background interview was to establish the language and dialect 
profile of each speaker. Where possible, it was conducted in the speaker’s native language, and estab-
lished the location and duration of each place where he or she resided. In addition, the interview estab-
lished the location and language of instruction of each school attended, as well as the language and 
dialect used with family members and friends.  The interview inquired about all the languages and dia-
lects both spoken and understood by the speakers.  

The purpose of the map task was to gather subjects’ pronunciations of placenames in Afghanistan in 
a casual style. A large colored map of Afghanistan, using native lettering, was placed before the subjects 
and they were asked to explain in Dari or Pashto how to get to and from various points. 

The final part of the interview involved reading a word list in Dari or Pashto containing the names of 
over 200 placenames, including provinces, provincial capitals, other large towns, administrative divi-
sions, regions, mountain ranges, passes, bodies of water, airports and deserts. In Pashto interviews, each 
placename was read both by itself for the direct case and in frames designed to elicit the oblique and 
ablative cases. As a result of the three-part interview, we obtained several tokens of many placenames, 
along a scale of more casual style in the sociolinguistic and map tasks to more formal in the word list. 

The placenames in each audio file were transcribed using Praat (Boersma, 2001). Up to five of the 
following transcription tiers were used: 

 
• English: one spelling for each placename was used as an index for each utterance of a given 

place, regardless of any particularities in individual utterances. 
• Native: Pashto or Dari spelling. 
• Phonetic: fairly broad transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  
• Language: Dari or Pashto. In general, a given task was in one language at a time.  However, 

when working with bilingual subjects, they would occasionally explicitly remark on the pro-
nunciation of the placename in the other language, so it was necessary to indicate the language 
for each placename. 

• Case: for Pashto, indication of whether the particular utterance was in the direct, oblique or 
ablative case. 

1 Square brackets [] are used for allophones or sequences when no particular phonemic claims are being made; 
slashes // are used for phonemes.

The purpose of the phonetic transcription was to represent a human phonetic judgment that could be 

compared to the hypotheses of the phonetic speech recognition engine. In its documentation, Nexidia 
provides separate phoneme inventories in SAMPA for Dari and Pashto2. Sometimes Nexidia does not 
provide a symbol to express certain distinctions. For example, a schwa [ə] is provided for Pashto, but 
not Dari. Schwa is a phoneme in Pashto; however, in Dari it is a possible allophone of some short vowels. 
In order to facilitate experimentation with the system, in the course of phonetic transcription of a given 
language, we limited ourselves to the speech recognizer’s phoneme inventory for that language. 

3 Placename pronunciation variation 
The field of toponym resolution attempts to identify which particular place, or geocode, a given place-
name refers to: for example, in some contexts “London” may refer to a place in England; in others, to a 
place in Canada. Research in this field has primarily focused on clues in surrounding text or audio to 
disambiguate such placenames (Leidner, 2007; Buscaldi, 2010). To our knowledge, pronunciation var-
iation in placenames has not yet been exploited to assist in disambiguation. 

Pronunciation of placenames is well known to vary; indeed one example of this is the phenomenon 
known as “local pronunciation” (Forster, 1981). Some common examples from the English-speaking 
world include Cairo [kero], Illinois vs. Cairo [kajro], Egypt, and Houston [hawstən] Street in New York 
City vs. Houston [hjustən], Texas. The notion of local pronunciation is even more salient in a bilingual 
society; for example, French-speaking inhabitants of Montreal call their city [mɔ̃real], while English-
speaking residents say [mʌntriɒl], not to mention Americans, who might say [mɑntriɔl]. 

In Afghanistan, Pashto and Dari are the principal languages among many other languages spoken 
(Farhadi, 1955; MacKenzie, 1959). Pashto and Dari-speaking communities are both located throughout 
the country, so it is very common for placenames to have Pashto and Dari variants, as well as variants 
for particular dialects of each language. 

Table 1 illustrates some variation within Dari pronunciation of placenames that we encountered. This 
variation is not limited to placenames; in fact, each of the phonetic phenomena has been reported by 
Farhadi (1955), and one variant of each word may be deemed formal and the other colloquial.

Table 2 illustrates placename pronunciation variation within Pashto. The southwest dialect of Pashto, 

including Kandahar, pronounces the Pashto letter ښ as /ʂ/, while the northeast dialect, including Pesha-
war, Pakistan and neighboring regions of Afghanistan, pronounces it as /x/ (Miller, 2014).

Table 2: Pronunciation variation within Pashto 
 
Table 3 illustrates variation in Pashto based on case. Pashto has three cases, which may cause the 

pronunciation of placenames to vary. The direct case is used by default, the oblique case is used when

the placename is the object of certain prepositions and when the placename is the subject of transitive 
sentences in the past tense, and the ablative (also known as oblique II) is used in certain prepositional 
constructions meaning “from” (Penzl, 1955). Not all placenames exhibit variation based on case. Inter-
estingly, the words that do feature a distinct oblique case take a plural ending. One interview subject 
suggested that in that case, the word may be interpreted as a group of people or tribe.

Table 4 illustrates pronunciation variation between Dari and Pashto for particular places, reflecting 

language differences reported in Miran (1969), Penzl (1955), and elsewhere. When the native spelling 
used is common between the two languages, it is placed in the “Place” column; when it differs, it is 
placed in the “Dari” and “Pashto” columns.

Table 4: Variation between Dari and Pashto 
 
As can be seen in Table 4, the vowel systems of Dari and Pashto differ somewhat. Dari generally 

employs a more rounded long a, which we can abstractly label /ā/, compared to Pashto. That is, Dari 
often uses /ɒ/ in contrast to Pashto /ɑ/. The SAMPA provided by Nexidia for each language only contains 
one /ā/ per language, so it is not possible to assess the system’s efficacy at recognizing the rounded or 
unrounded variant by searching within one language; however, a method involving crosslingual search 
will be discussed below. In addition, future research will aim to measure the acoustic properties of the 
two varieties of /ā/. 

With regard to consonants, Pashto has a retroflex /ɽ/, while Dari does not. In Kunar, the Pashto /ɽ/ 
corresponds to Dari /r/. Note, however, that when speaking Pashto as a second language, Dari speakers 
replace Pashto /ɽ/ with /l/ more often than /r/ (Miran, 1969). Dari preserves the Arabic voiceless uvular 
stop /q/, in contrast to Pashto, which generally employs /k/ in words derived from Arabic spelled with 
the letter ق (Penzl, 1955). 

 

4 Assessment technique 
Precision and recall are the most common measures for assessing quality in the context of audio hotspot-
ting (Hu et al., 2012). We employ these metrics in two scenarios: dialect-agnostic and dialect-specific 
search.  In the dialect-agnostic case, one would search for an orthographic term, for example Lashkar 
Gah, and calculate precision (true positives/(true positives + false positives)) based on how many of the 
recalled terms were in fact Lashkar Gah, and calculate recall (true positives/(true positives + false neg-
atives)) based on how many of the actual Lashkar Gah’s in the file being searched were identified. This 
method provides a way of evaluating the efficacy of a given system to retrieve audio of interest when 
one’s primary concern is the place or term in question, regardless of the pronunciation that was used. 

71



We modify the scoring method in the dialect-specific case, in which we are focused on pronunciation. 
Consider for example, the two common pronunciations of Lashkar Gah in Pashto: [laxkargɑ] and 
[laʂkarɡɑ]. In this case, when calculating precision, if one searches for [laxkargɑ] and [laʂkarɡɑ] is re-
trieved, it is just as wrong as if Kabul were retrieved (variable scoring, by incorporation of approaches 
such as Nerbonne and Heeringa (2010), will be considered in the future). For calculating recall, the 
universe of Lashkar Gah’s is limited to those whose pronunciation matches the search term. 

There is some pronunciation variation that does not necessarily represent dialect variation, and should 
be considered “under the radar” for the purposes of a dialect-specific search. In the example above, 
either of the first two vowels could be [ə] instead of [a]. For this reason, we introduce the notion of 
equivalence classes to enable us to give equal “correct” scores for example to both [laxkargɑ] and 
[ləxkarɡɑ] when searching for [laxkargɑ]. 

This scoring method provides a way of evaluating a given system’s sensitivity to pronunciation dif-
ferences. If a system proves adept at such a task, it can be employed in two related tasks: 

 
• Language-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular language 
• Dialect-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular dialect or accent 

 
There is a large literature on language, speaker and dialect identification (Biadsy, 2011). Most of 

these methods are designed to emit a judgment as to language, speaker or dialect, based on a given audio 
sample, which might be useful in various kinds of batch processing. Another approach to accent and 
nativeness judgment is described by Weinberger and Kunath (2011). In this approach, audio is first 
reduced to a human-made phonetic transcription that is then mined for clues as to dialect and accent. 

The work described here may be situated between automatic techniques based on audio and post-hoc 
techniques focused on transcriptions. Our method is designed for users interacting with a given audio 
sample; one that is likely to contain a mix of speakers, languages or dialects. Also, in contrast to statis-
tical approaches which may appear as a “black box” to end-users, our approach allows users to itera-
tively and interactively develop hypotheses as to the association of specific pronunciations with lan-
guages, dialects or speakers. 

5 Dialect Search 
In this section, we contrast performance on dialect-specific vs. dialect-agnostic searches. Suppose in 
Dari we are interested in finding speakers who use the pronunciation [qalɑɛnaw] instead of [qalaʔɛnaw] 
for the town Qalah-ye Now قلعھ نو. In this case, we are focused on the application of the phonetic process 
/aʔ/ → [ɑ]. The most salient aspect of this is the presence of the vowel [ɑ] rather than [a] in the second 
syllable. Consequently, we are unconcerned about other forms of variation we may encounter, such as 
variation between [q] and [k], and [ɛ] and [e]. We therefore contrast the following two equivalence 
classes for this experiment as shown in Table 5: 

 
No compensatory lengthening Compensatory lengthening  
[qalaʔɛnaw] 
[qalaʔenaw] 
[kalaʔɛnaw] 
[kalaʔenaw] 

[qalɑɛnaw] 
[qalɑenaw] 
[kalɑɛnaw] 
[kalɑenaw] 

Table 5:  Equivalence classes for Qalah-ye Now Experiment 
 
When we search for a “no compensatory lengthening” pronunciation, we have a correct answer when 

we retrieve any one of the “no compensatory lengthening” pronunciations, and equivalently for the 
“compensatory lengthening” pronunciations. Table 6 provides results for precision and recall on this 
search above two levels of phonetic recognizer confidence: 

 

72



Search Term Confidence Precision Recall True Pos. False Pos. False Neg. 

[qalaʔɛnaw] 80 0.88 0.50 7 1 7 60 0.80 0.57 8 2 6 

[qalɑɛnaw] 80 0.33 1.00 1 2 0 60 0.13 1.00 1 7 0 
Table 6: Dialect-specific results on compensatory lengthening in Dari 

 
As expected, recall is better with lower confidence and precision is better with higher confidence. 

Note that when searching for [qalaʔɛnaw], [qalɑɛnaw] is not retrieved above confidence 60. However, 
when searching for [qalɑɛnaw], [qalaʔɛnaw] is sometimes retrieved above that confidence level. This 
asymmetric performance is reflected in the higher precision values for [qalaʔɛnaw] as compared to [qal-
ɑɛnaw]. 

Table 7 presents data for a dialect-agnostic search for Qalah-ye Now. For this search, we are not 
concerned about the particular pronunciation, so any pronunciation of the place in question will count 
as correct. As can be seen, this perspective causes precision to increase for [qalɑɛnaw].

[qalaʔɛnaw] 80 0.88 0.47 7 1 8 60 0.80 0.53 8 2 7

Table 7: Dialect-agnostic results on Qalah-ye Now 

 
Table 8 provides dialect-specific results on the diagnosis of southwest vs. northeast Pashto on the 

basis of the presence of [ʂ] or [x] for the Pashto letter ښ in the pronunciation of the town Lashkar Gah 
ګاه ښکرل . In the dialect-specific search, presence of [ʂ] or [x] must match between the search term and 

what is retrieved.  The search with [x] is seen to be more precise.

Table 8: Dialect-specific results on /ʂ/ vs. /x/ in Pashto 

 
Table 9 presents data for a dialect-agnostic search for Lashkar Gah. In this search, any pronunciation

Table 9: Dialect-agnostic results on /ʂ/ vs. /x/ in Pashto 

6 Crosslingual Search 
Crosslingual search is treated as a form of query expansion by Hu et al. (2012) and its efficacy as well 
as algorithms for its implementation in the domain of placenames are discussed by Joshi et al. (2008). 
We adduce crosslingual search as a tool for assessing language-specific search. For example, if we 
search for Kabul using the Pashto engine, to what extent will we retrieve Pashto utterances of that place 
as opposed to Dari utterances, and vice versa? If the Pashto engine is good at picking up Pashto to the 
exclusion of Dari utterances of a placename, it may be an effective tool for language-specific search. 

73



We performed a set of experiments to assess this capability. First, we performed a search that was 
agnostic with respect to language and dialect. This means that in a search for Kabul in Pashto, we give 
credit for both Pashto and Dari tokens of Kabul that are retrieved, regardless of their particular pronun-
ciations. Next, we performed language-specific searches in both Dari and Pashto. When searching in a 
given language, we only give credit for retrievals in that language. Note that when we performed lan-
guage-specific search, we were dialect-agnostic. That is, we gave credit for a retrieval provided it was 
in the language being searched for, regardless of the particular pronunciation used. 

The first term used for both language-agnostic and language-specific search was IPA [kɑbʊl]. Note 
that due to details of the Nexidia engine, the actual SAMPA strings used were [k A: b O l] for Dari and 
[k A b u l] for Pashto. The symbols for /ā/ and /ʊ/ in each language are arbitrarily different as indicated 
in Table 10. While IPA symbols (and their SAMPA equivalents) are theoretically absolute values in 
acoustic or articulatory space, in practice, they often adhere to arbitrary conventions for transcription of 
a particular language.

Table 10: Differences in phoneme symbols used for Dari and Pashto 
 
Pashto exhibits pronunciation variation between [kɑbʊl] and [kɑbəl]. Table 11 compares performance 

on language-agnostic search performed for Kabul in each language. 
 
Language Search Confidence Precision Recall True Pos. False Pos. False Neg. 
Dari [kɑbʊl] 60 0.75 0.61 41 14 26

Table 11: Language and dialect-agnostic search 

 
 Table 12 compares performance on language-specific search. Note that this search was still dialect-

agnostic, so credit was given as long as the token was in the searched-for language, regardless of its 
pronunciation.

Table 12: Language-specific search 

 
As we can see from these results, the Dari engine has better precision and recall on the language-

agnostic search, in contrast to the Pashto engine, whose recall is better on language-specific search. This 
can be interpreted as follows: the Dari engine is more versatile and can pick up Pashto, whereas the 
Pashto engine is more specific to Pashto and does not pick up Dari as well. 

7 Conclusion 
We have achieved some success searching for language and dialect-specific pronunciations using the 
Audio Gazetteer tool. A future challenge will be to identify dialect-specific toponyms automatically 
from a gazetteer. Our results are encouraging for the exploitation of pronunciation variation in toponym 
resolution and perhaps speaker identification.  While dialect-specific results are often not as precise as 
searches that are agnostic as to language or dialect, in effect because we are “raising the bar” for what 

74



is correct, more data and more dialect and language-specific phenomena need to be collected and pro-
cessed through the system in order to establish its capabilities more clearly.
