Abstract

We present a novel unsupervised approach to
detecting the compositionality of multi-word
expressions. We compute the compositional-
ity of a phrase through substituting the con-
stituent words with their “neighbours” in a se-
mantic vector space and averaging over the
distance between the original phrase and the
substituted neighbour phrases. Several meth-
ods of obtaining neighbours are presented.
The results are compared to existing super-
vised results and achieve state-of-the-art per-
formance on a verb-object dataset of human
compositionality ratings.

1 Introduction

Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are defined as “id-
iosyncratic interpretations that cross word bound-
aries” (Sag et al., 2002). They tend to have a
standard syntactic structure but are often semanti-
cally non-compositional; i.e. their meaning is not
fully determined by their syntactic structure and the
meanings of their constituents. A classic example
is kick the bucket, which means to die rather than to
hit a bucket with the foot. These types of expres-
sions account for a large proportion of day-to-day
language interactions (Schuler and Joshi, 2011) and
present a significant problem for natural language
processing systems (Sag et al., 2002).

This paper presents a novel unsupervised ap-
proach to detecting the compositionality of MWEs,
specifically of verb-noun collocations. The idea is

that we can recognize compositional phrases by sub-
stituting related words for constituent words in the
phrase: if the result of a substitution yields a mean-
ingful phrase, its individual constituents are likely to
contribute toward the overall meaning of the phrase.
Conversely, if a substitution yields a non-sensical
phrase, its constituents are likely to contribute less
or not at all to the overall meaning of the phrase.
For the phrase eat her hat, for example, we might
consider the following substituted phrases:

1. consume her hat

2. eat her trousers

Both phrases are semantically anomalous, implying
that eat hat is a highly non-compositional verb-noun
collocation. Following a similar procedure for eat
apple, however, would not lead to an anomaly: con-
sume apple and eat pear are perfectly meaningful,
leading us to believe that eat apple is compositional.

In the context of distributional models, this idea
can be formalised in terms of vector spaces:

the average distance between a phrase
vector and its substituted phrase vectors is
related to its compositionality.

Since we are relying on the relative distances of
phrases in semantic space, we require a method
for computing vectors for phrases. We experi-
mented with a number of composition operators
from Mitchell and Lapata (2010), in order to com-
pose constituent word vectors into phrase vectors.
The relation between phrase vectors and substituted
phrase vectors is most pronounced in the case of

1427



pointwise multiplication, which has the effect of
placing semantically anomalous phrases relatively
close together in space (since the vectors for the con-
stituent words have little in common), whereas the
semantically meaningful phrases are further apart.
This implies that compositional phrases are less sim-
ilar to their neighbours, which is to say that the
greater the average distance between a phrase vec-
tor and its substituted phrase vectors, the greater its
compositionality.

The contribution of this short focused research pa-
per is a novel approach to detecting the composition-
ality of multi-word expressions that makes full use
of the ability of semantic vector space models to cal-
culate distances between words and phrases. Using
this unsupervised approach, we achieve state-of-the-
art performance in a direct comparison with existing
supervised methods.

2 Dataset and Vectors

The verb-noun collocation dataset from Venkatapa-
thy and Joshi (2005), which consists of 765 verb-
object pairs with human compositionality ratings,
was used for evaluation. Venkatapathy & Joshi used
a support vector machine (SVM) to obtain a Spear-
man ρs correlation of 0.448. They employed a va-
riety of features ranging from frequency to LSA-
derived similarity measures and used 10% of the
dataset as training data with tenfold cross-validation.
McCarthy et al. (2007) used the same dataset and ex-
panded on the original approach by adding WordNet
and distributional prototypes to the SVM, achieving
a ρs correlation of 0.454.

The distributional vectors for our experiments
were constructed from the ukWaC corpus (Baroni
et al., 2009). Vectors were obtained using a stan-
dard window method (with a window size of 5) and
the 50,000 most frequent context words as features,
with stopwords removed. We also experimented
with syntax-based co-occurrence features extracted
from a dependency-parsed version of ukWaC, but
in agreement with results obtained by Schulte im
Walde et al. (2013) for predicting compositional-
ity in German, the window-based co-occurrence
method produced better results.

We tried several weighting schemes from the liter-
ature, such as t-test (Curran, 2004), positive mutual

information (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012) and the ra-
tio of the probability of the context word given the
target word1 to the context word’s overall probabil-
ity (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010). We found that a
tf-idf variant called LTU yielded the best results, de-
fined as follows (Reed et al., 2006):

wij =
(log(fij) + 1.0) log( Nnj )

0.8 + 0.2× |context word||avg context word|

where fij is the number of times that the target word
and context word co-occur in the same window, nj
is the context word frequency, N is the total fre-
quency and |context word| is the total number of oc-
currences of a context word. Distance is calculated
using the standard cosine measure:

dist(v1, v2) = 1−
v1 · v2
|v1||v2|

where v1 and v2 are vectors in the semantic vector
space model.

3 Finding Neighbours and Computing
Compositionality

We experimented with two different ways of obtain-
ing neighbours for the constituent words in a phrase.
Since vector space models lend themselves naturally
to similarity computations, one way to get neigh-
bours is to take the k-most similar vectors from a
similarity matrix. This approach is straightforward,
but has some potential drawbacks: it assumes that
we have a large number of vectors to select neigh-
bours from, and becomes computationally expensive
when the number of neighbours is increased.

An alternative source for obtaining neighbours is
the lexical database WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). We
define neighbours as siblings in the hypernym hier-
archy, so that the neighbours of a word can be found
by taking the hyponyms of its hypernyms. Word-
Net also allows us to extract only neighbours of the
same grammatical type (yielding noun neighbours
for nouns and verb neighbours for verbs, for exam-
ple). Since not every word has the same number
of neighbours in WordNet, we use only the first k

1We use target word to refer to the word for which a vector
is being constructed.

1428



neighbours, which means that the neighbours have
to be ranked. An obvious ranking method is to use
the frequency with which each neighbour co-occurs
with the other constituent(s) of the same phrase. For
example, for all the WordNet neighbours of eat (for
all senses of eat), we count the co-occurrences with
hat in a given window size and rank them accord-
ingly. This ranking method also has the desirable
side-effect of performing some word sense disam-
biguation, at least in some cases. For example, the
highly ranked neighbours of apple for eat apple are
likely to be items of food, and not (inedible) trees
(apple is also a tree in WordNet).

In order to obtain frequency-ranked neighbours,
we used the ukWaC corpus with a window size of
5. One reason for having multiple neighbours is that
it allows us to correct for word sense disambigua-
tion errors (as mentioned above), since averaging
over results for several neighbours reduces the im-
pact of including incorrect senses. For example, the
first 20 neighbours of eat, ranked by co-occurrence
frequency with all the objects of eat in the dataset,
are:

eat use consume drink sample smoke
swallow spend break hit save afford burn
partake dine breakfast worry damage de-
plete drug

One problem with the evaluation dataset is that
it does not solely consist of verb-noun pairs: 84
phrases contain pronouns, while there are also sev-
eral examples containing words that WordNet con-
siders to be adjectives rather than nouns. This prob-
lem was mitigated by part-of-speech tagging the
dataset. As neighbours for pronouns (which are not
included in WordNet), we used the other pronouns
present in the dataset. For the remaining words,
we included the part-of-speech when looking up the
word in WordNet.

3.1 Average distance compositionality score

We considered several different ways of construct-
ing phrasal vectors. We chose not to use the com-
positional models of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010)
and Socher et al. (2011) because we believe that it is
important that our methods are completely unsuper-
vised and do not require any initial learning phase.

Hence, we experimented with different ways of con-
structing phrasal vectors according to Mitchell and
Lapata (2010) and found that pointwise multiplica-
tion � worked best in our experiments. Thus, we
define the composed vector

−−−−→
eat hat as:

−→
eat�

−→
hat

We can now compute a compositionality score sc by
averaging the distance between the original phrase
vector and its substituted neighbour phrase vectors
via the following formula:

sc(
−−−−→
eat hat) =

1

2k
(

k∑
i=1

dist(
−→
eat�

−→
hat,

−→
eat�

−−−−−−−→
neighbouri) +

k∑
j=1

dist(
−→
eat�

−→
hat,

−−−−−−−→
neighbourj �

−→
hat))

We also experimented with substituting only for
the noun or the verb, and in fact found that only tak-
ing neighbours for the verb yields better results:

sc(
−−−−→
eat hat) =

1

k

k∑
j=1

dist(
−→
eat�

−→
hat,

−−−−−−−→
neighbourj �

−→
hat)

To illustrate the method, consider the collocations
take breath and lend money. The annotators as-
signed these phrases a compositionality score of 1
out of 6 and 6 out of 6, respectively, meaning that the
former is non-compositional and the latter is com-
positional. The distances between the first ten verb-
substituted phrases and the original phrase, together
with the average distance, are shown in Table 1 and
Table 2.

Substituting the verb in the non-compositional
phrase yields semantically anomalous vectors,
which leads to very small changes in the distance
between it and the original phrase vector. This is a
result of using pointwise multiplication, where over-
lapping components are stressed: since the vectors
for take and breath have little overlap outside of

1429



Neighbour Dist
get breath 0.049
find breath 0.051
use breath 0.050
work breath 0.060
hold breath 0.094
run breath 0.079
carry breath 0.076
look breath 0.065
play breath 0.071
buy breath 0.100
AvgDist 0.069

Table 1: Example take breath

Neighbour Dist
pay money 0.446
put money 0.432
bring money 0.405
provide money 0.442
owe money 0.559
sell money 0.404
cost money 0.482
look money 0.425
distribute money 0.544
offer money 0.428
AvgDist 0.457

Table 2: Example lend money

the idiomatic sense in take breath, its neighbour-
substituted phrases also have little overlap, result-
ing in a smaller change in distance upon substitu-
tion. Conversely, substituting the verb in the com-
positional phrase yields meaningful vectors, putting
them in locations in semantic vector space which are
sufficiently far apart to distinguish them from the
non-compositional cases.

4 Results

Results are given for the two methods of obtaining
neighbours: via frequency-ranked WordNet neigh-
bours and via vector space neighbours. The com-
positionality score was computed by using only the
verb, only the noun, or both constituent neighbours
in the substituted phrase vectors.

AvgDist VSM neighbours-noun 0.245
AvgDist WN-ranked neighbours-both 0.165
AvgDist WN-ranked neighbours-verb 0.461
AvgDist WN-ranked neighbours-noun 0.169

Table 3: Spearman ρs results

The results are compared with the scores reported
in Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) and McCarthy et
al. (2007), which were achieved using SVMs with a
wide variety of features. Values of 1 ≤ k ≤ 20 were
tried. If a phrase has fewer than k neighbours be-
cause not enough neighbours have been found to co-
occur with the other constituent, we use all of them.
The results for k = 20 are reported here because
that gave the best overall score. The dataset has an
inter-annotator agreement of Kendall’s τ of 0.61 and
a Spearman ρs of 0.71 and all reported differences
in values are highly significant. Table 3 gives the
results.

Note that, even though the current approach is un-
supervised (in terms of not having access to compo-
sitionality ratings during training, although it does
rely on WordNet), it outperforms SVMs that require
an ensemble of complex feature sets (some of which
are also based on WordNet).

It is interesting to observe that the state-of-the-art
performance is reached when only using the verb’s
neighbours to compute substituted phrase vectors.
One might initially expect this not to be the case,
since e.g. eat trousers, where the noun has been
substituted, does not make a lot of sense either —
which we would expect to be informative for de-
termining compositionality. There are two possi-
ble explanations for this, which might be at play
simultaneously: since our dataset consists of verb-
object pairs, the verb constituent is always the head
word of the phrase, and the dataset contains several
so-called “light verbs”, which have little semantic
content of their own. Head words have been found
to have a higher impact on compositionality scores
for compound nouns: Reddy et al. (2011) weighted

1430



the contribution of individual constituents in such a
way that the modifier’s contribution is included but
is weighted less highly than the head’s contribution,
which led to an improvement in performance. Our
results might be improved by weighting the contri-
bution of constituent words in a similar fashion, and
by more closely examining the impact of light verbs
for the compositionality of a phrase.

5 Related Work

The past decade has seen extensive work on compu-
tational and statistical methods in detecting the com-
positionality of MWEs (Lin, 1999; Schone and Ju-
rafsky, 2001; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Sporleder
and Li, 2009; Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011).
Many of these methods rely on distributional mod-
els and vector space models (Schütze, 1993; Tur-
ney and Pantel, 2010; Erk, 2012). Work has been
done on different types of phrases, including work
on particle verbs (McCarthy et al., 2003; Bannard
et al., 2003), verb-noun collocations (Venkatapathy
and Joshi, 2005; McCarthy et al., 2007), adjective-
noun combinations (Vecchi et al., 2011) and noun-
noun compounds (Reddy et al., 2011), as well as on
languages other than English (Schulte im Walde et
al., 2013). Recent developments in distributional
compositional models (Widdows, 2008; Mitchell
and Lapata, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Co-
ecke et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011) have opened
up a number of possibilities for constructing vectors
for phrases, which have also been applied to com-
positionality tests (Giesbrecht, 2009; Kochmar and
Briscoe, 2013).

This paper takes that work a step further: by con-
structing phrase vectors and evaluating these vectors
on a dataset of human compositionality ratings, we
show that existing compositional models allow us to
detect compositionality of multi-word expressions
in a straightforward and intuitive manner.

6 Conclusion

We have presented a novel unsupervised approach
that can be used to detect the compositionality of
multi-word expressions. Our results show that the
underlying intuition appears to be sound: substitut-
ing neighbours may lead to meaningful or meaning-
less phrases depending on whether or not the phrase

is compositional. This can be formalized in vec-
tor space models to obtain compositionality scores
by computing the average distance to the original
phrase’s substituted neighbour phrases. In this short
focused research paper, we show that, depending on
how we obtain neighbours, we are able to achieve
a higher performance than that achieved by super-
vised methods which rely on a complex feature set
and support vector machines.
