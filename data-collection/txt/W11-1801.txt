Abstract

The BioNLP Shared Task 2011, an informa-
tion extraction task held over 6 months up to
March 2011, met with community-wide par-
ticipation, receiving 46 final submissions from
24 teams. Five main tasks and three support-
ing tasks were arranged, and their results show
advances in the state of the art in fine-grained
biomedical domain information extraction and
demonstrate that extraction methods success-
fully generalize in various aspects.

1 Introduction

The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter)
series represents a community-wide move toward
fine-grained information extraction (IE), in particu-
lar biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al., 2009;
Ananiadou et al., 2010). The series is complemen-
tary to BioCreative (Hirschman et al., 2007); while
BioCreative emphasizes the short-term applicability
of introduced IE methods for tasks such as database
curation, BioNLP-ST places more emphasis on the
measurability of the state-of-the-art and traceabil-
ity of challenges in extraction through an approach
more closely tied to text.

These goals were pursued in the first event,
BioNLP-ST 2009 (Kim et al., 2009), through high
quality benchmark data provided for system devel-
opment and detailed evaluation performed to iden-
tify remaining problems hindering extraction perfor-

mance. Also, as the complexity of the task was high
and system development time limited, we encour-
aged focus on fine-grained IE by providing gold an-
notation for named entities as well as various sup-
porting resources. BioNLP-ST 2009 attracted wide
attention, with 24 teams submitting final results. The
task setup and data since have served as the basis
for numerous studies (Miwa et al., 2010b; Poon and
Vanderwende, 2010; Vlachos, 2010; Miwa et al.,
2010a; Björne et al., 2010).

As the second event of the series, BioNLP-ST
2011 preserves the general design and goals of the
previous event, but adds a new focus on variabil-
ity to address a limitation of BioNLP-ST 2009: the
benchmark data sets were based on the Genia corpus
(Kim et al., 2008), restricting the community-wide
effort to resources developed by a single group for
a small subdomain of molecular biology. BioNLP-
ST 2011 is organized as a joint effort of several
groups preparing various tasks and resources, in
which variability is pursued in three primary direc-
tions: text types, event types, and subject domains.
Consequently, generalization of fine grained bio-IE
in these directions is emphasized as the main theme
of the second event.

This paper summarizes the entire BioNLP-ST
2011, covering the relationships between tasks and
similar broad issues. Each task is presented in detail
in separate overview papers and extraction systems
in papers by participants.

2 Main tasks

BioNLP-ST 2011 includes four main tracks (with
five tasks) representing fine-grained bio-IE.

2.1 Genia task (GE)

The GE task (Kim et al., 2011) preserves the task
definition of BioNLP-ST 2009, arranged based on
the Genia corpus (Kim et al., 2008). The data repre-
sents a focused domain of molecular biology: tran-
scription factors in human blood cells. The purpose
of the GE task is two-fold: to measure the progress
of the community since the last event, and to eval-
uate generalization of the technology to full papers.
For the second purpose, the provided data is com-
posed of two collections: the abstract collection,
identical to the BioNLP-ST 2009 data, and the new
full paper collection. Progress on the task is mea-
sured through the unchanged task definition and the
abstract collection, while generalization to full pa-
pers is measured on the full paper collection. In this
way, the GE task is intended to connect the entire
event to the previous one.

2.2 Epigenetics and post-translational
modification task (EPI)

The EPI task (Ohta et al., 2011) focuses on IE for
protein and DNA modifications, with particular em-
phasis on events of epigenetics interest. While the
basic task setup and entity definitions follow those of
the GE task, EPI extends on the extraction targets by
defining 14 new event types relevant to task topics,
including major protein modification types and their
reverse reactions. For capturing the ways in which
different entities participate in these events, the task
extends the GE argument roles with two new roles
specific to the domain, Sidechain and Contextgene.
The task design and setup are oriented toward the
needs of pathway extraction and curation for domain
databases (Wu et al., 2003; Ongenaert et al., 2008)
and are informed by previous studies on extraction
of the target events (Ohta et al., 2010b; Ohta et al.,
2010c).

2.3 Infectious diseases task (ID)

The ID task (Pyysalo et al., 2011a) concerns the ex-
traction of events relevant to biomolecular mecha-
nisms of infectious diseases from full-text publica-

tions. The task follows the basic design of BioNLP-
ST 2009, and the ID entities and extraction targets
are a superset of the GE ones. The task extends
considerably on core entities, adding to PROTEIN
four new entity types, including CHEMICAL and
ORGANISM. The events extend on the GE defini-
tions in allowing arguments of the new entity types
as well as in introducing a new event category for
high-level biological processes. The task was im-
plemented in collaboration with domain experts and
informed by prior studies on domain information ex-
traction requirements (Pyysalo et al., 2010; Anani-
adou et al., 2011), including the support of systems
such as PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org).

2.4 Bacteria track

The bacteria track consists of two tasks, BB and BI.

2.4.1 Bacteria biotope task (BB)

The aim of the BB task (Bossy et al., 2011) is to ex-
tract the habitats of bacteria mentioned in textbook-
level texts written for non-experts. The texts are
Web pages about the state of the art knowledge about
bacterial species. BB targets general relations, Lo-
calization and PartOf , and is challenging in that
texts contain more coreferences than usual, habitat
references are not necessarily named entities, and,
unlike in other BioNLP-ST 2011 tasks, all entities
need to be recognized by participants. BB is the first
task to target phenotypic information and, as habi-
tats are yet to be normalized by the field community,
presents an opportunity for the BioNLP community
to contribute to the standardization effort.

2.4.2 Bacteria interaction task (BI)

The BI task (Jourde et al., 2011) is devoted to the ex-
traction of bacterial molecular interactions and reg-
ulations from publication abstracts. Mainly focused
on gene transcriptional regulation in Bacillus sub-
tilis, the BI corpus is provided to participants with
rich semantic annotation derived from a recently
proposed ontology (Manine et al., 2009) defining
ten entity types such as gene, protein and deriva-
tives as well as DNA sites/motifs. Their interactions
are described through ten relation types. The BI
corpus consists of the sentences of the LLL corpus
(Nédellec, 2005), provided with manually checked
linguistic annotations.

2.5 Characteristics of main tasks

The main tasks are characterized in Table 1. From
the text type perspective, BioNLP-ST 2011 gener-
alizes from abstracts in 2009 to full papers (GE and
ID) and web pages (BB). It also includes data collec-
tions for a variety of specific subject domains (GE,
ID, BB an BI) and a task (EPI) whose scope is not
defined through a domain but rather event types. In
terms of the target event types, ID targets a superset
of GE events and EPI extends on the representation
for PHOSPHORYLATION events of GE. The two bac-
teria track tasks represent an independent perspec-
tive relatively far from other tasks in terms of their
target information.

3 Supporting tasks

BioNLP-ST 2011 includes three supporting tasks
designed to assist in primary the extraction tasks.
Other supporting resources made available to par-
ticipants are presented in (Stenetorp et al., 2011).

3.1 Protein coreference task (CO)

The CO task (Nguyen et al., 2011) concerns the
recognition of coreferences to protein references. It
is motivated from a finding from BioNLP-ST 2009
result analysis: coreference structures in biomedical
text hinder the extraction results of fine-grained IE
systems. While finding connections between event
triggers and protein references is a major part of
event extraction, it becomes much harder if one is
replaced with a coreferencing expression. The CO
task seeks to address this problem. The data sets for
the task were produced based on MedCO annotation
(Su et al., 2008) and other Genia resources (Tateisi
et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008).

3.2 Entity relations task (REL)

The REL task (Pyysalo et al., 2011b) involves the
recognition of two binary part-of relations between
entities: PROTEIN-COMPONENT and SUBUNIT-
COMPLEX. The task is motivated by specific chal-
lenges: the identification of the components of pro-
teins in text is relevant e.g. to the recognition of
Site arguments (cf. GE, EPI and ID tasks), and re-
lations between proteins and their complexes rele-
vant to any task involving them. REL setup is in-
formed by recent semantic relation tasks (Hendrickx
et al., 2010). The task data, consisting of new anno-
tations for GE data, extends a previously introduced
resource (Pyysalo et al., 2009; Ohta et al., 2010a).

3.3 Gene renaming task (REN)

The REN task (Jourde et al., 2011) objective is to ex-
tract renaming pairs of Bacillus subtilis gene/protein
names from PubMed abstracts, motivated by dis-
crepancies between nomenclature databases that in-
terfere with search and complicate normalization.
REN relations partially overlap several concepts:
explicit renaming mentions, synonymy, and renam-
ing deduced from biological proof. While the task
is related to synonymy relation extraction (Yu and
Agichtein, 2003), it has a novel definition of renam-
ing, one name permanently replacing the other.

4 Schedule

Table 2 shows the task schedule, split into two
phases to allow the use of supporting task results in
addressing the main tasks. In recognition of their
higher complexity, a longer development period was
arranged for the main tasks (3 months vs 7 weeks).

5 Participation

BioNLP-ST 2011 received 46 submissions from 24
teams (Table 3). While seven teams participated in
multiple tasks, only one team, UTurku, submitted fi-
nal results to all the tasks. The remaining 17 teams
participated in only single tasks. Disappointingly,
only two teams (UTurku, and ConcordU) performed
both supporting and main tasks, and neither used
supporting task analyses for the main tasks.

6 Results

Detailed evaluation results and analyses are pre-
sented in individual task papers, but interesting ob-
servations can be obtained also by comparisons over
the tasks. Table 4 summarizes best results for vari-
ous criteria (Note that the results shown for e.g. GEa,
GEf and GEp may be from different teams).

The community has made a significant improve-
ment in the repeated GE task, with an over 10%
reduction in error from ’09 to GEa. Three teams
achieved better results than M10, the best previously
reported individual result on the ’09 data. This in-
dicates a beneficial role from focused efforts like
BioNLP-ST. The GEf and ID results show that
generalization to full papers is feasible, with very
modest loss in performance compared to abstracts
(GEa). The results for PHOSPHORYLATION events
in GE and EPI are comparable (GEp vs EPIp), with
the small drop for the EPI result, suggesting that
the removal of the GE domain specificity does not
compromise extraction performance. EPIc results
indicate some challenges in generalization to simi-
lar event types, and EPIf suggest substantial further
challenges in additional argument extraction. The
complexity of ID is comparable to GE, also reflected
to their final results, which further indicate success-

ful generalization to a new subject domain as well
as to new argument (entity) types. The BB task is
in part comparable to GEl and involves a represen-
tation similar to REL, with lower results likely in
part because BB requires entity recognition. The BI
task is comparable to LLL Challenge, though BI in-
volves more entity and event types. The BI result
is 20 points above the LLL best result, indicating a
substantial progress of the community in five years.

7 Discussion and Conclusions

Meeting with wide participation from the commu-
nity, BioNLP-ST 2011 produced a wealth of valu-
able resources for the advancement of fine-grained
IE in biology and biomedicine, and demonstrated
that event extraction methods can successfully gen-
eralize to new text types, event types, and domains.
However, the goal to observe the capacity of sup-
porting tasks to assist the main tasks was not met.
The entire shared task period was very long, more
than 6 months, and the complexity of the task was
high, which could be an excessive burden for partic-
ipants, limiting the application of novel resources.
There have been ongoing efforts since BioNLP-ST
2009 to develop IE systems based on the task re-
sources, and we hope to see continued efforts also
following BioNLP-ST 2011, especially exploring
the use of supporting task resources for main tasks.
