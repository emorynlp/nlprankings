Abstract

This paper describes work testing agile
data annotation by moving away from the
traditional, linear phases of corpus cre-
ation towards iterative ones and by recog-
nizing the potential for sources of error oc-
curring throughout the annotation process.

1 Introduction

Annotated data sets are an important resources for
various research fields, including natural language
processing (NLP) and text mining (TM). While the
detection of annotation inconsistencies in different
data sets has been investigated (e.g. Novák and
Razı́mová, 2009) and their effect on NLP perfor-
mance has been studied (e.g. Alex et al. 2006), very
little work has been done on deriving better methods
of annotation as a whole process in order to maxi-
mize both the quality and quantity of annotated data.
This paper describes our annotation project in which
we tested the relatively new approach of agile cor-
pus annotation (Voormann and Gut, 2008) of mov-
ing away from the traditional, linear phases of cor-
pus creation towards iterative ones and of recogniz-
ing the fact that sources of error can occur through-
out the annotation process.

We explain agile annotation and discuss related
work in Section 2. Section 3 describes the en-
tire annotation process and all its aspects. We pro-
vide details on the data collection and preparation,
the annotation tool, the annotators and the annota-
tion phases. Section 4 describes the final annota-
tion scheme and Section 5 presents inter-annotator-
agreement (IAA) figures measured throughout the
annotation. In Section 6, we summarize the per-
formance of the machine-learning (ML)-based TM
components which were trained and evaluated on the
annotated data. We discuss our findings and con-
clude in Section 7.

2 Background and Related Work

The manual and automatic annotation work de-
scribed in this paper was conducted as part of the
TXV project. The technology used was based
on TM components that were originally developed
for the biomedical domain during its predecessor
project (Alex et al., 2008b). In TXV we adapted
the tools to the recruitment domain in a short time
frame. The aim was to extract key information from
curricula vitae (CVs) for matching applicants to job
adverts and to each other. The TM output is visu-
alized in a web application with search navigation
that captures relationships between candidates, their
skills and organizations etc. This web interface al-
lows recruiters to find hidden information in large
volumes of unstructured text.

Both projects were managed using agile, test-
driven software development, i.e. solutions were
created based on the principles of rapid-prototyping
and iterative development cycles of deliverable ver-
sions of the TM system and the web application.1

The same principles were also applied to other
project work, including the manual annotation. The
aim of this annotation was to produce annotated data
for training ML-based TM technology as well as
evaluating system components.

Collecting data, drawing up annotation guidelines
and getting annotators to annotate this data in se-
quential steps is similar to the waterfall model in
software engineering (Royce, 1970). This approach
can be inefficient and costly if annotators unknow-
ingly carried out work that could have been avoided
and it can lead to difficulties if at the end of the pro-
cess the requirements no longer match the annota-
tions. Instead we applied agile software engineering
methods to the process of creating annotated data.
This is a relatively recent philosophy in software

development which was inspired to overcome the
drawbacks of the waterfall model. The idea of ap-
plying agile methods to corpus creation and annota-
tion was first inspired by Voormann and Gut (2008)
but was not tested empirically. Cyclic annotation
was already proposed by Atkins et al. (1992) and
Biber (1993) with a focus on data creation rather
than data annotation. In this paper, we describe a
way of testing this agile annotation in practice.

The idea behind an agile annotation process is
to produce useable manually annotated data fast as
well as discover and correct flaws in either the an-
notation guidelines or the annotation setup early on.
Voormann and Gut (2008) propose query-driven an-
notation, a cyclic corpus creation and annotation
process that begins with formulating a query. The
main advantages of this approach are:

• The annotation scheme evolves over time
which ensures that annotations are consistent
and remain focussed on the research that is
carried out. An iterative annotation process
therefore improves the annotation guidelines
but keeps the annotations suitable to the rele-
vant research questions.

• Problems with the annotation guidelines, er-
rors in the annotation and issues with the setup
become apparent immediately and can be cor-
rected early on. This can avoid difficulties later
on and will save time and cost.

• Some annotation data is available early on.

Voormann and Gut compare the cyclical approach
in agile annotation to traditional linear-phrase cor-
pus creation depicted in Figure 1. In the following
section we describe the annotation process in our
project which followed the principles of agile cor-
pus creation.

3 Annotation Process
This section provides an overview of all aspect in-
volved in the annotation of a data set of CVs for
various types of semantic information useful to re-
cruiters when analysing CVs and placing candidates
with particular jobs or organizations. We provide
information on the data collection, the document
preparation, the annotation tool and the annotation
process following agile methods.

3.1 Data Collection
We automatically collected a set of CVs of soft-
ware engineers and programmers which are publicly
available online. This data set was created by firstly
querying Google using the Google API2 for word
documents containing either the terms ”CV”, ”re-
sume” or ”curriculum vitae” as well as the terms
”developer”, ”programmer” or ”software” but ex-
cluding documents containing the word ”template”
or ”sample”. Furthermore, the query was restricted
to a 3-month period from 30/03 to 30/06/2008.3

We automatically downloaded the Word docu-
ments returned by this query, resulting in a pool of
1,000 candidate CVs available for annotation. We
split these documents randomly into a TRAIN, a DE-
VTEST and a TEST set in a ratio of approximately
64:16:20. We used the annotated TRAIN data for
training ML-based models and deriving rules and
the DEVTEST data for system development and op-
timization. We set aside the blind TEST set for
evaluating the final performance of our named en-
tity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE)

2http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch
3The exact Google query is: ’(CV OR resume OR ”cur-

riculum vitae”) AND (developer OR programmer OR soft-
ware) AND filetype:doc AND -template AND -sample AND
daterange:2454466-2454647’.

components (see Section 6).
The final manually annotated data set contains

403 files, of which 352 are singly and 51 doubly an-
notated, resulting in an overall total of 454 annota-
tions (see Table 1). This does not include the files
used during the pilot annotation. The doubly an-
notated CVs were used to determine inter-annotator
agreement (IAA) in regular intervals (see Section 5).

Some of the documents in the pool were not gen-
uine CVs but either job adverts or CV writing ad-
vice. We let the annotators carry out the filtering
process of only choosing genuine CVs of software
developers and programmers for annotation and re-
ject but record any documents that did not fit this cat-
egory. The annotators rejected 99 files as being ei-
ther not CVs at all (49) or being out-of-domain CVs
from other types of professionals (50). Therefore,
just over 50% of the documents in the pool were
used up during the annotation process.

3.2 Document Preparation

Before annotation, all candidate CVs were then au-
tomatically converted from Word DOC format to
OpenOffice ODT as well as to Acrobat PDF format
in a batch process using OpenOffice macros. The
resulting contents.xml files for each ODT version of
the documents contain the textual information of the
original CVs. An XSLT stylesheet was used to sim-
plify this format to a simpler in-house XML format,
as the input into our pre-processing pipeline. We re-
tained all formatting and style information in span
elements for potential later use.

The pre-processing includes tokenization, sen-
tence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging,
lemmatization, chunking, abbreviation detection
and rule-based NER for person, location names and
dates. This information extraction system is a mod-
ular pipeline built around the LT-XML24 and LT-
TTT25 toolsets. The NER output is stored as stand-

5http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/lt-ttt2

off annotations in the XML. These pre-processed
files were used as the basis for annotation.

3.3 Annotation Tool

For annotating the text of the CVs we chose
MMAX2, the Java-based open source tool (Müller
and Strube, 2006).6 MMAX2 supports multiple lev-
els of annotation by way of stand-off annotation.
As a result MMAX2 creates one separate file for
each level of annotation for each given base data file.
Only the annotation level files get edited during the
annotation phase. The base data files which con-
tain the textual information of the documents do not
change. In our project, we were interested in three
levels of annotation, one for named entities (NEs),
one for zones and one for relations between NEs.
The MMAX2 GUI allows annotators to mark up
nested structures as well as intra- and inter-sentential
relations. Both of these functionalities were crucial
to our annotation effort.

As the files used for annotation already con-
tained some NEs which were recognized automat-
ically using the rule-based NER system and stored
in standoff XML, the conversion into and out of the
MMAX2 format was relatively straightforward. For
each file to be annotated, we created one base file
containing the tokenized text and one entity file con-
taining the rule-based NEs.7

3.4 Annotation Phases

We employed 3 annotators with various degrees of
experience in annotation and computer science and
therefore familiar with software engineering skills
and terminology. The lead researcher of the project,
the first author of this paper, managed the annotators
and organized regular meetings with them.

We followed the agile corpus creation approach
and carried out cycles of annotations, starting with
a simple paper-based pilot annotation. This first an-
notation of 10 documents enabled us to get a first
impression of the type of information contained in
CVs of software engineers and programmers as well
as the type of information we wanted to capture in
the manual and automatic annotation. We drew up a
first set of potential types of zones that occur within

Strube (2006).

31



CVs and the types of NEs that can be found within
each zone (e.g. an EDUCATION zone containing NEs
of type LOC, ORG and QUAL).

Using this set of potential markables, we decided
on a subset of NEs and zones to be annotated in fu-
ture rounds. Regarding the zones, we settled on an-
notating zone titles in a similar way as NEs. Our
assumption was that recognizing the beginning of a
zone can sufficiently identify zone boundaries. We
did not include relations between NEs at this stages,
as we wanted to get a clearer idea of the definitions
of relevant NEs first before proceeding to relations.

We then carried out a second pilot annotation us-
ing 10 more CVs selected from the candidate pool.
We used the revised annotation scheme and this
time the annotation was done electronically using
MMAX2. The annotators also had access to the
PDF and DOC versions of each file in case crucial
structural or formatting information was lost in the
conversion. Files were annotated for NEs and zone
titles. We also asked the annotators to answer the
following questions:

• Does it make sense to annotate the proposed
markables and what are the difficulties in doing
so?

• Are there any interesting markables missing
from the list?

• Are there are any issues with using the annota-
tion tool?

Half way through the second pilot we scheduled a
further meeting to discuss their answers, addressed
any question, comments or issues with regard to the
annotation and adjusted the annotation guidelines
accordingly. At this point, as we felt that the defini-
tions of NEs were sufficiently clear and added guide-
lines for annotating various types of binary relations
between NEs, for example a LOC-ORG relation re-
ferring to a particular organization situated at a par-
ticular location, e.g. Google - Dublin. We list the
final set of markables as defined at the end of the
annotation process in Tables 2 and 3.

During the second half of the second pilot we
asked the annotators to time their annotation and es-
tablished that it can take between 30 minutes and 1.5
hours to annotate a CV. We then calculated pairwise
IAA for two doubly annotated files which allowed

us to get some evidence for which definition of NEs,
zone titles and relations were still ambiguous or not
actually relevant.

In parallel with both pilots, we also liaised closely
with a local recruitment company to gain a first-
hand understanding of what information recruiters
are interested in when matching candidates to em-
ployments or employers. This consultation as well
as the conclusions made after the second pilot led
to further adaptions of the annotation scheme before
the main annotation phase began.

Based on the feedback from the second pilot an-
notation, we also made some changes to the data
conversion and the annotation tool setup to reduce
the amount of work for annotators but without re-
stricting the set of markables. In the case of some
nested NEs, we propagated relations between em-
bedded NEs that could be referred from the relations
of the containing NEs. For example, two DATE enti-
ties nested within a DATERANGE entity, the latter of
which the annotator related to an ORG entity, were
related to the same ORG entity automatically. We
also introduced a general GROUP entity which could
be used by the annotators to mark up lists of NEs,
for example, if they were all related to a different
NE mention of type X. In that case, the annotators
only had to mark up a relation between the GROUP
and X. All implicit relations between the NEs nested
in the GROUP and X were propagated during the con-
version from the MMAX2 format back into the in-
house XML format. This proved particularly useful
for annotating relations between SKILL entities and
other types of NEs.

Once those changes had been made, the main an-
notation phase began. Each in-domain CV that was
loaded into the annotation tool already contained
some NEs pre-annotated by the rule-based NER sys-
tem (see Section 3.2). The annotators had to correct
the annotations in case they were erroneous. Over-
all, the annotators reported this pre-annotation to be
useful rather than hindering as they did not have to
do too many corrections. At the end of each day, the
annotators checked in their work into the project’s
subversion (SVN) repository. This provided us with
additional control and backup in case we needed to
go back to previous versions at later stages.

The annotation guidelines still evolved during the
main annotation. Regular annotation meetings were

32



held in case the annotators had questions on the
guidelines or if they wanted to discuss specific ex-
amples. If a change was made to the annotation
guidelines, all annotators were informed and asked
to update their annotations accordingly. Moreover,
IAA was calculated regularly on sub-sections of the
doubly annotated data. This provided more empiri-
cal evidence for the types of markables the annota-
tors found difficult to mark up and where clarifica-
tions where necessary. The reasons for this were that
their definitions were ambiguous or underspecified.

We deliberately kept the initial annotation scheme
simple. The idea was for the annotators to shape the
annotation scheme based on evidence in the actual
data. We believe that this approach made the data
set more useful for its final use to train and evaluate
TM components. As a result of this agile annotation
approach, we became aware of any issues very early
on and were able to correct them accordingly.

4 Annotation Scheme

In this section, we provide a summary of the final
annotation scheme as an overview of all the mark-
ables present in the annotated data set.

4.1 Named Entities
In general, we asked the annotators to mark up ev-
ery mention of all NE types throughout the entire
CV, even if they did not refer to the CV owner. With
some exceptions (DATE in DATERANGE and LOC or
ORG in ADDRESS), annotators were asked to avoid
nested NEs and aim for a flat annotation. Discontin-
uous NEs in coordinated structures had to be marked
as such, i.e. the NE should only contain strings that
refer to it. Finally, abbreviations and their defini-
tions had to be annotated as two separate NEs. The
NE types in the final annotation guidelines are listed
in Table 2. While carrying out the NE annotation,
the annotators were also asked to set the NE at-
tribute of type CANDIDATE (by default set to true)
to false if a certain NE was not an attribute of the
CV owner (e.g. the ADDRESS of a referee).

4.2 Zone Titles
Regarding the zone titles, we provided a list of syn-
onyms for each type as context (see Table 2). The
annotators were asked only to annotate main zone
titles, ignoring sub-zones. They were also asked to

Entity Type Description
ADDRESS Addresses with streets or postcodes.
DATE Absolute (e.g. 10/04/2010), underspec-

ified (e.g. April 2010) or relative dates
(e.g. to date) including DATE entities
within DATERANGE entities.

DATERANGE Date ranges with a specific start and end
date including ones with either point not
explicitly stated (e.g. since 2008).

DOB Dates of birth.
EMAIL Email addresses.
JOB Job titles and roles referring to the of-

ficial name a post (e.g. software devel-
oper) but not a skill (e.g. software de-
velopment).

LOC Geo-political place names.
ORG Names of companies, institutions and

organizations.
PER Person names excluding titles.
PHONE Telephone and fax numbers.
POSTCODE Post codes.
QUAL Qualifications achieved or working to-

wards.
SKILL Skills and areas of expertise incl. hard

skills (e.g. Java, C++, French) or gen-
eral areas of expertise (e.g. software de-
velopment) but not soft or interpersonal
skills (e.g. networking, team work).

TIMESPAN Durations of time (e.g. 7 years, 2
months, over 2 years).

URL URLs
GROUP Dummy NE to group several NEs for

annotating multiple relations at once.
The individual NEs contained within
the group still have to be annotated.

Zone Title Type Synonyms

mark up only the relevant sub-string of the text re-
ferring to the zone title and not the entire title if it
contained irrelevant information.

4.3 Relations

The binary relations that were annotated (see Table
3) always link two different types of NE mentions.
Annotators were asked to mark up relations within
the same zone but not across zones.

33



Relation Type Description
TEMP-SKILL A skill related to a temporal expression

(e.g. Java - 7 years). TEMP includes any
temporal NE types (DATE, DATERANGE
and TIMESPAN).

TEMP-LOC A location related to a temporal expres-
sion (e.g. Dublin - summer 2004).

TEMP-ORG An organization related to a temporal
expression (e.g. Google - 2001-2004).

TEMP-JOB A job title related to a temporal ex-
pression (e.g. Software Engineer -
Sep. 2001 to Jun. 2004).

TEMP-QUAL A qualification related to a temporal ex-
pression (e.g. PhD - June 2004).

LOC-ORG An organization related to a location
(e.g. Google - Dublin).

LOC-JOB A job title related to a location
(e.g. Software Engineer - Dublin).

LOC-QUAL A qualification related to a location
(e.g. PhD - Dublin).

ORG-JOB A job title related to an organization
(e.g. Software Engineer - Google).

ORG-QUAL A qualification related to an organiza-
tion (e.g. PhD - University of Toronto).

GROUP-X A relation that can be assigned in case
a group of NEs all relate to another NE
X. GROUP-X can be any of the relation
pairs mentioned in this list.

Table 3: The types of relations annotated.

5 Inter-Annotator Agreement

We first calculated pairwise IAA for all markables
at the end of the 2nd pilot and continued doing so
throughout the main annotation phase. For each pair
of annotations on the same document, IAA was cal-
culated by scoring one annotator against another us-
ing precision (P), recall (R) and F1.8 An overall IAA
was calculated by micro-averaging across all anno-
tated document pairs.9 We used F1 rather than the
Kappa score (Cohen, 1960) to measure IAA as the
latter requires comparison with a random baseline,
which does not make sense for tasks such as NER.

Table 4 compares the IAA figures we obtained for
2 doubly annotated documents during the 2nd pilot
phase, i.e. the first time we measured IAA, to those
we obtained on 9 different files once the main an-
notation was completed. For NEs and zone titles,
IAA was calculated using P, R and F1, defining two
mentions as equal if they had the same left and right

8P, R and F1 are calculated in standard fashion from the
number of true positives, false positives and false negatives.

9Micro-averaging was chosen over macro-averaging, since
we felt that the latter would give undue weight to documents
with fewer markables.

boundaries and the same type. Although this com-
parison is done over different sub-sets of the corpus,
it is still possible to conclude that the NE IAA im-
proved considerably over the course of the annota-
tion process.

The IAA scores for the majority of NEs were in-
creased considerably at the end, with the exception
of SKILL for which the IAA ended up being slightly
lower as well as DOB and PER of which there are
not sufficient examples in either sets to obtain re-
liably results.10 There are very large increases in
IAA for JOB and ORG entities, as we discovered dur-
ing the pilot annotation that the guidelines for those
markables were not concrete enough regarding their
boundaries and definitions. Their final IAA figures
show that both of these types of NEs were still most
difficult to annotate at the end. However, a final total
IAA of 84.8 F1 for all NEs is a relatively high score.
In comparison, the final IAA score of 97.1 F1 for the
zone titles shows that recognizing zone titles is an
even easier task for humans to perform compared to
recognizing NEs.

When calculating IAA for relations, only those re-
lations for which both annotators agreed on the NEs
were included. This is done to get an idea of the
difficulty of the RE task independently of NER. Re-
lation IAA was also measured using F1, where rela-
tions are counted as equal if they connect exactly the
same NE pair. The IAA for relations between NEs
within CVs is relatively high both during the pilot
annotation and at the end of the main annotation and
only increased slightly over this time. These figures
show that this task is much easier than annotating re-
lations in other domains, e.g. in biomedical research
papers (Alex et al., 2008a).

The IAA figures show that even with cyclic anno-
tation, evolving guidelines and continuous updating,
human annotators can find it challenging to annotate
some markables consistently. This has an effect on
the results of the automatic annotation where the an-
notated data is used to train ML-based models and
to evaluate their performance.

10The reason why there are no figures for POSTCODE and
TIMESPAN entities for the pilot annotation is that none appeared
in those documents.

Table 4: IAA for NEs, zone titles and relations in precision (P), recall (R) and F1 at two stages in the
annotation process: (1) at the end of the second pilot annotation and (2) at the end of the main annotation
phase; as well as automatic annotation scores (3) on the blind TEST set. The total number of true positives
(TPs) is shown to provide an idea of the quantities of markables in each set.

6 Automatic Annotation

Table 4 also lists the final scores of the automatic
ML-based NER and RE components (Alex et al.,
2008b) which were adapted to the recruitment do-
main during the TXV project. Following agile
methods, we trained and evaluated models very
early into the annotation process. During the sys-
tem optimization, learning curves helped to investi-
gate for which markables having more training data
available would improve performance.

The NER component recognizes NEs and zone
titles simultaneously with an overall F1 of 71.4
(84.2% of IAA) and 63.2 (65.0% of IAA), respec-
tively. Extremely high or higher than average scores
were obtained for DATE, DATERANGE, EMAIL, LOC,
PHONE, POSTCODE, TIMESPAN and URL entities.
Mid-range to lower scores were obtained for AD-
DRESS, DOB, JOB, ORG, PER, QUAL and SKILL enti-
ties. One reason is the similarity between NE types,
e.g. DOB is difficult to differentiate from DATE. The
layout of CVs and the lack of full sentences also
pose a challenge as the NER component is trained
using contextual features surrounding NEs that are
often not present in CV data. Finally, the strict eval-
uation counts numerous boundary errors for NEs
which can be considered correct, e.g. the system
often recognizes organization names like “Sun Mi-
crosystems, Inc” whereas the annotator included the
full stop at the end (“Sun Microsystems, Inc.”).

The RE component (Haddow, 2008) performs
with an overall F1 of 59.0 on the CV TEST set
(69.7% of IAA). It yields high or above aver-
age scores for 10 relation types (DATE-LOC, DATE-
QUAL, DATERANGE-JOB, DATERANGE-LOC, DAT-
ERANGE-ORG, DATERANGE-QUAL, JOB-LOC, LOC-
ORG, LOC-QUAL, ORG-QUAL). It yields mid-range
to low scores for the other relation types (DATE-
JOB, DATE-ORG, DATERANGE-SKILL, DATE-SKILL,
JOB-ORG, JOB-TIMESPAN, LOC-TIMESPAN, ORG-
TIMESPAN, SKILL-TIMESPAN). The most frequent
type is DATERANGE-SKILL, a skill obtained during a
particular time period. Its entities tend to be found in
the same zone but not always in immediate context.
Such relations are inter-sentential, i.e. their entities
are in different sentences or what is perceived as sen-
tences by the system. Due to nature of the data, there
are few intra-sentential relations, relations between

NEs in the same sentence. The further apart two re-
lated NEs are, the more difficult it is to recognize
them. Similarly to NER, one challenge for RE from
CVs is their diverse structure and formatting.

7 Discussion and Conclusion

The increase in the IAA figures for the markables
over time show that agile corpus annotation resulted
in more qualitative annotations. It is difficult to
prove that the final annotation quality is higher than
it would have been had we followed the traditional
way of annotation. Comparing two such methods in
parallel is very difficult to achieve as the main aim
of annotation is usually to create a corpus and not to
investigate the best and most efficient method.

However, using the agile approach we identified
problems early on and made improvements to the
annotation scheme and the setup during the process
rather than at the end. Given a fixed annotation time
frame and the proportion of time we spent on cor-
recting errors throughout the annotation process, one
might conclude that we annotated less data than we
may have done, had we not followed the agile ap-
proach. However, Voormann and Hut (2008) argue
that agile annotation actually results in more useable
data at the end and in less data being thrown away.

Had we followed the traditional approach, we
would unlikely have planned a correction phase at
the end. The two main reason for that are cost
and the general belief that the more annotated data
the better. A final major correction phase is usu-
ally viewed as too expensive during an annotation
project. In order to avoid this cost, the traditional ap-
proach taken tends to be to create a set of annotation
guidelines when starting out and hold off the main
annotation until the guidelines are finalized and con-
sidered sufficiently defined. This approach does not
lend itself well to changes and adjustments later on
which are inevitable when dealing with natural lan-
guage. As a result the final less accurate annotated
corpus tends to be accepted as the ground truth or
gold standard and may not be as suitable and useful
for a given purpose as it could have been follow-
ing the agile annotation approach. Besides changing
the way in which annotators work, we recognize the
need for more flexible annotation tools that allow an-
notators to implement changes more rapidly.
