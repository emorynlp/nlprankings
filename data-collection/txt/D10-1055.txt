Abstract

We present the first evaluation of the utility of
automatic evaluation metrics on surface real-
izations of Penn Treebank data. Using outputs
of the OpenCCG and XLE realizers, along
with ranked WordNet synonym substitutions,
we collected a corpus of generated surface re-
alizations. These outputs were then rated and
post-edited by human annotators. We eval-
uated the realizations using seven automatic
metrics, and analyzed correlations obtained
between the human judgments and the auto-
matic scores. In contrast to previous NLG
meta-evaluations, we find that several of the
metrics correlate moderately well with human
judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with
the TER family performing best overall. We
also find that all of the metrics correctly pre-
dict more than half of the significant system-
level differences, though none are correct in
all cases. We conclude with a discussion of the
implications for the utility of such metrics in
evaluating generation in the presence of varia-
tion. A further result of our research is a cor-
pus of post-edited realizations, which will be
made available to the research community.

1 Introduction and Background

In building surface-realization systems for natural
language generation, there is a need for reliable
automated metrics to evaluate the output. Unlike
in parsing, where there is usually a single gold-
standard parse for a sentence, in surface realization
there are usually many grammatically-acceptable
ways to express the same concept. This parallels
the task of evaluating machine-translation (MT) sys-
tems: for a given segment in the source language,

there are usually several acceptable translations into
the target language. As human evaluation of trans-
lation quality is time-consuming and expensive, a
number of automated metrics have been developed
to evaluate the quality of MT outputs. In this study,
we investigate whether the metrics developed for
MT evaluation tasks can be used to reliably evaluate
the outputs of surface realizers, and which of these
metrics are best suited to this task.

A number of surface realizers have been devel-
oped using the Penn Treebank (PTB), and BLEU
scores are often reported in the evaluations of these
systems. But how useful is BLEU in this con-
text? The original BLEU study (Papineni et al.,
2001) scored MT outputs, which are of generally
lower quality than grammar-based surface realiza-
tions. Furthermore, even for MT systems, the
usefulness of BLEU has been called into question
(Callison-Burch et al., 2006). BLEU is designed to
work with multiple reference sentences, but in tree-
bank realization, there is only a single reference sen-
tence available for comparison.

A few other studies have investigated the use of
such metrics in evaluating the output of NLG sys-
tems, notably (Reiter and Belz, 2009) and (Stent et
al., 2005). The former examined the performance of
BLEU and ROUGE with computer-generated weather
reports, finding a moderate correlation with human
fluency judgments. The latter study applied sev-
eral MT metrics to paraphrase data from Barzilay
and Lee’s corpus-based system (Barzilay and Lee,
2003), and found moderate correlations with human
adequacy judgments, but little correlation with flu-
ency judgments. Cahill (2009) examined the perfor-
mance of six MT metrics (including BLEU) in evalu-
ating the output of a LFG-based surface realizer for

564



German, also finding only weak correlations with
the human judgments.

To study the usefulness of evaluation metrics such
as BLEU on the output of grammar-based surface
realizers used with the PTB, we assembled a cor-
pus of surface realizations from three different re-
alizers operating on Section 00 of the PTB. Two
human judges evaluated the adequacy and fluency
of each of the realizations with respect to the ref-
erence sentence. The realizations were then scored
with a number of automated evaluation metrics de-
veloped for machine translation. In order to investi-
gate the correlation of targeted metrics with human
evaluations, and gather other acceptable realizations
for future evaluations, the judges manually repaired
each unacceptable realization during the rating task.
In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we
found that several of the metrics correlate moder-
ately well with human judgments of both adequacy
and fluency, with the TER family performing best.
However, when looking at statistically significant
system-level differences in human judgments, we
found that some of the metrics get some of the rank-
ings correct, but none get them all correct, with dif-
ferent metrics making different ranking errors. This
suggests that multiple metrics should be routinely
consulted when comparing realizer systems.

Overall, our methodology is similar to that of
previous MT meta-evaluations, in that we collected
human judgments of system outputs, and com-
pared these scores with those assigned by auto-
matic metrics. A recent alternative approach to para-
phrase evaluation is ParaMetric (Callison-Burch et
al., 2008); however, it requires a corpus of annotated
(aligned) paraphrases (which does not yet exist for
PTB data), and is arguably focused more on para-
phrase analysis than paraphrase generation.

The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 dis-
cusses the preparation of the corpus of surface real-
izations. Section 3 describes the human evaluation
task and the automated metrics applied. Sections 4
and 5 present and discuss the results of these evalua-
tions. We conclude with some general observations
about automatic evaluation of surface realizers, and
some directions for further research.

2 Data Preparation

We collected realizations of the sentences in Sec-
tion 00 of the WSJ corpus from the following three
sources:

1. OpenCCG, a CCG-based chart realizer (White,
2006)

2. The XLE Generator, a LFG-based system de-
veloped by Xerox PARC (Crouch et al., 2008)

3. WordNet synonym substitutions, to investigate
how differences in lexical choice compare to
grammar-based variation.1

Although all three systems used Section 00 of
the PTB, they were applied with various parame-
ters (e.g., language models, multiple-output versus
single-output) and on different input structures. Ac-
cordingly, our study does not compare OpenCCG to
XLE, or either of these to the WordNet system.

2.1 OpenCCG realizations

OpenCCG is an open source parsing/realization
library with multimodal extensions to CCG
(Baldridge, 2002). The OpenCCG chart realizer
takes logical forms as input and produces strings
by combining signs for lexical items. Alternative
realizations are scored using integrated n-gram
and perceptron models. For robustness, fragments
are greedily assembled when necessary. Realiza-
tions were generated from 1,895 gold standard
logical forms, created by constrained parsing of
development-section derivations. The following
OpenCCG models (which differ essentially in the
way the output is ranked) were used:

1. Baseline 1: Output ranked by a trigram word
model

2. Baseline 2: Output ranked using three language
models (3-gram words + 3-gram words with
named entity class replacement + factored lan-
guage model of words, POS tags and CCG su-
pertags)

1Not strictly surface realizations, since they do not involve
an abstract input specification, but for simplicity we refer to
them as realizations throughout.

565



3. Baseline 3: Perceptron with syntax features and
the three LMs mentioned above

4. Perceptron full-model: n-best realizations
ranked using perceptron with syntax features
and the three n-gram models, as well as dis-
criminative n-grams

The perceptron model was trained on sections 02-
21 of the CCGbank, while a grammar extracted from
section 00-21 was used for realization. In addition,
oracle supertags were inserted into the chart during
realization. The purpose of such a non-blind test-
ing strategy was to evaluate the quality of the output
produced by the statistical ranking models in isola-
tion, rather than focusing on grammar coverage, and
avoid the problems associated with lexical smooth-
ing, i.e. lexical categories in the development sec-
tion not being present in the training section.

To enrich the variation in the generated realiza-
tions, dative-alternation was enforced during real-
ization by ensuring alternate lexical categories of the
verb in question, as in the following example:

(1) the executives gave [the chefs] [a stand-
ing ovation]

(2) the executives gave [a standing ovation]
[to the chefs]

2.2 XLE realizations

The corpus of realizations generated by the XLE
system contained 42,527 surface realizations of ap-
proximately 1,421 section 00 sentences (an aver-
age of 30 per sentence), initially unranked. The
LFG f-structures used as input to the XLE genera-
tor were derived from automatic parses, as described
in (Riezler et al., 2002). The realizations were
first tokenized using Penn Treebank conventions,
then ranked using perplexities calculated from the
same trigram word model used with OpenCCG. For
each sentence, the top 4 realizations were selected.
The XLE generator provides an interesting point
of comparison to OpenCCG as it uses a manually-
developed grammar with inputs that are less abstract
but potentially noisier, as they are derived from au-
tomatic parses rather than gold-standard ones.

2.3 WordNet synonymizer

To produce an additional source of variation, the
nouns and verbs of the sentences in section 00 of
the PTB were replaced with all of their WordNet
synonyms. Verb forms were generated using verb
stems, part-of-speech tags, and the morphg tool.2

These substituted outputs were then filtered using
the n-gram data which Google Inc. has made avail-
able.3 Those without any 5-gram matches centered
on the substituted word (or 3-gram matches, in the
case of short sentences) were eliminated.

3 Evaluation

From the data sources described in the previous sec-
tion, a corpus of realizations to be evaluated by the
human judges was constructed by randomly choos-
ing 305 sentences from section 00, then selecting
surface realizations of these sentences using the fol-
lowing algorithm:

1. Add OpenCCG’s best-scored realization.

2. Add other OpenCCG realizations until all four
models are represented, to a maximum of 4.

3. Add up to 4 realizations from either the XLE
system or the WordNet pool, chosen randomly.

The intent was to give reasonable coverage of all
realizer systems discussed in Section 2 without over-
loading the human judges. “System” here means
any instantiation that emits surface realizations, in-
cluding various configurations of OpenCCG (using
different language models or ranking systems), and
these can be multiple-output, such as an n-best list,
or single-output (best-only, worst-only, etc.). Ac-
cordingly, more realizations were selected from the
OpenCCG realizer because 5 different systems were
being represented. Realizations were chosen ran-
domly, rather than according to sentence types or
other criteria, in order to produce a representative
sample of the corpus. In total, 2,114 realizations
were selected for evaluation.

3.1 Human judgments

Two human judges evaluated each surface realiza-
tion on two criteria: adequacy, which represents the
extent to which the output conveys all and only the
meaning of the reference sentence; and fluency, the
extent to which it is grammatically acceptable. The
realizations were presented to the judges in sets con-
taining a reference sentence and the 1-8 outputs se-
lected for that sentence. To aid in the evaluation of
adequacy, one sentence each of leading and trailing
context were displayed. Judges used the guidelines
given in Figure 1, based on the scales developed
by the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Work-
shop.

In addition to rating each realization on the two
five-point scales, each judge also repaired each out-
put which he or she did not judge to be fully ade-
quate and fluent. An example is shown in Figure 2.
These repairs resulted in new reference sentences for
a substantial number of sentences. These repaired
realizations were later used to calculate targeted ver-
sions of the evaluation metrics, i.e., using the re-
paired sentence as the reference sentence. Although
targeted metrics are not fully automatic, they are of
interest because they allow the evaluation algorithm
to focus on what is actually wrong with the input,
rather than all textual differences. Notably, targeted
TER (HTER) has been shown to be more consistent
with human judgments than human annotators are
with one another (Snover et al., 2006).

3.2 Automatic evaluation

The realizations were also evaluated using seven au-
tomatic metrics:

• IBM’s BLEU, which scores a hypothesis by
counting n-gram matches with the reference
sentence (Papineni et al., 2001), with smooth-
ing as described in (Lin and Och, 2004)

• The NIST n-gram evaluation metric, similar to
BLEU, but rewarding rarer n-gram matches, and
using a different length penalty

• METEOR, which measures the harmonic mean
of unigram precision and recall, with a higher
weight for recall (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)

• TER (Translation Edit Rate), a measure of the
number of edits required to transform a hy-
pothesis sentence into the reference sentence
(Snover et al., 2006)

• TERP, an augmented version of TER which
performs phrasal substitutions, stemming, and
checks for synonyms, among other improve-
ments (Snover et al., 2009)

• TERPA, an instantiation of TERP with edit
weights optimized for correlation with ade-
quacy in MT evaluations

• GTM (General Text Matcher), a generaliza-
tion of the F-measure that rewards contiguous
matching spans (Turian et al., 2003)

Additionally, targeted versions of BLEU, ME-
TEOR, TER, and GTM were computed by using the
human-repaired outputs as the reference set. The
human repair was different from the reference sen-
tence in 193 cases (about 9% of the total), and we
expected this to result in better scores and correla-
tions with the human judgments overall.

4 Results

4.1 Human judgments

Table 1 summarizes the dataset, as well as the mean
adequacy and fluency scores garnered from the hu-
man evaluation. Overall adequacy and fluency judg-
ments were high (4.16, 3.63) for the realizer sys-
tems on average, and the best-rated realizer systems
achieved mean fluency scores above 4.

4.2 Inter-annotator agreement

Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the
κ-coefficient, which is commonly used to measure
the extent to which annotators agree in category
judgment tasks. κ is defined as P (A)−P (E)1−P (E) , where
P (A) is the observed agreement between annota-
tors and P (E) is the probability of agreement due
to chance (Carletta, 1996). Chance agreement for
this data is calculated by the method discussed in
Carletta’s squib. However, in previous work in
MT meta-evaluation, Callison-Burch et al. (2007),
assume the less strict criterion of uniform chance
agreement, i.e. 15 for a five-point scale. They also

introduce the notion of “relative” κ, which measures
how often two or more judges agreed that A > B,
A = B, or A < B for two outputs A and B, irre-
spective of the specific values given on the five-point
scale; here, uniform chance agreement is taken to be
1
3 . We report both absolute and relative κ in Table 2,
using actual chance agreement rather than uniform
chance agreement.

The κ scores of 0.60 for adequacy and 0.63 for flu-
ency across the entire dataset represent “substantial”
agreement, according to the guidelines discussed in
(Landis and Koch, 1977), better than is typically
reported for machine translation evaluation tasks;
for example, Callison-Burch et al. (2007) reported
“fair” agreement, with κ = 0.281 for fluency and
κ = 0.307 for adequacy (relative). Assuming the
uniform chance agreement that the previously cited
work adopts, our inter-annotator agreements (both
absolute and relative) are still higher. This is likely
due to the generally high quality of the realizations
evaluated, leading to easier judgments.

4.3 Correlation with automatic evaluation

To determine how well the automatic evaluation
methods described in Section 3 correlate with the
human judgments, we averaged the human judg-
ments for adequacy and fluency, respectively, for
each of the rated realizations, and then computed
both Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spear-
man’s rank correlation coefficient between these
scores and each of the metrics. Spearman’s corre-
lation makes fewer assumptions about the distribu-
tion of the data, but may not reflect a linear rela-

tionship that is actually present. Both are frequently
reported in the literature. Due to space constraints,
we show only Spearman’s correlation, although the
TER family scored slightly better on Pearson’s coef-
ficient, relatively.

The results for Spearman’s correlation are given
in Table 3. Additionally, the average scores for ad-
equacy and fluency were themselves averaged into
a single score, following (Snover et al., 2009), and
the Spearman’s correlation of each of the automatic
metrics with these scores are given in Table 4. All
reported correlations are significant at p < 0.001.

4.4 Bootstrap sampling of correlations

For each of the sub-corpora shown in Table 1, we
computed confidence intervals for the correlations
between adequacy and fluency human scores with
selected automatic metrics (BLEU, HBLEU, TER,
TERP, and HTER) as described in (Koenh, 2004). We
sampled each sub-corpus 1000 times with replace-
ment, and calculated correlations between the rank-
ings induced by the human scores and those induced
by the metrics for each reference sentence. We then
used these coefficients to estimate the confidence in-
terval, after excluding the top 25 and bottom 25 co-
efficients, following (Lin and Och, 2004). The re-
sults of this for the BLEU metric are shown in Table
5. We determined which correlations lay within the
95% confidence interval of the best performing met-
ric in each row of Table Table 3; these figures are
italicized.

5 Discussion

5.1 Human judgments of systems

The results for the four OpenCCG perceptron mod-
els mostly confirm those reported in (White and Ra-
jkumar, 2009), with one exception: the B-3 model
was below B-2, though the P-B (perceptron-best)
model still scored highest. This may have been due
to differences in the testing scenario. None of the
differences in adequacy scores among the individ-
ual systems are significant, with the exception of the
WordNet system. In this case, the lack of word-
sense disambiguation for the substituted words re-
sults in a poor overall adequacy score (e.g., wage
floor → wage story). Conversely, it scores highest
for fluency, as substituting a noun or verb with a syn-
onym does not usually introduce ungrammaticality.

5.2 Correlations of human judgments with MT
metrics

Of the non-human-targeted metrics evaluated, BLEU
and TER/TERP demonstrate the highest correla-
tions with the human judgments of fluency (r =
0.62, 0.64). The TER family of evaluation metrics
have been observed to perform very well in MT-
evaluation tasks, and although the data evaluated
here differs from typical MT data in some impor-
tant ways, the correlation of TERP with the human
judgments is substantial. In contrast with previous
MT evaluations where TERP performs considerably
better than TER, these scored close to equal on our
data, possibly because TERP’s stem, synonym, and
paraphrase matching are less useful when most of
the variation is syntactic.

The correlations with BLEU and METEOR are
lower than those reported in (Callison-Burch et al.,
2007); in that study, BLEU achieved adequacy and
fluency correlations of 0.690 and 0.722, respec-
tively, and METEOR achieved 0.701 and 0.719. The
correlations for these metrics might be expected to
be lower for our data, since overall quality is higher,
making the metrics’ task more difficult as the out-
puts involve subtler differences between acceptable
and unacceptable variation.

The human-targeted metrics (represented by the
prefixed H in the data tables) correlated even more
strongly with the human judgments, compared to the
non-targeted versions. HTER demonstrated the best

correlation with realizer fluency (r = 0.75).
For several kinds of acceptable variation involv-

ing the rearrangement of constituents (such as da-
tive shift), TERP gives a more reasonable score than
BLEU, due to its ability to directly evaluate phrasal
shifts. The following realization was rated 4.5 for
fluency, and was more correctly ranked by TERP
than BLEU:

(3) Ref: The deal also gave Mitsui access to
a high-tech medical product.

(4) Realiz.: The deal also gave access to a
high-tech medical product to Mitsui.

For each reference sentence, we compared the
ranking of its realizations induced from the human
scores to the ranking induced from the TERP score,
and counted the rank errors by the latter, infor-
mally categorizing them by error type (see Table
7). In the 50 sentences with the highest numbers of
rank errors, 17 were affected by punctuation differ-
ences, typically involving variation in comma place-
ment. Human fluency judgments of outputs with
only punctuation problems were generally high, and
many realizations with commas inserted or removed
were rated fully fluent by the annotators. However,
TERP penalizes such insertions or deletions. Agree-
ment errors are another frequent source of rank-
ing errors for TERP. The human judges tended to
harshly penalize sentences with number-agreement
or tense errors, whereas TERP applies only a single
substitution penalty for each such error. We expect
that with suitable optimization of edit weights to
avoid over-penalizing punctuation shifts and under-
penalizing agreement errors, TERP would exhibit an
even stronger correlation with human fluency judg-
ments.

None of the evaluation metrics can distinguish an
acceptable movement of a word or constituent from
an unacceptable movement, with only one reference
sentence. A substantial source of error for both
TERP and BLEU is variation in adverbial placement,
as shown in (7).

Similar errors are seen with prepositional phrases
and some commonly-occurring temporal adverbs,
which typically admit a number of variations in
placement. Another important example of accept-
able variation which these metrics do not generally
rank correctly is dative alternation:

The correlations of each of the metrics with the
human judgments of fluency for the realizer systems
indicate at least a moderate relationship, in contrast
with the results reported in (Stent et al., 2005) for
paraphrase data, which found an inverse correlation
for fluency, and (Cahill, 2009) for the output of a sur-
face realizer for German, which found only a weak
correlation. However, the former study employed
a corpus-based paraphrase generation system rather
than grammar-driven surface realizers, and the re-
sulting paraphrases exhibited much broader varia-
tion. In Cahill’s study, the outputs of the realizer
were almost always grammatically correct, and the
automated evaluation metrics were ranking marked-
ness instead of grammatical acceptability.

5.3 System-level comparisons
In order to investigate the efficacy of the metrics
in ranking different realizer systems, or competing
realizations from the same system generated using
different ranking models, we considered seven dif-
ferent “systems” from the whole dataset of realiza-
tions. These consisted of five OpenCCG-based re-
alizations (the best realization from three baseline
models, and the best and the worst realization from
the full perceptron model), and two XLE-based sys-
tems (the best and the worst realization, after rank-
ing the outputs of the XLE realizer with an n-gram
model). The mean of the combined adequacy and

fluency scores of each of these seven systems was
compared with that of every other system, result-
ing in 21 pairwise comparisons. Then Tukey’s HSD
test was performed to determine the systems which
differed significantly in terms of the average ade-
quacy and fluency rating they received.4 The test
revealed five pairwise comparisons where the scores
were significantly different.

Subsequently, for each of these systems, an over-
all system-level score for each of the MT metrics
was calculated. For the five pairwise comparisons
where the adequacy-fluency group means differed
significantly, we checked whether the metric ranked
the systems correctly. Table 8 shows the results of
a pairwise comparison between the ranking induced
by each evaluation metric, and the ranking induced
by the human judgments. Five of the seven non-
targeted metrics correctly rank more than half of the
systems. NIST, METEOR, and GTM get the most
comparisons right, but neither NIST nor GTM cor-
rectly rank the OpenCCG-baseline model 1 with re-
spect to the XLE-best model. TER and TERP get two
of the five comparisons correct, and they incorrectly
rank two of the five OpenCCG model comparisons,
as well as the comparison between the XLE-worst
and OpenCCG-best systems.

For the targeted metrics, HNIST is correct for all
five comparisons, while neither HBLEU nor HME-
TEOR correctly rank all the OpenCCG models. On
the other hand, HTER and HGTM incorrectly rank the
XLE-best system versus OpenCCG-based models.

In summary, some of the metrics get some of the
rankings correct, but none of the non-targeted met-
rics get all of them correct. Moreover, different met-
rics make different ranking errors. This argues for

the use of multiple metrics in comparing realizer
systems.

6 Conclusion

Our study suggests that although the task of evalu-
ating the output from realizer systems differs from
the task of evaluating machine translations, the au-
tomatic metrics used to evaluate MT outputs deliver
moderate correlations with combined human fluency
and adequacy scores when used on surface realiza-
tions. We also found that the MT-evaluation met-
rics are useful in evaluating different versions of the
same realizer system (e.g., the various OpenCCG re-
alization ranking models), and finding cases where
a system is performing poorly. As in MT-evaluation
tasks, human-targeted metrics have the highest cor-
relations with human judgments overall. These re-
sults suggest that the MT-evaluation metrics are use-
ful for developing surface realizers. However, the
correlations are lower than those reported for MT
data, suggesting that they should be used with cau-
tion, especially for cross-system evaluation, where
consulting multiple metrics may yield more reliable
comparisons. In our study, the targeted version of
TERP correlated most strongly with human judg-
ments of fluency.

In future work, the performance of the TER family
of metrics on this data might be improved by opti-
mizing the edit weights used in computing its scores,
so as to avoid over-penalizing punctuation move-
ments or under-penalizing agreement errors, both
of which were significant sources of ranking errors.
Multiple reference sentences may also help mitigate
these problems, and the corpus of human-repaired
realizations that has resulted from our study is a step
in this direction, as it provides multiple references
for some cases. We expect the corpus to also prove
useful for feature engineering and error analysis in
developing better realization models.5
