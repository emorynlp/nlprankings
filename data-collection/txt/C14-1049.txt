Abstract 

The work presented here addresses the use of unmarked contexts in pattern-based nominal lexical semantic 

classification. We define unmarked contexts to be the counterposition of the class-indicatory, or marked, 

contexts. Its aim is to evaluate how unmarked contexts can be used to improve the accuracy and reliability 

of lexical semantic classifiers. Results demonstrate that the combined use of both types of distributional in-

formation (marked and unmarked) is crucial to improve classification. This result was replicated using two 

different corpora, demonstrating the robustness of the method proposed. 

1 Introduction 

Lexical resources annotated with lexical semantic classes have been successfully incorporated into a 

wide range of NLP applications, such as grammar induction (Agirre et al., 2011) and the building and 

extending of semantic ontologies (Abbès et al., 2011). However, lexical semantic tagging in large 

lexica is mostly done by hand, implying high costs with regard to maintenance and domain tuning. As 

the use of an inadequate lexicon is one of the causes of poor performance of NLP applications, current 

research to improve the automatic production of rich language resources, and of class-annotated 

lexica, in particular, is critical.
 
  

One way to approach this task is through supervised cue-based lexical semantic classification. 

Based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), according to which words occurring in the same 

contexts can be said to belong to the same class, cue-based lexical semantic classification uses particu-

lar linguistic contexts where nouns occur as cues that represent distinctive distributional traits of a 

lexical class. Yet, training a classifier with information about word occurrences in a corpus within a 

selected number of contexts can present a challenge, mainly because specific words might be observed 

in a number of class-indicative contexts but not always are.  

This type of marked, or class-indicative, context (e.g. co-occurrence with specific prepositions, 

predicate selectional restrictions, and grammatical information, such as indirect objects) are sparse in 

any corpus as, being so specific, they do not occur often with each target noun. Using only exclusive 

class-indicative contexts as features in nominal lexical semantic classification has been shown to not 

always provide sufficient information to make a decision regarding class membership of a noun (Bel 

et al., 2012), especially when the data does not contain relevant co-occurrences or when those co-

occurrences are too disperse to be correlated.  

Recent work on the use of distributional models for nominal classification tasks (Romeo et al., 

2014) discusses potential bottlenecks of models using data extracted with lexico-syntactic patterns as 

features, identifying data sparsity as one of the major issues affecting the performance of these sys-

tems. In fact, the selection of class-indicative information, in an attempt to provide relevant informa-

tion to classifiers and thus reduce noise, naturally limits the amount of data available to the system, 

often resulting in sparse vectors.  

Resulting from the necessity of selecting the information provided to classifiers, in an attempt to 

improve the accuracy of classification decisions, the sparse data problem in nominal lexical semantic 

classification is one of the crucial issues to be addressed to improve the performance of these systems. 

We propose to approach this issue by utilizing a larger fraction of the distributional information avail-

able in a corpus, by incorporating information typically considered non-indicatory of semantic class 

membership, which we will designate as unmarked contexts (see Section 3 for a definition).

Our hypothesis is that the distributional behavior of nouns of a particular class in this type of gen-

erally occurring contexts can show certain characteristics in common that may be explored in the con-

text of lexical semantic classification. Our goal in the work presented here is to evaluate to which ex-

tent this information, in combination with the widely explored class-indicative lexico-syntactic con-

texts, can be used to improve results in classification tasks, by providing more information to classifi-

ers. To do this, we experiment with English nouns of the following lexical semantic classes: INFOR-

MATION (INF), ORGANIZATION (ORG), LOCATION (LOC), EVENT (EVT) and HUMAN (HUM).  

The work presented in this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes theoretical claims 

used in approaches to nominal lexical semantic classification, as well as related work; Section 3 elabo-

rates upon the concept of unmarked contexts; Section 4 describes the methodology followed; Section 5 

presents the results obtained; Section 6 discusses their implications; and Section 7 concludes with final 

remarks and future work. 

2 Motivation and Related Work 

In semantic classification approaches grounded in usage-based theories of grammar (Goldberg, 2006), 

a lexical class is seen as a generalization of the systematic co-distribution of a number of words and 

contexts. Construction-based grammar hypotheses allow us to predict there are sets of word occur-

rences that, together, constitute a class mark, indicating a particular semantic class, in line with the 

structuralist notion of markedness (Jakobson, 1971). 

The identification of relevant cues for machine learning classification is problematic as low fre-

quency evidence is typically disregarded by automatic systems. To overcome this problem, Bel (2010) 

applied smoothing methods, demonstrating increases in accuracy, though low frequency words re-

mained problematic for classifiers when evidence was scarce, and thus not considered as a positive cue 

for the class, although it was indicative.  

In Bel et al. (2012) we built on this hypothesis, assuming only frequently occurring contexts would 

be efficient for classification tasks, and considering only frequent predicates, prepositions, affixes, 

etc., as well as negative cases (i.e. marked cues for other classes), as indicators for a class membership 

decision. Thus, we ignored all information that, although frequent, co-occurred with nouns from all 

classes and was deemed not distinctive of a particular class, as well as all information that, though dis-

tinctive, was not frequent enough to be used by the classifier.  

Table 1 provides examples of contexts considered in that work, which did not rely on unique, ex-

clusive hints, but a number of them that, when correlated, could identify members of a given class. 

However, our results were inconclusive, a fact which we attributed to the high impact of sparse data. 

Class Examples of lexico-syntactic patterns 

ORG x-NN (found|establish|organize)-VBD 

LOC (inside|outside)-IN (the|a|an)-(DT|Z) x-NN 

INF (submit|publish|report)-V* (the|a|an)-(DT|Z) x-NN 

EVT during-IN (the|a|an)-(DT|Z) x-NN 

HUM x-(-er|–or| –man)-NN 

Table 1: Examples of lexico-syntactic patterns indicative of 5 different lexico-semantic classes, which 

we refer to as marked contexts. 

According to Bybee (2010), general contexts, not exclusive to a particular class (i.e. unmarked con-

texts, as defined in Section 3), are more frequent than contexts marked toward a particular class, as 

they occur with nouns of all classes. In view of this, it becomes apparent that a large part of available 

distributional data is not taken into consideration when these very general co-occurrences observed 

with nouns of all classes (e.g. co-occurrence with an article) are treated as stop words or contexts in 

lexical semantic classification tasks. 

 The basic claim leading most authors to neglect this kind of context is that, due to its assumed un-

differentiated distribution, this information presents a challenge for classifiers to accurately use it in 

class membership decisions, which is bound to negatively affect results (see Cooke and Gillam (2008), 

Turney and Pantel (2010), Bullinaria and Levy (2012), among many others). In contrast with this 

mainstream position, Rumshisky et al. (2007) argued there is an asymmetry in the way certain word 

509



senses are used in language, preferably or rarely occurring in certain very general contexts (e.g. sub-

ject position, occurrence with an adjectival modifier, etc.).  

This type of asymmetry is essentially referring to a difference in how general, semantically neutral 

distributional contexts are more or less frequent in data, depending on the sense in which a word is 

used. We hypothesize that these tendencies can also be observed when considering different lexical 

semantic classes.  

In this paper, we propose a way to include this type of asymmetry in the information provided to 

classifiers to verify its impact on their overall performance. Considering such distributional evidence 

will increase the amount of information made available to classifiers. Our main claim is that devising a 

strategy to informatively include this type of distributional information in classification tasks can al-

low us to take advantage of a bigger portion of the data available in corpora and improve the accuracy 

of classifiers in this way. 

3 Unmarked contexts 

In contrast with mainstream approaches to cue-based lexical-semantic classification, we argue for the 

inclusion of a type of distributional information typically not considered to be indicatory of class 

membership, and thus not informative to automatic classification systems. These are very general con-

texts of occurrence typically disregarded as semantically-empty and thought to be too general to con-

tribute any relevant information. At the same time, they correspond to a large amount of corpus data 

that is a priori not considered due to the assumption that it does not provide any information.  

Examples of such distributional information regard whether nouns occur preceeded by an article, in 

singular or plural form, whether they are a head or a complement in NPs containing the preposition of, 

if they occur as the subject of the verb to be, etc. We will henceforth designate these contexts as un-

marked contexts, the counterposition of the class-indicatory contexts, i.e. marked contexts, used as 

class marks in cue-based lexical-semantic classification systems. 

Following the conclusions of Rumshisky et al. (2007) regarding asymmetries in the distribution of 

word senses in general contexts, our hypothesis is that the distribution of members of a class with re-

spect to their occurrence in particular unmarked contexts is consistent and thus can be captured and 

used to inform classifiers and improve results, when considered along with other indicatory, or 

marked, contexts.  

We also hypothesize that unmarked contexts will alleviate problems caused by data sparsity in 

classification tasks by providing additional information to classifiers. To assess to which extent this 

information can be used in classification tasks, we had to identify such contexts and verify whether 

our hypothesis was confirmed, i.e. if they showed significant variations in terms of distribution that 

might be explored to augment the amount of information made available to classifiers
1
. Additionally, 

and given the specific properties of this type of distributional information, we also had to define a 

strategy to informatively provide it to classifiers (see Section 3.2 for details). 

3.1 Identifying unmarked contexts 

Considering the characteristics of the contexts discussed above, we identified 32 unmarked con-

texts under a frequency criterion (see Table 2 for a description of the different contexts identified), 

hypothesizing that more frequent contexts combine with more nouns in the corpus and thus should not 

be marked for any restricted set. However, although they are not considered to be class marks, we ex-

pect these contexts to be asymmetrically distributed between lexical semantic classes, in an analogous 

way to what was observed by Rumshisky et al. (2007) with regard to the distributional behavior of 

different word senses in language use.  

We studied the distribution of these contexts in a web-crawled corpus (see Section 4), comparing 

the distribution of each context over all the nouns in the corpus and over nouns defined as part of a 

specific lexical semantic class, according to a gold standard (see Section 4.2). To do this, we calcu-

lated the mean of occurrence of nouns pertaining to a particular class in a specific unmarked context, 

                                                 
1 The approach detailed in this paper contrasts with a „bag of words‟ approach to classification as, even in the case of what we call un-

marked contexts, we rely on cue information to populate our vectors. Thus, the information provided to classifiers takes into considera-

tion linguistic information, such as syntactic order or dependencies. Moreover, our use of linguistically-motivated features, from the 

inherently distinctive to the more generic, reduces the amount of data needed to obtain a desired level of performance.

as well as the mean of occurrence of all the nouns in the corpus in that same context; we then deter-

mined if there was a statistically significant difference

 between the behavior of nouns from specific 

classes and the behavior of nouns in general with regard to the contexts identified as unmarked.

Table 2: Description of unmarked contexts identified and used in our experiments. 

The results showed there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in the behavior of nouns 

in particular classes with regard to certain unmarked contexts. For instance, the occurrence of INF, 

ORG, LOC, and HUM nouns with a definite article (the-DT) showed to be significantly different from its 

average occurrence with all the nouns in the corpus. The occurrence with an indefinite article (a|an-

DT), on the other hand, showed to be significantly different for LOC nouns, while the co-occurrence 

with an adjective (x-JJ) was significantly different for INF nouns.  

3.2 A strategy to encode unmarked context information in feature vectors 

The preliminary study mentioned in Section 3.1 provided evidence confirming that there are, in fact, 

differences in the behavior of particular lexical semantic classes with regard to their occurrence in 

unmarked contexts. Thus, the next step consisted in determining the best way to make this information 

available to classifiers. 

Aiming to check the validity of our hypothesis in general, the results obtained in the aforemen-

tioned study were not used directly to narrow down the information to include in the vectors used by 

the classifiers to avoid the risk of over-fitting. Moreover, what was at stake, considering our theoreti-

cal hypothesis, was to devise a strategy to account for specific differences between the behavior of 

each noun considered for classification and the average behavior of all nouns in the corpus with regard 

to each context considered. Thus, information regarding all 32 unmarked contexts was provided to the 

classifiers for all lexical classes considered.  

To mirror the specificity of the distribution of each noun with regard to each context considered, 

we subtracted the mean of occurrence of nouns in each context from the actual occurrences of the tar-

get noun represented by the vector in that same context to obtain each feature f, as defined in Equation 

1, where ci represents a given context, t a target noun, n any noun belonging to N, the set of all nouns 

in the corpus, and freq frequency of occurrence (e.g. )|( ictfreq = frequency of occurrence of the target 

noun t in context ci). 

  

 

Using the difference between the number of occurrences of a given noun and the average occur-

rence of all nouns in a specific context, we encode the deviation of the behavior of that noun with re-

                                                 
2 In this work, statistical significance was calculated using Student‟s t-test (cf. Krenn and Samuelsson, 1997).

gard to the general behavior of all nouns in the corpus, under the hypothesis that nouns of the same 

class display similar tendencies in terms of deviant behavior in the contexts considered, providing re-

levant information to the classifier. We apply our method to two different corpora making apparent its 

robustness. 

4 Experimental design and setup 

In order to evaluate the impact of using distributional information on unmarked contexts for lexical-

semantic classification tasks, first, we had to extract distributional information regarding the unmarked 

contexts identified (see Section 3.1), as well as distributional information regarding class-indicative 

marked contexts. In our experiments, we used the marked contexts identified and described in Bel et 

al. (2012) (see Table 1 for examples).  

Once the distributional information was extracted, we incorporated it in feature vectors, using the 

different aforementioned strategies for encoding distributional information regarding marked and un-

marked contexts, respectively, as detailed further below in this section. Once all of the information 

was compiled, the vectors were provided to classifiers. 

As previously mentioned, our experiments covered English nouns of the classes: INF, ORG, HUM, 

EVT and LOC (see Section 4.2). For the purpose of the work presented here, we experimented with two 

corpora to determine the transferability and robustness of our method, independently of specific cor-

pus data.  

We first used a general web-crawled corpus (Pecina et al., 2011) consisting of 30 million PoS-

tagged English tokens (henceforth Corpus A) to identify unmarked contexts (see Section 3.1) as well 

as to train our classifiers.  

We also employed an excerpt of the web-crawled UkWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009), consisting 

of 60 million PoS-tagged English tokens (henceforth Corpus B) to test our approach on unknown data, 

in this way ensuring that our approach and classifiers are not over-fitted to any specific corpus, instead 

confirming that the method we propose can be generalized, and the results obtained are replicable 

given any dataset. 

Regular expressions over both corpora were used to identify occurrences of nouns in marked and 

unmarked contexts. For marked contexts, the relative frequency of each pattern seen with a particular 

noun was stored in an n-dimensional vector.
3
 The occurrences of a noun in unmarked contexts were 

encoded in the same vectors following the strategy outlined in Section 3.2 (see Equation 1). 

4.1 Classification 

For classification, we used the Logistic Model Trees (LMT) (Landwehr et al., 2005) Decision Tree 

(DT) classifier in the WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005) implementation in a 10-fold cross-validation 

setting. We conducted binary classifications, one for each semantic class considered. We measure the 

success of our approach in regards to the joint performance of individual classifiers in accurately dis-

tinguishing members of each individual class from any other noun. This method was used in the clas-

sification experiments over both corpora described above. 

4.2 Gold Standard Description 

In regards to the gold standard lists used for training and evaluation, we automatically extracted from 

WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) all of the nouns encoded in this repository of lexical information that 

contained a sense corresponding to a class considered in our experiments (e.g. people in the case of 

HUM).  

The gold standards were not contrasted with the actual occurrences of the nouns in the corpora. 

They were, however, balanced with respect to class members and elements not belonging to the class, 

resulting in the dataset described in Table 3. Each noun appears x times in any corpus considered. The 

elements not belonging to a class were randomly selected from the set of nouns that do not contain a 

sense in WordNet that corresponded to the target class being classified.  

For a fair comparison, the baseline classification model was obtained using the context patterns de-

scribed in Bel et al. (2012) with the LMT classifier, using the previously described gold standard lists 

over Corpus A. This baseline allows us to assess the impact of unmarked contexts in nominal lexical 

                                                 
3 In this work, n is equal to the amount of marked contexts plus unmarked contexts considered for each class.

semantic classification, since the classifiers proposed here that are provided with information on the 

distributional behavior of nouns in unmarked contexts also use Bel et al. (2012)‟s context patterns to 

extract class-indicative, or marked,  distributional information regarding the nouns to classify.

5 Results 

Tables 4 and 5 show results obtained in our experiments in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-

Measure (F). The overall accuracy of all classifiers for each experiment is also provided. The baseline 

classifiers achieve an average accuracy of 70.84%. By including unmarked contexts in the vectors 

provided to the classifiers, the average accuracy of the classifiers rises to 75.16%, representing an er-

ror reduction of 4.32 points. We tested the statistical significance ( p<0.1) of this increase in the accu-

racy of classification and, for all classes except for HUM, the increase in accuracy between the baseline 

results and those obtained when including unmarked contexts is significant. These results are dis-

cussed in detail in Section 6. 

Knowing a potential downside of using unmarked contexts in classification tasks is an increase in 

noise (see Section 6.1 for a detailed discussion regarding this concept), we conducted an error analysis 

of the results obtained, which made apparent that most of the noise was due to imprecise information 

extracted with our regular expressions, leading us to revise them. As these revisions resulted from the 

observation that a portion of the errors in the baseline results was due to imprecise regular expressions, 

they did not consist in the definition of new marked contexts, rather in a revision of how to extract 

marked contexts already considered in this work from corpora data. Thus, these revisions resulted in 

more accurate and better defined regular expressions.  

As indicated by the results, these revisions in combination with the unmarked contexts further 

raised the average accuracy of the classifiers to 76.35% (see Table 4), representing an error reduction 

of 5.51 points with regard to the baseline. Having obtained these promising results over the data in the 

corpus used to develop our approach (Corpus A), it was crucial to verify the replicability of our 

method using a different and completely independent corpus, as described in Section 4. Moreover, 

replicating the original experiments over a different corpus was also crucial to assure that the revisions 

made to the regular expressions did not result in any over-fitting between the extraction of distribu-

tional information and the corpus being used. The results obtained for the experiments conducted over 

Corpus B are presented in Table 5.

The classifiers that include unmarked contexts yielded an average accuracy of 76.03% over Corpus 

B, representing an error reduction of 3.34 points with regard to the classifier including only marked 

contexts (using the revised version of Bel et al. (2012)‟s cues), which is a statistically significant im-

provement (p<0.05). Moreover, these results represent an improvement of accuracy by 5.19 points 

with regard to the baseline. This demonstrates, on the one hand, that the definition of relevant contexts 

based on Corpus A data did not result in an over-fitted approach; and, on the other hand, that the 

513



method presented here is robust, as we used our classifiers over a completely different corpus (cf. Sec-

tion 3) and still yielded comparable results. Due to space limitations, below we detail only the results 

obtained on Corpus B data, as these are independent of all the preliminary studies conducted and thus 

demonstrate the potential applicability of our approach to any corpus.

Table 6: Precision (P) and Recall (R) of classification of members and non-members of different lexi-

cal classes over Corpus B 

Table 6 presents the precision and the recall of each individual classifier over Corpus B both with 

regard to the members of a given class, and those nouns that are not members of that class. This table 

allows us to identify more precisely how the unmarked contexts contribute to the error reduction in 

classification.  

According to the results, unmarked contexts allow us to gain an average of 10.2 points in recall for 

class members, demonstrating that they provide useful information to classifiers, which allows them to 

cover cases which they were not able to before, most likely due to phenomena such as data sparsity. 

However, the impact on precision varies between classes, as the inclusion of very frequent information 

in the vectors representing target nouns may provide additional noise to the classifier (see Section 6.1). 

The precision of classification of class members decreases slightly with the inclusion of unmarked 

contexts, although the differences are not statistically significant (p<0.1). However, the precision of 

the classification of nouns not belonging to the classes considered significantly increases (p<0.1) with 

the inclusion of unmarked contexts in all cases except for HUM. This shows that although unmarked 

contexts do not contribute to a better definition of the characteristics of individual classes (see Table 

6), they allow for a cleaner discrimination of members and non-members of a class, contributing to a 

better partition of the classification space.

Table 7 presents the percentage of False Positives (FP), i.e. nouns incorrectly marked as members 

of the class, and False Negatives (FN), i.e. nouns incorrectly marked as not belonging to a class, in the 

results of each classifier both with and without the inclusion of unmarked contexts. Again, for each of 

the classes, except HUM, the inclusion of unmarked contexts decreases the percentage of FN, mirroring 

a reduction in silence. Yet, there was an increase of FP across all classes, signifying an increase of the 

noise provided to the classifier. These results are discussed in detail in Section 6. 

6 Discussion 

In Section 5, we presented the results obtained in our experiments using distributional information re-

garding both marked and unmarked contexts for the classification of English nouns. Overall, our re-

sults show that unmarked contexts either improve accuracy or do not affect classification results. Spe-

cifically, the improvements in accuracy are particularly significant for those classes for which there 

were difficulties to find enough occurrences in marked contexts in previous experiments, i.e. those 

classes with a higher level of FN when classified without using unmarked contexts. This way, the re-

sults confirm our general hypothesis that the distribution of words in unmarked contexts, when consid-

ered along with contexts marked towards a lexical semantic class, provides information to improve 

classifiers, particularly when not enough class-specific information is available. In this section we ana-

lyze the results obtained, making apparent the main advantages of our proposal.  

6.1 A trade-off between silence and noise 

An important result of our experiments is the overall reduction in the negative effect of silence in our 

classifiers, which decreased by an average of 5.21% (see the difference in terms of FN in Table 7), re-

sulting in an increase in accuracy (see Table 5): as more information is supplied to the classifier, the 

additional information permits more accurate membership decisions. To illustrate this, we consider 

examples from the INF, ORG and EVT classes, for which there was not enough information for classifi-

cation when unmarked contexts were not considered. The inclusion of unmarked contexts provided 

information resulting in correct classifications.  

The INF noun theorem illustrates this case: theorem occurs 118 times in the corpus, though only 8 

times in marked contexts, which was not enough to accurately classify it as a member of the INF class. 

As this noun occurs in class-marked contexts, but not enough times for the classifier to make an accu-

rate prediction regarding its class membership, we can consider that the lack of enough information 

provided to the classifier is responsible for its misclassification. However, after the inclusion of infor-

mation regarding the behavior of this noun in unmarked contexts, the classifier was able to accurately 

decide for its inclusion as a member of the INF class. This was also observed in the case of the ORG 

noun secretariat and the EVT noun impulse, which occur 190 and 154 times, respectively, in the cor-

pus, yet only 8 and 12 times in marked contexts, which was not enough for an accurate classification. 

Again, the inclusion of information regarding the distribution of these nouns in unmarked contexts 

provided the classifier with sufficient information to allow for correct classification. 

One of the main concerns regarding the use of unmarked distributional information was the intro-

duction of extra noise as a side effect and the way this affects classification results. For the purpose of 

the work presented in this paper, we define noise as contradictory distributional information, particu-

larly the occurrence of nouns that are not members of a particular class in prototypical contexts of that 

particular class, which provides misleading information to classifiers. The impact of this misleading 

information is made apparent by the amount of FP observed in classification results. In contrast, si-

lence has to do with the well known problem of data sparsity, which can be caused by the particular 

distribution of lexical, and thus strict, though informative, contexts used in cue-based classification 

tasks, which are often rare in any corpus of any size due to their specificity.  

In our experiment, we did identify some cases of nouns correctly ruled out as members of a class 

when using only marked cues, which were incorrectly classified as class members after the inclusion 

of unmarked contexts. The slight increase of FP in our results (see Table 7) shows our method does 

introduce some extra noise into the classifier, although, in the overall results, this is compensated by 

the larger amount of nouns that were correctly classified after the inclusion of unmarked distributional 

information (see Tables 4 and 5).  

Analyzing the additional FP observed, we identify two different cases: (i) nouns correctly classified 

using only marked contexts as not belonging to a class based on a borderline probability, which were 

515



incorrectly classified as members of that class when unmarked contexts were also considered, again 

based on a borderline probability; and (ii) nouns correctly classified as not belonging to a class as they 

hardly or never occurred in class-marked contexts, but whose behavior in unmarked contexts was simi-

lar to that of members of the class being classified, thus providing contradictory information to the 

classifier and resulting in incorrect classification.  

The first case is illustrated by a noun like biography, which was predicted not to be a member of 

the LOC class with a borderline probability score (0.47). The inclusion of unmarked contexts provided 

information to the classifier, which slightly changed this probability (0.56), and resulted in an incorrect 

classification. The noun megalopolis illustrates the other case. Occurring only 3 times in class-marked 

contexts of the INF class, this LOC noun had been correctly classified as not belonging to the INF class. 

Yet, its behavior in unmarked contexts showed more similarities with members of the INF class than 

with non-members, resulting in its incorrect classification. Illustrating two paradigmatic cases of noise 

in the results of the classifiers, these examples make apparent how unmarked contexts are sometimes 

responsible for incorrect class membership decisions, and how further improving their use in classifi-

cation tasks, particularly in the case of “borderline” classification decisions, remains a promising line 

of research to explore in the future (see Section 7). 

6.2 More robust classification decisions 

Besides the reduction of the impact of silence in the results of the classifiers, with the consequent im-

provements in accuracy, as discussed in the previous section, we also noticed that the introduction of 

unmarked contexts provided additional information regarding the distribution of nouns that were clas-

sified by chance (i.e. correctly classified nouns, with a borderline probability score), resulting in more 

robust classification decisions. We saw this with the EVT noun consolidation and the LOC noun coal-

field. Each of these nouns was correctly classified using only marked contexts, yet with borderline 

probability scores: 0.52 and 0.53, respectively. Upon providing information on unmarked contexts to 

the classifier, these nouns continued to be correctly classified but with much higher probability scores, 

and thus more reliable: 0.75 and 0.76, respectively.  

These examples are considerably different from those discussed in Section 6.1, as these are far from 

being cases of silence. In fact, the EVT noun consolidation occurs 312 times in the corpus and 317 

times in marked contexts while the LOC noun coalfield occurs 52 times in the corpus and 53 times in 

marked contexts
4
. In both cases, almost all of the occurrences in marked contexts were found to be in 

only one cue, which was therefore not strongly valued by the classifier, as few correlations between 

the evidence available could be made, hence the low probability scores observed. The inclusion of un-

marked distributional information provides “bridging information”, allowing for more reliable classifi-

cations, which is crucial to consider especially when the ultimate goal of improving and tuning classi-

fication systems is to employ classification results for the automatic production of language resources 

(see Section 1). 

6.3 Classification results unevenly affected by unmarked contexts 

As made apparent by the results, the contribution of unmarked contexts to the classification of differ-

ent semantic classes is not always the same. For example, we observed that classes whose members 

demonstrated a more heterogeneous linguistic behavior, such as the ORG, LOC or EVT classes, improve 

more with the inclusion of unmarked distributional information than classes with a more homogeneous 

distributional behavior. To make our statement clearer, we claim that some nominal classes are com-

posed of nouns that tend to occur in a wider range of contexts, thus displaying a more heterogeneous 

and disperse distributional behavior. This heterogeneity is made apparent by an analysis of the overall 

distribution of the marked cues between the members of each lexical semantic class. In contrast with 

heterogeneous noun classes, other classes are composed of members that display a more homogeneous 

collective behavior that is more easily captured by distributional approaches

.  

                                                 
4 Note that a single occurrence in corpus data can activate more than one cue considered in our experiments (for instance, in 

the case of a target noun that has a marked suffix and simultaneously occurs in a marked syntactic construction), hence the 

higher amount of occurrences in cues than overall occurrences in the corpus discussed in the examples introduced in this 

paragraph. 
5 Our analysis of the data showed that the dispersion of distributional behavior is independent of frequency. 

516



Analyzing the distribution of cues between class members in Corpus B, we identified, in each class, 

a set of cues that occurred with the majority of nouns of the class, and which we will consider to repre-

sent the core linguistic behavior of each specific class. We also observed the amount of cues included 

in this set differed considerably from class to class (see Figure 1). Thus, the larger the amount of 

marked contexts shared by the majority of the members of a class, the more homogeneous we can 

claim their behavior to be. 

In the specific case of the classes considered in this paper, 30.7% of the cues for the HUM class are 

shared by the majority of HUM nouns, while 26.6%, 13.3%, 9.5% and 9.1% of the cues for the INF, 

ORG, EVT and LOC classes, respectively, are shared by the majority of the nouns of these classes, as rep-

resented in Figure 1. An effect of a class collectively having a more heterogeneous linguistic behavior is 

that the evidence regarding each of its marks will typically be more disperse and, as a result, often not 

strong enough to be considered by classifiers, which explains the improvement introduced by un-

marked contexts. In contrast, classes like HUM are composed of nouns that generally occur in a com-

mon set of prototypical contexts of that class. Thus, on the one hand, identifying contexts that mirror 

the prototypical behavior of that class is more straightforward and, on the other, class members almost 

always show enough occurrences in such contexts to be accurately classified. 

 
Figure 1: Percentage of cues shared by the majority of class members, per class 

Additionally, there are also strong marks based on suffixes and degree of grammaticalization for the HUM 

class (as demonstrated in Bel et al. (2012)), which can be more readily captured by these more available 

marked contexts. For instance, on the one hand, suffixes, such as: “-er” and “-or” are indicative of many 

HUM type nouns (e.g. “doctor”, “painter”, “officer”, etc.) while the preposition “during”, when preceding a 

nominal phrase, is very indicative of occurrences of EVT nouns. These examples are both instances of features 

that can be easily identified for inclusion in a feature vector, readily providing a large amount of class-

indicative information. On the other hand, there are other types of features that although indicative, result in a 

much sparser vector because of their reliance of occurrence within corpus data. For instance the occurrence as 

the subject of an agentive verb, which is considered an indicative feature for the ORG class, does not necessar-

ily occur readily with all members of the class, thus making marked contexts that provide a homogeneous rep-

resentation of the class more difficult to capture. 

In this way, the inclusion of extra contexts (e.g. unmarked contexts) are rendered ineffective when 

class membership decisions are already accurately made to a great extent (in our case 86.19% of the 

times) based on the information provided by marked contexts. This is consistent with the stability of 

the results reported for the HUM class in the different experiments performed, which did not demon-

strate any significant changes with the inclusion of unmarked contexts. 

7 Conclusions and Final Remarks 

Our main goal in this paper was to evaluate how unmarked contexts can be used to improve the accu-

racy of nominal lexical semantic classification tasks. Departing from the hypothesis that these contexts 

can provide additional information to classifiers when there is not enough distinctive co-occurrence 

information available, the results reported demonstrate the use of unmarked contexts, which are typi-

cally discarded as non-discriminatory, can significantly improve the results of lexical semantic classi-

fication when considered along with marked contexts. Our results also show that using both types of 

517



distributional information (marked and unmarked) is crucial to reduce the sparse data problem, thus 

improving classification (see increase in classification accuracy in Tables 4 and 5). Moreover, in our 

experiments, we apply this method to two independent corpora obtaining comparable results and thus 

demonstrating the robustness and transferability of our approach to any dataset.  

The higher accuracy and error reduction achieved with the inclusion of unmarked contexts consti-

tute a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art (Bel, 2010; Bel et al., 2012; Romeo 

et al., 2014), contributing particularly to the increase of accuracy and reliability of classifiers for 

classes that exhibit more disperse linguistic behavior. Moreover, the approach depicted here leaves 

room for further improvements and future work, particularly with regard to designing strategies to 

minimize the introduction of borderline false positives in classification.  

One promising line of research to explore is the optimization of the inclusion of unmarked contexts 

in classification decisions. As detailed in the discussion, for the experiments depicted in this paper, we 

did not expect particular marked or unmarked features to be more useful than others, as we relied on 

the correlation of all the distributional information considered for each specific class to be indicative 

of class membership.  

Another aspect to be further explored consists of determining the most effective amount of un-

marked contexts to be provided to automatic systems. Building on the demonstration of the positive 

contribution of unmarked contexts in classification tasks, as indicated by the results obtained in the 

work depicted in this paper (see Section 5), we will start by determining the specific contribution to 

classification of each unmarked feature used. In this way, we would check whether there is a context, 

within our set, that is not contributing to the classification, in order to establish a threshold to syste-

matically identify the information that is not relevant or whether we need to widen/relax our frequency 

criterion to include more unmarked contexts with the goal of elaborating a set of information to be as 

robust as possible, thus resulting in more accurate and more reliable classification decisions. 
Finally, we believe the results obtained make a clear contribution towards the automatic production 

of high-quality language resources, which will benefit any NLP system that requires information on 

lexical semantic classes as an input.
