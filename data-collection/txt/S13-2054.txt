Abstract

This paper describes the details of our system
submitted to the SemEval-2013 shared task on
sentiment analysis in Twitter. Our approach to
predicting the sentiment of Tweets and SMS
is based on supervised machine learning tech-
niques and task-specific feature engineering.
We used a linear classifier trained by stochas-
tic gradient descent with hinge loss and elas-
tic net regularization to make our predictions,
which were ranked first or second in three of
the four experimental conditions of the shared
task. Furthermore, our system makes use of
social media specific text preprocessing and
linguistically motivated features, such as word
stems, word clusters and negation handling.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion min-
ing, is a research field in the area of text min-
ing and natural language processing, which inves-
tigates the automated detection of opinions in lan-
guage. In written text, an opinion is a person’s atti-
tude towards some topic, pronounced by verbal (e.g.
choice of words, rhetorical figures) or non-verbal
means (e.g. emoticons, emphatic spelling). More
formally, Liu (2012) defines an opinion as the quin-
tuple (ei, aij , sijkl, hk, tl) where “ei is the name of
an entity, aij is an aspect of ei, sijkl is the sentiment
on aspect aij of entity ei, hk is the opinion holder,
and tl is the time when the opinion is expressed by
hk. The sentiment sijkl is positive, negative, or neu-
tral, or expressed with different strength/intensity
levels [...]. When an opinion is on the entity itself

as a whole, the special aspect GENERAL is used
to denote it. [...] ei and aij together represent the
opinion target” (Liu, 2012).

With the massively growing importance of social
media in everyday life, being able to automatically
find and classify attitudes in written text allows for
estimating the mood of a large group of people, e.g.
towards a certain event, service, product, matter of
fact or the like. As working with the very short and
informal texts typical for social networks poses chal-
lenges not encountered in more traditional text gen-
res, the International Workshop on Semantic Evalu-
ation (SemEval) 2013 has a shared task on sentiment
analysis in microblogging texts, which is detailed in
Wilson et al. (2013). The task requires sentiment
analysis of Twitter1 and SMS messages and com-
prises two subtasks, one of which deals with deter-
mining the sentiment of a given message fragment
depending on its context (Task A) and one on over-
all message polarity classification (Task B).

We treat both tasks as document-level senti-
ment classification tasks, which we define ac-
cording to Liu (2012) as determining the opinion
( ,GENERAL, s, , ) of a given message, where
s ∈ {positive, negative, neutral} and “the entity e,
opinion holder h, and time of opinion t are assumed
known or irrelevant” (Liu, 2012). For Task A we
only consider the marked fraction of the message to
be given.

This introduction is followed by sections dis-
cussing related work (2), details of our system (3),
experiments (4) and results and conclusion (5).

2 Related Work

Previous approaches to sentiment analysis of mi-
croblogging texts make use of a wide range of fea-
tures, including unigrams, n-grams, part-of-speech
tags and polarity values from (usually hand-crafted)
sentiment lexicons. O’Connor et al. (2010) exam-
ine tweets concerned with the 2009 US presiden-
tial elections, relying solely on the occurrence of
words from a sentiment lexicon. Nielsen (2011) in-
vestigates the impact of including internet slang and
obscene language when building a sentiment lexi-
con. Barbosa and Feng (2010) make use of three
different sentiment detection websites to label Twit-
ter data, while Davidov et al. (2010), Kouloumpis et
al. (2011) and Pak and Paroubek (2010) use Twit-
ter hashtags and emoticons as labels. Speriosu et
al. (2011) propagate information from seed labels
along a linked structure that includes Twitter’s fol-
lower graph, and Saif et al. (2012) specifically ad-
dress the data-sparsity problem by using semantic
smoothing and topic extraction.

3 System Description

In this section we present the details of our senti-
ment analysis system, which was implemented in
the Python programming language and is publicly
available online.2 We used the same preprocessing,
feature extraction and learning algorithm for both
subtasks, only the hyperparameters of the machine
learning algorithm were adjusted to the respective
dataset.

3.1 Preprocessing

Tokenization of the messages was done using a sim-
ple regular expression, which matches either URLs,
alphanumeric character sequences (plus apostrophe)
or non-alphanumeric non-whitespace character se-
quences. This way punctuation sequences like
emoticons are preserved, while still being separated
from words in case of missing whitespace. The same
happens to hashtags, so “#liiike:)” gets separated
into the three tokens #, liiike and :), which can
then be processed separately or as n-grams. While
this strategy performed reasonably well for us, more
sophisticated tokenizers for social media messages

2http://tobias.io/semevaltweet

that handle more special cases like emoticons in-
cluding letters are thinkable.

To address the large variety in spelling typical for
social networks we store three different variants of
each token:

a) The raw token found in the message

b) A normalized version, in which all characters
are converted to lowercase and all digits to 0

c) A collapsed version, in which all adjacent du-
plicate characters are removed from the nor-
malized version, if it is not present in an
English word list. That way “school” stays
“school”, but “liiike” gets converted to “like”.

3.2 Features
We explored a wide variety of linguistic and lexical
features. In our final submission we used the follow-
ing set of features for each message:

• The normalized tokens [boolean]

• The stems of the collapsed tokens, which were
computed using the Porter stemming algo-
rithm (Porter, 1980) implemented in the Python
Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2009).
[boolean]

• The word cluster IDs of raw, normalized and
collapsed tokens. The clusters were obtained
via unsupervised Brown clustering (Brown et
al., 1992) of 56,345,753 Tweets by Owoputi
et al. (2013) and are available on the web.3

[boolean]

• The accumulated (summed) positive and accu-
mulated negative SentiWordNet scores (Bac-
cianella et al., 2010) of all synsets matching the
collapsed token strings. [continuous]

Furthermore, the normalized tokens and stems
were marked with a special negation prefix, if they
occurred after a negation word or word cluster of
negation words. If a punctuation token occurred be-
fore the end of the message the marking was discon-
tinued at that point.

3.3 Machine Learning Methods

For the classification of the messages into the posi-
tive, negative and neutral classes we use three linear
models, which were trained in an one-vs.-all man-
ner. At prediction time we simply choose the label
with the highest score. All training was done us-
ing the open-source machine learning toolkit scikit-
learn,4 which provides a consistent Python API to
fast implementations of various machine learning al-
gorithms (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

The linear models were trained using stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), which is a gradient de-
scent optimization method that minimizes a given
loss function. The term “stochastic” refers to the
fact that the weights of the model are updated for
each training example, which is an approximation of
batch gradient descent, in which all training exam-
ples are considered to make a single step. This way
SGD is very fast to train, which was important to us
to be able to rapidly evaluate different feature com-
binations and hyperparameter settings using cross-
validation.

The loss function we used was hinge loss, which
is a large-margin loss function known for its use in
support vector machines. To avoid overfitting the
training set we employed elastic net regularization,
which is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

A simplified version of the SGD learning proce-
dure implemented in scikit-learn is shown in Algo-
rithm 1, where w is the weight vector of the model,
x(i) the feature vector of sample i, y(i) ∈ {−1,+1}
the ground truth label of sample i, η the learning
rate, α the regularization factor and ρ the elastic
net mixing parameter. Be aware that we did not
pick samples at random or shuffle the data, which
is crucial in case of training data which is sorted
by classes. The initial learning rate is set heuris-
tically and updated following Shalev-Shwartz et al.
(2007).6 The way of applying the L1 penalty (lines
13 to 18) is published as “cumulative L1 penalty” in
Tsuruoka et al. (2009). The final settings for the hy-
perparameters were determined by running a cross-
validated grid search on the combined training and
development sets and can be found in Table 1.

4 Experiments

For our experiments and the final model training
we used the combined training and development set
of the shared task. For Task A we removed mes-
sages labeled “objective” prior to training, while we
merged them into the “neutral” class for Task B.
This left us with 9419 training samples (5855 pos-
itive, 457 neutral, 3107 negative) for Task A and
10368 training samples (3855 positive, 4889 neutral,
1624 negative) for Task B. As the shared task was
evaluated on average F1 of the positive and negative
class, disregarding the neutral class, we also provide
our results in these measures in the following.

learning rate for scikit-learn’s SGDClassifier.

Table 2: Feature ablation study (Task B)

During the process of preparing our submission
we used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate differ-
ent combinations of features, machine learning algo-
rithms and their hyperparameter settings. While we
found the features described in section 3.2 to be use-
ful, we did not find further improvement by using
n-grams and part-of-speech tags, despite using the
Twitter-specific part-of-speech tagger by Owoputi et
al. (2013). Table 2 shows a cross-validated ablation
study on the features, removing one group of fea-
tures at a time to see their contribution to the model.
Using only normalized tokens is referred to as bag-
of-words (bow). One can see that word clusters are
the most important for our model, causing the high-
est overall loss in F1 performance when being re-
moved. Nevertheless, all other features contribute to
the performance of the model as well.

Further improvement can be made by carefully
picking a machine learning algorithm and tuning its
hyperparameters. For this task we found linear mod-
els to perform better than other classification meth-
ods such as naive bayes, decision tree / random for-
est and k-nearest neighbor. Figure 1 shows that
models trained with the method described in sec-
tion 3.3 (marked SGD) clearly outperforms mod-
els trained with the popular perceptron algorithm
(which could be described as stochastic gradient de-
scent with zero-one loss, no regularization and con-
stant learning rate, marked PER) with increasing
training set size. The values were obtained by train-
ing on different portions of the training set of Task
B and testing on the previously unseen Task B Twit-
ter test set (3813 samples). Starting from a cer-
tain amount of available training data, the choice of
the training algorithm becomes even more important
than the choice of features.

5 Results and Conclusion

The results of our submission for the four hidden test
sets of the shared task can be found in Table 3. Given
the relatively small deviation from the results of the
cross-validation on combined training and develop-
ment set and the good ranks obtained in the shared
task system ranking, we conclude that the method
for sentiment analysis in microblogging messages
presented in this paper yields competitive results.

We showed that the performance for this task can
be improved by using linguistically motivated fea-
tures as well as carefully choosing a learning algo-
rithm and its hyperparameter settings.
