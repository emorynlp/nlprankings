Abstract

This paper describes the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems devel-
oped at RWTH Aachen University for the
German→English translation task of the
ACL 2014 Eighth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (WMT 2014).
Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT
systems are applied employing hierarchi-
cal phrase reordering and word class lan-
guage models. For the phrase-based sys-
tem, we run discriminative phrase training.
In addition, we describe our preprocessing
pipeline for German→English.

1 Introduction

For the WMT 2014 shared translation task1

RWTH utilized state-of-the-art phrase-based and
hierarchical translation systems. First, we describe
our preprocessing pipeline for the language pair
German→English in Section 2. Furthermore, we
utilize morpho-syntactic analysis to preprocess the
data (Section 2.3). In Section 3, we give a survey
of the employed systems and the basic methods
they implement. More details are given about the
discriminative phrase training (Section 3.4) and
the hierarchical reordering model for hierarchical
machine translation (Section 3.5). Experimental
results are discussed in Section 4.

2 Preprocessing

In this section we will describe the modification of
our preprocessing pipeline compared to our 2013
WMT German→English setup.
2.1 Categorization
We put some effort in building better categories for
digits and written numbers. All written numbers

1http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/
translation-task.html

were categorized. In 2013 they were just handled
as normal words which leads to a higher number of
out-of-vocabulary words. For German→English,
in most cases for numbers like ’3,000’ or ’2.34’
the decimal mark ’,’ and the thousands separator
’.’ has to be inverted. As the training data and also
the test sets contain several errors for numbers in
the source as well as in the target part, we put more
effort into producing correct English numbers.

2.2 Remove Foreign Languages

The WMT German→English corpus contains
some bilingual sentence pairs with non-German
source or/and non-English target sentences. For
this WMT translation task, we filtered all non-
matching language pairs (in terms of source lan-
guage German and target language English) from
our bilingual training set.

First, we filtered languages which contain non-
ascii characters. For example Chinese, Arabic or
Russian can be easily filtered when deleting sen-
tences which contain more than 70 percent non-
ascii words. The first examples of Table 1 was
filtered due to the fact, that the source sentence
contains too many non-ascii characters.

In a second step, we filtered European lan-
guages containing ascii characters. We used the
WMT monolingual corpora in Czech, French,
Spanish, English and German to filter these lan-
guages from our bilingual data. We could both
delete a sentence pair if it contains a wrong source
language or a wrong target language. That is the
reason why we even search for English sentences
in the source part and for German sentences in
the target part. For each language, we built a
word count of all words in the monolingual data
for each language separately. We removed punc-
tuation which are no indicator of a language. In
our experiments, we only considered words with
frequency higher than 20 (e.g. to ignore names).
Given the word frequency, we removed a bilingual

sentence pair from our training data if more than
70 percent of the words had a higher count in a
different language then the one we expected. In
Table 1 some example sentences, which were re-
moved, are illustrated.

In Table 2 the amount of sentences and the cor-
responding vocabulary sizes of partial and totally
cleaned data sets are given. Further we provide the
number of out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs) for
newstest2012. The vocabulary size could be re-
duced by ∼130k words for both source and target
side of our bilingual training data while the OOV
rate kept the same. Our experiments showed, that
the translation quality is the same with or with-
out removing wrong sentences. Nevertheless, we
reduced the training data size and also the vocabu-
lary size without any degradation in terms of trans-
lation quality.

2.3 Morpho-syntactic Analysis

In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for
the German→English translation further, the Ger-
man text is preprocessed by splitting German com-
pound words with the frequency-based method de-
scribed in (Koehn and Knight, 2003). To reduce
translation complexity, we employ the long-range
part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by
Popović and Ney (2006).

3 Translation Systems

In this evaluation, we employ phrase-based trans-
lation and hierarchical phrase-based translation.
Both approaches are implemented in Jane (Vilar et
al., 2012; Wuebker et al., 2012), a statistical ma-
chine translation toolkit which has been developed
at RWTH Aachen University and is freely avail-
able for non-commercial use.2 In the newest inter-
nal version, we use the KenLM Language Model
Interface provided by (Heafield, 2011) for both de-
coders.

3.1 Phrase-based System

In the phrase-based decoder (source cardinality
synchronous search, SCSS, Wuebker et al. (2012)),
we use the standard set of models with phrase
translation probabilities and lexical smoothing in
both directions, word and phrase penalty, distance-
based distortion model, an n-gram target language
model and three binary count features. Additional
models used in this evaluation are the hierarchical
reordering model (HRM) (Galley and Manning,
2008) and a word class language model (wcLM)
(Wuebker et al., 2013). The parameter weights
are optimized with minimum error rate training
(MERT) (Och, 2003). The optimization criterion
is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

3.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based System

In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang,
2007), a weighted synchronous context-free gram-
mar is induced from parallel text. In addition to
contiguous lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases
with up to two gaps are extracted. The search is
carried out with a parsing-based procedure. The
standard models integrated into our Jane hierar-
chical systems (Vilar et al., 2010; Huck et al.,
2012) are: Phrase translation probabilities and lex-
ical smoothing probabilities in both translation di-
rections, word and phrase penalty, binary features
marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule, and rules
with non-terminals at the boundaries, three binary
count features, and an n-gram language model.
We utilize the cube pruning algorithm for decod-
ing (Huck et al., 2013a) and optimize the model
weights with MERT. The optimization criterion is
BLEU.

3.3 Other Tools and Techniques

We employ GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to train
word alignments. The two trained alignments
are heuristically merged to obtain a symmetrized
word alignment for phrase extraction. All lan-

guage models (LMs) are created with the SRILM
toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) or with the KenLM lan-
guage model toolkit (Heafield et al., 2013) and are
standard 4-gram LMs with interpolated modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995;
Chen and Goodman, 1998). We evaluate in true-
case with BLEU and TER (Snover et al., 2006).

3.4 Discriminative Phrase Training

In our baseline translation systems the phrase ta-
bles are created by a heuristic extraction from
word alignments and the probabilities are esti-
mated as relative frequencies, which is still the
state-of-the-art for many standard SMT systems.
Here, we applied a more sophisticated discrimi-
native phrase training method for the WMT 2014
German→English task. Similar to (He and Deng,
2012), a gradient-based method is used to opti-
mize a maximum expected BLEU objective, for
which we define BLEU on the sentence level with
smoothed 3-gram and 4-gram precisions. To that
end, the training data is decoded to generate 100-
best lists. We apply a leave-one-out heuristic
(Wuebker et al., 2010) to make better use of the
training data. Using these n-best lists, we itera-
tively perform updates on the phrasal translation
scores of the phrase table. After each iteration,
we run MERT, evaluate on the development set
and select the best performing iteration. In this
work, we perform two rounds of discriminative
training on two separate data sets. In the first
round, training is performed on the concatenation
of newstest2008 through newstest2010 and an au-
tomatic selection from the News-commentary, Eu-
roparl and Common Crawl corpora. The selec-
tion is based on cross-entropy difference of lan-
guage models and IBM-1 models as described by
Mansour et al. (2011) and contains 258K sentence
pairs. The training took 4.5 hours for 30 iterations.
On top of the final phrase-based systems, a second

round of discriminative training is run on the full
news-commentary corpus concatenated with new-
stest2008 through newstest2010.

3.5 A Phrase Orientation Model for
Hierarchical Machine Translation

In Huck et al. (2013b) a lexicalized reorder-
ing model for hierarchical phrase-based machine
translation was introduced. The model scores
monotone, swap, and discontinuous phrase ori-
entations in the manner of the one presented by
(Tillmann, 2004). Since improvements were re-
ported on a Chinese→English translation task, we
investigate the impact of this model on a European
language pair. As in German the word order is
more flexible compared with the target language
English, we expect that an additional reordering
model could improve the translation quality. In
our experiments we use the same settings which
worked best in (Huck et al., 2013b).

4 Setup

We trained the phrase-based and the hierarchical
translation system on all available bilingual train-
ing data. Corpus statistics can be found in the
last row of Table 2. The language model are
4-grams trained on the respective target side of
the bilingual data, 12 of the Shuffled News Crawl
corpus, 14 of the 10

9 French-English corpus and
1
2 of the LDC Gigaword Fifth Edition corpus.
The monolingual data selection is based on cross-
entropy difference as described in (Moore and
Lewis, 2010). For the baseline language model,
we trained separate models for each corpus, which
were then interpolated. For our final experiments,
we also trained a single unpruned language model
on the concatenation of all monolingual data with
KenLM.

4.1 Experimental Results

The results of the phrase-based system (SCSS)
as well as the hierarchical phrase-based system
(HPBT) are summarized in Table 3.

The phrase-based baseline system, which in-
cludes the hierarchical reordering model by (Gal-
ley and Manning, 2008) and is tuned on new-
stest2012, reaches a performance of 25.9% BLEU
on newstest2013. Adding the word class language
model improves performance by 0.4% BLEU ab-
solute and the first round of discriminative phrase
training by 0.5% BLEU absolute. Next, we
switched to tuning on a concatenation of new-
stest2011 and newstest2012, which we expect to
be more reliable with respect to unseen data. Al-
though the BLEU score does not improve and TER
goes up slightly, we kept this tuning set in the sub-
sequent setups, as it yielded longer translations,
which in our experience will usually be preferred
by human evaluators. Switching from the inter-
polated language model to the unpruned language
model trained with KenLM on the full concate-
nated monolingual training data in a single pass
gained us another 0.3% BLEU. For the final sys-
tem, we ran a second round of discriminative train-
ing on different training data (cf. Section 3.4),
which increased performance by 0.1% BLEU to
the final score 27.2.

For the phrase-based system, we also exper-
imented with weighted phrase extraction (Man-
sour and Ney, 2012), but did not observe improve-
ments.

The hierarchical phrase-based baseline without

any additional model is on the same level as the
phrase-based system including the word class lan-
guage model, hierarchical reordering model and
discriminative phrase training in terms of BLEU.
However, extending the system with a word class
language model or the additional reordering mod-
els does not seem to help. Even the combination
of both models does not improve the translation
quality. Note, that the hierarchical system was
tuned on the concatenation newstest2011 and new-
stest2012. The final system employs both word
class language model and hierarchical reordering
model.

Both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-
based final systems are used in the EU-Bridge sys-
tem combination (Freitag et al., 2014).

5 Conclusion

For the participation in the WMT 2014 shared
translation task, RWTH experimented with both
phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems.
For both approaches, we applied a hierarchical
phrase reordering model and a word class lan-
guage model. For the phrase-based system we em-
ployed discriminative phrase training. Addition-
ally, improvements of our preprocessing pipeline
compared to our WMT 2013 setup were described.
New introduced categories lead to a lower amount
of out-of-vocabulary words. Filtering the corpus
for wrong languages gives us lower vocabulary
sizes for source and target without loosing any per-
formance.
