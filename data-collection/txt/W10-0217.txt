Abstract 

We explore the task of automatic classifica-
tion of texts by the emotions expressed. Our 
novel method arranges neutrality, polarity and 
emotions hierarchically. We test the method 
on two datasets and show that it outperforms 
the corresponding “flat” approach, which does 
not take into account the hierarchical informa-
tion. The highly imbalanced structure of most 
of the datasets in this area, particularly the two 
datasets with which we worked, has a dramat-
ic effect on the performance of classification. 
The hierarchical approach helps alleviate the 
effect. 

1 Introduction 

Computational approaches to emotion analysis 
have focused on various emotion modalities, but 
there was only limited effort in the direction of 
automatic recognition of emotion in text (Aman, 
2007). 
Oleveres et al.(1998), as one of the first works in 
emotion detection in text, uses a simple Natural 
Language Parser for keyword spotting, phrase 
length measurement and emoticon identification. 
They apply a rule-based expert system to construct 
emotion scores based on the parsed text and con-
textual information. However their simple word-
level analysis system is not sufficient when the 
emotion is expressed by more complicated phrases 
and sentences. 
More advanced systems for textual emotion recog-
nition performed sentence-level analysis.  Liu et al. 
(2003), proposed an approach aimed at understand-
ing the underlying semantics of language using 
large-scale real-world commonsense knowledge to 
classify sentences into “basic” emotion categories. 
They developed a commonsense affect model 

enabling the analysis of the affective qualities of 
text in a robust way.  
In SemEval 2007, one of the tasks was carried out 
in an unsupervised setting and the emphasis was on 
the study of emotion in lexical semantics (Strappa-
rava and Mihalcea, 2008; Chaumartin, 2007; Koza-
reva et al., 2007; Katz et al., 2007). Neviarouskaya 
et al.(2009) applied a rule-based approach to affect 
recognition from a blog text. However, statistical 
and machine learning approaches have became a 
method of choice for constructing a wide variety of 
NLP applications (Wiebe et al., 2005). 

There has been previous work using statistical 
methods and supervised machine learning, includ-
ing (Aman, 2007; Katz et al., 2007; Alm, 2008; 
Wilson et al., 2009). Most of that research concen-
trated on feature selections and applying lexical 
semantics rather than on different learning 
schemes. In particular, only flat classification has 
been considered. 
According to Kiritchenko et al. (2006), “Hierar-
chical categorization deals with categorization 
problems where categories are organized in hierar-
chies”. Hierarchical text categorization places new 
items into a collection with a predefined hierar-
chical structure. The categories are partially or-
dered, usually from more generic to more specific.  
Koller and Sahami (1997) carried out the first 
proper study of a hierarchical text categorization 
problem in 1997. More work in hierarchical text 
categorization has been reported later. Keshtkar 
and Inkpen (2009) applied a hierarchical approach 
to mood classification: classifying blog posts into 
132 moods. The connection with our work is only 
indirect, because – even though moods and emo-
tions may seem similar – their hierarchy structure 
and the classification task are quite different. The 
work reported in (Kiritchenko et al., 2006) is more 
general. It explores two main aspects of hierarchic-

140



al text categorization: learning algorithms and per-
formance evaluation.  

In this paper, we extend our preliminary work 
(Ghazi et al., 2010) on hierarchical classification. 
Hierarchical classification is a new approach to 
emotional analysis, which considers the relation 
between neutrality, polarity and emotion of a text. 
The main idea is to arrange these categories and 
their interconnections into a hierarchy and leverage 
it in the classification process. 

We categorize sentences into six basic emotion 
classes; there also may, naturally, be no emotion in 
a sentence. The emotions are happiness, sadness, 
fear, anger, disgust, and surprise (Ekman, 1992). 
In one of the datasets we applied, we did consider 
the class non-emotional. 

For these categories, we have considered two 
forms of hierarchy for classification, with two or 
three levels. In the two-level method, we explore 
the effect of neutral instances on one dataset and 
the effect of polarity on the other dataset. In the 
three-level hierarchy, we consider neutrality and 
polarity together. 

Our experiments on data annotated with emotions 
show performance which exceeds that of the corre-
sponding flat approach. 

Section 2 of this paper gives an overview of the 
datasets and feature sets. Section 3 describes both 
hierarchical classification methods and their 
evaluation with respect to flat classification results. 
Section 4 discusses future work and presents a few 
conclusions. 

2 Data and Feature Sets 

2.1 Datasets 
The statistical methods typically require training 
and test corpora, manually annotated with respect 
to each language-processing task to be learned 
(Wiebe et al., 2005). One of the datasets in our 
experiments is a corpus of blog sentences anno-
tated with Ekman’s emotion labels (Aman, 2007). 
The second dataset is a sentence-annotated corpus 
resource divided into three parts for large-scale 
exploration of affect in children’s stories (Alm, 
2008). 

In the first dataset, each sentence is tagged by a 
dominant emotion in the sentence, or labelled as 

non-emotional. The dataset contains 173 weblog 
posts annotated by two judges. Table 1 shows the 
details of the dataset. 

In the second dataset, two annotators have anno-
tated 176 stories. The affects considered are the 
same as Ekman’s six emotions, except that the 
surprise class is subdivided into positive surprise 
and negative surprise. We run our experiments on 
only sentences with high agreement- sentences 
with the same affective labels annotated by both 
annotators. That is the version of the dataset which 
merged angry and disgusted instances and com-
bined the positive and negative surprise classes. 
The resulting dataset, therefore, has only five 
classes (Alm, 2008). Table 1 presents more details 
about the datasets, including the range of frequen-
cies for the class distribution (Min is the proportion 
of sentences with the most infrequent class, Max is 
the proportion for sentences with the most frequent 
class.) The proportion of the most frequent class 
also gives us a baseline for the accuracies of our 
classifiers (since the poorest baseline classifier 
could always choose the most frequent class).

2.2 Feature sets 
In (Ghazi et al., 2010), three sets of features – one 
corpus-based and two lexically-based – are com-
pared on Aman’s datasets. The first experiment is a 
corpus-based classification which uses unigrams 
(bag-of-words). In the second experiment, classifi-
cation was based on features derived from the 
Prior-Polarity lexicon1 (Wilson et al. 2009); the 
features were the tokens common between the 
prior-polarity lexicon and the chosen dataset. In the 
last experiment, we used a combination of the 
emotional lists of words from Roget’s Thesaurus2 
(Aman and Szpakowicz, 2008) and WordNet Af-
fect3 (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004); we call it 
the polarity feature set.

Based on the results and the discussion in (Ghazi et 
al., 2010), we decided to use the polarity feature 
set in our experiments. This feature set has certain 
advantages. It is quite a bit smaller than the uni-
gram features, and we have observed that they ap-
pear to be more meaningful. For example, the 
unigram features include (inevitably non-
emotional) names of people and countries. It is 
also possible to have misspelled tokens in uni-
grams, while the prior-polarity lexicon features are 
well-defined words usually considered as polar. 
Besides, lexical features are known to be more 
domain- and corpus-independent. Last but not 
least, our chosen feature set significantly outper-
forms the third set. 

2.3 Classification 
As a classification algorithm, we use the support 
vector machines (SVM) algorithm with tenfold 
cross-validation as a testing option. It is shown that 
SVM obtains good performance in text classifica-
tion: it scales well to the large numbers of features 
(Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Aman, 2007).  
We apply the same settings at each level of the 
hierarchy for our hierarchical approach classifica-
tion.  
In hierarchical categorization, categories are organ-
ized into levels (Kiritchenko et al., 2006). We use 
the hierarchical categories to put more knowledge 
into our classification method as the category hier-
archies are carefully composed manually to repre-
sent our knowledge of the subject. We will achieve 
that in two forms of hierarchy. A two-level hierar-
chy represents the relation of emotion and neutral-
ity in text, as well as the relation of positive and 
negative polarity. These two relations are exam-
ined in two different experiments, each on a sepa-
rate dataset. 

A three-level hierarchy is concerned with the rela-
tion between polarity and emotions along with the 
relation between neutrality and emotion. We as-
sume that, of Ekman's six emotions, happiness be-
longs to the positive polarity class, while the other 
five emotions have negative polarity. This is quite 
similar to the three-level hierarchy of affect labels 
used by Alm (2008). In her diagram, she considers 
happiness and positive surprise as positive, and the 
rest as negative emotions. She has not, however, 
used this model in the classification approach: 

classification experiments were only run at three 
separate affect levels. She also considers positive 
and negative surprise as one Surprise class. 

For each level of our proposed hierarchy, we run 
two sets of experiments. In the first set, we assume 
that all the instances are correctly classified at the 
preceding levels, so we only need to be concerned 
with local mistakes. Because we do not have to 
deal with instances misclassified at the previous 
level, we call these results reference results.  

In the second set of experiments, the methodology 
is different than in (Ghazi et al. 2010). In that work 
both training and testing of subsequent levels is 
based on the results of preceding levels. A question 
arises, however: once we have good data available, 
why train on incorrect data which result from mis-
takes at the preceding level? That is why we de-
cided to train on correctly-labelled data and when 
testing, to compute global results by cumulating 
the mistakes from all the levels of the hierarchical 
classification. In other words, classification mis-
takes at one level of the hierarchy carry on as mis-
takes at the next levels. Therefore, we talk of 
global results because we compute the accuracy, 
precision, recall and F-measure globally, based on 
the results at all levels. These results characterize 
the hierarchical classification approach when test-
ing on new sentences: the classifiers are applied in 
a pipeline order: level 1, then level 2 on the results 
of the previous level (then level 3 if we are in the 
three-level setting).   
In the next section, we show the experiments and 
results on our chosen datasets. 
 

3 Results and discussions 

3.1 Two-level classification 
This section has two parts. The main goal of the 
first part is to find out how the presence of neutral 
instances affects the performance of features for 
distinguishing between emotional classes in 
Aman’s dataset. This was motivated by a similar 
work in polarity classification (Wilson et al., 
2009). 

In the second part, we discuss the effect of consid-
ering positive and negative polarity of emotions for 
five affect classes in Alm’s dataset.

3.1.1 Neutral-Emotional 

At the first level, emotional versus non-emotional 
classification tries to determine whether an in-
stance is neutral or emotional. The second step 
takes all instances which level 1 classified as emo-
tional, and tries to classify them into one of Ek-
man's six emotions. Table 2 presents the result of 
experiments and, for comparison, the flat classifi-
cation results. A comparison of the results in both 
experiments with flat classification shows that in 
both cases the accuracy of two-level approach is 
significantly better than the accuracy of flat classi-
fication. 

One of the results worth discussing further is the 
precision of the non-emotional class: it increases 
while recall decreases. We will see the same pat-
tern in further experiments. This happens to the 
classes which used to dominate in flat classifica-
tion but they no longer dominate in hierarchical 
classification. Classifiers tends to give priority to a 
dominant class, so more instances are placed in 
this class; thus, classification achieves low preci-
sion and high recall. Hierarchical methods tend to 
produce higher precision. 

The difference between precision and recall of the 
happiness class in the flat approach and the two-
level approach cannot be ignored. It can be ex-
plained as follows: at the second level there are no 
more non-emotional instances, so the happiness 

class dominates, with 42% of all the instances. As 
explained before, this gives high recall and low 
precision for the happiness class. We hope to ad-
dress this big gap between precision and recall of 
the happiness class in the next experiments, three-
level classification. It separates happiness from the 
other five emotions, so it makes the number of in-
stances of each level more balanced. 
Our main focus is comparing hierarchical and flat 
classification, assuming all the other parameters 
are fixed. We mention, however, the best previous 
results achieved by Aman (2007) on the same data-
set. Her best result was obtained by combining 
corpus-based unigrams, features derived from 
emotional lists of words from Roget’s Thesaurus 
(explained in 2.2) and common words between the 
dataset and WordNetAffect. She also applied SVM 
with tenfold cross validation. The results appear in 
Table 3.

By comparing the reference results in Table 2 with 
Aman’s result shown in Table 3, our results on two  
classes, non-emo and sadness are significantly bet-
ter. Even though recall of our experiments is high-
er for happiness class, the precision makes the F-
measure to be lower. The reason behind the differ-
ence between the precisions is the same as their 
difference between in our hierarchical and flat 
comparisons. As it was also mentioned there we 
hope to address this problem in three-level classifi-
cation. Both precision and recall of the sadness in 
our experiments is higher than Aman’s results. We 
have a higher precision for fear, but recall is 
slightly lower. For the last three classes our preci-
sion is higher while recall is significantly lower.  
 
The size of these three classes, which are the smal-
lest classes in the dataset, appears to be the reason. 
It is possible that the small set of features that we 
are using will recall fewer instances of these 
classes comparing to the bigger feature sets used 
by Aman (2007).  

3.1.2 Negative-Positive polarity 

These experiments have been run on Alm’s dataset 
with five emotion classes. This part is based on the 
assumption that the happiness class is positive and 
the remaining four classes are negative.  

 

 

At the first level, positive versus negative classifi-
cation tries to determine whether an instance bears 
a positive emotion. The second step takes all in-
stances which level 1 classified as negative, and 
tries to classify them into one of the four negative 
classes, namely sadness, fear, surprise and anger-
disgust. The results show a higher accuracy in ref-
erence results while it is slightly lower for global 
results. In terms of precision and recall, however, 
there is a high increase in precision of positive 
(happiness) class while the recall decreases. 
The results show a higher accuracy in reference 
results while it is slightly lower for global results. 
In terms of precision and recall, however, there is a 
high increase in precision of positive (happiness) 
class while the recall decreases. 

We also see a higher F-measure for all classes in 
the reference results. That confirms the consistency 
between the result in Table 2 and Table 4. 

In the global measurements, recall is higher for all 
the classes at the second level, but the F-measure is 
higher only for three classes. 
Here we cannot compare our results with the best 
previous results achieved by Alm (2008), because 
the datasets and the experiments are not the same. 
She reports the accuracy of the classification re-
sults for three sub-corpora separately. She random-
ly selected neutral instances from the annotated 
data and added them to the dataset, which makes it

ues for each class are shown in bold).

different than the data set we used in our experi-
ments.  

3.2 Three-level classification 
In this approach, we go even further: we break the 
seven-class classification task into three levels. 
The first level defines whether the instance is emo-
tional. At the second level the instances defined as 
emotional by the first level will be classified on 
their polarity. At the third level, we assume that the 
instances of happiness class have positive polarity 
and the other five emotions negative polarity. That 
is why we take the negative instances from the 
second level and classify them into the five nega-
tive emotion classes. Table 5 presents the results of  

this classification. The results show that the accu-
racy of both reference results and global results are 
higher than flat classification, but the accuracy of 
the global results is not significantly better. 

At the first and second level, the F-measure of no-
emotion and happiness classes is significantly bet-
ter. At the third level, except in the class disgust, 
we see an increase in the F-measure of all classes 
in comparison with both the two-level and flat 
classification.

Also, as shown by the two-level experiments, the 
results of the second level of the reference results 
approach an increase in the precision of the happi-
ness class. That makes the instances defined as 
happiness more precise. 
By comparing the results with Table 3, which is 
the best previous results, we see an increase in the 
precision of happiness class and its F-measure 
consequently; therefore in these results we get a 
higher F-measure for three classes, non-emo, sad-
ness and fear. We get the same F-measure for hap-
piness and slightly lower F-measure for surprise 
but we still have a lower F-measure for the other 
two classes, namely, disgust and anger. The other 
difference is the high increase in the recall value 
for fear. 

4 Conclusions and Future Work 

The focus of this study was a comparison of the 
hierarchical and flat classification approaches to 
emotional analysis and classification. In the emo-
tional classification we noticed that having a 
dominant class in the dataset degrades the results 
significantly. A classifier trained on imbalanced 
data gives biased results for the classes with more 
instances. Our results, based on a novel method, 
shows that the hierarchical classification approach 
is better at dealing with the highly imbalanced 
data. We also saw a considerable improvement in 
the classification results when we did not deal with 
the errors from previous steps and slightly better 
results when we evaluated the results globally. 

In the future, we will consider different levels of 
our hierarchy as different tasks which could be 
handled differently. Each of the tasks has its own 
specification. We can, therefore, definitely benefit 
from analyzing each task separately and defining 
different sets of features and classification methods 
for each task rather than using the same method for 
every task.
