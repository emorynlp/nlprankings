Abstract

Existing concept-color-emotion lexicons
limit themselves to small sets of basic emo-
tions and colors, which cannot capture the
rich pallet of color terms that humans use
in communication. In this paper we begin
to address this problem by building a novel,
color-emotion-concept association lexicon
via crowdsourcing. This lexicon, which we
call CLEX, has over 2,300 color terms, over
3,000 affect terms and almost 2,000 con-
cepts. We investigate the relation between
color and concept, and color and emotion,
reinforcing results from previous studies, as
well as discovering new associations. We
also investigate cross-cultural differences in
color-emotion associations between US and
India-based annotators.

1 Introduction

People typically use color terms to describe the
visual characteristics of objects, and certain col-
ors often have strong associations with particu-
lar objects, e.g., blue - sky, white - snow. How-
ever, people also take advantage of color terms to
strengthen their messages and convey emotions in
natural interactions (Jacobson and Bender, 1996;
Hardin and Maffi, 1997). Colors are both indica-
tive of and have an effect on our feelings and emo-
tions. Some colors are associated with positive
emotions, e.g., joy, trust and admiration and some
with negative emotions, e.g., aggressiveness, fear,
boredom and sadness (Ortony et al., 1988).

Given the importance of color and visual de-
scriptions in conveying emotion, obtaining a
deeper understanding of the associations between
colors, concepts and emotions may be helpful for

many tasks in language understanding and gener-
ation. A detailed set of color-concept-emotion as-
sociations (e.g., brown - darkness - boredom; red -
blood - anger) could be quite useful for sentiment
analysis, for example, in helping to understand
what emotion a newspaper article, a fairy tale, or
a tweet is trying to evoke (Alm et al., 2005; Mo-
hammad, 2011b; Kouloumpis et al., 2011). Color-
concept-emotion associations may also be useful
for textual entailment, and for machine translation
as a source of paraphrasing.

Color-concept-emotion associations also have
the potential to enhance human-computer inter-
actions in many real- and virtual-world domains,
e.g., online shopping, and avatar construction in
gaming environments. Such knowledge may al-
low for clearer and hopefully more natural de-
scriptions by users, for example searching for
a sky-blue shirt rather than blue or light blue
shirt. Our long term goal is to use color-emotion-
concept associations to enrich dialog systems
with information that will help them generate
more appropriate responses to users’ different
emotional states.

This work introduces a new lexicon of color-
concept-emotion associations, created through
crowdsourcing. We call this lexicon CLEX1. It
is comparable in size to only two known lexi-
cons: WORDNET-AFFECT (Strapparava and Val-
itutti, 2004) and EMOLEX (Mohammad and Tur-
ney, 2010). In contrast to the development of
these lexicons, we do not restrict our annotators
to a particular set of emotions. This allows us to

collect more linguistically rich color-concept an-
notations associated with mood, cognitive state,
behavior and attitude. We also do not have any
restrictions on color naming, which helps us to
discover a rich lexicon of color terms and collo-
cations that represent various hues, darkness, sat-
uration and other natural language collocations.

We also perform a comprehensive analysis of
the data by investigating several questions includ-
ing: What affect terms are evoked by a certain
color, e.g., positive vs. negative? What con-
cepts are frequently associated with a particular
color? What is the distribution of part-of-speech
tags over concepts and affect terms in the data col-
lected without any preselected set of affect terms
and concepts? What affect terms are strongly as-
sociated with a certain concept or a category of
concepts and is there any correlation with a se-
mantic orientation of a concept?

Finally, we share our experience collecting the
data using crowdsourcing, describe advantages
and disadvantages as well as the strategies we
used to ensure high quality annotations.

2 Related Work

Interestingly, some color-concept associations
vary by culture and are influenced by the tra-
ditions and beliefs of a society. As shown in
(Sable and Akcay, 2010) green represents danger
in Malaysia, envy in Belgium, love and happiness
in Japan; red is associated with luck in China and
Denmark, but with bad luck in Nigeria and Ger-
many and reflects ambition and desire in India.

Some expressions involving colors share the
same meaning across many languages. For in-
stance, white heat or red heat (the state of high
physical and mental tension), blue-blood (an aris-
tocrat, royalty), white-collar or blue collar (of-
fice clerks). However, there are some expres-
sions where color associations differ across lan-
guages, e.g., British or Italian black eye becomes
blue in Germany, purple in Spain and black-butter
in France; your French, Italian and English neigh-
bors are green with envy while Germans are yel-
low with envy (Bortoli and Maroto, 2001).

There has been little academic work on con-
structing color-concept and color-emotion lexi-
cons. The work most closely related to ours
collects concept-color (Mohammad, 2011c) and
concept-emotion (EMOLEX) associations, both
relying on crowdsourcing. His project involved

collecting color and emotion annotations for
10,170 word-sense pairs from Macquarie The-
saurus2. They analyzed their annotations, looking
for associations with the 11 basic color terms from
Berlin and Key (1988). The set of emotion labels
used in their annotations was restricted to the set
of 8 basic emotions proposed by Plutchik (1980).
Their annotators were restricted to the US, and
produced 4.45 annotations per word-sense pair on
average.

There is also a commercial project from Cym-
bolism3 to collect concept-color associations. It
has 561,261 annotations for a restricted set of 256
concepts, mainly nouns, adjectives and adverbs.

Other work on collecting emotional aspect
of concepts includes WordNet-Affect (WNA)
(Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), the General En-
quirer (GI) (Stone et al., 1966), Affective Forms
of English Words (Bradley and Lang, 1999) and
Elliott’s Affective Reasoner (Elliott, 1992).

The WNA lexicon is a set of affect terms from
WordNet (Miller, 1995). It contains emotions,
cognitive states, personality traits, behavior, at-
titude and feelings, e.g., joy, doubt, competitive,
cry, indifference, pain. Total of 289 affect terms
were manually extracted, but later the lexicon was
extended using WordNet semantic relationships.
WNA covers 1903 affect terms - 539 nouns, 517
adjectives, 238 verbs and 15 adverbs.

The General Enquirer covers 11,788 concepts
labeled with 182 category labels including cer-
tain affect categories (e.g., pleasure, arousal, feel-
ing, pain) in addition to positive/negative seman-
tic orientation for concepts4.

Affective Forms of English Words is a work
which describes a manually collected set of nor-
mative emotional ratings for 1K English words
that are rated in terms of emotional arousal (rang-
ing from calm to excited), affective valence (rang-
ing from pleasant to unpleasant) and dominance
(ranging from in control to dominated).

Elliott’s Affective Reasoner is a collection of
programs that is able to reason about human emo-
tions. The system covers a set of 26 emotion cat-
egories from Ortony et al (1988).

Kaya (2004) and Strapparava and Ozbal (2010)
both have worked on inferring emotions associ-
ated with colors using semantic similarity. Their

research found that Americans perceive red as ex-
citement, yellow as cheer, purple as dignity and
associate blue with comfort and security. Other
research includes that geared toward discovering
culture-specific color-concept associations (Gage,
1993) and color preference, for example, in chil-
dren vs. adults (Ou et al., 2011).

3 Data Collection

In order to collect color-concept and color-
emotion associations, we use Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk5. It is a fast and relatively inexpensive
way to get a large amount of data from many cul-
tures all over the world.

3.1 MTurk and Data Quality

Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing
platform that has been extensively used for ob-
taining low-cost human annotations for various
linguistic tasks over the last few years (Callison-
Burch, 2009). The quality of the data obtained
from non-expert annotators, also referred to as
workers or turkers, was investigated by Snow et
al (2008). Their empirical results show that the
quality of non-expert annotations is comparable
to the quality of expert annotations on a variety of
natural language tasks, but the cost of the annota-
tion is much lower.

There are various quality control strategies that
can be used to ensure annotation quality. For in-
stance, one can restrict a “crowd” by creating a
pilot task that allows only workers who passed
the task to proceed with annotations (Chen and
Dolan, 2011). In addition, new quality control
mechanisms have been recently introduced e.g.,
Masters. They are groups of workers who are
trusted for their consistent high quality annota-
tions, but to employ them costs more.

Our task required direct natural language in-
put from workers and did not include any mul-
tiple choice questions (which tend to attract more
cheating). Thus, we limited our quality control ef-
forts to (1) checking for empty input fields and (2)
blocking copy/paste functionality on a form. We
did not ask workers to complete any qualification
tasks because it is impossible to have gold stan-
dard answers for color-emotion and color-concept
associations. In addition, we limited our crowd to

5http://www.mturk.com

a set of trusted workers who had been consistently
working on similar tasks for us.

3.2 Task Design

Our task was designed to collect a linguistically
rich set of color terms, emotions, and concepts
that were associated with a large set of colors,
specifically the 152 RGB values corresponding to
facial features of cartoon human avatars. In to-
tal we had 36 colors for hair/eyebrows, 18 for
eyes, 27 for lips, 26 for eye shadows, 27 for fa-
cial mask and 18 for skin. These data is necessary
to achieve our long-term goal which is to model
natural human-computer interactions in a virtual
world domain such as the avatar editor.

We designed two MTurk tasks. For Task 1, we
showed a swatch for one RGB value and asked
50 workers to name the color, describe emotions
this color evokes and define a set of concepts as-
sociated with that color. For Task 2, we showed a
particular facial feature and a swatch in a particu-
lar color, and asked 50 workers to name the color
and describe the concepts and emotions associ-
ated with that color. Figure 1 shows what would
be presented to worker for Task 2.

Q1. How would you name this color?
Q2. What emotion does this color evoke?
Q3. What concepts do you associate with it?

Figure 1: Example of MTurk Task 2. Task 1 is the
same except that only a swatch is given.

The design that we suggested has a minor lim-
itation in that a color swatch may display differ-
ently on different monitors. However, we hope to
overcome this issue by collecting 50 annotations
per RGB value. The example color e→ emotion c→
concept associations produced by different anno-
tators ai are shown below:

• [R=222, G=207, B=186] (a1) light golden
yellow e→ purity, happiness c→ butter cookie,
vanilla; (a2) gold

e→ cheerful, happy c→ sun,
corn; (a3) golden

e→ sexy c→ beach, jewelery.

• [R=218, G=97, B=212] (a4) pinkish pur-
ple e→ peace, tranquility, stressless c→ justin

308



bieber’s headphones, someday perfume; (a5)
pink e→ happiness c→ rose, bougainvillea.

In addition, we collected data about workers’
gender, age, native language, number of years of
experience with English, and color preferences.
This data is useful for investigating variance in an-
notations for color-emotion-concept associations
among workers from different cultural and lin-
guistic backgrounds.

4 Data Analysis

We collected 15,200 annotations evenly divided
between the two tasks over 12 days. In total, 915
workers (41% male, 51% female and 8% who did
not specify), mainly from India and United States,
completed our tasks as shown in Table 1. 18%
workers produced 20 or more annotations. They
spent 78 seconds on average per annotation with
an average salary rate $2.3 per hour ($0.05 per
completed task).

Table 1: Demographic information about annota-
tors: top 5 countries represented in our dataset.

In total, we collected 2,315 unique color terms,
3,397 unique affect terms, and 1,957 unique con-
cepts for the given 152 RGB values. In the
sections below we discuss our findings on color
naming, color-emotion and color-concept associ-
ations. We also give a comparison of annotated
affect terms and concepts from CLEX and other
existing lexicons.

4.1 Color Terms
Berlin and Kay (1988) state that as languages
evolve they acquire new color terms in a strict
chronological order. When a language has only
two colors they are white (light, warm) and black
(dark, cold). English is considered to have 11 ba-
sic colors: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue,
brown, pink, purple, orange and gray, which is
known as the B&K order.

In addition, colors can be distinguished along at
most three independent dimensions of hue (olive,

orange), darkness (dark, light, medium), satura-
tion (grayish, vivid), and brightness (deep, pale)
(Mojsilovic, 2002). Interestingly, we observe
these dimensions in CLEX by looking for B&K
color terms and their frequent collocations. We
present the top 10 color collocations for the B&K
colors in Table 2. As can be seen, color terms
truly are distinguished by darkness, saturation and
brightness terms e.g., light, dark, greenish, deep.
In addition, we find that color terms are also as-
sociated with color-specific collocations, e.g., sky
blue, chocolate brown, pea green, salmon pink,
carrot orange. These collocations were produced
by annotators to describe the color of particular
RGB values. We investigate these color-concept
associations in more details in Section 4.3.

In total, the CLEX has 2,315 unique color

names for the set of 152 RGB values. The
inter-annotator agreement rate on color naming is
shown in Table 3. We report free-marginal Kappa
(Randolph, 2005) because we did not force an-
notators to assign certain number of RGB values
to a certain number of color terms. Additionally,
we report inter-annotator agreement for an exact
string match e.g., purple, green and a substring
match e.g., pale yellow = yellow = golden yellow.

4.2 Color-Emotion Associations
In total, the CLEX lexicon has 3,397 unique af-
fect terms representing feelings (calm, pleasure),
emotions (joy, love, anxiety), attitudes (indiffer-
ence, caution), and mood (anger, amusement).
The affect terms in CLEX include the 8 basic emo-
tions from (Plutchik, 1980): joy, sadness, anger,
fear, disgust, surprise, trust and anticipation6

CLEX is a very rich lexicon because we did not
restrict our annotators to any specific set of affect
terms. A wide range of parts-of-speech are rep-
resented, as shown in the first column in Table 4.
For instance, the term love is represented by other
semantically related terms such as: lovely, loved,
loveliness, loveless, love-able and the term joy is
represented as enjoy, enjoyable, enjoyment, joy-
ful, joyfulness, overjoyed.

Table 4: Main syntactic categories for affect terms
and concepts in CLEX.

The manually constructed portion of
WORDNET-AFFECT includes 101 positive
and 188 negative affect terms (Strapparava and
6The set of 8 Plutchik’s emotions is a superset of emotions
from (Ekman, 1992).

Valitutti, 2004). Of this set, 41% appeared at
least once in CLEX. We also looked specifically
at the set of terms labeled as emotions in the
WORDNET-AFFECT hierarchy. Of these, 12 are
positive emotions and 10 are negative emotions.

We found that 9 out of 12 positive emotion
terms (except self-pride, levity and fearlessness)
and 9 out of 10 negative emotion terms (except in-
gratitude) also appear in CLEX as shown in Table
5. Thus, we can conclude that annotators do not
associate any colors with self-pride, levity, fear-
lessness and ingratitude. In addition, some emo-
tions were associated more frequently with colors
than others. For instance, positive emotions like
calmness, joy, love are more frequent in CLEX
than expectation and ingratitude; negative emo-
tions like sadness, fear are more frequent than
shame, humility and daze.

Positive Freq. Negative Freq.
calmness 1045 sadness 356
joy 527 fear 250
love 482 anxiety 55
hope 147 despair 19
affection 86 compassion 10

expectation 3 humility 3
gratitude 3 daze 1

Table 5: WORDNET-AFFECT positive and neg-
ative emotion terms from CLEX. Emotions are
sorted by frequency in decreasing order from the
total 27,802 annotations.

Next, we analyze the color-emotion associ-
ations in CLEX in more detail and compare
them with the only other publicly-available color-
emotion lexicon, EMOLEX. Recall that EMOLEX
(Mohammad, 2011a) has 11 B&K colors associ-
ated with 8 basic positive and negative emotions
from (Plutchik, 1980). Affect terms in CLEX are
not labeled as conveying positive or negative emo-
tions. Instead, we use the overlapping 289 affect
terms between WORDNET-AFFECT and CLEX
and propagate labels from WORDNET-AFFECT to
the corresponding affect terms in CLEX. As a re-
sult we discover positive and negative affect term
associations with the 11 B&K colors. Table 6
shows the percentage of positive and negative af-
fect term associations with colors for both CLEX
and EMOLEX.

gray 1.0 5.7 3.6 14.1

Table 6: The percentage of affect terms associated
with B&K colors in CLEX and EMOLEX (similar
color-emotion associations are shown in bold).

The percentage of color-emotion associations
in CLEX and EMOLEX differs because the set of
affect terms in CLEX consists of 289 positive and
negative affect terms compared to 8 affect terms
in EMOLEX. Nevertheless, we observe the same
pattern as (Mohammad, 2011a) for negative emo-
tions. They are associated with black, red and
gray colors, except yellow becomes a color of
positive emotions in CLEX. Moreover, we found
the associations with the color brown to be am-
biguous as it was associated with both positive
and negative emotions. In addition, we did not ob-
serve strong associations between white and pos-
itive emotions. This may be because white is the
color of grief in India. The rest of the positive
emotions follow the EMOLEX pattern and are as-
sociated with green, pink, blue and purple colors.

Next, we perform a detailed comparison be-
tween CLEX and EMOLEX color-emotion asso-
ciations for the 11 B&K colors and the 8 basic
emotions from (Plutchik, 1980) in Table 7. Recall
that annotations in EMOLEX are done by workers
from the USA only. Thus, we report two num-
bers for CLEX - annotations from workers from
the USA (CA) and all annotations (C). We take
EMOLEX results from (Mohammad, 2011c). We
observe a strong correlation between CLEX and
EMOLEX affect lexicons for some color-emotion
associations. For instance, anger has a strong as-
sociation with red and brown, anticipation with
green, fear with black, joy with pink, sadness
with black, brown and gray, surprise with yel-
low and orange, and finally, trust is associated
with blue and brown. Nonetheless, we also found

a disagreement in color-emotion associations be-
tween CLEX and EMOLEX. For instance antic-
ipation is associated with orange in CLEX com-
pared to white, red or yellow in EMOLEX. We also
found quite a few inconsistent associations with
the disgust emotion. This inconsistency may be
explained by several reasons: (a) EMOLEX asso-
ciates emotions with colors through concepts, but
CLEX has color-emotion associations obtained
directly from annotators; (b) CLEX has 3,397
affect terms compared to 8 basic emotions in
EMOLEX. Therefore, it may be introducing some
ambiguous color-emotion associations.

Finally, we investigate cross-cultural differ-
ences in color-emotion associations between the
two most representative groups of our annotators:
US-based and India-based. We consider the 8
Plutchik’s emotions and allow associations with
all possible color terms (rather than only 11 B&K
colors). We show top 5 colors associated with
emotions for two groups of annotators in Figure 2.
For example, we found that US-based annotators
associate pink with joy, dark brown with trust vs.
India-based annotators who associate yellow with
joy and blue with trust.

4.3 Color-Concept Associations
In total, workers annotated the 152 RGB values
with 37,693 concepts which is on average 2.47
concepts compared to 1.82 affect term per anno-
tation. CLEX contains 1,957 unique concepts in-
cluding 1,667 nouns, 23 verbs, 28 adjectives, and
12 adverbs. We investigate an overlap of con-
cepts by part-of-speech tag between CLEX and
other lexicons including EMOLEX (EL), Affec-
tive Norms of English Words (AN), General In-
quirer (GI). The results are shown in Table 8.

Finally, we generate concept clusters associ-
ated with yellow, white and brown colors in Fig-
ure 3. From the clusters, we observe the most
frequent k concepts associated with these colors
have a correlation with either positive or negative
emotion. For example, white is frequently associ-
ated with snow, milk, cloud and all of these con-
cepts evolve positive emotions. This observation
helps resolve the ambiguity in color-emotion as-
sociations we found in Table 7.

Table 7: The percentage of the 8 basic emotions associated with 11 B&K colors in CLEX vs. EMOLEX,
e.g., sadness is associated with black by 36% of annotators in EMOLEX(EA), 22.1% in CLEX(CA) by
US-based annotators only and 24% in CLEX(C) by all annotators; we report zero associations by “-”.

(e) Anger - US: 133, I: 160 (f) Sadness - US: 171, I: 142 (g) Fear - US: 95, I: 105 (h) Disgust - US: 54, I: 16

Figure 2: Apparent cross-cultural differences in color-emotion associations between US- and India-
based annotators. 10.6% of US workers associated joy with pink, while 7.1% India-based workers
associated joy with yellow (based on 331 joy associations from the US and from 154 India).

concept association lexicon, CLEX. This lexicon
links concepts, color terms and emotions to spe-
cific RGB values. This lexicon may help to dis-
ambiguate objects when modeling conversational
interactions in many domains. We have examined
the association between color terms and positive
or negative emotions.

Our work also investigated cross-cultural dif-
ferences in color-emotion associations between
India- and US-based annotators. We identified
frequent color-concept associations, which sug-
gests that concepts associated with a particular
color may express the same sentiment as the color.

Our future work includes applying statistical
inference for discovering a hidden structure of
concept-emotion associations. Moreover, auto-
matically identifying the strength of association
between a particular concept and emotions is an-
other task which is more difficult than just iden-
tifying the polarity of the word. We are also in-
terested in using a similar approach to investigate
