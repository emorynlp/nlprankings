Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel representa-
tion for text documents based on aggregating
word embedding vectors into document em-
beddings. Our approach is inspired by the Vec-
tor of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors used
for image representation, and it works as fol-
lows. First, the word embeddings gathered
from a collection of documents are clustered
by k-means in order to learn a codebook of
semnatically-related word embeddings. Each
word embedding is then associated to its near-
est cluster centroid (codeword). The Vec-
tor of Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings
(VLAWE) representation of a document is
then computed by accumulating the differ-
ences between each codeword vector and each
word vector (from the document) associated to
the respective codeword. We plug the VLAWE
representation, which is learned in an unsuper-
vised manner, into a classifier and show that
it is useful for a diverse set of text classifi-
cation tasks. We compare our approach with
a broad range of recent state-of-the-art meth-
ods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our ap-
proach. Furthermore, we obtain a considerable
improvement on the Movie Review data set,
reporting an accuracy of 93.3%, which repre-
sents an absolute gain of 10% over the state-
of-the-art approach. Our code is available at

1 Introduction

In recent years, word embeddings (Bengio et al.,
2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al.,
2013; Pennington et al., 2014) have had a huge
impact in natural language processing (NLP) and
related fields, being used in many tasks includ-
ing sentiment analysis (Dos Santos and Gatti,
2014; Fu et al., 2018), information retrieval (Clin-
chant and Perronnin, 2013; Ye et al., 2016) and
word sense disambiguation (Bhingardive et al.,

2015; Butnaru et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2014; Ia-
cobacci et al., 2016), among many others. Start-
ing from word embeddings, researchers proposed
various ways of aggregating word embedding vec-
tors to obtain efficient sentence-level or document-
level representations (Butnaru and Ionescu, 2017;
Cheng et al., 2018; Clinchant and Perronnin, 2013;
Conneau et al., 2017; Cozma et al., 2018; Fu et al.,
2018; Hill et al., 2016; Kiros et al., 2015; Kusner
et al., 2015; Le and Mikolov, 2014; Shen et al.,
2018; Torki, 2018; Zhao et al., 2015; Zhou et al.,
2016, 2018). Although the mean (or sum) of
word vectors is commonly adopted because of its
simplicity (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), it seems
that more complex approaches usually yield better
performance (Cheng et al., 2018; Conneau et al.,
2017; Cozma et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2018; Hill
et al., 2016; Kiros et al., 2015; Torki, 2018; Zhao
et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016, 2018). To this
end, we propose a simple yet effective approach
for aggregating word embeddings into document
embeddings. Our approach is inspired by the Vec-
tor of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)
(Jégou et al., 2010, 2012) used in computer vision
to efficiently represent images for various image
classification and retrieval tasks. To our knowl-
edge, we are the first to adapt and use VLAD in
the text domain.

Our document-level representation is con-
structed as follows. First, we apply a pre-trained
word embedding model, such as GloVe (Penning-
ton et al., 2014), on all the words from a set of
training documents in order to obtain a set of train-
ing word vectors. The word vectors are clus-
tered by k-means in order to learn a codebook
of semnatically-related word embeddings. Each
word embedding is then associated to its near-
est cluster centroid (codeword). The Vector of
Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE)
representation of a text document is then com-



364

puted by accumulating the differences between
each codeword vector and each word vector that
is both present in the document and associated
to the respective codeword. Since our approach
considers cluster centroids as reference for build-
ing the representation, it can easily accommodate
new words, not seen during k-means training, sim-
ply by associating them to the nearest cluster cen-
troids. Thus, VLAWE is robust to vocabulary dis-
tribution gaps between training and test, which can
appear when the training set is particularly smaller
or from a different domain. Certainly, the robust-
ness holds as long as the word embeddings are pre-
trained on a very large set of documents, e.g. the
entire Wikipedia.

We plug the VLAWE representation, which is
learned in an unsupervised manner, into a classi-
fier, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), and
show that it is useful for a diverse set of text clas-
sification tasks. We consider five benchmark data
sets: Reuters-21578 (Lewis, 1997), RT-2k (Pang
and Lee, 2004), MR (Pang and Lee, 2005), TREC
(Li and Roth, 2002) and Subj (Pang and Lee,
2004). We compare VLAWE with recent state-
of-the-art methods (Butnaru and Ionescu, 2017;
Cheng et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2016;
Iyyer et al., 2015; Kim, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015;
Le and Mikolov, 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Shen et al.,
2018; Torki, 2018; Xue and Zhou, 2009; Zhao
et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016, 2018), demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of our approach. Further-
more, we obtain a considerable improvement on
the Movie Review (MR) data set, surpassing the
state-of-the-art approach of Cheng et al. (2018) by
almost 10%.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We present related works on learning document-
level representations in Section 2. We describe the
Vector of Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings
in Section 3. We present experiments and results
on various text classification tasks in Section 4. Fi-
nally, we draw our conclusion in Section 5.

2 Related Work
There are various works (Butnaru and Ionescu,
2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Conneau et al., 2017;
Fu et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2016; Iyyer et al., 2015;
Kim, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Kusner et al., 2015;
Le and Mikolov, 2014; Clinchant and Perronnin,
2013; Shen et al., 2018; Torki, 2018; Zhao et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2018) that propose to build ef-
fective sentence-level or document-level represen-

tations based on word embeddings. While most
of these approaches are based on deep learning
(Cheng et al., 2018; Conneau et al., 2017; Hill
et al., 2016; Iyyer et al., 2015; Kim, 2014; Kiros
et al., 2015; Le and Mikolov, 2014; Zhao et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2018), there have been some ap-
proaches that are inspired by computer vision re-
search, namely by the bag-of-visual-words (But-
naru and Ionescu, 2017) and by Fisher Vectors
(Clinchant and Perronnin, 2013). The relationship
between the bag-of-visual-words, Fisher Vectors
and VLAD is discussed in (Jégou et al., 2012).
The discussion can be transferred to describe the
relantionship of our work and the closely-related
works of Butnaru and Ionescu (2017) and Clin-
chant and Perronnin (2013).

3 Method
The Vector of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors
(VLAD) (Jégou et al., 2010, 2012) was introduced
in computer vision to efficiently represent images
for various image classification and retrieval tasks.
We propose to adapt the VLAD representation in
order to represent text documents instead of im-
ages. Our adaptation consists of replacing the
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) image
descriptors (Lowe, 2004) useful for recognizing
object patterns in images with word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014)
useful for recognizing semantic patterns in text
documents. We coin the term Vector of Locally-
Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE) for the
resulting document representation.

The VLAWE representation is derived as fol-
lows. First, each word in the collection of training
documents is represented as a word vector using
a pre-trained word embeddings model. The result
is a set X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} of n word vectors.
As for the VLAD model, the next step is to learn a
codebook {µ1, µ2, ..., µk} of representative meta-
word vectors (codewords) using k-means. Each
codeword µi is the centroid of the cluster Ci ⊂ X:

µi =
1

|Ci|
∑
xt∈Ci

xt, ∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}, (1)

where |Ci| is the number of word vectors assigned
to cluster Ci and k is the number of clusters.
Since word embeddings carry semantic informa-
tion by projecting semantically-related words in
the same region of the embedding space, it means
that the resulting clusters contain semantically-



365

related words. The formed centroids are stored in
a randomized forest of k-d trees to reduce search
cost, as described in (Philbin et al., 2007; Ionescu
et al., 2013; Ionescu and Popescu, 2014, 2015a).
Each word embedding xt is associated to a sin-
gle cluster Ci, such that the Euclidean distance
between xt and the corresponding codeword µi is
minimum, for all i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}. For each doc-
ument D and each codeword µi, the differences
xt − µi of the vectors xt ∈ Ci ∩D and the code-
word µi are accumulated into column vectors:

vi,D =
∑

xt∈Ci∩D
xt − µi, (2)

where D ⊂ X is the set of word embeddings in
a given text document. The final VLAWE em-
bedding for a given document D is obtained by
stacking together the d-dimensional residual vec-
tors vi,D, where d is equal to the dimension of the
word embeddings:

φD =


v1,D
v2,D

...
vk,D

 . (3)
Therefore, the VLAWE document embedding is
has k · d components.

The VLAWE vector φD undergoes two normal-
ization steps. First, a power normalization is per-
formed by applying the following operator inde-
pendently on each component (element):

f(z) = sign(z) · |z|α, (4)
where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 and |z| is the absolute value
of z. Since words in natural language follow
the Zipf’s law (Powers, 1998), it seems natural
to apply the power normalization in order to re-
duce the influence of highly frequent words, e.g.
common words or stopwords, which can corrupt
the representation. As Jégou et al. (2012), we
empirically observed that this step consistently
improves the quality of the representation. The
power normalized document embeddings are then
L2-normalized. After obtaining the normalized
VLAWE representations, we employ a classifica-
tion method to learn a discriminative model for
each specific text classification task.

4 Experiments
4.1 Data Sets
We exhibit the performance of VLAWE on five
public data sets: Reuters-21578 (Lewis, 1997),
RT-2k (Pang and Lee, 2004), MR (Pang and Lee,

2005), TREC (Li and Roth, 2002) and Subj (Pang
and Lee, 2004).

The Reuters-21578 data set (Lewis, 1997) con-
tains articles collected from Reuters newswire.
Following Joachims (1998) and Yang and Liu
(1999), we select the categories (topics) that have
at least one document in the training set and one
in the test set, leading to a total of 90 categories.
We use the ModeApte evaluation (Xue and Zhou,
2009), in which unlabeled documents are elimi-
nated, leaving a total of 10787 documents. The
collection is already divided into 7768 documents
for training and 3019 documents for testing.

The RT-2k data set (Pang and Lee, 2004) con-
sists of 2000 movie reviews taken from the IMDB
movie review archives. There are 1000 positive re-
views rated with four or five stars, and 1000 nega-
tive reviews rated with one or two stars. The task
is to discriminate between positive and negative
reviews.

The Movie Review (MR) data set (Pang and
Lee, 2005) consists of 5331 positive and 5331 neg-
ative sentences. Each sentence is selected from
one movie review. The task is to discriminate be-
tween positive and negative sentiment.

TREC (Li and Roth, 2002) is a question type
classification data set, where questions are divided
into 6 classes. The collection is already divided
into 5452 questions for training and 500 questions
for testing.

The Subjectivity (Subj) (Pang and Lee, 2004)
data set contains 5000 objective and 5000 subjec-
tive sentences. The task is to classify a sentence as
being either subjective or objective.

4.2 Evaluation and Implementation Details
In the experiments, we used the pre-trained word
embeddings computed with the GloVe toolkit pro-
vided by Pennington et al. (2014). The pre-trained
GloVe model contains 300-dimensional vectors
for 2.2 million words and phrases. Most of the
steps required for building the VLAWE represen-
tation, such as the k-means clustering and the ran-
domized forest of k-d trees, are implemented using
the VLFeat library (Vedaldi and Fulkerson, 2008).
We set the number of clusters (size of the code-
book) to k = 10, leading to a VLAWE represen-
tation of k · d = 10 · 300 = 3000 components.
Similar to Jégou et al. (2012), we set α = 0.5
for the power normalization step in Equation (4),
which consistently leads to near-optimal results on
all data sets. In the learning stage, we employ the

and Ionescu, 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2016; Iyyer et al., 2015; Kim, 2014; Kiros et al.,
2015; Le and Mikolov, 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Torki, 2018; Xue and Zhou, 2009; Zhao et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2016, 2018) on the Reuters-21578, RT-2k, MR, TREC and Subj data sets.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) implementation
provided by LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011). We
set the SVM regularization parameter to C = 1
in all our experiments. In the SVM, we use the
linear kernel. For optimal results, the VLAWE
representation is combined with the BOSWE rep-
resentation (Butnaru and Ionescu, 2017), which
is based on the PQ kernel (Ionescu and Popescu,
2013, 2015b).

We follow the same evaluation procedure as
Kiros et al. (2015) and Hill et al. (2016), using 10-
fold cross-validation when a train and test split is
not pre-defined for a given data set. As evaluation
metrics, we employ the micro-averaged F1 mea-
sure for the Reuters-21578 data set and the stan-
dard classification accuracy for the RT-2k, the MR,
the TREC and the Subj data sets, in order to fairly
compare with the related art.

4.3 Results

We compare VLAWE with several state-of-the-
art methods (Butnaru and Ionescu, 2017; Cheng
et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2016; Iyyer
et al., 2015; Kim, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Le and
Mikolov, 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018;
Torki, 2018; Xue and Zhou, 2009; Zhao et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2016, 2018) as well as two base-
line methods, namely the average of word embed-
dings and the standard bag-of-words (BOW). The
corresponding results are presented in Table 1.

First, we notice that our approach outperforms
both baselines on all data sets, unlike other related
methods (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Hill et al., 2016).
In most cases, our improvements over the base-
lines are higher than 5%. On the Reuters-21578
data set, we surpass the closely-related approach
of Butnaru and Ionescu (2017) by around 2%. On

the RT-2k data set, we surpass the related works of
Fu et al. (2018) and Butnaru and Ionescu (2017)
by around 4%. To our knowledge, our accuracy of
94.1% on RT-2k (Pang and Lee, 2004) surpasses
all previous results reported in literature. On the
MR data set, we surpass most related works by
more than 10%. To our knowledge, the best ac-
curacy on MR reported in previous literature is
83.6%, and it is obtained by Cheng et al. (2018).
We surpass the accuracy of Cheng et al. (2018) by
almost 10%, reaching an accuracy of 93.3% using
VLAWE. On the TREC data set, we reach the third
best performance, after methods such as (Cheng
et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016, 2018). Our perfor-
mance on TREC is about 2% lower than the state-
of-the-art accuracy of 96.1%. On the Subj data
set, we obtain an accuracy of 95.0%. There are
two state-of-the-art methods (Cheng et al., 2018;
Zhao et al., 2015) reporting better performance on
Subj. Compared to the best one of them (Cheng
et al., 2018), our accuracy is 1% lower. Overall,
we consider that our results are noteworthy.

4.4 Discussion
The k-means clustering algorithm and, on some
data sets, the cross-validation procedure can in-
duce accuracy variations due to the random
choices involved. We have conducted experiments
to determine how large are the accuracy variations.
We observed that the accuracy can decrease by up
to 1%, which does not bring any significant differ-
ences to the results reported in Table 1.

Even for a small number of clusters, e.g. k =
10, the VLAWE document representation can
grow up to thousands of features, as the num-
ber of features is k · d, where d = 300 is the
dimensionality of commonly used word embed-
dings. However, there are several document-level
representations that usually have a dimensionality
much smaller than k · d. Therefore, it is desir-
able to obtain a more compact VLAWE represen-
tation. We hereby propose two approaches that
lead to more compact representations. The first

Figure 1: Accuracy on MR for different numbers of
k-means clusters.

one is simply based on reducing the number of
clusters. By setting k = 2 for instance, we obtain
a 600-dimensional representation. The second one
is based on applying Principal Component Anal-
ysis (PCA), to reduce the dimension of the fea-
ture vectors. Using PCA, we propose to reduce
the size of the VLAWE representation to 300 com-
ponents. In Table 2, the resulting compact repre-
sentations are compared against the full VLAWE
representation on the MR data set. Although the
compact VLAWE representations provide slightly
lower results compared to the VLAWE representa-
tion based on 3000 components, we note that the
differences are insignificant. Furthermore, both
compact VLAWE representations are far above the
state-of-the-art method (Cheng et al., 2018).

In Figure 1, we illustrate the performance varia-
tion on MR, when using different values for k. We
notice that the accuracy tends to increase slightly,
as we increase the number of clusters from 2 to
30. Overall, the VLAWE representation seems to
be robust to the choice of k, always surpassing the
state-of-the-art approach (Cheng et al., 2018).

5 Conclusion

We proposed a novel representation for text docu-
ments which is based on aggregating word embed-
dings using k-means and on computing the resid-
uals between each word embedding allocated to a
given cluster and the corresponding cluster cen-
troid. Our experiments on five benchmark data
sets prove that our approach yields competitive re-
sults with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.
