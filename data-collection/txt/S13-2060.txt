Abstract

In this paper, the UNITOR system participat-
ing in the SemEval-2013 Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter task is presented. The polarity de-
tection of a tweet is modeled as a classifica-
tion task, tackled through a Multiple Kernel
approach. It allows to combine the contribu-
tion of complex kernel functions, such as the
Latent Semantic Kernel and Smoothed Par-
tial Tree Kernel, to implicitly integrate syn-
tactic and lexical information of annotated ex-
amples. In the challenge, UNITOR system
achieves good results, even considering that
no manual feature engineering is performed
and no manually coded resources are em-
ployed. These kernels in-fact embed distri-
butional models of lexical semantics to deter-
mine expressive generalization of tweets.

1 Introduction

Web 2.0 and Social Networks technologies allow
users to generate contents on blogs, forums and new
forms of communication (such as micro-blogging)
writing their opinion about facts, things, events. The
analysis of this information is crucial for companies,
politicians or other users in order to learn what peo-
ple think, and consequently to adjust their strategies.
In such a scenario, the interest in the analysis of the
sentiment expressed by people is rapidly growing.
Twitter1 represents an intriguing source of informa-
tion as it is used to share opinions and sentiments
about brands, products, or situations (Jansen et al.,
2009).

On the other hand, tweet analysis represents a
challenging task for natural language processing
systems. Let us consider the following tweets, evok-
ing a positive (1), and negative (2) polarity, respec-
tively.

@knickfan82 Nooooo ;( they delayed the knicks game

until Monday! (2)

Tweets are short, informal and characterized by
their own particular language with “Twitter syntax”,
e.g. retweets (“RT”), user references (“@”), hash-
tags (“#”) or other typical web abbreviations, such
as emoticons or acronyms.

Classical approaches to sentiment analysis (Pang
et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2008) are not directly ap-
plicable to tweets: most of them focus on relatively
large texts, e.g. movie or product reviews, and per-
formance drops are experimented in tweets scenario.
Some recent works tried to model the sentiment in
tweets (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010;
Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Bifet
and Frank, 2010; Croce and Basili, 2012; Barbosa
and Feng, 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011). Specific ap-
proaches and feature modeling are used to achieve
good accuracy levels in tweet polarity recognition.
For example, the use of n-grams, POS tags, polar-
ity lexicon and tweet specific features (e.g. hash-
tag, retweet) are some of the component exploited
by these works in combination with different ma-
chine learning algorithms (e.g. Naive Bayes (Pak
and Paroubek, 2010), k-NN strategies (Davidov et
al., 2010), SVM and Tree Kernels (Agarwal et al.,
2011)).

In this paper, the UNITOR system participating

369



in the SemEval-2013 Sentiment Analysis in Twit-
ter task (Wilson et al., 2013) models the senti-
ment analysis stage as a classification task. A Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) classifier learns the as-
sociation between short texts and polarity classes
(i.e. positive, negative, neutral). Different kernel
functions (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) have
been used: each kernel aims at capturing specific as-
pects of the semantic similarity between two tweets,
according to syntactic and lexical information. In
particular, in line with the idea of using convolu-
tion tree kernels to model complex semantic tasks,
e.g. (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Moschitti et al., 2008;
Croce et al., 2011), we adopted the Smoothed Par-
tial Tree Kernel (Croce et al., 2011) (SPTK). It is
a state-of-the-art convolution kernel that allows to
measure the similarity between syntactic structures,
which are partially similar and whose nodes can dif-
fer but are nevertheless semantically related. More-
over, a Bag-of-Word and a Latent Semantic Kernel
(Cristianini et al., 2002) are also combined with the
SPTK in a multi-kernel approach.

Our aim is to design a system that exhibits wide
applicability and robustness. This objective is pur-
sued by adopting an approach that avoids the use
of any manually coded resource (e.g. a polarity
lexicon), but mainly exploits distributional analysis
of unlabeled corpora: the generalization of words
meaning is achieved through the construction of a
Word Space (Sahlgren, 2006), which provides an ef-
fective distributional model of lexical semantics.

In the rest of the paper, in Section 2 we will
deeply explain our approach. In Section 3 the re-
sults achieved by our system in the SemEval-2013
challenge are described and discussed.

2 System Description

This section describes the approach behind the
UNITOR system. Tweets pre-processing and lin-
guistic analysis is described in Section 2.1, while the
core modeling is described in 2.2.

2.1 Tweet Preprocessing

Tweets are noisy texts and a pre-processing phase is
required to reduce data sparseness and improve the
generalization capability of the learning algorithms.
The following set of actions is performed before ap-

plying the natural language processing chain:

• fully capitalized words are converted in their
lowercase counterparts;
• reply marks are replaced with the pseudo-token
USER, and POS tag is set to $USR;
• hyperlinks are replaced by the token LINK,

whose POS is $URL;
• hashtags are replaced by the pseudo-token
HASHTAG, whose POS is imposed to $HTG;
• characters consecutively repeated more than

three times are cleaned as they cause high lev-
els of lexical data sparseness (e.g. “nooo!!!!!”
and “nooooo!!!” are both converted into
“noo!!”);
• all emoticons are replaced by SML CLS, where
CLS is an element of a list of classified emoti-
cons (113 emoticons in 13 classes).

For example, the tweet in the example 2 is nor-
malized in ‘user noo sml cry they delayed the knicks
game until monday’. Then, we apply an almost stan-
dard NLP chain with Chaos (Basili and Zanzotto,
2002). In particular, we process each tweet to pro-
duce chunks. We adapt the POS Tagging and Chunk-
ing phases in order to correctly manage the pseudo-
tokens introduced in the normalization step. This is
necessary because tokens like SML SAD are tagged
as nouns, and they influence the chunking quality.

2.2 Modeling Kernel Functions
Following a summary of the employed kernel func-
tions is provided.
Bag of Word Kernel (BOWK) A basic kernel func-
tion that reflects the lexical overlap between tweets.
Each text is represented as a vector whose dimen-
sions correspond to different words. Each dimen-
sion represents a boolean indicator of the presence
or not of a word in the text. The kernel function is
the cosine similarity between vector pairs.
Lexical Semantic Kernel (LSK) A kernel function
is obtained to generalize the lexical information of
tweets, without exploiting any manually coded re-
source. Basic lexical information is obtained by
a co-occurrence Word Space built accordingly to
the methodology described in (Sahlgren, 2006) and
(Croce and Previtali, 2010). A word-by-context ma-
trixM is obtained through a large scale corpus anal-
ysis. Then the Latent Semantic Analysis (Lan-

370



dauer and Dumais, 1997) technique is applied as fol-
lows. The matrix M is decomposed through Singu-
lar Value Decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Kahan,
1965) into the product of three new matrices: U , S,
and V so that S is diagonal and M = USV T . M is
then approximated by Mk = UkSkV Tk , where only
the first k columns of U and V are used, correspond-
ing to the first k greatest singular values. The orig-
inal statistical information about M is captured by
the new k-dimensional space, which preserves the
global structure while removing low-variant dimen-
sions, i.e. distribution noise. The result is that every
word is projected in the reduced Word Space and
an entire tweet is represented by applying an addi-
tive linear combination. Finally, the resulting ker-
nel function is the cosine similarity between vector
pairs, in line with (Cristianini et al., 2002).
Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (SPTK) In order
to exploit the syntactic information of tweets, the
Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel proposed in (Croce et
al., 2011) is adopted. Tree kernels exploit syntactic
similarity through the idea of convolutions among
substructures. Any tree kernel evaluates the number
of common substructures between two trees T1 and
T2 without explicitly considering the whole frag-
ment space. Its general equation is reported here-
after:

TK(T1, T2) =
∑

n1∈NT1

∑
n2∈NT2

∆(n1, n2), (3)

where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of the T1’s and
T2’s nodes, respectively and ∆(n1, n2) is equal to
the number of common fragments rooted in the n1
and n2 nodes. The function ∆ determines the na-
ture of the kernel space. In the SPTK formulation
(Croce et al., 2011) this function emphasizes lexical
nodes. It computes the similarity between lexical
nodes as the similarity between words in the Word
Space. So, this kernel allows a generalization both
from the syntactic and the lexical point of view.

However, tree kernel methods are biased by pars-
ing accuracy and standard NLP parsers suffer accu-
racy loss in this scenario (Foster et al., 2011). It
is mainly due to the complexities of the language
adopted in tweets. In this work, we do not use a
representation that depends on full parse trees. A
syntactic representation derived from tweets chunk-
ing (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) is here
adopted, as shown in Figure 1.

Notice that no explicit manual feature engineering
is applied. On the contrary we expect that discrim-
inative lexical and syntactic information (e.g. nega-
tion) is captured by the kernel in the implicit feature
space, as discussed in (Collins and Duffy, 2001).
A multiple kernel approach Kernel methods are
appealing as they can be integrated in various ma-
chine learning algorithms, such as SVM. Moreover
a combination of kernels is still a kernel function
(Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). We employed
a linear combination αBOWK + βLSK + γSPTK
in order to exploit the lexical properties captured by
BOWK (and generalized by LSK) and the syntac-
tic information of the SPTK. In our experiments, the
kernel weights α, β and γ are set to 1.

3 Results and Discussion

In this section experimental results of the UNITOR
system are reported.

3.1 Experimental setup

In the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task, two
subtasks are defined: Contextual Polarity
Disambiguation (Task A), and Message
Polarity Classification (Task B). The for-
mer deals with the polarity classification (positive,
negative or neutral) of a marked occurrence of a
word or phrase in a tweet context. For example
the adjective “amazing” in example 1 expresses a
positive marked word. The latter deals with the
classification of an entire tweet with respect to
the three classes positive, negative and neutral. In
both subtasks, we computed a fixed (80%-20%)
split of the training data for classifiers parameter
tuning. Tuned parameters are the regularization
parameter and the cost factor (Morik et al., 1999)
of the SVM formulation. The former represents the
trade off between a training error and the margin.
The latter controls the trade off between positive
and negative examples. The learning phase is made
available by an extended version of SVM-LightTK2,
implementing the smooth matching between tree
nodes.

We built a Word Space based on about 1.5 mil-
lion of tweets downloaded during the challenge pe-
riod using the topic name from the trial material as

Figure 1: Chunk-based tree derived from examples (1) and (2)

query terms. We normalized and analyzed tweets as
described in section 2.1. Words occurring more than
100 times in the source corpus are represented as
vectors. The 10, 000 most frequent words in the cor-
pus are considered as contexts and the co-occurrence
scores are measured in a window of size n = ±5.
Vector components are weighted through the Point-
wise Mutual Information (PMI), and dimensional-
ity reduction is applied through SVD with a cut of
k = 250.

The task requires to classify two different texts:
tweets and sms. Sms classification is intended to
verify how well a system can scale on a different
domain. In the testing phase two types of submis-
sions are allowed. Constrained results refer to the
case where systems are trained only with the re-
leased data. Unconstrained results refer to the case
where additional training material is allowed. Eval-
uation metrics adopted to compare systems are Pre-
cision, Recall and F1-Measure. Average F1 of the
positive and negative classes is then used to generate
ranks. Further information about the task is avail-
able in (Wilson et al., 2013).

3.2 Results over Contextual Polarity
Disambiguation

We tackled Task A with a multi-kernel approach
combining the kernel functions described in Section
2.2. The final kernel is computed as the linear com-
bination of the kernels, as shown in Equation 4.

k(t1, t2) = SPTK(φA(t1), φA(t2))

+BOWK(ψA(t1), ψA(t2))

+ LSK(τA(t1), τA(t2)) (4)

where t1, t2 are two tweet examples. The φA(x)
function extracts the 4-level chunk tree from the
tweet x; nodes (except leaves) covering the marked
instance in x are highlighted in the tree with -POL.
The ψA(x) function extracts the vector representing

the Bag-of-Word of the words inside the marked in-
stance of x, while τA builds the LSA vectors of the
words occurring within the marked span of x. Re-
ferring to example 1, both ψA(x) and τA point to
the “amazing” adjective. Finally, k(t1, t2) returns
the similarity between t1 and t2 accordingly to our
modeling. As three polarity classes are considered,
we adopt a multi-classification schema accordingly
to a One-Vs-All strategy (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004):
the final decision function consists in the selection
of the category associated with the maximum SVM
margin.

Table 2: Task A results for the twitter dataset

Tables 1 and 2 report the results of the UNITOR
system in the Task A. Only the constrained set-
ting has been submitted. The performance of the
proposed approach is among the best ones and we
ranked 4th and 7th among about 20 systems.

The system seems to be able to generalize well
from the provided training data, and results are re-
markable, especially considering that no manual an-
notated lexical resources were adopted and no man-
ual feature engineering is exploited. It demonstrates
that a multi-kernel approach, with the proposed shal-
low syntactic representation, is able to correctly
classify the sentiment in out-of-domain contexts too.
Syntax is well captured by the SPTK and the lexical
generalization provided by the Word Space allows
to generalize in the sms scenario.

3.3 Results over Message Polarity
Classification

A multi-kernel approach is adopted for this task too,
as described in the following Equation 5:

k(t1, t2) = SPTK(φB(t1), φB(t2))

+BOWK(ψB(t1), ψB(t2))

+ LSK(τB(t1), τB(t2)) (5)

The φB(x) function extracts a tree representation of
x. In this case no nodes in the trees are marked.
The ψB(x) function extracts Bag-of-Word vectors
for all the words in the tweet x, while τB(x) extracts
the linear combination of vectors in the Word Space
for adjectives, nouns, verbs and special tokens (e.g.
hashtag, smiles) of the words in x. Again, a One-Vs-
All strategy (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004) is applied.
Constrained run. Tables 3 and 4 report the result
in the constrained case. In the sms dataset our sys-
tem suffers more with respect to the tweet one. In
both cases, the system shows a performance drop
on the negative class. It seems that the multi-kernel
approach needs more examples to correctly disam-
biguate elements within this class. Indeed, nega-
tive class cardinality was about 15% of the training
data, while the positive and neutral classes approxi-
mately equally divided the remaining 85%. More-
over, it seems that our system confuses polarized
classes with the neutral one. For example, the tweet
“going Hilton hotel on Thursday for #cantwait” is
classified as neutral (the gold label is positive). In
this case, the hashtag is the sentiment bearer, and
our model is not able to capture this information.

Rank 13/29 class precision recall f1positive .5224 .7358 .6110

Avg-F1 .5122 negative .6019 .3147 .4133neutral .7883 .7798 .7840

Table 4: Task B results for the twitter dataset in the
constrained case

Unconstrained run. In the unconstrained case we
trained our system adding 2000 positive examples
and 2000 negative examples to the provided training
set. These additional tweets were downloaded from
Twitter during the challenge period using positive
and negative emoticons as query terms. The under-
lying hypothesis is that the polarity of the emoticons
can be extended to the tweet (Pak and Paroubek,
2010; Croce and Basili, 2012). In tables 5 and 6
performance measures in this setting are reported.

Rank 10/15 class precision recall f1positive .4337 .7317 .5446

Avg-F1 .4888 negative .3294 .6320 .4330neutral .8524 .3584 .5047

Table 5: Task B results for the sms dataset in the
unconstrained case

Rank 5/15 class precision recall f1positive .7375 .6399 .6853

Avg-F1 .5950 negative .5729 .4509 .5047neutral .6478 .7805 .7080

Table 6: Task B results for the twitter dataset in the
unconstrained case

In this scenario, sms performances are again
lower than the twitter case. This is probably due to
the fact that the sms context is quite different from
the twitter one. This is not true for Task A: polar ex-
pressions are more similar in sms and tweets. Again,
we report a performance drop on the negative class.
However, using more negative tweets seems to be
beneficial. The F1 for this class increased of about
3 points for both datasets. Our approach thus needs
more examples to better generalize from data.

In the future, we should check the redundancy and
novelty of the downloaded material, as early dis-
cussed in (Zanzotto et al., 2011). Moreover, we will
explore the possibility to automatically learn the ker-
nel linear combination coefficients in order to op-
timize the balancing between kernel contributions
(Gönen and Alpaydin, 2011).
