Abstract

Linguistic Steganography is concerned with
hiding information in natural language text.
One of the major transformations used in Lin-
guistic Steganography is synonym substitu-
tion. However, few existing studies have stud-
ied the practical application of this approach.
In this paper we propose two improvements
to the use of synonym substitution for encod-
ing hidden bits of information. First, we use
the Web 1T Google n-gram corpus for check-
ing the applicability of a synonym in context,
and we evaluate this method using data from
the SemEval lexical substitution task. Second,
we address the problem that arises from words
with more than one sense, which creates a po-
tential ambiguity in terms of which bits are
encoded by a particular word. We develop a
novel method in which words are the vertices
in a graph, synonyms are linked by edges, and
the bits assigned to a word are determined by
a vertex colouring algorithm. This method
ensures that each word encodes a unique se-
quence of bits, without cutting out large num-
ber of synonyms, and thus maintaining a rea-
sonable embedding capacity.

1 Introduction

Steganography is concerned with hiding informa-
tion in a cover medium, in order to facilitate covert
communication, such that the presence of the infor-
mation is imperceptible to a user (human or com-
puter). Much of the existing research in steganog-
raphy has used images as cover media; however,
given the ubiquitous nature of electronic text, inter-
est is growing in using natural language as the cover
medium. Linguistic Steganography—lying at the in-

tersection of Computational Linguistics and Com-
puter Security—is concerned with making changes
to a cover text in order to embed information, in such
a way that the changes do not result in ungrammati-
cal or unnatural text.

A related area is natural language watermarking,
in which changes are made to a text in order to iden-
tify it, for example for copyright purposes. An inter-
esting watermarking application is “traitor tracing”,
in which documents are changed in order to embed
individual watermarks. These marks can then be
used to later identify particular documents, for ex-
ample if a set of documents—identical except for
the changes used to embed the watermarks— have
been sent to a group of individuals, and one of the
documents has been leaked to a newspaper.

In terms of security, a linguistic stegosystem
should impose minimum embedding distortion to
the cover text so that the resulting stegotext in which
a message is camouflaged is inconspicuous, result-
ing in high imperceptibility. In addition, since
steganography aims at covert communication, a lin-
guistic stegosystem should allow sufficient embed-
ding capacity, known as the payload. There is a fun-
damental tradeoff between imperceptibility and pay-
load, since any attempt to embed more information
via changes to the cover text increases the chance
of introducing anomalies into the text and therefore
raising the suspicion of an observer.

A linguistic transformation is required to em-
bed information. Transformations studied in pre-
vious work include lexical substitution (Chapman
and Davida, 1997; Bolshakov, 2004; Taskiran et al.,
2006; Topkara et al., 2006b), phrase paraphrasing
(Chang and Clark, 2010), sentence structure manip-
ulations (Atallah et al., 2001a; Atallah et al., 2001b;

Liu et al., 2005; Meral et al., 2007; Murphy, 2001;
Murphy and Vogel, 2007; Topkara et al., 2006a) and
semantic transformations (Atallah et al., 2002; Vy-
bornova and Macq, 2007). Many of these transfor-
mations require some sophisticated NLP tools; for
example, in order to perform semantic transforma-
tions on text, word sense disambiguation, seman-
tic role parsing and anaphora resolution tools may
be required. However, the current state-of-the-art in
language technology is arguably not good enough
for secure linguistic steganography based on sophis-
ticated semantic transformations, and the level of ro-
bustness required to perform practical experiments
has only just become available. Hence many exist-
ing linguistic stegosystems are proof-of-concept im-
plementations with little practical evaluation of the
imperceptibility or payload.

1.1 Synonym substitution

Synonym substitution is a relatively straightforward
linguistic steganography method. It substitutes se-
lected words with the same part of speech (PoS) syn-
onyms, and does not involve operating on the sen-
tence structure so the modification can be guaran-
teed to be grammatical. Another advantage of this
method is that many languages are profuse in syn-
onyms, and so there is a rich source of information
carriers compared with other text transformations.

There are two practical difficulties associated with
hiding bits using synonym subsitution. The first is
that words can have more than one sense. In terms of
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which is the electronic
dictionary we use, words can appear in more than
one synset. This is a problem because a word may be
assigned different bit strings in the different synsets,
and the receiver does not know which of the senses
to use, and hence does not know which hidden bit
string to recover. Our solution to this problem is a
novel vertex colouring method which ensures that
words are always assigned the same bit string, even
when they appear in different synsets.

The second problem is that many synonyms are
only applicable in certain contexts. For example, the
words in the WordNet synset {bridge, span} share
the meaning of “a structure that allows people or ve-
hicles to cross an obstacle such as a river or canal
or railway etc.”. However, bridge and span cannot
be substutited for each other in the sentence “sus-

Figure 1: An example of the basic algorithm

pension bridges are typically ranked by the length
of their main span”, and doing so would likely raise
the suspicion of an observer due to the resulting
anomaly in the text.

Our solution to this problem is to perform a con-
textual check which utilises the Web 1T n-gram
Google n-gram corpus.1 We evaluate the method
using the data from the English Lexical Substitu-
tion task for SemEval-2007.2 The resulting preci-
sion of our lexical substitution system can be seen
as an indirect measure of the imperceptibility of the
stegosystem, whereas the recall can be seen as an
indirect measure of the payload.

The paper is organised so that the contextual
check is described first, and this is evaluated inde-
pendently of the steganographic application. Then
the vertex colouring method is presented, and finally
we show how the contextual check can be integrated
with the vertex colouring coding method to give a
complete stegsosystem. For readers unfamiliar with
linguistic steganogaphy, Section 2 has some exam-
ples of how bits can be hidden using textual trans-
formations. Also, Chang and Clark (2010) is a re-
cent NLP paper which describes the general linguis-
tic steganography framework.

2 Related Work

In the original work on linguistic steganography in
the late 1990s, Winstein proposed an information
hiding algorithm using a block coding method to en-
code synonyms, so that the selection of a word from
a synset directly associates with part of the secret
bitstring (Bergmair, 2007). Figure 1 illustrates the
embedding procedure of this approach. In this ex-
ample, the bitstring to be embedded is 010, which

Figure 2: An example of applying the basic algorithm to
overlapping synsets

can be divided into two codewords, 0 and 10, and the
information carriers in the cover text are the words
finished and project. According to the encoding dic-
tionary, complete represents 0, and task represents
10; hence these words are chosen and replace the
original words in the cover text (with suitable suffix-
ation). The stego sentence “He completed the task”
is then sent to the receiver. In order to recover the
message, the receiver only needs a copy of the en-
coding dictionary, and the decoding algorithm sim-
ply reverses the process used to encode the hidden
bits. Note that the receiver does not need the origi-
nal cover text to recover the information.

This algorithm requires synonym sets to be dis-
joint; i.e. no word may appear in more than one syn-
onym set, since overlapping synsets may cause am-
biguities during the decoding stage. Figure 2 shows
what happens when the basic algorithm is applied to
two overlapping synonym sets. As can be seen from
the example, composition is represented by two dif-
ferent codewords and thus the secret bitstring can-
not be reliably recovered, since the receiver does not
know the original cover word or the sense of the
word. In order to solve this problem, we propose
a novel coding method based on vertex colouring,
described in Section 4.

In addition to the basic algorithm, Winstein pro-
posed the T-Lex system using synonym substitution
as the text transformation. In order to solve the
problem of words appearing in more than one syn-
onym set, Winstein defines interchangeable words
as words that belong to the same synsets, and only
uses these words for substitution. Any words that are
not interchangeable are discarded and not available
for carrying information. The advantage in this ap-
proach is that interchangeable words always receive

the same codeword. The disadvantage is that many
synonyms need to be discarded in order to achieve
this property. Winstein calculates that only 30% of
WordNet can be used in such a system.

Another stegosystem based on synonym substi-
tution was proposed by Bolshakov (2004). In or-
der to ensure both sender and receiver use the
same synsets, Bolshakov applied transitive closure
to overlapping synsets to avoid the decoding ambi-
guity. Applying transitive closure leads to a merger
of all the overlapping synsets into one set which is
then seen as the synset of a target word. Consider
the overlapping synsets in Figure 2 as an example.
After applying transitive closure, the resulting set
is {‘authorship’, ‘composition’, ‘paper’, ‘penning’,
‘report’, ‘theme’, ‘writing’}.

Bolshakov (2004) also uses a method to deter-
mine whether a substitution is applicable in context,
using a collocation-based test. Finally, the colloca-
tionally verified synonyms are encoded by using the
block coding method. This is similar to our use of
the Google n-gram data to check for contextual ap-
plicability.

The disadvantage of Bolshakov’s system is that
all words in a synonym transitive closure chain need
to be considered, which can lead to very large sets
of synonyms, and many which are not synonymous
with the original target word. In contrast, our pro-
posed method operates on the original synonym sets
without extending them unnecessarily.

3 Proposed Method and Experiments

3.1 Resources

We use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to provide sets
of synonyms (synsets) for nouns, verbs, adjectives
and adverbs. Since the purpose of using WordNet is
to find possible substitutes for a target word, those
synsets containing only one entry are not useful and
are ignored by our stegosystem. In addition, our
stegosystem only takes single word substitution into
consideration in order to avoid the confusion of find-
ing information-carrying words during the decoding
phase. For example, if the cover word ‘complete’ is
replaced by ‘all over’, the receiver would not know
whether the secret message is embedded in the word
‘over’ or the phrase ‘all over’. Table 1 shows the
statistics of synsets used in our stegosystem.

Table 1: Statistics of synsets used in our stegosystem

For the contextual check we use the Google Web
1T 5-gram Corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) which
contains counts for n-grams from unigrams through
to five-grams obtained from over 1 trillion word to-
kens of English Web text. The corpus has been used
for many tasks such as spelling correction (Islam and
Inkpen, 2009; Carlson et al., 2008) and multi-word
expression classification (Kummerfeld and Curran,
2008). Moreover, for the SemEval-2007 English
Lexical Substitution Task, which is similar to our
substitution task, six out of ten participating teams
utilised the Web 1T corpus.

3.2 Synonym Checking Method

In order to measure the degree of acceptability in a
substitution, the proposed filter calculates a substi-
tution score for a synonym by using the observed
frequency counts in the Web n-gram corpus. The
method first extracts contextual n-grams around the
synonym and queries the n-gram frequency counts
from the corpus. For each n, the total count fn is cal-
culated by summing up individual n-gram frequen-
cies, for every contextual n-gram containing the tar-
get word. We define a count function Count(w) =∑5

n=2 log(fn) where log(0) is defined as zero. If
Count(w) = 0, we assume the word w is unrelated
to the context and therefore is eliminated from con-
sideration. We then find the maximum Count(w)
called max from the remaining words. The main
purpose of having max is to score each word rela-
tive to the most likely synonym in the group, so even
in less frequent contexts which lead to smaller fre-
quency counts, the score of each synonym can still
indicate the degree of feasibility. The substitution
score is defined as Score(w) = Count(w)÷max.
The hypothesis is that a word with a high score is
more suitable for the context, and we apply a thresh-
old so that synonyms having a score lower than the
threshold are discarded.

Figure 3 demonstrates an example of calculat-

f2=525,856 high pole 3,544
pole . 522,312

f3=554 very high pole 84
high pole . 470

f4=72 a very high pole 72
very high pole . 0

f5=0 not a very high pole 0
a very high pole . 0

Count(‘pole’)=log(f2)+log(f3)+log(f4)+log(f5)=23
Score(‘pole’)=Count(‘pole’)/max=0.44>0.37

Figure 3: An example of using the proposed synonym
checking method

ing the substitution score for the synonym ‘pole’
given the cover sentence “This is not a very high
bar.” First of all, various contextual n-grams are ex-
tracted from the sentence and the Web n-gram cor-
pus is consulted to obtain their frequency counts.
Count(‘pole’) is then calculated using the n-gram
frequencies. Suppose the threshold is 0.37, and the
max score is 52. Since Count(‘pole’) is greater
than zero and the substitution score Score(‘pole’)
is 0.44, the word ‘pole’ is determined as acceptable
for this context (even though it may not be, depend-
ing on the meaning of ‘bar’ in this case).

3.3 Evaluation Data

In order to evaluate the proposed synonym check-
ing method, we need some data to test whether our
method can pick out acceptable substitutions. The
English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval-2007
has created human-annotated data for developing
systems that can automatically find feasible substi-
tutes given a target word in context. This data com-
prises 2010 sentences selected from the English In-
ternet Corpus3, and consists of 201 words: nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs each with ten sen-
tences containing that word. The five annotators
were asked to provide up to three substitutes for a
target word in the context of a sentence, and were
permitted to consult a dictionary or thesaurus of
their choosing.

We use the sentences in this gold standard as the
cover text in our experiments so that the substi-
tutes provided by the annotators can be the positive
data for evaluating the proposed synonym check-

ing methods. Since we only take into considera-
tion the single word substitutions for the reason de-
scribed earlier, multi-word substitutes are removed
from the positive data. Moreover, we use Word-
Net as the source of providing candidate substitutes
in our stegosystem, so if a human-provided sub-
stitute does not appear in any synsets of its target
word in WordNet, there is no chance for our sys-
tem to replace the target word with the substitute and
therefore, the substitute can be eliminated. Table 2
presents the statistics of the positive data for our ex-
periments.

Apart from positive data, we also need some neg-
ative data to test whether our method has the ability
to filter out bad substitutions. Since the annotators
were allowed to refer to a dictionary or thesaurus,
we assume that annotators used WordNet as one of
the reference resources while generating candidates.
Hence we assume that, if a word in the correct synset
for a target word is not in the set produced by the hu-
man annotators, then it is inappropriate for that con-
text and a suitable negative example. This method is
appropriate because our steganography system has
to distinguish between good and bad synonyms from
WordNet, given a particular context.

For the above reasons, we extract the negative
data for our experiments by first matching positive
substitutes of a target word to all the synsets that
contain the target word in WordNet. The synset
that includes the most positive substitutes is used
to represent the meaning of the target word. If
there is more than one synset containing the high-
est number of positives, all the synsets are taken
into consideration. We then randomly select up to
six single-word synonyms other than positive substi-
tutes from the chosen synset(s) as negative instances
of the target word. Figure 4 shows an example of
automatically collected negative data from WordNet
given a target word and its positive substitutes. The
synset {‘remainder’, ‘balance’, ‘residual’, ‘residue’,

Table 3: Annotation results for negative data

‘residuum’, ‘rest’} is selected for negative data col-
lection since it contains one of the positives while
the other synsets do not. We assume the selected
synset represents the meaning of the original word,
and those synonyms in the synset which are not an-
notated as positives must have a certain degree of
mismatch to the context. Therefore, from this exam-
ple, ‘balance’, ‘residue’, ‘residuum’ and ‘rest’ are
extracted as negatives to test whether our synonym
checking method can pick out bad substitutions from
a set of words sharing similar or the same meaning.

In order to examine whether the automatically
collected instances are true negatives and hence
form a useful test set, a sample of automatically gen-
erated negatives was selected for human evaluation.
For each PoS one sentence of each different target
word is selected, which results in roughly 13% of
the collected negative data, and every negative sub-
stitute of the selected sentences was judged by the
second author. As can be seen from the annota-
tion results shown in Table 3, most of the instances
are true negatives, and only a few cases are incor-
rectly chosen as false negatives. Since the main pur-
pose of the data set is to test whether the proposed
synonym checking method can guard against inap-
propriate synonym substitutions and be integrated
in the stegosystem, it is reasonable to have a few
false negatives in our experimental data. Also, it
is more harmless to rule out a permissible substitu-

the statistics of the automatically collected negative
data for our experiments.

Note that, although we use the data from the lex-
ical substitution task, our task is different: the pos-
sible substitutions for a target word need to be fixed
in advance for linguistic steganography (in order for
the receiver to be able to recover the hidden bits),
whereas for the lexical substitution task participants
were asked to discover possible replacements.

3.4 Results

The performance of the proposed checking method
is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall
and balanced F-measure. Accuracy represents the
percentage of correct judgements over all accept-
able and unacceptable substitutions. Precision is the
percentage of substitutions judged acceptable by the
method which are determined to be suitable syn-
onyms by the human judges. Recall is the percent-
age of substitutions determined to be feasible by the
human annotators which are also judged acceptable
by the method. The interpretation of the measures
for a stegosystem is that a higher precision value im-
plies a better security level since good substitutions
are less likely to be seen as suspicious by the ob-
server; whereas a larger recall value means a greater
payload capacity since words are being substituted
where possible and therefore embedding as much in-
formation as possible.

In order to derive sensible threshold values for
each PoS, 5-fold cross-validation was implemented
to conduct the experiments. For each fold, 80% of
the data is used to find the threshold value which
maximises the accuracy, and that threshold is then
applied to the remaining 20% to get the final result.
Table 4 gives the results for the synonym checking
method and the average threshold values over the 5
folds. In addition, we are interested in the effect of

Figure 5: System performance under various thresholds

various thresholds on the system performance. Fig-
ure 5 shows the precision and recall values with re-
spect to different thresholds for each PoS. From the
graphs we can clearly see the trade-off between pre-
cision and recall. Although a higher precision can
be achieved by using a higher threshold value, for
example noun’s substitutions almost reach 90% pre-
cision with threshold equal to 0.9, the large drop in
recall means many applicable synonyms are being
eliminated. In other words, the trade-off between
precision and recall implies the trade-off between
imperceptibility and payload capacity for linguistic
steganography. Therefore, the practical threshold
setting would depend on how steganography users
want to trade off imperceptibility for payload.

4 Proposed Stegosystem

4.1 The Vertex Coloring Coding Method

In this section, we propose a novel coding method
based on vertex colouring by which each synonym is
assigned a unique codeword so the usage of overlap-
ping synsets is not problematic for data embedding
and extracting. A vertex colouring is a labelling of
the graph’s vertices with colours subject to the con-
dition that no two adjacent vertices share the same
colour. The smallest number of colours required
to colour a graph G is called its chromatic num-
ber χ(G), and a graph G having chromatic number
χ(G) = k is called a k-chromatic graph. The main
idea of the proposed coding method is to represent
overlapping synsets as an undirected k-chromatic
graph called a synonym graph which has a vertex
for each word and an edge for every pair of words
that share the same meaning. A synonym is then
encoded by a codeword that represents the colour
assigned by the vertex colouring of the synonym
graph. Figure 6 shows the use of four different
colours, represented by ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’ and ‘11’, to
colour the 4-chromatic synonym graph of the two
overlapping synsets in Figure 2. Now, the over-
lapped word ‘composition’ receives a unique code-
word no matter which synset is considered, which
means the replacement of ‘paper’ to ‘composition’
in Figure 2 will not cause an ambiguity since the re-
ceiver can apply the same coding method to derive
identical codewords used by the sender.

99.6% of synsets in WordNet have size less than
8, which means most of the synsets cannot exhaust
more than a 2-bit coding space (i.e. we can only
encode at most 2 bits using a typical synset). There-
fore, we restrict the chromatic number of a synonym
graph G to 1 < χ(G) ≤ 4, which implies the max-
imum size of a synset is 4. When χ(G) = 2, each

Figure 7: Examples of 2,3,4-chromatic synonym graphs

vertex is assigned a single-bit codeword either ‘0’
or ‘1’ as shown in Figure 7(a). When χ(G) = 3,
the overlapping set’s size is either 2 or 3, which can-
not exhaust the 2-bit coding space although code-
words ‘00’, ‘01’ and ‘10’ are initially assigned to
each vertex. Therefore, only the most significant
bits are used to represent the synonyms, which we
call codeword reduction. After the codeword reduc-
tion, if a vertex has the same codeword, say ‘0’, as
all of its neighbors, the vertex’s codeword must be
changed to ‘1’ so that the vertex would be able to ac-
commodate either secret bit ‘0’ or ‘1’, which we call
codeword correction. Figure 7(b) shows an example
of the process of codeword reduction and codeword
correction for χ(G) = 3. For the case of χ(G) = 4,
codeword reduction is applied to those vertices that
themselves or their neighboring vertices have no ac-
cess to all the codewords ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’ and ‘11’.
For example, vertices a, b, c, e and f in Figure 7(c)
meet the requirement of needing codeword reduc-
tion. The codeword correction process is then fur-
ther applied to vertex f to rectify its accessibility.

1200



Figure 8 describes a greedy algorithm for con-
structing a coded synonym graph using at most
4 colours, given n synonyms w1, w2,. . . , wn in
the overlapping synsets. Let us define a function
E(wi, wj) which returns an edge between wi and
wj if wi and wj are in the same synset; otherwise
returns false. Another function C(wi) returns the
colour of the synonym wi. The procedure loops
through all the input synonyms. For each iteration,
the procedure first finds available colours for the tar-
get synonym wi. If there is no colour available,
namely all the four colours have already been given
to wi’s neighbors, wi is randomly assigned one of
the four colours; otherwise, wi is assigned one of
the available colours. After adding wi to the graph
G, the procedure checks whether adding an edge of
wi to graph G would violate the vertex colouring.
After constructing the coloured graph, codeword re-
duction and codeword correction as previously de-
scribed are applied to revise improper codewords.

4.2 Proposed Lexical Stegosystem

Figure 9 illustrates the framework of our lexical
stegosystem. Note that we have preprocessed Word-
Net by excluding multi-word synonyms and single-
entry synsets. A possible information carrier is first
found in the cover sentence. We define a possi-
ble information carrier as a word in the cover sen-
tence that belongs to at least one synset in Word-
Net. The synsets containing the target word, and all
other synsets which can be reached via the synonym
relation, are then extracted from WordNet (i.e. we
build the connected component of WordNet which
contains the target word according to the synonym
relation). Words in these sets are then examined
by the Google n-gram contextual checking method
to eliminate inappropriate substitutions. If there is
more than one word left and if words which pass the
filter all belong to the same synset, the block cod-
ing method is used to encode the words; otherwise
the vertex colouring coding is applied. Finally, ac-
cording to the secret bitstring, the system selects the
synonym that shares an edge with the target word
and has as its codeword the longest potential match
with the secret bitstring.

We use the connected component of WordNet
containing the target word as a simple method to en-
sure that both sender and receiver colour-code the

same graph. It is important to note, however, that
the sender only considers the synonyms of the target
word as potential substitutes; the connected compo-
nent is only used to consistently assign the codes.

For the decoding process, the receiver does not
need the original text for extracting secret data. An
information carrier can be found in the stegotext by
referring to WordNet in which related synonyms are
extracted. Those words in the related sets undergo
the synonym checking method and then are encoded
by either block coding or vertex colouring coding
scheme depending on whether the remaining words
are in the same synset. Finally, the secret bitstring is
implicit in the codeword of the information carrier
and therefore can be extracted.

We demonstrate how to embed secret bit 1 in the

sentence “it is a shame that we could not reach the
next stage.” A possible information carrier ‘shame’
is first found in the sentence. Table 5 lists the re-
lated synsets extracted from WordNet. The score
of each word calculated by the synonym checking
method using the Web 1T Corpus is given as a sub-
script. Assume the threshold score is 0.27. The out-
put of the synonym checking method is shown at the
right side of Table 5. Since the remaining words do
not belong to the same synset, the vertex colouring
coding method is then used to encode the words.
Figure 10(a) is the original synset graph in which
each vertex is assigned one of the four colours; Fig-
ure 10(b) is the graph after applying codeword re-
duction. Although both ‘disgrace’ and ‘pity’ are en-
coded by ‘1’, ‘pity’ is chosen to replace the cover
word since it has a higher score. Finally, the stego-
text is generated, “it is a pity that we could not reach
the next stage.”

As a rough guide to the potential payload with
this approach, we estimate that, with a threshold of
0.5 for the contextual check, the payload would be
slightly higher than 1 bit per newspaper sentence.

5 Conclusions

One of the contributions of this paper is to develop a
novel lexical stegosystem based on vertex colouring

cover sentence:
It is a shame that we could not reach the next stage
original synsets retained synsets
{commiseration.28, {commiseration,
pity.97, ruth.13, pathos.31} pity, pathos}
{pity.97, shame1} {pity, shame}
{compassion.49, pity.97} {compassion, pity}
{condolence.27, {commiseration}
commiseration.28} {pathos, poignancy}
{pathos.31, poignancy.31} {shame, disgrace}
{shame1, disgrace.84, {compassion}
ignominy.24} {poignancy}
{compassion.49,
compassionateness0}
{poignance.12,
poignancy.31}

coding which improves the data embedding capacity
compared to existing systems. The vertex colouring
coding method represents synonym substitution as a
synonym graph so the relations between words can
be clearly observed. In addition, an automatic sys-
tem for checking synonym acceptability in context is
integrated in our stegosystem to ensure information
security. For future work, we would like to explore
more linguistic transformations that can meet the re-
quirements of linguistic steganography — retaining
the meaning, grammaticality and style of the origi-
nal text. In addition, it is crucial to have a full eval-
uation of the linguistic stegosystem in terms of im-
perceptibility and payload capacity so we can know
how much data can be embedded before the cover
text reaches its maximum distortion which is toler-
ated by a human judge.
