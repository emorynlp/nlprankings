Abstract 

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the formal language in most Arabic countries. Ara-
bic Dialects (AD) or daily language differs from MSA especially in social media 
communication. However, most Arabic social media texts have mixed forms and many 
variations especially between MSA and AD. This paper aims to bridge the gap be-
tween MSA and AD by providing a framework for the translation of texts of social 
media. More precisely, this paper focuses on the Tunisian Dialect of Arabic (TAD) 
with an application on automatic machine translation for a social media text into MSA 
and any other target language. Linguistic tools such as a bilingual TAD-MSA lexicon 
and a set of grammatical mapping rules are collaboratively constructed and exploited 
in addition to a language model to produce MSA sentences of Tunisian dialectal sen-
tences. This work is a first-step towards collaboratively constructed semantic and lexi-
cal resources for Arabic Social Media within the ASMAT (Arabic Social Media Anal-
ysis Tools) project. 

 

1 Introduction 
The explosive growth of social media has led to a wide range of new challenges for machine transla-
tion and language processing. The language used in social media occupies a new space between struc-
tured and unstructured media, formal and informal language, and dialect and standard usage. Yet these 
new platforms have given a digital voice to millions of user on the Internet, giving them the opportuni-
ty to communicate on the first truly global stage – the Internet (Colbath, 2012). 

Social media poses three major computational challenges, dubbed by Gartner the 3Vs of big data: 
volume, velocity, and variety1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, in particular, face further 
difficulties arising from the short, noisy, and strongly contextualised nature of social media. In order to 
address the 3Vs of social media, new language technologies have emerged, such as the identification 
and definition of users' language varieties and the translation to a different language, than the source.

Furthermore, language in social media is very rich with linguistic innovations, morphology and lexical 
changes. People are not only socially connected across the world but also emotionally and linguistical-
ly (Sadat, 2013).  

The importance of social media stems from the fact that the use of social networks has made every-
body a potential author, which means that the language is now closer to the user than to any prescribed 
norms. Thus, considerable interest has recently been focused on the analysis of social media in order 
to create or enrich NLP tools and applications. There are, however, still many challenges to be faced 
depending on the used language and its variants.  

This paper deal with Arabic language and its variants for the analysis of social media and the col-
laborative construction of linguistic tools, such as lexical dictionaries and grammars and their exploita-
tion in NLP applications, such as translation technologies.  

Basically, Arabic is considered as morphologically rich and complex language, which presents sig-
nificant challenges for NLP and its applications. It is the official language in 22 countries spoken by 
more than 350 million people around the world2. Moreover, Arabic language exists in a state of di-
glossia where the standard form of the language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the regional 
dialects (AD) live side-by-side and are closely related (Elfardy and Diab, 2013). Arabic has more than 
22 variants, refereed a as dialects; some countries share the same dialects, while many dialects may 
exist alongside MSA within the same Arab country. Arabic Dialects (AD) or daily language differs 
from MSA especially in social media communication. However, most Arabic social media texts have 
mixed forms and many variations especially between MSA and AD. 

This paper describes our efforts to create linguistic resources and translation tool for TDA to MSA. 
First, a bilingual TDA-MSA lexicon and a set of TDA mapping rules for the social media context are 
collaboratively constructed. Second, these tools are exploited in addition to a language model extract-
ed from MSA corpus, to produce MSA sentences of the Tunisian dialectal sentences of social media. 
The rule-based translation system can be coupled with a statistical machine translation system from 
MSA into any language, example French or English to provide a translation from TDA to French or 
English of original Tunisian dialectal sentences of social media. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some related works to this research. 
Section 3 discusses the Tunisian Dialect of Arabic  (TDA) and its challenges in social media context. 
In Section 4, we present the collaboratively construct linguistic tools for the social media. Section 5 
presents some evaluations of the combined TDA-MSA rule-based translation and disambiguation sys-
tem. Section 6 concludes this paper and gives some future extensions. 

2 Related Work 
There have been several works on Arabic NLP. However, most traditional techniques have focused on 
MSA, since it is understood across a wide spectrum of audience in the Arab world and is widely used 
in the spoken and written media. Few works relate the processing of dialectal Arabic that is different 
from processing MSA. First, dialects leverage different subsets of MSA vocabulary, introduce 
different new vocabulary that are more based on the geographical location and culture, exhibit distinct 
grammatical rules, and adds new morphologies to the words. The gap between MSA and Arabic dia-
lects has affected morphology, word order, and vocabulary (Kirchhoff  and Vergyri, 2004). Almeman 
and Lee (2013) have shown in their work that only 10% of words (uni-gram) share between MSA and 
dialects. Second, one of the challenges for Arabic NLP applications is the mixture usage of both AD 
and MSA within the same text in social media context.  Recently, research groups have started 
focusing on dialects. For instance, Columbia University provides a morphological analyzer 
(MAGEAD) for Levantine verbs and assumes the input is non-noisy and purely Levantine (Habash 
and Rambow, 2006b). 

Given that DA and MSA do not have much in terms of parallel corpora, rule-based methods to 
translate DA-to-MSA or other methods to collect word-pair lists have been explored. Abo Bakr et al. 
(2008) introduced a hybrid approach to translate a sentence from Egyptian Arabic into MSA. This hy-
brid system consists of a statistical system for tokenizing and tagging, and a rule-based system for the 
construction of diacritized MSA sentences. Al-Sabbagh and Girju (2010) described an approach of

mining the web to build a DA-to-MSA lexicon. Salloum and Habash (2012) developed Elissa, a dia-
lectal to standard Arabic tool that employs a rule-based translation approach and relies on morphologi-
cal analysis, morphological transfer rules and dictionaries in addition to language models to produce 
MSA paraphrases of dialectal sentences. 

Using closely related languages has been shown to improve MT quality when resources are limited. 
In the context of Arabic dialect translation, Sawaf (2010) built a hybrid MT system that uses both sta-
tistical and rule-based approaches for DA-to-English MT. In his approach, DA (but not TDA) is nor-
malized into MSA by performing a combination of character- and morpheme-level mappings. They 
then translated the normalized source to English using a hybrid MT or alternatively a Statistical MT 
system.  

Very few researches were reported on Tunisian variant of Arabic or any other Maghrebi variant. 
Hamdi et al. (2013) presented a translation system between MSA TDA verbal forms. Their approach 
relies on modeling the translation process over the deep morphological representations of roots and 
patterns, commonly used to model Semitic morphology. The reported results are aat 80% recall in the 
TDA into MSA and 84% recall in the opposite direction. However, the translation process was highly 
ambiguous, and a contextual disambiguation process was therefore necessary for such a process to be 
of practical use. Boudjelbene et al. (2013a, 2013b) described a method for building a bilingual diction-
ary using explicit knowledge about the relation between TDA and MSA and presented an automatic 
process for creating Tunisian Dialect corpora. However, their work focused on verbs mainly in order 
to adapt MAGEAD morphological analyser and generator of arabic dialect to TDA (Hamdi et al., 
2013). Also, they developed a tool that generates TDA corpora and enrich semi-automatically the dic-
tionaries they built. Experiments in progress showed that the integration of translated data improves 
lexical coverage and the perplexity of language models significantly. Their research was very pertinent 
for TDA but did not consider the mixture form of social media corpora.  

Shaalan (2010) presented a rule-based approach for Arabic NLP and developed a transfer-based 
machine translation system of English noun phrase to Arabic. Their research showed that a rapid de-
velopment of rule-based systems is feasible, especially in the absence of linguistic resources and the 
difficulties faced in adapting tools from other languages due to peculiarities an the nature of Arabic 
language.  

In real-life practise, a company named Qordoba3 launched social media translation service for Ara-
bic in general. However, no demonstration or freely available version was found online. Furthermore, 
a new Twitter service automatically translates tweets from some Arabic language variants to English. 
However, this translation tool is not 100% accurate4. 

3 The Tunisian Dialect of Arabic and its Challenges in Social Media 
Tunisian, or Tunisian Arabic5 (TDA) is a Maghrebi dialect of the Arabic language, spoken by some 11 
million people in coastal Tunisia. It is usually known by its own speakers as Derja, which means dia-
lect, to distinguish it from Standard Arabic, or as Tunsi, which means Tunisian. In the interior of the 
country it merges, as part of a dialect continuum, into Algerian Arabic and Libyan Arabic. 

The morphology, syntax, pronunciation and vocabulary of Tunisian Arabic are quite different 
from Standard or Classical Arabic. TDA, like other Maghrebi dialects, has a vocabulary mostly Ara-
bic, with significant Berber substrates, and many words and loanwords borrowed 
from Berber, French, Turkish, Italian and Spanish. Derja is mutually spoken and understood in the 
Maghreb countries, especially Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, but hard to understand for middle east-
ern Arabic speakers. It continues to evolve by integrating new French or English words, notably in 
technical fields, or by replacing old French and Spanish ones with Standard Arabic words within some 
circles. Moreover, Tunisian is also closely related to Maltese, which is not considered to be a dialect of 
Arabic for sociolinguistic reasons.  

An exemple is the following sentences in Tunisian Dialect of Arabic (TDA) in social media, as pre-
sented in Figure 1. The underlined words (also in red) cannot be analyzable by MSA morphological 
analyzers, and thus need their own TDA analysis. Moreover, there are some words (in blue) expressed

in languages other than Arabic, French in this case. At least three morphological tools are needed for 
this short text that is very common in social media. 

It is often assumed that for the country in question, users of social media will use mostly if not al-
ways, the native language. However, this isn’t always the case. Languages will be mixed up with up to 
three languages in a single “tweet” or blog. A Tunisian user of social media can involve the following 
languages or their variants: 1) native tongue (Arabic dialect), 2) MSA (example for greetings), 3) Eng-
lish and 4) the Colonial country’s language, which is French in our case. In the case of Tunisian, 
French words/numbers may be used that sound like an Arabic word. An accurate machine translation 
for social media should manage this level of complexity, especially when ones add numerical charac-
ters and an ever-changing Lexicon of words.

4 Collaboratively Constructed Linguistic Tools for TDA  
This section describes our effort in collaboratively constructing some linguitic tools that help translate 
Tunisian text of social media into MSA and other target languages considering MSA as a pivot 
language. Among these tools, a bilingual TDA-MSA lexicon and a set of mapping rules that will be 
integrated in the rule-based translation system (TDA-into-MSA). Furthermore, a language Modeling 
of MSA will help disambiguate the many translation hypothesis and thus select the best phrasal 
translation in MSA.

4.1 The TDA-MSA Bilingual Lexicon  
We have manually and collaboratively developed a bilingual TDA-MSA lexicon that contains 

around 1,600 source words in TDA and its corresponding translations in MSA, defined by a human 
expert. Furthermore, our research on some downloadded extracts from Tunisian blogs (around 6,000 
words), showed a difference between verb morphology in TDA and that in MSA. We find that in 
TDA, the gender distinction is not marked. Similarly, we noticed the absence of the masculine and 
feminine dual in TDA.   

In this phase, our aim was to build a bilingual lexicon of Tunisian nouns and verbs and their 
translations into MSA. Note that a term can be a noun, a verb, an adverb, etc. Furthermore, the most 
used imported words from other language than Arabic (Berbere, French, English, Turkish, Spanish, 
Maltese) and used in social media context were considered in this lexicon.  These TDA-MSA couples 
are stored in an XML database. Figure 2 shows a bilingual TDA-MSA extract from the lexicon 
database, encoded in XML. 

4.2 Grammatical Mapping Rules for TDA  
Our second collaboratively constructed linguistic tool, consists on a set of mapping rules that were 
checked by human experts. This set consists of some rules applied on verbs transformation in TDA 
and their corresponding translation into MSA. In final, we have defined a set of 226 mapping rules 
from TDA into MSA on verbs transformation. Figure 3 shows an extract of the defined rules, encoded 
in XML. Figure 4 shows an example of a verb in TDA and its translation ito MSA using rule number 
171 of the collaboratively built set of mapping rules. 

4.3 Automatic Rule-based TDA-MSA Machine Translation  
We have developed a rule-based translation system that is able to translate any social media text in 
TDA into MSA. This rule-based translation system can be coupled with any statistical machine trans-
lation system from MSA to another language to provide a translation of original Tunisian dialectal 
sentences of social media from TDA to that other language.  

Figure 5 shows the different steps used in the translation of any social media text from TDA into 
MSA. First, for each word in the TDA social media text, we proceed by searching in the TDA-MSA 
lexicon database for the corresponding translation of the TDA word. Mostly, TDA nouns and imported 
words from other languages than Arabic were included in the lexicon.  Second, we proceed by search-
ing in the database of mapping rules for the source verb in TDA and its corresponding MSA transla-
tion, as shown in Figure 4. Last, both word-by-word translation candidates are extracted from the lexi-
cons and using the set of mapping rules; thus considered as translation hypothesis.

4.4 Language Modeling  
The rule-based translation system is based on a word-by-word translation using the bilingual lexicon 
and the set of mapping rules. Thus, most of the time, one TDA sentence will have more than one pos-
sible translation. The language modeling (LM) of the target language (MSA) combined to the previous 
rule-based translation system will help disambiguate and select the best translation hypothesis in 
MSA.

5 Evaluations  
We have carried out some experiments and evaluations on the accuracy of the translation of TDA so-
cial media texts into MSA. 

First, we collected manually a TDA corpus consisting of 6,000 words from some Tunisian forums 
and blogs. This corpus is very heterogeneous and multilingual, as many words are not in TDA but in 
MSA, French, English and sometimes using a certain style and form of social media, example using 
tweeter or SMS slangs). An extract of this corpus is presented in Figure 1. 

107



For evaluation purposes, we considered a reference set of 50 phrases in TDA, translated manually 
into MSA. We also considered these 50 TDA phrases as the test set. Thus, we applied the proposed 
rule-based approach on this test set. 

In order to combine adequately the rule-based translation approach to the language modeling (in 
MSA), we considered using the United Nation Arabic corpus to train a trigram language model. This 
training corpus contains around 50M words after cleaning the Latin content.  

A preprocessing step is very crucial to any Arabic language processing. We considered tokenizing 
the MSA words using the D3 (Habash and Sadat, 2006a) scheme to overcome all problems of aggluti-
nation. The D3 scheme splits off clitics as follows: the class of conjunction clitics (w+ and f+), the 
class of particles (l+, k+, b+ and s+), the definite article (Al+) and all pronominal enclitics. These pre-
processing are applied for both the hypothesis translation sentences and the training corpus, both in 
MSA. In addition to this preprocessing step, manual cleaning the MSA corpus of Latin contents was 
required. Thus, a trigram language model was implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) 
on this training MSA corpus.  

Next, we extracted all possible trigrams from the preprocessed MSA hypotheses translations and we 
computed the probability that these trigrams extracted appear in the MSA corpus based on the lan-
guage model. A probability for each hypothesis translation is computed based on a trigram language 
model (LM). The hypothesis translation that has the highest probability is considered as the best trans-
lation. 

Evaluations of the best translation sentence from TDA to MSA against the reference sentence in 
MSA were completed using the BLEU metric for automatic machine translation (Papineni et al., 
2002). Our experiment produced a score of 14.32 BLEU. This low score could be related to our rule-
based translation approach that is word-based and to the high number of unknown words in our source 
test file in other language variants than TDA. Adopting a phrasal translation and solving the problem 
of unknown words should be more effective. 

Unfortunately, we could not found an available TDA-MSA test and reference files to conduct better 
evaluations in machine translation and social media context.    

6 Conclusion and Future Work 
Social media has become a key communication tool for people around the world. Building any NLP 
tool for texts extracted from social media is very challenging and daunting task and always be limited 
by the rapid changes in the social media. Considering an Arabic social media text is much more chal-
lenging because of the dominant use of English, French and other languages which intend to bring 
more problems to solve. 

This paper presents our effort to create linguistic resources such as a bilingual lexicon, a set of 
grammatical mapping rule and a ruel-based translation and disambiguation system for the translation 
of any social media text from TDA into MSA. A language modeling of MSA is used in the 
disambiguation phase and the selection of  the best translation phrase. 

As for future work, we intend to enlarge the set of words in the TDA-MSA lexicon as well as the 
set of mapping rules. We intend to develop more grammatical rules for not only verbs but also adjec-
tives and nouns. Furthermore, it would be interesting to build a parallel or comparable TDA-MSA 
corpus by selecting the most pertinent sources of social media and mining the web. A phrase-based 
statistical machine translation can be built using this parallel/comparable corpus and coupled to the 
rule-based translation system.  

What we presented in this draft is a research on exploiting social media corpora for Arabic in order 
to analyze them and exploit them for NLP applications, such as machine translation within the scope 
of the ASMAT project.
