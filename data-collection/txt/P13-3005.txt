Abstract

In this paper we focus on practical is-
sues of data representation for dependency
parsing. We carry out an experimental
comparison of (a) three syntactic depen-
dency schemes; (b) three data-driven de-
pendency parsers; and (c) the influence of
two different approaches to lexical cate-
gory disambiguation (aka tagging) prior to
parsing. Comparing parsing accuracies in
various setups, we study the interactions
of these three aspects and analyze which
configurations are easier to learn for a de-
pendency parser.

1 Introduction

Dependency parsing is one of the mainstream re-
search areas in natural language processing. De-
pendency representations are useful for a number
of NLP applications, for example, machine trans-
lation (Ding and Palmer, 2005), information ex-
traction (Yakushiji et al., 2006), analysis of ty-
pologically diverse languages (Bunt et al., 2010)
and parser stacking (Øvrelid et al., 2009). There
were several shared tasks organized on depen-
dency parsing (CoNLL 2006–2007) and labeled
dependencies (CoNLL 2008–2009) and there were
a number of attempts to compare various depen-
dencies intrinsically, e.g. (Miyao et al., 2007), and
extrinsically, e.g. (Wu et al., 2012).

In this paper we focus on practical issues of data
representation for dependency parsing. The cen-
tral aspects of our discussion are (a) three depen-
dency formats: two ‘classic’ representations for
dependency parsing, namely, Stanford Basic (SB)
and CoNLL Syntactic Dependencies (CD), and
bilexical dependencies from the HPSG English
Resource Grammar (ERG), so-called DELPH-IN
Syntactic Derivation Tree (DT), proposed recently
by Ivanova et al. (2012); (b) three state-of-the art
statistical parsers: Malt (Nivre et al., 2007), MST

(McDonald et al., 2005) and the parser of Bohnet
and Nivre (2012); (c) two approaches to word-
category disambiguation, e.g. exploiting common
PTB tags and using supertags (i.e. specialized
ERG lexical types).

We parse the formats and compare accuracies
in all configurations in order to determine how
parsers, dependency representations and grammat-
ical tagging methods interact with each other in
application to automatic syntactic analysis.

SB and CD are derived automatically from
phrase structures of Penn Treebank to accommo-
date the needs of fast and accurate dependency
parsing, whereas DT is rooted in the formal gram-
mar theory HPSG and is independent from any
specific treebank. For DT we gain more expres-
sivity from the underlying linguistic theory, which
challenges parsing with statistical tools. The struc-
tural analysis of the schemes in Ivanova et al.
(2012) leads to the hypothesis that CD and DT
are more similar to each other than SB to DT.
We recompute similarities on a larger treebank and
check whether parsing results reflect them.

The paper has the following structure: an
overview of related work is presented in Sec-
tion 2; treebanks, tagsets, dependency schemes
and parsers used in the experiments are introduced
in Section 3; analysis of parsing results is dis-
cussed in Section 4; conclusions and future work
are outlined in Section 5.

2 Related work

Schwartz et al. (2012) investigate which depen-
dency representations of several syntactic struc-
tures are easier to parse with supervised ver-
sions of the Klein and Manning (2004) parser,
ClearParser (Choi and Nicolov, 2009), MST
Parser, Malt and the Easy First Non-directional
parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010). The results
imply that all parsers consistently perform better
when (a) coordination has one of the conjuncts as
the head rather than the coordinating conjunction;

31



A , B and C A , B and C A, B and C

Figure 1: Annotation of coordination structure in SB, CD and DT (left to right) dependency formats

(b) the noun phrase is headed by the noun rather
than by determiner; (c) prepositions or subordinat-
ing conjunctions, rather than their NP or clause ar-
guments, serve as the head in prepositional phrase
or subordinated clauses. Therefore we can expect
(a) Malt and MST to have fewer errors on coor-
dination structures parsing SB and CD than pars-
ing DT, because SB and CD choose the first con-
junct as the head and DT chooses the coordinating
conjunction as the head; (b,c) no significant dif-
ferences for the errors on noun and prepositional
phrases, because all three schemes have the noun
as the head of the noun phrase and the preposition
as the head of the prepositional phrase.

Miwa et al. (2010) present intristic and extris-
tic (event-extraction task) evaluation of six parsers
(GDep, Bikel, Stanford, Charniak-Johnson, C&C
and Enju parser) on three dependency formats
(Stanford Dependencies, CoNLL-X, and Enju
PAS). Intristic evaluation results show that all
parsers have the highest accuracies with the
CoNLL-X format.

3 Data and software

3.1 Treebanks

For the experiments in this paper we used the Penn
Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the Deep-
Bank (Flickinger et al., 2012). The latter is com-
prised of roughly 82% of the sentences of the first
16 sections of the Penn Treebank annotated with
full HPSG analyses from the English Resource
Grammar (ERG). The DeepBank annotations are
created on top of the raw text of the PTB. Due to
imperfections of the automatic tokenization, there
are some token mismatches between DeepBank
and PTB. We had to filter out such sentences to
have consistent number of tokens in the DT, SB
and CD formats. For our experiments we had
available a training set of 22209 sentences and a
test set of 1759 sentences (from Section 15).

3.2 Parsers

In the experiments described in Section 4 we used
parsers that adopt different approaches and imple-
ment various algorithms.

Malt (Nivre et al., 2007): transition-based de-
pendency parser with local learning and greedy
search.

MST (McDonald et al., 2005): graph-based
dependency parser with global near-exhaustive
search.

Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser: transition-
based dependency parser with joint tagger that im-
plements global learning and beam search.

3.3 Dependency schemes
In this work we extract DeepBank data in the form
of bilexical syntactic dependencies, DELPH-IN
Syntactic Derivation Tree (DT) format. We ob-
tain the exact same sentences in Stanford Basic
(SB) format from the automatic conversion of the
PTB with the Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al.,
2006) and in the CoNLL Syntactic Dependencies
(CD) representation using the LTH Constituent-
to-Dependency Conversion Tool for Penn-style
Treebanks (Johansson and Nugues, 2007).

SB and CD represent the way to convert PTB
to bilexical dependencies; in contrast, DT is
grounded in linguistic theory and captures deci-
sions taken in the grammar. Figure 1 demonstrates
the differences between the formats on the coor-
dination structure. According to Schwartz et al.
(2012), analysis of coordination in SB and CD is
easier for a statistical parser to learn; however, as
we will see in section 4.3, DT has more expressive
power distinguishing structural ambiguities illus-
trated by the classic example old men and women.

3.4 Part-of-speech tags
We experimented with two tag sets: PTB tags and
lexical types of the ERG grammar - supertags.

PTB tags determine the part of speech (PoS)
and some morphological features, such as num-
ber for nouns, degree of comparison for adjectives
and adverbs, tense and agreement with person and
number of subject for verbs, etc.

Supertags are composed of part-of-speech, va-
lency in the form of an ordered sequence of
complements, and annotations that encompass
category-internal subdivisions, e.g. mass vs. count
vs. proper nouns, intersective vs. scopal adverbs,

32



or referential vs. expletive pronouns. Example of
a supertag: v np is le (verb “is” that takes noun
phrase as a complement).

There are 48 tags in the PTB tagset and 1091
supertags in the set of lexical types of the ERG.

The state-of-the-art accuracy of PoS-tagging on
in-domain test data using gold-standard tokeniza-
tion is roughly 97% for the PTB tagset and ap-
proximately 95% for the ERG supertags (Ytrestøl,
2011). Supertagging for the ERG grammar is an
ongoing research effort and an off-the-shelf su-
pertagger for the ERG is not currently available.

4 Experiments

In this section we give a detailed analysis of pars-
ing into SB, CD and DT dependencies with Malt,
MST and the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser.

4.1 Setup

For Malt and MST we perform the experiments
on gold PoS tags, whereas the Bohnet and Nivre
(2012) parser predicts PoS tags during testing.

Prior to each experiment with Malt, we used
MaltOptimizer to obtain settings and a feature
model; for MST we exploited default configura-
tion; for the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser we
set the beam parameter to 80 and otherwise em-
ployed the default setup.

With regards to evaluation metrics we use la-
belled attachment score (LAS), unlabeled attach-
ment score (UAS) and label accuracy (LACC) ex-
cluding punctuation. Our results cannot be di-
rectly compared to the state-of-the-art scores on
the Penn Treebank because we train on sections
0-13 and test on section 15 of WSJ. Also our re-
sults are not strictly inter-comparable because the
setups we are using are different.

4.2 Discussion

The results that we are going to analyze are pre-
sented in Tables 1 and 2. Statistical significance
was assessed using Dan Bikel’s parsing evaluation
comparator1 at the 0.001 significance level. We
inspect three different aspects in the interpretation
of these results: parser, dependency format and
tagset. Below we will look at these three angles
in detail.

From the parser perspective Malt and MST are
not very different in the traditional setup with gold

1http://nextens.uvt.nl/depparse-wiki/
SoftwarePage#scoring

PTB tags (Table 1, Gold PTB tags). The Bohnet
and Nivre (2012) parser outperforms Malt on CD
and DT and MST on SB, CD and DT with PTB
tags even though it does not receive gold PTB tags
during test phase but predicts them (Table 2, Pre-
dicted PTB tags). This is explained by the fact that
the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser implements a
novel approach to parsing: beam-search algorithm
with global structure learning.

MST “loses” more than Malt when parsing SB
with gold supertags (Table 1, Gold supertags).
This parser exploits context features “POS tag of
each intervening word between head and depen-
dent” (McDonald et al., 2006). Due to the far
larger size of the supertag set compared to the PTB
tagset, such features are sparse and have low fre-
quencies. This leads to the lower scores of pars-
ing accuracy for MST. For the Bohnet and Nivre
(2012) parser the complexity of supertag predic-
tion has significant negative influence on the at-
tachment and labeling accuracies (Table 2, Pre-
dicted supertags). The addition of gold PTB tags
as a feature lifts the performance of the Bohnet
and Nivre (2012) parser to the level of perfor-
mance of Malt and MST on CD with gold su-
pertags and Malt on SB with gold supertags (com-
pare Table 2, Predicted supertags + gold PTB, and
Table 1, Gold supertags).

Both Malt and MST benefit slightly from the
combination of gold PTB tags and gold supertags
(Table 1, Gold PTB tags + gold supertags). For
the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser we also ob-
serve small rise of accuracy when gold supertags
are provided as a feature for prediction of PTB
tags (compare Predicted PTB tags and Predicted
PTB tags + gold supertags sections of Table 2).

The parsers have different running times: it
takes minutes to run an experiment with Malt,
about 2 hours with MST and up to a day with the
Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser.

From the point of view of the dependency for-
mat, SB has the highest LACC and CD is first-rate
on UAS for all three parsers in most of the con-
figurations (Tables 1 and 2). This means that SB
is easier to label and CD is easier to parse struc-
turally. DT appears to be a more difficult target
format because it is both hard to label and attach
in most configurations. It is not an unexpected re-
sult, since SB and CD are both derived from PTB
phrase-structure trees and are oriented to ease de-
pendency parsing task. DT is not custom-designed

to dependency parsing and is independent from
parsing questions in this sense. Unlike SB and
CD, it is linguistically informed by the underlying,
full-fledged HPSG grammar.

The Jaccard similarity on our training set is 0.57
for SB and CD, 0.564 for CD and DT, and 0.388
for SB and DT. These similarity values show that
CD and DT are structurally closer to each other
than SB and DT. Contrary to our expectations, the
accuracy scores of parsers do not suggest that CD
and DT are particularly similar to each other in
terms of parsing.

Inspecting the aspect of tagset we conclude that
traditional PTB tags are compatible with SB and
CD but do not fit the DT scheme well, while ERG
supertags are specific to the ERG framework and
do not seem to be appropriate for SB and CD. Nei-
ther of these findings seem surprising, as PTB tags
were developed as part of the treebank from which
CD and SB are derived; whereas ERG supertags
are closely related to the HPSG syntactic struc-
tures captured in DT. PTB tags were designed to
simplify PoS-tagging whereas supertags were de-
veloped to capture information that is required to
analyze syntax of HPSG.

For each PTB tag we collected corresponding
supertags from the gold-standard training set. For
open word classes such as nouns, adjectives, ad-
verbs and verbs the relation between PTB tags
and supertags is many-to-many. Unique one-to-
many correspondence holds only for possessive
wh-pronoun and punctuation.

Thus, supertags do not provide extra level of
detalization for PTB tags, but PTB tags and su-
pertags are complementary. As discussed in sec-
tion 3.4, they contain bits of information that are
different. For this reason their combination re-
sults in slight increase of accuracy for all three
parsers on all dependency formats (Table 1, Gold
PTB tags + gold supertags, and Table 2, Predicted
PTB + gold supertags and Predicted supertags +
gold PTB). The Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser
predicts supertags with an average accuracy of
89.73% which is significantly lower than state-of-
the-art 95% (Ytrestøl, 2011).

When we consider punctuation in the evalua-
tion, all scores raise significantly for DT and at
the same time decrease for SB and CD for all three
parsers. This is explained by the fact that punctu-
ation in DT is always attached to the nearest token
which is easy to learn for a statistical parser.

4.3 Error analysis

Using the CoNLL-07 evaluation script2 on our test
set, for each parser we obtained the error rate dis-
tribution over CPOSTAG on SB, CD and DT.

VBP, VBZ and VBG. VBP (verb, non-3rd
person singular present), VBZ (verb, 3rd per-
son singular present) and VBG (verb, gerund or
present participle) are the PTB tags that have error
rates in 10 highest error rates list for each parser
(Malt, MST and the Bohnet and Nivre (2012)
parser) with each dependency format (SB, CD
and DT) and with each PoS tag set (PTB PoS
and supertags) when PTB tags are included as
CPOSTAG feature. We automatically collected all
sentences that contain 1) attachment errors, 2) la-
bel errors, 3) attachment and label errors for VBP,
VBZ and VBG made by Malt parser on DT format
with PTB PoS. For each of these three lexical cat-
egories we manually analyzed a random sample
of sentences with errors and their corresponding
gold-standard versions.

In many cases such errors are related to the root
of the sentence when the verb is either treated as
complement or adjunct instead of having a root
status or vice versa. Errors with these groups of
verbs mostly occur in the complex sentences that
contain several verbs. Sentences with coordina-
tion are particularly difficult for the correct attach-
ment and labeling of the VBP (see Figure 2 for an
example).

Coordination. The error rate of Malt, MST and
the Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser for the coor-
dination is not so high for SB and CD ( 1% and
2% correspondingly with MaltParser, PTB tags)
whereas for DT the error rate on the CPOSTAGS
is especially high (26% with MaltParser, PTB
tags). It means that there are many errors on
incoming dependency arcs for coordinating con-
junctions when parsing DT. On outgoing arcs
parsers also make more mistakes on DT than on
SB and CD. This is related to the difference in
choice of annotation principle (see Figure 1). As
it was shown in (Schwartz et al., 2012), it is harder
to parse coordination headed by coordinating con-
junction.

Although the approach used in DT is harder for
parser to learn, it has some advantages: using SB
and CD annotations, we cannot distinguish the two
cases illustrated with the sentences (a) and (b):

tions between the national fast-food chains
and their franchisees.

b) Proceeds from the sale will be used for re-
modelling and reforbishing projects, as well
as for the planned MGM Grand hotel/casino
and theme park.

In the sentence a) “the national fast-food” refers
only to the conjunct “chains”, while in the sen-
tence b) “the planned” refers to both conjuncts and
“MGM Grand” refers only to the first conjunct.

The Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser succeeds in
finding the correct conjucts (shown in bold font)
on DT and makes mistakes on SB and CD in some
difficult cases like the following ones:

a) <. . .> investors hoard gold and help under-
pin its price <. . .>

b) Then take the expected return and subtract
one standard deviation.

CD and SB wrongly suggest “gold” and “help” to
be conjoined in the first sentence and “return” and
“deviation” in the second.

5 Conclusions and future work

In this survey we gave a comparative experi-
mental overview of (i) parsing three dependency
schemes, viz., Stanford Basic (SB), CoNLL Syn-
tactic Dependencies (CD) and DELPH-IN Syn-
tactic Derivation Tree (DT), (ii) with three lead-
ing dependency parsers, viz., Malt, MST and the
Bohnet and Nivre (2012) parser (iii) exploiting
two different tagsets, viz., PTB tags and supertags.

From the parser perspective, the Bohnet and
Nivre (2012) parser performs better than Malt and
MST not only on conventional formats but also on
the new representation, although this parser solves
a harder task than Malt and MST.

From the dependency format perspective, DT
appeares to be a more difficult target dependency
representation than SB and CD. This suggests that
the expressivity that we gain from the grammar
theory (e.g. for coordination) is harder to learn
with state-of-the-art dependency parsers. CD and
DT are structurally closer to each other than SB
and DT; however, we did not observe sound evi-
dence of a correlation between structural similar-
ity of CD and DT and their parsing accuracies

Regarding the tagset aspect, it is natural that
PTB tags are good for SB and CD, whereas the
more fine-grained set of supertags fits DT bet-
ter. PTB tags and supertags are complementary,
and for all three parsers we observe slight benefits
from being supplied with both types of tags.

As future work we would like to run more ex-
periments with predicted supertags. In the absence
of a specialized supertagger, we can follow the
pipeline of (Ytrestøl, 2011) who reached the state-
of-the-art supertagging accuracy of 95%.

Another area of our interest is an extrinsic eval-
uation of SB, CD and DT, e.g. applied to semantic
role labeling and question-answering in order to
find out if the usage of the DT format grounded
in the computational grammar theory is beneficial
for such tasks.
