Abstract

We present an unsupervised method for in-
ducing semantic frames from verb uses in
giga-word corpora. Our semantic frames
are verb-specific example-based frames
that are distinguished according to their
senses. We use the Chinese Restau-
rant Process to automatically induce these
frames from a massive amount of verb in-
stances. In our experiments, we acquire
broad-coverage semantic frames from two
giga-word corpora, the larger comprising
20 billion words. Our experimental results
indicate the effectiveness of our approach.

1 Introduction

Semantic frames are indispensable knowledge for
semantic analysis or text understanding. In the
last decade, semantic frames, such as FrameNet
(Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al.,
2005), have been manually elaborated. These
resources are effectively exploited in many nat-
ural language processing (NLP) tasks, includ-
ing not only semantic parsing but also ma-
chine translation (Boas, 2002), information ex-
traction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answer-
ing (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), paraphrase
acquisition (Ellsworth and Janin, 2007) and recog-
nition of textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank,
2006).

There have been many attempts to automati-
cally acquire frame knowledge from raw corpora
with the goal of either adding frequency informa-
tion to an existing resource or of inducing simi-
lar frames for other languages. Most of these ap-
proaches, however, focus on syntactic frames, i.e.,
subcategorization frames (e.g., (Manning, 1993;
Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen et al., 2006;
Lippincott et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen,
2013)). Since subcategorization frames represent

argument patterns of verbs and are purely syn-
tactic, expressions that have the same subcatego-
rization frame can have different meanings (e.g.,
metaphors). Semantics-oriented NLP applications
based on frames, such as paraphrase acquisition
and machine translation, require consistency in the
meaning of each frame, and thus these subcatego-
rization frames are not suitable for these semantic
tasks.

Recently, there have been a few studies on au-
tomatically acquiring semantic frames (Materna,
2012; Materna, 2013). Materna induced seman-
tic frames (called LDA-Frames) from triples of
(subject, verb, object) in the British National
Corpus (BNC) based on Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) and the Dirichlet Process. LDA-
Frames capture limited linguistic phenomena of
these triples, and are defined across verbs based
on probabilistic topic distributions.

This paper presents a method for automati-
cally building verb-specific semantic frames from
a large raw corpus. Our semantic frames are verb-
specific like PropBank and semantically distin-
guished. A frame has several syntactic case slots,
each of which consists of words that are eligible to
fill the slot. For example, let us show three seman-
tic frames of the verb “observe”:1
observe:1
nsubj:{we, author, ...} dobj:{effect, result, ...}

prep in:{study, case, ...} ...
observe:2
nsubj:{teacher, we, ...} dobj:{child, student, ...}

prep in:{classroom, school, ...} ...
observe:3
nsubj:{child, people, ...} dobj:{bird, animal, ...}

prep at:{range, time, ...} ...
1In this paper, we use the dependency relation names

of the Stanford collapsed dependencies (de Marneffe et al.,
2006) as the notations of case slots. For instance, “nsubj”
means a nominal subject, “dobj” means a direct object, “iboj”
means an indirect object, “ccomp” means a clausal comple-
ment and “prep *” means a preposition.

Frequencies, which are not shown in the above ex-
amples, are attached to each semantic frame, case
slot and word, and can be effectively exploited for
the applications of these semantic frames. The fre-
quencies of words in each case slot become good
sources of selectional preferences.

Our novel contributions are summarized as fol-
lows:

• induction of semantic frames based on the
Chinese Restaurant Process (Aldous, 1985)
from only automatic parses of a web-scale
corpus,

• exploitation of the assumption of one sense
per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993) to make the
computation feasible,

• providing broad-coverage knowledge for se-
lectional preferences, and

• evaluating induced semantic frames by us-
ing an existing annotated corpus with verb
classes.

2 Related Work

The most closely related work to our semantic
frames are LDA-Frames, which are probabilistic
semantic frames automatically induced from a raw
corpus (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013). He used a
model based on LDA and the Dirichlet Process to
cluster verb instances of a triple (subject, verb, ob-
ject) to produce semantic frames and slots. Both
of these are represented as a probabilistic distri-
bution of words across verbs. He applied this
method to the BNC and acquired 427 frames and
144 slots (Materna, 2013). These frames are over-
generalized across verbs and might be difficult
to provide with fine-grained selectional prefer-
ences. In addition, Grenager and Manning (2006)
proposed a method for inducing PropBank-style
frames from Stanford typed dependencies ex-
tracted from raw corpora. Although these frames
are based on typed dependencies and more seman-
tic than subcategorization frames, they are not dis-
tinguished in terms of the senses of words filling a
case slot.

There are hand-crafted semantic frames in the
lexicons of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). Corpus Pattern
Analysis (CPA) frames (Hanks, 2012) are another
manually created repository of patterns for verbs.
Each pattern represents a prototypical word usage
as extracted by lexicographers from the BNC. Cre-
ating CPA is time consuming, but our proposed

method may be employed to assist in the creation
of this type of resource, as shown in Section 4.4.

Our task can be regarded as clustering of verb
instances. In this respect, the models of Parisien
and Stevenson are related to our method (Parisien
and Stevenson, 2009; Parisien and Stevenson,
2010). Parisien and Stevenson (2009) proposed
a Dirichlet Process model for clustering usages
of the verb “get.” Later, Parisien and Stevenson
(2010) proposed a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
model for jointly clustering argument structures
(i.e., subcategorization frames) and verb classes.
However, their argument structures are not seman-
tic but syntactic, and also they did not evaluate the
resulting frames. There have also been related ap-
proaches to clustering verb types (Vlachos et al.,
2009; Sun and Korhonen, 2009; Falk et al., 2012;
Reichart and Korhonen, 2013). These methods in-
duce verb clusters in which multiple verbs partic-
ipate, and do not consider the polysemy of verbs.
Our objective is different from theirs.

Another line of related work is unsupervised
semantic parsing or semantic role labeling (Poon
and Domingos, 2009; Lang and Lapata, 2010;
Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Lang and Lapata, 2011b;
Titov and Klementiev, 2011; Titov and Klemen-
tiev, 2012). These approaches basically clus-
ter predicates and their arguments to distinguish
predicate senses and semantic roles of arguments.
Modi et al. (2012) extended the model of Titov and
Klementiev (2012) to jointly induce semantic roles
and frames using the Chinese Restaurant Process,
which is also used in our approach. However,
they did not aim at building a lexicon of semantic
frames, but at distinguishing verbs that have dif-
ferent senses in a relatively small annotated cor-
pus. Applying this method to a large corpus could
produce a frame lexicon, but its scalability would
be a big problem.

For other languages than English, Kawahara
and Kurohashi (2006a) proposed a method for au-
tomatically compiling Japanese semantic frames
from a large web corpus. They applied con-
ventional agglomerative clustering to predicate-
argument structures using word/frame similarity
based on a manually-crafted thesaurus. Since
Japanese is head-final and has case-marking post-
positions, it seems easier to build semantic frames
with it than with other languages such as English.
They also achieved an improvement in depen-
dency parsing and predicate-argument structure

59



analysis by using their resulting frames (Kawahara
and Kurohashi, 2006b).

3 Method for Inducing Semantic Frames

Our objective is to automatically induce verb-
specific example-based semantic frames. Each se-
mantic frame consists of a partial set of syntactic
slots: nsubj, dobj, iobj, ccomp and prep *. Each
slot consists of words with frequencies, which
could provide broad-coverage selectional prefer-
ences.

Frames for a verb should be semantically distin-
guished. That is to say, each frame should consist
of predicate-argument structures that have consis-
tent usages or meanings.

Our procedure to automatically generate seman-
tic frames from verb usages is as follows:

1. apply dependency parsing to a raw corpus
and extract predicate-argument structures for
each verb from the automatic parses,

2. merge the predicate-argument structures that
have presumably the same meaning based on
the assumption of one sense per collocation
to get a set of initial frames, and

3. apply clustering to the initial frames based
on the Chinese Restaurant Process to produce
the final semantic frames.

Each of these steps is described in the following
sections in detail.

3.1 Extracting Predicate-argument
Structures from a Raw Corpus

We first apply dependency parsing to a large raw
corpus. We use the Stanford parser with Stanford
dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).2 Col-
lapsed dependencies are adopted to directly extract
prepositional phrases.

Then, we extract predicate-argument structures
from the dependency parses. Dependents that have
the following dependency relations to a verb are
extracted as arguments:

nsubj, xsubj, dobj, iobj, ccomp, xcomp,
prep ∗

Here, we do not distinguish adjuncts from argu-
ments. All extracted dependents of a verb are han-
dled as arguments. This distinction is left for fu-
ture work, but this will be performed using slot

Sentences:
They observed the effects of ...
This statistical ability to observe an effect ...
We did not observe a residual effect of ...
He could observe the results at the same time ...
My first opportunity to observe the results of ...
You can observe beautiful birds ...
Children may then observe birds ...

...

Predicate-argument structures:
nsubj:they observe dobj:effect
observe dobj:effect
nsubj:we observe dobj:effect
nsubj:he observe dobj:result prep at:time
observe dobj:result
nsubj:you observe dobj:bird
nsubj:child observe dobj:bird

...

nsubj:{they, we, ...} observe dobj:{effect}
nsubj:{he, ...} observe dobj:{result} prep at:{time}
nsubj:{you, child, ...} observe dobj:{bird}

tures and initial frames for the verb “observe.”

frequencies in the applications of semantic frames
or the method proposed by Abend and Rappoport
(2010).

We apply the following processes to extracted
predicate-argument structures:

• A verb and an argument are lemmatized, and
only the head of an argument is preserved for
compound nouns.

• Phrasal verbs are also distinguished from
non-phrasal verbs. For example, “look up”
has independent frames from “look.”

• The passive voice of a verb is distinguished
from the active voice, and thus these have in-
dependent frames. Passive voice is detected
using the part-of-speech tag “VBN” (past
participle). The alignment between frames of
active and passive voices will be done after
the induction of frames using the model of
Sasano et al. (2013) in the future.

• “xcomp” (open clausal complement) is re-
named to “ccomp” (clausal complement) and
“xsubj” (controlling subject) is renamed to
“nsubj” (nominal subject). This is because

60



these usages as predicate-argument structures
are not different.

• A capitalized argument with the part-of
speech “NNP” (singular proper noun) or
“NNPS” (plural proper noun) is general-
ized to ⟨name⟩. Similarly, an argument of
“ccomp” is generalized to ⟨comp⟩ since the
content of a clausal complement is not impor-
tant.

Extracted predicate-argument structures are
collected for each verb and the subsequent pro-
cesses are applied to the predicate-argument struc-
tures of each verb. Figure 1 shows examples of
predicate-argument structures for “observe.”

3.2 Constructing Initial Frames from
Predicate-argument Structures

A straightforward way to produce semantic frames
is to cluster the extracted predicate-argument
structures directly. Since our objective is to com-
pile broad-coverage semantic frames, a massive
amount of predicate-argument structures should
be fed into the clustering. It would take prohibitive
computational costs to conduct the sampling pro-
cedure, which is described in the next section.

To make the computation feasible, we merge the
predicate-argument structures that have the same
or similar meaning to get initial frames. These ini-
tial frames are the input of the subsequent cluster-
ing process. For this merge, we assume one sense
per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993) for predicate-
argument structures.

For each predicate-argument structure of a verb,
we couple the verb and an argument to make a unit
for sense disambiguation. We select an argument
in the following order by considering the degree of
effect on the verb sense:3

dobj, ccomp, nsubj, prep ∗, iobj.

This selection of a predominant argument order
above is justified by relative comparisons of the
discriminative power of the different slots for CPA
frames (Popescu, 2013). If a predicate-argument
structure does not have any of the above slots, it is
discarded.

Then, the predicate-argument structures that
have the same verb and argument pair (slot and

3If a predicate-argument structure has multiple preposi-
tional phrases, one of them is randomly selected.

word, e.g., “dobj:effect”) are merged into an ini-
tial frame (Figure 1). After this process, we dis-
card minor initial frames that occur fewer than 10
times.

For example, we have 732,292 instances
(predicate-argument structures) for the verb “ob-
serve” in the web corpus that is used in our exper-
iment (its details are described in Section 4.1). As
the result of this merging process, we obtain 6,530
initial frames, which become an input for the clus-
tering. This means that this process accelerates the
speed of clustering more than 100 times.

The precision of this process will be evaluated
in Section 4.3.

3.3 Clustering using Chinese Restaurant
Process

We cluster initial frames for each verb to produce
final semantic frames using the Chinese Restau-
rant Process (Aldous, 1985). We regard each ini-
tial frame as an instance in the usual clustering of
the Chinese Restaurant Process.

We calculate the posterior probability of a se-
mantic frame fj given an initial frame vi as fol-
lows:

P (fj |vi) ∝
{

n(fj)
N+α · P (vi|fj) fj ̸= new

α
N+α · P (vi|fj) fj = new,

(1)

where N is the number of initial frames for the
target verb and n(fj) is the current number of ini-
tial frames assigned to the semantic frame fj . α
is a hyper-parameter that determines how likely
it is for a new semantic frame to be created. In
this equation, the first term is the Dirichlet process
prior and the second term is the likelihood of vi.

P (vi|fj) is defined based on the Dirichlet-
Multinomial distribution as follows:

P (vi|fj) =
∏
w∈V

P (w|fj)count(vi,w), (2)

where V is the vocabulary in all case slots cooc-
curring with the verb. It is distinguished by
the case slot, and thus consists of pairs of slots
and words, e.g., “nsubj:child” and “dobj:bird.”
count(vi, w) is the number of w in the initial
frame vi.

P (w|fj) is defined as follows:

P (w|fj) = count(fj , w) + β∑
t∈V count(fj , t) + |V | · β

, (3)

61



where count(fj , w) is the current number of w in
the frame fj , and β is a hyper-parameter of Dirich-
let distribution. For a new semantic frame, this
probability is uniform (1/|V |).

We use Gibbs sampling to realize this cluster-
ing.

4 Experiments and Evaluations

4.1 Experimental Settings

We use two kinds of large-scale corpora: a web
corpus and the English Gigaword corpus.

To prepare a web corpus, we first crawled the
web. We extracted sentences from each web
page that seems to be written in English based
on the encoding information. Then, we selected
sentences that consist of at most 40 words, and
removed duplicated sentences. From this pro-
cess, we obtained a corpus of one billion sen-
tences, totaling approximately 20 billion words.
We focused on verbs whose frequency was more
than 1,000. There were 19,649 verbs, includ-
ing phrasal verbs, and separating passive and ac-
tive constructions. We extracted 2,032,774,982
predicate-argument structures.

We also used the English Gigaword corpus
(LDC2011T07; English Gigaword Fifth Edition)
to induce semantic frames. This corpus consists
of approximately 180 million sentences, which to-
taling four billion words. There were 7,356 verbs
after applying the same frequency threshold as the
web corpus. We extracted 423,778,278 predicate-
argument structures from this corpus.

We set the hyper-parameters α in (1) and β in
(3) to 1.0. The frame assignments for all the com-
ponents were initialized randomly. We took 100
samples for each initial frame and selected the
frame assignment that has the highest probability.
These parameters were determined according to a
preliminary experiment to manually examine the
quality of resulting frames.

4.2 Experimental Results

We executed the per-verb clustering tasks on a PC
cluster. It finished within a few hours for most
verbs, but it took a couple of days for very frequent
verbs, such as “get” and “say.” The clustering pro-
duced an average number of semantic frames per
verb of 15.2 for the web corpus and 18.5 for the
Gigaword corpus. Examples of induced semantic
frames from the web corpus are shown in Table 1.

4.3 Evaluation of Induced Semantic Frames

We evaluate precision and coverage of induced se-
mantic frames. To measure the precision of in-
duced semantic frames, we adopt the purity met-
ric, which is usually used to evaluate clustering re-
sults. However, the problem is that it is impossible
to assign gold-standard classes to the huge num-
ber of instances. To automatically measure the
purity of the induced semantic frames, we make
use of the SemLink corpus (Loper et al., 2007), in
which VerbNet classes (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) and
PropBank/FrameNet frames are assigned to each
instance. We make a test set that contains 157 pol-
ysemous verbs that occur 10 or more times in the
SemLink corpus (sections 02-21 of the Wall Street
Journal). We first add these instances to the in-
stances from a raw corpus and apply clustering to
these merged instances. Then, we compare the in-
duced semantic frames of the SemLink instances
with their gold-standard classes. We adopt Verb-
Net classes and PropBank frames as gold-standard
classes.

For each group of verb-specific semantic
frames, we measure the purity of the frames as the
percentage of SemLink instances belonging to the
majority gold class in their respective cluster. Let

N denote the total number of SemLink instances
of the target verb, Gj the set of instances belong-
ing to the j-th gold class and Fi the set of instances
belonging to the i-th frame. The purity (PU) can
then be written as follows:

PU =
1
N

∑
i

max
j

|Gj ∩ Fi|. (4)
For example, a frame of the verb “observe” con-
tains 11 SemLink instances, and eight out of them
belong to the class SAY-37.7, which is the ma-
jority class among these 11 instances. PU is cal-
culated by summing up such counts over all the
frames of this verb.

Usually, inverse purity or collocation is used
to measure the recall of normal clustering tasks.
However, these recall measures do not fit our task.
This is because it is not a real error to have similar
separate frames. Instead, we want to avoid hav-
ing so many frames that we cannot provide broad-
coverage selectional preferences due to sparsity.
To judge this aspect, we measure coverage.

The coverage (CO) measures to what extent
predicate-argument structures of the target verb in
a test set are included in one of frames of the verb.
We use the predicate-argument structures of the
above 157 verbs from the SemLink corpus, which
are the same ones used in the evaluation of PU.
We judge a predicate-argument structure as cor-
rect if all of its argument words (of the target slot

described in Section 3.1) are included in the corre-
sponding slot of a frame. If the clustering gets bet-
ter, the value of CO will get higher, because merg-
ing instances by clustering alleviates data sparsity.

These per-verb scores are aggregated into an
overall score by averaging over all verbs. We use
two ways of averaging: a macro average and a mi-
cro average. The macro average is a simple av-
erage of scores for individual verbs. The micro
average is obtained by weighting the scores for in-
dividual verbs proportional to the number of in-
stances for that verb. Finally, we use the harmonic
mean (F1) of purity and coverage as a single mea-
sure of clustering quality.

For comparison, we adopt the following two
baseline methods:

One frame a frame into which all the instances
for a verb are merged

Initial frames the initial frames without cluster-
ing (described in Section 3.2)

Table 2 and Table 3 list evaluation results for
semantic frames induced from the web corpus and
the Gigaword corpus, respectively.4 Note that CO
does not consider gold-standard classes, and thus
the values of CO are the same for the VerbNet

induced semantic frames range from 0.42 to 0.49.

and PropBank evaluations. The induced frames
outperformed the two baseline methods in terms
of F1 in most cases. While the coverage of the
web frames was higher than that of the Giga-
word frames, as expected, the purity of the web
frames was slightly lower than that of the Giga-
word frames. This degradation might be caused
by the noise in the web corpus.

The purity of the initial frames was around
98%-99%, which means that there were few cases
that the one-sense-per-collocation assumption was
violated.

Modi et al. (2012) reported a purity of 77.9%
for the assignment of FrameNet frames to the
FrameNet corpus. We also conducted the above
purity evaluation against FrameNet frames for 140
verbs.5 We obtained a macro average of 92.9%
and a micro average of 89.2% for the web frames,
and a macro average of 93.2% and a micro average
of 89.8% for the Gigaword frames. It is difficult
to directly compare these results with Modi et al.
(2012), but our frame assignments seem to have
higher accuracy.

4.4 Evaluation against CPA Frames

Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA) is a technique for
linking word usage to prototypical syntagmatic
patterns.6 The resource was built manually by in-
vestigating examples in the BNC, and the set of
corpus examples used to induce each pattern is
given. For example, the following three patterns
describe the usage of the verb “accommodate.”

[Human 1] accommodate [Human 2]
[Building] accommodate [Eventuality]
[Human] accommodate [Self] to [Eventuality]

In this paper, we use CPA to evaluate the quality
of the automatically induced frames. By compar-
ing the induced frames to CPA patterns, we can
evaluate the correctness and relevance of this ap-
proach from a human point of view. To do that,
we associate semantic features to the set of words
in each slot in the frames, using SUMO (Niles
and Pease, 2001). For example, take the follow-
ing frame for the verb “accomplish”:
accomplish:1

nsubj:{you, leader, employee, ...}
dobj:{developing, progress, objective, ...}.
5Since FrameNet frames are not assigned to all the verbs

of SemLink, the number of verbs is different from the evalu-
ations against VerbNet and PropBank.

Using SUMO, we map this frame to the following:
nsubj: [Human]
dobj: [SubjectiveAssessmentAttribute],

which corresponds to pattern 3 for “accomplish”
in CPA.

We also associate SUMO attributes to the CPA
patterns with more than 10 examples (716 verbs).
There are many patterns of SUMO attributes for
any CPA frame or induced frame, since each
filler word in a particular slot can have more
than one SUMO attribute. We filter out the
non-discriminative SUMO attributes following the
technique described in Popescu (2013). Using
this, we obtain SUMO attributes for both CPA
clusters and induced frames, and we can use the
standard entropy-based measures to evaluate the
match between the two types of patterns: E — en-
tropy, RC — recovery rate, and P — purity (Li et
al., 2004):

where mj is the number of induced frames corre-
sponding to topic j, mij is the number of induced
frames in cluster j and annotated with the CPA
pattern i, m is the total number of induced frames,
L is the number of CPA patterns, and K is the
number of induced frames.

We also consider a K-means clustering process,
with K set as 2 or 3 depending on the number of
SUMO-attributed patterns. The K-means evalu-
ation is carried out considering only the centroid
of the cluster, which corresponds to the prototypi-
cal induced semantic frame with SUMO attributes.
We compute E, RC and P using formulae (5) -
(7) for each verb and then compute the macro av-
erage, considering all the frames and only the K-
means centroids, respectively. The results for the
induced web frames are displayed in Table 4.

The evaluation method presented here over-
comes some of the drawbacks of the previous ap-
proaches (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013). First,
we did not limit the evaluation to the most frequent
patterns. Second, the mapping was carried out au-
tomatically and not by hand. The results above
compare favorably with the previous approaches,
especially considering that no filtering procedures
were applied to the induced frames. We anticipate
that the results based on the prototypical induced
frames with SUMO attributes would be competi-
tive. Our post-analysis revealed that the entropy
can be lowered further if an automatic filtering
based on frequencies is applied.

4.5 Evaluation of the Quality of Selectional
Preferences

We also investigated the quality of selectional
preferences within the induced semantic frames.
The only publicly available test data for selectional
preferences, to our knowledge, is from Chambers
and Jurafsky (2010). This data consists of quadru-
ples (verb, relation, word, confounder) and does
not contain their context.7

A typical way for using our semantic frames is
to select an appropriate frame for an input sen-
tence and judge the eligibility of the word uses
against the selected frame. However, due to the
lack of context for the above data, it is difficult to
select a corresponding semantic frame for a test
quadruple and thus the induced semantic frames
cannot be naturally applied to this data. To in-
vestigate the potential for selectional preferences
of the semantic frames, we approximately match
a quadruple with each of the semantic frames of
the verb and select the frame that has the highest
probability as follows:

P (w) = max
i

P (w|v, rel, fi), (8)
where w is the word or confounder, v is the verb,
rel is the relation and fi is a semantic frame. By
comparing the probabilities of the word and the
confounder, we select either of them according to
the higher probability. For tie breaking in the case
that no frames are found for the verb or both the
word and confounder are not found in the case slot,
we randomly select either of them in the same way
as Chambers and Jurafsky (2010).

We use the “neighbor frequency” set, which is
the most difficult among the three sets included

7A document ID of the English Gigaword corpus is avail-
able, but it is difficult to recover the context of each instance
from this information.

in the data. It contains 6,767 quadruples and the
relations consist of three classes: subject, object
and preposition, which has no distinction of ac-
tual prepositions. To link these relations with our
case slots, we manually aligned the subject with
the nsubj (nominal subject) slot, the object with
the dobj (direct object) slot and the preposition
with prep * (all the prepositions) slots. For the
preposition relation, we choose the highest prob-
ability among all the preposition slots in a frame.
To match the generalized ⟨name⟩ with the word in
a quadruple, we change the word to ⟨name⟩ if it is
capitalized and not a capitalized personal pronoun.

Our semantic frames from the Gigaword corpus
achieved an accuracy of 81.7%8 and those from
the web corpus achieved an accuracy of 80.2%.
This slight deterioration seems to come from the
noise in the web corpus. The best performance
in Chambers and Jurafsky (2010) is 81.7% on
this “neighbor frequency” set, which was achieved
by conditional probabilities with the Erk (2007)’s
smoothing method calculated from the English Gi-
gaword corpus. Our approach for selectional pref-
erences does not use smoothing like Erk (2007),
but it achieved equivalent performance to the pre-
vious work. If we applied our semantic frames to a
verb instance with its context, a more precise judg-
ment of selectional preferences would be possible
with appropriate frame selection.

5 Conclusion

This paper has described an unsupervised method
for inducing semantic frames from instances of
each verb in giga-word corpora. This method is
clustering based on the Chinese Restaurant Pro-
cess. The resulting frame data are open to the pub-
lic and also can be searched by inputting a verb via
our web interface.9

As applications of the resulting frames, we plan
to integrate them into syntactic parsing, semantic
role labeling and verb sense disambiguation. For
instance, Kawahara and Kurohashi (2006b) im-
proved accuracy of dependency parsing based on
Japanese semantic frames automatically induced
from a large raw corpus. It is valuable and promis-
ing to apply our semantic frames to these NLP
tasks.

8Since the dataset was created from the NYT 2001 portion
of the English Gigaword Corpus, we built semantic frames
again from the Gigaword corpus except this part.
