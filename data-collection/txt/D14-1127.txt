Abstract
We present a weakly supervised approach
for learning hashtags, hashtag patterns, and
phrases associated with five emotions: AFFEC-
TION, ANGER/RAGE, FEAR/ANXIETY, JOY,
and SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. Starting
with seed hashtags to label an initial set of
tweets, we train emotion classifiers and use
them to learn new emotion hashtags and hash-
tag patterns. This process then repeats in a
bootstrapping framework. Emotion phrases
are also extracted from the learned hashtags
and used to create phrase-based emotion clas-
sifiers. We show that the learned set of emo-
tion indicators yields a substantial improve-
ment in F-scores, ranging from +%5 to +%18
over baseline classifiers.

1 Introduction
Identifying emotions in social media text can be benefi-
cial for many applications, for example to help compa-
nies understand how people feel about their products,
to assist governments in recognizing growing anger or
fear associated with an event, or to help media outlets
understand people’s emotional response toward contro-
versial issues or international affairs. On the Twitter
micro-blogging platform, people often use hashtags to
express an emotional state (e.g., #happyasalways, #an-
gryattheworld). While some hashtags consist of a sin-
gle word (e.g., #angry), many hashtags include multi-
ple words and creative spellings (e.g., #cantwait4tmrw,
#Youredabest), which can not be easily recognized us-
ing sentiment or emotion lexicons.

Our research learns three types of emotion in-
dicators for tweets: hashtags, hashtag patterns,
and phrases for one of five emotions: AFFEC-
TION, ANGER/RAGE, FEAR/ANXIETY, JOY, or SAD-
NESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. We present a bootstrapping
framework for learning emotion hashtags and extend
the framework to also learn more general hashtag pat-
terns. We then harvest emotion phrases from the hash-
tags and hashtag patterns for contextual emotion clas-
sification.

First, we make the observation that emotion hashtags
often share a common prefix. For example, #angry-
attheworld and #angryatlife both have the prefix “an-

gry at”, which suggests the emotion ANGER. Conse-
quently, we generalize beyond specific hashtags to cre-
ate hashtag patterns that will match all hashtags with
the same prefix, such as the pattern #angryat* which
will match both #angryattheworld and #angryatlife.

A key challenge is that a seemingly strong emotion
word or phrase can have a different meaning depending
upon the following words. For example, #angry* may
seem like an obvious pattern to identify ANGER tweets.
But #angrybirds is a popular hashtag that refers to a
game, not the writer’s emotion. Similarly, “love you”
usually expresses AFFECTION when it is followed by
a person (e.g., #loveyoumom). But it may express JOY
in other contexts (e.g., #loveyoulife). We use probabil-
ity estimates to determine which hashtag patterns are
reliable indicators for an emotion.

Our second observation is that hashtags can also be
used to harvest emotion phrases. For example, if we
learn that the hashtag #lovelife is associated with JOY,
then we can extract the phrase “love life” from the
hashtag and use it to recognize emotion in the body
of tweets. However, unlike hashtags, which are self-
contained, the words surrounding a phrase in a tweet
must also be considered. For example, negation can
toggle polarity (“don’t love life” may suggest SAD-
NESS, not JOY) and the aspectual context may indicate
that no emotion is being expressed (e.g., “I would love
life if ...”). Consequently, we train classifiers to deter-
mine if a tweet contains an emotion based on both an
emotion phrase and its context.

2 Related Work

In addition to sentiment analysis, which has been
widely studied (e.g., (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Brody
and Diakopoulos, 2011; Kouloumpis et al., 2011;
Mitchell et al., 2013)), recognizing emotions in social
media text has also become a popular research topic in
recent years. Researchers have studied feature sets and
linguistic styles (Roberts et al., 2012), emotion influ-
encing behaviors (Kim et al., 2012), sentence contexts
(Yang et al., 2007b), hierarchical emotion classifica-
tion (Ghazi et al., 2010; Esmin et al., 2012) and emo-
tion lexicon creation (Yang et al., 2007a; Mohammad,
2012a; Staiano and Guerini, 2014). Researchers have
also started to utilize the hashtags of tweets, but pri-
marily to collect labeled data (e.g., for sarcasm (Davi-

dov et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2013) and for senti-
ment/emotion data (Wang et al., 2012; Mohammad et
al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2012; Purver and Bat-
tersby, 2012; Mohammad, 2012a)).

Wang et al. (2011) investigated several graph based
algorithms to collectively classify hashtag sentiments,
but their work is focused on positive versus nega-
tive polarity classification. Our research extends the
preliminary work on bootstrapped learning of emo-
tion hashtags (Qadir and Riloff, 2013) to additionally
learn patterns corresponding to hashtag prefix expres-
sions and to extract emotion phrases from the hashtags,
which are used to train phrase-based emotion classi-
fiers.

3 Learning Emotion Hashtags, Hashtag
Patterns and Phrases

For our research, we collapsed Parrot’s emo-
tion taxonomy (Parrott, 2001)1 into 5 emotion
classes that frequently occur in tweets and min-
imally overlap with each other: AFFECTION,
ANGER/RAGE, FEAR/ANXIETY, JOY, and SAD-
NESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. We also used a NONE OF
THE ABOVE class for tweets that do not express any
emotion or express an emotion different from our five
classes. For each of these categories, we identified 5
common hashtags that are strongly associated with the
emotion and used them as seeds. Table 1 shows the
seed hashtags.

Compared to the Ekman emotion classes (Ekman,
1992), one of the emotion taxonomies frequently used
in NLP research (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007; Mo-
hammad, 2012b), JOY, ANGER, SADNESS and FEAR
are comparable to 4 of our 5 emotion classes. We do
not study Ekman’s SURPRISE and DISGUST classes,
but include AFFECTION.

collecting tweets that contain the seed hashtags and la-
beling them with the corresponding emotion. For this
purpose, we collected 323,000 tweets in total that con-
tain at least one of our seed hashtags. We also exploit a
large pool of unlabeled tweets to use during bootstrap-
ping, consisting of 2.3 million tweets with at least one
hashtag per tweet (because we want to learn hashtags),
collected using Twitter’s streaming API. We did not in-
clude retweets or tweets with URLs, to reduce duplica-
tion and focus on tweets with original content. The un-
labeled tweets dataset had 1.29 average hashtags-per-
tweet and 3.95 average tweets-per-hashtag. We prepro-
cessed the tweets with CMU’s tokenizer (Owoputi et
al., 2013) and normalized with respect to case.

The labeled tweets are then used to train a set of
emotion classifiers. We trained one logistic regression
classifier for each emotion class using the LIBLINEAR
package (Fan et al., 2008). We chose logistic regression
because it produces probabilities with its predictions,
which are used to assign scores to hashtags. As fea-
tures, we used unigrams and bigrams with frequency>
1. We removed the seed hashtags from the tweets so
the classifiers could not use them as features.

For each emotion class e ∈ E, the tweets contain-
ing a seed hashtag for e were used as positive training
instances. The negative training instances consisted of
the tweets containing seed hashtags for the competing
emotions as well as 100,000 randomly selected tweets

from our unlabeled tweets. Although some of the unla-
beled tweets may correspond to emotion e, we expect
that most will have no emotion or an emotion different
from e, giving us a slightly noisy but large, diverse set
of negative instances.

We then apply each emotion classifier to the un-
labeled tweets. For each emotion e, we collect the
tweets classified as e and extract the hashtags from
those tweets to create a candidate pool He of hashtags
for emotion e. To limit the number of candidates, we
discard hashtags that occur < 10 times, have just one
character, or have> 20 characters. Next, we score each
candidate hashtag h by computing the average proba-
bility assigned by the logistic regression classifier for
emotion e over all of the tweets containing hashtag h.
For each emotion class, we select the 10 hashtags with
the highest scores. From the unlabeled tweets, we then
add all tweets with one of the learned hashtags to the
training instances, and the bootstrapping process con-
tinues. Table 2 shows examples of the learned hashtags.

3.2 Learning Hashtag Patterns

We learn hashtag patterns in a similar but separate boot-
strapping process. We first expand each hashtag into a
sequence of words using an N-gram based word seg-
mentation algorithm2 supplied with corpus statistics
from our tweet collection. For example, #angryatlife
expands3 to the phrase “angry at life”. We use a Prefix
Tree (Trie) data structure to represent all possible pre-
fixes of the expanded hashtag phrases, but the prefixes
consist of words instead of characters.

Next, we traverse the tries and consider all possi-
ble prefix paths as candidate hashtag patterns. We
only consider prefixes that have occurred with at least
one following word. For example, #angryashell, #an-
gryasalways, #angrybird, #angryatlife, #angryatyou
would produce patterns: #angry*, #angryas*, #an-
gryat* as shown in Figure 2.

We score each pattern by applying the classifier for

3On a random sample of 100 hashtags, we found expan-

sion accuracy to be 76% (+8% partially correct expansions).

emotion e (trained in the same way as hashtag learn-
ing) to all tweets having hashtags that match the pat-
tern. We compute the average probability produced by
the classifier, and for each emotion class, we select the
10 hashtag patterns with the highest scores. From the
unlabeled tweets, we then add all tweets with hashtags
that match one of the learned hashtag patterns to the
training instances, and the bootstrapping process con-
tinues. Table 3 shows examples of learned hashtag pat-
terns and matched hashtags.

3.3 Creating Phrase-based Classifiers
The third type of emotion indicator that we acquire are
emotion phrases. At the end of the bootstrapping pro-
cess, we apply the word segmentation algorithm to all
of the learned hashtags and hashtag patterns to expand
them into phrases (e.g., #lovemylife→ “love my life”).
Each phrase is assumed to express the same emotion as
the original hashtag. However, as we will see in Sec-
tion 4, just the presence of a phrase yields low preci-
sion, and surrounding context must also be taken into
account.

Consequently, we train a logistic regression classi-
fier for each emotion e, which classifies a tweet with
respect to emotion e based on the presence of a learned
phrase for e as well as a context window of size 6
around the phrase (set of 3 words on its left and set of 3

words on its right). Tweets containing a learned phrase
for e and a seed hashtag for e are the positive training
instances. Tweets containing a learned phrase for e and
a seed hashtag for a different emotion are used as the
negative training instances. For example, when “love
my life” is learned as an emotion phrase for JOY, the
tweet, “how can I love my life when everybody leaves
me! #sad” will have one feature each for the left words
“how”, “can”, and “I”, one feature each for the right
words “when”, “everybody” and “leaves”, and one
feature for the phrase “love my life”. The tweet will
then be considered a negative instance for JOY because
“#sad” indicates a different emotion.

4 Experimental Results
To evaluate our learned emotion indicators, we manu-
ally selected 25 topic keywords/phrases4 that we con-
sidered to be strongly associated with emotions, but
not necessarily with any specific emotions of our study.
We then searched in Twitter using Twitter Search API
for any of these topic phrases and their correspond-
ing hashtags. These 25 topic phrases are: Prom,
Exam, Graduation, Marriage, Divorce, Husband, Wife,
Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Job, Hire, Laid Off, Retirement,
Win, Lose, Accident, Failure, Success, Spider, Loud
Noise, Chest Pain, Storm, Home Alone, No Sleep and
Interview. Since the purpose is to evaluate the qual-
ity and coverage of the emotion hashtags that we learn,
we filtered out any tweet that did not have at least one
hashtag.

Two annotators were given annotation guidelines
and were instructed to label each tweet with up to
two emotions. The instructions specified that the emo-
tion must be felt by the writer. The annotators an-
notated 500 tweets with an inter-annotator agreement
level of 0.79 Kappa (κ) (Carletta, 1996). The an-
notation disagreements in these 500 tweets were then
adjudicated, and each annotator labeled an additional
2,500 tweets. Altogether this gave us an emotion an-
notated dataset of 5,500 tweets. We randomly sepa-
rated out 1,000 tweets from this collection as a tuning

4This data collection process is similar to the emotion
tweet dataset creation by Roberts et al. (2012)

set, and used the remaining 4,500 tweets as evaluation
data. The distribution of emotions in the evaluation
data was 6% for AFFECTION, 9% for ANGER/RAGE,
13% for FEAR/ANXIETY, 22% for JOY, and 12% for
SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. 42% of the tweets had
none of the 5 emotions and 4% of the tweets had more
than one emotions in the same tweet.

We created two baseline systems to assess the diffi-
culty of the emotion classification task. First, we cre-
ated SVM classifiers for each emotion using N-gram
features and performed 10-fold cross-validation on the
test data. We used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011)
and set the cost and gamma parameters based on the
tuning data. Second, we acquired the NRC Emotional
Tweets Lexicon (Mohammad, 2012a), which contains
emotion unigrams and bigrams for 8 emotions, 4 that
are comparable to ours: ANGER, FEAR, JOY and SAD-
NESS. We created a hashtag from each term in the lexi-
con by appending a # symbol on the front and removing
whitespace. For each term, we chose the emotion with
the highest score in the lexicon.

Table 4 shows our experimental results. The baseline
classifiers (SVM1 uses unigrams, SVM1+2 uses uni-
grams and bigrams) have low recall but 63-78% pre-
cision. The hashtags created from the NRC Lexicon
have low precision. This could be due to possible en-
tries (e.g., “candy” or “idea”), which without context
are not much indicative of any specific emotion.

The second section of Table 4 shows the results when
we label a tweet based on the presence of a hash-
tag or hashtag pattern. First, we use just the 5 seed
hashtags to assess their coverage (as expected, high
precision but low recall). Next, we add the hashtags
learned during bootstrapping. For most emotions, the
hashtags achieve performance similar to the supervised
SVMs. The following row shows results for our learned
hashtag patterns. Recall improves by +14% for AF-
FECTION, which illustrates the benefit of more general
hashtag patterns, and at least maintains similar level of
precision for other emotions. When the hashtags and
hashtag patterns are combined (HTs+HPs), we see the
best of both worlds with improved recall as high as
+17% in AFFECTION and +10% in FEAR/ANXIETY

compared to All HTs, as well as improved F-scores
across the board.

The third section of Table 4 presents the results for
the emotion phrases. The first row (Emotion Phrases)
shows that labeling a tweet based solely on the pres-
ence of a phrase is not very accurate. Next, we applied
the trained models of the phrase-based classifiers (de-
scribed in Section 3.3) to each tweet of the evaluation
data. This provided us with probability of an emotion
for each of the 5 emotions. The phrase-based classifiers
(PC) yield higher precision, albeit with low recall. Fi-
nally, we use these probabilities as 5 additional features
to SVM1. The corresponding SVM1+PC row shows
a consistent 1-2 point F score gain over the original
SVM1 baseline.

The last section of Table 4 shows the best results with
a hybrid system, which labels a tweet with emotion e if
EITHER the enhanced SVM labels it as e OR the tweet
contains a hashtag or hashtag pattern associated with e.
This combined approach achieves substantially higher
performance than any individual method across all 5
emotion classes, with improved F-scores ranging from
+%5 to +%18 over the baseline classifiers, demonstrat-
ing that the different types of emotion indicators are
complementary.

5 Conclusions
We have shown that three types of emotion indicators
can be learned from tweets with weakly supervised
bootstrapping: hashtags, hashtag patterns, and phrases.
Our findings suggest that emotion hashtags are strong
indicators for recognizing writer’s emotion in tweets,
and can be further generalized into hashtag patterns by
learning prefix expressions corresponding to an emo-
tion. Phrases learned from the hashtags and patterns
are not always reliable by themselves, but training ad-

ditional classifiers with the emotion phrases and their
surrounding context provides added benefits to emotion
classification in tweets. Our results showed that com-
bining the learned emotion indicators with an N-gram
classifier in a hybrid approach substantially improves
performance across 5 emotion classes.
