Abstract

Languages that have no explicit word de-
limiters often have to be segmented for sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT). This is
commonly performed by automated seg-
menters trained on manually annotated
corpora. However, the word segmentation
(WS) schemes of these annotated corpora
are handcrafted for general usage, and
may not be suitable for SMT. An analysis
was performed to test this hypothesis us-
ing a manually annotated word alignment
(WA) corpus for Chinese-English SMT.
An analysis revealed that 74.60% of the
sentences in the WA corpus if segmented
using an automated segmenter trained on
the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) will
contain conflicts with the gold WA an-
notations. We formulated an approach
based on word splitting with reference to
the annotated WA to alleviate these con-
flicts. Experimental results show that the
refined WS reduced word alignment error
rate by 6.82% and achieved the highest
BLEU improvement (0.63 on average) on
the Chinese-English open machine trans-
lation (OpenMT) corpora compared to re-
lated work.

1 Introduction

Word segmentation is a prerequisite for many
natural language processing (NLP) applications
on those languages that have no explicit space
between words, such as Arabic, Chinese and
Japanese. As the first processing step, WS affects
all successive steps, thus it has a large potential
impact on the final performance. For SMT, the
unsupervised WA, building translation models and
reordering models, and decoding are all based on
segmented words.

Automated word segmenters built through
supervised-learning methods, after decades of in-
tensive research, have emerged as effective so-
lutions to WS tasks and become widely used in
many NLP applications. For example, the Stan-
ford word segmenter (Xue et al., 2002)1 which is
based on conditional random field (CRF) is em-
ployed to prepare the official corpus for NTCIR-
9 Chinese-English patent translation task (Goto et
al., 2011).

However, one problem with applying these
supervised-learning word segmenters to SMT is
that the WS scheme of annotating the training cor-
pus may not be optimal for SMT. (Chang et al.,
2008) noticed that the words in CTB are often too
long for SMT. For example, a full Chinese per-
sonal name which consists of a family name and a
given name is always taken as a single word, but
its counterpart in English is usually two words.

Manually WA corpora are precious resources
for SMT research, but they used to be only avail-
able in small volumes due to the production cost.
For example, (Och and Ney, 2000) initially an-
notated 447 English-French sentence pairs, which
later became the test data set in ACL 2003 shared
task on word alignment (Mihalcea and Pedersen,
2003), and was used frequently thereafter (Liang
et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007; Haghighi et
al., 2009)

For Chinese and English, the shortage of man-
ually WA corpora has recently been relieved
by the linguistic data consortium (LDC) 2

GALE Chinese-English word alignment and tag-
ging training corpus (the GALE WA corpus)3.
The corpus is considerably large, containing 4,735
documents, 18,507 sentence pairs, 620,189 Chi-
nese tokens, 518,137 English words, and 421,763

alignment annotations. The corpus carries no Chi-
nese WS annotation, and the WA annotation was
performed between Chinese characters and En-
glish words. The alignment identifies minimum
translation units and relations 4, referred as atomic
blocks and atomic edges, respectively, in this pa-
per. Figure 1 shows an example that contains six
atomic edges.

Visual inspection of the segmentation of an au-
tomatic segmenter with reference to a WA cor-
pus revealed a number of inconsistencies. For ex-
ample, consider the word “bao fa” in Figure 1.
Empirically we observed that this word is seg-
mented as a single token by an automatic seg-
menter trained on the CTB, however, this segmen-
tation differs with the alignment in the WA cor-
pus, since its two components are aligned to two
different English words. Our hypothesis was that
the removal of these inconsistencies would benefit
machine translation performance (this is explained
further in Section 2.3), and we explored this idea
in this work.

This paper focuses on optimizing Chinese WS
for Chinese-English SMT, but both the research
method and the proposed solution are language-
independent. They can be applied to other lan-
guage pairs.

The major contributions of this paper include,

• analyze the CTB WS scheme for Chinese-
English SMT;

• propose a lexical word splitter to refine the
WS;

• achieve a BLEU improvement over a baseline
Stanford word segmenter, and a state-of-the-
art extension, on Chinese-English OpenMT
corpora.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
first, Section 2 analyzes WS using a WA corpus;
next, Section 3 proposes a lexical word splitter
to refine WS; then, Section 4 evaluates the pro-
posed method on end-to-end SMT as well as word
segmentation and alignment; after that, Section 5
compares this work to related work; finally, Sec-
tion 6 concludes this paper.

2 Analysis of a General-purpose
Automatic Word Segmenter

This section first briefly describes the GALE WA
corpus, then presents an analysis of the WS arising
from a CTB-standard word segmenter with refer-
ence to the segmentation of the atomic blocks in
the GALE WA corpus, finally the impact of the
findings on SMT is discussed.

2.1 GALE WA corpus

The GALE WA corpus was developed by the
LDC, and was used as training data in the DARPA
GALE global autonomous language exploitation
program 5. The corpus incorporates linguistic
knowledge into word aligned text to help improve
automatic WA and translation quality. It em-
ploys two annotation schemes: alignment and tag-
ging (Li et al., 2010). Alignment identifies min-
imum translation units and translation relations;
tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-
specific features to the alignment annotation. For
example, the sample shown in Figure 1 carries tags
on both alignment edges and tokens.

The GALE WA corpus contains 18,057 man-
ually word aligned Chinese and English parallel
sentences which are extracted from newswire and
web blogs. Table 1 presents the statistics on the
corpus. One third of the sentences are approxi-
mately newswire text, and the remainder consists
of web blogs.

2.2 Analysis of WS

In order to produce a Chinese word segmenta-
tion consistent with the CTB standard we used the
Stanford Chinese word segmenter with a model
trained on the CTB corpus. We will refer to this
as the ‘CTB segmenter’ in the rest of this paper.

The Chinese sentences in the GALE WA cor-
pus were first segmented by the CTB segmenter,
and the predicted words were compared against
the atomic blocks with respect to the granularity of
segmentation. The analysis falls into the following
three categories, two of which may be potentially
harmful to SMT:

• Fully consistent: the word locates within the
block of one atomic alignment edge. For ex-
ample, in Figure 2(a), the Chinese text has

represents an atomic block. SEM (semantic), GIS (grammatically inferred semantic) and FUN (function)

four atomic blocks; the CTB segmenter pro-
duces five words which all locate within the
blocks, so they are all small enough.

• Alignment inconsistent: the word aligns to
more than one atomic block, but the target
expression is contiguous, allowing for cor-
rect phrase pair extraction (Zens et al., 2002).
For example, in Figure 2(b), the characters in
the word “shuang fang”, which is produced
by the CTB segmenter, contains two atomic
blocks, but the span of the target “to both
side” is continuous, therefore the phrase pair
“shuang fang ||| to both sides” can be ex-
tracted.

• Alignment inconsistent and extraction hin-
dered: the word aligned to more than one
atomic block, and the target expression is not
contiguous, which hinders correct phrase pair
extractions. For example, in Figure 2(c), the
word “zeng chan” has to be split in order to
match the target language.

Table 2 shows the statistics of the three cat-
egories of CTB WS on the GALE WA corpus.
90.74% of the words are fully consistent, while the
remaining 9.26% of the words have inconsistent
alignments. 74.60% of the sentences contain this
problem. The category with inconsistent align-
ment and extraction hindered only accounts for
0.46% of the words, affecting 9.06% of the sen-
tences.

2.3 Impact of WS on SMT

The word alignment has a direct impact on the na-
ture of both the translation model, and lexical re-
ordering model in a phrase-base SMT system. The
words in last two categories are all longer than an
atomic block, which might lead to problems in the
word alignment in two ways:

• First, longer words tend to be more sparse in
the training corpus, thus the estimated distri-
bution of their target phrases are less accu-
rate.

• Second, the alignment from them to target
sides are one-to-many, which is much more
complicated and requires fertilized alignment
models such as IBM model 4 – 6 (Och and
Ney, 2000).

The words in the category of “fully consistent”
can be aligned using simple models, because the
alignment from them to the target side are one-to-
one or many-to-one, and simple alignment models
such as IBM model 1, IBM model 2 and HMM
model are sufficient (Och and Ney, 2000).

3 Refining the Word Segmentation

In the last subsection, it was shown that 74.60% of
parallel sentences were affected by issues related
to under-segmentation of the corpus. Our hypoth-
esis is that if these words are split into pieces that
match English words, the accuracy of the unsuper-
vised WA as well as the translation quality will be
improved. To achieve this, we adopt a splitting

strategy, based on a supervised learning approach,
to re-segment the corpus. This subsection first for-
malizes the task, and then presents the approach.

3.1 Word splitting task

The word splitting task is formalized as a sequence
labeling task as follows: each word (represented
by a sequence of characters x = x1 . . . xT where
T is the length of sample) produced by the CTB
segmenter is a sample, and a corresponding se-
quence of binary boundary labels y = y1 . . . yT
is the learning target,

yt =


1 if there is a split point

between ct and ct−1;
0 otherwise.

(1)

The sequence of boundary labels is derived
from the gold WA annotation as follows: for a
sequence of two atomic blocks, where the first
character of the second block is xt, then the la-

bel yt = 1. Figure 3 presents several samples ex-
tracted from the examples in Figure 2.

Each word sample may have no split point, one
split point or multiple split points, depending on
the gold WA annotation. Table 3 shows the statis-
tics of the word splitting data set which is built
from the GALE manual WA corpus and the CTB
segmenter’s output, where 2000 randomly sam-
pled sentences are taken as a held-out test set.

3.2 CRF approach

This paper employs a condition random field
(CRF) to solve this sequence labeling task (Laf-
ferty et al., 2001). A linear-chain CRF defines the
conditional probability of y given x as,

PΛ(y|x) = 1
Zx

(
T∑

t=1

∑
k

λkfk(yt−1, yt,x, t)),

(2)
where Λ = {λ1, . . .} are parameters, Zx is a per-
input normalization that makes the probability of
all state sequences sum to one; fk(yt−1, yt,x, t) is
a feature function which is often a binary-valued
sparse feature. The training of CRF model is to
maximize the likelihood of training data together
with a regularization penalty to avoid over-fitting
as (Peng et al., 2004; Peng and McCallum, 2006),

Λ∗ = argmax
Λ

(
∑

i

logPΛ(yi|xi)−
∑

k

λ2k
2δ2k

),

(3)
where (x,y) are training samples; the hyperparam-
eter δk can be understood as the variance of the
prior distribution of λk. When predicting the la-
bels of test samples, the CRF decoder searches for
the optimal label sequence y∗ that maximizes the
conditional probability,

y∗ = argmax
y

PΛ(y|x). (4)

In (Chang et al., 2008) a method is proposed to
select an appropriate level of segmentation gran-
ularity (in practical terms, to encourage smaller
segments). We call their method “length tuner”.
The following artificial feature is introduced into
the learned CRF model:

f0(x, yt−1, yt, 1) =
{

1 if yt = +1
0 otherwise

(5)

The weight λ0 of this feature is set by hand to
bias the output of CRF model. By way of expla-
nation, a very large positive λ0 will cause every
character to be segmented, or conversely a very
large negative λ0 will inhibit the output of segmen-
tation boundaries. In their experiments, λ0 = 2

was used to force a CRF segmenter to adopt an in-
termediate granularity between character and the
CTB WS scheme. Compared to the length tuner,
our proposed method exploits lexical knowledge
about word splitting, and we will therefore refer to
it as the “lexical word splitter” or “lexical splitter”
for short.

3.3 Feature Set

The features fk(yt−1, yt,x, t) we used include the
WS features from the Chinese Stanford word seg-
menter and a set of extended features described
below. The WS features are included because the
target split points may share some common char-
acteristics with the boundaries in the CTB WS
scheme.

The extended features consists of four types –
named entities, word frequency, word length and
character-level unsupervised WA. For each type of
the feature, the value and value concatenated with
previous or current character are taken as sparse
features (see Table 4 for details). The real val-
ues of word frequency, word length and character-
level unsupervised WA are converted into sparse
features due to the routine of CRF model.

The character-level unsupervised alignment
feature is inspired by the related works of unsu-
pervised bilingual WS (Xu et al., 2008; Chung and
Gildea, 2009; Nguyen et al., 2010; Michael et al.,
2011). The idea is that the character-level WA can
approximately capture the counterpart English ex-
pression of each Chinese token, and source tokens
aligned to different target expressions should be
split into different words (see Figure 4 for an illus-
tration).

The values of the character-level alignment fea-
tures are obtained through building a dictionary.
First, unsupervised WA is performed on the SMT
training corpus where the Chinese sentences are
treated as sequences of characters; then, the Chi-
nese sentences are segmented by CTB segmenter
and a dictionary of segmented words are built; fi-
nally, for each word in the dictionary, the relative
frequency of being split at a certain position is cal-

the training corpus.

4 Experiments

In the last section we found that 9.26% of words
produced by the CTB segmenter have the poten-
tial to cause problems for SMT, and propose a
lexical word splitter to address this issue through
segmentation refinement. This section contains
experiments designed to empirically evaluate the
proposed lexical word splitter in three aspects:
first, whether the WS accuracy is improved; sec-

ond, whether the accuracy of the unsupervised WA
during training SMT systems is improved; third,
whether the end-to-end translation quality is im-
proved.

This section first describes the experimental
methodology, then presents the experimental re-
sults, and finally illustrates the operation of our
proposed method using a real example.

4.1 Experimental Methodology

4.1.1 Experimental Corpora

The GALE manual WA corpus and the Chinese to
English corpus from the shared task of the NIST
open machine translation (OpenMT) 2006 evalua-
tion 6 were employed as the experimental corpus
(Table 5).

The experimental corpus for WS was con-
structed by first segmenting 2000 held out sen-
tences from the GALE manual WA corpus with
the Stanford segmenter, and then refining the seg-
mentation with the gold alignment annotation. For
example, the gold segmentation for the examples
in Figure 2 is presented in Figure 5. Note that
this test corpus is intended to represent an oracle
segmentation for our proposed method, and serves
primarily to gauge the improvement of our method
over the baseline Stanford segmenter, relative to
an upper bound.

The experimental corpus for unsupervised WA
was the union set of the NIST OpenMT training
set and the 2000 test sentence pairs from GALE
WA corpus. We removed the United Nations cor-
pus from the NIST OpenMT constraint training re-
sources because it is out of domain.

The main result of this paper is the evaluation
of the end-to-end performance of an SMT sys-
tem. The experimental corpus for this task was
the NIST OpenMT corpus. The data set of the
NIST evaluation 2002 was used as a development
set for MERT tuning (Och, 2003), and the remain-
ing data sets of the NIST evaluation from 2003 to
2006 were used as test sets. The English sentences
were tokenized by Stanford toolkit 7 and converted
to lowercase.

4.1.2 Evaluation

The performance of WS was measured by pre-
cision, recall and F1 of gold words (Sproat and
Emerson, 2003),

The performance of unsupervised WA in the
SMT training procedure was measured through
alignment error rate (AER)(Och and Ney, 2000;
Liang et al., 2006). Sure alignment edges and
possible alignment edges were not distinguished
in this paper as no such tags are found in GALE
manual WA corpus.

The performance of SMT was measured using
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

corenlp.shtml

4.1.3 Baseline Methods

Two Chinese WS methods were taken as the base-
line methods in this paper. One method was the
CTB segmenter, that is, Stanford Chinese word
segmenter with the model trained on CTB corpus.
The other method was the length tuner in (Chang
et al., 2008), which added a constant into the con-
fidence scores of a trained CRF word segmenter to
encourage it to output more word boundaries (see
Section 3.2 for details).

4.1.4 Implementation and Parameter settings

The proposed lexical word splitter was imple-
mented on the CRF model toolkit released with
the Stanford segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005). The
regularity parameters δk are set to be 3, the same
as the Stanford segmenter, because no significant
performance improvements were observed by tun-
ing that parameter.

To extract features for the word splitter, the
Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al.,
2005)8 was employed to obtain the tags of named
entities. Word frequencies were caculated from
the source side of SMT training corpus. The
character-level unsupervised alignment was con-
ducted using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)9.

The length tuner reused the CRF model of CTB
segmenter. The parameter λ0 was tuned through
the grid search in (Chang et al., 2008), that is, ob-
serving the BLEU score on the SMT development
set varing from λ0 = 0 to λ0 = 32. The grid
search showed that λ0 = 2 was optimal, agreeing
with the value in (Chang et al., 2008).

Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)10, a state-of-the-art
phrase-based SMT system, was employed to per-
form end-to-end SMT experiments. GIZA++ was
employed to perform unsupervised WA.

4.2 Experimental Results

4.2.1 Word Segmentation

The WS performance of CTB segmenter, length
tuner and the proposed lexical splitter are pre-
sented in Table 6. The proposed method achieves
the highest scores on all the criterion of F1, preci-
sion and recall. The length tuner outperforms the
CTB segmenter in terms of recall, but with lower
precision.

4.2.2 Word Alignment

The WA performance of the CTB segmenter,
length tuner and the proposed lexical spliter is pre-
sented in Table 7. Both lexical splitter and length
tuner outperform the CTB segmenter, indicating
the splitting words into smaller pieces can improve
the accuracy of unsupervised WA. This result sup-
ports the finding in (Chang et al., 2008) that the
segment size from CTB WS is too large for SMT.
In addition, the proposed lexical splitter signifi-
cantly outperforms the length tuner.

4.2.3 Machine Translation

The end-to-end SMT performance of CTB seg-
menter, length tuner and the proposed lexical
spliter are presented in Table 8. Each experiment
was performed three times, and the average BLEU
and standard derivation were calculated, because
there is randomness in the results from MERT.
The proposed lexical splitter outperformed the two
baselines on all the test sets, and achieves an
average improvement of 0.63 BLEU percentage
points, indicating that the proposed method can
effectively improve the translation quality. The
length tuner also outperforms the CTB segmenter,
but the average improvement is 0.15 BLEU per-
centage points, much less than the proposed meth-
ods.

4.3 Analysis

Figure 6 presents an example from the test cor-
pus, which demonstrates how the proposed lexical
splitter splits words more accurately than the base-
line length tuner method. Two words in the seg-
mentation result of the CTB segmenter are wor-
thy of attention. The first one is “yang nian”(the
year of goat), the lexical splitter split this word and

got the right translation, while the length tuner did
not split it. The second is “rong jing”(booming or
prosperity), the length tuner split this word, which
resulted in wrong translations, while the lexical
splitter avoided this mistake.

5 Comparison to Related Work

The most similar work in the literature to the pro-
posed method is the the length tuner method pro-
posed by (Chang et al., 2008). This method also
encourages the generation of more words during
segmentation by using a single parameter that can
be use to control segment length. Our method dif-
fers from theirs in that it is able to acquire vocabu-
lary knowledge from word alignments that can be
used to more accurately split words into segments
suitable for machine translation.

There is large volume of research using bilin-
gual unsupervised and semi-supervised WS to ad-
dress the problem of optimizing WS for SMT (Xu
et al., 2008; Chung and Gildea, 2009; Nguyen et
al., 2010; Michael et al., 2011). The main differ-
ence with our approach is that they use automatic
WA results, most often obtained using the same
tools as are used in training SMT systems. One of
the main problems of using unsupervised WA is
that it is noisy, and therefore, employing iterative
optimization methods to refine the results of unsu-
pervised WA is a key issue in their research, for
example boosting (Ma and Way, 2009; Michael et
al., 2011), expectation maximization (Chung and
Gildea, 2009), Bayesian sampling (Xu et al., 2008;
Nguyen et al., 2010), or heuristic search (Zhao et
al., 2013). Nevertheless, noisy WA makes both
analyzing WS and improving SMT quality quite
hard. In contrast, by using manual WA, we can
clearly analyze the segmentation problems (Sec-
tion 2), and train supervised models to solve the
problem (Section 3).

As far as we are aware, among related work
on WS, our method achieves the highest BLEU
improvement relative to the start-of-the-art WS –
the Stanford Chinese word segmenter – on the
Chinese-English OpenMT corpora. The meth-
ods proposed in (Ma and Way, 2009; Chung
and Gildea, 2009) fail to outperform the Stan-
ford Chinese word segmenter on Chinese-English
OpenMT corpora. The length tuner method pro-
posed in (Chang et al., 2008) is less effective to
ours according to the experimental results in this
paper.

6 Conclusion

This paper is concerned with the role of word
segmentation in Chinese-to-English SMT. We ex-
plored the use of a manually annotated word align-
ment corpus to refine word segmentation for ma-
chine translation. Based on an initial finding that
74.60% of running sentences in the WA corpus
have segmentation inconsistent with a gold WA
annotation, we proposed a supervised lexical re-
segmentation model to modify the WS in order to
relieve these issues.

Our main experimental results show that the
proposed approach is capable of improving both
alignment quality and end-to-end translation qual-

ity. The proposed method achieved the highest
BLEU score relative to a number of respectable
baseline systems that included the Stanford word
segmenter, and an improved Stanford word seg-
menter that could be tuned for segment length. No
language-specific techniques other than a manu-
ally aligned corpus were employed in this paper,
thus the approach can applied to other SMT lan-
guage pairs that require WS.

In the future, we plan to explore combining
multiple source words which are aligned to the
same target words. This is the symmetric topic
of the post word splitting which is studied in this
paper. The effect of this word combination oper-

ation on SMT is non-trivial. On one hand, it can
reduce the ambiguity in the source side. On the
other hand, it may cause sparseness problems.
