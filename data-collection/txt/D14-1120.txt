Abstract 

In this paper we first exploit cash-tags (“$” fol-
lowed by stocks’ ticker symbols) in Twitter to 
build a stock network, where nodes are stocks 
connected by edges when two stocks co-occur 
frequently in tweets. We then employ a labeled 
topic model to jointly model both the tweets and 
the network structure to assign each node and 
each edge a topic respectively. This Semantic 
Stock Network (SSN) summarizes discussion 
topics about stocks and stock relations. We fur-
ther show that social sentiment about stock 
(node) topics and stock relationship (edge) topics 
are predictive of each stock’s market. For predic-
tion, we propose to regress the topic-sentiment 
time-series and the stock’s price time series. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate that topic senti-
ments from close neighbors are able to help im-
prove the prediction of a stock markedly. 

1 Introduction 
Existing research has shown the usefulness of 
public sentiment in social media across a wide 
range of applications. Several works showed so-
cial media as a promising tool for stock market 
prediction (Bollen et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012; 
Si et al., 2013). However, the semantic relation-
ships between stocks have not yet been explored. 
In this paper, we show that the latent semantic 
relations among stocks and the associated social 
sentiment can yield a better prediction model.  

On Twitter, cash-tags (e.g., $aapl for Apple 
Inc.) are used in a tweet to indicate that the tweet 
talks about the stocks or some other related in-
formation about the companies. For example, 
one tweet containing cash-tags: $aapl and $goog 
(Google Inc.), is “$AAPL is loosing customers. 
everybody is buying android phones! $GOOG”. 
Such joint mentions directly reflect some kind of 
latent relationship between the involved stocks, 

which motivates us to exploit such information 
for the stock prediction.  

We propose a notion of Semantic Stock Net-
work (SSN) and use it to summarize the latent 
semantics of stocks from social discussions. To 
our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 
cash-tags in Twitter for mining stock semantic 
relations. Our stock network is constructed based 
on the co-occurrences of cash-tags in tweets. 
With the SSN, we employ a labeled topic model 
to jointly model both the tweets and the network 
structure to assign each node and each edge a 
topic respectively. Then, a lexicon-based senti-
ment analysis method is used to compute a sen-
timent score for each node and each edge topic. 
To predict each stock’s performance (i.e., the 
up/down movement of the stock’s closing price), 
we use the sentiment time-series over the SSN 
and the price time series in a vector autoregres-
sion (VAR) framework.  

We will show that the neighbor relationships in 
SSN give very useful insights into the dynamics 
of the stock market. Our experimental results 
demonstrate that topic sentiments from close 
neighbors of a stock can help improve the predic-
tion of the stock market markedly. 

2 Related work 
2.1 Social Media & Economic Indices 
Many algorithms have been proposed to produce 
meaningful insights from massive social media 
data. Related works include detecting and sum-
marizing events (Weng and Lee, 2011; Weng et 
al., 2011; Baldwin et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2012) 
and analyzing sentiments about them (Pang and 
Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012), etc. Some recent literature 
also used Twitter as a sentiment source for stock 
market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011; Si et al., 
2013). This paper extends beyond the correlation 
between social media and stock market, but fur-

1139



ther exploits the social relations between stocks 
from the social media context. 
  Topic modeling has been widely used in social 
media. Various extensions of the traditional LDA 
model (Blei et al., 2003) has been proposed for 
modeling social media data (Wang et al., 2011, 
Jo and Oh, 2011; Liu et al., 2007; Mei et al., 
2007; Diao et al., 2012). Ramage et al. (2009; 
2011) presented a partially supervised learning 
model called Labeled LDA to utilize supervision 
signal in topic modeling. Ma et al. (2013) pre-
dicted the topic popularity based on hash-tags on 
Twitter in a classification framework. 

2.2 Financial Networks for Stock 
Financial network models study the correlations 
of stocks in a graph-based view (Tse et al., 2010; 
Mantegna, 1999; Vandewalle et al., 2001; On-
nela et al., 2003; Bonanno et al., 2001). The usu-
al approach is to measure the pairwise correla-
tion of stocks’ historical price series and then 
connect the stocks based on correlation strengths 
to build a correlation stock network (CSN). 

However, our approach leverages social media 
posts on stock tickers. The rationale behind is 
that micro-blogging activities have been shown 
to be highly correlated with the stock market 
(Ruiz et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2012). It is more 
informative, granular to incorporate latest devel-
opments of the market as reflected in social me-
dia instead of relying on stocks’ historical price.  

3 Semantic Stock Network (SSN) 
3.1 Construction of SSN 
We collected five months (Nov. 2 2012 - Apr. 3 
2013) of English tweets for a set of stocks in the 
Standard & Poor's 100 list via Twitter’s REST 
API, using cash-tags as query keywords. For 
preprocessing, we removed tweets mentioning 
more than five continuous stock tickers as such 
tweets usually do not convey much meaning for 

our task. Finally, we obtained 629,977 tweets in 
total. Table 1 shows the top five most frequent 
stocks jointly mentioned with Apple Inc. in our 
dataset. Formally, we define the stock network as 
an undirected graph 𝐺 = {𝑉 , 𝐸}. The node set 
𝑉 comprises of stocks, 𝑒𝑢,𝑣 ∈ 𝐸  stands for the 
edge between stock nodes 𝑢 and 𝑣 and the edge 
weight is the number of co-occurrences. On ex-
ploring the co-occurrence statistics in pilot stud-
ies, we set a minimum weight threshold of 400 to 
filter most non-informative edges. Figure 1 
demonstrates a segment of the stock network 
constructed from our dataset. 

3.2 Semantic Topics over the Network 
Figure 2 illustrates our annotation for each tweet. 
For a tweet, 𝑑 with three cash-tags: {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3}, 
we annotate  with the label set, 𝐿𝑑 =
 {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3, 𝑒1,2, 𝑒1,3, 𝑒2,3}. (𝑒1,2 is “aapl_goog” 
if 𝑣1is “aapl” and 𝑣2 is “goog”). Then, the topic 
assignments of words in 𝑑 are constrained to top-
ics indexed by its label set, 𝐿𝑑. Given the annota-
tions as labels, we use the Labeled LDA model 
(Ramage et al., 2009) to jointly learn the topics 
over nodes and edges. Labeled-LDA assumes 
that the set of topics are the distinct labels in a 
labeled set of documents, and each label corre-
sponds to a unique topic. Similar to LDA (Blei et 
al., 2003), Labeled-LDA models each document 
as an admixture of latent topics and generates 
each word from a chosen topic. Moreover, La-
beled-LDA incorporates supervision by simply 
constraining the model to use only those topics 
that correspond to a document’s observed label 
set (Ramage et al., 2009). For model inference, 
we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Bishop, 2006) 
and the symmetric Dirichlet Priors are set to: 
𝜂 = 0.01, 𝛼 = 0.01 as suggested in (Ramage et 
al., 2010). The Gibbs Sampler is given as: 

𝑝(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑘|𝑧−𝑖)~
 𝑁(𝑑𝑖,𝑘)−1+ 𝛼

𝑁(𝑑𝑖,∗)−1+ |𝐿𝑑𝑖|∗𝛼
∗ 𝑁(𝑘,𝑤𝑖)−1+𝜂𝑁(𝑘,∗)−1+ |𝑉 |∗𝜂

 (1) 
where 𝑁(𝑑𝑖, 𝑘) is the number of words in 𝑑𝑖 as-
signed to topic 𝑘, while 𝑁(𝑑𝑖,∗) is the marginal-
ized sum. |𝐿𝑑𝑖 | is the size of label subset of 𝑑𝑖.

𝑁(𝑘, 𝑤) is the term frequency of word 𝑤 in topic 
𝑘. |𝑉 | is the vocabulary size. The subscript -1 is 
used to exclude the count assignment of the cur-
rent word 𝑤𝑖 . The posterior on the document’s 
topic distribution {𝜃𝑑,𝑘} and topic’s word distri-
bution {𝛽𝑘,𝑤} can be estimated as follows: 

𝜃𝑑,𝑘 =  
𝑁(𝑑𝑖,𝑘)+ 𝛼

𝑁(𝑑𝑖,∗)+ |𝐿𝑑𝑖|∗𝛼
                (2) 

𝛽𝑘,𝑤 =  
𝑁(𝑘,𝑤𝑖)+𝜂

𝑁(𝑘,∗)+ |𝑉 |∗𝜂
                   (3) 

Later, parameters {𝛽𝑘,𝑤} will be used to compute 
the sentiment score for topics. 

3.3 Leveraging Sentiment over SSN for 
Stock Prediction 

We define a lexicon based sentiment score in the 
form of opinion polarity for each node-indexed 
and edge-indexed topic as follows: 

𝑆(𝑘) = ∑ 𝛽𝑘,𝑤
|𝑉 |

𝑤=1
𝑙(𝑤), 𝑆(𝑘) ∈ [−1,1]  (4) 

where 𝑙(𝑤) denotes the opinion polarity of word 
𝑤. 𝛽𝑘,𝑤  is the word probability of 𝑤 in topic 𝑘 
(Eq.3). Based on an opinion lexicon 𝑂, 𝑙(𝑤) = 
+1 if 𝑤 ∈ 𝑂𝑝𝑜𝑠, 𝑙(𝑤) = -1 if 𝑤 ∈ 𝑂𝑛𝑒𝑔 and 𝑙(𝑤) 
= 0 otherwise. We use the opinion English lexi-
con contributed by Hu and Liu (2004).  

Considering the inherent dynamics of both the 
stock markets and social sentiment, we organize 
the tweets into daily based sub-sets according to 
their timestamps to construct one 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡  ( 𝑡 ∈
[1, 𝑇 ]) for each day. Then, we apply a Labeled 
LDA for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 and compute the sentiment 
scores for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 ’s nodes and edges. This 
yields a sentiment time series for the node, 𝑣 , 
{𝑆(𝑣)1, 𝑆(𝑣)2, … , 𝑆(𝑣)𝑇 } and for the edge, 𝑒𝑢,𝑣, 
{𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)1, 𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)2, … , 𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)𝑇 } . We intro-
duce a vector autoregression model (VAR) 
(Shumway and Stoffer, 2011) by regressing sen-
timent time series together with the stock price 
time series to predict the up/down movement of 
the stock’s daily closing price. 

As usual in time series analysis, the regression 
parameters are learned during a training phase 
and then are used for forecasting under sliding 
windows, i.e., to train in period [𝑡, 𝑡 + 𝑤] and to 
predict on time 𝑡 + 𝑤 + 1. Here the window size 
𝑤 refers to the number of days in series used in 
model training. A VAR model for two variables 
{𝑥𝑡} and {𝑦𝑡} can be written as: 

𝑦𝑡 =  ∑ ( 𝑖
𝑥𝑥𝑡−𝑖 + 𝑖

𝑦𝑦𝑡−𝑖)
𝑙𝑎𝑔

𝑖=1
+ 𝜀𝑡  (5) 

where {𝜀} are white noises, {𝜗} are model pa-
rameters, and  notes the time steps of histori-
cal information to use. In our experiment, {𝑦𝑡} is 
the target stock’s price time series, {𝑥𝑡} is the 
covariate sentiment/price time series, and we will 

try ∈ 2,3 . We use the “dse” library in R 
language to fit our VAR model based on least 
square regression. 

4 Experiments 
4.1 Tweets in Relation to the Stock Market 
Micro-blogging activities are well correlated 
with the stock market. Figure 3 shows us how the 
Twitter activities response to a report announce-
ment of $aapl (Jan. 23 2013). The report was 
made public soon after the market closed at 
4:00pm, while the tweets volume rose about two 
hours earlier and reached the peak at the time of 
announcement, then it arrived the second peak at 
the time near the market’s next opening (9:30am). 
By further accumulating all days’ tweet volume 
in our dataset as hourly based statistics, we plot 
the volume distribution in Figure 4. Again, we 
note that trading activities are well reflected by 
tweet activities. The volume starts to rise drasti-
cally two or three hours before the market opens, 
and then reaches a peak at 9:00pm. It drops dur-
ing the lunch time and reaches the second peak 
around 2:00pm (after lunch). Above observations 
clearly show that market dynamics are discussed 
in tweets and the content in tweets’ discussion 
very well reflects the fine-grained aspects of 
stock market trading, opening and closing.

4.2 Stock Prediction 
This section demonstrates the effectiveness of 
our SSN based approach for stock prediction. 
We leverage the sentiment time-series on two 
kinds of topics from SSN: 1). Node topic from 
the target stock itself, 2). Neighbor node/edge 
topics. We note that the price correlation stock 
network (CSN) (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2001; Man-
tegna, 1999) also defines neighbor relationships 
based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient 
(Tse et al., 2010) between pair of past price se-
ries (We get the stock dataset from Yahoo! Fi-
nance, between Nov. 2 2012 and Apr. 3 2013).  
 We build a two variables VAR model to pre-
dict the movement of a stock’s daily closing 
price. One variable is the price time series of the 
target stock ({𝑦𝑡} in Eq.5); another is the covari-
ate sentiment/price time series ({𝑥𝑡}  in Eq.5). 
We setup two baselines according to the sources 
of the covariate time series as follows: 
1. Covariate price time series from CSN, we try 

the price time series from the target stock’s 
closest neighbor which takes the maximum 
historical price correlation in CSN. 

2. With no covariate time series, we try the tar-
get stock’s price only based on the univariate 
autoregression (AR) model. 

 To summarize, we try different covariate sen-
timent (𝑆(. )) or price (𝑃(. )) time series from 
SSN or CSN together with the target stock’s 

price time series (𝑃 ∗) to predict the movement of 
one day ahead price (𝑃∗∗). The accuracy is com-
puted based on the correctness of the predicted 
directions as follows, i.e., if the prediction ∗∗ 
takes the same direction as the actual price value, 
we increment #(𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑) by 1, #(𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡) is 
the total number of test.  

𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = #(𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑)
#(𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡)

       (6) 
 Figure 5 details the prediction of $aapl on dif-
ferent training window sizes of [15, 60] and lags. 
{𝑆(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙), 𝑆(𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔), 𝑆(𝑚𝑠𝑓𝑡), 𝑆(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙_𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔)} are 
from SSN, 𝑃(𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑙)  is from CSN ($dell (Dell 
Inc.) takes the maximum price correlation score 
of 0.92 with $aapl), and 𝑃 ∗ =  𝑃(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙)  is the 
univariate AR model, using the target stock’s 
price time series only. Table 2 further summariz-
es the performance comparison of different ap-
proaches reporting the average (and best) predic-
tion accuracies over all time windows and dif-
ferent lag settings. Comparing to the univariate 
AR model (𝑃∗ only), we see that the sentiment 
based time-series improve performances signifi-
cantly. Among SSN sentiment based approach-
es, the 𝑆(𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔) helps improve the performance 
mostly and gets the best accuracy of 0.78 on  
2 and training window size of 53. On average, 
𝑆(𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔) achieves a net gain over 𝑆(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙) in the 
range of 29% with lag 2 (0.62 = 1.29 x 0.48) and 
14% with lag 3 (0.57 = 1.14 x 0.50). Also, 
𝑆(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙_𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔)  performs better than 𝑆(𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑙) . 
The result indicates that $aapl’s stock perfor-
mance is highly influenced by its competitor. 
𝑃(𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑙) also performs well, but we will see rela-
tionships from CSN may not be so reliable. 

We further summarize some other prediction 
cases in Table 3 to show how different covariate 
sentiment sources ( 𝑆(. ) ) and price sources 
(𝑃(. )) from their closest neighbor nodes help 
predict their stocks, which gives consistent con-
clusions. We compute the 𝑡-test for SSN based 
prediction accuracies against that of CSN or 
price only based approaches among all testing

window sizes ([15, 60]), and find that SSN based 
approaches are significantly (𝑝 -value < 0.001) 
better than others.  

We note that tweet volumes of most S&P100 
stocks are too small for effective model building, 
as tweets discuss only popular stocks, other 
stocks are not included due to their deficient 
tweet volume.  

We make the following observations: 
  1. CSN may find some correlated stock pairs 
like $ebay and $amzn, $wmt and $tgt, but some-
times, it also produces pairs without real-world 
relationships like $tgt and $vz, $qcom and $pfe, 
etc. In contrast, SSN is built on large statistics of 
human recognition in social media, which is like-
ly to be more reliable as shown. 
  2. Sentiment based approaches {𝑆(⋅)} consist-
ently perform better than all price based ones 
{𝑃∗, 𝑃 (⋅)}. For 𝑆(⋅)  based predictions, senti-
ment discovered from the target stock’s closest 
neighbors in SSN performs best in general. This 
empirical finding dovetails with qualitative re-
sults in the financial analysis community (Mizik 
& Jacobson, 2003; Porter, 2008), where compa-
nies’ market performances are more likely to be 
influenced by their competitors. But for Google, 
its stock market is not so much influenced by 
other companies (it gets the best prediction accu-
racy on 𝑆(𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑔), i.e., the internal factor). It can 
be explained by Google Inc.’s relatively stable 
revenue structure, which is well supported by its 

leading position in the search engine market. 
  3. The business of offline companies like Target 
Corp. ($tgt) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ($wmt) are 
highly affected by online companies like $amzn. 
Although competition exists between $tag and 
$wmt, their performances seem to be affected 
more by a third-party like $amzn (In Table 3, 

 predicts the best for both). Not surpris-
ingly, these offline companies have already been 
trying to establish their own online stores and 
markets. 

5 Conclusion 
This paper proposed to build a stock network 
from co-occurrences of ticker symbols in tweets. 
The properties of SSN reveal some close rela-
tionships between involved stocks, which pro-
vide good information for predicting stocks 
based on social sentiment. Our experiments show 
that SSN is more robust than CSN in capturing 
the neighbor relationships, and topic sentiments 
from close neighbors of a stock significantly im-
prove the prediction of the stock market.
