Abstract
We present a novel approach for translation
model (TM) adaptation using phrase train-
ing. The proposed adaptation procedure is ini-
tialized with a standard general-domain TM,
which is then used to perform phrase training
on a smaller in-domain set. This way, we bias
the probabilities of the general TM towards
the in-domain distribution. Experimental re-
sults on two different lectures translation tasks
show significant improvements of the adapted
systems over the general ones. Additionally,
we compare our results to mixture modeling,
where we report gains when using the sug-
gested phrase training adaptation method.

1 Introduction

The task of domain-adaptation attempts to exploit
data mainly drawn from one domain (e.g. news,
parliamentary discussion) to maximize the perfor-
mance on the test domain (e.g. lectures, web fo-
rums). In this work, we focus on translation model
(TM) adaptation. A prominent approach in recent
work is weighting at different levels of granularity.
Foster and Kuhn (2007) perform weighting at the
corpus level, where different corpora receive differ-
ent weights and are then combined using mixture
modeling. A finer grained weighting is that of Mat-
soukas et al. (2009), who weight each sentence in the
bitexts using features of meta-information and opti-
mize a mapping from the feature vectors to weights
using a translation quality measure.

In this work, we propose to perform TM adapta-
tion using phrase training. We start from a general-
domain phrase table and adapt the probabilities by

training on an in-domain data. Thus, we achieve
direct phrase probabilities adaptation as opposed to
weighting. Foster et al. (2010) perform weighting
at the phrase level, assigning each phrase pair a
weight according to its relevance to the test domain.
They compare phrase weighting to a “flat” model,
where the weight directly approximates the phrase
probability. In their experiments, the weighting
method performs better than the flat model, there-
fore, they conclude that retaining the original rela-
tive frequency probabilities of the TM is important
for good performance. The “flat” model of Foster
et al. (2010) is similar to our work. We differ in
the following points: (i) we use the same procedure
to perform the phrase training based adaptation and
the search thus avoiding inconsistencies between the
two; (ii) we do not directly interpolate the original
statistics with the new ones, but use a training pro-
cedure to manipulate the original statistics. We per-
form experiments on the publicly available IWSLT
TED task, on both Arabic-to-English and German-
to-English lectures translation tracks. We compare
our suggested phrase training adaptation method to
a variety of baselines and show its effectiveness. Fi-
nally, we experiment with mixture modeling based
adaptation. We compare mixture modeling to our
adaptation method, and apply our method within a
mixture modeling framework.

In Section 2, we present the phrase training
method and explain how it is utilized for adaptation.
Experimental setup including corpora statistics and
the SMT system are described in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 summarizes the phrase training adaptation re-
sults ending with a comparison to mixture modeling.

2 Phrase Training

The standard phrase extraction procedure in SMT
consists of two phases: (i) word-alignment training
(e.g., IBM alignment models), (ii) heuristic phrase
extraction and relative frequency based phrase trans-
lation probability estimation. In this work, we utilize
phrase training for the task of adaptation. We use
the forced alignment (FA) method (Wuebker et al.,
2010) to perform the phrase alignment training and
probability estimation. We perform phrase training
by running a normal SMT decoder on the training
data and constrain the translation to the given target
instance. Using n-best possible phrase segmentation
for each training instance, the phrase probabilities
are re-estimated over the output. Leaving-one-out is
used during the forced alignment procedure phase to
avoid over-fitting (Wuebker et al., 2010).

In the standard phrase training procedure, we
are given a training set y, from which an initial
heuristics-based phrase table p0y is generated. FA
training is then done over the training set y using the
phrases and probabilities in p0y (possibly updated by
the leaving-one-out method). Finally, re-estimation
of the phrase probabilities is done over the decoder
output, generating the FA phrase table p1. We ex-
plain next how to utilize FA training for adaptation.

2.1 Adaptation

In this work, we utilize phrase training for the task
of adaptation. The main idea is to generate the initial
phrase table required for FA using a general-domain
training data y′, thus resulting in p0y′ , and perform
the FA training over yIN , the in-domain training
data (instead of y′ in the standard procedure). This
way, we bias the probabilities of p0y′ towards the in-
domain distribution. We denote this new procedure
by Y’-FA-IN. This differs from the standard IN-FA-
IN by that we have more phrase pairs to use for FA.
Thus, we obtain phrase pairs relevant to IN in ad-
dition to “general” phrase pairs which were not ex-
tracted from IN, perhaps due to faulty word align-
ments. The probabilities of the general phrase table
will be tailored towards IN. In practice, we usually
have in-domain IN and other-domain OD data. We
denote by ALL the concatenation of IN and OD. To
adapt the ALL phrase table, we perform the FA pro-
cedure ALL-FA-IN. We also utilize leaving-one-out

to avoid over-fitting.
Another procedure we experimented with is

adapting the OD phrase table using FA over IN,
without leaving-one-out. We denote it by OD-FA0-
IN. In this FA scenario, we do not use leaving-one-
out as IN is not contained in OD, therefore, over-
fitting will not occur. By this procedure, we train
phrases from OD that are relevant for both OD and
IN, while the probabilities will be tailored to IN. In
this case, we do not expect improvements over the
IN based phrase table, but, improvements over OD
and reduction in the phrase table size.

We compare our suggested FA based adaptation
to the standard FA procedure.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Training Corpora

To evaluate the introduced methods experimentally,
we use the IWSLT 2011 TED Arabic-to-English and
German-to-English translation tasks. The IWSLT
2011 evaluation campaign focuses on the transla-
tion of TED talks, a collection of lectures on a
variety of topics ranging from science to culture.
For Arabic-to-English, the bilingual data consists
of roughly 100K sentences of in-domain TED talks
data and 8M sentences of “other”-domain United
Nations (UN) data. For the German-to-English task,
the data consists of 130K TED sentences and 2.1M
sentences of “other”-domain data assembled from
the news-commentary and the europarl corpora. For
language model training purposes, we use an addi-
tional 1.4 billion words (supplied as part of the cam-
paign monolingual training data).

The bilingual training and test data for the Arabic-
to-English and German-to-English tasks are sum-
marized in Table 11. The English data was tok-
enized and lowercased while the Arabic data was
tokenized and segmented using MADA v3.1 (Roth
et al., 2008) with the ATB scheme. The German
source is decompounded (Koehn and Knight, 2003)
and part-of-speech-based long-range verb reorder-
ing rules (Popović and Ney, 2006) are applied.

From Table 1, we note that using the general
data considerably reduces the number of out-of-

vocabulary (OOV) words. This comes with the price
of increasing the size of the training data by a factor
of more than 20. A simple concatenation of the cor-
pora might mask the phrase probabilities obtained
from the in-domain corpus, causing a deterioration
in performance. One way to avoid this contamina-
tion is by filtering the general corpus, but this dis-
cards phrase translations completely from the phrase
model. A more principled way is by adapting the
phrase probabilities of the full system to the domain
being tackled. We perform this by phrase training
the full phrase table over the in-domain training set.

3.2 Translation System

The baseline system is built using the open-source
SMT toolkit Jane 2.0, which provides a state-of-
the-art phrase-based SMT system (Wuebker et al.,
2012a). In addition to the phrase based decoder,
Jane 2.0 implements the forced alignment procedure
used in this work for the purpose of adaptation. We
use the standard set of models with phrase transla-
tion probabilities for source-to-target and target-to-
source directions, smoothing with lexical weights,
a word and phrase penalty, distance-based reorder-
ing and an n-gram target language model. The SMT
systems are tuned on the dev (dev2010) development
set with minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) us-

ing BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) accuracy measure
as the optimization criterion. We test the perfor-
mance of our system on the test (tst2010) and eval
(tst2011) sets using the BLEU and translation edit
rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) measures. We use
TER as an additional measure to verify the consis-
tency of our improvements and avoid over-tuning.
The Arabic-English results are case sensitive while
the German-English results are case insensitive.

4 Results

For TM training, we define three different sets: in-
domain (IN) which is the TED corpus, other-domain
(OD) which consists of the UN corpus for Arabic-
English and a concatenation of news-commentary
and europarl for German-English, and ALL which
consists of the concatenation of IN and OD. We ex-
periment with the following extraction methods:

• Heuristics: standard phrase extraction using
word-alignment training and heuristic phrase
extraction over the word alignment. The ex-
traction is performed for the three different
training data, IN, OD and ALL.

• FA standard: standard FA phrase training
where the same training set is used for initial
phrase table generation as well as the FA pro-
cedure. We perform the training on the three
different training sets and denote the resulting
systems by IN-FA, OD-FA and ALL-FA.

• FA adaptation: FA based adaptation phrase
training, where the initial table is generated
from some general data and the FA training is
performed on the IN data to achieve adapta-
tion. We perform two experiments, OD-FA0-
IN without leaving-one-out and ALL-FA-IN
with leaving-one-out.

The results of the various experiments over both
Arabic-English and German-English tasks are sum-
marized in Table 2. The usefulness of the OD
data differs between the Arabic-to-English and the
German-to-English translation tasks. For Arabic-to-
English, the OD system is 2.5%-4.3% BLEU worse
than the IN system, whereas for the German-to-
English task the differences between IN and OD are
smaller and range from 0.9% to 1.6% BLEU. The

inferior performance of the OD system can be re-
lated to noisy data or bigger discrepancy between
the OD data domain distribution and the IN distri-
bution. The ALL system performs according to the
usefulness of the OD training set, where for Arabic-
to-English we observe deterioration in performance
for all test sets and up-to -0.9% BLEU on the test
set. On the other hand, for German-to-English, the
ALL system is improving over IN where the biggest
improvement is observed on the eval set with +0.9%
BLEU improvement.

The standard FA procedure achieves mixed re-
sults, where IN-FA deteriorates the results over the
IN counterpart for Arabic-English, while improving
for German-English. ALL-FA performs comparably
to the ALL system on both tasks, while reducing the
phrase table size considerably. The OD-FA system
deteriorates the results in comparison to the OD sys-
tem in most cases, which is expected as training over
the OD set fits the phrase model on the OD domain,
making it perform worse on IN. (Wuebker et al.,
2012b) also report mixed results with FA training.

The FA adaptation results are summarized in the
last block of the experiments. The OD-FA0-IN im-
proves over the OD system, which means that the
training procedure was able to modify the OD prob-
abilities to perform well on the IN data. On the
German-to-English task, the OD-FA0-IN performs
comparably to the IN system, whereas for Arabic-
to-English OD-FA0-IN was able to close around half
of the gap between OD and IN.

The FA adapted ALL system (ALL-FA-IN) per-
forms best in our experiments, improving on both
BLEU and TER measures. In comparison to the
best heuristics system (IN for Arabic-English and
ALL for German-English), +0.4% BLEU and -0.6%
TER improvements are observed on the eval set for
Arabic-English. For German-English, the biggest
improvements are observed on TER with -0.8% on
test and -0.5% on eval. The results suggest that ALL-
FA-IN is able to learn more useful phrases than the
IN system and adjust the ALL phrase probabilities
towards the in-domain distribution.

4.1 Mixture Modeling

In this section, we compare our method to mixture
modeling based adaptation, in addition to applying
mixture modeling on top of our method. We focus
on linear interpolation (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) of
the in-domain (IN) and other-domain phrase tables,
where we vary the latter between the heuristically
extracted phrase table (OD) and the FA adapted one
(OD-FA0-IN). The interpolation weight is uniform
for the interpolated phrase tables (0.5). The results
of mixture modeling are summarized in Table 3. In
this table, we include the best heuristics based sys-
tem (Heuristicsbest) from Table 2 as a reference sys-
tem. The results on the eval set are omitted as they
show similar tendencies to the test set results.

Linear interpolation of IN and OD (IN,OD) is per-
forming well in our experiments, with big improve-
ments over the dev set, +1.0% BLEU for Arabic-to-
English and +0.4% BLEU for German-to-English.
On the test set, we observe smaller improvements.
Interpolating IN with the phrase training adapted
system OD-FA0-IN (IN,OD-FA0-IN) achieves ad-
ditional gains over the IN,OD system, the biggest
are observed on TER for German-to-English, with
-0.4% and -0.5% improvements on the dev and test
sets correspondingly.

Comparing heuristics based interpolation
(IN,OD) to our best phrase training adapted system
(ALL-FA-IN) shows mixed results. For Arabic-to-
English, the systems are comparable, while for the
German-to-English test set, IN,OD is +0.2% BLEU

better and +0.8% TER worse than ALL-FA-IN. We
hypothesize that for Arabic-to-English interpolation
is important due to the larger size of the OD data,
where it could reduce the masking of the IN training
data by the much larger OD data. Nevertheless,
as mentioned previously, using phrase training
adapted phrase table in a mixture setup consistently
improves over using heuristically extracted tables.

5 Conclusions

In this work, we propose a phrase training procedure
for adaptation. The phrase training is implemented
using the FA method. First, we extract a standard
phrase table using the whole available training data.
Using this table, we initialize the FA procedure and
perform training on the in-domain set.

Experiments are done on the Arabic-to-English
and German-to-English TED lectures translation
tasks. We show that the suggested procedure is im-
proving over unadapted baselines. On the Arabic-
to-English task, the FA adapted system is +0.9%
BLEU better than the full unadapted counterpart on
both test sets. Unlike the Arabic-to-English setup,
the German-to-English OD data is helpful and pro-
duces a strong unadapted baseline in concatenation
with IN. In this case, the FA adapted system achieves
BLEU improvements mainly on the development set
with +0.6% BLEU, on the test and eval sets, im-
provements of -0.8% and -0.6% TER are observed
correspondingly. As a side effect of the FA training
process, the size of the adapted phrase table is less
than 10% of the size of the full table.

Finally, we experimented with mixture model-
ing where improvements are observed over the un-
adapted baselines. The results show that using our
phrase training adapted OD table yields better per-
formance than using the heuristically extracted OD
in a mixture framework.
