Abstract

This paper presents a study of the impact
of using simple and complex morphological
clues to improve the classification of rare and
unknown words for parsing. We compare
this approach to a language-independent tech-
nique often used in parsers which is based
solely on word frequencies. This study is ap-
plied to three languages that exhibit different
levels of morphological expressiveness: Ara-
bic, French and English. We integrate infor-
mation about Arabic affixes and morphotac-
tics into a PCFG-LA parser and obtain state-
of-the-art accuracy. We also show that these
morphological clues can be learnt automati-
cally from an annotated corpus.

1 Introduction

For a parser to do a reasonable job of analysing free
text, it must have a strategy for assigning part-of-
speech tags to words which are not in its lexicon.
This problem, also known as the problem of un-
known words, has received relatively little attention
in the vast literature on Wall-Street-Journal (WSJ)
statistical parsing. This is likely due to the fact that
the proportion of unknown words in the standard
English test set, Section 23 of the WSJ section of
Penn Treebank, is quite small. The problem mani-
fests itself when the text to be analysed comes from
a different domain to the text upon which the parser
has been trained, when the treebank upon which the
parser has been trained is limited in size and when

the language to be parsed is heavily inflected. We
concentrate on the latter case, and examine the prob-
lem of unknown words for two languages which lie
on opposite ends of the spectrum of morphologi-
cal expressiveness and for one language which lies
somewhere in between: Arabic, English and French.

In our experiments we use a Berkeley-style latent-
variable PCFG parser and we contrast two tech-
niques for handling unknown words within the gen-
erative parsing model: one in which no language-
specific information is employed and one in which
morphological clues (or signatures) are exploited.
We find that the improvement accrued from look-
ing at a word’s morphology is greater for Arabic
and French than for English. The morphological
clues we use for English are taken directly from the
Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) and those for
French from recent work on French statistical pars-
ing with the Berkeley parser (Crabbé and Candito,
2008; Candito et al., 2009). For Arabic, we present
our own set of heuristics to extract these signatures
and demonstrate a statistically significant improve-
ment of 3.25% over the baseline model which does
not employ morphological information.

We next try to establish to what extent these clues
can be learnt automatically by extracting affixes
from the words in the training data and ranking these
using information gain. We show that this automatic
method performs quite well for all three languages.

The paper is organised as follows: In Section 2
we describe latent variable PCFG parsing models.
This is followed in Section 3 by a description of our
three datasets, including statistics on the extent of
the unknown word problem in each. In Section 4, we

present results on applying a version of the parser
which uses a simple, language-agnostic, unknown-
word handling technique to our three languages. In
Section 5, we show how this technique is extended
to include morphological information and present
parsing results for English and French. In Section 6,
we describe the Arabic morphological system and
explain how we used heuristic rules to cluster words
into word-classes or signatures. We present parsing
results for the version of the parser which uses this
information. In Section 7, we describe our attempts
to automatically determine the signatures for a lan-
guage and present parsing results for the three lan-
guages. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss how this
work might be fruitfully extended.

2 Latent Variable PCFG Parsing

Johnson (1998) showed that refining treebank cate-
gories with parent information leads to more accu-
rate grammars. This was followed by a collection of
linguistically motivated propositions for manual or
semi-automatic modifications of categories in tree-
banks (Klein and Manning, 2003). In PCFG-LAs,
first introduced by Matsuzaki et al. (2005), the re-
fined categories are learnt from the treebank us-
ing unsupervised techniques. Each base category
– and this includes part-of-speech tags – is aug-
mented with an annotation that refines its distribu-
tional properties.

Following Petrov et al. (2006) latent annotations
and probabilities for the associated rules are learnt
incrementally following an iterative process consist-
ing of the repetition of three steps.

1. Split each annotation of each symbol into n
(usually 2) new annotations and create rules
with the new annotated symbols. Estimate1 the
probabilities of the newly created rules.

2. Evaluate the impact of the newly created anno-
tations and discard the least useful ones. Re-
estimate probabilities with the new set of anno-
tations.

3. Smooth the probabilities to prevent overfitting.

We use our own parser which trains a PCFG-LA us-
ing the above procedure and parses using the max-

pectation/Maximisation on the training corpus.

rule parsing algorithm (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov
and Klein, 2007). PCFG-LA parsing is relatively
language-independent but has been shown to be very
effective on several languages (Petrov, 2009). For
our experiments, we set the number of iterations to
be 5 and we test on sentences less than or equal to
40 words in length. All our experiments, apart from
the final one, are carried out on the development sets
of our three languages.

3 The Datasets

Arabic We use the the Penn Arabic Treebank
(ATB) (Bies and Maamouri, 2003; Maamouri and
Bies., 2004). The ATB describes written Modern
Standard Arabic newswire and follows the style and
guidelines of the English Penn-II treebank. We use
the part-of-speech tagset defined by Bikel and Bies
(Bikel, 2004). We employ the usual treebank split
(80% training, 10% development and 10% test).

English We use the Wall Street Journal section of
the Penn-II Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994). We train
our parser on sections 2-21 and use section 22 con-
catenated with section 24 as our development set.
Final testing is carried out on Section 23.

French We use the French Treebank (Abeillé et
al., 2003) and divide it into 80% for training, 10%
for development and 10% for final results. We fol-
low the methodology defined by Crabbé and Can-
dito (2008): compound words are merged and the
tagset consists of base categories augmented with
morphological information in some cases2.

Table 1 gives basic unknown word statistics for
our three datasets. We calculate the proportion of
words in our development sets which are unknown
or rare (specified by the cutoff value) in the corre-
sponding training set. To control for training set
size, we also provide statistics when the English
training set is reduced to the size of the Arabic and
French training sets and when the Arabic training set
is reduced to the size of the French training set. In an
ideal world where training set sizes are the same for
all languages, the problem of unknown words will
be greatest for Arabic and smallest for English. It is

reasonable to assume that the levels of inflectional
richness have a role to play in these differences.

4 A Simple Lexical Probability Model

The simplest method for handling unknown words
within a generative probabilistic parsing/tagging
model is to reserve a proportion of the lexical rule
probability mass for such cases. This is done by
mapping rare words in the training data to a spe-
cial UNKNOWN terminal symbol and estimating rule
probabilities in the usual way. We illustrate the pro-
cess with the toy unannotated PCFG in Figures 1
and 2. The lexical rules in Fig. 1 are the original
rules and the ones in Fig. 2 are the result of apply-
ing the rare-word-to-unknown-symbol transforma-
tion. Given the input sentence The shares recovered,
the word recovered is mapped to the UNKNOWN to-
ken and the three edges corresponding to the rules
NNS → UNKNOWN, V BD → UNKNOWN and
JJ → UNKNOWN are added to the chart at this posi-
tion. The disadvantage of this simple approach is ob-
vious: all unknown words are treated equally and the
tag whose probability distribution is most dominated
by rare words in the training will be deemed the
most likely (JJ for this example), regardless of the
characteristics of the individual word. Apart from
its ease of implementation, its main advantage is its
language-independence - it can be used off-the-shelf
for any language for which a PCFG is available.3

One parameter along which the simple lexical

3Our simple lexical model is equivalent to the Berkeley sim-
pleLexicon option.

probability model can vary is the threshold used to
decide whether a word in the training data is rare or
“unknown”. When the threshold is set to n, a word
in the training data is considered to be unknown if it
occurs n or fewer times. We experiment with three
thresholds: 1, 5 and 10. The result of this experi-
ment for our three languages is shown in Table 2.

The general trend we see in Table 2 is that the
number of training set words considered to be un-
known should be minimized. For all three lan-
guages, the worst performing grammar is the one
obtained when the threshold is increased to 10. This
result is not unexpected. With this simple lexical
probability model, there is a trade-off between ob-
taining good guesses for words which do not occur
in the training data and obtaining reliable statistics
for words which do. The greater the proportion of
the probability mass that we reserve for the unknown
word section of the grammar, the more performance
suffers on the known yet rare words since these are
the words which are mapped to the UNKNOWN sym-
bol. For example, assume the word restructuring oc-
curs 10 times in the training data, always tagged as
a VBG. If the unknown threshold is less than ten and
if the word occurs in the sentence to be parsed, a
VBG edge will be added to the chart at this word’s
position with the probability 10/#VBG. If, however,
the threshold is set to 10, the word (in the training set
and the input sentence) will be mapped to UNKNOWN
and more possibilities will be explored (an edge for
each TAG → UNKNOWN rule in the grammar). We
can see from Table 1 that at threshold 10, one fifth

sets are unknown, and this is reflected in the drop in
parsing performance at these thresholds.

5 Making use of Morphology

Unknown words are not all the same. We exploit this
fact by examining the effect on parsing accuracy of
clustering rare training set words using cues from
the word’s morphological structure. Affixes have
been shown to be useful in part-of-speech tagging
(Schmid, 1994; Tseng et al., 2005) and have been
used in the Charniak (Charniak, 2000), Stanford
(Klein and Manning, 2003) and Berkeley (Petrov et
al., 2006) parsers. In this section, we contrast the
effect on parsing accuracy of making use of such in-
formation for our three languages of interest.
Returning to our toy English example in Figures 1
and 2, and given the input sentence The shares re-
covered, we would like to use the fact that the un-

known word recovered ends with the past tense
suffix -ed to boost the probability of the lexical
rule V BD → UNKNOWN. If we specialise the
UNKNOWN terminal using information from English
morphology, we can do just that, resulting in the
grammar in Figure 3. Now the word recovered is
mapped to the symbol UNK-ed and the only edge
which is added to the chart at this position is the one
corresponding to the rule V BD → UNK-ed.

For our English experiments we use the unknown
word classes (or signatures) which are used in the
Berkeley parser. A signature indicates whether a
words contains a digit or a hyphen, if a word starts
with a capital letter or ends with one of the following
English suffixes (both derivational and inflectional):
-s, -ed, -ing, -ion, -er, -est, -ly, -ity, -y and -al.

For our French experiments we employ the same
signature list as Crabbé and Candito (2008), which
itself was adapted from Arun and Keller (2005).
This list consists of (a) conjugation suffixes of regu-

70



lar verbs for common tenses (eg. -ons, -ez, -ent. . . )
and (b) derivational suffixes for nouns, adverbs and
adjectives (eg. -tion, -ment, -able. . . ).

The result of employing signature information
for French and English is shown in Table 3. Be-
side each f-score the absolute improvement over the
UNKNOWN baseline (Table 2) is given. For both
languages there is an improvement at all unknown
thresholds. The improvement for English is statis-
tically significant at unknown thresholds 1 and 10.4

The improvement is more marked for French and is
statistically significant at all levels.

In the next section, we experiment with signature
lists for Arabic.5

6 Arabic Signatures

In order to use morphological clues for Arabic we
go further than just looking at suffixes. We exploit
all the richness of the morphology of this language
which can be expressed through morphotactics.

6.1 Handling Arabic Morphotactics

Morphotactics refers to the way morphemes com-
bine together to form words (Beesley, 1998; Beesley
and Karttunen, 2003). Generally speaking, morpho-
tactics can be concatenative, with morphemes either
prefixed or suffixed to stems, or non-concatenative,
with stems undergoing internal alternations to con-
vey morphosyntactic information. Arabic is consid-
ered a typical example of a language that employs
non-concatenative morphotactics.

Arabic words are traditionally classified into three
types: verbs, nouns and particles. Adjectives take
almost all the morphological forms of, and share the
same templatic structures with, nouns. Adjectives,
for example, can be definite, and are inflected for
case, number and gender.

There are a number of indicators that tell us
whether the word is a verb or a noun. Among

4Statistical significance was determined using the strati-
fied shuffling method. The software used to perform the test
was downloaded from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/

˜dbikel/software.html.
5An inspection of the Berkeley Arabic grammar (available

at http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/
downloads/list) shows that no Arabic-specific signatures
were employed. The Stanford parser uses 9 signatures for Ara-
bic, designed for use with unvocalised text. An immediate fu-
ture goal is to test this signature list with our parser.

these indicators are prefixes, suffixes and word tem-
plates. A template (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) is
a kind of vocalization mould in which a word fits. In
derivational morphology Arabic words are formed
through the amalgamation of two tiers, namely, root
and template. A root is a sequence of three (rarely
two or four) consonants which are called radicals,
and the template is a pattern of vowels, or a com-
bination of consonants and vowels, with slots into
which the radicals of the root are inserted.

For the purpose of detection we use the reverse
of this information. Given that we have a word, we
try to extract the stem, by removing prefixes and suf-
fixes, and match the word against a number of verbal
and nominal templates. We found that most Ara-
bic templatic structures are in complementary dis-
tribution, i.e. they are either restricted to nominal
or verbal usage, and with simple regular expression
matching we can decide whether a word form is a
noun or a verb.

6.2 Noun Indicators

In order to detect that a word form is a noun (or ad-
jective), we employ heuristic rules related to Arabic
prefixes/suffixes and if none of these rules apply we
attempt to match the word against templatic struc-
tures. Using this methodology, we are able to detect
95% of ATB nouns.6

We define a list of 42 noun templates which are
used to indicate active/passive participle nouns, ver-
bal nouns, nouns of instrument and broken plural
nouns (see Table 4 for some examples). Note that
templates ending with taa marboutah “ap” or start-
ing with meem madmoumah “mu” are not consid-
ered since they are covered by our suffix/prefix rules,
which are as follows:
1- The definite article prefix Ë � or in Buckwalter
transliteration “Al”.
2- The tanween suffix

��, ��, �� or “N”, “F”, “K”, “AF”.
3- The feminine plural suffix �HA, or “+At”.
4- The taa marboutah ending

�è or “ap” whether as a
6The heuristics we developed are designed to work on dia-

critized texts. Although diacritics are generally ignored in mod-
ern writing, the issue of restoring diacritics has been satisfac-
torily addressed by different researchers. For example, Nelken
and Shieber (2005) presented an algorithm for restoring diacrit-
ics to undiacritized MSA texts with an accuracy of over 90%
and Habasah et al. (2009) reported on a freely-available toolkit
(MADA-TOKAN) an accuracy of over 96%.

6.3 Verb Indicators

In the same way, we define a list of 16 templates and
we combine them with heuristic rules related to Ara-
bic prefixes/suffixes to detect whether a word form
is exclusively a verb. The prefix/suffix heuristics are
as follows:
9-The plural marker suffix � �ð or “uwA” indicates a
verb.
10- The prefixes �H ,ø
 , 	à , �� , � or “sa”, “>a”,
“>u”, “na”, “nu”, “ya”, “yu”, “ta”, “tu” indicate im-

prefective verb.
The verbal templates are less in number than the
noun templates yet they are no less effective in de-
tecting the word class (see Table 4 for examples).
Using these heuristics we are able to detect 85% of
ATB verbs.

6.4 Arabic Signatures

We map the 72 noun/verb classes that are identi-
fied using our hand-crafted heuristics into sets of
signatures of varying sizes: 4, 6, 14, 21, 25, 28
and 72. The very coarse-grained set considers just
4 signatures UNK-noun, UNK-verb, UNK-num,
and UNK and the most fine-grained set of 72 signa-
tures associates one signature per heuristic. In ad-
dition, we have evaluated the effect of reordering
rules and templates and also the effect of collating
all signatures satisfying an unknown word. The re-
sults of using these various signatures sets in parsing

Table 5: Baseline Signatures for Arabic

our Arabic development set are presented in Table 5.
We achieve our best labeled bracketing f-score using
28 signatures with an unknown threshold of five. In
fact we get an improvement of 3.25% over using no
signatures at all (see Table 2). Table 3 describes in
more detail the scores obtained using the 28 signa-
tures present in Table 6. Apart from the set contain-
ing 72 signatures, all of the baseline signature sets in
Table 5 yield a statistically significant improvement
over the generic UNKNOWN results (p < 10−4).

7 Using Information Gain to Determine
Signatures

It is clear that dividing the UNKNOWN terminal into
more fine-grained categories based on morpholog-
ical information helps parsing for our three lan-
guages. In this section we explore whether useful
morphological clues can be learnt automatically. If
they can, it means that a latent-variable PCFG parser
can be adapted to any language without knowledge
of the language in question since the only language-
specific component in such a parser is the unknown-
signature specification.

In a nutshell, we extract affix features from train-

ing set words7 and then use information gain to rank
these features in terms of their predictive power in a
POS-tagging task. The features deemed most dis-
criminative are then used as signatures, replacing
our baseline signatures described in Sections 5 and
6. We are not going as far as actual POS-tagging,
but rather seeing whether the affixes that make good
features for a part-of-speech tagger also make good
unknown word signatures.

We experiment with English and French suffixes
of length 1-3 and Arabic prefixes and suffixes of var-
ious lengths as well as stem prefixes and suffixes of
length 2, 4 and 6. For each of our languages we
experiment with several information gain thresholds
on our development sets and we fix on an English
signature list containing 24 suffixes, a French list
containing 48 suffixes and an Arabic list containing
38 prefixes and suffixes.

Our development set results are presented in Ta-
ble 7. For all three languages, the information gain
signatures perform at a comparable level to the base-
line hand-crafted signatures (Table 3). For each
of the three unknown-word handling techniques, no
signature (UNKNOWN), hand-crafted signatures and
information gain signatures, we select the best un-
known threshold for each language’s development
set and apply these grammars to our test sets. The
f-scores are presented in Table 8, along with the up-
per bounds obtained by parsing with these grammars
in gold-tag mode. For French, the effect of tagging
accuracy on overall parse accuracy is striking. The
improvements that we get from using morphological
signatures are greatest for Arabic8 and smallest for

7We omit all function words and high frequency words be-
cause we are interested in the behaviour of words which are
likely to be similar to rare words.

8 Conclusion

We experiment with two unknown-word-handling
techniques in a statistical generative parsing model,
applying them to Arabic, French and English. One
technique is language-agnostic and the other makes
use of some morphological information (signatures)
in assigning part-of-speech tags to unknown words.
The performance differences from the two tech-
niques are smallest for English, the language with
the sparsest morphology of the three and the small-
est proportion of unknown words in its development
set. As a result of carrying out these experiments,
we have developed a list of Arabic signatures which
can be used with any statistical parser which does

English signatures were not employed.

its own tagging. We also present results which show
that signatures can be learnt automatically.

Our experiments have been carried out using gold
tokens. Tokenisation is an issue particularly for Ara-
bic, but also for French (since the treebank contains
merged compounds) and to a much lesser extent for
English (unedited text with missing apostrophes). It
is important that the experiments in this paper are re-
peated on untokenised text using automatic tokeni-
sation methods (e.g. MADA-TOKAN).

The performance improvements that we demon-
strate for Arabic unknown-word handling are obvi-
ously just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can
be done to improve performance on a morpholog-
ically rich language. The simple generative lexical
probability model we use can be improved by adopt-
ing a more sophisticated approach in which known
and unknown word counts are combined when esti-
mating lexical rule probabilities for rare words (see
Huang and Harper (2009) and the Berkeley sophis-
ticatedLexicon training option). Further work will
also include making use of a lexical resource exter-
nal to the treebank (Goldberg et al., 2009; Habash,
2008) and investigating clustering techniques to re-
duce data sparseness (Candito and Crabbé, 2009).
