Abstract

In this paper we present a novel resampling
model for extractive meeting summarization.
With resampling based on the output of a base-
line classifier, our method outperforms previ-
ous research in the field. Further, we com-
pare an existing resampling technique with
our model. We report on an extensive se-
ries of experiments on a large meeting corpus
which leads to classification improvement in
weighted precision and f-score.

1 Introduction

Feature-based machine learning approaches have
become a standard technique in the field of extrac-
tive summarization wherein the most important sec-
tions within a meeting transcripts need to be iden-
tified. We perceive the problem as recognizing the
most extract-worthy meeting dialog acts (DAs) in a
binary classification framework.

In this paper, firstly, in section 4 we create a gold
standard to train the classifier, by improvising upon
the existing annotations in our meeting corpus. Then
in section 5 we present actual numbers which dis-
play a very skewed class distribution to learn for
the binary classifier. This skewness is attributed to
the less number of actual extract-worthy and im-
portant DAs (positive examples) compared to ordi-
nary chit-chat, backchannel noises etc (negative ex-
amples) spoken during the course of the meeting.
We tackle this data skewness with a novel resam-
pling approach which reselects the data set to create
a more comparable class distribution between these
postive and negative instances.

Resampling methods have been found effective in
catering to the data imbalance problem mentioned
above. (Corbett and Copestake, 2008) used a re-
sampling module for chemical named entity recog-
nition. The pre-classifier, based on n-gram character
features, assigned a probability of being a chemical
word, to each token. Only tokens having probability
greater than a predefined threshold were preserved
and the output of the first stage classification along
with word suffix were used as features in further
classification steps. (Hinrichs et al., 2005) used a
hybrid approach for Computational Anaphora Res-
olution (CAR) combining rule based filtering with
Memory based learning to reduce the huge popu-
lation of anaphora/candidate-antecedent pairs. (Xie
et al., 2008), in their experimentation on the ICSI
meeting corpus, employ the salience scores gener-
ated by a TFIDF classifier in the resampling task.
We discuss the actual technique and our resampling
module further in section 6.

We compare its performance with the TFIDF
model of (Xie et al., 2008) in section 8.2 and observe
a general improvement in summary scores through
resampling.

2 Data

We use the scenario meetings of the AMI corpus
for our experiments in this paper which comprise
about two thirds of around 100 hours of recorded
and annotated meetings. The scenario meetings each
have four participants who play different roles in a
fictitious company for designing a remote control.
The AMI corpus has a standard training set of 94

34



meetings1 and 20 meetings each for development
and testing.

Annotators wrote abstractive summaries for each
meeting and then linked summary sentences to
those DA segments from the meeting transcripts
which best conveyed the information in the ab-
stracts. There was no limit on the number of links an
annotator could create and a many-to-many mapping
exists between the meeting DA segments and human
abstracts. Here, DA segments are used in analogy
to sentences in document summarization because
the spontaneously spoken material in meeting tran-
scripts rarely contains actual grammatical sentences.

3 Pre-processing and Feature Extraction

To the feature set of (Murray, 2008) listed in table
1 we add some high level features. Since the main
focus of this paper is to deal with the data imbal-
anace issue hence for the sake of completeness and
reproducibility of our work we briefly mention the
basic features used. In section 8.3 we explicitly re-
port the performance rise over the baseline due to
the added features.

3.1 Lexical and Structural features

The list of added features include the number of
content words (nouns and adjectives) in a DA. (Ed-
mundson, 1969) looked at cue-phrases, keywords
title and location of a sentence as features indica-
tive of important sections in a document. We use
a handpicked list of cue words like ”for example”,
”gonna have” etc as binary features. We also add
several keywords like ”remote”,”plastic” etc based
upon manual scrutiny, as binary features into the
classifier. Further we use DA labels of current and
four adjacent DAs as features.

3.2 Disfluency

The role of disfluencies in summarization has been
investigated by (Zhu and Penn, 2006) before. They
found that disfluencies improve summarization per-
formance when used as an additional feature. We
count the number of disfluent words in a DA using
an automatic disfluency detector.

1Three of the meetings were missing some required features.

3.3 Prosodic
We employ all the signal level features described by
(Murray, 2008) which include mean, max and stan-
dard deviation of energy and pitch values normal-
ized by both speaker and meeting. The duration of
the DA in terms of time and number of words spo-
ken. The subsequent, precedent pauses and rate of
speech feature.

4 Gold Standard

In supervised frameworks, the creation of gold-
standard annotations for training (and testing) is
known to be a difficult task, since (a) what should
go into a summary can be a matter of opinion and
(b) multiple sentences from the original document
may express similar content, making each of them
equally good candidates for selection. The hypoth-
esis is well supported by the low kappa value (Co-
hen, 1960) of 0.48 reported by (Murray, 2008) on
the AMI corpus.

We describe the procedure for creating the gold
standard for our experimentation in this paper.
Firstly we join all annotations and rank the DAs
from most number of links to least number of links
to create a sorted list of DAs. Depending on a pre-
defined variable percentage as gold standard cut-off

35



or threshold we preserve the corresponding number
of highest ranked DAs in the above list. For evalu-
ation, (Murray, 2008) uses gold standard summaries
obtained using similar procedure. For training, how-
ever, he uses all DA segments with at least one link
as positive examples.

As the term gold standard for the data set, cre-
ated above, is misleading. We call the set of DAs
so obtained by using this ranking and resampling
procedure as Weighted-Resampled Gold Standard
(WRGS). Henceforth in this paper, for a resampling
rate of say 35% we will name the set of DAs so ob-
tained as WRGS(35%) or simply WRGS for some
undefined, arbitrary threshold.

5 Data Skewness

In this section we focus on the skewed data set
which arises because of creating WRGS for training
our classifiers. Consider the set of DAs with at least
one link to the abstractive or human summaries. Let
us call it DAl≥1. This set accounts for 20.9% of all
DAs in the training set.

set size%
WRGS(25%) 5.22%

DAl≥1 20.9%

Table 2: Set sizes in % of all training DAs

Again consider set of DAs for WRGS(25%). This
set, by definition, contains 25% of all DAs in the
set DAl≥1. Hence the set WRGS(25%) constitute
5.22% of all DAs in the training set. Note that this is
a skewed class distribution as also visible in table 2.

Our system employs resampling architecture
shown in figure 1. The first classifier is similar in
spirit to the one developed in (Murray, 2008) with
the additional features listed in section 3. The out-
put we use is not the discrete classification result but
rather the probability for each DA segment to be ex-
tracted.

These probabilities are used in two ways for train-
ing the second classifier: firstly, to create the resam-
pled training set and secondly, as an additional fea-
ture for the second classifier. The procedure for re-
sampling is explained in the section 6.

6 Resampling

As explained in previous section our model obtains
resampled data for second stage classification using
the probabilistic outcomes of a first stage classifier.
The resampling is done similar to (Xie et al., 2008)
to cater to the data skewness problem. To do the
resampling, firstly, the DAs are ranked on decreasing
probabilities. In the next step, depending on some
resampling rate, a percentage of highest ranked DAs
is used in further classification steps, while rest of
DA segments are neglected.

(Xie et al., 2008) obtained the resampled set by
ranking the DAs on TFIDF weights. Data resam-
pling benefits the model in two ways a) by improv-
ing the positive/negative example ratio during the
training phase b) by discarding noisy utterances in
the test phase as they usually attain low scores from
the first classifier.

In testing, the first classifier is run on the test data,
its output is used, as in training, to create the resam-
pled test set and the probability features. Finally,
the summary is created from the probabilities pro-
duced by the second classifier by selecting the high-
est ranked DA segments for the specified summary
length.

As the data for resampling is derived by a
learning-based classifier, we call our approach
Learning-Based Sampling (LBS).

In this paper, we compare our LBS model with
the TFIDF sampling approach adopted by (Xie et
al., 2008) and present the results of resampling on
both models in section 8.2.

For comparison, we use Murray’s (2008) state of
art extractive summarization model.

7 Evaluation Metric

The main metric we use for evaluating the sum-
maries is the extension of the weighted precision
evaluation scheme introduced by (Murray, 2008).
The measure relies on having multiple annotations
for a meeting and a many-to-many mapping dis-
cussed in section 2. To calculate weighted precision,
the number of times that each extractive summary
DA was linked by each annotator is counted and av-
eraged to get a single DA score. The DA scores are
then averaged over all DAs in the summary to get
the weighted precision score for the entire summary.
The total number of links in an extractive summary
divided by the total number of links to the abstract as
a whole gives the weighted recall score. By this def-
inition, weighted recall can have a maximum score
of 1 since it is a fraction of the total links for the en-
tire summary. Also, there is no theoretical maximum
for weighted precision as annotators were allowed to
create any number of links for a single DA.

Both weighted precision and recall share the same
numerator: num = Σd Ld/N where Ld is the num-
ber of links for a DA d in the extractive summary,
and N is the number of annotators. Weighted pre-
cision is equal to wp = num/Ds where Ds is the
number of DAs in the extractive summary. Weighted
recall is given by recall = num/(Lt/N) where Lt
is the total number of links made between DAs and
abstract sentences by all annotators, and N is the
number of annotators. The f-score is calculated as:
(2× wp× recall)/(wp + recall).

In simple terms a DA which might be discussing
an important meeting topic e.g. selling price of the
remote control etc is more likely to be linked by
more than one annotator and possibly more than
once by an annotator. Therefore the high scoring
DAs are in a way indicative of quintessential topics
and agenda points of the meeting. Hence, weighted
precision which is number of links per annotator
averaged over all the meeting DAs is a figure that
aligns itself with average information content per
DA in the summary. Low scoring meeting chit-chats
will tend to bring the precision score down. We re-
port a weighted precision of 1.33 for 700 word sum-
mary extracted using the procedure described in 2
for obtaining gold standard. This is hence a ceil-
ing to the weighted precision score that can be ob-

tained by any summary corresponding to this com-
pression rate. Weighted Recall on the other hand
signifies total information content of the meeting.
For intelligent systems in general the recall rate in-
creases with increasing summary compression rates
while weighted precision decreases2.

Since we experiment with short summaries that
have at most 700 words, we do most of the com-
parisons in terms of weighted precision values. In
the final system evaluation in section 8.3, we include
weighted recall and f-score values.

8 Experimental Results and Discussion

8.1 Training on gold standard

Figure 2 shows the weighted precision results on
training an SVM classifier with different gold stan-
dard thresholds. For example, at a threshold of 60%,
the top 60% of the linked DA segments are defined
as the gold standard positive examples, all other DA
segments of the meeting are defined as negative,
non-extraction worthy. The tests are performed on
a single stage classifier similar to (Murray, 2008).

In addition, the curves show the behavior of the
system at three different summary compression rates
(i.e., number of words in the summary). A gen-
eral tendency that can be observed is the increase
in summary scores with decreasing threshold. For
700 word summaries the peak weighted precision
score is observed at 35% threshold. The recall rate
remains constant as seen by comparing the first two
rows of table 5.

We believe that low inter annotator agreement is
the major factor responsible for these results. This
shows that a reduced subset classification approach
will generally improve results when multiple anno-
tations are available.

8.2 Resampling

In this section we compare two resampling models.
The TFIDF model explained in section 6 selects best
DAs based on their TFIDF scores. As discussed

2An important point to notice is that, a high recall rate does
not ensure a good content coverage by the summary. As an
example, the summary might pick up DAs pertaining to only a
few very important points discussed during the meeting which
will lead to a high recall rate although lesser important concepts
may still be exclusive.

previously all sentences above a resampling thresh-
old are preserved while rest are discarded. In 8.2.2
resampling is done from the probabilities of a first
stage classifier. SVM model is used for both first
and second stage classification.

8.2.1 TFIDF Resampling

Table 3 reports weighted precision and f-scores at
two compression rates. The highest f-scores for 700,
1000 word summaries are obtained at 85% and 55%
respectively. Plots of figure 3 compare weighted
precision scores for LBS and TFIDF models.

1000 word summaries

8.2.2 LBS

The peak performance of the LBS model is ob-
served at resampling rate of 35% for both 700 and
1000 word summaries as seen in table 4. The maxi-
mum f-scores, 0.248 and 0.319 (table 4) obtained for

LBS outperforms maximum f-scores of 0.233 and
0.305 (table 3) for TFIDF.

Figure 3: LBS and TFIDF wp values at different com-
pression rates.

From figure 4 which shows positive example re-
tention against sampling rate for TFIDF and LBS it
is clear that for all sampling rates, LBS provides a
higher rate of positive examples.

Also as discussed above, using a learning-based
first classifier produces probability values that can
be leveraged as features for the second classifier. We
speculate that this also contributes to the differences
in overall performance.

8.3 Overall System Performance

In this section we report weighted precision, recall
and f-score for 700-word summaries, comparing re-
sults of the new model with the initial baseline sys-
tem.

As shown in table 5, training the system on

Figure 4: LBS and TFIDF retention rates.

WRGS, with a threshold of 35% increases the pre-
cision score from 0.61 to 0.64 while maintaining the
recall rate. This is corresponding to the weighted
precision score for 35% data point in figure 2.

The last row in table 5 correspond to results ob-
tained with using the LBS proposed in this paper.
The scores at 35% resampling are same as the bold
faced observations in table 4 for 700 word sum-
maries. We observe that the LBS architecture alone
brings about an absolute improvement of 4.41% and
8.69% in weighted precision and f-score.

9 Conclusions and Future Work

Through our experimental results in this pa-
per, we firstly observed that training the classifier
on WRGS (weighted-resampled gold standard) in-
stances, rather than all the annotated DAs improved
the weighted precision scores of our summarizer.
We further addressed the problem of skewed class
distribution in our data set and introduced a learning-
based resampling approach where we resample from
the probabilistic outcomes of a first stage classifier.
We noted that resampling the data set increased per-

formance, peaking at around 35% sampling rate. We
compared the LBS model with the TFIDF resampler
obtaining better f-scores from our proposed machine
learning based architecture. We conclude in general
that resampling techniques for resolving data imbal-
ance problem in extractive meeting summarization
domain, results in enhanced system performance.

We are currently working on multiple extensions
of this work, including investigating how the results
can be applied to other corpora, adding additional
features, and finally methods for post-processing ex-
tractive summaries.
