Abstract
We report on work in progress on extract-
ing lexical simplifications (e.g., “collaborate”
→ “work together”), focusing on utilizing
edit histories in Simple English Wikipedia for
this task. We consider two main approaches:
(1) deriving simplification probabilities via an
edit model that accounts for a mixture of dif-
ferent operations, and (2) using metadata to
focus on edits that are more likely to be sim-
plification operations. We find our methods
to outperform a reasonable baseline and yield
many high-quality lexical simplifications not
included in an independently-created manu-
ally prepared list.

1 Introduction

Nothing is more simple than greatness; indeed, to be
simple is to be great. —Emerson, Literary Ethics

Style is an important aspect of information pre-
sentation; indeed, different contexts call for differ-
ent styles. Here, we consider an important dimen-
sion of style, namely, simplicity. Systems that can
rewrite text into simpler versions promise to make
information available to a broader audience, such as
non-native speakers, children, laypeople, and so on.

One major effort to produce such text is the
Simple English Wikipedia (henceforth SimpleEW)1,
a sort of spin-off of the well-known English
Wikipedia (henceforth ComplexEW) where hu-
man editors enforce simplicity of language through
rewriting. The crux of our proposal is to learn lexical
simplifications from SimpleEW edit histories, thus
leveraging the efforts of the 18K pseudonymous in-
dividuals who work on SimpleEW. Importantly, not
all the changes on SimpleEW are simplifications; we
thus also make use of ComplexEW edits to filter out
non-simplifications.

Related work and related problems Previous
work usually involves general syntactic-level trans-

formation rules [1, 9, 10].2 In contrast, we explore
data-driven methods to learn lexical simplifications
(e.g., “collaborate” → “work together”), which are
highly specific to the lexical items involved and thus
cannot be captured by a few general rules.

Simplification is strongly related to but distinct
from paraphrasing and machine translation (MT).
While it can be considered a directional form of
the former, it differs in spirit because simplification
must trade off meaning preservation (central to para-
phrasing) against complexity reduction (not a con-
sideration in paraphrasing). Simplification can also
be considered to be a form of MT in which the two
“languages” in question are highly related. How-
ever, note that ComplexEW and SimpleEW do not
together constitute a clean parallel corpus, but rather
an extremely noisy comparable corpus. For ex-
ample, Complex/Simple same-topic document pairs
are often written completely independently of each
other, and even when it is possible to get good
sentence alignments between them, the sentence
pairs may reflect operations other than simplifica-
tion, such as corrections, additions, or edit spam.

Our work joins others in using Wikipedia revi-
sions to learn interesting types of directional lexical
relations, e.g, “eggcorns”3 [7] and entailments [8].

2 Method

As mentioned above, a key idea in our work is to
utilize SimpleEW edits. The primary difficulty in
working with these modifications is that they include
not only simplifications but also edits that serve
other functions, such as spam removal or correction
of grammar or factual content (“fixes”). We describe
two main approaches to this problem: a probabilis-
tic model that captures this mixture of different edit
operations (§2.1), and the use of metadata to filter
out undesirable revisions (§2.2).

2One exception [5] changes verb tense and replaces pro-
nouns. Other lexical-level work focuses on medical text [4, 2],
or uses frequency-filtered WordNet synonyms [3].

2.1 Edit model
We say that the kth article in a Wikipedia corre-
sponds to (among other things) a title or topic (e.g.,
“Cat”) and a sequence ~dk of article versions caused
by successive edits. For a given lexical item or
phrase A, we write A ∈ ~dk if there is any version
in ~dk that contains A. From each ~dk we extract a
collection ek = (ek,1, ek,2, . . . , ek,nk) of lexical edit
instances, repeats allowed, where ek,i = A → a
means that phrase A in one version was changed to
a in the next, A 6= a; e.g., “stands for” → “is the
same as”. (We defer detailed description of how we
extract lexical edit instances from data to §3.1.) We
denote the collection of ~dk in ComplexEW and Sim-
pleEW as C and S, respectively.

There are at least four possible edit operations: fix
(o1), simplify (o2), no-op (o3), or spam (o4). How-
ever, for this initial work we assume P (o4) = 0.4

Let P (oi | A) be the probability that oi is applied
to A, and P (a | A, oi) be the probability of A → a
given that the operation is oi. The key quantities of
interest are P (o2 | A) in S, which is the probability
thatA should be simplified, and P (a | A, o2), which
yields proper simplifications of A. We start with an
equation that models the probability that a phrase A
is edited into a:

P (a | A) =
∑
oi∈Ω

P (oi | A)P (a | A, oi), (1)

where Ω is the set of edit operations. This involves
the desired parameters, which we solve for by esti-
mating the others from data, as described next.

Estimation Note that P (a | A, o3) = 0 if A 6= a.
Thus, if we have estimates for o1-related probabili-
ties, we can derive o2-related probabilities via Equa-
tion 1. To begin with, we make the working as-
sumption that occurrences of simplification in Com-
plexEW are negligible in comparison to fixes. Since
we are also currently ignoring edit spam, we thus
assume that only o1 edits occur in ComplexEW.5

Let fC(A) be the fraction of ~dk in C
containing A in which A is modified:

fC(A) =
|{~dk∈C|∃a,i such that ek,i=A→a}|

|{~dk∈C|A∈~dk}|
.

4Spam/vandalism detection is a direction for future work.
5This assumption also provides useful constraints to EM,

which we plan to apply in the future, by reducing the number of
parameter settings yielding the same likelihood.

We similarly define fS(A) on ~dk in S. Note that we
count topics (version sequences), not individual ver-
sions: if A appears at some point and is not edited
until 50 revisions later, we should not conclude
that A is unlikely to be rewritten; for example, the
intervening revisions could all be minor additions,
or part of an edit war.

If we assume that the probability of any particular
fix operation being applied in SimpleEW is propor-
tional to that in ComplexEW— e.g., the SimpleEW
fix rate might be dampened because already-edited
ComplexEW articles are copied over — we have6

P̂ (o1 | A) = αfC(A)

where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Note that in SimpleEW,

P (o1 ∨ o2 | A) = P (o1 | A) + P (o2 | A),

where P (o1 ∨ o2 | A) is the probability that A is
changed to a different word in SimpleEW, which we
estimate as P̂ (o1 ∨ o2 | A) = fS(A). We then set

P̂(o2 | A) = max (0, fS(A)− αfC(A)).
Next, under our working assumption, we estimate

the probability of A being changed to a as a fix
by the proportion of ComplexEW edit instances that
rewrite A to a:

P̂ (a | A, o1) =
|{(k, i) pairs | ek,i = A→ a ∧ ~dk ∈ C}|∑
a′ |{(k, i) pairs | ek,i = A→ a′ ∧ ~dk ∈ C}|

.

A natural estimate for the conditional probability
of A being rewritten to a under any operation type
is based on observations of A → a in SimpleEW,
since that is the corpus wherein both operations are
assumed to occur:

P̂ (a | A) = |{(k, i) pairs | ek,i = A→ a ∧
~dk ∈ S}|∑

a′ |{(k, i) pairs | ek,i = A→ a′ ∧ ~dk ∈ S}|
.

Thus, from (1) we get that for A 6= a:

P̂(a | A,o2) =
P̂(a | A)− P̂(o1 | A)P̂(a | A,o1)

P̂(o2 | A)
.

2.2 Metadata-based methods
Wiki editors have the option of associating a com-
ment with each revision, and such comments some-
times indicate the intent of the revision. We there-
fore sought to use comments to identify “trusted”

6Throughout, “hats” denote estimates.

revisions wherein the extracted lexical edit instances
(see §3.1) would be likely to be simplifications.

Let ~rk = (r1k, . . . , r
i
k, . . .) be the sequence of revi-

sions for the kth article in SimpleEW, where rik is the
set of lexical edit instances (A → a) extracted from
the ith modification of the document. Let cik be the
comment that accompanies rik, and conversely, let
R(Set) = {rik|cik ∈ Set}.

We start with a seed set of trusted comments,
Seed. To initialize it, we manually inspected a small
sample of the 700K+ SimpleEW revisions that bear
comments, and found that comments containing a
word matching the regular expression *simpl* (e.g,
“simplify”) seem promising. We thus set Seed :=
{ ∗ simpl∗} (abusing notation).

The SIMPL method Given a set of trusted revi-
sions TRev (in our case TRev = R(Seed)), we
score each A → a ∈ TRev by the point-wise mu-
tual information (PMI) between A and a.7 We write
RANK(TRev) to denote the PMI-based ranking of
A→ a ∈ TRev, and use SIMPL to denote our most
basic ranking method, RANK(R(Seed)).

Two ideas for bootstrapping We also considered
bootstrapping as a way to be able to utilize revisions
whose comments are not in the initial Seed set.

Our first idea was to iteratively expand the set
of trusted comments to include those that most of-
ten accompany already highly ranked simplifica-
tions. Unfortunately, our initial implementations in-
volved many parameters (upper and lower comment-
frequency thresholds, number of highly ranked sim-
plifications to consider, number of comments to add
per iteration), making it relatively difficult to tune;
we thus omit its results.

Our second idea was to iteratively expand the
set of trusted revisions, adding those that contain
already highly ranked simplifications. While our
initial implementation had fewer parameters than
the method sketched above, it tended to terminate
quickly, so that not many new simplifications were
found; so, again, we do not report results here.

An important direction for future work is to differ-
entially weight the edit instances within a revision,
as opposed to placing equal trust in all of them; this

7PMI seemed to outperform raw frequency and conditional
probability.

could prevent our bootstrapping methods from giv-
ing common fixes (e.g., “a”→ “the”) high scores.

3 Evaluation8

3.1 Data

We obtained the revision histories of both Sim-
pleEW (November 2009 snapshot) and ComplexEW
(January 2008 snapshot). In total, ∼1.5M revisions
for 81733 SimpleEW articles were processed (only
30% involved textual changes). For ComplexEW,
we processed ∼16M revisions for 19407 articles.

Extracting lexical edit instances. For each ar-
ticle, we aligned sentences in each pair of adja-
cent versions using tf-idf scores in a way simi-
lar to Nelken and Shieber [6] (this produced sat-
isfying results because revisions tended to repre-
sent small changes). From the aligned sentence
pairs, we obtained the aforementioned lexical edit
instances A → a. Since the focus of our study
was not word alignment, we used a simple method
that identified the longest differing segments (based
on word boundaries) between each sentence, except
that to prevent the extraction of entire (highly non-
matching) sentences, we filtered out A → a pairs if
either A or a contained more than five words.

3.2 Comparison points

Baselines RANDOM returns lexical edit instances
drawn uniformly at random from among those ex-
tracted from SimpleEW. FREQUENT returns the
most frequent lexical edit instances extracted from
SimpleEW.

Dictionary of simplifications The SimpleEW ed-
itor “Spencerk” (Spencer Kelly) has assembled a list
of simple words and simplifications using a combi-
nation of dictionaries and manual effort9. He pro-
vides a list of 17,900 simple words — words that do
not need further simplification — and a list of 2000
transformation pairs. We did not use Spencerk’s set
as the gold standard because many transformations
we found to be reasonable were not on his list. In-
stead, we measured our agreement with the list of
transformations he assembled (SPLIST).

3.3 Preliminary results
The top 100 pairs from each system (edit model10

and SIMPL and the two baselines) plus 100 ran-
domly selected pairs from SPLIST were mixed and
all presented in random order to three native English
speakers and three non-native English speakers (all
non-authors). Each pair was presented in random
orientation (i.e., either as A → a or as a → A),
and the labels included “simpler”, “more complex”,
“equal”, “unrelated”, and “?” (“hard to judge”). The
first two labels correspond to simplifications for the
orientations A → a and a → A, respectively. Col-
lapsing the 5 labels into “simplification”, “not a sim-
plification”, and “?” yields reasonable agreement
among the 3 native speakers (κ = 0.69; 75.3% of the
time all three agreed on the same label). While we
postulated that non-native speakers11 might be more
sensitive to what was simpler, we note that they dis-
agreed more than the native speakers (κ = 0.49) and
reported having to consult a dictionary. The native-
speaker majority label was used in our evaluations.

Here are the results; “-x-y” means that x and y are
the number of instances discarded from the precision
calculation for having no majority label or majority
label “?”, respectively:

Method Prec@100 # of pairs
SPLIST 86% (-0-0) 2000

Edit model 77% (-0-1) 1079
SIMPL 66% (-0-0) 2970

FREQUENT 17% (-1-7) -
RANDOM 17% (-1-4) -

Both baselines yielded very low precisions —
clearly not all (frequent) edits in SimpleEW were
simplifications. Furthermore, the edit model yielded
higher precision than SIMPL for the top 100 pairs.
(Note that we only examined one simplification per
A for those A where P̂ (o2 | A) was well-defined;
thus “# of pairs” does not directly reflect the full
potential recall that either method can achieve.)
Both, however, produced many high-quality pairs
(62% and 71% of the correct pairs) not included in
SPLIST. We also found the pairs produced by these
two systems to be complementary to each other. We

10We only considered those A such that freq(A → ∗) >
1 ∧ freq(A) > 100 on both SimpleEW and ComplexEW. The
final top 100 A → a pairs were those with As with the highest
P (o2 | A). We set α = 1.

believe that these two approaches provide a good
starting point for further explorations.

Finally, some examples of simplifications found
by our methods: “stands for” → “is the same
as”, “indigenous” → “native”, “permitted” → “al-
lowed”, “concealed” → “hidden”, “collapsed” →
“fell down”, “annually”→ “every year”.

3.4 Future work
Further evaluation could include comparison with
machine-translation and paraphrasing algorithms. It
would be interesting to use our proposed estimates
as initialization for EM-style iterative re-estimation.
Another idea would be to estimate simplification pri-
ors based on a model of inherent lexical complexity;
some possible starting points are number of sylla-
bles (which is used in various readability formulae)
or word length.
