Abstract

The Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT) has become one of
ACL’s flagship workshops, held annually
since 2006. In addition to soliciting pa-
pers from the research community, WMT
also features a shared translation task for
evaluating MT systems. This shared task
is notable for having manual evaluation as
its cornerstone. The Workshop’s overview
paper, playing a descriptive and adminis-
trative role, reports the main results of the
evaluation without delving deep into ana-
lyzing those results. The aim of this paper
is to investigate and explain some interest-
ing idiosyncrasies in the reported results,
which only become apparent when per-
forming a more thorough analysis of the
collected annotations. Our analysis sheds
some light on how the reported results
should (and should not) be interpreted, and
also gives rise to some helpful recommen-
dation for the organizers of WMT.

1 Introduction

The Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
(WMT) has become an annual feast for MT re-
searchers. Of particular interest is WMT’s shared
translation task, featuring a component for man-
ual evaluation of MT systems. The friendly com-
petition is a source of inspiration for participating
teams, and the yearly overview paper (Callison-
Burch et al., 2010) provides a concise report of the
state of the art. However, the amount of interest-
ing data collected every year (the system outputs

and, most importantly, the annotator judgments)
is quite large, exceeding what the WMT overview
paper can afford to analyze with much depth.

In this paper, we take a closer look at the data
collected in last year’s workshop, WMT101, and
delve a bit deeper into analyzing the manual judg-
ments. We focus mainly on the English-to-Czech
task, as it included a diverse portfolio of MT sys-
tems, was a heavily judged language pair, and also
illustrates interesting “contradictions” in the re-
sults. We try to explain such points of interest,
and analyze what we believe to be the positive and
negative aspects of the currently established eval-
uation procedure of WMT.

Section 2 examines the primary style of man-
ual evaluation: system ranking. We discuss how
the interpretation of collected judgments, the com-
putation of annotator agreement, and document
that annotators’ individual preferences may render
two systems effectively incomparable. Section 3
is devoted to the impact of embedding reference
translations, while Section 4 and Section 5 discuss
some idiosyncrasies of other WMT shared tasks
and manual evaluation in general.

2 The System Ranking Task

At the core of the WMT manual evaluation is the
system ranking task. In this task, the annotator
is presented with a source sentence, a reference
translation, and the outputs of five systems over
that source sentence. The instructions are kept
minimal: the annotator is to rank the presented
translations from best to worst. Ties are allowed,
but the scale provides five rank labels, allowing the
annotator to give a total order if desired.

The five assigned rank labels are submitted at
once, making the 5-tuple a unit of annotation. In
the following, we will call this unit a block. The
blocks differ from each other in the choice of the

source sentence and the choice of the five systems
being compared. A couple of tricks are introduced
in the sampling of the source sentences, to en-
sure that a large enough number of judgments is
repeated across different screens for meaningful
computation of inter- and intra-annotator agree-
ment. As for the sampling of systems, it is done
uniformly – no effort is made to oversample or un-
dersample a particular system (or a particular pair
of systems together) at any point in time.

In terms of the interface, the evaluation utilizes
the infrastructure of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
(MTurk)2, with each MTurk HIT3 containing three
blocks, corresponding to three consecutive source
sentences.

Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the vari-
ous language pairs in terms of number of MT sys-
tems compared (including the reference), number
of blocks ranked, the number of pairwise com-
parisons extracted from the rankings (one block
with 5 systems ranked gives 10 pairwise compar-
isons, but occasional unranked systems are ex-
cluded), the quality of the reference (the percent-
age of comparisons where the reference was better
or equal than another system), and the κ statistic,
which is a measure of agreement (see Section 2.2
for more details).4

We see that English-to-Czech, the language pair
on which we focus, is not far from the average in
all those characteristics except for the number of
collected comparisons (and blocks), making it the
second most evaluated language pair.

3“HIT” is an acronym for human intelligence task, which

is the MTurk term for a single screen presented to the anno-
tator.

4We only use the “expert” annotations of WMT10, ignor-
ing the data collected from paid annotators on MTurk, since
they were not part of the official evaluation.

2.1 Interpreting the Rank Labels

The description in the WMT overview paper says:
“Relative ranking is our official evaluation met-
ric. [Systems] are ranked based on how frequently
they were judged to be better than or equal to
any other system.” (Emphasis added.) The WMT
overview paper refers to this measure as “≥ oth-
ers”, with a variant of it called “> others” that does
not reward ties.

We first note that this description is somewhat
ambiguous, and an uninformed reader might in-
terpret it in one of two different ways. For some
system A, each block in which A appears includes
four implicit pairwise comparisons (against the
other presented systems). How is A’s score com-
puted from those comparisons?

The correct interpretation is that A is re-
warded once for each of the four comparisons in
which A wins (or ties).5 In other words, A’s score
is the number of pairwise comparisons in which
A wins (or ties), divided by the total number of
pairwise comparisons involving A. We will use
“≥ others” (resp. “> others”) to refer to this inter-
pretation, in keeping with the terminology of the
overview paper.

The other interpretation is that A is rewarded
only if A wins (or ties) all four comparisons. In
other words, A’s score is the number of blocks in
whichA wins (or ties) all comparisons, divided by
the number of blocks in which A appears. We will
use “≥ all in block” (resp. “> all in block”) to
refer to this interpretation.6

5Personal communication with WMT organizers.
6There is yet a third interpretation, due to a literal read-

ing of the description, where A is rewarded at most once per
block if it wins (or ties) any one of its four comparisons. This
is probably less useful: it might be good at identifying the
bottom tier of systems, but would fail to distinguish between
all other systems.

Table 2: Sentence-level ranking scores for the
WMT10 English-Czech language pair. The “≥
others” and “> others” scores reproduced here
exactly match numbers published in the WMT10
overview paper. A boldfaced score marks the best
system in a given row (besides the reference).

For quality control purposes, the WMT organiz-
ers embed the reference translations as a ‘system’
alongside the actual entries (the idea being that an
annotator clicking randomly would be easy to de-
tect, since they would not consistently rank the
reference ‘system’ highly). This means that the
reference is as likely as any other system to ap-
pear in a block, and when the score for a system A
is computed, pairwise comparisons with the refer-
ence are included.

We use the publicly released human judgments7

to compute the scores of systems participating in
the English-Czech subtask, under both interpreta-
tions. Table 2 reports the scores, with our “≥ oth-
ers” (resp. “> others”) scores reproduced exactly
matching those reported in Table 21 of the WMT
overview paper. (For clarity, Table 2 is abbreviated
to include only the top six systems of twelve.)

Our first suggestion is that both measures could
be reported in future evaluations, since each tells
us something different. The first interpretation
gives partial credit for an MT system, hence distin-
guishing systems from each other at a finer level.
This is especially important for a language pair
with relatively few annotations, since “≥ others”
would produce a larger number of data points (four
per system per block) than “≥ all in block” (one
per system per block). Another advantage of the
official “≥ others” is greater robustness towards
various factors like the number of systems in the
competition, the number of systems in one block
or the presence of the reference in the block (how-
ever, see Section 3).

As for the second interpretation, it helps iden-
tify whether or not a single system (or a small
group of systems) is strongly dominant over the
other systems. For the systems listed in Table 2,

Figure 1: “≥ all in block” and “≥ others” provide
very similar ordering of systems.

“> all in block” suggests its potential in the con-
text of system combination: CU-TECTO and PC-
TRANS win almost one fifth of the blocks in which
they appear, despite the fact that either a refer-
ence translation or a combination system already
appears alongside them. (See also Table 4 below.)

Also, note that if the ranking task were designed
specifically to cater to the “≥ all in block” inter-
pretation, it would only have two ‘rank’ labels (ba-
sically, “top” and “non-top”). In that case, an-
notators would spend considerably less time per
block than they do now, since all they need to do
is identify the top system(s) per block, without dis-
tinguishing non-top systems from each other.

Even for those interested in distinguishing non-
state-of-the-art systems from each other, we point
out that the “≥ all in block” interpretation ulti-
mately gives a system ordering that is very simi-
lar to that of the official “≥ others” interpretation,
even for the lower-tier systems (Figure 1).

2.2 Annotator Agreement
The WMT10 overview paper reports inter- and
intra-annotator agreement over the pairwise com-
parisons, to show the validity of the evaluation
setup and the “≥ others” metric. Agreement is
quantified using the following formula:

κ =
P (A)− P (E)

1− P (E)
(1)

where P (A) is the proportion of times two anno-
tators are observed to agree, and P (E) is the ex-
pected proportion of times two annotators would
agree by chance. Note that κ has a value of at most
1, with higher κ values indicating higher rates of
agreement. The κ measure is more meaningful

than reporting P (A) as is, since it takes into ac-
count, via P (E), how ‘surprising’ it is for annota-
tors to agree in the first place.

In the context of pairwise comparisons, an
agreement between two annotators occurs when
they compare the same pair of systems (S1,S2),
and both agree on their relative ranking: either
S1 > S2, S1 = S2, or S1 < S2. P (E) is then:

P (E) = P 2(S1>S2)+P 2(S1=S2)+P 2(S1<S2) (2)

In the WMT overview paper, all three cate-
gories are assumed equally likely, giving P (E) =

3 . For consistency with the WMT

overview paper, and unless otherwise noted, we
also use P (E) = 13 whenever a κ value is re-
ported. (Though see Section 2.2.2 for a discussion
about P (E).)

2.2.1 Observed Agreement for Different
Sentence Lengths

In Figure 2 we plot the κ values across different
source sentence lengths. We see that the inter-
annotator agreement (when excluding references)
is reasonably high only for sentences up to 10
words in length – according to Landis and Koch
(1977), and as cited by the WMT overview paper,
not even ‘moderate’ agreement can be assumed if
κ is less than 0.4. Another popular (and controver-
sial) rule of thumb (Krippendorff, 1980) is more
strict and says that κ < 0.67 is not suitable even
for tentative conclusions.

For this reason, and given that a majority of sen-
tences are indeed more than 10 words in length
(the median is 20 words), we suggest that future
evaluations either include fewer outputs per block,
or divide longer sentences into shorter segments
(e.g. on clause boundaries), so these segments are
more easily and reliably comparable. The latter
suggestions assumes word alignment as a prepro-
cessing and presenting the annotators the context
of the judged segment.

2.2.2 Estimating P (E), the Expected
Agreement by Chance

Several agreement measures (usually called kap-
pas) were designed based on the Equation 1 (see
Artstein and Poesio (2008) and Eugenio and Glass
(2004) for an overview and a discussion). Those
measures differ from each other in how to de-
fine the individual components of Equation 2, and
hence differ in what the expected agreement by
chance (P (E)) would be:8

• The S measure (Bennett et al., 1954) assumes
a uniform distribution over the categories.

• Scott’s π (Scott, 1955) estimates the distribu-
tion empirically from actual annotation.

• Cohen’s κ (Cohen, 1960) estimates the dis-
tribution empirically as well, and further as-
sumes a separate distribution for each anno-
tator.

Given that the WMT10 overview paper assumes
that the three categories (S1 > S2, S1 = S2, and
S1 < S2) are equally likely, it is using the S mea-
sure version of Equation 1, though it does not ex-
plicitly say so – it simply calls it “the kappa coef-
ficient” (K).

Regardless of what the measure should be
called, we believe that the uniform distribution it-
self is not appropriate, even though it seems to
model a “random clicker” adequately. In partic-
ular, and given the design of the ranking inter-
face, 13 is an overestimate of P (S1 = S2) for
a random clicker, and should in fact be 15 : each
system receives one of five rank labels, and for
two systems to receive the same rank label, there
are only five (out of 25) label pairs that satisfy
S1 = S2. Therefore, with P (S1 = S2) = 15 ,

8These three measures were later generalized to more than
two annotators (Fleiss, 1971; Bartko and Carpenter, 1976),
Thus, without loss of generality, our examples involve two
annotators.

Table 3: Summary of two variants of kappa: S
(or K as it is reported in the WMT10 paper) and
our proposed Scott’s π. We report inter- vs. intra-
annotator agreement and collected from all com-
parisons (“incl. ref.”) vs. collected only from
comparisons without the reference (“excl. ref.”)
because it is generally easier to agree that the ref-
erence is better than the other systems. This table
is based on all language pairs.

we have P (S1 > S2) = P (S1 < S2) = 25 , and
therefore P (E) = 0.36 rather than 0.333.

Taking the discussion a step further, we actually
advocate following the idea of Scott’s π, whereby
the distribution of each category is estimated em-
pirically from the actual annotation, rather than
assuming a random annotator – these frequencies
are easy to compute, and reflect a more meaning-
ful P (E).9

Under this interpretation, P (S1 = S2) is cal-
culated to be 0.168, reflecting the fraction of pair-
wise comparisons that correspond to a tie. (Note
that this further supports the claim that setting
P (S1 = S2) = 13 for a random clicker, as used
in the WMT overview paper, is an overestimate.)
This results in P (E) = 0.374, yielding, for in-
stance, π = 0.454 for “≥ others” inter-annotator
agreement, somewhat lower than κ = 0.487 (re-
ported in Table 3).

We do note that the difference is rather small,
and that our aim is to be mathematically sound
above all. Carefully defining P (E) would be im-
portant when comparing kappas across different
tasks with different P (E), or when attempting
to satisfy certain thresholds (as the cited 0.4 and
0.67). Furthermore, if one is interested in mea-
suring agreement for individual annotators, such
as identifying those who have unacceptably low
intra-annotator agreement, the question of P (E) is
quite important, since annotation behavior varies
noticeably from one annotator to another. A ‘con-
servative’ annotator who prefers to rank systems
as being tied most of the time would have a high

9We believe that P (E) should not reflect the chance that
two random annotators would agree, but the chance that two
actual annotators would agree randomly. The two sound sub-
tly related but are actually quite different.

P (E), whereas an annotator using ties moderately
would have a low P (E). Hence, two annotators
with equal agreement rates (P (A)) are not neces-
sarily equally proficient, since their P (E) might
differ considerably.10

2.3 The ≥ variant vs. the > variant
Even within the same interpretation of how sys-
tems could be scored, there is a question of
whether or not to reward ties. The overview paper
reports both variants of its measure, but does not
note that there are non-trivial differences between
the two orderings. Compare for example the “≥
others” ordering vs. the “> others” ordering of
CU-BOJAR and PC-TRANS (Table 2), showing an
unexpected swing of 7.9%:

≥ others > others
CU-BOJAR 65.6 45.0
PC-TRANS 62.1 49.4

CU-BOJAR seems better under the≥ variant, but
loses out when only strict wins are rewarded. The-
oretically, this could be purely due to chance, but
the total number of pairwise comparisons in “≥
others” is relatively large (about 1,500 pairwise
comparisons for each system), and ought to can-
cel such effects.

A similar pattern could be seen under the “all in
block” interpretation as well (e.g. for CU-TECTO
and ONLINEB). Table 4 documents this effect by
looking at how often a system is the sole winner
of a block. Comparing PC-TRANS and CU-BOJAR
again, we see that PC-TRANS is up there with CU-
TECTO and DCU-COMBO as the most frequent sole
winners, winning 71 blocks, whereas CU-BOJAR
is the sole winner of only 53 blocks. This is in
spite of the fact that PC-TRANS actually appeared
in slightly fewer blocks than CU-BOJAR (385 vs.
401).

One possible explanation is that the two vari-
ants (“≥” and “>”) measure two subtly different
things about MT systems. Digging deeper into Ta-
ble 2’s values, we find that CU-BOJAR is tied with
another system 65.6 − 45.0 = 20.4% of the time,
while PC-TRANS is tied with another system only
62.1− 49.4 = 12.7% of the time. So it seems that
PC-TRANS’s output is noticeably different from
another system more frequently than CU-BOJAR,
which reduces the number of times that annotators

10Who’s more impressive: a psychic who correctly pre-
dicts the result of a coin toss 50% of the time, or a psychic
who correctly predicts the result of a die roll 50% of the time?

mark PC-TRANS as tied with another system.11 In
that sense, the “≥” ranking is hurting PC-TRANS,
since it does not benefit from its small number of
ties. On the other hand, the “>” variant would not
reward CU-BOJAR for its large number of ties.

The “≥ others” score may be artificially boosted
if several very similar systems (and therefore
likely to be “tied”) take part in the evaluation.12

One possible solution is to completely disregard
ties and calculate the final score as winswins+losses . We
recommend to use this score instead of “≥ others”
( wins+tieswins+ties+losses ) which is biased toward often tied
systems, and “> others” ( winswins+ties+losses ) which is
biased toward systems with few ties.

2.4 Surprise? Does the Number of
Evaluations Affect a System’s Score?

When examining the system scores for the
English-Czech task, we noticed a surprising pat-
tern: it seemed that the more times a system is
sampled to be judged, the lower its “≥ others”
score (“≥ all in block” behaving similarly). A
scatter plot of a system’s score vs. the number of
blocks in which it appears (Figure 3) makes the
pattern obvious.

We immediately wondered if the pattern holds
in other language pairs. We measured Pearson’s
correlation coefficient within each language pair,
reported in Table 5. As it turns out, English-

11Indeed, PC-TRANS is a commercial system (manually)
tuned over a long period of time and based on resources very
different from what other participants in WMT use.

12In the preliminary WMT11 results, this seems to hap-
pen to four Moses-like systems (UEDIN, CU-BOJAR, CU-
MARECEK and CU-TAMCHYNA) which have better “≥ oth-
ers” score but worse “> others” score than CU-TECTO.

Figure 3: A plot of “≥ others” system score vs.
times judged, for English-Czech.

Czech happened to be the one language pair where
the ‘correlation’ is strongest, with only English-
Spanish also having a somewhat strong correla-
tion. Overall, though, there is a consistent trend
that can be seen across the language pairs. Could
it really be the case that the more often a system is
judged, the worse its score gets?

Examining plots for the other language pairs
makes things a bit clearer. Consider for example
the plot for English-Spanish (Figure 4). As one
would hope, the data points actually come together
to form a cloud, indicating a lack of correlation.
The reason that a hint of a correlation exists is the
presence of two outliers in the bottom right cor-
ner. In other words, the very worst systems are,
indeed, the ones judged quite often. We observed
this pattern in several other language pairs as well.

The correlation naturally does not imply cau-
sation. We are still not sure how to explain the
artifact. A subtle possibility lies in the MTurk
interface: annotators have the choice to accept a
HIT or skip it before actually providing their la-

bels. It might be the case that some annotators are
more willing to accept HITs when there is an ob-
viously poor system (since that would make their
task somewhat easier), and who are more prone
to skipping HITs where the systems seem hard to
distinguish from each other. So there might be a
causation effect after all, but in the reverse order:
a system gets judged more often if it is a bad sys-
tem.13 A suggestion from the reviewers is to run a
pilot annotation with deliberate inclusion of a poor
system among the ranked ones.

2.5 Issues of Pairwise Judgments

The WMT overview paper also provides pairwise
system comparisons: each cell in Table 6 indicates
the percentage of pairwise comparisons between
the two systems where the system in the column
was ranked better (>) than the system in the row.
For instance, there are 81 ranking responses where
both CU-TECTO and CU-BOJAR were present and
indeed ranked14 among the 5 systems in the block.
In 37 (45.7%) of the cases, CU-TECTO was ranked
better, in 29 (35.8%), CU-BOJAR was ranked better
and there was a tie in the remaining 15 (18.5%)
cases. The ties are not explicitly shown in Table 6
but they are implied by the total of 100%. The cell
is in bold where there was a win in the pairwise
comparison, so 45.7 is bold in our example.

An interesting “discrepancy” in Table 6 is that
CU-TECTO wins pairwise comparisons with CU-
BOJAR and UEDIN but it scores worse than them
in the official “≥ others”, cf. Table 2. Simi-
larly, UEDIN outperformed ONLINEB in the pair-

wise comparisons but it was ranked worse in both
> and ≥ official comparison.

In the following, we focus on the CU-BOJAR
(B) and CU-TECTO (T) pair because they are in-
teresting competitors on their own. They both use
the same parallel corpus for lexical mapping but
operate very differently: CU-BOJAR is based on
Moses while CU-TECTO transfers at a deep syn-
tactic layer and generates target text which is more
or less grammatically correct but suffers in lexical
choice.

2.5.1 Different Set of Sentences
The mismatch in the outcomes of “≥ others” and
pairwise comparisons could be caused by different
set of sentences. The pairwise ranking is collected
from the set of blocks where both CU-BOJAR and
CU-TECTO appeared (and were indeed ranked).
Each of the systems however competes in other
blocks as well, which contributes to the official “≥
others”.

The set of sentences underlying the comparison
is very different and more importantly that the ba-
sis for pairwise comparisons is much smaller than
the basis of the official “≥ others” interpretation.
The outcome of the official interpretation however
depends on the random set of systems your system
was compared to. In our case, it is impossible to
distinguish, whether CU-TECTO had just bad luck
on sentences and systems it was compared to when
CU-BOJAR was not in the block and/or whether the
81 blocks do not provide a reliable picture.

son, we asked the main authors of both CU-BOJAR
and CU-TECTO to carry out a blind pairwise com-
parison on the exact set of 63 sentences appearing
across the 81 blocks in which both systems were
ranked. As the totals in Table 7 would suggest,
each author unwittingly recognized his system and
slightly preferred it. The details however reveal a
subtler reason for the low agreement: one of the
annotators was less picky about MT quality and
accepted 10+5 sentences completely rejected by
the other annotator. In total, these two annotators
agreed on 9 + 13 + 2 + 11 = 35 (56%) of cases
and their pairwise κ is 0.387.

A further annotation of these 63 sentences by
four more people completes the blurry picture:
the pairwise κ for each pair of our five annota-
tors ranges from 0.242 to 0.615 with the aver-
age 0.407±0.106. The multi-annotator κ (Fleiss,
1971) is 0.394 and all six annotators agree on a
single label only in 24% of cases. The agree-
ment is not better even if we merge the categories
“Both fine” and “Both wrong” into a single one:
The pairwise κ ranges from 0.212 to 0.620 with
the average 0.405±0.116, the multi-annotator κ is
0.391. Individual annotations are given in Table 8.

Naturally, the set of these 63 sentences is not a
representative sample. Even if one of the systems

actually won, such an observation could not have
been generalized to other test sets. The purpose
of the exercise was to check whether we are at all
able to agree which of the systems translates this
specific set of sentences better. As it turns out,
even a simple pairwise ranking can fail to pro-
vide an answer because different annotators sim-
ply have different preferences.

Finally, Table 9 illustrates how poor the
WMT10 rankings can be. The exact same string
produced by two systems was ranked differently
each time – by the same annotator. (The hypothe-
sis is a plausible translation, only the information
structure of the sentence is slightly distorted so the
translation may not fit well it the surrounding con-
text.)

3 The Impact of the Reference
Translation

3.1 Bad Reference Translations

Figure 5 illustrates the impact of poor reference
translation on manual ranking as carried out in
Section 2.5.2. Of our six independent annotations,
three annotators marked the hypotheses as “both
fine” given the match with the source and three
annotators marked them as “both wrong” due to
the mismatch with the reference. Given the con-
struction of the WMT test set, this particular sen-
tence comes from a Spanish original and it was
most likely translated directly to both English and
Czech.

German evaluation.

3.2 Reference Can Skew Pairwise
Comparisons

The exact set of competing systems in each 5-fold
ranking in WMT10 evaluation is random. The “≥
others” however is affected by this: a system may
suffer more losses if often compared to the refer-
ence, and similarly it may benefit from being com-
pared to a poor competitor.

To check this, we calculate the correlation be-
tween the relative presence of the reference among
the blocks where a system was judged and the
system’s official “≥ others” score. Across lan-
guage, there is almost no correlation (Pearson’s
coefficient: −0.107). However, for some language
pairs, the correlation is apparent, as listed in Ta-
ble 10. Negative correlation means: the more of-
ten the system was compared along with the refer-
ence, the worse the score of the system.

Figure 6 plots the extreme case of English-
German evaluation.

4 Other WMT10 Tasks

4.1 Blind Post-Editing Unreliable
WMT often carries out one more type of manual
evaluation: “Editing the output of systems without
displaying the source or a reference translation,
and then later judging whether edited translations
were correct.” (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). We
call the evaluation “blind post-editing” for short.

We feel that blind post-editing is more infor-
mative than system ranking. First, it constitutes
a unique comprehensibility test, and after all, MT
should aim at comprehensible output in the first
place. Second, blind post-editing can be further
analyzed to search for specific errors in system
output, see Bojar (2011) for a preliminary study.

Unfortunately, the amount of post-edits col-
lected in WMT10 varied a lot across systems and
language pairs. Table 11 provides the minimum,
average and maximum number of post-edits of
outputs of a particular MT system. We see that
e.g. while English-to-Czech has many judgments
of this kind per system, Czech-to-English is one of
the worst supported directions.

It is not surprising that conclusions based on 5
observations can be extremely deceiving. For in-
stance CU-BOJAR seems to produce 60% of out-
puts comprehensible (and thus wins in Figure 3 on
page 12 in the WMT overview paper), far better
than CMU. This is not in line with the ranking re-
sults where both rank equally (Table 5 on page 10
in the WMT overview paper). In fact, CU-BOJAR
was post-edited 5 times and 3 of these post-edits
were acceptable while CMU was post-edited 30
times and 5 of these post-edits were acceptable.

4.2 A Remark on System Combination Task
One results of WMT10 not observed in previous
years was that system combinations indeed per-
formed better than individual systems. Previous

years failed to show this clearly, because Google
Translate used to be included among the combined
systems, making it hard to improve. In WMT10,
Google Translate was excluded from system com-
bination task (except for translations involving
Czech, where it was accidentally included).

Our Table 12 provides an additional explanation
why the presence of Google among combined sys-
tems leads to inconclusive results. While the test
set was easier (based on BLEU) than the develop-
ment set for most systems, it was much harder for
Google. All system combinations were thus likely
to overfit and select Google n-grams most often.
Without access to Google powerful language mod-
els, the combination systems were likely to under-
perform Google in final fluency of the output.

5 Further Issues of Manual Evaluation

We have already seen that the comprehensibility
test by blind post-editing provides a different pic-
ture of the systems than the official ranking. Berka
et al. (2011) introduced a third “quiz-based evalu-
ation”. The quiz-like evaluation used the English-
to-Czech WMT10 systems, applied to different
texts: short text snippets were translated and an-
notators were asked to answer three yes/no ques-
tions complementing each snippet. The order of
the systems was rather different from the official
WMT10 results: CU-TECTO won the quiz-based
evaluation despite being the fourth in WMT10.

Because the texts were different in WMT10 and
the quiz-based evaluation, we asked a small group
of annotators to apply the ranking technique on the
text snippets. While not exactly comparable to the
WMT10 ranking, the WMT10 ranking was con-
firmed: CU-TECTO was again among the lowest-
scoring systems and Google won the ranking.

Bojar (2011) applies the error-flagging manual
evaluation by Vilar et al. (2006) to four systems
of WMT09 English-to-Czech task. Again, the
overall order of the systems is somewhat differ-
ent when ranked by the number of errors flagged.

Mireia Farrús and Fonollosa (2010) use a coarser
but linguistically motivated error classification for
Catalan-Spanish and suggest that differences in
ranking are caused by annotators treating some
types of errors as more serious.

In short, different types of manual evaluations
lead to different results even when identical sys-
tems and texts are evaluated.

6 Conclusion

We took a deeper look at the results of the WMT10
manual evaluation, and based on our observations,
we have some recommendations for future evalu-
ations:

• We propose to use a score which ignores
ties instead of the official “≥ others” metric
which rewards ties and “> others” which pe-
nalizes ties. Another score, “≥ all in block”,
could help identify which systems are more
dominant.

• Inter-annotator agreement decreases dramat-
ically with sentence length; we recommend
including fewer sentences per block, at least
for longer sentences.

• We suggest agreement be measured based on
an empirical estimate of P (E), or at least us-
ing a more correct random clicking P (E) =
0.36.

• There is evidence of a negative correlation
between the number of times a system is
judged and its score; we recommend a deeper
analysis of this issue.

• We recommend the reference be sampled at
a lower rate than other systems, so as to play
a smaller role in the evaluation. We also rec-
ommend better quality control over the pro-
duction of the references.

And to the readers of the WMT overview paper,
we point out:

• Pairwise comparisons derived from 5-fold
rankings are sometimes unreliable. Even a
targeted pairwise comparison of two systems
can shed little light as to which is superior.

• The acceptability of post-edits is sometimes
very unreliable due to the low number of ob-
servations.
