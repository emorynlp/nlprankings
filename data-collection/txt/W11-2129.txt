Abstract

In many languages the use of compound
words is very productive. A common practice
to reduce sparsity consists in splitting com-
pounds in the training data. When this is done,
the system incurs the risk of translating com-
ponents in non-consecutive positions, or in the
wrong order. Furthermore, a post-processing
step of compound merging is required to re-
construct compound words in the output. We
present a method for increasing the chances
that components that should be merged are
translated into contiguous positions and in the
right order. We also propose new heuristic
methods for merging components that outper-
form all known methods, and a learning-based
method that has similar accuracy as the heuris-
tic method, is better at producing novel com-
pounds, and can operate with no background
linguistic resources.

1 Introduction

In many languages including most of the Germanic
(German, Swedish etc.) and Uralic (Finnish, Hun-
garian etc.) language families so-called closed com-
pounds are used productively. Closed compounds
are written as single words without spaces or other
word boundaries, as the Swedish:

gatstenshuggare gata + sten + huggare
paving stone cutter street stone cutter

To cope with the productivity of the phenomenon,
any effective strategy should be able to correctly
process compounds that have never been seen in the
training data as such, although possibly their com-
ponents have, either in isolation or within a different
compound.

The extended use of compounds make them prob-
lematic for machine translation. For translation into
a compounding language, often fewer compounds
than in normal texts are produced. This can be due
to the fact that the desired compounds are missing in
the training data, or that they have not been aligned
correctly. When a compound is the idiomatic word
choice in the translation, a MT system can often
produce separate words, genitive or other alternative
constructions, or translate only one part of the com-
pound.

Most research on compound translation in com-
bination with SMT has been focused on transla-
tion from a compounding language, into a non-
compounding one, typically into English. A com-
mon strategy then consists in splitting compounds
into their components prior to training and transla-
tion.

Only few have investigated translation into a com-
pounding language. For translation into a com-
pounding language, the process becomes:

• Splitting compounds on the target (compound-
ing language) side of the training corpus;

• Learn a translation model from this split train-
ing corpus from source (e.g. English) into
decomposed-target (e.g. decomposed-German)

• At translation time, translate using the learned
model from source into decomposed-target.

• Apply a post-processing “merge” step to recon-
struct compounds.

The merging step must solve two problems: identify
which words should be merged into compounds, and
choose the correct form of the compound parts.

250



The former problem can become hopelessly diffi-
cult if the translation did not put components nicely
side by side and in the correct order. Preliminary
to merging, then, the problem of promoting transla-
tions where compound elements are correctly posi-
tioned needs to be addressed. We call this promoting
compound coalescence.

2 Related work

The first suggestion of a compound merging method
for MT that we are aware of was described by
Popović et al. (2006). Each word in the translation
output is looked up in a list of compound parts, and
merged with the next word if it results in a known
compound. This method led to improved overall
translation results from English to German. Stymne
(2008) suggested a merging method based on part-
of-speech matching, in a factored translation system,
where compound parts had a special part-of-speech
tag, and compound parts are only merged with the
next word if the part-of-speech tags match. This re-
sulted in improved translation quality from English
to German, and from English to Swedish (Stymne
and Holmqvist, 2008). Another method, based on
several decoding runs, was investigated by Fraser
(2009).

Stymne (2009a) investigated and compared merg-
ing methods inspired by Popović et al. (2006),
Stymne (2008) and a method inspired by morphol-
ogy merging (El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2006; Virpi-
oja et al., 2007), where compound parts were anno-
tated with symbols, and parts with symbols in the
translation output were merged with the next word.

3 Promoting coalescence of compounds

If compounds are split in the training set, then there
is no guarantee that translations of components will
end up in contiguous positions and in the correct or-
der. This is primarily a language model problem,
and we will model it as such by applying POS lan-
guage models on specially designed part-of-speech
sets, and by applying language model inspired count
features.

The approach proposed in Stymne (2008) consists
in running a POS tagger on the target side of the cor-
pus, decompose only tokens with some predefined
POS (e.g. Nouns), and then marking with special

POS-tags whether an element is a head or a modi-
fier. As an example, the German compound “Fremd-
sprachenkenntnisse”, originally tagged as N(oun),
would be decomposed and re-tagged before training
as:

fremd sprachen kenntnisse
N-Modif N-Modif N

A POS n-gram language model using these extended
tagset, then, naturally steers the decoder towards
translations with good relative placement of these
components

We modify this approach by blurring distinctions
among POS not relevant to the formation of com-
pounds, thus further reducing the tagset to only three
tags:

• N-p – all parts of a split compound except the
last

• N – the last part of the compound (its head) and
all other nouns

• X – all other tokens

The above scheme assumes that only noun com-
pounds are treated but it could easily be extended to
other types of compounds. Alternatively, splitting
can be attempted irrespective of POS on all tokens
longer than a fixed threshold, removing the need of
a POS tagger.

3.1 Sequence models as count features
We expect a POS-based n-gram language model on
our reduced tagset to learn to discourage sequences
unseen in the training data, such as the sequence
of compound parts not followed by a suitable head.
Such a generative LM, however, might also have a
tendency to bias lexical selection towards transla-
tions with fewer compounds, since the correspond-
ing tag sequences might be more common in text.
To compensate for this bias, we experiment with in-
jecting a little dose of a-priori knowledge, and add a
count feature, which explicitly counts the number of
occurrences of POS-sequences which we deem good
and bad in the translation output.

Table 1 gives an overview of the possible bigram
combinations, using the three symbol tagset, plus
sentence beginning and end markers, and their judg-
ment as good, bad or neutral.

251



Combination Judgment
N-p N-p Good
N-p N Good
N-p < \s > Bad
N-p X Bad
all other combinations Neutral

Table 1: Tag combinations in the translation output

We define two new feature functions: one count-
ing the number of occurrences of Good sequences
(the Boost model) and the other counting the occur-
rences of Bad sequences (the Punish model). The
two models can be used either in isolation or com-
bined, with or without a further POS n-gram lan-
guage model.

4 Merging compounds

Once a translation is generated using a system
trained on split compounds, a post-processing step
is required to merge components back into com-
pounds. For all pairs of consecutive tokens we have
to decide whether to combine them or not. Depend-
ing on the language and on preprocessing choices,
we might also have to decide whether to apply any
boundary transformation like e.g. inserting an ’s’ be-
tween components.

The method proposed in Popović et al. (2006)
maintains a list of known compounds and compound
modifiers. For any pair of consecutive tokens, if the
first is in the list of known modifiers and the com-
bination of the two is in the list of compounds, than
the two tokens are merged.

A somewhat orthogonal approach is the one pro-
posed in Stymne (2008): tokens are labeled with
POS-tags; compound modifiers are marked with
special POS-tags based on the POS of the head. If
a word with a modifier POS-tag is followed by ei-
ther another modifier POS-tag of the same type, or
the corresponding head POS-tag, then the two to-
kens are merged.

In the following sections we describe how we
modify and combine these two heuristics, and how
we alternatively formulate the problem as a se-
quence labelling problem suitable for a machine
learning approach.

4.1 Improving and combining heuristics

We empirically verified that the simple heuristics in
Popović et al. (2006) tends to misfire quite often,
leading to too many compounds. We modify it by
adding an additional check: tokens are merged if
they appear combined in the list of compounds, but
only if their observed frequency as a compound is
larger than their frequency as a bigram. This blocks
the merging of many consecutive words, which just
happen to form a, often unrelated, compound when
merged, such as för små (too small) into försmå
(spurn) in Swedish. Compound and bigram frequen-
cies can be computed on any available monolingual
corpus in the domain of interest.

We furthermore observed that the (improved) list-
based heuristic and the method based on POS pat-
terns lead to complementary sets of false negatives.
We thus propose to combine the two heuristics in
this way: we merge two consecutive tokens if they
would be combined by either the list-based heuris-
tic or the POS-based heuristic. We empirically veri-
fied improved performance when combining heuris-
tics in this way (Section 5.2).

4.2 Compound merging as sequence labelling

Besides extending and combining existing heuris-
tics, we propose a novel formulation of compound
merging as a sequence labelling problem. The oppo-
site problem, compound splitting, has successfully
been cast as a sequence labelling problem before
(Dyer, 2010), but here we apply this formulation in
the opposite direction.

Depending on choices made at compound split-
ting time, this task can be either a binary or mul-
ticlass classification task. If compound parts were
kept as-is, the merging task is a simple concatena-
tion of two words, and each separation point must
receive a binary label encoding whether the two to-
kens should be merged. An option at splitting time
is to normalize compound parts, which often have
a morphological form specific to compounds, to a
canonical form (Stymne, 2009b). In this case the
compound form has to be restored before concate-
nating the parts. This can be modeled as a multi-
class classifier that have the possible boundary trans-
formations as its classes.

Consider for instance translating into German the

252



English sentence:

Europe should promote the knowledge of
foreign languages

Assuming that the training corpus did not con-
tain occurrences of the pair (“knowledge of foreign
languages”,”fremdsprachenkenntnisse”) but con-
tained occurrences of (“knowledge”,”kenntnisse”),
(“foreign”,”fremd”) and (“languages”,”sprachen”),
then the translation model from English into
decomposed-German could be able to produce:

Europa sollte fremd sprachen kenntnisse
fördern

We cast the problem of merging compounds as one
of making a series of correlated binary decisions,
one for each pair of consecutive words, each decid-
ing whether the whitespace between the two words
should be suppressed (label “1”) or not (label “0”).
In the case above, the correct labelling for the sen-
tence would be {0,0,1,1,0}, reconstructing the cor-
rect German:

Europa sollte fremdsprachenkenntnisse
fördern1

If conversely, components are normalized upon
splitting, then labels are no longer binary, but come
from a set describing all local orthographic transfor-
mations possible for the language under considera-
tion. In this work we limited our attention to the case
when compounds are not normalized upon splitting,
and labels are hence binary.

While in principle one could address each atomic
merging decision independently, it seems intuitive
that a decision taken at one point should influence
merging decisions in neighboring separation points.
For this reason, instead of a simple (binary or n-
ary) classification problem, we prefer a sequence la-
belling formulation.

The array of sequence labelling algorithms po-
tentially suitable to our problem is fairly broad, in-
cluding Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner,
1989), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty
et al., 2001), structured perceptrons (Collins, 2002),

1Nouns in German are capitalized. This is normally dealt
as a further “truecasing” postprocessing, and is an orthogonal
problem from the one we deal with here.

and more. Since the focus of this work is on the
application rather than on a comparison among al-
ternative structured learning approaches, we limited
ourselves to a single implementation. Considering
its good scaling capabilities, appropriateness in pres-
ence of strongly redundant and overlapping features,
and widespread recognition in the NLP community,
we chose to use Conditional Random Fields.

4.2.1 Features
Each sequence item (i.e. each separation point be-
tween words) is represented by means of a sparse
vector of features. We used:

• Surface words: word-1, word+1

• Part-of-speech: POS-1, POS+1

• Character n-grams around the merge point

– 3 character suffix of word-1
– 3 character prefix of word+1
– Combinations crossing the merge points:

1+3, 3+1, 3+3 characters

• Normalized character n-grams around the
merge point, where characters are replaced by
phonetic approximations, and grouped accord-
ing to phonetic distribution, see Figure 1 (only
for Swedish)

• Frequencies from the training corpus, binned
by the following method:

f̄ =

{
10blog10(f)c if f > 1
f otherwise

for the following items:

– bigram, word-1,word+1
– Compound resulting from merging word-

1,word+1
– Word-1 as a true prefix of words in the cor-

pus
– Word+1 as a true suffix of words in the

corpus

• Frequency comparisons of two different fre-
quencies in the training corpus, classified into
four categories: freq1 = freq2 = 0, freq1 <
freq2, freq1 = freq2, freq1 > freq2

– word-1 as true prefix vs single word
– word+1 as true suffix vs single word

where -1 refers to the word before the merge point,
and +1 to the word after.

We aimed to include features representing the
knowledge available to the list and POS heuristics,
by including part-of-speech tags and frequencies for
compounds and bigrams, as well as a comparison
between them. Features were also inspired by pre-
vious work on compound splitting, based on the in-
tuition that features that are useful for splitting com-
pounds, could also be useful for merging. Charac-
ter n-grams has successfully been used for splitting
Swedish compounds, as the only knowledge source
by Brodda (1979), and as one of several knowl-
edge sources by Sjöbergh and Kann (2004). Friberg
(2007) tried to normalize letters, beside using the
original letters. While she was not successful, we
still believe in the potential of this feature. Larson et
al. (2000), used frequencies of prefixes and suffixes
from a corpus, as a basis of their method for splitting
German compounds.

4.2.2 Training data for the sequence labeler
Since features are strongly lexicalized, a suitably
large training dataset is required to prevent overfit-
ting, ruling out the possibility of manual labelling.

We created our training data automatically, using
the two heuristics described earlier, plus a third one
enabled by the availability, when estimating parame-
ters for the CRF, of a reference translation: merge if
two tokens are observed combined in the reference
translation (possibly as a sub-sequence of a longer
word). We compared multiple alternative combina-
tions of heuristics on a validation dataset. The val-
idation and test data were created by applying all
heuristics, and then manually check all positive an-
notations.

A first possibility to automatically generate a
training dataset consists in applying the compound
splitting preprocessing of choice to the target side of
the parallel training corpus for the SMT system: sep-
aration points where merges should occur are thus
trivially identified. In practice, however, merging
decisions will need be taken on the noisy output of
the SMT system, and not on the clean training data.
To acquire training data that is similar to the test
data, we could have held out from SMT training a
large fraction of the training data, used the trained
SMT to translate the source side of it, and then la-
bel decision points according to the heuristics. This
would, however, imply making a large fraction of
the data unavailable to training of the SMT. We thus
settled for a compromise: we trained the SMT sys-
tem on the whole training data, translated the whole
source, then labeled decision points according to the
heuristics. The translations we obtain are thus bi-
ased, of higher quality than those we should expect
to obtain on unseen data. Nevertheless they are sub-
stantially more similar to what will be observed in
operations than the reference translations.

5 Experiments

We performed experiments on translation from En-
glish into Swedish and Danish on two different cor-
pora, an automotive corpus collected from a propri-
etary translation memory, and on Europarl (Koehn,
2005) for the merging experiments. We used fac-
tored translation (Koehn and Hoang, 2007), with
both surface words and part-of-speech tags on the

al., 2005) and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), both stan-
dard statistical phrase based decoders. For parame-
ter optimization we used minimum error rate train-
ing (Och, 2003) with Moses and gradient ascent on
smoothed NIST for the in-house decoder. In the
merging experiments we used the CRF++ toolkit.2

Compounds were split before training using a
corpus-based method (Koehn and Knight, 2003;
Stymne, 2008). For each word we explored all pos-
sible segmentations into parts that had at least 3
characters, and choose the segmentation which had
the highest arithmetic mean of frequencies for each
part in the training corpus. We constrained the split-
ting based on part-of-speech by only allowing split-
ting options where the compound head had the same
tag as the full word. The split compound parts kept
their form, which can be special to compounds, and
no symbols or other markup were added.

The experiment setup is summarized in Table 2.
The extra training sentences for CRF are sentences
that were not also used to train the SMT system. For
tuning, test and validation data we used 1,000 sen-
tence sets, except for Swedish auto, where we used
2,000 sentences for tuning. In the Swedish experi-
ments we split nouns, adjectives and verbs, and used
the full POS-set, except in the coalescence exper-
iments where we compared the full and restricted
POS-sets. For Danish we only split nouns, and
used the restricted POS-set. For frequency calcu-
lations of compounds and compound parts that were
needed for compound splitting and some of the com-

pound merging strategies, we used the respective
training data in all cases. Significance testing was
performed using approximate randomization (Rie-
zler and Maxwell, 2005), with 10,000 iterations, and
α < 0.05.

5.1 Experiments: Promoting compound
coalescence

We performed experiments with factored translation
models with the restricted part-of-speech set on the
Danish and Swedish automotive corpus. In these ex-
periments we compared the restricted part-of-speech
set we suggest in this work to several baseline sys-
tems without any compound processing and with
factored models using the extended part-of-speech
set suggested by Stymne (2008). Compound parts
were merged using the POS-based heuristic. Results
are reported on two standard metrics, NIST (Dod-
dington, 2002) and Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002), on
lower-cased data. For all sequence models we use
3-grams.

Results on the two Automotive corpora are sum-
marized in Table 3. The scores are very high, which
is due to the fact that it is an easy domain with many
repetitive sentence types. On the Danish dataset,
we observe significant improvements in BLEU and
NIST over the baseline for all methods where com-
pounds were split before translation and merged af-
terwards. Some of the gain is already obtained us-
ing a language model on the extended part-of-speech
set. Additional gains can however be obtained us-
ing instead a language model on a reduced set of
POS-tags (RPOS), and with a count feature explic-
itly boosting desirable RPOS sequences. The count
feature on undesirable sequences did not bring any

255



improvements over any of the systems with com-
pound splitting.

Results on the Swedish automotive corpus are less
clear-cut than for Danish, with mostly insignificant
differences between systems. The system with de-
composition and a restricted part-of-speech model
is significantly better on Bleu than all other systems,
except the system with decomposition and a stan-
dard part-of-speech model. Not splitting actually
gives the highest NIST score, even though the dif-
ference to the other systems is not significant, ex-
cept for the system with a combination of a trained
RPOS model and a boost model, which also has sig-
nificantly lower Bleu score than the other systems
with compound splitting.

5.2 Experiments: Compound merging
We compared alternative combinations of heuristics
on our three validation datasets, see Figure 2. In
order to estimate the amount of false negatives for
all three heuristics, we inspected the first 100 sen-
tences of each validation set, looking for words that
should be merged, but were not marked by any of
the heuristics. In no case we could find any such
words, so we thus assume that between them, the
heuristics can find the overwhelming majority of all
compounds to be merged.

We conducted a round of preliminary experiments
to identify the best combination of the heuristics
available at training time (modified list-based, POS-
based, and reference-based) to use to create auto-
matically the training data for the CRF. Best results
on the validation data are obtained by different com-
bination of heuristics for the three datasets, as could
be expected by the different distribution of errors
in Figure 2. In the experiments below we trained
the CRF using for each dataset the combination of
heuristics corresponding to leaving out the grey por-
tions of the Venn diagrams. This sort of prelimi-
nary optimization requires hand-labelling a certain
amount of data. Based on our experiments, skipping
this optimization and just using ref∨(list∧POS) (the
optimal configuration for the Swedish-English Eu-
roparl corpus) seems to be a reasonable alternative.

The validation data was also used to set a fre-
quency cut-off for feature occurrences (set at 3 in
the following experiments) and to tune the regu-
larization parameter in the CRF objective function.

Results are largely insensitive to variations in these
hyper-parameters, especially to the CRF regulariza-
tion parameter.

For the Danish auto corpus we had access to train-
ing data that were not also used to train the SMT
system, that we used to compare the performance
with that on the possibly biased training data that
was also used to train the SMT system. There were
no significant differences between the two types of
training data on validation data, which confirmed
that reusing the SMT training data for CRF training
was a reasonable strategy.

The overall merging results of the heuristics, the
best sequence labeler, and the sequence labeler with-
out POS are shown in Table 4. Notice how the (mod-
ified) list and POS heuristics have complementary
sets of false negatives: when merging on the OR of
the two heuristics, the number of false negatives de-
creases drastically, in general compensating for the
inevitable increase in false positives.

Among the heuristics, the combination of the im-
proved list heuristic and the POS-based heuristic has
a significantly higher recall and F-score than the
POS-based heuristic alone in all cases except on the
validation data for Swedish Auto, and than the list-
based strategy in several cases. The list heuristic
alone performs reasonably well on the two Swedish
data sets, but has a very low recall on the Danish
dataset. In all three cases the SMT training data
has been used for the list used by the heuristic, so
this is unexpected, especially considering the fact
that the Danish dataset is in the same domain as
one of the Swedish datasets. The Danish training
data is smaller than the Swedish data though, which

might be an influencing factor. It is possible that this
heuristic could perform better also for Danish given
more data for frequency calculations.

The sequence labeler is competitive with the
heuristics; on F-score it is only significantly worse
than any of the heuristics once, for Danish auto test
data, and in several cases it has a significantly higher
F-score than some of the heuristics. The sequence
labeler has a higher precision, significantly so in
three cases, than the best heuristic, the combina-
tion heuristic, which is positive, since erroneously
merged compounds are usually more disturbing for
a reader or post-editor than non-merged compounds.

The sequence-labelling approach can be used also
in the absence of a POS tagger, which can be impor-
tant if no such tool of suitable quality is available
for the target language and the domain of interest.
We thus also trained a CRF-based compound merger
without using POS features, and without using the
POS-based heuristic when constructing the training
data. Compared to the CRF with access to POS-tags,
on validation data F-score is significantly worse on
the Europarl Swedish condition and the Automotive
Danish condition, and are unchanged on Automo-
tive Swedish. On test data there are no significant
differences of the two sequence labelers on the two
Automotive corpora. On Swedish Europarl, the CRF
without POS has a higher recall at the cost of a lower
precision. Compared to the list heuristic, which is
the only other alternative strategy that works in the
absence of a POS tagger, the CRF without POS per-
forms significantly better on recall and F-score for
Danish automotive, and mostly comparative on the
two Swedish corpora.

Table 4: Precision, Recall, and F-score for compound merging methods based on heuristics or sequence labelling on
validation data and on held-out test data. The superscripts marks the systems that are significantly worse than the
system in question (l-list, p-POS, lp-list∨POS, c-best CRF configuration, cp-CRF without POS).

The sequence labeler has the advantage over
the heuristics that it is able to merge completely
novel compounds, whereas the list strategy can
only merge compounds that it has seen, and the
POS-based strategy can create novel compounds,
but only with known modifiers. An inspection of
the test data showed that there were a few novel
compounds merged by the sequence labeler that
were not identified with either of the heuristics. In
the test data we found knap+start (button start)
and vand+nedsænkning (water submersion) in Dan-
ish Auto, and kvarts sekel (quarter century) and
bostad(s)+ersättning (housing grant) in Swedish
Europarl. This confirms that the sequence labeler,
from automatically labeled data based on heuristics,
can learn to merge new compounds that the heuris-
tics themselves cannot find.

6 Discussion and conclusions

In this article, we described several methods for
promoting coalescence and deciding if and how to
merge word compounds that are either competitive
with, or superior to, any currently known method.

For promoting compound coalescence we exper-
imented with introducing additional LMs based on
a restricted set of POS-tags, and with dedicated
SMT model features counting the number of se-
quences known a priori to be desirable and unde-
sirable. Experiments showed that this method can
lead to large improvements over systems using no
compound processing, and over previously known
compound processing methods.

For merging, we improved an existing list-based
heuristic, consisting in checking whether the first of
two consecutive words has been observed in a cor-
pus as a compound modifier and their combination
has been observed as a compound, introducing the
additional constraint that words are merged only if
their corpus frequency as a compound is larger than
their frequency as a bigram.

We observed that the false negatives of this im-
proved list-based heuristic and of another, known,
heuristic based on part-of-speech tags were comple-
mentary, and proposed a logical OR of them that
generally improves over both.

We furthermore cast the compound merging prob-

258



lem as a sequence labelling problem, opening it to
solutions based on a broad array of models and al-
gorithms. We experimented with one model, Condi-
tional Random Fields, designed a set of easily com-
puted features reaching beyond the information ac-
cessed by the heuristics, and showed that it gives
very competitive results.

Depending on the choice of the features, the se-
quence labelling approach has the potential to be
truly productive, i.e. to form new compounds in
an unrestricted way. This is for instance the case
with the feature set we experimented with. The list-
based heuristic is not productive: it can only form
a compound if this was already observed as such.
The POS-based heuristic presents some limited pro-
ductivity. Since it uses special POS-tags for com-
pound modifiers, it can form a compound provided
its head has been seen alone or as a head, and its
modifier(s) have been seen elsewhere, possibly sep-
arately, as modifier(s) of compounds. The sequence
labelling approach can decide to merge two consec-
utive words even if neither was ever seen before in a
compound.

In this paper we presented results on Swedish and
Danish. We believe that the methods would work
well also for other compounding languages such as
German and Finnish. If the linguistic resources re-
quired to extract some of the features, e.g. a POS
tagger, are unavailable (or are available only at train-
ing time but not in operations) for some language,
the sequence-labelling method can still be applied. It
is competitive or better than the list heuristic, which
is the only heuristic available in that scenario.

Experiments on three datasets show that the im-
proved and combined heuristics perform generally
better than any already known method, and that, be-
sides being fully productive, the sequence-labelling
version is highly competitive, tends to generate
fewer false positives than the combination heuristic,
and can be used flexibly with limited or no linguistic
resources.
