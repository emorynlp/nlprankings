STTS 2.0? Improving the Tagset for the Part-of-Speech-Tagging of 
German Spoken Data

Abstract 

Part-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging) of spoken data requires different means of annotation 
than POS-tagging of written and edited texts. In order to capture the features of German spo-
ken language, a distinct tagset is needed to respond to the kinds of elements which only occur 
in speech. In order to create such a coherent tagset the most prominent phenomena of spoken 
language need to be analyzed, especially with respect to how they differ from written lan-
guage. First evaluations have shown that the most prominent cause (over 50%) of errors in the 
existing automatized POS-tagging of transcripts of spoken German with the Stuttgart Tübingen 
Tagset (STTS) and the treetagger was the inaccurate interpretation of speech particles. One 
reason for this is that this class of words is virtually absent from the current STTS. This paper 
proposes a recategorization of the STTS in the field of speech particles based on distributional 
factors rather than semantics. The ultimate aim is to create a comprehensive reference corpus 
of spoken German data for the global research community. It is imperative that all phenomena 
are reliably recorded in future part-of-speech tag labels. 

1 Introduction 
In the Institute for German Language (Institut für Deutsche Sprache, IDS Mannheim) a large reference 
corpus of German spoken data is currently being built. It already contains more than 100 hours of tran-
scribed audio material, i.e. about one million tokens. The aim of my dissertation is to annotate the cor-
pus with Part-of-Speech-tags (POS-tags) and thus to tackle the theoretical problems which originate 
from the differences between spoken and written language. On the one hand, as the corpus is growing 
fast, ways must be found to automate this, i.e. without manual correction. On the other hand there are 
no tools to accomplish such a task at present. First tests running the treetagger (Schmid 1995) with the 
Stuttgart Tübingen Tagset (STTS) (Schiller et al. 1999), which on written data show an accuracy of 
97.53% (Schmid 1995) have shown that the accuracy of these tools on spoken data is far below ac-
ceptable, i.e. they only show an accuracy of 81.16% (Westpfahl and Schmidt 2013). There are two 
main reasons for this. First of all, the structure of German spoken language is quite different from the 
structure of German written language due to many elliptic structures, disruptions, repetitions etc. Fur-
thermore, punctuation is not annotated in the corpus; hence the algorithms have no “proper sentences” 
to work with.  

As was shown in the studies of Westpfahl and Schmidt (2013) and Rehbein and Schalowski (2013), 
the mistakes in annotating POS-tags on German spoken language are due to a lack of suitable catego-
ries in the tagset; namely categories which reflect the manifold speech particles, vernacular use of pro-
nouns, verbs and items which are impossible to categorize grammatically. As can be seen in Table 1, a 
first analysis of tagging errors showed that more than 50% of the mistakes are due to mis-tagged dis-
course markers, interjections and speech particles. Hence, to reach the goal of an automatized POS-
tagging, the tagset must firstly be adapted to those phenomena. It is the aim of this paper to provide a 
theoretical foundation on how to comply with the need to re-categorize the existing tag set for speech 
particles; creation of new tags and merging of existing tags are both proposed as seems relevant for the 
particular data. Problems which are due to verbs, pronouns and non-words cannot be discussed here.

2 Related work 
Various spoken language corpora which are annotated with POS tags already exist. English language 
corpora are for example the BNC (Burnard 2007), the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al. 1992), Vi-
enna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE) (VOICE 2013) and the Christine Corpus 
(Sampson 2000). While both the Switchboard corpus and the BNC use POS tag-sets developed for 
written data, VOICE and the Christine corpus adapted theirs specifically for spoken language. VOICE 
added 26 POS tags to the Penn treebank POS tagset which include tags for, among others, discourse 
markers or response particles and also non-verbal elements like laughter and breathing. The Christine 
corpus uses a very fine grained tagset with more than 400 tags annotating morpho-syntactic as well as 
rich pragmatic information.  

A POS tagset which has been especially designed for a corpus of spoken language is the tagset of 
the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oosterdijk 2000). However, although the tagset consists of more than 300 
tags, all discourse related items are tagged as interjections.  

For the German language there is the Tübingen Treebank of Spoken German (TüBa-D/S), which 
uses the STTS with no alterations whatsoever (Telljohann et al. 2012). 

In order to find a solution on how to tag non-standard texts with the STTS, an interest group was set 
up in 2012. Within this interest group a work group formed which especially focused their attention on 
the adaption of the STTS for spoken language and computer mediated language (CMC), namely for 
the corpora Kietz-Deutsch Corpus, the Dortmund chat corpus and our corpus (DGD2/FOLK). As a 
first result, three papers were published with some suggestions on which phenomena should be repre-
sented in an adapted tagset (Rehbein and Schalowski 2013; Bartz et al. 2013; Westpfahl and Schmidt 
2013). The present paper is meant to give an overview of a theoretical foundation on how to comply 
with the need to recategorize the tagset with respect to speech particles, as so far only a “purely data-
driven” approach has been discussed (Rehbein and Schalowski 2013). 

3 Speech particles in the original STTS 
The Stuttgart Tübingen Tagset (STTS) was conceptually developed for a corpus of newspaper arti-

cles and only those classes of words which were frequently used were represented in the tagset. There-
fore, modal particles, speech particles or discourse markers were not at the center of attention of Schil-
ler et al. (1999) as their use in written texts is commonly understood to be 'bad style'. To understand 
the changes I have made in the tagset I shall first present the categories used for particles and dis-
course markers in the original tagset: 
Table 2 categories for speech particles in the original STTS 

Tags Description Example Literal English translation 
PTKVZ verbal particles [er gab] auf [he gave] up 
PTKZU particle used with infinitives zu [gehen] to [walk] 
PTKA particle used with adjectives or adverbs am [schönsten], zu [schnell] most [beautiful], too [fast] 
PTKNEG negation particle nicht not 
PTKANT response particles ja, nein, danke, bitte yes, no, thanks, please 
ITJ interjections mhm, ach, tja uhum, oh, well 

As one can see, the STTS is structured hierarchically; for particles, the basis tag would be "PTK" 
for "Partikel" and there are five subcategory tags. Furthermore, the tagset provided one category for 
interjections: ITJ, defining them after Bußmann (1990) as words which serve to express emotions, 
swearing and curses and for getting in contact with others. Formally they are invariable and syntacti-
cally independent from the sentence as well as having, strictly speaking, no lexical meaning (Schiller 
et al. 1999, S. 73). 

Concerning modal particles, intensity particles or focus particles etc., the guidelines published with 
the tagset do not assign them their own category. It is implicitly clear from the cited examples that 
modal particles or intensity particles are to be tagged as adverbs "ADV". (Schiller et al. 1999) 

On running the STTS with the treetagger on three transcripts of German spoken data (11029 to-
kens), one finds that 35.76% of all corrected items were incorrectly tagged as adverbs and yet again 
85.87% of those items tagged as adverbs were actually particles or interjections (Westpfahl and 
Schmidt 2013). Thus, the first step in restructuring the tagset would be finding categories differentiat-
ing adverbs from particles as well as interjections and discourse markers.

4 Features of spoken German - Speech particles in German grammar references 
In order to explain the categorization employed in our proposed STTS 2.0 one has to take a deeper 
look at how transcripts of spoken German differ from ‘normal’ written language. First of all, in our 
corpus, no punctuation is annotated and there also is no annotation on where a speaker's turn starts or 
ends. Secondly, it is typical of spoken language that not all utterances form “proper” sentences but are 
quite often disrupted, e.g. marked by extensions or anacolutha, apokoinu-constructions, repairs etc. All 
this would be represented as such in the transcripts.  

Furthermore, there are also differences in the choice of words, i.e. some closed categories contain 
other or more tokens in spoken language and some speech phenomena simply do not occur in written 
language except for, maybe, in quoting direct speech. Some of those phenomena are even hard to de-
scribe as syntactic categories, e.g. hesitation markers or backchannel signals. Nevertheless, exactly 
those phenomena are particularly interesting in working with a corpus of spoken language. 

The approach used for finding categories was to first take a look at the canon of German grammars 
and then check whether the classifications made there could be applied for the corpus data.  

The most consulted grammars for the German language are (Duden 2006), (Zifonun 1997), (Engel 
2004), (Helbig 2011), (Hoffmann 2013), (Weinrich 2005) and the online grammar grammis 2.0 (Insti-
tut für deutsche Sprache 2013). The most consulted articles dealing with speech particles are 
(Burkhardt 1982), (Hentschel and Weydt 2002), (Schwitalla 2012) and (Diewald 2006). 

Looking at this literature it becomes obvious that research on this topic has, so far, not lead to a uni-
fied classification of speech particles, but rather to a plethora of classifications and concepts differing 
at times quite radically in definition and nomenclature. Even the terminology and definitions used for 
the supercategory ‘particles’ vary quite drastically. For some, particles are all word classes which do 
not inflect, hence conjunctions and prepositions would be counted as particles as well (Engel 2004). 
Others differentiate between ‘particles sensu lato’ (particles in the wider sense) and ‘particles in the 
strict sense’ or synsemantica (Hentschel and Weydt 2002; Duden 2006; Burkhardt 1982). Yet again 
others differentiate between those which distributionally contribute to the compositional structure of 
the sentence and those which can form sentence-independent units (Diewald 2006; Weinrich 2005; 
Hoffmann 2013; Zifonun 1997; Institut für deutsche Sprache 2013). For those ‘sentence-independent’ 
units, e.g. interjections and response particles, yet again a variety of terms is used: interactive units 
(“Interaktive Einheiten”) (Hoffmann 2013; Zifonun 1997; Institut für deutsche Sprache 2013), dis-
course particles (Diewald 2006), speaker signals and particles of the dialogue (“Sprechersignale und 
Dialogpartikeln”) (Weinrich 2005) or ‘words of speech’ (“Gesprächswörter”) (Burkhardt 1982). 

As for statistical POS tagging the most important feature is distribution, the differentiation between 
sentence-independent particles and sentence-internal particles seems to be a reasonable basis for clas-
sification. Hence we propose these two major categories for the tagset. However, there are also parti-
cles which are neither sentence-independent nor sentence-internal but are either in the pre-front field 
or in the end field of a sentence, namely discourse particles (“Diskurspartikeln”). Quite surprisingly, 
these phenomena are hardly mentioned in any standard grammar reference at all. The DUDEN (2006), 
Weinrich (2005), Burkhardt (1982) and Diewald (2006) subsume e.g. reinsurance signals (“Rückversi-
cherungssignale”) and starting signals (“Startsignale”) under the term structuring particles 
(“Gliederungspartikeln”), however, no distinction is made on whether they can stand independently 
from the sentence or not (Duden 2006). The other grammars simply do not mention them at all. Never-
theless, a differentiation can be made between sentence-independent, sentence-internal and sentence-
external particles. By ‘external’, I mean that they are not part of the core sentence yet ‘need’ the sen-
tence. So how can these categories be subclassified now and which phenomena fall into these classes? 

4.1 Non-grammatical or sentence-independent elements 
Regarding those particles which are sentence-independent, e.g. “ähm” or “hmm”, it is crucial to 

bear in mind that these phenomena cannot be classified according to their distribution or any syntactic 
features. Hence, the only criterion by which to differentiate them is with respect to their pragmatic 
function. Taking a look at the grammar reference canon, one finds that DUDEN (2006) differentiates 
between interjections and onomatopoeia and subclassifies the former ones into simple and complex 
interjections, i.e. between those which have homonyms in other word classes and those which do not. 
The GDS (Zifonun 1997), Hoffmann’s grammar (2013) and grammis 2.0 (Breindl and Donalies 2012)

differentiate between interjections and response particles (“Responsive”) and Engel’s grammar (2004) 
adds initiating particles (“Initiativpartikeln”) and reaction particles (“Reaktive Partikeln”) to those. In 
contrast to that, Harald Weinrich’s grammar (2005) only defines interjections, but subclassifies those 
into situational, expressive and imitative interjections. Just looking at the terminology used for their 
classifications, one can get a hint of how contradictory the various definitions of interjections are. 
Whether response particles, onomatopoeia, inflectives or filled pauses are all interjections or separate 
classes of their own always depends on how broad or strict a definition for the interjection would be.  

4.2 Sentence-external elements 
Sentence-external particles, namely discourse markers (“Diskursmarker”) and tag questions 

(“Rückversicherungspartikeln”), are not classes which are explicitly named as such in any grammar 
reference yet are controversially debated in the research field of conversation analysis. Only the 
DUDEN uses the term “Diskursmarker” but not in describing it as word class of its own, but only to 
differentiate subjunctions from the use of the same lexeme (e.g. weil or obwohl) with main clauses. 
Nevertheless, in the grammars we do find classes which could be subsumed under these concepts even 
though they are classified as, for example, structuring particles (“Gliederungspartikeln”) (Hentschel 
and Weydt 2002; Burkhardt 1982), dialogue particles (“Dialogpartikeln”) (Weinrich 2005) or “Se-
quenzpartikeln” (sequencing particles) (Hentschel and Weydt 2002). However, in all of these classes 
no differentiation is made between those which are really distributionally bound to the pre-front field 
or the end field and those which are sentence-independent. In the literature on discourse markers there 
is no agreement on what is to be subsumed under that term either. Traugott (1997) and Auer and 
Günthner (2005) define them as every utterance which has a peripheral syntactical position and a 
‘metapragmatic function’. What seems clear is that these phenomena came into existence through 
grammaticalization or degrammaticalization (Gohl and Günthner 1999; Brinton 1996; Günthner 2005; 
Leuschner 2005; Auer and Günthner 2005), hence most of them are homophones of adverbs, conjunc-
tions, subjunctions etc. Imo (2012) yet again clearly differentiates between discourse markers and tag 
questions as, according to him, they have a different function, namely only to demand attention or se-
quencing turns whilst discourse markers would project the continuation of a speaker’s turn (Imo 
2012). 

4.3 Sentence-internal elements 
Analyzing those particle categories, the only ones which seem to be quite indisputable are verbal par-
ticles and the ones which are defined by their form, i.e. the particle “zu” used with the infinitive 
(PTKZU), “am” preceding an adjective (PTKA) and the negation particle “nicht” (PTKNEG), alt-
hough the online grammar grammis 2.0 defines it to be a subclass of the focus particle (Breindl and 
Donalies 2011).

By contrast, table 3 shows that there is much disagreement on how to define or differentiate “Ab-
tönungspartikeln” (I’m not able to find a translation; literally translated it would be something like 
‘shading’ or ‘coloration’ particles, A/N) from modal particles (“Modalpartikeln”), such as German 
mal, halt, doch, or ja. Furthermore, there are differences on whether to make a distinction between 
these two terms, whether to treat them as synonyms (Duden 2006; Breindl and Donalies 2011a) or 
having only one class of items at all (Schwitalla 2012; Diewald 2006; Weinrich 2005; Burkhardt 
1982).  
Looking at the table one can find that the core definitions of those types of particles are very similar to 
each other. Criteria used to describe both types of particles in nearly all definitions are: 

• the expression of attitudes, expectations, assumptions, and appraisal of the speaker and the ad-
dressee

• the inability to appear in the front field
• they never form constituents of a sentence and thus cannot be moved at all
• apart from a few exceptions, they cannot be stressed.

Also quite problematic is the differentiation of what is termed focus particles (“Fokuspartikeln”), sca-
lar particles (“Gradpartikeln”) and intensifying particles (“Intensitätspartikeln”) such as German 
nur,sogar, sehr etc. as can be seen in table 4.

It becomes obvious that the definitions of this group of particles are quite similar to each other except 
for the focus particles not being omittable without changing the proposition of the sentence and inten-
sifying particles not being able to precede noun phrases. However, looking at spoken language, the last 
definition can be easily contradicted – e.g. considering the statement: “Das ist aber sehr fünfzehntes 
Jahrhundert” (This is very fifteenth century). Looking at the data of our corpus, quite a lot of examples 
come up where one could not easily decide whether the particles used would be only used for intensi-
fying, bringing something into focus or for their scaling function, e.g.: “weil ich bin jetzt echt müde” 
(FOLK_E_00002_SE_01_T_01_DF_01, 00:30:46.94 - 00:30:53.93) (because I’m really tired now) or 
“voll die sau” (FOLK_E_00021_SE_01_T_16_DF_01, 02:07:20.34 - 02:07:26.09) (truly/utterly a 
pig). 

A third group of phenomena which are quite inconsistently classified are connective particles 
(“Konnektivpartikeln”), maneuvering particles (“Rangierpartikeln”) and conjunctive adverbs 
(“Konjunktionaladverbien”) such as German allerdings, deshalb etc. On grammis 2.0 for example it is 
stated that the term connective particles is simply a synonym of maneuvering particles and conjunctive 
adverbs (Breindl and Donalies 2010). These terms are also used in the DUDEN (2006) and in (Engel

2004), however, they define them as something different than what is defined as connective particles 
in Zifonun (1997), Hoffmann (2013), Breindl and Donalies (2010). The problem here is based on the 
linguistic level on which they are defined. Some grammars define them according to their semantics 
and classify them as to their conjunctive function albeit not being conjunctions. Others define them 
according to their distribution in which case they rather have to be classified as adverbs rather than 
particles. 

5 The STTS 2.0 – new categories for speech particles 
5.1 Preliminary considerations 
Restructuring the tagset is a task which requires some thoughts in advance. First of all, as the tagset is 
structured in a hierarchical way, new categories must fit into that hierarchical system. Secondly, as the 
aim of the restructuring is not just a theoretical one but aims at practical use for the research communi-
ty, it needs to be comprehensible. However, the aim is not to follow a single grammar or theory but 
rather to build an unambiguous system of categories which are mutually exclusive and allow for an 
exhaustive categorization when applied to data of transcribed spoken language. The general principles 
followed were to construct the tagset as detailed as possible, to allow the research community to find 
as many phenomena typical for spoken language as possible, yet as coarse as necessary in order to 
maintain consistency and to create mutually exclusive categories. In contrast to, say, the VOICE cor-
pus, in which several possible word class categories can be assigned to a token if it is ambiguous 
(VOICE 2013), in an automatized tagging relying only on statistical values, ambiguity – especially 
with respect to pragmatic information – cannot be taken into account as the tagging will not be manu-
ally corrected. Consistent with the original guidelines of the STTS each item shall receive only one tag 
(Schiller et al. 1999). As a result, multiword expressions will not be tagged as one item either, even 
when the pragmatic information in such cases might be lost. However, the new structures built should 
be coherent concerning the linguistic levels on which the annotation is based. It has been discussed 
whether e.g. pragmatic and syntactic information should be specifically annotated on different annota-
tion levels (see e.g. Rehbein 2013). One of the main reasons to annotate only one level of POS tags in 
our corpus is that, looking at spoken data, the syntactic function of an item is often deeply intertwined 
with its pragmatic function. Nevertheless, this paper suggests a reclassification which on a theoretical 
level aims at a clear representation of the distinction between the linguistic levels which shall be as-
signed through POS tags. 

In addition, as the transcripts are based on spoken language and follow the cGAT conventions, one 
has to take into account that there are many utterances transcribed which cannot even be seen as 
'words', like sighing, laughing or breathing. Hence, the categories created for typical spoken language 
phenomena will still adhere to the concept of a “word” and only those items shall receive a POS tag.  

Being aware that the classical concept of the sentence cannot be applied to these transcripts of spo-
ken data, the concept of the verbal bracket (Verbklammer) is still fundamental for the new categoriza-
tion in order to describe the items in the utterances syntactically and also to determine whether they 
apply to a syntactical concept at all.  

5.2 Extensions to the STTS 
An overview on the structure of the categorization is given in table 5. Firstly, items like e.g. hesitation 
markers, interjections, onomatopoeia, inflectives or backchannel signals cannot be looked at on a syn-
tactic linguistic level as they are not part of the syntax of a sentence. They shall be tagged as non-
grammatical elements and thus receive the supercategory tag NG. As one category for all non-
grammatical items would hardly be satisfactory to depict these various typical spoken language phe-
nomena, one needs to consider a different linguistic level in order to further categorize them; namely 
their pragmatic function.  

To ensure that the subcategories are mutually exclusive, a closer look into the corpus data was nec-
essary to check whether one (and only one) pragmatic function could be assigned to items that are 
considered non-grammatical. Wherever this was not the case and one item could have several prag-
matic functions, the items would have to be categorized into a 'broader' class of items. Finally, items 
like onomatopoeia, inflectives and hesitation markers only have this one pragmatic function and thus 
get their own POS tag categories NGONO (Onomatopoetika), NGAKW (Aktionswörter) and NGHES 

6



(Hesitationspartikeln). However, response particles, backchannel signals and interjections do quite 
often take each other’s functions, e.g. in the following example it is not clear whether “ach” is used as 
a response particle, a backchannel signal or an interjection.  
LB °h isch ne GUte frage, ((schmatzt)) °hh des hat einfach mit der diagNOse zu tun. 

(that’s a good question ((smacking lips)) it’s just about the diagnosis) 
(0.22) 

LB gucke ma uns NAchher mal an dann. 
(we’ll have a closer look at that later) 

ML ACH so; 
(ah) 

LB ja?  
(yes) (FOLK_E_00008_SE_01_T_01_DF_01, 00:15:21.66 - 00:15:28.84) 

Hence, although on a theoretical level there might be differences between those classes, in analyzing 
spoken language these differentiations cannot be made in every case. Thus, there will only be one POS 
tag for those items in the STTS 2.0 which have the function of signaling response, backchanneling or 
interjections – the NGIRR for “Interjektionen, Rezeptionssignale und Responsive”. Obviously, what 
formerly has been tagged as answering particle PTKANT (Antwortpartikel) will subsequently be 
tagged as NGIRR. This restructuring needs to be done as the response particles "yes", "no", "maybe" 
etc. are not – like the other particles which are tagged with the supercategory PTK – syntactically inte-
grated in the sentence, i.e. located in the middle field of a sentence. 

Secondly, there is the group of speech particles which are not part of the core sentence construction, 
yet pragmatically cannot stand on their own. These 'sentence external' (SE) elements can be subclassi-
fied into two classes. Discourse markers stand in the pre-front field and need a sentence to follow, i.e. 
they open up a projection which needs to be filled by the following. Tag questions stand in the end 
field and are used to raise the hearer's attention. Hence, two new POS tags are introduced to tag those 
items: SEDM (discourse particles) and SEQU (tag questions).

Finally, there are those speech particles which are syntactically integrated in the core sentence, i.e. 
are situated in the middle field. Those which are already represented in categories in the tagset and 
which are categorized based on their syntactic features will remain. The PTKANT tag will be removed 
from this category. Additionally, those sentence-internal particles which formerly have been tagged as 

7 There are hardly any Abtönungspartikeln in the English language, thus no literal translations are possible.

adverbs, i.e. modal, focus, scalar or intensifying particles shall be categorized as particles. Although 
the naming and the concepts for those particles are highly debated in the literature, syntactically, one 
can clearly differentiate them from adverbs as adverbs can stand in the front field on their own whilst 
speech particles cannot (Breindl and Donalies 2011). Moreover, as Hirschmann (2013) pointed out, 
one can divide all these speech particle concepts into two groups: those which can be moved to the 
front field together with their mother phrase and those which cannot be moved at all. The latter ones 
are either modal particles or Abtönungspartikeln, the former ones intensifying particles, focus particles 
and scalar particles (Breindl and Donalies 2011b). As evidently not even the grammars can give clear 
guidelines for the distinction of these classes, a categorization can only be based on distributional fea-
tures. Consequently, there shall be two new POS tag categories PTKIFG (Intensitäts-, Fokus- und 
Gradpartikeln) and PTKMA (Modal- und Abtönungspartikeln). However, annotating data one comes 
across a set of sentence-internal particles which have not been accounted for so far. Hirschmann 
(2013) presented an analysis of items which are part of multi-word lexemes. They are bound to other 
lexemes not by modifying them as an intensifyer, focus, or scalar particle, but they have to be consid-
ered parts of multi-word constructions. This can be proven by the fact that the elements in question 
lose the meaning which they possess without the element they are joint with. From an orthographic 
point of view, however, those particles, together with the other item, build a phrasal constituent. For 
example, “immer” and “noch” in: “Baba ist immer noch brummelig” (Baba is still grumpy) 
(FOLK_E_00016, 13), together semantically form one lexeme which can also be seen in the transla-
tion where both together are translated as “still”. Crucially, the word “immer” is neither an adverb 
with the usual meaning “always” here, nor is it an intensifier with the meaning “increasingly” as in 
“immer besser” (increasingly well/better). In this one idiosyncratic case (“immer noch”), “immer” can 
onlybe interpreted together with “noch” which can only be moved as a multi-word lexeme in the sen-
tence. The adverb “noch” can still be interpreted as the head of the whole expression. In this respect, 
lexicalized particles are similar to the group of PTKIFG, with the difference that they neither have an 
intensifying, scaling or focusing function. It seems like they are a very interesting group of particles, 
as one can analyze the gradual grammaticalization cline in such items. Finding that it is a very restrict-
ed group of possible items they shall receive their own tag PTKLEX for “particle in a multi-word lex-
eme”. 

6 Conclusion and outlook 
This paper presented a proposal as to how new tag categories for an improved version of the STTS 
(STTS 2.0) in the field of speech particles could look like.  

To see whether these new categories work for part of speech annotation, guidelines have been writ-
ten and the work on annotating a gold standard of about 100,000 tokens has begun. In order to evalu-
ate and validate the proposed tagset and the guidelines, Cohen’s kappa will be used to assess the inter-
annotator agreement. In addition, post-processing has been implemented that already helps to improve 
the accuracy of the output, e.g. by assigning POS-tags to those items which do not have any homo-
nyms in other word classes, i.e. through a list of items which shall receive this tag. A first analysis 
shows that this proved to be extremely useful for the categories NGIRR, NGONO, NGHES, NGAKW 
and SEQU. 

However, in order to fully automatize part of speech tagging of transcripts of spoken language, a re-
training of the tagger will be necessary. Moreover – although the errors due to mis-tagged speech par-
ticles were the most prominent cause for the low precision rate – additional sources of errors will have 
to be analyzed to be able to create a coherent tagset for spoken language annotation. The analysis of 
the colloquial use of pronouns, verbs, foreign language material or in the STTS so called ‘non-words’ 
might call for a further recategorization of the Stuttgart Tübingen tagset.
