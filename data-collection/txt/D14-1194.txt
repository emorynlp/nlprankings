Abstract

We describe a convolutional neural net-
work that learns feature representations for
short textual posts using hashtags as a su-
pervised signal. The proposed approach is
trained on up to 5.5 billion words predict-
ing 100,000 possible hashtags. As well as
strong performance on the hashtag predic-
tion task itself, we show that its learned
representation of text (ignoring the hash-
tag labels) is useful for other tasks as well.
To that end, we present results on a docu-
ment recommendation task, where it also
outperforms a number of baselines.

1 Introduction

Hashtags (single tokens often composed of nat-
ural language n-grams or abbreviations, prefixed
with the character ‘#’) are ubiquitous on social
networking services, particularly in short textual
documents (a.k.a. posts). Authors use hashtags to
diverse ends, many of which can be seen as labels
for classical NLP tasks: disambiguation (chips
#futurism vs. chips #junkfood); identi-
fication of named entities (#sf49ers); sentiment
(#dislike); and topic annotation (#yoga).
Hashtag prediction is the task of mapping text to
its accompanying hashtags. In this work we pro-
pose a novel model for hashtag prediction, and
show that this task is also a useful surrogate for
learning good representations of text.

Latent representations, or embeddings, are vec-
torial representations of words or documents, tra-
ditionally learned in an unsupervised manner over
large corpora. For example LSA (Deerwester et
al., 1990) and its variants, and more recent neural-
network inspired methods like those of Bengio et
al. (2006), Collobert et al. (2011) and word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) learn word embeddings. In
the word embedding paradigm, each word is rep-

resented as a vector in Rn, where n is a hyper-
parameter that controls capacity. The embeddings
of words comprising a text are combined using a
model-dependent, possibly learned function, pro-
ducing a point in the same embedding space. A
similarity measure (for example, inner product)
gauges the pairwise relevance of points in the em-
bedding space.

Unsupervised word embedding methods train
with a reconstruction objective in which the em-
beddings are used to predict the original text. For
example, word2vec tries to predict all the words
in the document, given the embeddings of sur-
rounding words. We argue that hashtag predic-
tion provides a more direct form of supervision:
the tags are a labeling by the author of the salient
aspects of the text. Hence, predicting them may
provide stronger semantic guidance than unsuper-
vised learning alone. The abundance of hashtags
in real posts provides a huge labeled dataset for
learning potentially sophisticated models.

In this work we develop a convolutional net-
work for large scale ranking tasks, and apply it
to hashtag prediction. Our model represents both
words and the entire textual post as embeddings as
intermediate steps. We show that our method out-
performs existing unsupervised (word2vec) and
supervised (WSABIE (Weston et al., 2011)) em-
bedding methods, and other baselines, at the hash-
tag prediction task.

We then probe our model’s generality, by trans-
fering its learned representations to the task of per-
sonalized document recommendation: for each of
M users, given N previous positive interactions
with documents (likes, clicks, etc.), predict the
N + 1’th document the user will positively inter-
act with. To perform well on this task, the rep-
resentation should capture the user’s interest in
textual content. We find representations trained
on hashtag prediction outperform representations
from unsupervised learning, and that our convolu-

2 Prior Work

Some previous work (Davidov et al., 2010; Godin
et al., 2013; She and Chen, 2014) has addressed
hashtag prediction. Most such work applies to
much smaller sets of hashtags than the 100,000 we
consider, with the notable exception of Ding et al.
(2012), which uses an unsupervised method.

As mentioned in Section 1, many approaches
learn unsupervised word embeddings. In our
experiments we use word2vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) as a representative scalable model for un-
supervised embeddings. WSABIE (Weston et al.,
2011) is a supervised embedding approach that has
shown promise in NLP tasks (Weston et al., 2013;
Hermann et al., 2014). WSABIE is shallow, linear,
and ignores word order information, and so may
have less modeling power than our approach.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in
which shared weights are applied across the in-
put, are popular in the vision domain and have re-
cently been applied to semantic role labeling (Col-
lobert et al., 2011) and parsing (Collobert, 2011).
Neural networks in general have also been applied
to part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named en-
tity recognition (Collobert et al., 2011; Turian et
al., 2010), and sentiment detection (Socher et al.,
2013). All these tasks involve predicting a limited
(2-30) number of labels. In this work, we make
use of CNNs, but apply them to the task of rank-
ing a very large set of tags. We thus propose a
model and training scheme that can scale to this
class of problem.

3 Convolutional Embedding Model

Our model #TAGSPACE (see Figure 1), like other
word embedding models, starts by assigning a d-
dimensional vector to each of the l words of an
input document w1, . . . , wl, resulting in a matrix
of size l × d. This is achieved using a matrix of
N × d parameters, termed the lookup-table layer
(Collobert et al., 2011), where N is the vocabulary
size. In this work N is 106, and each row of the
matrix represents one of the million most frequent
words in the training corpus.

A convolution layer is then applied to the l × d
input matrix, which considers all successive win-
dows of text of size K, sliding over the docu-
ment from position 1 to l. This requires a fur-
ther Kd×H weights and H biases to be learned.
To account for words at the two boundaries of the
document we also apply a special padding vector
at both ends. In our experiments K was set to 5
and H was set to 1000. After the convolutional
step, a tanh nonlinearity followed by a max op-
eration over the l × H features extracts a fixed-
size (H-dimensional) global feature vector, which
is independent of document size. Finally, another
tanh non-linearity followed by a fully connected
linear layer of size H×d is applied to represent the
entire document in the original embedding space
of d-dimensions.

Hashtags are also represented using d-
dimensional embeddings using a lookup-table.
We represent the top 100,000 most frequent tags.
For a given document w we then rank any given
hashtag t using the scoring function:

f(w, t) = econv(w) · elt(t)

1823



where econv(w) is the embedding of the document
by the CNN just described and elt(t) is the em-
bedding of a candidate tag t. We can thus rank all
candidate hashtags via their scores f(w, t), largest
first.

To train the above scoring function, and hence
the parameters of the model we minimize a rank-
ing loss similar to the one used in WSABIE as
a training objective: for each training example,
we sample a positive tag, compute f(w, t+), then
sample random tags t̄ up to 1000 times until
f(w, t̄) > m + f(w, t+), where m is the mar-
gin. A gradient step is then made to optimize the
pairwise hinge loss:

L = max{0, m− f(w, t+) + f(w, t̄)}.

We use m = 0.1 in our experiments. This loss
function is referred to as the WARP loss in (We-
ston et al., 2011) and is used to approximately
optimizing the top of the ranked list, useful for
metrics like precision and recall@k. In particu-
lar, the search for a negative candidate tag means
that more energy is spent on improving the rank-
ing performance of positive labels already near the
top of the ranked list, compared to only randomly
sampling of negatives, which would optimize the
average rank instead.

Minimizing our loss is achieved with parallel
stochastic gradient descent using the hogwild al-
gorithm (Niu et al., 2011). The lookup-table lay-
ers are initialized with the embeddings learned by
WSABIE to expedite convergence. This kind of
‘pre-training’ is a standard trick in the neural net-
work literature, see e.g. (Socher et al., 2011).

The ranking loss makes our model scalable to
100,000 (or more) hashtags. At each training ex-
ample only a subset of tags have to be computed,
so it is far more efficient than a standard classifi-
cation loss that considers them all.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data

Our experiments use two large corpora of posts
containing hashtags from a popular social net-
work.1 The first corpus, which we call people,
consists of 201 million posts from individual user
accounts, comprising 5.5 billion words.

The second corpus, which we call pages, con-
sists of 35.3 million page posts, comprising 1.6

billion words. These posts’ authorial voice is a
public entity, such as a business, celebrity, brand,
or product. The posts in the pages dataset are pre-
sumably intended for a wider, more general audi-
ence than the posts in the people dataset. Both are
summarized in Table 1.

Both corpora comprise posts between February
1st and February 17th, 2014. Since we are not at-
tempting a multi-language model, we use a simple
trigram-based language prediction model to con-
sider only posts whose most likely language is En-
glish.

The two datasets use hashtags very differently.
The pages dataset has a fatter head, with popular
tags covering more examples. The people dataset
uses obscure tags more heavily. For example, the
top 100 tags account for 33.9% of page tags, but
only 13.1% of people tags.

4.2 Hashtag prediction

The hashtag prediction task attempts to rank a
post’s ground-truth hashtags higher than hash-
tags it does not contain. We trained models on
both the people and page datasets, and collected
precision at 1, recall at 10, and mean rank for
50,000 randomly selected posts withheld from
training. A further 50,000 withheld posts are
used for selecting hyperparameters. We compare
#TAGSPACE with the following models:

Frequency This simple baseline ignores input
text, always ranking hashtags by their frequency
in the training data.

#words This baseline assigns each tag a static
score based on its frequency plus a large bonus if
it corresponds to a word in the input text. For ex-
ample, on input “crazy commute this am”, #words
ranks #crazy, #commute, #this and #am
highest, in frequency order.

Word2vec We trained the unsupervised model
of Mikolov et al. (2013) on both datasets, treat-
ing hashtags the same as all other words. To ap-

ply these word embeddings to ranking, we first
sum the embeddings of each word in the text (as
word2vec does), and then rank hashtags by simi-
larity of their embedding to that of the text.2

WSABIE (Weston et al., 2011) is a supervised
bilinear embedding model. Each word and tag has
an embedding. The words in a text are averaged
to produce an embedding of the text, and hash-
tags are ranked by similarity to the text embed-
ding. That is, the model is of the form:

f(w, t) = w>U>V t

where the post w is represented as a bag of words
(a sparse vector in RN ), the tag is a one-hot-vector
in RN , and U and V are k ×N embedding matri-
ces. The WARP loss, as described in section 3, is
used for training.

Performance of all these models at hashtag pre-
diction is summarized in Tables 3 and 4. We find
similar results for both datasets. The frequency
and #words baselines perform poorly across the

2Note that the unsupervised Word2vec embeddings could
be used as input to a supervised classifier, which we did not
do. For a supervised embedding baseline we instead use WS-
ABIE. WSABIE trains word embeddings U and hashtag em-
beddings V in a supervised fashion, whereas Word2vec trains
them both unsupervised. Adding supervision to Word2vec
would effectively do something in-between: U would still be
unsupervised, but V would then be supervised.

board, establishing the need to learn from text.
Among the learning models, the unsupervised
word2vec performs the worst. We believe this
is due to it being unsupervised – adding super-
vision better optimizes the metric we evaluate.
#TAGSPACE outperforms WSABIE at all dimen-
sionalities. Due to the relatively large test sets,
the results are statistically significant; for example,
comparing #TAGSPACE (64 dim) beats Wsabie (64
dim) for the page dataset 56% of the time, and
draws 23% of the time in terms of the rank met-
ric, and is statistically significant with a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test.

Some example predictions for #TAGSPACE are
given for some constructed examples in Table 2.
We also show nearest word embeddings to the
posts. Training data was collected at the time of
the pax winter storm, explaining predictions for
the first post, and Kevin Spacey appears in the
show “House of Cards,”. In all cases the hash-
tags reveal labels that capture the semantics of the
posts, not just syntactic similarity of individual
words.

Comparison to Production System We also
compare to a proprietary system in production in
Facebook for hashtag prediction. It trains a lo-
gistic regression model for every hashtag, using
a bag of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as the

input features. Unlike the other models we con-
sider here, this baseline has been trained using a
set of approximately 10 million posts. Engineer-
ing constraints prevent measuring mean rank per-
formance. We present it here as a serious effort
at solving the same problem from outside the em-
bedding paradigm. On the people dataset this sys-
tem achieves 3.47% P@1 and 5.33% R@10. On
the pages dataset it obtains 5.97% P@1 and 6.30%
R@10. It is thus outperformed by our method.
However, we note the differences in experimen-
tal setting mean this comparison is perhaps not
completely fair (different training sets). We expect
performance of linear models such as this to be
similar to WSABIE as that has been in the case in
other datasets (Gupta et al., 2014), but at the cost
of more memory usage. Note that models like lo-
gistic regression and SVM do not scale well if you
have millions of hashtags, which we could handle
in our models.

4.3 Personalized document recommendation
To investigate the generality of these learned rep-
resentations, we apply them to the task of recom-
mending documents to users based on the user’s
interaction history. The data for this task comprise
anonymized day-long interaction histories for a
tiny subset of people on a popular social network-

ing service. For each of the 34 thousand people
considered, we collected the text of between 5 and
167 posts that she has expressed previous positive
interactions with (likes, clicks, etc.). Given the
person’s trailing n−1 posts, we use our models to
predict the n’th post by ranking it against 10,000
other unrelated posts, and measuring precison and
recall. The score of the nth post is obtained by
taking the max similarity over the n− 1 posts. We
use cosine similarity between post embeddings in-
stead of the inner product that was used for hash-
tag training so that the scores are not unduly influ-
enced by document length. All learned hashtag
models were trained on the people dataset. We
also consider a TF-IDF weighted bag-of-words
baseline (BoW). The results are given in Table 5.

Hashtag-based embeddings outperform BoW
and unsupervised embeddings across the board,
and #TAGSPACE outperforms WSABIE. The best
results come from summing the bag-of-words
scores with those of #TAGSPACE.

5 Conclusion

#TAGSPACE is a convolutional neural network
that learns to rank hashtags with a minimum of
task-specific assumptions and engineering. It per-
forms well, beating several baselines and an in-
dustrial system engineered for hashtag prediction.
The semantics of hashtags cause #TAGSPACE to
learn a representation that captures many salient
aspects of text. This representation is general
enough to port to the task of personalized docu-
ment recommendation, where it outperforms other
well-known representations.
