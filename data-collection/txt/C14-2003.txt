Abstract 

This paper presents the Copa 2014 FrameNet Brasil software (C-14/FN-Br): a frame-based trilingual 
electronic dictionary covering the domains of Football, Tourism and the World Cup. The dictionary relies 
on the infrastructure of FrameNet and is meant to be used by tourists, journalists and the staff involved in 
receiving foreign visitors. Vocabulary from the three domains is made available in English, Spanish and 
Brazilian Portuguese. Every lexical unit in the dictionary is described against an interlingual background 
frame. 

1 Introduction 
The idea of building a frame-based electronic dictionary is not new. Fillmore and Atkins (1992) paper 
on the semantics of Risk and its neighbors already propose the general guidelines for a lexical resource 
in which frames would play the key role of organizing lexical units (LUs) – the pairing of a lemma 
and a frame – and the relations among them. Five years after the Risk paper, Berkeley FrameNet was 
launched not only to materialize those general guidelines, but also to go beyond them (Fillmore et al. 
2003a; 2003b). Currently, Berkeley FrameNet has described 1,164 frames and 12,713 LUs, which, in 
turn, are attested in 195,590 annotated sentences1. Additionally, there are framenets being developed 
for several languages other than English, such as Chinese (You and Liu, 2005), German (Boas, 2002), 
Japanese (Ohara et al., 2004), Spanish (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), Swedish (Borin et al., 2010), and 
Brazilian Portuguese (Salomão, 2009), among others. 

However, although FrameNet and its sister projects have made considerable impact in 
Computational Linguistics, the frame-based approach for creating lexical resources envisioned by 
Fillmore and his collaborators has not been fully exploited in creating commercial electronic 
dictionaries, i.e. pieces of software focusing not on an expert user, but in the non-linguist. The Copa 
2014 FrameNet Brasil Project (C-14/FN-Br) aims to fill in this blank.  

Covering the domains of Football – whose frames were defined by the Semantec group at 
UNISINOS (Chishman et al., 2013) –, Tourism and the World Cup itself – both modeled by the 
FrameNet Brasil group at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora –, the dictionary is meant to be used 
by tourists, journalists and the staff involved both in the organization of the event and in receiving 
foreign visitors. Vocabulary from the three domains is made available in English, Spanish and 
Brazilian Portuguese. Every LU in the dictionary is described against a background frame, which is 
the same for the three languages. Hence, relying on the infrastructure of framenet, C-14/FN-Br serves 
as a proof of concept that frames – at least the crosscultural ones – can be used as an interlingua. 

2 The Database  
The C-14/FN-Br database is fully multilingual, in the sense that, besides comprising LUs from the

three languages, the frames and Frame Elements (FEs) – the participants and props in a frame – 
modeled are represented in the three languages as well. This procedure aims to provide the software 
with a trilingual interface, meaning that the user may choose in which language s/he wants to interact 
with the software.  

To populate the database, C-14/FN-Br uses the same software developed for Berkeley FrameNet, 
the FrameNet Desktop, with some minor changes, the most important of which being the Translation 
Relation, the Language Index, the Grammatical Function and Phrase Type Correspondence Tables, 
and the LU Link. 

2.1 Translation Relation 
The original FrameNet database works with eight different frame-to-frame relations: Inheritance, 
Using, Subframe, Perspective on, Precedes, Causative of, Incohative of and See also (Fillmore et al. 
2003b; Ruppenhofer et al. 2010). Those relations structure the network of frames, defining which 
frame is a type – Inheritance – or a part – Subframe – of another, or even if it comes before another 
frame – Precedes.  

For the development of C-14/FN-Br, an additional relation was created: Translation. Since it is a 
symmetric relation between representations of the same conceptual structure, the Translation relation 
requires all FE in one representation to be mapped to FEs in the other.  

With this relation, the software is able to link the set of LUs evoking a frame in a given language to 
the set of LUs evoking the same frame in another language. Also, the Translation relation provides the 
dictionary user with the possibility of accessing the frame description in all the three interface 
languages, which may or may not be the same as the language of the word being looked up.   

2.2 Language Index 
A framenet-like database is composed of both a set of frames, FEs and the relations among them, and 
a set of annotations. In the annotation sets, sentences are labeled not only in regards to the FEs occur-
ring in them, but also in regards to the Grammatical Functions (GFs) and Phrase Types (PTs), i.e. the 
linguistic material, in which they are instantiated.  

Each language requires its own set of GFs and PTs, which were defined by the correspondent 
framenet projects (see Ruppenhofer et al., 2010; Spanish FrameNet, 2013; Torrent and Ellsworth, 
2013). In C-14/FN-Br, GF and PT labels for English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese are included in 
the database and made available for the lexicographer when annotating a sentence. A Language Index 
(en, for English; es, for Spanish, and br, for Brazilian Portuguese) was created and ascribed to the 
layers containing those labels and also to the frames. During the process of importing aanotation 
corpora into the Desktop, the Language Index in the annotation set is unified with that of the layers, 
thus providing the relevant GF and PT labels for each sentence. 

2.3 Grammatical Function and Phrase Type Correspondence Tables 
Another change made to the database was the creation of a relational table in which GF and PT labels 
in the three languages are associated to each other. The purpose of this table is to provide the software 
with a base for comparing valence patterns of the lexical units in the dictionary. Through such a 
comparison, C-14/FN-Br is able to suggest the best translation equivalents for a given word in the 
other two languages covered by the dictionary (see Torrent et al., forthcoming).  

2.4 LU Link 
The last change incorporated to the C-14/FN-Br database is the LU Link. Through this relation, LUs 
evoking the same frame in different languages can be linked to each other as translation equivalents. 
The process of assigning those equivalences is based on the analysis of the lexicographer. The LU 
Link tool is specially important for defining equivalence relations between nouns evoking entities, 
such as city and stadiums names, since their valence patterns are not informative enough for the 
automatic suggestion of translation equivalents.

3 The Application 
C-14/FN-Br was developed as a web app and can be accessed at http://dicionariodacopa.com.br. On 
the client side, the web interface is built using HTML5 and Javascript. Data is stored in a MySQL 
database and is delivered to clients through a PHP5 web service. Data transfer uses AJAX techniques. 

Every piece of information in the multilingual framenet-like database of C-14/FN-Br is, to some 
extent, used for presenting information to the final user. Thus, besides being able to search for LUs 
and their equivalents in the other languages, users can also see the frame and the FEs evoked by the 
lexical item, as well as selected annotated sentences, images and videos, which illustrate the meaning 
evoked by the word. 

Since the dictionary is aimed at a non-specialist audience, adaptations in the Frame Semantics 
terminology were made. Frames are called scenes (or esceneas and cenas, in Spanish and Portuguese) 
and Frame Elements are called participants (or participantes). Frame-to-frame relations also had their 
names changed into more transparent concepts. For instance, instead of presenting the names 
Inheritance and Subframe, the software shows these relations as nominal predicates, respectivelly, “is 
a type of” and “is a part of”.  

3.1 Query Modes 
Users may access the information in the dictionary in four different ways: by searching a word, by 
typing a sentence, by browsing the list of frames grouped by cognitive domains, and by exploring the 
frame grapher. 

The first mode is similar to the one found in the majority of electronic dictionaries (Pastor and 
Alcina, 2010): users are presented a list of words in alphabetical order and a search box. Icons with the 
Brazilian, British and Spanish flags provide the possibility of choosing the language to which the 
words being looked up belong. 

   When a given lemma is paired with more than one frame in the dictionary, that is, it is polyse-
mous, C-14/FN-Br shows a disambiguation screen to the user, in which s/he can choose in which sce-
ne s/he wants to explore the meaning of the word. Alternatively, if the user types in a sentence con-
taining the LU s/he wants to look up, the dictionary may infer the most appropriate scene, using the 
frame disambiguation tool. 

3.2 Frame Disambiguation 
The frame disambiguation tool chooses, among the frames evoked by the various LUs of a lexeme, the 
best fit for a given context. First, a text-matching script identifies lemmas in the sentence the user 
types in. Second, all frames evoked by the LUs grouped under those lemmas are retrieved and each 
possible combination of frames forms a cluster. Since it is very unlikely that two or more LUs evoke 
the same frame in one sentence, and since frames in FrameNet are related to each other via frame-to-
frame relations, cluster formation is extended so as to include related frames. The similarity/proximity 
between frames is assessed within each cluster, based on the weights ascribed to each frame-to-frame 
relation. The cluster in which relations between frames are stronger receive higher grades, enabling C-
14/FN-br to present to the user the most probable meaning of a polysemous word given the sentential 
context provided in the query. Currently, the frame disambiguation tool works only for verbal lexical 
units. 

3.3 Frame Grapher 
The two other query modes focus on frames, not on LUs. Users can either browse a list of the frames 
defined for each domain, accessing their definitions and FEs, or explore the frame grapher, a dynamic 
graph in which frames are linked to each other via frame-to-frame relations. The purpose of the 
grapher is to show to the user, in an interactive tool, how the domains of the World Cup, Football and 
Tourism are organized. Through this tool it is possible not only to access the vocabulary evoking a 
specific stage of the World Cup, such as the Playoffs, for example, but also to see that it is a part of the 
World Cup that precedes the Final Match and comes after the Group Stage. 

12



3.4 Multimedia Features and External Links 
As an additional resource for understanding the frame evoked by each lexical unit, the dictionary 
provides the users with pictures and annotated pieces of video illustrating some of the frames. 
Currently, video annotation is made using a free web tool from Mozilla Corporation: PopcornMaker 
(https://popcorn.webmaker.org). 

Also, users may follow a link to the websites from which the example sentences for each LU were 
collected, thus being able to read travel blogs, news and other pieces of text related to the domains 
coverd by the dictionary. 

4 Preliminary Analytics 
The C-14/FN-Br web app was launched on June 4th 2014, one week prior to the World Cup. During 
the first month, from 6/4/2014 to 7/4/2014, the app was accessed 1,883 times by 1,367 different users, 
with a total of 12,322 pages visited, i.e. an average of 6.54 pages per session. Bounce rate during the 
first month was of 22.68%, and the average session duration was 3 minutes and 52 seconds. 

The web app was accessed from 59 different coutries. Table 1 lists the top ten countries in number 
of sessions. For each country, the percentage of new sessions, the bounce rate, the average number of 
pages visited and the average session duration is also presented.

Table 1. Sessions per country. 

 
Although 71.80% of the sessions originated from Brazil, only 65.00% (1,224) of them were opened 

from devices in which the default language was Brazilian Portuguese. Devices in which English is the 
default language represent 18.00% of the total (339 sessions), while those whose default language is 
Spanish stand for 10.20% (192 sessions). Those data might point to the fact that the app has been used 
by foreigners visitng Brazil during the World Cup, however, the information on the default language 
retrieved from the analytics software is not competely reliable, since it is set by the user while 
configuring the device for the first time.  

Nevertheless, stronger data supporting the claim that the app has been used by foreigners while 
visiting Brazil come from the analysis of the number of clicks received by each link in the first page of 
the app, in which users choose the interface language in their first visit – this page is not shown after 
the second time the same device accesses C-14/FN-Br. In the 1,367 sessions opened in this page, 
Brazilian Portuguese was chosen as the interface language 794 times, English was chosen 202 times 
and Spanish 160 times. 211 sessions were closed before any clicks were recorded.  

Regarding the query modes offered in the main menu, Table 2 presents the users’ behavior in 
regards to the interface language chosen. Totals presented in the last row of the table include visits by 
both first-time and returning users and do not include sessions in which no query mode was selected 
and users simply accessed information about the project or quit the app. Data in Table 2 show that the 
word search was the most used query mode in all three languages, representing at least half of the 

13



users’choices. Neverthless, the other query modes oferred by C-14/FN-Br were tested by a substantial 
number of users.

5 Conclusion 
This paper presented C-14/FN-Br, a frame-based trilingual electronic dictionary covering the domains 
of football, tourism and the Word Cup. Our aim with this research was both to extend the use of 
FrameNet to the construction of lexical resources for non-linguists and to explore the use of frames as 
interlingual representations.
