Abstract

Argumentation mining (AM) requires the identification of complex discourse structures and has
lately been applied with success monolingually. In this work, we show that the existing re-
sources are, however, not adequate for assessing cross-lingual AM, due to their heterogeneity
or lack of complexity. We therefore create suitable parallel corpora by (human and machine)
translating a popular AM dataset consisting of persuasive student essays into German, French,
Spanish, and Chinese. We then compare (i) annotation projection and (ii) bilingual word em-
beddings based direct transfer strategies for cross-lingual AM, finding that the former performs
considerably better and almost eliminates the loss from cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, we
find that annotation projection works equally well when using either costly human or cheap
machine translations. Our code and data are available at http://github.com/UKPLab/

1 Introduction

Argumentation mining (AM) is a fast-growing research field with applications in discourse analysis,
summarization, debate modeling, and law, among others (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a). Recent studies
have successfully applied computational methods to analyze monological argumentation (Wachsmuth et
al., 2017; Eger et al., 2017). Most of these studies view arguments as consisting of (at least) claims
and premises—and so do we in this work. Thereby, our focus is on token-level argument component
extraction, that is, the segmentation and typing of argument components.

AM has thus far almost exclusively been performed monolingually, e.g. in English (Mochales-Palau
and Moens, 2009), German (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2015), or Chinese (Li et al., 2017). Working only mono-
lingually is problematic, however, because AM is a difficult task even for humans due to its dependence
on background knowledge and parsing of complex pragmatic relations (Moens, 2017). As a result, ac-
quiring (high-quality) datasets for new languages comes at a high cost—be it in terms of training and/or
hiring expert annotators or querying large crowds in crowd-sourcing experiments. It is thus of utmost
importance to train NLP systems in AM that are capable of going cross-language, so that annotation
efforts do not have to be multiplied by the number of languages of interest. This is in line with current
trends in NLP, which increasingly recognize the possibility and the necessity to work cross-lingually,
be it in part-of-speech tagging (Zhang et al., 2016), dependency parsing (Agic et al., 2016), sentiment
mining (Chen et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016), or other fields.

In this work, we address the problem of cross-lingual (token-level) AM for the first time. We initially
experiment with available resources in English, German, and Chinese. We show that the existing datasets
for analyzing argumentation are not suitable for assessing cross-lingual component extraction due to their
heterogeneity or lack of complexity. Given this scarcity of homogeneously annotated high-quality large-
scale datasets across different languages, our first contribution is to (1) provide a fully parallel (en-de),
human-translated version of one of the most popular current AM datasets, namely, the English dataset
of persuasive student essays published by Stab and Gurevych (2017).

We then (2) machine translate the 402 student essays into German, Spanish, French, and Chinese.
Both our human and machine translations contain argumentation annotations, in the form of either human
annotations or automatically projected annotations. Our experiments indicate that both the translations
and the projected annotations are of very high quality, cf. examples in Table 2.

Besides contributing new datasets, (3) we perform the first evaluations of cross-lingual (token-level)
AM, based on suitable adaptations of two popular cross-lingual techniques, namely, direct transfer (Mc-
Donald et al., 2011) and projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001). We find that projection works considerably
better than direct transfer and almost closes the cross-lingual gap, i.e., cross-lingual performance is al-
most on par with in-language performance when we use parallel data and project annotations to the target
language. This holds both for human (translated, HT) parallel data, which is costly to obtain, and machine
translated (MT) parallel data, which is very cheap to obtain for dozens of high-resource languages.

Our findings imply that current neural MT has reached a level where it can act as a substitute for costly
(non-expert) HT even for problems that operate on the fine-grained token-level.

2 Related Work

In what follows, we briefly summarize the works that most closely relate to our current research.

Argumentation Mining AM seeks to automatically identify argument structures in text and has re-
ceived a lot of attention in NLP lately. Existing approaches focus, for instance, on specific subtasks
like argument unit segmentation (Ajjour et al., 2017), identifying different types of argument compo-
nents (Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009; Habernal and Gurevych, 2017), recognizing argumentative
discourse relations (Nguyen and Litman, 2016) or extracting argument components and relations end-
to-end (Eger et al., 2017). However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for English and
there are only few resources for other languages. For German, a few datasets annotated according to
the claim-premise scheme are available (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2015; Liebeck et al., 2016). Furthermore,
Peldszus and Stede (2015) annotated a small German dataset with claims and premises and translated it
to English subsequently. There are very few works studying AM in other languages, e.g. Basile et al.
(2016) for Italian, Li et al. (2017) for Chinese and Sardianos et al. (2015) for Greek. There are also two
recent papers addressing some form of cross-linguality: Aker and Zhang (2017) map argumentative sen-
tences from English to Mandarin using machine translation in comparable Wikipedia articles. Sliwa et
al. (2018) create corpora in Balkan languages and Arabic by labeling the English side of corresponding
parallel corpora on the sentence level and then using the same label for the target sentences. In contrast
to these works, we work on the more challenging token-level. Moreover, we actually train classifiers for
language transfer rather than only creating annotated data in other languages based on parallel data.

As mentioned, we focus on cross-lingual component extraction, that is, the segmentation and typing
of argument components in a target language (L2), while having only annotated source language (L1)
data. We operate on token-level by labeling each token with a BIO label plus its respective component
type. The BIO label marks the start, continuation and end of specific argument components. Examples
are given in Tables 2 and 3.

Cross-lingual sequence tagging POS tagging and named-entity recognition (NER) are standard tasks
in NLP. In recent years, there is increased interest not only in evaluating POS and NER models within
multiple individual languages (Plank et al., 2016), but also cross-lingually (Zhang et al., 2016; Tsai et
al., 2016; Mayhew et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Two standard approaches are projection (Yarowsky
et al., 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011; Täckström et al., 2013) and direct transfer (Täckström et al., 2012;
Zhang et al., 2016). Projection uses parallel data to project annotations from one language to another. In
contrast, in direct transfer, a system is trained in L1 using language independent or shared features and
applied without modification to L2.

While these approaches are typically unsupervised, i.e., they assume no annotations in L2, there are
also supervised cross-lingual approaches based on multi-task learning (Cotterell and Heigold, 2017;
Yang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017). These assume small training sets in L2, and a system trained on
them is regularized by a larger amount of training data in L1. In our work, we only consider unsupervised

language adaptation, because it is the most realistic cross-lingual scenario for AM, as it may be costly to
even produce small amounts of training data in many different languages.

Most cross-lingual sequence tagging approaches address POS tagging, and only few are devoted to
NER (Mayhew et al., 2017; Tsai et al., 2016), aspect-based sentiment classification (Lambert, 2015),
or even more challenging problems such as discourse parsing (Braud et al., 2017). While POS tagging
and NER are in some sense very similar to AM, namely, insofar as both can be modeled as sequential
tagging of tokens, there are also important differences. For example, in POS tagging and NER, the label
for a current token usually strongly depends on the token itself plus some local context. This strong
association between label, token and local context is largely absent in AM, causing some models that
perform well on POS and NER to fail blatantly in AM.1

Cross-lingual Word Embeddings are the (modern) basis of the direct transfer method. As with mono-
lingual embeddings, there exists a veritable zoo of different approaches, but they often perform very
similarly in applications (Upadhyay et al., 2016) and seemingly very different approaches are oftentimes
also equivalent on a theoretical level (Ruder et al., 2017).

3 Data

We chose three freely available datasets: a small parallel German-English dataset, and considerably
larger English and Chinese datasets using (almost) the same inventory of argument types, which we
therefore assumed to be adequate for cross-lingual experiments. We translated the two last named mono-
lingual datasets in other languages, described below. Statistics for all datasets are given in Table 1.

1E.g., we had tried out a word embedding based HMM model (Zhang et al., 2016) in initial experiments but found it to
perform below our random baseline. The apparent reason is that an HMM cannot deal with long-range dependencies that
abound in AM.

Major claims in bold, claims underlined, premises in italics (ZH: regular font).

3.1 Microtexts (MTX)

Peldszus and Stede (2015) annotated 112 German short texts (six or less sentences) written in response
to questions typically phrased like “Should one do X”. These were annotated according to a version
of Freeman’s theory of argumentation macro-structure (Peldszus and Stede, 2013b). Each microtext
consists of one (central) claim and several premises. As opposed to our other datasets, MTX has no
“O” (non-argumentative) tokens and no major claims. The German sentences have been professionally
translated to English, making this the first parallel corpus for AM in English and German.

3.2 Chinese Review Corpus (CRC)

Li et al. (2017) created the only large-scale argument mining dataset in Chinese, freely available and with
annotations on component level according to the claim-premise scheme (Stab and Gurevych, 2017). We
thus chose to include this dataset in our experiments, despite differences in the domain of the annotated
texts. Li et al. (2017) used crowdsourcing to annotate Chinese hotel reviews from tripadvisor.com with
four component types (major claim, claim, premise, premise supporting an implicit claim). We consider
only those components with direct overlap with the components used by Stab and Gurevych (2017), thus
considering components labeled as “premise supporting an implicit claim” as non-argumentative. We
applied the CRF-based Chinese word segmenter by Tseng et al. (2005) to split Chinese character streams
into tokens. Furthermore, we only use the “Easy Reviews Corpus” from Li et al. (2017). The remaining
part of the corpus are isolated sentences from reviews with low overall inter-annotator agreement, which
we ignored. An example from CRC can be found in Table 3.

3.3 A Large-Scale Parallel Dataset of Persuasive Essays (PE)

Stab and Gurevych (2017) created a dataset of persuasive essays written by students on essaysforum.com.
These are about controversial topics such as “competition or cooperation—which is better?”. To obtain
a human-translated parallel version of this dataset, we asked seven native speakers of German with an
attested strong competence in English (all students or university employees) to translate the 402 student
essays in the PE corpus sentence-by-sentence. As only requirement, we asked the translators to retain
the argumentative structure in their translations: i.e., the translation of an argument component should
be connected and not contain non-argumentative tokens. Since German has a freer word order compared
to English, this requirement can in virtually all cases be easily fulfilled without producing awkward
sounding German translations. Each essay was translated by exactly one translator. Besides translating
the essays, we also asked the translators to annotate argument boundaries so that the original mark-up
is preserved in the translations. The translators took about 40min on average to translate one essay and
indicate the argument structures. Thus, they required about 270 hours to translate the whole PE corpus
into German, and the resulting overall cost was roughly 3,000 USD. The motivations to ask translators to
translate argument components contiguously were that (i) all monolingual AM datasets we know of have
contiguous components, (ii) transfer would have been naturally hampered had components in the source
language been contiguous but not in the target language, at least for methods such as direct transfer.2

2We note that even professional translations typically differ from original, non-translated texts because they retain traces of
the source language (Rabinovich et al., 2017). We thus speculate that our reported results are probably slightly upward biased
compared to a situation where the test data consists of original German student essays. This latter situation would have been
much more costly to produce, in any way: it would have required retrieval (and, if necessary, creation) of original student essays
in German as well as induction of all subsequent annotation mark-up.



835

To obtain further parallel versions of the PE data, we also automatically translated them into German,
French, Spanish, and Chinese using Google Translate. Of course, we cannot make any demands on
how Google Translate translates text into other languages but noticed that it has a tendency to stay
rather close to the original text, but nevertheless has a very high perceived quality of translation. We
automatically projected argument structures from the English text to the machine translations using our
projection algorithm described in §4. It took few hours to automatically translate the PE corpus into the
four languages. Examples of the data as well as the human and machine translations can be found in
Table 2. Even though we also provide translations of PE in French, Spanish and Chinese, our primary
focus in our experiments below is on the languages for which we have gold (human-created) data, i.e.,
EN↔DE (for PE and MTX) as well as EN↔ZH.

4 Approaches

In what follows, we describe our adaptations of direct transfer and projection to the AM task. Direct
transfer focuses on the source language and trains on human-created L1 data as well as human-created
L1 labels. In contrast, during training, projection operates directly on the language of interest, viz., L2.
This comes at a cost: the labels in L2 are noisy, because they are projected from L1, which is an error-
prone process. The success of projection can therefore be expected to largely depend on the quality of
this transfer step. Projection makes stronger assumptions than direct transfer: it requires parallel data.3

When the parallel data is induced via machine translation, then a second source of noise for projection is
the ‘unreliable’ L2 input training data.

Direct Transfer Here, we directly train a system on bilingual representations, which in our case come
in the form of bilingual word embeddings. To retain some freedom over the choice and parameters of
our word embeddings, we choose to train them ourselves instead of using pre-trained ones. For EN↔DE
we induce bilingual word embeddings by training BIVCD (Vulic and Moens, 2015) and BISKIP models
(Luong et al., 2015) on >2 million aligned sentences from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). BIVCD
concatenates bilingually aligned sentences (or documents), randomly shuffles each concatenation and
trains a standard monolingual word embedding technique on the result; here, we use the word2vec skip-
gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013). BIVCD was shown to be competitive to more challenging approaches
in Upadhyay et al. (2016). BISKIP is a variant of the standard skip-gram model which predicts mono-
and cross-lingual contexts. It requires word alignments between parallel sentences and we use fast-align
for this (Dyer et al., 2013). For EN↔ZH we train the same models on the UN corpus (Ziemski et al.,
2016), which comprises >11 million parallel sentences. We train embeddings of sizes 100 and 200.

Projection To implement projection for the problem of token-level AM, we proceed as follows. We
take our human-labeled L1 data and align it with its corresponding parallel L2 data using fast-align. Once
we have word level alignment information, we consider for each argument component c(s) in L1 of type
a (e.g., MajorClaim, Claim, Premise) with consecutive words s1, . . . , sN : the word t1 with smallest
index in the corresponding L2 sentence that is aligned to some word in s1, . . . , sN , and the analogous
word t−1 with largest such index. We then label all the words in the L2 sentence between t1 and t−1 with
type a, using a correct BIO structure, resulting in c(t). We repeat this process for all the components
within a sentence in L1 and for all sentences. In case of collision, e.g., if two components in L2 would
overlap according to the above-described strategies, we simply increment the beginning counter of one
of the components until they are disjoint. If our above strategy fails, i.e., c(s) cannot be projected,
e.g., because the words in an L1 component are not aligned to any words in L2, then we simply ignore
the projection of c(s) to the L2 sentence, labeling the corresponding words in L2 as non-argumentative
instead. We think of this projection strategy as naive because we do not do much to resolve conflicts and
instead trust the quality of the alignments and that the subsequent systems trained on the projected data
are capable of gracefully recovering from noise in the projections.

3Thus, direct transfer is potentially the cheaper approach, even though it also requires bilingual word embeddings, which
themselves are based on some form of bilingual signal, e.g., parallel sentence- or word-level data.

5 Experiments

We perform token-level sequence tagging. Our label space is Y = {B,I} × T ∪ {O} where T is the set
of argument types, comprising “claim”, “premise”, and (if applicable) “major claim”.

5.1 Experimental Setup
To perform token-level sequence tagging, we implement a standard bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer
as output layer in TensorFlow. The CRF layer accounts for dependencies between successive labels.
We represent words by their respective embeddings. In addition to this word-based information, we
also allow the model to learn a character-based representation (via another LSTM) and concatenate this
learned representation to the word embedding. Our model is essentially the same as the ones proposed
by Ma and Hovy (2016) and Lample et al. (2016); it is also a state-of-the-art model for monolingual
AM (Eger et al., 2017). We name it BLCRF+char, when character information is included, and BLCRF
when disabled. For all experiments, we use the same architectural setup: we use two LSTM hidden
layers with 100 hidden units each. We train for 50 epochs using a patience of 10. We apply dropout on
the embeddings as well as on the LSTM units. On character-level, we also use a bidirectional LSTM
with 50 hidden units and learn a representation of size 30. As evaluation measure we choose macro-F1
as implemented in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Baseline A simple baseline to test successful learning is to choose the majority label in the test data.
However, this performs particularly poorly on token-level and for our chosen evaluation metric. We
therefore choose a more sophisticated baseline. We first split our datasets by sentences and then compute
a probability distribution of how likely each argument component appears in a sentence. At test time, we
again split the test data by sentences and then label each token in the test sentence with a randomly drawn
argument component (according to the calculated probability distribution on train/dev sets). We label all
the tokens in the sentence with the drawn argument component type, keeping valid BIO structure. We
label the last token (which is typically a punctuation symbol) with the “O” label in PE and CRC. In
essence, our baseline is a random baseline, but has some basic prior knowledge of the BIO format.

Train/dev/test splits For the PE corpus, we use the same split into training and test data as in Stab and
Gurevych (2017). In particular, our test data comprises 80 documents (“essays”) with a total of 29,537
tokens (en). We choose 10% of the training data as dev set. Thus, we have 286 essays in the train set with
a total of 105,988 tokens (en) and 36 essays in the dev set with a total of 12,657 tokens (en). We report
averages over five random initializations of our networks. For the CRC corpus, we perform 5-fold cross-
validation on document level. Our train sets consist of roughly 15K tokens, our dev sets of 2K tokens,
and our test sets of 4K tokens. For each split, we average over five different random initializations and
report the average over these averages. For MTX, we also perform 5-fold cross-validation on document
level. Our train sets consist of roughly 6K tokens (en), our dev sets of 500 tokens (en), and our test
sets of 1,500 tokens (en). We use the same averaging strategy as for CRC, but average over ten random
initializations per fold, to account for the smaller dataset sizes.

5.2 Results
We report results for adapting between datasets in different languages and between parallel versions
of one and the same dataset. We only consider cases where one of the involved languages is English.
Further, we do not transfer between MTX and the other datasets, because MTX has no “O” units (and no
major claims). Unless stated otherwise, we always evaluate on HT for both direct transfer and projection.

5.2.1 Direct Transfer
For all cross-lingual direct transfer experiments, we train on the union of train and dev (train+dev) sets
(randomly drawn for the datasets for which we used cross-validation) of the source language and test
either on the whole data (train+dev+test) of L2, or, in case of parallel versions of a dataset (such as PE
EN↔DE) on the test set of L2. We do not use MT for direct transfer at any stage.

information is available.4 German in-language results are 4-5 percentage points (pp) below the English
ones. One might suspect the presumed inferior quality (or derivative nature) of the student translations
as a cause for this, but we hypothesize that German is simply more complex than English, both in
morphology and syntax.

We observe a noticeable drop when moving cross-language. This drop is up to >40% for the direction
EN→DE (worst case drop from ∼70% to ∼37%) and slightly less for DE→EN. We explain this drop
by the discrepancy between training and test distributions. This discrepancy is present even in bilingual
embedding spaces: no test word has the exact same representation as the words in the training data. Fur-
ther, disabling character information typically has a very positive impact cross-language. For example,
EN→DE performance increases from ∼40% F1 to ∼50% when disabling character information. The
reason is that a system that extracts a character representation based on English characters may get con-
fused from the diverging German character sequences. Surprisingly, characters do not impede so much
in the direction DE→EN. The reason seems to be lexical borrowing in modern German from English.
For example,∼17% of the ‘active’ vocabulary (i.e., frequency >30) of English in PEEN is also contained
in PEDE. In contrast, only 6% of the active vocabulary of German in PEDE occurs also in PEEN.

CRC↔PEEN, results in Table 5 (left): In-language CRC results are lower than in-language PE results
(∼46% vs. ∼69% for PE). This is unsurprising since CRC is considerably smaller in size than PE.
However, we observe that the cross-language drop is much larger than it is for the PE DE↔EN setting.
In fact, performance values always lie below our random baseline. We attribute this huge drop not to the
larger language distance between English and Chinese (relative to English and German), but primarily to
the domain gap between student essays and hotel reviews. In fact, we observe that, e.g., major claims in
PE are almost always preceded by specific discourse markers such as “Therefore, I believe that” or “In
the end, I think” (cf. Table 2), while hotel reviews completely lack such discourse connectives (cf. Table
3). Since we expect a system that trains on PE to learn the signaling value of these markers, directly
applying this system to text where such markers are absent, fails.

MTXEN↔MTXDE, results in Table 5 (right): Even though the dataset is by far smallest in size it yields
the highest F1-scores among all our considered datasets. Moreover, the language drop is comparatively
small (between 4 and 7pp). Investigating, we notice that argument components are typically separated by
punctuation symbols (mostly “.” or “,”) in MTX, which is easy to learn even cross-lingually. Moreover,
we find that claims can often be separated from premises by simple keywords such as “should”, which
can, apparently, be reliably spotted cross-lingually via the corresponding bilingual word embeddings.

Error Analysis and Discussion For PE direct transfer experiments, we find that a major source of
errors is incorrect classification of tokens labeled “B-”. This means that the system has difficulty finding
the exact beginning of an argument span. We find, however, that the reason for the language drop is not
that the bilingual embedding spaces are bad: among the top-10 neighbors of English words are roughly
five German words, and vice versa. Rather, direct transfer induces a situation very similar to standard
monolingual out-of-vocabulary (OOV) scenarios, namely as if all test words had been replaced by syn-
onyms that did not occur in the train data. While systems using embeddings as input are more robust to

4Our in-language results are slightly below our previous results reported in Eger et al. (2017) (table 6), where we obtained
scores of 72-75% for token-level component extraction, even though the architecture is in principle the same. Reasons may be
the different word embeddings used as well as that we reported majority performance over different hyperparameter combina-
tions in the previous work, which typically increased performance scores by a few percentage points.

OOV words, they are still affected by them (Ma and Hovy, 2016; Müller et al., 2013). This “blurring
effect” at test time then makes it more difficult to detect exact argument component spans. While this
is true in general, it is not true for punctuation symbols, which typically have an identical role across
languages and, hence, extremely similar representations. For example, German and English “.” have
more than 97% cosine similarity in BISKIP-100d, which is much higher than for typical monolingually
closely related words. Finally, besides semantic shift direct transfer also faces syntactic shift, because the
test words may have different word order compared to the train data (e.g., verb final position in German).

The lessons we learn from our above experiments are that (i) the MTX dataset does not provide a
real challenge for cross-lingual techniques because argument components can easily be spotted based on
punctuation and component typing appears to be just as easily portable across languages. (ii) Language
adaptation between the CRC corpus and PE appears, in contrast, too difficult because argumentation
units are very differently realized across the two datasets, and hence, the domain shift appears to be the
(much) larger obstacle compared to the language shift.5 Thus, (iii) we mostly focus on the cross-lingual
version of the PE corpus in the sequel, which is a difficult enough dataset for cross-lingual AM, without
confounding the problem with issues relating to differences of AM domains. In addition, we only use
BISKIP-100d embeddings, because the choice of embeddings seemed to have a negligible effect in our
case (certainly, for our main focus, namely, cross-lingual evaluations) and because they showed slightly
superior results cross-lingually than BIVCD-100d.

5.2.2 Projection
HT-Projection Table 6 (HT columns) shows results when we project PEEN training data annotations
on parallel German HT documents and train and evaluate a system directly on German (and vice versa).
As said before, we train in this case directly on the same language as we test on, viz., L2. We observe
that this improves cross-language results dramatically. From a best cross-language result of 49.76% for
BIVEC-100d in the direct transfer setting, we improve by almost 30% to 63.67%. This is only roughly
1pp below the best in-language result for German which was 64.92%. In the direction DE→EN, we
observe the same trend: we improve by over 30% relative to the direct transfer results and achieve a
macro-F1 score that is only 1.7pp below the in-language upper-bound.

MT-Projection Next, we investigate what happens when we replace the HT translations with MT trans-
lations and perform the same projection steps as before. Results for PEEN↔PEDE are shown in Table 6
(MT columns). We see that EN→DE results get slightly better while DE→EN results get slightly worse.
On average, it seems, using machine translations is just as good as using human translations. Moreover,
we remain very close to the upper-bound in-language results. The reason why MT results could be better
than HT results is that the machine might translate more consistently. It might also be better in certain
cases in correcting (the sometimes ungrammatical) English original. Another likely reason is that current
MT has reached, if not already surpassed, HT of non-expert (but bilingually fluent) human translators.6

Motivated by this finding, we also machine translated the CRC corpus into English, projected anno-
tations and then trained a system on this translation and evaluated on the PEEN corpus. Results improve
to 23.15% macro-F1 score relative to the best direct transfer result of 16.52%. This indicates, again, that

5This is a similar finding as in Daxenberger et al. (2017).
6We conducted a formal test if MT can reliably be distinguished from HT in our setup. We trained a system (an adaptation

of InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017)) to predict whether for an English original e and a second input sentence it could determine
if the second input is a human or machine translation of e. The system’s performance of 54% accuracy (which is only slightly
better than random guessing) matched our own intuition and introspection into the quality of the machine translations.

training in L2 is better than training in L1, given the high quality machine translations and a suitable pro-
jection algorithm. However, 23.15% is still only slightly better than the random baseline of 17%—and
far from the best PEEN in-language result of >69%. In addition, in the direction PEEN→CRC macro-F1
(also) improves to 15.33% relative to a best direct transfer score of 12.60%. However, here the perfor-
mance is still below the random baseline of 17%. We take this as strong evidence that the domain gap
between CRC and PE is too large and it is not possible to train a system in one of these two domains and
directly apply it in the other, even when the language gap has been eliminated.

Other languages We conducted a final experiment in which we considered our MT translations of PE
into French, Spanish, and Chinese. Since we have no human-created test data for these languages we
could only evaluate on machine translations and projected annotations. For our BLCRF+char model,
we obtained performance scores of 62.45%, 65.92%, 59.20% for French, Spanish and Chinese, respec-
tively. To see if these numbers give reliable estimates of the systems when evaluated on HT data, we
performed the same test with German and English and got scores of 63.20% and 61.45%, respectively,
when trained and evaluated on MT. For CRC, we also trained and evaluated on the English (MT translated
and automatically projected) data, obtaining a score of 47.92% with BLCRF+char, which is slightly
above the in-language value of 46.31% on the original Chinese data (see Table 5). That all these num-
bers are close to the original in-language results gives a good indication that the MT evaluations very
likely strongly correlate to ‘true’ performances on HT data.

Error analysis The bottleneck of projection is the quality of the cross-lingual projections (which in
turn depend on the quality of the word alignments between bi-text). We can directly assess our projec-
tions by comparing them to the human-created annotations. Our algorithmic projections match in 97.24%
of the cases (token-level) with the human gold standard for the direction EN→DE. The corresponding
macro-F1 score is 89.85%. Inspecting the confusion matrices, we observe that most mismatches occur
between the “B” and “I” categories of a given component type and with the “O” category. These num-
bers and the mismatch types indicate that there are only few projection errors and they typically lead
to either (slightly) larger or smaller argument components than given in the human-created data. To il-
lustrate, typical projection errors arise in case of missing articles in one of the two languages involved;
cf. Table 2: “luck is [...]” vs. “la chance est [...]”. Here, it is likely that the alignment algorithm does
not align the French determiner “la” to an English word, and thus, “la” is not included in the argument
component. Another case of too short argument components is that of verb final position in German
which often gets misaligned and the corresponding final verb omitted from the argument component.
These misalignments lead to slightly “shifted” argument components in the L2 train set and are the most
prominent source of error for the projection technique. To quantify: the German in-language system
classifies 58% of all cases when one of the determiners (“der/die/das”) begins an argument component
correctly, but the system using projections from the English data only classifies 35% of them correctly.
Hence, alignment/projection errors indeed propagate to some degree, but these phenomena are rare and
have negligible impact on performance. Note that, by design of our projection algorithm, misalignments
of words in the ‘center’ of an argument component are much less likely to be a problem.

Figure 1 plots individual F1 scores for various systems transferring to English on PE. Here, the cross-
lingual systems using HT/MT projection perform roughly as well as the in-language system for “O”,
“I-C” and “I-P”. These are the most frequent classes. For claims and major claims, which have lower
frequency, the in-language upper bound tends to perform better. Noteworthy, the in-language system is

always better for the beginnings of an argument component (B-MC,B-C,B-P), which confirms our above
analysis. The direct transfer system, in contrast, performs much worse, particularly for major claims and
claims, and also for all starts of components, indicating that the blurring (“OOV”) effect is here much
more severe.

6 Conclusion

Showing that the currently available datasets for AM are not adequate for evaluating cross-lingual AM
transfer, we created human and machine translations of one of the most popular current AM datasets,
the dataset of persuasive student essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017). We also machine translated a Chi-
nese corpus of reviews (Li et al., 2017) into English, which provides argumentation structures on hotel
reviews. Performing cross-lingual experiments using suitable adaptations of two popular transfer ap-
proaches, we have shown that machine translation and (naive) projection work considerably better than
direct transfer, even though the former approach contains two sources of noise. Moreover, machine
translation in combination with projection almost performs on the level of in-language upper bound re-
sults. We think that our findings shed further light on the value—and the huge potential—of current
(neural) machine translation systems for cross-lingual transfer. They also cast doubt on current standard
use of direct transfer in cross-lingual scenarios. Instead, we propose to simply machine translate the train
set, when this is possible, and then project labels to the translated text. This eliminates the (particular)
“OOV” and “ordering” problems inherent to direct transfer. Prerequiste to this approach is high quality
MT, which, with the advent of neural techniques, appears to be now available.

We hope our new datasets fuel AM research in languages other than English. In this work, we did not
consider cross-lingual argumentative relation identification, although relations are available in the newly
created parallel PE and CRC datasets. Future work should explore cross-lingual multi-task learning for
AM (Schulz et al., 2018) with the source language as main task and small amounts of labeled target
language data, as well as adversarial training techniques (Yasunaga et al., 2018), which promise to be
beneficial for the particular OOV problem that direct transfer is prone to (though not for the ordering
problem). We also want to combine projection with direct transfer by training on the union of projected
L2 data as well as the original L1 data using shared representations.
