Abstract
Cross-lingual parallelism and small-scale
language variation have recently become
subject of research in both computational
and theoretical linguistics. In this arti-
cle, we use a parallel corpus and an auto-
matic aligner to study English light verb
constructions and their German transla-
tions. We show that parallel corpus data
can provide new empirical evidence for
better understanding the properties of light
verbs. We also study the influence that the
identified properties of light verb construc-
tions have on the quality of their automatic
alignment in a parallel corpus. We show
that, even though characterised by limited
compositionality, these constructions can
be aligned better than fully compositional
phrases, due to an interaction between the
type of light verb construction and its fre-
quency.

1 Introduction
Fine-grained contrastive studies traditionally be-
long to the field of applied linguistics, notably to
translation and second language acquisition stud-
ies. Recently, however, interest for contrastive
studies has been renewed due to developments
in the general theory of language (the notion of
micro-parameters (Kayne, 2000)) on the one hand,
and due to advances in natural language process-
ing based on the exploitation of parallel corpora,
on the other hand.

Parallel corpora are collections of translations
with explicit alignment of sentences. They are im-
portant resources for the automatic acquisition of
the cross-linguistic translation equivalents that are
needed for machine translation. There is also in-
terest in using parallel corpora to automatically de-
velop new annotated linguistic resources by pro-
jecting the annotation that already exists in one

language (usually English) (Padó, 2007; Basili et
al., 2009). Such resources can be used for train-
ing systems for automatic parsing for different lan-
guages. Recently, parallel multilingual corpora
have also been used to improve performance in
mono-lingual tasks (Snyder et al., 2009).

For most of these applications, the aligned sen-
tences in the parallel corpora need to be analysed
into smaller units (phrases and words), which, in
turn, need to be aligned. Although crucial for suc-
cessful use of parallel corpora, word (and phrase)
alignment is still a challenging task (Och and Ney,
2003; Collins et al., 2005; Padó, 2007).

Our research concentrates on one type of con-
struction that needs a special treatment in the task
of aligning corpora and projecting linguistic an-
notation from one language to another, namely
light verb constructions. These constructions, usu-
ally identified as paraphrases of verbs (e.g. have
a laugh means laugh, give a talk means talk),
are frequent, cross-lingually productive forms,
where simple-minded parallelism often breaks
down. Their meaning is partially uncomposi-
tional, formed in a conventional way, which means
that they cannot be analysed as regular construc-
tions and that they cannot be translated to another
language directly word by word. Unlike colloca-
tions and idioms, however, these constructions are
formed according to the same “semi-productive”
pattern in different languages. Due to their cross-
lingual analysability, they can be expected to be
aligned at the word level in a parallel corpus, even
if their components are not direct word-to-word
translations of each other. This means that word
alignment of these constructions, needed for au-
tomatic translation and transferring annotations, is
possible, but it is not straight-forward.

An in-depth study of these constructions in the
specific context of parallel corpora and alignment
can cast new light on the correlation of their lin-
guistic and statistical properties. On the one hand,

52



the statistical large-scale analysis of the behaviour
of these constructions as the output of an align-
ment process provides novel linguistic informa-
tion, which enlarges the empirical base for the
analysis of these constructions, and complements
the traditional grammaticality judgements. On the
other hand, the linguistically fine-grained analysis
of the statistical behaviour of these constructions
provides linguistically-informed performance and
error analyses that can be used to improve align-
ers.

2 Two Types of Light Verb Constructions
and their Alignment

Light verb constructions have already been iden-
tified as one of the major sources of problems
in transferring semantic annotation between lan-
guages as close as English and German (Burchardt
et al., 2009). Light verb constructions introduce
two kinds of divergences that can pose a problem
for automatic word alignment. In the case of true
light verb constructions (Kearns, 2002), English
phrases such as have a laugh, give [stg.] a wipe,
and take a look typically correspond to German
single words, lachen, wischen, and blicken respec-
tively. Such correspondences can be expected to
result in actual parallel sentences where English
verbs have, give, and take would be either aligned
with the verbs lachen, wischen, and blicken re-
spectively or would have no alignment at all. Such
alignments are not common cases and can be ex-
pected to pose a problem to an automatic aligner.

Another type of divergence concerns construc-
tions with vague action verbs (Kearns, 2002). In
this case, English phrases such as make an agree-
ment, make a decision, and give a talk correspond
to German phrases einen Vertrag schliessen, eine
Entscheidung treffen, and einen Vortrag halten,
respectively. Parallel sentences containing these
constructions should be aligned so that English
nouns agreement, decision, and talk are aligned
with German nouns Vertrag, Entscheidung, and
Vortrag. At the same time, English verb make
should be aligned with German schliessen in the
first example, with treffen in the second, and give
should be aligned with halten in the third example.
Aligning the nouns should not pose any problem,
since these alignments are direct lexical transla-
tions (c.f. (LEO, 2006 9) online dictionary, for ex-
ample) and they can be expected to be aligned in
many different sentences. However, aligning the

verbs is necessarily more complicated, since they
are not direct translations of each other and cannot
be expected to be aligned in other contexts.1

However, the difference between the two types
of light verb constructions is not clear cut. They
are better seen as two ends of a continuum of verb
usages with different degrees of verbs’ lightness
and different degrees of compositionality of the
meaning of constructions. (Stevenson et al., 2004;
Butt and Geuder, 2001; Grimshaw and Mester,
1988). Even though several English verbs have
been identified as having light usages (e.g. take,
make, have, give, pay), there has been little re-
search on the influence that the properties of the
heading light verb can have on the degree of se-
mantic compositionality of the construction.

The purpose of the present research is to exam-
ine the German translation equivalents of the range
of different English light verb constructions occur-
ring in a parallel corpus and study the differential
performance of a standard aligner on this language
pair for these constructions.

3 Experiments

Our study is based on the assumption that the qual-
ity and bijectivity of the alignment are propor-
tional to the corpus frequency and linguistic com-
positionality of the construction. Therefore, we
identify two aspects of the alignment of these con-
structions as the relevant objects of study.

First, we quantify the amount and nature of cor-
rect word alignments for light verb constructions
compared to regular verbs, as determined by hu-
man inspection. Given the described divergences
between English and German, it can be expected
that light verb constructions will be aligned with a
single word more often than constructions headed
by a regular verb. Assuming that the properties
of the heading light verbs do influence semantic
compositionality of the constructions, it can also
be expected that light verb constructions headed
by different verbs will be differently aligned to the
German translations, constituting different types
of constructions.

1Direct word-to-word English translations of schliessen
listed in the LEO dictionary, for example, are: infer, com-
prise, imply, close, close down, conclude, consummate, draw
up, lock, shut, shutdown, sign off, quit, while make is only
listed within the phrase that is translation for this particular
collocation. Similarly, English word translations for treffen
are: encounter, hook up, cross, get together, meet, meet up,
hit, hurt, score, strike, while make can only be found as a part
of the phrase-to-phrase translations.

53



Second, we evaluate the quality of automatic
word alignments of light verb constructions.

Current word alignment models are based on
the assumption that the best word alignments are
composed of the best word-to-word translations
(as an effect of using Expectation-Maximisation
for training). Factors in the translations that de-
viate from one-to-one alignments are often lex-
ically specific (fertility) and require sufficient
statistics. Because of the interaction of these
properties of the alignment model and the semi-
compositionality of light verb constructions, these
constructions can be expected to pose a problem
for automatic word alignment. Specifically, we ex-
pect lower overall quality of word alignment in the
sentences containing light verb constructions than
in the sentences that contain corresponding regular
constructions.

As indicated, however, we also expect that the
quality of automatic word alignment will be influ-
enced by different distributional phenomena that
are not necessarily related to the linguistic prop-
erties of parallel texts, in particular related to fre-
quency of some of the components of the construc-
tion.

These predictions about the alignment of light
verb constructions in English and German and
their realisations in a corpus are examined in an
experiment.

3.1 Materials and Methods
A random sample of instances of each of the de-
fined types of construction was extracted from a
large word-aligned parallel corpus and manually
examined.

3.1.1 Corpus
The instances of the phrases were taken from the
English-German portion of the Europarl corpus
(Koehn, 2005) that contains the proceedings of the
sessions held in 1999, irrespective of the source
language and of the direction of translation. Be-
fore sampling, the corpus was word-aligned using
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). Alignments were
performed in both directions, with German as the
target language and with English as the target lan-
guage.

3.1.2 Word alignment using GIZA++
The program for automatic word alignment,
GIZA++, has been developed within a system for
automatic translation. It implements a series of

statistical word-based translation models. In these
models, word alignment is represented as a single-
valued function, mapping each word in the tar-
get sentence to one word in the source sentence.
To account for the fact that some target language
words cannot be aligned with any source language
word, a special empty word (“NULL”) is intro-
duced in the source sentence.

The definition of word alignment does not al-
low many-to-many mappings between the words
of two languages, needed for representing align-
ment of non-compositional multi-word expres-
sions. However, it allows aligning multiple words
in one language to a single word in the other lan-
guage, which is needed for successful alignment
of English light verb constructions.

3.1.3 Sampling phrase instances
To study light verb constructions in a parallel cor-
pus systematically, we group the instances of the
constructions into two types: light verb construc-
tions headed by the verb take, as an example of
true light verb constructions, and those headed
by the verb make, as an example of vague action
verbs. We compare both types of light verb con-
structions to regular constructions headed by the
verbs which are WordNet synonyms of the verb
make (create, produce, draw, fix, (re)construct,
(re)build, establish) with the same subcategoriza-
tion frame.

We analyse three samples of the constructions,
one for each of the types defined by the heading
verb. Each sample contains 100 instances ran-
domly selected from the word-aligned parallel cor-
pus. The constructions are represented as ordered
pairs of words, where the first word is the verb
that heads the construction and the second is the
noun that heads the verb’s complement. Only the
constructions where the complement is the direct
object were included in the analysis.2

3.1.4 Data collection
The following data were collected for each occur-
rence of the English word pairs.

The word or words in the German sentence that
are actual translation of the English words were
identified. If either the English or German verb

2This means that constructions such as take something
into consideration were not included. The only exception to
this were the instances of the construction take something into
account. This construction was included because it is used as
a variation of take account of something with the same trans-
lations to German.

54



form included auxiliary verbs or modals, these
were not considered. Only the lexical part of the
forms were regarded as word translations.

We then determine the type of mapping be-
tween the translations. If the German transla-
tion of an English word pair includes two words
too (e.g. take+decision↔ Beschluss+fassen), this
was marked as the “2-2” type. If German trans-
lation is a single word, the mapping was marked
with “2-1”. This type of alignment is further dis-
tinguished into “2-1N” and “2-1V”. In the first
subtype, the English construction corresponds to
a German noun (e.g. initiative+taken ↔ Initia-
tive). In the second subtype, the English construc-
tion corresponds to a German verb (e.g. take+look
↔ anschauen). In the cases where a translation
shift occurs so that no translation can be found,
the mapping is marked with “2-0”.

We also collect the information on automatic
alignment for each element of the English word
pair for both alignment directions. These data
were collected for the elements of English word
pairs (verbs and nouns) separately. The alignment
was assessed as “good” if the word was aligned
with its actual translation, as “bad” if the word was
aligned with some other word, and as “no align” if
no alignment was found. Note that the “no align”
label could only occur in the setting were English
was the source language, since all the words in the
sentence had to be aligned in the case where it was
the target language.

For example, a record of an occurrence of the
English construction “make+proposal” extracted
from the bi-sentence in (1) 3 would contain the in-
formation given in (2).

(1) Target language German
EN: He made a proposal.
DE: Er(1) hat(1) einen(3) Vorschlag(4)
gemacht(3).

Target language English
DE: Er hat einen Vorschlag gemacht.
EN: He(1) made(5) a(3) proposal(4).

(2) English instance: made + proposal
German alignment: Vorschlag + gemacht
Type of mapping: 2-2

3Glosses:
Er hat einen Vorschlag gemacht.
he has a proposal made

4 Results

In this section, we present the results of the analy-
ses of both correct (manual) and automatic align-
ment of the three types of constructions, pointing
out the relevant asymmetries.

4.1 Results of Manual Alignment
Table 1 shows how many times each of the four
types of mapping (2-2; 2-1N; 2-1V; 2-0) between
English constructions and their German transla-
tion equivalents occurs in the sample.

We can see that the three types of construc-
tions tend to be mapped to their German equiva-
lents in different ways. First, both types of light
verb constructions are mapped to a single Ger-
man word much more often than the regular con-
structions (38 instances of light verb constructions
with take and 46 instances of light verb construc-
tions with make vs. only 4 instances of regular
constructions.). Confirming our initial hypothe-
sis, this result suggests that the difference between
fully compositional phrases and light verb con-
structions in English can be described in terms of
the degree of the “2-1” mapping to German trans-
lation equivalents.

An asymmetry can be observed concerning the
two subtypes of the “2-1” mapping too. The Ger-
man equivalent of an English construction is more
often a verb if the construction is headed by the
verb take (in 30 occurrences, that is 79% of the 2-
1 cases) than if the construction is headed by the
verb make (28 occurrences, 61% cases).

Table 2: Well-aligned instances of LVCs with take,
with make, and with regular constructions (out of
100), produced by an automatic alignment, in both
alignment directions (target is indicated).

In the case where the German translation equiv-
alent for an English construction is a verb, both
components of the English construction are in-
cluded in the corresponding German verb, the ver-
bal category of the light verb and the lexical con-
tent of the nominal complement. These instances
are less compositional, more specific and id-
iomatic (e.g. take+care↔ kümmern, take+notice
↔ berücksichtigen).

On the other hand, English constructions that
correspond to a German noun are more compo-
sitional, less idiomatic and closer to the regular
verb usages (e.g. make+proposal ↔ Vorschlag,
make+changes ↔ Korrekturen). The noun that
is regarded as their German translation equivalent
is, in fact, the equivalent of the nominal part of
the construction, while the verbal part is simply
omitted. This result suggests that English light
verb constructions with take are less composi-
tional than the light verb constructions with make.

4.2 Results on Automatic Alignment
We evaluate the quality of automatic alignment of
light verb constructions in comparison with reg-
ular phrases taking into account two factors, the
alignment direction and the frequency of the ele-
ments of the constructions. The results are pre-
sented in the next two sections.

4.2.1 Direction of Alignment
Table 2 shows how the quality of automatic align-
ment varies depending on the direction of align-
ment, as well as on the type of construction. Re-
call that more than one target word can be aligned
to the same source word and all words of the target
have to be aligned.

It can be noted that all the three types of con-
structions are better aligned if the target language
is English. However, the difference in the quality
is bigger in light verb constructions than in regular
constructions, clearly because in this direction the
multi-word property of the English light verb con-
structions can be represented. Both words are well
aligned in light verb constructions with take in 57
cases and with make in 40 cases if the target lan-
guages is English, which is comparable with regu-
lar constructions (42 cases). However, if the target
language is German, both types of light verb con-
structions are aligned well (both words) in only 5
cases, while regular constructions are well aligned
in 26 cases.

Looking into the alignment of the elements of
the constructions (verbs and nouns) separately, we
can notice that nouns are generally better aligned
than verbs for all the three types of constructions,
and in both directions. However, this difference
is not the same in all cases. The difference in
the quality of alignment of nouns and verbs is
the same in both alignment directions for regular
constructions, but it is more pronounced in light
verb constructions if German is the target. On the
other hand, if English is the target, the difference
is smaller in light verb construction than in regular
phrases. These results suggest that the direction of
alignment influences more the alignment of verbs
than the alignment of nouns in general. This influ-
ence is much stronger in light verb constructions
than in regular constructions.

Finally, our initial hypothesis that the quality of
alignment of light verb constructions is lower than
the quality of alignment of regular constructions
has only been confirmed in the case where German
is the target language (both words well aligned in
26 cases, compared to only 5 cases in both types
of light verb constructions). Regular verbs are es-
pecially better aligned than light verbs in this case
(32 : 6). However, if the target is English, the qual-
ity of alignment of regular constructions is simi-
lar to that of light verb constructions with make
(42 and 40 good alignments respectively), while
the constructions with take are aligned even bet-
ter than the other two types (57 good alignments).
These results suggest that the type of construction
which is the least compositional and the most id-
iomatic of the three is best aligned if the direction
of alignment suits its properties.

instances of the three types of constructions in re-
lation with the frequency of the complements in
the sample. The percentages represent the number
of well-aligned instances out of the overall number
of instances within one frequency range. English
is the target language.

4.2.2 Frequency
Since the quality of alignment of the three types
of constructions proved different from what was
expected in the case where English was the target
language, we examine further the automatic align-
ment in this direction. In particular, we study its
interaction with frequency.

The frequency of the nouns is defined as the
number of occurrences in the sample. It ranges
from 1 to 20 occurrences in the sample of 100 in-
stances. The instances of the constructions were
divided into three frequency ranges: instances
containing nouns with 1 occurrence were con-
sidered as low frequency items; those contain-
ing nouns that occurred 5 and more times in the
sample were considered as high frequency items;
nouns occurring 2, 3, and 4 times were considered
as medium frequency items. Only low and high
frequency items were considered in this analysis.

Table 3 reports the number of instances belong-
ing to different frequency ranges. It can be noted
that light verb constructions with take exhibit a
small number of low frequency nouns. The num-
ber of low frequency nouns increases in the con-
structions with make (25/100), and it is much big-
ger in regular constructions (62/100). The op-
posite is true for high frequency nouns (LVCs

with take: 76/100, with make: 35/100, regular:
8/100). Such distribution of low/high frequency
items reflects different collocational properties of
the constructions. In the most idiomatic construc-
tions (with take), lexical selection is rather limited
which results in little variation. Verbs in regular
constructions select for a wide range of different
complements with little reoccurrence. Construc-
tions with make can be placed between these two
types.

Different trends in the quality of automatic
alignment can be identified for the three types of
constructions depending on the frequency range of
the complement in the constructions, as shown in
Table 4. The quality of alignment of both com-
ponents of the constructions is comparable for all
the three types of constructions in low frequency
items (in 33% of instances of light verb construc-
tions with take, 32% of light verb constructions
with make, and 34% of regular constructions both
the verb and the noun were well aligned). It is
also improved in high frequency items in all the
three types, compared to low frequency. However,
the improvement is bigger in light verb construc-
tions with take (62% well aligned cases) than in
LVCs with make (51%) and in regular construc-
tions (50%).4

Looking into the components of the construc-
tions separately, we can notice interesting differ-
ences in the quality of automatic alignment of
verbs. The proportion of well-aligned verbs in-
creases with the frequency of their complements in
light verb constructions with take (33% of low fre-
quency items compared to 76% of high frequency
items.) It stays almost the same in light verb con-
structions with make (48% of low frequency items
and 51% of high frequency items), and it even de-
creases in regular items (85% of low frequency
items compared to only 50% of high frequency
items).

5 Discussion

The results reported in the previous section con-
firm both components of our first hypothesis (on
the expected differences in cross-lingual mapping)
and refine the conditions under which the sec-
ond hypothesis (on the expected differences in the
quality of automatic alignment) is true. We discuss

4Note that the high frequency regular items are repre-
sented with only 8 instances, which is why the trends might
not be clear enough for this subtype.

57



these conclusions in detail here.

5.1 Manual Alignment

Recall that the first component of our first hypoth-
esis indicated that it is expected that light verb
constructions will be aligned with a single word
more often than constructions headed by a regular
verb.

The analysis of corpus data has shown that
there is a clear difference between English regu-
lar phrases and light verb constructions in the way
they are mapped to their translation equivalents in
German. Regular constructions are mapped word-
by-word, with the English verb being mapped to
the German verb, and the English noun to the Ger-
man noun. A closer look into the only 4 exam-
ples where regular constructions were mapped as
“2-1” shows that this mapping is not due to the
“lightness” of the verb. In two of these cases, it is
the content of the verb that is translated, not that
of the noun (produce+goods↔ Produktion; estab-
lishes+rights↔ legt). This never happens in light
verb constructions.

On the other hand, light verb constructions are
much more often translated with a single Ger-
man word. In both subtypes of the “2-1” map-
ping of light verb constructions, it is the con-
tent of the nominal complement that is translated,
not that of the verb. The noun is either trans-
formed into a verb (take+look ↔ anschauen) or
it is translated directly with the verb being omitted
(take+initiative↔ Initiative).

This difference provides empirical grounds for
distinguishing between semantically full and se-
mantically impoverished verbs, a task that is often
difficult on the basis of syntactic tests, since they
often exhibit the same syntactic properties.

The second component of the first hypothesis
indicated that it was expected that the two types of
light verb constructions be differently aligned.

The finding that English light verb construc-
tions with take tend to be aligned more often with a
single German verb and less often to a single Ger-
man noun than the constructions with make justi-
fies classifying the instances into the types based
on the heading verb, which is not a common prac-
tice in the linguistic literature. It suggests that
some semantic or lexical properties of these verbs
can determine the type of the construction. More
precisely, the meaning of the constructions with
take can be regarded as less compositional than the

meaning of the constructions with make. This dif-
ference is also supported by the findings of a pre-
liminary study of Serbian translation equivalents
of these constructions (Samardžić, 2008). English
constructions with take tend to be translated with
a single verb in Serbian, while the constructions
with make are usually translated word-by-word. 5

5.2 Automatic alignment
The second hypothesis conjectured that we would
find lower overall quality of word alignment in
the sentences containing light verb constructions
than in the sentences that contain corresponding
regular constructions. The findings of this re-
search show that the interactions between align-
ment and types of constructions is actually more
complicated than this simple hypothesis, in some
expected and some unexpected ways. To sum-
marise, we found, first, better alignment of regu-
lar constructions compared to light verb construc-
tions only if the target language is German; sec-
ond, overall, alignment if English is target is bet-
ter than if German is target; and thirdly, we found
a clear frequency by construction interaction in the
quality of alignment.

The quality of automatic alignment of both reg-
ular constructions and light verb constructions in-
teracts with the direction of alignment. First,
the alignment is considerably better if the target
language is English than if it is German, which
confirms the findings of (Och and Ney, 2003).
Second, the expected difference in the quality of
alignment between regular constructions and light
verb constructions has only been found in the di-
rection of alignment with German as the target
language, that is where the “2-1” mapping is ex-
cluded. However, the overall quality of alignment
in this direction is lower than in the other.

This result could be expected, given the general
morphological properties of the two languages, as
well as the formalisation of the notion of word
alignment used in the system for automatic align-
ment. According to this definition, multiple words
in the target language sentence can be aligned with
a single word in the source language sentence,
but not the other way around. Since English is

5The difference in the level of semantic compositionality
of the constructions with take and make could follow from
some semantic properties of these verbs, such as different
aspectual properties or argument structures. However, es-
tablishing such a relation would require a more systematic
semantic study of light, as well as full lexical uses of these
verbs.

58



a morphologically more analytical language than
German, multiple English words often need to be
aligned with a single German word (a situation al-
lowed if English is the target but not if German is
the target).

The phrases in (3) illustrate the two most com-
mon cases of such alignments. First, English
tends to use functional words (the preposition of
in (3a)), where German applies inflection (geni-
tive suffixes on the article des and on the noun Ba-
nanensektors in (3b). Second, compounds are re-
garded as multiple words in English (banana sec-
tor), while they are single words in German (Ba-
nanensektors). This asymmetry explains both the
fact that automatic alignment of all the three types
of constructions is better when the target language
is English and that the alignment of light verb con-
structions is worse than the alignment of regular
phrases when it is forced to be expressed as one-
to-one mapping, which occurs when German is the
alignment target.

Practically, all these factors need to be taken
into consideration in deciding which version of
alignment should be taken, be it for evaluation or
for application in other tasks such as automatic
translation or annotation projection. The inter-
section of the two directions has been proved to
provide most reliable automatic alignment (Padó,
2007; Och and Ney, 2003). However, it excludes,
by definition, all the cases of potentially useful
good alignments that are only possible in one di-
rection of alignment.

Linguistically, the fact that the expected differ-
ence in the quality of alignment between regular
constructions and light verb constructions has only
been found in the direction where English con-
structions could not be aligned with single German
words can be seen as another empirical indication
of semantic impoverishment of light verbs in com-
parison with full lexical verbs.

Finally, we found an unexpected frequency by
construction interaction (Table 4), which explains
the finding that regular phrases are not better
aligned than light verb constructions if English is
the target language (opposite to our second hy-
pothesis). This interaction, well known in lan-
guage processing and acquisition, occurs in those
cases where marked constructions are very fre-
quent. In our case, the marked construction is the

semi-compositional light verb construction with
take, which has frequent noun complements. In
this case, despite the non-regularity of the con-
struction, alignment is performed well if the di-
rection of alignment allows its mapping to a sin-
gle word. Also, with respect to this phenomenon,
the constructions with take behave more markedly
than those with make.

What is especially interesting about these data
is the fact that the alignment is different not just
between light verb constructions and regular con-
structions, but also between the two types of
light verb constructions. The constructions with
take exhibit more consistent properties of irregu-
lar items, while the constructions with make can be
positioned somewhere between irregular and regu-
lar items. This additionally confirms the claim that
these two types of constructions differ in the level
of semantic compositionality, providing a basis for
an improvement in their linguistic account.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we have proposed a contrastive study
of light verb constructions based on data collected
through alignments of parallel corpora. We have
shown how a linguistically refined analysis can
shed light on particularly difficult cases for an
alignment program, a useful result for improving
current statistical machine translation systems. We
have also shown how properties and behaviours of
these constructions that can be found only in large
parallel corpora and through sophisticated compu-
tational tools can shed light on the linguistic nature
of the constructions under study.

Much remains to be done, both in this general
methodology and for this particular kind of con-
struction. As an example, we note that the fact that
nouns are aligned better than verbs in all the three
types of constructions deserves more investiga-
tion. What we do not yet know is whether this fact
can be related to some known distributional differ-
ences between these two classes or not. It might
also mean that nominal lexical items are more sta-
ble across languages than verbal ones. This can
have implications for machine translations, as well
as for annotation projection, since the stable words
can be used as pivots for alignment and transfer al-
gorithms.
