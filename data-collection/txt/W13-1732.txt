Abstract

We report on the performance of two different
feature sets in the Native Language Identification
Shared Task (Tetreault et al., 2013). Our feature
sets were inspired by existing literature on native
language identification and word networks. Exper-
iments show that word networks have competitive
performance against the baseline feature set, which
is a promising result. We also present a discussion
of feature analysis based on information gain, and an
overview on the performance of different word net-
work features in the Native Language Identification
task.

1 Introduction

Native Language Identification (NLI) is a well-
established problem in NLP, where the goal is to
identify a writer’s native language (L1) from his/her
writing in a second language (L2), usually English.
NLI is generally framed as a multi-class classifi-
cation problem (Koppel et al., 2005; Brooke and
Hirst, 2011; Wong and Dras, 2011), where native
languages (L1) are considered class labels, and writ-
ing samples in L2 are used as training and test data.
The NLI problem has recently seen a big surge in
interest, sparked in part by three influential early pa-
pers on this problem (Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001;
van Halteren and Oostdijk, 2004; Koppel et al.,
2005). Apart from shedding light on the way non-
native learners (also called “L2 learners”) learn a
new language, the NLI task allows constrastive anal-
ysis (Wong and Dras, 2009), study of different types

of errors that people make while learning a new lan-
guage (Kochmar, 2011; Bestgen et al., 2012; Jarvis
et al., 2012), and identification of language trans-
fer patterns (Brooke and Hirst, 2012a; Jarvis and
Crossley, 2012), thereby helping L2-students im-
prove their writing styles and expediting the learn-
ing process. It also helps L2 educators to concen-
trate their efforts on particular areas of a language
that cause the most learning difficulty for different
L1s.

The NLI task is closely related to traditional NLP
problems of authorship attribution (Juola, 2006; Sta-
matatos, 2009; Koppel et al., 2009) and author pro-
filing (Kešelj et al., 2003; Estival et al., 2007a; Esti-
val et al., 2007b; Bergsma et al., 2012), and shares
many of the same features. Like authorship attri-
bution, NLI is greatly benefitted by having function
words and character n-grams as features (Brooke
and Hirst, 2011; Brooke and Hirst, 2012b). Native
languages form a part of an author’s socio-cultural
and psychological profiles, thereby being related to
author profiling (van Halteren and Oostdijk, 2004;
Torney et al., 2012).

Researchers have used different types of features
for the NLI problem, including but not limited to
function words (Brooke and Hirst, 2012b); char-
acter, word and POS n-grams (Brooke and Hirst,
2012b); spelling and syntactic errors (Koppel et al.,
2005); CFG productions (Brooke and Hirst, 2012b);
Tree Substitution Grammar productions (Swanson
and Charniak, 2012); dependencies (Brooke and
Hirst, 2012b); Adaptor Grammar features (Wong et
al., 2012); L1-influence (Brooke and Hirst, 2012a);
stylometric features (Golcher and Reznicek, 2011;

Crossley and McNamara, 2012; Jarvis et al., 2012);
recurrent n-grams on words and POS (Bykh and
Meurers, 2012); and features derived from topic
models (Wong et al., 2011). State-of-the-art re-
sults are typically in the 80%-90% range, with re-
sults above 90% reported in some cases (Brooke
and Hirst, 2012b). Note, however, that results vary
greatly across different datasets, depending on the
number of languages being considered, size and dif-
ficulty of data, etc.

2 Our Approach

The NLI 2013 Shared Task (Tetreault et al., 2013)
marks an effort in bringing together the NLI research
community to share and compare their results and
evaluations on a common dataset - TOEFL11 (Blan-
chard et al., 2013) - consisting of 12,100 unique En-
glish essays written by non-native learners of eleven
different languages.1 The dataset has 9,900 essays
for training, 1,100 essays for test, and 1,100 essays
for development. Each of the three sets is balanced
across different L1s.

Inspired by previous work in NLI, in our different
NLI systems submissions we used several different
types of character, word, and POS n-gram features
(cf. Section 2.1). Although not included in the sys-
tems submitted, we also experimented with a family
of new features derived from a word network repre-
sentation of natural language text (cf. Section 2.2).
We used Weka (Hall et al., 2009) for all our classifi-
cation experiments. The systems that were submit-
ted gave best 10-fold cross-validation accuracy on
training data among different feature-classifier com-
binations (Section 3). Word network features - al-
though competitive against the baseline n-gram fea-
tures - were not able to beat the baseline features
on the training set, so we did not submit that sys-
tem for evaluation. Section 2.1 discusses our n-gram
features, followed by a discussion of word network
features in Section 2.2.

2.1 N-gram Features

We used several baseline n-gram features based on
words, characters, and POS. We experimented with
the raw frequency, normalized frequency, and binary

Korean, Spanish, Telugu and Turkish.

presence/absence indicator on top 100, 200, 500 and
1000 n-grams:2

1. word n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3), with and without
punctuation.

2. character n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3), with and with-
out space characters.

3. POS n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3), with and without
punctuation.3

We experimented with punctuation because pre-
vious research indicates that punctuation is help-
ful (Wong and Dras, 2009; Kochmar, 2011). In total,
there are 216 types of n-gram feature vectors (with
dimensions 100, 200, 500 and 1000) for a particular
document. Because of size restrictions (e.g., some n-
gram dictionaries are smaller than the specified fea-
ture vector dimensions), we ended up with 168 types
of feature vectors per document (cf. Tables 2 to 4).

2.2 Word Networks

A “word network” of a particular document is a net-
work (graph) of unique words found in that docu-
ment. Each node (vertex) in this network is a word.
Edges between two nodes (unique words) can be
constructed in several different ways. The simplest
type of edge connects word A to word B, if word
A is followed by word B in the document at least
once. In our work, we have assumed a directed edge
with direction from word A to word B. Note that we
could have used undirected edges as well (cf. (Mi-
halcea and Tarau, 2004)). Moreover, edges can
be weighted/unweighted. We assumed unweighted
edges.

A deeper issue with this network construction
process concerns what we should do with stopwords.
Should we keep them, or should we remove them?
Since stopwords and function words have proved to
be of special importance in previous native language
identification studies (Wong and Dras, 2009; Brooke
and Hirst, 2012b), we chose to keep them in our
word networks.

Two other choices we made in the construction
of our word networks concern sentence boundaries

2Note that these most frequent n-grams were extracted from
the training+development set.

3We used CRFTagger (Phan, 2006) for POS tagging.

and word co-occurrence. Word networks can be
constructed either by respecting sentence boundaries
(where the last word of sentence 1 does not link
to the first word of sentence 2), or by disregard-
ing them. In our case, we disregarded all sentence
boundaries. Moreover, a network edge can either
link two words that appeared side-by-side in the
original document, or it can link two words that ap-
peared within a window of n words in the document
(cf. (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004)). In our case, we
chose the first option - linking unique words that ap-
peared side-by-side at least once. Finally, we did
not perform any stemming/morphological analysis
to retain subtle cues that might be revealed from in-
flected/derived words.

The word network of an example sentence (“the
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”) is
shown in Figure 1. Note that the word “the” ap-
peared twice in this sentence, so the correspond-
ing network contains a cycle that starts at “the”
and ends at “the”. In a realistic word network of
a large document, there can be many such cycles.
In addition, it is observed that such word networks
show power-law degree distribution and a small-
world structure (i Cancho and Solé, 2001; Matsuo
et al., 2001).

Once the word networks have been constructed,
we extract a set of simple features from these net-

works4 that represent local properties of individual
nodes. We have extracted ten local features for each
node in a word network:

1. in-degree, out-degree and degree

2. in-coreness, out-coreness and coreness5

3. in-neighborhood size (order 1), out-
neighborhood size (order 1) and neighborhood
size (order 1)

4. local clustering coefficient

We take a set of representative words, and convert
a document into a local feature vector - each local
feature pertaining to one word in the set of repre-
sentative words. For example, when we use the top
200 most frequent words as the representative set,
a document can be represented as the degree vec-
tor of these 200 words in the document’s word net-
work, or as the local clustering coefficient vector of
these words in the word network, or as the coreness
vector of the words (and so on). A document can
also be represented as a concatenation (mixture) of
these vectors. For example, it can be represented
as concat(degree vector, coreness vector) of top
200 most frequent words. We are yet to explore
how such mixed feature sets perform in the NLI
task, and this constitutes a part of our future work
(Section 4). We experimented with top k most fre-
quent words (with k = 100, 200, 500, 1000) on train-
ing+development data as our representative word-
set.

3 Results

Table 1 describes the three systems we submitted.
The first two systems (UNT-closed-1.csv and UNT-
closed-2.csv) were based on a bag of words model
using all the words from the training set. The
systems used a home-grown implementation of the
Naı̈ve Bayes classifier, and achieved 10-fold cross-
validation accuracy of 64.5% and 65.1% respec-
tively, on the training set. The first system used raw

4We used the igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) software
package for graph feature extraction.

5Coreness is an index given to a particular vertex based
on its position in the k-core decomposition of the word net-
work (Batagelj and Zaversnik, 2003).

term frequency of all words including stopwords as
features, and the second system used raw term fre-
quency of all words except stopwords. These two
systems achieved test set accuracy of 63.2% and
63.7%, respectively.

The third system we submitted (UNT-closed-
3.csv) was based on n-gram features (cf. Sec-
tion 2.1). We used the raw frequency of top 1000
word unigrams, including punctuation, as features.
The Weka SMO implementation of SVM (Hall et
al., 2009) was used as classifier with default param-
eter settings. This system gave us the best 10-fold
cross-validation accuracy of 62.46% in the training
set, among all n-gram features. Note that this system
was also the top performer among the systems we
submitted in NLI evaluation, with a test set accuracy
of 64.5%, and a 10-fold CV accuracy of 63.77% on
the training+development set folds specified by the
organizers.

We will now describe in the following two sub-
sections how our n-gram features and word network
features performed on the training set. All results re-
ported here reflect best 10-fold cross-validation ac-
curacy in the training set among different classifiers
(SVM, Naı̈ve Bayes, 1-nearest-neighbor (1NN), J48
decision tree, and AdaBoost). SVM and Naı̈ve
Bayes gave best results in our experiments, so only
these two are shown in Tables 2 to 5.

3.1 Performance of N-gram Features

Recall from Section 2.1 that we extracted 168 differ-
ent n-gram feature vectors corresponding to the raw
frequency, normalized frequency, and binary pres-
ence/absence indicator of top k n-grams (with k =
100, 200, 500, 1000) in the training+development

set. Performance of these n-gram features is given
in Tables 2 to 4. A general observation with Tables 2
to 4 is that cross-validation performance improves as
k increases, although there are a few exceptions. We
marked those exceptions with an asterisk (“*”).

It is interesting to note that top k word unigrams
with punctuation were the top performers in most
of the cases. Also interesting is the fact that SVM
mostly gave best performance on n-gram features
among different classifiers. Note that Naı̈ve Bayes
was best performer in a few cases (Table 4). Per-
formance of raw and normalized frequency features
were mostly comparable (Tables 2 and 3), whereas
binary presence/absence indicator achieved worse
accuracy values in general than raw and normalized
frequency features (Table 4).

Among different n-grams, word unigrams per-
formed better than bigrams and trigrams, POS bi-
grams performed better than POS trigrams, and
character bigrams and character trigrams performed
comparably well (Tables 2 and 3). Exceptions to
this observation are seen in Table 4, where character
trigrams performed better than character bigrams,
and word bigrams sometimes performed better than
word unigrams. In general, word n-grams performed
the best, followed by POS and character n-grams.

3.2 Performance of Word Network Features

Word networks and word network features were de-
scribed in Section 2.2. We extracted ten local fea-
tures on four different representative sets of words
- the top k most frequent words (k = 100, 200, 500,
1000) on the training+development set, respectively.
Performance of these features is given in Table 5.
Note that in general, word network features per-

formed quite well, with the best result (60.41% CV
accuracy on the train set) being competitive against
(but slightly worse than) the baseline n-gram fea-
tures (62.46% CV accuracy on the train set). Perfor-
mance improved with increasing k, thereby corrob-
orating our general observation from Tables 2 to 4.
Clustering coefficient performed poorly, and seems
rather unsuitable for the NLI task. But degree, core-
ness, and neighborhood size performed good. Here
also, SVM turned out to be the best classifier, giving
best CV accuracy in all cases.

all versions of degree, coreness and neighborhood

network features are the most discriminatory in this
task, we collected all ten word network features of
the top 1000 words in a single file, and then ranked
those features on the training set based on Infor-
mation Gain (IG). The 20 top-ranking features are
shown in Table 6, along with their corresponding
IG values. Note that the words a, the, and however
were among the most discriminatory, and different
versions of degree, neighborhood size and coreness
appeared among the top, which is in line with our

earlier observation that clustering coefficients were
not very discriminatory at the native language clas-
sification task.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we described experiments with the NLI
task using a baseline set of n-gram features, and a
set of novel features derived from a word network
representation of text documents. Useful and less
useful n-gram features were identified, along with
the fact that SVM was the best classifier in most
of the cases. We learned that when using raw or
normalized frequency, lower-order n-grams perform
at least as good as higher-order n-grams; moreover,
Naı̈ve Bayes sometimes give good results when bi-
nary presence/absence indicator variables are used
as features.

We described the construction of our word net-
works in detail, and discussed experiments with
word network features. These features are compet-
itive against the baseline n-gram features, and we
need to fine-tune our classifiers to see if they can
exceed the performance of the baseline. Cluster-
ing coefficients were found to be less useful for the
NLI task, and feature ranking based on information

gain helped us identify the most important word net-
work features in a collection of top 1000 words in
the training+development set.

Future work consists of experimenting with com-
bined word network features; mixed word network
features and baseline n-gram features; and the one-
vs-all classification scheme instead of the multiclass
classification scheme.
