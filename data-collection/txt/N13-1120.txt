Abstract

In this work, we study the problem of mea-
suring relational similarity between two word
pairs (e.g., silverware:fork and clothing:shirt).
Due to the large number of possible relations,
we argue that it is important to combine mul-
tiple models based on heterogeneous informa-
tion sources. Our overall system consists of
two novel general-purpose relational similar-
ity models and three specific word relation
models. When evaluated in the setting of a
recently proposed SemEval-2012 task, our ap-
proach outperforms the previous best system
substantially, achieving a 54.1% relative in-
crease in Spearman’s rank correlation.

1 Introduction

The problem of measuring relational similarity is
to determine the degree of correspondence between
two word pairs. For instance, the analogous word
pairs silverware:fork and clothing:shirt both exem-
plify well a Class-Inclusion:Singular Collective re-
lation and thus have high relational similarity. Un-
like the problem of attributional similarity, which
measures whether two words share similar attributes
and is addressed in extensive research work (Bu-
danitsky and Hirst, 2006; Reisinger and Mooney,
2010; Radinsky et al., 2011; Agirre et al., 2009; Yih
and Qazvinian, 2012), measuring relational similar-
ity is a relatively new research direction pioneered
by Turney (2006), but with many potential appli-
cations. For instance, problems of identifying spe-
cific relations between words, such as synonyms,

∗Work conducted while interning at Microsoft Research.

antonyms or associations, can be reduced to mea-
suring relational similarity compared to prototypical
word pairs with the desired relation (Turney, 2008).
In scenarios like information extraction or question
answering, where identifying the existence of cer-
tain relations is often the core problem, measuring
relational similarity provides a more flexible solu-
tion rather than creating relational classifiers for pre-
defined or task-specific categories of relations (Tur-
ney, 2006; Jurgens et al., 2012).

In order to promote this research direction, Ju-
rgens et al. (2012) proposed a new shared task of
measuring relational similarity in SemEval-2012 re-
cently. In this task, each submitted system is re-
quired to judge the degree of a target word pair
having a particular relation, measured by its re-
lational similarity compared to a few prototypical
example word pairs. The system performance is
evaluated by its correlation with the human judg-
ments using two evaluation metrics, Spearman’s
rank correlation and MaxDiff accuracy (more de-
tails of the task and evaluation metrics will be given
in Sec. 3). Although participating systems incorpo-
rated substantial amounts of information from lex-
ical resources (e.g., WordNet) and contextual pat-
terns from large corpora, only one system (Rink and
Harabagiu, 2012) is able to outperform a simple
baseline that uses PMI (pointwise mutual informa-
tion) scoring, which demonstrates the difficulty of
this task.

In this paper, we explore the problem of mea-
suring relational similarity in the same task setting.
We argue that due to the large number of possible
relations, building an ensemble of relational simi-

1000



larity models based on heterogeneous information
sources is the key to advance the state-of-the-art on
this problem. By combining two general-purpose re-
lational similarity models with three specific word-
relation models covering relations like IsA and syn-
onymy/antonymy, we improve the previous state-
of-the-art substantially – having a relative gain of
54.1% in Spearman’s rank correlation and 14.7% in
the MaxDiff accuracy!

Our main contributions are threefold. First, we
propose a novel directional similarity method based
on the vector representation of words learned from
a recurrent neural network language model. The re-
lation of two words is captured by their vector off-
set in the latent semantic space. Similarity of rela-
tions can then be naturally measured by a distance
function in the vector space. This method alone
already performs better than all existing systems.
Second, unlike the previous finding, where SVMs
learn a much poorer model than naive Bayes (Rink
and Harabagiu, 2012), we show that using a highly-
regularized log-linear model on simple contextual
pattern features collected from a document collec-
tion of 20GB, a discriminative approach can learn a
strong model as well. Third, we demonstrate that by
augmenting existing word-relation models, which
cover only a small number of relations, the overall
system can be further improved.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We
first survey the related work in Sec. 2 and formally
define the problem in Sec. 3. We describe the indi-
vidual models in detail in Sec. 4. The combination
approach is depicted in Sec. 5, along with experi-
mental comparisons to individual models and exist-
ing systems. Finally, Sec. 6 concludes the paper.

2 Related Work

Building a classifier to determine whether a relation-
ship holds between a pair of words is a natural ap-
proach to the task of measuring relational similarity.
While early work was mostly based on hand-crafted
rules (Finin, 1980; Vanderwende, 1994), Rosario
and Hearst (2001) introduced a machine learning ap-
proach to classify word pairs. They targeted clas-
sifying noun modifier pairs from the medical do-
main into 13 classes of semantic relations. Fea-
tures for each noun modifier pair were constructed

using large medical lexical resources and a multi-
class classifier was trained using a feed-forward neu-
ral network with one hidden layer. This work was
later extended by Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003)
to classify general domain noun-modifier pairs into
30 semantic relations. In addition to extracting fea-
tures using WordNet and Roget’s Thesaurus, they
also experimented with several different learners in-
cluding decision trees, memory-based learning and
inductive logic programming methods like RIPPER
and FOIL. Using the same dataset as in (Nastase
and Szpakowicz, 2003), Turney and Littman (2005)
created a 128-dimentional feature vector for each
word pair based on statistics of their co-occurrence
patterns in Web documents and applied the k-NN
method (k = 1 in their work).

Measuring relational similarity, which determines
whether two word pairs share the same relation, can
be viewed as an extension of classifying relations
between two words. Treating a relational similar-
ity measure as a distance metric, a testing pair of
words can be judged by whether they have a rela-
tion that is similar to some prototypical word pairs
having a particular relation. A multi-relation clas-
sifier can thus be built easily in this framework as
demonstrated in (Turney, 2008), where the prob-
lems of identifying synonyms, antonyms and asso-
ciated words are all reduced to finding good anal-
ogous word pairs. Measuring relational similarity
has been advocated and pioneered by Turney (2006),
who proposed a latent vector space model for an-
swering SAT analogy questions (e.g., mason:stone
vs. carpenter:wood). In contrast, we take a slightly
different view when building a relational similarity
measure. Existing classifiers for specific word re-
lations (e.g., synonyms or Is-A) are combined with
general relational similarity measures. Empirically,
mixing heterogeneous models tends to make the fi-
nal relational similarity measure more robust.

Although datasets for semantic relation classifica-
tion or SAT analogous questions can be used to eval-
uate a relational similarity model, their labels are ei-
ther binary or categorical, which makes the datasets
suboptimal for determining the quality of a model
when evaluated on instances of the same relation
class. As a result, Jurgens et al. (2012) proposed a
new task of “Measuring Degrees of Relational Simi-
larity” at SemEval-2012, which includes 79 relation

1001



categories exemplified by three or four prototypical
word pairs and a schematic description. For exam-
ple, for the Class-Inclusion:Taxonomic relation, the
schematic description is “Y is a kind/type/instance
of X”. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk1, they col-
lected word pairs for each relation, as well as their
degrees of being a good representative of a partic-
ular relation when compared with defining exam-
ples. Participants of this shared task proposed var-
ious kinds of approaches that leverage both lexical
resources and general corpora. For instance, the
Duluth systems (Pedersen, 2012) created word vec-
tors based on WordNet and estimated the degree of
a relation using cosine similarity. The BUAP sys-
tem (Tovar et al., 2012) represented each word pair
as a whole by a vector of 4 different types of fea-
tures: context, WordNet, POS tags and the aver-
age number of words separating the two words in
text. The degree of relation was then determined
by the cosine distance of the target pair from the
prototypical examples of each relation. Although
their models incorporated a significant amount of
information of words or word pairs, unfortunately,
the performance were not much better than a ran-
dom baseline, which indicates the difficulty of this
task. In comparison, a supervised learning approach
seems more promising. The UTD system (Rink and
Harabagiu, 2012), which mined lexical patterns be-
tween co-occurring words in the corpus and then
used them as features to train a Naive Bayes classi-
fier, achieved the best results. However, potentially
due to the large feature space, this strategy did not
work as well when switching the learning algorithm
to SVMs.

3 Problem Definition & Task Description

Following the setting of SemEval-2012 Task 2 (Ju-
rgens et al., 2012), the problem of measur-
ing the degree of relational similarity is to rate
word pairs by the degree to which they are
prototypical members of a given relation class.
For instance, comparing to the prototypical word
pairs, {cutlery:spoon, clothing:shirt, vermin:rat} of
the Class-Inclusion:Singular Collective relation, we
would like to know among the input word pairs
{dish:bowl, book:novel, furniture:desk}, which one

best demonstrates the relation.
Because our approaches are evaluated using the

data provided in this SemEval-2012 task, we de-
scribe briefly below how the data was collected, as
well as the metrics used to evaluate system perfor-
mance. The dataset consists of 79 relation classes
that are chosen according to (Bejar et al., 1991)
and broadly fall into 10 main categories, includ-
ing Class-Inclusion, Part-Whole, Similar and more.
With the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk, Jurgens
et al. (2012) used a two-phase approach to collect
word pairs and their degrees. In the first phase,
a lexical schema, such as “a Y is one item in a
collection/group of X” for the aforementioned rela-
tion Class-Inclusion:Singular Collective, and a few
prototypical pairs for each class were given to the
workers, who were asked to provide approximately
a list of 40 word pairs representing the same rela-
tion class. Naturally, some of these pairs were bet-
ter examples than the others. Therefore, in the sec-
ond phase, the goal was to measure the degree of
their similarity to the corresponding relation. This
was done using the MaxDiff technique (Louviere
and Woodworth, 1991). For each relation, about one
hundred questions were first created. Each question
consists of four different word pairs randomly sam-
pled from the list. The worker was then asked to
choose the most and least representative word pairs
for the specific relation in each question.

The set of 79 word relations were randomly split
into training and testing sets. The former contains
10 relations and the latter has 69. Word pairs in all
79 relations were given to the task participants in ad-
vance, but only the human judgments of the training
set were available for system development. In this
work, we treat the training set as the validation set
– all the model exploration and refinement is done
using this set of data, as well as the hyper-parameter
tuning when learning the final model combination.

The quality of a relational similarity measure is
estimated by its correlation to human judgments.
This is evaluated using two metrics in the task: the
MaxDiff accuracy and Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient (ρ). A system is first asked to pick the
most and least representative word pairs of each
question in the MaxDiff setting. The average accu-
racy of the predictions compared to the human an-
swers is then reported. In contrast, Spearman’s ρ

measures the correlation between the total orderings
of all word pairs of a relation, where the total order-
ing is derived from the MaxDiff answers (see (Jur-
gens et al., 2012) for the exact procedure).

4 Models for Relational Similarity

We investigate three types of models for relational
similarity. Operating in a word vector space, the di-
rectional similarity model compares the vector dif-
ferences of target and prototypical word pairs to es-
timate their relational similarity. The lexical pat-
tern method collects contextual information of pairs
of words when they co-occur in large corpora, and
learns a highly regularized log-linear model. Finally,
the word relation models incorporate existing, spe-
cific word relation measures for general relational
similarity.

4.1 Directional Similarity Model

Our first model for relational similarity extends pre-
vious work on semantic word vector representa-
tions to a directional similarity model for pairs of
words. There are many different methods for cre-
ating real-valued semantic word vectors, such as
the distributed representation derived from a word
co-occurrence matrix and a low-rank approxima-
tion (Landauer et al., 1998), word clustering (Brown
et al., 1992) and neural-network language model-
ing (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010). Each
element in the vectors conceptually represents some
latent topicality information of the word. The goal
of these methods is that words with similar mean-
ings will tend to be close to each other in the vector
space.

Although the vector representation of single
words has been successfully applied to problems
like semantic word similarity and text classifica-
tion (Turian et al., 2010), the issue of how to repre-
sent and compare pairs of words in a vector space
remains unclear (Turney, 2012). In a companion
paper (Mikolov et al., 2013), we present a vector
offset method which performs consistently well in
identifying both syntactic and semantic regularities.
This method measures the degree of the analogy
“a is to b as c is to d” using the cosine score of
(~vb−~va +~vc, ~vd), where a, b, c, d are the four given
words and ~va, ~vb, ~vc, ~vd are the corresponding vec-

tors. In this paper, we propose a variant called the
directional similarity model, which performs bet-
ter for semantic relations. Let ωi = (wi1 , wi2) and
ωj = (wj1 , wj2) be the two word pairs being com-
pared. Suppose (~vi1 , ~vi2) and (~vj1 , ~vj2) are the cor-
responding vectors of these words. The directional
vectors of ωi and ωj are defined as ~υi ≡ ~vi2 − ~vi1
and ~υj ≡ ~vj2 − ~vj1 , respectively. Relational simi-
larity of these two word pairs can be measured by
some distance function of υi and υj , such as the co-
sine function:

~υi · ~υj
‖~υi‖‖~υj‖

The rationale behind this variant is as follows. Be-
cause the difference of two word vectors reveals the
change from one word to the other in terms of mul-
tiple topicality dimensions in the vector space, two
word pairs having similar offsets (i.e., being rela-
tively parallel) can be interpreted as they have simi-
lar relations. Fig. 1 further illustrates this method.

Compared to the original method, this variant
places less emphasis on the similarity between
words wj1 and wj2 . That similarity is necessary
for syntactic relations where the words are often re-
lated by morphology, but not for semantic relations.
On semantic relations studied in this paper, the di-
rectional similarity model performs about 18% rela-
tively better in Spearman’s ρ than the original one.

The quality of the directional similarity method
depends heavily on the underlying word vector
space model. We compared two choices with dif-

ferent dimensionality settings: the word embedding
learned from the recurrent neural network language
model (RNNLM)2 and the LSA vectors, both were
trained using the same Broadcast News corpus of
320M words as described in (Mikolov et al., 2011).
All the word vectors were first normalized to unit
vectors before applying the directional similarity
method. Given a target word pair, we computed
its relational similarity compared with the prototyp-
ical word pairs of the same relation. The average
of these measurements was taken as the final model
score. Table 1 summarizes the results when evalu-
ated on the training set. As shown in the table, the
RNNLM vectors consistently outperform their LSA
counterparts with the same dimensionality. In addi-
tion, more dimensions seem to preserve more infor-
mation and lead to better performance. Therefore,
we take the 1600-dimensional RNNLM vectors to
construct our final directional similarity model.

4.2 Lexical Pattern Model

Our second model for measuring relational similar-
ity is built based on lexical patterns. It is well-known
that contexts in which two words co-occur often pro-
vide useful cues for identifying the word relation.
For example, having observed frequent text frag-
ments like “X such as Y”, it is likely that there is a
Class-Inclusion:Taxonomic relation between X and
Y; namely, Y is a type of X. Indeed, by mining lexical
patterns from a large corpus, the UTD system (Rink
and Harabagiu, 2012) managed to outperform other
participants in the SemEval-2012 task of measuring
relational similarity.

In order to find more co-occurrences of each pair
of words, we used a large document set that con-
sists of the Gigaword corpus (Parker et al., 2009),
Wikipedia and LA Times articles3, summing up to
more than 20 Gigabytes of texts. For each word
pair (w1, w2) that co-occur in a sentence, we col-
lected the words in between as its context (or so-
called “raw pattern”). For instance, “such as” would
be the context extracted from “X such as Y” for
the word pair (X, Y). To reduce noise, contexts with
more than 9 words were dropped and 914,295 pat-
terns were collected in total.

Treating each raw pattern as a feature where the
value is the logarithm of the occurrence count, we
then built a probabilistic classifier to determine the
association of the context and relation. For each re-
lation, we treated all its word pairs as positive ex-
amples and all the word pairs in other relations as
negative examples4. 79 classifiers were trained in
total, where each one was trained using 3,218 ex-
amples. The degree of relational similarity of each
word pair can then be judged by the output of the
corresponding classifier5. Although this seems like a
standard supervised learning setting, the large num-
ber of features poses a challenge here. Using almost
1M features and 3,218 examples, the model could
easily overfit if not regularized properly, which may
explain why learning SVMs on pattern features per-
formed poorly (Rink and Harabagiu, 2012). In-
stead of employing explicit feature selection meth-
ods, we used an efficient L1 regularized log-linear
model learner (Andrew and Gao, 2007) and chose
the hyper-parameters based on model performance
on the training data. The final models we chose
were trained with L1 = 3, where 28,065 features
in average were selected automatically by the algo-

3We used a Nov-2010 dump of English Wikipedia, which
contains approximately 917M words after pre-processing. The
LA Times corpus consists of articles from 1985 to 2002 and has
about 1.1B words.

4Given that not all word pairs belonging to the same relation
category are equally good, removing those with low judgment
scores may help improve the quality of the labeled data. We
leave this study to future work.

5Training a separate classifier for each MaxDiff question us-
ing all words pairs except the four target pairs appears to be a
better setting, as it would avoid including the target pairs in the
training process. We did not use this setting because it is more
complicated and performed roughly the same empirically.

rithm. The performance on the training data is 0.322
in Spearman’s ρ and 41.8% in MaxDiff accuracy.

4.3 Word Relation Models

The directional similarity and lexical pattern mod-
els can be viewed as general purpose methods for
relational similarity as they do not differentiate the
specific relation categories. In contrast, for specific
word relations, there exist several high-quality meth-
ods. Although they are designed for detecting spe-
cific relations between words, incorporating them
could still improve the overall results. Next, we ex-
plore the use of some of these word relation mod-
els, including information encoded in the knowledge
base and a lexical semantic model for synonymy and
antonymy.

4.3.1 Knowledge Bases

Predetermined types of relations can often be
found in existing lexical and knowledge databases,
such as WordNet’s Is-A taxonomy and the exten-
sive relations stored in the NELL (Carlson et al.,
2010) knowledge base. Although in theory, these
resources can be directly used to solve the problem
of relational similarity, such direct approaches often
suffer from two practical issues. First, the word cov-
erage of these databases is usually very limited and
it is common that the relation of a given word pair
is absent. Second, the degree of relation is often not
included, which makes the task of measuring the de-
gree of relational similarity difficult.

One counter example, however, is Probase (Wu
et al., 2012), which is a knowledge base that es-
tablishes connections between more than 2.5 mil-
lion concepts discovered automatically from the
Web. For the Is-A and Attribute relations it en-
codes, Probase also returns the probability that two
input words share the relation, based on the co-
occurrence frequency. We used some relations in
the training set to evaluate the quality of Probase.
For instance, its Is-A model performs exception-
ally well on the relation Class-Inclusion:Taxonomic,
reaching a high Spearman’s ρ = 0.642 and MaxD-
iff accuracy 55.8%. Similarly, its Attribute model
performs better than our lexical pattern model
on Attribute:Agent Attribute-State with Spearman’s
ρ = 0.290 and MaxDiff accuracy 32.7%.

4.3.2 Lexical Semantics Measures
Most lexical semantics measures focus on the se-

mantic similarity or relatedness of two words. Since
our task focuses on distinguishing the difference be-
tween word pairs in the same relation category. The
crude relatedness model does not seem to help in our
preliminary experimental study. Instead, we lever-
age the recently proposed polarity-inducing latent
semantic analysis (PILSA) model (Yih et al., 2012),
which specifically estimates the degree of synonymy
and antonymy. This method first forms a signed co-
occurrence matrix using synonyms and antonyms in
a thesaurus and then generalizes it using a low-rank
approximation derived by SVD. Given two words,
the cosine score of their PILSA vectors tend to be
negative if they are antonymous and positive if syn-
onymous. When tested on the Similar:Synonymity
relation, it has a Spearman’s ρ = 0.242 and MaxD-
iff accuracy 42.1%, both are better than those of our
directional similarity and lexical pattern models.

5 Model Combination

In order to fully leverage the diverse models pro-
posed in Sec. 4, we experiment with a model combi-
nation approach and conduct a model ablation study.
Performance of the combined and individual models
is evaluated using the test set and compared with ex-
isting systems.

We seek an optimal linear combination of all the
individual models by treating their output as fea-
tures and use a logistic regression learner to learn
the weights6. The training setting is essentially the
same as the one used to learn the lexical pattern
model (Sec. 4.2). For each relation, we treat all the
word pairs in this relation group as positive exam-
ples and all other word pairs as negative ones. Con-
sequently, 79 sets of weights for model combination
are learned in total. The average Spearman’s ρ of the
10 training relations is used for selecting the values
of the L1 and L2 regularizers7. Evaluated on the re-
maining 69 relations (i.e., the test set), the average
results of each main relation group and the overall

6Nonlinear methods, such as MART (Friedman, 2001), do
not perform better in our experiments (not reported here).

7We tested 15 combinations, where L1 ∈ {0, 0.01, 0.1} and
L2 ∈ {0, 0.001, 0.01, 1, 10}. The parameter setting that gave
the highest Spearman rank correlation coefficient score on the
training set was selected.

results are presented in Table 2. For comparison, we
also show the performance of a random baseline and
the best performing system of each participant in the
SemEval-2012 task.

We draw two conclusions from this table. First,
both of our general relational similarity models, the
directional similarity (DS) and lexical pattern (Pat)
models are fairly strong. The former outperforms
the previous best system UTDNB in both Spear-
man’s ρ and MaxDiff accuracy, where the differ-
ences are statistically significant8; the latter has
comparable performance, where the differences are
not statistically significant. In contrast, while the
IsA relation from Probase is exceptionally good
in identifying Class-Inclusion relations, with high
Spearman’s ρ = 0.619 and MaxDiff accuracy

8We conducted a paired-t test on the results of each of the
69 relation. The difference is considered statistically significant
if the p-value is less than 0.05.

59.6%, it does not have high correlations with hu-
man judgments in other relations. Like in the case of
Probase Attribute and PILSA, specific word-relation
models individually are not good measures for gen-
eral relational similarity. Second, as expected, com-
bining multiple diverse models (Com) is a robust
strategy, which provides the best overall perfor-
mance. It achieves superior results in both evalua-
tion metrics compared to UTDNB and only a lower
Spearman’s ρ value in one of the ten relation groups
(namely, Reference). The differences are statisti-
cally significant with p-value less than 10−3.

In order to understand the interaction among dif-
ferent component models, we conducted an ablation
study by iteratively removing one model from the fi-
nal combination. The weights are re-trained using
the same procedure that finds the best regularization
parameters with the help of training data. Table 3
summarizes the results and compares them with the

original combination model.
Overall, it is clear that the directional similarity

method based on RNNLM vectors is the most crit-
ical component model. Removing it from the fi-
nal combination decreases both the Spearman’s ρ
and MaxDiff accuracy by a large margin; both dif-
ferences (Com vs. -DS) are statistically significant.
The Probase IsA model also has an important im-
pact on the performance on the Class-Inclusion re-
lation group. Eliminating the IsA model makes
the overall MaxDiff accuracy statistically signifi-
cantly lower (Com vs. -IsA). Again, the benefits
of incorporating Probase Attribute and PILSA mod-
els are not clear. Removing them from the final
combination lowers the MaxDiff accuracy, but nei-
ther the difference in Spearman’s ρ nor MaxDiff
accuracy is statistically significant. Compared to
the RNNLM directional similarity model, the lex-
ical pattern model seems less critical. Removing
it lowers the Similar and Contrast relation groups,
but improves some other relation groups like Class-
Inclusion and Case Relations. The final MaxDiff ac-
curacy becomes slightly higher but the Spearman’s
ρ drops a little (Com vs. -Pat); neither is statistically
significant.

Notice that the main purpose of the ablation study
is to verify the importance of an individual compo-
nent model when a significant performance drop is
observed after removing it. However, occasionally
the overall performance may go up slightly. Typi-

cally this is due to the fact that some models do not
provide useful signals to a particular relation, but in-
stead introduce more noise. Such effects can often
be alleviated when there are enough quality training
data, which is unfortunately not the case here.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented a system that combines
heterogeneous models based on different informa-
tion sources for measuring relational similarity. Our
two individual general-purpose relational similarity
models, directional similarity and lexical pattern
methods, perform strongly when compared to ex-
isting systems. After incorporating specific word-
relation models, the final system sets a new state-of-
the-art on the SemEval-2012 task 2 test set, achiev-
ing Spearman’s ρ = 0.353 and MaxDiff accuracy
45.4% – resulting in 54.1% and 14.7% relative im-
provement in these two metrics, respectively.

Despite its simplicity, our directional similarity
approach provides a robust model for relational sim-
ilarity and is a critical component in the final sys-
tem. When the lexical pattern model is included, our
overall model combination method can be viewed
as a two-stage learning system. As demonstrated in
our work, with an appropriate regularization strat-
egy, high-quality models can be learned in both
stages. Finally, as we observe from the positive ef-
fect of adding the Probase IsA model, specific word-
relation models can further help improve the system

although they tend to cover only a small number of
relations. Incorporating more such models could be
a steady path to enhance the final system.

In the future, we plan to pursue several research
directions. First, as shown in our experimental re-
sults, the model combination approach does not al-
ways outperform individual models. Investigating
how to select models to combine for each specific re-
lation or relation group individually will be our next
step for improving this work. Second, because the
labeling process of relational similarity comparisons
is inherently noisy, it is unrealistic to request a sys-
tem to correlate human judgments perfectly. Con-
ducting some user study to estimate the performance
ceiling in each relation category may help us focus
on the weaknesses of the final system to enhance
it. Third, it is intriguing to see that the directional
similarity model based on the RNNLM vectors per-
forms strongly, even though the RNNLM training
process is not related to the task of relational sim-
ilarity. Investigating the effects of different vector
space models and proposing some theoretical jus-
tifications are certainly interesting research topics.
Finally, we would like to evaluate the utility our ap-
proach in other applications, such as the SAT anal-
ogy problems proposed by Turney (2006) and ques-
tion answering.
