Abstract

This paper describes the 2010 phrase-based
statistical machine translation system de-
veloped at the TALP Research Center of
the UPC1 in cooperation with BMIC2 and
VMU3. In phrase-based SMT, the phrase
table is the main tool in translation. It is
created extracting phrases from an aligned
parallel corpus and then computing trans-
lation model scores with them. Performing
a collocation segmentation over the source
and target corpus before the alignment
causes that di�erent and larger phrases
are extracted from the same original doc-
uments. We performed this segmentation
and used the union of this phrase set with
the phrase set extracted from the non-
segmented corpus to compute the phrase
table. We present the con�gurations con-
sidered and also report results obtained
with internal and o�cial test sets.

1 Introduction

The TALP Research Center of the UPC1 in coop-
eration with BMIC2 and VMU3 participated in the
Spanish-to-English WMT task. Our primary sub-
mission was a phrase-based SMT system enhanced
with POS tags and our contrastive submission was
an augmented phrase-based system using colloca-
tion segmentation (Costa-jussà et al., 2010), which
mainly is a way of introducing new phrases in the
translation table. This paper presents the descrip-
tion of both systems together with the results that
we obtained in the evaluation task and is organized
as follows: �rst, Section 2 and 3 present a brief de-
scription of a phrase-based SMT, followed by a gen-
eral explanation of collocation segmentation. Sec-
tion 4 presents the experimental framework, corpus
used and a description of the di�erent systems built
for the translation task; the section ends showing
the results we obtained over the o�cial test set. Fi-
nally, section 5 presents the conclusions obtained
from the experiments.

2 Phrase-based SMT

This approach to SMT performs the translation
splitting the source sentence in segments and as-
signing to each segment a bilingual phrase from
a phrase-table. Bilingual phrases are translation
units that contain source words and target words,
e.g. < unidad de traducción | translation unit >,
and have di�erent scores associated to them. These
bilingual phrases are then sorted in order to max-
imize a linear combination of feature functions.
Such strategy is known as the log-linear model
(Och and Ney, 2003) and it is formally de�ned as:

ê = arg max
e

[
M∑

m=1

λmhm (e, f)

]
(1)

where hm are di�erent feature functions with
weights λm. The two main feature functions
are the translation model (TM) and the target
language model (LM). Additional models include
POS target language models, lexical weights, word
penalty and reordering models among others.

3 Collocation segmentation

Collocation segmentation is the process of de-
tecting boundaries between collocation segments
within a text (Daudaravicius and Marcinkeviciene,
2004). A collocation segment is a piece of text be-
tween boundaries. The boundaries are established
in two steps using two di�erent measures: the Dice
score and a Average Minimum Law (AML).
The Dice score is used to measure the associa-

tion strength between two words. It has been used
before in the collocation compiler XTract (Smadja,
1993) and in the lexicon extraction system Cham-
pollion (Smadja et al., 1996). It is de�ned as fol-
lows:

Dice (x; y) =
2f (x, y)

f (x) + f (y)
(2)

where f (x, y) is the frequency of co-occurrence of
x and y, and f (x) and f (y) the frequencies of
occurrence of x and y anywhere in the text. It gives
high scores when x and y occur in conjunction.
The �rst step then establishes a boundary between

98



two adjacent words when the Dice score is lower
than a threshold t = exp (−8). Such a threshold
was established following the results obtained in
(Costa-jussà et al., 2010), where an integration of
this technique and a SMT system was performed
over the Bible corpus.

The second step of the procedure uses the AML.
It de�nes a boundary between words xi−1 and xi
when:

Dice (xi−2;xi−1) +Dice (xi;xi+1)

2
> Dice (xi−1;xi)

(3)

That is, the boundary is set when the Dice value
between words xi and xi−1 is lower than the aver-
age of preceding and following values.

4 Experimental Framework

All systems were built using Moses (Koehn et al.,
2007), a state-of-the-art software for phrase-based
SMT. For preprocessing Spanish, we used Freeling
(Atserias et al., 2006), an open source library of
natural language analyzers. For English, we used
TnT (Brants, 2000) and Moses' tokenizer. The
language models were built using SRILM (Stolcke,
2002).

4.1 Corpus

This year, the translation task provided four dif-
ferent sources to collect corpora for the Spanish-
English pair. Bilingual corpora included version 5
of the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005), the News
Commentary corpus and the United Nations cor-
pus. Additional English corpora was available from
the News corpus. The organizers also allowed the
use of the English Gigaword Third and Fourth Edi-
tion, released by the LDC. As for development
and internal test, the test sets from 2008 and 2009
translation tasks were available.

For our experiments, we selected as training data
the union of the Europarl and the News Commen-
tary. Development was performed with a section
of the 2008 test set and the 2009 test set was se-
lected as internal test. We deleted all empty lines,
removed pairs that were longer than 40 words, ei-
ther in Spanish or English; and also removed pairs
whose ratio between number of words were bigger
than 3.

As a preprocess, all corpora were lower-cased
and tokenized. The Spanish corpus was tokenized
and POS tags were extracted using Freeling, which
split clitics from verbs and also separated words
like �del� into �de el�. In order to build a POS tar-
get language model, we also obtained POS tags
from the English corpus using the TnT tagger.
Statistics of the selected corpus can be seen in Ta-
ble 1.

Table 2: Unknown words found in internal and
o�cial test sets

It is important to notice that neither the United
Nations nor the Gigaword corpus were used for
bilingual training. Nevertheless, the English part
from the United Nations and the monolingual
News corpus were used to build the language model
of our systems.

4.1.1 Unknown words

We analyzed the content from the internal and of-
�cial test and realized that they both contained
many words that were not seen in the training data.
Table 2 shows the number of unknown words found
in both sets, classi�ed according to their POS.
In average, we may expect an unknown word

every two sentences in the internal test and more
than one per sentence in the o�cial test set. It can
also be seen that most of those unknown words are
proper nouns, representing 32% and 79% of the
unknown sets, respectively. Common nouns were
the second most frequent type of unknown words,
followed by verbs and adjectives.

4.2 Systems

We submitted two di�erent systems for the trans-
lation task. First a baseline using the training data
mentioned before; and then an augmented system,
where the baseline-extracted phrase list was ex-
tended with additional phrases coming from a seg-
mented version of the training corpus.
We also considered an additional system built

99



with two di�erent decoding path, a standard path
from words to words and POS and an alternative
path from stems to words and POS in the target
side. At the end, we did not submit this system
to the translation task because it did not provide
better results than the previous two in our internal
test.
The set of feature functions used include: source-

to-target and target-to-source relative frequen-
cies, source-to-target and target-to-source lexical
weights, word and phrase penalties, a target lan-
guage model, a POS target language model, and a
lexicalized reordering model (Tillman, 2004).

4.2.1 Considering stems as an alternate

decoding path.

Using Moses' framework for factored translation
models we de�ned a system with two decoding
paths: one decoding path using words and the
other decoding path using stems in the source lan-
guage and words in the target language. Both de-
coding paths only had a single translation step.
The possibility of using multiple alternative decod-
ing path was developed by Birch et. al. (2007).
This system tried to solve the problem with the

unknown words. Because Spanish is morphologi-
cally richer than English, this alternative decoding
path allowed the decoder translate words that were
not seen in the training data and shared the same
root with other known words.

4.2.2 Expanding the phrase table using

collocation segmentation.

In order to build the augmented phrase table with
the technique mentioned in section 3, we seg-
mented each language of the bilingual corpus in-
dependently and then, using the collocation seg-
ments as words, we aligned the corpus and ex-
tracted the phrases from it. Once the phrases were
extracted, the segments of each phrase were split
again in words to have standard phrases. Finally,
we use the union of this phrases and the phrases
extracted from the baseline system to compute the
�nal phrase table. A diagram of the whole proce-
dure can be seen in �gure 1.
The objective of this integration is to add new

phrases in the translation table and to enhance
the relative frequency of the phrases that were ex-
tracted from both methods.

4.2.3 Language model interpolation.

Because SMT systems are trained with a bilingual
corpus, they ended highly tied to the domain the
corpus belong to. Therefore, when the documents
we want to translate belong to a di�erent domain,
additional domain adaptation techniques are rec-
ommended to build the system. Those techniques
usually employ additional corpora that correspond
to the domain we want to translate from.

Table 4: Results from translation task

The test set for this translation task comes from
the news domain, but most of our bilingual cor-
pora belonged to a political domain, the Europarl.
Therefore we use the additional monolingual cor-
pus to adapt the language model to the news do-
main.

The strategy used followed the experiment per-
formed last year in (R. Fonollosa et al., 2009).
We used SRILM during the whole process. All
language models were order �ve and used modi-
�ed Kneser-Ney discount and interpolation. First,
we build three di�erent language models accord-
ing to their domain: Europarl, United Nations and
news; then, we obtained the perplexity of each lan-
guage model over the News Commentary develop-
ment corpus; next, we used compute-best-mix to
obtain weights for each language model that di-
minish the global perplexity. Finally, the models
were combined using those weights.

In our experiments all systems used the resulting
language model, therefore the di�erence obtained
in our results were cause only by the translation
model.

4.3 Results

We present results from the three systems devel-
oped this year. First, the baseline, which included
all the features mentioned in section 4.2; then, the
system with an alternative decoding path, called
baseline+stem; and �nally the augmented system,
which integrated collocation segmentation to the
baseline. Internal test results can be seen in table
3. Automatic scores provided by the WMT 2010
organizers for the o�cial test can be found in ta-
ble 4. All BLEU scores are case-insensitive and
tokenized except for the o�cial test set which also
contains case-sensitive and non-tokenized score.

We obtained a BLEU score of 26.1 and 25.1 for
our case-insensitive and sensitive outputs, respec-
tively. The highest score was obtained by Uni-
versity of Cambridge, with 30.5 and 29.1 BLEU
points.

4.3.1 Comparing systems

Once we obtained the translation outputs from the
baseline and the augmented system, we performed
a manual comparison of them. Even though we
did not �nd any signi�cant advantages of the aug-
mented system over the baseline, the collocation
segmentation strategy chose a better morphologi-
cal structures in some cases as can be seen in Table
5 (only sentence sub-segments are shown):

5 Conclusion

We presented two di�erent submissions for the
Spanish-English language pair. The language
model for both system was built interpolating two
big out-of-domain language models and one smaller
in-domain language model. The �rst system was a
baseline with POS target language model; and the
second one an augmented system, that integrates
the baseline with collocation segmentation. Re-
sults over the o�cial test set showed no di�erence
in BLEU between these two, even though internal
results showed that the baseline obtained a better
score.

We also considered adding an additional decod-
ing path from stems to words in the baseline but
internal tests showed that it did not improve trans-
lation quality either. The high number of unknown
words found in Spanish suggested us that consider-
ing in parallel the simple form of stems could help

us achieve better results. Nevertheless, a deeper
study of the unknown set showed us that most
of those words were proper nouns, which do not
have in�ection and therefore cannot bene�ted from
stems.

Finally, despite that internal test did not showed
an improvement with the augmented system, we
submitted it as a secondary run looking for the
e�ect these phrases could have over human evalu-
ation.
