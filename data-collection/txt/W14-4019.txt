Abstract

The argument-adjunct distinction is cen-
tral to most syntactic and semantic the-
ories. As optional elements that refine
(the meaning of) a phrase, adjuncts are
important for recursive, compositional ac-
counts of syntax, semantics and transla-
tion. In formal accounts of machine trans-
lation, adjuncts are often treated as modi-
fiers applying synchronously in source and
target derivations. But how well can the
assumption of synchronous adjunction ex-
plain translation equivalence in actual par-
allel data? In this paper we present the
first empirical study of translation equiva-
lence of adjuncts on a variety of French-
English parallel corpora, while varying
word alignments so we can gauge the ef-
fect of errors in them. We show that for
proper measurement of the types of trans-
lation equivalence of adjuncts, we must
work with non-contiguous, many-to-many
relations, thereby amending the traditional
Direct Correspondence Assumption. Our
empirical results show that 70% of manu-
ally identified adjuncts have adjunct trans-
lation equivalents in training data, against
roughly 50% for automatically identified
adjuncts.

1 Introduction

Most syntactic and semantic theories agree on the
argument-adjunct distinction, although they vary
on the specifics of this distinction. Common to
these theories is that adjunction is a central de-
vice for language recursion, as adjunction modi-
fies initial but complete sentences by adding op-
tional phrases; adjunction also contributes to se-
mantic compositionality, albeit in various ways,
as syntactic adjuncts may take different seman-
tic roles. Shieber and Schabes (1990) transfer the

role of adjuncts from monolingual syntax (Joshi
et al., 1975) to the realm of translation equiva-
lence using a Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mars (STAG), and propose to view adjunction as
a synchronous operation for recursive, composi-
tional translation. STAG therefore relies substan-
tially on what Hwa (2002) calls the Direct Corre-
spondence Assumption, the notion that semantic
or syntactic relations correspond across a bitext.
We know from various works–notably by Hwa et
al. (2002) for dependency relations, Arnoult and
Sima’an (2012) for adjuncts, and Padó and Lap-
ata (2009) and Wu and Fung (2009) for semantic
roles–that the Direct Correspondence Assumption
does not always hold.

A question that has not received much atten-
tion is the degree to which the assumption of
synchronous adjunction is supported in human
translation data. This is crucial for the succes-
ful application of linguistically-motivated STAG,
but attempts at answering this question empirically
are hampered by a variety of difficulties. Lin-
guistic structures may diverge between languages
(Dorr, 1994), translations may be more or less lit-
eral, and annotation resources may be inaccurate,
when they are available at all. Besides, automatic
word alignments are known to be noisy and man-
ual alignments are rather scarse. The work of
Arnoult and Sima’an (2012) reports lower and up-
per bounds of one-to-one adjunct correspondence,
using rather limited resources to identify French
adjuncts making their results not directly applica-
ble for measuring the stability of the synchronous
adjunction assumption.

In this paper we aim at redefining the transla-
tion equivalence of adjuncts in ways that allow us
to report far more accurate bounds on their cross-
linguistic correspondence. In particular, we are in-
terested in measuring adjunct correspondence ro-
bustly, in training data.

Consider for example the sentence pair of Fig-

157



ure 1. Most adjuncts in each sentence translate
as adjuncts in the other sentence, but one of these
translation equivalences appears to be many-to-
many, because of parsing mismatches across the
bitext; both parses and adjunct labellers on both
sides of the bitext must be on par for adjunct trans-
lation equivalences to be established. Besides, one
generally establishes translation equivalence using
word alignments, which may be noisy. Another
factor is that of the degree of translation equiva-
lence in the data in general; while parallel bitexts
express the same meaning, meaning may diverge
locally.

Figure 1: Example sentence pair

This paper contributes the first study to mea-
sure the degree of adjunction synchronicity: we
derive many-to-many pairings between adjuncts
across a bitext, thus supporting a generic view
of translation equivalence, where meaning can
be expressed by distinct entities and redistributed
freely in translation; practically, this also allows
us to capture equivalence in spite of mismatched
parses. We abstract away from word alignments
to a certain degree, as we directly pair adjuncts
across a bitext, but we still use word alignments–
namely the overlap of adjunct projections with tar-
get adjuncts–to decide on these pairings. We fur-
ther distinguish between adjunct pairings that are
bijective through the word alignment, and other
pairings, where the translation equivalence does
not exactly agree with the word alignment; we
qualify these pairings as weakly equivalent.

Under this new view of adjunct translation
equivalence, we perform measures in French-

English data. We show that adjunction is pre-
served in 40% to 50% of the cases with automati-
cally labelled adjuncts, with differences between
data sets, word aligners and sentence length;
about 25% more adjuncts form weakly translation-
equivalent pairings. With gold adjunct annota-
tions, the proportion of translation-equivalent ad-
juncts increases to 70%.

These results show that adjunct labelling accu-
racy on both sides of the data is crucial for adjunct
alignment, while suggesting that applications that
exploit adjunction can gain from decreasing their
dependence on word alignments and idealized ex-
perimental conditions , and identifying favorable
contexts for adjunct preservation.

2 Alignment-based role pairing

How can one find translation-equivalent adjuncts
using word alignments, without being too con-
strained by the latter? Obviously, adjunct pairs
that are consistent with the word alignments are
translation equivalent, but we also want to be able
to identify translation-equivalent adjuncts that are
not exactly aligned to each other, and also to ac-
cept many-to-many pairings; not only to get lin-
guistically justified discontinuous pairs, as with
the French double negation particle, but also for
robustness with regard to dissimilar attachments
in the French and English parses.

2.1 Translation equivalence under the
alignment-consistency constraint

Consider for instance Figure 2, which represents
a word alignment for part of the sentence pair of
Figure 1. We would like to match f̄2 to ē2 and ē6,
f̄3 to ē3, f̄4 to ē5, and f̄5 to ē6. If one only pairs
adjuncts that are consistent with the word align-
ment, one obtains only half of these adjunct pairs:
〈f̄3, ē3〉 and 〈f̄4, ē5〉; one cannot pair up f̄5 and
ē6 because the latter is also aligned outside of the
former; and one can also not find the equivalence
between f̄2 on one hand and ē2 and ē6 on the other
hand if one assumes one-to-one correspondence
between adjuncts.

2.2 Translation equivalence through
projection

We align adjuncts across the bitext by projecting
them through the word alignment and finding, for
each adjunct, the shortest adjunct or sequence of
adjuncts that overlaps the most with that adjunct’s

Figure 2: Example with word alignment

projection. To prevent source adjuncts from be-
ing aligned to the first target adjunct that sub-
sumes their projection, we also enforce that only
non-overlapping source adjuncts may be aligned
to a same target sequence, as explained in sec-
tion 2.2.1.

This procedure results in a many-to-many align-
ment between adjuncts on either side. We distin-
guish several types of adjunct pairings through this
alignment, which we interpret as divergent, equiv-
alent or weakly equivalent, as described in sec-
tion 2.2.2.

We perform this alignment in both source-target
and target-source directions to measure the pro-
portion of source, respectively target, adjuncts that
fall in each category.

2.2.1 Adjunct pairing procedure
We define the projection of an adjunct σ as the
unique tuple of maximal, non-overlapping phrases
φn1 that are aligned to σ through the word align-
ment. Each phrase φi in this tuple is understood
as being extended with possible surrounding un-
aligned positions–phrases are primarily identified
by the aligned positions they cover. And each φi
is maximal as any larger phrase distinct from φi
would also include (aligned) positions not aligned
to σ. Let I(φi) be the set of aligned positions
in each φi, and I(φn1 ) the set of aligned positions

covered by φn1 .
We align σ to the non-overlapping sequence

of target adjuncts τm1 that has the smallest set of
aligned positions while having the largest over-
lap with φn1 ; the overlap of a projection and a tar-
get sequence is the intersection of their respective
sets of aligned positions. For instance in Figure 2,
the projection of f̄4 is maximally covered by ē2,
ē4, and ē5; we align the latter to f̄4 as it covers
the least aligned positions. In practice, we search
through the tree of target adjuncts for adjuncts that
overlap with φn1 , and for each such adjunct τ we
compare its overlap with φn1 to that of the sequence
of its children γk1 to determine which (of τ or γ

k
1 )

should be part of the final target sequence.
We perform a similar selection on overlapping

source adjuncts that point to the same target se-
quence. For each source adjunct σ, we determine
if its target sequence τm1 is also aligned to adjuncts
dominated by σ, in which case we compare the
overlap of σ’s projection with τn1 to that of its chil-
dren in the source adjunct tree to determine which
should be aligned to τm1 . For instance in Figure 2,
ē4 is aligned to f̄2 (when projecting from English
to French), but so is ē2; as ē2’s projection overlaps
more with f̄2, we discard the alignment between
ē4 and f̄2.

The final alignments for our example are repre-
sented in Table 1.

2.2.2 Types of adjunct pairings
We distinguish three main classes of adjunct
translation equivalence: divergent, equivalent and
weakly equivalent. We further subdivide each
class into two types, as shown in Table 2. Ad-
junct pairings fall into one of these types depend-
ing on their configuration (unaligned, one-to-one
or many-to-many) and their agreement with the
word alignments. Equivalent types notably differ
from weakly equivalent ones by being bijectively

In Table 1, ē4’s translation is divergent as it is
not aligned to any adjunct; f̄5 and ē6 are weakly
equivalent as the projection of f̄5 does not cover
all the aligned positions of ē6. The pairing from f̄2
to ē2, ē6 is many-to-many equivalent, and so are
the pairings from ē2 and ē6 to f̄2; the remaining
pairings are one-to-one equivalent.

As Table 3 shows, the divergent types null and
div regroup untranslated adjuncts (Example 1)
and divergent adjuncts: Examples (2) and (3) show
cases of conflational divergence (Dorr, 1994), that
appear in different types because of the underly-
ing word alignments; in Example (4), the prepo-
sitional phrase with this task has been wrongly
labelled as an adjunct, leading to a falsely diver-
gent pairing. The weakly-equivalent types we-nm
and we-11 regroup both divergent and equiva-
lent pairings: the adjuncts of Examples (5) and (8)
are aligned by our method to adjuncts that are not
their translation equivalent, the adjunct in Exam-
ple (6) cannot be aligned to its equivalent because
of a parsing error, and the equivalences in Exam-
ples (7) and (9) cannot be identified because of a
word-alignment error. Finally, we show a number
of equivalent pairings (eq-nm and eq-11): in
Example (10), an attachment error in the French
parse induces a many-to-one equivalence where
there should be two one-to-one equivalences; Ex-
amples (11) to (13) show a number of true many-
to-many equivalences, while Examples (14) and
(15) show that adjuncts may be equivalent across a
bitext while belonging to a different syntactic cate-
gory and modifying a different type of phrase (15).

3 Adjunct identification

We identify adjuncts in dependency trees obtained
by conversion from phrase-structure trees: we map
modifier labels to adjuncts, except when the de-
pendent is a closed-class word. For English, we
use the Berkeley parser and convert its output with
the pennconverter (Johansson and Nugues, 2007;
Surdeanu et al., 2008); for French, we use the
Berkeley parser and the functional role labeller of
Candito et al. (2010). The pennconverter with de-
fault options and the French converter make sim-
ilar structural choices concerning the representa-
tion of coordination and the choice of heads.

3.1 English adjuncts
We first identify closed-class words by their POS
tag: CC, DT, EX, IN, POS, PRP, PRP$, RP, SYM,
TO, WDT, WP, WP$, WRB. Punctuation marks,
identified by the P dependency relation, and name
dependencies, identified by NAME, POSTHON, or
TITLE, are also treated as closed-class words.

Adjuncts are identified by the dependency rela-
tion: ADV, APPO, NMOD (except determiners, pos-
sessives and ‘of’ complements), PRN, AMOD (ex-
cept when the head is labeled with ADV) and PMOD
left of its head. Cardinals, identified by the CD
POS tag, and remaining dependents are classified
as arguments.

3.2 French adjuncts
Closed-class words are identified by the (coarse)
POS tags: C, D, CL, P, PONCT, P+D, PRO. Aux-
iliary verbs, identified by the dependency relations
aux tps and aux pass, are also included.

Adjuncts are identified by the dependency re-
lations mod rel and mod (except if the depen-
dent’s head is a cardinal number, identified by the
s=card label).

3.3 Evaluation
We evaluate adjunct identification accuracy using
a set of 100 English and French sentences, drawn
randomly from the Europarl corpus. A single an-
notator marked adjuncts in both sets, identifying
slightly more than 500 adjuncts in both sets. We
find F scores of 71.3 and 72.2 for English and
French respectively, as summarized in Table 4. We
find that about a quarter of errors are related to
parse attachment, yielding scores of 77.7 and 78.6
if one corrects them.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental set-up
We measure adjunct translation equivalence in
four data sets: the manually-aligned Canadian
Hansards corpus (Och and Ney, 2003), contain-
ing 447 sentence pairs, the house and senate train-
ing data of the Canadian Hansards (1.13M sen-
tence pairs), the French-English Europarl training
set (1.97M sentence pairs) and the Moses news-
commentaries corpus (156k sentence pairs). Be-
sides, we randomly selected 100 sentence pairs
from the Europarl set to measure adjunct identi-
fication accuracy as reported in section 3 and ad-
junct correspondence with gold adjunct annota-

tions.
All four corpora except the manual Hansards

are preprocessed to keep sentences with up to
80 words, and all four data sets are used jointly
to train unsupervised alignments, both with the
Berkeley aligner (Liang et al., 2006) and GIZA++
(Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) through
mgiza (Gao and Vogel, 2008), using 5 iterations of
Model 1 and 5 iterations of HMM for the Berkeley
aligner, and 5 iterations of Model 1 and HMM and
3 iterations of Model 3 and Model 4 for GIZA++.
The GIZA++ alignments are symmetrized using
the grow-diag-final heuristics. Besides, the man-
ual Hansards corpus is aligned with Sure Only
(SO) and Sure and Possible (SP) manual align-
ments.

4.2 Measurements with gold adjunct
annotations

We compared adjunct translation equivalence of
automatically identified adjuncts and gold anno-
tations using 100 manually annotated sentence
pairs from the Europarl corpus; adjuncts were
aligned automatically, using the Berkeley word
alignments. We also measured adjunct equiv-
alence using automatic adjunct annotations cor-
rected for parse attachment errors, as introduced

161



in section 3.3. Table 5 reports harmonic mean fig-
ures (mh) for each adjunct projection type. For
information, we also report their decomposition in
the case of gold annotations, showing some depen-
dence on the projection direction.

matic, rebracketed and gold adjuncts

About two thirds of manually identified ad-
juncts form equivalent pairs, representing a gain
of 20 points with regard to automatically identi-
fied adjuncts. This is accompanied by a halving of
divergent pairings and of weakly equivalent ones.
Further, we find that about half of the remaining
weak equivalences can be interpreted as transla-
tion equivalent (to compare to an estimated third
for automatically identified adjuncts), allowing us
to estimate to 70% the degree of translation equiv-
alence given Berkeley word alignments in the Eu-
roparl corpus.

4.3 Measurements with manual and
automatic alignments

We aligned adjuncts in the manual Hansards cor-
pus using all four word alignments. Table 6
presents the mean proportions for each category
of adjunct projection.

Comparing the mean proportions per type be-

tween the four alignments, we see that a third of
adjuncts on either side are not aligned at all with
the sure-only manual alignments. In the example
of Figure 2 for instance, these alignments do not
link f̄3 to ē3. On the other hand, the sure and
possible manual alignments lead to many diver-
gent or weakly equivalent pairings, a result of their
dense phrasal alignments. In comparison, the au-
tomatic alignments connect more words than the
sure-only alignments, leading to a mixed result for
the adjunct pairings: one gains more translation-
equivalent, but also more divergent and weakly
equivalent pairs. In this, the Berkeley aligner ap-
pears less noisy than GIZA++, as it captures more
translation equivalent pairs and less weakly equiv-
alent ones. This is confirmed in the other data sets
too, as Table 7 shows.

Comparing figures between the different data
sets, we see that the Europarl and the News
data have more translation-equivalent and less di-
vergent adjuncts than the Hansards training data
(hans-hst). Taking the harmonic mean for both
equivalent types (eq-nm and eq-11), we find
that 48.2% of adjuncts have an adjunct translation
equivalent in the Europarl data (with the Berke-
ley aligner) and 48.0% in the News corpus, against
40.3% the Hansards training set and 41.6% in the
manual Hansards set. This suggests that transla-
tions in the Hansards data are less literal than in
the Europarl or the News corpus.

4.4 Effect of sentence length
We explore the relation between sentence length
and translation equivalence by performing mea-
surements in bucketed data. We bucket the data
using the length of the English sentences. Mea-
surements are reported in Table 8 for the Hansards

162

and the Europarl sets (the News set yields similar
results to the Europarl data).

All data sets show a dramatic increase of the
proportion of adjuncts involved in many-to-many,
and to a lesser extent one-to-one weakly equiva-
lent translations. This increase is accompanied by
a decrease of all other adjunct-pairing types (un-
aligned adjuncts excepted), and is likely to result
from increased word-alignment and parsing errors
with sentence length.

A rather surprising result is the high proportion
of divergent adjunct translations in the shorter sen-
tences of the Hansards training set; we find the
same phenomenon with the GIZA++ alignment.
We attribute this effect to the Hansards set having
less literal translations than the other sets. That
we see this effect mostly in shorter sentences may
result from translation mismatches being mostly
local. As sentence length increases however, word
and adjunct alignment errors are also likely to link
more unrelated adjuncts, resulting in a drop of di-
vergent adjuncts.

4.5 Simplifying alignments
We perform a simple experiment to test the effect
of word-alignment simplification of adjunct trans-
lation equivalence. For this we remove alignment
links between function words (as defined in sec-
tion 3) on both sides of the data, and we realign
adjuncts using these simplified alignments. Ta-
ble 9 shows that this simplification (column ‘-fw’)
slightly decreases the proportion of weakly equiv-
alent pairings with regard to the standard align-
ment (‘std’), mostly to the benefit of translation-
equivalent pairings. This suggests that further
gains may be obtained with better alignments.

5 Related work

While adjunction is a formal operation that may be
applied to non-linguistic adjuncts in STAG, De-
Neefe and Knight (2009) restrict it to syntactic
adjuncts in a Synchronous Tree Insertion Gram-
mar. They identify complements using (Collins,
2003)’s rules, and regard all other non-head con-
stituents as adjuncts. Their model is able to gen-
eralize to unseen adjunction patterns, and to beat a
string-to-tree baseline in an Arabic-English trans-
lation task.

Arnoult and Sima’an (2012) exploit adjunct op-
tionality to generate new training data for a phrase-
based model, by removing phrase pairs with an
English adjunct from the training data. They iden-
tify adjuncts using syntactic heuristics in phrase-
structure parses. They found that few of the gener-
ated phrase pairs were actually used at decoding,

figures of role preservation for different categories
of adjuncts, with lower bounds between 29% and
65% and upper bounds between 61% and 78%, in
automatically aligned Europarl data. The upper
bounds are limited by discontinuous adjunct pro-
jections, while the estimation of lower bounds is
limited by the lack of adjunct-identification means
for French.

There has been a growing body of work on ex-
ploiting semantic annotations for SMT. In many
cases, predicate-argument structures are used to
provide source-side contextual information for
lexical selection and/or reordering (Xiong et al.,
2012; Li et al., 2013), without requiring cross-
linguistic correspondence. When correspondence
between semantic roles is required, predicates are
commonly aligned first. For instance, Lo et al.
(2012) use a maximum-weighted bipartite match-
ing algorithm to align predicates with a lexical-
similarity measure to evaluate semantic-role corre-
spondence. Padó and Lapata (2009) use the same
algorithm with a similarity measure based on con-
stituent overlap to project semantic roles from En-
glish to German.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we presented the first study of trans-
lation equivalence of adjuncts on a variety of
French-English parallel corpora and word align-
ments. We use a method based on overlap to de-
rive many-to-many adjunct pairings, that are inter-
pretable in terms of translation equivalence.

We found through measurements in French-
English data sets that 40% to 50% of adjuncts–
depending on the data–are bijectively aligned
across a bitext, whereas about 25% more adjuncts
align to adjuncts, albeit not bijectively. We esti-
mate that a third of these weakly equivalent links
represent true, adjunct translation equivalences.

With manually identified adjuncts, we found
that about 70% have adjunct translation-
equivalents in automatically aligned data.
These are fairly low results if one considers that
French and English are relatively close syntacti-
cally. So while they show that adjunct labelling
accuracy on both sides of the data is crucial for
adjunct alignment, and that applications that
exploit adjunction can gain from decreasing their
dependence on word alignments and idealized
experimental conditions, they call for better
understanding of the factors behind translation

divergence.
In fact, as a remaining quarter of adjuncts have

divergent translations, it would be interesting to
determine, for instance, the degree to which diver-
gence is caused by lexical conflation, or reflects
non-literal translations.
