Abstract

Arabic morphology is complex, partly be-
cause of its richness, and partly because
of common irregular word forms, such as
broken plurals (which resemble singular
nouns), and nouns with irregular gender
(feminine nouns that look masculine and
vice versa). In addition, Arabic morpho-
syntactic agreement interacts with the lex-
ical semantic feature of rationality, which
has no morphological realization. In this
paper, we present a series of experiments
on the automatic prediction of the latent
linguistic features of functional gender and
number, and rationality in Arabic. We com-
pare two techniques, using simple maxi-
mum likelihood (MLE) with back-off and
a support vector machine based sequence
tagger (Yamcha). We study a number of
orthographic, morphological and syntactic
learning features. Our results show that
the MLE technique is preferred for words
seen in the training data, while the Yam-
cha technique is optimal for unseen words,
which are our real target. Furthermore, we
show that for unseen words, morphological
features help beyond orthographic features
and that syntactic features help even more.
A combination of the two techniques im-
proves overall performance even further.

1 Introduction

Arabic morphology is complex, partly because
of its richness, and partly because of its com-
plex morpho-syntactic agreement rules which de-
pend on functional features not necessarily ex-
pressed in word forms. Particularly challeng-
ing are broken plurals (which resemble singu-
lar nouns), nouns with irregular gender (mascu-
line nouns that look feminine and feminine nouns

that look masculine), and the semantic feature
of rationality, which has no morphological re-
alization (Smrž, 2007b; Alkuhlani and Habash,
2011). These features heavily participate in Ara-
bic morpho-syntactic agreement. Alkuhlani and
Habash (2011) show that without proper model-
ing, Arabic agreement cannot be accounted for
in about a third of all noun-adjective pairs and
a quarter of verb-subject pairs. They also report
that over half of all plurals in Arabic are irregular,
8% of nominals have irregular gender and almost
half of all proper nouns and 5% of all nouns are
rational.

In this paper, we present results on the task
of automatic identification of functional gender,
number and rationality of Arabic words in con-
text. We consider two supervised learning tech-
niques: a simple maximum-likelihood model with
back-off (MLE) and a support-vector-machine-
based sequence tagger, Yamcha (Kudo and Mat-
sumoto, 2003). We consider a large number of
orthographic, morphological and syntactic learn-
ing features. Our results show that the MLE tech-
nique is preferred for words seen in the training
data, while the Yamcha technique is optimal for
unseen words, which are our real target. Further-
more, we show that for unseen words, morpho-
logical features help beyond orthographic features
and that syntactic features help even more. A
combination of the two techniques improves over-
all performance even further.

This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tions 2 and 3 present relevant linguistic facts and
related work, respectively. Section 4 presents the
data collection we use and the metrics we target.
Section 5 discusses our approach. And Section 6
presents our results.

are only for gender and number.

2 Linguistic Facts

Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. In
addition to being both templatic (root/pattern) and
concatenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic’s op-
tional diacritics add to the degree of word ambi-
guity. We focus on two problems of Arabic mor-
phology: the discrepancy between morphological
form and function; and the complexity of morpho-
syntactic agreement rules.

2.1 Form and Function

Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and
adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: mascu-
line (M ) and feminine (F ), and for number: sin-
gular (S), dual (D) and plural (P ). These features
are regularly expressed using a set of suffixes that
uniquely convey gender and number combina-
tions: +φ (MS),

�è+ +h̄1 (FS), 	àð+ +wn (MP ),
and �H@+ +At (FP ). For example, the adjective
QëAÓ mAhr ‘clever’ has the following forms among
others: QëAÓ mAhr (MS), �èQëAÓ mAhrh̄ (FS),

1Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-
Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (in alpha-
betical order) AbtθjHxdðrzsšSDTĎςγfqklmnhwy and the ad-

ditional symbols: ’ Z, Â

@, Ǎ @, Ā

�
@, ŵ ð', ŷ Zø', h̄ �è, ý ø.

	àðQëAÓ mAhrwn (MP ), and �H@QëAÓ mAhrAt
(FP ). For a sizable minority of words, these
features are expressed templatically, i.e., through
pattern change, coupled with some singular suf-
fix. A typical example of this phenomenon is the
class of broken plurals, which accounts for over
half of all plurals (Alkuhlani and Habash, 2011).
In such cases, the form of the morphology (sin-
gular suffix) is inconsistent with the word’s func-
tional number (plural). For example, the word
I. �KA¿ kAtb (MS) ‘writer’ has the broken plural:
H. A

��J» ktAb ( MS
MP

).2 See the second word in the ex-

ample in Figure 1, which is the word H. A
��J» ktAb

‘writers’ prefixed with the definite article Al+. In
addition to broken plurals, Arabic has words with
irregular gender, e.g., the feminine singular ad-
jective ‘red’ Z @QÔg HmrA’ (MS

FS
), and the nouns

�é 	®J
Ê 	g xlyfh̄ ( FSMS ) ‘caliph’ and ÉÓAg HAml (MSFS )
‘pregnant’. Verbs and nominal duals do not dis-
play this discrepancy.

2.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement

Arabic gender and number features participate in

structions such as nouns with their adjectives
and verbs with their subjects. Arabic agreement
rules are more complex than the simple match-
ing rules found in languages such as Spanish
(Holes, 2004; Habash, 2010). For instance, Ara-
bic adjectives agree with the nouns they mod-
ify in gender and number except for plural ir-
rational (non-human) nouns, which always take
feminine singular adjectives. Rationality (‘hu-
manness’ ‘É�̄A« Q�


	«/É�̄A«’) is a morpho-lexical
feature that is narrower than animacy. English
expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she vs. it)
and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows
which...). We follow the convention by Alkuh-
lani and Habash (2011) who specify rationality
as part of the functional features of the word.
The values of this feature are: rational (R), irra-
tional (I), and not-specified (N ). N is assigned to
verbs, adjectives, numbers and quantifiers.3 For
example, in Figure 1, the plural rational noun

3 Related Work

Much work has been done on Arabic morpholog-
ical analysis, morphological disambiguation and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Al-Sughaiyer and
Al-Kharashi, 2004; Soudi et al., 2007; Habash,
2010). The bulk of this work does not address
form-function discrepancy or morpho-syntactic
agreement issues. This includes the most com-
monly used resources and tools for Arabic NLP:
the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer
(BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) which is used in the
Penn Arabic Tree Bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al.,
2004), and the various POS tagging and morpho-
logical disambiguation tools trained using them
(Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005).
There are some important exceptions (Goweder et
al., 2004; Habash, 2004; Smrž, 2007b; Elghamry
et al., 2008; Abbès et al., 2004; Attia, 2008;

3We previously defined the rationality value N as not-
applicable when we only considered nominals (Alkuhlani
and Habash, 2011). In this work, we rename the rationality
value N as not-specified without changing its meaning. We
use the value Na (not-applicable) for parts-of-speech that
do not have a meaningful value for any feature, e.g., prepo-
sitions have gender, number and rationality values of Na.

Altantawy et al., 2010; Alkuhlani and Habash,
2011).

In terms of resources, Smrž (2007b)’s work
contrasting illusory (form) features and functional
features inspired our distinction of morphologi-
cal form and function. However, unlike him, we
do not distinguish between sub-functional (logi-
cal and formal) features. His ElixirFM analyzer
(Smrž, 2007a) extends BAMA by including func-
tional number and some functional gender infor-
mation, but not rationality. This analyzer was
used as part of the annotation of the Prague Ara-
bic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and Ha-
jič, 2006). More recently, Alkuhlani and Habash
(2011) built on the work of Smrž (2007b) and ex-
tended beyond it to fully annotate functional gen-
der, number and rationality in the PATB part 3.
We use their resource to train and evaluate our
system.

In terms of techniques, Goweder et al. (2004)
investigated several approaches using root and
pattern morphology for identifying broken plu-
rals in undiacritized Arabic text. Their effort re-
sulted in an improved stemming system for Ara-
bic information retrieval that collapses singulars
and plurals. They report results on identifying
broken plurals out of context. Similar to them,
we undertake the task of identifying broken plu-
rals; however, we also target the templatic gen-
der and rationality features, and we do this in-
context. Elghamry et al. (2008) presented an auto-
matic cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and
monolingual cues to build a web-extracted lexi-
con enriched with gender, number and rationality
features. Their automatic technique achieves an
F-score of 89.7% against a gold standard set. Un-
like them, we use a manually annotated corpus to
train and test the prediction of gender, number and
rationality features.

Our approach to identifying these features ex-
plores a large set of orthographic, morphological
and syntactic learning features. This is very much
following several previous efforts in Arabic NLP
in which different tagsets and morphological fea-
tures have been studied for a variety of purposes,
e.g., base phrase chunking (Diab, 2007) and de-
pendency parsing (Marton et al., 2010). In this
paper we use the parser of Marton et al. (2010)
as our source of syntactic learning features. We
follow their splits for training, development and
testing.

4 Problem Definition

Our goal is to predict the functional gender, num-
ber and rationality features for all words.

4.1 Corpus and Experimental Settings

We use the corpus of Alkuhlani and Habash
(2011), which is based on the PATB. The corpus
contains around 16.6K sentences and over 400K
tokens. We use the train/development/test splits
of Marton et al. (2010). We train on a quarter of
the training set and classify words in sequence.
We only use a portion of the training data to in-
crease the percentage of words unseen in training.
We also compare to using all of the training data
in Section 6.7.

Our data is gold tokenized; however, all of
the features we use are predicted using MADA
(Habash and Rambow, 2005) following the work
of Marton et al. (2010). Words whose tags are un-
known in the training set are excluded from the
evaluation, but not training. In terms of ambigu-
ity, the percentage of word types with ambiguous
gender, number and rationality in the train set is
1.35%, 0.79%, and 4.8% respectively. These per-
centages are consistent with how we perform on
these features, with number being the easiest and
rationality the hardest.

4.2 Metrics

We report all results in terms of token accuracy.
Evaluation is done for the following sets: all
words, seen words, and unseen words. A word is
considered seen if it is in the training data regard-
less of whether it appears with the same lemma
and POS tag or not. Defining seen words this way
makes the decision on whether a word is seen or
unseen unaffected by lemma and/or POS predic-
tion errors in the development and test sets. Us-
ing our definition of seen words, 34.3% of words
types (and 10.2% of word tokens) in the devel-
opment set have not been seen in quarter of the
training set.

We train single classifiers for G (gender), N
(number), R (rationality), GN and GNR, and eval-
uate them. We also combine the tags of the sin-
gle classifiers into larger tags (G+N, GN+R and
G+N+R).

5 Approach

Our approach involves using two techniques:
MLE with back-off and Yamcha. For each tech-
nique, we explore the effects of different learning
features and try to come up with the best tech-
nique and feature set for each target feature.

5.1 Learning Features

We investigate the contribution of different learn-
ing features in predicting functional gender, num-
ber and rationality features. The learning features
are explored in the following order:

Orthographic Features These features are or-
ganized in two sets: W1 is the unnormalized form
of the word, and W2 includes W1 plus letter n-
grams. The n-grams used are the first letter, first
two letters, last letter, and last two letters of the
word form. We tried using the Alif/Ya normalized
forms of the words (Habash, 2010), but these be-
haved consistently worse than the unnormalized
forms.

Morphological Features We explore the fol-
lowing morphological features inspired by the
work of Marton et al. (2010):

• POS tags. We experiment with different POS
tag sets: CATiB-6 (6 tags) (Habash et al., 2009),
CATiB-EX (44 tags), Kulick (34 tags) (Kulick et
al., 2006), Buckwalter (BW) (Buckwalter, 2004),
which is the tag used in the PATB (430 tags),
and a reduced form of BW tag that ignores case
and mood (BW-) (217 tags). These tags differ in
their granularity and range from very specific tags
(Buckwalter) to more general tags (CATiB).

• Lemma. We use the diacritized lemma
(Lemma), and the normalized and undiacritized
form of the lemma, the LMM (LMM).

• Form-based features. Form-based features
(F) are extracted from the word form and do not
necessarily reflect functional features. These fea-
tures are form-based gender, form-based number,
person and the definite article.

Syntactic Features We use the following syn-
tactic features (SYN) derived from the CATiB de-
pendency version of the PATB (Habash and Roth,
2009): parent, dependency relation, order of ap-
pearance (the word comes before or after its par-
ent), the distance between the word and its parent,
and the parent’s orthographic and morphological
features.

678



For all of these features, we train on gold val-
ues, but only experiment with predicted values in
the development and test sets. For predicting mor-
phological features, we use the MADA system
(Habash and Rambow, 2005). The MADA sys-
tem corrects for suboptimal orthographic choices
and effectively produces a consistent and unnor-
malized orthography. For the syntactic features,
we use Marton et al. (2010)’s system.

5.2 Techniques

We describe below the two techniques we ex-
plored.

MLE with Back-off We implemented an MLE
system with multiple back-off modes using our
set of linguistic features. The order of the back-off
is from specific to general. We start with an MLE
system that uses only the word form, and backs
off to the most common feature value across all
words (excluding unknown and Na values). This
simple MLE system is used as a baseline.

As we add more features to the MLE system,
it tries to match all these features to predict the
value for a given word. If such a combination of
features is not seen in the training set, the sys-
tem backs off to a more general combination of
features. For example, if an MLE system is us-
ing the features W2+LMM+BW, the system tries
to match this combination. If it is not seen in
training, the system backs off to the following set:
LMM+BW, and tries to return the most common
value for this POS tag and lemma combination. If
again it fails to find a match, it backs off to BW,
and returns the most common value for that par-
ticular POS tag. If no word is seen with this POS
tag, the system returns the most common value
across all words.

Yamcha Sequence Tagger We use Yamcha
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003), a support-vector-
machine-based sequence tagger. We perform dif-
ferent experiments with the different sets of fea-
tures presented above. After that, we apply a
consistency filter that ensures that every word-
lemma-pos combination always gets the same
value for gender, number and rationality features.
Yamcha in its default settings tags words using a
window of two words before and two words af-
ter the word being tagged. This gives Yamcha an
advantage over the MLE system which tags each
word independently.

Single vs Joint Classification In this paper, we
only discuss systems trained for a single classifier
(for gender, for number and for rationality). In
experiments we have done, we found that training
single classifiers and combining their outcomes
almost always outperforms a single joint classi-
fier for the three target features. In other words,
combining the results of G and N (G+N) outper-
forms the results of the single classifier GN. The
same is also true for G+N+R, which outperforms
GNR and GN+R. Therefore, we only present the
results for the single classifiers G, N, R and their
combination G+N+R.

6 Results

We perform a series of experiments increasing in
feature complexity. We greedily select which fea-
tures to pass on to the next level of experiments.
In cases of ties, we pass the top two performers
to the next step. We discuss each of these exper-
iments next for both the MLE and Yamcha tech-
niques. Statistical significance is measured using
the McNemar test of statistical significance (Mc-
Nemar, 1947).

6.1 Experiment Set I: Orthographic
Features

The first set of experiments uses the orthographic
features. See Table 1. The MLE system with the
word only feature (W1) is effectively our base-
line. It does surprisingly well for seen cases. In
fact it is the highest performer across all exper-
iments in this paper for seen cases. For unseen
cases, it produces a miserable and expected low
score of 21.0% accuracy. The addition of the n-
gram features (W2) improves statistically signif-
icantly over W1 for unseen cases, but it is indis-
tinguishable for seen cases. The Yamcha system
shows the same difference in results between W1
and W2.

Across the two sets of features, the MLE sys-
tem consistently outperforms Yamcha in the case
of seen words, while Yamcha does better for un-
seen words. This can be explained by the fact that
the MLE system matches only on the word form
and if the word is unseen, it backs off to the most
common value across all words. Moreover, Yam-
cha uses some limited context information that al-
lows it to generalize for unseen words.

Among the target features, number is the easi-
est to predict, while rationality is the hardest.

Table 2: Experiment Set II.a: Morphological features: (i) form-based gender and number, (ii) lemma and LMM
(undiacritized lemma) and (iii) a variety of POS tag sets. For each subset, the best performers are bolded.

6.2 Experiment Set II: Morphological
Features

Individual Morphological Features In this set
of experiments, we use our best system from the
previous set, W2, and add individual morpholog-
ical features to it. We organize these features in
three sub-groups: (i) form-based features (F), (ii)
lemma and LMM, and (iii) the five POS tag sets.
See Table 2.

The F, Lemma and LMM improve over the
baseline in terms of unseen words for both MLE
and Yamcha techniques. However, for seen
words, these systems do worse than or equal to the
baseline when the MLE technique is used. The
MLE system in these cases tries to match the word
and its morphological features as a single unit and
if such a combination is not seen, it backs off to
the morphological feature which is more general.
Since we are using predicted data, prediction er-
rors could be the reason behind this decrease in
accuracy for seen words. Among these systems,
W2+F is the best for both Yamcha and MLE ex-
cept for rationality which is expected since there
are no form-based features for rationality. In this
set of experiments, Yamcha consistently outper-
forms MLE when it comes to unseen words, but
for seen words, MLE does better almost always.
LMM overall does better than Lemma. This is

reasonable given that LMM is easier to predict;
although LMM is more ambiguous.

As for the POS tag sets, looking at the MLE
results, CATIB-EX is the best performer for seen
words, and BW- is the best for unseen. CATIB-6
is a general POS tag set and since the MLE tech-
nique is very strict in its matching process (an ex-
act match or no match), using a general key to
match on adds a lot of ambiguity. With Yamcha,
BW and BW- are the best among all POS. Yamcha
is still doing consistently better in terms of unseen
words. The best two systems from both Yamcha
and MLE are used as the basic systems for the
next subset of experiments where we combine the
morphological features.

Combined Morphological Features Until this
point, all experiments using the two techniques
are similar. In this subset, MLE explores the ef-
fect of using the CATIB-EX and BW- with other
morphological features. And Yamcha explores
the effect of using BW- and BW with other mor-
phological features. See Table 3. Again, Yamcha
is still doing consistently better in terms of unseen
words, but when it comes to seen words, MLE
performs better. For seen words, our best results
come from MLE using CATIB-EX and LMM. For
unseen words, our best results come from Yam-
cha with the BW- tag and the form-based features

Table 4: Experiment Set III: Syntactic features.

for both gender and number. For rationality, the
best features to use with Yamcha are BW, LMM
and form-based features. The lemma seems to ac-
tually hurt when predicting gender and number.
This can be explained by the fact that gender and
number features are often properties of the word
form and not of the lemma. This is different for
rationality, which is a property of the lemma and
therefore, we expect the lemma to help.

The fact that the predicted BW set helps is not
consistent with previous work by Marton et al.
(2010). In that effort, BW helps parsing only in
the gold condition. BW prediction accuracy is
low because it includes case endings. We pos-
tulate that perhaps in our task, which is far more
limited than general parsing, errors in case pre-
diction may not matter too much. The more com-
plex tag set may actually help establish good lo-
cal agreement sequences (even if incorrect case-
wise), which is relevant to the target features.

6.3 Experiment Set III: Syntactic Features

This set of experiments adds syntactic features
to the experiments in set II. We add syntax to
the systems that uses Yamcha only since it is
not obvious how to add syntactic information to
the MLE system. Syntax improves the predic-
tion accuracy for unseen words but not for seen

words. In Yamcha, we can argue that the +/-2
word window allows some form of shallow syn-
tax modeling, which is why Yamcha is doing bet-
ter from the start. But the longer distance features
are helping even more, perhaps because they cap-
ture agreement relations. The overall best system
for unseen words is W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN,
except for number, where W2+BW-+F+SYN
is slightly better. In terms of G+N+R
scores, W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN is statistically
significantly better than all other systems in
this set for seen and unseen words, ex-
cept for unseen words with W2+BW+F+SYN.
W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN is also statistically sig-
nificantly better than its non-syntactic variant for
both seen and unseen words. The prediction ac-
curacy for seen words is still not as good as the
MLE systems.

6.4 System Combination

The simple MLE W1 system, which happens to be
the baseline, is the best predictor for seen words,
and the more advanced Yamcha system using syn-
tactic features is the best predictor for unseen
words. Next, we create a new system that takes
advantage of the two systems. We use the sim-
ple MLE W1 system for seen words, and Yam-
cha with syntax for unseen words. For unseen

681



words, since each target feature has its own set of
best learning features, we also build a combina-
tion system that uses the best systems for gender,
number and rationality and combine their output
into a single system for unseen words. For gender
and rationality, we use W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN,
and for number, we use W2+BW-+F+SYN. As
expected the combination system outperforms the
basic systems. For comparison: The MLE W1
system gets an (all, seen, unseen) scores of (89.3,
97.0, 21.0) for G+N+R, while the best single
Yamcha syntactic system gets (92.0, 93.8, 76.2);
the combination on the other hand gets (94.9,
97.0, 76.2). The overall (all) improvement over
the MLE baseline or the best Yamcha translates
into 52% error reduction or 36% error reduction,
respectively.

6.5 Error Analysis

We conducted an analysis of the errors in the out-
put of the combination system as well as the two
systems that contributed to it.

In the combination system, out of the total er-
ror in G+N+R (5.1%), 53% of the cases are for
seen words (3.0% of all seen) and 47% for unseen
words (23.8% of all unseen). Overall, rational-
ity errors are the biggest contributor to G+N+R
error at 73% relative, followed by gender (33%
relative) and number (26% relative). Among er-
ror cases of seen words, rationality errors soar to
87% relative, almost four times the corresponding
gender and number errors (27% and 22%, respec-
tively). However, among error cases of unseen
words, rationality errors are 57% relative, while
gender and number corresponding errors are (39%
and 31%, respectively). As expected, rational-
ity is much harder to tag than gender and number
due to its higher word-form ambiguity and depen-
dence on context.

We classified the type of errors in the MLE sys-
tem for seen words, which we use in the combi-
nation system. We found that 86% of the G+N+R
errors involve an ambiguity in the training data
where the correct answer was present but not cho-
sen. This is an expected limitation of the MLE ap-
proach. In the rest of the cases, the correct answer
was not actually present in the training data. The
proportion of ambiguity errors is almost identical
for gender, number and rationality. However ra-
tionality overall is the biggest cause of error, sim-
ply due to its higher degree of ambiguity.

All seen unseen
MLE W1 88.5 96.8 21.2
Yamcha BW+LMM+F 91.4 94.1 70.4
Yamcha BW+LMM+F+SYN 91.0 93.3 72.2
Combination 94.1 96.8 72.4

Table 5: Results on blind test. Scores for
All/Seen/Unseen are shown for the G+N+R condition.
We compare the MLE word baseline, with the best
Yamcha system with and without syntactic features
and the combined system.

Since the Yamcha system uses MADA features,
we investigated the effect of the correctness of
MADA features on the system prediction accu-
racy. The overall MADA accuracy in identifying
the lemma and the Buckwalter tag together – a
very harsh measure – is 77.0% (79.3% for seen
and 56.8% for unseen). Our error analysis shows
that when MADA is correct, the prediction ac-
curacy for G+N+R is 95.6%, 96.5% and 84.4%
for all, seen and unseen, respectively. However,
this accuracy goes down to 79.2%, 82.5% and
65.5% for all, seen and unseen, respectively, when
MADA is wrong. This suggests that the Yam-
cha system suffers when MADA makes wrong
choices and improving MADA would lead to im-
provement in the system’s performance.

6.6 Blind Test

Finally, we apply our baseline, best combination
model and best single Yamcha syntactic model
(with and without syntax) to the blind test set.
The results are in Table 5. The results in the blind
test are consistent with the development set. The
MLE baseline is best on seen words, Yamcha is
best on unseen words, syntactic features help in
handling unseen words, and overall combination
improves over all specific systems.

6.7 Additional Training Data

After experimenting on quarter of the train set to
optimize for various settings, we train our com-
bination system on the full train set and achieve
(96.0, 96.8, 74.9) for G+N+R (all, seen, unseen)
on the development set and (96.5, 96.8, 65.6)
on the blind test set. As expected, the overall
(all) scores are higher simply due to the addi-
tional training data. The results on seen and un-
seen words, which are redefined against the larger
training set, are not higher than results for the
quarter training data. Of course, these numbers

682



should not be compared directly. The number of
unseen word tokens in the full train set is 3.7%
compared to 10.2% in quarter of the train set.

6.8 Comparison with MADA

We compare our results with the form-based
features from the state-of-the-art morphological
analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
We use the form-based gender and number fea-
tures produced by MADA after we filter MADA
choices by tokenization. Since MADA does not
give a rationality value, we assign the value I (ir-
rational) to nouns and proper nouns and the value
N (not-specified) to verbs and adjectives. Every-
thing else receives Na (not-applicable). The POS
tags are determined by MADA.

On the development set, MADA achieves
(72.6, 73.1, 58.6) for G+N+R (all, seen, unseen),
where the seen/unseen distinction is based on the
full training set in the previous section and is pro-
vided for comparison reasons only. The results for
the test set are (71.4, 72.2, 53.7). These results are
consistent with our expectation that MADA will
do badly on this task since it is not designed for
it (Alkuhlani and Habash, 2011). We should re-
mind the reader that MADA-derived features are
used as machine learning features in this paper,
where they actually help. In the future, we plan to
integrate this task inside of MADA.

6.9 Extrinsic Evaluation

We use the predicted gender, number and rational-
ity features that we get from training on the full
train set in a dependency syntactic parsing exper-
iment. The parsing feature set we use is the best
performing feature set described in (Marton et al.,
2011), which used an earlier unpublished version
of our MLE model. The parser we use is the Easy-
First Parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010). More
details on this parsing experiment is in Marton et
al. (2012).

The functional gender and number features in-
crease the labeled attachment score by 0.4% abso-
lute over a comparable model that uses the form-
based gender and number features. Rationality on
the other hand does not help much. One possible
reason for this is the lower quality of the predicted
rationality feature compared to the other features.
Another possible reason is that the rationality fea-
ture is not utilized optimally in the parser.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a series of experiments for auto-
matic prediction of the latent features of func-
tional gender and number, and rationality in Ara-
bic. We compared two techniques, a simple MLE
with back-off and an SVM-based sequence tag-
ger, Yamcha, using a number of orthographic,
morphological and syntactic features. Our con-
clusions are that for words seen in training, the
MLE model does best; for unseen word, Yamcha
does best; and most interestingly, we found that
syntactic features help the prediction for unseen
words.

In the future, we plan to explore training on pre-
dicted features instead of gold features to mini-
mize the effect of tagger errors. Furthermore, we
plan to use our tools to collect vocabulary not cov-
ered by commonly used morphological analyzers
and try to assign them correct functional features.
Finally, we would like to use our predictions for
gender, number and rationality as learning fea-
tures for relevant NLP applications such as senti-
ment analysis, phrase-based chunking and named
entity recognition.
