Abstract

Resource scarcity along with diversity–
both in dialect and script–are the two pri-
mary challenges in Kurdish language pro-
cessing. In this paper we aim at addressing
these two problems by (i) building a text
corpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the two
main dialects of Kurdish, and (ii) high-
lighting some of the orthographic, phono-
logical, and morphological differences be-
tween these two dialects from statistical
and rule-based perspectives.

1 Introduction

Despite having 20 to 30 millions of native speak-
ers (Haig and Matras, 2002; Hassanpour et al.,
2012; Thackston, 2006b; Thackston, 2006a), Kur-
dish is among the less-resourced languages for
which the only linguistic resource available on the
Web is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010).

Apart from the resource-scarcity problem, its
diversity –in both dialect and writing systems–
is another primary challenge in Kurdish language
processing (Gautier, 1998; Gautier, 1996; Esmaili,
2012). In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standard
language (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012):
the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based al-
phabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latin-
based alphabet. The features distinguishing these
two dialects are phonological, lexical, and mor-
phological.

In this paper we report on the first outcomes of
a project1 at University of Kurdistan (UoK) that
aims at addressing these two challenges of the
Kurdish language processing. More specifically,
in this paper:

1. we report on the construction of the first
relatively-large and publicly-available text
corpus for the Kurdish language,

1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm

2. we present some insights into the ortho-
graphic, phonological, and morphological
differences between Sorani Kurdish and Kur-
manji Kurdish.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we first briefly introduce the Kurdish
language and its two main dialects then underline
their differences from a rule-based (a.k.a. corpus-
independent) perspective. Next, after presenting
the Pewan text corpus in Section 3, we use it to
conduct a statistical comparison of the two dialects
in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5.

2 The Kurdish Language and Dialects

Kurdish belongs to the Indo-Iranian family of
Indo-European languages. Its closest better-
known relative is Persian. Kurdish is spoken in
Kurdistan, a large geographical area spanning the
intersections of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. It is
one of the two official languages of Iraq and has a
regional status in Iran.

Kurdish is a dialect-rich language, sometimes
referred to as a dialect continuum (Matras and
Akin, 2012; Shahsavari, 2010). In this paper,
however, we focus on Sorani and Kurmanji which
are the two closely-related and widely-spoken di-
alects of the Kurdish language. Together, they ac-
count for more than 75% of native Kurdish speak-
ers (Walther and Sagot, 2010).

As summarized below, these two dialects differ
not only in some linguistics aspects, but also in
their writing systems.

2.1 Morphological Differences
The important morphological differences
are (MacKenzie, 1961; Haig and Matras,
2002; Samvelian, 2007):

1. Kurmanji is more conservative in retaining
both gender (feminine:masculine) and case
opposition (absolute:oblique) for nouns and

pronouns2. Sorani has largely abandoned this
system and uses the pronominal suffixes to
take over the functions of the cases,

2. in the past-tense transitive verbs, Kurmanji
has the full ergative alignment3 but Sorani,
having lost the oblique pronouns, resorts to
pronominal enclitics,

3. in Sorani, passive and causative are created
via verb morphology, in Kurmanji they can
also be formed with the helper verbs hatin
(“to come”) and dan (“to give”) respectively,
and

4. the definite marker -aka appears only in So-
rani.

2.2 Scriptural Differences
Due to geopolitical reasons (Matras and Reer-
shemius, 1991), each of the two dialects has been
using its own writing system: while Sorani uses
an Arabic-based alphabet, Kurmanji is written in a
Latin-based one.

Figure 1 shows the two standard alphabets and
the mappings between them which we have cate-
gorized into three classes:

• one-to-one mappings (Figure 1a), which
cover a large subset of the characters,

• one-to-two mappings (Figure 1b); they re-
flect the inherent ambiguities between the
two writing systems (Barkhoda et al., 2009).
While transliterating between these two al-
phabets, the contextual information can pro-
vide hints in choosing the right counterpart.

2Although there is evidence of gender distinctions weak-
ening in some varieties of Kurmanji (Haig and Matras, 2002).

3Recent research suggests that ergativity in Kurmanji is
weakening due to either internally-induced change or contact
with Turkish (Dixon, 1994; Dorleijn, 1996; Mahalingappa,
2010), perhaps moving towards a full nominative-accusative
system.

• one-to-zero mappings (Figure 1c); they can
be further split into two distinct subcate-
gories: (i) the strong L and strong R char-
acters ({ } and { }) are used only in Sorani
Kurdish4 and demonstrate some of the inher-
ent phonological differences between Sorani
and Kurmanji, and (ii) the remaining three
characters are primarily used in the Arabic
loanwords in Sorani (in Kurmanji they are
approximated with other characters).

It should be noted that both of these writing sys-
tems are phonetic (Gautier, 1998); that is, vowels
are explicitly represented and their use is manda-
tory.

3 The Pewan Corpus

Text corpora are essential to Computational Lin-
guistics and Natural Language Processing. In spite
the few attempts to build corpus (Gautier, 1998)
and lexicon (Walther and Sagot, 2010), Kurdish
still does not have any large-scale and reliable gen-
eral or domain-specific corpus.

At UoK, we followed TREC (TREC, 2013)’s
common practice and used news articles to build
a text corpus for the Kurdish language. After sur-
veying a range of options we chose two online
news agencies: (i) Peyamner (Peyamner, 2013), a
popular multi-lingual news agency based in Iraqi
Kurdistan, and (ii) the Sorani (VOA, 2013b) and
the Kurmanji (VOA, 2013a) websites of Voice Of
America. Our main selection criteria were: (i)
number of articles, (ii) subject diversity, and (iii)
crawl-friendliness.

For each agency, we developed a crawler to
fetch the articles and extract their textual content.
In case of Peyamner, since articles have no lan-
guage label, we additionally implemented a sim-
ple classifier that decides each page’s language

4Although there are a handful of words with the latter in
Kurmanji too.

based on the occurrence of language-specific char-

Overall, 115,340 Sorani articles and 25,572
Kurmanji articles were collected5 . The articles
are dated between 2003 and 2012 and their sizes
range from 1KB to 154KB (on average 2.6KB).
Table 1 summarizes the important properties of
our corpus which we named Pewan –a Kurdish
word meaning “measurement.”

Using Pewan and similar to the approach em-
ployed in (Savoy, 1999), we also built a list of
Kurdish stopwords. To this end, we manually ex-
amined the top 300 frequent words of each di-
alect and removed the corpus-specific biases (e.g.,
“Iraq”, “Kurdistan”, “Regional”, “Government”,
“Reported” and etc). The final Sorani and Kur-
manji lists contain 157 and 152 words respec-
tively, and as in other languages, they mainly con-
sist of prepositions.

Pewan, as well as the stopword lists can be ob-
tained from (Pewan, 2013). We hope that making
these resources publicly available, will bolster fur-
ther research on Kurdish language.

4 Empirical Study

In the first part of this section, we first look at the
character and word frequencies and try to obtain
some insights about the phonological and lexical
correlations and discrepancies between Sorani and
Kurmanji.

In the second part, we investigate two well-
known linguistic laws –Heaps’ and Zipf’s. Al-
though these laws have been observed in many
of the Indo-European languages (Lü et al., 2013),
the their coefficients depend on language (Gel-
bukh and Sidorov, 2001) and therefore they can be

5The relatively small size of the Kurmanji collection is
part of a more general trend. In fact, despite having a larger
number of speakers, Kurmanji has far fewer online sources
with raw text readily available and even those sources do not
strictly follow its writing standards. This is partly a result of
decades of severe restrictions on use of Kurdish language in
Turkey, where the majority of Kurmanji speakers live (Has-
sanpour et al., 2012).

used a tool to measure similarity/dissimilarity of
languages. It should also be noted that in practice,
knowing the coefficients of these laws is important
in, for example, full-text database design, since it
allows predicting some properties of the index as
a function of the size of the database.

4.1 Character Frequencies
In this experiment we measure the character fre-
quencies, as a phonological property of the lan-
guage. Figure 2 shows the frequency-ranked lists
(from left to right, in decreasing order) of charac-
ters of both dialects in the Pewan corpus. Note that
for a fairer comparison, we have excluded charac-
ters with 1-to-0 and 1-to-2 mappings as well as
three characters from the list of 1-to-1 mappings:
A, Ê, and Û. The first two have a skewed frequency
due to their role as Izafe construction6 marker. The
third one is mapped to a double-character ( ) in
the Sorani alphabet.

Overall, the relative positions of the equivalent
characters in these two lists are comparable (Fig-
ure 2). However, there are two notable discrepan-
cies which further exhibit the intrinsic phonologi-
cal differences between Sorani and Kurmanji:

• use of the character J is far more common
in Kurmanji (e.g., in prepositions such as ji
“from” and jı̂ “too”),

• same holds for the character V; this is, how-
6Izafe construction is a shared feature of several West-

ern Iranian languages (Samvelian, 2006). It, approximately,
corresponds to the English preposition “of ” and is added be-
tween prepositions, nouns and adjectives in a phrase (Shams-
fard, 2011).

ever, due to Sorani’s phonological tendency
to use the phoneme W instead of V.

4.2 Word Frequencies
Figure 3 shows the most frequent Sorani and Kur-
manji words in the Pewan corpus. This figure
also contains the links between the words that are
transliteration-equivalent and again shows a high
level of correlation between the two dialects. A
thorough examination of the longer version of the
frequent terms’ lists, not only further confirms this
correlation but also reveals some other notable pat-
terns:

• the Sorani generic preposition (“from”) has
a very wide range of use; in fact, as shown in
Figure 3, it is the semantic equivalent of three
common Kurmanji prepositions (li, ji, and
di),

• in Sorani, a number of the common prepo-
sitions (e.g., “too”) as well as the verb

“to be” are used as suffix,

• in Kurmanji, some of the most common
prepositions are paired with a postposition
(mostly da, de, and ve) and form circum-
positions,

• the Kurmanji’s passive/accusative helper
verbs (hatin and dan) are among its most
frequently used words.

4.3 Heaps’ Law
Heaps’s law (Heaps, 1978) is about the growth
of distinct words (a.k.a vocabulary size). More
specifically, the number of distinct words in a text
is roughly proportional to an exponent of its size:

log ni ≈ D + h log i (1)

Language log ni h
Sorani 1.91 + 0.78 log i 0.78
Kurmanji 2.15 + 0.74 log i 0.74
Persian 2.66 + 0.70 log i 0.70
English 2.68 + 0.69 log i 0.69

Table 2: Heaps’ Linear Regression

where ni is the number of distinct words occur-
ring before the running word number i, h is the
exponent coefficient (between 0 and 1), and D is
a constant. In a logarithmic scale, it is a straight
line with about 45◦ angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov,
2001).

We carried out an experiment to measure the
growth rate of distinct words for both of the Kur-
dish dialects as well as the Persian and English
languages. In this experiment, the Persian cor-
pus was drawn from the standard Hamshahri Col-
lection (AleAhmad et al., 2009) and The English
corpus consisted of the Editorial articles of The
Guardian newspaper7 (Guardian, 2013).

As the curves in Figure 4 and the linear re-
gression coefficients in Table 2 show, the growth
rate of distinct words in both Sorani and Kur-
manji Kurdish are higher than Persian and English.
This result demonstrates the morphological com-
plexity of the Kurdish language (Samvelian, 2007;
Walther, 2011). One of the driving factors be-
hind this complexity, is the wide use of suffixes,
most notably as: (i) the Izafe construction marker,
(ii) the plural noun marker, and (iii) the indefinite
marker.

Another important observation from this exper-
iment is that Sorani has a higher growth rate com-
pared to Kurmanji (h = 0.78 vs. h = 0.74).

spectrum of topics between 2006 and 2013, and have clean
HTML sources.

Language log fr z

Kurmanji 6.48− 1.31 log r 1.31
Persian 9.57− 1.51 log r 1.51
English 9.37− 1.85 log r 1.85

Table 3: Zipf’s Linear Regression

Two primary sources of these differences are: (i)
the inherent linguistic differences between the two
dialects as mentioned earlier (especially, Sorani’s
exclusive use of definite marker), (ii) the general
tendency in Sorani to use prepositions and helper
verbs as suffix.

4.4 Zipf’s Law

The Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949) states that in any
large-enough text, the frequency ranks of the
words are inversely proportional to the corre-
sponding frequencies:

log fr ≈ C − z log r (2)

where fr is the frequency of the word having the
rank r, z is the exponent coefficient, and C is a
constant. In a logarithmic scale, it is a straight
line with about 45◦ angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov,
2001).

The results of our experiment–plotted curves in
Figure 5 and linear regression coefficients in Ta-
ble 3– show that: (i) the distribution of the top
most frequent words in Sorani is uniquely differ-
ent; it first shows a sharper drop in the top 10
words and then a slower drop for the words ranked
between 10 and 100, and (ii) in the remaining parts
of the curves, both Kurmanji and Sorani behave
similarly; this is also reflected in their values of
coefficient z (1.33 and 1.31).

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we took the first steps towards ad-
dressing the two main challenges in Kurdish lan-
guage processing, namely, resource scarcity and
diversity. We presented Pewan, a text corpus for
Sorani and Kurmanji, the two principal dialects of
the Kurdish language. We also highlighted a range
of differences between these two dialects and their
writing systems.

The main findings of our analysis can be sum-
marized as follows: (i) there are phonological
differences between Sorani and Kurmanji; while
some phonemes are non-existent in Kurmanji,
some others are less-common in Sorani, (ii) they
differ considerably in their vocabulary growth
rates, (iii) Sorani has a peculiar frequency distribu-
tion w.r.t. its highly-common words. Some of the
discrepancies are due to the existence of a generic
preposition ( ) in Sorani, as well as the general
tendency in its writing system and style to use
prepositions as suffix.

Our project at UoK is a work in progress. Re-
cently, we have used the Pewan corpus to build
a test collection to evaluate Kurdish Information
Retrieval systems (Esmaili et al., 2013). In future,
we plan to first develop stemming algorithms for
both Sorani and Kurmanji and then leverage those
algorithms to examine the lexical differences be-
tween the two dialects. Another avenue for future
work is to build a transliteration/translation engine
between Sorani and Kurmanji.
