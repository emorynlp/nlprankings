Abstract

While modern machine translation has relied
on large parallel corpora, a recent line of work
has managed to train Neural Machine Trans-
lation (NMT) systems from monolingual cor-
pora only (Artetxe et al., 2018c; Lample et al.,
2018). Despite the potential of this approach
for low-resource settings, existing systems are
far behind their supervised counterparts, lim-
iting their practical interest. In this paper,
we propose an alternative approach based on
phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) that significantly closes the gap with
supervised systems. Our method profits from
the modular architecture of SMT: we first in-
duce a phrase table from monolingual cor-
pora through cross-lingual embedding map-
pings, combine it with an n-gram language
model, and fine-tune hyperparameters through
an unsupervised MERT variant. In addition,
iterative backtranslation improves results fur-
ther, yielding, for instance, 14.08 and 26.22
BLEU points in WMT 2014 English-German
and English-French, respectively, an improve-
ment of more than 7-10 BLEU points over pre-
vious unsupervised systems, and closing the
gap with supervised SMT (Moses trained on
Europarl) down to 2-5 BLEU points. Our
implementation is available at https://

1 Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has recently
become the dominant paradigm in machine trans-
lation (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to more
rigid Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) archi-
tectures (Koehn et al., 2003), NMT models are
trained end-to-end, exploit continuous representa-
tions that mitigate the sparsity problem, and over-
come the locality problem by making use of un-
constrained contexts. Thanks to this additional
flexibility, NMT can more effectively exploit large

parallel corpora, although SMT is still superior
when the training corpus is not big enough (Koehn
and Knowles, 2017).

Somewhat paradoxically, while most machine
translation research has focused on resource-rich
settings where NMT has indeed superseded SMT,
a recent line of work has managed to train an NMT
system without any supervision, relying on mono-
lingual corpora alone (Artetxe et al., 2018c; Lam-
ple et al., 2018). Given the scarcity of parallel
corpora for most language pairs, including less-
resourced languages but also many combinations
of major languages, this research line opens excit-
ing opportunities to bring effective machine trans-
lation to many more scenarios. Nevertheless, ex-
isting solutions are still far behind their supervised
counterparts, greatly limiting their practical us-
ability. For instance, existing unsupervised NMT
systems obtain between 15-16 BLEU points in
WMT 2014 English-French translation, whereas
a state-of-the-art NMT system obtains around 41
(Artetxe et al., 2018c; Lample et al., 2018; Yang
et al., 2018).

In this paper, we explore whether the rigid and
modular nature of SMT is more suitable for these
unsupervised settings, and propose a novel un-
supervised SMT system that can be trained on
monolingual corpora alone. For that purpose,
we present a natural extension of the skip-gram
model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) that simultaneously
learns word and phrase embeddings, which are
then mapped to a cross-lingual space through self-
learning (Artetxe et al., 2018b). We use the re-
sulting cross-lingual phrase embeddings to induce
a phrase table, and combine it with a language
model and a distance-based distortion model to
build a standard phrase-based SMT system. The
weights of this model are tuned in an unsupervised
manner through an iterative Minimum Error Rate
Training (MERT) variant, and the entire system

is further improved through iterative backtransla-
tion. The architecture of the system is sketched
in Figure 1. Our experiments on WMT German-
English and French-English datasets show the ef-
fectiveness of our proposal, where we obtain im-
provements above 7-10 BLEU points over previ-
ous unsupervised NMT-based approaches, closing
the gap with supervised SMT (Moses trained on
Europarl) down to 2-5 points.

lows. Section 2 introduces phrase-based SMT.

ments run and the results obtained. Section 7 dis-

concludes the paper.

2 Background: phrase-based SMT

While originally motivated as a noisy channel
model (Brown et al., 1990), phrase-based SMT
is now formulated as a log-linear combination
of several statistical models that score translation
candidates (Koehn et al., 2003). The parame-
ters of these scoring functions are estimated in-
dependently based on frequency counts, and their
weights are then tuned in a separate validation set.
At inference time, a decoder tries to find the trans-
lation candidate with the highest score according
to the resulting combined model. The specific
scoring models found in a standard SMT system
are as follows:

• Phrase table. The phrase table is a collec-
tion of source language n-grams and a list of
their possible translations in the target lan-
guage along with different scores for each of

them. So as to translate longer sequences, the
decoder combines these partial n-gram trans-
lations, and ranks the resulting candidates ac-
cording to their corresponding scores and the
rest of scoring functions. In order to build
the phrase table, SMT computes word align-
ments in both directions from a parallel cor-
pus, symmetrizes these alignments using dif-
ferent heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003), ex-
tracts the set of consistent phrase pairs, and
scores them based on frequency counts. For
that purpose, standard SMT uses 4 scores for
each phrase table entry: the direct and inverse
lexical weightings, which are derived from
word level alignments, and the direct and in-
verse phrase translation probabilities, which
are computed at the phrase level.

• Language model. The language model as-
signs a probability to a word sequence in the
target language. Traditional SMT uses n-
gram language models for that, which use
simple frequency counts over a large mono-
lingual corpus with back-off and smoothing.

• Reordering model. The reordering model
accounts for different word orders across lan-
guages, scoring translation candidates ac-
cording to the position of each translated
phrase in the target language. Standard
SMT combines two such models: a distance
based distortion model that penalizes devia-
tion from a monotonic order, and a lexical re-
ordering model that incorporates phrase ori-
entation frequencies from a parallel corpus.

• Word and phrase penalties. The word and
phrase penalties assign a fixed score to every
generated word and phrase, and are useful to
control the length of the output text and the
preference for shorter or longer phrases.

Having trained all these different models, a tuning
process is applied to optimize their weights in the
resulting log-linear model, which typically max-
imizes some evaluation metric in a separate val-
idation parallel corpus. A common choice is to
optimize the BLEU score through Minimum Error
Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003).

3 Cross-lingual n-gram embeddings

Section 3.1 presents our proposed extension of
skip-gram to learn n-gram embeddings, while Sec-
tion 3.2 describes how we map them to a shared
space to obtain cross-lingual n-gram embeddings.

3.1 Learning n-gram embeddings
Negative sampling skip-gram takes word-context
pairs (w, c), and uses logistic regression to predict
whether the pair comes from the true distribution
as sampled from the training corpus, or it is one
of the k draws from a noise distribution (Mikolov
et al., 2013b):

log σ (w · c) +
k∑
i=1

EcN∼PD [log σ (−w · cN )]

In its basic formulation, both w and c corre-
spond to words that co-occur within a certain win-
dow in the training corpus. So as to learn em-
beddings for non-compositional phrases like New
York Times or Toronto Maple Leafs, Mikolov et al.
(2013b) propose to merge them into a single token
in a pre-processing step. For that purpose, they use
a scoring function based on their co-occurence fre-
quency in the training corpus, with a discounting
coefficient δ that penalizes rare words, and itera-
tively merge those above a threshold:

score(wi, wj) =
count (wi, wj)− δ

count (wi)× count (wj)
However, we also need to learn representations

for compositional n-grams in our scenario, as there
is not always a 1:1 correspondence for n-grams
across languages even for compositional phrases.
For instance, the phrase he will come would typi-
cally be translated as vendrá into Spanish, so one
would need to represent the entire phrase as a sin-
gle unit to properly model this relation.

One option would be to merge all n-grams re-
gardless of their score, but this is not straightfor-
ward given their overlapping nature, which is fur-
ther accentuated when considering n-grams of dif-
ferent lengths. While we tried to randomly gen-
erate multiple consistent segmentations for each

sentence and train the embeddings over the result-
ing corpus, this worked poorly in our preliminary
experiments. We attribute this to the complex in-
teractions arising from the stochastic segmentation
(e.g. the co-occurrence distribution changes rad-
ically, even for unigrams), severely accentuating
the sparsity problem, among other issues.

As an alternative approach, we propose a gen-
eralization of skip-gram that learns n-gram em-
beddings on-the-fly, and has the desirable property
of unigram invariance: our proposed model learns
the exact same embeddings as the original skip-
gram for unigrams, while simultaneously learning
additional embeddings for longer n-grams. This
way, for each word-context pair (w, c) at distance
d within the given window, we update their corre-
sponding embeddings w and c with the usual neg-
ative sampling loss. In addition to that, we look
at all n-grams p of different lengths that are at the
same distance d, and for each pair (p, c), we up-
date the embedding p through negative sampling.
In order to enforce unigram invariance, the context
c and negative samples cN , which always corre-
spond to unigrams, are not updated for (p, c). This
allows to naturally learn n-gram embeddings ac-
cording to their co-occurrence patterns as modeled
by skip-gram, without introducing subtle interac-
tions that affect its fundamental behavior.

We implemented the above procedure as an ex-
tension of word2vec, and use it to train monolin-
gual n-gram embeddings with a window size of 5,
300 dimensions, 10 negative samples, 5 iterations
and subsampling disabled. So as to keep the model
size within a reasonable limit, we restrict the vo-
cabulary to the most frequent 200,000 unigrams,
400,000 bigrams and 400,000 trigrams.

3.2 Cross-lingual mapping

Cross-lingual mapping methods take indepen-
dently trained word embeddings in two languages,
and learn a linear transformation to map them
to a shared cross-lingual space (Mikolov et al.,
2013a; Artetxe et al., 2018a). Most mapping meth-
ods are supervised, and rely on a bilingual dic-
tionary, typically in the range of a few thousand
entries, although a recent line of work has man-
aged to achieve comparable results in a fully un-
supervised manner based on either self-learning
(Artetxe et al., 2017, 2018b) or adversarial train-
ing (Zhang et al., 2017a,b; Conneau et al., 2018).

In our case, we use the method of Artetxe et al.



3635

(2018b) to map the n-gram embeddings to a shared
cross-lingual space using their open source im-
plementation VecMap1. Originally designed for
word embeddings, this method builds an initial
mapping by connecting the intra-lingual similarity
distribution of embeddings in different languages,
and iteratively improves this solution through self-
learning. The method applies a frequency-based
vocabulary cut-off, learning the mapping over the
20,000 most frequent words in each language. We
kept this cut-off to learn the mapping over the most
frequent 20,000 unigrams, and then apply the re-
sulting mapping to the entire embedding space, in-
cluding longer n-grams.

4 Unsupervised SMT

As discussed in Section 2, phrase-based SMT
follows a modular architecture that combines
several scoring functions through a log-linear
model. Among the scoring functions found in
standard SMT systems, the distortion model and
word/phrase penalties are parameterless, while the
language model is trained on monolingual cor-
pora, so they can all be directly integrated into our
unsupervised system. From the remaining mod-
els, typically trained on parallel corpora, we de-
cide to leave the lexical reordering out, as the dis-
tortion model already accounts for word reorder-
ing. As for the phrase table, we learn cross-lingual
n-gram embeddings as discussed in Section 3, and
use them to induce and score phrase translation
pairs as described next (Section 4.1). Finally, we
tune the weights of the resulting log-linear model
using an unsupervised procedure based on back-
translation (Section 4.2).

Unless otherwise specified, we use Moses2 with
default hyperparameters to implement these differ-
ent components of our system. We use KenML
(Heafield et al., 2013), bundled in Moses by de-
fault, to estimate our 5-gram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, pruning n-grams
longer than 3 with a single occurrence.

4.1 Phrase table induction

Given the lack of a parallel corpus from which to
extract phrase translation pairs, every n-gram
in the target language could be taken as a poten-
tial translation candidate for each n-gram in the
source language. So as to keep the size of the

1https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap

phrase table within a reasonable limit, we train
cross-lingual phrase embeddings as described in
Section 3, and limit the translation candidates for
each source phrase to its 100 nearest neighbors in
the target language.

In order to estimate their corresponding phrase
translation probabilities, we apply the softmax
function over the cosine similarities of their re-
spective embeddings. More concretely, given the
source language phrase ē and the translation can-
didate f̄ , their direct phrase translation probability
is computed as follows3:

φ(f̄ |ē) = cos(ē, f̄)/τ∑
f̄ ′ cos(ē, f̄

′)/τ

Note that, in the above formula, f̄ ′ iterates across
all target language embeddings, and τ is a con-
stant temperature parameter that controls the con-
fidence of the predictions. In order to tune it, we
induce a dictionary over the cross-lingual embed-
dings themselves with nearest neighbor retrieval,
and use maximum likelihood estimation over it.
However, inducing the dictionary in the same di-
rection as the probability predictions leads to a de-
generated solution (softmax approximates the hard
maximum underlying nearest neighbor as τ ap-
proaches 0), so we induce the dictionary in the
opposite direction and apply maximum likelihood
estimation over it:

min
τ

∑
f̄

log φ(f̄ |NNē(f̄))+
∑
ē

log φ(ē|NNf̄ (ē))

So as to optimize τ , we use Adam with a learn-
ing rate of 0.0003 and a batch size of 200, imple-
mented in PyTorch.

In order to compute the lexical weightings, we
align each word in the target phrase with the one
in the source phrase most likely generating it,
and take the product of their respective translation
probabilities:

lex(f̄ |ē) =
∏
i

max

(
�,max

j
w(f̄i|ēj)

)
The constant � guarantees that each target lan-
guage word will get a minimum probability mass,
which is useful to model NULL alignments. In our
experiments, we set � = 0.001, which we find to

3The inverse phrase translation probability φ(ē|f̄) is de-
fined analogously.

work well in practice. Finally, the word transla-
tion probabilities w(f̄i|ēj) are computed using the
same formula defined for phrase translation prob-
abilities (see above), with the difference that the
partition function goes over unigrams only.

4.2 Unsupervised tuning
As discussed in Section 2, standard SMT uses
MERT over a small parallel corpus to tune the
weights of the different scoring functions com-
bined through its log-linear model. Given that we
only have access to monolingual corpora in our
scenario, we propose to generate a synthetic paral-
lel corpus through backtranslation (Sennrich et al.,
2016) and apply MERT tuning over it, iteratively
repeating the process in both directions (see Al-
gorithm 1). For that purpose, we reserve a random
subset of 10,000 sentences from each monolingual
corpora, and run the proposed algorithm over them
for 10 iterations, which we find to be enough for
convergence.

5 Iterative refinement

The procedure described in Section 4 suffices to
train an SMT system from monolingual corpora
which, as shown by our experiments in Section
6, already outperforms previous unsupervised sys-
tems. Nevertheless, our proposed method still
makes important simplifications that could com-
promise its potential performance: it does not use
any lexical reordering model, its phrase table is
limited by the underlying embedding vocabulary
(e.g. it does not include phrases longer than tri-
grams, see Section 3.1), and the phrase translation
probabilities and lexical weightings are estimated
based on cross-lingual embeddings.

10: mt→s ← TRAIN(bttt, trains)
11: wt→s ← MERT(mt→s, btvt, vals)
12: until convergence

In order to overcome these limitations, we pro-
pose an iterative refinement procedure based on
backtranslation (Sennrich et al., 2016). More con-
cretely, we generate a synthetic parallel corpus by
translating the monolingual corpus in one of the
languages with the initial system, and train and
tune a standard SMT system over it in the oppo-
site direction. Note that this new system does not
have any of the initial restrictions: the phrase table
is built and scored using standard word alignment
with an unconstrained vocabulary, and a lexical re-
ordering model is also learned. Having done that,
we use the resulting system to translate the mono-
lingual corpus in the other language, and train an-
other SMT system over it in the other direction. As
detailed in Algorithm 2, this process is repeated it-
eratively until some convergence criterion is met.

While this procedure would be expected to pro-
duce a more accurate model at each iteration, it
also happens to be very expensive computation-
ally. In order to accelerate our experiments, we
use a random subset of 2 million sentences from
each monolingual corpus for training4, in addition
to the 10,000 separate sentences that are held out
as a validation set for MERT tuning, and perform
a fixed number of 3 iterations of the above algo-
rithm. Moreover, we use FastAlign (Dyer et al.,
2013) instead of GIZA++ to make word alignment
faster. Other than that, training over the synthetic

trained in the full corpus.

tools with default settings.

6 Experiments and results

In order to make our experiments comparable to
previous work, we use the French-English and
German-English datasets from the WMT 2014
shared task. As discussed throughout the pa-
per, our system is trained on monolingual cor-
pora alone, so we take the concatenation of
all News Crawl monolingual corpora from 2007
to 2013 as our training data, which we tok-
enize and truecase using standard Moses tools.
The resulting corpus has 749 million tokens in
French, 1,606 million tokens in German, and
2,109 million tokens in English. Following com-
mon practice, the systems are evaluated in new-
stest2014 using tokenized BLEU scores as com-
puted by the multi-bleu.perl script in-
cluded in Moses. In addition to that, we also
report results in German-English newstest2016
(from WMT 2016), as this was used by some pre-
vious work in unsupervised NMT (Lample et al.,
2018; Yang et al., 2018)5. So as to be faithful to
our target scenario, we did not use any parallel
data in these language pairs, not even for devel-
opment purposes. Instead, we ran all our prelimi-
nary experiments on WMT Spanish-English data,
where we made all development decisions.

We present the results of our final system in
comparison to other previous work in Section 6.1.
Section 6.2 then presents an ablation study of our
proposed method, where we analyze the contribu-
tion of its different components. Section 6.3 com-
pares the obtained results to those of different su-
pervised systems, analyzing the effect of some of
the inherent limitations of our method in a stan-

for these experiments, so it is likely that our results could
be further improved by using the more extensive data from

dard phrase-based SMT system. Finally, Section
6.4 presents some translation examples from our
system.

6.1 Main results
We report the results obtained by our proposed
system in Table 1. As it can be seen, our system
obtains the best published results by a large mar-
gin, surpassing previous unsupervised NMT sys-
tems by around 10 BLEU points in French-English
(both directions), and more than 7 BLEU points in
German-English (both directions and datasets).

This way, while previous progress in the task
has been rather incremental (Yang et al., 2018),
our work represents an important step towards
high-quality unsupervised machine translation,
with improvements over 50% in all cases. This
suggests that, in contrast to previous NMT-based
approaches, phrase-based SMT may provide a
more suitable framework for unsupervised ma-
chine translation, which is in line with previ-
ous results in low-resource settings (Koehn and
Knowles, 2017).

6.2 Ablation analysis
We present ablation results of our proposed system
in Table 2. The first row corresponds to the initial
system with our induced phrase table (Section 4.1)
and default weights as used by Moses, whereas
the second row uses our unsupervised MERT pro-
cedure to tune these weights (Section 4.2). The
remaining rows represent different iterations of
our refinement procedure (Section 5), which uses
backtranslation to iteratively train a standard SMT
system from a synthetic parallel corpus.

The results show that the initial system with de-
fault weights (first row) is already better than pre-
vious unsupervised NMT systems (Table 1) by a
substantial margin (2-6 BLEU points). Our un-
supervised tuning procedure further improves re-
sults, bringing an improvement of over 1 BLEU

its contribution is somewhat weaker for German-
to-English (almost 1 BLEU point in WMT 2014
but only 0.2 in WMT 2016), and does not make
any difference for English-to-German.

The proposed iterative refinement method has a
much stronger positive effect, with improvements
over 2.5 BLEU points in all cases, and up to 5
BLEU points in some. Most gains come in the
first iteration, while the second iteration brings
weaker improvements and the algorithm seems to
converge in the third iteration, with marginal im-
provements for German-English and a small drop
in performance for French-English.

6.3 Comparison with supervised systems

So as to put our results into perspective, Table 3
comprises the results of different supervised meth-
ods in the same test sets. More concretely, we re-
port the results of the Transformer (Vaswani et al.,
2017), an NMT system based on self-attention that
is the current state-of-the-art in machine transla-
tion, along with the scores obtained by the best
performing system in each WMT shared task at

the time, and those of a standard phrase-based
SMT system trained on Europarl and tuned on
newstest2013 using Moses. We also report the ef-
fect of removing lexical reordering from the latter
as we do in our initial system (Section 4), restrict-
ing the vocabulary to the most frequent unigram,
bigram and trigrams as we do when training our
embeddings (Section 3), and using our unsuper-
vised tuning procedure over a subset of the mono-
lingual corpus (Section 4.2) instead of using stan-
dard MERT tuning over newstest2013.

Quite surprisingly, our proposed system, trained
exclusively on monolingual corpora, is relatively
close to a comparable phrase-based SMT sys-
tem trained on Europarl, with differences below
5 BLEU points in all cases and as little as 2.5 in
some. Note that both systems use the exact same
language model trained on News Crawl, making
them fully comparable in terms of the monolin-
gual corpora they have access to. While more
of a baseline than the state-of-the-art, note that
Moses+Europarl is widely used as a reference sys-
tem in machine translation. As such, we think
that our results are very encouraging, as they show

that our fully unsupervised system is already quite
close to this competitive baseline.

In addition to that, the results for the constrained
variants of this SMT system justify some of the
simplifications required by our approach. In par-
ticular, removing lexical reordering and constrain-
ing the phrase table to the most frequent n-grams,
as we do for our initial system, has a relatively
small effect, with a drop of less than 1 BLEU point
in all cases, and as little as 0.28 in some. Replac-
ing standard MERT tuning with our unsupervised
variant does cause a considerable drop in perfor-
mance, although it is below 2.5 BLEU points even
in the worst case, and our unsupervised tuning
method is still better than using default weights as
reported in Table 2. This shows the importance of
tuning in SMT, suggesting that these results could
be further improved if one had access to a small
parallel corpus for tuning.

6.4 Qualitative results

Table 4 shows some of the translations produced
by the proposed system for French→English.
Note that these examples where randomly taken
from the test set, so they should be representative
of the general behavior of our approach.

While the examples reveal certain adequacy is-
sues (e.g. The Times of London from Sidney in-

stead of Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph), and the pro-
duced output is not perfectly grammatical (e.g.
go in Australia), our translations are overall quite
accurate and fluent, and one could get a reason-
able understanding of the original text from them.
This suggests that unsupervised machine transla-
tion can indeed be a usable alternative in low re-
source settings.

7 Related work

Similar to our approach, statistical decipherment
also attempts to build machine translation sys-
tems from monolingual corpora. For that pur-
pose, existing methods treat the source language
as ciphertext, and model its generation through
a noisy channel model involving two steps: the
generation of the original English sentence and
the probabilistic replacement of the words in it
(Ravi and Knight, 2011; Dou and Knight, 2012).
The English generative process is modeled us-
ing an n-gram language model, and the chan-
nel model parameters are estimated using either
expectation maximization or Bayesian inference.
Subsequent work has attempted to enrich these
models with additional information like syntactic
knowledge (Dou and Knight, 2013) and word em-
beddings (Dou et al., 2015). Nevertheless, these
systems work in a word-by-word basis and have



3640

only been shown to work in limited settings, being
often evaluated in word-level translation. In con-
trast, our method builds a fully featured phrase-
based SMT system, and achieves competitive per-
formance in a standard machine translation task.

More recently, Artetxe et al. (2018c) and Lam-
ple et al. (2018) have managed to train a standard
attentional encoder-decoder NMT system from
monolingual corpora alone. For that purpose, they
use a shared encoder for both languages with pre-
trained cross-lingual embeddings, and train the
entire system using a combination of denoising,
backtranslation and, in the case of Lample et al.
(2018), adversarial training. This method was fur-
ther improved by Yang et al. (2018), who use a
separate encoder for each language, sharing only
a subset of their parameters, and incorporate two
generative adversarial networks. However, our re-
sults in Section 6.1 show that our SMT-based ap-
proach obtains substantially better results.

Our method is also connected to some previous
approaches to improve machine translation using
monolingual corpora. In particular, the generation
of a synthetic parallel corpus through backtransla-
tion (Sennrich et al., 2016), which is a key compo-
nent of our unsupervised tuning and iterative re-
finement procedures, has been previously used to
improve NMT. In addition, there have been sev-
eral proposals to extend the phrase table of SMT
systems by inducing translation candidates and/or
scores from monolingual corpora, using either sta-
tistical decipherment methods (Dou and Knight,
2012, 2013) or cross-lingual embeddings (Zhao
et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). While all these
methods exploit monolingual corpora to enhance
an existing machine translation system previously
trained on parallel corpora, our approach learns
a fully featured phrase-based SMT system from
monolingual corpora alone.

8 Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised
SMT system that can be trained on monolingual
corpora alone. For that purpose, we extend the
skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) to si-
multaneously learn word and phrase embeddings,
and map them to a cross-lingual space adapting
previous unsupervised techniques (Artetxe et al.,
2018b). The resulting cross-lingual phrase embed-
dings are used to induce a phrase table, which cou-
pled with an n-gram language model and distance-

based distortion yields an unsupervised phrase-
based SMT system. We further improve results
tuning the weights with our unsupervised MERT
variant, and obtain additional improvements re-
training the entire system through iterative back-
translation. Our implementation is available as
an open source project at https://github.
com/artetxem/monoses.

Our experiments on standard WMT French-
English and German-English datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposal, where we obtain im-
provements above 10 and 7 BLEU points over pre-
vious NMT-based approaches, respectively, clos-
ing the gap with supervised SMT (Moses trained
on Europarl) down to 2-5 points.

In the future, we would like to extend our ap-
proach to semi-supervised scenarios with small
parallel corpora, which we expect to be particu-
larly helpful for tuning purposes. Moreover, we
would like to try a hybrid approach with NMT,
using our unsupervised SMT system to generate
a synthetic parallel corpus and training an NMT
system over it through iterative backtranslation.
