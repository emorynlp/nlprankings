Abstract 

Prepositions are highly polysemous. Yet, little 

effort has been spent to develop language-

specific annotation schemata for preposition 

senses to systematically represent and analyze 

the polysemy of prepositions in large corpora. 

In this paper, we present an annotation schema 

for preposition senses in German. The annota-

tion schema includes a hierarchical taxonomy 

and also allows multiple annotations for indi-

vidual tokens. It is based on an analysis of 

usage-based dictionaries and grammars and 

has been evaluated in an inter-annotator-

agreement study.  

1 Annotation Schemata for Preposition 

Senses: A Problem to be Tackled 

It is common linguistic wisdom that preposi-

tions are highly polysemous. It is thus somewhat 

surprising that little attention has been paid to the 

development of specialized annotation schemata 

for preposition senses.
1
 In the present paper, we 

present a tagset for the annotation of German 

prepositions. The need for an annotation schema 

emerged in an analysis of so-called Preposition-

Noun Combinations (PNCs), sometimes called 

determinerless PPs or bare PPs. PNCs minimally 

consist of a preposition and a count noun in the 

singular that appear without a determiner. In (1), 

examples are given from German. 

(1) auf parlamentarische Anfrage (after being 

asked in parliament), bei absolut klarer Ziel-

setzung (given a clearly present aim), unter 

sanfter Androhung (under gentle threat)  

The preposition-sense annotation forms part of a 

larger annotation task of the corpus, where all 

                                                           
1  The Preposition Project is a notable exception (cf. 

www.clres.com/prepositions.html). 

relevant properties of PPs and PNCs receive either 

automated or manual annotations. In developing 

an annotation schema for preposition senses, we 

pursue two general goals:   

I. An annotation schema for preposition senses 

should provide a basis for manual annotation 

of a corpus to determine whether the interpre-

tation of prepositions is a grammatical factor. 

II. The preposition sense annotations together 

with the other annotations of the corpus 

should serve as a reference for the automatic 

classification of preposition senses.  

With regard to the goals formulated, the present 

paper is an intermediate report. The annotation 

schema has been developed and the manual anno-

tation of the corpus is well under way. The next 

logical steps will be to apply the annotations to a 

wider range of prepositions and eventually to use 

the annotated corpus for an automated classifica-

tion system for preposition senses.   

As PNCs form the basic rationale for the current 

investigation, we are only considering prepositions 

that occur in PPs and PNCs in German. We thus 

systematically exclude prepositions that do not 

take an NP complement, postpositions, and com-

plex prepositions. Thus, the sense annotation for 

prepositions currently comprises the following 22 

simple prepositions in German: 

(2) an, auf, bei, dank, durch, für, gegen, gemäß, 

hinter, in, mit, mittels, nach, neben, ohne, seit, 

über, um, unter, vor, während, wegen  

As empirical base of the analysis, we use a Swiss 

German newspaper corpus, which contains about 

230 million tokens (Neue Zürcher Zeitung 1993-

1999).  

The remaining paper is structured as follows:  

Section 2 is devoted to the characteristics of the 

annotation schema. In section 3, we present an 

analysis of the schema in terms of inter-annotator

agreement. It takes into account that the annotation 

schema is hierarchically ordered and allows for 

multiple annotations. Section 4 illustrates the ap-

plication of the schema to the preposition ohne 

(‘without’) in German.  

2 Properties of the Annotation Schema 

There are no standardized features for an anno-

tation of preposition senses in German. Our work 

is thus based on several reference works, which we 

analyzed and combined to develop the schema, 

namely Duden Deutsch als Fremdsprache (Duden, 

2002) (a dictionary of German for foreign learn-

ers), Deutsche Grammatik from Helbig and 

Buscha (2001) (a grammar of German for foreign 

learners) (both usage-based), the Lexikon 

Deutscher Präpositionen (Schröder, 1986) (a dic-

tionary of German prepositions) and an analysis of 

prepositions with a temporal meaning (Durell and 

Brée, 1993). Prima facie, the dictionary of German 

prepositions appears to be the most promising 

starting point because it includes a fine-grained 

feature-based analysis of preposition senses. How-

ever, it turns out that it is too complex for manual 

annotation, making use of more than 200 binary 

features to classify preposition meanings. 

The annotation schema shows a hierarchically 

organized, tree-like structure. Beginning with a 

root node, types of preposition meanings branch to 

subtrees for different classes (e.g. local, temporal 

or causal) with differing depths or to individual, 

non-splitting branches (see Figure 1). For temporal 

and spatial interpretations, we use decision trees 

that help to guide the annotator through the anno-

tation process.  

Altogether the annotation schema includes the 

following list of top-level categories: SPATIAL, 

TEMPORAL, MODAL, CAUSAL, STATE, COMMUNAL-

ITY/COMMUTATIVE, TRANSGRESSION, AGENT, 

REDUCTION/EXTENSION, PARTICIPATION, SUBOR-

DINATION, RECIPIENT, AFFILIATION, CORRELA-

TION/INTERACTION, ORDER, THEME, SUBSTITUTE, 

EXCHANGE, COMPARISON, RESTRICTIVE, COPULA-

TIVE, ADVERSATIVE, DISTRIBUTIVE, STATE-

MENT/OPINION, EXISTENCE/PRESENCE, CENTRE OF 

REFERENCE, and REALIZATION. 

 

The schema allows cross-classification at every 

level. This is of particular importance for the clas-

sification of directional meanings. Directionality is 

introduced through cross-classification and not 

through copying the hierarchical structure of the 

local subtree.
2
  

Another important property of the annotation 

schema is the possibility of multiple annotations 

for one preposition in context. For instance, a final 

distinction between a temporal and a causal inter-

pretation cannot be drawn in example (3). 

                                                           
2 During annotation, local and directional interpretations can 

be distinguished by case assignment in the majority of cases. 

 (3) Feuer nach [temporal/causal] Blitzschlag 

 ‘Fire after/because of lightning stroke’ 

In addition to the semantic categories, we use a 

feature ‘governed’ to label a preposition as gov-

erned by a lexical head whenever appropriate. 

Governed prepositions usually are assumed to be 

semantically empty but in some cases there is a 

discernible meaning for the preposition despite its 

being governed.  

The preposition sense annotation is only one 

part of a bigger annotation project. Annotations on 

lexical (POS, morphology, countability, preposi-

tion meaning, noun meaning), syntactic (chunks), 

relational (internal and external dependencies), and

global (e.g. marking as a headline or part of a TV 

program in a newspaper, idiomaticity, telegraphic 

style) levels will serve as a basis for annotation 

mining to detect licensing conditions of PNCs. 

3 An Analysis of Inter-Annotator 

Agreement  in a Hierarchical Annota-

tion Schema 

A weighted kappa statistic (κ) forms a standard 

for assessing the feasibility of annotation sche-

mata. Based on Cohen’s seminal work (Cohen, 

1968), Artstein and Poesio (2008) suggest the 

measure in (4), where κ is calculated as the 

weighted difference between observed and ex-

pected disagreement. 

(4)     �� = 1 − ���� 
Two aspects of the present annotation schema 

prohibit a direct application of this statistic. First, 

the annotation schema makes use of a hierarchy 

with subtypes, which leads to overlapping annota-

tion categories. As an illustration, assume that one 

annotator has annotated a given preposition with 

the sense PRESENCE, while a second annotator 

makes use of the annotation ANALYTIC, the latter 

being a subtype of the first. Secondly, the annota-

tion schema allows more than one annotation for 

the same token, to cover cases where an ambigu-

ous interpretation cannot be maximally reduced, as 

in (4). 

To deal with the first problem, the hierarchical 

structure of the annotation schema is included in 

the calculation of the weight coefficients for κ. 

Basically, two annotations are more closely related 

if either both annotations are dominated by the 

same set of nodes in the hierarchy, or one annota-

tion is a direct subtype of the other one (as usual, 

we assume domination to be reflexive). Accord-

ingly, the weight coefficient for a given disagree-

ment is reduced in relation to the depth of embed-

ding of the subcategories, based on the cardinality 

of the set of nodes that dominate both categories. 

As an illustration consider two senses A and B 

in the following configurations: a) A and B are 

directly dominated by C, a subtype of ROOT; b) A 

dominates B, A being a subtype of ROOT, and c) 

ROOT directly dominates A and C, and B is a sub-

type of C. Intuitively, c) is a case of clear dis-

agreement, while in b) we find that one annotation 

is more specific than the other one, and in a), the 

annotators have at least agreed in a common super-

type of the categories. 

Consequently, the weight coefficient for dis-

agreement should be highest in case c), but should 

be similar in cases a) and b).  

(5)  

a) b) c) 

   

The weight coefficient is determined by the fol-

lowing formula, where 	
�
� designates the depth 
of the lowest common dominating node of the two 

senses (and hence the cardinality of the set of 

dominating nodes minus 1). 

(6)     
�
� = �
�

������ ,  ��  ≠  ��0,  �� =  �� � 
For the configuration a), the number of domi-

nating nodes equals 2. Thus 	
�
� equals 1, result-
ing in a weight coefficient of 0.5. For the configu-

ration b), the cardinality of dominating nodes also 

equals 2, and again the weight coefficient is de-

termined as 0.5. For c), however, the set of domi-

nating nodes only contains ROOT, and conse-

quently, the weight is determined as 1/2
0
 = 1.

3
 

With regard to multiple annotations, we define 

new categories consisting of the combination of 

the used categories. To calculate the weight of 

disagreement between two combined categories, 

we compute the weights of all ordered pairs from 

the Cartesian product of the relevant categories 

and then calculate the arithmetic mean. As an il-

lustration consider the following configuration: 

one annotator has assigned the senses A and B to a 

given preposition, where A and B are subtypes of 

C, while the second annotator has assigned B only. 

In this case, we determine the sum of disagreement 

between A and B and A and A, respectively, and 

divide it by the number of possible combinations 

(two in the present case). The following formula 

captures this idea. 

(7)      
�
� = ��
��|
�| ∑ ∑ ���∈
��∈
�  
Now, instead of determining the κ statistic on 

the basis of non-overlapping, i.e. mutually exclu-

                                                           
3 As we assume that dominance is reflexive, each supertype 

is a supertype of itself. Hence, the weights determined for 

the cases (5a) and (5b) are identical because A is a direct 

supertype of B. This would be different if A were an indi-

rect supertype of B.

sive categories, the weights are determined by 

taking the tree structure into account. Based on the 

weighted kappa statistic, we have carried out an 

evaluation based on 1.336 annotated examples of 

the prepositions an, auf, bei, neben, unter, and vor. 

The following table summarizes the results for the 

full set of sense annotations, for senses with sub-

types (local, temporal, causal, modal), as well as 

for some individual senses. 

Table 1: Subset of Weighted Kappa-values  

subtree with the following root node !" 
ROOT 0.644 

local 0.709 

causal 0.575 

modal 0.551 

temporal 0.860 

local_reference_plane 0.569 

temporal_M=S_S=PERIOD 0.860 

The overall result of 0.644 provides support for 

the general feasibility of the annotation schema, 

and the results for local and temporal senses are 

particularly promising. The results for modal and 

causal senses, however, indicate the necessity to 

take a look at the data again and to identify sources 

of error. 

4 Criteria for annotating ohne (‘with-

out’) 

The preposition ohne (‘without’) allows six dif-

ferent interpretations at top level, among them are 

the interpretations PRESENCE, COMITATIVE, and 

PARTICIPATION. The rule guided nature of the an-

notation schema will be illustrated by the follow-

ing examples: 

(8) Die Anklage        wirft       dem ersten von 

 The prosecution accuses the first    of 

 drei Angeklagten, einem 32jährigen    Mann 

 three accused        a          32-year-old   man 

 ohne      Beruf,         die Mitwirkung   an 

 without profession   the involvement  at 

 allen drei  Tötungsdelikten vor. 

 all     three homicides          PTKVZ 

"The prosecution accuses the first of three 

defendants, a 32 years old man without a 

profession, of the involvement in all three 

homicides." 

(9) Ein mobiles Einsatzkommando überwältigte  

A  mobile    task force       defeated 

den Geiselnehmer, als     er ohne      das 

the hostage-taker,  when he without the 

Kind den Gerichtssaal verließ. 

child the  court room     left.   

"A mobile task force defeated the hostage-

taker, when he left the court room without 

the child." 

(10) Ein monetärer Schulterschluss  ohne    das  

A   monetary closing of ranks without the 

westliche 5achbarland           wäre   nicht  

western  neighboring country would be not 

nur   in Paris undenkbar. 

only in Paris unthinkable. 

"A monetary closing of ranks without in-

volving the western neighbor would be un-

thinkable not only in Paris."  

PARTICIPATION is defined as active or passive 

participation in an activity; COMITATIVE is de-

fined as an abstract coactivity of two individuals 

or objects. PRESENCE, finally, characterizes the 

presence of an object or a property. With regard 

to ohne, the features have to be negated, i.e. de-

noting a lack of participation, co-activity, or 

absence of a feature. From the definition, it al-

ready follows that the external argument of a P 

with the interpretations PARTICIPATION or COM-

ITATIVE is presumably event-like, but object-like 

with PRESENCE. COMITATIVE and PARTICIPA-

TION, finally, are distinguished by the mutuality 

present in COMITATIVE, which is not present with 

PARTICIPATION, giving rise to an assignment of 

PRESENCE in (8), COMITATIVE in (9), and PAR-

TICIPATION in (10). 

5 Conclusion 

We have presented an annotation schema for 

preposition senses in German that is based on us-

age-based grammars and dictionaries. It comprises 

a restricted set of less than 30 top level sense cate-

gories, and allows for multiple annotations of indi-

vidual token if a maximal sense reduction cannot 

be achieved. The categories local, temporal, 

causal, modal and presence introduce hierarchical 

subtypes, access to the subtypes is partially guided 

by decision trees in the annotation process. The 

hierarchical structure of the annotation schema is 

also reflected in its validation in terms of inter-

annotator agreement. Here, it became necessary to 

modify Cohen's κ to allow for overlapping catego-

ries and multiple annotations. The results reported 

here show that the schema is feasible for manual 

annotation of preposition senses.
