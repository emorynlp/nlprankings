Abstract 

The importance of learning Chinese is 

increasing in the latest decades. However, the 

learning of Chinese is not easy for foreigners as 

a second language learning. Sometimes they 

write some text or document, but there always 

have many error words. So, how to detect the 

error word in document is becoming more then 

more important. This issue is very extensive, not 

only can help foreigners to learning Chinese but 

also can detect the error word. This paper had 

proposed method can divide five sections of 

structure: First sections are input sentence; 

second sections are parsing and word 

segmentation; third sections are fine the wrong 

word; forth sections are remove duplicate; fifth 

sections are final output. In this paper we use 

language model to detect Chinese spelling. It is 

had four part, E-Hownet, CKIP, similar 

pronunciation and shape dictionary, use the 

preset word to compare the word correction 

which in database. We use the bi-gram to 

promote our performance. 

1 Introduction 

Learning Chinese is very important in this era, 

because the Chinese is main market customers. 

Since the trend of the times, there have many of 

foreigners beginning to learn Chinese. But 

Chinese is not easy to learn, because sometime 

the same word has many pronouns, or same 

pronounce has different word, even the much the 

words have similar glyph. Chinese unlike 

English, there have thousands of words in 

Chinese, different combinations have different 

meaning. Although pronounce the same, but 

there will be different words with different 

meaning, sometimes there were having some 

misunderstanding because using the wrong word. 

So how to learn Chinese is very import research. 

This topic is extensive, not only for foreigners to 

learn Chinese, but also can help to detect the 

wrong word in the document. 

In recent years, there has a lot of paper to 

research about Chinese learning. Chinese 

learning in today not only face to face teaching, 

but also can learn in a mobile system. There 

have many type smartphone applications about 

learning Chinese, sometimes there also has 

another country's language. Michael B. Syson et 

al. (2012) propose a system ABKD which is 

learning the game in multimodal, this system has 

two languages for learning, one is Chinese the 

other is Japanese. This system is learning about 

the Chinese Hanzi and Japanese Kanji by the 

game. Vincent Tam et al. (2012) use iOS-Base 

devices to propose an e-learning software, this 

device is extendible and ubiquitous, this paper 

proposes different learning type like it can learn 

the characters in correct stroke sequences of 

Chinese, it also has some mini-game to help 

learning Chinese. This author also proposes 

another paper is main on writing Chinese, and 

not only focus on iOS-base, but also for other 

smart phone (ex: android). Xiangyu Qiu et al. 

(2012) propose a method about learning Chinese 

font style and transferring, it's based on strokes 

and structure, they propose a new glyph 

decryption method, it divides the Chinese 

characters two parts, one is the stable side call 

structure, the other side is mutable called style. 

Mei-Jen Audrey Shih et al. (2011) propose an 

online system to learn Chinese, online learning 

system is convenience for user, it is assembled 

to abound environment and had a broad content 

search opportunity, this paper is focused on how 

to learn Chinese language effectively in an 

online learning environment. Lee Jo Kim et al. 

(2011) propose a tool which supports Chinese 

language teaching and learning system based on 

ICT-Base, this tool can help peer assisted 

139



learning environment. Lung-Hsiang et al. (2012) 

propose a mobile assisted system about learning 

vocabulary, they use the Mobile-Assisted 

language learning (MALL), they present two 

case studies in the Mobile-Assisted Language 

Learning, this system is main on two languages, 

one is English, the other is Chinese, specially it 

is not learning the word, it is learning about the 

“idioms” and learning how to construct 

sentences. Shang-Jen Chuanget al. (2011) 

propose a new recognition of Traditional 

Chinese handwriting by neural networks, their 

recognition of Traditional Chinese handwriting 

by PNN and SVM, their database is 20 people’s 

Traditional Chinese handwriting, and use 

different quantization methods for everyone. 

Yingfei Wu (2011) proposes a learning system 

of “Chinese calligraphy” on mobile systems, 

Calligraphy is good for learning Traditional 

Chinese font, because it needs step by step to 

write the Chinese word, but calligraphy is not 

easy, even a word usually has many different 

font styles, the calligraphy need ink and paper, 

so they propose a new mobile system which can 

easy to learning Calligraphy without use paper 

and ink. David Tawei Ku et al. (2012) proposes 

the Chinese learning in situated learning, it is 

trend a ubiquitous learning environment, and the 

feature focuses on real life learning situation, 

and problem solving practice, this learning 

system divides two parts, one is integrating 

situated learning strategy and the other is context 

awareness technology. Yanwei Wang et al. (2011) 

proposes a discriminative learning method of 

MQDF (Modified quadratic discriminant 

function), MQDF is based on sample importance 

weights, this method is investigated and 

compared other discriminative learning methods 

about MQDF. DA-Han Wang (2012) propose a 

handwriting recognition system, this system 

commonly combines character classification 

confidence scores, they propose two regularized 

classes-dependent confidence transformation 

(CT) methods. Yunxue Shao (2011) propose a 

similar handwritten Chinese characters method 

base on multiple instance learning, they solved 

the problem by Asaboost framework, the method 

is found week classifiers to select some 

self-adapting critical regions. Lung-Hsiang 

Wong (2010) propose a Mobile-Assisted 

language learning (MALL), their have two case 

studies, and focus on "creative learner outputs", 

student in two studies language by one-to-one 

mobile devices, and capture the picture of the 

real life.Shih-hung Wu et al. (2013) propose a 

paper for Chinese Spelling Check task which at 

SIGHAN bake-off 2013, in this paper, thay 

describe all detail of the task for Chinese 

spelling check, include the task descripition, 

data preparation, performance metrics, and 

evaluation results. 

This paper proposes five steps to find the 

wrong words in a document: First is input the 

sentence; the second uses the CKIP to word 

segment; the third is finding the wrong word. In 

the third step, the main method in this paper 

divides the words in document for three parts, 

The first is the single word, sometimes the single 

words mean there does not have any match word 

before or after this single word, in other words, 

is there maybe had word error, so we compose 

the word which before or after this single word, 

this word most be the single word too. After 

composing two of single words, it can generate a 

new word than regarded as a suspicious error 

word. The second is about idioms, most of the 

idioms are composed of four words, so we take 

the four words to pronounce and glyph to 

compare with the E-Hownet. The other words 

(ex: two words, three words), we also compare 

with the E-Hownet, if it can find the same word 

in E-Hownet, it means this word is correct, use it 

as a suspicious error word. Forth is remove 

duplicate, this step is remove the duplicate 

wrong word. Finally opput the file. 

2 Method 

In this section, our proposed method is to check 

out the foreigners will get the word wrong and 

then correct for the right word. The sentences 

written by people learning Chinese as a foreign 

language (CFL) may contain a variety of 

grammatical errors, such as word choice, 

missing words, and so on. It focuses on spelling 

errors in this bake-off. We will introduce the 

framework of the proposed system and method, 

which is divided into two parts: training phase 

and test phase that will describe in section 2.1 

and section 2.2. 

2.1 Training phase 

As shown in figure 1, training phase is to 

construct the dictionary which is used in test 

phase, there are including the similar 

pronunciation & shape dictionary and training 

data dictionary. E-Hownet is used to find the 

wrong word and correct the wrong word, it also 

can use to construct the rule induction. And  

140



 
 

Figure 1: the framework of the proposed system. 

 

n-gram models is also used to be the ranking 

score construct the rule induction. Finally, the 

candidate outputs are generated according to our 

rule induction. We will describe more detail in 

the follows. 

First, we go to pre-process the data from the 

bake-off organizer. Step 1, we removed 

unnecessary portions of each sentence in the 

input file, such as PID number. The results will  

feed into the tool which is the CKIP Autotag, 

then it will do word segmentation and 

part-of-speech tagging based on E-Hownet.  

The corresponding part-of-speech (POS) of each 

word is obtained in the sentences. Each word has 

a part of speech at the end of a word in 

parentheses. Step 2, we are going to remove 

unessential blank spaces and parentheses. This 

step allows us to be more convenient for the 

implementation of our program. These processes 

are also used in the test phase. 

Next, we introduce our rule induction in the 

following. 

 Let 𝐴𝑖  (𝑖 = 1~𝑛) mean incorrect word, 
𝐴𝑎𝑘(𝑘 = 1~𝑚, 𝑚 ≤ 4)  mean k-th 
incorrect word, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑘)  mean the 
similar word with 𝐴𝑎𝑘. 

 Let E − HN(𝐴𝑎1, 𝐴𝑎2, … … 𝐴𝑎𝑚)  mean 
that 𝐴𝑎1  to 𝐴𝑎𝑚  can combine into a 
word which can be find in E-Hownet, 

LOC(𝐵𝑖) mean location of the word. 

 𝑎𝑗 = 𝐿𝑂𝐶 (𝐸 − 𝐻𝑁 (𝐴𝑎𝑝, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑞))) , 

𝑏𝑟 = 𝐿𝑂𝐶(𝐸 − 𝐻𝑁 

(𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑝), 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑞)) ), 

when 𝑝 = 1, q = 2~m  or 𝑞 = 1, p =
2~m . 𝑎𝑗 (j = 1~m)  mean that 

𝐴𝑎𝑝, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑞)  combine into a word 

which can find in E-Hownet, 𝑏𝑟 (𝑟 =

1~𝑛)  mean that Sim(𝐴𝑎𝑝), 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐴𝑎𝑞) 

combine into a word which can find in 

E-Hownet. 

 𝑀𝑖𝑛((𝑎1, 𝑎2, … , 𝑎𝑚), (𝑏1, 𝑏2, … , 𝑏𝑛)  
mean that output the minimum, this 

indicates the position of the front in the 

E-Hownet which is the more correct 

word. 

2.2 Test phase 

In the previous section, the rule induction is built 

in training phase. We will describe the test phase 

of the framework in this section. The word 

segmentation and part of speech (POS) labeling 

are the same as training phase. Then, we begin 

the processes with the third step, we have to 

detect the wrong word. There are some proposed 

method to find the wrong word in the following. 

 

 In the previous step, we have the word 
segmentation, we choose the words more 

than two characters, then compared the 

words with E-Hownet or training data 

dictionary. If there is not the same words 

in E-Hownet or training data dictionary, 

we determine it as incorrect words. 

 For the judge idioms, we choose all word 
with four characters, and compared the 

word with E-Hownet and the similar 

pronunciation & shape dictionary. If there 

is not the same words in the training data 

dictionary, E-Hownet or similar 

pronunciation & shape dictionary, we 

determine it as incorrect words. 

 To the judge the sentences written by CFL, 

we focus on “的 (De)”, “地 (De)”, “得 

(De)”. Behind the “ 的  (De)” must 

connect the verb, behind the “地 (De)” 

141



must be a noun. Further, behind the “得 

(De)” must be a verb, fornt the “得 (De)” 
can be an adverb, Nv or Nh. If the 

characters do not comply with the POS of 

the above, we determine it as incorrect 

words. 

 Finally, we strengthen the judgment of 
single character. Behind or found the 

single character is the same as single 

characters, we combine the character to 

the word which contain two characters. 

And we determine it as incorrect words. 

 

According the above, we begin the processes 

which is comparing the wrong words with 

similar pronunciation & shape dictionary, that is 

in order to find the similar words, then if the 

similar words can be found in E-Hownet or 

training data dictionary, we saved the incorrect 

words in a text file named wrong, and saved the 

similar words in a text file named correct, this 

focuses on two characters of the word in the case 

of one character wrong. The proposed method 

also aim the two characters of the word in the 

case of all characters wrong, eg., 勞刀 (嘮叨). 

The processes as is same as above, but the 

incorrect words saved in a text file named 

double_wrong, and the similar saved in a text 

file named double_correct. The fifth step, we are 

going to remove duplicates. First, If the words in 

the text named wrong can be found in the text 

named double_wrong, we will remove the words 

in wrong. Second, if identify the words appear 

more than twice, we will remove the 

unnecessary words. It is helping us to reduce the 

process time. We will output the result in the 

final step. The processes will find the words and 

find the corresponding sentence, then save the 

position and correct word in the file named 

output. Finally, according the PID to sort the 

sentence and output to the specified format. For 

example, input: “(pid= A2-1051-1) 後天是小明

的生日，我要開一個無會。 ”, output: 

“A2-1051-1, 15, 舞”, If the input contains no 
spelling errors, the system should return “pid, 

0”. 

3 Experiments 

According to the Chinese spelling check task in 

SIGHAN, this paper is dedicated to the detection 

and correction of errors in sentences. The 

evaluate is divided into two parts: Subtask 1 is 

detection level that is to find out the location of 

incorrect spelling characters in the sentences, 

then the subtask 2 is correction level, which is to 

find out the location of spelling error in subtask 

1 and then correct the error. In section 3.1, we 

will describe the data sets, performance metrics, 

then we will show our evalution in section 3.2.

In this bake-off, the evaluation is an open test. 

Participants can employ any linguistic and 

computational resources to develop the spelling 

checker, and provide passages of CFL’s essays 

from the NTNU learner corpus for training 

purpose. The corpus was released in SGML 

format which is shown in figure 2. Moreover, 

there are at least 1000 different degrees of 

difficulty of testing passages for testing. In this 

paper, we use C++ to develop our proposed 

method.

the training data in run1, then we make changes 

for run2 in the data which is provided by run1. 

 

 
Figure 4: Performance evaluation. 

 

According to the table 1, our false positive rate 

is the third in this bake-off, which means that 

our proposed method is feasible, but there is 

room for improvement. There are two parts of 

performance evaluation: detection level and 

correction level which is shown in table 2 and 

table 3.In the accuracy and precision, we can see 

that our proposed method can be the top three, 

but our method in recall is relatively weaker 

than another. This performance evaluation 

shows that our method is viable, but our method 

may be overly strict cause our relatively low

4 Conclusions 

This study proposes a method for Chinese text 

detect spelling error. The method in our study is 

focus on word classify to easy detect Chinese 

spelling error. The word is classifying three 

class, single word, idioms and other words (two 

words, three words et.)The experimental result 

shows the performance it good, and we also 

apply this method in “SIGHAN 8 Chinese 

spelling check task”, and the final result pretty 

good. In the feature, we hope can raise the 

performance and find the other word classifies. 

More word class can helpful to find the Chinese 

spelling error. After the Chinese spelling error, 

we will start to study the relationship between 

grammar and spelling errors, because in this 

paper we only care about the word pronouns and 

glyph, but in recent years some spelling error 

has been regularization, it most to understanding 

the context then detect it is right or wrong, so the 

issue about the relationship between grammar 

and spelling errors is need to study, if we can 

fine the relationship then the Chinese spelling 

detect correct rate must can raise higher.
