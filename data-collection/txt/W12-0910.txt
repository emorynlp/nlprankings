Abstract

In this paper we present a profile of verb us-
age across ages in child-produced sentences
in English and Portuguese. We examine
in particular lexical and syntactic character-
istics of verbs and find common trends in
these languages as children’s ages increase,
such as the prominence of general and poly-
semic verbs, as well as divergences such as
the proportion of subject dropping. We also
find a correlation between the age of acqui-
sition and the number of complements of a
verb for English.

1 Introduction

In this paper we report on a large scale investiga-
tion of some linguistic and distributional patterns
of verbs in child-produced sentences for two lan-
guages, Portuguese and English. We compare the
characteristics that emerge for two languages that,
in spite of similarities in terms of verb usages also
have important differences, in particular in allow-
ing subject pro-drop, and examine to what degree
these are reflected in the data. This is particularly
relevant given the sparseness (and in some cases
lack) of the Portuguese data, in particular for cer-
tain ages, which may not provide as clear indica-
tions as the English data, but existing analysis for
the latter can also benefit the former and be used
to help assess results obtained for similar trends
found in it.

As such our work is related to that of Buttery
and Korhonen (2007) who perform a large scale
investigation of the subcategorization frames in
the English corpora in CHILDES (MacWhin-
ney, 2000), a database containing transcriptions
of child-directed and child-produced sentences,

comparing preferences in child and adult lan-
guage to provide support for child language ac-
quisition studies. These preferences are found us-
ing large amounts of automatically annotated data
that would be otherwise too costly and time con-
suming to manually annotate.

At present, CHILDES contains data for more
than 25 languages including English and Por-
tuguese. For English, the corpora are currently
available with annotations in raw, part-of-speech-
tagged, lemmatized and parsed formats (Sagae et
al., 2010) (Buttery and Korhonen, 2005) (Buttery
and Korhonen, 2007). Although there are similar
initiatives for other languages, like Spanish and
Hebrew (Sagae et al., 2010), for Portuguese, there
is a lack of such annotations on a large scale. In
this work we address this issue and automatically
annotate the Portuguese corpora with linguistic
and distributional information using a robust sta-
tistical parser, providing the possibility of deeper
analysis of language acquisition data.

Crosslinguistic investigations of child-
produced language have also highlighted the
important role of very general and frequent verbs,
light verbs like go, put and give which are among
the first to be acquired for languages like English
and Italian as discussed by Goldberg (1999). In
this paper we compare patterns found in child
verb usage in English and Portuguese, in one of
the first large scale investigations of syntactically
annotated child-produced Portuguese data. Using
this level of annotation we are able to examine
patterns in verb usage in particular in terms of
subjects and complements. Thus, this work is
also related to the that of Valian (1991) who found
a subject pro-drop rate of around 70% for 2 to 3
year old children in Italian, a pro-drop language,

38



and even a significant number of subject omission
for English, which is not a pro-drop language.

This investigation aims at producing a large-
coverage profile of child verb usage that can in-
form computational models of language acquisi-
tion, by both reporting on preferences in child lan-
guage as a whole and on a developmental level.
This paper is structured as follows: in section 2
we report on the resources used for this investiga-
tion, and the results are discussed in section 3. We
finish with some conclusions and future work.

2 Resources

For examining child-produced data we use the
English and Portuguese corpora from CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000). The English corpora in
CHILDES have been parsed using at least three
different pipelines: MOR, POST and MEGRASP
(available as part of the CHILDES distribution,
the corpora are POS tagged using the MOR and
POST programs (Parisse and Normand, 2000)).
In addition we use a version annotated with the
RASP system (Briscoe et al., 2006), that tok-
enizes, tags, lemmatizes and parses the input sen-
tences, outputting syntactic trees and then adding
grammatical relations (GR) as described by (But-
tery and Korhonen, 2005). This corpus contains
16,649 types and 76,386,369 tokens in 3,031,217
sentences distributed by age as shown in Table 1.

The Portuguese, CHILDES contains 3 corpora:
(1) Batoréo, with 60 narratives, 30 from adults
and 30 from children, about two stories; (2)
Porto Alegre with data from 5 to 9 year old chil-
dren, collected both cross-sectionally and longitu-
dinally; and (3) Florianópolis with the longitudi-
nal data for one Brazilian child: 5530 utterances
in broad phonetic transcription.

The combined size of the Portuguese corpora
in sentences and words is in Table 1. These were
annotated with the PALAVRAS parser, a robust
parser, which has a reported accuracy of 99%
for part-of-speech tagging, 96-97% for syntactic
trees, and 91.8% for multiword expressions (Bick,
2000)1. The childes annotation were first normal-
ized to deal with incomplete words and remove
transcription annotations, and then automatically
lemmatized, POS tagged, parsed and assigned se-
mantic tags for nouns, verbs and adjectives.

3 Verbs in children data

To characterize verb usage in each of these lan-
guages we examined the distribution of verbs
across the ages in terms of their relative frequen-
cies, the number of syntactic complements with
which they occur, and looking at possible links
between these and age of acquisition, as reported
by Gilhooly and Logie (1980).

Figure 1 focuses on the relative distributions of
verbs in relation to other frequent parts-of-speech:
prepositions and nouns. For both languages verbs
account for around 20% of the words used, and
this proportion remains constant as age increases,
with the exception of the discontinuity for years 3

1The PALAVRAS parser was evaluated using European
and Brazilian Portuguese newspaper corpora (CETENFolha
and CETEMPblico) composed of 9,368 sentences.

Table 2 shows the number of verb types and to-

the top 5 most frequent verbs2 for each language
are: be, get, go, have and say for English and ir
(go) ser (be) estar (be), ter (have) and ver (see)
for Portuguese. These correspond to very general
and polysemous verbs, and their relative propor-
tions in the two languages remain high throughout
the ages for children, figure 2. The frequencies
for English are consistent with those reported by
Goldberg (1999) and the Portuguese data is com-
patible with the crosslinguistic trends for related
languages.

In terms of the syntactic characteristics of verbs
in child-produced data, we examine separately

tized form, including all its inflected forms.

the occurrence of subjects and other comple-
ments in these languages, using the syntactic an-
notation provided by the RASP and PALAVRAS
parsers. In the RASP annotation (Briscoe, 2006)
we search for 3 types of complements in English:
a direct object (dobj), the second NP comple-
ment in a double object construction (obj2) and
an indirect PP object (iobj). For Portuguese, we
search the PALAVRAS annotation for the follow-
ing types of objects: a direct (accusative) object
(ACC), a dative object (DAT), an indirect prepo-
sitional object (PIV) and an object complement
(OC).3

For subjects figure 3 shows the occurrences of
overt (subj verb) and omitted subjects (only verb)
in sentences in relation to the total number of
verbs (verb) for the two languages. These are a
source of divergence between them as in the En-
glish data most of the verb usages consistently
have an overt subject, and only around 10-20%
omit the subject, but these tend to occur less as the
age increases, with a peak for 2 year old children.
In Portuguese, on the other hand, initially most of
the verb usages omit the subject, and only later

this trend is reversed, but still maintaining a high
proportion of subject dropping, around 40% of
verb usages, and around 60% including an overt
subject. The precise age for this change cannot
be assessed from this data, due to the lack of sen-
tences for 3-5 year old children in the Portuguese
data. This difference between the two languages
can be explained as a result of Portuguese being
a (subject) pro-drop language and children being
consistently exposed to subject dropping in their
linguistic environment. Although English is not a
pro-drop language, children, especially at an early
age, still produce sentences without overt sub-
jects, as much discussed in the literature (Valian,
1991) and more recently (Yang, 2010). Children
learning pro-drop languages seem to adopt it from
an early age and use it with a frequency much
closer to adult usage (Valian, 1991).

In relation to other verb complements, we ex-
amine the changes in the distribution of verbs
and their subcategorization frames in the corpus
across children’s ages. Figure 4 shows the distri-
bution per age for verbs with one, two and three
complements for both languages. As expected in
general verbs with fewer complements are more
frequently used and as the number of comple-
ments increases, the frequency decreases, for all
ages and for both languages. Moreover, as age in-

creases, there is a slight but constant increase in
the presence of verbs with 2 and 3 complements
in the corpus, with a small decrease in those with
only 1, which nonetheless still account for the ma-
jority of the cases. These patterns are more clearly
visible for English, as more data is available than
for Portuguese for all ages.

To further investigate this we analyzed whether
a relation between the number of complements of
a verb and its age of acquisition could be found.
For English we used the age of acquisition (AoA)
scores from Gilhooly and Logie (1980) which is
available for 22 of the verbs in the English data,
but from these two verbs were removed from the
set, as they did not occur in all the ages. For Por-
tuguese, the scores from Marques et al. (2007)
are available for only four verbs in the CHILDES
corpora, and were therefore not considered in this
analysis. Using the total frequency for a verb in
the corpus, we calculated the relative frequencies
for each number of complements (0, 1, 2 and 3)
per age. For each verb and each age the number of
complements with maximum frequency was used
as the basis for checking if a correlation with the
AoA scores for the verb could be found. In terms
of the number of complements per age these verbs
can be divided into 3 groups, apart from 2 of the
verbs (lock and burn) that do not have any clear
pattern:

0-obj: for verbs that are used predominantly with-
out complements throughout the ages, think,
speak, swim, lie, turn, fly, try;

1-obj: for verbs that appear consistently with 1
complement for all ages, drive, chop, hate,
find, win, tear;

0-to-1: for verbs initially used mostly without com-
plements but then consistently with 1 com-
plement, hurt, guess, throw, kick, hide.

In terms of the age of acquisition, verbs in the
0-obj group tend to have lower scores than those
in the second group, with a 0.72 Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient indicating a high correla-
tion between AoA and predominant number of
complements of a verb. As the third group had
both patterns, it was not considered in the anal-
ysis. These results suggest that the number of
syntactic objects tends to increase with the age
of acquisition. This may be partly explained by

41



a potential increase in complexity as the num-
ber of obligatory arguments for a verb increase
(Boynton-Hauerwas, 1998). However, more in-
vestigation is needed to confirm this trend.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a wide-coverage pro-
file of verbs in child-produced data, for English
and Portuguese. We examined the distribution
of some lexical and syntactic characteristics of
verbs in these languages. Common trends, such
as the prominent role of very general and poly-
semic verbs among the most frequently used and
a preference for smaller number of complements
were found throughout the ages in both languages.
Divergences between them such as the proportion
of subject dropping in each language were also
found: a lower proportion for English which de-
creases with age and a higher proportion for Por-
tuguese which remains relatively high. These re-
sults are compatible with those reported by e.g.
Goldberg (1999) and Valian (1991), respectively.
Furthermore, for English we found a high cor-
relation between a lower age of acquisition of a
verb and a lower predominant number of com-
plements. Given the size of the Portuguese data,
for some of these analyses further investigation
is needed with more data to confirm the trends
found.

For future work we intend to extend these anal-
yses for other parts-of-speech, particularly nouns,
also looking at other semantic and pragmatic fac-
tors, such as polysemy, concreteness and famil-
iarity. In addition, we plan to examine intrinsic
(e.g. length of words; imageability; and famil-
iarity) and and extrinsic factors (e.g. frequency),
and their effect in groups with typical develop-
ment and with specific linguistic impairments.
