Although there has been much theoretical work on using various information status distinctions
to explain the form of references in written text, there have been few studies that attempt to
automatically learn these distinctions for generating references in the context of computer-
regenerated text. In this article, we present a model for generating references to people in news
summaries that incorporates insights from both theory and a corpus analysis of human written
summaries. In particular, our model captures how two properties of a person referred to in the
summary—familiarity to the reader and global salience in the news story—affect the content
and form of the initial reference to that person in a summary. We demonstrate that these two
distinctions can be learned from a typical input for multi-document summarization and that
they can be used to make regeneration decisions that improve the quality of extractive summaries.

1. Introduction

News reports, and consequently news summaries, contain frequent references to the
people who participate in the reported events. Generating referring expressions to
people in news summaries is a complex task, however, especially in a multi-document
summarization setting where different documents can refer to the same person in
different ways. One issue is that the generator has to work with textual input as opposed
to closed-domain semantic representations. More importantly, generating references to
people involves issues not generally considered in the referring expression literature.

People have names that usually distinguish them from others in context, and as
such, the framework of generating descriptions that rule out distractors (e.g., the body
of research building on Dale [1992], including the recent shared tasks based on the
TUNA corpus [Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2008]) is not appropriate. Recent GREC challenges
(Belz, Kow, and Viethen 2009) have, however, focused on references to named entities,
and we compare that body of work to ours in Section 2.2.

In our domain of summarizing news articles, the aim of generating references to
people is to introduce them to the listener and relate them to the story. How much
description is needed depends on many factors, including the knowledge the speaker
expects the listener to have, the context of the discourse, and the importance of the
person to the narrative. In this article, we explore these three information status distinc-
tions in the context of generating references to people in multi-document summaries of
newswire:

1. discourse-new vs. discourse-old: whether a reference to a person is a first
or subsequent mention of that person is purely a property of the text.

2. hearer-new vs. hearer-old: whether the person being mentioned is
familiar to the hearer is a property associated with the hearer.

3. major vs. minor character: how important or salient a person is to the
narrative depends on communicative goals and is therefore a property
associated with the speaker.

Through our studies, we seek answers to three main research questions:

1. Is it possible to automatically infer information not explicitly stated about
people in the input for summarization, such as familiarity and salience?

2. Is such information useful for the task of generating references to people
in multi-document summaries?

3. Can summary quality be improved through an informed rewrite of
references to people?

We report positive answers to all three questions. Our corpus-based approach
models the differences between first and subsequent references, provides detail on how
to generate the variety of first references that occur, and shows how distinctions such as
familiarity and salience drive generation decisions for initial references.

In this article, we describe and evaluate a new algorithm for referring to people
in multi-document news summaries that integrates results from two earlier studies
(Nenkova and McKeown 2003; Nenkova, Siddharthan, and McKeown 2005). In the
following sections, we first discuss related work (Section 2) and then present a simple
model for distinguishing discourse-new and discourse-old references (Section 3, based
on Nenkova and McKeown [2003]). A more sophisticated model based on automatically
acquired information about familiarity and salience is presented in Section 4 and these
distinctions are used for making generation decisions in Section 5 (based on Nenkova,
Siddharthan, and McKeown [2005]). We then present an integrated algorithm that gen-
erates new references to people in news summaries based on the acquired information
status distinctions and report an evaluation of the effect of reference rewriting on
summary quality in Section 6, including a discussion of its scope and limitations in
Section 6.2.

2. Related Work

Related research into summarization, information status distinctions, and generating
referring expressions is reviewed here.

2.1 Extractive and Abstractive Summarization

Multi-document summarization has been an active area of research over the past two
decades and yet, barring a few exceptions (Radev and McKeown 1998; Daumé III et al.
2002; Barzilay and McKeown 2005), most systems still use shallow features to produce
an extractive summary, an age-old technique (Luhn 1958) that has well-known prob-
lems. Extractive summaries may contain phrases that the reader cannot understand out
of context (Paice 1990) and irrelevant phrases that happen to occur in a relevant sentence
(Knight and Marcu 2000; Barzilay 2003). Referring expressions in extractive summaries
illustrate this, as sentences compiled from different documents might contain too little,
too much, or repeated information about the referent.

In a study of how summary revisions could be used to improve cohesion in multi-
document summarization (Otterbacher, Radev, and Luo 2002), automatic summaries
were manually revised and the revisions classified as pertaining to discourse (34% of
all revisions), entities (26%), temporal ordering (22%), and grammar (12%). This study
further supports the findings from early research that unclear references in summaries
pose serious problems for users (Paice 1990).

2.1.1 Sentence Compression and Fusion. Research in abstractive summarization has largely
focused on the problem of compression, developing techniques to edit sentences by
removing information that is not salient from extracted sentences. Some approaches
use linguistic rules (e.g., Zajic et al. 2007) often combined with corpus-based informa-
tion (Jing and McKeown 2000), whereas other approaches use statistical compression
applied to news (Knight and Marcu 2000; Daumé III and Marcu 2002) and to spoken
dialogue (Galley and McKeown 2007). Other researchers addressed the problem of
generating new sentences to include in a summary. Information fusion, which uses
bottom–up multi-sequence alignment of the parse trees of similar sentences, generates
new summary sentences from phrases extracted from different document sentences
(Barzilay and McKeown 2005; Filippova and Strube 2008).

2.1.2 Summary Revision. Research in single-document summarization on improving
summaries through revision (Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999) is closer to our work.
Three types of ad hoc revision rules are defined—elimination (removing parentheticals,
sentence initial prepositional phrases, and adverbial phrases), aggregation (combining
constituents from two sentences), and smoothing. The smoothing operators cover some
reference editing operations. They include substitution of a proper name with a name
alias if the name is mentioned earlier, expansion of a pronoun with co-referential proper
name in a parenthetical, and replacement of a definite NP with a co-referential indefinite
if the definite occurs without a prior indefinite. Mani et al.’s (1999) work differs from
ours in that it focuses primarily on subsequent mention (with the exception of pronoun
replacement), is meant to work for all entities, not just mentions to people, and does not
incorporate distinctions inferred from the input to the summarizer.

Although the rules and the overall approach are based on reasonable intuitions, in
practice entity rewrites for summarization do introduce errors, some due to the rewrite
rules themselves, others due to problems with co-reference resolution and parsing.

813



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

Readers are very sensitive to these errors and prefer extractive summaries to summaries
where all references have been edited (Nenkova 2008). Automatic anaphora resolution
for all entities mentioned in the input and summary text is also errorful, with about
one third of all substitutions in the summary being incorrect (Steinberger et al. 2007).
In contrast, when editing references is restricted to references to people alone, as we do
in the work presented here, there are fewer edits per summary but the overall result is
perceived as better than the original by readers (Nenkova and McKeown 2003).

2.1.3 Reference in Summaries. There has been little investigation of the phenomenon
of reference in news summaries. In addition to the revision of subsequent references
described in Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn (1999), we are aware of Radev and McKeown
(1997), who built a prototype system called PROFILE that extracted references to people
from news, merging and recording information about people mentioned in various
news articles. The idea behind the system was that the rich profiles collected for people
could be used in summaries of later news in order to generate informative descriptions.
However, the collection of information about entities from different contexts and differ-
ent points in time leads to complications in description generation; for example, past
news can refer to Bill Clinton as Clinton, an Arkansas native, the democratic presidential
candidate Bill Clinton, U.S. President Clinton, or former president Clinton and it is not clear
which of these descriptions are appropriate to use in a summary of a novel news item.
In later work, Radev and McKeown (1998) developed an approach to learn correlations
between linguistic indicators and semantic constraints to address such problems, but
this line of research has not been pursued further.

Next, we review related work on reference outside the field of summarization.

2.2 Information Status and Generating Referring Expressions

Research on information status distinctions closely relates to work on generating refer-
ring expressions. We now overview the two fields and how they interact.

2.2.1 Information Status Distinctions. Information status distinctions depend on two
parameters related to the referent’s place in the discourse model maintained by the
reader: (a) whether it already exists in the hearer’s model of the discourse and (b)
its degree of salience. The influence of these distinctions on the form of referring
expressions has been a focus of past research. For example, centering theory (Grosz,
Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) deals predominantly with local salience (local attentional
status), and the givenness hierarchy of Prince (1992) focuses on how a referent entered
the discourse model (e.g., through a direct mention in the current discourse, through
previous knowledge, or through inference), leading to distinctions such as discourse-
old, discourse-new, hearer-old, hearer-new, inferable, and containing inferable. Gundel,
Hedberg, and Zacharski (1993) attempt to merge salience and givenness in a single
hierarchy consisting of six distinctions in cognitive status (in focus, activated, familiar,
uniquely identifiable, referential, type-identifiable). In all three theories, familiarity and
salience distinctions are shown to be associated with different preferences for syntactic
form in the realization of referring expressions.

2.2.2 Generating Referring Expressions (GRE). The most developed sub-area of re-
ferring expression generation deals with the problem of generating distinguishing
descriptions—descriptions that include enough attributes of the intended referent so
that it becomes uniquely identifiable among other entities (Dale 1992). The original

814



Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown Information Status and References to People

incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) assumes that a list of attributes of the dis-
course entities is readily available and that attributes that rule out the most distractors
are added to the referring expression until its interpretation contains only the intended
referent. Subsequent work on referring expression generation has (a) expanded the
logical framework to allow reference by negation (the dog that is not black) and references
to multiple entities (the brown or black dogs) (van Deemter 2002; Gatt and Van Deemter
2007), (b) explored different search algorithms for finding a minimal description (e.g.,
Horacek 2003), and (c) offered different representation frameworks such as graph the-
ory (Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2003) or reference domain theory (Denis 2010) as
alternatives for representing referring characteristics. This body of research assumes
a limited domain where the semantics of attributes and their allowed values can be
formalized, though semantic representations and inference mechanisms are getting in-
creasingly sophisticated (e.g., the use of description logic: Areces, Koller, and Striegnitz
2008; Ren, van Deemter, and Pan 2010). In contrast, Siddharthan and Copestake (2004)
consider open-domain generation of referring expressions in a regeneration task (text
simplification); they take a different approach, approximating the hand-coded domain-
knowledge of earlier systems with a measure of relatedness for attribute-values that is
derived from WordNet synonym and antonym links.

2.2.3 Recent Trends: Data Collection and Evaluations. There is now increasing awareness
that factors other than conciseness are important when planning referring expressions
and that considerable variation exists between humans generating referring expressions
in similar contexts. Recent evaluation exercises such as the TUNA challenge (Gatt, Belz,
and Kow 2008) therefore consider metrics other than length of a reference, such as
humanness and the time taken by hearers to identify the referent. In a similar vein,
Viethen and Dale (2006) examine how similar references produced by well-known
algorithms are to human-produced references, and Dale and Viethen (2009) examine
differences in human behavior when generating referring expressions. There is also
growing collaboration between psycholinguists and computational linguists on the
topic of generating referring expressions; for instance, the PRE-CogSci workshop (van
Deemter et al. 2010).

Recently, several corpora marked for various information status aspects have
been made available. Subsequent studies concerned with predicting givenness status
(Nissim 2006; Sridhar et al. 2008), narrow focus (Calhoun 2007; Nenkova and Jurafsky
2007), and rheme and theme distinctions (Postolache, Kruijff-Korbayova, and Kruijff
2005) have not been used for generation or summarization tasks. Current efforts in
the language generation community aim at providing a corpus and evaluation task
(the GREC challenge) to address just this issue (Belz and Varges 2007; Belz, Kow, and
Viethen 2009). The GREC-2.0 corpus, extracted from Wikipedia articles and annotated
for the task of referring expression generation for both first and subsequent mentions
of the main subject of the article, consists of 2,000 texts in five different domains
(cities, countries, rivers, people, and mountains). The more recent GREC-People
corpus consists of 1,000 texts in just one domain (people) but references to all people
mentioned in a text have been annotated. The GREC challenges require systems to pick
the most appropriate reference in context from a list of all references in the document
and several defaults, including pronouns, common-noun references, elided reference,
and standardized versions of names. By selecting encyclopedic articles about specific
referents, this corpus contains large numbers of subsequent references, and in general,
the emphasis has been to model the form of subsequent references to named entities in
longer texts. Discourse-new vs. discourse-old is the only information status distinction

815



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

that participating systems model, with other features derived from lexical and syntactic
context; for instance, Greenbacker and McCoy (2009) consider subjecthood, parallelism,
recency, and ambiguity.

2.2.4 Applications of Information Status Distinctions to GRE. The main application of
theories of information status has been in anaphora resolution. Information status
distinctions are not normally used in work on generating referring expressions, with
a few notable exceptions.

Krahmer and Theune (2002) show that the relative salience of discourse entities
can be taken into account to produce less-informative descriptions (including fewer
attributes than those necessary to uniquely identify the referent using a discourse model
that does not incorporate salience). In contrast, Jordan and Walker (2005) show that, in
task-oriented dialogs, over-specified references (including more attributes than needed
to uniquely identify the intended referent) are more likely for certain dialog states
and communicative goals. Some participating teams in the GREC challenges use the
discourse-new vs. discourse-old distinction as a feature to help select the most likely
reference in context. Different interpretations of Centering Theory have also been used
to generate pronominal references (McCoy and Strube 1999; Henschel, Cheng, and
Poesio 2000).

Our research is substantially different in that we model a much richer set of in-
formation status distinctions. Also, our choice of the news genre makes our studies
complementary to the GREC challenges, which use Wikipedia articles about people or
other named entities. News stories tend to be about events, not people, and the choice of
initial references to participants is particularly important to help the reader understand
the news. Our research is thus largely focused on the generation of initial references.
Due to their short length, summaries do not generally have long co-reference chains
and the issue of subsequent reference is of less interest to us. Further, we aim to generate
new references to people by identifying semantic attributes that are appropriate given
the context of the summary. In contrast, the GREC challenges only require the selection
of an existing referring expression from a list.

3. Study 1: Discourse-New and Discourse-Old Mentions

Our first study on information status deals with the discourse-new (first mention)
versus discourse-old (subsequent mention) distinction. This is the easiest of the three
to model, as it is explicitly given in the text. Nevertheless, referring expressions in
extractive summaries can be problematic in this respect as sentences compiled from
different documents might contain too little, too much, or repeated information about
the referent. The first summary reference to a person, for example, may have been the
second reference to that person in the input article and thus might not contain enough
information to be comprehensible. Conversely, if the second summary reference to a
person occurred first in the input article, it may contain more information than needed.
In general, in fluent human written text, discourse-new references to entities are longer
and more descriptive, whereas discourse-old references are shorter and have a purely
referential function. This is not always the case in automatic summaries: Figure 1 shows
two extractive summaries. The summaries give a good indication of the problems with
reference that can arise in multi-document summaries. In the first summary, references
to the former East German Communist leader Erich Honecker are overly repetitive and
unnecessary. The extra identification at each mention totals about 15 words, equivalent
to the length of an additional informative sentence that could have been included

instead. In the second summary, the references to Turkish politicians are likely to remain
unclear to most readers because of the reduced forms that are realized.

3.1 Corpus Analysis

In order to develop strategies for addressing these issues, we performed a corpus study
on the syntactic form of references to people in news text. We used a corpus of news
from the test data used in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) Multi-
document Summarization Track (2001–2003), containing 651,000 words and coming
from 876 news reports from six different news agencies. The variety of sources is
important because working with text from a single source could lead to the learning
of paper-specific editorial rules.

The reference characteristics we were interested in were number of pre-modifiers,
presence and type of post-modifiers, and the form of name used to refer to people.
The corpus was automatically annotated for person name occurrence and co-reference
using Nominator (Wacholder, Ravin, and Choi 1997). Syntactic form of references was
obtained using Charniak’s parser (Charniak 2000). This automatically annotated corpus
contains references to 6,240 distinct people.

The distribution of forms for discourse-new and discourse-old references are shown
in Table 1. For discourse-old references, computing the probability of a syntactic real-
ization is not as straightforward as for discourse-new references, because the form of
the reference is influenced by the form of previous references, among other factors.
To capture this relationship, we used the data from discourse-old mentions to form a
Markov chain, which captures exactly the probability of transitioning from one form of
reference to another. The stationary distributions of the chains for name and pre- and
post-modification were computed as an indication of the likelihood of each form in any
discourse-old mentions, and are shown in the last column of Table 1.

It is evident from these statistics that, in general, discourse-new references should
contain the full name and some form of modification, whereas discourse-old references
should be referred to only by surname. At the same time, there are occasions when
the surname only can be used for discourse-new references and, for one in every four
references, modifiers are also not necessary. It is thus important to identify referent

properties that can help determine when these less-common types of references are
felicitous, and we will indeed turn to this question in Section 4.

3.2 Algorithm for Generating Discourse-New and Discourse-Old References
to People

To capture the patterns revealed by the corpus analysis, we developed a set of rewrite
rules for references to people shown in Algorithm 1. These rules ensure that the
discourse-new reference is descriptive and conveys the full name of the person, and
that discourse-old references are as brief as possible, using only the surname of the
person. For the discourse-new reference, information from all news articles in the
summarization input is used. Applying Algorithm 1 to the extractive summaries from
Figure 1 produces the rewrite versions of the summaries in Figure 2.

3.3 Evaluation

To evaluate the impact of the rewrite rules on the overall summary, Algorithm 1
was used to rewrite 11 summaries chosen at random from the DUC 2001 and 2002
summaries that contained at least one reference to a person. Four human judges
(graduate students at Columbia University, two in computational linguistics and two
in other areas) were then given the pairs of the original summary and its rewritten
variant without being explicitly told which is which. They were asked to read the
summaries and decide if they prefer one text over the other or if they are equal. They
were also asked to give free-form comments on what they would change themselves.
The distribution of the 44 preferences is as follows: 39 (89%) preferences were for
the rewritten form, 4 (9%) were for the original, and there was no preference for the
remaining 1 (2%). This preference for the rewritten form is significant (z-test; p < 0.01).

In two out of the four cases where the assessor preferred the original version, they
commented that the reason for the preference was that the original version exhibited
more variation. This observation indicates that the rule for strictly using surname at
discourse-old references is too rigid and most probably will need modification in cases
where a person is mentioned more often.

818



Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown Information Status and References to People

Rewrite rules for discourse-new references:

1. IF the person’s name is the head of the noun phrase THEN:
(a) IF any pre-modification is found in the input THEN:

i. Insert full name and the longest, in number of words, pre-modifier
sequence found in the input articles. In case of ties, the
discourse-new reference from the article from which the summary
sentence is drawn is preferred.

(b) ELSE IF no pre-modification is found in the input THEN:
i. Check all discourse-new references in the input to see if any of them

includes an apposition modifier.
ii. Take the longest such modifier and include it in the discourse-new

reference NP. Pre-modification is preferred to apposition because
they are more frequently used in human-produced texts as shown in
the statistics above (in 51% vs. 25% of cases).

2. ELSE IF The name is not the head of the noun phrase it appears in, do not rewrite
it.

Rewrite rules for discourse-old references:

1. Use surname only, remove all pre- and post-modifiers.

Figure 2
Rewritten versions of extractive summaries from Figure 1.

These results show that even the basic distinction of discourse-new and discourse-
old reference in the input and the summaries, the simplest distinction we explore, can
help improve summaries. Still, our distributional analysis of syntactic forms in human-
generated summaries showed that a full quarter of the discourse-new references contain
no modification at all, and half the discourse-new references contained either no mod-
ification or just a title or role modifier (e.g., Mr. or President). There are also differences
in the forms of references to people between news reports and human summaries of
news (Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown 2004), so not all discourse-new references
from the input should be reused directly. Journalistic conventions for many mainstream
newspapers dictate that initial mentions to people include a minimum description such
as their role or title and affiliation. However, in news summaries written by humans,
there are greater space constraints that might warrant shorter references to people.
In order to capture reference variation and compression correctly, we need further

distinctions (familiarity and global salience) that will help us determine when it is
felicitous to leave out information. We next describe how we learn these distinctions
(Section 4) before using them to make generation decisions (Section 5).

4. Study 2: Automatic Prediction of Referent Familiarity and Salience

Deciding how much and what information to include in a reference is influenced by
at least two factors: the degree of familiarity of the referent (hearer-old vs. hearer-new
distinction) and the degree of global salience of the referent (is the entity a major or minor
character in the news event). These two distinctions have not previously been studied
in the context of summarization. There is a trade-off, particularly important for a short
summary, between what the speaker wants to convey and how much the listener needs
to know. The major/minor distinction plays a role in defining the communication goal
(what the summary should be about, which characters are important enough to refer to
by name, etc.). The hearer-old/hearer-new distinction can be used to determine whether
a description for a character is required from the listener’s perspective.

Hearer-old vs. hearer-new. Hearer-new entities in a summary should be described in
sufficient detail, whereas hearer-old entities do not require an introductory description.
This distinction can have a significant impact on overall length and intelligibility of the
produced summaries. Usually, summaries are very short—100 or 200 words for input
articles totaling 5,000 words or more. Several people might be involved in a story, which
means that if all participants are fully described, little space will be devoted to actual
news. In addition, introducing already-familiar entities might distract the reader from
the main story (Grice 1975). It can therefore be useful to refer to an entity that can be
assumed hearer-old by just a title + surname (e.g., President Obama) or by full name only,
with no accompanying description (e.g., Michael Jackson). Such application of the hearer-
old/hearer-new distinction can explain the results from our corpus study of realizations
in which we found that 49% of discourse-new references contain only the name or the
name and title with no additional descriptive information.

Major vs. minor. Another distinction that human summarizers seem to make is whether
a character in a story is a central or a minor one and this distinction can be conveyed by
using different forms of referring expressions. It is common to see references in human
summaries such as the dissident’s father. Usually, discourse-new references made solely
with a common noun phrase, without the inclusion of the person’s name, are employed
when the person is not the main focus of a story and is only peripherally related to
the main story focus. By automatically inferring if a character is major or minor for the
story, we can decide whether to name the character in the summary. Furthermore, many
summarization systems use the presence of named entities as a feature for computing
the importance of a sentence (Ge, Huang, and Wu 2003; Saggion and Gaizaukas 2004).
The ability to identify and use only the major story characters for computing sentence
importance can benefit such systems because, in the multi-document summarization
track of DUC, only 5% of all people mentioned in the input are also mentioned in the
human summaries.

In this section, we report our experiments on building an automatic predictor for the
hearer-old/hearer-new and major/minor distinctions. For these experiments, we use
data from DUC to approximate the distinctions of interest, without the need for manual
annotation. We then validate the performance of the predictor on an independent data
set using human judgments as gold standard, achieving high accuracy. These two

820



Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown Information Status and References to People

distinctions are then used to automatically predict the form and content of discourse-
new reference in summaries (Section 5).

4.1 Data Preparation

We use data from the DUC multi-document summarization collection (2001–2004),
consisting of 170 pairs of document input sets (10 documents per set) and the corre-
sponding human-written multi-document summaries (two or four per set). Our aim
is to identify every person mentioned in a document set (the 10 news reports and
the associated human summaries), assign labels for the hearer-old/hearer-new and
major/minor distinctions, and generate feature sets for supervised learning. To do this,
we first pre-process the data as described next.

4.1.1 Automatic Pre-Processing. Our experiment requires an analysis of every reference to
a person in the input documents. For this purpose, we use a variety of tools to perform
named entity resolution and co-reference, and to analyze the content of references,
including pre-modifiers and post-modification using relative clauses or appositives.

To identify the level of analysis required, we manually inspected the first 500
discourse-new references to people from human summaries in the DUC 2001–2004
data. We found that 71% of pre-modifying words were either title or role words (e.g.,
Prime Minister, Physicist, or Dr.) or temporal role modifying adjectives such as former or
designate. Affiliation (country, state, location, or organization names) constituted 22% of
pre-modifying words. All other kinds of pre-modifying words, such as moderate or loyal
constituted only 7%. We concluded that there are two attributes that are particularly
relevant for generation of discourse-new references of people: role and affiliation.1

For named entity recognition and semantic analysis of references, all input doc-
uments and summaries were tagged using IDENTIFINDER (Bikel, Schwartz, and
Weischedel 1999) to mark up person names, organizations, and locations. We marked
up countries and American states using a list obtained from the CIA factsheet.2 The
list consists of 230 country/nationality pairs. To mark up roles, we used a list derived
from WordNet (Miller et al. 1993) hyponyms of the person synset. Our list has 2,371
entries including multiword expressions such as chancellor of the exchequer, brother in
law, senior vice president, and so forth. The list is quite comprehensive and includes roles
from the fields of sports, politics, religion, military, business, and many others. We also
used WordNet to obtain a list of 58 temporal adjectives. WordNet classifies these as pre-
(e.g., occasional, former, incoming) or post-nominal (e.g., elect, designate, emeritus).

In addition, the documents and summaries were annotated with a part-of-speech
tagger and simplex noun-phrase chunker (Grover et al. 2000). Also for each named en-
tity, relative clauses, appositional phrases, and copula constructs, as well as pronominal
co-reference, were automatically annotated (Siddharthan 2003a, 2003b). The goal was
to find, for each person mentioned in the input set, the list of all references to the person
in all input documents. For this purpose, all input documents were concatenated
and processed with IDENTIFINDER. The IDENTIFINDER output was automatically

report that their annotators marked 123 attributes of people mentioned in 156 Web documents. The four
most frequent attributes in their collection were: occupation, work, affiliation, and full name; these are
the same attributes that we identify.

apposition, “RC” for relative clause and “IS” for copula.

post-processed to mark up co-referring names and to assign a unique canonical name
for each name co-reference chain. For co-reference, a simple rule of matching the sur-
name was used, and the canonical name was the “FirstName LastName” string where
the two parts of the name could be identified.3 Concatenating all documents assures that
the same canonical name will be assigned to all named references to the same person.

The tools for pronoun co-reference and clause and apposition identification and
attachment (Siddharthan 2002, 2003a) were run separately on each document. Then for
each item in the list of canonical names derived from the IDENTIFINDER output, we
matched the initial reference in the generic co-reference list for the document with the
surname from the canonical name list. The pre-processing steps described previously
allow us to collect co-reference information and realization forms (see Figure 3) for each
person in each input set, for documents and summaries.

The tools that we used have been evaluated separately when used in a single doc-
ument setting. In our cross-document matching processes, we could incur more errors,
for example, when the co-reference chain in the merged documents is not accurate.
On average, out of 27 people per input cluster of documents, 4 people are lost in the
matching step for a variety of reasons such as errors in the clause identifier or the
co-reference.

4.1.2 Data Labeling. We are interested in acquiring labeled data for familiarity (whether a
person is likely to be hearer-old or hearer-new) and global salience (whether a person is
a major or minor character in the news story). We now describe how we create labeled
data for each of these distinctions.

Hearer-old vs. hearer-new. Entities were automatically labeled as hearer-old or hearer-
new by analyzing the syntactic form that human summarizers used for initial refer-
ences to them. The labeling rests on the assumption that the people who produced
the summaries used their own prior knowledge in choosing appropriate references
for the summary. Thus, they could refer to people they regarded as familiar to the
general public using short forms such as (1) title or role + surname or (2) full name
only with no pre- or post-modification. Entities were labeled as hearer-old when the
majority of human summarizers for the set referred to them using the forms (1) or
(2) (we discuss the validity of this automatic labeling process in Section 4.3.1). The
hearer-new/hearer-old distinction is dynamic; when initially unfamiliar characters (like

3 Occasionally, two or more different people with the same surname are discussed in the same set and this
algorithm would lead to errors in such cases. We did keep a list of first names associated with the entity,
so a more refined matching model could be developed, but this was not the focus of our work.

Saddam Hussein before the first Gulf War) appear in the news over a period of time,
they can become hearer-old. Thus the classification of the same person can be different
for different document sets dating to different years. From the people mentioned in
human summaries, we obtained 118 examples of hearer-old and 140 examples of hearer-
new persons—258 examples in total—for supervised machine learning.

Major vs. minor. In order to label an entity as major or minor, we again used the human
summaries. Entities that were mentioned by name in at least one summary were labeled
major, and those not mentioned by name in any summary were labeled minor. The
underlying assumption is that people who are not mentioned in any human summary,
or are mentioned without being named, are not central to the story. There were 258
major characters whose names made it to at least one human summary and 3,926 minor
characters whose names were absent from all human summaries. The small fraction
of major entities in the corpus is not surprising, because many people in news articles
express opinions, make statements, or are in some other way indirectly related to the
story, without being central to it.

4.2 Machine Learning Experiments

Having created labeled data for classifying people as hearer-new or hearer-old and as
major or minor characters, we now proceed to learn these distinctions in a supervised
framework. For our experiments, we used the WEKA (Holmes, Donkin, and Witten
1994) machine learning toolkit and obtained the best results for hearer-old/hearer-new
using a support vector machine (Sequential Minimal Optimization [SMO] algorithm,
with default parameters) and for major/minor, a tree-based classifier (J48, with WEKA
parameters: “J48 -U -M 4”).

We now discuss what features we used for our two classification tasks (see the
list of features in Table 2). Our hypothesis is that features capturing the frequency and
syntactic and lexical forms of references are sufficient to infer the desired distinctions.

The frequency features are likely to give a good indication of the global salience of a
person in the document set. Pronominalization indicates that an entity was particularly
salient at a specific point of the discourse, as has been widely discussed in attentional
status and centering literature (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom
1993). Modified noun phrases (with apposition, relative clauses, or pre-modification)
can also signal different information status; for instance, we expect post-modification to
be more prevalent for characters who are less familiar. For our lexical features, we used
two months worth of news articles collected over the Web (and independent of the DUC
collection) to collect unigram and bigram lexical models of discourse-new references of
people. The names themselves were removed from the discourse-new reference noun
phrases and the counts were collected over the pre-modifiers only. One of the lexical
features we used is whether a person’s description contains any of the 20 most frequent
description words from our Web corpus. We reasoned that these frequent descriptors
may signal importance; the full list is:

president, former, spokesman, sen, dr, chief, coach, attorney, minister, director, gov, rep, leader,
secretary, rev, judge, US, general, manager, chairman

We also used features based on the overall likelihood of a person’s description using the
bigram model from our Web corpus. These features can help indicate whether a person
has a role or affiliation that is important.

In the experiments reported subsequently, all our features are derived exclusively
from the input documents, and we do not derive any features from the summaries. We
performed 20-fold cross validation for both classification tasks.

4.2.1 Hearer-Old vs. Hearer-New Results. We present our results for classifying people
as hearer-old/hearer-new in Table 3. The 0.54 majority class prediction for the hearer-
old/hearer-new classification task is that no-one is known to the reader. Using this
prediction in a summarizer would result in excessive detail in referring expressions
and a consequent reduction in space available to summarize the news events. The SMO
prediction outperformed the baseline accuracy by 22 percentage points (significant at
p = 0.01, z-test) and is more meaningful for real tasks.

We performed feature selection (using the WEKA CfsSubsetEval attribute evaluator
and BestFirst -D 1 -N 5 search method) to identify which are the most important features
for this classification task. The important features were: the number of appositions (fea-
tures 7, 8) and relative clauses (feature 9), number of mentions within the document set
(features 0,1), total number of apposition, relative clauses and copula (feature 12), num-
ber of high frequency pre-modifiers (feature 18), and the minimum bigram probability
(feature 17). Thus, the lexical and syntactic features were more useful than frequency
features for determining familiarity.

4.2.2 Major vs. Minor Results. For major/minor classification, the majority class predic-
tion has 94% accuracy (Table 4), but is not useful for a reference generation task as it

predicts that no person should be mentioned by name and all are minor characters.
The machine learning approach improves on the baseline accuracy by two percentage
points, which is statistically significant (z-test; p < 0.01). Due to the skewed nature of
our data, precision/recall measures are more useful for analyzing our results. Table 4
shows the performance of the machine learner with different combinations of frequency
and lexical and syntactic features. The best results are obtained using all three types of
features and it appears that all three aspects are important, yielding an F-measure of
0.60 for the smaller major-character class and and 0.98 for the majority minor-character
class.

In a task where ten 400–500 word documents are summarized into 100 words,
human summarizers can differ in their interpretations of what is most important to
convey. This is a well-established and studied fact in summarization (van Halteren and
Teufel 2003). To study how human agreement on the major/minor distinction relates
to our automatic prediction results, we further analyzed the 148 persons from DUC

825

’03 and DUC ’04 sets for which DUC provides four human summaries (there were
only two summaries provided for earlier sets). Table 5 presents the distribution of
recall taking into account how many humans mentioned the person by name in their
summary (in our data-labeling, people are labeled as major if any summary had a
reference to them, see Section 4.1.2). It can be seen that recall is high (0.84) when all
four humans consider a character to be major, and falls to 0.2 when only one out of four
humans does.

We performed feature selection (using the WEKA CfsSubsetEval attribute evaluator
and BestFirst -D 1 -N 5 search method) to identify which are the most important features
for the classification task. For the major/minor classification, the important features
used by the classifier were the number of documents in which the person was men-
tioned (feature 2); number of mentions within the document set (features 1, 4); number
of relative clauses (feature 9, 10) and copula (feature 13) constructs; total number of
apposition, relative clauses, and copula (feature 11); number of high frequency pre-
modifiers (feature 18); and the maximum bigram probability (feature 16).

As for the hearer-old/hearer-new classification, the syntactic forms of references
were a significant indicator, suggesting that the centrality of the character was signaled
by journalists using specific syntactic constructs in the references. On the other hand,
unlike the case of familiarity classification, the frequency of mention within and across
documents were also significant features. This is intuitive—a frequently mentioned
person is likely to be important to the story.

4.3 Validating the Results on Current News

We tested the classifiers on data different from that provided by DUC, and also tested
human consensus on the hearer-new/hearer-old distinction. For these purposes, we
downloaded 45 clusters from one day’s output from Newsblaster (McKeown et al. 2002).
We then automatically compiled the list of people mentioned in the automatic sum-
maries for these clusters. There were 107 unique people that appeared in the automatic
summaries and 1,075 people in the input clusters.

4.3.1 Human Agreement on Hearer-Old vs. Hearer-New. A question arises when attempting
to infer hearer-new/hearer-old status: Is it meaningful to generalize this across readers,
seeing how dependent it is on the world knowledge of individual readers?

To address the question, we gave four American graduate students at Columbia
University a list of the names of people in the DUC human summaries (see Section 4.1),
and asked them to write down for each person, their country/state/organization
affiliation and their role (writer/president/attorney-general, etc.). We considered a

person hearer-old to a subject if they correctly identified both role and affiliation for
that person. For the 258 people in the DUC summaries, the four subjects demonstrated
87% agreement (κ = 0.74).4

Similarly, they were asked to perform the same task for the Newsblaster data, which
deals with contemporary news,5 in contrast with the DUC data that contained news
from the late 1980s and early 1990s. On these data, the human agreement was 91% (κ =
0.78). This is a high enough agreement to suggest that the classification of national and
international figures as hearer-old/hearer-new for educated readers is a well-defined
task.

4.3.2 Hearer-Old vs. Hearer-New Results on the Newsblaster Data. We measured how well
the models learned on DUC data perform with current news labeled using human
judgment. For each person who was mentioned in the automatic summaries for the
Newsblaster data, we compiled one judgment from the four human subjects using
majority vote (an example was labeled as hearer-new if two or more out of the four
subjects had marked it as hearer-new; the ties were resolved in favor of hearer-new as
it is better to provide an initial description of a person when unsure about the person’s
status). Then we used these data as test data, to test the model trained solely on the
DUC data. These results are reported in Table 6. The classifier for hearer-old/hearer-
new distinction achieved 75% accuracy on Newsblaster data labeled by humans (sig-
nificantly better than the majority class (hearer-new) baseline of 60.8%; z-test, p = 0.02).
This compares well with the reported cross-validation accuracy on DUC data of 76%
and indicates that the performance of the classifier is stable and does not vary between
the DUC and Newsblaster data. The precision and recall for the Newsblaster data (see
Table 6) are also very similar to those for the DUC data.

4.3.3 Major vs. Minor Results on Newsblaster Data. For the Newsblaster data, no human
summaries were available, so no direct indication of whether a human summarizer
will mention a person by name in a summary was available. In order to evaluate
the performance of the classifier, we gave a human annotator (a graduate student at
Columbia University) the list of people’s names appearing in the machine summaries,
together with the input cluster and the machine summary, and asked which of the
names on the list would be a suitable keyword for the set. Our aim here was to verify
that our classifications of people as major or minor correlate with another indicator of
importance—suitability for use as a keyword.

4 κ (kappa) is a measure of inter-annotator agreement over and above what might be expected by pure
chance (see Carletta [1996] for discussion of its use in NLP). κ = 1 if there is perfect agreement between
annotators, κ = 0 if the annotators agree only as much as you would expect by chance, κ < 0 if the
annotators agree less than predicted by chance.

5 The human judgments were made within a week of the publication of the news stories in the
Newsblaster clusters.

827



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

Out of the 107 names on the list, the annotator chose 42 as suitable for descriptive
keyword for the set. The major/minor classifier was run on these 107 examples; only 40
were predicted to be major characters. Of the 67 test cases that were predicted by the
classifier to be minor characters, 12 (18%) were marked by the annotator as acceptable
keywords. In comparison, of the 40 characters that were predicted to be major characters
by the classifier, 30 (75%) were marked as possible keywords. If the keyword selections
of the annotator are taken as ground truth, the automatic predictions have precision and
recall of 0.75 and 0.71, respectively, for the major class.

5. Using Automatically Inferred Distinctions for Generation Decisions

Having trained models to predict whether a person is a major or a minor character,
and whether the person is likely to be hearer-old or hearer-new to the intended au-
dience, we can now make informed decisions on how to generate initial references
to people in summaries. In this section, we demonstrate the predictive power of the
distinctions we have acquired, by showing how we can determine when to include the
name attribute (Section 5.1); post-modification such as apposition or relative clauses
(Section 5.2); and pre-modification using specific semantic attributes such as affiliation,
role, and temporal modifiers (Section 5.3). Then, in Section 6, we present and evaluate
our full algorithm for generating referring expressions to people in multi-document
summaries.

5.1 Decision 1: Including the Name Attribute

According to our theory, only major characters should be named in a summary. In
addition to using up words, naming minor characters can mark them as being important
and distract the reader from the main story by introducing Gricean implicatures (Grice
1975).

In our data, there were 258 people mentioned by name in at least one human
summary. In addition to these, there were 103 people who were mentioned in at least
one human summary using only a common noun reference (these were identified by
hand, as common noun co-reference cannot be performed reliably enough by automatic
means). This means that 29% of people mentioned in human summaries are not actually
named. Examples of such references include an off duty black policeman, a Nigerian born
Roman catholic priest, and Kuwait’s US ambassador.

Our WEKA machine learner for the major/minor distinction achieved a testing
accuracy of 74% on these 103 examples. In other words, we can reproduce human
judgment on which people to refer to by name in three quarters of cases. This is a very
encouraging result given the novelty of the task.

As mentioned before, different human summarizers can sometimes make different
decisions on the form of reference to use. Out of the 103 examples of people with
an unnamed reference in at least one human summary, there were 63 people who
were not mentioned by name in any summary. WEKA correctly labeled 58 (92%) as
minor characters. Out of the 40 cases where some summarizers used named reference
and others used common noun reference, 22 of these 40 (55%) were labeled as minor
characters. As before, we observe that when human summarizers generate references
of the same form (reflecting consensus on conveying the perceived importance of the
character), the machine predictions are very accurate.

828



Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown Information Status and References to People

5.2 Decision 2: Elaborating Using Post-Modification

One aspect of reference generation that is informed by the hearer-old/hearer-new
status is the use of apposition or relative clauses for elaboration. It has been observed
(Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown 2004) that, on average, these constructs occur
2.3 times less frequently in human summaries than in machine summaries. Post-
modification tends to be more lengthy than pre-modification, and by predicting when
this is not required, we can achieve large reductions in length.

To determine when an appositive or relative clause can be used to modify a refer-
ence, we considered the 151 examples out of 258 where there was at least one relative
clause or apposition describing the person in the input. We labeled an example as
positive if at least one human summary contained an apposition or relative clause for
that person and negative otherwise. There were 66 positive and 85 negative examples.
This data is informative because although for the majority of examples (56%) all the
human summarizers agreed not to use post-modification, there were very few examples
(under 5%) where all the humans agreed to post-modify. This reflects the high cost in
word count for using these forms of modification. Intuitively, it would appear that for
around half the cases (56%), it should be obvious that no post-modification is required,
but for the other half, opinions can vary.

We report that none of the hearer-old persons (as classified by the SMO algorithm)
were post-modified. Our predictions cleanly partition the examples into those where
post-modification is not required, and those where it might be. Because we could not
think of any simple rule that handled the remaining examples, we added the testing
predictions of hearer-old/hearer-new and major/minor as features to the list in Table 2
and tried to learn this task using the tree-based learner J48. We report a testing accuracy
of 71.5%, which is significantly higher than both the 56% for the majority class baseline
(z-test; p < 0.01) and 62.5% for a baseline using the original feature set without the two
information status features (z-test; p < 0.05).

There were only three useful features—the predicted hearer-new/hearer-old status,
the number of high frequency pre-modifiers for that person in the input (feature 18
in Table 2), and the average number of post-modified initial references in the input
documents (feature 12).

5.3 Decision 3: Including Pre-Modifying Attributes

As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, our analysis of pre-modification in initial references
to people in DUC human summaries showed that 71% of pre-modifying words were
either title or role words or temporal role modifying adjectives. Affiliations constituted
22% of pre-modifying words and all other pre-modifying words, such as moderate or
loyal constituted only 7%. We therefore only consider the inclusion of roles, temporal
modifiers, and affiliations in this section.

5.3.1 Including Role and Temporal Modification Attributes. The DUC human summarizers
tended to follow journalistic conventions regarding the inclusion of a title or role in
initial references to people. Indeed a simple rule—to always include the role/title in
initial references—reproduced the choices made by the human summarizers in 79% of
cases. A manual analysis of cases where human summarizers omitted title/role words
revealed some insights. There were a small number of historical figures (e.g., Galileo and
Napoleon) and people from the entertainment industry (e.g., Robert Redford and Yoko Ono)
who were always referred to only by name. Otherwise, the main factor appears to be

829



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

notoriety. People who were almost never referred to with a title or role include Moammar
Gadhafi, Osama bin Laden, Fidel Castro, Yasser Arafat, and Boris Yeltsin. Others who were
referred to both with and without a title/role by different human summarizers include
George Bush, Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, Michael Gorbachev, and Slobodan Milosevic.
As we have no insights as to how to model notoriety, we did not try to improve on this
“always include” baseline, but we can nonetheless suggest that for greater compression,
the role or title can be omitted for hearer-old persons; for example, generating Margaret
Thatcher instead of Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

5.3.2 Including Affiliation Attributes. We now describe a procedure that uses hearer and
discourse information to decide when to provide an affiliation in the initial reference
to a person. This issue is ubiquitous in summarizing news; for example, the reference
generator might need to decide between White House Press Secretary James Brady and
Press Secretary James Brady, between Soviet President Gorbachev and President Gorbachev,
or between Indiana Senator Dan Quayle and Senator Dan Quayle.

1. IF:
(a) the person is classified as hearer-old OR

(b) the person’s organization (country/ state/ affiliation) has been already mentioned
AND is the most salient organization in the discourse at the point where the
reference needs to be generated

THEN the affiliation of a person can be omitted in the discourse-new reference.

Algorithm 2: Omitting the affiliation in a discourse-new reference.

Based on our intuitions about discourse salience and information status, we initially
postulated the decision procedure in Algorithm 2. We described how we make the
hearer-new/hearer-old judgment in Section 4.2. We used a salience-list (S-List) (Strube
1998) to determine the salience of organizations. This is a shallow attentional-state
model and works as follows:

1. Within a sentence, entities are added to the salience-list from left to right.

2. Within the discourse, sentences are considered from right to left.

In other words, entities in more recent sentences are more salient than those in previous
ones, and within a sentence, earlier references are more salient than later ones.

Results. To make the evaluation meaningful, we only considered examples where there
was an affiliation mentioned for the person in the input documents, ruling out the trivial
cases where there was no choice to be made (i.e., an affiliation could never be included).
There were 272 initial references to 182 persons in the human summaries that met this
criterion (note that there were multiple human summaries for each document set).

We used 139 of these 272 examples (from DUC ’01, ’02, and ’03) as training data to
check and possibly refine our rule. For each of these 139 initial references to people, we:

1. Obtained from the source news reports the test-set prediction from WEKA on
whether that person was hearer-new or hearer-old.

2. Formed the S-List for affiliations in that human summary at the point of reference.6

3. Used the decision procedure in Algorithm 2 to decide whether or not to include the
affiliation in the reference.

The evaluation consisted of matching our predictions with the observed references
in the human summaries. Our decision procedure made the correct decision in 71%
of the instances and successfully modeled variations in the initial references used by
different human summarizers for the same document set:

1. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was re-elected in the...
[hearer-new and Brazil not in context]

2. Brazil’s economic woes dominated the political scene as President Cardoso...
[hearer-new and Brazil most salient country in context]

It also modeled variation in initial references to the same person across summaries of
different document sets:

1. It appeared that Iraq’s President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his
country’s financial problems and territorial ambitions...
[hearer-new for this document set and Iraq not in context]

2. ...A United States aircraft battle group moved into the Arabian Sea. Saddam
Hussein warned the Iraqi populace that United States might attack...
[hearer-old for this document set]

An error analysis showed that in most of these instances the rule predicted no
affiliation in instances where the human summarizer had included it. In many cases,
the person was first mentioned in a context where a different organization/state or
country was more salient than their own. When we modified condition (1) of our
decision rule (Algorithm 2) to obtain Algorithm 3, the accuracy increased to 78%. The
improved performance of our second decision procedure suggests that affiliation is
sometimes included in references to even hearer-old persons in order to aid the hearer
in immediately recollecting the referent. Both algorithms make errors on such cases,
however, and there appears to be some variability in how human summarizers make
their decisions in these contexts.

1. IF:
(a) the person is hearer-old, and no country/state/org is more salient than their own OR

(b) the person’s organization (country/ state/ affiliation) has been already mentioned
AND is the most salient organization in the discourse at the point where the
reference needs to be generated

THEN the affiliation of a person can be omitted in the discourse-new reference.

Algorithm 3: Omitting the affiliation in a discourse-new reference (version 2).

Having convinced ourselves of the validity of these rules, we applied them to the
133 examples in the unseen test data. The results are shown in Table 7. A total of 85%

and adjectival forms; and the named entity recognition tool IDENTIFINDER marks up organizations. The
output was manually cleaned to remove errors in named entity detection.

of the observed human references were modeled correctly by either Algorithm 2 or
Algorithm 3, demonstrating that the hearer-old/hearer-new distinction is relevant to
reference generation. The remaining errors were largely due to misclassifications of
people as hearer-new by SMO, thus leading our rule to include affiliation when not
required. We compared the rules’ prediction accuracy to that of three baselines (see
Table 7):

1. Never-Include: This is the majority class baseline that says that affiliation is always
omitted.

2. Information-Status: Always include if hearer-new, never include if hearer-old
(using testing predictions from automatic classification of information status).

3. Salience: Include affiliation unless that affiliation is already the most salient at the
point of reference.

Algorithm 2 performs significantly better than all baselines (z-test; p < 0.01),
whereas Algorithm 3 performs significantly better than the first two baselines (z-test;
p < 0.01) and for the third (z-test; p < 0.05).

6. An Algorithm for Generating References to People in Summaries

Having shown that important information status distinctions can be acquired auto-
matically (Section 4) and that these distinctions predict aspects of the content and
form of references (Section 5), we now update Algorithm 1 from Section 3 to obtain
Algorithm 4, our full algorithm for generating references to people in summaries that
takes into account the discourse-new vs. discourse-old, hearer-new vs. hearer-old, and
major vs. minor distinctions. Table 8 summarizes the accuracy of this algorithm in
predicting human generation decisions, as reported in Sections 3 and 5. Next, we report
an evaluation of the extent to which reformulating references to people impacts on the
quality of news summaries.

6.1 Evaluation of Summaries Rewritten According to Algorithm 4

We evaluated our algorithm using 14 news clusters from the Google News world news
section.7 We selected these clusters in the order they were presented on the Google
News site; we excluded three clusters that we deemed too similar to already selected

Rewrite rules for discourse-new references:

1. IF the person’s name is the head of the noun phrase THEN:
(a) IF Minor Character THEN:

i. EXCLUDE name from reference and only INCLUDE role, temporal
modification, and affiliation

(b) ELSE IF Major Character AND Hearer-old THEN:
i. INCLUDE name

ii. INCLUDE role and any temporal modifier, to follow journalistic
conventions

iii. EXCLUDE other modifiers including affiliation
iv. EXCLUDE any post-modification such as apposition or relative

clauses
(c) ELSE IF Major Character AND Hearer-new THEN:

i. INCLUDE name
ii. INCLUDE role and any temporal modifier, to follow journalistic

conventions
iii. IF the person’s affiliation has already been mentioned AND is the

most salient organization in the discourse at the point where the
reference needs to be generated THEN EXCLUDE affiliation ELSE
INCLUDE Affiliation

include post-modification

clusters, however. We used the first 10 articles in each cluster to create our 14 document
sets. We then used the freely available extractive summarizer MEAD (Radev et al. 2004)
to generate 200 word summaries for each document set. These extractive summaries
were automatically rewritten according to Algorithm 4, as described subsequently. Our
evaluation compares the extractive and rewritten summaries.

Implementation of Algorithm 4. Our reference rewrite module operates on parse
trees obtained using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning 2003). For each person
automatically identified using the techniques described in Section 4.1.1, we matched
every mention of their surname in the parse trees of MEAD summary sentences. We
then replaced the enclosing NP (includes all pre- and post-modifying constituents)
with a new NP generated using Algorithm 4. The regenerated summary was produced
automatically, without any manual correction of parses, semantic analyses, or informa-
tion status classifications. We now enumerate implementation details not covered in
Section 4.1.1:

1. Although our algorithm determines when to include role and affiliation attributes,
it doesn’t inform us as to which ones to include; for instance, a politician might
have a constituency, party, or nationality affiliation. Our implementation selects
the most frequently mentioned role (e.g., prime minister) in references to that
person in the document set, and then selects the affiliation associated with that
role (e.g., British).

2. Another situation that arises is when our algorithm prescribes the inclusion of
affiliation (or role), but our semantic tagger does not find any affiliation (or role)
for that person. In these cases, we check whether there exists any relative clause or
apposition, as post-modification is often used to introduce people without using
role or affiliation attributes. If no post-modification is available, we include the
longest initial reference to the person from the input documents.

3. Different conventions exist regarding which name of a person to use for reference.
For instance, in China it is traditional to use the first name (e.g., Chinese Vice
Premier Li Keqiang is commonly referred to in news articles as Li). We do not
claim to model such naming conventions; rather we use the co-reference chains
in our analysis to pick the most frequent name used in co-reference (see [CO]
tags in Figure 3).

In total, there were 61 references to people modified in the 14 summaries. Of
those, 34 involved shortening subsequent references. For initial references, there were
6 instances of removing affiliations, 4 of adding affiliations, and 10 of adding roles.
There were also 6 instances of post-modifications added to initial references and
1 removed.

Experimental design. The evaluation was carried out over the Internet using an
interface that, on each slide, showed the two summaries (before and after reference
rewriting) side by side with the left one labeled A and the right one B. Underneath
the summaries, there were three multiple choice questions and one free text question. A
screen-shot is shown in Figure 4. The order of presentation of summaries was controlled
for (i.e., for each summary pair, equal numbers of participants saw the regenerated
summary on the left and on the right, and for each participant, summary order on each
slide was pseudo-randomized). In order to prevent evaluator fatigue, we split our 14
summary pairs into two sets of 7 pairs, with each participant evaluating only one set.
Participants were provided with the following instructions:

To help our research into summarizing news stories, please compare the following
pairs of summaries, 7 in total. On each slide, the two summaries are quite similar,
but we would like you to tell us which you prefer, and which is more informative
and coherent. In addition, we would appreciate any subjective assessment of the
summaries, particularly with regard to the amount of information provided about
participants in the news story.

Results. Twenty participants (undergraduate and postgraduate students and research
fellows at Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University
of Aberdeen) completed the evaluation. The results are summarized in Table 9. Our
evaluation shows that reference rewriting makes sentences more coherent (significant at
p < 0.01, z-test, sample size = 140), and that this is preferred by participants (significant
at p < 0.01, z-test, sample size = 140). The loss of informativeness (significant at p <
0.01, z-test, sample size = 140) through our rewrites is not unexpected; in general we are
removing information from references, and we only rarely add information to a sum-
mary. This is evident from the summary lengths; the rewritten summary is shorter for
11 out of 14 document sets and the average word lengths of the extractive and rewritten
summaries are 189 and 178, respectively. Indeed, we found a strong correlation between

differences in informativeness and differences in summary lengths (Spearman’s rho =
.79; significant at p < 0.001). We did not find any similar correlation between differences
in summary lengths and either coherence (Spearman’s rho = .05, p = 0.86) or overall
preference (Spearman’s rho = .25, p = 0.39).

We also performed repeated measures ANOVAs on coherence, informativeness,
and overall preference, with summary-type (Extractive or Rewritten) as a within-
participant variable. For this purpose, we converted our categorical user responses (“A”,
“B”, or “Both the same”) into numerical ratings for each summary-type condition as
follows. We first mapped the choice of “A” or “B” to the summary-type and then:

� If the user selected Extractive, we used a rating of 1 for Extractive and
−1 for Rewritten.

� If the user selected Rewritten, we used a rating of 1 for Rewritten and
−1 for Extractive.

� If the user selected “Both the same”, we used a rating of 0 for both
conditions.

Then, treating participants (F1) and news clusters (items; F2) as random factors,
we found a main effect of summary-type on Coherence (F1(1, 19) = 34.20, p < 0.001;
F2(1, 13) = 3.91, p = 0.001). This analysis confirms that the improvement in coherence
is significant even when the variation between participants and items (news clusters)
is taken into account. We found a smaller by-participant effect of summary-type on
Informativeness, and no by-item effect (F1(1, 19) = 6.12, p = 0.023; F2(1, 13) = 2.24, p =
0.157). For overall preference, we found a main by-participant effect and a smaller by-
item effect of summary-type (F1(1, 19) = 10.49, p = 0.004; F2(1, 13) = 3.23, p = 0.09).

6.2 Discussion of Limitations and Scope of Algorithm 4

The evaluation described in the previous section provides us with some feedback about
the limitations of our approach, regarding the factors we consider in our algorithm as

836



Siddharthan, Nenkova, and McKeown Information Status and References to People

well as the automatic analysis we require to fully implement it. We had requested par-
ticipants to explain their decisions, and this free text feedback proved very informative.
We summarize what we learned:

� Sentence length is an important factor. Introducing post-modification into
a sentence that was already long, or removing it from a sentence that was
already short, resulted in a dispreference for the rewritten summary. Note
that sentence length is not a feature we had given any consideration to in
our algorithm.

� The lack of common noun co-reference in our automatic analysis cost us.
In one summary, there were common noun references to the widely
recognized winner of Ivory Coast’s election and the internationally recognized
winner of Ivory Coast’s presidential election. Because our analysis was unable
to co-refer these to the named reference Alassane Ouattara, the reference
rewrite module actually introduced more redundancy into the summary.

� Our strategy of selecting the most frequent role from the input was not
optimal. In more than one instance, this strategy selected the role leader,
although the original summary had a more informative role such as prime
minister. This was commented on and penalized by multiple participants
for informativeness and often for overall preference as well. Indeed, we
found our participants to be very sensitive to the choice of role modifier,
consistently penalizing summaries that omit the more specific role (there
were 17 comments to this effect, in contrast there were only 3 comments
complaining about lack of affiliation).

� Mistakes introduced during automated analysis cost us. When the Obama
administration slapped wide-ranging sanctions got rewritten as Obama slapped
wide-ranging sanctions due to incorrect NP matching, the latter was deemed
biased and misleading. There was one particular mistake in role
identification that got penalized by all participants when the algorithm
generated spin doctor David Cameron. The phrase in the input document
that got misanalyzed was Andy Coulson, David Cameron’s spin doctor.

� Participants often disagree. Two different participants provided the
following comments: ...repetition of ref expressions clarify some ambiguities
and ...introduced differently in each sentence, and that made it harder to see that
it was the same person.

In addition to these limitations that are mostly concerned with implementation
issues, we need to reiterate that our claims are genre-specific. We have studied the
nature of references to people in the newswire and news summary genres. This is in
contrast to many other studies on reference that make use of experimental data from
human reference tasks (e.g., Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2008), corpus data from dialog (e.g.,
Gupta and Stent 2005), or encyclopedic texts (e.g., Belz, Kow, and Viethen 2009). There
are big differences in how people are referred to in different genres, arising from both
linguistic conventions and the nature of the information in the genre. For instance,
encyclopedic or biographical texts about a person contain long co-reference chains,
and information about the person is provided throughout the article. Thus, subsequent
references in such genres are not straightforward, and research arising from the GREC
challenges has thus justifiably focused on modeling subsequent references.

837



Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4

The nature of references to people in the news genre is quite different. As news
articles tend to be about events rather than people, there tends to be less information
provided about the people involved in the story, and these descriptions are almost
always provided in the first reference to the person (see Study 1, Section 3). Thus in
the news genre, unlike encyclopedic texts, the task of content selection for subsequent
references to people is rather uninteresting. This is even more so for the news summary
genre, where co-reference chains are typically short, resulting in few subsequent refer-
ences to anybody. We find that for the news summary genre, the form and content of
initial reference is critical, and our studies have thus focused on this. Specifically, due
to the nature of our genre, we do not attempt to model anaphoric phenomena such as
pronouns and common noun co-reference. The studies reported in this article should
thus be seen as complementary to efforts such as GREC, and we believe that such
studies of reference in different genres are important to get a better understanding of
the phenomenon.

7. Conclusions

Our research both provides a characterization of references to people in the news genre
through empirical analysis and uses that characterization to develop a model for gen-
erating references to people in news summaries that is based on automatically inferred
information status distinctions. Because summarization takes its content from input full
text articles, one contribution of our work is the development of a statistical model for
inferring such distinctions from news reports, without requiring manual annotation.
We have shown how this model can then be used to generate appropriate references,
including semantic content selection (inclusion of name, role, and affiliation attributes)
and realization choices (use of pre- or post-modification).

References to people have very different properties from other kinds of referring
expressions (e.g., common noun references to objects). Research on the generation of
referring expressions from semantic representations is based on the notion of selecting
attributes that distinguish the object from others; in contrast, discourse-new references
to people often contain attributes in addition to the name, and yet the name alone would
be a distinguishing attribute. In this article, we have conducted corpus-based studies to
provide answers to how and when attributes are used in references to people in the
news genre. Our study characterizes the differences in discourse-new and discourse-
old references, identifies the attributes typically used in discourse-new references to
people, and provides evidence that information status distinctions (global salience and
familiarity) can determine when people are named in summaries and when additional
attributes such as role and affiliation are needed.

These information status distinctions are important when generating summaries
of news, as they help determine both what to say and how to say it. However, using
these distinctions for summarization requires inferring information from unrestricted
news. We have shown that the hearer-old/hearer-new and major/minor distinctions
can be inferred reliably using features derived from the lexical and syntactic forms and
frequencies of references in the news reports. These acquired distinctions are useful
for determining which characters to name in summaries, which characters to further
describe or elaborate on, and the forms that any descriptions should take.

Finally, we have reported an evaluation of the effect of reference rewriting on extrac-
tive summaries, demonstrating that our rewrites improve coherence and are generally
preferred by readers.
