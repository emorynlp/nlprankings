Abstract

We introduce the first end-to-end corefer-
ence resolution model and show that it sig-
nificantly outperforms all previous work
without using a syntactic parser or hand-
engineered mention detector. The key
idea is to directly consider all spans in a
document as potential mentions and learn
distributions over possible antecedents for
each. The model computes span em-
beddings that combine context-dependent
boundary representations with a head-
finding attention mechanism. It is trained
to maximize the marginal likelihood of
gold antecedent spans from coreference
clusters and is factored to enable aggres-
sive pruning of potential mentions. Exper-
iments demonstrate state-of-the-art perfor-
mance, with a gain of 1.5 F1 on the
OntoNotes benchmark and by 3.1 F1 us-
ing a 5-model ensemble, despite the fact
that this is the first approach to be success-
fully trained with no external resources.

1 Introduction

We present the first state-of-the-art coreference
resolution model that is learned end-to-end given
only gold mention clusters. All recent coref-
erence models, including neural approaches that
achieved impressive performance gains (Wiseman
et al., 2016; Clark and Manning, 2016b,a), rely
on syntactic parsers, both for head-word features
and as the input to carefully hand-engineered men-
tion proposal algorithms. We demonstrate for the
first time that these resources are not required, and
in fact performance can be improved significantly
without them, by training an end-to-end neural
model that jointly learns which spans are entity
mentions and how to best cluster them.

Our model reasons over the space of all spans
up to a maximum length and directly optimizes the
marginal likelihood of antecedent spans from gold
coreference clusters. It includes a span-ranking
model that decides, for each span, which of the
previous spans (if any) is a good antecedent. At
the core of our model are vector embeddings rep-
resenting spans of text in the document, which
combine context-dependent boundary representa-
tions with a head-finding attention mechanism
over the span. The attention component is in-
spired by parser-derived head-word matching fea-
tures from previous systems (Durrett and Klein,
2013), but is less susceptible to cascading errors.
In our analyses, we show empirically that these
learned attention weights correlate strongly with
traditional headedness definitions.

Scoring all span pairs in our end-to-end model
is impractical, since the complexity would be
quartic in the document length. Therefore we fac-
tor the model over unary mention scores and pair-
wise antecedent scores, both of which are sim-
ple functions of the learned span embedding. The
unary mention scores are used to prune the space
of spans and antecedents, to aggressively reduce
the number of pairwise computations.

Our final approach outperforms existing models
by 1.5 F1 on the OntoNotes benchmark and by 3.1
F1 using a 5-model ensemble. It is not only accu-
rate, but also relatively interpretable. The model
factors, for example, directly indicate whether an
absent coreference link is due to low mention
scores (for either span) or a low score from the
mention ranking component. The head-finding at-
tention mechanism also reveals which mention-
internal words contribute most to coreference de-
cisions. We leverage this overall interpretability to
do detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses,
providing insights into the strengths and weak-
nesses of the approach.

2 Related Work

Machine learning methods have a long history
in coreference resolution (see Ng (2010) for a
detailed survey). However, the learning prob-
lem is challenging and, until very recently, hand-
engineered systems built on top of automatically
produced parse trees (Raghunathan et al., 2010)
outperformed all learning approaches. Durrett and
Klein (2013) showed that highly lexical learning
approaches reverse this trend, and more recent
neural models (Wiseman et al., 2016; Clark and
Manning, 2016b,a) have achieved significant per-
formance gains. However, all of these models still
use parsers for head features and include highly
engineered mention proposal algorithms.1 Such
pipelined systems suffer from two major draw-
backs: (1) parsing mistakes can introduce cascad-
ing errors and (2) many of the hand-engineered
rules do not generalize to new languages or do-
mains. We present the first non-pipelined results,
while providing further performance gains.

More generally, a wide variety of approaches
for learning coreference models have been pro-
posed. They can typically be categorized as
(1) mention-pair classifiers (Ng and Cardie,
2002; Bengtson and Roth, 2008), (2) entity-
level models (Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Clark
and Manning, 2015, 2016b; Wiseman et al.,
2016), (3) latent-tree models (Fernandes et al.,
2012; Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014; Martschat
and Strube, 2015), or (4) mention-ranking mod-
els (Durrett and Klein, 2013; Wiseman et al., 2015;
Clark and Manning, 2016a). Our span-ranking
approach is most similar to mention ranking, but
we reason over a larger space by jointly detecting
mentions and predicting coreference.

3 Task

We formulate the task of end-to-end coreference
resolution as a set of decisions for every possible
span in the document. The input is a document D
containing T words along with metadata such as
speaker and genre information.

Let N = T (T+1)2 be the number of possible text
spans in D. Denote the start and end indices of a
span i in D respectively by START(i) and END(i),
for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . We assume an ordering of the

1For example, Raghunathan et al. (2010) use rules to re-
move pleonastic mentions of it detected by 12 lexicalized reg-
ular expressions over English parse trees.

spans based on START(i); spans with the same start
index are ordered by END(i).

The task is to assign to each span i an an-
tecedent yi. The set of possible assignments for
each yi is Y(i) = {�, 1, . . . , i − 1}, a dummy
antecedent � and all preceding spans. True an-
tecedents of span i, i.e. span j such that 1 ≤ j ≤
i− 1, represent coreference links between i and j.
The dummy antecedent � represents two possible
scenarios: (1) the span is not an entity mention or
(2) the span is an entity mention but it is not coref-
erent with any previous span. These decisions im-
plicitly define a final clustering, which can be re-
covered by grouping all spans that are connected
by a set of antecedent predictions.

4 Model

We aim to learn a conditional probability distribu-
tion P (y1, . . . , yN | D) whose most likely config-
uration produces the correct clustering. We use a
product of multinomials for each span:

P (y1, . . . , yN | D) =
N∏
i=1

P (yi | D)

=
N∏
i=1

exp(s(i, yi))∑
y′∈Y(i) exp(s(i, y′))

where s(i, j) is a pairwise score for a coreference
link between span i and span j in documentD. We
omit the document D from the notation when the
context is unambiguous. There are three factors
for this pairwise coreference score: (1) whether
span i is a mention, (2) whether span j is a men-
tion, and (3) whether j is an antecedent of i:

s(i, j) =

{
0 j = �
sm(i) + sm(j) + sa(i, j) j 6= �

Here sm(i) is a unary score for span i being a men-
tion, and sa(i, j) is pairwise score for span j being
an antecedent of span i.

By fixing the score of the dummy antecedent �
to 0, the model predicts the best scoring antecedent
if any non-dummy scores are positive, and it ab-
stains if they are all negative.

A challenging aspect of this model is that its
size is O(T 4) in the document length. As we will
see in Section 5, the above factoring enables ag-
gressive pruning of spans that are unlikely to be-
long to a coreference cluster according the men-
tion score sm(i).

Figure 2: Second step of our model. Antecedent
scores are computed from pairs of span represen-
tations. The final coreference score of a pair of
spans is computed by summing the mention scores
of both spans and their pairwise antecedent score.

Scoring Architecture We propose an end-to-
end neural architecture that computes the above
scores given the document and its metadata.

At the core of the model are vector representa-
tions gi for each possible span i, which we de-
scribe in detail in the following section. Given
these span representations, the scoring functions
above are computed via standard feed-forward
neural networks:

sm(i) = wm · FFNNm(gi)
sa(i, j) = wa · FFNNa([gi, gj , gi ◦ gj , φ(i, j)])

where · denotes the dot product, ◦ denotes
element-wise multiplication, and FFNN denotes a
feed-forward neural network that computes a non-
linear mapping from input to output vectors.

The antecedent scoring function sa(i, j) in-
cludes explicit element-wise similarity of each

span gi ◦ gj and a feature vector φ(i, j) encoding
speaker and genre information from the metadata
and the distance between the two spans.

Span Representations Two types of informa-
tion are crucial to accurately predicting corefer-
ence links: the context surrounding the mention
span and the internal structure within the span.
We use a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode the lexical infor-
mation of both the inside and outside of each
span. We also include an attention mechanism
over words in each span to model head words.

We assume vector representations of each word
{x1, . . . ,xT }, which are composed of fixed pre-
trained word embeddings and 1-dimensional con-
volution neural networks (CNN) over characters
(see Section 7.1 for details)

To compute vector representations of each span,
we first use bidirectional LSTMs to encode every
word in its context:

ft,δ = σ(Wf[xt,ht+δ,δ] + bi)
ot,δ = σ(Wo[xt,ht+δ,δ] + bo)
c̃t,δ = tanh(Wc[xt,ht+δ,δ] + bc)
ct,δ = ft,δ ◦ c̃t,δ + (1− ft,δ) ◦ ct+δ,δ
ht,δ = ot,δ ◦ tanh(ct,δ)
x∗t = [ht,1,ht,−1]

where δ ∈ {−1, 1} indicates the directionality of
each LSTM, and x∗t is the concatenated output
of the bidirectional LSTM. We use independent
LSTMs for every sentence, since cross-sentence
context was not helpful in our experiments.

190



Syntactic heads are typically included as fea-
tures in previous systems (Durrett and Klein,
2013; Clark and Manning, 2016b,a). Instead of re-
lying on syntactic parses, our model learns a task-
specific notion of headedness using an attention
mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) over words in
each span:

αt = wα · FFNNα(x∗t )
ai,t =

exp(αt)
END(i)∑

k=START(i)

exp(αk)

x̂i =
END(i)∑

t=START(i)

ai,t · xt

where x̂i is a weighted sum of word vectors in
span i. The weights ai,t are automatically learned
and correlate strongly with traditional definitions
of head words as we will see in Section 9.2.

The above span information is concatenated to
produce the final representation gi of span i:

gi = [x∗START(i),x
∗
END(i), x̂i, φ(i)]

This generalizes the recurrent span representations
recently proposed for question-answering (Lee
et al., 2016), which only include the boundary rep-
resentations x∗START(i) and x

∗
END(i). We introduce

the soft head word vector x̂i and a feature vector
φ(i) encoding the size of span i.

5 Inference

The size of the full model described above is
O(T 4) in the document length T . To maintain
computation efficiency, we prune the candidate
spans greedily during both training and evaluation.

We only consider spans with up to L words and
compute their unary mention scores sm(i) (as de-
fined in Section 4). To further reduce the number
of spans to consider, we only keep up to λT spans
with the highest mention scores and consider only
up to K antecedents for each. We also enforce
non-crossing bracketing structures with a simple
suppression scheme.2 We accept spans in de-
creasing order of the mention scores, unless, when
considering span i, there exists a previously ac-
cepted span j such that START(i) < START(j) ≤

2The official CoNLL-2012 evaluation only considers pre-
dictions without crossing mentions to be valid. Enforcing this
consistency is not inherently necessary in our model.

END(i) < END(j) ∨ START(j) < START(i) ≤
END(j) < END(i).

Despite these aggressive pruning strategies, we
maintain a high recall of gold mentions in our ex-
periments (over 92% when λ = 0.4).

For the remaining mentions, the joint distribu-
tion of antecedents for each document is computed
in a forward pass over a single computation graph.
The final prediction is the clustering produced by
the most likely configuration.

6 Learning

In the training data, only clustering information
is observed. Since the antecedents are latent, we
optimize the marginal log-likelihood of all correct
antecedents implied by the gold clustering:

log
N∏
i=1

∑
ŷ∈Y(i)∩GOLD(i)

P (ŷ)

where GOLD(i) is the set of spans in the gold clus-
ter containing span i. If span i does not belong
to a gold cluster or all gold antecedents have been
pruned, GOLD(i) = {�}.

By optimizing this objective, the model natu-
rally learns to prune spans accurately. While the
initial pruning is completely random, only gold
mentions receive positive updates. The model can
quickly leverage this learning signal for appropri-
ate credit assignment to the different factors, such
as the mention scores sm used for pruning.

Fixing score of the dummy antecedent to zero
removes a spurious degree of freedom in the over-
all model with respect to mention detection. It
also prevents the span pruning from introducing
noise. For example, consider the case where span
i has a single gold antecedent that was pruned, so
GOLD(i) = {�}. The learning objective will only
correctly push the scores of non-gold antecedents
lower, and it cannot incorrectly push the score of
the dummy antecedent higher.

This learning objective can be considered a
span-level, cost-insensitive analog of the learning
objective proposed by Durrett and Klein (2013).
We experimented with these cost-sensitive alterna-
tives, including margin-based variants (Wiseman
et al., 2015; Clark and Manning, 2016a), but a
simple maximum-likelihood objective proved to
be most effective.

improve state-of-the-art performance by 1.5 F1 for the single model and by 3.1 F1.

7 Experiments

We use the English coreference resolution data
from the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Pradhan et al.,
2012) in our experiments. This dataset contains
2802 training documents, 343 development docu-
ments, and 348 test documents. The training doc-
uments contain on average 454 words and a maxi-
mum of 4009 words.

7.1 Hyperparameters
Word representations The word embeddings
are a fixed concatenation of 300-dimensional
GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) and
50-dimensional embeddings from Turian et al.
(2010), both normalized to be unit vectors. Out-
of-vocabulary words are represented by a vector
of zeros. In the character CNN, characters are
represented as learned 8-dimensional embeddings.
The convolutions have window sizes of 3, 4, and 5
characters, each consisting of 50 filters.

Hidden dimensions The hidden states in the
LSTMs have 200 dimensions. Each feed-forward
neural network consists of two hidden layers with
150 dimensions and rectified linear units (Nair and
Hinton, 2010).

Feature encoding We encode speaker informa-
tion as a binary feature indicating whether a pair
of spans are from the same speaker. Following
Clark and Manning (2016b), the distance features
are binned into the following buckets [1, 2, 3, 4, 5-
7, 8-15, 16-31, 32-63, 64+]. All features (speaker,

genre, span distance, mention width) are repre-
sented as learned 20-dimensional embeddings.

Pruning We prune the spans such that the maxi-
mum span width L = 10, the number of spans per
word λ = 0.4, and the maximum number of an-
tecedents K = 250. During training, documents
are randomly truncated to up to 50 sentences.

Learning We use ADAM (Kingma and Ba,
2014) for learning with a minibatch size of 1.
The LSTM weights are initialized with random
orthonormal matrices as described in Saxe et al.
(2013). We apply 0.5 dropout to the word embed-
dings and character CNN outputs. We apply 0.2
dropout to all hidden layers and feature embed-
dings. Dropout masks are shared across timesteps
to preserve long-distance information as described
in Gal and Ghahramani (2016). The learning rate
is decayed by 0.1% every 100 steps. The model is
trained for up to 150 epochs, with early stopping
based on the development set.

All code is implemented in TensorFlow (Abadi
et al., 2015) and is publicly available. 3

7.2 Ensembling
We also report ensemble experiments using five
models trained with different random initializa-
tions. Ensembling is performed for both the span
pruning and antecedent decisions.

At test time, we first average the mention scores
sm(i) over each model before pruning the spans.

tention, features, and all word representations con-
tribute significantly to the full model.

Given the same pruned spans, each model then
computes the antecedent scores sa(i, j) separately,
and they are averaged to produce the final scores.

8 Results

We report the precision, recall, and F1 for the stan-
dard MUC, B3, and CEAFφ4metrics using the of-
ficial CoNLL-2012 evaluation scripts. The main
evaluation is the average F1 of the three metrics.

8.1 Coreference Results
Table 1 compares our model to several previ-
ous systems that have driven substantial improve-
ments over the past several years on the OntoNotes
benchmark. We outperform previous systems in
all metrics. In particular, our single model im-
proves the state-of-the-art average F1 by 1.5, and
our 5-model ensemble improves it by 3.1.

The most significant gains come from improve-
ments in recall, which is likely due to our end-to-
end setup. During training, pipelined systems typ-
ically discard any mentions that the mention detec-
tor misses, which for Clark and Manning (2016a)
consists of more than 9% of the labeled mentions
in the training data. In contrast, we only dis-
card mentions that exceed our maximum mention
width of 10, which accounts for less than 2% of the
training mentions. The contribution of joint men-
tion scoring is further discussed in Section 8.3

8.2 Ablations
To show the importance of each component in our
proposed model, we ablate various parts of the ar-
chitecture and report the average F1 on the devel-
opment set of the data (see Figure 2).

Table 3: Comparisons of of various mention pro-
posal methods with our model on the develop-
ment data. The rule-based mentions are derived
from the mention detector from Raghunathan et al.
(2010), resulting in a 1 F1 drop in performance.
The oracle mentions are from the labeled clusters
and improve our model by over 17.5 F1.

Features The distance between spans and the
width of spans are crucial signals for coreference
resolution, consistent with previous findings from
other coreference models. They contribute 3.8 F1
to the final result.

Word representations Since our word embed-
dings are fixed, having access to a variety of word
embeddings allows for a more expressive model
without overfitting. We hypothesis that the differ-
ent learning objectives of the GloVe and Turian
embeddings provide orthogonal information (the
former is word-order insensitive while the latter
is word-order sensitive). Both embeddings con-
tribute to some improvement in development F1.

The character CNN provides morphological
information and a way to backoff for out-of-
vocabulary words. Since coreference decisions of-
ten involve rare named entities, we see a contribu-
tion of 0.9 F1 from character-level modeling.

Metadata Speaker and genre indicators many
not be available in downstream applications. We
show that performance degrades by 1.4 F1 without
them, but is still on par with previous state-of-the-
art systems that assume access to this metadata.

Head-finding attention Ablations also show a
1.3 F1 degradation in performance without the at-
tention mechanism for finding task-specific heads.
As we will see in Section 9.4, the attention mech-
anism should not be viewed as simply an approx-
imation of syntactic heads. In many cases, it is
beneficial to pay attention to multiple words that
are useful specifically for coreference but are not
traditionally considered to be syntactic heads.

Our model keeps 0.4 spans per word in our exper-
iments, achieving 92.7% recall of gold mentions.

8.3 Comparing Span Pruning Strategies

To tease apart the contributions of improved men-
tion scoring and improved coreference decisions,
we compare the results of our model with alter-
nate span pruning strategies. In these experiments,
we use the alternate spans for both training and
evaluation. As shown in Table 3, keeping mention
candidates detected by the rule-based system over
predicted parse trees (Raghunathan et al., 2010)
degrades performance by 1 F1. We also provide
oracle experiment results, where we keep exactly
the mentions that are present in gold coreference
clusters. With oracle mentions, we see an im-
provement of 17.5 F1, suggesting an enormous
room for improvement if our model can produce
better mention scores and anaphoricity decisions.

9 Analysis

To highlight the strengths and weaknesses of our
model, we provide both quantitative and qualita-
tive analyses. In the following discussion, we use
predictions from the single model rather than the
ensembled model.

9.1 Mention Recall

The training data only provides a weak signal for
spans that correspond to entity mentions, since
singleton clusters are not explicitly labeled. As

our model automatically learns a useful ranking of
spans via the unary mention scores from Section 4.

The top spans, according to the mention scores,
cover a large portion of the mentions in gold clus-
ters, as shown in Figure 3. Given a similar number
of spans kept, our recall is comparable to the rule-
based mention detector (Raghunathan et al., 2010)
that produces 0.26 spans per word with a recall of
89.2%. As we increase the number of spans per
word (λ in Section 5), we observe higher recall
but with diminishing returns. In our experiments,
keeping 0.4 spans per word results in 92.7% recall
in the development data.

While the training data does not offer a direct mea-
sure of mention precision, we can use the gold
syntactic structures provided in the data as a proxy.
Spans with high mention scores should correspond
to syntactic constituents.

In Figure 4, we show the precision of top-
scoring spans when keeping 0.4 spans per word.
For spans with 2–5 words, 75–90% of the predic-
tions are constituents, indicating that the vast ma-
jority of the mentions are syntactically plausible.
Longer spans, which are all relatively rare, prove
more difficult for the model, and precision drops
to 46% for spans with 10 words.

We are looking for (a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea). (The area) is mostly
mountainous and includes Mt. Corno, the highest peak of the Apennines. (It) also includes a lot of
sheep, good clean-living, healthy sheep, and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a
little money of them.

(The flight attendants) have until 6:00 today to ratify labor concessions. (The pilots’) union and ground
crew did so yesterday.

(Prince Charles and his new wife Camilla) have jumped across the pond and are touring the United
States making (their) first stop today in New York. It’s Charles’ first opportunity to showcase his new
wife, but few Americans seem to care. Here’s Jeanie Mowth. What a difference two decades make.
(Charles and Diana) visited a JC Penney’s on the prince’s last official US tour. Twenty years later
here’s the prince with his new wife.

Also such location devices, (some ships) have smoke floats (they) can toss out so the man overboard
will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to, let the rescuer locate (them).

Table 4: Examples predictions from the development data. Each row depicts a single coreference cluster
predicted by our model. Bold, parenthesized spans indicate mentions in the predicted cluster. The
redness of each word indicates the weight of the head-finding attention mechanism (ai,t in Section 4).

9.3 Head Agreement

We also investigate how well the learned head
preferences correlate with syntactic heads. For
each of the top-scoring spans in the development
data that correspond to gold constituents, we com-
pute the word with the highest attention weight.

We plot in Figure 4 the proportion of these
words that match syntactic heads. Agreement
ranges between 68-93%, which is surprisingly
high, since no explicit supervision of syntactic
heads is provided. The model simply learns from
the clustering data that these head words are useful
for making coreference decisions.

9.4 Qualitative Analysis

Our qualitative analysis in Table 4 highlights the
strengths and weaknesses of our model. Each row
is a visualization of a single coreference cluster
predicted by the model. Bolded spans in paren-
theses belong to the predicted cluster, and the red-
ness of a word indicates its weight from the head-
finding attention mechanism (ai,t in Section 4).

Strengths The effectiveness of the attention
mechanism for making coreference decisions can
be seen in Example 1. The model pays attention
to fire in the span A fire in a Bangladeshi gar-
ment factory, allowing it to successfully predict

the coreference link with the blaze. For a sub-
span of that mention, a Bangladeshi garment fac-
tory, the model pays most attention instead to fac-
tory, allowing it successfully predict the corefer-
ence link with the four-story building.

The task-specific nature of the attention mecha-
nism is also illustrated in Example 4. The model
generally pays attention to coordinators more than
the content of the coordination, since coordinators,
such as and, provide strong cues for plurality.

The model is capable of detecting relatively
long and complex noun phrases, such as a re-
gion of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea
in Example 2. It also appropriately pays atten-
tion to region, showing that the attention mecha-
nism provides more than content-word classifica-
tion. The context encoding provided by the bidi-
rectional LSTMs is critical to making informative
head word decisions.

Weaknesses A benefit of using neural models
for coreference resolution is their ability to use
word embeddings to capture similarity between
words, a property that many traditional feature-
based models lack. While this can dramatically
increase recall, as demonstrated in Example 1, it is
also prone to predicting false positive links when
the model conflates paraphrasing with relatedness
or similarity. In Example 3, the model mistakenly

195



predicts a link between The flight attendants and
The pilots’. The predicted head words attendants
and pilots likely have nearby word embeddings,
which is a signal used—and often overused—by
the model. The same type of error is made in
Example 4, where the model predicts a corefer-
ence link between Prince Charles and his new
wife Camilla and Charles and Diana, two non-
coreferent mentions that are similar in many ways.
These mistakes suggest substantial room for im-
provement with word or span representations that
can cleanly distinguish between equivalence, en-
tailment, and alternation.

Unsurprisingly, our model does little in the up-
hill battle of making coreference decisions requir-
ing world knowledge. In Example 5, the model
incorrectly decides that them (in the context of let
the rescuer locate them) is coreferent with some
ships, likely due to plurality cues. However, an
ideal model that uses common-sense reasoning
would instead correctly infer that a rescuer is more
likely to look for the man overboard rather than
the ship from which he fell. This type of reason-
ing would require either (1) models that integrate
external sources of knowledge with more complex
inference or (2) a vastly larger corpus of training
data to overcome the sparsity of these patterns.

10 Conclusion

We presented a state-of-the-art coreference reso-
lution model that is trained end-to-end for the first
time. Our final model ensemble improves perfor-
mance on the OntoNotes benchmark by over 3 F1
without external preprocessing tools used by pre-
vious systems. We showed that our model implic-
itly learns to generate useful mention candidates
from the space of all possible spans. A novel head-
finding attention mechanism also learns a task-
specific preference for head words, which we em-
pirically showed correlate strongly with traditional
head-word definitions.

While our model substantially pushes the state-
of-the-art performance, the improvements are po-
tentially complementary to a large body of work
on various strategies to improve coreference reso-
lution, including entity-level inference and incor-
porating world knowledge, which are important
avenues for future work.
