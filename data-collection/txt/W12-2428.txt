Abstract 

A preliminary work on symptom name recog-

nition from free-text clinical records (FCRs) 

of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is de-

picted in this paper. This problem is viewed as 

labeling each character in FCRs of TCM with 

a pre-defined tag (“B-SYC”, “I-SYC” or “O-

SYC”) to indicate the character’s role (a be-

ginning, inside or outside part of a symptom 

name). The task is handled by Conditional 

Random Fields (CRFs) based on two types of 

features. The symptom name recognition F-

Measure can reach up to 62.829% with recog-

nition rate 93.403% and recognition error rate 

52.665% under our experiment settings. The 

feasibility and effectiveness of the methods 

and reasonable features are verified, and sev-

eral interesting and helpful results are shown. 

A detailed analysis for recognizing symptom 

names from FCRs of TCM is presented 

through analyzing labeling results of CRFs. 

1 Introduction* 

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a comple-

mentary medical theory to western medicine, pro-

vides a distinct way to view our human life (Pal, 

2002; Barnes, et al., 2004; Molassiotis, et al., 

2005). Moreover, it has shown that TCM 

knowledge, which is accumulated in clinical prac-

tice, has become one of the most important sources 

of modern biomedical research (Zhou, et al., 2010).

In recent years, Data Mining and Machine 

Learning have been more than ever before applied 

to TCM clinical research, such as establishing 

TCM diagnosis expert systems for supporting deci-

sion making (Wang, et al., 2004; Huang and Chen, 

2007; Zhang, et al., 2008). However, most of the 

works are based on manually well-structured da-

tasets. 

Because of the high cost of manually structuring 

and maintaining free-text clinical records (FCRs) 

of TCM, large volume of such datasets has not 

been exploited effectively (Zhou, et al., 2010), alt-

hough they are significant for discovering new 

knowledge or capturing medical regularities. 

Therefore, developing appropriate information ex-

traction methods for handling FCRs of TCM is an 

urgent need to reduce the manual labor for re-

searchers. 

Automatically extracting meaningful infor-

mation and knowledge from FCRs of TCM is chal-

lenging in Data Mining and Machine Learning 

fields (Zhou, et al., 2010). As the basis, symptom 

name recognition or extraction from FCRs of TCM 

is in an early stage. To the best of our knowledge, 

there has little work to solve this problem (Wang, 

et al., 2010; Wang, et al., 2012). Symptom name 

recognition from FCRs of TCM was firstly at-

tempted in (Wang, et al., 2010) through normaliz-

ing the symptom names in clinical records based 

on literal similarity and remedy-based similarity 

methods but not directly recognizing original clini-

cal symptom names from FCRs of TCM. In 2012, 

Wang, et al. proposed a framework of automatic 

diagnosis of TCM for practice. Symptom name 

recognition is one part of the framework and simp-

223



ly attempted through a literal similarity method 

without detailed analysis (summarized procedures 

for the previous wok are shown in figure 1). 

 

Figure 1. Simple Conclusions of the Previous Work. 

Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been 

widely studied. There have been lots of methods 

for Chinese NER (Zhang, et al., 2003; Wu, et al., 

2003; Gao, et al., 2005; Fu and Luke, 2005; Zhou, 

2006; Duan and Zhang, 2011). However, these 

methods cannot be directly applied on symptom 

name recognition from FCRs of TCM due to big 

differences of characteristics of the corpus (Wang, 

et al., 2012). There are also several related work on 

English NER, but Chinese NER has more chal-

lenges because of the distinct characteristics of 

Chinese (Wu, et al., 2003). 

In this paper, the task of symptom name recog-

nition from FCRs of TCM is studied. The symp-

tom names are recognized through finding their 

description boundaries from FCRs of TCM, and 

the method is described in section 2. Several rea-

sonable and helpful features are introduced for 

CRFs to label the characters in FCRs of TCM with 

pre-defined boundary tags to indicate their roles (a 

beginning, inside or outside part of a symptom 

name) (presented in section 3). At last, several in-

teresting and valuable experimental results are 

shown in section 4 and a conclusion is given in 

section 5. 

2 Symptom Name Recognition from FCRs 
of TCM 

The task of symptom name recognition from FCRs 

of TCM can be treated as detecting the boundaries 

of the symptom name descriptions in the sentences 

of FCRs of TCM. Therefore, this task can be 

viewed as labeling each tagging unit (e.g. word) in 

the sentences with a pre-defined tag indicating 

whether the unit is a beginning, inside, or outside 

part of a symptom name. 

Generally, the tagging unit is word (Ramshaw 

and Marcus, 1995). However, there is no natural 

segmentation for words in Chinese sentences. 

Therefore, Chinese word segmentation problem 

has to face up firstly (Gao, et al., 2005). Because of 

the characteristics of FCRs of TCM (Wang, et al., 

2012), automatically segmenting FCRs of TCM 

into words is not trivial and common Chinese word 

segmentation methods are not suitable. In order to 

tackle this problem, Chinese character is settled as 

the basic tagging unit. An example sentence of the 

labeling task is shown in figure 2. 

 

Figure 2. An Example Sentence of the Symptom Name 

Recognition Task. 

In figure 2, each character is labeled with a pre-

defined tag (“B-SYC”, “I-SYC” or “O-SYC”). The 

meaning of each tag is defined in table 1. 

Tag Meaning 

B-SYC Beginning of a TCM symptom name 

I-SYC Inside a TCM symptom name 

O-SYC Outside the TCM symptom names 

Table 1. Meanings of the Pre-defined Tags. 

Consequently, a recognized symptom name 

should start with a character labeled with “B-SYC” 

and end before the character whose corresponding 

label changes from “I-SYC” to “B-SYC” or “O-

SYC” for the first time. The labeling task can be 

formulated as follows: 

Given a FCR 1 2x ,x ,...,xnx , where x i  is a 

Chinese character, the goal is to build a annotator 

p  to accurately label x  with the credible corre-

sponding tag sequence ( )py x , where 

1 2= y ,y ,..., yny  and y {B-SYC,I-SYC,O-SYC}n  . 

This task can be effectively done by CRFs (Sha 

and Pereira, 2003) based on a training dataset 

which is consisted of pairs of sequences ( , )x y .

3 Conditional Random Fields for Symp-
tom Name Recognition 

3.1 Conditional Random Fields 

A Conditional Random Field can be defined as an 

undirected graphical model (see figure 3) which 

consists of a sequence of vertices representing ran-

dom variables 
1 2( , ,..., )nY Y YY  and edges repre-

senting conditional dependencies, conditioned on 

1 2( , ,..., )nX X XX . The random variable iY  only 

has edges with its predecessor 
1iY   and successor 

1iY  , thus, random variables 1 2, ,..., nY Y Y  obey the 

Markov property and form a linear Markov chain. 

 

Figure 3. An Undirected Graphical Structure for a Con-

ditional Random Field. 

Then the conditional probability of a label se-

quence given an input sequence can be defined as:

where K  is the number of feature functions).   is 
a weight vector comprised by the learned weight 

k  for each feature function. More detailed de-

scription is that,

The most likely label sequence for an input se-

quence x  is:

It can be found with the Viterbi algorithm. We 

use the CRF++ tool in the experiments, which pro-

vides an efficient implementation for CRFs by us-

ing the limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm 

for training the models (Sha and Pereira, 2003; 

Lafferty, et al., 2001) and the default settings of 

CRF++ are used. 

3.2 Features for Labeling 

It is difficult to analyze the syntactic structure of 

the content in FCRs of TCM which has narrative 

form, concise style and nonstandard description 

characteristics. Therefore, no higher level syntactic 

features, such as POS tags or NP chunks, can be 

used at the moment. Through analyzing FCRs of 

TCM, two types of representative and reasonable 

features (i.e. literal features and positional features) 

are exploited. The features are introduced and their 

reasonableness is explained by examples as fol-

lows. 

Literal Features: the simplest and the most ob-

vious features for determining the boundaries of 

symptom name descriptions are literal features. For 

example, according to the observation that after a 

word which is used to specify time (e.g. “昨日” 
(yesterday)) there would usually follow a symptom 

name description, such as “肠鸣” (borborygmus). 
The best approach to get such features is to di-

vide the content of FCRs of TCM into words. 

However, as described before, Chinese word seg-

mentation is not trivial work. Fortunately, seg-

menting the content into n-grams is considerable 

and reasonable, because the indicating words 

would be mixed in the n-gram segments and could 

be helpful to determine the boundaries of symptom 

name descriptions. 

Furthermore, the FCRs of TCM have a concise 

style, i.e. the length of the clauses in FCRs of TCM 

is short and words are usually used in their brief 

form. Therefore, the n-grams as the literal features 

need not be too long. In general, the average length 

of a Chinese word approximates 2 (Nie, et al., 

2000). Consequently, the value of n  should set to 

range from 1 to 3. Moreover, according to the intu-

ition that “the distance between current character 

and its related n-grams in FCRs of TCM would not 

be too far”, the context window size, which is the 

fragment scope picking up literal features (i.e. n-

225



grams (see examples in table 2)) in FCRs of TCM, 

would not be too large. Otherwise it would bring 

about noisy information, thereby reducing the la-

beling precision. The context window size in our 

experiment is specified smaller then 4.

Table 2. Literal Feature Examples Used in the Experi-

ments. Ci is the character at current position i in one 

clause. 

Positional Features: positions of characters in 

FCRs of TCM are also helpful. They are assistant 

features to determine the boundaries of symptom 

name descriptions. 

The start of a sentence would be usually a com-

mon character (i.e. its corresponding label is “O-

SYC”) rather than the beginning of a symptom 

name description. On the contrary, the starting po-

sitions of the following clauses have higher proba-

bilities to be labeled with “B-SYC”. Taking the 

FCR “昨日肠鸣, 失气多, 心中不适” (Yesterday, 
the patient had borborygmus and more farting, and 

his/her heart was uncomfortable) as an example, it 

starts with a common word “昨日” (yesterday) 

followed by a symptom name “肠鸣” (borboryg-
mus). And at the same time, following clauses all 

start with symptom name descriptions. 

The example of positional features is shown in 

figure 4. 

 

Figure 4. Example of Positional Features. 

In figure 4, one “[SubSID-POS]” represents a 

positional feature, and SubSID is the index of cur-

rent clause in a FCR and POS indicates the posi-

tion of a character in current clause. 

4 Experiments 

In this section, the proposed method for symptom 

name recognition from TCM FCRs is evaluated, 

and the usefulness of the introduced features is 

verified based on a TCM clinical dataset. The re-

sults are depicted bellow. 

4.1 Experimental Datasets 

In this paper, a clinical record dataset (CRD) is 

used. It contains 11613 FCRs of TCM and was 

collected by TCM doctors during their routine di-

agnostic work. The Chinese characters in FCRs of 

CRD are annotated with tags “B-SYC”, “I-SYC”, 

and “O-SYC”. The number of each type of tags is 

69193, 104243 and 142860, respectively. There are 

4235 unique symptom names in CRD, and the 

amount of annotated symptom names is 69193.

CRD is divided into two sub-datasets (i.e. a 

training dataset (3483 FCRs, 25% of CRD) and a 

test dataset (8130 FCRs, 75% of CRD)). For con-

226



venience, all numbers (e.g. integers, decimals and 

fractions, etc.) in CRD are uniformly replaced by a 

English character “N” in advance. Detailed infor-

mation of training and test datasets is listed in table 

3. 

4.2 Evaluation Metrics 

A new method for symptom name recognition 

from FCRs of TCM is proposed and two types of 

features are introduced. To evaluate the feasibility 

and effectiveness of the method and features, two 

groups of evaluation metrics are designed: (1) for 

assessing the ability of symptom name recognition, 

symptom name recognition rate, recognition error 

rate and recognition F-Measure are defined; (2) for 

giving a detailed analysis, the labeling precision, 

recall, and F-Measure are exercised. The detailed 

explanations of these metrics are described below. 

Symptom name recognition rate (RRdet), 

recognition error rate (RERdet) and recognition 
F-Measure (RFMdet): these metrics are designed 

for assessing capability of the proposed method for 

symptom name recognition from TCM FCRs. If 

and only if the boundary of a symptom name is 

labeled accurately (i.e. starting with “B-SYC” and 

ending with the first change from “I-SYC” to “B--

SYC” or “O-SYC”), the recognized symptom 

name is correct. Higher RRdet and lower RERdet are 

achieved; better symptom name recognition per-

formance RFMdet would be obtained. RRdet, RERdet 

and RFMdet are formulated as follows.

F-Measure (FMlab): the metrics (Prelab, Reclab and 

FMlab) are used to evaluate the performance of la-

beling Chinese character sequences of FCRs of 

TCM for giving a detailed analysis. They are de-

fined below.

4.3 Evaluation of Symptom Name Recogni-
tion Ability 

Comprehensive evaluations of symptom name 

recognition ability using CRFs with reasonable 

features are shown in figure 5, 6 and 7. These fig-

ures show that CRFs with reasonable features for 

symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM is 

feasible. The best RFMdet 62.829% (RRdet 93.403% 

and RERdet 52.665%) is achieved under settings 

CWS 3  and features Uni+Big+Tri used. 

 

Figure 5. Symptom Name Recognition Rate. 

It obviously shows in figures 5, 6 and 7 that lit-

eral features and positional features are helpful to 

symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM. 

More types of features are used; better recognition 

performance would be obtained in most cases. 

When CWS 1  and referred features changed 

from unigram literal features to the combination of 

unigram and bigram literal features, the highest 

growth about 3.925% of RFMdet is achieved (the 

227



RRdet increases from 87.586% to 93.034% and the 

RERdet decreases from 56.173% to 53.118%). 

 

Figure 6. Symptom Name Recognition Error Rate. 

 

Figure 7. Symptom Name Recognition F-Measure. 

As described previously, the context information 

is helpful to symptom name recognition. However, 

the context window size should not be too large. In 

figures 5, 6 and 7, it clearly shows that when CWS 

increase RRdet and RFMdet are improved and 

RFMdet is reduced. When CWS grows too large 

(larger than 3 here), RRdet and RFMdet begin, never-

theless, to descend and RERdet is raised in most 

every cases. 

Moreover, positional features are complemen-

tary features to literal features for symptom name 

recognition from FCRs of TCM. It vividly shows 

in figures 5, 6 and 7 that RRdet and RFMdet would 

be improved and RERdet would be reduced more or 

less when literal features combined with positional 

features. The highest elevation can reach 0.297% if 

the combination features of trigram literal features 

and positional features are used and CWS 1 . 

4.4 Evaluation of Labeling Performance and 
Detailed Analysis for Symptom Name 

Recognition 

In this part, firstly, an evaluation for labeling per-

formance is given, and then a detailed analysis for 

symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM 

using CRFs with reasonable features would be de-

scribed. 

The results of Prelab and FMlab under different 

situations are shown in figure 8 and 9, respectively. 

The Reclab here are all 100%. It can be seen from 

these figures that the FMlab can reach nearly up to 

97.596% with corresponding Prelab 95.305%. The 

results can also demonstrate the feasibility of the 

proposed method for symptom name recognition 

from FCRs of TCM and the worth of the repre-

sentative and reasonable features introduced in this 

paper. The properties of literal features and posi-

tional features, which are just described in section 

4.3, are also reflected in figures 8 and 9. 

 
Figure 8. Results of Prelab under Different Situations. 

 
Figure 9. Results of FMlab under Different Situations. 

Although RRdet can achieve a very high perfor-

mance, however, RERdet is also too high. In figures 

8 and 9, high labeling results was gotten. It implies 

that the probable position of the symptom name 

can be found in TCM FCRs, but the exact bounda-

ries of the symptom name descriptions cannot be 

detected accurately yet. 

More careful results are listed in table 4. In this 

table, the average labeling Prelab of labels “B-

228



SYC” and “O-SYC” are always higher than the 

global average precision, but the average Prelab of 

“I-SYC” is lower than the global average precision. 

It implies that the performance of labeling the end 

position of a symptom name description is worse 

than the other position’s. In other words, the judg-

ment on whether “I-SYC” or “O-SYC” is more 

difficult. Therefore, as the future work, how to ac-

curately determine the end of a symptom name 

description should be paid more attention to.

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, a preliminary work on symptom 

name recognition from FCRs of TCM is described, 

and a feasible method based on CRFs with reason-

able features is investigated. Through the experi-

ments, the specialties, usage and effectiveness of 

the introduced features are verified. 

In future, particular syntactic structure and 

grammatical rules for FCRs of TCM need to be 

defined and studied based on the characteristics of 

FCRs of TCM. On the one hand, they can help the 

TCM doctors and researchers to understand the 

clinical records deeper (Spasic, et al., 2005; Zhou, 

et al., 2010), and on the other hand, technically, 

they are good for filtering and reducing feature size 

and providing basics and adequate evidence for 

symptom name normalization process and auto-

matic diagnosis procedure.
