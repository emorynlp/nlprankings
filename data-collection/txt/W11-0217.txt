Abstract

Increasingly, as full-text scientific papers are
becoming available, scientific queries have
shifted from looking for facts to looking for
arguments. Researchers want to know when
their colleagues are proposing theories, out-
lining evidentiary relations, or explaining dis-
crepancies. We show here that sentence-level
annotation with the CISP schema adapts well
to a corpus of biomedical articles, and we
present preliminary results arguing that the
CISP schema is uniquely suited to recovering
common types of scientific arguments about
hypotheses, explanations, and evidence.

1 Introduction

In the scientific domain, the deluge of full-text
publications is driving researchers to find better
techniques for extracting or summarizing the main
claims and findings in a paper. Many researchers
have noted that the sentences of a paper play a small
set of different rhetorical roles (Teufel and Moens,
1999; Blais et al., 2007; Agarwal and Yu, 2009). We
are investigating the rhetorical roles of sentences in
the CRAFT corpus, a set of 97 full-text papers that
we have annotated using the CISP schema. Hand
alignment of the resulting annotations suggests that
patterns in these CISP-annotated sentences corre-
spond to common argumentative gambits in scien-
tific writing.

2 Methods

The CRAFT corpus is a set of 97 full-text papers de-
scribing the function of genes in the Mouse Genome

Informatics database (Blake et al., 2011). These
documents have already been annotated with syn-
tactic information (parse trees and part-of-speech
tags), linguistic phenomena (coreference), and se-
mantic entities (genes, chemicals, cell lines, biolog-
ical functions and molecular processes), making the
corpus a rich resource for extracting or inferring in-
formation from full scientific papers.

The CISP schema (Soldatova and Liakata, 2007;
Liakata et al., 2009) contains 11 categories, and sev-
eral of the categories describe the intentions of the
authors, making it well suited for markup of argu-
mentation. We chose to narrow these down to 9 cat-
egories (excluding Model and Object) during anno-
tation training; our guidelines are shown in Figure
1. We expect this schema to describe the pragmat-
ics in the text well, while still offering the poten-
tial for high interannotator agreement due to a man-
ageable number of categories. The process of mark-
ing the sentences in the CRAFT corpus according to
the CISP guidelines took one annotator about four
months.

3 Results and Discussion

Six of the 97 CRAFT papers do not follow the stan-
dard IMRaD paper structure (one was a review ar-
ticle, and five combined Results and Discussion);
these documents were eliminated from this analy-
sis. Annotation of the 91 remaining CRAFT papers
resulted in 20676 sentences. The distribution of the
annotated classes is shown in Table 1.

Our use of the CISP schema exposes an approach
for recovering two types of explanatory arguments.

ground sentences, followed by a Hypothesis, Moti-
vation, or Goal; this echoes a motif found by Swales
(1990) and Teufel and Moens (1999). We also find
another pattern that consists of a combination of Re-
sults and Observations, either preceded or followed
by a Conclusion; Teufel and Moens (1999) also find
exemplars of this maneuver, and note that it paral-
lels Swales’ notion of occupying a niche in the re-
search world. Hand alignment of CISP annotations
in Introduction and Result sections suggests that a
finite state machine may be capable of modeling the
transitions between CISP sentence types in these ar-
guments, and machine learning approaches to rep-
resent these and other patterns with hidden Markov
models or conditional random fields are underway.
