Abstract
We explore a range of features and ensembles
for the task of Native Language Identification
as part of the NLI Shared Task (Tetreault et al.,
2013). Starting with recurring word-based n-
grams (Bykh and Meurers, 2012), we tested
different linguistic abstractions such as part-
of-speech, dependencies, and syntactic trees
as features for NLI. We also experimented
with features encoding morphological proper-
ties, the nature of the realizations of particu-
lar lemmas, and several measures of complex-
ity developed for proficiency and readabil-
ity classification (Vajjala and Meurers, 2012).
Employing an ensemble classifier incorporat-
ing all of our features we achieved an ac-
curacy of 82.2% (rank 5) in the closed task
and 83.5% (rank 1) in the open-2 task. In
the open-1 task, the word-based recurring n-
grams outperformed the ensemble, yielding
38.5% (rank 2). Overall, across all three tasks,
our best accuracy of 83.5% for the standard
TOEFL11 test set came in second place.

1 Introduction

Native Language Identification (NLI) tackles the
problem of determining the native language of an
author based on a text the author has written in a
second language. With Tomokiyo and Jones (2001),
Jarvis et al. (2004), and Koppel et al. (2005) as first
publications on NLI, the research focus in computa-
tional linguistics is relatively young. But with over
a dozen new publications in the last two years, it is
gaining significant momentum.

In Bykh and Meurers (2012), we explored a data-
driven approach using recurring n-grams with three

levels of abstraction using parts-of-speech (POS). In
the present work, we continue exploring the contri-
bution and usefulness of more linguistically moti-
vated features in the context of the NLI Shared Task
(Tetreault et al., 2013), where our approach is in-
cluded under the team name “Tübingen”.

2 Corpora used
T11: TOEFL11 (Blanchard et al., 2013) This is the
main corpus of the NLI Shared Task 2013. It con-
sists of essays written by English learners with 11
native language (L1) backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese,
French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish, Telugu, Turkish), and from three different
proficiency levels (low, medium, high). Each L1 is
represented by a set of 1100 essays (train: 900, dev:
100, test: 100). The labels for the train and dev sets
were given from the start, the labels for the test set
were provided after the results were submitted.

ICLE: International Corpus of Learner English
(Granger et al., 2009) The ICLEv2 corpus consists
of 6085 essays written by English learners of 16 dif-
ferent L1 backgrounds. They are at a similar level of
English proficiency, namely higher intermediate to
advanced and of about the same age. For the cross-
corpus tasks we used the essays for the seven L1s in
the intersection with T11, i.e., Chinese (982 essays),
French (311), German (431), Italian (391), Japanese
(366), Spanish (248), and Turkish (276).

FCE: First Certificate in English Corpus (Yan-
nakoudakis et al., 2011) The FCE dataset consists
of 1238 scripts produced by learners taking the First
Certificate in English exam, assessing English at an

197



upper-intermediate level. For the cross-corpus tasks,
we used the essays by learners of the eight L1s in
the intersection with T11, i.e., Chinese (66 essays),
French (145), German (69), Italian (76), Japanese
(81), Korean (84), Spanish (198), and Turkish (73).

BALC: BUiD (British University in Dubai) Arab
Learner Corpus (Randall and Groom, 2009) The
BALC corpus consists of 1865 English learner texts
written by students with an Arabic L1 background
from the last year of secondary school and the first
year of university. The texts were scored and as-
signed to six proficiency levels. For the cross-corpus
NLI tasks, we used the data from the levels 3–5
amounting to overall 846 texts. We excluded the two
lowest and the highest, sixth level based on pretests
with the full BALC data.

ICNALE: International Corpus Network of
Asian Learners of English (Ishikawa, 2011) The
version of the ICNALE corpus we used consists of
5600 essays written by college students in ten coun-
tries and areas in Asia as well as by English na-
tive speakers. The learner essays are assigned to
four proficiency levels following the CEFR guide-
lines (A2, B1, B2, B2+). For the cross-corpus tasks,
we used the essays written by learners from Korea
(600 essays) and from Pakistan (400).1 Without ac-
cess to a corpus with Hindi as L1, we decided to la-
bel the essays written by Pakistani students as Hindi.
Most of the languages spoken in Pakistan, including
the official language Urdu, belong to the same Indo-
Aryan/-Iranian language family as Hindi. Our main
focus here was on avoiding overlap with Telugu, the
other Indian language in this shared task, which be-
longs to the Dravidian language family.

TÜTEL-NLI: Tübingen Telugu NLI Corpus We
collected 200 English texts written by Telugu native
speakers from bilingual (English-Telugu) blogs, lit-
erary articles, news and movie review websites.

NT11: NON-TOEFL11 We combined the ICLE,
FCE, ICNALE, BALC and TÜTEL-NLI sources
discussed above in the NT11 corpus consisting of
overall 5843 essays for 11 L1s, as shown in Table 1.

1We did not include ICNALE data for more L1s to avoid
overrepresentation of already well-represented Asian L1s.

3 Features

Recurring word-based n-grams (rc. word ng.)
Following, Bykh and Meurers (2012), we used all
word-based n-grams occurring in at least two texts
of the training set. We focused on recurring uni-
grams and bigrams, which in our previous work and
in T11 testing with the dev set worked best. For the
larger T11 train ∪ NT11 set, recurring n-grams up
to length five were best, but for uniformity we only
used word-based unigrams and bigrams for all tasks.
As in our previous work, we used a binary feature
representation encoding the presence or absence of
the n-gram in a given essay.

Recurring OCPOS-based n-grams (rc. OCPOS
ng.) All OCPOS n-grams occurring in at least two
texts of the training set were obtained as described
in Bykh and Meurers (2012). OCPOS means that
the open class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and
cardinal numbers) are replaced by the corresponding
POS tags. For POS tagging we used the OpenNLP
toolkit (http://opennlp.apache.org).

In Bykh and Meurers (2012), recurring OCPOS
n-grams up to length three performed best. How-
ever, for T11 we found that including four- and five-
grams was beneficial. This confirms our assumption
that longer n-grams can be sufficiently common to
be useful (Bykh and Meurers, 2012, p. 433). Thus
we used the recurring OCPOS n-grams up to length
five for the experiments in this paper. We again used
a binary feature representation.

Recurring word-based dependencies (rc. word
dep.) Extending the perspective on recurring pieces
of data to other data types, we explored a new fea-
ture: recurring word-based dependencies. A feature
of this type consists of a head and all its immediate
dependents. The dependencies were obtained using
the MATE parser (Bohnet, 2010). The words in each
n-tuple are recorded in lowercase and listed in the or-
der in which they occur in the text; heads thus are not
singled out in this encoding. For example, the sen-
tence John gave Mary an interesting book yields the
following two potential features (john, gave, mary,
book) and (an, interesting, book). As with recur-
ring n-grams we utilized only features occurring in
at least two texts of the training set, and we used a
binary feature representation.

Recurring function-based dependencies (rc.
func. dep.) The recurring function-based depen-
dencies are a variant of the recurring word-based
dependencies described above, where each depen-
dent is represented by its grammatical function. The
above example sentence thus yields the two features
(sbj, gave, obj, obj) and (nmod, nmod, book).

Complexity Given that the proficiency level of a
learner was shown to play a role in NLI (Tetreault
et al., 2012), we implemented all the text com-
plexity features from Vajjala and Meurers (2012),
who used measures of learner language complex-
ity from SLA research for readability classification.
These features consist of lexical richness and syn-
tactic complexity measures from SLA research (Lu,
2010; 2012) as well as other syntactic parse tree
properties and traditionally used readability formu-
lae. The parse trees were built using the Berke-
ley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and the syntac-
tic complexity measures were estimated using the
Tregex package (Levy and Andrew, 2006).

In addition, we included morphological and POS
features from the CELEX Lexical Database (Baayen
et al., 1995). The morphological properties of words
in CELEX include information about the deriva-
tional, inflectional and compositional features of
the words along with information about their mor-
phological origins and complexity. POS properties
of the words in CELEX describe the various at-
tributes of a word depending on its parts of speech.

We included all the non-frequency based and non-
word-string attributes from the English Morphology
Lemma (EML) and English Syntax Lemma (ESL)
files of the CELEX database. We also defined Age
of Acquisition features based on the psycholinguis-
tic database compiled by Kuperman et al. (2012). Fi-
nally, we included the ratios of various POS tags to
the total number of words as POS density features,
using the POS tags from the Berkeley parser output.

Suffix features The use of different derivational
and inflectional suffixes may contain information
regarding the L1 – either through L1 transfer, or
in terms of what suffixes are taught, e.g., for
nominalization. In a very basic approximation of
morphological analysis, we used the porter stem-
mer implementation of MorphAdorner (http://
morphadorner.northwestern.edu). For each
word in a learner text, we removed the stem
it identified from the word, and if a suffix re-
mained, we matched it against the Wiktionary list of
English suffixes (http://en.wiktionary.org/
wiki/Appendix:Suffixes:English). For each
valid suffix thus identified, we defined a binary fea-
ture (suffix, bin.) recording the presence/absence
and a feature counting the number of occurrences
(suffix, cnt.) in a given learner text.

Stem-suffix features We also wondered whether
the subset of morphologically complex unigrams
may be more indicative than considering all uni-
grams as features. As a simple approximation of this
idea, we used the stemmer plus suffix-list approach
mentioned above and used all words for which a suf-
fix was identified as features, both binary (stemsuf-
fix, bin.) and count-based (stemsuffix, cnt.).

Local trees Based on the syntactic trees assigned
by the Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), we
extracted all local trees, i.e., trees of depth one. For
example, for the sentence I have a tree, the parser
output is: (ROOT (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP have)
(NP (DT a) (NN tree))) (. .))) for which the local
trees are (S NP VP .), (NP PRP), (NP DT NN), (VP
VBP NP), (ROOT S). Count-based features are used.

Stanford dependencies Tetreault et al. (2012) ex-
plored the utility of basic dependencies as features
for NLI. In our approach, we extracted all Stanford

199



dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006) using the
trees assigned by the Berkeley Parser. We consid-
ered lemmatized typed dependencies (type dep. lm.)
such as nsubj(work,human) and POS tagged ones
(type dep. POS) such as nsubj(VB,NN) for our fea-
tures. We used count-based features for those typed
dependencies.

Dependency number (dep. num.) We encoded the
number of dependents realized by a verb lemma,
normalized by this lemma’s count. For example, if
the lemma take occurred ten times in a document,
three times with two dependents and seven times
with three dependents, we get the features take:2-
dependents = 3/10 and take:3-dependents = 7/10.

Dependency variability (dep. var.) These fea-
tures count possible dependent-POS combinations
for a verb lemma, normalized by this verb lemma’s
count. If in the example above, the lemma take
occurred three times with two dependents JJ-NN,
two times with three dependents JJ-NN-VB, and five
times with three dependents NN-NN-VB, we ob-
tain take:JJ-NN = 3/10, take:JJ-NN-VB = 2/10, and
take:NN-NN-VB = 5/10.

Dependency POS (dep. POS) These features are
derived from the dep. var. features and encode how
frequent which kind of category was a dependent for
a given verb lemma. Continuing the example above,
take takes dependents of three different categories:
JJ, NN and VB. For each category, we create a fea-
ture, the value of which is the category count divided
by the number of dependents of the given lemma,
normalized by the lemma’s count in the document.
In the example, we obtain take:JJ = (1/2 + 1/3)/10,
take:NN = (1/2 + 1/3 + 2/3)/10, and take:VB = (1/3
+ 1/3)/10.

Lemma realization matrix (lm. realiz.) We spec-
ified a set of features that is calculated for each dis-
tinct lemma and three feature sets generalizing over
all lemmas of the same category:

1. Distinct lemma counts of a specific category
normalized by the total count of this category
in a document. For example, if the lemma can
is found in a document two times as a verb and
five times as a noun, and the document contains
30 verbs and 50 nouns, we obtain the two fea-

tures can:VB = 2/30 and can:NN = 5/50.
2. Type-Lemma ratio: lemmas of same category

normalized by total lemma count
3. Type-Token ratio: tokens of same category nor-

malized by total token count
4. Lemma-Token Ratio: lemmas of same category

normalized by tokens of same category

Proficiency and prompt features Finally, for some
settings in the closed task we also included two nom-
inal features to encode the proficiency (low, medium,
high) and the prompt (P1–P8) features provided as
meta-data along with the T11 corpus.

4 Results

4.1 Evaluation Setup

We developed our approach with a focus on the
closed task, training the models on the T11 train set
and testing them on the T11 dev set. For the
closed task, we report the accuracies on the dev set
for all models (single feature type models and en-
sembles as introduced in sections 4.2 and 4.3),
before presenting the accuracies on the submitted
test set models, which were trained on the T11 train
∪ dev set. In addition, for the submitted models
we report the accuracies obtained via 10-fold cross-
validation on the T11 train ∪ dev set using the folds
specification provided by the organizers of the NLI
Shared Task 2013.

The results for the open-1 task are obtained by
training the models on the NT11 set, and the results
for the open-2 task are obtained by training the mod-
els on the T11 train ∪ dev set ∪ NT11 set. For the
open-1 and open-2 tasks, we report the basic single
feature type results on the T11 dev set and two sets
of results on the T11 test set: the results for the ac-
tual submitted systems and the results for the com-
plete systems, i.e., including the features used in the
closed task submissions that for the open tasks were
only computed after the submission deadline (given
our focus on the closed task and finite computational
infrastructure). We include the figures for the com-
plete systems to allow a proper comparison of the
performance of our models across the tasks.

Below we provide a description of the various ac-
curacies (%) we report for the different tasks:

200



• Acctest: Accuracy on the T11 test set after
training the model on:

– closed: T11 train ∪ dev set
– open-1: NT11 set
– open-2: T11 train ∪ dev set ∪ NT11 set

• Accdev: Accuracy on the T11 dev set after
training the model on:

– closed: T11 train set
– open-1: NT11 set
– open-2: T11 train set ∪ NT11 set

• Acc10train∪dev: Accuracy on the T11 train ∪ dev
set obtained via 10-fold cross-validation using
the data split information provided by the orga-
nizers, applicable only for the closed task.

In terms of the tools used for classification, we
employed LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) using
L2-regularized logistic regression, LIBSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2011) using C-SVC with the RBF kernel
and WEKA SMO (Platt, 1998; Hall et al., 2009) fit-
ting logistic models to SVM outputs (the -M option).
Which classifier was used where is discussed below.

4.2 Single Feature Type Classifier Results
First we evaluated the performance of each fea-
ture separately for the closed task by computing the
Accdev values. These results constituted the basis
for the ensembles discussed in section 4.3. We also
report the corresponding results for the open-1 and
open-2 tasks, which were partly obtained after the
system submission and thus were not used for de-
veloping the approach. As classifier, we generally
used LIBLINEAR, except for complexity and lm.
realiz., where SMO performed consistently better.
The summary of the single feature type performance
is shown in Table 2.

The results reveal some first interesting insights
into the employed feature sets. The figures show
that the recurring word-based n-grams (rc. word ng.)
taken from Bykh and Meurers (2012) are the best
performing single feature type in our set yielding an
Accdev value of 81.3%. This finding is in line with
the previous research on different data sets showing
that lexical information seems to be highly relevant
for the task of NLI (Brooke and Hirst, 2011; Bykh
and Meurers, 2012; Jarvis et al., 2012; Jarvis and
Paquot, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012). But also the
more abstract linguistic features, such as complexity

Table 2: Single feature type results on T11 dev set

measures, local trees, or dependency variation mea-
sures seem to contribute relevant information, con-
sidering the random baseline of 9% for this task.

Having explored the performance of the single
feature type models, the interesting question was,
whether it is possible to obtain a higher accuracy
than yielded by the recurring word-based n-grams
by combining multiple feature types into a single
model. We thus investigated different combinations,
with a primary focus on the closed task.

4.3 Combining Feature Types

We followed Tetreault et al. (2012) in exploring two
options: On the one hand, we combined the differ-
ent feature types directly in a single vector. On the
other hand, we used an ensemble classifier. The en-
semble setup used combines the probability distribu-
tions provided by the individual classifier for each
of the incorporated feature type models. The indi-
vidual classifiers were trained as discussed above,
and ensembles were trained and tested using LIB-
SVM, which in our tests performed better for this
purpose than LIBLINEAR. To obtain the ensemble
training files, we performed 10-fold cross-validation
for each feature model on the T11 train set (for in-
ternal evaluation) and on the T11 train ∪ dev set (for

201



submission) and took the corresponding probability
estimate distributions. For the ensemble test files,
we took the probability estimate distribution yielded
by each feature model trained on the T11 train set
and tested on the T11 dev set (for internal evalua-
tion), as well as by each feature model trained on
the T11 train ∪ dev set and tested on the T11 test set
(for submission).

In our tests, the ensemble classifier always outper-
formed the single vector combination, which is in
line with the findings of Tetreault et al. (2012). We
thus focused on ensemble classification for combin-
ing the different feature types.

4.4 Closed Task (Main) Results

We submitted the predictions for the systems listed
in Table 3, which we chose in order to test all fea-
ture types together, the best performing single fea-
ture type, everything except for the best single fea-
ture type, and two subsets, with the latter primarily
including more abstract linguistic features.

id system description system type
1 overall system ensemble
2 rc. word ng. single model
3 #1 minus rc. word ng. ensemble
4 well performing subset ensemble
5 “linguistic subset” ensemble

Table 3: Submitted systems for all three tasks

The results for the submitted systems are shown in
Table 4. Here and in the following result tables, the
system ids in the table headers correspond to the ids
in Table 3, the best result on the test set is shown in
bold, and the symbols have the following meaning:

• x = feature type used
• - = feature type not used
• -* = feature type ready after submission

We report the Acctest, Accdev and Acc10train∪dev ac-
curacies introduced in section 4.1. The Accdev re-
sults are consistently better than the Acctest results,
highlighting that relying on a single development
set can be problematic. The cross-validation results
are more closely aligned with the ultimate test set
performance.

Table 4: Results for the closed task

Overall, comparing the results for the different
systems shows the following main points (with the
system ids in the discussion shown in parentheses):

• The overall system performed better than any
single feature type alone (cf. Tables 2 and 4).
The ensemble thus is successful in combining
the strengths of the different feature types.
• The rc. word ng. feature type alone (2) per-

formed very well, but the overall system with-
out that feature type (3) still outperformed it.
Thus apparently the different properties ac-
cessed by more elaborate linguistic modelling
contribute some information not provided by
the surface-based n-gram feature.
• A system incorporating a subset of the differ-

ent feature types (4) performed still reasonably
well. Hence, it is conceivable that a subsys-
tem consisting of some selected feature types
would perform equally well (eliminating only
information present in multiple feature types)
or even outperform the overall system (by re-
moving some noise). This point will be inves-
tigated in detail in our future work.

202



• System 5, combining a subset of feature types,
where each one incorporates some degree
of linguistic abstraction (in contrast to pure
surface-based feature types such as word-based
n-grams), performed at a reasonably high level,
supporting the assumption that incorporating
more linguistic knowledge into the system de-
sign has something to contribute.

Putting our results into the context of the NLI
Shared Task 2013, with our best Acctest value of
82.2% for closed as the main task, we ranked fifth
out of 29 participating teams. The best result in
the competition, obtained by the team “Jarvis”, is
83.6%. According to the significance test results
provided by the shared task organizers, the differ-
ence of 1.4% is not statistically significant (0.124
for pairwise comparison using McNemar’s test).

4.5 Open-1 Task Results

The Accdev values for the single feature type models
for the open-1 task were included in Table 2. The
results for the test set are presented in Table 5. We
report two different Acctest values: the accuracy for
the actual submitted systems (Acctest) and for the
corresponding complete systems (Acctest with ∗) as
discussed in section 4.1.

Table 5: Results for the open-1 task

Conceptually, the open-1 task is a cross-corpus
task, where we used the NT11 data for training and
T11 data for testing. It is more challenging for sev-
eral reasons. First, the models are trained on data
that is likely to be different from the one of the
test set in a number of respects, including possible
differences in genre, task and topic, or proficiency
level. Second, the amount of data we were able to
obtain to train our model is far below what was pro-
vided for the closed task. Thus a drop in accuracy is
to be expected.

Particularly interesting is the fact that our best re-
sult for the open-1 task (38.5%) was obtained using
the rc. word ng. feature type alone. Thus adding
the more abstract features did not improve the accu-
racy. The reason for that may be the smaller train-
ing corpus size, the uneven distribution of the texts
among the different L1s in the NT11 corpus, or the
mentioned potential differences between NT11 and
T11 in genre, task and topic, and learner proficiency.
Also interesting is the fact that the system combining
a subset of feature types outperformed the overall
system. This finding supports the assumption men-
tioned in section 4.4 that the ensemble classifier can
be optimized by informed, selective model combina-
tion instead of combining all available information.

To put our results into the context of the NLI
Shared Task 2013, our best Acctest value of 38.5%
for the open-1 task achieved rank two out of three
participating teams. The best accuracy of 56.5% was
obtained by the team “Toronto”. While the open-
1 task results in general are much lower than the
closed task results, highlighting an important chal-
lenge for future NLI work, they nevertheless are
meaningful steps forward considering the random
baseline of 9%.

4.6 Open-2 Task Results
For the open-2 task we provide the same information
as for open-1. The Accdev values for the single fea-
ture type models are shown in Table 2, and the two
Acctest values, i.e., the accuracy for the actual sub-
mitted systems (Acctest) and for the complete sys-
tems (Acctest with ∗) can be found in Table 6.

For the open-2 task, we put the T11 train ∪
dev and NT11 sets together to train our models. The
interesting question behind this task is, whether it is
possible to improve the accuracy of NLI by adding

data from corpora other than the one used for test-
ing. This is far from obvious, especially considering
the low results obtained for the open-1 task pointing
to significant differences between the T11 and the
NT11 corpora.

Overall, when using all feature types, our results
for the open-2 task (84.5%) are better than those we
obtained for the closed task (82.2%). So adding data
from a different domain improves the results, which
is encouraging since it indicates that something gen-
eral about the language used is being learned, not
(just) something specific to the T11 corpus. Essen-
tially, the open-2 task also is closest to the real-world
scenario of using whatever resources are available to
obtain the best result possible.

Putting the results into the context of the NLI
Shared Task 2013, our best Acctest value of 83.5%
(84.5%) is the highest accuracy for the open-2 task,
i.e, first rank out of four participating teams.

5 Conclusions

We explored the task of Native Language Identifi-
cation using a range of different feature types in the
context of the NLI Shared Task 2013. We consid-
ered surface features such as recurring word-based
n-grams system as our basis. We then explored

the contribution and usefulness of some more elab-
orate, linguistically motivated feature types for the
given task. Using an ensemble model combining
features based on POS, dependency, parse trees as
well as lemma realization, complexity and suffix in-
formation features, we were able to outperform the
high accuracy achieved by the surface-based recur-
ring n-grams features alone. The exploration of
linguistically-informed features thus is not just of
analytic interest but can also make a quantitative dif-
ference for obtaining state-of-the-art performance.

In terms of future work, we have started exploring
the various feature types in depth to better under-
stand the causalities and correlations behind the re-
sults obtained. We also intend to explore more com-
plex linguistically motivated features further, such
as features based on syntactic alternations as used in
Krivanek (2012). Studying such variation of linguis-
tic properties, instead of recording their presence as
we mostly did in this exploration, also stands to pro-
vide a more directly interpretable perspective on the
feature space identified as effective for NLI.
