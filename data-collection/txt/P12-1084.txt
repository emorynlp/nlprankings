Abstract

Previous work on classifying information sta-

tus (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011)

is restricted to coarse-grained classification

and focuses on conversational dialogue. We

here introduce the task of classifying fine-

grained information status and work on writ-

ten text. We add a fine-grained information

status layer to the Wall Street Journal portion

of the OntoNotes corpus. We claim that the

information status of a mention depends not

only on the mention itself but also on other

mentions in the vicinity and solve the task by

collectively classifying the information status

of all mentions. Our approach strongly outper-

forms reimplementations of previous work.

1 Introduction

Speakers present already known and yet to be es-

tablished information according to principles re-

ferred to as information structure (Prince, 1981;

Lambrecht, 1994; Kruijff-Korbayová and Steedman,

2003, inter alia). While information structure af-

fects all kinds of constituents in a sentence, we here

adopt the more restricted notion of information sta-

tus which concerns only discourse entities realized

as noun phrases, i.e. mentions1. Information status

(IS henceforth) describes the degree to which a dis-

course entity is available to the hearer with regard to

the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s knowl-

edge and beliefs (Nissim et al., 2004). Old men-

tions are known to the hearer and have been referred

1Since not all noun phrases are referential, we call noun

phrases which carry information status mentions.

to previously. Mediated mentions have not been

mentioned before but are also not autonomous, i.e.,

they can only be correctly interpreted by reference

to another mention or to prior world knowledge. All

other mentions are new.

IS can be beneficial for a number of NLP tasks,

though the results have been mixed. Nenkova et

al. (2007) used IS as a feature for generating pitch

accent in conversational speech. As IS is restricted

to noun phrases, while pitch accent can be assigned

to any word in an utterance, the experiments were

not conclusive. For determining constituent order of

German sentences, Cahill and Riester (2009) incor-

porate features modeling IS to good effect. Rahman

and Ng (2011) showed that IS is a useful feature for

coreference resolution.

Previous work on learning IS (Nissim, 2006; Rah-

man and Ng, 2011) is restricted in several ways.

It deals with conversational dialogue, in particular

with the corpus annotated by Nissim et al. (2004).

However, many applications that can profit from IS

concentrate on written texts, such as summariza-

tion. For example, Siddharthan et al. (2011) show

that solving the IS subproblem of whether a per-

son proper name is already known to the reader im-

proves automatic summarization of news. There-

fore, we here model IS in written text, creating a

new dataset which adds an IS layer to the already

existing comprehensive annotation in the OntoNotes

corpus (Weischedel et al., 2011). We also report

the first results on fine-grained IS classification by

modelling further distinctions within the category

of mediated mentions, such as comparative and

bridging anaphora (see Examples 1 and 2, re-

795



spectively).2 Fine-grained IS is a prerequisite to

full bridging/comparative anaphora resolution, and

therefore necessary to fill gaps in entity grids (Barzi-

lay and Lapata, 2008) based on coreference only.

Thus, Examples 1 and 2 do not exhibit any corefer-

ential entity coherence but coherence can be estab-

lished when the comparative anaphor others is re-

solved to others than freeway survivor Buck Helm,

and the bridging anaphor the streets is resolved to

the streets of Oranjemund, respectively.

(1) the condition of freeway survivor Buck

Helm . . . , improved, hospital officials said.

Rescue crews, however, gave up hope that

others would be found.

(2) Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a

lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents.

Jackals roam the streets at night . . .

We approach the challenge of modeling IS via

collective classification, using several novel linguis-

tically motivated features. We reimplement Nissim’s

(2006) and Rahman and Ng’s (2011) approaches as

baselines and show that our approach outperforms

these by a large margin for both coarse- and fine-

grained IS classification.

2 Related Work

IS annotation schemes and corpora. We en-

hance the approach in Nissim et al. (2004) in two

major ways (see also Section 3.1). First, compar-

ative anaphora are not specifically handled in Nis-

sim et al. (2004) (and follow-on work such as Ritz

et al. (2008) and Riester et al. (2010)), although

some of them might be included in their respective

bridging subcategories. Second, we apply the

annotation scheme reliably to a new genre, namely

news. This is a non-trivial extension: Ritz et al.

(2008) applied a variation of the Nissim et al. (2004)

scheme to a small set of 220 NPs in a German

news/commentary corpus but found that reliability

then dropped significantly to the range of κ = 0.55

to 0.60. They attributed this to the higher syntac-

tic complexity and semantic vagueness in the com-

mentary corpus. Riester et al. (2010) annotated a

pus. The mention in question is typed in boldface; antecedents,

where applicable, are displayed in italics.

German news corpus marginally reliable (κ = 0.66)

for their overall scheme but their confusion ma-

trix shows even lower reliability for several subcate-

gories, most importantly deixis and bridging.

While standard coreference corpora do not con-

tain IS annotation, some corpora annotated for

bridging are emerging (Poesio, 2004; Korzen and

Buch-Kromann, 2011) but they are (i) not annotated

for comparative anaphora or other IS categories, (ii)

often not tested for reliability or reach only low reli-

ability, (iii) often very small (Poesio, 2004).

To the best of our knowledge, we therefore

present the first English corpus reliably annotated

for a wide range of IS categories as well as full

anaphoric information for three main anaphora types

(coreference, bridging, comparative).

Automatic recognition of IS. Vieira and Poesio

(2000) describe heuristics for processing definite de-

scriptions in news text. As their approach is re-

stricted to definites, they only analyse a subset of

the mentions we consider carrying IS. Siddharthan

et al. (2011) also concentrate on a subproblem of IS

only, namely the hearer-old/hearer-new distinctions

for person proper names.

Nissim (2006) and Rahman and Ng (2011) both

present algorithms for IS detection on Nissim et

al.’s (2004) Switchboard corpus. Both papers treat

IS classification as a local classification problem

whereas we look at dependencies between the IS

status of different mentions, leading to collective

classification. In addition, they only distinguish the

three main categories old, mediated and new.

Finally, we work on news corpora which poses dif-

ferent problems from dialogue.

Anaphoricity determination (Ng, 2009; Zhou and

Kong, 2009) identifies many or most old men-

tions. However, no distinction between mediated

and new mentions is made. Most approaches to

bridging resolution (Meyer and Dale, 2002; Poe-

sio et al., 2004) or comparative anaphora (Mod-

jeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005)

address only the selection of the antecedent for

the bridging/comparative anaphor, not its recogni-

tion. Sasano and Kurohashi (2009) do also tackle

bridging recognition, but they depend on language-

specific non-transferrable features for Japanese.

3 Corpus Creation

3.1 Annotation Scheme

Our scheme follows Nissim et al. (2004) in dis-

tinguishing three major IS categories old, new

and mediated. A mention is old if it is ei-

ther coreferential with an already introduced entity

or a generic or deictic pronoun. We follow the

OntoNotes (Weischedel et al., 2011) definition of

coreference to be able to integrate our annotations

with it. This definition includes coreference with

noun phrase as well as verb phrase antecedents3 .

Mediated refers to entities which have not yet

been introduced in the text but are inferrable via

other mentions or are known via world knowl-

edge. We distinguish the following six subcate-

gories: The category mediated/comparative

comprises mentions compared via either a contrast

or similarity to another one (see Example 1). This

category is novel in our scheme. We also in-

clude a category mediated/bridging (see Ex-

amples 2, 3 and 4). Bridging anaphora can be

any noun phrase and are not limited to definite NPs

as in Poesio et al. (2004), Gardent and Manuélian

(2005), Riester et al. (2010). In contrast to Nissim

et al. (2004), antecedents for both comparative and

bridging categories are annotated and can be noun

phrases, verb phrases or even clauses. The category

mediated/knowledge is inspired by the hearer-

old distinction introduced by Prince (1992) and cov-

ers entities generally known to the hearer. It includes

many proper names, such as Poland.4 Mentions that

are syntactically linked via a possessive relation or a

PP modification to other, old or mediated men-

tions fall into the type mediated/synt (see Ex-

amples 5 and 6).5 With no change to Nissim et al.’s

scheme, coordinated mentions where at least one el-

ement in the conjunction is old or mediated are

covered by the category mediated/aggregate,

and mentions referring to a value of a previously

mentioned function by the type mediated/func.

All other mentions are annotated as new, includ-

OntoNotes, we do not consider generics for coreference.

ing most generics as well as newly introduced, spe-

cific mentions such as Example 7.

3.2 Agreement Study

We carried out an agreement study with 3 annota-

tors, of which Annotator A was the scheme devel-

oper and first author of this paper. All texts used

were from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of

OntoNotes. There were no restrictions on which

texts to include apart from (i) exclusion of letters

to the editor as they contain cross-document links

and (ii) a preference for longer texts with potentially

richer discourse structure.

Mentions were automatically preselected for the

annotators using the gold-standard syntactic annota-

tion.6 The existing coreference annotation was auto-

matically carried over to the IS task by marking all

mentions in a coreference chain (apart from the first

mention in the chain) as old. The annotation task

consisted of marking all mentions for their IS (old,

mediated or new) as well as marking mediated

subcategories (see Section 3.1) and the antecedents

for comparative and bridging anaphora.

The scheme was developed on 9 texts, which were

also used for training the annotators. Inter-annotator

agreement was measured on 26 new texts, which in-

cluded 5905 pre-marked potential mentions. The an-

notations of 1499 of these were carried over from

OntoNotes, leaving 4406 potential mentions for an-

notation and agreement measurement. In addition to

6Some non-mentions such as idioms could not be filtered

out via the syntactic annotation and had to be excluded during

human annotation.

ment for each category, where all categories but one

are merged and then κ is computed as usual. Table 1

shows agreement results for the overall scheme at

the coarse-grained (4 categories: non-mention, old,

new, mediated) and the fine-grained level (9 cate-

gories: non-mention, old, new and the 6 mediated

subtypes). The results show that the scheme is over-

all reliable, with not too many differences between

the different annotator pairings.7

Table 2 shows the individual category agreement

for all 9 categories. We achieve high reliability for

most categories.8 Particularly interesting is the fact

that hearer-old entities (mediated/knowledge)

can be identified reliably although all annotators had

substantially different backgrounds. The reliabil-

ity of the category bridging is more annotator-

dependent, although still higher, sometimes con-

siderably, than other previous attempts at bridg-

ceeds 0.80 and marginally reliable when between 0.67 and 0.80

discussion (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).

3.3 Gold Standard

Our final gold standard corpus consists of 50 texts

from the WSJ portion of the OntoNotes corpus-

The corpus will be made publically available as

OntoNotes annotation layer via http://www.

h-its.org/nlp/download.

Disagreements in the 35 texts used for annota-

tor training (9 texts) and testing (26 texts) were re-

solved via discussion between the annotators. An

additional 15 texts were annotated by Annotator A.

Finally, Annotator A carried out consistency checks

over all texts. – The gold standard includes 10,980

true mentions (see Table 3).

4 Features

In this Section, we describe both the local as well as

the relational features we use.

4.1 Features for Local Classification

We use the following local features, including the

features in Nissim (2006) and Rahman and Ng

(2011) to be able to gauge how their systems fare on

our corpus and as a comparison point for our novel

collective classification approach.

The features developed by Nissim (2006) are

shown in Table 4. Nissim shows clearly that

these features are useful for IS classification.

Thus, subjects are more likely to be old as as-

sumed by, e.g., centering theory (Grosz et al.,

798



Feature Value

full prev mention {yes, no, NA}9

mention time {first, second, more}
partial prev mention {yes, no, NA}
determiner {bare, def, dem, indef, poss, NA}
NP type {pronoun, common, proper, other}
NP length numeric

grammatical role {subject, subjpass, pp, other}

Table 4: Nissim’s (2006) feature set

1995). Also, previously unmentioned proper names

are more likely to be hearer-old and therefore

mediated/knowledge, although their exact sta-

tus will depend on how well known a particular

proper name is.

Rahman and Ng (2011) add all unigrams appear-

ing in any mention in the training set as features.

They also integrated (via a convolution tree-kernel

SVM (Collins and Duffy, 2001)) partial parse trees

that capture the generalised syntactic context of a

mention e and include the mention’s parent and sib-

ling nodes without lexical leaves. However, they use

no structure underneath the mention node e itself,

assuming that “any NP-internal information has pre-

sumably been captured by the flat features”.

To these feature sets, we add a small set of other

local features otherlocal. These track partial previ-

ous mentions by also counting partial previous men-

tion time as well as the previous mention of con-

tent words only. We also add a mention’s number as

one of singular, plural or unknown, and whether the

mention is modified by an adjective. Another feature

encapsulates whether the mention is modified by a

comparative marker, using a small set of 10 markers

such as another, such, similar . . . and the presence

of adjectives or adverbs in the comparative. Finally,

we include the mention’s semantic class as one of 12

coarse-grained classes, including location, organisa-

tion, person and several classes for numbers (such as

date, money or percent).

4.2 Relations for Collective Classification

Both Nissim (2006) and Rahman and Ng (2011)

classify each mention individually in a standard su-

pervised ML setting, not considering potential de-

pendencies between the IS categories of different

9We changed the value of “full prev mention” from “nu-

meric’ to {yes, no, NA}.

mentions. However, collective or joint classifica-

tion has made substantial impact in other NLP tasks,

such as opinion mining (Pang and Lee, 2004; Soma-

sundaran et al., 2009), text categorization (Yang et

al., 2002; Taskar et al., 2002) and the related task of

coreference resolution (Denis and Baldridge, 2007).

We investigate two types of relations between men-

tions that might impact on IS classification.

Syntactic parent-child relations. Two media-

ted subcategories account for accessibility via syn-

tactic links to another old or mediated men-

tion: mediated/synt is used when at least one

child of a mention is mediated or old, with child

relations restricted to pre- or postnominal posses-

sives as well as PP children in our scheme (see Sec-

tion 3.1). mediated/aggregate is for coordi-

nations in which at least one of the children is old

or mediated. In these two cases, a mention’s

IS depends directly on the IS of its children. We

therefore link a mention m1 to a mention m2 via a

hasChild relation if (i) m2 is a possessive or prepo-

sitional modification of m1, or (ii) m1 is a coordina-

tion and m2 is one of its children.

Using such a relational feature catches two birds

with one stone: firstly, it integrates the internal struc-

ture of a mention into the algorithm, which Rah-

man and Ng (2011) ignore; secondly, it captures de-

pendencies between parent and child classification,

which would not be possible if we integrated the in-

ternal structure via flat features or additional tree

kernels. We hypothesise that the higher syntactic

complexity of our news genre (14.5% of all men-

tions are mediated/synt) will make this feature

highly effective in distinguishing between new and

mediated categories.

Syntactic precedence relations. IS is said to in-

fluence word order (Birner and Ward, 1998; Cahill

and Riester, 2009) and this fact has been exploited

in work on generation (Prevost, 1996; Filippova and

Strube, 2007; Cahill and Riester, 2009). Therefore,

we integrate dependencies between the IS classifica-

tion of mentions in precedence relations.

m1 precedes m2 if (i) m1 and m2 are in the same

clause, allowing for trace subjects in gerund and in-

finitive constructions, (ii) m1 and m2 are dependent

on the same verb or noun, allowing for interven-

ing nodes via modal, auxiliary, gerund and infinitive

799



constructions, (iii) m1 is neither a child nor a parent

of m2, and (iv) m1 occurs before m2.

For Example 8 (slightly simplified) we extract the

precedence relations shown in Table 5.

(8) She was sent by her mother to a white

woman’s house to do chores in exchange for

meals and a place to sleep.

(She)old >p (her mother)med/synt
(She)old >p (a white-woman’s house)new
(She)old >p (chores)new
(She)old >p (exchange .....sleep)new
(her mother)med/synt >p (a white woman’s house)new
(chores)new >p (exchange . . . sleep)new
(meals)new >p (a place to sleep)new

Table 5: Precedence Relations for Example 8. She is a

trace subject for do.

Proper names behave differently from common

nouns. For example, they can occur at many differ-

ent places in the clause when functioning as spatial

or temporal scene-setting elements, such as In New

York. We therefore exclude all precedence relations

where one element of the pair is a proper name.

We extract 2855 precedence relations. Table 6

shows the statistics on precedence with the first men-

tion in a pair in rows and the second in columns. Me-

diated and new mentions indeed rarely precede old

mentions, so that precedence should improve sepa-

rating of old vs other mentions.

5 Experiments

5.1 Experimental Setup

We use our gold standard corpus (see Section 3.3)

via 10-fold cross-validation on documents for all ex-

periments. Following Nissim (2006) and Rahman

and Ng (2011), we perform all experiments on gold

standard mentions and use the human WSJ syntac-

tic annotation for feature extraction, when neces-

sary. For the extraction of semantic class, we use

OntoNotes entity type annotation for proper names

and an automatic assignment of semantic class via

WordNet hypernyms for common nouns.

Coarse-grained versions of all algorithms distin-

guish only between the three old, mediated,

new categories. Fine-grained versions distinguish

between the categories old, the six mediated

subtypes, and new. We report overall accuracy as

well as precision, recall and F-measure per category.

Significance tests are conducted using McNemar’s

test on overall algorithm accuracy, at the level of 1%.

5.2 Local Classifiers

We reimplemented the algorithms in Nissim (2006)

and Rahman and Ng (2011) as comparison base-

lines, using their feature and algorithm choices. Al-

gorithm Nissim is therefore a decision tree J48 with

standard settings in WEKA with the features in Ta-

ble 4. Algorithm RahmanNg is an SVMwith a com-

posite kernel and one-vs-all training/testing (toolkit

SVMLight). They use the features in Table 4 plus

unigram and tree kernel features, described in Sec-

tion 4.1. We add our additional set of otherlocal

features to both baseline algorithms (yielding Nis-

sim+ol and RahmanNg+ol) as they aim specifically

at improving fine-grained classification.

5.3 Collective Classification

For incorporating our inter-mention links, we use a

variant of Iterative Collective classification (ICA),

which has shown good performance over a variety

of tasks (Lu and Getoor, 2003) and has been used

in NLP for example for opinion mining (Somasun-

daran et al., 2009). ICA is normally faster than

Gibbs sampling and — in initial experiments — did

not yield significantly different results from it.

ICA initializes each mention with its most likely

IS, according to the local classifier and features. It

then iterates a relational classifier, which uses both

local and relational features (our hasChild and pre-

cedes features) taking IS assignments to neighbour-

ing mentions into account. We use the exist aggre-

gator to define the dependence between mentions.

We use NetKit (Macskassy and Provost, 2007)

with its standard ICA settings for collective infer-

ence, as it allows direct comparison between local

and collective classification. The relational classi-

fiers are always exactly the same classifiers as the

local ones with the relational features added: thus, if

the local classifier is a tree kernel SVM so is the rela-

tional one. One problem when using the SVM Tree

kernel as relational classifier is that it allows only for

binary classification so that we need to train several

binary networks in a one-vs-all paradigm (see also

(Rahman and Ng, 2011)), which will not be able to

use the multiclass dependencies of the relational fea-

tures to optimum effect.

5.4 Results

Table 7 shows the comparison of collective classifi-

cation to local classification, using Nissim’s frame-

work and features, and Table 8 the equivalent table

for Rahman and Ng’s approach.

The improvements using the additional local fea-

tures over the original local classifiers are sta-

tistically significant in all cases. In particu-

lar, the inclusion of semantic classes improves

mediated/knowledge and mediated/func,

and comparative anaphora are recognised highly re-

liably via a small set of comparative markers.

The hasChild relation leads to significant im-

provement in accuracy over local classification in

all cases, showing the value of collective clas-

sification. The improvement here is centered

on the categories of mediated/synt (for both

cases) and mediated/aggregate (for Nis-

sim+ol+hasChild) as well as their distinction from

new.10 It is also interesting that collective clas-

sification with a concise feature set and a sim-

ple decision tree as used in Nissim+ol+hasChild,

performs equally well as RahmanNg+ol+hasChild,

which uses thousands of unigram and tree features

and a more sophisticated local classifier. It also

shows more consistent improvements over all fine-

grained classes.

The precedes relation does not lead to any fur-

ther improvement. We investigated several varia-

tions of the precedence link, such as restricting it

to certain grammatical relations, taking into account

definiteness or NP type but none of them led to

any improvement. We think there are two reasons

for this lack of success. First, the precedence of

mediated vs. new mentions does not follow a

clear order and is therefore not a very predictive fea-

ture (see Table 6). At first, this seems to contradict

studies such as Cahill and Riester (2009) that find

a variety of precedences according to information

status. However, many of the clearest precedences

they find are more specific variants of the old >p
mediated or old >p new precedence or they

are preferences at an even finer level than the one we

annotate, including for example the identification of

generics. Second, the clear old >p mediated

fers from collective classification. We hypothesise that this is

an artefact of the one-vs-all training/testing for rare categories.

and old >p new preferences are partially already

captured by the local features, especially the gram-

matical role, as, for example, subjects are often both

old as well as early on in a sentence.

With regard to fine-grained classification, many

categories including comparative anaphora, are

identified quite reliably, especially in the multiclass

classification setting (Nissim+ol+hasChild). Bridg-

ing seems to be the by far most difficult category

to identify with final best F-measures still very low.

Most bridging mentions do not have any clear inter-

nal structure or external syntactic contexts that sig-

nal their presence. Instead, they rely more on lexi-

cal and world knowledge for recognition. Unigrams

could potentially encapsulate some of this lexical

knowledge but — without generalization — are too

sparse for a relatively rare category such as bridg-

ing (6% of all mentions) to perform well. The diffi-

culty of bridging recognition is an important insight

of this paper as it casts doubt on the strategy in pre-

vious research to concentrate almost exclusively on

antecedent selection (see Section 2).

6 Conclusions

We presented a new approach to information sta-

tus classification in written text, for which we also

provide the first reliably annotated English language

corpus. Based on linguistic intuition, we define fea-

tures for classifying mentions collectively. We show

that our collective classification approach outper-

forms the state-of-the-art in coarse-grained IS classi-

fication by about 10% (Nissim, 2006) and 5% (Rah-

man and Ng, 2011) accuracy. The gain is almost

entirely due to improvements in distinguishing be-

tween new and mediatedmentions. For the latter,

we also report the – to our knowledge – first fine-

grained IS classification results.

Since the work reported in this paper relied – fol-

lowing Nissim (2006) and Rahman and Ng (2011)

– on gold standard mentions and syntactic anno-

tations, we plan to perform experiments with pre-

dicted mentions as well. We also have to im-

prove the recognition of bridging, ideally combining

recognition and antecedent selection for a complete

resolution component. In addition, we plan to inte-

grate IS resolution with our coreference resolution

system (Cai et al., 2011) to provide us with a more

comprehensive discourse processing system.
