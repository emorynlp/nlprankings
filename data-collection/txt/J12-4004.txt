We investigate the differences between language models compiled from original target-language
texts and those compiled from texts manually translated to the target language. Corroborating
established observations of Translation Studies, we demonstrate that the latter are significantly
better predictors of translated sentences than the former, and hence fit the reference set better.
Furthermore, translated texts yield better language models for statistical machine translation
than original texts.

1. Introduction

Statistical machine translation (MT) uses large target languagemodels (LMs) to improve
the fluency of generated texts, and it is commonly assumed that for constructing lan-
guage models, “more data is better data” (Brants and Xu 2009). Not all data, however,
are created the same. In this work we explore the differences between language models
compiled from texts originally written in the target language (O) and language models
compiled from translated texts (T).

This work is motivated by much research in Translation Studies that suggests
that original texts are significantly different from translated ones in various aspects
(Gellerstam 1986). Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this
observation, and Kurokawa, Goutte, and Isabelle (2009) apply it to statistical machine
translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a translation model
trained on an English-translated-to-French parallel corpus is better than one trained
on French-translated-to-English texts. The main research question we investigate here
is whether a language model compiled from translated texts may similarly improve the
results of machine translation.

We test this hypothesis on several translation tasks, including translation from
several languages to English, and two additional tasks where the target language is

not English. For each language pair we build two language models from two types of
corpora: texts originally written in the target language, and human translations from
the source language into the target language. We show that for each language pair, the
latter language model better fits a set of reference translations in terms of perplexity. We
also demonstrate that the differences between the two LMs are not biased by content,
but rather reflect differences on abstract linguistic features.

Research in Translation Studies holds a dual view on translationese, the sub-
language of translated texts. On the one hand, there is a claim for so-called transla-
tion universals, traits of translationese which occur in any translated text irrespective
of the source language. Others hold, on the other hand, that each source language
“spills over” to the target text, and therefore creates a sub-translationese, the result
of a pair-specific encounter between two specific languages. If both these claims are
true then language models based on translations from the source language should
best fit target language reference sentences, and language models based on transla-
tions from other source languages should fit reference sentences to a lesser extent yet
outperform originally written texts. To test this hypothesis, we compile additional
English LMs, this time using texts translated to English from languages other than
the source. Again, we use perplexity to assess the fit of these LMs to reference sets
of translated-to-English sentences. We show that these LMs depend on the source
language and differ from each other. Whereas they outperform O-based LMs, LMs
compiled from texts that were translated from the source language still fit the reference
set best.

Finally, we train phrase-based MT systems (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003) for each
language pair. We use four types of LMs: original; translated from the source language;
translated from other languages; and a mixture of translations from several languages.
We show that the translated-from-source-language LMs provide a significant improve-
ment in the quality of the translation output over all other LMs, and that the mixture
LMs always outperform the original LMs. This improvement persists even when the
original LMs are up to ten times larger than the translated ones. In other words, one
has to collect ten times more original material in order to reach the same quality as is
provided with translated material.

It is important to emphasize that translated texts abound: in fact, Pym and Chrupała
(2005) show (quantitatively!) that the rate of translations into a language is inversely
proportional to the number of books published in that language: So whereas in English
only around 2% of texts published are translations, in languages such as Albanian,
Arabic, Danish, Finnish, or Hebrew translated texts constitute between 20% and
25% of the total publications. Furthermore, such data can be automatically identified
(see Section 2). The practical impact of our work on MT is therefore potentially
dramatic.

The main contributions of this work are thus a computational corroboration of the
following hypotheses:

1. Original and translated texts exhibit significant, measurable differences.

2. LMs compiled from translated texts better fit translated references than
LMs compiled from original texts of the same (and much larger) size (and,
to a lesser extent, LMs compiled from texts translated from languages
other than the source language).

3. MT systems that use LMs based on manually translated texts significantly
outperform LMs based on originally written texts.

This article1 is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and describes
related work. We explain our experimental set-up, research methodology and resources
in Section 3 and detail our experiments and results in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the
results and their implications, and suggests directions for future research.

2. Background and Related Work

Numerous studies suggest that translated texts are different from original ones.
Gellerstam (1986) compares texts written originally in Swedish and texts translated
from English into Swedish. He notes that the differences between them do not indicate
poor translation but rather a statistical phenomenon, which he terms translationese. He
focuses mainly on lexical differences, for example, less colloquialism in the translations,
or foreign words used in the translations “with new shades of meaning taken from
the English lexeme” (page 91). Only later studies consider grammatical differences
(see, e.g., Santos 1995). The features of translationese were theoretically organized
under the terms laws of translation and translation universals.

Toury (1980, 1995) distinguishes between two laws: the law of interference and the
law of growing standardization. The law of interference pertains to the fingerprints
of the source text that are left in the translation product. The law of standardization
pertains to the effort to standardize the translation product according to existing norms
in the target language (and culture). Interestingly, these two laws are in fact reflected in
the architecture of statistical machine translation: Interference in the translation model
and standardization in the language model.

The combined effect of these laws creates a hybrid text that partly corresponds to
the source text and partly to texts written originally in the target language, but in fact
belongs to neither (Frawley 1984). Baker (1993, 1995, 1996) suggests several candidates
for translation universals, which are claimed to appear in any translated text, regardless
of the source language. These include simplification, the tendency of translated texts to
simplify the language, the message or both; and explicitation, their tendency to spell
out implicit utterances that occur in the source text.

During the 1990s, corpora were used extensively to study translationese. For exam-
ple, Al-Shabab (1996) shows that translated texts exhibit lower lexical variety (type-to-
token ratio) and Laviosa (1998) shows that their mean sentence length is lower, as is
their lexical density (ratio of content to non-content words). These studies, although not
conclusive, provide some evidence for the simplification hypothesis.

Baroni and Bernardini (2006) use machine learning techniques to distinguish be-
tween original and translated Italian texts, reporting 86.7% accuracy. They manage to
abstract from content and perform the task using onlymorpho-syntactic cues. Ilisei et al.
(2010) perform the same task for Spanish but enhance it theoretically in order to check
the simplification hypothesis. They first use a set of features which seem to capture
“general” characteristics of the text (ratio of grammatical words to content words); they
then add another set of features, each of which relates to the simplification hypothesis.
Finally, they remove each “simplification feature” in turn and evaluate its contribution
to the classification task. The most informative features are lexical variety, sentence
length, and lexical density.

1 Preliminary results were published in Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner (2011). This is an extended,
revised version of that paper, providing fuller data and reporting on more language pairs. Some
experiments (in particular, Section 4.2.3) are completely new, as is the bulk of the discussion in
Section 5, including the human evaluation.

van Halteren (2008) focuses on six languages from Europarl (Koehn 2005): Dutch,
English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. For each of these languages, a parallel
six-lingual subcorpus is extracted, including an original text and its translations into the
other five languages. The task is to identify the source language of translated texts, and
the reported results are excellent. This finding is crucial: as Baker (1996) states, transla-
tions do resemble each other; in accordance with the law of interference, however, the
study of van Halteren (2008) suggests that translation from different source languages
constitute different sublanguages. As we show in Section 4.2, LMs based on translations
from the source language outperform LMs compiled from non-source translations, in
terms of both fitness to the reference set and improving MT.

Kurokawa, Goutte, and Isabelle (2009) show that the direction of translation affects
the performance of statistical MT. They train systems to translate between French and
English (and vice versa) using a French-translated-to-English parallel corpus, and then
an English-translated-to-French one. They find that in translating into French it is
better to use the latter parallel corpus, and when translating into English it is better
to use the former. Whereas they address the translationmodel, we focus on the language
model in this work. We show that using a language model trained on a text translated
from the source language of the MT system does indeed improve the results of the
translation.

3. Methodology and Resources

3.1 Hypotheses

We investigate the following three hypotheses:

1. Translated texts differ from original texts.

2. Texts translated from one language differ from texts translated from other
languages.

3. LMs compiled from manually translated texts are better for MT than LMs
compiled from original texts.

We test our hypotheses by considering translations from several languages to
English, and from English to German and French. For each language pair we create a
reference set comprising several thousands of sentences written originally in the source
language and manually translated to the target language. Section 3.4 provides details
on the reference sets.

To investigate the first hypothesis, we train two LMs for each language pair, one
created from texts originally written in the language (O-based) and the other from texts
translated into the target language (T-based). Then, we check which LM better fits the
reference set.

Fitness of a language model to a set of sentences is measured in terms of perplexity
(Jelinek et al. 1977; Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983). Given a language model and a test
(reference) set, perplexity measures the predictive power of the language model over
the test set, by looking at the average probability the model assigns to the test data.
Intuitively, a better model assigns higher probability to the test data, and consequently
has a lower perplexity; it is less surprised by the test data. Formally, the perplexity PP of

802



Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation

a language model L on a test setW = w1 w2 . . .wN is the probability ofW normalized by
the number of words N (Jurafsky and Martin 2008, page 96):

PP(L,W) = N

√√√√ N∏
i=1

PL(wi|w1 . . .wi−1)

(1)

For the second hypothesis, we extend the experiment to LMs created from texts
translated from other languages. For example, we test how well an LM trained on
French-translated-to-English texts fits the German-translated-to-English reference set;
and how well an LM trained on German-translated-to-English texts fits the French-
translated-to-English reference set.

Finally, for the third hypothesis, we use these LMs for statistical MT (SMT). For
each language pair we build several SMT systems. All systems use a translation model
extracted from a parallel corpus which is oblivious to the direction of the translation;
and one of the above-mentioned LMs. Then, we compare the translation quality of these
systems in terms of the Bleu metric (Papineni et al. 2002) (as we show in Section 5.1,
other automatic evaluation metrics reveal the same pattern).

3.2 Language Models

In all the experiments, we use SRILM (Stolcke 2002) with interpolated modified Kneser-
Ney discounting (Chen 1998) and no cut-off on all n-grams, to train n-gram language
models from various corpora. Unless mentioned otherwise, n = 4. We limit language
models to a fixed vocabulary and map out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to a unique
symbol to better control the OOV rates among various corpora. We experimented with
two techniques for setting the vocabulary: Use all words that occur more than once
in the evaluation set (see Section 3.4); and use the intersection of all words occurring
in all corpora used to train the language model. Both techniques produce very similar
results, and for brevity we only report the results achieved with the former technique.
In addition, we tried various discounting schemes (e.g., Good-Turing smoothing [Chen
1998]), and also ran experiments with an open vocabulary. The results of all these
experiments are consistent with our findings, and therefore we do not elaborate on
them here.

Our main corpus is Europarl (Koehn 2005), specifically, portions collected over
the years 1996–1999 and 2001–2009. This is a large multilingual corpus, containing
sentences translated from several European languages. It is organized as a collection
of bilingual corpora rather than as a single multilingual one, however, and it is hard to
identify sentences that are translated into several languages.

We therefore treat each bilingual subcorpus in isolation; each such subcorpus con-
tains sentences translated to English from various languages. We rely on the language
attribute of the speaker tag to identify the source language of sentences in the English
part of the corpus. Because this tag is rarely used with English-language speakers,
we also exploit the ID attribute of the speaker tag, which we match against the list
of British members of the European parliament.2

2 We wrote a small script that determines the original language of Europarl utterances in this way. The
script is publicly available.

We focus on the following languages: German (DE), French (FR), Italian (IT), and
Dutch (NL). For each of these languages, L, we consider the L-English Europarl subcor-
pus. In each subcorpus, we extract chunks of approximately 2.5 million English tokens
translated from each of these source languages (T-DE, T-FR, T-IT, and T-NL), as well
as sentences written originally in English (O-EN). The mixture corpus (MIX), which
is designed to represent “general” translated language, is constructed by randomly
selecting sentences translated from any language (excluding original sentences). For
English-to-German and English-to-French, we use the German–English and French–
English Europarl sub-corpora. We extract German (and French) sentences translated
from English, French (or German), Italian, and Dutch, as well as sentences originally
written in German (or French).

100M 5,376,886 100,016,704 18.6

In another set of experiments we address the size of language models, to assess
how much more original material is needed compared with translated material (Sec-
tion 4.2.2). Because Europarl does not have enough trainingmaterial for this task, we use
the Hansard corpus, containing transcripts of the Canadian parliament from 1996–2007.
This is a bilingual French–English corpus comprising about 80% original English texts
(EO) and about 20% texts translated from French (FO). We first separate original English
texts from texts translated from French and then, for each subcorpus, we randomly
extract portions of texts of different sizes: 1M, 5M, and 10M tokens from the FO corpus
and 1M, 5M, 10M, 25M, 50M, and 100M tokens from the EO corpus; see Table 3. For even
larger amounts of data, we use the English Gigaword corpus (Graff and Cieri 2007),
fromwhich we randomly extract portions of up to 1G tokens; see Table 4. Unfortunately,
we do not know how much of this corpus is original; because it includes data from the
Xinhua news agency, we suspect that parts of it are indeed translated.

To experiment with a non-European language (and a different genre) we choose
Hebrew (HE). We use two English corpora: The original (O-EN) corpus comprises
articles from the International Herald Tribune, downloaded over a period of sevenmonths
(from January to July 2009). The articles cover four topics: news (53.4%), business
(20.9%), opinion (17.6%), and arts (8.1%). The translated (T-HE) corpus consists of
articles collected from the Israeli newspaper HaAretz over the same period of time.
HaAretz is published in Hebrew, but portions of it are translated to English. The
O-corpus was downsized in order for both subcorpora to have approximately the same
number of tokens in each topic. Table 5 lists basic statistics for this corpus.

3.3 SMT Training Data

To focus on the effect of the language model on translation quality, we design SMT
training corpora to be oblivious to the direction of translation. Again, we use Europarl

(January 2000 to September 2000) as the main source of our parallel corpora. We also use
the Hansard corpus: We randomly extract 50,000 sentences from the French-translated-
to-English subcorpus and another 50,000 sentences from the original English sub-
corpus. For Hebrew we use the Hebrew–English parallel corpus (Tsvetkov andWintner
2010) that contains sentences translated fromHebrew to English (54%) and from English
to Hebrew (46%). The English-to-Hebrew part comprises many short sentences (ap-
proximately six tokens per sentence) taken from amovie subtitle database. This explains
the low average sentence length of this particular corpus. Table 6 lists some details on
those corpora.

3.4 Reference Sets

The reference sets have two uses. First, they are used as the test sets in the experiments
that measure the perplexity of the language models. Second, in the MT experiments we
use them to randomly extract 1,000 sentences for tuning and 1,000 (different) sentences
for evaluation. All references are of course disjoint from the LM and training materials.

For each language L we use the L-English subcorpus of Europarl (over the period
of October 2000 to December 2000). For L-to-English translation tasks we only use
sentences originally produced in L, and for English-to-L tasks we use sentences orig-
inally written in English. The Hansard reference set comprises only French-translated-
to-English sentences. The Hebrew-to-English reference set is an independent (disjoint)
part of the Hebrew-to-English parallel corpus. This set mostly comprises literary data
(88.6%) and a small portion of news (11.4%). All sentences are originally written in
Hebrew and are manually translated to English. See Table 7 for the figures.

Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation

4. Experiments and Results

We detail in this section the experiments performed to test the three hypotheses: that
translated texts can be distinguished from original ones, and provide better language
models for other translated texts; that texts translated from other languages than the
source are still better predictors of translations than original texts (Section 4.1); and that
these differences are important for SMT (Section 4.2).

4.1 Translated vs. Original texts
4.1.1 Adequacy of O-based and T-based LMs.We begin with English as the target language.
We train 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-gram language models for each Europarl subcorpus, based
on the corpora described in Section 3.2. For each language L, we compile a LM from
texts translated (into English) from L; from texts translated from languages other than
L (including a mixture of such languages, MIX); and from texts originally written in
English. The LMs are applied to the reference set of texts translated from L, and we
compute the perplexity: the fitness of the LM to the reference set. Table 8 details the
results. The lowest perplexity (reflecting the best fit) in each subcorpus is typeset in
boldface, and the highest (worst fit) is italicized.

These results overwhelmingly support our hypothesis. For each language L, the
perplexity of the language model that was created from L translations is lowest, fol-
lowed immediately by the MIX LM. Furthermore, the perplexity of the LM created
from originally-English texts is highest in all experiments (except the Dutch-to-English
translation task, where the perplexity of the 2-gram LM created from texts translated
from Italian is slightly higher). The perplexity of LMs constructed from texts translated
from languages other than L always lies between these two extremes: It is a better fit
of the reference set than original texts, but not as good as texts translated from L (or
mixture translations). This gives rise to yet another hypothesis, namely, that translations
from typologically related languages form a similar “translationese dialect,” whereas
translations from more distant source languages form two different “dialects” in the
target language (see Koppel and Ordan 2011).

4.1.2 Linguistic Abstraction. A possible explanation for the different perplexity results
among the LMs could be the specific content of the corpora used to compile the LMs.
For example, onewould expect texts translated fromDutch to exhibit higher frequencies
of words such asAmsterdam or even canal. This, indeed, is reflected by the lower (usually
lowest) number of OOV items in language models compiled from texts translated from
the source language.

As a specific example, the top five words that occur in the T-FR corpus and the
evaluation set, but are absent from the O-EN corpus, are: biarritz, meat-and-bone,

808



Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation

armenian, ievoli, and ivorian. The top five words that occur in the O-EN corpus, but
are absent from the T-FR corpus, are: duhamel, paciotti, ivoirian, coke, and spds. Of
those, biarritz seems to be French-specific, but the other items seem more arbitrary.

To rule out the possibility that the perplexity results are due to specific content
phenomena, and to further emphasize that the corpora are indeed structurally different,
we conduct more experiments, in which we gradually abstract away from the domain-
and content-specific features of the texts and emphasize their syntactic structure. We
focus on French-to-English, but the results are robust and consistent (we repeated the
same experiments for all language pairs, with very similar outcomes).

First, we remove all punctuation to eliminate possible bias due to differences in
punctuation conventions.3 Then, we use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel,
Grenager, and Manning 2005) to identify named entities, which we replace with a
unique token (‘NE’). Next, we replace all nouns with their part-of-speech (POS) tag;
we use the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova and Manning 2000). Finally, for full lexical
abstraction, we replace all words with their POS tags, retaining only abstract syntactic
structures devoid of lexical content.

At each step, we train six language models on O- and T-texts and apply them
to the reference set (which is adapted to the same level of abstraction, of course).
As the abstraction of the text increases, we also increase the order of the LMs: From
4-grams for text without punctuation and NE abstraction, to 5-grams for noun abstrac-
tion, to 8-grams for full POS abstraction. In all cases we fix the LM vocabulary to only
contain tokens that appear more than once in the “abstracted” reference set. The results,
depicted in Table 9, consistently show that the T-based LM is a better fit to the reference
set, albeit to a lesser extent. The rightmost column specifies the improvement, in terms
of perplexity, of each language model, compared with the worst-performing model.
Although we do not show the details here, the same pattern is persistent in all the other
Europarl languages we experiment with.

4.1.3 More Language Pairs. To further test the robustness of these phenomena, we repeat
these experiments with the Hebrew-to-English corpus and reference set, reflecting a
different language family, a smaller corpus, and a different domain. We train two
4-gram language models on the O-EN and T-HE corpora. We then apply the two LMs
to the reference set and compute the perplexity. The results are presented in Table 10.
Again, the T-based LM is a better fit to the translated text than the O-based LM: Its
perplexity is lower by 12.8%. We also repeat the abstraction experiments on the Hebrew
scenario. The results, depicted in Table 11, consistently show that the T-based LM is a
better fit to the reference set.

Clearly, then, translated LMs better fit the references than original ones, and the
differences can be traced back not just to (trivial) specific lexical choice, but also to
syntactic structure, as evidenced by the POS abstraction experiments.

We further test our findings on other target languages, specifically English–German
and English–French. We train several 4-gram language models on the corpora specified
in Table 2. We then compute the perplexity of the German-translated-from-English and
French-translated-from-English reference sets (see Section 3.4) with respect to these
language models. Table 12 depicts the results; they are in complete agreement with our
hypothesis.

3 In fact, there is reason to assume that punctuation constitutes part of the translationese effect. Removing
punctuation therefore harms our cause of identifying this effect.

4.1.4 Larger Language Models. Can these phenomena be attributed to the relatively small
size of the corpora we use?Will the perplexity of O texts converge to that of T texts when
more data become available, or will the differences persist? To address these questions,
we use the (much larger) Hansard corpus and the (even larger) Gigaword corpus. We
train 4-gram language models for each Hansard and Gigaword subcorpus described in
Section 3.2. We apply the LMs to the Hansard reference set, but also to the Europarl
reference set, to examine the effect on out-of-domain (but similar genre) texts. In both
cases we report perplexity (Table 13).

The results are fully consistent with our previous findings: In the case of the
Hansard reference set, a language model based on original texts must be up to ten
times larger to retain the low perplexity level of translated texts. For example, whereas a
languagemodel compiled from 10million English-translated-from-French tokens yields
a perplexity of 42.70 on the Hansard reference set, a LM compiled from original English
texts requires 100 million words to yield a similar perplexity of 43.70 on the same
reference set. The Gigaword LMs, which are trained on texts representing completely
different domains and genres, produce much higher (i.e., worse) perplexity in this
scenario. In the case of the Europarl reference set, a language model based on original
texts must be approximately five times larger (and a Gigaword language model approxi-
mately twenty times larger) than a language model based on original texts to yield similar
perplexity.

4.2 Original vs. Translated LMs for Machine Translation
4.2.1 SMT Experiments. The last hypothesis we test is whether a better fitting lan-
guage model yields a better machine translation system. In other words, we expect
the T-based LMs to outperform the O-based LMs when used as part of machine
translation systems. We construct German-to-English, English-to-German, French-to-
English, French-to-German, Italian-to-English, and Dutch-to-English MT systems using
the Moses phrase-based SMT toolkit (Koehn et al. 2007). The systems are trained on
the parallel corpora described in Section 3.3. We use the reference sets (Section 3.4) as
follows: 1,000 sentences are randomly extracted for minimum error-rate training (Och
2003), and another, disjoint set of 1,000 randomly selected sentences is used for evalu-
ation. Each system is built and tuned with six different LMs: MIX, O-based, and four
T-based models (Section 3.2). We use Bleu (Papineni et al. 2002) to evaluate translation
quality. The results are listed in Tables 14 and 15.

The results are consistent and fully confirm our hypothesis. Across all language
pairs, MT systems using LMs compiled from translated-from-source texts consistently
outperform all other systems. Systems that use LMs compiled from texts originally
written in the target language always perform worst or second worst. We test the statis-
tical significance of the differences between the results using the bootstrap resampling
method (Koehn 2004). In all experiments, the best system (translated-from-source LM)
is significantly better than the system that uses the O-based LM (p < 0.01).

We now repeat the experiment with Hebrew to English translation. We construct a
Hebrew-to-English MT system with Moses, using a factored translation model (Koehn
and Hoang 2007). Every token in the training corpus is represented as two factors:
surface form and lemma. The Hebrew input is fully segmented (Itai and Wintner 2008).
The system is built and tuned with O- and T-based LMs. The O-based LM yields a
Bleu score of 11.94, whereas using the T-based LM results in somewhat higher Bleu

score, 12.07, but the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Presumably, the
low quality of both systems prevents the better LM frommaking a significant difference.

4.2.2 Larger Language Models. Again, the LMs used in the MT experiments reported here
are relatively small. To assess whether the benefits of using translated LMs carry over
to scenarios where larger original corpora exist, we build yet another set of French-to-
English MT systems. We use the Hansard SMT translation model and Hansard LMs
to train nine MT systems, three with varying sizes of translated texts and six with
varying sizes of original texts. We train additional MT systems with several subsets
of the Gigaword LM. We tune and evaluate on the Hansard reference set. In another
set of experiments we use the Europarl French-to-English scenario (using Europarl

corpora for the translation model as well as for tuning and evaluation), but we use
the Hansard and Gigaword LMs to see whether our findings are consistent also when
LMs are trained on out-of-domain material.

Table 16 again demonstrates that language models compiled from original texts
must be up to ten times larger in order to yield translation quality similar to that of
LMs compiled from translated texts.4 In other words, much smaller translated LMs
perform better than much larger original ones, and this holds for various LM sizes,
both in-domain and out-of-domain. For example, on the Hansard corpus, a 10-million-
token T-FR language model yields a Bleu score of 34.67, whereas an O-EN language
model of 100 million tokens is required in order to yield a similar Bleu score of 34.44.
The systems that use the Gigaword LMs perform much worse in-domain, even with a
language model compiled from 1000M tokens. Out-of-domain, the Gigaword systems
are better than O-EN, but they require approximately five times more data to match the
performance of T-FR systems.

4.2.3 Enjoying Both Worlds. The previous section established the fact that language mod-
els compiled from translated texts are better for MT than ones compiled from original
texts, even when the original LMs are much larger. In many real-world scenarios,
however, one has access to texts of both types. Our results do not imply that original

Note that the x-axis is logarithmic. Incidentally, the graphs show that increases in (Gigaword) corpus size
do not monotonically translate to better MT quality.

texts are useless, and that only translated ones should be used. In this section we explore
various ways to combine original and translated texts, thereby yielding even better
language models.

For these experiments we use 10 million English-translated-from-French tokens
from the Hansard corpus (T-FR) and another 100 million original-English tokens from
the same source (O-EN). We combine them in five different ways: straightforward
concatenation of the corpora; a concatenation of the original-English corpus with the
translated corpus, upweighted by a factor of 10 and then of 20; log-linear modeling;
and an interpolated language model. In each experiment we report both the fitness of
the LM to the reference set, in terms of perplexity, and the quality of machine translation

that uses this LM, in terms of Bleu.5 We execute each experiment twice, once (in-domain)
with the Hansard reference set and once (out-of-domain) where the translation model,
tuning corpus, and reference set all come from the Europarl FR-EN subcorpus, as above.
The results are listed in Table 17; we now provide a detailed explanation of these
experiments.

Concatenation of O and T texts. We train three language models by concatenating the
T-FR and O-EN corpora. First, we simply concatenate the corpora obtaining 110 million
tokens. Second, we upweight the T-FR corpus by a factor of 10 before the concatenation;
and finally, we upweight the T-FR corpus by a factor of 20 before the concatenation.
In the “in-domain” scenario, the LM trained on a simple concatenation of the corpora
reduces the perplexity by more than 10%. The best translation quality is obtained
when the T-FR corpus is upweighted by a factor of 10. It improves by 0.42 Bleu points
compared to the MT system that uses T-FR (p = 0.074), and, more significantly, by 0.65
Bleu points compared to O-EN (p < 0.05). In the “out-of-domain” scenario, there is a
small reduction in perplexity (about 5%) with a language model that is trained on a
simple concatenation of the corpora. There is also a very small improvement in the
translation quality (0.07 Bleu points compared to the T-FR system and 0.25 Bleu points
compared to O-EN).

Log-Linear combination of language models. The MOSES decoder uses log-linear model-
ing (Och and Ney 2001) to discriminate between better and worse hypotheses dur-
ing decoding. A log-linear model is defined as a combination of N feature functions
hi(t, s), 1 ≤ i ≤ N, that map input (s), output (t), or a pair of input and output strings
to a numeric value. Each feature function is associated with a model parameter λi, its
feature weight, which determines the contribution of the feature to the overall value of
P(t|s). Formally, decoding based on a log-linear model is defined by:

t̂ = argmax
t

P(t|s) = argmax
t

{
N∑
i=1

λihi(t, s)

}
(2)

5 Except log-linear models, for which we only report the quality of machine translation, because there are
two language models in this case and perplexity is harder to compute.

816



Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation

We train two language models, based on T-FR and O-EN. Then, we combine these
models by including them as different feature functions. The feature weight of each LM
is set by minimum error-rate tuning, optimizing the translation quality; this is the same
technique that Koehn and Schroeder (2007) employ for domain adaptation. In-domain,
this combination is better by 0.82 Bleu points compared with an MT system that uses
O-EN (p < 0.001), 0.59 Bleu points compared with the one that uses T-FR (p < 0.05).
Out of domain, this combination is again not significantly better than using T-FR only
(improvement of 0.08 Bleu points, p = 0.255).

Interpolated language models. In the interpolated scenario, two language models are
mixed on a fixed proportion η, according to the following equation (Weintraub et al.
1996):

p(w|h) = (1− η) · p(w|h;LM1)+ η · p(w|h;LM2) (3)

where w is a word, h is its “history,” and η is the fixed interpolation weight. We use
SRILM to train an interpolated language model from LM1 = O-EN and LM2 = T-FR.
The interpolation weight is tuned to minimize the perplexity of the combined model
with respect to the tuning set; we use the EM algorithm provided as part of the SRILM
toolkit to establish the optimized weights. In the in-domain scenario η = 0.46 and in the
out-of-domain scenario η = 0.49. The interpolated language model yields additional
improvement in perplexity and translation quality compared to all other models. It is
significantly better (p < 0.05) than the T-FR system on the in-domain scenarios, but the
improvement is less significant (p = 0.075) out of domain.

In summary, LMs compiled from source-translated-to-target texts are almost as
good asmuch larger LMs that also include large corpora of texts originally written in the
target language. Clearly, ignoring the status (original or translated) of monolingual texts
and creating a single languagemodel from all of them (the concatenation scenario) is not
much better than using only translated texts. In order to benefit from (often much larger)
original texts, one must consider more creative ways of combining the two subcorpora.
Of the methods we explored here, interpolated LMs provide the greatest advantage.
More research is needed in order to find an optimal combination.

5. Discussion

We use language models computed from different types of corpora to investigate
whether their fitness to a reference set of translated sentences can differentiate between
them (and, hence, between the corpora on which they are based). Our main findings
are that LMs compiled from manually translated corpora are much better predictors of
translated texts than LMs compiled from original-language corpora of the same size.
The results are robust, and are sustainable even when the corpora and the reference
sentences are abstracted in ways that retain their syntactic structure but ignore spe-
cific word meanings. Furthermore, we show that translated LMs are better predictors
of translated sentences even when the LMs are compiled from texts translated from
languages other than the source language. LMs based on texts translated from the source
language still outperform LMs translated from other languages, however.

We also show that MT systems based on translated-from-source-language LMs out-
perform MT systems based on originals LMs or LMs translated from other languages.
Again, these results are robust and the improvements are statistically significant. This
effect seems to be amplified as translation quality improves. Furthermore, our results

show that original LMs require five to ten times more data to exhibit the same fitness
to the reference set and the same translation quality as translated LMs.

More generally, this study confirms that insights drawn from the field of theoretical
Translation Studies, namely, the dual claim according to which translations as such
differ from originals, and translations from different source languages differ from each
other, can be verified experimentally and contribute to the performance of machine
translation.

One question, however, requires further investigation: Do MT systems based on
translated-from-source-language LMs produce better translations, or do they merely
generate sentences that are directly adapted to the reference set, thereby only improving
a specific evaluation metric, such as Bleu? We address this issue in three ways, showing
that the former is indeed the case. First, we use two automated evaluation metrics other
than Bleu, and show that the T-based LMs yield better MT systems even with different
metrics. Second, we perform a manual evaluation of a portion of the evaluation set. The
results show that human evaluators prefer translations produced by an MT system that
uses a T-based LM over translations produced by a system built with an O-based LM.
Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the differences between O- and T-based LMs,
explaining these differences in terms of insights from Translation Studies.

5.1 Automatic Evaluation

First, we use two alternative automatic evaluation metrics, METEOR6 (Denkowski and
Lavie 2011) and TER (Snover et al. 2006), to assess the quality of the MT systems
described in Section 4.2. We focus on four translation tasks: From German, French,
Italian, and Dutch to English.7 For each task we report the performance of two MT
systems: One that uses a language model compiled from original-English texts, and one
that uses a language model trained on texts translated from the source language. The
results, which are reported in Table 18, fully support our previous findings (recall that
lower TER is better): MT systems that use T-based LMs significantly outperform systems
that use O-based LMs.

6 More precisely, we use METEOR-RANK, the configuration used for WMT-2011.
7 All MT systems were tuned using Bleu.

5.2 Human Evaluation

To further establish the qualitative difference between translations produced with an
English-original language model and translations produced with a LM created from
French-translated-to-English texts, we conducted a human evaluation campaign, using
Amazon’sMechanical Turk as an inexpensive, reliable, and accessible pool of annotators
(Callison-Burch and Dredze 2010). We created a small evaluation corpus of 100 sen-
tences, selected randomly among all (Europarl) reference sentences whose length is
between 15 and 25 words. Each instance of the evaluation task includes two English
sentences, obtained from the two MT systems that use the O-EN and the T-FR language
models, respectively. Annotators are presented with these two translations, and are re-
quested to determine which one is better. The definition given to annotators is: “A better
translation is more fluent, reflecting better use of English.” Observe that because the
only variable that distinguishes between the two MT systems is the different language
model, we only have to evaluate the fluency of the target sentence, not its faithfulness
to the source. Consequently, we do not present the source or the reference translation
to the annotators. All annotators were located in the United States (and, therefore, are
presumably English speakers).

As a control set, we added a set of 10 sentences produced with the O-based LM,
which were paired with their (manually created) reference translations, and 10 sen-
tences produced with the T-based LM, again paired with their references. Each of the
120 evaluation instances was assigned to 10 different Mechanical Turk annotators. We
report two evaluation metrics: score and majority. The score of a given sentence pair
〈e1, e2〉 is i/j, where i is the number of annotators who preferred e1 over e2, and j = 10− i
is the number of annotators preferring e2. For such a sentence pair, the majority is e1 if
i > j, e2 if i < j, and undefined otherwise.

The average score of the 10 sentences in the O-vs.-reference control set is 22/78,
and the majority is the reference translation in all but one of the instances. As for the
T-vs.-reference control set, the average score is 18/82, and the majority is the reference
in all of the instances. This indicates that the annotators are reliable, and also that it
is unrealistic to expect a clear-cut distinction even between human translations and
machine-generated output.

As for the actual evaluation set, the average score of O-EN vs. T-FR is 38/62, and
the majority is T-FR in 75% of the cases, O-EN in only 25% of the sentence pairs. We
take these results as a very strong indication that English sentences generated by an
MT system whose language model is compiled from translated texts are perceived
by humans as more fluent than ones generated by a system built with an O-based
language model. Not only is the improvement reflected in significantly higher Bleu
(and METEOR, TER) scores, but it is undoubtedly also perceived as such by human
annotators.

5.3 Analysis

In order to look into the differences between T and O qualitatively, rather than quantita-
tively, we turn now to study several concrete examples. To do so, we extracted approx-
imately 200 sentences from the French–English Europarl evaluation set; we chose all
sentences of length between 15 and 25. In addition, we extracted the 100 most frequent
n-grams, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 5, from both English-original and English-translated-from-French
Europarl corpora. As both corpora include approximately the same number of tokens,
we report counts in the following rather than frequencies.

819



Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 4

The differences between O and T texts are consistent with well-established observa-
tions of translation scholars. Consider the explicitation hypothesis (Blum-Kulka 1986),
which Séguinot (1998, page 108) spells out thus:

1. “something which was implied or understood through presupposition in
the source text is overtly expressed in the translation”

2. “something is expressed in the translation which was not in the original”

3. “an element in the source text is given greater importance in the
translation through focus, emphasis, or lexical choice”

Blum-Kulka (1986) uses the term cohesive markers to refer to items that are utilized by
the translator which cannot be found overtly in the source text. One would expect such
markers to be much more prevalent in translationese.

An immediate example of (1) is the case of acronyms: these tend to be spelled out
in translated texts. Indeed, the acronym EU is ranked 77 among the O-EN bigrams,
whereas in T-FR it does not appear in the top 100. On the other hand, the explicit trigram
The European Union occurs more frequently in T than in O.

Similarly, an instance of (2) is the cohesivemarker because in the following example,
which appears in T but neither appears in O nor can it be traced back to the original
source sentence:

Source Enfin, ce qui est grave dans le rapport de M. Olivier Tautologie, c’est qu’il
propose une constitution tripotage.

O Finally, which is serious in the report of Mr Olivier Tautologie, is that it proposes a
constitution tripotage.

T Finally, and this is serious in the report by Mr olivier Tautologie, it is because it
proposes a constitution tripotage.

Another cohesive marker, nevertheless, is correctly generated only in the T-based trans-
lation in the following example:

Source C’est quand même quelque chose de précieux qui a été souligné par tous les
membres du conseil européen.

O Even when it is something of valuable which has been pointed out by all the mem-
bers of the European Council.

T It is nevertheless something of a valuable which has been pointed out by all the
members of the European Council.

Other cohesive markers discussed by Blum-Kulka (1986) are over-represented in
T compared with O. These include: therefore (3,187 occurrences in T, 1,983 in O); for
example (863 occurrences in T, 701 in O); in particular (1336 vs. 1068); first of all (601 vs.
266); in fact (1014 vs. 441); in other words (553 vs. 87); with regard to (1137 vs. 310); in
order to (2,016 vs. 603); in this respect (363 vs. 94); on the one hand (288 vs. 72); on the
other hand (428 vs. 76); and with a view to (213 vs. 51). A similar list of markers have
been shown to be excellent discriminating features between original and translated texts
(from several European languages, including French) in an independent study (Koppel
and Ordan 2011).

820



Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation

Another phenomenon we notice is that the T-based language model does a much
better job translating verbs than the O-based language model. In two very large corpora
of French and English (Ferraresi et al. 2008), verbs are much more frequent in French
than in English (0.124 vs. 0.091). Human translations from French to English, therefore,
provide many more examples of verbs from which to model. Indeed, we encounter
several examples in which the O-based translation system fails to use a verb at all, or to
use one correctly, compared with the T-based system:

Source Une telle Europe serait un gage de paix et marquerait le refus de tout national-
isme ethnique.

O Such a Europe would be a show of peace and would the rejection of any ethnic
nationalism.

T Such a Europe would be a show of peace and would mark the refusal of all ethnic
nationalism.

Source Votre rapport, madame Sudre, met l’accent, à juste titre, sur la nécessité d’agir
dans la durée.

O Your report, Mrs Sudre, its emphasis, quite rightly, on the need to act in the long
term.

T Your report, Mrs Sudre, places the emphasis, quite rightly, on the need to act in the
long term.

Source Cette proposition, si elle constitue un pas dans la bonne direction n’en comporte
pas moins de nombreuses lacunes auxquelles le rapport evans remédie.

O This proposal, if it is a step in the right direction do not least in contains many
shortcomings which the evans report resolve.

T This proposal, if it is a step in the right direction it contains no less many shortcom-
ings which the evans report resolve.

Last, there are several cases of interference, which Toury (1995, page 275) defines as
follows: “Phenomena pertaining to the make-up of the source text tend to be transferred
to the target text.” In the following example, do not say nothing more is a literal
translation of the French construction On ne dit rien non plus. The T-based translation
is much more fluent:

Source On ne dit rien non plus sur la responsabilité des fabricants, notamment en
grande-bretagne, qui ont été les premiers responsables.

O We do not say nothing more on the responsibility of the manufacturers, particularly
in Britain, which were the first responsible.

T We do not say anything either on the responsibility of the manufacturers, particu-
larly in great Britain, who were the first responsible.

Incidentally, there are also some cultural differences between O and T that we
deem less important, because they are not part of the “translationese dialect” but rather
indicate differences pertaining to the culture from which the speaker arrives. Most
notable is the form ladies and gentlemen, which is the tenth most frequent trigram in T,
but does not even rank among the top 100 in O. This is already noted by van Halteren

821



Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 4

(2008), according to whom this form is significantly more frequent in translations from
five European languages as opposed to original English.

In terms of (shallow) syntactic structure, we observe that part-of-speech n-grams
are distributed somewhat differently in O and in T (we use the POS-tagged Europarl
corpus of Section 4.1.2 for the following analysis). For example, proper nouns are more
frequent in O (ranking 7 among all POS 1-grams) than in T (rank 9). This has influence
on longer n-grams: For example, the 3-gram PRP MD VB is 20% more frequent in O
than in T. The sequence <S> PRP VBP is almost twice as frequent in O. The 4-gram IN
DT NN </S> is 25% more frequent in O. In contrast, the 4-gram IN DT NNS IN is 15%
more frequent in T than in O. A full analysis of such patterns is beyond the scope of
this article.

Summing up, T-based language models are more fluent and therefore yield better
translation results for the following reasons: They are more cohesive, less influenced by
structural differences between the languages, such as the under-representation of verbs
in original English texts, and less prone to interference (i.e., they can break away from
the original towards a more coherent model of the target language).

5.4 Future Research

This work is among the first to use insights from Translation Studies in order to improve
machine translation, and to use computational linguistic methodologies to corroborate
Translation Studies hypotheses. We believe that there are still vast opportunities for
fertile cross-disciplinary research in these directions. First, we only address the language
model in the present work. Kurokawa, Goutte, and Isabelle (2009) investigate the rela-
tions between the direction of translation and the quality of the translation model used
by SMT systems. There are various ways in which the two approaches can be extended
and combined, and we are actively pursuing such research directions now (Lembersky,
Ordan, and Wintner 2012).

This work also bears on language typology: We conjecture that LMs compiled
from texts translated not from the original language, but from a closely related one,
can be better than LMs compiled from texts translated from a more distant language.
Some of our results support this hypothesis, but more research is needed in order to
establish it.

The fact that translations seem to make do with fewer words (cf. also Laviosa 2008)
call into question certain norms in comparing corpora in the field of machine transla-
tion. Translated and original texts can be expected to either have the same number of
sentences or the same number of tokens, but not both. Similarly, theymay have the same
number of tokens or the same number of types, but not both.

Another interesting question that arises from this study is whether the perplexity
of a language model on a reference set is a good predictor of a translation quality
measure, such as Bleu. Although our results show a certain correlation between the
perplexity and Bleu, we acknowledge the fact that these results need further corrob-
oration. Chen, Beeferman, and Rosenfeld (1998) examine the ability of perplexity to
estimate the performance of speech recognition. They find that perplexity often does
not correlate well with word-error rates. As it is extremely important to have a reliable
measure capable of estimating the effect of language model improvements on transla-
tion quality without requiring expensive decoding resources, we believe that finding
correspondences between perplexity and the quality of MT is a valuable topic for future
research.
