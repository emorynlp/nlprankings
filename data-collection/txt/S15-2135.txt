Abstract

The HLT-FBK system is a suite of SVMs-
based classification models for extracting time
expressions, events and temporal relations,
each with a set of features obtained with the
NewsReader NLP pipeline. HLT-FBK’s best
system runs ranked 1st in all three domains,
with a recall of 0.30 over all domains. Our at-
tempts on increasing recall by considering all
SRL predicates as events as well as utilizing
event co-reference information in extracting
temporal links result in significant improve-
ments.

1 Introduction

QA TempEval is a continuation of the TempEval
task series (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al.,
2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), which shifts its eval-
uation methodology from temporal information ex-
traction accuracy to temporal question-answering
(QA) accuracy. However, the main task is the same
as its predecessor tasks, which is to automatically
annotate texts with temporal information following
TimeML specification (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a).

This paper describes the HLT-FBK system sub-
mitted to QA TempEval. The system decomposes
the task into three sub-tasks, i.e. temporal expres-
sion (timex) extraction, event extraction and tempo-
ral relation extraction. Each sub-task is formulated
as a supervised classification problem using SVMs-
based classifiers, which make use of the information
acquired from the NewsReader1 NLP pipeline.

2 Data, Resources and Tools

The training data set is the TimeML annotated
data released by the task organizers, which includes
TBAQ-cleaned and TE3-Platinum corpora reused
from the TempEval-3 task (UzZaman et al., 2013).
We extended the training corpus for the timex ex-
traction system with the TempEval-3 silver corpus.

The test data are 30 plain texts of News, Wikipedia
and Blogs domains (10 documents each). For evalu-
ating the system, 294 temporal-based questions and
the test data annotated with entities relevant for the
questions are used.

The resources used by the system to extract some
features are lists of temporal signals extracted from
the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) and
a list of nominalizations extracted from the SPE-
CIALIST Lexicon2 distributed by the U.S. National
Library of Medicine, which contains commonly oc-
curring English words in addition to biomedical
terms, with syntactic and morphological informa-
tion. We extracted all nouns resulting from a nom-
inalization. Other features come from the annota-
tion of the addDiscourse tool (Pitler and Nenkova,
2009), which identifies discourse connectives and
assigns them to one of the four semantic classes:
Temporal, Expansion, Contingency and Compari-
son.

The MorphoPro module, part of the TextPro tool
suite3, is used to get the morphological analysis
of each token in a text. The time expression nor-

malization sub-task is carried out by TimeNorm4
(Bethard, 2013), a library for converting natural lan-
guage expressions of dates and times into their nor-
malized form.

The HLT-FBK system is a suite of classification
models that have been built and applied using Yam-
Cha5 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003), a text chunker
using the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algo-
rithm. It supports the dynamic features that are de-
cided dynamically during the classification, multi-
class classification using either one-vs-rest or one-
vs-one strategies, and polynomial kernels.

3 The End-to-end System

3.1 Pre-processing: NewsReader Pipeline
The data pre-processing was done using the NLP
pipeline developed for the NewsReader project.
The pipeline includes, amongst others, tokenization,
part-of-speech tagging, constituency parser, depen-
dency parser, named entity recognition, semantic
role labeling (SRL) and event co-reference.6

3.2 Timex Extraction System
The task of recognizing the extent of a timex, as well
as determining the timex type (i.e. DATE, TIME, DU-
RATION and SET), is taken as a text chunking task.
Since the timex extent can be a multi-token expres-
sion, we employ the IOB2 tagging to annotate the
data, so each token will be classified into 9 classes:
B-DATE, I-DATE, B-TIME, I-TIME, B-DURATION, I-
DURATION, B-SET, I-SET and O (for other).

The classifier is built with one-vs-one strategy
for multi-class classification. The features used to
represent a token are token’s text, lemma, part-of-
speech (PoS) tag, chunk, named entity type (if any),
and whether a token matches regular expression pat-
terns for a time unit, part of a day, name of days,
name of months, duration (e.g. 1h3’), etc. In ad-
dition, all mentioned features for the preceding 4
and following 4 tokens, and the preceding 4 labels
tagged by the classifier, are also included in the fea-
ture set.

6More information about the NewsReader pipeline, as well

as a demo, are available on the project website http://www.
newsreader-project.eu/results/.

For timex normalization, we decided to use
TimeNorm. For English, it is shown to be the
best performing system for most evaluation corpora
(Llorens et al., 2012). We added pre- and post-
processing rules in order to obtain the best normal-
ized form.

3.3 Event Extraction System

Event detection is taken as a text chunking task, in
which tokens have to be classified into two classes:
EVENT (i.e. the token is included in an event extent)
or O (for other). Then events are classified into one
of the 7 TimeML classes (i.e. REPORTING, PERCEP-
TION, ASPECTUAL, I ACTION, I STATE, STATE and
OCCURRENCE).

The classification models are built with one-vs-
rest strategy for multi-class classification. For both
event extent identification and event classification
tasks we use various features to represent each to-
ken. The classic features are token’s lemma, PoS
tag, and entity type (if the token is part of a named
entity or a time expression). Other features that are
more specific for the task include: verb’s tense and
polarity7, whether the token is annotated as predi-
cate by the SRL module, whether it is part of an
event co-reference chain and whether it is in the
nominalization list. In addition, all mentioned fea-
tures for the preceding 4 and following 4 tokens, and
the preceding 4 labels tagged by the classifier, are
also considered as features.

Specifically for event classification, additional
features are used: token’s chunk, whether the token
is part of a temporal discourse connective, whether a
verb is the main verb of the sentence (root verb), the
predicate for which the token is part of a participant
and its semantic role (e.g. Arg0, Arg1), and finally
whether the token is in an event extent (annotated in
the previous step).

We submitted two different runs:

• Run 1 (ev1) Two classifiers are used as described
above.

• Run 2 (ev2) We consider all predicates identified
by the SRL module as events. We then used a
classifier to determine the class of each event.

7The tense, aspect and polarity attributes of events, as de-
fined in TimeML, are obtained through manually written rules
based on the morphological analysis produced by MorphoPro.

3.4 Temporal Relation Extraction System
The temporal relation extraction system extracts
temporal relations (TLINKs) holding between two
events or between an event and a time expression.
We consider all combinations of event/event and
event/timex pairs within the same sentence (in a
forward manner8), and pairs of main events (root
verbs) of consecutive sentences, as candidate tem-
poral links.

Given an ordered pair of entities (e1, e2), either
event/event or event/timex pair, the classifier has
to assign a label, i.e one of the 13 TimeML tem-
poral relation types. However, we simplified the
considered temporal relation types to better fit the
QA TempEval task description and to deal with the
unbalanced training data as follows: (i) IDENTITY
and DURING are mapped to SIMULTANEOUS; (ii)
IBEFORE/IAFTER are mapped to BEFORE/AFTER;9

and (iii) INCLUDES, BEGINS and ENDS are con-
verted to their inverse counterparts (IS INCLUDED,
BEGUN BY and ENDED BY, resp.) by exchanging
the order of entities in the pair. In the end, we only
consider 6 temporal relation types (i.e. SIMULTANE-
OUS, BEFORE, AFTER, IS INCLUDED, BEGUN BY
and ENDED BY).

The classification models for event/event and
event/timex pairs are built with one-vs-one strategy
for multi-class classification. The overall approach
is largely inspired by an existing work for classifing
temporal relations (Mirza and Tonelli, 2014). The
implemented features are as follows:

String and grammatical features. Tokens, lem-
mas, PoS tags and chunks of e1 and e2, along with
a binary feature indicating whether e1 and e2 in an
event/event pair have the same PoS tags.

Textual context. Sentence distance (e.g. 0 if e1
and e2 are in the same sentence) and entity distance
inside a sentence (i.e. the number of entities occur-
ring between e1 and e2).

Entity attributes. Event attributes (class, tense,
aspect and polarity) taken from the output of the
event extraction module, and the timex attribute

8For example, for a sentence “...ev1...tmx1...ev2...”, the can-
didate pairs are (ev1, tmx1), (ev1, ev3) and (ev2, tmx1).

9Because event pairs of IBEFORE/IAFTER types are too
scarce as training examples, and they are by definition specific
types of BEFORE/AFTER.

(type) obtained from the timex extraction module of
e1 and e2; a binary feature to represent whether the
timex in an event/timex pair is the document creation
time; and four binary features to represent whether
e1 and e2 in an event/event pair have the same event
attributes or not. We also include as features the PoS
chain of VP chunks containing events (e.g. VHZ-
VBN-VVG for has been [raining]e1 , VM-VVB for
would [send]e2), which captures tense and aspect,
as well as modality information of the event.

Dependency information. Dependency path ex-
isting between e1 and e2, and binary features indi-
cating whether e1/e2 is the root verb.

Temporal signals. Tokens of temporal signals oc-
curring around e1 and e2 and their positions with re-
spect to e1 and e2 (i.e. before/after e1, before/after
e2, or at the beginning of the sentence).

Temporal discourse connectives. We take into
account discourse connectives belonging to the Tem-
poral class, acquired from the addDiscourse tool.
Similar to temporal signals, tokens of connectives
occurring in the textual context of e1 and e2, and
their position with respect to e1 and e2, are used
as features. These features are only relevant for
event/event pairs.

There are two variations of system submitted:
• Run 1 (trel1) We incorporate pre-processing rules

based on timex pattern matching (e.g. from...to...,
between...and...), to recognize event/timex pairs
of BEGUN BY and ENDED BY types, which are
not well represented in the training corpus.

• Run 2 (trel2) Similar as Run 1, however, we also
incorporate the event co-reference information
obtained from the NewsReader pipeline. When-
ever two events co-refer, the event/event pair is
excluded from the classifier, and automatically la-
belled SIMULTANEOUS.

4 Results

We submitted 4 system runs, i.e. the combinations
of 2 system runs for event extraction (ev1 and ev2)
and 2 system runs for temporal relation extraction
(trel1 and trel2). Table 1 shows HLT-FBK system
results in terms of coverage, precision, recall and F1-
score for the three considered domains; recall is the
main evaluation metric used to rank the systems.

Table 3: HLT-FBK system results in terms of recall on
identifying events (ev) and timexes (tx) with strict match.

The best results are achieved with the combina-
tion of ev2 and trel2, which significantly outper-
formed other participating systems and reported off-
the-shelf systems (not optimized for the task), i.e.
CAEVO with 0.17 and 0.18 recall scores on News
and Blogs respectively, and TIPSem with 0.19 recall
on Wikipedia.

Table 2 compares trel1 and trel2 runs, in terms
of the number of answered questions (correctly and
incorrectly) and unanswered questions (due to un-
known entities and non-established/unknown rela-
tions). Meanwhile, Table 3 compares ev1 and ev2
in terms of recall scores on identifying EVENT and
TIMEX3 tags, with the annotated test data as the
gold standard.10 Both results give more insight on
the question answering-based evaluation.

5 Discussion

The timex extraction system performs well on News
texts, but not on texts from Wikipedia and Blogs (see
Table 3). Our error analysis shows that many time

10The gold standard only contains the annotated entities rel-
evant for answering the set of questions. For this reason, we
computed only the recall.

expressions in Wikipedia texts are not represented
in the training corpus (e.g. 4th millennium BCE).

Considering all SRL predicates as events (ev2)
improves the recall on identifying relevant events
(see Table 3), but lowers the precision on answer-
ing the questions (except for Wikipedia, in which
the precision is also improved, see Table 1). In this
task, the focus is on the recall and as expected the
best results are obtained by the system with the best
recall (ev2).

For temporal relation extraction, using event co-
reference information (trel2) reduces the number of
unknown relations (Rel) down by 77% in average for
all domains (see Table 2). Hence, the recall scores
increase significantly as shown in Table 1, especially
for the Wikipedia domain with almost 20% improve-
ment.

Our attempts on improving the overall perfor-
mance by increasing the recall (ev2 and trel2 runs)
work well on News and Wikipedia, shown by im-
proving F1-scores. This unfortunately does not hold
for Blogs, since the precision is greatly compro-
mised while the recall is only slightly improved.

In general, the system performs best on News and
Wikipedia texts, but not so well on informal Blogs
texts. This difference can be due to the fact that
our systems, as well as most of the pipeline’s mod-
ules, are trained using the corpus of formal news
texts. Moreover, Blogs texts contain orthographic
errors, a lot of punctuation signs, etc. and their pre-
processing with the pipeline do not run well.
