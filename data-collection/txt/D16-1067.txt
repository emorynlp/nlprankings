Abstract 

Search personalization that considers the social 
dimension of the web has attracted a significant 
volume of research in recent years. A user pro-
file is usually needed to represent a user’s inter-
ests in order to tailor future searches. Previous 
research has typically constructed a profile sole-
ly from a user’s usage information. When the 
user has only limited activities in the system, 
the effect of the user profile on search is also 
constrained. This research addresses the setting 
where a user has only a limited amount of usage 
information. We build enhanced user profiles 
from a set of annotations and resources that us-
ers have marked, together with an external 
knowledge base constructed according to usage 
histories. We present two probabilistic latent 
topic models to simultaneously incorporate so-
cial annotations, documents and the external 
knowledge base. Our web search strategy is 
achieved using personalized social query ex-
pansion. We introduce a topical query expan-
sion model to enhance the search by utilizing 
individual user profiles. The proposed ap-
proaches have been intensively evaluated on a 
large public social annotation dataset. Results 
show that our models significantly outper-
formed existing personalized query expansion 
methods which use user profiles solely built 
from past usage information in personalized 
search.  

1 Introduction 
On today’s social web, users can enrich the social 
context of web pages. The most notable fact is 
that users can often freely tag web pages with an-

notations (Gupta et al., 2011). These tags could be 
high quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics 
and a good indicator of web users’ interests. 
However, the uncontrolled manner of social tag-
ging results in the use of an unrestricted vocabu-
lary. This makes searching through the collection 
difficult and generally less accurate. Thus the so-
cial annotation or bookmarking system demon-
strates an extreme example of the vocabulary 
mismatch problem encountered in personalized 
web search. To tackle the problem, various per-
sonalized query expansion (QE) and results re-
ranking techniques have been proposed and eval-
uated (Bouadjenek et al., 2016).  

There have been some attempts to achieve per-
sonalized QE using social data. For example, Re-
searchers have considered selecting the most re-
lated tags from a user’s profile to expand queries 
(Bender et al., 2008; Bertier et al., 2009; 
Bouadjenek et al., 2011). Local analysis and co-
occurrence based user profile representation have 
also been adopted to expand the query (Chirita et 
al., 2007; Biancalana et al., 2013). Recently, Zhou 
et al. proposed a query expansion framework 
based on individual user profiles (Zhou et al., 
2012a). In their work, terms in the user profile are 
modeled according to their associations, which 
can be defined by co-occurrence statistics or de-
fined by a tag-topic model.  

All of the previously mentioned systems are 
dependent upon historical usage information be-
ing available in an individual user profile 
(Sugiyama et al., 2004; Teevan et al., 2005; 
Bennett et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014; Guha et al., 
2015; Zhou et al., 2016). This information is piv-
otal when tailoring search results to the prefer-
ences of specific individuals. However, in some 

700



cases a user may have very limited previous inter-
actions with the system. With little usage infor-
mation to hand, the personalized search experi-
ence is poor. Furthermore, using only historical 
usage information to personalize search may not 
be enough. 

In this paper, we extend personalized search us-
ing social data in two directions. First, we exploit 
external knowledge bases to enhance the user pro-
file built from a user’s historical usage infor-
mation. We build queries from the user tags and 
annotated web pages. Subsequently, we fetch the 
relevant documents from an external corpus to be 
included in the user profile. We then propose to 
incorporate the user’s annotations, web page con-
tent information and external documents through 
two statistical models, which we have named 
Mixture Enhanced User Profiling (MEUP) Model 
and Separated Enhanced User Profiling (SEUP) 
Model. Both models infer latent topics, their 
probabilities of being relevant and a multinomial 
distribution of topics of the documents being con-
sidered. MEUP mixed the tags, annotated docu-
ments and external documents together to infer 
unified latent topics, while SEUP is an extension 
of MEUP which learns topics that are shared be-
tween the two groups of document-aligned pairs.  

Second, we propose a topical query expansion 
model to personalize web search by utilizing the 
user profiles. In the topical QE model, profile 
terms are calculated based on their topical rele-
vance to the query terms to expand the query.      

Experimental results show that the Enhanced 
User Profiling models together with the topic QE 
can significantly improve retrieval performance 
over user profiles solely built from a user’s histor-
ical information. Improvements were observed for 
users with both a rich amount of usage informa-
tion and a small amount of information. We also 
demonstrate that the approach proposed in the 
paper outperforms existing QE methods proposed 
for personalized search using social data. 

The contribution of this paper can be summa-
rized as follows:  

i. We tackle the challenge of personalized 
web search using social data in a novel way by 
enhancing user profiles that are built solely from 
users’ historical usage information. 

ii. We propose and systematically evaluate 
two novel generative models to construct enriched 
user profiles with the help of external corpora in 

the context of personalized search using social 
data. 

iii. We suggest and evaluate a novel query 
expansion method. Instead of relying on lexical 
relevance information between query terms and 
profile terms, we also consider the topical rele-
vance between them to expand the query.  

2 Related Work 

2.1 Personalized Search Using Social Media 
In personalized search using social media (Jamali 
and Ester, 2010; Lin et al., 2013), the search pro-
cess is either performed over “social” data gath-
ered from Web 2.0 applications such as social 
bookmarking systems, wikis, blogs etc., or it re-
adapts the web search results produced by search 
engines by using social data (Carman et al., 2008; 
Bouadjenek et al., 2016). For example, the authors 
in (Vallet et al., 2010) investigated how the rank-
ing of search engine results can be improved with 
respect to users if the users’ social information is 
taken into consideration. A similar approach was 
also explored in (Noll and Meinel, 2007) where 
the system performed re-ranking of Google search 
results based on social bookmarks and tags har-
vested from del.icio.us1. However, the data sparsi-
ty problem poses a challenge to this approach as 
not all Web pages returned by search engines are 
tagged in the del.icio.us dataset. 

2.2 Personalized Results Re-Ranking 
Because of this problem, researchers started to use 
social data as a test collection to develop personal-
ized techniques. In this way, personalization usu-
ally involves two general approaches. The first 
approach submits a query into the collection but 
re-ranks the returned results based on an individu-
al user profile. In (Xu et al., 2008) the authors re-
rank the results according to the topical relevance 
of documents and users’ interests. Carmel et al. 
(Carmel et al., 2009) investigated personalized 
results re-ranking based on the user’s social rela-
tions. Wang and Jin (Wang and Jin, 2010) ex-
plored gathering data from multiple online social 
systems for adaptive search personalization. 
Bouadjenek et al. (Bouadjenek et al., 2013a; 
Bouadjenek et al., 2013b) propose to use social 
data and user relationships to enhance document

representation for re-ranking purposes. Though 
this group of work is attractive, if relevant items 
cannot be fetched in the first place, regardless of 
the complex re-ranking process, the results still 
tend to be unsatisfactory.  

2.3 Personalized Query Expansion 
Another group of work modifies or augments a 
user’s original query. This approach is termed 
query expansion (Zhou et al., 2015). Researchers 
have considered tag-tag relationships for personal-
ized query expansion, by selecting the most relat-
ed tags from a user’s profile (Bender et al., 2008; 
Bertier et al., 2009). However, tags cannot be re-
lied upon to consistently provide precise descrip-
tions of resources for use when searching. Local 
analysis and co-occurrence based user profile rep-
resentation have also been adopted to expand the 
query (Chirita et al., 2007; Biancalana and 
Micarelli, 2009). However, the expansion terms 
are solely based on lexical matching between the 
query and the terms which exist in the user profile. 
Zhou et al. proposed a query expansion frame-
work based on individual user profiles (Zhou et al., 
2012a; Zhou et al., 2012b). In their work, terms in 
the user profile are modeled according to their 
associations, which can be defined by co-
occurrence statistics or defined by a tag-topic 
model. The method simultaneously incorporates 
annotations and web documents in a latent graph, 
regularized by terms extracted from the top-
ranked documents. 

However, all of the previously mentioned sys-
tems consider constructing user profiles solely 
from past usage information. In contrast, in this 
paper we extend personalized web search using 
social data by exploiting an external knowledge 
base to enhance the user profile. 

3 Problem Definition and Solution Over-
view 

In social annotation and bookmarking systems 
such as del.icio.us or CiteUlike2, users can label 
interesting web resources with primarily short and 
unstructured annotations in natural language 
called tags. These web resources are denoted as a 
URL in the del.icio.us website. Textual content 
can be crawled by following a URL that refers to 
a document or web page. Please refer to Table 1 
for the basic notations used in this paper. 

Formally, social tagging data can be represent-
ed by a tuple 𝒫 ≔ (𝒰,𝒟,𝒯,𝒜). 𝒜 ⊆ 𝒰×𝒟×𝒯 is 
a ternary relation, whose elements are called tag 
assignments or annotations (or bookmarks). The

set of annotations of a user is defined as: 
𝒜! ≔ {(𝑡,𝑑)|𝑢,𝑑, 𝑡 ∈ 𝒜}. The tag vocabulary of 
a user, is given as 𝒯! ≔ {𝑡|(𝑡,𝑑) ∈ 𝒜!}. A us-
er’s set of documents is 𝒟! ≔ {𝑑|(𝑡,𝑑) ∈ 𝒜!}. 
We define terms extracted from a user’s set of 
documents as 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ≔ {𝑤|𝑤 ∈ 𝒟!}, where 
𝑤  denotes a word/term in the annotated docu-
ments. Similarly, we define terms extracted from 
a user’s set of external documents as 
𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ≔ {𝑤|𝑤 ∈ 𝒟!"#!$! } , where 𝒟!"#!$!  
denotes a user’s set of external documents from an 
external corpus 𝒟!"#!$. 

In a typical personalized search scenario, given 
a source query 𝑞 and a set of words in the user 
profile {𝑤!,𝑤!…𝑤!}  the goal is to return a 
ranked list of profile terms to be added to the que-
ry, for a second round retrieval of results.  

Our personalization approach consists of three 
main steps (see Table 2): Fetching external docu-
ments; User profile modelling; and Personalized 
query expansion. We enhance a user’s historical 
usage information in step one. We firstly concate-

nate all tags 𝑡  in 𝒯!  into a query 𝑞𝒯!  (line 1). 
Then for each document 𝑑  in 𝒟! , we extract 
terms with the highest inverted document fre-
quency (idf) scores as queries 𝑄𝒟! (lines 2-3, with 
the EXTRACTTOP function returns top λ terms). 
Next we send queries in 𝑄!"#!$ (𝑞𝒯

! ∪ 𝑄𝒟!) to an 
external corpus 𝒟!"#!$  to fetch 𝒟!"#!$!  together 
with their retrieval scores 𝑠!,! (lines 5-7, the num-
ber of documents retrieved by each query is con-
trolled by the parameter 𝛾). Step two integrates 
𝒯! (here all tags are concatenated and viewed as a 
single document), 𝒟! , 𝒟!"#!$!  and their retrieval 
scores 𝑠!,! into a topic model such that a multi-
nomial distribution of topics specific to each doc-
ument can be inferred (lines 8-14, we eliminate 
the procedure for the SEUP model because its 
similarity to the simpler model, see the next sec-
tion). In the last step, the algorithm uses the out-
put of step two to build a topical query expansion 
model in order to expand the original query (lines 
15-18). Note that step one and step two could be 
executed off-line so as to improve the efficiency 
of the algorithm. 

4 Enhanced User Profiling Models 
In this section we describe how to model user pro-
files (i.e. step two in Table 2). We present two 
Enhanced User Profiling (EUP) models for this 
purpose.  

4.1 Mixture Enhanced User Profiling 
Topic discovery in the EUP models is influenced 
not only by term co-occurrences, but also by the 
retrieval scores of documents. To avoid normali-
zation, we employ a log-normal distribution for 
retrieval scores to infer latent topics via the docu-
ments and their relevance probabilities.  

The MEUP model developed here is a genera-
tive model of retrieval scores and the words in the 
documents. The generative process is as follows: 
Generative process of the MEUP model 

1. for each topic 𝑘 ∈ [1,𝐾] do  
sample the mixture of words 𝜑~𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛽) 

2. for each document 𝑑! ∈ 𝒯! ∪ 𝒟! ∪ 𝒟!"#!$!   do  
sample the mixture of topics 𝜃!~𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛼) 

for each word 𝑤! indexed by 𝑖 = 1,… ,𝑁!!  do 

           sample the topic index topic 𝑧!,!~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃!!) 

           sample the weight of word 𝑤!,!~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜑!!,!) 

           sample the retrieval score 𝑠,!~𝒩(𝜇!!,! ,𝜎!!,!) 

Input:   A query 𝑞 
Tags of a user 𝒯!  
Documents of a user 𝒟! 
An external corpus 𝒟!"#!$  

Output: An expanded query 𝑞′ 

/* step one: External documents fetch */ 

1. 𝑞𝒯! ← ⋃(𝑡 ∈ 𝒯!) 
2. for all 𝑑! ∈ 𝒟! do 

3.      𝑄𝒟! ← 𝐸𝑋𝑇𝑅𝐴𝐶𝑇𝑇𝑂𝑃(𝑤 ∈ 𝑑!) 

4. 𝑄!"#!$ ← 𝑞𝒯
! ∪ 𝑄𝒟! 

5. for all 𝑞! ∈ 𝑄!"#!$  do 

6.     𝒟!"#!$! ← 𝑅𝐸𝑇𝑅𝐼𝐸𝑉𝐸𝒟!"#!$(𝑞!) 

7.     Record retrieval score 𝑠!,!  

/* step two: User profile modelling */ 

8. for 𝑘 ∈ [1,𝐾] do 
9.     Initialize 𝜇!  and 𝜎!  randomly 
10. for 𝑑! ∈ 𝒯! ∪ 𝒟! ∪ 𝒟!"#!$!  do 

11.     for 𝑤! indexed by 𝑖 = 1,… ,𝑁!! do 

12.         Draw 𝑧!,!  from 𝑝!𝑧!,! = 𝑘! 

13.         Update 𝑛!,! and 𝑣!,!!,! 

14. Calculate the posterior estimate of 𝜃 and 𝜑 
/* step three: Personalized query expansion */ 

15. {𝑤! ,𝑤! …𝑤!} ← 𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ∪ 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ∪ 𝒯! 
16. for all 𝑤 ∈ {𝑤!,𝑤! …𝑤!} do  
17.     calculate 𝑃(𝑤|𝑞) using topics from step two 
18. Output 𝑞′ consists of top 𝛿 terms with the highest 𝑃(𝑤|𝑞) 

Table 2. Procedure for personalized search using 
social data 

703



In the above process, the retrieval scores of 
terms in the same document are the same and cal-
culated by a language model retrieval function 
(Manning et al., 2008) for retrieved documents in 
𝒟!"#!$! . The retrieval scores for 𝒯! (here all tags 
are concatenated and viewed as a single document) 
and documents in 𝒟! are set to one. We normal-
ize the scores by the max score in the retrieval list. 
We used a fixed number of latent topics 𝐾. The 
posterior distribution of topics depends on two 
sets of information, both the terms and retrieval 
scores of the documents. 

In this model, inference is intractable. We use 
Gibbs Sampling (Heck and Thomas, 2015) to per-
form approximate inference. We employ a conju-
gate prior for the multinomial distributions, and 
integrate out 𝜃 and 𝜑. In the sampling procedure, 
we need to calculate the conditional distribution 
𝑝 𝑧!,! = 𝑘  (line 12 in Table 2). By using Gibbs 
Sampling, for each word the topic is sampled 
from: 

𝑝 𝑧!,! = 𝑘 ∝
𝑛!,!,¬! + 𝛼
𝑛!,∙,¬! + 𝐾 ∙ 𝛼

 ×  
𝑣!,!!,!,¬ + 𝛽
𝑣!,∙,¬ + 𝑉 ∙ 𝛽

                          

×
1

𝑠!,!𝜎!!,! 2𝜋
exp −

ln 𝑠!,! − 𝜇!!,!
!

2𝜎!!,!!
 

where 𝑛!,!,¬! counts the number of times that top-
ic with index 𝑘 has been sampled from the  
multinomial distribution specific to document 𝑑! 
with the current 𝑧!,! not counted. Another counter 
variable 𝑣!,!!,!,¬ counts the number of times 𝑤!,! 
has been generated by topic 𝑘, but not counting 
the current 𝑤!,!. A dot denotes summation over all 
values of the variable whose index that dot takes. 
𝜇!!,! and 𝜎!!,! are elements from 𝜇! and 𝜎!, respec-
tively. After that we can calculate the posterior 
estimate of 𝜃 and 𝜑 (line 14 in Table 2).  

4.2 Separated Enhanced User Profiling 
In the MEUP model, 𝒯! , 𝒟!  and 𝒟!"#!$!  are 
mixed together to infer unified latent topics. How-
ever, the MEUP model may miss important in-
formation when the topics are learned. Our SEUP 
model extends the MEUP model by learning top-
ics which are shared between document-aligned 
pairs. In order to do this, we create pseudo-aligned 
documents between 𝒯!, 𝒟! and 𝒟!"#!$! . This pro-
cedure works as follows. For each external docu-
ment in 𝒟!"#!$!  retrieved by a query from 𝑄!"#!$, 

which is formed through step one of our approach, 
we treat the document (from 𝒟!"#!$! ) and the que-
ry (from 𝑄!"#!$) as pseudo-aligned documents in 
two groups. The first group we named source 
group 𝐶, the other group we named target group 𝐸. 
By using the aligned documents, we propose a 
model to learn the latent topics between the two 
groups.  

Note that in this case, there is a comparable 
document set aligned at the document-level. 
Therefore, 𝜃  can be viewed as a group inde-
pendent factor, and shared among comparable 
aligned documents. Henceforth, the generation 
process for the SEUP model is slightly different 
from the MEUP model. The generative process is 
summarized below: 

Generative process of the SEUP model 

1. for each of topics 𝑘 ∈ [1,𝐾] do  
 sample the mixture of words 𝜑~𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡 𝛽  
 sample the mixture of words 𝜙~𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛽) 
2. for each document pair 

𝑑! = {𝑑!! ∈ 𝒯! ∪ 𝒟! ,𝑑!! ∈ 𝒟!!"#$! } do  

   sample the mixture of topics 𝜃!~𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛼) 

for each word 𝑤!!  indexed by 𝑖 = 1,… ,𝑁!!!  do 

          sample the topic index topic 𝑧!,!! ~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃!!) 

          sample the weight of word 𝑤!,!!~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜑!!,!! ) 

          sample the retrieval score 𝑠!,!! ~𝒩(𝜇!!,!

for each word 𝑤!!  indexed by 𝑖 = 1,… ,𝑁!!!  do

         sample the retrieval score 𝑠!,!!~𝒩(𝜇!!,!
! ,𝜎!!,!

! ) 

Similar to the MEUP model, the updated for-
mulas for Gibbs sampling for the SEUP model are: 

𝑝 𝑧!,!! = 𝑘 ∝
𝑛!,!,¬!! + 𝑛!,!! + 𝛼
𝑛!,∙,¬!! + 𝑛!,∙! + 𝐾 ∙ 𝛼

×
𝑣!,!!,!! ,¬

The meaning of the symbols used in the SEUP 
model is the same as in the MEUP model, except 
this time for two groups E and C. In the two EUP 
models, the multinomial distribution of topics is 
specific to each document and each word can be 
easily inferred.

5 Topical Query Expansion 
In step three of our approach to personalization, 
we use the output from step two to build a QE 
model that calculates the weights of the profile 
terms to be added to the initial query. In this sec-
tion we detail this process. 

Given the query 𝑞 = {𝑤!
!}!!!!  of 𝑛 independent 

query terms, the probability of the query generat-
ing a word 𝑤 is defined as (see also (Lavrenko 
and Croft, 2001; Ganguly et al., 2012)): 

𝑃 𝑤 𝑞 = 𝑃(𝑤|𝑤!
! ,… ,𝑤!

!) ∝ 𝑃(𝑤|𝑤!
!)

!

!!!

 

We further assume that there are a set of rele-
vant documents {𝑑!}!!!!  related to the query and 
the word being considered, where 𝑁 is the number 
of documents. Incorporating this set of documents 
into the above equation leads to: 

𝑃 𝑤 𝑤!
! = 𝑃 𝑤 𝑑! 𝑃 𝑑! 𝑤!

! ∝
!

!!!

1
𝑁 𝑃 𝑤 𝑑! 𝑃 𝑤!

! 𝑑!

!

!!!

 

The calculation discards the uniform prior for 
𝑃(𝑤!

!), and takes the uniform prior of documents 
outside the summation.  

 As we already have outputs from step two, the 
documents inside the user profile can be used as a 
set of relevant documents in the above calculation. 
In addition, because we now have latent topics 
related to each document and each word, there is 
no longer a direct dependency of 𝑤 on 𝑑! and 𝑞. 
In this case, in order to estimate 𝑃 𝑤 𝑑! , we can 
marginalize the probability over the latent topic 
variables 𝑧!, then we have: 

𝑃 𝑤 𝑑! = 𝑃 𝑤 𝑧! 𝑃(𝑧!|𝑑!

!

!!!

) 

Similarly, the probability 𝑃 𝑤!
! 𝑑!  becomes: 

𝑃 𝑤!
! 𝑑! = 𝑃 𝑤!

! 𝑧! 𝑃(𝑧!|𝑑!

!

!!!

) 

   So that the probability of the query generating 
a word 𝑤 can be re-defined as: 

𝑃 𝑤 𝑤!
! ∝

1
𝑁 ( 𝑃 𝑤 𝑧! 𝑃(𝑧!|𝑑!

!

!!!

))×( 𝑃 𝑤!
! 𝑧! 𝑃(𝑧!|𝑑!

!

!!!

))
!

!!!

 

In the SEUP Model, we use one side of the 
word-topic distributions from the group that con-
tains tags and annotated documents to calculate 
the weighting. All the profile terms 
{𝑤!,𝑤!…𝑤!} = 𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ∪ 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚! ∪
𝒯! are ranked by their probability of being gener-
ated by the given query 𝑃 𝑤 𝑞  (line 16-17 in 
Table 2), and the top 𝛿 terms are chosen to expand 
the query. 

6 Evaluation 
In the following section we describe experiments 
which have been designed to evaluate the pro-
posed method. We start the section by discussing 
the experimental settings, and then we present and 
analyze the results.  

6.1 Experimental Setup 
In order to evaluate the above proposed methods 
on real-world data, we selected two delicious da-
tasets: socialbm0311 and deliciousT140, which 
are public, described and analyzed in (Zubiaga et 
al., 2009; Zubiaga et al., 2013). The deliciousT140 
dataset is made up by 144,574 unique URLs, all 
of them with their corresponding social tags re-
trieved from del.icio.us. However, this dataset 
does not contain the actual web pages (i.e. docu-
ments). So we used another socialbm0311 dataset. 
It contains the complete bookmarking activity for 
almost 2 million users. After matching the docu-
ments in deliciousT140 with the bookmark activi-
ties in socialbm0311, we obtained a total of 
5,153,720 bookmark activities, 259,511 users, 
131,283 web pages and 137,870 tags. We used a 
public parser3 to parse the web pages in order to 
get their textual content.  

We constructed two corpora from different ex-
ternal knowledge bases. The first corpus was ob-
tained from the largest encyclopedia – Wikipedia4. 
A Wikipedia snapshot was obtained on the 
14/08/2014, which contained a collection of 
4,634,369 articles. The second corpus consists of 
English news documents from the Glasgow Her-
ald 1995, Los Angeles Times 1994 and Los Ange-
les Times 2002, a collection made available by the 
CLEF AdHoc-News Test Suites (2004-2008) 5 , 
which we refer to as CLEF. This collection con-
tains 304,630 documents.  

To investigate the effects of enhanced user pro-
files, we selected two groups of users as test users. 
One group contains 1,000 randomly selected users 
with no more than 50 bookmarks (refer to as Us-
er-SMALL) and another group contains 1,000 
randomly selected users with more than 200 
bookmarks (refer to as User-LARGE). These two 
groups of users represent users with small amount

of and rich amount of past usage information re-
spectively. The English terms were processed by 
down-casing the alphabetic characters, removing 
the stop words and stemming words using the Por 
ter stemmer. For each user, 75% of his/her tags 
with annotated web pages were used to create the 
user profile and the other 25% were used as a test 
collection.  

The evaluation method used by previous re-
searchers in personalized social search (Xu et al., 
2008; Wang and Jin, 2010; Zhou et al., 2012a) is 
employed. The main assumption is as follows: 
Any documents tagged by 𝑢 with 𝑡 are considered 
relevant for the personalized query (𝑢, t) (𝑢 sub-
mits the query 𝑡). 

The following evaluation metrics were chosen 
to measure the effectiveness of the various ap-
proaches: the normalized discounted cumulative 
gain (NDCG), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and 
mean average precision (MAP) (Voorhees, 1999; 
Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2000). The average per-
formance over all users is calculated. Statistically 
significant differences were determined using a 
paired t-test at a confidence level of 95%. 

6.2 Experimental Runs 
The proposed approach is applied to social search 
personalization through the means of query ex-
pansion. We evaluate our proposed models and 
compare with several state-of-the-art methods as 
follows. 
LM A popular and quite robust language model 

retrieval method which has previously demon-
strated good results (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001). 
We compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence 
between the query and document language mod-
el as described in (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).   

LMRM A relevance model involves pseudo-
relevance feedback in the language model as in 
(Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). We include this 
model as a competitive non-personalized query 
expansion baseline. 

LMRM-external This is a modified version of 
the relevance model as described in (Diaz and 
Metzler, 2006). Instead of using the top-ranked 
documents as pseudo-relevance documents, this 
model uses external corpora to obtain the rele-
vance documents. We include this model as a 
strong non-personalized baseline as we also 
used external corpora in our models. In the ex-
periments, this method will acquire external 

documents from the Wikipedia corpus and 
CLEF. 

Co-occur This method has been used by several 
researchers. In this method the selection of ex-
pansion terms is based on their co-occurrence 
statistics with the query terms and other terms 
inside the user model. We used this approach as 
previously it demonstrated satisfactory perfor-
mance as in (Chirita et al., 2007). 

Co-tag Pure tag-tag relationships are also fa-
vored by many researchers. This method is 
based on the co-tagging activities a user per-
formed (Bender et al., 2008; Bertier et al., 2009; 
Bouadjenek et al., 2011). In this case, the user 
profiles contain training tags with their co-
tagging statistics computed using the Jaccard 
coefficient. 

Tag-topic-regu Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2012a) 
proposed a query expansion framework based 
on regularizing the smoothness of word associa-
tions over a connected graph using terms ex-
tracted from top-ranked documents. The user 
profiles are built according to a Tag-Topic mod-
el in a latent graph. We include the highest per-
forming method from their work for comparison. 

MEUP From our proposed methods, the MEUP 
method using the MEUP model and the topical 
query expansion method for social web search. 

SEUP This is our alternative proposed method, 
by using the SEUP model and the topical query 
expansion method to personalize search. 
The number of documents retrieved by each 

query in step one is set to γ = 5 empirically. Pa-
rameter λ used in the EXTRACTTOP function is 
set to 10. For the EUP modeling, 𝛼 and 𝛽 were set 
to 50/𝐾 and 0.01. In the expansion method, the 
number of expansion terms 𝛿 are set to 5. All the 
parameters in the other baseline models are set 
according to their tuning procedures in the origi-
nal papers 

6.3 Results 
Firstly we examine the experimental results that 
describe the performance of the proposed methods 
in this paper together with three non-personalized 
baselines on the overall test users, which are 
shown in Table 3. The statistically significant dif-
ferences are marked as l and w with respect to the 
LMRM and LMRM-external baselines as the-
se two methods work better than the simpler LM 

706



method. As illustrated by the results, the LM 
model was the lowest performer for all evaluation 
metrics for two groups of users. This result shows 
that merely borrowing common lexical-matching 
techniques from traditional information retrieval 
will not solve the personalized search problem. 
With the help of pseudo-relevance feedback, the 
LMRM and LMRM-external methods work 
consistently better than the LM baseline. This 
demonstrates the power of query expansion. Spe-
cifically, the technique that explores external cor-
pora to obtain the relevant documents works bet-
ter than the method which simply uses top-ranked 
documents. The results are consistent with previ-
ous research (Diaz and Metzler, 2006). The im-
provements are more noticeable when using Wik-
ipedia as the external corpus.  However, all the 
non-personalized baselines are outperformed by 
the personalized approaches including our pro-
posed methods MEUP and SEUP, all with statis-
tically significant results. This illustrates that non-
personalized query expansion methods can only 
bring limited improvements while methods with 
additional terms from the user profiles can greatly 
improve retrieval effectiveness. 

Next we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed methods compared to several personalized 

baselines that use only the users’ past information 
for query expansion, i.e. Co-occur, Co-tag and 
Tag-topic-regu methods. 

As seen from Table 3, three conclusions 
emerge. First, MEUP and SEUP both outper-
form all personalization methods previously pro-
posed, in all metrics measured with two external 
corpora for both groups of users. Moreover, the 
difference between our proposed methods and the 
baseline runs is always significant. We believe 
that the strong performance of our methods is due 
to the fact that our methods do not only consider a 
user’s past usage information, but also uses an 
external knowledge base to enhance the user pro-
filing process. Secondly, the SEUP method 
works consistently better than the MEUP method. 
This result confirms that merely mixing the doc-
uments from the historical evidence and external 
knowledge bases will miss some important infor-
mation. By treating the documents as a pseudo-
aligned corpus, we obtain much better perfor-
mance. The highest improvement over the best 
performing run reaches 54.95% (in terms of the 
SEUP method with the MRR metric when com-
pared to Tag-topic-regu by using Wikipedia as 
the external corpus in the User-SMALL group). 
Third, further improvements are achieved by us-

Fig. 1. Performance with different number of topics by using Wikipedia as external corpus in the   

user-SMALL group 

ing Wikipedia as the external corpus rather than 
using the CLEF collection. The possible reason, 
as pointed out by Diaz and Metzler (Diaz and 
Metzler, 2006), is that an external corpus is likely 
to be a better source of expansion terms if it has 
better topic coverage over the target corpus. The 
results also show that the improvements over 
baseline models in the User-SMALL group are 
more noticeable than in the User-LARGE group. 
However, the differences are small. This result 
confirms that our methods work well both for us-
ers with small amounts, and those with rich 
amounts of past usage information. 

We now examine the effect of the performance 
of the number of latent topics used in MEUP and 
SEUP. We vary the number of topics in both 
methods from 5 to 30, the results are shown in 
Figure 1, using Wikipedia as the external corpus 
in the user-SMALL group (we eliminated other 
results as they gave similar results). As can be 
seen from the figure, the highest performance is 
reached when the number of latent topics is 20 in 
MEUP and 25 in SEUP. When the number of 
topics continues to grow, the performance starts to 
degrade. However, even the lowest scored run still 
outperformed the strongest baseline. By varying 
the topic numbers, SEUP still outperforms 
MEUP.  

7 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we tackle the challenge of personal-
ized web search using social data in a novel way 
by building enhanced user profiles from the anno-
tations and resources the user has marked, togeth-
er with an external knowledge base. We present 

two probabilistic latent models to simultaneously 
incorporate social annotations, documents and the 
external knowledge base. In addition, we intro-
duce a topical query expansion model to enhance 
the search by utilizing individual user profiles. 
The proposed methods performed well on the so-
cial data crawled from the web, delivering statisti-
cally significant improvements over non-
personalized and personalized representative base-
line systems by constructing user profiles from a 
user’s historical usage information only. It is also 
confirmed that our proposed methods work well 
for both active and less active users. In future re-
search, we aim to automatically estimate the num-
ber of topics to be used in the EUP models. We 
also plan to explore the use of more external re-
sources and novel latent semantic models to en-
hance performance.
