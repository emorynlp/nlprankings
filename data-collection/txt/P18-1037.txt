Abstract

Abstract meaning representations (AMRs)
are broad-coverage sentence-level seman-
tic representations. AMRs represent sen-
tences as rooted labeled directed acyclic
graphs. AMR parsing is challenging partly
due to the lack of annotated alignments be-
tween nodes in the graphs and words in
the corresponding sentences. We intro-
duce a neural parser which treats align-
ments as latent variables within a joint
probabilistic model of concepts, relations
and alignments. As exact inference re-
quires marginalizing over alignments and
is infeasible, we use the variational auto-
encoding framework and a continuous re-
laxation of the discrete alignments. We
show that joint modeling is preferable to
using a pipeline of align and parse. The
parser achieves the best reported results
on the standard benchmark (74.4% on
LDC2016E25).

1 Introduction

Abstract meaning representations (AMRs) (Ba-
narescu et al., 2013) are broad-coverage sentence-
level semantic representations. AMR encodes,
among others, information about semantic rela-
tions, named entities, co-reference, negation and
modality. The semantic representations can be re-
garded as rooted labeled directed acyclic graphs
(see Figure 1). As AMR abstracts away from de-
tails of surface realization, it is potentially benefi-
cial in many semantic related NLP tasks, including
text summarization (Liu et al., 2015; Dohare and
Karnick, 2017), machine translation (Jones et al.,
2012) and question answering (Mitra and Baral,
2016).

AMR parsing has recently received a lot of at-
tention (e.g., (Flanigan et al., 2014; Artzi et al.,
2015; Konstas et al., 2017)). One distinctive
aspect of AMR annotation is the lack of ex-
plicit alignments between nodes in the graph (con-
cepts) and words in the sentences. Though this
arguably simplified the annotation process (Ba-
narescu et al., 2013), it is not straightforward to
produce an effective parser without relying on an
alignment. Most AMR parsers (Damonte et al.,
2017; Flanigan et al., 2016; Werling et al., 2015;
Wang and Xue, 2017; Foland and Martin, 2017)
use a pipeline where the aligner training stage pre-
cedes training a parser. The aligners are not di-
rectly informed by the AMR parsing objective and
may produce alignments suboptimal for this task.

In this work, we demonstrate that the align-
ments can be treated as latent variables in a joint
probabilistic model and induced in such a way as
to be beneficial for AMR parsing. Intuitively, in
our probabilistic model, every node in a graph
is assumed to be aligned to a word in a sen-
tence: each concept is predicted based on the cor-
responding RNN state. Similarly, graph edges
(i.e. relations) are predicted based on representa-
tions of concepts and aligned words (see Figure 2).
As alignments are latent, exact inference requires
marginalizing over latent alignments, which is in-



398

feasible. Instead we use variational inference,
specifically the variational autoencoding frame-
work of Kingma and Welling (2014). Using dis-
crete latent variables in deep learning has proven
to be challenging (Mnih and Gregor, 2014; Born-
schein and Bengio, 2015). We use a continu-
ous relaxation of the alignment problem, rely-
ing on the recently introduced Gumbel-Sinkhorn
construction (Mena et al., 2018). This yields a
computationally-efficient approximate method for
estimating our joint probabilistic model of con-
cepts, relations and alignments.

We assume injective alignments from concepts
to words: every node in the graph is aligned to
a single word in the sentence and every word is
aligned to at most one node in the graph. This is
necessary for two reasons. First, it lets us treat
concept identification as sequence tagging at test
time. For every word we would simply predict the
corresponding concept or predict NULL to signify
that no concept should be generated at this posi-
tion. Secondly, Gumbel-Sinkhorn can only work
under this assumption. This constraint, though of-
ten appropriate, is problematic for certain AMR
constructions (e.g., named entities). In order to
deal with these cases, we re-categorized AMR
concepts. Similar recategorization strategies have
been used in previous work (Foland and Martin,
2017; Peng et al., 2017).

The resulting parser achieves 74.4% Smatch
score on the standard test set when using
LDC2016E25 training set,1 an improvement of
3.4% over the previous best result (van Noord and
Bos, 2017). We also demonstrate that inducing
alignments within the joint model is indeed ben-
eficial. When, instead of inducing alignments, we
follow the standard approach and produce them
on preprocessing, the performance drops by 0.9%
Smatch. Our main contributions can be summa-
rized as follows:

• we introduce a joint probabilistic model for
alignment, concept and relation identifica-
tion;

• we demonstrate that a continuous relaxation
can be used to effectively estimate the model;

• the model achieves the best reported results.2

2 Probabilistic Model

In this section we describe our probabilistic model
and the estimation technique. In section 3, we de-
scribe preprocessing and post-processing (includ-
ing concept re-categorization, sense disambigua-
tion, wikification and root selection).

2.1 Notation and setting

We will use the following notation throughout the
paper. We refer to words in the sentences as w =
(w1, . . . , wn), where n is sentence length, wk ∈ V
for k ∈ {1 . . . , n}. The concepts (i.e. labeled
nodes) are c = (c1, . . . , cm), where m is the num-
ber of concepts and ci ∈ C for i ∈ {1 . . . ,m}. For
example, in Figure 1, c = (obligate, go, boy, -).3

Note that senses are predicted at post-processing,
as discussed in Section 3.2 (i.e. go is labeled as
go-02).

A relation between ‘predicate concept’ i and
‘argument concept’ j is denoted by rij ∈ R; it
is set to NULL if j is not an argument of i. In our
example, r2,3 = ARG0 and r1,3 = NULL. We will
use R to denote all relations in the graph.

To represent alignments, we will use a =
{a1, . . . , am}, where ai ∈ {1, . . . , n} returns the
index of a word aligned to concept i. In our exam-
ple, a1 = 3.

All three model components rely on bi-
directional LSTM encoders (Schuster and Paliwal,
1997). We denote states of BiLSTM (i.e. con-
catenation of forward and backward LSTM states)
as hk ∈ Rd (k ∈ {1, . . . , n}). The sentence
encoder takes pre-trained fixed word embeddings,
randomly initialized lemma embeddings, part-of-
speech and named-entity tag embeddings.

2.2 Method overview

We believe that using discrete alignments, rather
than attention-based models (Bahdanau et al.,
2015) is crucial for AMR parsing. AMR banks
are a lot smaller than parallel corpora used in ma-
chine translation (MT) and hence it is important
to inject a useful inductive bias. We constrain our
alignments from concepts to words to be injective.
First, it encodes the observation that concepts are
mostly triggered by single words (especially, after
re-categorization, Section 3.1). Second, it implies

3The probabilistic model is invariant to the ordering of
concepts, though the order affects the inference algorithm
(see Section 2.5). We use depth-first traversal of the graph
to generate the ordering.

that each word corresponds to at most one con-
cept (if any). This encourages competition: align-
ments are mutually-repulsive. In our example, ob-
ligate is not lexically similar to the word must and
may be hard to align. However, given that other
concepts are easy to predict, alignment candidates
other than must and the will be immediately ruled
out. We believe that these are the key reasons for
why attention-based neural models do not achieve
competitive results on AMR (Konstas et al., 2017)
and why state-of-the-art models rely on aligners.
Our goal is to combine best of two worlds: to
use alignments (as in state-of-the-art AMR meth-
ods) and to induce them while optimizing for the
end goal (similarly to the attention component of
encoder-decoder models).

Our model consists of three parts: (1) the
concept identification model Pθ(c|a,w); (2) the
relation identification model Pφ(R|a,w, c) and
(3) the alignment model Qψ(a|c, R,w).4 For-
mally, (1) and (2) together with the uniform
prior over alignments P (a) form the generative
model of AMR graphs. In contrast, the align-
ment model Qψ(a|c, R,w), as will be explained
below, is approximating the intractable posterior
Pθ,φ(a|c, R,w) within that probabilistic model.

In other words, we assume the following model
for generating the AMR graph:

Pθ,φ(c, R|w)=
∑
a

P (a)Pθ(c|a,w)Pφ(R|a,w, c)

P (a)

P (ci|hai)
m∏

i,j=1

P (rij |hai ,ci,haj ,cj)

4θ, φ and ψ denote all parameters of the models.

AMR concepts are assumed to be generated condi-
tional independently relying on the BiLSTM states
and surface forms of the aligned words. Similarly,
relations are predicted based only on AMR con-
cept embeddings and LSTM states corresponding
to words aligned to the involved concepts. Their
combined representations are fed into a bi-affine
classifier (Dozat and Manning, 2017) (see Fig-
ure 2).

The expression involves intractable marginal-
ization over all valid alignments. As stan-
dard in variational autoencoders, VAEs (Kingma
and Welling, 2014), we lower-bound the log-
likelihood as

logPθ,φ(c, R|w)
≥ EQ[logPθ(c|a,w)Pφ(R|a,w, c)]
−DKL(Qψ(a|c, R,w)||P (a)), (1)

where Qψ(a|c, R,w) is the variational posterior
(aka the inference network), EQ[. . .] refers to the
expectation under Qψ(a|c, R,w) and DKL is the
Kullback-Liebler divergence. In VAEs, the lower
bound is maximized both with respect to model
parameters (θ and φ in our case) and the parame-
ters of the inference network (ψ). Unfortunately,
gradient-based optimization with discrete latent
variables is challenging. We use a continuous re-
laxation of our optimization problem, where real-
valued vectors âi ∈ Rn (for every concept i) ap-
proximate discrete alignment variables ai. This
relaxation results in low-variance estimates of the
gradient using the parameterization trick (Kingma
and Welling, 2014), and ensures fast and stable
training. We will describe the model components
and the relaxed inference procedure in detail in
sections 2.6 and 2.7.

Though the estimation procedure requires the
use of the relaxation, the learned parser is straight-
forward to use. Given our assumptions about the
alignments, we can independently choose for each
word wk (k = 1, . . . ,m) the most probably con-
cept according to Pθ(c|hk). If the highest scor-
ing option is NULL, no concept is introduced.
The relations could then be predicted relying on
Pφ(R|a,w, c). This would have led to generating
inconsistent AMR graphs, so instead we search for
the highest scoring valid graph (see Section 3.2).
Note that the alignment model Qψ is not used at
test time and only necessary to train accurate con-
cept and relation identification models.

2.3 Concept identification model
The concept identification model chooses a con-
cept c (i.e. a labeled node) conditioned on the
aligned word k or decides that no concept should
be introduced (i.e. returns NULL). Though it can
be modeled with a softmax classifier, it would
not be effective in handling rare or unseen words.
First, we split the decision into estimating the
probability of concept category τ(c) ∈ T (e.g.
‘number’, ’frame’) and estimating the probabil-
ity of the specific concept within the chosen cat-
egory. Second, based on a lemmatizer and train-
ing data5 we prepare one candidate concept ek for
each word k in vocabulary (e.g., it would propose
want if the word is wants). Similar to Luong et al.
(2015), our model can then either copy the candi-
date ek or rely on the softmax over potential con-
cepts of category τ . Formally, the concept predic-
tion model is defined as

Pθ(c|hk, wk) = P (τ(c)|hk, wk)×
[[ek = c]]× exp(vTcopyhk) + exp(vTc hk)

Z(hk, θ)
,

where the first multiplicative term is a soft-
max classifier over categories (including NULL);
vcopy,vc ∈ Rd (for c ∈ C) are model parameters;
[[. . .]] denotes the indicator function and equals 1
if its argument is true and 0, otherwise; Z(h, θ) is
the partition function ensuring that the scores sum
to 1.

2.4 Relation identification model
We use the following arc-factored relation identi-
fication model:

Pφ(R|a,w, c) =
m∏

i,j=1

P (rij |hai ,ci,haj ,cj) (2)

Each term is modeled in exactly the same way:

1. for both endpoints, embedding of the concept
c is concatenated with the RNN state h;

2. they are linearly projected to a lower dimen-
sion separately through Mh(hai ◦ ci) ∈ Rdf
and Md(haj ◦ cj) ∈ Rdf , where ◦ denotes
concatenation;

3. a log-linear model with bilinear scores
Mh(hai ◦ ci)TCrMd(haj ◦ cj), Cr ∈ Rdf×df
is used to compute the probabilities.

5See supplementary materials.

In the above discussion, we assumed that BiL-
STM encodes a sentence once and the BiLSTM
states are then used to predict concepts and rela-
tions. In semantic role labeling, the task closely
related to the relation identification stage of AMR
parsing, a slight modification of this approach
was shown more effective (Zhou and Xu, 2015;
Marcheggiani et al., 2017). In that previous work,
the sentence was encoded by a BiLSTM once per
each predicate (i.e. verb) and the encoding was
in turn used to identify arguments of that predi-
cate. The only difference across the re-encoding
passes was a binary flag used as input to the BiL-
STM encoder at each word position. The flag
was set to 1 for the word corresponding to the
predicate and to 0 for all other words. In that
way, BiLSTM was encoding the sentence specif-
ically for predicting arguments of a given predi-
cate. Inspired by this approach, when predicting
label rij for j ∈ {1, . . . m}, we input binary flags
p1, . . .pn to the BiLSTM encoder which are set
to 1 for the word indexed by ai (pai = 1) and to
0 for other words (pj = 0, for j 6= ai). This also
means that BiLSTM encoders for predicting rela-
tions and concepts end up being distinct. We use
this multi-pass approach in our experiments.6

2.5 Alignment model

Recall that the alignment model is only used at
training, and hence it can rely both on input (states
h1, . . . ,hn) and on the list of concepts c1, . . . , cm.

Formally, we add (m−n) NULL concepts to the
list.7 Aligning a word to any NULL, would corre-
spond to saying that the word is not aligned to any
‘real’ concept. Note that each one-to-one align-
ment (i.e. permutation) between n such concepts
and n words implies a valid injective alignment
of n words to m ‘real’ concepts. This reduction
to permutations will come handy when we turn to
the Gumbel-Sinkhorn relaxation in the next sec-
tion. Given this reduction, from now on, we will
assume that m = n.

As with sentences, we use a BiLSTM model
to encode concepts c, where gi ∈ Rdg , i ∈
{1, . . . , n}. We use a globally-normalized align-

sults in 1.4% drop in Smatch score.

most cases. For exceptions, we append NULL to the sentence.

where Zψ(c,w) is the intractable partition func-
tion and the terms ϕ(gi,hai) score each alignment
link according to a bilinear form

ϕ(gi,hai) = g
T
i Bhai , (3)

where B ∈ Rdg×d is a parameter matrix.

2.6 Estimating model with Gumbel-Sinkhorn
Recall that our learning objective (1) involves ex-
pectation under the alignment model. The parti-
tion function of the alignment model Zψ(c,w) is
intractable, and it is tricky even to draw samples
from the distribution. Luckily, the recently pro-
posed relaxation (Mena et al., 2018) lets us cir-
cumvent this issue. First, note that exact samples
from a categorical distribution can be obtained us-
ing the perturb-and-max technique (Papandreou
and Yuille, 2011). For our alignment model, it
would correspond to adding independent noise to
the score for every possible alignment and choos-
ing the highest scoring one:

a? = argmax
a∈P

n∑
i=1

ϕ(gi,hai) + �a, (4)

where P is the set of all permutations of n
elements, �a is a noise drawn independently
for each a from the fixed Gumbel distribution
(G(0, 1)). Unfortunately, this is also intractable,
as there are n! permutations. Instead, in perturb-
and-max an approximate schema is used where
noise is assumed factorizable. In other words,
first noisy scores are computed as ϕ̂(gi,hai) =
ϕ(gi,hai) + �i,ai , where �i,ai ∼ G(0, 1) and
an approximate sample is obtained by a? =
argmaxa

∑n
i=1 ϕ̂(gi,hai),

Such sampling procedure is still intractable in
our case and also non-differentiable. The main
contribution of Mena et al. (2018) is approximat-
ing this argmax with a simple differentiable com-
putation â = St(Φ,Σ) which yields an approxi-
mate (i.e. relaxed) permutation. We use Φ and Σ
to denote the n × n matrices of alignment scores
ϕ(gi,hk) and noise variables �ik, respectively. In-
stead of returning index ai for every concept i,
it would return a (peaky) distribution over words
âi. The peakiness is controlled by the temperature

parameter t of Gumbel-Sinkhorn which balances
smoothness (‘differentiability’) vs. bias of the es-
timator. For further details and the derivation, we
refer the reader to the original paper (Mena et al.,
2018).

Note that Φ is a function of the alignment model
Qψ, so we will write Φψ in what follows. The
variational bound (1) can now be approximated as

EΣ∼G(0,1)[logPθ(c|St(Φψ,Σ),w)
+ logPφ(R|St(Φψ,Σ),w, c)]

−DKL(
Φψ + Σ

t
||Σ
t0

) (5)

Following Mena et al. (2018), the original KL
term from equation (1) is approximated by the KL
term between two n× n matrices of i.i.d. Gumbel
distributions with different temperature and mean.
The parameter t0 is the ‘prior temperature’.

Using the Gumbel-Sinkhorn construction un-
fortunately does not guarantee that

∑
i âij = 1. To

encourage this equality to hold, and equivalently
to discourage overlapping alignments, we add an-
other regularizer to the objective (5):

Ω(â, λ) = λ
∑
j

max(
∑
i

(âij)− 1, 0). (6)

Our final objective is fully differentiable with
respect to all parameters (i.e. θ, φ and ψ) and has
low variance as sampling is performed from the
fixed non-parameterized distribution, as in stan-
dard VAEs.

2.7 Relaxing concept and relation
identification

One remaining question is how to use the soft
input â = St(Φψ,Σ) in the concept and re-
lation identification models in equation (5). In
other words, we need to define how we compute
Pθ(c|St(Φψ,Σ),w) and Pφ(R|St(Φψ,Σ),w, c).

The standard technique would be to pass to the
models expectations under the relaxed variables∑n

k=1 âikhk, instead of the vectors hai (Maddison
et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2017). This is what we do
for the relation identification model. We use this
approach also to relax the one-hot encoding of the
predicate position (p, see Section 2.4).

However, the concept prediction model
logPθ(c|St(Φψ,Σ),w) relies on the pointing
mechanism, i.e. directly exploits the words w
rather than relies only on biLSTM states hk. So

instead we treat âi as a prior in a hierarchical
model:

As we will show in our experiments, a softer ver-
sion of the loss is even more effective:

logPθ(ci|âi,w)

≈ log
n∑
k=1

(âikPθ(ci|ai = k,w))α, (8)

where we set the parameter α = 0.5. We believe
that using this loss encourages the model to more
actively explore the alignment space. Geometri-
cally, the loss surface shaped as a ball in the 0.5-
norm space would push the model away from the
corners, thus encouraging exploration.

3 Pre- and post-pocessing

3.1 Re-Categorization

AMR parsers often rely on a pre-processing stage,
where specific subgraphs of AMR are grouped to-
gether and assigned to a single node with a new
compound category (e.g., Werling et al. (2015);
Foland and Martin (2017); Peng et al. (2017)); this
transformation is reversed at the post-processing
stage. Our approach is very similar to the Factored
Concept Label system of Wang and Xue (2017),
with one important difference that we unpack our
concepts before the relation identification stage, so
the relations are predicted between original con-
cepts (all nodes in each group share the same
alignment distributions to the RNN states). Intu-
itively, the goal is to ensure that concepts rarely
lexically triggered (e.g., thing in Figure 3) get
grouped together with lexically triggered nodes.

Such ‘primary’ concepts get encoded in the cat-
egory of the concept (the set of categories is τ , see
also section 2.3). In Figure 3, the re-categorized
concept thing(opinion) is produced from thing and
opine-01. We use concept as the dummy cate-
gory type. There are 8 templates in our system
which extract re-categorizations for fixed phrases
(e.g. thing(opinion)), and a deterministic system
for grouping lexically flexible, but structurally sta-
ble sub-graphs (e.g., named entities, have-rel-role-
91 and have-org-role-91 concepts).

Details of the re-categorization procedure and
other pre-processing are provided in appendix.

3.2 Post-processing

For post-processing, we handle sense-
disambiguation, wikification and ensure le-
gitimacy of the produced AMR graph. For sense
disambiguation we pick the most frequent sense
for that particular concept (‘-01’, if unseen). For
wikification we again look-up in the training set
and default to ”-”. There is certainly room for
improvement in both stages. Our probability
model predicts edges conditional independently
and thus cannot guarantee the connectivity of
AMR graph, also there are additional constraints
which are useful to impose. We enforce three
constraints: (1) specific concepts can have only
one neighbor (e.g., ‘number’ and ‘string’; see
appendix for details); (2) each predicate concept
can have at most one argument for each relation
r ∈ R; (3) the graph should be connected.
Constraint (1) is addressed by keeping only the
highest scoring neighbor. In order to satisfy the
last two constraints we use a simple greedy proce-
dure. First, for each edge, we pick-up the highest
scoring relation and edge (possibly NULL). If
the constraint (2) is violated, we simply keep the
highest scoring edge among the duplicates and
drop the rest. If the graph is not connected (i.e.
constraint (3) is violated), we greedily choose
edges linking the connected components until the
graph gets connected (MSCG in Flanigan et al.
(2014)).

Finally, we need to select a root node. Simi-
larly to relation identification, for each candidate
concept ci, we concatenate its embedding with
the corresponding LSTM state (hai) and use these
scores in a softmax classifier over all the concepts.

4 Experiments and Discussion

4.1 Data and setting

We primarily focus on the most recent
LDC2016E25 (R2) dataset, which consists
of 36521, 1368 and 1371 sentences in training,
development and testing sets, respectively. The
earlier LDC2015E86 (R1) dataset has been
used by much of the previous work. It contains
16833 training sentences, and same sentences for
development and testing as R2.8

We used the development set to perform model
selection and hyperparameter tuning. The hyper-
parameters, as well as information about embed-
dings and pre-processing, are presented in the sup-
plementary materials.

We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to opti-
mize the loss (5) and to train the root classifier.
Our best model is trained fully jointly, and we
do early stopping on the development set scores.
Training takes approximately 6 hours on a single
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with Intel Xeon CPU E5-
2620 v4.

4.2 Experiments and discussion

We start by comparing our parser to previous work
(see Table 1). Our model substantially outper-
forms all the previous models on both datasets.
Specifically, it achieves 74.4% Smatch score on
LDC2016E25 (R2), which is an improvement of
3.4% over character seq2seq model relying on
silver data (van Noord and Bos, 2017). For
LDC2015E86 (R1), we obtain 73.7% Smatch

of Foland and Martin (2017).

In order to disentangle individual phenomena,
we use the AMR-evaluation tools (Damonte et al.,
2017) and compare to systems which reported
these scores (Table 2). We obtain the highest
scores on most subtasks. The exception is nega-
tion detection. However, this is not too surpris-
ing as many negations are encoded with morphol-
ogy, and character models, unlike our word-level
model, are able to capture predictive morphologi-
cal features (e.g., detect prefixes such as “un-” or
“im-”).

Now, we turn to ablation tests (see Table 3).
First, we would like to see if our latent align-
ment framework is beneficial. In order to test this,
we create a baseline version of our system (‘pre-
align’) which relies on the JAMR aligner (Flani-

gan et al., 2014), rather than induces alignments as
latent variables. Recall that in our model we used
training data and a lemmatizer to produce candi-
dates for the concept prediction model (see Sec-
tion 2.3, the copy function). In order to have a
fair comparison, if a concept is not aligned after
JAMR, we try to use our copy function to align it.
If an alignment is not found, we make the align-
ment uniform across the unaligned words. In pre-
liminary experiments, we considered alternatives
versions (e.g., dropping concepts unaligned by
JAMR or dropping concepts unaligned after both
JAMR and the matching heuristic), but the chosen
strategy was the most effective. These scores of
pre-align are superior to the results from Foland
and Martin (2017) which also relies on JAMR
alignments and uses BiLSTM encoders. There
are many potential reasons for this difference in
performance. For example, their relation identi-
fication model is different (e.g., single pass, no
bi-affine modeling), they used much smaller net-
works than us, they use plain JAMR rather than a
combination of JAMR and our copy function, they
use a different recategorization system. These re-
sults confirm that we started with a strong basic
model, and that our variational alignment frame-
work provided further gains in performance.

Now we would like to confirm that joint train-
ing of alignments with both concepts and relations
is beneficial. In other words, we would like to see
if alignments need to be induced in such a way

as to benefit the relation identification task. For
this ablation we break the full joint training into
two stages. We start by jointly training the align-
ment model and the concept identification model.
When these are trained, we optimizing the relation
model but keep the concept identification model
and alignment models fixed (‘2 stages’ in see Ta-
ble 4). When compared to our joint model (‘full
model’), we observe a substantial drop in Smatch
score (-0.8%). In another version (‘2 stages, tune
align’) we also use two stages but we fine-tune
the alignment model on the second stage. This
approach appears slightly more accurate but still
-0.5% below the full model. In both cases, the
drop is more substantial for relations (‘SRL’). In
order to see why relations are potentially useful
in learning alignments, consider Figure 4. The
example contains duplicate concepts long. The
concept prediction model factorizes over concepts
and does not care which way these duplicates are
aligned: correctly (green edges) or not (red edges).
Formally, the true posterior under the concept-
only model in ‘2 stages’ assigns exactly the same
probability to both configurations, and the align-
ment model Qψ will be forced to mimic it (even
though it relies on an LSTM model of the graph).
The spurious ambiguity will have a detrimental ef-
fect on the relation identification stage.

It is interesting to see the contribution of other
modeling decisions we made when modeling and
relaxing alignments. First, instead of using
Gumbel-Sinkhorn, which encourages mutually-
repulsive alignments, we now use a factorized
alignment model. Note that this model (‘No
Sinkhorn’ in Table 5) still relies on (relaxed) dis-
crete alignments (using Gumbel softmax) but does
not constrain the alignments to be injective. A
substantial drop in performance indicates that the
prior knowledge about the nature of alignments
appears beneficial. Second, we remove the addi-
tional regularizer for Gumbel-Sinkhorn approxi-
mation (equation (6)). The performance drop in



405

Smatch score (‘No Sinkhorn reg’) is only moder-
ate. Finally, we show that using the simple hier-
archical relaxation (equation (7)) rather than our
softer version of the loss (equation (8)) results in
a substantial drop in performance (‘No soft loss’,
-0.7% Smatch). We hypothesize that the softer
relaxation favors exploration of alignments and
helps to discover better configurations.

5 Additional Related Work

Alignment performance has been previously iden-
tified as a potential bottleneck affecting AMR
parsing (Damonte et al., 2017; Foland and Mar-
tin, 2017). Some recent work has focused on
building aligners specifically for training their
parsers (Werling et al., 2015; Wang and Xue,
2017). However, those aligners are trained in-
dependently of concept and relation identification
and only used at pre-processing.

Treating alignment as discrete variables has
been successful in some sequence transduction
tasks with neural models (Yu et al., 2017, 2016).
Our work is similar in that we also train dis-
crete alignments jointly but the tasks, the inference
framework and the decoders are very different.

The discrete alignment modeling framework
has been developed in the context of traditional
(i.e. non-neural) statistical machine transla-
tion (Brown et al., 1993). Such translation mod-
els have also been successfully applied to semantic
parsing tasks (e.g., (Andreas et al., 2013)), where
they rivaled specialized semantic parsers from that
period. However, they are considerably less accu-
rate than current state-of-the-art parsers applied to
the same datasets (e.g., (Dong and Lapata, 2016)).

For AMR parsing, another way to avoid us-
ing pre-trained aligners is to use seq2seq models
(Konstas et al., 2017; van Noord and Bos, 2017).
In particular, van Noord and Bos (2017) used char-
acter level seq2seq model and achieved the previ-
ous state-of-the-art result. However, their model is
very data demanding as they needed to train it on
additional 100K sentences parsed by other parsers.
This may be due to two reasons. First, seq2seq
models are often not as strong on smaller datasets.
Second, recurrent decoders may struggle with pre-
dicting the linearized AMRs, as many statistical
dependencies are highly non-local.

6 Conclusions

We introduced a neural AMR parser trained by
jointly modeling alignments, concepts and rela-
tions. We make such joint modeling computa-
tionally feasible by using the variational auto-
encoding framework and continuous relaxations.
The parser achieves state-of-the-art results and ab-
lation tests show that joint modeling is indeed ben-
eficial.

We believe that the proposed approach may be
extended to other parsing tasks where alignments
are latent (e.g., parsing to logical form (Liang,
2016)). Another promising direction is integrating
character seq2seq to substitute the copy function.
This should also improve the handling of nega-
tion and rare words. Though our parsing model
does not use any linearization of the graph, we re-
lied on LSTMs and somewhat arbitrary lineariza-
tion (depth-first traversal) to encode the AMR
graph in our alignment model. A better alter-
native would be to use graph convolutional net-
works (Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017; Kipf and
Welling, 2017): neighborhoods in the graph are
likely to be more informative for predicting align-
ments than the neighborhoods in the graph traver-
sal.
