Abstract

Vector-space word representations have
been very successful in recent years at im-
proving performance across a variety of
NLP tasks. However, common to most
existing work, words are regarded as in-
dependent entities without any explicit re-
lationship among morphologically related
words being modeled. As a result, rare and
complex words are often poorly estimated,
and all unknown words are represented
in a rather crude way using only one or
a few vectors. This paper addresses this
shortcoming by proposing a novel model
that is capable of building representations
for morphologically complex words from
their morphemes. We combine recursive
neural networks (RNNs), where each mor-
pheme is a basic unit, with neural language
models (NLMs) to consider contextual
information in learning morphologically-
aware word representations. Our learned
models outperform existing word repre-
sentations by a good margin on word sim-
ilarity tasks across many datasets, includ-
ing a new dataset we introduce focused on
rare words to complement existing ones in
an interesting way.

1 Introduction

The use of word representations or word clusters
pretrained in an unsupervised fashion from lots of
text has become a key “secret sauce” for the suc-
cess of many NLP systems in recent years, across
tasks including named entity recognition, part-of-
speech tagging, parsing, and semantic role label-
ing. This is particularly true in deep neural net-
work models (Collobert et al., 2011), but it is also
true in conventional feature-based models (Koo et
al., 2008; Ratinov and Roth, 2009).

Deep learning systems give each word a
distributed representation, i.e., a dense low-
dimensional real-valued vector or an embedding.
The main advantage of having such a distributed
representation over word classes is that it can cap-
ture various dimensions of both semantic and syn-
tactic information in a vector where each dimen-
sion corresponds to a latent feature of the word. As
a result, a distributed representation is compact,
less susceptible to data sparsity, and can implicitly
represent an exponential number of word clusters.

However, despite the widespread use of word
clusters and word embeddings, and despite much
work on improving the learning of word repre-
sentations, from feed-forward networks (Bengio
et al., 2003) to hierarchical models (Morin, 2005;
Mnih and Hinton, 2009) and recently recurrent
neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et
al., 2011), these approaches treat each full-form
word as an independent entity and fail to cap-
ture the explicit relationship among morphologi-
cal variants of a word.1 The fact that morphologi-
cally complex words are often rare exacerbates the
problem. Though existing clusterings and embed-
dings represent well frequent words, such as “dis-
tinct”, they often badly model rare ones, such as
“distinctiveness”.

In this work, we use recursive neural networks
(Socher et al., 2011b), in a novel way to model
morphology and its compositionality. Essentially,
we treat each morpheme as a basic unit in the
RNNs and construct representations for morpho-
logically complex words on the fly from their mor-
phemes. By training a neural language model
(NLM) and integrating RNN structures for com-
plex words, we utilize contextual information in

1An almost exception is the word clustering of (Clark,
2003), which does have a model of morphology to encour-
age words ending with the same suffix to appear in the same
class, but it still does not capture the relationship between a
word and its morphologically derived forms.

an interesting way to learn morphemic semantics
and their compositional properties. Our model
has the capability of building representations for
any new unseen word comprised of known mor-
phemes, giving the model an infinite (if still in-
complete) covered vocabulary.

Our learned representations outperform pub-
licly available embeddings by a good margin on
word similarity tasks across many datasets, which
include our newly released dataset focusing on
rare words (see Section 5). The detailed analysis
in Section 6 reveals that our models can blend well
syntactic information, i.e., the word structure, and
the semantics in grouping related words.2

2 Related Work

Neural network techniques have found success in
several NLP tasks recently such as sentiment anal-
ysis at the sentence (Socher et al., 2011c) and
document level (Glorot et al., 2011), language
modeling (Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov and
Zweig, 2012), paraphrase detection (Socher et al.,
2011a), discriminative parsing (Collobert, 2011),
and tasks involving semantic relations and compo-
sitional meaning of phrases (Socher et al., 2012).

Common to many of these works is use of a
distributed word representation as the basic input
unit. These representations usually capture lo-
cal cooccurrence statistics but have also been ex-
tended to include document-wide context (Huang
et al., 2012). Their main advantage is that they
can both be learned unsupervisedly as well as be
tuned for supervised tasks. In the former training
regiment, they are evaluated by how well they can
capture human similarity judgments. They have
also been shown to perform well as features for
supervised tasks, e.g., NER (Turian et al., 2010).

While much work has focused on different ob-
jective functions for training single and multi-
word vector representations, very little work has
been done to tackle sub-word units and how they
can be used to compute syntactic-semantic word
vectors. Collobert et al. (2011) enhanced word
vectors with additional character-level features
such as capitalization but still can not recover
more detailed semantics for very rare or unseen
words, which is the focus of this work.

This is somewhat ironic, since working out cor-

rect morphological inflections was a very central
problem in early work in the parallel distributed
processing paradigm and criticisms of it (Rumel-
hart and McClelland, 1986; Plunkett and March-
man, 1991), and later work developed more so-
phisticated models of morphological structure and
meaning (Gasser and Lee, 1990; Gasser, 1994),
while not providing a compositional semantics nor
working at the scale of what we present.

To the best of our knowledge, the work clos-
est to ours in terms of handing unseen words are
the factored NLMs (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff,
2006) and the compositional distributional seman-
tic models (DSMs) (Lazaridou et al., 2013). In
the former work, each word is viewed as a vec-
tor of features such as stems, morphological tags,
and cases, in which a single embedding matrix is
used to look up all of these features.3 Though
this is a principled way of handling new words in
NLMs, the by-product word representations, i.e.
the concatenations of factor vectors, do not en-
code in them the compositional information (they
are stored in the NN parameters). Our work does
not simply concatenate vectors of morphemes, but
rather combines them using RNNs, which cap-
tures morphological compositionality.

The latter work experimented with different
compositional DSMs, originally designed to learn
meanings of phrases, to derive representations for
complex words, in which the base unit is the mor-
pheme similar to ours. However, their models can
only combine a stem with an affix and does not
support recursive morpheme composition. It is,
however, interesting to compare our neural-based
representations with their DSM-derived ones and
cross test these models on both our rare word
similarity dataset and their nearest neighbor one,
which we leave as future work.

Mikolov et al. (2013) examined existing word
embeddings and showed that these representations
already captured meaningful syntactic and seman-
tic regularities such as the singular/plural relation
that xapple - xapples ≈ xcar - xcars. However,
we believe that these nice relationships will not
hold for rare and complex words when their vec-
tors are poorly estimated as we analyze in Sec-
tion 6. Our model, on the other hand, explicitly
represents these regularities through morphologi-
cal structures of words.

3(Collobert et al., 2011) used multiple embeddings, one
per discrete feature type, e.g., POS, Gazeteer, etc.

Figure 1: Morphological Recursive Neural Net-
work. A vector representation for the word “un-
fortunately” is constructed from morphemic vec-
tors: unpre, fortunatestm, lysuf. Dotted nodes are
computed on-the-fly and not in the lexicon.

3 Morphological RNNs

Our morphological Recursive Neural Network
(morphoRNN) is similar to (Socher et al., 2011b),
but operates at the morpheme level instead of at
the word level. Specifically, morphemes, the mini-
mum meaning-bearing unit in languages, are mod-
eled as real-valued vectors of parameters, and are
used to build up more complex words. We assume
access to a dictionary of morphemic analyses of
words, which will be detailed in Section 4.

Following (Collobert and Weston, 2008), dis-
tinct morphemes are encoded by column vectors
in a morphemic embedding matrix We ∈ Rd×|M|,
where d is the vector dimension and M is an or-
dered set of all morphemes in a language.

As illustrated in Figure 1, vectors of morpho-
logically complex words are gradually built up
from their morphemic representations. At any lo-
cal decision (a dotted node), a new parent word
vector (p) is constructed by combining a stem vec-
tor (xstem) and an affix vector (xaffix) as follow:

p = f(Wm[xstem; xaffix] + bm) (1)

Here, Wm ∈ Rd×2d is a matrix of morphemic pa-
rameters while bm ∈ Rd×1 is an intercept vector.
We denote an element-wise activation function as
f , such as tanh. This forms the basis of our mor-
phoRNN models with θ = {We, Wm, bm} being
the parameters to be learned.

3.1 Context-insensitive Morphological RNN
Our first model examines how well morphoRNNs
could construct word vectors simply from the mor-
phemic representation without referring to any
context information. Input to the model is a refer-
ence embedding matrix, i.e. word vectors trained
by an NLM such as (Collobert and Weston, 2008)

and (Huang et al., 2012). By assuming that these
reference vectors are right, the goal of the model
is to construct new representations for morpholog-
ically complex words from their morphemes that
closely match the corresponding reference ones.

Specifically, the structure of the context-
insensitive morphoRNN (cimRNN) is the same as
the basic morphoRNN. For learning, we first de-
fine a cost function s for each word xi as the
squared Euclidean distance between the newly-
constructed representation pc(xi) and its refer-
ence vector pr(xi): s (xi) = ∥pc(xi) − pr(xi)∥22.

The objective function is then simply the sum of
all individual costs over N training examples, plus
a regularization term, which we try to minimize:

J(θ) =

N∑

i=1

s (xi) +
λ

∥θ∥22 (2)

3.2 Context-sensitive Morphological RNN

The cimRNN model, though simple, is interesting
to attest if morphemic semantics could be learned
solely from an embedding. However, it is lim-
ited in several aspects. Firstly, the model has
no chance of improving representations for rare
words which might have been poorly estimated.
For example, “distinctness” and “unconcerned”
are very rare, occurring only 141 and 340 times
in Wikipedia documents, even though their corre-
sponding stems “distinct” and “concern” are very
frequent (35323 and 26080 respectively). Trying
to construct exactly those poorly-estimated word
vectors might result in a bad model with parame-
ters being pushed in wrong directions.

Secondly, though word embeddings learned
from an NLM could, in general, blend well both
the semantic and syntactic information, it would
be useful to explicitly model another kind of syn-
tactic information, the word structure, as we train
our embeddings. Motivated by these limitations,
we propose a context-sensitive morphoRNN (csm-
RNN) which integrates RNN structures into NLM
training, allowing for contextual information be-
ing taken into account in learning morphemic
compositionality. Specifically, we adopt the NLM
training approach proposed in (Collobert et al.,
2011) to learn word embeddings, but build rep-
resentations for complex words from their mor-
phemes. During learning, updates at the top level
of the neural network will be back-propagated all
the way till the morphemic layer.

Figure 2: Context-sensitive morphological RNN
has two layers: (a) the morphological RNN, which
constructs representations for words from their
morphemes and (b) the word-based neural lan-
guage which optimizes scores for relevant ngrams.

Structure-wise, we stack the NLM on top of our
morphoRNN as illustrated in Figure 2. Complex
words like “unfortunately” and “closed” are con-
structed from their morphemic vectors, unpre +
fortunatestm + lysuf and closestm + dsuf, whereas
simple words4, i.e. stems, and affixes could be
looked up from the morphemic embedding ma-
trix We as in standard NLMs. Once vectors of all
complex words have been built, the NLM assigns
a score for each ngram ni consisting of words
x1, . . . , xn as follows:

s (ni) = υ
⊤f(W [x1; . . . ; xn] + b)

Here, xj is the vector representing the word xj .
We follow (Huang et al., 2012) to use a sim-
ple feed-forward network with one h-dimensional
hidden layer. W ∈ Rh×nd, b ∈ Rh×1, and
υ ∈ Rh×1 are parameters of the NLM, and f is
an element-wise activation function as in Eq. (1).
We adopt a ranking-type cost in defining our ob-
jective function to minimize as below:

J(θ) =

N∑

i=1

max{0, 1 − s (ni) + s (ni)} (3)

Here, N is the number of all available ngrams in
the training corpus, whereas ni is a “corrupted”
ngram created from ni by replacing its last word
with a random word similar in spirit to (Smith
and Eisner, 2005). Our model parameters are
θ = {We, Wm, bm,W , b, υ}.

Such a ranking criterion influences the model
to assign higher scores to valid ngrams than to

invalid ones and has been demonstrated in (Col-
lobert et al., 2011) to be both efficient and effective
in learning word representations.

3.3 Learning

Our models alternate between two stages: (1) for-
ward pass – recursively construct morpheme trees
(cimRNN, csmRNN) and language model struc-
tures (csmRNN) to derive scores for training ex-
amples and (2) back-propagation pass – compute
the gradient of the corresponding object function
with respect to the model parameters.

For the latter pass, computing the objective gra-
dient amounts to estimating the gradient for each
individual cost ∂s(x)

∂θ
, where x could be either a

word (cimRNN) or an ngram (csmRNN). We have
the objective gradient for the cimRNN derived as:

∂J(θ)

∂θ
=

N∑

i=1

∂s (xi)

∂θ
+ λθ

In the case of csmRNN, since the objective
function in Eq. (3) is not differentiable, we use the
subgradient method (Ratliff et al., 2007) to esti-
mate the objective gradient as:

∂J(θ)

∂θ
=

∑

i:1−s(ni)+s(ni)>0
−∂s (ni)

∂θ
+

∂s (ni)

∂θ

Back-propagation through structures (Goller
and Küchler, 1996) is employed to compute the
gradient for each individual cost with similar for-
mulae as in (Socher et al., 2010). Unlike their
RNN structures over sentences, where each sen-
tence could have an exponential number of deriva-
tions, our morphoRNN structure per word is, in
general, deterministic. Each word has a single
morphological tree structure which is constructed
from the main morpheme (the stem) and gradu-
ally appended affixes in a fixed order (see Sec-
tion 4 for more details). As a result, both our
forward and backward passes over morphologi-
cal structures are efficient with no recursive calls
implementation-wise.

4 Unsupervised Morphological
Structures

We utilize an unsupervised morphological seg-
mentation toolkit, named Morfessor by Creutz and
Lagus (2007), to obtain segmentations for words
in our vocabulary. Morfessor segments words in

107



two stages: (a) it recursively splits words to min-
imize an objective inspired by the minimum de-
scription length principle and (b) it labels mor-
phemes with tags pre (prefixes), stm (stems),
and suf (suffixes) using hidden Markov models.

Morfessor captures a general word structure of
the form (pre∗ stm suf∗)+, which is handy
for words in morphologically rich languages like
Finnish or Turkish. However, such general form is
currently unnecessary in our models as the mor-
phoRNNs assume input of the form pre∗ stm
suf∗ for efficient learning of the RNN structures:
a stem is always combined with an affix to yield a
new stem.5 We, thus, postprocess as follows:

(1) Restrict segmentations to the form pre∗

stm{1, 2} suf∗: allow us to capture compounds.
(2) Split hyphenated words A-B as Astm Bstm.
(3) For a segmentation with two stems, pre∗

Astm Bstm suf∗, we decide if one could be a main
stem while the other could functions as an affix.6

Otherwise, we reject the segmentation. This will
provide us with more interesting morphemes such
as alpre in Arabic names (al-jazeera, al-salem) and
relatedsuf in compound adjectives (health-related,
government-related).

(4) To enhance precision, we reject a segmen-
tation if it has either an affix or an unknown stem
(not a word by itself) whose type count is below a
predefined threshold7.

The final list of affixes produced is given in Ta-
ble 1. Though generally reliable, our final seg-
mentations do contain errors, most notably non-
compositional ones, e.g. depre faultstm edsuf or
repre turnstm ssuf. With a sufficiently large num-
ber of segmentation examples, we hope that the
model would be able to pick up general trends
from the data. In total, we have about 22K com-
plex words out of a vocabulary of 130K words.

Examples of words with interesting affixes are
given in Table 2. Beside conventional affixes, non-
conventional ones like “0” or “mc” help further
categorize rare or unknown words into meaningful
groups such as measurement words or names.

5When multiple affixes are present, we use a simple
heuristic to first merge suffixes into stems and then combine
prefixes. Ideally, we would want to learn and generate an
order for such combination, which we leave for future work.

6We first aggregate type counts of pairs (A, left) and (B,
right) across all segmentations with two stems. Once done,
we label A as stm and B as suf if count (B, right) > 2 ×
count (A, left), and conversely, we label them as Apre Bstm if
count (A, left) > 2 × count(B, right). Our rationale was that

5 Experiments

As our focus is in learning morphemic seman-
tics, we do not start training from scratch, but
rather, initialize our models with existing word
representations. In our experiments, we make
use of two publicly-available embeddings (50-
dimensional) provided by(Collobert et al., 2011)
(denoted as C&W)8 and Huang et al. (2012) (re-
ferred as HSMN)9.

Both of these representations are trained on
Wikipedia documents using the same ranking-type
cost function as in Eq. (3). The latter further uti-
lizes global context and adopts a multi-prototype
approach, i.e. each word is represented by mul-
tiple vectors, to better capture word semantics in
various contexts. However, we only use their
single-prototype embedding10 and as we train, we

do not consider the global sentence-level context
information. It is worth to note that these aspects
of the HSMN embedding – incorporating global
context and maintaining multiple prototypes – are
orthogonal to our approach, which would be inter-
esting to investigate in future work.

For the context-sensitive morphoRNN model,
we follow Huang et al. (2012) to use the April
2010 snapshot of the Wikipedia corpus (Shaoul
and Westbury, 2010). All paragraphs containing
non-roman characters are removed while the re-
maining text are lowercased and then tokenized.
The resulting clean corpus contains about 986 mil-
lion tokens. Each digit is then mapped into 0, i.e.
2013 will become 0000. Other rare words not in
the vocabularies of C&W and HSMN are mapped
to an UNKNOWN token, and we use <s> and
</s> for padding tokens representing the begin-
ning and end of each sentence.

Follow (Huang et al., 2012)’s implementation,
which our code is based on initially, we use 50-
dimensional vectors to represent morphemic and
word embeddings. For cimRNN, the regulariza-
tion weight λ is set to 10−2. For csmRNN, we use
10-word windows of text as the local context, 100
hidden units, and no weight regularization.

5.1 Word Similarity Task

Similar to (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) and
(Huang et al., 2012), we evaluate the quality of our
morphologically-aware embeddings on the popu-
lar WordSim-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002),
WS353 for short. In this task, we compare corre-
lations between the similarity scores given by our
models and those rated by human.

To avoid overfitting our models to a single
dataset, we benchmark our models on a vari-
ety of others including MC (Miller and Charles,
1991), RG (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965),
SCWS∗11 (Huang et al., 2012), and our new rare
word (RW) dataset (details in §5.1.1). Information
about these datasets are summarized in Table 3

We also examine these datasets from the
“rareness” aspect by looking at distributions of
words across frequencies as in Table 4. The first
bin counts unknown words in each dataset, while
the remaining bins group words based on their

11SCWS∗ is a modified version of the Stanford’s contex-
tual word similarities dataset. The original one utilizes sur-
rounding contexts in judging word similarities and includes
pairs of identical words, e.g. financial bank vs. river bank.
We exclude these pairs and ignore the provided contexts.

frequencies extracted from Wikipedia documents.
It is interesting to observe that WS353, MC, RG
contain very frequent words and have few complex
words (only WS353 has).12 SCWS∗ and RW have
a more diverse set of words in terms of frequencies
and RW has the largest number of unknown and
rare words, which makes it a challenging dataset.

Table 4: Word distribution by frequencies – dis-
tinct words in each dataset are grouped based on
frequencies and counts are reported for the fol-
lowing bins : unknown | [1, 100] / [101, 1000] /
[1001, 10000] / [10001, ∞). We report counts for
all words in each dataset as well as complex ones.

5.1.1 Rare Word Dataset
As evidenced in Table 4, most existing word sim-
ilarity datasets contain frequent words and few of
them possesses enough rare or morphologically
complex words that we could really attest the ex-
pressiveness of our morphoRNN models. In fact,
we believe a good embedding in general should be
able to learn useful representations for not just fre-
quent words but also rare ones. That motivates us
to construct another dataset focusing on rare words
to complement existing ones.

Our dataset construction proceeds in three
stages: (1) select a list of rare words, (2) for each
of the rare words, find another word (not neces-
sarily rare) to form a pair, and (3) collect human
judgments on how similar each pair is.

12All these counts are with respect to the vocabulary list in
the C&W embedding (we obtain similar figures for HSMN).

Rare word selection: our choices of rare words
(word1) are based on their frequencies – based on
five bins (5, 10], (10, 100], (100, 1000], (1000,
10000], and the affixes they possess. To create a
diverse set of candidates, we randomly select 15
words for each configuration (a frequency bin, an
affix). At the scale of Wikipedia, a word with
frequency of 1-5 is most likely a junk word, and
even restricted to words with frequencies above
five, there are still many non-English words. To
counter such problems, each word selected is re-
quired to have a non-zero number of synsets in
WordNet(Miller, 1995).

Table 5 (top) gives examples of rare words se-
lected and organized by frequencies and affixes. It
is interesting to find out that words like obtainment
and acquirement are extremely rare (not in tradi-
tional dictionaries) but are perfectly understand-
able. We also have less frequent words like revet-
ment from French or organismal from biology.

Pair construction: following (Huang et al.,
2012), we create pairs with interesting relation-
ships for each word1 as follow. First, a Word-
Net synset of word1 is randomly selected, and we
construct a set of candidates which connect to that
synset through various relations, e.g., hypernyms,
hyponyms, holonyms, meronyms, and attributes.
A word2 is then randomly selected from these can-
didates, and the process is repeated another time
to generate a total of two pairs for each word1.
Sample word pairs are given in Table 5 in which
word2 includes mostly frequent words, implying
a balance of words in terms of frequencies in our
dataset. We collected 3145 pairs after this stage

Human judgment: we use Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk to collect 10 human similarity ratings on
a scale of [0, 10] per word pair.13 Such procedure
has been demonstrated by Snow et al. (2008) in
replicating ratings for the MC dataset, achieving
close inter-annotator agreement with expert raters.
Since our pairs contain many rare words which are

13We restrict to only US-based workers with 95% approval
rate and ask for native speakers to rate 20 pairs per hit.

challenging even to native speakers, we ask raters
to indicate for each pair if they do not know the
first word, the second word, or both. We use such
information to collect reliable ratings by either dis-
card pairs which many people do not know or col-
lect additional ratings to ensure we have 10 rat-
ings per pair.14 As a result, only 2034 pairs are
retained.

5.2 Results
We evaluate the quality of our morphoRNN em-
beddings through the word similarity task dis-
cussed previously. The Spearman’s rank correla-
tion is used to gauge how well the relationship be-
tween two variables, the similarity scores given by
the NLMs and the human annotators, could be de-
scribed using a monotonic function.

Detailed performance of the morphoRNN em-
beddings trained from either the HSMN or the
C&W embeddings are given in Table 7 for
all datasets. We also report baseline results
(rows HSMN, C&W) using these initial embed-
dings alone, which interestingly reveals strengths
and weaknesses of existing embeddings. While
HSMN is good for datasets with frequent words
(WS353, MC, and RG), its performances for those
with more rare and complex words (SCWS∗ and
RW) are much inferior than those of C&W, and
vice versa. Additionally, we consider two slightly
more competitive baselines (rows +stem) based
on the morphological segmentation of unknown
words: instead of using a universal vector repre-
senting all unknown words, we use vectors rep-
resenting the stems of unknown words. These
baselines yield slightly better performance for the
SCWS∗ and RW datasets while the trends we men-
tioned earlier remain the same.

Our first model, the context-insensitive mor-
phoRNN (cimRNN), outperforms its correspond-
ing baseline significantly over the rare word

14In our later experiments, an aggregated rating is derived
for each pair. We first discard ratings not within one standard
deviation of the mean, and then estimate a new mean from
the remaining ones to use as an aggregated rating.

dataset. The performance is constant for MC and
RG (with no complex words) and modestly im-
proved for MC (with some complex words – see
Table 4). This is expected since the cimRNN
model only concerns about reconstructing the
original embedding (while learning word struc-
tures), and the new representation mostly differs
at morphologically complex words. For SCWS∗,
the performance, however, decreases when train-
ing with C&W, which perhaps is due to: (a) the
baseline performance of C&W for SCWS∗ is com-
petitive and (b) the model trades off between learn-
ing syntactics (the word structure) and capturing
semantics, which requires context information.

On the other hand, the context-sensitive mor-
phoRNN (csmRNN) consistently improves corre-
lations over the cimRNN model for all datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using surround-
ing contexts in learning both morphological syn-

tactics and semantics. It also outperforms the
corresponding baselines by a good margin for all
datasets (except for SCWS∗). This highlights the
fact that our method is reliable and potentially ap-
plicable for other embeddings.

6 Analysis

To gain a deeper understanding of how our mor-
phoRNN models have “moved” word vectors
around, we look at nearest neighbors of sev-
eral complex words given by various embed-
dings, where cosine similarity is used as a dis-
tance metric. Examples are shown in Table 6
for three representations: C&W and the context-
insensitive/sensitive morphoRNN models trained
on the C&W embedding.15

Syntactically, it is interesting to observe that
the cimRNN model could well enforce structural
agreement among related words. For example, it
returns V-ing as nearest neighbors for “comment-
ing” and similarly, JJ-ness for “fearlessness”, an
unknown word that C&W cannot handle. How-
ever, for those cases, the nearest neighbors are
badly unrelated.

On the semantic side, we notice that when
structural agreement is not enforced, the cimRNN
model tends to cluster words sharing the same
stem together, e.g., rows with words of the form

affect .16 This might be undesirable when we
want to differentiate semantics of words sharing
the same stem, e.g. “affected” and “unaffected”.

The csmRNN model seems to balance well be-
tween the two extremes (syntactic and seman-
tic) by taking into account contextual information

when learning morphological structures. It returns
neighbors of the same structure un ed for “unaf-
fected”, but does not include any negation of “af-
fected” in the top 10 results when “affected” is
queried.17 Even better, the answers for “distinct-
ness” have blended well both types of results.

7 Conclusion

This paper combines recursive neural networks
(RNNs) and neural language models (NLMs) in
a novel way to learn better word representa-
tions. Each of these components contributes to
the learned syntactic-semantic word vectors in a
unique way. The RNN explicitly models the mor-
phological structures of words, i.e., the syntactic
information, to learn morphemic compositional-
ity. This allows for better estimation of rare and
complex words and a more principled way of han-
dling unseen words, whose representations could
be constructed from vectors of known morphemes.

The NLMs, on the other hand, utilize surround-
ing word contexts to provide further semantics
to the learned morphemic representations. As
a result, our context-sensitive morphoRNN em-
beddings could significantly outperform existing
embeddings on word similarity tasks for many
datasets. Our analysis reveals that the model could
blend well both the syntactic and semantic infor-
mation in clustering related words. We have also
made available a word similarity dataset focusing
on rare words to complement existing ones which
tend to include frequent words.

Lastly, as English is still considered limited
in terms of morphology, our model could poten-
tially yield even better performance when applied
to other morphologically complex languages such
as Finnish or Turkish, which we leave for future
work. Also, even within English, we expect our
model to be value to other domains, such as bio-
NLP with complicated but logical taxonomy.
