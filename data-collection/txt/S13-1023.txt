Abstract

This paper describes the system used by the
LIPN team in the Semantic Textual Similarity
task at *SEM 2013. It uses a support vector re-
gression model, combining different text sim-
ilarity measures that constitute the features.
These measures include simple distances like
Levenshtein edit distance, cosine, Named En-
tities overlap and more complex distances like
Explicit Semantic Analysis, WordNet-based
similarity, IR-based similarity, and a similar-
ity measure based on syntactic dependencies.

1 Introduction

The Semantic Textual Similarity task (STS) at
*SEM 2013 requires systems to grade the degree of
similarity between pairs of sentences. It is closely
related to other well known tasks in NLP such as tex-
tual entailment, question answering or paraphrase
detection. However, as noticed in (Bär et al., 2012),
the major difference is that STS systems must give a
graded, as opposed to binary, answer.

One of the most successful systems in *SEM
2012 STS, (Bär et al., 2012), managed to grade pairs
of sentences accurately by combining focused mea-
sures, either simple ones based on surface features
(ie n-grams), more elaborate ones based on lexical
semantics, or measures requiring external corpora
such as Explicit Semantic Analysis, into a robust
measure by using a log-linear regression model.

The LIPN-CORE system is built upon this idea of
combining simple measures with a regression model
to obtain a robust and accurate measure of tex-
tual similarity, using the individual measures as fea-

tures for the global system. These measures include
simple distances like Levenshtein edit distance, co-
sine, Named Entities overlap and more complex dis-
tances like Explicit Semantic Analysis, WordNet-
based similarity, IR-based similarity, and a similar-
ity measure based on syntactic dependencies.

The paper is organized as follows. Measures are
presented in Section 2. Then the regression model,
based on Support Vector Machines, is described in
Section 3. Finally we discuss the results of the sys-
tem in Section 4.

2 Text Similarity Measures

2.1 WordNet-based Conceptual Similarity
(Proxigenea)

First of all, sentences p and q are analysed in or-
der to extract all the included WordNet synsets. For
each WordNet synset, we keep noun synsets and put
into the set of synsets associated to the sentence, Cp
and Cq, respectively. If the synsets are in one of the
other POS categories (verb, adjective, adverb) we
look for their derivationally related forms in order
to find a related noun synset: if there is one, we put
this synsets in Cp (or Cq). For instance, the word
“playing” can be associated in WordNet to synset
(v)play#2, which has two derivationally related
forms corresponding to synsets (n)play#5 and
(n)play#6: these are the synsets that are added
to the synset set of the sentence. No disambiguation
process is carried out, so we take all possible mean-
ings into account.

GivenCp andCq as the sets of concepts contained
in sentences p and q, respectively, with |Cp| ≥ |Cq|,

162



the conceptual similarity between p and q is calcu-
lated as:

ss(p, q) =

∑
c1∈Cp

max
c2∈Cq

s(c1, c2)

|Cp|
(1)

where s(c1, c2) is a conceptual similarity measure.
Concept similarity can be calculated by different
ways. For the participation in the 2013 Seman-
tic Textual Similarity task, we used a variation of
the Wu-Palmer formula (Wu and Palmer, 1994)
named “ProxiGenea” (from the french Proximité
Généalogique, genealogical proximity), introduced
by (Dudognon et al., 2010), which is inspired by the
analogy between a family tree and the concept hi-
erarchy in WordNet. Among the different formula-
tions proposed by (Dudognon et al., 2010), we chose
the ProxiGenea3 variant, already used in the STS
2012 task by the IRIT team (Buscaldi et al., 2012).
The ProxiGenea3 measure is defined as:

s(c1, c2) =
1

1 + d(c1) + d(c2)− 2 · d(c0)
(2)

where c0 is the most specific concept that is present
both in the synset path of c1 and c2 (that is, the Least
Common Subsumer or LCS). The function returning
the depth of a concept is noted with d.

2.2 IC-based Similarity
This measure has been proposed by (Mihalcea et
al., 2006) as a corpus-based measure which uses
Resnik’s Information Content (IC) and the Jiang-
Conrath (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) similarity metric:

sjc(c1, c2) =
1

IC(c1) + IC(c2)− 2 · IC(c0)
(3)

where IC is the information content introduced by
(Resnik, 1995) as IC(c) = − logP (c).

The similarity between two text segments T1 and
T2 is therefore determined as:

sim(T1, T2) =
1

2


∑

w∈{T1}
max

w2∈{T2}
ws(w, w2) ∗ idf(w)∑

w∈{T1}
idf(w)

+

∑
w∈{T2}

max
w1∈{T1}

ws(w, w1) ∗ idf(w)∑
w∈{T2}

idf(w)

(4)
where idf(w) is calculated as the inverse document
frequency of word w, taking into account Google

Web 1T (Brants and Franz, 2006) frequency counts.
The semantic similarity between words is calculated
as:

ws(wi, wj) = max
ci∈Wi,cjinWj

sjc(ci, cj). (5)

where Wi and Wj are the sets containing all synsets
in WordNet corresponding to word wi and wj , re-
spectively. The IC values used are those calcu-
lated by Ted Pedersen (Pedersen et al., 2004) on the
British National Corpus1.

2.3 Syntactic Dependencies

We also wanted for our systems to take syntac-
tic similarity into account. As our measures are
lexically grounded, we chose to use dependen-
cies rather than constituents. Previous experiments
showed that converting constituents to dependen-
cies still achieved best results on out-of-domain
texts (Le Roux et al., 2012), so we decided to use
a 2-step architecture to obtain syntactic dependen-
cies. First we parsed pairs of sentences with the
LORG parser2. Second we converted the resulting
parse trees to Stanford dependencies3.

Given the sets of parsed dependenciesDp andDq,
for sentence p and q, a dependency d ∈ Dx is a
triple (l, h, t) where l is the dependency label (for in-
stance, dobj or prep), h the governor and t the depen-
dant. We define the following similarity measure be-
tween two syntactic dependencies d1 = (l1, h1, t1)
and d2 = (l2, h2, t2):

dsim(d1, d2) = Lev(l1, l2)

∗ idfh ∗ sWN (h1, h2) + idft ∗ sWN (t1, t2)
2

(6)

where idfh = max(idf(h1), idf(h2)) and idft =
max(idf(t1), idf(t2)) are the inverse document fre-
quencies calculated on Google Web 1T for the gov-
ernors and the dependants (we retain the maximum
for each pair), and sWN is calculated using formula
2, with two differences:

• if the two words to be compared are antonyms,
then the returned score is 0;

2
https://github.com/CNGLdlab/LORG-Release

3We used the default built-in converter provided with the
Stanford Parser (2012-11-12 revision).

163



• if one of the words to be compared is not in
WordNet, their similarity is calculated using
the Levenshtein distance.

The similarity score between p and q, is then cal-
culated as:

sSD(p, q) = max


∑

di∈Dp
max

djinDq
dsim(di, dj)

|Dp|
,

∑
di∈Dq

max
djinDp

dsim(di, dj)

|Dq|


(7)

2.4 Information Retrieval-based Similarity
Let us consider two texts p and q, an Information Re-
trieval (IR) system S and a document collection D
indexed by S. This measure is based on the assump-
tion that p and q are similar if the documents re-
trieved by S for the two texts, used as input queries,
are ranked similarly.

Let be Lp = {dp1 , . . . , dpK} and Lq =
{dq1 , . . . , dqK}, dxi ∈ D the sets of the top K docu-
ments retrieved by S for texts p and q, respectively.
Let us define sp(d) and sq(d) the scores assigned by
S to a document d for the query p and q, respectively.
Then, the similarity score is calculated as:

simIR(p, q) = 1−

∑
d∈Lp∩Lq

√
(sp(d)−sq(d))2

max(sp(d),sq(d))

|Lp ∩ Lq|
(8)

if |Lp ∩ Lq| 6= ∅, 0 otherwise.
For the participation in this task we indexed a

collection composed by the AQUAINT-24 and the
English NTCIR-85 document collections, using the
Lucene6 4.2 search engine with BM25 similarity.
The K value was empirically set to 20 after some
tests on the STS 2012 data.

Markovitch, 2007) represents meaning as a

weighted vector of Wikipedia concepts. Weights
are supposed to quantify the strength of the relation
between a word and each Wikipedia concept using
the tf-idf measure. A text is then represented as a
high-dimensional real valued vector space spanning
all along the Wikipedia database. For this particular
task we adapt the research-esa implementation
(Sorg and Cimiano, 2008)7 to our own home-made
weighted vectors corresponding to a Wikipedia
snapshot of February 4th, 2013.

2.6 N-gram based Similarity

This feature is based on the Clustered Keywords Po-
sitional Distance (CKPD) model proposed in (Bus-
caldi et al., 2009) for the passage retrieval task.

The similarity between a text fragment p and an-
other text fragment q is calculated as:

simngrams(p, q) =

∑
∀x∈Q

h(x, P )
1

d(x, xmax)∑n
i=1wi

(9)

Where P is the set of n-grams with the highest
weight in p, where all terms are also contained in q;
Q is the set of all the possible n-grams in q and n
is the total number of terms in the longest passage.
The weights for each term and each n-gram are cal-
culated as:

• wi calculates the weight of the term tI as:

wi = 1−
log(ni)

1 + log(N)
(10)

Where ni is the frequency of term ti in the
Google Web 1T collection, and N is the fre-
quency of the most frequent term in the Google
Web 1T collection.

• the function h(x, P ) measures the weight of
each n-gram and is defined as:

h(x, Pj) =

{ ∑j
k=1wk if x ∈ Pj

0 otherwise
(11)

7
http://code.google.com/p/research-esa/

164



Where wk is the weight of the k-th term (see
Equation 10) and j is the number of terms that
compose the n-gram x;

• 1d(x,xmax) is a distance factor which reduces the
weight of the n-grams that are far from the
heaviest n-gram. The function d(x, xmax) de-
termines numerically the value of the separa-
tion according to the number of words between
a n-gram and the heaviest one:

d(x, xmax) = 1 + k· ln(1 + L) (12)

where k is a factor that determines the impor-
tance of the distance in the similarity calcula-
tion and L is the number of words between a
n-gram and the heaviest one (see Equation 11).
In our experiments, k was set to 0.1, the default
value in the original model.

2.7 Other measures

In addition to the above text similarity measures, we
used also the following common measures:

2.7.1 Cosine
Given p = (wp1 , . . . , wpn) and q =

(wq1 , . . . , wqn) the vectors of tf.idf weights asso-
ciated to sentences p and q, the cosine distance is
calculated as:

simcos(p,q) =

n∑
i=1

wpi × wqi√
n∑

i=1
wpi

2 ×
√

n∑
i=1

wqi
2

(13)

The idf value was calculated on Google Web 1T.

2.7.2 Edit Distance
This similarity measure is calculated using the

Levenshtein distance as:

simED(p, q) = 1−
Lev(p, q)

max(|p|, |q|)
(14)

where Lev(p, q) is the Levenshtein distance be-
tween the two sentences, taking into account the
characters.

2.7.3 Named Entity Overlap
We used the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer

by (Finkel et al., 2005), with the 7 class model
trained for MUC: Time, Location, Organization,
Person, Money, Percent, Date. Then we calculated a
per-class overlap measure (in this way, “France” as
an Organization does not match “France” as a Loca-
tion):

ONER(p, q) =
2 ∗ |Np ∩Nq|
|Np|+ |Nq|

(15)

where Np and Nq are the sets of NEs found, respec-
tively, in sentences p and q.

3 Integration of Similarity Measures

The integration has been carried out using the
ν-Support Vector Regression model (ν-SVR)
(Schölkopf et al., 1999) implementation provided
by LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), with a radial
basis function kernel with the standard parameters
(ν = 0.5).

4 Results

In order to evaluate the impact of the different fea-
tures, we carried out an ablation test, removing one
feature at a time and training a new model with the
reduced set of features. In Table 2 we show the re-
sults of the ablation test for each subset of the *SEM
2013 test set; in Table 1 we show the same test on the
whole test set. Note: the results have been calculated
as the Pearson correlation test on the whole test set
and not as an average of the correlation scores cal-
culated over the composing test sets.

Table 3: Pearson correlation calculated on individual features.

The ablation test show that the IR-based feature
showed up to be the most effective one, especially
for the headlines subset (as expected), and, quite sur-
prisingly, on the OnWN data. In Table 3 we show
the correlation between each feature and the result
(feature values normalised between 0 and 5): from
this table we can also observe that, on average, IR-
based similarity was better able to capture the se-
mantic similarity between texts. The only exception
was the FNWN test set: the IR-based similarity re-
turned a 0 score 178 times out of 189 (94.1%), indi-
cating that the indexed corpus did not fit the content
of the FNWN sentences. This result shows also the
limits of the IR-based similarity score which needs
a large corpus to achieve enough coverage.

4.1 Shared submission with INAOE-UPV

One of the files submitted by INAOE-UPV,
INAOE-UPV-run3 has been produced using seven
features produced by different teams: INAOE, LIPN

and UMCC-DLSI. We contributed to this joint sub-
mission with the IR-based, WordNet and cosine fea-
tures.

5 Conclusions and Further Work

In this paper we introduced the LIPN-CORE sys-
tem, which combines semantic, syntactic an lexi-
cal measures of text similarity in a linear regression
model. Our system was among the best 15 runs for
the STS task. According to the ablation test, the best
performing feature was the IR-based one, where a
sentence is considered as a query and its meaning
represented as a set of documents indexed by an IR
system. The second and third best-performing mea-
sures were WordNet similarity and Levenshtein’s
edit distance. On the other hand, worst perform-
ing similarity measures were Named Entity Over-
lap, Syntactic Dependencies and ESA. However, a
correlation analysis calculated on the features taken
one-by-one shows that the contribution of a feature

166



on the overall regression result does not correspond
to the actual capability of the measure to represent
the semantic similarity between the two texts. These
results raise the methodological question of how to
combine semantic, syntactic and lexical similarity
measures in order to estimate the impact of the dif-
ferent strategies used on each dataset.

Further work will include richer similarity mea-
sures, like quasi-synchronous grammars (Smith and
Eisner, 2006) and random walks (Ramage et al.,
2009). Quasi-synchronous grammars have been
used successfully for paraphrase detection (Das and
Smith, 2009), as they provide a fine-grained model-
ing of the alignment of syntactic structures, in a very
flexible way, enabling partial alignments and the in-
clusion of external features, like Wordnet lexical re-
lations for example. Random walks have been used
effectively for paraphrase recognition and as a fea-
ture for recognizing textual entailment. Finally, we
will continue analyzing the question of how to com-
bine a wide variety of similarity measures in such a
way that they tackle the semantic variations of each
dataset.
