Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a new distri-
butional method for modeling predicate-
argument thematic fit judgments. We use
a syntax-based DSM to build a prototyp-
ical representation of verb-specific roles:
for every verb, we extract the most salient
second order contexts for each of its roles
(i.e. the most salient dimensions of typi-
cal role fillers), and then we compute the-
matic fit as a weighted overlap between
the top features of candidate fillers and
role prototypes. Our experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms
a baseline re-implementing a state-of-the-
art system, and achieves better or compa-
rable results to those reported in the liter-
ature for the other unsupervised systems.
Moreover, it provides an explicit represen-
tation of the features characterizing verb-
specific semantic roles.

1 Introduction

Several psycholinguistic studies in the last two
decades have brought extensive evidence that hu-
mans activate a rich array of event knowledge dur-
ing sentence processing: verbs (e.g. arrest) ac-
tivate expectations about their typical arguments
(e.g. cop, thief ) (McRae et al., 1998; Altmann and
Kamide, 1999; Ferretti et al., 2001; McRae et al.,
2005; Hare et al., 2009; Matsuki et al., 2011), and
nouns activate other nouns typically co-occurring
in the same events (Kamide et al., 2003; Bick-
nell et al., 2010). Subjects are able to determine
the plausibility of a noun for a given argument
role and quickly use this knowledge to anticipate
upcoming linguistic input (McRae and Matsuki,
2009). This phenomenon is referred to in the lit-
erature as thematic fit. Thematic fit estimation

has been extensively used in sentence comprehen-
sion studies on constraint-based models, mainly as
a predictor variable allowing to disambiguate be-
tween possible structural analyses.1 More in gen-
eral, thematic fit is considered as a key factor in a
variety of studies concerned with structural ambi-
guity (Vandekerckhove et al., 2009).

Starting from the work of Erk et al. (2010),
several distributional semantic methods have been
proposed to compute the extent to which nouns
fulfill the requirements of verb-specific thematic
roles, and their performances have been evaluated
against human-generated judgments (Baroni and
Lenci, 2010; Lenci, 2011; Sayeed and Demberg,
2014; Sayeed et al., 2015, 2016; Greenberg et al.,
2015a,b). Most research on thematic fit estima-
tion has focused on count-based vector representa-
tions (as distinguished from prediction-based vec-
tors).2 Indeed, in their comparison between high-
dimensional explicit vectors and low-dimensional
neural embeddings, Baroni et al. (2014) found that
thematic fit estimation is the only benchmark on
which prediction models are lagging behind state-
of-the-art performance. This is consistent with
Sayeed et al. (2016)’s observation that “thematic
fit modeling is particularly sensitive to linguistic
detail and interpretability of the vector space”.

The present work sets itself among the un-
supervised approaches to thematic fit estima-
tion. By relying on explicit and interpretable
count-based vector representations, we propose
a simple, cognitively-inspired, and efficient the-
matic fit model using information extracted from
dependency-parsed corpora. The key features of
our proposal are a) prototypical representations
of verb-specific thematic roles, based on feature
weighting and filtering of second order contexts

Donald and Seidenberg (2006).

(i.e. contexts that are salient for many of the typ-
ical fillers of a given verb-specific thematic role),
and b) a similarity measure which computes the
Weighted Overlap (WO) between prototypes and
candidate fillers.3

2 Related Work

Erk et al. (2010) were, at the best of our knowl-
edge, the first authors to measure the correlation
between human-elicited thematic fit ratings and
the scores assigned by a syntax-based Distribu-
tional Semantic Model (DSM). More specifically,
their gold standard consisted of the human judg-
ments collected by McRae et al. (1998) and Padó
(2007). The plausibility of each verb-filler pair
was computed as the similarity between new can-
didate nouns and previously attested exemplars for
each specific verb-role pairing (as already pro-
posed in Erk (2007)).

Baroni and Lenci (2010) evaluated their Dis-
tributional Memory (henceforth DM)4 framework
on the same datasets, adopting an approach to the
task that has become dominant in the literature:
for each verb role, they built a prototype vector
by averaging the dependency-based vectors of its
most typical fillers. The higher the similarity of
a noun with a role prototype, the higher its plau-
sibility as a filler for that role. Lenci (2011) has
later extended the model to account for the dy-
namic update of the expectations on an argument,
depending on how another role is filled. By using
the same DM tensor, this study tested an additive
and a multiplicative model (Mitchell and Lapata,
2010) to compose and update the expectations on
the patient filler of the subject-verb-object triples
of the Bicknell dataset (Bicknell et al., 2010).

The thematic fit models proposed by Sayeed
and Demberg (2014) and Sayeed et al. (2015) are
similar to Baroni and Lenci’s, but their DSMs
were built by using the roles assigned by the
SENNA semantic role labeler (Collobert et al.,
2011) to define the feature space. These authors
argued that the prototype-based method with de-
pendencies works well when applied to the agent
and to the patient role (which are almost always
syntactically realized as subjects and objects), but

4In this paper, we will make reference to two different

models of DM: DepDM and TypeDM. DepDM counts the
frequency of dependency links between words (e.g. read, obj,
book), while TypeDM uses the variety of surface forms that
express the link between words, rather than the link itself.

that it might be problematic to apply it to dif-
ferent roles, such as instruments and locations,
as the construction of the prototype would have
to rely on prepositional complements as typical
fillers, and the meaning of prepositions can be am-
biguous. Comparing their results with Baroni and
Lenci (2010), the authors showed that their system
outperforms the syntax-based model DepDM and
almost matches the scores of the best performing
TypeDM, which uses hand-crafted rules. More-
over, they were the first to evaluate thematic role
plausibility for roles other than agent and patient,
as they computed the scores also for the instru-
ments and for the locations of the Ferretti datasets
(Ferretti et al., 2001).

Greenberg et al. (2015a,b) further developed the
TypeDM and the role-based models, investigat-
ing the effects of verb polysemy on human the-
matic fit judgments and introducing a hierarchical
agglomerative clustering algorithm into the proto-
type creation process. Their goal was to cluster to-
gether typical fillers into multiple prototypes, cor-
responding to different verb senses, and their re-
sults showed constant improvements of the perfor-
mance of the DM-based model.

Finally, Tilk et al. (2016) presented two neural
network architectures for generating probability
distributions over selectional preferences for each
thematic role. Their models took advantage of su-
pervised training on two role-labeled corpora to
optimize the distributional representation for the-
matic fit modeling, and managed to obtain signif-
icant improvements over the other systems on al-
most all the evaluation datasets. They also eval-
uated their model on the task of composing and
updating verb argument expectations, obtaining a
performance comparable to Lenci (2011).

3 Methodology

As pointed out by Sayeed et al. (2016), most works
on unsupervised thematic fit estimation vary in the
method adopted for constructing the prototypes.
The semantic role prototype is usually a vector,
obtained by averaging the most typical fillers, and
plausibility of new fillers depends on their similar-
ity to the prototype, assessed by means of vector
cosine (the standard similarity measure for DSMs;
see Turney and Pantel (2010)).

Its merits notwithstanding, we argue that this
method is not optimal for characterizing roles.
Distributional vectors are typically built as out-of-

649



context representations, and they conflate different
senses. By building the prototype as the centroid
of a cluster of vectors and measuring then the the-
matic fit with vector cosine, the plausibility score
is inevitably affected by many contexts that are ir-
relevant for the specific verb-argument combina-
tion.5 This is likely to be one of the main reasons
behind the difficulties of modeling roles other than
agent and patient with syntax-based DSMs. We
claim that improving the prototype representation
might lead to a better characterization of thematic
roles, and to a better treatment of polysemy.

When a verb and an argument are composed,
humans are intuitively able to select only the part
of the potential meaning of the words that is rele-
vant for the concept being expressed (e.g. in The
player hit the ball, humans would certainly ex-
clude from the meaning of ball semantic dimen-
sions that are strictly related to its dancing sense).
In other words, not all the features of the seman-
tic representations are active, and the composition
process makes some features more ‘prominent’,
while moving others to the background.6

Although we are not aware of experimen-
tal works specifically dedicated to verb-argument
composition, a similar idea has been supported
in studies on conceptual combinations (Hampton,
1997, 2007): when a head and a modifier are com-
bined, their interaction affects the saliency of the
features in the original concepts. For example,
in racing car, the most salient properties would
be those related to SPEED, whereas in family
car SPACE properties would probably be more
prominent. Yeh and Barsalou (2006) used a prop-
erty priming experiment to show how the concept
features activated during language comprehension
vary across the background situations described by
the sentence they occur in. When concepts are
combined in a sentence, the features that are rele-
vant for the specific combination are activated and
are then easier to verify for human subjects.

The same could be true for linguistically-
derived properties of lexical meaning: Simmons
et al. (2008) brought neuroimaging evidence of the
early activation of word association areas during
property generation tasks, and Santos et al. (2011)

5For an overview on the limitations of vector cosine, see:
Li and Han (2013); Dinu et al. (2015); Schnabel et al. (2015);
Faruqui et al. (2016); Santus et al. (2016a).

6An early proposal going in this direction is the predica-
tion theory by Kintsch (2001), which exploited Latent Se-
mantic Analysis to select only the vector features that are ap-
propriate for predicate-argument composition.

showed that word associates are often among the
properties generated for a given concept. Such
findings suggest that, while we combine concepts,
both embodied simulations and word distributions
influence property salience (Barsalou et al., 2008).

Our model makes the following assumptions:

• the composition between a verb role repre-
sentation and an argument shares the same
cognitive mechanism underlying conceptual
combinations;

• at least part of semantic representations is
derived from, and/or mirrored in, linguistic
data.7 Consistently, the process of selecting
the relevant features of the concepts being
composed corresponds to modify the salience
of the dimensions of distributional vectors;

• thematic fit computation is carried out on the
basis of the activation and selection of salient
features of a verb thematic role prototype and
of the candidate argument filler vectors.

We rely on syntax-based DSMs, using depen-
dency relations to approximate verb-specific roles
and to identify their most typical fillers: for
agents/patients, we extract the most frequent sub-
jects/objects, for instruments we use the preposi-
tional complements introduced by with, and for
locations those introduced by either on, at or in.

Assuming that the linguistic features of distribu-
tional vectors correspond to the properties of con-
ceptual composition processes, a candidate filler
can be represented as a sorted distributional vec-
tor of the filler term, in which the most salient
contexts occupy the top positions. Similarly, the
abstract representation of a verb-specific role is
a sorted prototype-vector, whose features derive
from the sum of the most typical filler vectors for
that verb-specific role.

Differently from Baroni and Lenci, the core and
novel aspect of our proposal, described in the fol-
lowing subsections, is that we do not simply mea-
sure the correlation between all the features of
candidate and prototype vectors (as vector cosine
would do on unsorted vectors), but rather we rank
and filter the features, computing the weighted
overlap with a rank-based similarity measure in-
spired by APSyn, a recent proposal by Santus

tional Hypothesis (Miller and Charles, 1991; Lenci, 2008).

et al. (2016a,b,c) which has shown interesting re-
sults in synonymy detection and similarity estima-
tion. As we will show in the next sections, the new
metric assigns high scores to candidate fillers shar-
ing many salient contexts with the verb-specific
role prototype.

3.1 Typical Fillers

The first step of our method consists in identifying
the typical fillers of a verb-specific role. Following
Baroni and Lenci (2010), we weighted the raw co-
occurrences between verbs, syntactic relations and
fillers in the TypeDM tensor of DM with Positive
Local Mutual Information (PLMI; Evert (2004)).

Given the co-occurrence count Ovrf of the verb
v, a syntactic relation r and the filler f , we com-
puted the expected count Evrf under the assump-
tion of statistical independence:

PLMI(v, r, f) = log

(
Ov,r,f
Ev,r,f

)
∗Ov,r,f (1)

From the ranked list of (v,r,f) tuples, for each slot,
we selected as typical fillers the top k lexemes with
the highest PLMI scores (see examples in Table 1,
Typical Fillers column). In our experiments, we
report results for k = {10, 30, 50}.
3.2 Role Prototype Vectors

To represent the typical fillers, the candidate fillers
and the verb-specific role prototypes (which are
obtained by summing their typical filler vectors),
we built a syntax-based DSM. This includes rela-
tion:word contexts, like sbj:dog, obj:apple, etc..

Contexts were weighted with Positive Pointwise
Mutual Information (PPMI; Church and Hanks
(1990), Bullinaria and Levy (2012), Levy et al.
(2015)). Given a context c and a word w, the PPMI
is defined as follows:

PPMI(w, c) = max(PMI(w, c), 0) (2)

PMI(w, c) = log

(
P (w, c)

P (w)P (c)

)
= log

(
|w, c|D
|w||c|

)
(3)

where w is the target word, c is the given context,
P(w,c) is the probability of co-occurrence, and D
is the collection of observed word-context pairs.8

8A variant of this DSM weighted with PLMI (which is
simply the PPMI multiplied by the word-context frequency)
was also built, but because of its lower and inconsistent per-

The context c of the prototype vector P repre-
senting a thematic role has a value corresponding
to the sum of the values of c for each of the k typ-
ical fillers used to build P . The contexts of P
are then sorted according to their weight. Desir-
ably, the highest-ranking contexts for a role pro-
totype will be those that are more strongly associ-
ated with many of its typical fillers. Such second
order contexts correspond to the most salient fea-
tures of the verb-specific thematic role, as they are
salient for many role fillers (some examples are
reported in Table 1, Top Second Order Contexts
column).

In summary, we built centroid vectors for our
verb-specific thematic roles by means of second
order contexts, which are first order dependency-
based contexts of the most typical fillers of a verb-
specific role. Since we are interested only in the
most salient contexts, we ranked the centroid con-
texts according to their PPMI score, and we took
the resulting rank as a distributional characteriza-
tion of the thematic roles.

3.3 Filtering the Contexts

Filtering the prototype dimensions according to
syntactic criteria might be useful to improve our
role representations. It is, indeed, reasonable to
hypothesize that predicates co-occurring with the
typical patients of a verb are more relevant for the
characterization of its patient role than – let’s say –
prepositional complements, as they correspond to
other actions that are typically performed on the
same patients.

Imagine that apple, pizza, cake etc. are among
the most salient fillers for the OBJ slot of to eat,
and that OBJ-1:slice-v, OBJ-1:devour-v, SBJ:kid-
n, INSTRUMENT:fork-n, LOCATION:table-n are
some of the most salient contexts of the proto-
type.9 Things that are typically sliced and/or de-
voured are more likely to be good fillers for the pa-
tient role to eat than things that are simply located
on a table or that are patients of actions performed
by kids. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the
performance of the system in three different set-
tings, each of which selecting:

formance we will not discuss it further. Santus et al. (2016c)
previously showed that their rank-based measure performs
worse on PLMI-weighted vectors, as they are biased towards
frequent contexts.

9Our DSM also makes use of inverse syntactic dependen-
cies: target SYN-1 context means that target is linked to con-
text by the dependency relation SYN (e.g. meal OBJ-1 devour
means that meal is OBJ of devour).

ting);

3.4 Computing the Thematic Fit
Our hypothesis is that fillers whose salience-
ranked vector has a large overlap with the proto-
type representation should have a high thematic fit.
Such overlap should take into account not only the
number of shared features, but also their respective
ranks in the salience-ranked vectors.

When the prototype has been computed and the
candidate filler vector has also been sorted, we
can measure the Weighted Overlap by adapting
APSyn (Santus et al., 2016a,b,c) to our needs:

WO(wx, wy) =
∑

∀f�(x[1:N]∩y[1:N])

1

avg(rx(f), ry(f))
(4)

where for every feature f in the intersection be-
tween the top N features of the sorted vectors x,
x[1:N ], and y, y[1:N ], we sum 1 divided by the av-
erage rank of the shared feature in x and y, rx(f)
and ry(f) (N is a tunable parameter).

This measure assigns the maximum score to
vectors sharing exactly the same dimensions, in
the same salience ranking. The lower the rank of a
shared context in the sorted vector, the smaller its
contribution to the thematic fit score. If the feature
set intersection is empty, the score will be 0.

Differently from cosine similarity, which con-
flates multiple senses, measuring the Weighted
Overlap between prototype and candidate filler
can improve the estimation of the thematic fit
by favoring the appropriate word senses: for ex-
ample, for a verb-argument pair like embrace-
v–communism-n, communism-n is likely to inter-
sect and to increase the saliency (through the av-
erage rank) only of the second-order features of
embrace-v referring to its abstract sense.

Datasets. We tested our method on three pop-
ular datasets for thematic fit estimation, namely
McRae et al. (1998), Ferretti et al. (2001) and Padó
(2007). All the datasets contain human plausibility
judgments for verb-role-filler triples. McRae and
Padó include scores for agent and patient roles,
whereas Ferretti includes instruments and loca-
tions (see Table 2 for the coverage of each system
for the datasets).
Metrics. Performance is evaluated as the Spear-
man correlation between the scores of the systems
and the human plausibility judgments.
Fillers. In order to make our results more compa-
rable with previous studies, the typical fillers for
each verb role were extracted from the TypeDM
tensor of the Distributional Memory framework
(see Section 3.1).10 Those were the same fillers
used by Baroni and Lenci (2010) and Greenberg
et al. (2015b).
DSM. Distributional information is derived from
the concatenation of two corpora: the British Na-
tional Corpus (Leech, 1992) and Ukwac (Baroni
et al., 2009). Both were parsed with the Malt-
parser (Nivre and Hall, 2005). From this con-
catenation, we built a dependency-based DSMs,
weighted with PPMI, containing 20,145 targets
(i.e. nouns and verbs with frequency above 1000)
and 94,860 contexts. The syntactic relations taken
into account were: sbj, sbj-1, obj, obj-1, at-1, in-1,
on-1, with-1.
Settings. To prove our hypotheses and verify the
consistency of the system, we tested a large range
of settings, varying:

Baseline and State of the Art. As a baseline, we
use the thematic fit model by Baroni and Lenci
(2010), with no ranking of the features of the
prototypes and with vector cosine as a similarity
metric.11 Results are reported for 10, 30 and 50
fillers. For reference, we also report the results
of state-of-the-art models, both the unsupervised
(Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Sayeed and Demberg,
2014; Greenberg et al., 2015b) and the supervised
ones (Tilk et al., 2016).

dard dependency-based DSM and not on TypeDM, which

patterns: see Section 2.

system varying the types of dependency contexts
(i.e. ALL, SO, PREP) and the number of fillers
considered for the prototype (i.e. 10, 30 and 50).
The other rows respectively show i) the scores ob-
tained by calculating the vector cosine between the
role prototype vector (i.e. the vector obtained by
summing the most typical fillers, with no salience
ranking of the dimensions) and the candidate filler
vector and ii) the scores reported in the literature
for the best unsupervised and supervised models.

At a glance, our best scores always outperform
the reimplementation of Baroni and Lenci, being
mostly competitive with the state of the art models.
More precisely, for agents and patients the per-
formance is close to the reported scores for DM,
when only predicates are used in the WO calcu-
lation, as hypothesized in Section 3.3. The neural
network of Tilk and colleagues retains a signifi-
cant advantage on our models only for the McRae
dataset. Our system, however, shows a remark-
able improvements on the Ferretti’s datasets, and
specifically on Ferretti-Instruments, when only
complements are used (see Section 3.3), outper-
forming even the supervised and more complex
model by Tilk et al. (2016), which has access to
semantic roles information. Compared to the other
unsupervised models, our system has a statisti-
cally significant advantage over Baroni and Lenci
(2010) on the locations dataset and over Sayeed
and Demberg (2014) on the locations and on the
instruments dataset (p < 0.05).12

instruments is the best reported until now in the
literature. This is particularly interesting because
– as pointed out by Sayeed and Demberg (2014) –
instruments and locations are difficult to model for
a dependency-based system, given the ambiguity
of prepositional phrases (e.g. with does not only
encode instruments, but it can also encode other
roles, such as in I ate a pizza with Mark). We think
this is the main reason behind the different trend
observed for the Instruments datasets with respect
to the number of the fillers (see Table 3 and Fig-
ure 1). Unlike all the other datasets, instrument
prototypes built with more fillers tend to be more
noisy and therefore to pull down both the vector
cosine and WO performance (this is partially true
also for locations, where the performances – for
cosine and WO with a lower number of contexts
– drop with more than 30 fillers: see Figure 1).
Systems based on semantic role labeling have an
advantage in this sense, as they do not have to deal
with prepositional ambiguity.

Our results show that, by weighting and
filtering the features of the role prototype,
dependency-based approaches can be successful
in modeling roles other than agent and patient,
eventually dealing also with the ambiguity of
prepositional phrases.

Settings. Apart from the above-mentioned ex-
ceptions, the best scores are obtained building
the prototypes with a higher number of fillers,
typically with 50, and calculating the WO only
with a syntactically-filtered set of contexts. More
specifically, Padó and McRae benefit from the
calculation of WO using only second order
subject-object predicates (i.e. SO), while Ferretti-
Instruments and Ferretti-Locations benefit from
the exclusive use of prepositional complements
(i.e. PREP). On the other hand, the opposite set-
ting (e.g. SO for Ferretti-Instruments and Ferretti-
Locations and PREP for Padó and McRae) leads
to much lower scores, whereas the full vectors (i.e.

ALL) tend to have a stable-but-not-excellent per-
formances on all datasets.

As briefly mentioned above, in our experiments,
we tested both PPMI and PLMI as weighting mea-
sures. Table 3 only reports PPMI scores because
it performs more regularly than PLMI, whose be-
haviour is often unpredictable.

A parameter that has an impact on the perfor-
mance of our system is the value of N , which
is the number of second order contexts that are
considered when calculating the WO. We have
noticed that the performance of WO is directly
related to the growth of N , and this can be noticed
in Figure 1, where WO is plotted for the different
values of N with every combination of dataset
and number of fillers. For space reasons, the plot
only contains the performance for the best type
of second order contexts for each dataset (i.e.
SO for Padó and McRae and COMP for Ferretti-
Locations and Ferretti-Instruments). As it can be
seen in Figure 1, the scores of WO tend to grow
with the growth of N in all datasets. Interestingly,
they are largely above the competitive baseline
in most of the cases, the only exceptions being
Padó (where a large N is necessary to outperform
the baseline) and Ferretti-Locations with 10 fillers
(prepositional ambiguity might have caused the
introduction of noisy fillers among the top ones).

Agent & Patient. In order to further evaluate our
system, we have split Padó and McRae datasets
into agent and patient subsets. Figure 2 describes
the performance of WO and vector cosine base-
line while varying N and the number of fillers.
The plot shows a clearly better performance of
WO for the agent role (i.e. subject), especially
when N is equal or over 1000 (note that the value
of N has little impact in the agent subset of the
McRae dataset). Such advantage, however, is re-
duced for the patient role (i.e. object). This is
particularly interesting because we do not observe
large drops in performance for the vector cosine

655



between agent and patient role (except for Padó,
k = 10). The drop is particularly noticeable in
Padó, a dataset which has several non-constraining
verbs (especially for the patient role: a similar ob-
servation was also made by Tilk et al. (2016)). As
the constraints on the typical fillers of such verbs
are very loose, we hypothesize that it is more diffi-
cult to find a set of salient features that are shared
by many typical fillers. Therefore, estimations
based on the whole vectors turn out to be more
reliable. This can be confirmed by looking at the
worst correlated words reported in Lexemes col-
umn, in Table 4.

5.1 Error Analysis
We performed an error analysis to verify – for the
best settings of WO in each dataset – the corre-
lation between vector cosine and WO scores (see
Table 5), and the peculiarities of the entries with
the strongest and the weakest correlation (see Ta-
ble 4).

We found that WO and vector cosine always
have a high correlation (i.e. above 0.80), with
the highest correlations reported for McRae and
Ferretti-Instruments. Looking at Table 4 we can
also observe that:

• the average gold value of the 35 most (4.65)
and least (4.56) correlated items does not
substantially differ from the average gold
value calculated on the full datasets (4.31),
meaning that the distribution of likely and un-
likely fillers among the best and worst corre-
lated items is similar to the one in the datasets
(i.e. no bias can be identified);

• both measures have difficulties on the same
test items (probably because of loose seman-
tic constraints), but report their best perfor-
mances on different pairs (see Overlap and
Lexemes columns);

• syntactically, vector cosine correlates better
with objects, while WO is more balanced be-
tween objects and subjects, often showing a
preference for the latter (see the distribution
in Syntax column).

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have introduced an unsupervised
distributional method for modeling predicate-
argument thematic fit judgments which works
purely on syntactic information.

Dataset Correlation
McRae 0.88
Padó 0.81

Ferretti - Instruments 0.90
Ferretti - Locations 0.83

Table 5: Correlation between WO and vector co-
sine in WO best settings for all datasets

The method, inspired by cognitive and psy-
cholinguistic findings, consists in: i) extracting
and filtering the most salient second order contexts
for each verb-specific role, i.e. the most salient
semantic dimensions of typical verb-specific role
fillers; and then ii) estimating the thematic fit as
a weighted overlap between the top features of
the candidate fillers and of the prototypes. Once
tested on some popular datasets of thematic fit
judgments, our method consistently outperforms a
baseline re-implementing the thematic fit model of
Baroni and Lenci (2010) and proves to be competi-
tive with state of the art models. It even registered
the best performance on the Ferretti-Instruments
dataset and it is the second best on the Ferretti-
Locations, which were known to be particularly
hard to model for dependency-based approaches.

Our method is simple, economic and efficient, it
works purely on syntactic dependencies (so it does
not require a role-labeled corpus) and achieves
good results even with no supervised training.
Finally, it offers linguistically and cognitively
grounded insights on the process of prototype cre-
ation and contextual feature salience, preparing
the ground for further speculations and optimiza-
tions. For example, future work might aim at iden-
tifying strategies for tuning the parameter N to
account for the different degrees of selectivity of
each verb-specific role. Another possible exten-
sion would be the inclusion of a mechanism for
updating the role prototypes depending on how the
other roles are filled, which would be the key for
a more realistic and dynamic model of thematic fit
expectations (Lenci, 2011).
