Abstract 

Convergence is thought to be an important 
phenomenon in dialogue through which interlocutors 
adapt to each other. Yet, its mechanisms and 
relationship to dialogue outcomes are not fully 
understood. This paper explores convergence in 
textual task-oriented dialogue during a longitudinal 
study. The results suggest that over time, 
convergence between interlocutors increases with 
successive dialogues. Additionally, for the tutorial 
dialogue domain at hand, convergence metrics were 
found to be significant predictors of dialogue 
outcomes such as learning, mental effort, and 
emotional states including frustration, boredom, and 
confusion. The results suggest ways in which 
dialogue systems may leverage convergence to 
enhance their interactions with users.  

1 Introduction 
Convergence is a widely observed phenomenon in 
dialogue, in which interlocutors adapt to the 
patterns in each other’s utterances (Brennan 1996; 
Pickering and Garrod 2004). These patterns can 
include lexical choice (Hirschberg 2008; Ward and 
Litman 2007), syntactic choice (Reitter et al. 2006; 
Stoyanchev and Stent 2009) and loudness 
(Coulston et al. 2002). It is believed that 
convergence is indicative of shared understanding 
(Pickering and Garrod 2004), which makes it an 
important consideration for task-oriented dialogue 
systems. 
    In addition to facilitating shared understanding, 
convergence has also been associated with the 
success of dialogues in several domains 
(Steinhauser et al. 2011; Ward and Litman 2007), 

and can also be leveraged for lexical and syntactic 
priming that may improve performance of spoken 
dialogue systems via more accurate speech 
recognition (Stoyanchev and Stent 2009). While 
such results have established that convergence is 
an important dialogue phenomenon, the field does 
not yet fully understand how convergence is 
associated with dialogue success.  

This paper examines surface-level and lexical 
convergence within textual task-oriented 
dialogues. The analysis considers three levels of 
convergence: utterance-level short-term priming 
effects, conversation-level convergence effects, 
and longitudinal convergence effects, as 
interlocutors participate in six conversations 
together over the course of several weeks. Using 
these measures, we build multiple regression 
models that indicate ways in which convergence 
can predict both desirable and undesirable 
outcomes of task-oriented dialogues.  
    This paper makes several contributions. First, by 
examining convergence at several granularity 
levels and across multiple dialogues with the same 
partners, we gain insight into how convergence 
phenomena unfold over time. Second, the findings 
provide confirmatory evidence that in some 
domains, such as the tutorial dialogue considered 
here, lexical priming be associated with unintended 
consequences. Finally, we demonstrate that 
dialogue convergence is also associated with 
affective components such as frustration, 
engagement, and confusion. These results 
contribute to an understanding of convergence that 
may enable us to harness this phenomenon more 
effectively within dialogue systems.

2 Related Work 
Convergence and the related concepts of alignment 
and priming have been extensively studied. 
Alignment, or the development of shared 
understanding, has been studied by Pickering and 
Garrod (2004) who propose that alignment on 
lower-level observable features is indicative of 
alignment at the level of conceptual models. The 
influence of shared representation in dialogue has 
also been explored in the context of learning; for 
example, Ward and Litman (2007) studied lexical 
convergence in human-human tutoring and found 
that the rate of priming, which measures student 
re-use of tutor words at various distances, was 
positively associated with learning for students 
with low initial test scores. Conversely, 
Steinhauser et al. (2011) analyzed lexical 
convergence in an automated dialogue-based 
physics tutor, and found that the level of the 
student mimicking the tutor was negatively 
correlated with learning. Thus, the relationship 
between dialogue convergence and learning is not 
fully understood, and may be highly dependent on 
context. 

  In addition to a theoretical link to shared 
representations, convergence has practical 
implications, in particular for speech recognition 
(Stoyanchev and Stent 2009). Brennan (1996) 
found that users adapt their lexical choices to 
match those of an automated system in both text-
based and speech-based interactions, even when it 
is apparent that the system understood the user’s 
original lexical choice. Convergence has even been 
found to occur in non-lexical aspects of a dialogue, 
such as users adapting their loudness levels to 
match that of a software agent (Coulston et al. 
2002). Together, these results suggest that 
convergence has implications beyond lexical and 
syntactic choice. 

3 Corpus  
The corpus consists of text-based tutorial dialogues 
between two interlocutors, a tutor and a student, 
working together to complete tasks in the domain 
of introductory computer science (excerpt in 
Appendix A). The corpus was collected over two 
semesters, in which 67 first-year university 
students were selected from an introductory 
engineering course and assigned to one of seven 

tutors of varying levels of tutoring experience. 
Each student engaged in six task-based dialogues 
with a single tutor over four weeks with the goal of 
producing a working software artifact during each 
session. Each session included several subtasks, 
and time was strictly limited to forty minutes 
duration. The remote collaboration interface, 
shown in Figure 1, facilitated a real-time 
synchronized view of the workspace and dialogue. 
This paper considers dialogue utterances only, 
leaving to future work the analysis of task-related 
artifacts.

The effectiveness of the dialogue was measured in 
several ways. First, student learning was measured 
as difference in score on pre-test and post-tests. 
Student engagement, or level of involvement 
during the dialogue, was measured with a brief 
survey after each dialogue (O’Brien and Toms 
2010), as were student’s satisfaction with the 
exchange, and a rating of how mentally 
challenging the task was perceived to be (Hart and 
Staveland 1988). Finally, the tutors were asked to 
rate their satisfaction with the effectiveness of each 
session and to report on their perceptions of the 
affective states of both interlocutors during the 
session. The students were not asked about their 
own affective states, as this may have introduced 
bias in subsequent dialogues.  

4 Analysis 
The goal of the analysis is to identify the 
characteristics of the dialogues that are predictive 
of the outcomes of interest, including learning, 
engagement, affect, and overall success of the 

95



 

 

dialogue as rated by the interlocutors. Summary 
statistics for the dialogues were computed, 
including time duration of the session, number of 
utterances, number of words, number of characters, 
mean word length, and lexicon size (Table 1). Stop 
words were not excluded from the analysis, in part 
due to specialized usage of common vocabulary in 
the computer science domain (e.g., for, if ). 

Although not traditionally considered a form of 
convergence, we were interested in the relationship 
between the levels of activity of the two 
interlocutors.  To this end, we analyzed the number 
of utterances, words, and characters used by tutor 
and student, and found a significant positive 
correlation on these metrics (p<0.0001 for each). 

The first convergence phenomenon considered 
centers on lexical priming, the tendency for one 
interlocutor to re-use words previously introduced 
by the other. We have utilized a priming metric 
computed as follows: Interlocutor A’s Priming 
Ratio (PR) is the percent of Interlocutor A’s words 
reused by Interlocutor B at a given distance d, 
where distance is measured in terms of number of 
Interlocutor B’s utterances. Negative slope of PR 
over distance indicates a priming effect because an 
interlocutor was more likely to reuse a word 
shortly after its use by the other interlocutor. This 
metric has been used to investigate tutor priming 
(Steinhauser et al. 2011; Ward and Litman 2007), 
and we generalize it to measure priming for both 
interlocutors. Note that student PR, which reflects 
the extent to which the tutor adopted the student’s 
lexical choice, is of particular interest from the 
perspective of dialogue system design, in which 
tutor utterances are system-generated.

Table 1. Statistics for each metric 
 

In addition to the Priming Ratio, we also computed 
a metric to reflect convergence: Interlocutor A’s 

Matched Word Ratio (MWR) is the percent of 
Interlocutor A’s words that had been previously 
used by Interlocutor B at any point in the dialogue 
history. Because it is backward-looking, this metric 
is applicable not only in a corpus study, but could 
also be used within a runtime system to track 
convergence as the dialogue unfolds. 

5 Models and Results  
Mean Matched Word Ratio for both interlocutors 
increased as sessions progressed, reflecting that the 
two dialogue partners used more of each other’s 
words as they spent more time together. The 
Priming Ratio also revealed several phenomena in 
the corpus. Similarly to prior observations from 
tutorial dialogue (Ward and Litman 2007), we 
found that student reuse of tutor primes decreased 
with distance, indicating that a lexical priming 
effect occurred (Figure 2). This trend also occurred 
for tutor reuse of student primes (Figure 3).  The 
effect was more pronounced in the tutor’s PR than 
the student’s PR; that is, there was more evidence 
that tutors converged to students in the short term. 
This finding may be associated in part with the 
higher number of tutor utterances: a distance in 
terms of number of tutor utterances represents 
fewer combined student and tutor utterances than 
the same distance in terms of student utterances. 
Additionally, tutor convergence may reflect a 
dimension of intentional pedagogical choice.  

The Priming Ratio is designed to reflect short-
term priming. However, there is evidence of a 
longer-term effect as the two interlocutors engaged 
in dialogue across multiple sessions. Figures 2 and 
3 display Tutor’s PR and Student’s PR, 
respectively, by task set, of which there were six in 
the corpus study. The last task set displays an 
overall higher level of lexical convergence than the 
earlier sessions, and there is a general trend of 
increasing convergence as the number of sessions 
together increases. 

In order to identify the features that were most 
predictive of dialogue outcomes, all of the 
convergence metrics and surface summary features 
were provided as input to a stepwise linear 
regression model. Standard greedy variable 
addition and removal was performed, with 
additional post-processing and re-training to 
eliminate instances of multicollinearity. The 
learned models (Appendix B) include a mixture of 

96



 

 

convergence metrics and surface features, as well 
as structural features such as the task set number 
and the time duration of the dialogue. At least one 
convergence metric was found to be associated 
with each outcome in the generated models, with 
the exception of Engagement.

(TS = Task Set) 
 

Several significant relationships emerged within 
the models. We discuss a subset of these here. 
First, tutor Priming Ratio was a significant 
predictor for outcomes as rated by both tutor and 
student. Higher tutor Priming Ratio was associated 
with higher tutor perception of dialogue success, 
perhaps because students reflected tutor lexical 
choice more frequently. The same metric was 
associated with lower student score for how 
mentally demanding the tasks were perceived to 
be, which suggests that a shared lexicon may be 
associated with decreased cognitive load.   
     Another significant finding is the relationship 
between student Priming Ratio and student 
boredom, confusion, and frustration. In all the 
models, increased reports of these student 

emotions by the tutor corresponded to lower 
student Priming Ratio.  This result suggests that 
tutor reuse of student lexical choice may be 
associated with positive affective outcomes.  
     Finally, the tutor’s Matched Word Ratio is a 
significant negative predictor of learning gains, 
and also a significant negative predictor for student 
confusion. This finding may be related to the fact 
that by reusing more student language, the tutor 
may be effectively introducing fewer novel 
contributions that might lead to confusion.  

6 Conclusion and Future Work 
Understanding how convergence unfolds holds 
significant promise for designing more effective 
dialogue systems. Toward that end, this paper has 
explored convergence in task-oriented dialogue at 
three levels: at the level of pairs of utterances, 
across a single conversation, and over multiple 
conversations with the same interlocutors. The 
results demonstrate that within the corpus, the two 
interlocutors display increasing levels of 
convergence longitudinally. Additionally, the 
results suggest ways in which short-term and long-
term convergence are associated with particular 
positive and negative aspects of dialogue success 
and user affect.  
     The findings have significant implications for 
dialogue systems. First, they suggest that not only 
may successful lexical priming aid in 
understanding (Stoyanchev and Stent 2009), it may 
also be associated with lower cognitive load for 
users. Additionally, it may be possible to leverage 
convergence to positively impact users’ affective 
states with respect to emotions such as boredom, 
confusion, and frustration. These potential 
relationships suggest that work to further elucidate 
convergence phenomena is particularly promising 
because dialogue systems stand to benefit from 
strategically leveraging convergence and 
adaptation.
