Abstract

This paper describes our system for participat-
ing SemEval2013 Task2-B (Kozareva et al.,
2013): Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Given
a message, our system classifies whether the
message is positive, negative or neutral senti-
ment. It uses a co-occurrence rate model. The
training data are constrained to the data pro-
vided by the task organizers (No other tweet
data are used). We consider 9 types of fea-
tures and use a subset of them in our submitted
system. To see the contribution of each type of
features, we do experimental study on features
by leaving one type of features out each time.
Results suggest that unigrams are the most im-
portant features, bigrams and POS tags seem
not helpful, and stopwords should be retained
to achieve the best results. The overall results
of our system are promising regarding the con-
strained features and data we use.

1 Introduction

The past years have witnessed the emergence and
popularity of short messages such as tweets and
SMS messages. Comparing with the traditional gen-
res such as newswire data, tweets are very short and
use informal grammar and expressions. The short-
ness and informality make them a new genre and
bring new challenges to sentiment analysis (Pang et
al., 2002) as well as other NLP applications such
named entity recognition (Habib et al., 2013).

Recently a wide range of methods and features
have been applied to sentimental analysis over
tweets. Go et al. (2009) train sentiment classi-
fiers using machine learning methods, such as Naive

Bayes, Maximum Entropy and SVMs, with different
combinations of features such as unigrams, bigrams
and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. Microblogging fea-
tures such as hashtags, emoticons, abbreviations, all-
caps and character repetitions are also found help-
ful (Kouloumpis et al., 2011). Saif et al. (2012)
train Naive Bayes models with semantic features.
Also the lexicon prior polarities have been proved
very useful (Agarwal et al., 2011). Davidov et al.
(2010) utilize hashtags and smileys to build a large-
scale annotated tweet dataset automatically. This
avoids the need for labour intensive manual anno-
tation. Due to the fact that tweets are generated con-
stantly, sentiment analysis over tweets has some in-
teresting applications, such as predicting stock mar-
ket movement (Bollen et al., 2011) and predicting
election results (Tumasjan et al., 2010; O’Connor et
al., 2010).

But there are still some unclear parts in the lit-
erature. For example, it is unclear whether using
POS tags improves the sentiment analysis perfor-
mance or not. Conflicting results are reported (Pak
and Paroubek, 2010; Go et al., 2009). It is also
a little surprising that not removing stopwords in-
creases performance (Saif et al., 2012). In this pa-
per, we build a system based on the concept of co-
occurrence rate. 9 different types of features are con-
sidered. We find that using a subset of these features
achieves the best results in our system, so we use
this subset of features rather than all the 9 types of
features in our submitted system. To see the contri-
bution of each type of features, we perform experi-
ments by leaving one type of features out each time.
Results show that unigrams are the most important

features, bigrams and POS tags seem not helpful,
and retaining stopwords makes the results better.
The overall results of our system are also promis-
ing regarding the constrained features and data we
use.

2 System Description

2.1 Method
We use a supervised method which is similar to the
Naive Bayes classifier. The score of a tweet, denoted
by t, and a sentiment category, denoted by c, is cal-
culated according to the following formula:

Score(t, c) = [

n∑
i=1

log CR(fi, c)] + log P (c),

where fi is a feature extracted from t. The sentiment
category c can be positive, negative or neutral. And
CR(fi, c) is Co-occurrence Rate (CR) of fi and c
which can be obtained as follows:

CR(f, c) =
P (fi, c)

P (fi)P (c)
∝ #(fi, c)

#(fi)#(c)
,

where #(∗) is the number of times that the pattern
∗ appears in the training dataset. Then the category
of the highest score arg maxc Score(t, c) is the pre-
diction.

This method assumes all the features are inde-
pendent which is also the assumption of the Naive
Bayes model. But our model excludes P (fi) be-
cause they are observations. Hence comparing with
Naive Bayes, our model saves the effort to model
feature distributions P (fi). Also this method can
be trained efficiently because it only depends on the
empirical distributions.

2.2 Features
To make our system general, we constrain to the text
features. That is we do not use the features outside
the tweet texts such as features related to the user
profiles, discourse information or links. The follow-
ing 9 types of features are considered:

1. Unigrams. We use lemmas as the form of un-
igrams. The lemmas are obtained by the Stan-
ford CoreNLP1 (Toutanova et al., 2003). Hash-

1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml

tags and emoticons are also considered as un-
igrams. Some of the unigrams are stopwords
which will be discussed in the next section.

2. Bigrams. We consider two adjacent lemmas as
bigrams.

3. Named entities. We use the CMU Twitter Tag-
ger (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013)2

to recognize named entities. The tokens cov-
ered by a named entity are not considered as
unigrams any more. Instead a named entity as
a whole is treated as a single feature.

4. Dependency relations. Dependency relations
are helpful to the sentiment prediction. Here we
give an example to explain this type of features.
In the tweet “I may not be able to vote from
Britain but I COMPLETLEY support you!!!!” ,
the dependency relation between the word ‘not’
and ‘able’ is ‘NEG’ which stands for nega-
tion, and the dependency relation between the
word ‘COMPLETELY’ and ‘support’ is ‘ADV-
MOD’ which means adverb modifier. For this
example, we add ‘NEG able’ and ‘completely
support’ as dependency features to our system.
We use Stanford CoreNLP (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003a; Klein and Manning, 2003b) to ob-
tain dependencies. And we only consider two
types of dependencies ‘NEG’ and ‘ADVMOD’.
Other dependency relations are not helpful.

5. Lexicon prior polarity. The prior polarity of
lexicons have been proved very useful to sen-
timent analysis. Many lexicon resources have
been developed. But for a single lexicon re-
source, the coverage is limited. To achieve
better coverage, we merge three lexicon re-
sources. The first one is SentiStrength3 (Ku-
cuktunc et al., 2012). SentiStrength provides a
fine-granularity system for grading lexicon po-
larity which ranges from −5 (most negative) to
+5 (most positive). Our grading system con-
sists of three categories: negative, neutral and
positive. So we map the words ranging from
−5 to −1 in SentiStrength to negative in our
grading system, and the words ranging from

+1 to +5 to positive. The rest are mapped
to neutral. We do the same for the other two
lexicon resources: OpinionFinder4 (Wiebe et
al., 2005) and SentiWordNet5 (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2006; Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010).

6. Intensifiers. The tweets containing intensifiers
are more likely to be non-neutral. In the sub-
mitted system, we merge the boosters in Sen-
tiStrength and the intensifiers in OpinionFinder
to form a list of intensifiers. Some of these in-
tensifiers strengthen emotion (e.g. ‘definitely’),
but others weaken emotion (e.g. ‘slightly’).
They are distinguished and assigned with dif-
ferent labels {intensifier strengthen,
intensifier weaken}.

7. All-caps and repeat characters. All-caps6 and
repeat characters are common expressions in
tweets to make emphasis on the applied tokens.
They can be considered as implicit intensifiers.
In our system, we first normalize the repeat
characters. For example, happyyyy is nor-
malized to happy as there are ≥ 3 consequent
y. Then they are treated in the same way as
intensifier features discussed above.

8. Interrogative sentence. Interrogative sentences
are more likely to be neutral. So we add if a
tweet includes interrogative sentences as a fea-
ture to our system. The sentences ending with
a question mark ‘?’ are considered as inter-
rogative sentences. We first use the Stanford
CoreNLP to find the sentence boundaries in a
tweet, then check the ending mark of each sen-
tence.

9. Imperative sentence. Intuitively, imperative
sentences are more likely to be negative. So
if a tweet contains imperative sentences can be
a feature. We consider the sentences start with
a verb as imperative sentences. The verbs are
identified by the CMU Twitter Tagger.

We further filter out the low-frequency features
which have been observed less than 3 times in the

6All characters of a token are in upper case.

training data. Because these features are not stable
indicators of sentiment. Our experiments show that
removing these low-frequency features increases the
accuracy.

2.3 Pre-processing

The pre-processing of our system includes two steps.
In the first step, we replace the abbreviations as de-
scribed in Section 2.3.1. In the second step, we use
the CMU Twitter Tagger to extract the features of
emoticons (e.g. :)), hashtags (e.g. #Friday), re-
ciepts (e.g. @Peter) and URLs, and remove these
symbols from tweet texts for further processing.

2.3.1 Replacing Abbreviations
Abbreviations are replaced by their original ex-

pressions. We use the Internet Lingo Dictionary
(Wasden, 2010) to obtain the original expressions
of abbreviations. This dictionary originally contains
748 acronyms. But we do not use the acronyms in
which all characters are digits. Because we find they
are more likely to be numbers than acronyms. This
results in 735 acronyms.

3 Experiments

Our system is implemented in Java and organized
as a pipeline consisting of a sequence of annotators
and extractors. This architecture is very similar to
the framework of UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).
With such an architecture, we can easily vary the
configurations of our system.

3.1 Datasets

We use the standard dataset provided by Se-
mEval2013 Task2-B (Kozareva et al., 2013) for
training and testing. The training and develop-
ment data provided are merged together to train our
model. Originally, the training and development
data contain 9,684 and 1,654 instances, respectively.
But due to the policy of Twitter, only the tweet IDs
can be released publicly. So we need to fetch the ac-
tual tweets by their IDs. Some of the tweets are no
longer existing after they were downloaded for an-
notation. So the number of tweets used for training
is less than the original tweets provided by the orga-
nizers. In our case, we obtained 10,370 tweets for
training our model.

Table 2: Submitted System on SMS Data

There are two test datasets: Twitter and SMS. The
first dataset consists of 3,813 twitter messages and
the second dataset contains 2,094 SMS messages.
The purpose of having a separate test set of SMS
messages is to see how well systems trained on twit-
ter data will generalize to other types of data.

3.2 Results of Our Submitted System

We use a subset of features described in Section 2.2
in our submitted system: unigrams, named entities,
dependency relations, lexicon prior polarity, inten-
sifiers, all-caps and repeat characters, interrogative
and imperative sentences. The official results on the
two datasets are given in Table (1, 2). Our system is
ranked as #14/51 on the Twitter dataset and #18/44
on the SMS dataset.

3.3 Feature Contribution Analysis

To see the contribution of each type of features, we
vary the configuration of our system by leaving one
type of features out each time. The results are listed
in Table 3.

In Table 3, ‘Y(T)’ means the corresponding fea-
ture is used and the test dataset is the Twitter Data,
and ‘N(sms)’ means the corresponding feature is left
out and the test dataset is SMS Data.

From Table 3, we can see that unigrams are the
most important features. Leaving out unigrams
leads to a radical decrease of F-scores. On the Twit-
ter dataset, the F-score drops from 59.87 to 41.44,
and on the SMS dataset, the F-score drops from
52.64 to 35.09. And also filtering out the low-

Feature Y(T) N(T) Y(sms) N(sms)
Stopword 59.87 58.19 52.64 51.00
POS Tag 58.68 59.87 51.87 52.64
Bigram 58.47 59.87 51.94 52.64

Lexicon 59.87 58.33 52.64 51.26

Named Ent. 59.87 59.71 52.64 51.80
Interrogative 59.87 59.67 52.64 52.93
Imperative 59.87 59.54 52.64 52.14

Dependence 59.87 59.37 52.64 52.08

Table 3: Avg (Pos & Neg) of Leave-one-out Experiments

frequency features which happens less than 3 times
increases the F-scores on Twitter data from 57.66 to
59.87, and on SMS data from 51.20 to 52.64. Re-
moving stopwords decreases the scores by 1.66 per-
cent. This result is consistent with that reported by
Saif et al. (2012). By taking a close look at the
stopwords we use, we find that some of the stop-
words are highly related to the sentiment polarity,
such as ‘can’, ‘no’, ‘very’ and ‘want’, but others
are not, such as ‘the’, ‘him’ and ‘on’. Removing
the stopwords which are related to the sentiment
is obviously harmful. This means the stopwords
which originally developed for the purpose of in-
formation retrieval are not suitable for sentimental
analysis. Dependency relations are also helpful fea-
tures which increase F-scores by about 0.5 percent.
The POS tags and bigrams seem not helpful in our
experiments, which is consistent with the results re-
ported by (Kouloumpis et al., 2011).

4 Conclusions

We described the method and features used in our
system. We also did analysis on feautre contribu-
tion. Experiment results suggest that unigrams are
the most important features, POS tags and bigrams
seem not helpful, filtering out the low-frequency fea-
tures is helpful and retaining stopwords makes the
results better.
