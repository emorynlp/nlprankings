Abstract

The paper presents the results of the first
large-scale human evaluation of automatic
grammatical error correction (GEC) sys-
tems. Twelve participating systems and
the unchanged input of the CoNLL-2014
shared task have been reassessed in a
WMT-inspired human evaluation proce-
dure. Methods introduced for the Work-
shop of Machine Translation evaluation
campaigns have been adapted to GEC and
extended where necessary. The produced
rankings are used to evaluate standard
metrics for grammatical error correction in
terms of correlation with human judgment.

1 Introduction

The field of automatic grammatical error correc-
tion (GEC) has seen a number of shared tasks
of different scope and for different languages.
The most impactful were the CoNLL-2013 and
CoNLL-2014 (Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014)
shared tasks on Grammatical Error Correction
for ESL (English as a second language) learn-
ers. They were preceded by the HOO shared tasks
(Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012).
Shared tasks for other languages took place as
well, including the QALB workshops for Arabic
(Mohit et al., 2014) and NLP-TEA competitions
for Chinese. These tasks use automatic metrics to
determine the quality of the participating systems.

However, these efforts pale in comparison to
competitions organized in other fields, e.g. dur-
ing the annual Workshops for Machine Transla-
tion (WMT). It is a central idea of the WMTs that
automatic measures of machine translation quality
are an imperfect substitute for human assessments.
Therefore, manual evaluation of the system out-
puts are conducted and their results are reported as
the final rankings of the workshops. These human

evaluation campaigns are an important driving fac-
tor for the advancement of MT and produce in-
sightful “by-products”, such as a huge number of
human assessments of machine translation outputs
that have been used to evaluate automatic metrics.

We believe that the unavailability of this kind
of quality assessment may stall the development
of GEC, as all the shared tasks and the entire field
have to cope with an inherent uncertainty of their
methods and metrics. We hope to make a step to-
wards alleviating this lack of confidence by pre-
senting the results of the first1 large-scale human
evaluation of automatic grammatical error correc-
tion systems submitted to the CoNLL-2014 shared
task. Most of our inspiration is drawn from the re-
cent WMT edition (Bojar et al., 2014) and its met-
rics task (Macháček and Bojar, 2014).

We also provide an analysis of correlation be-
tween the standard metrics in GEC and human
judgment and show that the commonly used pa-
rameters for standard metrics in the shared task
may not be optimal. The uncertainty about met-
rics quality leads to proposals of new metrics, with
Felice and Briscoe (2015) being a recent example.
Based on human judgments we can show that this
proposed metric maybe less useful than hoped.

2 Evaluation of GEC systems

Madnani et al. (2011) addresses two problems of
GEC evaluation: 1) a lack of informative metrics
and 2) an inability to directly compare the per-
formance of systems developed by different re-
searchers. Two evaluation methodologies are pre-
sented, both based on crowdsourcing which are
used to grade types of errors rather than system
performance as presented in this work. Chodorow
et al. (2012) draw attention to the many evalua-

1During the camera-ready preparation phase, we learned
about similar research by Napoles et al. (2015). After con-
tacting the authors, it was agreed to treat both works as fully
concurrent. Future work will compare the results.

tion issues in error detection which make it hard
to compare different approaches. The lack of con-
sensus is due to the nature of the error detection
task. The authors argue that the choice of the met-
ric should take into account factors such as the
skew of the data and the application that the sys-
tem is used for.

The most recent addition is Felice and Briscoe
(2015) who present a novel evaluation method for
grammatical error correction that scores systems
in terms of improvement on the original text.

3 The CoNLL-2014 shared task

The goal of the CoNLL-2014 shared task (Ng et
al., 2014) was to evaluate algorithms and systems
for automatically correcting grammatical errors in
English essays written by second language learn-
ers of English. Training and test data was anno-
tated with 28 error types. Participating teams were
given training data with manually annotated cor-
rections of grammatical errors and were allowed
to use publicly available resources for training.

Twenty-five student non-native speakers of En-
glish were recruited to write essays to be used as
test data. Each student wrote two essays. The 50
test essays were error-annotated by two English
native speakers. The essays and error annotations
were made available after the task. The MaxMatch
(M2) scorer (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012) has been
used as the official shared task evaluation metric.

4 Data collection

4.1 Sampling sentences for evaluation
The system outputs of the CoNLL-2014 shared
task serve as evaluation data. The test set consists
of 1312 sentences, there are twelve system out-
puts available. The thirteenth participant NARA
is missing from this set. However, in GEC eval-
uation there is also the input to consider. Often
system outputs are equal to the unmodified input,
as it is most desirable if there are in fact no errors.
We include INPUT as the thirteenth system.

Due to the small number of modifications that
GEC systems apply to the input, there is not only
a large overlap with the input, but also among all
systems (Figure 1). If we sample systems uni-
formly, we lose easily obtainable pairwise judg-
ments for systems with the same output, and if
we collapse before sampling we introduce a strong
bias towards ties. To counter that bias, we aban-
don uniform sampling of test set sentences and use

tences produced by 13 systems per input sentence.

instead a parametrized distribution that favors di-
verse sets of outputs.

The probability pi for a set of outputs Oi is cal-
culated as follows: N is the number of systems to
be evaluated, M is the maximum number of sen-
tences presented to the evaluator in a single rank-
ing (we use M = 5). The set of system outputs to
be evaluated E = {O1, . . . , On} ∀1≤i≤n|Oi| =
N , consists of n (= 1312) sets Oi of N output
sentences each. Every sentence in Oi can overlap
with other sentences multiple times, so for each set
Oi we define the corresponding multiset of multi-
plicities Ui, such that

∑
u∈Ui u = N .

We define ci(j) as the number of possible ways
to choose at mostM different sentences that cover
j systems for the i-th set of outputs:

ci(j) =

∣∣∣∣∣
{
S ⊆ Ui : |S| ≤M ∧

∑
u∈S

u = j

}∣∣∣∣∣ .
Then the expected number Ci of systems cov-

ered by choosing at most M sentences is

Ci =

∑N
j=M ci(j) · j∑N
j=M ci(j)

.

The pseudo-probability p′i of sampling the i-th
sentence is defined as

p′i =

which is the ratio of pairwise comparisons of M

4.2 Collecting system rankings
The sets of outputs sampled with the described
method have been prepared for Appraise (Feder-
mann, 2010) and presented to the judges. Judges
were asked to rank sentences from best to worse.
Ties are allowed. Judges were aware that the ab-
solute ranks bear no relevance as ranks are later
turned into relative pairwise judgments. No notion
of “better” or “worse” was imposed by the authors,
we relied on the judges to develop their own intu-
ition. All eight judges are English native speakers
and have extensive backgrounds in linguistics.

Figure 2a displays a screen shot of Appraise
with a judged sentence. Several modifications to
the Appraise framework2 were implemented to ac-
count for the specific nature of GEC:

Only the input sentence is displayed (top, bold),
no reference correction is given. The input sen-
tence is surrounded by one preceding and one fol-

lowing sentence. Identical corrections are col-
lapsed into one output, system names with the
same output are recorded internally. Edited frag-
ments are highlighted, blue for insertions and sub-
stitutions, pale blue and crossed-out for deletions.

4.3 Pairwise judgments

As conducted during the WMT campaigns, we
turn rankings into sets of relative judgments of
the form A>B, A=B, A<B where the lower ranked
system scores a win. Absolute ranks and differ-
ences are lost. As mentioned above, due to the col-
lapsing of identical outputs we obtain significantly
more data than the usual 10 pairs from one ranking
with five sentences. Figure 2a contains a ranking
with overlapping outputs as displayed in the top
graph of Figure 2b. Pairs from within overlaps re-
sult in ties, pairs between overlaps are expanded
as products,

(

= 15 pairwise judgments can be

extracted. Greater overlap leads to more pairwise
judgments (bottom,

= 78).

Table 1 lists the full statistics for collected rank-
ings by individual annotators. Unexpanded pairs
are WMT-style pairwise judgments before an out-
put A gets split into overlapping systems A1, A2,
A3, etc. The large number of ties for expanded
pairs is to be expected due to the high overlap

between systems (on average there are only 5.7
unique outputs among 13 systems).

4.4 Inter- and intra-annotator agreement
Again inspired by the WMT evaluation cam-
paigns, we compute annotator agreement as a
measure of reliability of the pairwise judgments
with Cohen’s kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960):

κ =
P (A)− P (E)

1− P (E) .

where P (A) is the proportion of times that anno-
tators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of times
that they would agree by chance. κ assumes values
from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).

All probabilities are computed as ratios of em-
pirically counted pairwise judgments. As the
judges worked on collapsed outputs, we calculate
agreement scores for unexpanded pairs; otherwise,
the high overlap would unfairly increase agree-
ment.
P (A) is calculated by examining all pairs of

outputs which have been judged by two or more
judges, and counting the proportion of times that
they agreed that A<B, A=B, or A>B.
P (E) = P (A<B)2+P (A=B)2+P (A>B)2 is the

probability that two judges agree randomly. Intra-
annotator agreement as a measure of consistency
is calculated for output sets that have been judged
more than one time by the same annotator.

The agreement numbers in Table 2 are in the
lower range of values reported during WMT. How-
ever, it should be noted that judges never saw the
repeated outputs within one ranking which prob-
ably decreases agreement compared to the MT-
specific task.

5 Computing ranks

In this section, it is our aim to produce a system
ranking from best to worse by computing the av-
erage number of times each system was judged
better than other systems based on the collected
pairwise rankings. While previously introduced
methods for producing rankings, total orderings,
as well as partial orderings at chosen confidence-
levels, can be directly applied to our data, deter-
mining which ranking is more accurate turns out
to be methodologically and computationally more
involved due to the specific nature of GEC outputs.

5.1 Ranking methods

We adapt two ranking methods applied during
WMT13 and WMT14 to GEC evaluation: the Ex-
pected Wins method and a version of TrueSkill.

Expected Wins. Expected Wins (EW) has been
introduced for WMT13 (Bojar et al., 2013) and is
based on an underlying model of “relative ability”
proposed in Koehn (2012). One advantage of this
method is its intuitiveness; the scores reflect the
probability that a system Si will be ranked better
than another system that has been randomly cho-
sen from a pool of opponents {Sj : j 6= i}. Defin-
ing the function win(A,B) as the number of times
system A is ranked better than system B, Bojar et

.

TrueSkill. The TrueSkill ranking system (Her-
brich et al., 2007) is a skill based ranking system
for Xbox Live developed at Microsoft Research. It
is used to identify and model player (GEC systems
in our case) ability in a game to assign players to
competitive matches. The TrueSkill ranking sys-
tem models each player Si by two parameters: the
average relative ability µSi and the degree of un-

certainty in the player’s ability σ2Si . Maintaining
uncertainty allows TS to make greater changes to
the ability estimates at the beginning and smaller
changes after a number of consistent matches has
been played. Due to that TS can identify the abil-
ity of individual players from a smaller number of
pairwise comparisons.

A modification of this approach to the WMT
manual evaluation procedure by Sakaguchi et al.
(2014) has been adopted as the official rank-
ing method during WMT14 replacing EW. The
TrueSkill scores are calculated as inferred means:

scoreTS(Si) = µSi .

5.2 Rank clusters

Both ranking methods produce total orderings
without information on the statistical significance
of the obtained ranks. Bojar et al. (2014) notice
that the similarity of the participants in terms of
methods and training data causes some of them
to be very similar and group systems into equiv-
alence classes as proposed by Koehn (2012).

Although the methods and training data among
the systems examined in this paper are quite di-
verse, a great similarity of produced outputs is an
inherent property of GEC. Therefore, in this sec-
tion, for each system Sj placed on rank rj we
also try to determine the true systems rank ranges
[r′j , . . . , r

′′
j ] at a confidence-level of 95% and clus-

ters of equivalent systems by following the proce-
dure outlined by Koehn (2012).

This is accomplished by applying bootstrap re-
sampling. Pairwise rankings are drawn from the
set of judgments with multiple drawings. Based
on this sample a new ranking is produced. After
repeating this process a 1000 times the obtained
1000 ranks for Sj are sorted, with the top 25 and
bottom 25 ranks being discarded. The interval of
the remaining ranks serves as the final rank range.
Next, these rank ranges are used to produce clus-
ters of overlapping rank ranges. This is the last
step required to produce the rankings in Tables 3b
and 3c for both methods, EW and TS, respectively.

5.3 Choosing the final ranking

Now, we face the question which ranking should
be presented as the final result of the human eval-
uation task. Again, we turn to Bojar et al. (2014)
who choose their rankings based on the ranking
model’s ability to predict pairwise rankings. Ac-
curacy is computed by 100-fold cross-validation.
For each fold a new ranking is trained from 99
parts with the left-over part serving as test data.

In a first step, we calculate the accuracy of
the unclustered total orderings discarding ties. A
ranking based on model scores alone cannot pre-
dict ties, this requires equivalence classes. Bojar et
al. (2014) define a draw radius r such that systems
whose scores differ by less than r are assigned to
one cluster, r is tuned to maximize accuracy.

In our case, due to the large number of ties, their
method of tuning r is trapped in local maxima and
assigns all systems to a single cluster. Alterna-
tively, we propose to calculate clusters according
to the method described in the previous section.

Method EW TS

Total ordering (non-ties) 58.18 58.15
Bootstrapped clusters 40.12 39.48

Table 4: Accuracy for ranking-based prediction of
pairwise judgments.

By fixing p ≤ 0.05 we directly evaluate rank-
ings of the form given in Table 3. The absolute
values of scores and their different interpretations
between methods become irrelevant which makes
it unnecessary to tune a parameter like r. The
main drawback of this approach is its computa-
tional cost. For each of the 100 folds we boot-
strap another 100 rankings with EW and TS, fix
p ≤ 0.05 and calculate rank clusters. The single
clustered ranking for each fold is then used to cal-
culate accuracy for the held-out test data.

For our data, contrary to the MT-specific re-
sults from Bojar et al. (2014), EW beats TS in
both cases (Table 4). We therefore present the
ExpectedWins-based ranking (Table 3b) as the fi-
nal result of the human evaluation effort described
in this work and refer to it in the remainder of the
paper when the human ranking is mentioned.

5.4 Analysis

The final human-created ranking (Table 3b) con-
sists of four non-overlapping rank clusters. Rank
ranges have been calculated at a confidence level
of 95%. Comparing the official CoNLL-2014
ranking (Table 3a) with the manually created Ex-
pectedWins ranking shows interesting differences.

The AMU system is judged to be a clear leader
by human judges in its own rank cluster. For six
out of eight judges, AMU has the highest score
(Table 7). The officially winning system CAMB
occupies third place in terms of EW scores and
is placed in the second cluster with four systems.
Only one judge put CAMB in first place. RAC, a
middling system, is elevated to second place oc-
cupying a rank cluster with three other systems.
NTHU, another middling system that based on M2

should be similar to RAC, is put in the second to
last position. Two systems are judged to be worse
than INPUT. The rank cluster that includes INPUT
is the largest among the four clusters.

We also include pairwise comparisons between
all systems according to EW in Table 3d. Each cell
contains the percentage of times the system in that
column was judged to be better than the system in

466



that row. Bold values mark the winner. We ap-
plied the Sign Test to measure statistically signifi-
cant differences, ? indicates statistical significance
at p ≤ 0.10, † at p ≤ 0.05, and ‡ at p ≤ 0.01.
6 Correlation with GEC metrics

Since WMT08 (Callison-Burch et al., 2008) the
“metrics task” has been part of the WMT. The aim
of the metrics task is to assess the quality of auto-
matic evaluation metrics for MT in terms of cor-
relation with the collected human judgments. We
attempt the same in the context of GEC.

6.1 Measures of correlation
Based on Macháček and Bojar (2013), we use
Spearman’s rank correlation ρ and Pearson’s r to
compare the similarity of rankings produced by
various metrics to the manual ranking from the
previous section.

Spearman’s rank correlation ρ. Spearman’s ρ
for rankings with no ties is defined as

ρ = 1− 6
∑
d2i

n(n2 − 1)
where di is the distance between human and met-
ric rank for system i, n is the number of systems.

Pearson’s r. Macháček and Bojar (2013) find
that Spearman’s ρ is too harsh and propose to also
use Pearson’s r, calculated as

r =
∑n

i=1(Hi − H̄)(Mi − M̄)√∑n
i=1(Hi − H̄)2

√∑n
i=1(Mi − M̄)2

whereH andM are the vectors of human and met-
ric scores, H̄ and M̄ are corresponding means.

6.2 Metrics
The inventory of evaluation metrics for GEC is
significantly smaller than for MT. We hope that
making our data available will fuel the interest in
this area. The following metrics are assessed:

MaxMatch (M2). Due to its adoption as the
main evaluation metric of the CoNLL shared tasks
and the QALB shared tasks (Mohit et al., 2014),
the M2 metric (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012) can be
seen as a de facto standard. Being an Fβ-score, M2

results are most influenced by the choice of β. Be-
tween the CoNLL-2013 and CoNLL-2014 shared
tasks, the organizers changed β from 1.0 to 0.5,
and motivate this with intuition alone. The QALB
shared tasks for Arabic continue to use β = 1.0.

I-measure/Weighted Accuracy (I-WAcc). The
recently proposed I-WAcc metric (Felice and
Briscoe, 2015) tries to address the shortcomings
of M2. The inclusion of true negatives into the for-
mula makes this a very conservative metric; quite
similar to the MT metrics described below. The
metric assigns negative weights to systems that are
harmful with regard to the input text, values from
the range [1,−1] are possible. The reported corre-
lation values have been calculated for the ranking
presented in Felice and Briscoe (2015).

Machine translation evaluation metrics. Bas-
ing most of our results on findings from MT, we
also take a look at two machine translation eval-
uation metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and
METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011). In order
to use the CoNLL-2014 gold standard with these
metrics, the edit-based annotation has been con-
verted into two plain text files, one per annotator.

6.3 Analysis

The correlation results are collected in table 5. The
M2 metric is generally moderately correlated with

human judgment and is on the brink of high cor-
relation for values of β closer to 0.2. Compared
to M2, the other metrics are weakly or moderately
inversely correlated to human judgment. Inverse
correlation with human judgments for metrics that
all assign higher scores to better systems seems
problematic. In the case of I-WAcc, we would
go as far as to state an absence of correlation. It
seems the conservative approach adopted for I-
WAcc does not correspond to the notion of quality
that our judges worked out for themselves. The
switch to β = 0.5 from β = 1.0 for the CoNLL-
2014 shared task was a good choice, but a higher
correlation can be achieved for β = 0.25, the max-
imum is reached for β = 0.18. Correlation drops
sharply for β = 0.1. The lack of positive corre-
lation for the MT-metrics is interesting in the light
of improvement that results from a shift towards
precision for M2 as BLEU is based on precision.

Figure 3 contains detailed plots of ρ and r with
regard to β within the [0, 1] range. As the CoNLL-
2014 test data included edits from two annotators,

we plot curves for both annotators separately and
for the combined gold standard. In the case of
Spearman’s ρ having alternative error annotations,
this leads to higher correlation values. Based on
the plots we would recommend setting 0.2 ≤ β ≤
0.3 instead of 0.5 or even 1.0.

Inter-annotator correlations of rankings com-
puted for individual judges (Table 6) can be treated
as human-level upper bounds for metric correla-
tion. The penultimate column and row contain
correlations of rankings for individual judges with
rankings computed from all judges minus the re-
spective judge. The last column and row con-
tain the respective weighted (w.r.t. judgments per
judge) average of these correlations.

7 Conclusions and future work

We have successfully adapted methods from the
WMT human evaluation campaigns to automatic
grammatical error correction. The collected and
produced data has been made available and should
be useful for other researchers. Although we set
out to provide answers, we probably ended up with
more questions. The following (and more) might
be investigated in the future: What makes the win-
ning system special and why do the standard met-
rics fail at identifying this system? Can we come
up with better system-level metrics? Can mean-
ingful sentence-level metrics be developed?

Outside the scope of the particular data, we need
to wonder if our results generalize to other shared
tasks and other languages. The CoNLL-2014 data
concerns ESL learners only and may not be trans-
ferable to systems for native speakers. This would
be in line with the ideas developed by Chodorow et
al. (2012). We would hope to see similar endeav-
ors for the other shared tasks as this would enable
the field to draw more general conclusions.
