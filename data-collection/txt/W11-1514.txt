Abstract

Today we have access to unprecedented
amounts of literary texts. However, search
still relies heavily on key words. In this pa-
per, we show how sentiment analysis can be
used in tandem with effective visualizations to
quantify and track emotions in both individual
books and across very large collections. We
introduce the concept of emotion word den-
sity, and using the Brothers Grimm fairy tales
as example, we show how collections of text
can be organized for better search. Using the
Google Books Corpus we show how to deter-
mine an entity’s emotion associations from co-
occurring words. Finally, we compare emo-
tion words in fairy tales and novels, to show
that fairy tales have a much wider range of
emotion word densities than novels.

1 Introduction

Literary texts, such as novels, fairy tales, fables, ro-
mances, and epics have long been channels to con-
vey emotions, both explicitly and implicitly. With
widespread digitization of text, we now have easy
access to unprecedented amounts of such literary
texts. Project Gutenberg provides access to 34,000
books (Lebert, 2009).1 Google is providing ac-
cess to n-gram sequences and their frequencies from
more than 5.2 million digitized books, as part of
the Google Books Corpus (GBC) (Michel et al.,
2011a).2 However, techniques to automatically ac-
cess and analyze these books still rely heavily on key

word searches alone. In this paper, we show how
sentiment analysis can be used in tandem with ef-
fective visualizations to quantify and track emotions
in both individual books and across very large col-
lections. This serves many purposes, including:

1. Search: Allowing search based on emotions.
For example, retrieving the darkest of the
Brothers Grimm fairy tales, or finding snippets
from the Sherlock Holmes series that build the
highest sense of anticipation and suspense.

2. Social Analysis: Identifying how books have
portrayed different people and entities over
time. For example, what is the distribution of
emotion words used in proximity to mentions
of women, race, and homosexuals. (Similar to
how Michel et al. (2011b) tracked fame by ana-
lyzing mentions in the Google Books Corpus.)

3. Comparative analysis of literary works, gen-
res, and writing styles: For example, is the dis-
tribution of emotion words in fairy tales sig-
nificantly different from that in novels? Do
women authors use a different distribution of
emotion words than their male counterparts?
Did Hans C. Andersen use emotion words dif-
ferently than Beatrix Potter?

4. Summarization: For example, automatically
generating summaries that capture the different
emotional states of the characters in a novel.

5. Analyzing Persuasion Tactics: Analyzing emo-
tion words and their role in persuasion (Man-
nix, 1992; Bales, 1997).

In this paper, we describe how we use a large word–
emotion association lexicon (described in Section

105



3.1) to create a simple emotion analyzer (Section
3.2). We present a number of visualizations that help
track and analyze the use of emotion words in indi-
vidual texts and across very large collections, which
is especially useful in Applications 1, 2, and 3 de-
scribed above (Section 4). We introduce the con-
cept of emotion word density, and using the Broth-
ers Grimm fairy tales as an example, we show how
collections of text can be organized for better search
(Section 5). Using the Google Books Corpus we
show how to determine emotion associations por-
trayed in books towards different entities (Section
6). Finally, for the first time, we compare a collec-
tion of novels and a collection of fairy tales using
an emotion lexicon to show that fairy tales have a
much wider distribution of emotion word densities
than novels.

The emotion analyzer recognizes words with pos-
itive polarity (expressing a favorable sentiment to-
wards an entity), negative polarity (expressing an
unfavorable sentiment towards an entity), and no po-
larity (neutral). It also associates words with joy,
sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, antici-
pation, which are argued to be the eight basic and
prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).

This work is part of a broader project to pro-
vide an affect-based interface to Project Gutenberg.
Given a search query, the goal is to provide users
with relevant plots presented in this paper, as well as
ability to search for text snippets from multiple texts
that have high emotion word densities.

2 Related work

Over the last decade, there has been considerable
work in sentiment analysis, especially in determin-
ing whether a term has a positive or negative polar-
ity (Lehrer, 1974; Turney and Littman, 2003; Mo-
hammad et al., 2009). There is also work in more
sophisticated aspects of sentiment, for example, in
detecting emotions such as anger, joy, sadness, fear,
surprise, and disgust (Bellegarda, 2010; Mohammad
and Turney, 2010; Alm et al., 2005; Alm et al.,
2005). The technology is still developing and it can
be unpredictable when dealing with short sentences,
but it has been shown to be reliable when drawing
conclusions from large amounts of text (Dodds and
Danforth, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2008).

Automatic analysis of emotions in text has so far
had to rely on small emotion lexicons. The WordNet
Affect Lexicon (WAL) (Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004) has a few hundred words annotated with as-
sociations to a number of affect categories including
the six Ekman emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear,
disgust, and surprise).3 General Inquirer (GI) (Stone
et al., 1966) has 11,788 words labeled with 182 cat-
egories of word tags, including positive and negative
polarity.4 We use the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mo-
hammad and Yang, 2011; Mohammad and Turney,
2010), a large set of human-provided word–emotion
association ratings, in our experiments.5

Empirical assessment of emotions in literary texts
has sometimes relied on human annotation of the
texts, but this has restricted the number of texts an-
alyzed. For example, Alm and Sproat (2005) an-
notated 22 Brothers Grimm fairy tales to show that
fairy tales often began with a neutral sentence and
ended with a happy sentence. Here we use out-of-
context word–emotion associations and analyze in-
dividual texts to very large collections. We rely on
information from many words to provide a strong
enough signal to overcome individual errors due to
out-of-context annotations.

3 Emotion Analysis

3.1 Emotion Lexicon
The NRC Emotion Lexicon was created by crowd-
sourcing to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, and it is de-
scribed in (Mohammad and Yang, 2011; Moham-
mad and Turney, 2010); we briefly summarize be-
low.

The 1911 Roget Thesaurus was used as the source
for target terms.6 Only those thesaurus words that
occurred more than 120,000 times in the Google n-
gram corpus were annotated for version 0.92 of the
lexicon which we use for the experiments described
in this paper.7

The Roget’s Thesaurus groups related words into
about a thousand categories, which can be thought of

guistic Data Consortium.

as coarse senses or concepts (Yarowsky, 1992). If a
word is ambiguous, then it is listed in more than one
category. Since a word may have different emotion
associations when used in different senses, word-
sense level annotations were obtained by first ask-
ing an automatically generated word-choice ques-
tion pertaining to the target:
Q1. Which word is closest in meaning to shark (target)?

• car • tree • fish • olive
The near-synonym for Q1 is taken from the the-
saurus, and the distractors are randomly chosen
words. This question guides the annotator to the de-
sired sense of the target word. It is followed by ten
questions asking if the target is associated with pos-
itive sentiment, negative sentiment, anger, fear, joy,
sadness, disgust, surprise, trust, and anticipation.
The questions were phrased exactly as described in
Mohammad and Turney (2010).

If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then in-
formation obtained from the remaining questions is
discarded. Thus, even though there were no gold
standard correct answers to the emotion association
questions, likely incorrect annotations were filtered
out. About 10% of the annotations were discarded
because of an incorrect response to Q1.

Each term was annotated by 5 different people.
For 74.4% of the instances, all five annotators agreed
on whether a term is associated with a particular
emotion or not. For 16.9% of the instances four out
of five people agreed with each other. The informa-
tion from multiple annotators for a particular term
was combined by taking the majority vote. The lex-
icon has entries for about 24,200 word–sense pairs.
The information from different senses of a word was
combined by taking the union of all emotions asso-
ciated with the different senses of the word. This
resulted in a word-level emotion association lexicon
for about 14,200 word types.

3.2 Text Analysis
Given a target text, the system determines which of
the words exist in our emotion lexicon and calculates
ratios such as the number of words associated with
an emotion to the total number of emotion words in
the text. This simple approach may not be reliable
in determining if a particular sentence is expressing
a certain emotion, but it is reliable in determining if
a large piece of text has more emotional expressions

compared to others in a corpus. Example applica-
tions include clustering literary texts based on the
distributions of emotion words, analyzing gender-
differences in email (Mohammad and Yang, 2011),
and detecting spikes in anger words in close proxim-
ity to mentions of a target product in a twitter stream
(Dı́az and Ruz, 2002; Dubé and Maute, 1996).

4 Visualizations of Emotions

4.1 Distributions of Emotion Words

Figures 1 and 2 show the percentages of emotion
words in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy, Hamlet, and
his comedy, As you like it, respectively. Figure 3
conveys the difference between the two novels even
more explicitly by showing only the difference in
percentage scores for each of the emotions. Emo-

tions are represented by colours as per a study on
word–colour associations (Mohammad, 2011).

Observe how one can clearly see that Hamlet has
more fear, sadness, disgust, and anger, and less joy,
trust, and anticipation. The bar graph is effective at
conveying the extent to which an emotion is more
prominent in one text than another, but it does not
convey the source of these emotions. Therefore, we
calculate the relative salience of an emotion word w
across two target texts T1 and T2:

RelativeSalience(w|T1, T2) =
f1
N1
− f2
N2

(1)

Where, f1 and f2 are the frequencies of w in T1 and
T2, respectively. N1 and N2 are the total number
of word tokens in T1 and T2. Figures 4 and 5 de-
pict snippets of relative-salience word clouds of trust
words and sadness words across Hamlet and As You
Like it. Our emotion analyzer uses Google’s freely
available software to create word clouds.8

4.2 Flow of Emotions

Literary researchers as well as casual readers may be
interested in noting how the use of emotion words
has varied through the course of a book. Figure 6, 7,
and 8 show the flow of joy, trust, and fear in As You
Like it (comedy), Hamlet (tragedy), and Franken-
stein (horror), respectively. As expected, the visu-
alizations depict the novels to be progressively more
dark than the previous ones in the list. Also that
Frankenstein is much darker in the final chapters.

5 Emotion Word Density

Apart from determining the relative percentage of
different words, the use of emotion words in a book
can also be quantified by calculating the number of
emotion words one is expected to see on reading ev-
ery X words. We will refer to this metric as emotion
word density. All emotion densities reported in this
paper are for X = 10, 000. The dotted line in Fig-
ure 9 shows the negative word density plot of 192
fairy tales collected by Brothers Grimm. The joy

words in every 10,000 words). The plot is of 192 stories but the x-axis has labels for only a few due to lack of space.
A user may select any two tales, say Cinderella and Godfather Death (follow arrows), to reveal Figure 10.

words across Cinderella and Godfather Death.

Figure 11: Cinderella - Godfather Death: Relative

and sadness word densities are also shown—the thin
and thick lines, respectively. A person interested in
understanding the use of emotion words in the fairy
tales collected by Brothers Grimm can further se-
lect any two fairy tales from the plot, to reveal a bar
graph showing the difference in percentages of emo-
tions in the two texts. Figure 10 shows the difference
bar graph of Cinderella and Godfather Death. Fig-
ures 11 depicts the relative-salience word cloud of
joy words across the two fairy tales. The relative-
salience word cloud of fear included: death, ill, be-
ware, poverty, devil, astray, risk, illness, threaten-
ing, horrified and revenge.

6 Emotions Associated with Targets

Words found in proximity of target entities can be
good indicators of emotions associated with the tar-
gets. Google has released n-gram frequency data
from all the books they have scanned up to July
15, 2009.9 The data consists of 5-grams along with
the number of times they were used in books pub-
lished in every year from 1600 to 2009. We an-
alyzed the 5-gram files (about 800GB of data) to
quantify the emotions associated with different tar-
get entities. We ignored data from books published
before 1800 as that period is less comprehensively
covered by Google books. We chose to group the
data into five-year bins, though other groupings are
reasonable as well. Given a target entity of interest,
the system identifies all 5-grams that contain the tar-
get word, identifies all the emotion words in those
n-grams (other than the target word itself), and cal-
culates percentages of emotion words.

Figure 12 shows the percentage of fear words
in the n-grams of different countries. Observe,
that there is a marked rise of fear words around
World War I (1914–1918) for Germany, America,
and China. There is a spike for China around 1900,
likely due to the unrest leading up to the Boxer Re-
bellion (1898–1901).10 The 1810–1814 spike for

China is probably correlated with descriptions of
piracy in the South China Seas, since the era of the
commoner-pirates of mid-Qing dynasty came to an
end in 1810.11 India does not see a spike during
World War I, but has a spike in the 1940’s proba-
bly reflecting heightened vigor in the independence
struggle (Quit India Movement of 194212) and grow-
ing involvement in World War II (1939–1945).13

of joy words in 5-grams that include woman and
man, respectively. Figures 14 shows similar curves
for anger words.

7 Emotion Words in Novels vs. Fairy Tales

Novels and fairy tales are two popular forms of liter-
ary prose. Both forms tell a story, but a fairy tale has
certain distinct characteristics such as (a) archetypal
characters (peasant, king) (b) clear identification of
good and bad characters, (c) happy ending, (d) pres-
ence of magic and magical creatures, and (d) a clear
moral (Jones, 2002). Fairy tales are extremely popu-
lar and appeal to audiences through emotions—they
convey personal concerns, subliminal fears, wishes,
and fantasies in an exaggerated manner (Kast, 1993;
Jones, 2002; Orenstein, 2003). However, there have
not been any large-scale empirical studies to com-
pare affect in fairy tales and novels. Here for the
first time, we compare the use of emotion-associated
words in fairy tales and novels using a large lexicon.

Specifically, we are interested in determining
whether: (1) fairy tales on average have a higher
emotional density than novels, (2) different fairy
tales focus on different emotions such that some
fairy tales have high densities for certain emotion,
whereas others have low emotional densities for
those same emotions.

We used the Corpus of English Novels (CEN) and
the Fairy Tale Corpus (FTC) for our experiments.14

The Corpus of English Novels is a collection of
292 novels written between 1881 and 1922 by 25
British and American novelists. It was compiled
from Project Gutenberg at the Catholic University
of Leuven by Hendrik de Smet. It consists of about
26 million words. The Fairy Tale Corpus (Lobo and
Martins de Matos, 2010) has 453 stories, close to
1 million words, downloaded from Project Guten-

berg. Even though many fairy tales have a strong
oral tradition, the stories in this collection were com-
piled, translated, or penned in the 19th century by
the Brothers Grimm, Beatrix Potter, and Hans C.
Andersen to name a few.

We calculated the polarity and emotion word den-
sity of each of the novels in CEN and each of the
fairy tales in FTC. Table 1 lists the mean densities
as well as standard deviation for each of the eight
basic emotions in the two corpora. We find that the
mean densities for anger and sadness across CEN
and FTC are not significantly different. However,
fairy tales have significantly higher anticipation, dis-
gust, joy, and surprise densities when compared to
novels (p < 0.001). On the other hand, they have
significantly lower trust word density than novels.
Further, the standard deviations for all eight emo-
tions are significantly different across the two cor-
pora (p < 0.001). The fairy tales, in general, have
a much larger standard deviation than the novels.
Thus for each of the 8 emotions, there are more fairy
tales than novels having high emotion densities and
there are more fairy tales than novels having low
emotion densities.

Table 2 lists the mean densities as well as standard
deviation for negative and positive polarity words in
the two corpora. The table states, for example, that
for every 10,000 words in the CEN, one can expect
to see about 1670 negative words. We find that fairy
tales, on average, have a significantly lower number
of negative terms, and a significantly higher number
of positive words (p < 0.001).

In order to obtain a better sense of the distribu-
tion of emotion densities, we generated histograms
by counting all texts that had emotion densities be-
tween 0–99, 100–199, 200–399, and so on. A large
standard deviation for fairy tales could be due to
one of at least two reasons: (1) the histogram has
a bimodal distribution—most of the fairy tales have
extreme emotion densities (either much higher than
that of the novels, or much smaller). (2) the his-
togram approaches a normal distribution such that

negative positive
mean σ mean σ

FTC 1543 613 2808 726

Table 2: Density of polarity words in novels and fairy
tales: number of polar words in every 10,000 words.

more fairy tales than novels have extreme emotion
densities. Figures 15 through 20 show histograms
comparing novels and fairy tales for positive and
negative polarities, as well as for a few emotions.
Observe that fairy tales do not have a bimodal distri-
bution, and case (2) holds true.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented an emotion analyzer that relies on the
powerful word–emotion association lexicon. We
presented a number of visualizations that help track
and analyze the use of emotion words in individ-
ual texts and across very large collections. We in-
troduced the concept of emotion word density, and
using the Brothers Grimm fairy tales as an exam-
ple, we showed how collections of text can be or-
ganized for better search. Using the Google Books
Corpus we showed how to determine emotion asso-
ciations portrayed in books towards different enti-
ties. Finally, for the first time, we compared a col-
lection of novels and a collection of fairy tales using
the emotion lexicon to show that fairy tales have a
much wider distribution of emotion word densities
than novels.

This work is part of a broader project to pro-
vide an affect-based interface to Project Gutenberg.
Given a search query, the goal is to provide users
with relevant plots presented in this paper. Further,
they will be able to search for snippets from multiple
texts that have strong emotion word densities.
