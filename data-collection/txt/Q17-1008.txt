Abstract

Past work in relation extraction has focused
on binary relations in single sentences. Re-
cent NLP inroads in high-value domains have
sparked interest in the more general setting
of extracting n-ary relations that span mul-
tiple sentences. In this paper, we explore a
general relation extraction framework based
on graph long short-term memory networks
(graph LSTMs) that can be easily extended to
cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. The
graph formulation provides a unified way of
exploring different LSTM approaches and in-
corporating various intra-sentential and inter-
sentential dependencies, such as sequential,
syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust
contextual representation is learned for the en-
tities, which serves as input to the relation clas-
sifier. This simplifies handling of relations with
arbitrary arity, and enables multi-task learning
with related relations. We evaluate this frame-
work in two important precision medicine set-
tings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both
conventional supervised learning and distant
supervision. Cross-sentence extraction pro-
duced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task
learning significantly improved extraction ac-
curacy. A thorough analysis of various LSTM
approaches yielded useful insight the impact
of linguistic analysis on extraction accuracy.

1 Introduction

Relation extraction has made great strides in
newswire and Web domains. Recently, there has

been increasing interest in applying relation extrac-
tion to high-value domains such as biomedicine. The
advent of $1000 human genome1 heralds the dawn of
precision medicine, but progress in personalized can-
cer treatment has been hindered by the arduous task
of interpreting genomic data using prior knowledge.
For example, given a tumor sequence, a molecular
tumor board needs to determine which genes and mu-
tations are important, and what drugs are available
to treat them. Already the research literature has a
wealth of relevant knowledge, and it is growing at an
astonishing rate. PubMed2, the online repository of
biomedical articles, adds two new papers per minute,
or one million each year. It is thus imperative to
advance relation extraction for machine reading.

In the vast literature on relation extraction, past
work focused primarily on binary relations in single
sentences, limiting the available information. Con-
sider the following example: “The deletion mutation on
exon-19 of EGFR gene was present in 16 patients, while
the L858E point mutation on exon-21 was noted in 10. All
patients were treated with gefitinib and showed a partial
response.”. Collectively, the two sentences convey
the fact that there is a ternary interaction between
the three entities in bold, which is not expressed in
either sentence alone. Namely, tumors with L858E
mutation in EGFR gene can be treated with gefitinib.
Extracting such knowledge clearly requires moving
beyond binary relations and single sentences.
N -ary relations and cross-sentence extraction have

received relatively little attention in the past. Prior

work on n-ary relation extraction focused on sin-
gle sentences (Palmer et al., 2005; McDonald et al.,
2005) or entity-centric attributes that can be extracted
largely independently (Chinchor, 1998; Surdeanu
and Heng, 2014). Prior work on cross-sentence ex-
traction often used coreference to gain access to ar-
guments in a different sentence (Gerber and Chai,
2010; Yoshikawa et al., 2011), without truly model-
ing inter-sentential relational patterns. (See Section 7
for a more detailed discussion.) A notable excep-
tion is Quirk and Poon (2017), which applied distant
supervision to general cross-sentence relation extrac-
tion, but was limited to binary relations.

In this paper, we explore a general framework
for cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction, based
on graph long short-term memory networks (graph
LSTMs). By adopting the graph formulation, our
framework subsumes prior approaches based on
chain or tree LSTMs, and can incorporate a rich set of
linguistic analyses to aid relation extraction. Relation
classification takes as input the entity representations
learned from the entire text, and can be easily ex-
tended for arbitrary relation arity n. This approach
also facilitates joint learning with kindred relations
where the supervision signal is more abundant.

We conducted extensive experiments on two im-
portant domains in precision medicine. In both dis-
tant supervision and supervised learning settings,
graph LSTMs that encode rich linguistic knowledge
outperformed other neural network variants, as well
as a well-engineered feature-based classifier. Multi-
task learning with sub-relations led to further im-
provement. Syntactic analysis conferred a significant
benefit to the performance of graph LSTMs, espe-
cially when syntax accuracy was high.

In the molecular tumor board domain, PubMed-
scale extraction using distant supervision from a

small set of known interactions produced orders of
magnitude more knowledge, and cross-sentence ex-
traction tripled the yield compared to single-sentence
extraction. Manual evaluation verified that the accu-
racy is high despite the lack of annotated examples.

2 Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction

Let e1, · · · , em be entity mentions in text T . Rela-
tion extraction can be formulated as a classification
problem of determining whether a relation R holds
for e1, · · · , em in T . For example, given a cancer
patient with mutation v in gene g, a molecular tumor
board seeks to find if this type of cancer would re-
spond to drug d. Literature with such knowledge has
been growing rapidly; we can help the tumor board
by checking if the Respond relation holds for the
(d, g, v) triple.

Traditional relation extraction methods focus on
binary relations where all entities occur in the same
sentence (i.e., m = 2 and T is a sentence), and
cannot handle the aforementioned ternary relations.
Moreover, as we focus on more complex relations
and n increases, it becomes increasingly rare that the
related entities will be contained entirely in a single
sentence. In this paper, we generalize extraction to
cross-sentence, n-ary relations, where m > 2 and T
can contain multiple sentences. As will be shown in
our experiments section, n-ary relations are crucial
for high-value domains such as biomedicine, and
expanding beyond the sentence boundary enables the
extraction of more knowledge.

In the standard binary-relation setting, the dom-
inant approaches are generally defined in terms of
the shortest dependency path between the two en-
tities in question, either by deriving rich features
from the path or by modeling it using deep neural

102



networks. Generalizing this paradigm to the n-ary
setting is challenging, as there are

(

)
paths. One

apparent solution is inspired by Davidsonian seman-
tics: first, identify a single trigger phrase that sig-
nifies the whole relation, then reduce the n-ary re-
lation to n binary relations between the trigger and
an argument. However, challenges remain. It is of-
ten hard to specify a single trigger, as the relation
is manifested by several words, often not contigu-
ous. Moreover, it is expensive and time-consuming
to annotate training examples, especially if triggers
are required, as is evident in prior annotation efforts
such as GENIA (Kim et al., 2009). The realistic and
widely adopted paradigm is to leverage indirect su-
pervision, such as distant supervision (Craven and
Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009), where triggers
are not available.

Additionally, lexical and syntactic patterns signi-
fying the relation will be sparse. To handle such
sparsity, traditional feature-based approaches require
extensive engineering and large data. Unfortunately,
this challenge becomes much more severe in cross-
sentence extraction when the text spans multiple sen-
tences.

To overcome these challenges, we explore a gen-
eral relation extraction framework based on graph
LSTMs. By learning a continuous representation
for words and entities, LSTMs can handle sparsity
effectively without requiring intense feature engineer-
ing. The graph formulation subsumes prior LSTM
approaches based on chains or trees, and can incor-
porate rich linguistic analyses.

This approach also opens up opportunities for joint
learning with related relations. For example, the
Response relation over d, g, v also implies a binary
sub-relation over drug d and mutation v, with the
gene underspecified. Even with distant supervision,
the supervision signal for n-ary relations will likely
be sparser than their binary sub-relations. Our ap-
proach makes it very easy to use multi-task learning
over both the n-ary relations and their sub-relations.

3 Graph LSTMs

Learning a continuous representation can be effective
for dealing with lexical and syntactic sparsity. For se-
quential data such as text, recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) are quite popular. They resemble hidden

Markov models (HMMs), except that discrete hid-
den states are replaced with continuous vectors, and
emission and transition probabilities with neural net-
works. Conventional RNNs with sigmoid units suffer
from gradient diffusion or explosion, making train-
ing very difficult (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al.,
2013). Long short-term memory (LSTMs) (Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber, 1997) combats these problems
by using a series of gates (input, forget and output)
to avoid amplifying or suppressing gradients during
backpropagation. Consequently, LSTMs are much
more effective in capturing long-distance dependen-
cies, and have been applied to a variety of NLP tasks.
However, most approaches are based on linear chains
and only explicitly model the linear context, which
ignores a variety of linguistic analyses, such as syn-
tactic and discourse dependencies.

In this section, we propose a general framework
that generalizes LSTMs to graphs. While there is
some prior work on learning tree LSTMs (Tai et al.,
2015; Miwa and Bansal, 2016), to the best of our
knowledge, graph LSTMs have not been applied to
any NLP task yet. Figure 2 shows the architecture of
this approach. The input layer is the word embedding
of input text. Next is the graph LSTM which learns
a contextual representation for each word. For the
entities in question, their contextual representations
are concatenated and become the input to the relation
classifiers. For a multi-word entity, we simply used
the average of its word representations and leave
the exploration of more sophisticated aggregation
approaches to future work. The layers are trained
jointly with backpropagation. This framework is

agnostic to the choice of classifiers. Jointly designing
classifiers with graph LSTMs would be interesting
future work.

At the core of the graph LSTM is a document
graph that captures various dependencies among the
input words. By choosing what dependencies to in-
clude in the document graph, graph LSTMs naturally
subsumes linear-chain or tree LSTMs.

Compared to conventional LSTMs, the graph for-
mulation presents new challenges. Due to potential
cycles in the graph, a straightforward implementation
of backpropagation might require many iterations to
reach a fixed point. Moreover, in the presence of a po-
tentially large number of edge types (adjacent-word,
syntactic dependency, etc.), parametrization becomes
a key problem.

In the remainder of this section, we first introduce
the document graph and show how to conduct back-
propagation in graph LSTMs. We then discuss two
strategies for parametrizing the recurrent units. Fi-
nally, we show how to conduct multi-task learning
with this framework.

3.1 Document Graph
To model various dependencies from linguistic analy-
sis at our disposal, we follow Quirk and Poon (2017)
and introduce a document graph to capture intra- and
inter-sentential dependencies. A document graph
consists of nodes that represent words and edges
that represent various dependencies such as linear
context (adjacent words), syntactic dependencies,
and discourse relations (Lee et al., 2013; Xue et al.,
2015). Figure 1 shows the document graph for our
running example; this instance suggests that tumors
with L858E mutation in EGFR gene responds to the
drug gefitinib.

This document graph acts as the backbone upon
which a graph LSTM is constructed. If it con-

tains only edges between adjacent words, we recover
linear-chain LSTMs. Similarly, other prior LSTM
approaches can be captured in this framework by re-
stricting edges to those in the shortest dependency
path or the parse tree.

3.2 Backpropagation in Graph LSTMs
Conventional LSTMs are essentially very deep feed-
forward neural networks. For example, a left-to-right
linear LSTM has one hidden vector for each word.
This vector is generated by a neural network (re-
current unit) that takes as input the embedding of
the given word and the hidden vector of the previ-
ous word. In discriminative learning, these hidden
vectors then serve as input for the end classifiers,
from which gradients are backpropagated through
the whole network.

Generalizing such a strategy to graphs with cycles
typically requires unrolling recurrence for a number
of steps (Scarselli et al., 2009; Li et al., 2016; Liang
et al., 2016). Essentially, a copy of the graph is
created for each step that serves as input for the next.
The result is a feed-forward neural network through
time, and backpropagation is conducted accordingly.

In principle, we could adopt the same strategy. Ef-
fectively, gradients are backpropagated in a manner
similar to loopy belief propagation (LBP). However,
this makes learning much more expensive as each up-
date step requires multiple iterations of backpropaga-
tion. Moreover, loopy backpropagation could suffer
from the same problems encountered to in LBP, such
as oscillation or failure to converge.

We observe that dependencies such as coreference
and discourse relations are generally sparse, so the
backbone of a document graph consists of the lin-
ear chain and the syntactic dependency tree. As in
belief propagation, such structures can be leveraged
to make backpropagation more efficient by replac-

104



ing synchronous updates, as in the unrolling strat-
egy, with asynchronous updates, as in linear-chain
LSTMs. This opens up opportunities for a variety of
strategies in ordering backpropagation updates.

In this paper, we adopt a simple strategy that per-
formed quite well in preliminary experiments, and
leave further exploration to future work. Specifi-
cally, we partition the document graph into two di-
rected acyclic graphs (DAGs). One DAG contains
the left-to-right linear chain, as well as other forward-
pointing dependencies. The other DAG covers the
right-to-left linear chain and the backward-pointing
dependencies. Figure 3 illustrates this strategy. Effec-
tively, we partition the original graph into the forward
pass (left-to-right), followed by the backward pass
(right-to-left), and construct the LSTMs accordingly.
When the document graph only contains linear chain
edges, the graph LSTMs is exactly a bi-directional
LSTMs (BiLSTMs).

3.3 The Basic Recurrent Propagation Unit

A standard LSTM unit consists of an input vector
(word embedding), a memory cell and an output vec-
tor (contextual representation), as well as several
gates. The input gate and output gate control the
information flowing into and out of the cell, whereas
the forget gate can optionally remove information
from the recurrent connection to a precedent unit.

In linear-chain LSTMs, each unit contains only
one forget gate, as it has only one direct precedent
(i.e., the adjacent-word edge pointing to the previous
word). In graph LSTMs, however, a unit may have
several precedents, including connections to the same
word via different edges. We thus introduce a forget
gate for each precedent, similar to the approach taken
by Tai et al. (2015) for tree LSTMs.

Encoding rich linguistic analysis introduces many
distinct edge types besides word adjacency, such as
syntactic dependencies, which opens up many possi-
bilities for parametrization. This was not considered
in prior syntax-aware LSTM approaches (Tai et al.,
2015; Miwa and Bansal, 2016). In this paper, we ex-
plore two schemes that introduce more fined-grained
parameters based on the edge types.

Full Parametrization Our first proposal simply in-
troduces a different set of parameters for each edge
type, with computation specified below.

it = σ(Wixt +
∑

j∈P (t)
U

m(t,j)
i hj + bi)

ot = σ(Woxt +
∑

j∈P (t)
Um(t,j)o hj + bo)

c̃t = tanh(Wcxt +
∑

j∈P (t)
Um(t,j)c hj + bc)

ftj = σ(Wfxt + U
m(t,j)
f hj + bf )

ct = it � c̃t +
∑

j∈P (t)
ftj � cj

ht = ot � tanh(ct)
As in standard chain LSTMs, xt is the input word

vector for node t, ht is the hidden state vector for
node t, W ’s are the input weight matrices, and b’s
are the bias vectors. σ, tanh, and� represent the sig-
moid function, the hyperbolic tangent function, and
the Hadamard product (pointwise multiplication), re-
spectively. The main differences lie in the recurrence
terms. In graph LSTMs, a unit might have multiple
predecessors (P (t)), for each of which (j) there is
a forget gate ftj , and a typed weight matrix Um(t,j),
where m(t, j) signifies the connection type between
t and j. The input and output gates (it, ot) depend on
all predecessors, whereas the forget gate (ftj) only
depends on the predecessor with which the gate is
associated. ct and c̃t represent intermediate compu-
tation results within the memory cell, which take
into account the input and forget gates, and will be
combined with output gate to produce the hidden
representation ht.

Full parameterization is straightforward, but it re-
quires a large number of parameters when there are
many edge types. For example, there are dozens of
syntactic edge types, each corresponding to a Stan-
ford dependency label. As a result, in our exper-
iments we resort to using only the coarse-grained
types: word adjacency, syntactic dependency, etc.
Next, we will consider a more fine-grained approach
by learning an edge-type embedding.

Edge-Type Embedding To reduce the number
of parameters and leverage potential correlation
among fine-grained edge types, we learned a low-
dimensional embedding of the edge types, and con-
ducted an outer product of the predecessor’s hidden
vector and the edge-type embedding to generate a
“typed hidden representation”, which is a matrix. The
new computation is as follows:

105



it = σ(Wixt +
∑

j∈P (t)
Ui ×T (hj ⊗ ej) + bi)

ftj = σ(Wfxt + Uf ×T (hj ⊗ ej) + bf )
ot = σ(Woxt +

∑
j∈P (t)

Uo ×T (hj ⊗ ej) + bo)

c̃t = tanh(Wcxt +
∑

j∈P (t)
Uc ×T (hj ⊗ ej) + bc)

ct = it � c̃t +
∑

j∈P (t)
ftj � cj

ht = ot � tanh(ct)

U ’s are now l × l × d tensors (l is the dimension of
the hidden vector and d is the dimension for edge-
type embedding), and hj ⊗ ej is a tensor product
that produces an l × d matrix. ×T denotes a tensor
dot product defined as T ×T A =

∑
d(T:,:,d · A:,d),

which produces an l-dimensional vector. The edge-
type embedding ej is jointly trained with the other
parameters.

3.4 Comparison with Prior LSTM Approaches

The main advantages of a graph formulation are its
generality and flexibility. As seen in Section 3.1,
linear-chain LSTMs are a special case when the doc-
ument graph is the linear chain of adjacent words.
Similarly, Tree LSTMs (Tai et al., 2015) are a special
case when the document graph is the parse tree.

In graph LSTMs, the encoding of linguistic knowl-
edge is factored from the backpropagation strategy
(Section 3.2), making it much more flexible, includ-
ing introducing cycles. For example, Miwa and
Bansal (2016) conducted joint entity and binary re-
lation extraction by stacking a LSTM for relation
extraction on top of another LSTM for entity recog-
nition. In graph LSTMs, the two can be combined
seamlessly using a document graph comprising both
the word-adjacency chain and the dependency path
between the two entities.

The document graph can also incorporate other
linguistic information. For example, coreference
and discourse parsing are intuitively relevant for
cross-sentence relation extraction. Although existing
systems have not yet been shown to improve cross-
sentence relation extraction (Quirk and Poon, 2017),
it remains an important future direction to explore
incorporating such analyses, especially after adapting
them to the biomedical domains (Bell et al., 2016).

3.5 Multi-task Learning with Sub-relations

Multi-task learning has been shown to be beneficial in
training neural networks (Caruana, 1998; Collobert
and Weston, 2008; Peng and Dredze, 2016). By
learning contextual entity representations, our frame-
work makes it straightforward to conduct multi-task
learning. The only change is to add a separate classi-
fier for each related auxiliary relation. All classifiers
share the same graph LSTMs representation learner
and word embeddings, and can potentially help each
other by pooling their supervision signals.

In the molecular tumor board domain, we applied
this paradigm to joint learning of both the ternary rela-
tion (drug-gene-mutation) and its binary sub-relation
(drug-mutation). Experiment results show that this
provides significant gains in both tasks.

4 Implementation Details

We implemented our methods using the Theano li-
brary (Theano Development Team, 2016). We used
logistic regression for our relation classifiers. Hyper
parameters were set based on preliminary experi-
ments on a small development dataset. Training was
done using mini-batched stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) with batch size 8. We used a learning rate of
0.02 and trained for at most 30 epochs, with early
stopping based on development data (Caruana et al.,
2001; Graves et al., 2013). The dimension for the
hidden vectors in LSTM units was set to 150, and the
dimension for the edge-type embedding was set to 3.
The word embeddings were initialized with the pub-
licly available 100-dimensional GloVe word vectors
trained on 6 billion words from Wikipedia and web
text3 (Pennington et al., 2014). Other model param-
eters were initialized with random samples drawn
uniformly from the range [−1, 1].

In multi-task training, we alternated among all
tasks, each time passing through all data for one
task4, and updating the parameters accordingly. This
was repeated for 30 epochs.

4However, drug-gene pairs have much more data, so we sub-

sampled the instances down to the same size as the main n-ary
relation task.

5 Domain: Molecular Tumor Boards

Our main experiments focus on extracting ternary
interactions over drugs, genes and mutations, which
is important for molecular tumor boards. A drug-
gene-mutation interaction is broadly construed as an
association between the drug efficacy and the muta-
tion in the given gene. There is no annotated dataset
for this problem. However, due to the importance of
such knowledge, oncologists have been painstakingly
curating known relations from reading papers. Such
a manual approach cannot keep up with the rapid
growth of the research literature, and the coverage is
generally sparse and not up to date. However, the cu-
rated knowledge can be used for distant supervision.

5.1 Datasets

We obtained biomedical literature from PubMed Cen-
tral5, consisting of approximately one million full-
text articles as of 2015. Note that only a fraction of
papers contain knowledge about drug-gene-mutation
interactions. Extracting such knowledge from the
vast body of biomedical papers is exactly the chal-
lenge. As we will see in later subsections, distant
supervision enables us to generate a sizable train-
ing set from a small number of manually curated
facts, and the learned model was able to extract or-
ders of magnitude more facts. In future work, we
will explore incorporating more known facts for dis-
tant supervision and extracting from more full-text
articles.

We conducted tokenization, part-of-speech tag-
ging, and syntactic parsing using SPLAT (Quirk et
al., 2012), and obtained Stanford dependencies (de
Marneffe et al., 2006) using Stanford CoreNLP (Man-
ning et al., 2014). We used the entity taggers from
Literome (Poon et al., 2014) to identify drug, gene
and mutation mentions.

We used the Gene Drug Knowledge Database
(GDKD) (Dienstmann et al., 2015) and the Clini-
cal Interpretations of Variants In Cancer (CIVIC)
knowledge base6 for distant supervision. The knowl-
edge bases distinguish fine-grained interaction types,
which we do not use in this paper.

5.2 Distant Supervision

After identifying drug, gene and mutation mentions
in the text, co-occurring triples with known interac-
tions were chosen as positive examples. However,
unlike the single-sentence setting in standard dis-
tant supervision, care must be taken in selecting the
candidates. Since the triples can reside in differ-
ent sentences, an unrestricted selection of text spans
would risk introducing many obviously wrong ex-
amples. We thus followed Quirk and Poon (2017)
in restricting the candidates to those occurring in a
minimal span, i.e., we retain a candidate only if is
no other co-occurrence of the same entities in an
overlapping text span with a smaller number of con-
secutive sentences. Furthermore, we avoid picking
unlikely candidates where the triples are far apart
in the document. Specifically, we considered en-
tity triples within K consecutive sentences, ignoring
paragraph boundaries. K = 1 corresponds to the
baseline of extraction within single sentences. We
explored K ≤ 3, which captured a large fraction of
candidates without introducing many unlikely ones.

Only 59 distinct drug-gene-mutation triples from
the knowledge bases were matched in the text. Even
from such a small set of unique triples, we obtained
3,462 ternary relation instances that can serve as pos-
itive examples. For multi-task learning, we also con-
sidered drug-gene and drug-mutation sub-relations,
which yielded 137,469 drug-gene and 3,192 drug-
mutation relation instances as positive examples.

We generate negative examples by randomly sam-
pling co-occurring entity triples without known inter-
actions, subject to the same restrictions above. We
sampled the same number as positive examples to
obtain a balanced dataset7.

5.3 Automatic Evaluation

To compare the various models in our proposed
framework, we conducted five-fold cross-validation,
treating the positive and negative examples from dis-
tant supervision as gold annotation. To avoid train-
test contamination, all examples from a document
were assigned to the same fold. Since our datasets
are balanced by construction, we simply report aver-
age test accuracy on held-out folds. Obviously, the

dependency path (Xu et al., 2015b; Miwa and Bansal,
2016).

results could be noisy (e.g., entity triples not known
to have an interaction might actually have one), but
this evaluation is automatic and can quickly evaluate
the impact of various design choices.

We evaluated two variants of graph LSTMs:
“Graph LSTM-FULL” with full parametrization and
“Graph LSTM-EMBED” with edge-type embedding.
We compared graph LSTMs with three strong base-
line systems: a well-engineered feature-based classi-
fier (Quirk and Poon, 2017), a convolutional neural
network (CNN) (Zeng et al., 2014; Santos et al.,
2015; Wang et al., 2016), and a bi-directional LSTM
(BiLSTM). Following Wang et al. (2016), we used in-
put attention for the CNN and a input window size of
5. Quirk and Poon (2017) only extracted binary rela-
tions. We extended it to ternary relations by deriving
features for each entity pair (with added annotation to
signify the two entity types), and pooling the features

from all pairs.
For binary relation extraction, prior syntax-aware

approaches are directly applicable. So we also
compared with a state-of-the-art tree LSTM system
(Miwa and Bansal, 2016) and a BiLSTM on the
shortest dependency path between the two entities
(BiLSTM-Shortest-Path) (Xu et al., 2015b).

Table 1 shows the results for cross-sentence,
ternary relation extraction. All neural-network based
models outperformed the feature-based classifier, il-
lustrating their advantage in handling sparse linguis-
tic patterns without requiring intense feature engi-
neering. All LSTMs significantly outperformed CNN
in the cross-sentence setting, verifying the impor-
tance in capturing long-distance dependencies.

The two variants of graph LSTMs perform on par
with each other, though Graph LSTM-FULL has a
small advantage, suggesting that further exploration
of parametrization schemes could be beneficial. In
particular, the edge-type embedding might improve
by pretraining on unlabeled text with syntactic parses.

Both graph variants significantly outperformed
BiLSTMs (p < 0.05 by McNemar’s chi-square test),
though the difference is small. This result is intrigu-
ing. In Quirk and Poon (2017), the best system in-
corporated syntactic dependencies and outperformed
the linear-chain variant (Base) by a large margin. So
why didn’t graph LSTMs make an equally substantial
gain by modeling syntactic dependencies?

One reason is that linear-chain LSTMs can already
captured some of the long-distance dependencies
available in syntactic parses. BiLSTMs substantially
outperformed the feature-based classifier, even with-
out explicit modeling of syntactic dependencies. The
gain cannot be entirely attributed to word embedding
as LSTMs also outperformed CNNs.

Another reason is that syntactic parsing is less
accurate in the biomedical domain. Parse errors con-
fuse the graph LSM learner, limiting the potential for
gain. In Section 6, we show supporting evidence in a
domain when gold parses are available.

We also reported accuracy on instances within
single sentences, which exhibited a broadly similar
set of trends. Note that single-sentence and cross-
sentence accuracies are not directly comparable, as
the test sets are different (one subsumes the other).

We conducted the same experiments on the binary
sub-relation between drug-mutation pairs. Table 2

shows the results, which are similar to the ternary
case: Graph LSTM-FULL consistently performed
the best for both single sentence and cross-sentence
instances. BiLSTMs on the shortest path substan-
tially underperformed BiLSTMs or graph LSTMs,
losing between 4-5 absolute points in accuracy, which
could be attributed to the lower parsing quality in the
biomedical domain. Interestingly, the state-of-the-art
tree LSTMs (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) also under-
performed graph LSTMs, even though they encoded
essentially the same linguistic structures (word adja-
cency and syntactic dependency). We attributed the
gain to the fact that Miwa and Bansal (2016) used
separate LSTMs for the linear chain and the depen-
dency tree, whereas graph LSTMs learned a single
representation for both.

To evaluate whether joint learning with sub-
relations can help, we conducted multi-task learning
using Graph LSTM-FULL to jointly train extractors
for both the ternary interaction and the drug-mutation,
drug-gene sub-relations. Table 3 shows the results.
Multi-task learning resulted in a significant gain for
both the ternary interaction and the drug-mutation
interaction. Interestingly, the advantage of graph
LSTMs over BiLSTMs is reduced with multi-task
learning, suggesting that with more supervision sig-
nal, even linear-chain LSTMs can learn to capture
long-range dependencies that are were made evident
by parse features in graph LSTMs. Note that there are
many more instances for drug-gene interaction than
others, so we only sampled a subset of comparable
size. Therefore, we do not evaluate the performance
gain for drug-gene interaction, as in practice, one
would simply learn from all available data, and the
sub-sampled results are not competitive.

We included coreference and discourse relations
in our document graph. However, we didn’t observe
any significant gains, similar to the observation in

to future work.

5.4 PubMed-Scale Extraction

Our ultimate goal is to extract all knowledge from
available text. We thus retrained our model using the
best system from automatic evaluation (i.e., Graph
LSTM-FULL) on all available data. The resulting
model was then used to extract relations from all
PubMed Central articles.

Table 4 shows the number of candidates and ex-
tracted interactions. With as little as 59 unique drug-
gene-mutation triples from the two databases8, we
learned to extract orders of magnitude more unique
interactions. The results also highlight the benefit of
cross-sentence extraction, which yields 3 to 5 times
more relations than single-sentence extraction.

Table 5 conducts a similar comparison on unique
number of drugs, genes, and mutations. Again, ma-
chine reading covers far more unique entities, espe-
cially with cross-sentence extraction.

5.5 Manual Evaluation

Our automatic evaluations are useful for comparing
competing approaches, but may not reflect the true
classifier precision as the labels are noisy. Therefore,
we randomly sampled extracted relation instances
and asked three researchers knowledgeable in pre-
cision medicine to evaluate their correctness. For
each instance, the annotators were presented with
the provenance: sentences with the drug, gene, and
mutation highlighted. The annotators determined in

8There are more in the databases, but these are the only ones
for which we found matching instances in the text. In future
work, we will explore various ways to increase the number, e.g.,
by matching underspecified drug classes to specific drugs.

each case whether this instance implied that the given
entities were related. Note that evaluation does not
attempt to identify whether the relationships are true
or replicated in follow-up papers; rather, it focuses
on whether the relationships are entailed by the text.

We focused our evaluation efforts on the cross-
sentence ternary-relation setting. We considered
three probability thresholds: 0.9 for a high-precision
but potentially low-recall setting, 0.5, and a random
sample of all candidates. In each case, 150 instances
were selected for a total of 450 annotations. A subset
of 150 instances were reviewed by two annotators,
and the inter-annotator agreement was 88%.

Table 6 shows that the classifier indeed filters out a
large portion of potential candidates, with estimated
instance accuracy of 64% at the threshold of 0.5, and
75% at 0.9. Interestingly, LSTMs are effective at
screening out many entity mention errors, presum-
ably because they include broad contextual features.

6 Domain: Genetic Pathways

We also conducted experiments on extracting genetic
pathway interactions using the GENIA Event Extrac-
tion dataset (Kim et al., 2009). This dataset contains
gold syntactic parses for the sentences, which offered
a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of syn-
tactic analysis on graph LSTMs. It also allowed us
to test our framework in supervised learning.

The original shared task evaluated on complex,
nested events for nine event types, many of which are
unary relations (Kim et al., 2009). Following Poon
et al. (2015), we focused on gene regulation and
reduced it to binary-relation classification for head-
to-head comparison. We followed their experimental
protocol by sub-sampling negative examples to be
about three times of positive examples.

Since the dataset is not entirely balanced, we re-
ported precision, recall, and F1. We used our best
performing graph LSTM from the previous experi-
ments. By default, automatic parses were used in the
document graphs, whereas in Graph LSTM (GOLD),
gold parses were used instead. Table 7 shows the re-
sults. Once again, despite the lack of intense feature
engineering, linear-chain LSTMs performed on par
with the feature-based classifier (Poon et al., 2015).
Graph LSTMs exhibited a more commanding advan-
tage over linear-chain LSTMs in this domain, sub-
stantially outperforming the latter (p < 0.01 by Mc-
Nemar’s chi-square test). Most interestingly, graph
LSTMs using gold parses significantly outperformed
that using automatic parses, suggesting that encoding
high-quality analysis is particularly beneficial.

7 Related Work

Most work on relation extraction has been applied to
binary relations of entities in a single sentence. We
first review relevant work on the single-sentence bi-

110



nary relation extraction task, and then review related
work on n-ary and cross-sentence relation extraction.

Binary relation extraction The traditional feature-
based methods rely on carefully designed features
to learn good models, and often integrate diverse
sources of evidence such as word sequences and syn-
tax context (Kambhatla, 2004; GuoDong et al., 2005;
Boschee et al., 2005; Suchanek et al., 2006; Chan
and Roth, 2010; Nguyen and Grishman, 2014). The
kernel-based methods design various subsequence or
tree kernels (Mooney and Bunescu, 2005; Bunescu
and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008) to capture struc-
tured information. Recently, models based on neural
networks have advanced the state of the art by auto-
matically learning powerful feature representations
(Xu et al., 2015a; Zhang et al., 2015; Santos et al.,
2015; Xu et al., 2015b; Xu et al., 2016).

Most neural architectures resemble Figure 2,
where there is a core representation learner (blue)
that takes word embeddings as input and produces
contextual entity representations. Such representa-
tions are then taken by relation classifiers to pro-
duce the final predictions. Effectively representing
sequences of words, both convolutional (Zeng et al.,
2014; Wang et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2015) and
RNN-based architectures (Zhang et al., 2015; Socher
et al., 2012; Cai et al., 2016) have been successful.
Most of these have focused on modeling either the
surface word sequences or the hierarchical syntac-
tic structure. Miwa and Bansal (2016) proposed an
architecture that benefits from both types of informa-
tion, using a surface sequence layer, followed by a
dependency-tree sequence layer.

N -ary relation extraction Early work on extract-
ing relations between more than two arguments has
been done in MUC-7, with a focus on fact/event
extraction from news articles (Chinchor, 1998). Se-
mantic role labeling in the Propbank (Palmer et al.,
2005) or FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) style are also
instances of n-ary relation extraction, with extrac-
tion of events expressed in a single sentence. Mc-
Donald et al. (2005) extract n-ary relations in a bio-
medical domain, by first factoring the n-ary relation
into pair-wise relations between all entity pairs, and
then constructing maximal cliques of related enti-
ties. Recently, neural models have been applied to
semantic role labeling (FitzGerald et al., 2015; Roth

and Lapata, 2016). These works learned neural rep-
resentations by effectively decomposing the n-ary
relation into binary relations between the predicate
and each argument, by embedding the dependency
path between each pair, or by combining features
of the two using a feed-forward network. Although
some re-ranking or joint inference models have been
employed, the representations of the individual argu-
ments do not influence each other. In contrast, we
propose a neural architecture that jointly represents
n entity mentions, taking into account long-distance
dependencies and inter-sentential information.

Cross-sentence relation extraction Several rela-
tion extraction tasks have benefited from cross-
sentence extraction, including MUC fact and event
extraction (Swampillai and Stevenson, 2011), record
extraction from web pages (Wick et al., 2006), extrac-
tion of facts for biomedical domains (Yoshikawa et
al., 2011), and extensions of semantic role labeling to
cover implicit inter-sentential arguments (Gerber and
Chai, 2010). These prior works have either relied on
explicit co-reference annotation, or on the assump-
tion that the whole document refers to a single co-
herent event, to simplify the problem and reduce the
need for powerful representations of multi-sentential
contexts of entity mentions. Recently, cross-sentence
relation extraction models have been learned with
distant supervision, and used integrated contextual
evidence of diverse types without reliance on these
assumptions (Quirk and Poon, 2017), but that work
focused on binary relations only and explicitly engi-
neered sparse indicator features.

Relation extraction using distant supervision
Distant supervision has been applied to extraction
of binary (Mintz et al., 2009; Poon et al., 2015) and
n-ary (Reschke et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015) relations,
traditionally using hand-engineered features. Neural
architectures have recently been applied to distantly
supervised extraction of binary relations (Zeng et al.,
2015). Our work is the first to propose a neural archi-
tecture for n-ary relation extraction, where the repre-
sentation of a tuple of entities is not decomposable
into independent representations of the individual
entities or entity pairs, and which integrates diverse
information from multi-sentential context. To utilize
training data more effectively, we show how multi-
task learning for component binary sub-relations can

111



improve performance. Our learned representation
combines information sources within a single sen-
tence in a more integrated and generalizable fashion
than prior approaches, and can also improve perfor-
mance on single-sentence binary relation extraction.

8 Conclusion

We explore a general framework for cross-sentence n-
ary relation extraction based on graph LSTMs. The
graph formulation subsumes linear-chain and tree
LSTMs and makes it easy to incorporate rich linguis-
tic analysis. Experiments on biomedical domains
showed that extraction beyond the sentence bound-
ary produced far more knowledge, and encoding rich
linguistic knowledge provided consistent gain.

While there is much room to improve in both recall
and precision, our results indicate that machine read-
ing can already be useful in precision medicine. In
particular, automatically extracted facts (Section 5.4)
can serve as candidates for manual curation. Instead
of scanning millions of articles to curate from scratch,
human curators would just quickly vet thousands of
extractions. The errors identified by curators offer
direct supervision to the machine reading system for
continuous improvement. Therefore, the most im-
portant goal is to attain high recall and reasonable
precision. Our current models are already quite capa-
ble.

Future directions include: interactive learning
with user feedback; improving discourse modeling
in graph LSTMs; exploring other backpropagation
strategies; joint learning with entity linking; applica-
tions to other domains.
