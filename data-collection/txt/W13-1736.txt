Abstract

We show that it is possible to learn to identify, with
high accuracy, the native language of English test
takers from the content of the essays they write.
Our method uses standard text classification tech-
niques based on multiclass logistic regression, com-
bining individually weak indicators to predict the
most probable native language from a set of 11 pos-
sibilities. We describe the various features used for
classification, as well as the settings of the classifier
that yielded the highest accuracy.

1 Introduction

The task we address in this work is identifying the
native language (L1) of non-native English (L2) au-
thors. More specifically, given a dataset of short
English essays (Blanchard et al., 2013), composed
as part of the Test of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage (TOEFL) by authors whose native language is
one out of 11 possible languages—Arabic, Chinese,
French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish, Telugu, or Turkish—our task is to identify
that language.

This task has a clear empirical motivation. Non-
native speakers make different errors when they
write English, depending on their native language
(Lado, 1957; Swan and Smith, 2001); understand-
ing the different types of errors is a prerequisite for
correcting them (Leacock et al., 2010), and systems
such as the one we describe here can shed interest-
ing light on such errors. Tutoring applications can
use our system to identify the native language of
students and offer better-targeted advice. Forensic

linguistic applications are sometimes required to de-
termine the L1 of authors (Estival et al., 2007b; Es-
tival et al., 2007a). Additionally, we believe that the
task is interesting in and of itself, providing a bet-
ter understanding of non-native language. We are
thus equally interested in defining meaningful fea-
tures whose contribution to the task can be linguis-
tically interpreted. Briefly, our features draw heav-
ily on prior work in general text classification and
authorship identification, those used in identifying
so-called translationese (Volansky et al., forthcom-
ing), and a class of features that involves determin-
ing what minimal changes would be necessary to
transform the essays into “standard” English (as de-
termined by an n-gram language model).

We address the task as a multiway text-
classification task; we describe our data in §3 and
classification model in §4. As in other author attri-
bution tasks (Juola, 2006), the choice of features for
the classifier is crucial; we discuss the features we
define in §5. We report our results in §6 and con-
clude with suggestions for future research.

2 Related work

The task of L1 identification was introduced by Kop-
pel et al. (2005a; 2005b), who work on the Inter-
national Corpus of Learner English (Granger et al.,
2009), which includes texts written by students from
5 countries, Russia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria,
France, and Spain. The texts range from 500 to
850 words in length. Their classification method
is a linear SVM, and features include 400 standard
function words, 200 letter n-grams, 185 error types
and 250 rare part-of-speech (POS) bigrams. Ten-

279



fold cross-validation results on this dataset are 80%
accuracy.

The same experimental setup is assumed by Tsur
and Rappoport (2007), who are mostly interested
in testing the hypothesis that an author’s choice of
words in a second language is influenced by the
phonology of his or her L1. They confirm this hy-
pothesis by carefully analyzing the features used by
Koppel et al., controlling for potential biases.

Wong and Dras (2009; 2011) are also motivated
by a linguistic hypothesis, namely that syntactic er-
rors in a text are influenced by the author’s L1.
Wong and Dras (2009) analyze three error types sta-
tistically, and then add them as features in the same
experimental setup as above (using LIBSVM with a
radial kernel for classification). The error types are
subject-verb disagreement, noun-number disagree-
ment and misuse of determiners. Addition of these
features does not improve on the results of Kop-
pel et al.. Wong and Dras (2011) further extend
this work by adding as features horizontal slices of
parse trees, thereby capturing more syntactic struc-
ture. This improves the results significantly, yielding
78% accuracy compared with less than 65% using
only lexical features.

Kochmar (2011) uses a different corpus, the Cam-
bridge Learner Corpus, in which texts are 200-400
word long, and are authored by native speakers of
five Germanic languages (German, Swiss German,
Dutch, Swedish and Danish) and five Romance lan-
guages (French, Italian, Catalan, Spanish and Por-
tuguese). Again, SVMs are used as the classification
device. Features include POS n-grams, character n-
grams, phrase-structure rules (extracted from parse
trees), and two measures of error rate. The classi-
fier is evaluated on its ability to distinguish between
pairs of closely-related L1s, and the results are usu-
ally excellent.

A completely different approach is offered by
Brooke and Hirst (2011). Since training corpora for
this task are rare, they use mainly L1 (blog) cor-
pora. Given English word bigrams 〈e1, e2〉, they try
to assess, for each L1, how likely it is that an L1 bi-
gram was translated literally by the author, resulting
in 〈e1, e2〉. Working with four L1s (French, Span-
ish, Chinese, and Japanese), and evaluating on the
International Corpus of Learner English, accuracy is
below 50%.

3 Data

Our dataset in this work consists of TOEFL essays
written by speakers of eleven different L1s (Blan-
chard et al., 2013), distributed as part of the Na-
tive Language Identification Shared Task (Tetreault
et al., 2013). The training data consists of 1000
essays from each native language. The essays are
short, consisting of 10 to 20 sentences each. We
used the provided splits of 900 documents for train-
ing and 100 for development. Each document is an-
notated with the author’s English proficiency level
(low, medium, high) and an identification (1 to 8) of
the essay prompt. All essays are tokenized and split
into sentences. In table 1 we provide some statistics
on the training corpora, listed by the authors’ profi-
ciency level. All essays were tagged with the Stan-
ford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
We did not parse the dataset.

4 Model

For our classification model we used the creg re-
gression modeling framework to train a 11-class lo-
gistic regression classifier.1 We parameterize the
classifier as a multiclass logistic regression:

pλ(y | x) =
exp

∑
j λ jh j(x, y)
Zλ(x)

,

where x are documents, h j(·) are real-valued feature
functions of the document being classified, λ j are the
corresponding weights, and y is one of the eleven L1
class labels. To train the parameters of our model,
we minimized the following objective,

L = α

`2 reg.︷︸︸︷∑
j

λ2j −
∑

{(xi,yi)}|D|i=1

which combines the negative log likelihood of the
training dataset D, an `2 (quadratic) penalty on the
magnitude of λ (weighted by α), and the negative en-
tropy of the predictive model (weighted by τ). While
an `2 weight penalty is standard in regression prob-
lems like this, we found that the the additional en-
tropy term gave more reliable results. Intuitively,
the entropic regularizer encourages the model to re-
main maximally uncertain about its predictions. In
the metaphor of “maximum entropy”, the entropic
prior finds a solution that has more entropy than the
“maximum” model that is compatible with the con-
straints.

The objective cannot be minimized in closed
form, but it does have a unique minimum and
is straightforwardly differentiable, so we used L-
BFGS to find the optimal weight settings (Liu et al.,
1989).

5 Feature Overview

We define a large arsenal of features, our motivation
being both to improve the accuracy of classification
and to be able to interpret the characteristics of the
language produced by speakers of different L1s.

While some of the features were used in prior
work (§2), we focus on two broad novel categories
of features: those inspired by the features used
to identify translationese by Volansky et al. (forth-
coming) and those extracted by automatic statisti-
cal “correction” of the essays. Refer to figure 1 to
see the set of features and their values that were ex-
tracted from an example sentence.
POS n-grams Part-of-speech n-grams were used in

various text-classification tasks.
Prompt Since the prompt contributes information

on the domain, it is likely that some words (and,
hence, character sequences) will occur more fre-
quently with some prompts than with others. We
therefore use the prompt ID in conjunction with
other features.

Document length The number of tokens in the text
is highly correlated with the author’s level of flu-
ency, which in turn is correlated with the author’s
L1.

Pronouns The use of pronouns varies greatly
among different authors. We use the same list
of 25 English pronouns that Volansky et al. (forth-

coming) use for identifying translationese.
Punctuation Similarly, different languages use

punctuation differently, and we expect this to taint
the use of punctuation in non-native texts. Of
course, character n-grams subsume this feature.

Passives English uses passive voice more fre-
quently than other languages. Again, the use of
passives in L2 can be correlated with the author’s
L1.

Positional token frequency The choice of the first
and last few words in a sentence is highly con-
strained, and may be significantly influenced by
the author’s L1.

Cohesive markers These are 40 function words
(and short phrases) that have a strong discourse
function in texts (however, because, in fact,
etc.). Translators tend to spell out implicit utter-
ances and render them explicitly in the target text
(Blum-Kulka, 1986). We use the list of Volansky
et al. (forthcoming).

Cohesive verbs This is a list of manually compiled
verbs that are used, like cohesive markers, to spell
out implicit utterances (indicate, imply, contain,
etc.).

Function words Frequent tokens, which are mostly
function words, have been used successfully for
various text classification tasks. Koppel and Or-
dan (2011) define a list of 400 such words, of
which we only use 100 (using the entire list was
not significantly different). Note that pronouns
are included in this list.

Contextual function words To further capitalize
on the ability of function words to discriminate,
we define pairs consisting of a function word from
the list mentioned above, along with the POS tag
of its adjacent word. This feature captures pat-
terns such as verbs and the preposition or particle
immediately to their right, or nouns and the deter-
miner that precedes them. We also define 3-grams
consisting of one or two function words and the
POS tag of the third word in the 3-gram.

Lemmas The content of the text is not considered a
good indication of the author’s L1, but many text
categorization tasks use lemmas (more precisely,
the stems produced by the tagger) as features ap-
proximating the content.

Misspelling features Learning to perceive, pro-
duce, and encode non-native phonemic contrasts

is extremely difficult for L2 learners (Hayes-Harb
and Masuda, 2008). Since English’s orthogra-
phy is largely phonemic—even if it is irregular
in many places, we expect leaners whose na-
tive phoneme contrasts are different from those
of English to make characteristic spelling errors.
For example, since Japanese and Korean lack a
phonemic /l/-/r/ contrast, we expect native speak-
ers of those languages to be more likely to make
spelling errors that confuse l and r relative to
native speakers of languages such as Spanish in
which that pair is contrastive. To make this in-
formation available to our model, we use a noisy
channel spelling corrector (Kernighan, 1990) to
identify and correct misspelled words in the train-
ing and test data. From these corrections, we ex-
tract minimal edit features that show what inser-
tions, deletions, substitutions and joinings (where
two separate words are written merged into a sin-
gle orthographic token) were made by the author
of the essay.

Restored tags We focus on three important token
classes defined above: punctuation marks, func-
tion words and cohesive verbs. We first remove
words in these classes from the texts, and then
recover the most likely hidden tokens in a se-
quence of words, according to an n-gram lan-
guage model trained on all essays in the training
corpus corrected with a spell checker and con-
taining both words and hidden tokens. This fea-
ture should capture specific words or punctuation

marks that are consistently omitted (deletions),
or misused (insertions, substitutions). To restore
hidden tokens we use the hidden-ngram util-
ity provided in SRI’s language modeling toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002).

Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) describe an al-
gorithm that induces a hierarchical clustering of
a language’s vocabulary based on each vocabu-
lary item’s tendency to appear in similar left and
right contexts in a training corpus. While origi-
nally developed to reduce the number of parame-
ters required in n-gram language models, Brown
clusters have been found to be extremely effective
as lexical representations in a variety of regres-
sion problems that condition on text (Koo et al.,
2008; Turian et al., 2010; Owoputi et al., 2013).
Using an open-source implementation of the al-
gorithm,2 we clustered 8 billion words of English
into 600 classes.3 We included log counts of all
4-grams of Brown clusters that occurred at least
100 times in the NLI training data.

5.1 Main Features

We use the following four feature types as the base-
line features in our model. For features that are sen-
sitive to frequency, we use the log of the (frequency-
plus-one) as the feature’s value. Table 2 reports the
accuracy of using each feature type in isolation (with

number of parameters, we removed features only

5.2 Additional Features

To the basic set of features we now add more spe-
cific, linguistically-motivated features, each adding
a small number of parameters to the model. As
above, we indicate the accuracy of each feature type
in isolation.

4For experiments in this paper combining multiple types of
features, we used Jonathan Clark’s workflow management tool,
ducttape (https://github.com/jhclark/ducttape).

Table 3: Dev set accuracy with main feature groups,
added cumulatively. The number of parameters is always
a multiple of 11 (the number of classes). Only `2 regular-
ization was used for these experiments; the penalty was
tuned on the dev set as well.

DocLen Document length in tokens.
Punct Counts of each punctuation mark.
Pron Counts of each pronoun.
Position Positional token frequency. We use the

counts for the first two and last three words be-
fore the period in each sentence as features. High-
weight features for the second word include:
ARA:2<,>; CHI:2<is>; HIN:2<can>.

PsvRatio The proportion of passive verbs out of all
verbs.

CxtFxn Contextual function words. High-weight
features include: CHI:<some JJ>;
HIN:<as VBN>.

Misspell Spelling correction edits. Features
included substitutions, deletions, insertions,
doubling of letters and missing doublings of
letters, and splittings (alot→a lot), as well as the
word position where the error occurred.
High-weight features include: ARA:DEL<e>,
ARA:INS<e>, ARA:SUBST<e>/<i>;
GER:SUBST<z>/<y>; JPN:SUBST<l>/<r>,
JPN:SUBST<r>/<l>; SPA:DOUBLE<s>,
SPA:MID_INS<s>, SPA:INS<s>.

Restore Counts of substitutions, deletions and
insertions of predefined tokens that we restored
in the texts. High-weight features include:
CHI:DELWORD<do>; GER:DELWORD<on>;
ITA:DELWORD<be>

Table 4 reports the empirical improvement that each
of these brings independently when added to the
main features (§5.1).

5.3 Discarded Features

We also tried several other feature types that did not
improve the accuracy of the classifier on the devel-
opment set.
CohMark Counts of each cohesive marker.

tional feature groups, added independently. `2 regulariza-
tion was tuned as in table 3 (two values, 1.0 and 5.0, were
tried for each configuration; more careful tuning might
produce slightly better accuracy). Results are sorted by
accuracy; only three groups exhibited independent im-
provements over the main feature set.

CohVerb Counts of each cohesive verb.
FxnWord Counts of function words. These features

are subsumed by the highly discriminative CxtFxn
features.

6 Results

The full model that we used to classify the test set
combines all features listed in table 4. Using all
these features, the accuracy on the development set
is 84.55%, and on the test set it is 81.5%. The values
for α and τ were tuned to optimize development set
performance, and found to be α = 5, τ = 2.

Table 5 lists the confusion matrix on the test set,
as well as precision, recall and F1-score for each L1.
The largest error type involved predicting Telugu
when the true label was Hindi, which happened 18
times. This error is unsurprising since many Hindi
and Telugu speakers are arguably native speakers of
Indian English.

Production of L2 texts, not unlike translating from
L1 to L2, involves a tension between the impos-
ing models of L1 (and the source text), on the one
hand, and a set of cognitive constraints resulting
from the efforts to generate the target text, on the
other. The former is called interference in Trans-
lation Studies (Toury, 1995) and transfer in second
language acquisition (Selinker, 1972). Volansky et
al. (forthcoming) designed 32 classifiers to test the
validity of the forces acting on translated texts, and
found that features sensitive to interference consis-

tently yielded the best performing classifiers. And
indeed, in this work too, we find fingerprints of the
source language are dominant in the makeup of L2
texts. The main difference, however, between texts
translated by professionals and the texts we address
here, is that more often than not professional trans-
lators translate into their mother tongue, whereas L2
writers write out of their mother tongue by defini-
tion. So interference is ever more exaggerated in
this case, for example, also phonologically (Tsur and
Rappoport, 2007).

We explore the effects of interference by analyz-
ing several patterns we observe in the features. Our
classifier finds that the character sequence alot is
overrepresented in Arabic L2 texts. Arabic has no
indefinite article and we speculate that Arabic speak-
ers conceive a lot as a single word; the Arabic equiv-
alent for a lot is used adverbially like an -ly suffix
in English. For the same reason, another promi-
nent feature is a missing definite article before nouns
and adjectives. Additionally, Arabic, being an Ab-
jad language, rarely indicates vowels, and indeed we
find many missing e’s and i’s in the texts of Arabic
speakers. Phonologically, because Arabic conflates
/I/ and /@/ into /i/ (at least in Modern Standard Ara-
bic), we see that many e’s are indeed substituted for
i’s in these texts.

We find that essays that contain hyphens are more
likely to be from German authors. We again find
evidence of interference from the native language
here. First, relative clauses are widely used in Ger-
man, and we see this pattern in L2 English of L1
German speakers. For example, any given rational
being – let us say Immanual Kant – we find that.
Another source of extra hyphens stems from com-
pounding convention. So, for example, we find well-
known, community-help, spare-time, football-club,
etc. Many of these reflect an effort to both connect
and separate connected forms in the original (e.g.,
Fussballklub, which in English would be more natu-
rally rendered as football club). Another unexpected
feature of essays by native Germans is a frequent
substitution of the letter y for z and vice versa. We
suspect this owes to their switched positions on Ger-
man keyboards.

Lexical item frequency also provides clues to the
L1 of the essay writers. The word that occurs more
frequently in the texts of German L1 speakers. We

hypothesize that in English it is optional in rela-
tive clauses whereas in German it is not, so Ger-
man speakers are less comfortable using the non-
obligatory form. Also, often is over represented. We
hypothesize that since it is cognate of German oft, it
is not cognitively expensive to retrieve it. We find
many times—a literal translation of muchas veces—
in Spanish essays.

Other informative features that reflect L1 features
include frequent misspellings involving confusions
of l and r in Japanese essays. More mysteriously,
the characters r and s are misused in Chinese and
Spanish, respectively. The word then is dominant
in the texts of Hindi speakers. Finally, it is clear
that authors refer to their native cultures (and, conse-
quently, native languages and countries); the strings
Turkish, Korea, and Ita were dominant in the texts of
Turkish, Korean and Italian native speakers, respec-
tively.

7 Discussion

We experimented with different classifiers and a
large set of features to solve an 11-way classifica-
tion problem. We hope that studying this problem
will improve to facilitate human assessment, grad-
ing, and teaching of English as a second language.
While the core features used are sparse and sensitive
to lexical and even orthographic features of the writ-
ing, many of them are linguistically informed and
provide insight into how L1 and L2 interact.

Our point of departure was the analogy between
translated texts as a genre in its own and L2 writ-
ers as pseudo translators, relying heavily on their
mother tongue and transferring their native models

to a second language. In formulating our features,
we assumed that like translators, L2 writers will
write in a simplified manner and overuse explicit
markers. Although this should be studied vis-à-vis
comparable outputs of mother tongue writers in En-
glish, we observe that the best features of our clas-
sifiers are of the “interference” type, i.e. phonolog-
ical, morphological and syntactic in nature, mostly
in the form of misspelling features, restoration tags,
punctuation and lexical and syntactic modeling.

We would like to stress that certain features indi-
cating a particular L1 have no bearing on the quality
of the English produced. This has been discussed
extensively in Translation Studies (Toury, 1995),
where interference is observed by the overuse or un-
deruse of certain features reflecting the typological
differences between a specific pair of languages, but
which is still within grammatical limits. For exam-
ple, the fact that Italian native speakers favor the
syntactic sequence of determiner + adjective + noun
(e.g., a big risk or this new business) has little pre-
scriptive value for teachers.

A further example of how L2 quality and the
ability to predict L1 are uncorrelated, we noted
that certain L2 writers often repeat words appear-
ing in their essay prompts, and including informa-
tion about whether the writer was reusing prompt
words improved classification accuracy. We suggest
this reflects different educational backgrounds. This
feature says nothing about the quality of the text, just
as the tendency of Korean and Italian writers to men-
tion their home country more often does not.
