Abstract 

This study focuses on modeling discourse co-
herence in the context of automated assess-
ment of spontaneous speech from non-native 
speakers. Discourse coherence has always 
been used as a key metric in human scoring 
rubrics for various assessments of spoken lan-
guage. However, very little research has been 
done to assess a speaker's coherence in auto-
mated speech scoring systems. To address 
this, we present a corpus of spoken responses 
that has been annotated for discourse coher-
ence quality. Then, we investigate the use of 
several features originally developed for es-
says to model coherence in spoken responses. 
An analysis on the annotated corpus shows 
that the prediction accuracy for human holistic 
scores of an automated speech scoring system 
can be improved by around 10% relative after 
the addition of the coherence features.  Fur-
ther experiments indicate that a weighted F-
Measure of 73% can be achieved for the au-
tomated prediction of the coherence scores. 

1 Introduction 

In recent years, much research has been conducted 
into developing automated assessment systems to 
automatically score spontaneous speech from non-
native speakers with the goals of reducing the bur-
den on human raters, improving reliability, and 
generating feedback that can be used by language 
learners. Various features related to different as-
pects of speaking proficiency have been exploited, 
such as delivery features for pronunciation, proso-
dy, and fluency (Strik and Cucchiarini, 1999; Chen 
et al., 2009; Cheng, 2011; Higgins et al., 2011), as 

well as language use features for vocabulary and 
grammar, and content features (Chen and Zechner, 
2011; Xie et al., 2012). However, discourse-level 
features related to topic development have rarely 
been investigated in the context of automated 
speech scoring. This is despite the fact that an im-
portant criterion in the human scoring rubrics for 
speaking assessments is the evaluation of coher-
ence, which refers to the conceptual relations be-
tween different units within a response. 

Methods for automatically assessing discourse 
coherence in text documents have been widely 
studied in the context of applications such as natu-
ral language generation, document summarization, 
and assessment of text readability. For example, 
Foltz et al. (1998) measured the overall coherence 
of a text by utilizing Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA) to calculate the semantic relatedness be-
tween adjacent sentences. Barzilay and Lee (2004) 
introduced an HMM-based model for the docu-
ment-level analysis of topics and topic transitions. 
Barzilay and Lapata (2005; 2008) presented an 
approach to coherence modeling which focused on 
the entities in the text and their grammatical transi-
tions between adjacent sentences, and calculated 
the entity transition probabilities on the document 
level. Pitler et al. (2010) provided a summary of 
the performance of several different types of 
features for automated coherence evaluation, such 
as cohesive devices, adjacent sentence similarity, 
Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004), word co-
occurrence patterns, and entity-grid. 

In addition to studies on well-formed text, re-
searchers have also addressed coherence modeling 
on text produced by language learners, which may 
contain many spelling and grammar errors.  
Utilizing LSA and Random Indexing methods, 
Higgins et al. (2004) measured the global 

814



coherence of students’ essays by calculating the 
semantic relatedness between sentences and the 
corresponding prompts. In addition, Burstein et. al 
(2010) combined entity-grid features with writing 
quality features produced by an automated assess-
ment system of essays to predict the coherence 
scores of student essays. Recently, Yannakoudakis 
and Briscoe (2012) systematically analyzed a vari-
ety of coherence modeling methods within the 
framework of an automated assessment system for 
non-native free text responses and indicated that 
features based on Incremental Semantic Analysis 
(ISA), local histograms of words, the part-of-
speech IBM model, and word length were the most 
effective.   

In contrast to these previous studies involving 
well-formed text or learner text containing errors, 
this paper focuses on modeling coherence in spon-
taneous spoken responses as well as investigating 
discourse features in an attempt to extend the con-
struct coverage of an automated speech scoring 
system. In a related study, Hassanali et al. (2012) 
investigated coherence modeling for spoken lan-
guage in the context of a story retelling task for the 
automated diagnosis of children with language im-
pairment. They annotated transcriptions of chil-
dren's narratives with coherence scores as well as 
markers of narrative structure and narrative quali-
ty; furthermore they built models to predict the 
coherence scores based on Coh-Metrix features 
and the manually annotated narrative features. The 
current study differs from this one in that it deals 
with free spontaneous spoken responses provided 
by students at a university level; these responses 
therefore contain more varied and more complicat-
ed information than the child narratives. 

The main contributions of this paper can be 
summarized as follows: First, we obtained coher-
ence annotations on a corpus of spontaneous spo-
ken responses drawn from a university-level 
English language proficiency assessment, and 
demonstrated an improvement of around 10% rela-
tive in the accuracy of the automated prediction of 
human holistic scores with the addition of the co-
herence annotations. Second, we applied the entity-
grid features and writing quality features from an 
automated essay scoring system to predict the co-
herence scores; the experimental results have 
shown promising correlations between some of 
these features and the coherence scores.  

2 Data and Annotation 

2.1 Data 

For this study, we collected 600 spoken responses 
from the international TOEFL® iBT assessment of 
English proficiency for non-native speakers. 100 
responses were drawn from each of 6 different test 
questions comprising two different speaking tasks: 
1) providing an opinion based on personal experi-
ence (N = 200) and 2) summarizing or discussing 
material provided in a reading and/or listening pas-
sage (N = 400). The spoken responses were all 
transcribed by humans with punctuation and capi-
talization. The average number of words contained 
in the responses was 104.4 (st. dev. = 34.4) and the 
average number of sentences was 5.5 (st. dev. = 
2.1).  

The spoken responses were all provided with 
holistic English proficiency scores on a scale of 1 - 
4 by expert human raters in the context of opera-
tional, high-stakes scoring for the spoken language 
assessment. The scoring rubrics address the fol-
lowing three main aspects of speaking proficiency: 
delivery (pronunciation, fluency, prosody), lan-
guage use (grammar and lexical choice), and topic 
development (content and coherence). In order to 
ensure a sufficient quantity of responses from each 
proficiency level for training and evaluating the 
coherence prediction features, the spoken respons-
es selected for this study were balanced based on 
the human scores as follows: 25 responses were 
selected randomly from each of the 4 score points 
(1 - 4) for each of the 6 test questions. In some 
cases, more than one response was selected from a 
given test-taker; in total, 471 distinct test-takers are 
represented in the data set. 

2.2 Annotation and Analysis 

The coherence annotation guidelines used for the 
spoken responses in this study were modified 
based on the annotation guidelines developed for 
written essays described in Burstein et al. (2010). 
According to these guidelines, expert annotators 
provided each response with a score on a scale of 1 
- 3. The three score points were defined as follows: 
3 = highly coherent (contains no instances of con-
fusing arguments or examples), 2 = somewhat co-
herent (contains some awkward points in which the 
speaker's line of argument is unclear), 1 = barely 

815



coherent (the entire response was confusing and 
hard to follow; it was intuitively incoherent as a 
whole and the annotators had difficulties in identi-
fying specific weak points). For responses receiv-
ing a coherence score of 2, the annotators were 
required to highlight the specific awkward points 
in the response. In addition, the annotators were 
specifically required to ignore disfluencies and 
grammatical errors as much as possible; thus, they 
were instructed to not label sentences or clauses as 
awkward points solely because of the presence of 
disfluent or ungrammatical speech.  

Two annotators (not drawn from the pool of ex-
pert human raters who provided the holistic scores) 
made independent coherence annotations for all 
600 spoken responses. The distribution of annota-
tions across the three score points is presented in 
Table 1. The two annotators achieved a moderate 
inter-annotator agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977) 
of κ = 0.68 on the 3-point scale. The average of the 
two coherence scores provided by the two annota-
tors correlates with the holistic speaking proficien-
cy scores at r = 0.66, indicating that the overall 
proficiency scores of spoken responses can benefit 
from the discourse coherence annotations.

Furthermore, coherence features based on the 
human annotations were examined within the con-
text of an automated spoken language assessment 
system, SpeechRaterSM (Zechner et al., 2007; 
2009). We extracted 96 features related to pronun-
ciation, prosody, fluency, language use, and con-
tent development using SpeechRater. These 
features were either extracted directly from the 
speech signal or were based on the output of an 
automatic speech recognition system (with a word 
error rate of around 28%1

speech recognizer consist of similar spoken responses drawn 
from the same assessment. However, there is no response 
overlap between these sets and the corpus used for discourse 
coherence annotation in this study. 

). By utilizing a decision 
tree classifier (the J48 implementation from Weka 
(Hall et al., 2009)), 4-fold cross validation was 

conducted on the 600 responses to train and evalu-
ate a scoring model for predicting the holistic pro-
ficiency scores. The resulting correlation between 
the predicted scores (based on the 96 baseline 
SpeechRater features) and the human holistic pro-
ficiency scores was r = 0.667.  

In order to model a spoken response's coher-
ence, three different features were extracted from 
the human annotations. Firstly, the average of the 
two annotators’ coherence scores was directly used 
as a feature with a 5-point scale (henceforth 
Coh_5). Secondly, following the work in Burstein 
et al. (2010), we collapsed the average coherence 
scores into a 2-point scale to deal with the 
difficulty in distinguishing somewhat and highly 
coherent responses. For this second feature 
(henceforth Coh_2), scores 1 and 1.5 were mapped 
to score 1, and scores 2, 2.5, and 3 were mapped to 
score 2. Finally, the number of awkward points 
was also counted as a feature (henceforth Awk). 
As shown in Table 2, when these three coherence 
features were combined separately with the 
SpeechRater features, the correlations could be 
improved from r = 0.667 to r > 0.7. Meanwhile, 
the accuracy (i.e., the percentage of correctly pre-
dicted holistic scores) could be improved from 
0.487 to a range between 0.535 and 0.543.

SpeechRater 0.667 0.487 
SpeechRater+Coh_5 0.714 0.540 
SpeechRater+Coh_2 0.705 0.543 
SpeechRater+Awk 0.702 0.535 

SpeechRater+Coh_5+Awk 0.703 0.537 
SpeechRater+Coh_2+Awk 0.701 0.542

system after the addition of human-assigned coherence 
scores and measures, showing both Pearson r correla-
tions and the ratio of correctly matched holistic scores 
between the system and human experts 

 
These experimental results demonstrate that the 

automatic scoring system can benefit from coher-
ence modeling either by directly using a human-
assigned coherence score or the identified awk-
ward points. However, the use of both kinds of 
annotations does not provide further improvement. 
When collapsing the average scores into a 2-point 
scale, there was a 0.009 correlation drop (not sta-
tistically significant), but the accuracy was slightly 
improved. In addition, due to the relatively small 

816



size of the set of available coherence annotations, 
we adopted the collapsed 2-point scale instead of 
the 5-point scale for the coherence prediction ex-
periments in the next section.  

2.3 Experimental Design 

As demonstrated in Section 2.2, the collapsed av-
erage coherence score can be used to improve the 
performance of an automated speech scoring sys-
tem. Therefore, this study treats coherence predic-
tion as a binary classification task: low-coherent 
vs. high-coherent, where the low-coherent re-
sponses are those with average scores 1 and 1.5, 
and the high-coherent responses are those with av-
erage scores 2, 2.5, and 3.  

For coherence modeling, we again use the J48 
decision tree from the Weka machine learning 
toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) and run 4-fold cross-
validation on the 600 annotated responses. The 
correlation coefficient (r) and the weighted aver-
age F-Measure2

In this experiment, we examine the performance 
of the entity-grid features and a set of features pro-
duced by the e-rater® system (an automated writ-
ing assessment system for learner essays) (Attali 
and Burstein, 2006) to predict the coherence scores 
of the spontaneous spoken responses, where all the 
features are extracted from human transcriptions of 
the responses.  

 are used as evaluation metrics.  

2.4 Entity Grid and e-rater Features 

First, we applied the algorithm from Barzilay and 
Lapata (2008) to extract entity-grid features, which 
calculated the vector of entity transition probabili-
ties across adjacent sentences.  Several different 
methods of representing the entities can be used 
before generating the entity-grid. First, all the enti-
ties can be described by their syntactic roles in-
cluding S (Subject), O (Object), and X (Other). 
Alternatively, these roles can also be reduced to P 
(Present) or N (Absent). Furthermore, entities can 
be defined as salient, when they appear two or 
more times, otherwise as non-salient. In this study, 
                                                           
2 The data distribution in the experimental corpus is unbal-
anced:  71% of the responses are high-coherent and 29% are 
low-coherent. Therefore, we adopt the weighted average F-
Measure to evaluate the performance of coherence prediction: 
first, the F1-Measure of each category is calculated, and then 
the percentages of responses in each category are used as 
weights to obtain the final weighted average F-Measure. 

we generated there basic entity grids: EG_SOX 
(entity grid with the syntactic roles S, O, and X), 
EG_REDUCED (entity grid with the reduced rep-
resentations P and N), and EG_SALIENT (entity 
grid with salient and non-salient entities). In addi-
tion to these entity-grid features, we also used 130 
writing quality features related to grammar, usage, 
mechanics, and style from e-rater to model the co-
herence. 

A baseline system for this task would simply as-
sign the majority class (high-coherent) to all of the 
responses; this baseline achieves an F-Measure of 
0.587. Table 3 shows that the EG_REDUCED and 
e-rater features can obtain F-Measures of 0.677 
and 0.726 as well as correlations with human 
scores of 0.20 and 0.33, respectively. However, the 
combination of the two sets of features only brings 
a very small improvement (from 0.33 to 0.34). In 
addition, our experiments show that by introducing 
the component of co-reference resolution for entity 
grid building, we can only get a very slight im-
provement on EG_SALIENT, but no improvement 
on EG_SOX and EG_REDUCED. That may be 
because it is generally more difficult to parse the 
transcriptions of spoken language than well-
formed text, and more errors are introduced during 
the process of co-reference resolution.

2.5 Discussion and Future Work  

In order to further analyze these features, the  cor-
relation coefficients between various features and 
the average coherence scores (on a five-point 
scale) were calculated; Figure 1 shows the histo-
gram of these correlation values. As the figure 
shows, there are a total of approximately 50 fea-
tures with correlations larger than 0.1. Four of the 
entity-grid features have correlations between 0.15 
and 0.29. As for the writing quality features, some 

817



of them show high correlations with the average 
coherence scores, despite the fact that they are not 
explicitly related to discourse coherence, such as 
the number of good lexical collocations.  

Based on the above analysis, we plan to investi-
gate additional superficial features explicitly relat-
ed to discourse coherence, such as the distribution 
of conjunctions, pronouns, and discourse connec-
tives. Moreover, based on the research on well-
formed texts and learner essays, we will attempt to 
examine more effective features and models to bet-
ter cover the discourse aspects of spontaneous 
speech. For example, local semantic features relat-
ed to inter-sentential coherence and the ISA feature 
will be investigated on spoken responses. In addi-
tion, we will apply the features and build coher-
ence models using the output of automatic speech 
recognition in addition to human transcriptions. 
Finally, various coherence features or models will 
be integrated into a practical automated scoring 
system, and further experiments will be performed 
to measure their effect on the performance of au-
tomated assessment of spontaneous spoken re-
sponses.

3 Conclusion  

In this paper, we present a corpus of coherence 
annotations for spontaneous spoken responses pro-
vided in the context of an English speaking profi-

ciency assessment. Entity-grid features and fea-
tures from an automated essay scoring system were 
examined for coherence modeling of spoken re-
sponses. The analysis on the annotated corpus 
showed promising results for improving the per-
formance of an automated scoring system by 
means of modeling the coherence of spoken re-
sponses.
