Summary 

Emotion analysis is central to tracking customer and user behaviour and satisfaction, which can be 
observed from user interaction in the form of explicit feedback through email, call centre interaction, 
social media comments, etc., as well as implicit acknowledgment of approval or rejection through 
facial expressions, speech or other non-verbal feedback. In Europe specifically, but increasingly also 
globally, an added factor here is that user feedback can be in multiple languages, in text as well as in 
speech and audio-visual content. This implies different cultural backgrounds and thus different ways 
to produce and perceive emotions in everyday interactions, beyond the fact of having specific rules 
for encoding and decoding emotions in each language. 

Making sense of accumulated user interaction from different (‘mixed’) data sources, modalities and 
languages is challenging and has not yet been explored in fullness in an industrial context. Commer-
cial solutions exist but do not address the multilingual aspect in a robust and large-scale setting and do 
not scale up to huge data volumes that need to be processed, or the integration of emotion analysis 
observations across data sources and/or modalities on a meaningful level, i.e. keeping track of entities 
involved as well the connections between them (who said what? to whom? in the context of which 
event, product, service?) 

The MixedEmotions project will implement an integrated Big Linked Data platform for emotion 
analysis across heterogeneous data sources, languages and modalities, building on existing state-of-
the-art tools, services and approaches that will enable the tracking of emotional aspects of user inter-
action and feedback on an entity level. The platform will provide an integrated solution for: 

 Large-scale emotion analysis and fusion on heterogeneous, multilingual, text, speech, video and 
social media data streams, leveraging open access and proprietary data sources, exploiting also 
social context by leveraging social network graphs  

 Semantic-level emotion information aggregation and integration through robust extraction of so-
cial semantic knowledge graphs for emotion analysis along multidimensional clusters 
 

The platform will be developed and evaluated in the context of three cross-domain pilot projects 
that are representative of a variety of data analytics markets: Social TV, Brand Reputation Man-
agement, Call Centre Operations.
