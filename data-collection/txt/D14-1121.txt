Abstract

Demographic lexica have potential for
widespread use in social science, economic,
and business applications. We derive predic-
tive lexica (words and weights) for age and
gender using regression and classification
models from word usage in Facebook, blog,
and Twitter data with associated demographic
labels. The lexica, made publicly available,1

achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in language
based age and gender prediction over Face-
book and Twitter, and were evaluated for
generalization across social media genres as
well as in limited message situations.

1 Introduction
Use of social media has enabled the study of psycho-
logical and social questions at an unprecedented scale
(Lazer et al., 2009). This allows more data-driven dis-
covery alongside the typical hypothesis-testing social
science process (Schwartz et al., 2013b). Social me-
dia may track disease rates (Paul and Dredze, 2011;
Google, 2014), psychological well-being (Dodds et al.,
2011; De Choudhury et al., 2013; Schwartz et al.,
2013a), and a host of other behavioral, psychological
and medical phenomena (Kosinski et al., 2013).

Unlike traditional hypothesis-driven social science,
such large-scale social media studies rarely take into
account—or have access to—age and gender informa-
tion, which can have a major impact on many ques-
tions. For example, females live almost five years
longer than males (cdc, 2014; Marengoni et al., 2011).
Men and women, on average, differ markedly in their
interests and work preferences (Su et al., 2009). With
age, personalities gradually change, typically becom-
ing less open to experiences but more agreeable and
conscientious (McCrae et al., 1999). Additionally, so-
cial media language varies by age (Kern et al., 2014;
Pennebaker and Stone, 2003) and gender (Huffaker and
Calvert, 2005). Twitter may have a male bias (Mislove
et al., 2011), while social media in general skew to-
wards being young and female (pew, 2014).

cial science, economic, and business applications. For
example, one can post-stratify population-level results
to reflect a representative sample, understand variation
across age and gender groups, or produce personalized
marketing, services, and sentiment recommendations;
a movie may be generally disliked, except by people in
a certain age group, whereas a product might be used
primarily by one gender.

This paper describes the creation of age and gen-
der predictive lexica from a dataset of Facebook users
who agreed to share their status updates and reported
their age and gender. The lexica, in the form of words
with associated weights, are derived from a penalized
linear regression (for continuous valued age) and sup-
port vector classification (for binary-valued gender). In
this modality, the lexica are simply a transparent and
portable means for distributing predictive models based
on words. We test generalization and adapt the lex-
ica to blogs and Twitter, plus consider situations when
limited messages are available. In addition to use in
the computational linguistics community, we believe
the lexicon format will make it easier for social sci-
entists to leverage data-driven models where manually
created lexica currently dominate2 (Dodds et al., 2011;
Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010).

2 Related Work
Online behavior is representative of many aspects of
a user’s demographics (Pennacchiotti and Popescu,
2011; Rao et al., 2010). Many studies have used lin-
guistic cues (such as ngrams) to determine if someone
belongs to a certain age group, be it on Twitter or an-
other social media platform (Al Zamal et al., 2012;
Argamon et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2013; Rangel
and Rosso, 2013). Gender prediction has been studied
across blogs (Burger and Henderson, 2006; Goswami
et al., 2009), Yahoo! search queries (Jones et al., 2007),
and Twitter (Burger et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2013;
Liu and Ruths, 2013; Rao et al., 2010). Because Twit-
ter does not make gender or age available, such work
infers gender and age by leveraging profile informa-
tion, such as gender-discriminating names or crawling
for links to publicly available data (e.g. Burger et al.,

2The LIWC lexicon, derived manually based on psycho-
logical theory, (Pennebaker et al., 2001) had 1136 citations in
2013 alone.

2011).
While many studies have examined prediction of age

or gender, none (to our knowledge) have released a
model to the public, much less in the form of a lexi-
con. Additionally, most works in age prediction clas-
sify users into bins rather than predicting a continuous
real-valued age as we do (exceptions: Nguyen et al.,
2013; Jones et al., 2007). People have also used online
media to infer other demographic-like attributes such
as native language (Argamon et al., 2009), origin (Rao
et al., 2010), and location (Jones et al., 2007). An ap-
proach similar to the one presented here could be used
to create lexica for any of these outcomes.

While lexica are not often used for demographics,
data-driven lexicon creation over social media has been
well studied for sentiment, in which univariate tech-
niques (e.g. point-wise mutual information) domi-
nate3. For example, Taboada et al. (2011) expanded
an initial lexicon by adding on co-occurring words.
More recently, Mohammad’s sentiment lexicon (Mo-
hammad et al., 2013) was found to be the most in-
formative feature for the top system in the SemEval-
2013 social media sentiment analysis task (Wilson et
al., 2013). Approaches like point-wise mutual infor-
mation take a univariate view on words–i.e. the weight
given to one feature (word) is not affected by other
features. Since language is highly collinear, we take
a multivariate lexicon development approach, which
takes covariance into account (e.g. someone who men-
tions ‘hair’ often is more likely to mention ‘brushing’,
‘style’, and ‘cut’; weighting these words in isolation
might “double-count” some information).

3 Method

Primary data. Our primary dataset consists of Face-
book messages from users of the MyPersonality appli-
cation (Kosinski and Stillwell, 2012). Messages were
posted between January 2009 and October 2011. We
restrict our analysis to those Facebook users meeting
certain criteria: they must indicate English as a primary
language, have written at least 1,000 words in their sta-
tus updates, be younger than 65 years old (data beyond
this age becomes very sparse), and indicate their gen-
der and age. This resulted in a dataset of N = 75,394
users, who wrote over 300 million words collectively.
We split our sample into training and test sets. Our
primary test set consists of a 1,000 randomly selected
Facebook users, while the training set that we used for
creating the lexica was a subset (N = 72,874) of the
remaining users.

Additional data To evaluate our predictive lexica in
differing situations, we utilize three additional datasets:

3Note that the point-wise information-derived sentiment
lexica are often used as features in a supervised model, essen-
tially dimensionally reducing a large set of words into posi-
tive and negative sentiment, while our lexica represent the
predictive model itself.

stratified Facebook data, blogs, and tweets. The strat-
ified Facebook data (exclusively used for testing) con-
sists of equal proportions of 1,520 males and females
across 12 4-year age bins starting at 13 and ending at
60.4 This roughly matchs the size of the main test set.

Seeking out-of-domain data, we downloaded age
and gender annotated blogs from 2004 (Schler et al.,
2006) (also used in Goswami et al., 2009) and gender
labeled tweets (Volkova et al., 2013). Limiting the sam-
ple to users who wrote at least 1000 words, the total
number of bloggers is 15,006, of which 50.6% are fe-
male and only 15% are over 27 (reflecting the younger
population standard in social media). From this we use
a randomly selected 1,000 bloggers as a blogger test set
and the remaining 14,006 bloggers for training. Sim-
ilarly for the Twitter dataset, we use 11,000 random
gender-only annotated users, in which 51.9% are fe-
male. We again randomly select 1,000 users as a test
set for gender prediction and use the remaining 10,000
for training.

3.1 Lexicon Creation
We present a method of weighted lexicon creation by
using the coefficients from linear multivariate regres-
sion and classification models. Before delving into the
creation process, consider that a weighted lexicon is of-
ten applied as the sum of all weighted word relative
frequencies over a document:

usagelex =
∑

word∈lex
wlex(word) ∗ freq(word, doc)

freq(∗, doc)

where wlex(word) is the lexicon (lex) weight for the
word, freq(word, doc) is frequency of the word in the
document (or for a given user), and freq(∗, doc) is the
total word count for that document (or user).

Further consider how one applies linear multivariate
models in which the goal is to optimize feature coeffi-
cients that best fit the continuous outcome (regression)
or separate two classes (classification):

y = (
∑

f∈features
wf ∗ xf ) + w0

where xf is the value for a feature (f ), wf is the fea-
ture coefficient, and w0 is the intercept (a constant fit
to shift the data such that it passes through the origin).
In the case of regression, y is the outcome value (e.g.
age) while in classification y is used to separate classes
(e.g. >= 0 is female, < 0 is male). If all features are
word relative frequencies ( freq(word,doc)freq(∗,doc) ) then many
multivariate modeling techniques can simply be seen
as learning a weighted lexicon plus an intercept5.

465 females and 65 males in each of the first 11 bins:
[13,16], [17,20], . . . , [53, 56]; the last bin ([57, 60]) contained
45 males and 45 females. The [61.64] bin was excluded as it
was much smaller.

and gender (accuracy %). Baseline for age is mean age of training sample; for gender, it is the most frequent
class (female). Lexica tested include those derived from Facebook (FBlex), blogs (BGlex), and Twitter (Tlex).
We evaluate over a random Facebook sample (randFB), a stratified Facebook sample (stratFB), a random blogger
sample (randBG), and a random twitter sample (randT). All results were a significant (p < 0.001) improvement
over the baseline.

In practice, we learn our 1gram coefficients (i.e. lex-
icon weights) from ridge regression (Hoerl and Ken-
nard, 1970) for age (continuous variable) and from sup-
port vector classification (Fan et al., 2008) for gender
(binary variable). Ridge regression uses an L2 (α||β||2)
penalization to avoid overfitting (Hoerl and Kennard,
1970). Although some words no doubt have a non-
linear relationship with age (e.g., ‘fiance’ peaks in the
20s), we still find high accuracy from a linear model
(see Table 1) and it allows for a distribution of the
model in the accessible form of a lexicon. For gender
prediction, we use an SVM with a linear kernel with
L1 penalization (α||β||1) (Tibshirani, 1996). Because
the L1 penalization zeros-out many coefficients, it has
the added advantage of effectively reducing the size of
the lexica. Using the training data, we test a variety al-
gorithms including the lasso, elastic net regression, and
L2 penalized SVMs in order to decide which learning
algorithms to use.

To extract the words (1grams) to use as features
and which make up lexica, we use the Happier Fun
Tokenizer,6 which handles social media content and
markup such as emoticons or hashtags. For our main
user-level models, word usage is aggregated as the rel-
ative frequency ( freq(word,user)freq(∗,user) ). Due to the sparse
and large vocabulary of social media data, we limit the
1grams to those used by at least 1% of users.

4 Evaluation
We evaluate our predictive lexica across held-out user
data. First, we see how well lexica derived from Face-
book users predict a random set of additional users.
Then, we explore generalization of the models in vari-
ous other settings: on a stratified Facebook test sample,
blogs, and Twitter. Finally, we compare lexica fit to a
restricted number of messages per user.

Results of our evaluation over Facebook users are
shown in Table 1 (randFB columns). Accuracies for
age are reported as Pearson correlation coefficients (r)

and mean absolute errors (mae), measured in years.
For gender, we use an accuracy % (number-correct over
test-size). As baselines, we use the mean for age (23.0
years old) and the most frequent class (female) for gen-
der. We see that for both age and gender, accuracies are
substantially higher than the baseline. These accuracies
were just below with no significant difference previous
state-of-the-art results (Schwartz et al., 2013; r = 0.84
for age and 91.9% accuracy for gender). 7

Because of the nature of our datasets (the Face-
book data is private) and task (user-level predictions),
comparable previous studies are nearly nonexistent.
Nonetheless, the Twitter data was a random subset of
users based on the (Burger et al., 2011) dataset exclud-
ing non-English tweets, making it somewhat compa-
rable. In this case, the lexica outperformed previous
results for gender prediction of Twitter users, which
ranged from 75.5% to 87% (Burger et al., 2011; Ciot
et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Al Zamal et al.,
2012). However, the lexica were unable to match the
92.0% accuracy Burger et al. (2011) achieved when
using profile information in addition to text. No other
similar studies — to the best of our knowledge — have
been conducted.

Application in other settings. While Facebook is the
ideal setting to apply our lexica, we hope that they gen-
eralize to other situations. To evaluate their utility in
other settings, we first tested them over a gender and
age stratified Facebook sample. Our random sample,
like all of Facebook, is biased toward the young; this
stratified test sample contains equal numbers of males
and females, ages 13 to 60. Next, we use the lexica to
predict data from other domains: blogs (Schler et al.,
2006) and Twitter (Volkova et al., 2013). In this case,
our goal was to account for the content and stylistic
variation that may be specific to Facebook.

7Adding 2 and 3-grams increases the performance of our
model (r = 0.85, 92.7%), just above our previous results
(Schwartz et al., 2013b). However, with the accessibility of
single word lexica in mind, this current work focuses on fea-
tures based entirely on 1grams.

tion) and gender (accuracy %) when reducing the num-
ber of messages from each user.

Results over these additional datasets are shown in
Table 1 (stratFB, randBG, and randT columns). The
performance decreases as expected since these datasets
have differing distributions, but it is still substantially
above mean and most frequent class baselines on the
stratified dataset. Over blogs and Twitter, both age
and gender prediction accuracies drop to a greater de-
gree (when only using the Facebook-trained models),
suggesting stylistic or content differences between the
domains. However, when using lexica created with
data from across multiple domains, the results in Face-
book, blogs, and Twitter remain in line with results
from models created specifically over their respective
domains. In light of this result, we release the FB+BG
age & FB+BG+T gender models as lexica (available at
www.wwbp.org/data.html).

Limiting messages per user. As previously noted,
some applications of demographic estimation require
predictions over more limited messages. We explore
the accuracy of user-level age and gender predictions
as the number of messages per user decreases in Ta-
ble 2. For these tests we used the FB+BG age &
FB+BG+T gender lexica. Confirming findings by Van
Durme (2012), the fewer posts one has for each user,
the less accurate the gender and age predictions. Still,
given the average user posted 205 messages, it seems
that not all messages from a user are necessary to make
a decent inference on their age and gender. Future work
may explore models developed specifically for these
limited situations.

5 Conclusion
We created publicly available lexica (words and
weights) using regression and classification models
over language usage in social media. Evaluation of the
lexica over Facebook yielded accuracies in line with
state-of-the-art age (r = 0.831) and gender (91.9% ac-
curacy) prediction. By deriving the lexica from Face-
book, blogs, and Twitter, we found the predictive power
generalized across all three domains with little sacrifice
to any one domain, suggesting the lexica may be used
in additional social media domains. We also found the
lexica maintain reasonable accuracy when writing sam-
ples were somewhat small (e.g. 20 messages) but other
approaches may be best when dealing with more lim-
ited data.

Given that manual lexica are already extensively em-
ployed in social sciences such as psychology, eco-
nomics, and business, using lexical representations of

data-driven models allows the utility of our models to
extend beyond the borders of the field of NLP.
