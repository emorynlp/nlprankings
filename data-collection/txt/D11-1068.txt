Abstract

We present the first algorithms to automat-
ically identify explicit discourse connectives
and the relations they signal for Arabic text.
First we show that, for Arabic news, most
adjacent sentences are connected via explicit
connectives in contrast to English, making the
treatment of explicit discourse connectives for
Arabic highly important. We also show that
explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far
more ambiguous than English ones, making
their treatment challenging. In the second
part of the paper, we present supervised al-
gorithms to address automatic discourse con-
nective identification and discourse relation
recognition. Our connective identifier based
on gold standard syntactic features achieves
almost human performance. In addition, an
identifier based solely on simple lexical and
automatically derived morphological and POS
features performs with high reliability, essen-
tial for languages that do not have high-quality
parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing dis-
course relations performs significantly better
than a baseline based on the connective sur-
face string alone and therefore reduces the am-
biguity in explicit connective interpretation.

1 Introduction

The automatic detection of discourse relations, such
as causal, contrast or temporal relations, is useful for
many applications such as automatic summarization
(Marcu, 2000), question answering (Girju, 2003),
sentiment analysis (Somasundaran et al., 2008) and
readability assessment (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).
This task has recently seen renewed interest due to

the growing availability of large-scale corpora anno-
tated for discourse relations, such as the Penn Dis-
course Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008a).

In the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), lo-
cal discourse relations (also called senses) such as
CAUSAL or CONTRAST are annotated. They hold
between two text segments (so-called arguments)
that express abstract entities such as events, facts and
propositions. Annotated discourse relations can be
signalled explicitly by so-called discourse connec-
tives (Marcu, 2000; Webber et al., 1999; Prasad et
al., 2008a) or hold implicitly between adjacent sen-
tences in the same paragraph, i.e. are not signalled
by a specific surface string. In Ex. 1, the connec-
tive while indicates an explicit CONTRAST between
the attitudes of John and Richard. In Ex. 2, the con-
nective while indicates an explicit TEMPORAL rela-
tion. In Ex. 3, an implicit CAUSAL relation between
the first and second sentence holds. We indicate dis-
course connectives and the two arguments they re-
late via annotated square brackets.

(1) [John liked adventure,]Arg2 [ while]DC[Richard
was cautious]Arg2

(2) [The children were crying
loudly]Arg1[while]DC,[their mother was
cooking]Arg2

(3) [I cannot eat any dessert.]Arg1 [I have eaten far
too much already.]Arg2

Although similar corpora for other languages are
being developed such as for Hindi (Prasad et al.,
2008b), Turkish (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008), Chi-
nese (Xue, 2005) and, by ourselves, for Arabic (Al-

736



Saif and Markert, 2010), efforts in the automated
recognition of discourse connectives, arguments and
relations have so far almost exclusively centered on
English.

In contrast we present the first models for dis-
course relations for Arabic, focusing on explicit con-
nectives. This focus is partially justified by the fact
that this first study for a new language should cen-
ter on the superficially more straightforward case
and that no annotations for implicit relations are yet
available for Arabic. More importantly, however,
we make two essential claims (Section 4). Firstly,
Arabic discourse connectives are more ambiguous
than their English counterparts, i.e cases such as
while which can signal different relations dependent
on context (see Example 1 and 2) are far more fre-
quent. This makes their treatment more challenging.
Secondly, discourse relations between adjacent sen-
tences in Arabic tend to be expressed via an explicit
connective, at least for the news genre, i.e. cases
such as Example 3 are rarer. This makes the treat-
ment of explicit connectives essential.

We tackle two tasks for explicit Arabic connec-
tives in this paper, which are further discussed in
Section 2. Discourse connective recognition needs
to distinguish between discourse usage of potential
connectives and non-discourse usage (such as the
use of while as a noun). We show in Section 5 that
we can distinguish discourse- and non-discourse us-
age for potential connectives in Arabic with very
high reliability, even without parsed data, a fact that
is important for languages with fewer high quality
NLP tools available. We then present an algorithm
for relation identification in Section 6 that shows
small but significant gains over assigning the most
frequent relation for each connective. We discuss
future work and conclude in Section 7.

2 The Tasks

The handling of explicit connectives can be split into
three tasks (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009). The first task
of discourse connective recognition distinguishes
between the discourse usage and non-discourse us-
age of potential connectives. Whereas some poten-
tial connectives such as the Arabic connective 	áºË
/lkn/but almost always have discourse usage, this is

not true for all potential connectives.1 Thus, the dis-
course usage of Arabic �éJ.

	
«P /rġbh/desire needs to

be distinguished from its use as a noun. Conjunc-
tions such as ð /w/and,ð@ /āw/or can have discourse
usage or just conjoin two non-abstract entities as in
èPA ð QÔ« /↪mr w sārh/Omar and Sarah.

The second task is discourse connective interpre-
tation where a discourse connective in context is as-
signed a discourse relation. Again, some connec-
tives are largely unambiguous in this respect. For
example, 	áºË /lkn/but signals almost always a CON-
TRAST relation. However, there are connectives
where this is not the case, such as

	
Y

	
JÓ /mnd

¯
/since

which has a CAUSAL and a TEMPORAL sense.
The third task is argument identification which

identifies the arguments’ position and extent. In this
paper we tackle Task 1 and Task 2 for Arabic in a
supervised machine learning framework.

Annotated Discourse Corpora and Linguistic
Background. Discourse relations are widely stud-
ied in theoretical linguistics (Halliday and Hasan,
1976; Hobbs, 1985), where also different relation
taxonomies have been derived (Hobbs, 1985; Knott
and Sanders, 1998; Mann and Thompson, 1988;
Marcu, 2000). Different inventories have been used
in English corpora annotated for discourse relations
(Hobbs, 1985; Prasad et al., 2008a; Carlson et al.,
2002) which also differ in other respects (such as
whether they prescribe a tree structure for discourse
annotation). However, the annotation level of ex-
isting Arabic corpora has not yet included the dis-
course layer, making our work the first to address
this problem for Arabic on a larger scale.

Automatic discourse parsing: explicit relations.
There is no work on discourse connective recog-
nition, interpretation and argument assignment for
Arabic, so that we break entirely new ground here.
However, the two tasks we explore (discourse con-
nective recognition and discourse connective disam-
biguation) have been tackled for English.2 (Pitler

1Arabic examples contain in order: the Arabic right-to-left
script, the transliteration (standards ISO/R 233 and DIN 31635)
and the English translation (if possible).

2There is also substantial work on argument identification
(Wellner and Pustejovski, 2007; Elwell and Baldridge, 2008)

737



and Nenkova, 2009) use gold standard syntactic fea-
tures as well as the connective surface string in a
supervised model for discourse connective recogni-
tion. They achieve very high results with this ap-
proach. We will (i) show that similar features work
well for Arabic (ii) take into account Arabic-specific
morphological properties that improve results fur-
ther and (iii) present a robust version of this ap-
proach that does not rely on full parsing or gold stan-
dard syntactic annotations.

With regard to discourse connective interpreta-
tion, (Miltsakaki et al., 2005) concentrate on disam-
biguating the three connectives since, while, when
only, using a very small set of features indicating
tense and temporal markers in arguments. They
achieve good improvements over a “most frequent
relation per connective” baseline. A more compre-
hensive study on all discourse connectives in the
PDTB (Pitler et al., 2008; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009)
reveals that most connectives are not ambiguous in
English. Using syntactic features of the connec-
tive, they achieve only a very small improvement
over a “most frequent relation per connective base-
line” for which significance tests are not given. We
will show that for Arabic, discourse connectives are
more highly ambiguous with regard to the relations
they convey. We will present a supervised learning
model that uses a wider feature set and that achieves
small but significant improvements over the most
frequent relation per connective baseline.

Automatic discourse parsing: implicit relations.
Implicit relations have excited substantial interest
for English. This includes work in the frame-
work of RST (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; duVerle
and Prendinger, 2009; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002),
SDRT (Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005), Graph-
Bank (Wellner et al., 2006), the PDTB (Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2007; Pitler et al., 2009; Lin
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Zhou et al.,
2010; Louis and Nenkova, 2010) or framework-
independent (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).3 The
task is challenging as implicits behave substantially
differently from explicits (Sporleder and Lascarides,

but we do not discuss this work in depth here.
3Some work does not make the distinction between implicit

and explicit and/or treats them in a joint framework (Soricut and
Marcu, 2003; Wellner et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2010).

2008) and often need world knowledge (Lin et
al., 2009). However, features/approaches that have
shown improvement over a baseline are word pairs
(Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008), production rules
and syntactic trees (Wang et al., 2010; Lin et al.,
2009) as well as language modelling (Zhou et al.,
2010). As we only deal with explicit connectives
this work is not directly comparable to ours, al-
though we do explore some of the suggested features
for improving explicit connective disambiguation.

4 An Arabic Discourse Corpus

We annotate news articles from the Arabic Penn
Treebank (Part 1 v2.0) (Maamouri and Bies, 2004)
for explicitly marked discourse relations. This is the
first discourse-annotated corpus for Arabic, whose
initial development stages we have described in (Al-
Saif and Markert, 2010). We summarize this previ-
ous work and extend it by including agreement stud-
ies for arguments in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. In Sec-
tions 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. we then present a corpus study
on the corpus which shows our major claim as to the
importance and high levels of ambiguity of Arabic
discourse connectives.

4.1 Annotation Principles

We overall follow the annotation principles in the
Penn Discourse Treebank for explicit connectives
(for example, arguments can occur at any distance
from the connectives). The relation set we use is
a more coarse-grained version of the PDTB rela-
tions with two relations added — BACKGROUND
and SIMILARITY — that we found in our Arabic
news texts. The final, hierarchically organized, re-
lation set of 17 discourse relations is shown in Fig 1.

Further adaptations necessary for Arabic are the
inclusion of clitics as connectives such as È /l/for, H.
/b/by,with and

	
¬ /f/then . In addition, differently to

English, prepositions were included as connectives
as these are frequently used to express discourse re-
lations in Arabic. In these cases, normally argument
2 is the so-called Al-Masdar.4 Typical examples are
Èñð /ws. wl/arrival from the verb Éð /ws. /to ar-
rive and �éËðAm× /mh. āwlh/attempt from the verb ÈðAg

4The medieval Arabic grammar schools, the Basra and Kufa,
debated whether the noun (almasdar) or the verb is the most
basic element of language (Ryding, 2005).

738



Figure 1: Discourse relations for Arabic

/h. āwl/to try. Al-Masdar is formed using morpho-
logical patterns well-known in the Arabic grammat-
ical tradition: major Arabic grammars list around 60
patterns although some other references also claim
that the patterns are many more as well as more un-
predictable (Abdl al latif et al., 1997; Wright, 2008;
Ryding, 2005). Al-Masdar forms do not fit into one
grammatical or morphological category in English:
they might correspond to a gerund, a nominalization
or a noun which is not a nominalization. Some ex-
amples are listed in Table 1.

4.2 Agreement Studies
The occurrences of a precompiled list of 107 po-
tential discourse connectives were annotated inde-
pendently by 2 native Arabic speakers on 537 news
texts. Agreement was measured for the distinction
of discourse vs. non-discourse usage, relation as-
signment and argument assignment.

Agreement for the classification tasks of dis-
course connective recognition and relation assign-
ment was measured using kappa (Siegel and Castel-
lan, 1956). Argument agreement was measured by
agr, a directional measure (Wiebe et al., 2005). It
measures the word overlap between the text spans
of two judges (ann1 and ann2). agr(ann1||ann2)
measures the proportion of words ann1 annotated
that were also annotated by ann2.

agr(ann1||ann2) = |ann1 matching ann2||ann1|

Discourse connective recognition proved to be
highly reliable with percentage agreement of 0.95
and a kappa of 0.88 on the 23,331 occurrences of
the 107 potential discourse connectives. 5586 of the
potential connectives were agreed on by both anno-
tators to have discourse usage and agreement for re-
lations and argument assignment was measured on
these. As shown in Table 2, kappa on all 17 relations
was low with 0.57 — it turned out that this was due
to the frequent, almost rhetorical use of the connec-
tive ð /w/and at the beginning of paragraphs, which
is a genre convention for Arabic news that normally
does not convey a specific discourse relation. Disre-
garding such occurrences of ð /w/and, kappa rises to
good agreement: 0.69 for fine-grained relations and
0.75 when measuring agreement between the 4 ma-
jor relations EXPANSION, CONTINGENCY, COM-
PARISON and TEMPORAL.
Argument agreement on the 5586 agreed connec-
tives is shown in Table 3. We report high word over-
lap via agr (over 90%) for Arg2, which is the ar-
gument syntactically attached to the connective, and
lesser but still substantial agreement for Arg1.

4.3 Gold standard

We produced a unified gold standard. First, we auto-
matically corrected easily made annotator mistakes.
With regard to argument extent, we automatically
corrected mistakes such as the erroneous inclusion
of punctuation marks at the end of clauses/sentences
or not including all obligatory complements in a
verb phrase argument. The latter relied on the syn-
tactic annotation in the ATB. Second, with regard to
discourse relation assignment, we automatically as-
signed EXPANSION.CONJUNCTION to all disagreed
instances of ð /w/and at BOP.5 A further disam-
biguation study is necessary for ð /w/and at BOP,
which is beyond the scope of this paper.

Finally, an adjudicator not initially involved in an-
notation reconciled the remaining disagreements at

all levels and included annotations for 5 new po-
tential discourse connective types not in our initial
connective list but commented on by the annotators
during annotation. 3 news files were removed from
the corpus — they contained no actual news reports
but just a list of headlines.

The final discourse treebank we use has 6328 an-
notated explicit connectives in 534 files. 68 connec-
tive types were found, rising to 80 connective types
if we include all modified forms of a connective as
distinct types such as 	áÓ Ñ 	«QËAK. /bālrġm mn,

	
à@ Ñ

	
«P

/rġm ān as modified forms of Ñ 	«P /rġm/although.
Most discourse connectives were only annotated

with a single relation but 5% were annotated with
two or more relations (as also allowed in the PDTB).
These statistics are summarised in Table 4.

4.4 Importance of explicitly signalled relations

We compared the number of relations between 2
adjacent sentences that were explicitly signalled in
English vs. the ones that were explicitly signalled
in Arabic, using the PDTB and our corpus (both
containing texts of the news genre). Out of a total
44,470 adjacent sentence pairs in the PDTB, 5355

740



(12%) were linked by an explicit connective.6 In
contrast, out of the 3073 adjacent sentence pairs in
our corpus, 2140 (70%) were linked by an explicit
connective, 948 (30%) were linked via non-wa con-
nectives. Thus, for our corpus, modeling of explicit
connectives is primary: intrasentential relations tend
to be marked by connectives anyway in both English
and Arabic, and our corpus shows that this is true for
most local intersentential relations as well.

4.5 Ambiguity for Arabic discourse connectives

We investigate the ambiguity of Arabic connectives
with regard to their sense at class level (4 relations)
as well as the more fine-grained level (all 17 rela-
tions). We restrict our investigation to the connec-
tive occurrences that were annotated with a single
relation (6039 tokens) and also exclude ð /w/and at
the beginning of paragraph, leaving 3813 tokens.7

Of 80 connective types, 52 were unambiguous at the
class level and 47 at the fine-grained level. However,
many of the most frequent connectives are highly
ambiguous. If we just assign the most frequent read-
ing to each of the 3813 connectives, we achieve an
accuracy of 82.7% at the class-level and 74.3% at
the more fine-grained level for relation assignment,
leaving a substantial error margin. This contrasts
with the English PDTB, where at the class-level 92%
can be achieved with this simple method and 85% at
the second-level.8

5 Discourse Connective Recognition

We distinguished discourse vs. non-discourse usage
for all potential connectives in the 534 gold stan-
dard files. As headers and footers in the news files
never contained true discourse connectives, we dis-
regarded these, leaving 20,312 potential discourse
connectives of which 6328 are actual connectives.

6Connections between subclauses or phrases in different,
adjacent sentences were included in the count.

7We automatically assigned CONJUNCTION to many occur-
rences of ð /w/and at BOP (Section 4.3) so that it is not sensible
to include these occurrences in a study of human-assigned am-
biguity.

8The second level in the PDTB with its 16 relations corre-
sponds approximately to our fine-grained inventory. This com-
parison can only be appropriate due to slight differences in the
lower-grained relation inventory.

5.1 Features
Apart from the surface string of the potential con-
nective Conn, we use the following features. Fea-
tures are either extracted from raw files tokenized
by white space only (M2) or from raw files tok-
enized by white space and tagged by the Stanford
tagger9 (Models M3, M4) or from the Arabic Tree-
bank (ATB) gold standard part-of-speech and parse
annotation (models M5-M9). The syntactic features
(Syn) are inspired by (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009).
Lexical/POS patterns of surrounding words, clitic
features and Al-Masdar are novel.

Surface Features (SConn). These include the po-
sition of the potential connective (sentence-initial,
medial or final). The type of the potential connective
is Simple when the potential connective is a single
token not attached to other tokens, PotClitic when
it is attached. Potential connectives containing more
than one token have MoreThanToken type.

Models where we use ATB or automated tagging
(M3-M9) distinguish further between potential cli-
tics that are assigned a POS and ones that are not.
Models that use ATB annotation also distinguish
between potential connectives that correspond to a
phrase in the ATB (MorethanToken Phrase) and
the ones that do not (MorethanToken NonPhrase).

Lexical features of surrounding words (Lex).
We encode the surface strings of the three words
before and after the connective, recording posi-
tion. These features are especially useful for lan-
guages where no accurate parser or tagger is avail-
able as lexical patterns can capture discourse and
non-discourse usage. For instance, if a potential
connective is followed by 	à@ /ān/ it most likely has
a discourse function (see Ex. 5).

Part of Speech features (POS). We include
the pos tag of the potential connective via the
ATB/Stanford Tagger. For potential connectives that
consist of more than one token, we combined its
ordered POS tags. Thus, the potential connective
ÈAg ú




	
¯ /fy h. āl/in case with its tags (fy PREP)(Hal

NOUN)) will receive the pos PREP#NOUN. If a po-
tential connective does not receive a separate POS
tag in the ATB/tagger, the value ”NONE” is as-
signed. This allows to distinguish clitics from let-
ters at the start of a word. We also record the
POS of the three words before/after the connective
(ATB/Stanford Tagger). Similar to lexical patterns,
these can capture discourse and non-discourse us-
age. For instance, if a potential connective is soon
followed by a modal, it is more likely to have a dis-
course function.
Syntactic category of related phrases (Syn). We
record the syntactic category of the parent of the po-
tential connective in ATB. For example, it is rare
that cases where the parent of the potential connec-
tive is an adjective phrase, correspond to discourse-
usage. A typical example of a non-discourse usage
of ð /w/and ( �éÊJ
Ôg. ð

J.»

�
éPYÖÏ @ /ālmdrsh kbyrh w

ǧmylh/ the school is very large and beautiful) illus-
trates this. Unlike English, parents in Arabic often
are noun phrases as nominalisations are frequent ar-
guments of prepositional connectives. We also en-
code the Left sibling category and right sibling cat-
egory of the connective. For discourse connectives,
the right sibling is normally S, SBAR, VP or an NP
(if the connective is a preposition).

Al-Masdar feature. Potential connectives fol-
lowed by Al-Masdar are more likely to have dis-
course usage (see Section 4.1). Especially preposi-
tions with discourse usage are normally attached to
Al-masdar such as in �é�KXAjÖÏ /lmh. ādt¯

h/for contacting
or Z @Qk. AK. /bāǧrā↩/by processing. Al-Masdar informa-
tion is not included in the ATB so we constructed a
binary Al-Masdar feature from (tagged) text by ex-
amining the first noun after the potential connective.
We developed an algorithm to judge such a noun as
Al-Masdar or not. This algorithm uses a stemmer
for Arabic and then determines whether the stem is
al-Masdar by a combination of surface-based rules
to check whether the stem corresponds to one of the
known Al-Masdar patterns.

5.2 Results and Discussion

We used the implementation JRip of the rule-
based classifier Ripper in the machine learning tool
WEKA with its default settings. We used 10-fold
cross-validation throughout. Significance tests are
reported using the McNemar test at the significance
level of 1%. A most frequent category baseline
would assign all potential connectives as not connec-
tive, achieving an accuracy of 68.9% as only 6328 of
our potential 20,312 connectives actually have dis-
course usage. We built several models using differ-
ent features. The results are shown in Table 5.

A simple model M1 that only uses the connective
string improves significantly over the baseline with
75.7% accuracy but a kappa of only 0.48, showing
that this is not a reliable strategy. Models M2-M4
do not rely on gold standard annotation or parsing
(in contrast to the models for English in (Pitler and
Nenkova, 2009)). Using only surface and lexical
features that can be extracted from white-space to-
kenized raw files in addition to the connective string
(M2), gains a substantial improvement over using
the connective string alone. This is further improved
by using POS tags of connectives and surrounding
words with an automatic tagger (M3) and by includ-
ing the Al-Masdar feature (M4), thus making good
use of the morphological properties of Arabic. All
differences are statistically significant (M1 < M2 <
M3 < M4). The final model is reliable (kappa 0.70),
an encouraging result given the absence of parsing
and important for resource-scarce languages.

With ATB gold standard tokenisation, tagging and
parsing, our models (not surprisingly) improve fur-
ther showing the same pattern of (M1 < M5 < M6 <
M7) with all differences being significant. The final
best model achieves highly reliable results (accuracy
92.4%, kappa 0.82). We also conclude that syntac-
tic features are more useful than lexical patterns as
model M8 (syntax with no lexical patterns) achieves
equally good results as M6. Our models also man-
age to generalise well over individual connectives.
If we leave out the connective string (M9), we still
achieve a highly reliable result.

6 Discourse Relation Recognition

When disambiguating the relation that discourse
connectives signal, we assume that the arguments of

the connective are known. This is well-established
for PDTB relation recognition (Wang et al., 2010;
Lin et al., 2009; Miltsakaki et al., 2005). Our mod-
els predict single relations on two datasets: (i) all
instances of connectives signalling single relations
(Set All, 6039 instances) (2) all instances apart from
the connective ð /w/and at beginning of paragraph
as they are affected by the auto-correction process
(Set no-wa-atBOP, 3813 instances). We use 10-fold
cross-validation and JRip as well as a McNemar test
at the 5% level for significance tests.

6.1 Features

Whereas some of the features we use have been used
for English implicit relation recognition (Lin et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2010; Pitler et al., 2009) , they
are new for Arabic and not widely used for explicit
connectives. All features are extracted from the ATB
gold standard parses.
Connective features. This includes the connec-
tive string Conn. In addition, we also use the sur-
face connective features and POS of connective de-
scribed in Section 5. We also use the syntactic path
to the connective as a novel feature.
Words and POS of arguments. The words and
pos tags of the first three words in Arg1 and
Arg2 are used to catch patterns in arguments.
For example, when the first word of Arg2 is
Y

�
¯ /qd/might/may or 	àA¿ /kān/had, the relation is

likely to be EXPANSION.BACKGROUND or EXPAN-
SION.CONJUNCTION. We also measure word over-

lap between the arguments, hoping to catch relations
such as COMPARISON.SIMILARITY.
Masdar. This feature states whether the first or
second word in Arg 2 is an Al-Masdar. Many prepo-
sitional connectives followed by an Al-Masdar indi-
cate a CONTINGENCY.CAUSE relation (see Ex. 4)
Tense and Negation. Each argument is assigned
its tense as one of perfect, imperfect, future or none.
We also indicate whether the tense of Arg1 or 2 are
the same and whether a negation is part of Arg 1
or 2. Inspired by (Miltsakaki et al., 2005), we stip-
ulate that tense is useful for recognizing temporal
and causal relations. For example, the arguments of
the relation TEMPORAL.SYNCHRONOUS are likely
to have the same tense. In contrast, arg1 tense is
more likely to be prior to arg2 tense for TEMPO-
RAL.ASYNCHRONOUS and CAUSE relations.
Length, Distance and Order Features. We use
the length of arguments (in words), word distance
between a connective and its arguments (-1; for ar-
guments in order Arg1 Conn Arg2 Arg1), tree dis-
tance of connective and arguments (0 if connective
and an argument are in the same tree) and a bi-
nary feature of whether Arg1 and Arg2 are in dif-
ferent sentences. A nominal feature encodes one of
the three orders Arg1 Conn Arg2, Conn Arg2 Arg1
and Arg1 Conn Arg2 Arg1, the latter being fre-
quent in Arabic for TEMPORAL.ASYNCHRONOUS
relations.
Argument Parent. We record the syntactic par-
ent of each Argument. However, not every argu-

743



ment corresponds to a complete tree in the ATB —
in these cases we extract the category of the parent
shared by the first and last word in the argument.

Production Rules. We use all non-lexical produc-
tion rules that occur more than 10 times in the argu-
ments as binary features. This was inspired by (Lin
et al., 2009) who use production rules to good effect
for implicit relations in English.

6.2 Results

Table 6 shows the results for fine-grained (17 rela-
tions) classification. The baseline of assigning the
most frequent relation EXPANSION.CONJUNCTION
to every connective performs with an accuracy of
52.5% on Set All and 35% on set no-wa-atBOP. If
we use a model that relies on the discourse connec-
tive alone (M1) we achieve results of 77.2%/74.3%,
respectively. As noted in Section 4.5 this is substan-
tially lower than what the same model can achieve
for English. Including connective and argument fea-
tures (apart from production rules) in M2, leads to a
small but significant improvement.10 Further incor-
poration of production rules does not improve the
results (M3). In Table 7, we show the results at the
class-level (4 relations). Here using additional fea-
tures over the connective string does not lead to sig-
nificant improvements.

6.3 Discussion and Error Analysis

We concentrate our discussion on fine-grained clas-
sification excluding wa at BOP.

Our improvements in M2 over the connective-
only classifier (M1) are in two main areas. First, our
model performs generalisation, i.e. outputs some
rules that do not use the connective string at all.
These achieve a somewhat surprising improvement
of M2 over M1 for unambiguous connectives which
are too rare to classify via the connective string. In
those cases, they either (i) have not been seen in the
training data before and are therefore not classifiable
when seen first time in the test set or (ii) have been

10Our corpus includes some texts on similar topics where
some sentences are (almost) repeated in different texts. To
investigate whether our improvements are due to this repeti-
tion, we also performed an experiment excluding all repeated
instances of feature vectors from the corpus. The results are
almost the same and, most importantly, M2 again improves sig-
nificantly over M1.

seen in the training data too rarely for the rule-based
classifier to develop a rule judged to be more re-
liable than the default EXPANSION.CONJUNCTION
classification. Our data includes 47 unambiguous
connective types, accounting for 574 of the 3813
tokens. 30 of these 47 types are so rare that we
found mistakes in the connective-only classification,
including B@ /ālā/except (2), I.

lmā(2), Ñ 	«QK. /brġm(1). For 14 of these 30 connec-
tives, model M2 was able to use generalised rules
to improve relation assignment.11 These rules in-
volve mainly connective surface and POS features.
Thus, sentence-start adverbials consisting of more
than one token such as 	à@ YJ
K. /byd ān(6) and

	
à@ Q�


	
«

/ġyr ān(6) were correctly classified as CONTRAST.

11For the other 16 connectives neither of the models was able
to classify them correctly.

744



This advantage of our model over the connective-
only model might disappear if in a larger corpus
more instances of those connectives are found
and are still unambiguous. Therefore, we are
more interested in how our classifier does on
truly ambiguous connectives (33 connective types
accounting for 3239 tokens of 3813 overall to-
kens). We conducted a separate significance test
on ambiguous connectives only and found that
M2 improves over M1 classification significantly
at the 1% level. How well we do on individual
connectives depends on their frequency and on their
level of ambiguity. If connectives are ambiguous
and of low frequency (ñË /lw, AÖ

	
ß @ /ānmā, ÈAg /h. āl/)

both M1 and M2 do perform badly on them. If
connectives are frequent (10 or more occurrences)
and have relatively low ambiguity (majority reading
accounts for more than 70% of instances), the
overall performance of M1 and M2 with regard to
accuracy is also similar, often both using just the
connective string. On the other hand, if connectives
are frequent and have high ambiguity (i.e. no such
clear majority reading), then M2 normally improves
(often substantially) on M1. Examples of such
connectives are AÒ» /kmā, AÒJ


	
¯ /fymāand Q�K@ /āt

¯
r.

Most of the successful rules use tense in some form,
either via part of speech of verbs or via comparing
the tense in the two arguments. This, for example,
led to a successful recognition of all 9 instances of
Similarity in the connective kmA (whose major-
ity relation is Expansion.Conjunction in 40 out
of 65 occurrences). The connective

	
¬ /f/then is dis-

tinguished into EXPANSION.EXEMPLIFICATION,
CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.RESULT and CONTIN-
GENCY.CAUSE.REASON readings, depending on
the lexemes around it, the parents of its arguments,
and whether its argument 2 is tensed or not. Thus,
nontensed arguments are most often nominalisations
leading to a reason reading, whereas a verb phrase
as argument 2 and a sentence as argument 1 often is
a result reading. However, it is worth reporting that
in cases of very high ambiguity, M2 is still far from
perfect such as for connectives f

	
¬ /fand Q�K@ /āt

¯
r.

Some improvements again come from gener-
alised rules: there are some very high-coverage
and high precision generalised rules that reduce
dependency on the connective string. For example,
clitic prepositions (such as È /l/for) can without

any further information be clearly classified as
Contingency.Cause.Reason.NonPragmatic
covering 494 occurrences with only 26 mistakes.
These are cases where the following argument is
normally Al-Masdar.

Our analysis leads us to the following strategy
for follow-on work. First of all, a larger corpus is
necessary to get more examples for low frequency
connectives. Secondly, experiments with different
classifiers are worthwhile to conduct to see how our
improvements generalise. Third, the most mileage
is in further improvements on frequent, ambiguous
connectives such as

	
¬ /f,

	
Y

	
JÓ /mnd

¯
and ð@ /āw. This

can be achieved with, on the one hand, training
connective-specific classifiers on larger data sets but
will, on the other hand, also need a wider feature
base. From our corpus study, we think that lexico-
semantic features such as word pairs and seman-
tic classes of verbal/nominalised arguments are the
most promising.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented the first study on the automatic
detection and disambiguation of Arabic discourse
connectives. A corpus study showed that these
are highly frequent and more ambiguous than their
English counterparts. Our automatic algorithms
achieve very good results on discourse connective
identification, using Arabic morphological proper-
ties to good effect. It is particular promising that we
do not need parsed data to identify discourse usage
of potential connectives reliably. Our algorithm for
discourse connective interpretation beats the chal-
lenging baseline of assigning the most frequent re-
lation per connective. In future, we will explore fur-
ther features for connective disambiguation as well
as connective-specific classification, combined with
semi-supervised algorithms to alleviate data sparse-
ness. We will also develop algorithms for argument
identification.
