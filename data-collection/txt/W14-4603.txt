Abstract 

The Internet contains a plethora of openly available dictionaries of many kinds, translating between 

thousands of language pairs.  Three tools are described, Multidict, Wordlink and Clilstore, all openly 

available at multidict.net, which enable these diverse resources to be harnessed, unified, and utilised in 

ergonomic fashion.  They are of particular benefit to intermediate level language learners, but also to re-

searchers and learners of all kinds.  Multidict facilitates finding and using online dictionaries in hun-

dreds of languages, and enables easy switching between different dictionaries and target languages.  It 

enables the utilization of page-image dictionaries in the Web Archive.  Wordlink can link most webpag-

es word by word to online dictionaries via Multidict.  Clilstore is an open store of language teaching ma-

terials utilizing the power of Wordlink and Multidict.   The programing and database structures and ide-

as behind Multidict, Wordlink and Clilstore are described. 

 

 

 

1 Introduction 

At multidict.net three tools are to be found, Multidict, Wordlink and Clilstore.  Their develop-

ment was funded by EC projects with the aim of developing and sharing tools for language learning, 

and thanks to this they are  a freely and openly available resource.  They support not only the major 

European languages, but also place a particular emphasis on supporting minority languages including 

the Celtic languages.  They also currently support scores of non-European languages and have the po-

tential to support many more. 

The central idea behind them is that one of the best ways of learning a language is to use authentic 

materials as early as possible - materials which are of interest for their own sake.  This is the “CLIL”, 
“Content and Language Integrated Learning”, in the name “Clilstore”.  In the past, this would have 

meant either the students laboriously looking up word after word in the dictionary, or else the teacher 

laboriously preparing glossaries of the most difficult words for each piece of reading material.  Good 

authentic content is easy to find via the Internet for most subjects in most languages, but preparing the 

glossaries was tedious. 

For the students, online dictionaries, and there are many of them, sped up the process of looking up 

words compared to the old paper dictionaries.  But it was still tedious typing in words, and then typing 

or copying them in again to try them in another dictionary.  Far better if you could just click on a word 

in a text to look it up.  This is the idea behind Wordlink.  It takes any webpage and modifies the html 
so that every word is linked to online dictionaries while the presentation of the page remains the same.

Automatic glossing of text as an aid to learners is not an idea unique to this project.  It is used by the 

Rikaichan
1
 Firefox add-on for Japanese, by the BBC Vocab

2
 facility for Welsh and Gaelic, by the 

Readlang
3
 website, by the PIE

4
 Chrome add-on for English, and by many e-books.  While these sys-

tems have many advantages, they also have severe restrictions compared to Wordlink: restrictions to 

particular languages, or particular browsers, or particular websites, or particular in-house dictionaries.  

Wordlink differs in that it attempts to generalize to very many languages and to harness the many 

freely available online dictionaries. 

The earliest versions of Wordlink contained the code and knowledge required to link to a range of 

online dictionaries translating to various target languages.  But the list quickly became ridiculously 

long and it was realized that the work of selecting and accessing different dictionaries needed to be 

hived off to a separate facility.  So Multidict was created, and is a tremendously useful standalone 
facility in its own right. 

Finally Clilstore was created to make it easy for language teachers to create materials and lessons 
utilizing the power of Wordlink and Multidict, and to make it easy for students and teachers to find 

material of interest stored openly in Clilstore.  The great thing about Clilstore is that it enables students 

to access interesting material which would otherwise be a bit too difficult for them to cope with.  It has 

proved to be particularly useful to intermediate level learners, and to learners coming from cognate 

languages. 

We now look at the technical workings behind each of these three tools in turn. 

2 Multidict 

2.1 The interface 

Here is what Multidict looks like in use: 

 
Figure 1. The Multidict interface 

 

The section at the top is the “Multidict navigation frame” which controls dictionary selection and 

lookup. (Yes, Multidict uses old-fashioned frames
5
.)  Below that is the frame containing the output 

returned by the online dictionary.  In this case Multidict is being used to look up the Gàidhlig word

dubh in the Gàidhlig to English dictionary Am Faclar Beag meanbh6 (the concise version of Am 
Faclair Beag7). 

Note (1) the url which can be used to refer to the dictionary output for this word.  This can be par-
ticularly useful in the case of dictionaries which do not themselves have any way of linking to their 

output via a url.  The “sl” stands for “source language” and “tl” stands for “target language”. 

Note (2) the row of 16x16 pixel favicons for dictionaries.  Clicking on one of these switches you to 
the corresponding dictionary.  They give the navigation frame a cluttered appearance, but once you get 

to know them they are much quicker and more convenient than selecting a dictionary using the 

dropdown selector.  If the dictionary website has its own favicon, as most do, then Multidict uses that.  

If not, we try to construct a mnemonic favicon for the dictionary using the dictionary’s own colours.  

Both in the row of favicons and in the dictionary dropdown, the dictionaries are placed in some kind 

of compromise order of preference.  Note (3) that some favicons have an underline.  This signals that 
the dictionary is a page-image dictionary where the user will have to scan around by eye on the page 
to find the word in question.  More about page-image dictionaries in section 2.7 below.  An overline 

where present above a favicon signals that the dictionary is a concise version, perhaps designed for 

mobile phones, which can often be very useful if the dictionary is being used together with Wordlink. 

Note (4) the favicon for the current dictionary, and (5) the Esc button which provides a convenient 
way of escape from Multidict’s frames to the dictionary’s own homepage.  Multidict is in fact a very 

convenient way of finding dictionaries and we have no desire to keep users on Multidict if they prefer 

to head off and use the dictionary directly. 

Multidict does not itself have any dictionary information, but relies entirely on directing users to 

online dictionaries.  So we need to be fair and maintain good relations with dictionary owners.  Mul-
tidict makes a point of never “scraping”

8
, never even caching information from dictionary pages.  Out-

put is always presented exactly as it comes from the dictionary, complete with any advertising.  In 

fact, whenever possible, Multidict operates by sending a simple HTTP “redirect” to redirect the user’s 

browser to the dictionary page.  Multidict advertises to dictionary owners that they can ask for their 

dictionary to be removed from Multidict’s database at any time for any reason, but no dictionary own-

er has ever requested this. 

Note (6) the “favicon” symbols for switching to closely related languages.  This makes it easy, for 
example, to switch and look for the word dubh in Irish dictionaries instead of Scottish Gaelic.  For 
most languages we just use language codes for these symbols, but for the Celtic languages we have 

colourful symbols available.  The same is possible for the target language, although in the example 

above the only symbol shown is the “Gàidhlig” symbol for switching to Gàidhlig-Gàidhlig monolin-

gual dictionaries.  To support this system, the Multidict database has two tables holding information 

on closely related languages.  Two tables because “closely related” for the purposes of the target lan-

guage field may not be the same as closely related for the purposes of the source language field.  There 

would be no point in trying an “sr-Latn” (Serbian in Latin script) word in an “sr” (Serbian in Cyrillic 

script) dictionary, but someone who understood “sr” could be expected to understand “sr-Latn”. 

2.2 The database behind it 

How does Multidict work?  For many dictionaries, very very simply.  If when you look up the word 

dubh at friendlydict.org, you notice that the url is 
http://friendlydict.org/find?facail=dubh 

then you can be sure that by simply replacing dubh with geal in the url, you would look up the word 

geal.  For such dictionaries, the Multidict database would store the string 
http://friendlydic.org/find?facail={word} 

and when the time came to look up a word, Multidict would simply replace {word} with the word in 

question and redirect the results frame to this address. 

However, for many dictionaries, both good ones and less good, things are not so simple.  Their html 

form submission uses POST method instead of GET method and there is no sign of a nice url contain-
ing the word to search for.  In this case, Multidict has to construct and send an http POST request.  It

8 The practice of extracting partial information from webpages on another site:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping 

20



does this using the HTTP_Request2 PEAR
9
 class.  (PEAR being a repository of software for the PHP 

language.)  Multidict captures the response to the request and despatches it to the results frame. 

Multidict, Wordlink and Clilstore are written in PHP, and behind them is a mySQL (or MariaDB
10

 

to be precise) database.  The database has a dict table with a record for each dictionary,  storing the 

long name, the favicon and the dictionary’s homepage address. 

However, many dictionaries serve several languages, and the main business is done by the table 

dictParam, which is indexed by  (dict, sl, tl).  This table stores the url, as described 

above, any post parameters required, and has many other fields.  A field called message can contain 

a tip to be displayed to users in the navigation frame, such as “Right-click to zoom”.   A field 

charextra can specify certain different kinds of extra processing to be applied to the word before 

lookup to satisfy the peculiarities of particular dictionaries.  Some dictionaries require accents to be 

stripped from the word, some require them to be urlencoded
11

.  The Irish Dineen
12

 dictionary requires 

‘h’s to be stripped from the word to convert to old spelling and dictionary order, and this is indicated 

by the string “striph” in the charextra field.  A field handling specifies any particular handling 

required to obtain the output from the dictionary.  The best behaved dictionaries get the value “redi-

rect”.  Some particularly awkward dictionaries which require POST parameters and only accept re-

quests from the user’s browser get the value “form”. This causes Multidict to construct a form in the 

results frame, fill in the search word, and cause the user’s browser via Javascript to immediately sub-

mit it.  Thus Multidict has a whole range of clever tricks and tools available to it, which means that it 

manages to handle between 80% and 90% of all dictionaries we have attempted to link to. 

2.3 Language codes 

Multidict currently tries to use IETF language codes
13

 both externally and internally. i.e. It uses a two-

letter ISO 639-1
14

 language code such as “en”, “fr”, “de”, “ga”, “gd” if such is available, or a three 

letter ISO 639-3
15

 language code such as “sco”, “sga” when no two-letter code is available, and it 

sometimes makes use of country code and script code extensions such as “pt-BR” and “sr-Latn”.  

When these are inadequate, such as for historic languages and dialects, it turns to LinguistList
16

 codes 

for inspiration: e.g. “non-swe” (Old Swedish
17

), and “oci-ara” (Aranese
18

). 

Where ISO 639-3 equates a two-letter language code with a three letter code denoting a macrolan-
guage19, as in the case of Latvian lt=lav which also includes Latgalian, Multidict uses the ISO 639-3 
code for the precise language, in this case “lvs” for Standard Latvian.  This differs from Google Trans-

late, for example, which continues to use the two-letter code code for the dominant language in the 

macrolanguage grouping.  Other languages where similar questions arise include Estonian et/ekk, Ma-

lay ms/zsm, Albanian sq/als, Azari az/azj, Uzbek uz/uzn, Persian fa/pes, Guarani gn/gug, Swahili 

sw/swh. 

2.4 Closely related languages 

As we increasingly try to cater for minority languages and dialects, the questions of how to deal with 

closely related languages become ever greater.  On the one hand, we want to distinguish European 

Portuguese, currently coded as “pt”, and Brazilian Portuguese, “pt-BR”, especially if the dictionary 

site itself clearly distinguishes them among its language choices.  On the other hand, we don’t want 

users to be unable to find dictionaries which might be very useful to them, simply because of a small

21



difference in language code.  The “closely related languages” feature in the Multidict interface goes a 

very small way towards addressing this difficulty, but the problem requires more thought. 

A webpage
20

 available via the Multidict help system lists all the languages currently handled by 

Multidict.  It lists languages ordered by language family, then sub-family and so on.  Closely related 

languages are therefore located close together, and the webpage can be used to maintain Multidict’s 

tables of closely related languages.  To achieve this ordering, the Multidict database links each of its 

language codes to the corresponding LinguistList code, and holds a copy of the LinguistList Multi-

tree
21

 Composite Tree.  However, because the Composite Tree provides nothing but a tree structure, 

albeit a tremendously useful finely-detailed tree structure, it is in itself inadequate for defining the re-

quired linearization of the tree.  We always prefer to place the most closely related branches (closely 

related by geography if nothing else) adjacent to one another, rather than the children of each node 

being listed in some random order (as they currently are in Multitree itself, which places Baltic lan-

guages next to Celtic and Armenian, rather than next to Slavic).  To do this, in Multidict’s copy of the 

Composite Tree, we maintain, where relevant to Multidict, an ordering of the children of a parent 

node.  This has to be laboriously researched each time a language is added to Multidict.  It would be 

very useful if this ordering information were to be provided as a resource together with the Lin-

guistList Composite Tree. 

2.5 “n×n” dictionaries 

Most online dictionaries only handle a limited number of language pair (sl, tl) combinations, and 

each of these is given a separate record in the dictParam table.  However, some online dictionaries 

can translate  between any of n×n language pairs.  Most notably in recent years, Glosbe
22

 and Global 

Glossary
23

 translate surprisingly successfully between any pair out of hundreds of languages.  To har-

ness the tremendous power of these “n×n” dictionaries without cluttering the dictParam table with 

tens of thousands of records, the Multidict database uses the following tactic.  In the sl field in the 

dictParam table, a “¤” symbol is placed, and this indicates to Multidict to refer to a separate table 

dictLang to obtain a list of the n languages which this particular n×n dictionary handles.  The table 

can also translate between the language code used by Multidict and a different language code used by 

the dictionary.  In the dictParam table, the url required for linking to the dictionary can (as can also 

the POST parameters) contain placeholders for sl and tl, such as for example: 
http://friendlydic.org/find?from={sl}&to={tl}&facail={word} 

When Multidict looks up a word, it substitutes the relevant sl and tl.  The tl field in the dictParam 

record for the n×n dictionary also contains a “¤” symbol if this is truly an n×n dictionary, including 

monolingual pairs such as English-English.  If it is actually an “n×(n-1)” dictionary excluding mono-

lingual pairs, this is denoted by placing instead an “x” in the tl field. 

2.6 Quality ranking 

To try to place the “best” dictionaries at the top of the list in the user interface, and also to ensure that 

the “best” dictionary for the language-pair is used by default, the dictParam table stores a “quality” 

figure for each dictionary.  Of course, this is necessarily a compromise.  What is best for one purpose 

might not be best for another.  And things get messy when it comes to n×n dictionaries.  Multidict al-

ready records and defaults to the previous dictionary which the user used for that language-pair.  It 

might be best, instead of over-relying on a “quality” figure, to extend this recording system to the se-

cond and third most recent dictionaries used, or perhaps move to a system based on usage statistics. 

2.7 Web Archive dictionaries 

Online dictionary resources are often very scarce for minority languages.  However, many excellent 

old paper dictionaries are now available in page-image format on the Web Archive at 

www.archive.org24, and also on Google Books
25

.  The wonderful thing is that these dictionaries 

                                                 
20 http://multidict.net/multidict/languages.php 
21 http://multitree.linguistlist.org 
22 http://glosbe.com 
23 http://www.globalglossary.org 
24 https://archive.org/details/texts 

22



can be addressed by url on an individual page basis.  So all we need to do to make the dictionary 

available via Multidict is to provide Multidict with a table giving it the first word on every page of the 

dictionary.  Or actually, the last word on every page works slightly better because of the technicality 

that several headwords can have the same spelling.  Providing such a table sounds like a daunting task, 

but in fact, by getting very ergonomically organized the time can be reduced to a few seconds per 

page, meaning that even a 1000 page dictionary can be dealt with in a few hours.  To date, 23 such 

page-image dictionaries have been made available via Multidict (counting the reverse direction sepa-

rately in 5 cases), namely 8 for Scottish Gaelic; 2 Irish; 1 Old Irish; 3 Manx; 1 Cornish; 1 Old English; 

1 Middle English; 3 Nyanja and 3 Maori.  In total, about 55,000 pages have been indexed.  The big-

gest example is that all 4323 columns of the Old Irish eDIL
26

 dictionary have been indexed, and in fact 

eDIL is currently more usable for most purposes via Multidict than using its own native search inter-

face.  Although the native search will search the whole dictionary, which can sometimes be wonder-

fully useful, it will find nothing at all if the search word is not specified exactly as written in the dic-

tionary, including all accents and hyphens.  With the vagaries of Old Irish spelling, it can be more use-

ful to take the user to the right spot in alphabetic order as Multidict does, leaving him or her to com-

plete the search by eye. 

To enable access to these page-image dictionaries, Multidict uses two tables, dictPage which 

records the first (or last) word on every page, and dictPageURL which records the url templates 

required to translate these page numbers into urls.  The mechanism can also cope with dictionaries 

which are split into several volumes, as is Dwelly in the Web Archive .  A program dictpage.php 

does the job of redirecting the browser to the appropriate url. 

2.8 Statistics 

Multidict currently handles 271 different online dictionaries - there are 271 records in the dict table.  

The dictParam table has 2101 records covering 1041 language pairs, but the numbers would be tens of 

thousands higher if the n×n dictionaries Glosbe and Global Glossary were included.  Multidict current-

ly handles 202 languges, or 140 if the n×n dictionaries are excluded. 

3 Wordlink 

3.1 The interface 

In the example shown below, Wordlink is being used to view the Irish Wikipedia homepage.  At the 

top is the Wordlink navigation frame which is used for control.  Below that is a frame with what looks 

exactly like the Wikipedia page, but it is in fact a doctored version, with the html modifed by Word-

link to link every word to online dictionaries via Multidict, as shown on the right. 

 
Figure 2. The Wordlink interface 

 

                                                                                                                                                         
25 http://books.google.com 
26 http://edil.qub.ac.uk/dictionary/search.php 

23



Note (1) the url: 
http://multidict.net/wordlink/?sl=ga&url=http://ga.wikipedia.org/ 

which can be used to refer to the wordlinked page.  An additional paramater navsize=1 can be used 

to reduce the navigation frame away to 1 pixel size if it is not required.  If the url is specified in the 

form url=referer, the url is taken from the referer information in the http request.  This means 

that by adding a link of this form to every page of a website, each page is linked to a Wordlinked ver-

sion of itself for the benefit of language learners.  This can be seen in use on the Fòram na Gàidhlig
27

 

website. 

Note (2) the choice of mode, “Splitscreen” which causes Multidict and the dictionary results to be 
shown in a frame on the right.  Wordlink has three other choices of mode  available “New tab”, “Same 

tab” and “Popup”.  Although Splitscreen is the default and is overwhelmingly the most used, the other 

modes could actually be very useful on smaller screens. 

Note (3) the option to “Remove existing links”.  By default, Wordlink does not actually link every 
word to a dictionary lookup.  If you click on the word Dóitean, it will take you instead to a Word-
linked version of the Dóiteán Mór Londan Wikipedia page.  “Remove existing links” does what it says 
and will instead ensure you are taken to a dictionary lookup of  Dóiteán. 

Note (4) the Esc button.  Wordlink like Multidict makes it easy for you to escape from its frames to 
the webpage itself. 

Note (5) that the word ndeachaigh has been clicked on to find it in the dictionary, and it is therefore 
highlighted and remains highlighted until another word is clicked.  This small point is of major im-
portance.  Very often the user will need to scroll the dictionary information (as indeed in this exam-

ple), and it is essential that the word be highlighted to make it easy to look back and continue reading. 

Note (6) that although Multidict has been handed the wordform ndeachaigh by Wordlink, it has 
chosen instead to look up téigh, which it thinks is probably the appropriate “lemma”, the dictionary 
headword to look up, and it has also lined up a row of other lemma suggestions to be tried in turn if 

the user reclicks “ndeachaigh” or clicks “Go” in Multidict.  This new lemmatization feature built into 
Multidict has resulted in a big improvement in the user experience when using Wordlink and Clilstore.  

Some online dictionaries can do their own lemmatization, but many good dictionaries do not.  And 

even when the dictionary itself offers excellent lemmatization suggestions, as does Ó Dónaill28 in the 
example above, the new “click to retry” feature is so slick to use that it can be much quicker to just 

reclick and let Multidict do the work.  The feature is described more fully in section 3.4 below. 

3.2 The Wordlink program 

The Wordlink program, like all the facilities at multidict.net is written in PHP
29

.  It first sends 

off an HTTP request to fetch the webpage to be processed.  It then converts it to UTF-8 character en-

coding
30

 if it is not already in UTF-8, because all the facilities work internally entirely in UTF-8.  It 

then processes the page to (1) convert existing links into links to Wordlinked pages (if this has not 

been switched off by “Remove existing links”), and (2) convert each word in runs of text into a link to 

make Multidict look up that word.  We will not go into the details, but suffice it to say that it is not an 

easy task, and it is essential to ensure that relative links to images, stylesheets and Javascript libraries 

are all appropriately converted.  It currently works by processing the html serially, but it would proba-

bly be better to convert it to use an html parser and then traverse the resulting DOM tree. 

Wordlink does not work well with all webpages, particularly flashy games pages or TV company 

websites and suchlike.  But it produces good to excellent results with a good 90% of the more textual 

webpages likely to be of interest to language learners.  With well-behaved pages such as Wikipedia it 

works perfectly.  It does not work at all with webpages requiring a login, such as Facebook or pages in 

virtual-learning environments.  To do this would require it to store and forward user-credentials and 

would get us into the very iffy field of trust relationships.  Nor does it work with the https (secure http) 

protocol.

3.3 Word segmentation 

Wordlink links “words” to dictionaries, and for most languages it identifies words by the whitespace 

or punctuation characters surrounding them.  This means that it does not deal with collocations or 

phrases or even hyphenated words such as “trade-union”.  In such cases, the user can always type ad-

ditional text into the Multidict search box.  But it would be nice if some sort of Javascript or browser 

extension could be devised to allow the user to select phrases with the mouse and look them up. 

Breton and Catalan presented Wordlink with a slight problem, because “c’h” in Breton is regarded 
as a letter, as is “l·l” in Catalan, and at first Wordlink was splitting the word at what it thought was a 

punctuation character.  This was easily cured by a small change to the program. 

Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai webpages present it with the much bigger problem that these 

languages are normally written without any space between “words”.  However, we have newly built 

into it an interface with the Japanese word segmenter Mecab31.  This seems to be successful, and 
gives the spinoff  benefit that hovering over a Japanese word now displays its pronunciation in Hira-

gana.  Japanese learners have such a hard task to face with unknown Kanji that even partial success 

could be of tremendous benefit.  For Chinese, we managed to do the same with the Urheen32 word 
segmenter and the results seem to be good, but at the time of writing this is performing far too slowly 

to be useful and has been switched off.  The bother seems to be that Urheen does a lot of inefficient 

initialization every time it is called, but we might manage to find ways round this. 

3.4 The “lemmatization” facility in Multidict 

Although this belongs to Multidict as regards programming, it is described here because it is when 

Multidict is used together with Wordlink that all sorts of inflected wordforms are thrown at it.  We put 

“lemmatization” in inverted commas, because the facility is only semi-trying to produce grammatical 

lemmas.  Because it is only going to present the user with a string of possibilities, it does not need to 

go for grammatical purity and “headword suggestions” might be a better term than lemmas. 

The basis of this facility in Multidict for most source languages is the Hunspell33 spellchecker, 
which is the opensource spellchecker used by LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Firefox, etc.  Old-fashioned 

spellcheckers just had a long list of wordforms in a .dic file.  Hunspell, on the other hand, was origi-

nally developed for Hungarian which is a highly inflected language and works in a much more intelli-

gent way using also a .aff file (aff<affix).  The words in the .dic file can be labelled for grammatical 

category, and the .aff file contains the rules to produce a range of inflected wordforms relevant to that 

grammatical category.  The great thing is that we do not need to attempt to understand or reverse engi-

neer these rules.  Hunspell itself has built into it a function to return the possible lemmas correspond-

ing to any given wordform.  All we need to do is to pull in from the Internet the Hunspell .dic and .aff 

files for lots of languages, and this we have done. 

How successful Hunspell is at lemmatizing depends on the language and how Hunspell has been 

implemented for it.  It is possible for an implementer to just throw lots of wordforms into the .dic file 

and put very few rules in the .aff file.  Hunspell lemmatizes Basque very well, for example, but the 

current implementation does very little for German.  For Scottish Gaelic it was not great and for Irish 

not much better, and so we turned to another solution, the use of a lemmatization table. 
We were very fortunate and very grateful to be donated huge lemmatization tables for both Scottish 

Gaelic and Irish.  And a huge public domain table for Italian, Morph-it
34

 (Zanchetta and Baroni, 2005), 

was found on the Internet.  Smaller batches added to this include the Old Irish verbforms from In Dúil 

Bélrai
35

; tables from the Internet converting between en-US and en-GB English spelling; and tables 

converting between pre-Caighdeán and post-Caighdeán Irish spelling.  These form the basis of an al-

ternative method of lemmatization which Multidict has at its disposal, namely the lemmas table in the 

Multidict database which currently has 1.4 million wordforms.  These can be labelled with the “batch”

field, which can be used for example to denote those to be given priority, or those to be applied only 

for certain dictionaries. 

Algorithmic “lemmatization” provides yet another tool in Multidict’s lemmatization armoury.  
Again this is divided into a “priority” algorithm to be used first, and a non-priority algorithm.  The 

priority algorithm includes the removal of initial mutations from Irish and Scottish Gaelic words, be-

cause this is nearly always something sensible to do.  The non-priority algorithm includes throwing 

out any final ‘s’ from English words, because this is normally a last resort when the word has not been 

recognized by Hunspell.  The non-priority algorithm includes crude attempts to lemmatize words in 

the p-celtic languages, Welsh, Cornish and Breton, by naively changing the initial letter. 

It turns out to be rather crucial, especially for Irish and Scottish Gaelic, to have priority records in 

the the lemmas table for the lemmatization of irregular verbs, otherwise many of them would not be 
recognised after initial mutation was removed.  This has been done, and all the prepositional pronouns 

have been added too.  This is something we really ought to do for every language: namely feed into 

the lemmatization table all the irregular verbs, irregular nouns, etc, because Hunspell deals with these 

rather poorly.  Hunspell’s priorities and ours are different.  Its priority is to reduce the size of the .dic 

file by placing rules for regular verbs and nouns in the .aff file.  Irregular verbforms take up relatively 

little space in the .dic file, so it just throws them in there and doesn’t help us at all to lemmatize them.  

Multidict now has in place a very sophisticated, flexible mechanism for lemmatization, pulling in as 

required the different tools at its disposal.  It would be good if experts for individual languages could 

co-operate to help implement and tailor these tools for each particular language. 

The default “wfrule” string which Multidict uses to generate headword suggestions for a particular 

wordform is “lemtable~pri|prialg|self|lemtable|hun|lemalg”.  What this means in 

plain English is: concatenate the lists of headword suggestions produced by (1) those labelled “pri” in 

the lemmas table, (2) those produced by the priority algorithm, (3) the wordform itself, (4) those with 

no batch label in lemmas, (5) those provided by Hunspell, and (6) those produced by the non-priority 

algorithm.  The | operator not only concatenates but causes duplicates to be removed from the list.  

However, different “wfrule” strings can be applied for different languages and dictionaries.  As well as 

the | operator, there is another operator > which causes the array of  suggestions generated by the pre-

vious rule to be used as input to a following rule.  And brackets ( ) can also be used in this “algebra”. 

3.5 Beware of robots 

In any publicly available facility such as Wordlink which can take any webpage and process it to pro-

duce another, it is essential to be very careful about robots.txt
36

 and robots meta tags in the html 

header.  At one point the server hosting multidict.net was running very slowly and on investigation it 

was found that Google was attempting to spider and index the entire Internet via Wordlink!  The links 

on one Wordlinked webpage were leading it to other Wordlinked webpages.  It took months before it 

completely stopped. 

4 Clilstore 

Clilstore is the most recent of the three facilities.  It makes it easy for teachers to harness the power of 

Wordlink and Multidict, by adding teaching “units” to the openly available online “store”.  The formu-

la which has been found to be most successful has been a video or soundfile together with a transcript, 

and perhaps some exercises to test student understanding.  Clilstore itself stores the text, and can store 

attachment files of limited size.  But storing the video or soundfile is left to the very many media host-

ing services available on the Internet, such as Youtube, Vimeo, TED, Teachertube, Ipadio and 

Soundcloud, from where they can be very easily added to the Clilstore unit by using the embed code 

supplied by the hosting service.  This avoids us getting into large storage requirements, and hives off 

any copyright questions to services with mechanisms in place to deal with infringements. 

Each unit is labelled with a level, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 or C2, from the Common European Frame-

work of Reference for languages (CEFR
37

).  The index provides a rich facility for searching by words

in the title or text, and for searching or ordering by language, CEFR, media length, number of words, 

number of views, etc.  A wysiwyg editor, TinyMCE38, provides a facility for authors to produce rich 
colourful units without getting involved in html, although an html editor is also available. 

To date (2014-06-24), Clilstore has 1072 units (excluding test units) in 49 different languages.  The 

biggest number (416) are in English, but there are 116 in Arabic, 101 in Scottish Gaelic, 65 in Slove-

nian, 51 in Irish, 40 in Portuguese, 38 in Spanish, 34 in Italian, 27 in Lithuanian, 26 in German, 22 in 

Danish.  There is even one, complete with soundfile in Old Irish.  Clilstore and Wordlink work fine 

with right-to-left languages such as Arabic, although good online dictionaries are still rather lacking 

for Arabic.  Statistics show that the units have had so far over 203,000 views in total.  Perhaps more 

interestingly and reliably, in the 3 months since we started collecting such statistics, there have  been 

6773 clicks (dictionary lookups) on words in Clilstore units. 

Experience from workshops for Gaelic language summer courses
39

 at various levels at Sabhal Mòr 

Ostaig shows that the Clilstore facility is most useful to intermediate level learners.  Advanced users 

find it very useful too, as a store of videos and transcripts, but tend to click fairly seldom because they 

can understand well enough from context anyway.  Learners coming from cognate languages with 
somewhat different spelling rules such as Irish learners of Scottish Gaelic find it particularly useful, as 

was seen on the summer courses on Scottish Gaelic for Irish speakers at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. 

5 Conclusion 

The facilities described here work, have proved their worth
40

, and are freely and openly available.  

Much more could be done to develop them, of course.  The interface is entirely through English at pre-

sent, which is not good when trying to provide an immersion environment for Gaelic students, for ex-

ample.  Nor is good for Italian students at a Portuguese university, to have to go through an English 

interface to access Portuguese units.  It would be good to internationalize the programs and provide 

localized interfaces. 

Multidict and Wordlink use old-fashioned html frames
41

, which have no support in modern stand-

ards
42

, although they work well for the job in hand.  It would be good to investigate switching to 

iframes
43

, although this would require increasing use of Javascript libraries for resizing. 

Users can and do recommend new dictionaries for Multidict, but it would be good to develop this 

into more of a community facility.

 project.  Clilstore 

was developed, and Multidict and Wordlink further developed under TOOLS
46

 project financed by the 

EC’s Lifelong Learning Programme.  Much of the credit for their development goes to the sugges-

tions, user testing and feedback by the project teams from 9 different European countries, and in par-

ticular to the project leader Kent Andersen.  Wordlink was inspired by Kent’s Textblender program.
