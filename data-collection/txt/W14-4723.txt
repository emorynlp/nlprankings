Abstract 

Terminological resources have traditionally focused on terms referring to entities, thereby ignoring other 

important concepts (processes, events and properties) in specialized fields of knowledge. Consequently, 

large parts of the conceptual structure of these fields are not taken into consideration nor represented. In 

this article, we show how terms that refer to processes and events (and, to a lesser extent, properties) can 

be characterized using Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) and the methodology developed within the 

FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). More specifically, we applied the framework to a subset of 

terms in the field of the environment. Frames are unveiled first by comparing similarities between the 

argument structures of terms already recorded in a terminological database and the relationships they 

share with other terms. A comparison is also carried out with the lexical units recorded in FrameNet. 

Then, relations between frames are defined that allow us to build small conceptual scenarios that are 

specific to the field of the environment. These relations are determined on the basis of the set of 

relations listed in the FrameNet project. This article reports on the methodology, the frames defined up 

to now and two specific conceptual scenarios (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste). 

1 Introduction 

Traditionally, terminological resources have been designed as knowledge repositories and until 

recently the focus has been placed on finding ways to represent the knowledge conveyed by terms. In 

fact, in several terminological applications, terms are viewed as the linguistic components of 

knowledge structures (i.e. linguistic labels attached to nodes that represent concepts). This perspective 

has led to the design of domain ontologies (or less formal structures) in which concepts are linked via 

a network of relations (is-a, part-of, cause-effect, etc) and terms are disambiguated linguistic labels 

assigned to these concepts. 

However, it has been pointed out that, although interesting, these knowledge structures have 

important drawbacks as far as linguistic aspects are concerned: 1. They tend to focus on terms that 

denote entities (expressed by nouns) and little consideration is given to processes and events; 2. Other 

types of units that could be relevant for terminology, such as predicative terms (that designate 

processes, events and properties) are not represented in a way that fully captures their meaning; 

3. They either overlook the linguistic properties of terms altogether, or linguistic properties (such as 

variation) are taken into account in a peripheral component of the representation. 

An increasing number of researchers proposed alternative methods to add linguistic components to 

terminological knowledge structures (Faber, 2006, 2012; Montiel et al., 2010, among others). Others 

have developed methods to describe terms as linguistic units with frameworks designed for the lexicon 

in general. An interesting aspect of this latter work is the consideration given to terms that have been 

overlooked in knowledge structures, i.e. predicative terms and more specifically verbs (Condamines 

1993; Lerat 2002; L’Homme 1998; Lorente 2002). 

It is generally recognized that both the relationship with knowledge and linguistic properties are 

important aspects of terminological description, and methods should be developed to merge them into 

resources. However, it seems that terminologists still struggle to find an adequate balance between 

conceptual and linguistic representations (L’Homme, 2014). One possible solution resides in frames or 

frame-like representations that attract the interest of an increasing number of researchers (Dolbey 

et al., 2006; Faber, 2006, 2012; Schmidt 2009, among others, see Section 3).

This is the solution we chose in this paper. More specifically, we applied principles based on Frame 

Semantics (Fillmore, 1982, 1985; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and the methodology developed within 

the FrameNet project (Fillmore et al., 2003; Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) to linguistic data related to the 

field of the environment. A first part of this work was reported in L’Homme et al. (2014), in which 

frames were defined based on the contents of a resource containing environment terms (e.g., change, 

impact, recycle). In this paper, we summarize our methodology to discover frames, and report on what 

has been done to define relations between frames and build conceptual scenarios that represent 

processes and events in the field. We then describe two specific scenarios that apply to the field of the 

environment (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste). 

2 Theoretical assumptions and motivations 

Processes and events represent an important part of the set of concepts to be represented in many 

fields of knowledge. This is the case in environment where events (e.g., “storm”, “melt”, and 

“warming”) and processes (e.g., “damage”, “threaten”) can be observed. However, traditional 

terminological models (and even less traditional ones, such as ontological representations) are not 

properly equipped to describe these concepts and account for their specific linguistic properties, 

namely the fact that they require arguments (X changes Y; impact of X on Y). 

Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and its related application FrameNet 

(Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) are specifically adapted to account for these concepts and offer different 

means to represent their conceptual as well as their linguistic properties. Frame Semantics (FS) is 

based on the assumption that the meanings of lexical units (LUs) are constructed in relation to 

background knowledge, whose structure can be analyzed in terms of semantic frames. Frames are 

conceptual scenarios in which different participants (called frame elements, FEs) appear. For instance, 

the Criminal_investigation frame is defined as follows in FrameNet: This frame describes the 

process that involves the determination by an authority, the Investigator, of the circumstances 

surrounding an Incident by means of inquiry. 

The frame states that there are three obligatory participants in this scenario (FEs): Investigator, 

Incident, and Suspect (other non-obligatory participants – non-core FEs – are also listed). Lexical 

units such as clue.n, inquire.v, inquiry.n, investigate.v, investigation.n evoke this frame. These lexical 

units and their participants are also annotated in selected sentences, thus linking the conceptual and 

linguistic representations levels of the description, as shown below for the verb investigate: 

 NP police, sheriff, officer-T-(1) 

About 30 adults were arrested in raids on ten Children of God homes on Wednesday night by 

[Investigator police] INVESTIGATING 
Target

 [Incident claims of child abuse]. [Suspect INI] 

[Investigator Anti-terrorist officers] were quickly on the scene and INVESTIGATING 
Target

 

[Incident the further reports of suspect devices]. [Suspect INI] 

 T-NP allegation-(1) 

The Botswana government says that [Investigator it] will INVESTIGATE 
Target

 [Incident the torture 

allegations]. [Suspect INI] 

 T-NP case-(1) 

[Investigator The union] is also INVESTIGATING 
Target

 [Incident a number of cases of child labour 

and the sexual abuse of children by employers]. [Suspect INI] 

Frames can share relationships with other frames as shown in Figure 1. Criminal_investigation is a 

subframe of Crime_scenario, it is preceded by Committing_crime and precedes Criminal_process. 

We believe that frames are well suited to represent the properties of predicative terms: annotations 

serve to capture their linguistic properties and link these properties to an abstract representation level, 

i.e. the frame. Furthermore, and this is what is explored in this paper, relations between frames, can 

help unveil larger conceptual scenarios in which these terms are involved. In FrameNet, some subject-

specific frames can already be found, as shown below (Figure 1) with Crime_scenario and other 

related frames. 

187



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We assume that this can be applied to the frames of a specialized field such as the environment. 

However, we believe that the specialized lexicon will display some characteristics that will result in 

the necessity to define specific frames and perhaps specific scenarios. We explore this on a subset of 

data that is presented in Section 4. 

3 Related work 

In addition to projects aiming to describe the general lexicon in English (FrameNet, 2014), and in 

other languages, such as German, Japanese, and Spanish (Boas, 2009), an increasing number of 

researchers in terminology or related fields suggest that Frame Semantics (FS) or compatible 

frameworks are well suited to describe terms. 

In Dolbey et al. (2006), Frame Semantics is adapted in order to develop frames in the field of 

biomedicine and link these frames to existing ontologies. Another application in medicine can be 

found in Wandji et al. (2013) where authors attempt to discover frames in the field with natural 

language processing techniques and an external resource (a medical terminology). Schmidt (2009) 

introduced some adaptations to the original framework of FS to account for multilingual data (English, 

French and German) in the field of soccer. Pimentel (2013) used the framework to establish 

equivalence relationships between English and Portuguese verbs in the field of law. L’Homme (2012) 

describes an annotation module added to two terminological resources (computing and environment) 

that is based on the annotation methodology developed within the FrameNet project. Finally, Faber 

(2012) refers to FS in order to account for concepts in the field of the environment and proposes a 

general frame (the environment event) to represent the interrelated processes and events observed in 

the field. The proposal has led to an approach in terminology called Frame-based terminology. 

The work reported in this article bears some similarities with and differs from the work cited above 

in the following ways: 1. Contrary to some of this work, frames are discovered after terms are 

described rather than postulated prior to the descriptive work (we took a strictly bottom-up approach); 

2. Frames are defined by observing similarities between terms (Sections 4.2 and 4.3); 3. Relations 

between frames are based on those already defined in FrameNet, but they must be valid from the point 

of view of the field of the environment. Hence, some differences are likely to be observed with similar 

frames appearing in FrameNet or with frames defined for other fields of knowledge. 

4 Methodology 

This section describes the data used in this work (extracted from a terminological database), and the 

different steps taken to unveil semantic frames and relations between them. 

4.1 The terminological database 

Our analysis is based on data recorded in an existing terminological database that contains terms in the 

field of the environment (it covers four subfields: climate change, residual material management, 

Figure 1. Crime_scenario and related frames in FrameNet (2014) 

188



 

 

electric transportation, and renewable energy).
1
 The database – compiled chiefly according to the 

principles of Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’čuk et al., 1995) – contains terms in 

English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. Entries provide a description of the lexico-semantic 

properties of terms (Figure 2): actantial (i.e. argument) structure, linguistic realizations of actants (i.e. 

arguments), and lexical relationships (including paradigmatic relationships and collocations). 

 

 

Terms recorded in the database are nouns (Eng. biodiversity, energy; Fr. bioénergie, 

environnement), verbs (Eng. erode, pollute; Fr. électrifier, incinérer), adjectives (Eng. anthropogenic, 

global; Fr. aride, vert) or adverbs (Eng. globally, locally). In this work, we took into account verbs, 

nouns (that refer to events or processes) and a small set of adjectives (e.g., Eng. absorb, concentration, 

threatened; Fr. menacé, réchauffer, tri). A subset of 169 English terms and 205 French terms 

underwent the analysis described in the following subsections. 

4.2 Annotated contexts 

In the database, several predicative terms (and all those that were selected for this analysis) come with 

up to 20 annotated sentences. The annotation is based on the methodology developed within the 

FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). The original objectives of the annotations were twofold: 

1. Show how actants (i.e. arguments) stated in the actantial (i.e. argument) structure are realized 

linguistically; 2. Supply terminologists writing entries with linguistic evidence to support their 

intuitions. 

In annotations (Figure 3), the predicative unit appears in capital letters and in bold. Participants are 

divided into two different types: actants (in bold) correspond to obligatory participants (roughly 

equivalent to FN’s core frame elements); circumstants are non-obligatory participants (that correspond 

roughly to non-core FEs). Participants appear in different colors according to their role (Cause, 

Patient, etc.). A table summarizes the different patterns found in annotations. 

The major challenges for the environment today are climate change, the decline in biodiversity, the 

THREAT to our health from pollution, the way in which we use natural resources and the 

production of too much waste. [CHANG_1EUROPAENV 0 TK MCLH 19/07/2012] 

Changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events could pose a serious 

THREAT to human health. [CHANG_VULNERABILITY 0 TK MCLH 19/07/2012] 

The specific THREAT to some of these ecosystems is discussed in detail elsewhere in this paper.

1 The database is enriched on an ongoing basis. Hence, some terms can be added to frames already defined. 

Other subfields will also be taken into account in the future.

4.3 Identification of frames 

In a previous study (L’Homme et al. 2014), we analyzed data contained in an environment database to 

establish whether some lexical units could be associated with frames similar to those that are recorded 

in FrameNet or potentially lead to new ones. The methodology for discovering frames consists 

basically in: 1. Extracting relevant data from the environment database; and 2. Using FrameNet data 

(in English) as a reference to identify a first set of existing frames that the terms in our database could 

evoke. A set of tools were devised to help us carry out the analysis. 

Identifying similarities between terms encoded in the environment database 

The first tool we use is a script that extracts relevant data from the English and French versions of the 

environment database and presents it in two separate sortable tables (where the sort function was 

programmed to fit specific criteria). These tables are helpful as they bring together, flatten and sort 

information that is normally distributed in different entries of the database. Along with the terms and 

their part of speech, the following information is presented in additional columns (Figure 4). 

 

 Semantic roles of actants placed in four consecutive columns and in the order in which they 
appear in the actantial structure of the term entries; 

 Semantic roles of circumstants extracted from the annotated contexts associated with the terms, 
ordered and displayed in a fifth column; 

 A frame name (taken from an extra file used aside the database entries). This name was added 
once it was defined by the terminologist that carried out the analysis (see Section 4.3.4); 

Figure 4. Data presenting frame-relevant information for English terms

 Verbs and nouns associated with the LUs through specific collocation relationships in a last 
column.

Identifying similarities between terms encoded in the DiCoEnviro 

In addition to the tables described in Section 4.3.1, another script was written to present a comparison 

page that contains information related to terms from the environment database along with LUs 

recorded in FrameNet. Each English entry of the environment database is first searched in the last 

release of the FrameNet data (Baker and Hung, 2010)
3
, and presented side by side with the 

corresponding lexical units from FrameNet when matches are found (Figure 5). More specifically, the 

script retrieves the following information: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 From FrameNet: definitions of frames, their core and non-core FEs, relationships these frames 
have with other frames, and finally the annotated contexts accompanying the LUs themselves. 

A series of hyperlinks are also provided so that the terminologist analyzing the data can refer to 

FrameNet whenever necessary. 

 From the environment database: actantial structures (i.e. showing the list of actants associated 
with the terms), the annotated contexts, and incidentally, for further stages of the analysis, the 

French and Spanish equivalents. 

Differences between FrameNet and environment database 

When comparing the data extracted from the environment database and FrameNet, we needed to take 

into consideration that the two resources bear some theoretical as well as methodological differences. 

We summarize them below: 

 In FrameNet, FEs are defined at the level of frames while, in environment database, actants (and 
circumstants) are stated at the level of LUs. We established that terms in the environment 
database could evoke an existing frame if a relationship could be established between the set of 
core FEs and the actants, and if the FEs and actants were represented with comparable labels. 

                                                 
2
 Lexical relationships are represented in the database with lexical functions (LFs), a system developed in 

Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’čuk et al., 1995). In the online version, a natural language 

explanation is proposed (Figure 2): this explanation “translates” LFs’ expressiveness in a way that is more 

accessible to users. 
3
 For this, we used the XML files supplied by the FrameNet team. However, we noticed some differences with 

the online version of FrameNet: we needed to check whether the information had been updated. 

Figure 5. Comparison of environment terms with LUs in FrameNet 

 

191



 

 

 Secondly, due to the objectives of each resource, the number of core FEs in a frame could differ 
in comparison with the number of actants represented for a term in the environment database. 
Often, the number of core FEs was higher than the number of actants. In some cases, the 
environment database defines a participant as being a circumstant and a correspondence could 
be established with FrameNet. In other cases, the specificity of the specialized domain needed 
to be taken into consideration. 

 Thirdly, labels used for most FEs are very specific since they are defined within a frame. In the 
environment database, labels are general and defined for the entire set of terms that are included 
in the database. In these cases, we generalized some of the labels. For example, labels such as 
Entity, Item, Theme, and Undergoer in FrameNet were assumed to correspond to Patient in the 
environment database. 

 Fourthly, in FrameNet, different labels can account for an FE that would be realized in the same 
syntactic function. In the environment database, actants can be split (Agent or Cause for 
instance). In both cases, we considered these as being instantiations of the same argument 
position. 

Assigning terms to frames 

To make explicit the association of terms to 

frames (already recorded in FrameNet or 

especially created for the field of the 

environment), but also to facilitate the pairwise 

comparison of actants with FEs, we created an 

auxilary XML file aside from the files used to 

encode entries in the database (rather than 

adding this information in each terminological 

entry). Throughout the analysis, the file was 

enriched with additional information such as 

definitions and examples specific to the field 

of the environment, and relations frames have 

with other frames discovered or created (see 

Section 4.4). 

Once created, the file can be loaded by the 

scripts mentioned earlier and used to help the 

analysis as it can be passed down to the 

comparison of terms and LUs. A comparison 

of actants and FEs is shown Figure 6. 

4.4 Frames discovered for environment terms 

In L’Homme et al. (2014), we had analyzed 105 English and 159 French terms. This first set of data 

allowed us to find that some LUs were equivalent to frames already recorded in FrameNet; but that 

new frames also needed to be defined. 

Currently, the different frames defined and the terms that evoke them appear in Table 1. The 

difference between English and French simply reflect the fact that more terms have been analyzed in 

French and in English up to now.  

 

 Entirely compatible: The description of the terms in the environment database and the 
frames in FrameNet are similar (the number of actants vs. FEs and their semantic type is 

basically the same). For instance, threaten (Agent or Cause ~ Patient) evokes the 

Endangering frame (An Agent or Cause is responsible for placing a Valued_entity at 

risk).
4
 

                                                 
4
 Even if these frames are entirely compatible with those described in FrameNet, some differences are worth 

mentioning (in addition to those already taken into consideration when comparing the data, see Section 4.3.3). 

First, frames described in the environment database are much more restricted that those appearing in FrameNet 

Figure 6. Comparison of FEs in FrameNet and 

actants in the environment database 

 

192



 

 

 Alternation: This category was created for cases where the environment database 
distinguishes two separate entries for closely related LUs. For instance, predict1a (Method ~ 

Patient) and Predict1b (Agent ~ Patient with Method) evoke a single frame, i.e. Predicting 

(An Agent states or makes known a Patient based on a Method; FN. A Speaker states or 

makes known a future Eventuality on the basis of some Evidence).

Table 1: Different frames defined and number of LUs 

 Partly compatible: The description of the terms in the environment database and the 
frames described in FrameNet are not exactly the same (the numbers of actants vs. frame 

elements differ). For instance, risk has three actants (~ of Result on Patient from Cause) and 

evokes the Run_risk frame, but the original frame has four core frame elements (Action, 

Asset, Bad_outcome, and Protagonist). 

 New: Sets of new frames were defined for cases in which no existing frame could be found 
or cases where an existing frame was not well adapted for the environment. For instance, a 

new frame was created to LUs such as recycle and recycling, i.e. Preparing_for_reuse. 

 Pending: Some LUs have been assigned to frames only provisionally for a number of 
reasons (few occurrences in the corpus, only one LU in the frame, etc.). 

4.5 Identification of relations between frames 

It soon became obvious that some frames defined for the field of the environment were related 

conceptually. We determined these relations using as a starting point the set of relations defined in the 

FrameNet project: these relations were sought in our data. We assumed that they would be valid – at  

least in part – for  the domain of the environment, since they had been defined on a substantial amount 

of data. 

This allowed us to discover conceptual scenarios specific to the field. In Table 2, we first describe 

the list of FrameNet relations taken into account and relations that are defined for the purpose of this 

project.   

Relations used to link frames 

The list of relations based on FrameNet are listed in Table 2.
6
  

                                                                                                                                                         
and the terms that evoke these frames may correspond to subsenses or microsenses (as defined by Cruse, 2011). 

For instance, the Being_at_risk frame in the environment applies only to things such as species, ecosystems, 

plants, etc. In addition, the number of terms that evoke a frame is often much lower than those recorded in 

FrameNet. For instance, the terms evoking the Being_at_risk frame in the environment data are the following: 

sensitivity, threatened, vulnerability, vulnerable (whereas in FrameNet, the list comprises: danger.n, insecure.a, 

risk.n, safe.a, safety.n, secure.a, security.n, unsafe.a, vulnerability.n, vulnerable.a). 
5
 The alternation can be illustrated with the following examples: Even the most sophisticated models cannot 

predict the details of how the climate change will unfold; it is also possible that our models will better enable us 

to predict the consequences.   
6
 Here, some differences with the way relations are defined in FrameNet are probably present. This part of the 

analysis is based on our interpretation of the way relations are defined in Ruppenhofer et al. (2010), the ones that 

appear in FrameNet and our own data.

Table 2: Relations between frames of the field of environment 

In addition to the relations based on those defined in the FrameNet project, we added new ones to 

capture some important conceptual perspective in the field of the environement: 

 Is opposed to: This relation was established between the Recover and the Removing frames. 

 Is a property of (has property): This relation was established between the 
Judgment_of_intensity (with LUs such as intense, extreme, severe) and the Weather_event 

frames (the latter one comprises LUs such as event, activity).

Up to now, among the 73 frames defined for the environment data, and about 70 are linked with one 

or two of the relations listed in this section. A small number of frames are linked provisionally with 

the See also relation. This simply indicates that a relation is present but its labelling is pending. 

Displaying relations 

After the creation of the auxiliary XML file recording the terms membership to frames described in 

Section 4.3.4, a search interface was designed and programmed to provide a more user-friendly access 

to its information.   

 

 
Figure 7: Display of the information associated to a frame in the field of environment 

 

This interface allows us to select or search frames themselves, as well as terms or actantial roles. 

Search results display definitions, examples and notes associated to frames, their participants, together 

with lists of terms that evoke them. As in the FrameGrapher in FrameNet, rather than simply listing 

the relations that frames share with others frames, we present them as graphs (Figures 8 and 10). This 

provides a more comprehensive view of broader sets of frames and makes it easier to unveil some 

scenarios that we believe are specific to the field of the environment. 

5 Two scenarios in the field of the environment 

In this section, we describe two small conceptual scenarios that were discovered thanks to the 

establishment of relations described in Section 4. The first is the Risk_scenario that also appears in 

FrameNet. The second one is Managing_waste that has no direct counterpart in FrameNet (even 

though some frames appear to correspond to frames recorded in FrameNet). Other scenarios are in the 

process of being defined. 

5.1 Risk_scenario 

The Risk_scenario discovered on the basis of the data extracted from the environment database 

appears in Figure 8. We also reproduced the scenario proper to FrameNet in Figure 9 to highlight 

some of their differences. 

The Risk_scenario in the field of the environment represents the potential threats to the ecosystem 

and some of its components. It also shows how the human (although responsible for most of these 

threats) takes measures to prevent some of them. 

Interestingly, the Risk_scenario unveiled using data taken from an environment corpus and 

database shares some similarities, but also some differences with the one appearing in FrameNet. For

instance, the Wagering frame (that comprises LUs such as bet and wager) was completely irrelevant 

for the environment. Conversely, a Preserve_in_original_state was defined for the environment data 

for terms such as Eng. conserve, and Fr. conservation, préserver. 

 

 

5.2 Managing_waste 

The Managing_waste scenario was also defined based on the terms related to residual waste 

management. This scenario shows the different processes involved in managing waste and the order in 

which they are performed: first 

waste is collected, then it is 

separated; afterwards, it can be 

recovered or discarded. If waste is 

removed, it can then undergo 

incineration or landfilling. On the 

other hand, if waste is recovered, it 

is either recycled, composed or 

processed. 

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, we presented a 

methodology to discover alternative 

conceptual structures for 

terminology. They complement 

structures often used to represent 

entity concepts (i.e. domain 

ontologies) and are well suited to 

account for terms denoting 

processes, events, and properties. 

The methodology, based on 

principles borrowed from Frame Semantics and its implementation in FrameNet, was applied to 

English and French terms that are related to the field of the environment. It allowed us to unveil 

frames that are similar to those recorded in FrameNet, but also new ones that might be specific to the 

specialized field we chose to describe. It also allows us to represent small conceptual scenarios.
