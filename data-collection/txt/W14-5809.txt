Abstract

We present two approaches to automatically acquire morphologically related words from Wik-
tionary. Starting with related words explicitly mentioned in the dictionary, we propose a method
based on orthographic similarity to detect new derived words from the entries’ definitions with
an overall accuracy of 93.5%. Using word pairs from the initial lexicon as patterns of formal
analogies to filter new derived words enables us to rise the accuracy up to 99%, while extending
the lexicon’s size by 56%. In a last experiment, we show that it is possible to semantically type
the morphological definitions, focusing on the detection of process nominals.

1 Introduction

Around the 1980s the computational exploitation of machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) for the au-
tomatic acquisition of lexical and semantic information enjoyed a great favor in NLP (Calzolari et al.,
1973; Chodorow et al., 1985). MRDs’ definitions provided robust and structured knowledge from which
semantic relations were automatically extracted for linguistic studies (Markowitz et al., 1986) and lin-
guistic resources development (Calzolari, 1988). Today the scenario has changed as corpora have become
the main source for semantic knowledge acquisition. However, dictionaries are regaining some interest
thanks to the availability of public domain dictionaries, especially Wiktionary.

In the present work, we describe a method to create a morphosemantic and morphological French
lexicon from Wiktionary’s definitions. This type of large coverage resource is not available for almost
all languages, with the exception of the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) for English, German and
Dutch, a paid resource distributed by the LDC.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reports related work on semantic and morphological
acquisition from MRDs. In Section 3, we describe how we converted Wiktionnaire, the French language
edition of Wiktionary, into a structured XML-tagged MRD which contains, among other things, defini-
tions and morphological relations. In Section 4, we explain how we used Wiktionnaire’s morphological
sections to create a lexicon of morphologically related words. The notion of morphological definitions
and their automatic identification are introduced in Section 5. In Section 6, we show how these defini-
tions enable us to acquire new derived words and enrich the initial lexicon. Finally, Section 7 describes
an experiment where we semantically typed process nouns definitions.

Semantic relations are usually acquired using corpora (Curran and Moens, 2002; van der Plas and Bouma,
2005; Heylen et al., 2008) but may also be acquired from MRDs. MRDs-based approaches are bound
to the availability of such resources. However, for some languages including French, no such resource
exists. Recent years have seen the development of large resources built automatically by aggregating
and/or translating data originating from different sources. For example, Sagot and Fišer (2008) have
built WOLF, “a free French Wordnet” and Navigli and Ponzetto (2010) BabelNet, a large multilingual
semantic network. Such resources tend to favor coverage over reliability and may contain errors and

inaccuracy, or be incomplete. Pierrel (2013), while criticizing these resources, describes the digitization
process of the Trésor de la Langue Française, a large printed French dictionary. The first impulse of this
long-course reverse-engineering project is described in (Dendien, 1994) and resulted in the TLFi, a fine-
grained XML-structured dictionary. Pierrel advocates mutualization, recommends resources sharing and
underlines how the use of the TLFi would be relevant for NLP. Though we totally agree on this assertion,
we deplore that the resource, being only available for manual use and not for download, prevents its use
for NLP.

Crowdsourcing has recently renewed the field of lexical resources development. For example Lafour-
cade (2007) designed JeuxDeMots, a game with a purpose, to collect a great number of relations between
words. Other works use the content of wikis produced by crowds of contributors. Initially in the shadow
of Wikipedia, the use of Wiktionary tends to grow in NLP studies since its exploitation by Zesch et al.
(2008). Its potential as an electronic lexicon was first studied by Navarro et al. (2009) for English and
French. The authors leverage the dictionary to build a synonymy network and perform random walks to
find missing links. Other works tackled data extraction: Anton Pérez et al. (2011) for instance, describe
the integration of the Portuguese Wiktionary and Onto.PT; Sérasset (2012) built Dbnary, a multilingual
network containing “easily extractable” entries. If the assessment of Wiktionary’s quality from a lex-
icographic point of view has not been done yet, Zesch and Gurevych (2010) have shown that lexical
resources built by crowds lead to results comparable to those obtained with resources designed by pro-
fessionals, when used to compute semantic relatedness of words. In Sajous et al. (2013a), we created an
inflectional and phonological lexicon from Wiktionary and showed that its quality is comparable to those
of reference lexicons, while the coverage is much wider.

Comparatively little effort has been reported in literature on the exploitation of semantic relations to
automatically identify morphological relations. Schone and Jurafsky (2000) learn morphology with a
method based on semantic similarity extracted by latent semantic analysis. Baroni et al. (2002) combine
orthographic (string edit distances) and semantic similarity (words’ contextual information) in order to
discover morphologically related words. Along the same line, Zweigenbaum and Grabar (2003) ac-
quire semantic information from a medical corpus and use it to detect morphologically derived words.
More recently, Hathout (2008) uses the TLFi to discover morphologically related words by combining
orthographic and semantic similarity with formal analogy.

I another work, Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) present a method to automatically extract
morphological relations from the definitions of MRDs. The authors automatically identify classes of
morphologically related words by comparing the semantic information in the entry of the derivative
with the information stored in the candidate base form. This effort shows the crucial importance and the
potential of the MRDs’ definitions to acquire and discover morphological relationships of derived words.

3 Turning the French Wiktionary into a Machine-Readable Dictionary

As mentioned is section 2, the quality of collaboratively constructed resources has already been assessed
and we will not debate further the legitimacy of leveraging crowdsourced data for NLP purpose. We give
below a brief description of Wiktionary1 and of the process of converting it into a structured resource.

Wiktionary is divided in language editions. Each language edition is regularly released as a so-called
XML dump.2 The “XML” mention is somewhat misleading because it suggests that XML markups
encode the articles’ microstructure whereas only the macrostructure (articles’ boundaries and titles) is
marked by XML tags. Remaining information is encoded in wikicode, an underspecified format used by
the MediaWiki content-management system. As explained by Sajous et al. (2013b) and Sérasset (2012),
this loose encoding format makes it difficult to extract consistent data. One can choose to either restrict
the extraction to prototypical articles or design a fine-grained parser that collects the maximum of the
available information. The former goal is relatively easily feasible but leads to a resource containing only
a small subset of Wiktionary’s entries. Our belief is that the tedious engineering work of handling all

wikicode particularities is valuable. In our case, it enabled us to design an unprecedented large copylefted
lexicon that has no equivalent for French.

The basic unit of Wiktionary’s articles is the word form: several words from different languages having
the same word form occur in the same page (at the same URL). In such a page, a given language section
may be divided in several parts of speech which may in turn split into several homonyms subsections.
In the French Wiktionary, the course entry, for example, describes both the French and English lexemes.
The French section splits into a noun section (une course ‘a run; a race’) and a section related to the
inflected forms of the verb courser ‘to pursue’. The noun section distinguishes 11 senses that all have
definitions illustrated by examples. An extract of the noun section’s wikicode is depicted in Figure 1.
As can be seen, some wiki conventions are recurrent (e.g. double-brackets mark hyperlinks) and are
easy to handle. Handling dynamic templates (marked by curly brackets) is more tricky. In definitions,
they mark notes related to particular domains, registers, usages, geographic areas, languages, etc. In
Figure 1, the pattern {{sport}} indicates that the second sense relates to the domain of sport ; the pattern
{{vieilli|fr}} in the following definition denotes a dated usage ; the pattern {{figuré|fr}} in the last
definition indicates a figurative one. We inventoried about 6,000 such templates and their aliases: for
example, 4 patterns (abbreviated or full form, with or without ligature) signal the domain of enology:
{{œnologie|fr}}, {{oenologie|fr}}, {{œnol|fr}} and {{oenol|fr}}. Unfortunately, the existence of
such patterns does not prevent a contributor to directly write domain name in the page: several versions
of “hardcoded domains” may be found, e.g. (oenologie) or (œnologie).

Inventorying all these variations enabled us: 1) to remove them from the definitions’ text and 2) to
mark them in a formal way. Thus, one can decide to remove or keep, on demand, entries that are marked
as rare or dated, build a sublexicon of a given domain, remove diatopic variations or investigate only
these forms (e.g. words that are used only in Quebec), etc.

The variations observed in the definitions also occur in phonemic transcriptions, inflectional features,
semantic relations, etc. We focus here only on the information used in sections 6 and 7: definitions
and morphological relations. However, we parsed Wiktionnaire’s full content and extracted all kind of
available information, handling the numerous variations that we observed to convert the online dictio-
nary into a structured resource, that we called GLAWI.3 It contains more than 1.4 million inflected forms
(about 190,000 lemmas) with their definitions, examples, lexicosemantic relations and translations, de-
rived terms and phonemic transcriptions. A shortened extract resulting from the conversion of the noun
section of course is depicted in Figure 2. As can be seen, GLAWI includes both XML structured data
and the initial corresponding wikicode. This version of the resource is intended to remain close to the
Wiktionnaire’s content, whereas other lexicons focused on a particular aspect will be released. Our aim
is to provide ready-to-use lexicons resulting from different post-processing of GLAWI. Post-processing

steps will consist in 1) selecting information relevant to a particular need (e.g. phonemic transcriptions,
semantic relations, etc.) and 2) detecting inconsistencies and correcting them. The initial GLAWI re-
source, containing all the initial information, will also be released so that anyone can apply additional
post-processings. GLAWI unburdens such users from the efforts of parsing the wikicode.

Articles from Wiktionnaire may contain morphologically derived terms. Figures 1 and 2 show that
course produces the derived verb courser and noun coursier ‘courier’. Such derivational relations are
collected from Wiktionnaire and included in GLAWI. We show below how we leverage this information,
in addition to GLAWI’s definitions, to acquire morphological and morphosemantic knowledge.

4 Acquisition of morphological relations from GLAWI morphological subsections

We first extracted from GLAWI the list of the lexeme headwords that have typographically simple writ-
ten forms (only letters) and that belong to the major POS: noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. This list
(GLAWI-HW) contains 152,567 entries: 79,961 nouns, 22,646 verbs, 47,181 adjective and 2,779 ad-
verbs). In what follows, we only consider these words.

Then we created a morphological lexicon extracted from the morphological subsections4 of GLAWI
(hereafter GMS). The lexicon consists of all pairs of words (w1, w2), where w1 and w2 belong to
GLAWI-HW and where w2 is listed in one of the morphological subsections of the article of w1 or
vice versa. GMS contains 97,058 pairs. The extraction of this lexicon from GLAWI was very simple, all
the variability in Wiktionnaire’s lexicographic descriptions being supported by our parser (see Section 3).

The remainder of the paper presents two methods for extending GMS. In a first experiment, we com-
plement this lexicon with new pairs acquired from GLAWI’s definitions. In a second one, we show how
some of GMS’s morphological pairs can be classified with respect to a given semantic class.

4The morphological subsections appear under 4 headings in Wiktionnaire: apparentés; apparentés étymologiques; com-
posés; dérivés.

5 Morphological definitions

Basically, a dictionary definition is a pair composed of a word and a gloss of its meaning. In the follow-
ing, we will use the terms definiendum for the defined word, definiens for the defining gloss and the
notation definiendum = definiens. The definition articulates a number of lexical semantic relations be-
tween the definiendum and some words of the definiens as in (1) where chair is a hyponym of furniture,
is the holonym of seat, legs, back and arm rests and is also the typical instrument of sit on. Some of the
relations are made explicit by lexical markers as used to or comprising.

(1) chairN = An item of furniture used to sit on or in comprising a seat, legs, back, and some-
times arm rests, for use by one person.

Martin (1983) uses these relations to characterize the definitions. In his typology, definitions as in (2)
are considered to be (morphological) derivational because the definiendum is defined with respect to
a morphologically related word. In these definitions, the lexical semantic relation only involves two
words that are morphologically related. Being members of the same derivational family, the orthographic
representations of these words show some degree of similarity that can help us identify the morphological
definitions. In (2) for example, the written forms nitrificateur ‘nitrifying’ and nitrification ‘nitrification’
share a 10 letters prefix and only differ by 3 letters. This strong similarity is a reliable indicator of their
morphologically relatedness (Hathout, 2011b). Building on this observation, a definition is likely to be
morphological if its definiens contains a word which is orthographically similar to the definiendum.

(2) nitrificateurA = Qui produit, qui favorise la nitrification.
‘nitrifying’ ‘that produces, that favors nitrification’

We used Proxinette, a measure of morphological similarity defined in (Hathout, 2008), to identify the
morphological definitions. Proxinette is designed to reduce the search space for derivational analogies.
The reduction is obtained by bringing closer the words that belong to the same derivational families and
series, since it is precisely within these paradigms that an entry is likely to form analogies (Hathout,
2011a). Proxinette describes the lexemes by all the n-grams of characters that appear in their inflected
forms in order to catch the inflectional stem allomorphy because it tends to also show up in derivation
(Bonami et al., 2009). The n-grams have an additional tag that indicates if they occur at the beginning,
at the end or in the middle of the word. This information is described by adding a # at the beginning
and end of the written forms. For example, in Figure 4, localisation ‘localization’, localiser ‘localize;
locate’ and focalisation ‘focalization’ share the ions# ending because it occurs in their inflected forms
localisations (plural), localisions (1st person plural, indicative, imperfect) and focalisations (plural). n-
grams of size 1 and 2 are ignored because they occur in too many words and are not discriminant enough.
Proxinette builds a bipartite graph with the words of the lexicon on one side and the features (n-grams)
that characterize them on the other. Each word is linked to all its features and each feature is connected
to the words that own it (see Figure 4). The graph is weighted so that the sum of weights of the outgoing
edges of each node is equal to 1. Morphological similarity is estimated by simulating the spreading of
an activation. For a given entry, an activation is initiated at the node that represents it. This activation is
then propagated towards the features of the entry. In a second step, the activations in the feature nodes
are propagated towards the words that possess them. The words which obtain the highest activations are
the most similar to the entry. The edge weights and the way the graph is traversed brings closer the words
that share the largest number of common features and the most specific ones (i.e. the less frequent).

Figure 5: The most similar words to the noun localisation. Words in boldface belong to the derivational
family of localisation. Words in light type belong to its derivational series.

We applied Proxinette to GLAWI-HW and calculated for each of them a neighborhood consisting of
the 100 most similar words. Figure 5 shows an excerpt of the neighborhood of the noun localisation.
The occurrence of the verb localiser in this list enables us to identify the morphological definition (3).

(3) localisationN = Action de localiser, de se localiser.
‘localization’ ‘the act of localizing, of locating’

The two experiments we conducted use the same data, namely the morphological definitions of GLAWI.
These definitions are selected as follows:

1. We extracted all GLAWI definition glosses (definientia) with their entries and POS (definienda).

2. We syntactically parsed the definientia with the Talismane dependency parser (Urieli, 2013). Figure
6 presents the dependencies syntactic trees for the definientia in (4).

3. We tagged as morphological all definitions where, in the parsed definiens, at least one lemma
(henceforth referred to as morphosemantic head) occurs in the definiendum neighborhood. For
example, in (4), both definitions are tagged as morphological because arrêter occurs in the neigh-
borhood of arrêt, and découronner and couronne occur in that of découronnement.

(4) a. arrêtN = Action de la main pour arrêter le cheval.
‘stop’ ‘action of the hand to stop the horse’

b. découronnementN = L’action de découronner, d’enlever la couronne.
‘uncrowning’ ‘the act of uncrowning, of removing the crown’

Morphosemantic heads may be the derivational base of the definiendum like découronner, a more distant
ancestor like couronne or a “sibling” like in (2) where nitrification is a derivative of the definiendum base
nitrifier ‘nitrify’.

6 Acquisition of morphological relations from GLAWI morphological definitions

We extracted from GLAWI’s morphological definitions the pairs of words (w1, w2) where w1 is the
definiendum and w2 the definiens morphosemantic heads (or one of its morphosemantic head if it has
many). After symmetrization, we obtained a lexicon (hereafter GMD) of 107,628 pairs. 32,256 of them
belongs to GMS. A manual check of the 75,372 remaining pairs would enable its addition to GMS.

GMD additional pairs have been evaluated by three judges in two steps. The judges were instructed to
set aside the orthographic variants as desperado N / despérado N. We first randomly selected 100 pairs
and had them checked by three judges in order to estimate the inter-annotator agreement. The average
F-measure of the agreement is 0.97 ; Fleiss’s kappa is 0.65. The judges then checked 100 randomly
selected pairs each. 9 out of the 300 pairs were variants and 19 errors were found in the 291 remaining
ones which results in an overall accuracy of 93.5%. This method would lead to an increase of GMS by
more than 70,000 pairs.

The general quality of these acquired pairs can be significantly increased by formal analogy filter-
ing. The idea is to use analogy as a proxy to find pairs of words that are in the same morphological
relation. GMS pairs being provided by Wiktionary contributors, we consider them as correct and use
them as analogical patterns to filter out the pairs acquired from the morphological definitions. By formal
analogy, we mean an analogy between the orthographic representations. For instance, the GMD pair cit-
rique A:citron N form an analogy with électrique A:électron N. The latter being correct, we can assume
that the former is correct too.

(5) a. citrique A : citron N = électrique A : électron N

b. fragmentation N : défragmenter V = concentration N : déconcentrer V

Analogies between strings are called formal analogies (Lepage, 2003; Stroppa and Yvon, 2005). One
way to check a formal analogy is to find a decomposition (or factorization) of the four strings such that
the differences between the first two are identical to the ones between the second two. In the analogy
in (5a), the ending ique is replaced by on and the POS A by N in both pairs. We applied analogical
filtering to GMS and GMD pairs. 86,228 pairs in GMD form at least one analogy with a pair in GMS;
53,972 of them do not occur in GMS. 300 of these pairs have been checked by three judges. They only
found 3 variants and one error. The obtained accuracy is therefore over 99% (see Table 1).5

GMS 97,058 – – –
GMD 107,628 95.4% 86,228 99.8%

Table 1: Summary of the quantitative results

GMD morphological relations will not be included into GLAWI. GMS and GMD are made available
as separate resources on the GLAWI web page.

7 Semantic typing of the morphological definitions

The next experiment aims to demonstrate that morphological definitions could easily and quite accurately
be typed semantically. We focus on a particular semantic type, namely definitions of process nominals
such as (6) because they can be evaluated with respect to the Verbaction database (Hathout and Tanguy,
2002). Deverbal nominals have been extensively studied in linguistics (Pustejovsky, 1995) and used
in a number of tools for various tasks. One of their distinctive feature is that they almost have the
same meaning as their base verb. For instance, in (7) the noun and verb phrases are paraphrases of one
another. Verbaction contains 9,393 verb-noun pairs where the noun is morphologically related to the
verb and can be used to express the act denoted by the verb (e.g. verrouiller:verrouillage).6 It has been

5Unfortunately, these results could not have been compared with those of Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) because
their system makes use of a number of lexical and semantic resources that are not available for French. However, a comparison
with Baroni et al. (2002) is underway although their method is corpus-based (and not MRD-based).

used in syntactic dependency parsing by Bourigault (2007), in the construction of the French TimeBank
by Bittar et al. (2011), in question answering systems by Bernhard et al. (2011), etc.

(6) verrouillageN = Action de verrouiller.
‘locking’ ‘the act of locking.’

(7) nous vérouillons la porte rapidement ‘we quickly lock the gate’
le verrouillage de la porte est rapide ‘gate locking is quick’

In our experiment, we used the linear SVM classifier liblinear of Fan et al. (2008) to assign a semantic
type to the definitions that have a nominal definiendum and where the morphosemantic head of the
definiens is a verb as in (4) or (6). Verbaction was used to select a corpus of 1,198 of such definitions.
Three judges annotated them. 608 definientia were tagged as processive and 590 ones as non processive.
We then divided the corpus into a test set made up of 100 processive and 100 non processive definitions
and a training set consisting of the remaining definientia.

The classifier is trained to recognize that the definientia in (4) express the same semantic relation
between the morphosemantic head of the definiens and the definiendum. We use the method proposed
by (Hathout, 2008) to capture this semantic similarity. Definientia are described by a large number
of redundant features based on lemmata, POSs and syntactic dependencies. The features are n-grams
calculated from Talismane parses (see figure 6). They are defined as follows:

1. We first collect all the paths that go from one word in the definiens to the syntactic root (e.g. [arrêter,
pour, action] is a path that starts at arrêter in (4a)).

2. We extract all the n-grams of consecutive nodes in these paths.

3. Each n-gram yields 3 features: the sequence of the node’s lemmata, the sequence of the nodes POS,
and the sequence of syntactic dependency relations.

We obtained an accuracy of 97% for the semantic typing of the 200 definientia of the test set. The
most immediate application of the classifier is the enrichment of Verbaction. Running the classifier on
all the definitions with a nominal definiendum and a verbal morphosemantic head will provide us with
new couples that could be added to the database. The classifier could also help us type process nouns
that are not morphologically derived such as audition ‘hearing’ which is defined with respect to the verb
entendre ‘hear’. Similar typing could be performed for other semantic types such as agent nouns (in -eur
or -ant), change of state verbs (in -iser or -ifier) or adjectives expressing possibility (in -able), etc. The
experiment also shows that morphological definitions are well suited for semantic analysis because they
express regular semantic relationship between pairs of words that are distinguished by their orthographic
similarity.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented GLAWI, an XML machine-readable dictionary created from Wiktion-
naire, the French edition of the Wiktionary project. We then showed that GLAWI was well suited for
conducting computational morphology experiments. GLAWI contains morphological subsections which
provide a significant number of valid and varied morphological relations. In addition, morphological re-
lations can also be acquired from GLAWI morphological definitions. We presented a method to identify
these definitions and the words in relation with a fairly good accuracy. We then used formal analogy to
filter out almost all the erroneous pairs acquired from morphological definitions. In a second experiment,
we demonstrate how to assign the morphological definitions to semantic types with a high accuracy.

This work opens several research avenues leading to a formal representation of the different form
and meaning relations that underlie derivational morphology. The next move will be to organize the
morphological relations into a graph similar to Démonette (Hathout and Namer, 2014) and identify the
paradigms which structure them. We also plan to apply the semantic classification to other semantic
types which could ultimately enable us to explore the intricate interplay between form and meaning.
