Abstract
The aim of this paper is to categorize and present the existence of resources for English-
to-Urdu machine translation (MT) and to establish an empirical baseline for this task.
By doing so, we hope to set up a common ground for MT research with Urdu to allow
for a congruent progress in this field. We build baseline phrase-based MT (PBMT) and
hierarchical MT systems and report the results on 3 official independent test sets. On all
test sets, hierarchial MT significantly outperformed PBMT. The highest single-reference
BLEU score is achieved by the hierarchical system and reaches 21.58% but this figure
depends on the randomly selected test set. Our manual evaluation of 175 sentences
suggests that in 45% of sentences, the hierarchical MT is ranked better than the PBMT
output compared to 21% of sentences where PBMT wins, the rest being equal.

1 Introduction
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has always been a challenging task for language pairs with
significant word ordering differences and rich inflectional morphology. The language pair such
as English and Urdu, despite of descending from the same family of Indo-European languages,
differs heavily in syntactic strucure and morphological characteristics. English is relatively
fixed word order language and follows subject-verb-object (SVO) structure whereas Urdu uses
restricted free word order language and most commonly follows the SOV pattern. Urdu word
order is restricted for only few parts of speeches such as adjectives always precede nouns and
postpositions follow nouns. Unlike English, Urdu is a pro-drop language. The morphology of
Urdu is similar to other Indo-European languages, e.g. by having inflectional morphological
system.

To the best of our knowledge, the research on English-to-Urdu machine translation has been
very much fragmented, preventing the authors to build upon the works of others. Our underlying
motivation for this paper is to establish a common ground and provide a concise summary of
available data resources and set up reproducible baseline results of several available test sets.
With this basis, future Urdu MT research should be able to stepwise improve the state of the
art, in contrast with the scattered experiments done so far (Khan et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2013;
Ali and Malik, 2010).

In Section 2, the experimental setup and data processing tools are described. Existing corpora
are introduced in Section 3, automatic results are reported in Section 4 and manual evaluation
is discussed in Section 5.

2 Experimental Setup
This section briefly introduces the selection of SMT models that are used to build the baseline
English-Urdu SMT system and also explains the processing of parallel data before passing it to
the MT system.

2.1 Two Models of SMT
The state-of-the-art MT toolkit Moses1 (Koehn et al., 2007), offers two mainstream models of
SMT: phrase-based (PBMT) and syntax-based (SBMT) that includes the hierarchical model.

The PBMT model operates only on mapping of source phrases (short sequences of words) to
target phrases. For dealing with word order differences, two rather weak models are available:
lexicalized and distance-based. The lexicalized reordering models (Tillmann, 2004) are consid-
ered more advanced as they condition reordering on the actual phrases, whereas the latter model
makes the reordering cost (paid when picking source phrases out of sequence) dependent only
on the length of the jump. The distance-based model is suited well for local reordering but it is
fairly weak in capturing any long distance reorderings.

The syntax-based model (SBMT) builds upon Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG)
that synchronously generates source and target sentences. The grammar rules can either consist
of linguistically motivated non-terminals such as NP, VP etc. or the generic non-terminal “X”
in which case the model is called “hierarchical phrase-based” (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007). In
either case, the model is capable of capturing long-distance reordering much better than the
lexicalized reordering of PBMT.

2.2 Data Processing and MT Training
For the training of our en-ur translation systems, the standard training pipeline of Moses is used
along with the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) alignment toolkit and a 5-gram SRILM language
model (Stolcke, 2002). The source texts were processed using the Treex platform (Popel and
Žabokrtský, 2010)2, which included tokenization and lemmatization.

The target side of the corpus is tokenized using a simple tokenization script3 by Dan Zeman and
it is lemmatized using the Urdu Shallow Parser4 developed by Language Technologies Research
Center of IIIT Hyderabad.

The alignments are learnt from the lemmatized version of the corpus. In all other cases,
word forms (i.e. no morphological decomposition) in their true case (i.e. names capitalized but
sentence starts lowercased) are used. The lexicalized reordering model uses the feature set called
“msd-bidirectional-fe”.

3 Dataset
Parallel and monolingual data resources are very scarce for low-resource language pairs such as
English-Urdu. This section highlights the existing parallel and monolingual data resources that
can be utilized for training SMT models. The number of official test sets are also exhibited.

3.1 Parallel Corpus
Our parallel corpus consists of around 79K sentences collected from five different sources. The
collection comes from several domains such as News, Religion, Technology, Language and Culture
etc. 95% of the data is used for training, whereas the rest is evenly split into dev and test sets.

• Emille: EMILLE (Enabling Minority Language Engineering) (Baker et al., 2002) is a col-
lection of monolingual (written and spoken), parallel and annotated corpora of fourteen
South Asian languages which is distributed by the European Language Resources Associa-
tion (ELRA). The Urdu-English part are documents produced by the British Departments
of Health, Social Services, Education and Skills, and Transport, Local Government and the
Regions of British government translated into Urdu.
In this work, the manually sentence aligned version of English-Urdu Emille corpus Jawaid
and Zeman (2011) is used.

• IPC: The Indic Parallel Corpus (Post et al., 2012)5 is a collection of Wikipedia documents
of six Indian sub-continent languages translated into English through crowdsourcing in the
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform.
The English-Urdu part generally contains four (in some cases three) English translations
for each Urdu sentence. In a separate MTurk task, the Turkers voted which of the English
translations is the best one. The official training, dev and devtest sets is first merged and
afterwards the voting list is used to retrieve only the winning English sentence ignoring
sentences with no votes altogether. The official testset is left unaltered to report our final
results on this data.

• Quran: The publicly available parallel English and Urdu translation of Quranic data6 is
used, which is collected by Jawaid and Zeman (2011) in their work. The data consists of
6K aligned parallel sentences.

• Penn Treebank: Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is an annotated corpus of around
4.5 million words originating from Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Brown corpus, Switchboard
and ATIS. The entire treebank in English is released by the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC). A subset of the WSJ section whose Urdu translations are provided by Center for
Language Engineering (CLE)7 is used. Out of 2,499 WSJ stories in the Treebank, only 317
are available in Urdu.

• Afrl: Afrl, the largest of the parallel resources we were able to get, is not publicly available.
The corpus originally consists of 87K sentences coming from mix of several domains mainly
news articles. The sentence alignments are manually checked of almost two thirds of the
corpus, around 4K misaligned and 30K duplicate sentences are discarded.

The statistics shown in Table 1 are reported after removing duplicated sentences from each
source. Almost all parallel corpora contained at least tens or hundreds of duplicate sentences.
Afrl on the other hand contained larger chunks of Emille and also smaller subset of Penn Tree-
bank. Around 3K sentences from Afrl that were seen in Emille are discarded but the Penn
Treebank subset of Afrl is left intact because it provides different Urdu translations.

Each parallel corpus is randomly split into train, dev and test sets according to its relative
size.

of domains such as News, Religion, Blogs, Literature, Science, Education etc. Only plain text
monolingual data is used to build our language model.

3.3 Official Testsets
In addition to the testset that is created from the parallel corpora resources, results are reported
on three official testsets.

NIST 2008 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation9 has distributed test data from
2 domains: Newswire and Web. The Web data is collected from user forums, discussion groups
and blogs, whereas Newswire data is a mix of newswire stories and data from web. The test data
contain 4 English translations for each Urdu sentence, the first English translation is picked in
all cases. Because the majority of test sets are created in order to faciliatate Urdu-to-English
MT, most of them contain multiple English references against each Urdu source.

Another testset is released with the IPC. Only those sentences are used whose ids are present
in the voting list. The domain of the IPC test set is discussed in Section 3.1.

CLE10 has published small test set from News domain specifically for MT evaluation. The
test data contains 3 Urdu references against each source. All reference translations are used for
the evaluation.

Table 2 shows the number of sentences in each test set that are used for the final evaluation.
We also report the coverage of each test set (calculated on vocabulary size) i.e. how many source
words in a test set were seen in the training data. The notions used in Table 2 to introduce
coverage are explained in Section 4.

4 Results
The BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) has been used to evaluate the performance of the
systems. Models are trained on two different datasets: all parallel corpora (referred as “ALL”)
and parallel data excluding Afrl corpus (referred as “Except-Afrl”). The latter model is trained
due to the fact that Afrl corpus is publicly not available. The community working on English-
Urdu machine translation can thus have one common baseline that could be used to evaluate
their improved systems in the future. Including Afrl allows us to see the gains in performance
thanks to the additional data.

Table 3 shows the baseline results of phrase-based and hierarchical systems when trained on
both datasets. The results are reported on two test sets: the test set of 2,000 sentences (called
Large in Table 3) as shown in Table 1 and its subset of 728 sentences which excludes 1,272 test
sentences from Afrl (called Small in Table 3).

PBMT performs better when integrated with lexicalized reordering model but Hierarchical
MT outperforms both PBMT setups on both smaller and larger test sets. The absolute BLEU
scores drop by up to 6 points when Afrl is removed from the training data, however they return
back to ∼20 when Afrl is also removed from the test set. This highlights the importance of data
overall and the match in domain in particular, as supported by the differences in vocabulary
coverage (see the column “Coverage” in Table 3).

Table 4 shows the results of the best performing setups (i.e. phrase-based with lexicalized
reordering model and hierarchical model) trained on both training datasets and evaluated on the

official test sets. The BLEU score for CLE test set is reported using all 3 reference translations
at once as well as the average of single-reference BLEUs, taking each reference translation
separately. IPC and NIST2008 results are evaluated on a single reference.

The hierarchical MT performs significantly better than the phrase-based MT on all test sets.
The lowest scores were achieved on the NIST2008 test set but it is difficult to pinpoint any
specific reason (other than some domain difference) because the coverage is comparable to other
test sets (see Table 2). Across all the test sets, Afrl corpus brings about 2 points BLEU absolute.

5 Manual Evaluation
To manually analyze the output of best performing models sample of 175 sentences is randomly
selected from the large test set translated using both PBMT with lexical reordering and hier-
archical models trained on “ALL” data sets. QuickJudge11 is used to rank the outputs. The
annotator is shown the source, reference and output from both machine translation systems, the
identity of the MT systems is not known. There are four permitted outcomes of the ranking:
both systems marked as equally good; both systems are equally bad or the output of one of the
systems is better than the other one. Here is the summary of annotation by a single annotator:

• Out of 175 sentences, 41 sentences received equally bad translations from both systems.

• 17 items are marked as equally good.

• In 79 cases, the hierarchical MT is ranked better than the phrase-based MT.

• In the remaining 38 cases, the phrase-based MT is ranked better than the hierarchical MT.

The results from the manual ranking show that the hierarchical systems wins twice more often
than PBMT. The two systems tie in about one third of input sentences, of which about 70 %
are cases where the translations are bad.

6 Conclusion
In this work, a collection of sizeable English-Urdu corpora is summarized for statistical machine
translation. These resources are used to build baseline phrase-based and hierarchical MT systems
for translation into Urdu and the results are reported on 3 independent official test sets. This

can hopefully serve as a baseline for a wider community of researchers. The output of both
translation models is manually analyzed and it confirms that the hierarchical model is preferred
over phrase-based MT for English-to-Urdu translation.
