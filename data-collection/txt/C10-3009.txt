Abstract

This demonstration presents a high-
performance syntactic and semantic de-
pendency parser. The system consists of a
pipeline of modules that carry out the to-
kenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech
tagging, dependency parsing, and seman-
tic role labeling of a sentence. The sys-
tem’s two main components draw on im-
proved versions of a state-of-the-art de-
pendency parser (Bohnet, 2009) and se-
mantic role labeler (Björkelund et al.,
2009) developed independently by the au-
thors.

The system takes a sentence as input and
produces a syntactic and semantic anno-
tation using the CoNLL 2009 format. The
processing time needed for a sentence typ-
ically ranges from 10 to 1000 millisec-
onds. The predicate–argument structures
in the final output are visualized in the
form of segments, which are more intu-
itive for a user.

1 Motivation and Overview

Semantic analyzers consist of processing
pipelines to tokenize, lemmatize, tag, and parse
sentences, where all the steps are crucial to their
overall performance. In practice, however, while
code of dependency parsers and semantic role
labelers is available, few systems can be run as
standalone applications and even fewer with a
processing time per sentence that would allow a

user interaction, i.e. a system response ranging
from 100 to 1000 milliseconds.

This demonstration is a practical semantic
parser that takes an English sentence as input
and produces syntactic and semantic dependency
graphs using the CoNLL 2009 format. It builds
on lemmatization and POS tagging preprocessing
steps, as well as on two systems, one dealing with
syntax and the other with semantic dependencies
that reported respectively state-of-the-art results
in the CoNLL 2009 shared task (Bohnet, 2009;
Björkelund et al., 2009). The complete system ar-
chitecture is shown in Fig. 1.

The dependency parser is based on Carreras’s
algorithm (Carreras, 2007) and second order span-
ning trees. The parser is trained with the margin
infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA) (McDonald et
al., 2005) and combined with a hash kernel (Shi et
al., 2009). In combination with the system’s lem-
matizer and POS tagger, this parser achieves an
average labeled attachment score (LAS) of 89.88
when trained and tested on the English corpus
of the CoNLL 2009 shared task (Surdeanu et al.,
2008).

The semantic role labeler (SRL) consists of a
pipeline of independent, local classifiers that iden-
tify the predicates, their senses, the arguments of
the predicates, and the argument labels. The SRL
module achieves an average labeled semantic F1
of 80.90 when trained and tested on the English
corpus of CoNLL 2009 and combined with the
system’s preprocessing steps and parser.

Figure 3 shows the system output. It visual-
izes the end results as a list of predicates and their
respective arguments in the form of colored seg-
ments. It also details the analysis as tabulated
data using the CoNLL 2009 format (Surdeanu et
al., 2008; Hajič et al., 2009), where the columns
contain for each word, its form, lemma, POS tag,
syntactic head, grammatical function, whether it
is a predicate, and, if yes, the predicate sense.
Then, columns are appended vertically to the table
to identify the arguments of each predicate (one
column per predicate). Figure 3 shows that the
sentence contains two predicates, call.03 and de-
gree.01 and the two last columns of the table show
their respective arguments. Clicking on a predi-
cate in the first column shows the description of
its arguments in the PropBank or NomBank dic-
tionaries. For call.03, this will open a new win-
dow that will show that Arg0 is the demander,
Arg1, the thing being demanded, and Arg2, the
demandee.

3 Preprocessing Steps

The preprocessing steps consist of the tokeniza-
tion, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging
of the input sentence. We use first OpenNLP1

to tokenize the sentence. Then, the lemmatizer
identifies the lemmas for each token and the tag-
ger assigns the part-of-speech tags. The lemma-
tizer and the tagger use a rich feature set that
was optimized for all languages of the CoNLL
2009 shared task (Hajič et al., 2009). Our lemma-
tizer uses the shortest edit script (SES) between
the lemmas and the forms and we select a script
within an SES list using a MIRA classifier (Chru-

pala, 2006). The English lemmatizer has an ac-
curacy of 99.46. This is 0.27 percentage point
lower than the predicted lemmas of the English
corpus in CoNLL 2009, which had an accuracy
of 99.73. The German lemmatizer has an accu-
racy of 98.28. The accuracy of the predicted lem-
mas in the German corpus was 68.48. The value
is different because some closed-class words are
annotated differently (Burchardt et al., 2006). We
also employed MIRA to train the POS classifiers.
Compared to the predicted POS tags in the shared
task, we could increase the accuracy by 0.15 from
97.48 to 97.63 for English and by 1.55 from 95.68
to 97.23 for German.

4 Dependency Parsing

The dependency parser of this demonstration is
a further development of Carreras (2007) and Jo-
hansson and Nugues (2008). We adapted it to ac-
count for the multilingual corpus of the CoNLL
2009 shared task – seven languages – and to im-
prove the speed of the computationally expensive
higher order decoder (Bohnet, 2009). The parser

reached the best accuracies in CoNLL 2009 for
English and German, and was ranked second in
average over all the languages in the task.

The parser in this demonstration is an enhance-
ment of the CoNLL 2009 version with a hash
kernel, a parallel parsing algorithm, and a paral-
lel feature extraction to improve the accuracy and
parsing speed. The hash kernel enables the parser
to reach a higher accuracy. The introduction of
this kernel entails a modification of MIRA, which
is simple to carry out: We replaced the feature-
index mapping that mapped the features to indices
of the weight vector by a random function. Usu-
ally, the feature-index mapping in a support vector
machine has two tasks: It maps the features to an
index in the weight vector and filters out the fea-
tures not collected in the first step. The parser is
about 12 times faster than a baseline parser with-
out hash kernel and without parallel algorithms.
The parsing time is about 0.077 seconds per sen-
tence in average for the English test set.

5 Semantic Role Labeling Pipeline

The pipeline of classifiers used in the seman-
tic role labeling consists of four steps: predi-
cate identification, predicate disambiguation, ar-
gument identification, and argument classifica-
tion, see Fig. 1. In each step, we used different
classifiers for the nouns and the verbs. We build
all the classifiers using the L2-regularized linear
logistic regression from the LIBLINEAR package
(Fan et al., 2008). To speed up processing, we dis-
abled the reranker used in the CoNLL 2009 sys-
tem (Björkelund et al., 2009).

Predicate Identification is carried out using a
binary classifier that determines whether a
noun or verb is a predicate or not.

Predicate Disambiguation is carried out for all
the predicates that had multiple senses in the
training corpus. We trained one classifier per
lemma. For lemmas that could be both a verb
or a noun (e.g. plan), we trained one classi-
fier per part of speech. We considered lem-

35



mas with a unique observed sense as unam-
biguous.

Argument Identification and Classification.
Similarly to the two previous steps, a binary
classifier first identifies the arguments and
then a multiclass classifier assigns them a
label. In both steps, we used separate models
for the nouns and the verbs.

Features. For the predicate identification, we
used the features suggested by Johansson and
Nugues (2008). For the other modules of
the pipeline, we used the features outlined
in Björkelund et al. (2009). The feature sets
were originally selected using a greedy for-
ward procedure. We first built a set of sin-
gle features and, to improve the separability
of our linear classifiers, we paired features to
build bigrams.

6 Results and Discussion

The demonstration system implements a complete
semantic analysis pipeline for English, where we
combined two top-ranked systems for syntactic
and semantic dependency parsing of the CoNLL
2009 shared task. We trained the classifiers on the
same data sets and we obtained a final semantic
F1 score of 80.90 for the full system. This score
is lower than the best scores reported in CoNLL
2009. It is not comparable, however, as the pred-
icates had then been manually marked up. Our
system includes a predicate identification stage
to carry out a fully automatic analysis. This ex-
plains a part of the performance drop. To pro-
vide comparable figures, we replaced the predi-
cate identification classifier with an oracle read-
ing the gold standard. We reached then a score
of 85.58. To reach a higher speed and provide
an instantaneous response to the user (less than
1 sec.), we also removed the global reranker from
the pipeline which accounts for an additional loss
of about 1.2 percentage point. This would put the
upper-bound semantic F1 value to about 86.80,
which would match the CoNLL 2009 top figures.
