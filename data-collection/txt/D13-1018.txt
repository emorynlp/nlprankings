Abstract

In this paper we present a minimally-
supervised approach to the multi-domain ac-
quisition of wide-coverage glossaries. We start
from a small number of hypernymy rela-
tion seeds and bootstrap glossaries from the
Web for dozens of domains using Probabilis-
tic Topic Models. Our experiments show that
we are able to extract high-precision glos-
saries comprising thousands of terms and def-
initions.

1 Introduction

Dictionaries, thesauri and glossaries are useful
sources of information for students, scholars and ev-
eryday readers, who use them to look up words of
which they either do not know, or have forgotten,
the meaning. With the advent of the Web an increas-
ing number of dictionaries and technical glossaries
has been made available online, thereby speeding
up the definition search process. However, finding
definitions is not always immediate, especially if the
target term pertains to a specialized domain. Indeed,
not even well-known services such as Google Define
are able to provide definitions for scientific or tech-
nical terms such as taxonomy learning or distant su-
pervision in AI or figure-four leglock and suspended
surfboard in wrestling.

Domain-specific knowledge of a definitional na-
ture is not only useful for humans, it is also use-
ful for machines (Hovy et al., 2013). Examples
include Natural Language Processing tasks such as
Question Answering (Cui et al., 2007), Word Sense
Disambiguation (Duan and Yates, 2010; Faralli and

Navigli, 2012) and ontology learning (Velardi et al.,
2013). Unfortunately, most of the Web dictionar-
ies and glossaries available online comprise just a
few hundred definitions, and they therefore provide
only a partial view of a domain. This is also the
case with manually compiled glossaries created by
means of collaborative efforts, such as Wikipedia.1

The coverage issue is addressed by online aggrega-
tion services such as Google Define, which bring to-
gether definitions from several online dictionaries.
However, these services do not classify textual def-
initions by domain: they just present the collected
definitions for all the possible meanings of a given
term.

In order to automatically obtain large domain
glossaries, in recent years computational approaches
have been developed which extract textual defi-
nitions from corpora (Navigli and Velardi, 2010;
Reiplinger et al., 2012) or the Web (Velardi et al.,
2008; Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000). The methods in-
volving corpora start from a given set of terms (pos-
sibly automatically extracted from a domain cor-
pus) and then harvest textual definitions for these
terms from the input corpus using a supervised sys-
tem. Web-based methods, instead, extract text snip-
pets from Web pages which match pre-defined lex-
ical patterns, such as “X is a Y”, along the lines
of Hearst (1992). These approaches typically per-
form with high precision and low recall, because
they fall short of detecting the high variability of the
syntactic structure of textual definitions. To address
the low-recall issue, recurring cue terms occurring

within dictionary and encyclopedic resources can be
automatically extracted and incorporated into lexical
patterns (Saggion, 2004). However, this approach is
term-specific and does not scale to arbitrary termi-
nologies and domains.

The goal of the new approach outlined in this pa-
per is to enable the automatic harvesting of large-
scale, full-fledged domain glossaries for dozens of
domains, an outcome which should be very use-
ful for both human activities and automatic tasks.
We present ProToDoG (Probabilistic Topics for
multi-Domain Glossaries), a framework for growing
multi-domain glossaries which has three main nov-
elties:

i) minimal human supervision: a small set of
hypernymy relation seeds for each domain is
used to bootstrap the multi-domain acquisition
process;

ii) jointness: our approach harvests terms and
glosses at the same time;

iii) probabilistic topic models are leveraged for
a simultaneous, high-precision multi-domain
classification of the extracted definitions, with
substantial performance improvements over
our previous work on glossary bootstrapping,
i.e., GlossBoot (De Benedictis et al., 2013).

ProToDog is able to harvest definitions from the
Web and thus drop the requirement of large corpora
for each domain. Moreover, apart from the need to
select a few seeds, it avoids the use of training data
or manually defined sets of lexical patterns. It is thus
applicable to virtually any language of interest.

2 ProToDoG

Given a set of domains D = {d1, ..., dn}, for each
domain d ∈ D ProToDoG harvests a domain glos-
sary Gd containing pairs of the kind (t, g) where t
is a domain term and g is its textual definition, i.e.,
gloss. We show the pseudocode of ProToDoG in Al-
gorithm 1.

Step 1. Initial seed selection: Algorithm 1 takes
as input a set of domains D and, for each domain
d ∈ D, a small set of hypernymy relation seeds
Sd = {(t1, h1), . . . , (t|Sd|, h|Sd|)}, where the seed

pair (tj , hj) contains a term tj and its generalization
hj (e.g., (linux, operating system)). This is the only
human input to the entire glossary acquisition pro-
cess. The selection of the input seeds plays a key
role in the bootstrapping process, in that the pattern
and gloss extraction process will be driven by them.
The chosen hypernymy relations thus have to be as
topical and representative as possible for the domain
of interest (e.g., (compiler, computer program) is an
appropriate pair for computer science, while (byte,
unit of measurement) is not, as it might cause the
extraction of out-of-domain glossaries of units and
measures).

The algorithm first sets the iteration counter k to
1 (line 1) and starts the first iteration of the glos-
sary bootstrapping process (lines 2-17), each involv-
ing steps 2-4, described below. After each iteration
k, for each domain d we keep track of the set of
glosses Gkd acquired during that iteration. After the
last iteration, we perform step (5) of gloss recovery
(lines 18-21).

171



Step 2. Web search and glossary extraction (lines
3-9): For each domain d, we first initialize the do-
main glossary for iteration k: Gkd := ∅ (line 4).
Then, for each seed pair (tj , hj) ∈ Sd, we submit
the following query to a Web search engine: “tj”
“hj” glossary and collect the top-ranking results
for each query (line 6).2 Each resulting page is a
candidate glossary for the domain d.

We then call the extractGlossary function (line
7) which extracts terms and glosses from the re-
trieved pages as follows. From each candidate page,
we harvest all the text snippets s starting with tj and
ending with hj (e.g., “linux</b> – an<i>operating
system”), i.e., s = tj . . . hj . For each such text snip-
pet s, we extract the following pattern instance:

pL tj pM glosss(tj) pR,

where:

• pM is the longest sequence of HTML tags and
non-alphanumeric characters between tj and
the glossary definition (e.g., “</b> –” between
“linux” and “an” in the above example);

• glosss(tj) is the gloss of tj obtained by mov-
ing to the right of pM until we reach a non-
formatting tag element (e.g., <span>, <p>,
<div>), while ignoring formatting elements
such as <b>, <i> and <a> which are typi-
cally included within a definition sentence;

• pL and pR are the longest sequences of HTML
tags on the left of tj and the right of glosss(tj),
respectively.

For instance, given the HTML snippet
“. . .<p><b>linux</b> – an <i>operating
system</i> developed by Linus Torvalds</p>. . . ”
we extract the following pattern instance: pL =
“<p><b>”, tj = “linux”, pM = “</b> –”,
glosss(tj) = “an <i>operating system</i>
developed by Linus Torvalds”, pR =“</p>”.

Then we generalize the above pattern instance by
replacing tj and glosss(tj) with *, obtaining:

pL ∗ pM ∗ pR,
For the above example, we obtain the following

pattern:
2We use the Google Ajax API, which returns the 64 top-

ranking search results.

<p><b> * </b> – * </p>.

We add the first sentence of the retrieved gloss
glosss(tj) to our glossary Gkd, i.e., G

k
d := G

k
d ∪

{(tj , first(glosss(tj)))}, where first(g) returns
the first sentence of gloss g. Finally, we look for ad-
ditional pairs of terms/glosses in the Web page con-
taining the snippet s by matching the page against
the generalized pattern pL ∗ pM ∗ pR, and adding
them to Gkd.

As a result of step (2), for each domain d ∈ D
we obtain a glossary Gkd for the terms discovered at
iteration k.

Step 3. Topic modeling and gloss filtering (lines
10-12): Unfortunately, not all (term, gloss) pairs
in a glossaryGkd will pertain to the domain d. For in-
stance, we might end up retrieving interdisciplinary
or even unrelated glossaries. In order to address this
fuzziness, we model domains with a Probabilistic
Topic Model (PTM) (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers and
Griffiths, 2007). PTMs model a given text document
as a mixture of topics. In our case topics are do-
mains and we, first, create a topic model from the
domain glossaries acquired before the current iter-
ation k, then, second, use the topic model to esti-
mate the domain assignment of each new pair (term,
gloss) in our glossaries Gkd, i.e., obtained at iteration
k, third, filter out non-domain glosses.

Creating the topic model (line 10): For a given
iteration k and domain d, we first define the ter-
minology accumulated up until iteration k − 1 for
that domain as the set T 1,k−1d :=

⋃k−1
j=1 T

j
d , where

T jd is the set of terms acquired at iteration j, i.e.,
T jd := {t : ∃(t, g) ∈ G

j
d}.3 Then we define:

• W :=
⋃

d∈D T
1,k−1
d as the entire terminology

acquired up until iteration k−1 for all domains,
i.e., the full set of terms independently of their
domain;

• M :=
⋃

d∈D
⋃k−1

j=1 G
j
d as the multi-domain

glossary acquired up until iteration k − 1, i.e.,
the full set of pairs (term, gloss) independently
of their domain;4

3For the first iteration, i.e., when k = 1, we define T 1,0d :=
{t : ∃(t, g) ∈ G1d}, i.e., we use the terminology resulting from
step (2) of the first iteration.

4For k = 1, M :=
⋃

d∈D G

• Two count matrices, i.e., the word-domain ma-
trix CWD and the gloss-domain matrix CMD,
such that: CWDw,d counts the number of times
w ∈W is assigned to domain d ∈ D, i.e., it oc-
curs in the glosses of domain d; CMD(t,g),d counts
the number of words in g assigned to domain d.

At this point, as shown by Steyvers and Grif-
fiths (2007), we can estimate the probability φ(d)w for
word w, and the probability θ(t,g)d for a term/gloss
pair (t, g), of belonging to domain d:

φ(d)w =
CWDw,d + β∑|W |

θ
(t,g)
d =

CMD(t,g),d + α∑|D|

(2)

where α and β are smoothing factors.5 The two
above probabilities represent the core of our topic
model of the domain knowledge acquired up until
iteration k − 1.

Probabilistic modeling of iteration-k glosses (line
11): We now utilize the above topic model to es-
timate the probabilities in Formulas 1 and 2 for the
newly acquired glosses at iteration k. To this end we
define M ′ :=

⋃
d∈D G

k
d as the union of the (term,

gloss) pairs at iteration k and W ′ :=
⋃

d∈D T
k
d

⋂
W

as the union of terms acquired at iteration k, but also
occurring in W (i.e., the entire terminology up un-
til iteration k − 1). Then we apply Gibbs sampling
(Blei et al., 2003; Phan et al., 2008) to estimate the
probability of each pair (t, g) ∈ M ′ of pertaining to
a domain d by computing:

θ
′(t,g)
d =

RM
′D

(t,g),d + α∑|D|
d′=1R

M ′D
(t,g),d′ + |D|α

(3)

where the gloss-domain matrixRM
′D is initially de-

fined by counting random domain assignments for
each word w′ in the bag of words of each (term,
gloss) pair ∈ M ′. Next, the domain assignment
counts in RM

′D are iteratively updated using Gibbs
sampling.6

5As experienced by Steyvers and Griffiths (2007), the values
of α = 50/|D| and β = 0.01 work well with many different
text collections.

6For the PTM part of ProToDoG we used the JGibbLDA

Filtering out non-domain glosses (line 12): Now,
for each domain d ∈ D, for each pair (t, g) ∈ Gkd we
have a probability θ

′(t,g)
d of belonging to d. We mark

(t, g) as a non-domain item if θ
′(t,g)
d < δ, where δ is

a confidence threshold, or if θ
′(t,g)
d is not maximum

among all domains in D. Non-domain pairs are re-
moved from Gkd and stored into a set Ad for possible
recovery after the last iteration (see step (5)).

Step 4. Seed selection for next iteration (lines
13-15): For each domain d ∈ D, we now select
the new set of hypernymy relation seeds to be used
to start the next iteration. First, for each newly-
acquired term/gloss pair (t, g) ∈ Gkd, we automat-
ically extract a candidate hypernym h from the tex-
tual gloss g. To do this we use a simple heuristic
which just selects the first content term in the gloss.7

Then we sort all the glosses in Gkd by the number of
seed terms found in each gloss. In the case of ties
(i.e., glosses with the same number of seed terms),
we further sort the glosses by θ

′(t,g)
d . Finally we se-

lect the (term, hypernym) pairs corresponding to the
|Sd| top-ranking glosses as the new set of seeds for
the next iteration.

Next, we increment k (line 16 of Algorithm 1)
and if the maximum number of iterations is reached
we jump to step (5). Otherwise, we go back to step
(2) of our glossary bootstrapping algorithm with the
new set of seeds Sd.

Step 5. Gloss recovery (line 19): After all iter-
ations, the entire multi-domain terminology W (cf.
step (3)) may contain several new terms which were
not present when a given gloss g was filtered out.
So, thanks to the last-iteration topic model, the gloss
g might come back into play because its words are
now important cues for a domain. To reassess the
domain pertinence of (term, gloss) pairs in Ad for
each d, we just reapply the entire step (3) by setting
Gmax+1d := Ad for each d ∈ D. As a result, we

7While more complex strategies could be devised, e.g.,
lattice-based hypernym extraction (Navigli and Velardi, 2010),
we found that this heuristic works well because, even when it is
not a hypernym, the first term acts as a cue word for the defined
term.

obtain an updated glossary Gmax+1d which contains
all the recovered glosses.

Final output: For each domain d ∈ D the final
output of ProToDoG is a domain glossary Gd :=⋃

j=1,...,max+1G

d. Finally the algorithm aggregates

all glossaries Gd into a multi-domain glossary G
(line 22).

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Domains

For our experiments we selected 30 different do-
mains ranging from Arts to Warfare, mostly follow-
ing the domain classification of Wikipedia featured
articles (full list at http://lcl.uniroma1.
it/protodog). The set includes several techni-
cal domains, such as Chemistry, Geology, Meteorol-
ogy, Mathematics, some of which are highly inter-
disciplinary. For instance, the Environment domain
covers terms from fields such as Chemistry, Biology,
Law, Politics, etc.

3.2 Gold Standard

Since our evaluations required considerable human
effort, in what follows we calculated all perfor-
mances on a random set of 10 domains, shown in the
top row of Table 1. For each of these 10 domains we
selected well-reputed glossaries on the Web as gold
standards, including the Reuters glossary of finance,
the Utah computing glossary and many others (full
list at the above URL). We show the size of our 10
gold-standard datasets in Table 1.

3.3 Evaluation measures

We evaluated the quality of both terms and glosses,
as jointly extracted by ProToDoG.

3.3.1 Terms
For each domain we calculated coverage, extra-

coverage and precision of the acquired terms T .
Coverage is the ratio of extracted terms in T also
contained in the gold standard T̂ over the size of T̂ .
Extra-coverage is calculated as the ratio of the ad-
ditional extracted terms in T \ T̂ over the number of
gold standard terms T̂ . Finally, precision is the ra-
tio of extracted terms in T deemed to be within the

domain. To calculate precision we randomly sam-
pled 5% of the retrieved terms and asked two human
annotators to manually tag their domain pertinence
(with adjudication in case of disagreement; κ = .62,
indicating substantial agreement). Note that by ran-
domly sampling on the entire set T we calculate the
precision of both terms in T ∩ T̂ , i.e., in the gold
standard, and terms in T \ T̂ , i.e., not in the gold
standard, but which are not necessarily outside the
domain.

3.3.2 Glosses
We calculated the precision of the extracted

glosses as the ratio of glosses which were both well-
formed textual definitions and specific to the tar-
get domain. Precision was determined on a random
sample of 5% of the acquired glosses for each do-
main. The annotation was made by two annotators,
with κ = .675, indicating substantial agreement.
The annotators were provided with specific guide-
lines available on the ProToDoG Web site (see URL
above).

3.4 Comparison
We compared ProToDog against:

• BoW: a bag-of-words variant in which step
(3) is replaced by a simple bag-of-words scor-
ing approach which assigns a score to each
term/gloss pair (t, g) ∈ Gkd as follows:

score(g) =
|Bag(g) ∩ T 1,k−1d |
|Bag(g)|

. (4)

where Bag(g) contains all content words in
g. At iteration k, we filter out those glosses
whose score(g) < σ, where σ is a thresh-
old tuned in the same manner as δ (see Sec-
tion 3.5). This approach essentially implements
GlossBoot, our previous work on domain glos-
sary bootstrapping (De Benedictis et al., 2013).

• Wikipedia: since Wikipedia is the largest
collaborative resource, covering hundreds
of fields of knowledge, we devised a simple
heuristic for producing multi-domain glos-
saries from Wikipedia, so as to compare their
performance against our gold standards. For
each target domain we manually selected one

or more Wikipedia categories representing
the domain (for instance, Category:Arts
for Arts, Category:Business for Fi-
nance, etc.). Then, for each domain d,
we picked out all the Wikipedia pages
tagged either with the categories selected
for d or their direct subcategories (e.g.,
Category:Creative works) or sub-
subcategories (e.g., Category:Genres).
From each page we extracted a (page title,
gloss) pair, where the gloss was obtained by
extracting the first sentence of the Wikipedia
page, as done, e.g., in BabelNet (Navigli and
Ponzetto, 2012). Since subcategories might
have more parents and might thus belong to
multiple domains, we discarded pages assigned
to more than 2 domains.

3.5 Parameter tuning
In order to choose the optimal values of the parame-
ters of ProToDoG (number |Sd| of seeds per domain,
number max of iterations, and filtering threshold δ)
and BoW (σ threshold) we selected two extra do-
mains, i.e., Botany and Fashion, not used in our
tests, together with the corresponding gold standard
Web glossaries.

As regards the number of seeds, we defined an
initial pool of 10 seeds for each of the two tun-
ing domains and studied the average performance
of 5 random sets of x seeds (from the initial pool),
when x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. As regards the number of

iterations, we explored all values between 1 and
20. Finally, for the filtering thresholds δ and σ
for ProToDoG PTM and its BoW variant, we tried
values of δ ∈ {0, 0.03, 0.06, . . . , 0.6} and σ ∈
{0, 0.05, 0.1, . . . , 1.0}, respectively.

Given the high number of possible parameter
value configurations, we first explored the entire
search space automatically by calculating the cov-
erage of ProToDoG PTM (and BoW) with each con-
figuration against our tuning gold standards. Then
we identified as optimal candidates those “fron-
tier” configurations for which, when moving from
a lower-coverage configuration, coverage reached a
maximum. We then calculated the precision of each
optimal candidate configuration by manually vali-
dating a 3% random sample of the resulting glos-
saries for the two tuning domains. The optimal con-
figuration for ProToDoG was |Sd| = 5, max = 5,
δ = 0.03, while for BoW was σ = 0.1.

In Figure 1 we show the performance trend over
iterations for our two tuning domains when |Sd| = 5
and δ = 0.03. Performance is calculated as the
harmonic mean of precision and coverage of the ac-
quired glossary after each iteration, from 1 to 20. We
can see that after 5 iterations performance decreases
for Botany (a highly interdisciplinary domain) due
to lower precision, while it remains stable for Fash-
ion due to the lack of newly-acquired glosses.

3.6 Seed Selection

For each domain d we manually selected five seed
hypernymy relations as the seed sets Sd input to Al-
gorithm 1 (see Section 3.5). The seeds were selected
by the authors on the basis of just two conditions: i)
the seeds should cover different aspects of the do-
main and, indeed, should identify the domain im-
plicitly; ii) at least 10,000 results should be returned
by the search engine when querying it with the seeds
plus the glossary keyword (see line 6 of Algo-
rithm 1). The seed selection was not fine-tuned (i.e.,
it was not adjusted to improve performance), so it
might well be that better seeds would provide better
results (see (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010a)). However,
such a study is beyond the scope of this paper.

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 Terms

The size of the extracted terminologies for the 10 do-
mains after five iterations is reported in Table 1 (the
output for all 30 domains is available at the above
URL, cf. Section 3.1). ProToDoG PTM and its BoW
variant extract thousands of terms and glosses for
each domain, whereas the number of glosses ob-
tained from Wikipedia (cf. Section 3.4) varies de-
pending upon the domain, from thousands to hun-
dreds of thousands. Note that there is no overlap
between the glossaries extracted by ProToDoG and
the set of Wikipedia articles, since the latter are not
organized as glossaries.

In Table 2 we show the percentage results in
terms of precision (P), coverage (C), and extra-
coverage (X, see Section 3.3 for definitions) for
ProToDoG PTM and its BoW variant and for the
Wikipedia glossary. With the exception of the
Food domain, ProToDoG achieves the best pre-
cision. The Wikipedia glossary has fluctuating
precision values, ranging between 25% and 90%,
due to the heterogeneous nature of subcategories.
ProToDog achieves the best coverage of gold stan-
dard terms on 6 of the 10 domains, with the BoW
variant obtaining slightly higher coverage on 3 do-
mains and +10% on the Food domain. The cov-
erage of Wikipedia glossaries, instead, with the
sole exception of Sport, is much lower, despite the
use of (sub)subcategories (cf. Section 3.4). Both
ProToDoG PTM and BoW achieve very high extra-
coverage percentages, meaning that they are able to

go substantially beyond our domain gold standards,
but it is the Wikipedia glossary which achieves the
highest extra-coverage values. To get a better in-
sight into the quality of extra-coverage we calcu-
lated the percentage of named entities (i.e., encyclo-
pedic) among the terms extracted by each of the dif-
ferent approaches. Comparing results across the (E)
columns of Table 2 it can be seen that high percent-
ages of the terms extracted by Wikipedia are named
entities, which is in marked contrast to the 0%-1%
extracted by ProToDog. This is as should be ex-
pected for an encyclopedia, whose coverage focuses
on people, places, brands, etc. rather than concepts.

To summarize, ProToDoG PTM outperforms both
BoW and Wikipedia in terms of precision, while
at the same time achieving both competitive cov-
erage and extra-coverage. The Wikipedia glossary
suffers from fluctuating precision values across do-
mains and overly encyclopedic coverage of terms.

4.2 Glosses

We show the results of gloss evaluation in Table 2
(last two columns) for ProToDoG PTM and BoW
(we do not report the precision values for Wikipedia,
as they are slightly lower than those obtained for
terms). Precision ranges between 89% and 99%
for ProToDoG PTM and between 82% and 97%
for BoW. We observe that these results are strongly
correlated with the precision of the extracted terms
(cf. Table 2), because the retrieved glosses of do-
main terms are usually in-domain too, and follow a
definitional style since they come from glossaries.
Note, however, that the gloss precision could also be

5 Comparative Evaluation

5.1 Comparison with Google Define

We performed a comparison with Google Define,8

a state-of-the-art definition search service. This
service inputs a term query and outputs a list of
glosses. First, we randomly sampled 100 terms
from our gold standard for each domain. Next, for
each domain, we manually calculated the fraction
of terms for which at least one in-domain defini-
tion was provided by Google Define and ProToDoG.

8Accessible from Google search with the define: key-
word.

Table 3 shows the coverage results. In this exper-
iment, Google Define outperforms our system on
9 of the 10 analyzed domains. However, we note
that when searching for domain-specific knowledge
only, Google Define: i) needs to know the domain
term to be defined in advance, while ProToDoG
jointly acquires domain terms and glosses starting
from just a few seeds; ii) does not discriminate be-
tween glosses pertaining to the target domain and
glosses pertaining to other fields or senses, whereas
ProToDog extracts terms and glosses specific to each
domain of interest.

5.2 Comparison with TaxoLearn

We also compared ProToDoG with the output of
a state-of-the-art taxonomy learning framework,
called TaxoLearn (Navigli et al., 2011). We did
this because i) TaxoLearn extracts terms and glosses
from domain corpora in order to create a domain tax-
onomy; ii) it is one of the few systems which extracts
both terms and glosses from specialized corpora; iii)
the extracted glossaries are available online.9 There-
fore we compared the performance of ProToDoG on
two domains for which glossaries were extracted by
TaxoLearn, i.e. AI and Finance. The glossaries were
harvested from large collections of scholarly arti-
cles. For ProToDoG we selected 10 seeds to cover
all the fields of AI, while for the financial domain
we selected the same 5 seeds used in the Business

We show the number of extracted terms and

glosses for ProToDoG and TaxoLearn in Table 5.
We also show the precision values calculated on a
random sample of 5% of terms and glosses. As can
be clearly seen, on both domains ProToDoG extracts
a number of terms and glosses which is an order
of magnitude greater than those obtained by Tax-
oLearn, while at the same time obtaining consider-
ably higher precision.

6 Related Work

Current approaches to automatic glossary acquisi-
tion suffer from two main issues: i) the poor avail-
ability of large domain-specific corpora from which
terms and glosses are extracted at different times;
ii) the focus on individual domains. ProToDog ad-
dresses both issues by providing a joint multi-
domain approach to term and glossary extraction.

Among the approaches which extract unre-
stricted textual definitions from open text, Fujii and
Ishikawa (2000) determine the definitional nature of
text fragments by using an n-gram model, whereas
Klavans and Muresan (2001) apply pattern match-
ing techniques at the lexical level guided by cue

phrases such as “is called” and “is defined as”.
More recently, a domain-independent supervised ap-
proach, named Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), was
presented which learns lattice-based definition clas-
sifiers applied to candidate sentences containing the
input terms (Navigli and Velardi, 2010). To avoid
the burden of manually creating a training dataset,
definitional patterns can be extracted automatically.
Faralli and Navigli (2013) utilized Wikipedia as
a huge source of definitions and simple, yet ef-
fective heuristics to automatically annotate them.
Reiplinger et al. (2012) experimented with two dif-
ferent approaches for the acquisition of lexical-
syntactic patterns. The first approach bootstraps pat-
terns from a domain corpus and then manually re-
fines the acquired patterns. The second approach, in-
stead, automatically acquires definitional sentences
by using a more sophisticated syntactic and seman-
tic processing. The results show high precision
in both cases. However, all the above approaches
need large domain corpora, the poor availability of
which hampers the creation of wide-coverage glos-
saries for several domains. To avoid the need to
use a large corpus, domain terminologies can be ob-
tained by using Doubly-Anchored Patterns (DAPs)

which, given a (term, hypernym) pair, extract from
the Web sentences matching manually-defined pat-
terns like “<hypernym> such as <term>, and *”
(Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b). This term extrac-
tion process is further extended by harvesting new
hypernyms using the corresponding inverse pat-
terns (called DAP−1) like “* such as <term1>, and
<term2>”. Similarly to ProToDoG, this approach
drops the requirement of a domain corpus and starts
from a small number of (term, hypernym) seeds.
However, while DAPs have proven useful in the in-
duction of domain taxonomies (Kozareva and Hovy,
2010b), they cannot be applied to the glossary learn-
ing task because the extracted sentences are not for-
mal definitions. In contrast, ProToDoG performs
the novel task of multi-domain glossary acquisition
from the Web by bootstrapping the extraction pro-
cess with a few (term, hypernym) seeds. Bootstrap-
ping techniques (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gra-
vano, 2000; Paşca et al., 2006) have been success-
fully applied to several tasks, including learning se-
mantic relations (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006),
extracting surface text patterns for open-domain
question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002),
semantic tagging (Huang and Riloff, 2010) and un-
supervised Word Sense Disambiguation (Yarowsky,
1995). ProToDoG synergistically integrates boot-
strapping with probabilistic topic models so as to
keep the glossary acquisition process within the tar-
get domains as much as possible.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented ProToDoG, a new,
minimally-supervised approach to multi-domain
glossary acquisition. Starting from a small set of hy-
pernymy seeds which identify each domain of inter-
est, we apply a bootstrapping approach which itera-
tively obtains generalized patterns from Web glos-
saries and then applies them to the extraction of

term/gloss pairs. To our knowledge, ProToDoG is
the first approach to large-scale probabilistic glos-
sary learning which jointly acquires thousands of
terms and glosses for dozens of domains with mini-
mal supervision.

At the core of ProToDoG lies our glossary boot-
strapping approach, thanks to which we can drop
the requirements of existing techniques such as the
ready availability of domain corpora, which often do
not contain enough definitions (cf. Table 5), and the
manual definition of lexical patterns, which typically
extract sentence snippets instead of formal glosses.

ProToDoG will be made available to the re-
search community. Beyond the immediate usabil-
ity of the output glossaries (we show an excerpt
in Table 4), we also wish to show the benefit
of ProToDoG in gloss-driven approaches to taxon-
omy learning (Navigli et al., 2011; Velardi et al.,
2013) and Word Sense Disambiguation (Duan and
Yates, 2010; Faralli and Navigli, 2012). The 30-
domain glossaries and gold standards created for
our experiments are available from http://lcl.
uniroma1.it/protodog.

We remark that the terminologies covered with
ProToDoG are not only precise, but are also one
order of magnitude greater than those covered in
individual online glossaries. As future work, we
plan to study the ability of ProToDoG to acquire
domain glossaries at different levels of specificity
(i.e., domains vs. subdomains). Finally, we will
adapt ProToDoG to other languages, by translating
the glossary keyword used in step (2), along the
lines of (De Benedictis et al., 2013).
