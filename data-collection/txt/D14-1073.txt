Abstract

In this paper we present our task-based
evaluation of query biased summarization
for cross-language information retrieval
(CLIR) using relevance prediction. We de-
scribe our 13 summarization methods each
from one of four summarization strate-
gies. We show how well our methods
perform using Farsi text from the CLEF
2008 shared-task, which we translated to
English automtatically. We report preci-
sion/recall/F1, accuracy and time-on-task.
We found that different summarization
methods perform optimally for different
evaluation metrics, but overall query bi-
ased word clouds are the best summariza-
tion strategy. In our analysis, we demon-
strate that using the ROUGE metric on our
sentence-based summaries cannot make
the same kinds of distinctions as our evalu-
ation framework does. Finally, we present
our recommendations for creating much-
needed evaluation standards and datasets.

1 Introduction

Despite many recent advances in query biased
summarization for cross-language information re-
trieval (CLIR), there are no existing evaluation
standards or datasets to make comparisons among
different methods, and across different languages
(Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Pingali et al.,
2007; McCallum et al., 2012; Bhaskar and Bandy-
opadhyay, 2012). Consider that creating this
kind of summary requires familiarity with tech-
niques from machine translation (MT), summa-
rization, and information retrieval (IR). In this

This work was sponsored by the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation under Air Force Contract FA8721-05-C-0002. Opin-
ions, interpretations, conclusions, and recommendations are

paper, we arrive at the intersection of each of
these research areas. Query biased summariza-
tion (also known as query-focused, query-relevant,
and query-dependent) involves automatically cap-
turing relevant ideas and content from a document
with respect to a given query, and presenting it as a
condensed version of the original document. This
kind of summarization is mostly used in search en-
gines because when search results are tailored to a
user’s information need, the user can find texts that
they are looking for more quickly and more ac-
curately (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Mori et
al., 2004). Query biased summarization is a valu-
able research area in natural language processing
(NLP), especially for CLIR. Users of CLIR sys-
tems meet their information needs by submitting
their queries in L1 to search through documents
that have been composed in L2, even though they
may not be familiar with L2 (Hovy et al., 1999;
Pingali et al., 2007).

There are no standards for objectively evaluat-
ing summaries for CLIR – a research gap that we
begin to address in this paper. The problem we
explore is two-fold: what kinds of summaries are
well-suited for CLIR applications, and how should
the summaries be evaluated. Our evaluation is ex-
trinsic, that is to say we are interested in how sum-
marization affects performance on a different task
(Mani et al., 2002; McKeown et al., 2005; Dorr
et al., 2005; Murray et al., 2009; McCallum et
al., 2012). We use relevance prediction as our ex-
trinsic task: a human must decide if a summary
for a given document is relevant to a particular in-
formation need, or not. Relevance prediction is
known to be useful as it correlates with some au-
tomatic intrinsic methods as well (President and
Dorr, 2006; Hobson et al., 2007). To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to apply this eval-
uation framework to cross language query biased
summarization.

Each one of the summarization methods that we

657



present in this paper belongs to one of the fol-
lowing strategies: (1) unbiased full machine trans-
lated text, (2) unbiased word clouds, (3) query bi-
ased word clouds, and (4) query biased sentence
summaries. The methods and strategies that we
present are fast, cheap, and language-independent.
All of these strategies are extractive, meaning that
we used existing parts of a document to create the
condensed version, or summary.

We approach our task as an engineering prob-
lem: the goal is to decide if summaries are good
enough to help CLIR system users find what they
are looking for. We have simplified the task by as-
suming that a set of documents has already been
retrieved from a search engine, as CLIR tech-
niques are outside the scope of this paper. We
predict that showing the full MT English text as
a summarization strategy would not be particu-
larly helpful in our relevance prediction task be-
cause the words in the text could be mixed-up,
or sentences could be nonsensical, resulting in
poor readability. For the same reasons, we expect
that showing the full MT English text would take
longer to arrive at a relevance decision. Finally,
we predict that query biased summaries will result
in faster, more accurate decisions from the partic-
ipants (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998).

We treat the actual CLIR search engine as if it
were a black box so that we can focus on evaluat-
ing if the summaries themselves are useful. As a
starting point, we begin with some principles that
we expect to hold true when we evaluate. These
principles provide us with the kind of framework
that we need for a productive and judicious dis-
cussion about how well a summarization method
works. We encourage the NLP community to
consider the following concepts when developing
evaluation standards for this problem:

• End-user intelligiblity
• Query-salience
• Retrieval-relevance

Summaries should be presented to the end-user in
a way that is both concise and intelligible, even
if the machine translated text is difficult to under-
stand. Our notions of query-salience and retrieval-
relevance capture the expectation that good sum-
maries will be efficient enough to help end-users
fulfill their information needs. For query-salience,
we want users to positively identify relevant doc-
uments. Similarly, for retrieval-relevance we want

users to be able to find as many relevant docu-
ments as possible.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2
presents related work; Section 3 describes our data
and pre-processing; Section 4 details our sum-
marization methods and strategies; Section 5 de-
scribes our experiments; Section 6 shows our re-
sults and analysis; and in Section 7, we conclude
and discuss some future directions for the NLP
community.

2 Related Work

Automatic summarization is generally a well-
investigated research area. Summarization is a
way of describing the relationships of words in
documents to the information content of that doc-
ument (Luhn, 1958; Edmunson, 1969; Salton and
Yang, 1973; Robertson and Walker, 1994; Church
and Gale, 1999; Robertson, 2004). Recent work
has looked at creating summaries of single and
multiple documents (Radev et al., 2004; Erkan and
Radev, 2004; Wan et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2012;
Chatterjee et al., 2012), as well as summary eval-
uation (Jing et al., 1998; Tombros and Sanderson
1998; Mani et al., 1998; Mani et al., 1999; Mani,
2001; Lin and Hovy, 2003; Lin, 2004; Nenkova
et al., 2007; Hobson et al., 2007; Owczarzak
et al., 2012), query and topic biased summariza-
tion (Berger and Mittal, 2000; Otterbacher et al.,
2005; Daume and Marcu, 2006; Chali and Joty,
2008; Otterbacher et al., 2009; Bando et al., 2010;
Bhaskar and Bandyopadhyay, 2012; Harwath and
Hazen, 2012; Yin et al., 2012), and summarization
across languages (Pingali et al., 2007; Orăsan and
Chiorean, 2008; Wan et al., 2010; Azarbonyad et
al., 2013).

2.1 Query Biased Summarization

Previous work most closely related to our own
comes from Pingali et al., (2007). In their work,
they present their method for cross-language
query biased summarization for Telugu and En-
glish. Their work was motivated by the need for
people to have access to foreign-language docu-
ments from a search engine even though the users
were not familiar with the foreign language, in
their case English. They used language model-
ing and translation probability to translate a user’s
query into L2, and then summarized each docu-
ment in L2 with respect to the query. In their final
step, they translated the summary from L2 back

658



to L1 for the user. They evaluated their method
on the DUC 2005 query-focused summarization
shared-task with ROUGE scores. We compare our
methods to this work also on the DUC 2005 task.
Our work demonstrates the first attempt to draw at
a comparison between user-based studies and in-
trinsic evaluation with ROUGE. However, one of
the limitations with evaluating this way is that the
shared-task documents and queries are monolin-
gual.

Bhaskar and Bandyopadhyay (2012) tried a
subjective evaluation of extractive cross-language
query biased summarization for 7 different lan-
guages. They extracted sentences, then scored and
ranked the sentences to generate query dependent
snippets of documents for their cross lingual in-
formation access (CLIA) system. However, the
snippet quality was determined subjectively based
on scores on a scale of 0 to 1 (with 1 being best).
Each score indicated annotator satisfaction for a
given snippet. Our evaluation methodology is ob-
jective: we ask users to decide if a given document
is relevant to an information need, or not.

2.2 Machine Translation Effects

Machine translation quality can affect summa-
rization quality. Wan et al. (2010) researched
the effects of MT quality prediction on cross-
language document summarization. They gener-
ated 5-sentence summaries in Chinese using En-
glish source documents. To select sentences, they
used predicted translation quality, sentence posi-
tion, and sentence informativeness. In their eval-
uation, they employed 4 Chinese-speakers to sub-
jectively rate summaries on a 5-point scale (5 be-
ing best) along the dimensions of content, read-
ability, and overall impression. They showed that
their approach of using MT quality scores did im-
prove summarization quality on average. While
their findings are important, their work did not ad-
dress query biasing or objective evaluation of the
summaries. We attempt to overcome limitations of
machine translation quality by using word clouds
as one of our summarization strategies.

Knowing when to translate is another challenge
for cross-language query biased summarization.
Several options exist for when and what to trans-
late during the summarization process: (1) the
source documents can be translated, (2) the user’s
query can be translated, (3) the final summary can
be translated, or (4) some combination of these.

An example of translating only the summaries
themselves can be found in Wan et al., (2010).
On the other hand, Pingali et al. (2007) translated
the queries and the summaries. In our work, we
used gold-translated queries from the CLEF 2008
dataset, and machine translated source documents.
We briefly address this in our work, but note that a
full discussion of when and what to translate, and
those effects on summarization quality, is outside
of the scope of this paper.

2.3 Summarization Evaluation

There has been a lot of work towards developing
metrics for understanding what makes a summary
good. Evaluation metrics are either intrinsic or ex-
trinsic. Intrinsic metrics, such as ROUGE, mea-
sure the quality of a summary with respect to gold
human-generated summaries (Lin, 2004; Lin and
Hovy, 2003). Generating gold standard summaries
is expensive and time-consuming, a problem that
persists with cross-language query biased summa-
rization because those summaries must be query
biased as well as in a different language from the
source documents.

On the other hand, extrinsic metrics measure the
quality of summaries at the system level, by look-
ing at overall system performance on downstream
tasks (Jing et al, 1998; Tombros and Sanderson,
1998). One of the most important findings for
query biased summarization comes from Tombros
and Sanderson (1998). In their monolingual task-
based evaluation, they measured user speed and
accuracy at identifying relevant documents. They
found that query biased summarization improved
the user speed and accuracy when the user was
asked to make relevance judgements for IR tasks.
We also expect that our evaluation will demon-
strate that user speed and accuracy is better when
summaries are query biased.

3 Data and Pre-Processing

We used data from the Farsi CLEF 2008 ad hoc
task (Agirre et al., 2009). Each of the queries in-
cluded in this dataset consisted of a title, narrative,
and description. Figure 1 shows an example of the
elements of a CLEF 2008 query. All of the au-
tomatic query-biasing in this work was based on
the query titles. For our human relevance predic-
tion task on Mechanical Turk, we used the nar-
rative version. The CLEF 2008 dataset included
a ground-truth answer key indicating which docu-

659



ments were relevant to each query. For each query,
we randomly selected 5 documents that were rele-
vant as well as 5 documents that were not relevant.
The subset of CLEF 2008 data that we used there-
fore consisted of 500 original Farsi documents and
50 parallel English-Farsi queries. Next we will de-
scribe our text pre-processing steps for both lan-
guages as well as how we created our parallel En-
glish documents.

Figure 1: Full MT English summary and CLEF
2008 English query (title, description, narrative).

3.1 English Documents
All of our English documents were created auto-
matically by translating the original Farsi docu-
ments into English (Drexler et al., 2012). The
translated documents were sentence-aligned with
one sentence per line. For all of our summariza-
tion experiments (except unbised full MT text),
we processed the text as follows: removed extra
spaces, removed punctuation, folded to lowercase,
and removed digits. We also removed common
English stopwords2 from the texts.

3.2 Farsi Documents
We used the original CLEF 2008 Farsi docu-
ments for two of our summarization methods. We
stemmed words in each document using automatic
morphological analysis with Morfessor CatMAP.
We note that within-sentence punctuation was re-
moved during this process (Creutz and Lagus,
2007). We also removed Farsi stopwords and dig-
its.

4 Summarization Strategies

All of our summarization methods were extrac-
tive except for unbiased full machine translated
text. In this section, we describe each of our
13 summarization methods which we have orga-
nized into one of the following strategies: (1) un-
biased full machine translated text, (2) unbiased

2English and Farsi stopword lists from:
http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/index.html

word cloud summaries, (3) query biased word
cloud summaries, and (4) query biased sentence
summaries. Regardless of which summarization
method used, we highlighted words in yellow that
also appeard in the query. Let t be a term in
document d where d ∈ DL and DL is a collec-
tion of documents in a particular language. Note
that for our summarization methods, term weight-
ings were calculated separately for each language.
While |D| = 1000, we calculated term weightings
based on |DE | = 500 and |DF | = 500. Finally,
let q be a query where q ∈ Q and Q is our set of
50 parallel English-Farsi CLEF queries. Assume
that log refers to log10.

Figure 2: Full MT English summary and CLEF
2008 English query.

4.1 Unbiased Full Machine Translated
English

Our first baseline approach was to use all of the
raw machine translation output (no subsets of
the sentences were used). Each summary there-
fore consisted of the full text of an entire doc-
ument automatically translated from Farsi to En-
glish (Drexler et al., 2012). Figure 2 shows an ex-
ample full text document translated from Farsi to
English and a gold-standard English CLEF query.
Note that we use this particular document-query
pair as an example throughout this paper (docu-
ment: H-770622-42472S8, query: 10.2452/552-
AH). According to the CLEF answer key, the sam-
ple document is relevant to the sample query.

4.2 Unbiased Word Clouds

For our second baseline approach, we ranked
terms in a document and displayed them as word
clouds. Word clouds are one a way to arrange
a collection of words where each word can vary

660



in size. We used word clouds as a summariza-
tion strategy to overcome any potential disfluen-
cies from the machine translation output and also
to see if they are feasible at all for summarization.
All of our methods for word clouds used words
from machine translated English text. Each term-
ranking method below generates different ranked
lists of terms, which we used to create different
word clouds. We created one word cloud per doc-
ument using the top 12 ranked words. We used
the raw term scores to scale text font size, so that
words with a highter score appeared larger and
more prominent in a word cloud. Words were
shuffled such that the exact ordering of words was
at random.

I: Term Frequency (TF) Term frequency is
very commonly used for finding important terms
in a document. Given a term t in a document d,
the number of times that term occurs is:

tft,d = |t ∈ d|
II: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) The
idf term weighting is typically used in IR and
other text categorization tasks to make distinc-
tions between documents. The version of idf that
we used throughout our work came from Erkan
and Radev (2004) and Otterbacher et al. (2009),
in keeping consistent with theirs. Let N be the
number of documents in the collection, such that
N = |D| and nt is the number of documents that
contain term t, such that nt = |{d ∈ D : t ∈ d}|,
then:

idft = log
N + 1

0.5× nt
While idf is usually thought of as a type of

heuristic, there have been some discussions about
its theoretical basis (Robertson, 2004; Robertson
and Walker, 1994; Church and Gale, 1999; Salton
and Yang, 1973). An example of this summary is
shown in Figure 3.

III: Term Frequency Inverse Document Fre-
quency (TFIDF) We use tfidft,d term weight-
ing to find terms which are both rare and impor-
tant for a document, with respect to terms across
all other documents in the collection:

tfidft,d = tft,d × idft
4.3 Query Biased Word Clouds
We generated query biased word clouds following
the same principles as our unbiased word clouds,

Figure 3: Word cloud summary for inverse docu-
ment frequency (IDF), for query “Tehran’s stock
market”.

namely the text font scaling and highlighting re-
mained the same.

IV. Query Biased Term Frequency (TFQ) In
Figure 4 we show a sample word cloud summary
based on query biased term frequency. We define
query biased term frequency tfQ at the document
level, as:

tfQt,d,q =

{
2tft,d, if t ∈ q
tft,d, otherwise

Figure 4: Word cloud summary for query biased
term frequency (TFQ), for query “Tehran’s stock
market”.

V. Query Biased Inverse Document Frequency
(IDFQ) Since idf helps with identifying terms
that discriminate documents in a collection, we
would expect that query biased idf would help to
identify documents that are relevant to a query:

idfQt,q =

{
2idft, if t ∈ q
idft, otherwise

VI. Query Biased TFIDF (TFIDFQ) We de-
fine query biased tf × idf similarly to our TFQ
and IDFQ, at the document level:

tfidfQt,d,q =

{
2tft,d × idft, if t ∈ q
tft,d × idft, otherwise

661



Figure 5: Word cloud summary for scaled query
biased term frequency (SFQ) for query “Tehran’s
stock market”.

VII. Query Biased Scaled Frequency (SFQ)
This term weighting scheme, which we call scaled
query biased term frequency or sfQ, is a variant of
the traditional tf×idf weighting. First, we project
the usual term frequency into log-space, for a term
t in document d with:

tfSt,d = log(tft,d)

We let tfSt,d ≈ 0 when tft,d = 1. We believe that
singleton terms in a document provide no indica-
tion that a document is query-relevant, and trea-
ment of singleton terms in this way would have the
potential to reduce false-positives in our relevance
prediction task. Note that scaled term frequency
differs from Robertson’s (2004) inverse total term
frequency in the sense that our method involves no
consideration of term position within a document.
Scaled query biased term frequency, shown in Fig-
ure 5, is defined as:

sfQt,d,q =

{
2tfSt,d × idft, if t ∈ q
tfSt,d × idft, otherwise

VIII. Word Relevance (W) We adapted an
existing relevance weighting from Allan et al.,
(2003), that was originally formulated for ranking
sentences with respect to a query. However, we
modified their originaly ranking method so that we
could rank individual terms in a document instead
of sentences. Our method for word relevance, W
is defined as:

Wt,d,q = log(tft,d + 1)× log(tft,q + 1)× idft
In W , term frequency values are smoothed by

adding 1. The smoothing could especially af-
fect rare terms and singletons, when tft,d is very

low. All terms in a query or a document will
be weighted and each term could potentially con-
tribute to summary.

4.4 Query Biased Sentence Summaries
Sentences are a canonical unit to use in extractive
summaries. In this section we describe four differ-
ent sentence scoring methods that we used. These
methods show how to calculate sentence scores for
a given document with respect to a given query.
Sentences for a document were always ranked us-
ing the raw score value output generated from a
scoring method. Each document summary con-
tained the top 3 ranked sentences where the sen-
tences were simply listed out. Each of these meth-
ods used sentence-aligned English machine trans-
lated documents, and two of them also used the
original Farsi text.

IX. Sentence Relevance (REL) Our sentence
relevance scoring method comes from Allan et al.
(2003). The sentence weight is a summation over
words that appear in the query. We provide their
sentence scoring formula here. This calculates the
relevance score for a sentence s from document d,
to a query q:

rel(s|q) =
∑
t∈s

log(tft,s +1)× log(tft,q +1)× idft

Terms will occur in either the sentence or the
query, or both. We applied this method to machine
tranlsated English text. The output of this method
is a relevance score for each sentence in a given
document. We used those scores to rank sentences
in each document from our English machine trans-
lated text.

X. Query Biased Lexrank (LQ) We imple-
mented query biased LexRank, a well-known
graph-based summarization method (Otterbacher
et al., 2009). It is a modified version of the orig-
inal LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004;
Page et al., 1998). The similarity metric, simx,y,
also known as idf-modified cosine similarity, mea-
sures the distance between two sentences x and y
in a document d, defined as:

simx,y =

∑
t∈x,y tft,x × tft,y × (idft)2√∑
t∈x tfidf

2
t,x

√∑
t∈y tfidf

2
t,y

We used simx,y to score the similarity of
sentence-to-sentence, resulting in a similarity

662



Figure 6: LQP - projecting Farsi sentence scores
onto parallel English sentences.

graph where each vertex was a sentence and each
edge was the cosine similarity between sentences.
We normalized the cosine matrix with a similarity
threshold (t = 0.05), so that sentences above this
threshold were given similarity 1, and 0 otherwise.
We used rel(s|q) to score sentence-to-query. The
LexRank score for each sentence was then calcu-
lated as:

LQs|q =
d× rels|q∑

z∈C relz|q
+ (1− d)×∑

v∈adj[s]

sims,v∑
r∈adj[v] simv,r

LQv|q

where C is the set of all sentences in a given doc-
ument. Here the parameter d is just a damper to
designate a probability of randomly jumping to
one of the sentences in the graph (d = 0.7). We
found the stationary distribution by applying the
power method (� = 5), which is guaranteed to
converge to a stationary distribution (Otterbacher
et al., 2009). The output of LQ is a score for each
sentence from a given document with respect to
a query. We used that score to rank sentences in
each document from our English machine trans-
lated text.

XI. Projected Cross-Language Query Biased
Lexrank (LQP) We introduce LQP to describe
a way of scoring and ranking sentences such that
the L1 (English) summaries are biased from the
L2 (Farsi) query and source document. Our gold-
standard Farsi queries were included with our
CLEF 2008 data, making them more reliable than
what we could get from automatic translation.
First, sentences from each Farsi document were
scored with Farsi queries using LQ, described
above. Then each LQ score was projected onto
sentence-aligned English. We demonstrate LQP

Figure 7: LQC - Farsi sentence scores are com-
bined with parallel English sentence scores to ob-
tain sentence re-ranking.

in Figure 6. By doing this, we simulated trans-
lating the user’s English query into Farsi with the
best possible query translation, before proceed-
ing with summarization. This approach to cross-
language summarization could be of interest for
CLIR systems that do query translation on-the-fly.
It is also of interest for summarization systems that
need to utilize previously translated source docu-
ments the capability is lacking to translate sum-
maries from L2 to L1.

XII. Combinatory Query Biased Lexrank
(LQC) Another variation of LexRank that we
introduce in this work is LQC, which combines
LexRank scores from both languages to re-rank
sentences. A visual summary of this method is
shown in Figure 7. We accomplished our re-
ranking by first running LQ on Farsi and English
separately, then adding the two scores together.
This combination of Farsi and English scores pro-
vided us with a different way to score and rank
sentences, compared with LQ and LQP . The
idea behind combinatory query biased LexRank
is to take advantage of sentences which are high-
ranking in Farsi but not in English. The LQC
method exploits all available resources in our
dataset: L1 and L2 queries as well as L1 and L2
documents.

5 Experiments

We tested each of our summarization methods and
overall strategies in a task-based evaluation frame-
work using relevance prediction. We used Me-
chanical Turk for our experiments since it has been
shown to be useful for evaluating NLP systems
(Callison-Burch 2009; Gillick and Liu, 2010). We
obtained human judgments for whether or not a
document was considered relevant to a query, or
information need. We measured the relevance

663



judgements by precision/recall/F1, accuracy, and
also time-on-task based on the average response
time per Human Intelligence Task (HIT).

5.1 Mechanical Turk

In our Mechanical Turk experiment, we used ter-
minology from CLEF 2008 to describe a query
as an “information need”. All of the Mechanical
Turk workers were presented with the following
for their individual HIT: instructions, an informa-
tion need and one summary for a document. Work-
ers were asked to indicate if the given summary
for a document was relevant to the given informa-
tion need (Hobson et al., 2007). Workers were
not shown the original Farsi source documents.
We paid workers $0.01 per HIT. We obtained 5
HITs for each information need and summary pair.
We used a built-in approval rate qualification pro-
vided by Mechanical Turk to restrict which work-
ers could work on our tasks. Each worker had an
approval rate of at least 95

Instructions: Each image below consists
of a statement summarizing the informa-
tion you are trying to find from a set
of documents followed by a summary
of one of the documents returned when
you query the documents. Based on the
summary, choose whether you think the
document returned is relevant to the in-
formation need. NOTE: It may be diffi-
cult to distinguish whether the document
is relevant as the text may be difficult
to understand. Just use your best judg-
ment.

6 Results and Analysis

We present our experiment results and additional
analysis. First, we report the results of our rel-
evance prediction task, showing performance for
individual summarization methods as well as per-
formance for the overall strategies. Then we
show analysis of our results from the monolin-
gual question-biased shared-task for DUC 2005,
as well as a comparison to previous work.

6.1 Results for Individual Methods

Our results are shown in Table 1. We report perfor-
mance for 13 individual methods as well as over-
all peformance on the 4 different summarization
strategies. To calculate the performance for each

strategy, we used the arithmetic mean of the corre-
sponding individual methods. We measured preci-
sion, recall and F1 to give us a sense of our sum-
maries might influence document retrieval in an
actual CLIR system. We also measured accuracy
and time-on-task. For these latter two metrics, we
distinguish between summaries that were relevant
(R) and non-relevant (NR).

All of the summarization-based methods fa-
vored recall over precision: documents were
marked ‘relevant’ more often than ‘non-relevant’.
For many of the methods shown in Table 1, work-
ers spent more time correctly deciding ‘relevant’
than correctly deciding ‘non-relevant’. This sug-
gests some workers participated in our Mechanical
Turk task purposefully. For many of the summa-
rization methods, workers were able to positively
identify relevant documents.

From Table 1 we see that Full MT performed
better on precision than all of the other methods
and strategies, but we note that performance on
precision was generally very low. This might be
due to Mechanical Turk workers overgeneraliz-
ing by marking summaries as relevant when they
were not. Some individual methods preserve our
principle of retrieval-relevance, as indicated by
the higher recall scores for SQF, LQEF, and TFQ.
That is to say, these particular query biased sum-
marization methods can be used to assist users
with identifying more relevant documents. The ac-
curacy on relevant documents addresses our prin-
ciple of query-salience, and it is especially high
for our query-biased methods: LQEF, SQF, LQ,
and TFQ. The results also seem to fit our intuition
that the summary in Figure 3 seems less relevant
to the summaries shown in Figures 4 & 5 even
though these are the same documents biased on
the same query “Tehran stock market”.

Overall, query biased word clouds outperform
the other summarization strategies for 5 out of
7 metrics. This could be due to the fact that
word clouds provide a very concise and overview
of a document, which is one of the main goals
for automatic summarization. Along these lines,
word clouds are probably not subject to the effects
of MT quality and we believe it is possible that
MT quality could have had a negative impact on
our query biased extracted sentence summaries, as
well as our full MT English texts.

6.2 Analysis with DUC 2005

We analysed our summarization methods by
comparing two of our sentence-based methods
(LQ and REL) with peers from the monolin-
gual question-biased summarization shared-task
for DUC 2005. Even though DUC 2005 is a mono-
lingual task, we decided to use it as part of our
analysis for two reasons: (1) to see how well we
could do with query/question biasing while ignor-
ing the variables introduced by MT and cross-
language text, and (2) to make a comparison to
previous work. Pingali et al., (2007) also used this
the same DUC task to assess their cross-language
query biased summarization system. Systems

from the DUC 2005 question-biased summariza-
tion task were evaluated automatically against hu-
man gold-standard summaries using ROUGE (Lin
and Hovy, 2003) . Our results from the DUC
2005 shared-task are shown in Table 2, reported
as ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 f-scores, as these
two variations of ROUGE are the most helpful
(Dang, 2005; Pingali et al., 2007).

Table 2 shows scores for several top peer sys-
tems, as well as results for the Tel-Eng-Sum
method from Pingali et al., (2007). While we have
reported f-scores in our analysis, we also note that
our implementations of LQ and REL outperform
all of the DUC 2005 peer systems for precision, as
shown in Table 3. We also know that ROUGE can-
not be used for comparing sentence summaries to
ranked lists of words and there are no existing in-
trinsic methods to make that kind of comparison.
Therefore we were able to successfully compare
just 2 of our sentence-based methods to previous
work using ROUGE.

7 Discussion and Future Work

Cross-language query biased summarization is an
important part of CLIR, because it helps the user
decide which foreign-language documents they
might want to read. But, how do we know if

Table 3: Top 3 system precision scores for
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4.

Peer ID ROUGE-2 ROUGE-SU4
LQ 0.08272 0.15197

REL 0.0809 0.15049
15 0.07249 0.13129

a query biased summary is “good enough” to be
used in a real-world CLIR system? We want to
be able to say that we can do query biased sum-
marization just as well for both monolingual and
cross-language IR systems. From previous work,
there has been some variability with regard to
when and what to translate - variables which have
no impact on monolingual summarization. We at-
tempted to address this issue with two of our meth-
ods: LQP and LQC. To fully exploit the MT vari-
able, we would need many more relevance pre-
diction experiments using humans who know L1
and others who know L2. Unfortunately in our
case, we were not able to find Farsi speakers on
Mechanical Turk. Access to these speakers would
have allowed us to try further experiments as well
as other kinds of analysis.

Our results on the relevance prediction task
tell us that query biased summarization strategies
help users identify relevant documents faster and
with better accuracy than unbiased summaries.
Our findings support the findings of Tombros and
Sanderson (1998). Another important finding is
that now we can weigh tradeoffs so that different
summarization methods could be used to optimize
over different metrics. For example, if we want
to optimize for retrieval-relevance we might select
a summarization method that tends to have higher
recall, such as scaled query biased term frequency
(SFQ). Similarly, we could optimize over accu-
racy on relevant documents, and use Combinatory
LexRank (LQC) with Farsi and English together.

We have shown that the relevance prediction
tasks can be crowdsourced on Mechanical Turk
with reasonable results. The data we used from
the Farsi CLEF 2008 ad-hoc task included an an-
swer key, but there were no parallel English docu-
ments. However, in order for the NLP community
to make strides in evaluating cross-language query
biased summarization for CLIR, we will need star-
dards and data. Optimal data would be parallel
datasets consisting of documents in L1 and L2
with queries in L1 and L2 along with an answer

key specifying which documents are relevant to
the queries. Further we would also need sets of
human gold-standard query biased summaries in
L1 and L2. These standards and data would al-
low us to compare method-to-method across dif-
ferent languages, while simultaneously allowing
us to tease apart other variables such as: when and
what to translate, translation quality, methods for
biasing, and type of summarization strategy (sen-
tences, words, etc). And of course it would be bet-
ter if this standard dataset was multilingual instead
of billingual, for obvious reasons.

We have approached cross-language query bi-
ased summarization as a stand-alone problem,
treating the CLIR system and document retrieval
as a black box. However, summaries need to pre-
serve query-salience: summaries should not make
it more difficult to positively identify relavant doc-
uments. And they should also preserve retrieval-
relevance: summaries should help users identify
as many relevant documents as possible.
