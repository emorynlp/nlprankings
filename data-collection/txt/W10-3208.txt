Abstract 

The discipline where sentiment/ opi-

nion/ emotion has been identified and 

classified in human written text is well 

known as sentiment analysis. A typical 

computational approach to sentiment 

analysis starts with prior polarity lex-

icons where entries are tagged with 

their prior out of context polarity as 

human beings perceive using their 

cognitive knowledge. Till date, all re-

search efforts found in sentiment lex-

icon literature deal mostly with English 

texts. In this article, we propose mul-

tiple computational techniques like, 

WordNet based, dictionary based, cor-

pus based or generative approaches for 

generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian 

languages. Currently, SentiWordNet(s) 

are being developed for three Indian 

languages: Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. 

An online intuitive game has been de-

veloped to create and validate the de-

veloped SentiWordNet(s) by involving 

Internet population. A number of au-

tomatic, semi-automatic and manual 

validations and evaluation methodolo-

gies have been adopted to measure the 

coverage and credibility of the devel-

oped SentiWordNet(s). 

1 Introduction 

Sentiment analysis and classification from 

electronic text is a hard semantic disambigua-

tion problem. The regulating aspects of seman-

tic orientation of a text are natural language 

context information (Pang et al., 2002) lan-

guage properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), 

domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Ga-

mon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the 

time dimension (Read, 2005). 

The following example shows that the polar-

ity tag associated with a sentiment word de-

pends on the time dimension. During 90’s mo-

bile phone users generally reported in various 

online reviews about their color phones but in 

recent times color phone is not just enough. 

People are fascinated and influenced by touch 

screen and various software(s) installation fa-

cilities on these new generation gadgets. 

In typical computational approaches (Higa-

shinaka et al., 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 

2000) to sentiment analysis researchers con-

sider the problem of learning a dictionary that 

maps semantic representations to verbaliza-

tions, where the data comes from opinionated 

electronic text. Although lexicons in these dic-

tionaries are not explicitly marked up with re-

spect to their contextual semantics, they con-

tain only explicit polarity rating and aspect 

indicators. Lexicon-based approaches can be 

broadly classified into two categories firstly 

where the discriminative polarity tag of lex-

icons is determined on labeled training data 

and secondly where the lexicons are manually 

compiled, the later constitutes the main effec-

tive approach.  

It is undoubted that the manual compilation 

is always the best way to create monolingual 

semantic lexicons, but manual methods are 

expensive in terms of human resources, it in-

volves a substantial number of human annota-

tors and it takes lot of time as well. In this pa-

per we propose several computational tech-

niques to generate sentiment lexicons in Indian 

languages automatically and semi-

automatically. In the present task, SentiWord-

56



Net(s) are being developed for the Bengali, 

Hindi and Telugu languages.  

Several prior polarity sentiment lexicons are 

available for English such as SentiWordNet 

(Esuli et. al., 2006), Subjectivity Word List 

(Wilson et. al., 2005), WordNet Affect list 

(Strapparava et al., 2004), Taboada’s adjective 

list (Taboada et al., 2006).  

Among these publicly available sentiment 

lexicon resources we find that SentiWordNet is 

most widely used (number of citation is higher 

than other resources
1
) in several applications 

such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and 

emotion analysis. Subjectivity Word List is 

most trustable as the opinion mining system 

OpinionFinder
2
 that uses the subjectivity word 

list has reported highest score for opi-

nion/sentiment subjectivity (Wiebe and Riloff, 

2006). SentiWordNet is an automatically con-

structed lexical resource for English that as-

signs a positivity score and a negativity score 

to each WordNet synset.  

The subjectivity word list is compiled from 

manually developed resources augmented with 

entries learned from corpora. The entries in the 

subjectivity word list have been labeled with 

part of speech (POS) tags as well as either 

strong or weak subjective tag depending on the 

reliability of the subjective nature of the entry.  

These two resources have been merged au-

tomatically and the merged resource is used for 

SentiWordNet(s) generation in the present 

task.  

The generated sentiment lexicons or Senti-

WordNet(s) for several Indian languages most-

ly contain synsets (approximately 60%) of re-

spective languages. Synset based method is 

robust for any kind of monolingual lexicon 

creation and useful to avoid further word sense 

disambiguation problem in application domain.  

Additionally we have developed an online 

intuitive game to create and validate the devel-

oped SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internet 

population.  

The proposed approaches in this paper are 

easy to adopt for any new language. To meas-

ure the coverage and credibility of generated 

SentiWordNet(s) in Indian languages we have

developed several automatic and semi-

automatic evaluation methods. 

2 Related Works 

Various methods have been used in the litera-

ture such as WordNet based, dictionary based, 

corpus based or generative approaches for sen-

timent lexicon generation in a new target lan-

guage.  

Andreevskaia and Bergler, (2006) present a 

method for extracting sentiment-bearing adjec-

tives from WordNet using the Sentiment Tag 

Extraction Program (STEP). They did 58 

STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed 

lists drawn from manually annotated list of 

positive and negative adjectives and evaluated 

the results against other manually annotated 

lists.  

The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff, 

2006) automatically generate resources for 

subjectivity analysis for a new target language 

from the available resources for English. Two 

techniques have been proposed for the genera-

tion of target language lexicon from English 

subjectivity lexicon. The first technique uses a 

bilingual dictionary while the second method 

is a parallel corpus based approach using exist-

ing subjectivity analysis tools for English. 

Automatically or manually created lexicons 

may have limited coverage and do not include 

most semantically contrasting word pairs like 

antonyms. Antonyms are broadly categorized 

(Saif Mohammed, 2008) as gradable adjec-

tives (hot–cold, good–bad, friend–enemy) and 

productive adjectives (normal–abnormal, for-

tune–misfortune, implicit–explicit). The first 

type contains the semantically contrasting 

word pairs but the second type includes ortho-

graphic suffix/affix as a clue. The second type 

is highly productive using very less number of 

affixation rules.  

Degree of antonymy (Mohammad et al., 

2008) is defined to encompass the complete 

semantic range as a combined measure of the 

contrast in meaning conveyed by two antony-

my words and is identified by distributional 

hypothesis. It helps to measure relative senti-

ment score of a word and its antonym.   

Kumaran et al., (2008) introduced a beauti-

ful method for automatic data creation by on-

line intuitive games. A methodology has been 

57



proposed for community creation of linguistic 

data by community collaborative framework 

known as wikiBABEL
3
. It may be described as 

a revolutionary approach to automatically 

create large credible linguistic data by involv-

ing Internet population for content creation.  

For the present task we prefer to involve all 

the available methodologies to automatically 

and semi-automatically create and validate 

SentiWordNet(s) for three Indian languages. 

Automatic methods involve only computation-

al methods. Semi-automatic methods involve 

human interruption to validate system’s output. 

3 Source Lexicon Acquisition  

SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List 

have been identified as the most reliable source 

lexicons. The first one is widely used and the 

second one is robust in terms of performance. 

A merged sentiment lexicon has been devel-

oped from both the resources by removing the 

duplicates. It has been observed that 64% of 

the single word entries are common in the Sub-

jectivity Word List and SentiWordNet. The 

new merged sentiment lexicon consists of 

14,135 numbers of tokens. Several filtering 

techniques have been applied to generate the 

new list. 

A subset of 8,427 sentiment words has been 

extracted from the English SentiWordNet, by 

selecting those whose orientation strength is 

above the heuristically identified threshold 

value of 0.4. The words whose orientation 

strength is below 0.4 are ambiguous and may 

lose their subjectivity in the target language 

after translation. A total of weakly subjective 

2652 words are discarded from the 

Subjectivity word list as proposed in (Wiebe 

and Riloff, 2006). 

In the next stage the words whose POS 

category in the Subjectivity word list is 

undefined and tagged as “anypos” are 

considered. These words may generate sense 

ambiguity issues in the next stages of 

subjectivity detection. The words are checked 

in the SentiWordNet list for validation. If a 

match is found with certain POS category, the 

word is added to the new merged sentiment 

                                                 
3
 http://research.microsoft.com/en-

us/projects/wikibabel/ 

lexicon. Otherwise the word is discarded to 

avoid ambiguities later. 

Some words in the Subjectivity word list are 

inflected e.g., memories. These words would 

be stemmed during the translation process, but 

some words present no subjectivity property 

after stemming (memory has no subjectivity 

property). A word may occur in the 

subjectivity list in many inflected forms. 

Individual clusters for the words sharing the 

same root form are created and then checked in 

the SentiWordNet for validation. If the root 

word exists in the SentiWordNet then it is 

assumed that the word remains subjective after 

stemming and hence is added to the new list. 

Otherwise the cluster is completely discarded 

to avoid any further ambiguities. 

Various statistics of the English Senti-

WordNet and Subjectivity Word List are re-

ported in Table 1.

4.1 Bilingual Dictionary Based Approach 

A word-level translation process followed by 

error reduction technique has been adopted for 

generating the Indian languages 

SentiWordNet(s) from the English sentiment 

lexicon merged from the English 

SentiWordNet and the Subjectivity Word List.  

English to Indian languages synsets are be-

ing developed under Project English to Indian 

Languages Machine Translation Systems 

58



(EILMT)
4
, a consortia project funded by De-

partment of Information Technology (DIT), 

Government of India. These synsets are robust 

and reliable as these are created by native 

speakers as well as linguistics experts of the 

specific languages. For each language we have 

approximately 9966 synsets along with the 

English WordNet offset. These bilingual syn-

set dictionaries have been used along with lan-

guage specific dictionaries. 

A word level synset/lexical transfer tech-

nique is applied to each English synset/word in 

the merged sentiment lexicon. Each dictionary 

search produces a set of Indian languages syn-

sets/words for a particular English synset/word.  

4.1.1 Hindi 

Two available manually compiled English-

Hindi electronic dictionaries have been identi-

fied for the present task. First is the SHABD-

KOSH
5
 and the second one is Shabdanjali

6
.  

These two dictionaries have been merged au-

tomatically by replacing the duplicates. The 

merged English-Hindi dictionary contains ap-

proximately 90,872 unique entries. The posi-

tive and negative sentiment scores for the Hin-

di words are copied from their English Senti-

WordNet.  

The bilingual dictionary based translation 

process has resulted 22,708 Hindi entries.  

4.1.2 Bengali 

An English-Bengali dictionary (approx-

imately 102119 entries) has been developed 

using the Samsad Bengali-English dictionary
7
. 

The positive and negative sentiment scores for 

the Bengali words are copied from their Eng-

lish SentiWordNet equivalents.  

The bilingual dictionary based translation 

process has resulted in 35,805 Bengali entries. 

A manual checking is done to identify the re-

liability of the words generated from automatic 

process. After manual checking only 1688

 devel-

oped by Language Technology Research Cen-

ter (LTRC), International Institute of Hydera-

bad (IITH) have been chosen for the present 

task. There is no WordNet publicly available 

for Telugu and the corpus (Section 4.5) we 

used is small in size. Dictionary based ap-

proach is the main process for Telugu Senti-

WordNet generation.  

These three dictionaries have been merged 

automatically by replacing the duplicates. The 

merged English-Telugu dictionary contains 

approximately 112310 unique entries. The pos-

itive and negative sentiment scores for the Te-

lugu words are copied from their English Sen-

tiWordNet equivalents. 

The dictionary based translation process has 

resulted in 30,889 Telugu entries, about 88% 

of final Telugu SentiWordNet synsets. An on-

line intuitive game has been proposed in Sec-

tion 4.6 to automatically validate the devel-

oped Telugu SentiWordNet by involving In-

ternet population.  

4.3 WordNet Based Approach 

WordNet(s) are available for Hindi
11

 (Jha et 

al., 2001) and Bengali
12

 (Robkop et al., 2010) 

but publicly unavailable for Telugu. 

A WordNet based lexicon expansion strate-

gy has been adopted to increase the coverage 

of the generated SentiWordNet(s) through the 

dictionary based approach. The present algo-

rithm starts with English SentiWordNet syn-

sets that is expanded using synonymy and an-

tonymy relations in the WordNet. For match-

ing synsets we keep the exact score as in the 

source synset in the English SentiWordNet.

4.3.1 Hindi 

Hindi WordNet is a well structured and ma-

nually compiled resource and is being updated 

since last nine years. There is an available 

API
13

 for accessing the Hindi WordNet. Al-

most 60% of final SentiWordNet synsets in 

Hindi are generated by this method. 

4.3.2 Bengali 

The Bengali WordNet is being developed by 

the Asian WordNet (AWN) community. It on-

ly contains 1775 noun synsets as reported in 

(Robkop et al., 2010). A Web Service
14

 has 

been provided for accessing the Bengali 

WordNet. There are only a few number of 

noun synsets in the Bengali WordNet and other 

important POS category words for sentiment 

lexicon such as adjective, adverb and verb are 

absent. Only 5% new lexicon entries have been 

generated in this process.  

4.4 Antonym Generation 

Automatically or manually created lexicons 

have limited coverage and do not include most 

semantically contrasting word pairs. To over-

come the limitation and increase the coverage 

of the SentiWordNet(s) we present automatic 

antonymy generation technique followed by 

corpus validation to check orthographically 

generated antonym does really exist. Only 16 

hand crafted rules have been used as reported 

in Table 2. About 8% of Bengali, 7% of Hindi 

and 11% of Telugu SentiWordNet entries are 

generated in this process.

4.5 Corpus Based Approach 

Language/culture specific words such as those 

listed below are to be captured in the devel-

oped SentiWordNet(s). But sentiment lexicon 

generation techniques via cross-lingual projec-

tion are unable to capture these words. As ex-

ample:  

सहेरा (Sahera: A marriage-
wear) 
���������� (Durgapujo: A festiv-
al of Bengal) 

To increase the coverage of the developed 

SentiWordNet(s) and to capture the lan-

guage/culture specific words an automatic cor-

pus based approach has been proposed. At this 

stage the developed SentiWordNet(s) for the 

three Indian languages have been used as a 

seed list. Language specific corpus is automat-

ically tagged with these seed words and we 

have a simple tagset as SWP (Sentiment Word 

Positive) and SWN (Sentiment Word Nega-

tive). Although we have both positivity and 

negativity scores for the words in the seed list 

but we prefer a word level tag as either posi-

tive or negative following the highest senti-

ment score. 

A Conditional Random Field (CRF
15

) based 

Machine Learning model is then trained with 

the seed list corpus along with multiple lin-

guistics features such as morpheme, parts-of-

speech, and chunk label. These linguistics fea-

tures have been extracted by the shallow pars-

ers
16

 for Indian languages. An n-gram (n=4) 

sequence labeling model has been used for the 

present task.  

The monolingual corpuses used have been 

developed under Project English to Indian 

Languages Machine Translation Systems 

(EILMT). Each corpus has approximately 10K 

of sentences. 

4.6 Gaming Methodology 

There are several motivations behind develop-

ing an intuitive game to automatically create 

multilingual SentiWordNet(s). The assigned 

polarity scores to each synset may vary in time 

dimension. Language specific polarity scores 

may vary and it should be authenticated by 

numbers of language specific annotators. 

In the history of Information Retrieval re-

search there is a milestone when ESP
17

 game 

(Ahn et al., 2004) innovate the concept of a 

game to automatically label images available 

in World Wide Web. Highly motivated by the 

historical research we proposed a intuitive 

game to create and validate SentiWordNet(s) 

for Indian languages by involving internet 

population.

from SentiWordNet) is displayed to a player 

and he/she is then been asked to capture his 

immediate sentiment as extreme positive, posi-

tive, extreme negative, negative or neutral by 

pressing appropriate emoticon buttons. A snap 

of the game is shown in the Figure 1. The sen-

timent score is calculated by the different emo-

ticons based on the inputs from the different 

players and then is assigned the scale as fol-

lows: extreme positive (pos: 0.5, neg: 0.0), 

positive (pos: 0.25, neg: 0.0), neutral (pos: 0.0, 

neg: 0.0), negative (pos: 0.0, 0.25), extreme 

negative (pos: 0.0, neg: 0.5). 

The score of a particular player is calculated 

on the basis of pre-stored sentiment lexicon 

scores in the generated SentiWordNet(s).  

5 Evaluation 

Andera Esuli and Fabrizio Sebastiani (2006) 

have calculated the reliability of the sentiment 

scores attached to every synsets in the English 

SentiWordNet. They have tagged sentiment 

words in the English WordNet with positive 

and negative sentiment scores. In the present 

task, these sentiment scores from English 

WordNet have been directly copied to the In-

dian language SentiWordNet(s).  

Two extrinsic evaluation strategies have 

been adopted for the developed Bengali Sen-

tiWordNet based on the two main usages of 

the sentiment lexicon as subjectivity classifier 

and polarity identifier. The Hindi and Telugu 

SentiWordNet(s) have not completely been 

evaluated.

Table 3: Bengali Corpus Statistics 

We experimented with NEWS and BLOG 

corpora for subjectivity detection. Sentiment 

lexicons are generally domain independent but 

it provides a good baseline while working with 

sentiment analysis systems. The coverage of 

61



the developed Bengali SentiWordNet is eva-

luated by using it in a subjectivity classifier 

(Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009). The statistics 

of the NEWS and BLOG corpora is reported in 

Table 3. 

For comparison with the coverage of Eng-

lish SentiWordNet the same subjectivity clas-

sifier (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009) has 

been applied on Multi Perspective Question 

Answering (MPQA) (NEWS) and IMDB Mov-

ie review corpus along with English Senti-

WordNet. The result of the subjectivity clas-

sifier on both the corpus proves that the cover-

age of the Bengali SentiWordNet is reasonably 

good. The subjectivity word list used in the 

subjectivity classifier is developed from the 

IMDB corpus and hence the experiments on 

the IMDB corpus have yielded high precision 

and recall scores. The developed Bengali Sen-

tiWordNet is domain independent and still its 

coverage is very good as shown in Table 4.

5.2 Polarity Scores 

This evaluation metric measures the reliability 

of the associated polarity scores in the senti-

ment lexicons. To measure the reliability of 

polarity scores in the developed Bengali Sen-

tiWordNet, a polarity classifier (Das and Ban-

dyopadhyay, 2010) has been developed using 

the Bengali SentiWordNet along with some 

other linguistic features.

SentiWordNet 

 

Feature ablation method proves that the as-

sociated polarity scores in the developed Ben-

gali SentiWordNet are reliable. Table 5 shows 

the performance of a polarity classifier using 

the Bengali SentiWordNet. The polarity wise 

overall performance of the polarity classifier is 

reported in Table 6.

Table 6: Polarity-wise Performance Using 

Bengali SentiWordNet 

 

Comparative study with a polarity classifier 

that works with only prior polarity lexicon is 

necessary but no such works have been identi-

fied in literature.  

An arbitrary 100 words have been chosen 

from the Hindi SentiWordNet for human eval-

uation. Two persons are asked to manually 

check it and the result is reported in Table 7. 

The coverage of the Hindi SentiWordNet has 

not been evaluated, as no manually annotated 

sentiment corpus is available. 

 

Polarity Positive Negative

For Telugu we created a version of the game 

with Telugu words on screen. Only 3 users 

have played the Telugu language specific 

game till date. Total 92 arbitrary words have 

been tagged and the accuracy of the polarity 

scores is reported in Table 8. The coverage of 

Telugu SentiWordNet has not been evaluated, 

as no manually annotated sentiment corpus is 

available.

6 Conclusion 

SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages are be-

ing developed using various approaches. The 

game based technique may be directed towards 

a new way for the creation of linguistic data 

not just only for SentiWordNet(s) but in either 

areas of NLP too.  

Presently only the Bengali SentiWordNet
