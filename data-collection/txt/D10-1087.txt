Abstract

This paper proposes a method for automat-
ically inserting commas into Japanese texts.
In Japanese sentences, commas play an im-
portant role in explicitly separating the con-
stituents, such as words and phrases, of a sen-
tence. The method can be used as an ele-
mental technology for natural language gen-
eration such as speech recognition and ma-
chine translation, or in writing-support tools
for non-native speakers. We categorized the
usages of commas and investigated the ap-
pearance tendency of each category. In this
method, the positions where commas should
be inserted are decided based on a machine
learning approach. We conducted a comma
insertion experiment using a text corpus and
confirmed the effectiveness of our method.

1 Introduction

In Japanese sentences, commas are inserted to mark
word boundaries that might be otherwise unclear be-
cause Japanese is a non-segmented language. They
are also inserted at sharp semantic boundaries to im-
prove the readability of a sentence. While there is a
tendency about the positions where commas should
be inserted in a Japanese sentence, there is no clear
standard for these positions. Therefore, it is hard
for non-natives of Japanese such as foreign students
to insert commas properly, and the method for au-
tomatic comma insertion is required to support sen-
tence generation by such people. In addition, this
method is expected to be useful for improving read-
ability of texts generated by automatic speech recog-
nition or machine translation.

This paper proposes a method for automatically
inserting commas into Japanese texts. There are

several usages of commas, and the positions to in-
sert commas depend on these usages. Therefore,
we grouped the usages of commas into nine cate-
gories, and investigated the appearance tendency for
each category to find the effective features of ma-
chine learning by using Japanese newspaper arti-
cles. Based on the analysis of comma positions, our
method decides whether or not to insert a comma
at each bunsetsu1 boundary in an input sentence by
machine learning.

We conducted an experiment on comma insertion
using the Kyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao,
1998), and obtained higher recall and precision than
those of the baseline, leading us to confirm the ef-
fectiveness of our method.

This paper is organized as follows: The next sec-
tion presents related works. Section 3 gives prelim-
inary analyses. Section 4 explains how our comma
insertion method works. An experiment and discus-
sions are presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.

2 Related Works

There have been many investigations on comma in-
sertion into output texts of speech recognition sys-
tems to improve the readability (Christensen et al.,
2001; Kim and Woodland, 2001; Liu et al., 2006;
Shimizu et al., 2008). Their methods insert commas
using pause information of speakers, based on the
idea that a point at which a speaker takes a breath
partly corresponds to a point where a comma is in-
serted. However, since pause information cannot be
obtained from texts, we cannot use this approach be-
cause our targets are written texts.

In addition, there have been some investigations
1Bunsetsu is a linguistic unit in Japanese that roughly corre-

sponds to a basic phrase in English. A bunsetsu consists of one
independent word and zero or more ancillary words.

on comma insertion into non-Japanese written texts
(White and Rajkumar, 2008; Guo et al., 2010). In
Japanese, there are several usages of commas, and
some usages are specific to Japanese due to its lin-
guistic nature. Therefore, just adopting the above
mentioned methods, which have been developed
to process non-Japanese texts, is not sufficient to
enable high-quality comma insertion into Japanese
sentences. Development of a method based on the
detailed analysis of Japanese commas is required.

Furthermore, there have been some investiga-
tions on comma insertion into Japanese written texts
(Hayashi, 1992; Suzuki et al., 1995). These investi-
gations have adopted rule-based methods. However,
the number of their rules is not necessarily sufficient,
and no quantitative evaluation has been performed.

3 Analyses on Comma Usages

There have been several discussions on commas,
including the draft of “Kutou-hou (punctuation)”
made by Archives Division, Minister’s Secretariat,
Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and Cul-
ture in 1906. There are several usages of commas,
and depending on the usage, the types of positions
where commas are inserted are different. First, we
examined some previous publications on commas
(Honda, 1982; Inukai, 2002; Shogakukan’s editior-
ial department, 2007). Based on the results of the ex-
amination, we classified the usages of commas into
nine categories shown in Table 1. Here, commas
in Japanese sentences and commas in English sen-
tences have some common roles. In Japanese sen-
tences, some commas have the same roles as com-
mas in English sentences, but some commas have
roles specific to Japanese due to its linguistic nature
such as “Japanese is a non-segmented language” or
“Japanese has kanji characters and katakana charac-
ters.”

In our study, positions where a comma should
be inserted are detected by using machine learning.
We investigated the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4.0
(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998) to find the effective
features. The Kyoto Text Corpus is a collection of
Japanese articles of Mainichi newspaper. We used
the articles on January 1st and from January 3rd to
11th in 1995 as the analysis data. Table 2 shows
the size of the data. The data had been manually

annotated with information on morphological anal-
ysis, bunsetsu segmentation and dependency2 anal-
ysis. Clause boundaries were detected by the clause
boundary detection program CBAP (Kashioka and
Maruyama, 2004).

Out of all the inserted commas, only 1.43%
were inserted at positions which were not bunsetsu
boundaries. Therefore, we analyzed only commas
inserted at bunsetsu boundaries. Of 105,680 bun-
setsu boundaries, commas were inserted at 16,357
bunsetsu boundaries, that is, the rate of comma
insertion was 15.48%. In the following sections,
we focus on morphemes, clause boundaries, depen-
dency relation and the number of characters between
commas, and investigate their relations with com-
mas.

3.1 Commas between Clauses
If a sentence consists of several clauses, inserting
a comma between clauses makes clear the sentence

2A dependency in a Japanese sentence is a modification re-
lation in which a modifier bunsetsu depends on a modified bun-
setsu. That is, the modifier bunsetsu and the modified bunsetsu
work as a modifier and a modifyee, respectively.

structure. Therefore, a clause boundary is consid-
ered to be a strong candidate of a position where a
comma is inserted. For example, in the following
sentence3:

• !"#$%&'()*+,-#./012345
6#7839:;<=%3>?5@ABC%D

(Toward lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq by
United Nations, the aim seems to be to request fur-
ther cooperation from France, which has close ties
to Iraq.)

a comma is inserted at the clause boundary right af-
ter the continuous clause “!"#$%&'()*
+,-#./ (Toward lifting the sanctions imposed
on Iraq by United Nations).” Like this example, the
same usage of commas is seen in English as well.

In the analysis data, there existed 29,278 clause
boundaries excluding sentence breaks. Among
them, commas were inserted at 8,805 positions
(30.01%). The rate is higher than that of bunsetsu
boundaries. This indicates that commas tend to be
inserted at clause boundaries.

We investigated the rate of comma insertion about
114 types4 of clause boundaries. Table 3 shows the
top 10 clause boundary types according to the oc-
currence frequency, and the rates of comma inser-

3We underlined commas which we mentioned in the exam-
ple and the corresponding positions in the translation of the ex-
ample.

4In our research, we used the types of clause boundaries de-
fined by the Clause Boundary Annotation Program (Kashioka
and Maruyama, 2004).

tion. In cases of “continuous clause” and “com-
pound clause-de,” the rates were higher than 84%.
On the other hand, in cases of “adnominal clause”
and “quotational clause,” the rates were lower than
5%. This means that the likelihoods of comma inser-
tion are different according to the clause boundary
type.

3.2 Commas and Dependency Structure

Commas have a role to make dependency relations
clearer. Commas tend to be inserted right after a
bunsetsu that depends on a distant bunsetsu. In Fig-
ure 1, although the bunsetsu “EFEG (in Asia)”
depends on the bunsetsu “HIJK5% (causes),”
if the comma right after the bunsetsu “EFEG (in
Asia)” is not inserted, the readers might mistakenly
understand that the bunsetsu “EFEG (in Asia)”
depends on the next bunsetsu “LMNO% (strong).”
To avoid the mistake, the comma is inserted.

In the analysis data, there existed 66,984 bunset-
sus which depend on the next bunsetsu. Among the
bunsetsu boundaries right after them, 2,302 (3.44%)
were the positions where a comma was inserted. On
the other hand, in the case of a bunsetsu bound-
ary right after a bunsetsu which does not depend on
the next bunsetsu, the rate of comma insertion was
36.32% (14,055/38,696).

In addition, when the modifyee of a bunsetsu is
located outside the clause containing the bunsetsu,
i.e. to the right of the clause end, commas are con-
sidered to be more frequently inserted right after the
bunsetsu because such bunsetsu causes more com-
plex dependency structure. The rate of comma in-
sertion right after such bunsetsu is 54.24%.

3.3 Commas for Avoiding Reading Mistakes
and Reading Difficulty

Although, unlike English, Japanese is a non-
segmented language, word boundaries are easy to
detect because Japanese has three types of charac-
ters; hiragana characters, katakana characters, and
kanji characters. However, if the same types of char-
acters appear sequentially, readers may make a read-
ing mistake or feel difficulty in reading them. To
avoid such mistakes and difficulty, there is a usage
of commas specific to Japanese.

In the following example, a comma is inserted
between two sequentially appearing words “PQ
(burned)” and “R (ashes)” both of which consist of
only kanji characters.

• STUV3WX;YZ[\]^_`abc3d
ef#gVGPQ0R;ha3Hi#jKkl@

;m=%no@5pD(He seemed to acknowledge
that he had carried the corpse of Mr. Kawasaki to an
acquaintance in Hanasaki, Katashina-mura, Tone-
gun, Gunma Prefecture, burned it and abandoned
its ashes in the mountain forest in Katashina-mura.)

The comma was inserted because if there was no
comma, the word boundary would become unclear
and reading difficulty would be caused. Among
2,409 bunsetsu boundaries over which kanji charac-
ters appeared sequentially, commas were inserted at
2,188 (90.83%) bunsetsu boundaries. In the case of
katakana characters, the rate was 97.69% (211/216).
Commas tend to be inserted at most bunsetsu bound-
aries if kanji characters or katakana characters se-
quentially appear over a boundary.

3.4 Commas Indicating the Subject
Commas are considered to be inserted right after a
bunsetsu that represents the subject of a sentence.
For example, in Figure 2, a comma is inserted right
after the bunsetsu “qrs (war)” to indicate that the
bunsetsu is the subject of the sentence. Here, we pay
attention to the clause boundary of the type “topi-
calized element-wa.” The rate that commas were in-
serted at the clause boundaries “topicalized element-
wa” was 16.94% (1,446/8,536). This rate is almost
the same as that of bunsetsu boundaries. On the
other hand, the commas inserted at the clause bound-
aries “topicalized element-wa” accounted for 8.84%
(1,446/16,357) of all the inserted commas.

Figure 2: Comma insertion at the clause boundary “topi-
calized element-wa”

In the case of the clause boundary “topicalized
element-wa” right after a bunsetsu which does not
depend on the next bunsetsu (e.g., the bunsetsu “q
rs (war)” in Figure 2), the rate of comma inser-
tion was 20.71% (1,426/6,886). The rate is higher
than that of all the clause boundaries “topicalized
element-wa.” This shows that commas tend to be
especially inserted at the “topicalized element-wa”
right after bunsetsus which do not depend on the
next bunsetsu.

3.5 Commas after Conjunction or Adverb

Commas tend to be inserted right after a conjunc-
tion or an adverb located at the beginning of a sen-
tence. These commas correspond to English com-
mas which are inserted right after a word such as
“however” and “furthermore” located at the begin-
ning of a sentence.

• JtJ0usvC#hwO%xyz#{C{5D
(However, I do not feel like agreeing on it.)

In the analysis data, there existed 695 bunset-
sus whose rightmost morpheme is a conjunction
and which are located at the beginning of a sen-
tence. Among them, commas were inserted right
after 498 (71.65%) bunsetsus. In the case of bun-
setsus whose rightmost morpheme is an adverb, the
rate was 30.97% (140/452).

3.6 Commas Inserted between Parallel Words
or Phrases

Commas have a function which makes clear sepa-
ration between parallel words or phrases. The fol-
lowing example shows commas separating parallel
nouns.

895



• |J}~30e0{#!
"3kU{/C{B{5s5D(The
United Nations should play a lot of roles in a broad
range of fields, such as the global environment,
population, and food.)

In this example, commas are inserted to separate
parallel nouns “ (environment),” “e (popula-
tion)” and “ (food)”. In English, there are com-
mas which perform the same role. In fact, commas
were inserted between “environment” and “popula-
tion” and between “population” and “food” in the
translation of the above example. When bunsetsus
whose rightmost morpheme is a noun appear se-
quentially, the rate of comma insertion between such
bunsetsus is 59.39% (3,330/5,607).

Also, commas are inserted to separate parallel
phrases. In the following example,

• s0>;kt;Kh
;/k0 @¡3¢(£¤;¥¦

kJK§=%D(The menu is decided by avoid-
ing the menu the Prime Minister ate on the previous
night, and by considering the balance between the
Japanese food and the European food.)

a comma is inserted right after the bunsetsu “/k
 (avoiding)” to make clear separation between the
parallel phrases “h;/k (by avoid-
ing the menu)” and “ @¡3¢(£¤;¥¦
kJK (by considering the balance between the
Japanese food and the European food).” The rate
of comma insertion between two parallel phrases is
79.89% (751/940). This is much higher than that of
bunsetsu boundaries, indicating that commas tend to
be inserted when phrases are paralleled.

3.7 Number of Characters between Commas

If there are too many commas at a short distance,
the sentence becomes hard to read. Therefore, the
number of characters between commas is expected
to be not too small. Also, because a long sequence
of characters without a comma is generated if the
distance between commas is very long, the occur-
rence frequency of such sequences of characters is
considered to be low.

We investigated the number of characters between
commas and its occurrence frequency. Figure 3

shows the results of investigation. When the num-
ber of characters between commas is either large or
small, the occurrence frequency is low.

4 Comma Insertion Method

In our method, a sentence, on which morphologi-
cal analysis, bunsetsu segmentation, clause bound-
ary analysis and dependency analysis have been per-
formed, is considered the input. Our method de-
cides whether or not to insert a comma at each bun-
setsu boundary in an input sentence. Based on the
analysis results in Section 3, our method adopts the
bunsetsu boundaries as candidate positions where a
comma is inserted. Our method identifies the most
appropriate combination among all combinations of
positions where a comma can be inserted, by using
the probabilistic model. In this paper, input sen-
tences which consist of n bunsetsus are represented
by B = b1 · · · bn, and the results of comma inser-
tion by R = r1 · · · rn. Here, ri is 1 if a comma
is inserted right after bunsetsu bi, and 0 otherwise.
We indicate the j-th sequence of bunsetsus created
by dividing an input sentence into m sequences as
Lj = b

j
1 · · · bjnj (1 ≤ j ≤ m), and then, r

j
k = 0 if

1 ≤ k < nj , and rjk = 1 if k = nj .

4.1 Probabilistic Model for Comma Insertion

When an input sentence B is provided, our method
identifies the comma insertion R that maximizes
the conditional probability P (R|B). Assuming that
whether or not to insert a comma right after a bun-
setsu is independent of other commas except the

lated by dynamic programming.

we used the features in Table 4 based on the analysis
described in Section 3.

5 Experiment

To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we con-
ducted an experiment using a Japanese text corpus.

5.1 Outline of Experiment
As the experimental data, we used the newspaper ar-
ticles in the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4.0 (Kuro-
hashi and Nagao, 1998). We used the articles from
January 14th to 17th as the test data. The training
data is same as the analysis data. Table 5 shows the
size of the test data. Here, we used the maximum
entropy method tool (Le, 2008) with the default op-
tions except “-i 2000.”

In the evaluation, we obtained the recall, the pre-
cision and their harmonic mean, i.e., F-measure.
The recall and precision are respectively defined as
follows.

recall=
# of correctly inserted commas

# of commas in the correct data

precision=
# of correctly inserted commas

# of inserted commas

In our research, to realize automatic comma in-
sertion with high quality, we analyzed each usage of
commas and decided the features for the ME method
based on the analysis. To confirm the effectiveness
of our features, we established the baseline method
as a comparative method whereby commas are in-
serted by the ME method in which only simple mor-
phological information is used. The baseline method
uses the morphological information in Table 4 and
the information of the rightmost morpheme (a sur-
face form) of a bunsetsu as features.

5.2 Experimental Results
Table 6 shows the experimental results of the base-
line and our method. The recall and precision
were 69.13% and 84.13% respectively, and we con-
firmed that our method had higher performance than

Figure 4 shows the comparison between the re-
sults of our method and the baseline method. The
baseline method was not able to insert commas right
after the bunsetsu “MtVG5%> (are floated)” or
“§¨B{5k= (not decided)” but inserted com-
mas at unnatural positions such as between “©ª%
(calling himself)” and “«¬­®> (the vice com-
mander).” On the other hand, our method was able
to insert commas properly at such bunsetsu bound-
aries.

6 Discussion

6.1 Error Analysis

Among positions where commas existed in the test
data, there existed 2,022 positions where our method
did not insert commas. Among them, 862 were
clause boundaries, and the clause boundary “topical-
ized element-wa” accounted for 53.36% (460/862)
of them. There were a lot of clause boundaries of
the type “topicalized element-wa,” and the number
of commas inserted at such boundaries was large.
But, the rate of comma insertion itself was not very
high. We can say that the four features about “topi-
calized element-wa” did not always work well. Ta-

Figure 4: Comparison of the results of our method and
baseline method

ble 7 shows the results of comma insertion at the
clause boundaries “topicalized element-wa.” While
there existed 601 commas at such boundaries in the
test data, only 141 commas were inserted correctly.
We need to consider more effective features about
“topicalized element-wa.”

As for other cases, there existed 130 bunsetsu
boundaries between parallel words where commas
were not inserted. One example of such case is
shown below.

(Put pork backfat garlic, ginger and shredded green
onion in a bowl, and add red bell peppers for color.)

In the correct data, a comma was inserted between
the bunsetsu “³´ (backfat)” and “£) (gar-
lic).”

If a comma should be inserted right after the bun-
setsu ‘‘³´ (backfat),” the number of characters be-
tween commas would become too small to be judged
as appropriate by the proposed method. So, the fea-
ture about the number of characters between com-
mas may have had harmful effects there. On the
other hand, a comma was inserted properly between
the bunsetsu “£) (garlic)” and “µ¶°·
(ginger).” This is because katakana characters ap-
peared sequentially in addition to appearing as par-
allel nouns.

6.2 Unnatural Comma Insertion

When commas are inserted at obviously unnatural
positions, they have a major impact on the under-
standing of a sentence by readers. Here, we inves-
tigated how many commas had been inserted at ob-
viously unnatural positions by our method. For the
article on January 14th (217 sentences, 2,349 bun-
setsus) in the test data, we examined 47 commas in-
serted incorrectly. Three persons decided whether
or not the inserted commas were obviously unnat-
ural through consultations. Concretely, when all of
the three persons felt that an inserted comma would
make readers understand wrongly the meaning of
the sentence, the comma was judged to be obviously
unnatural.

Among 47 commas, 4 commas were judged obvi-
ously unnatural. This result shows that our method
is capable of inserting commas at natural positions
on some level.

6.3 Comparison with Human Judgement

In our experiment, we evaluated the results of
comma insertion of our method by comparing them
with the correct data. However, the sufficient level
to be reached by automatic comma insertion is un-
certain. Here, we evaluated our method by com-
paring them with the results of comma insertion by
another person. By using the same data as used in
the subsection 6.2, we conducted an experiment on
comma insertion by an annotator who was familiar
with writing Japanese documents. Table 8 shows the
recall, the precision and the F-measure. The second
row shows the results of our method for the same
data. As the F-measure of the annotator was 79.42,
it turned out that comma insertion task was diffi-
cult even for humans. For F-measure, our method
achieved 96.30% (76.48/79.42) of the annotator’s re-
sult. Also, the precision of our method was 82.78%.
Although the comma insertion task is difficult, our
method was able to properly insert commas.

7 Conclusion

This paper proposed a method for inserting commas
into Japanese texts. Our method appropriately in-
serts commas based on the machine learning method
using such features as morphemes, dependencies
and clause boundaries. An experiment by using the
Kyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998)
showed an F-measure of 75.90, and we confirmed
the effectiveness of our method.

The analysis of the experimental results showed
that our method cannot insert commas of the par-
ticular usage. As a future work, it is necessary to
find more useful features for commas of this usage
and improve the recall of our method. Also, we will
examine “commas emphasizing the adjacent word”
which were not included in our targets.
