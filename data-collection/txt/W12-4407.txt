Abstract 

This paper describes our syllable-based phrase 

transliteration system for the NEWS 2012 

shared task on English-Chinese track and its 

back. Grapheme-based Transliteration maps the 

character(s) in the source side to the target 

character(s) directly. However, character-based 

segmentation on English side will cause 

ambiguity in alignment step. In this paper we 

utilize Phrase-based model to solve machine 

transliteration with the mapping between 

Chinese characters and English syllables rather 

than English characters. Two heuristic rule-
based syllable segmentation algorithms are 

applied. This transliteration model also 

incorporates three phonetic features to enhance 

discriminative ability for phrase. The primary 

system achieved 0.330 on Chinese-English and 

0.177 on English-Chinese in terms of top-1 

accuracy. 

1 Introduction  

Machine transliteration, based on the pronunciation, 

transforms the script of a word from a source 

language to a target language automatically.  

  With a continuous growth of out-of-vocabulary 

names to be transliterated, the traditional 

dictionary-based methods are no longer suitable. 

So data-driven method is gradually prevailing now, 

and many new approaches are explored. 

  Knight(1998) proposes a phoneme-based 

approach to solve the transliteration between 

English names and Japanese katakana. It makes 

use of a common phonetic representation as a pivot.  

  The phoneme-based approach needs a 

pronunciation dictionary for one or two languages. 

These dictionaries usually do not exist or can't 

cover all the names. So grapheme-based(Li et al., 

2004) approach has gained lots of attention 

recently. Huang(2011) proposes a novel 

nonparametric Bayesian using synchronous 

adaptor grammars to model the grapheme-based 

transliteration. Zhang(2010) builds the pivot 

transliteration model with grapheme-based method. 

  The hybrid approach tries to utilize both phoneme 

and grapheme information, and usually integrates 

the output of multiple engines to improve 

transliteration. Oh and Choi(2006) integrate both 

phoneme and grapheme features into a single 

leaning framework.  

  As an instance of grapheme-based approach, 

Jia(2009) views machine transliteration as a special 

example of machine translation and uses the 

phrase-based machine translation model to solve it. 

The approach is simple and effective. Our paper 

follows this way. However, using the English 

letters and Chinese characters as basic mapping 

units will make ambiguity in the alignment and 

translation step. One Chinese character usually 

maps one syllable, so syllabifying English words 

can be more discriminative. 

  We present a solution to this ambiguity by 

replacing the English character with an English 

syllable which is consecutive characters and can 

keep some phonetic properties. For this purpose, 

two heuristic and simple syllable segmentation 

algorithms are used to syllabify English side into 

syllables sequence. Besides two above, three extra 

phrase features for transliteration are used to 

enhance the model. 

  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 

Section 2 introduces the phrase-based model 

briefly. Section 3 describes two rule-based syllable 

52



segmentation methods and three new special 

features for transliteration in detail. Experiments 

and analyses are discussed in section 4. 

Conclusions and future work are addressed in 

section 5. 

2 Phrase-based Machine Transliteration 
Model 

Machine transliteration can be regarded as a 

special instance of machine translation. Jia(2009) 

solves transliteration with phrase-based model 

firstly. There an English character is treated as a 

word in machine translation. On the contrast, 

character is replaced by syllable in this paper. Then 

transliteration can be viewed as a pure translation 

task. The phrase-based machine transliteration can 

be formulated by equation 1.

 n is the number of features 

 i  is the weight of feature i  

  In our phrase-based transliteration system, the 

following features are used by default: 

 the bidirectional probability between 
source phrase and the target phrase 

 The bidirectional lexical probability 
between source phrase and target phrase  

 the fluency of the output, namely language 
model 

 the length penalty 

3 Syllable Segmentation and Extra 
Phrase Features 

This section describes two rule-based syllable 

segmentation algorithms and three extra phrase 

features added to machine transliteration model. 

3.1 Syllable Segmentation Algorithm  

In (Jia et al., 2009), the basic alignment units are 

English character and Chinese character(called 

c2c). This setup is the simplest format to 

implement the model. However, transliteration 

from English to Chinese usually maps an English 

syllable to a single Chinese character. As one 

Chinese character usually corresponds to many 

English characters, the c2c method has only a 

modest discriminative ability. Obviously 

syllabifying English is more suitable for this 

situation. Yang(2010) utilizes a CRF-based 

segmentor to syllabify English and Kwong(2011) 

syllabifies English with the Onset First Principle. 

Alternatively, inspired by (Jiang, 2007), two 

heuristic rule-based methods are addressed to 

syllabify the English names in this paper.  

  Given an English name E, it can be syllabified 

into a syllable sequence SE = {e1,e2,...,en} with  

one of the following two linguistic methods. 
 

Simple Segmentation Algorithm(SSA): 

1.  {'a', 'o' , 'e', 'i', 'u'} are defined as vowels. 'y' is 

defined as a vowel when it is not followed by a 

vowel; 'r' is defined as a vowel when it follows a 

vowel and is followed by a consonant
1
. All other 

characters are defined as consonants; this forms the 

basic vowel set; 

2.  A consecutive vowels sequence, formed by the 

basic vowel set, is treated as a new vowel symbol; 

Step 1 and 2 form the new vowel set; 

3.  A consonant and its following vowel are treated 

as a syllable; 

4.  Consecutive consonants are separated; a vowel 

symbol(in the new vowel set) followed by a 

consonant is separated; 

5. The rest isolated characters sequences are 

regarded as individual syllables in each word. 

 

  SSA treats all the consecutive vowels as a single 

new vowel simply. In fact, many consecutive 

vowels like "io" often align two or more Chinese 

characters, such as " zio 西  奥". It is better to 
separate it as two syllables rather than one syllable 

in alignment step. So we present another segment 

algorithm which takes more details into 

consideration.  

 

Fine-grained Segment Algorithm(FSA): 

1.  Replace 'x' in English names with 'k s' firstly; 

2. {'a','o','e','i','u'} are defined as vowels. 'y' is 

defined as a vowel when it is not followed by a 

vowel; 

3.  When 'w' follows 'a','e','o' and isn't followed by 

'h', treat 'w' and the preceding vowel as a new 

vowel symbol; Step 2 and 3 form the basic vowel 

set; 

4. A consecutive vowels sequence which is formed 

by the basic vowel set is treated as a new vowel

We leave it for the future work.

symbol, excepting 'iu', 'eo', 'io', 'oi', 'ia', 'ui', 'ua', 

'uo' ; Step 2, 3 and 4 form the new vowel set; 

5. Consecutive consonants are separated; a vowel 

symbol(in the new vowel set) followed by a 

consonant sequence is separated; 

6. A consonant and its following vowel are treated 

as a syllable; the rest of the isolated consonants 

and vowels are regarded as individual syllables in 

each word. 

   

  After segmenting the English characters sequence, 

the new transliteration units, syllables, will be 

more discriminative. 

3.2 Extra phrase features 

The default features of phrase can't express the 

special characteristic of transliteration. We propose 

three features trying to explore the transliteration 

property. 

  Begin and End Feature(BE) 

  When a Chinese character is chosen as the 

corresponding transliteration, its position in the 

transliteration result is important. Such as a 

syllable "zu" that can be transliterate into "朱" or "

祖" in Chinese while "朱" will be preferred if it 
appears at the beginning position.  

  To explore this kind of information, the pseudo 

characters "B" and "E" are added to the train and 

test data. So in the extracted phrase table, "B" 

always precedes the Chinese character that prefers 

at the first position, and "E" always follows the 

Chinese character that appears at the last position. 

  Phrase Length Feature  
  Chinese character can be pronounced according 

to its pinyin format which is written like English 

word. And the longer English syllable is, the 

longer pinyin format it often has. So the length 

information of Chinese character and its pinyin can 

be used to disambiguate the phrase itself. Here we 

definite two new features to address it. Suppose 

<e,c> as a phrase pair, e= {e1,e2,...,em},c = 

{c1,c2,...,cn},ei stands for an English syllable and 

ci stands for a Chinese character. p(ci) is the pinyin 

format of ci. #(ei) is equal to the number of 

characters in a syllable. #p(cj) is equal to the 

number of characters in a pinyin sequence. And 

then, 

L1 = Sum(#(ei)) / Sum(#(p(cj)) 

L2 = m / n 

4 Experiments 

This section describes the data sets, experimental 

setup, experimental results and analyses. 

4.1 Data Sets 

The training set of English-Chinese transliteration 

track contains 37753 pairs of names. We pick up 

3000 pairs from the training data randomly as the 

closed test set and the rest 34753 pairs as our 

training data set. In the official dev set some 

semantic translation pairs are found, such as 

"REPUBLIC OF CUBA 古巴共和国", and some 

many-to-one cases like "SHELL BEACH 谢尔比

奇" also appear. We modify or delete these cases 
from the original dev set. At last, 3223 pairs are 

treated as the final dev set to tune the weights of 

system features.

  For the Chinese-English back transliteration track, 

the final training and test sets are formed in the 

same way; the original dev set is used directly. 

  Here we use Character-based which treats single 

character as a "syllable", Simple and Fine-grained 

segmentation algorithms to deal with English 

names. Table 1 and table 2 show some syllabic 

statistics information. Table 1 shows the average 

syllables of the three segmentation approaches in 

training data. Table 2 shows the total number of 

unique units. 

4.2 Experimental Setup 

The Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) is used to 

implement the model in this paper. The 

Srilm(Stolcke et al., 2002) toolkit is used to count 

54



n-gram on the target of the training set. Here we 

use a 3-gram language model. In the transliteration 

model training step, the Giza++(Och et al., 2003) 

generates the alignment with the grow-diag-and-

final heuristic, while other setup is default. In order 

to guarantee monotone decoding, the distortion 

distance is limited to 0. The MERT is used to tune 

model's weights. The method of (Jia et al., 2009) is 

the baseline setup.   

4.3 Evaluation Metrics 

The following 4 metrics are used to measure the 

quality of the transliteration results (Li et al., 

2009a): Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC), 

Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-score), Mean 

Reciprocal Rank (MRR), MAPref. 

4.4 Results 

Table 3 shows the performance of our system 

corresponding to baseline, SSA and FSA on the 

closed test set of EnCh track. BE, L1,L2 and 

BE+L1+L2 are implemented on the basis of FSA.

  Table 3 shows that the forward transliteration 

performance gets consistent improvement from 

baseline to FSA. None of new three features can 

improve by self, while combining three features 

can gain a little.

submissions(EnCh_Pri and ChEn_Pri). And the 

result of FSA is the contrastive 

submission(EnCh_2). The table 4 shows the final 

official results of EnCh and ChEn. 

5 Conclusions and future work  

This paper uses the phrase-based machine 

translation to model the transliteration task and the 

state-of-the-art translation system Moses is used to 

implement it. We participate in the NEWS 2012 

Machine Transliteration Shared Task English-

Chinese and Chinese-English tracks. 

  To improve the capability of the basic phrase-

based machine transliteration, two heuristic and 

rule-based English syllable segmentation methods 

are addressed. System can also be more robust 

with combination of three new special features for 

transliteration. The experimental results show that 

the Fine-grained Segmentation can improve the 

performance remarkably in English-Chinese 

transliteration track. 

  In the future, extensive error analyses will be 

made and methods will be proposed according to 

the specific error type. More syllable segmentation 

methods such as statistical-based will be tried.
