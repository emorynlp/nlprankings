Abstract

Bag-of-words approaches to information
retrieval (IR) are effective but assume in-
dependence between words. The Hy-
perspace Analogue to Language (HAL)
is a cognitively motivated and validated
semantic space model that captures sta-
tistical dependencies between words by
considering their co-occurrences in a sur-
rounding window of text. HAL has been
successfully applied to query expansion in
IR, but has several limitations, including
high processing cost and use of distribu-
tional statistics that do not exploit syn-
tax. In this paper, we pursue two methods
for incorporating syntactic-semantic infor-
mation from textual ‘events’ into HAL.
We build the HAL space directly from
events to investigate whether processing
costs can be reduced through more careful
definition of word co-occurrence, and im-
prove the quality of the pseudo-relevance
feedback by applying event information
as a constraint during HAL construction.
Both methods significantly improve per-
formance results in comparison with orig-
inal HAL, and interpolation of HAL and
relevance model expansion outperforms
either method alone.

1 Introduction

Despite its intuitive appeal, the incorporation of
linguistic and semantic word dependencies in IR
has not been shown to significantly improve over
a bigram language modeling approach (Song and
Croft, 1999) that encodes word dependencies as-
sumed from mere syntactic adjacency. Both the

dependence language model for IR (Gao et al.,
2004), which incorporates linguistic relations be-
tween non-adjacent words while limiting the gen-
eration of meaningless phrases, and the Markov
Random Field (MRF) model, which captures short
and long range term dependencies (Metzler and
Croft, 2005; Metzler and Croft, 2007), con-
sistently outperform a unigram language mod-
elling approach but are closely approximated by
a bigram language model that uses no linguis-
tic knowledge. Improving retrieval performance
through application of semantic and syntactic in-
formation beyond proximity and co-occurrence
features is a difficult task but remains a tantalising
prospect.

Our approach is like that of Gao et al. (2004)
in that it considers semantic-syntactically deter-
mined relationships between words at the sentence
level, but allows words to have more than one
role, such as predicate and argument for differ-
ent events, while link grammar (Sleator and Tem-
perley, 1991) dictates that a word can only sat-
isfy one connector in a disjunctive set. Compared
to the MRF model, our approach is unsupervised
where MRFs require the training of parameters us-
ing relevance judgments that are often unavailable
in practical conditions.

Other work incorporating syntactic and linguis-
tic information into IR includes early research by
(Smeaton, O’Donnell and Kelledy, 1995), who
employed tree structured analytics (TSAs) resem-
bling dependency trees, the use of syntax to de-
tect paraphrases for question answering (QA) (Lin
and Pantel, 2001), and semantic role labelling in
QA (Shen and Lapata, 2007).

Independent from IR, Pado and Lapata (2007)
proposed a general framework for the construc-
tion of a semantic space endowed with syntactic

120



information. This was represented by an undi-
rected graph, where nodes stood for words, de-
pendency edges stood for syntactical relations, and
sequences of dependency edges formed paths that
were weighted for each target word. Our work is
in line with Pado and Lapata (2007) in construct-
ing a semantic space with syntactic information,
but builds our space from events, states and attri-
butions as defined linguistically by Bach (1986).
We call these simply events, and extract them auto-
matically from predicate-argument structures and
a dependency parse. We will use this space to per-
form query expansion in IR, a task that aims to find
additional words related to original query terms,
such that an expanded query including these words
better expresses the information need. To our
knowledge, the notion of events has not been ap-
plied to query expansion before.

This paper will outline the original HAL al-
gorithm which serves as our baseline, and the
event extraction process. We then propose two
methods to arm HAL with event information: di-
rect construction of HAL from events (eHAL-1),
and treating events as constraints on HAL con-
struction from the corpus (eHAL-2). Evaluation
will compare results using original HAL, eHAL-
1 and eHAL-2 with a widely used unigram lan-
guage model (LM) for IR and a state of the art
query expansion method, namely the Relevance
Model (RM) (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). We also
explore whether a complementary effect can be
achieved by combining HAL-based dependency
modelling with the unigram-based RM.

2 HAL Construction

Semantic space models aim to capture the mean-
ings of words using co-occurrence information
in a text corpus. Two examples are the Hyper-
space Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and
Burgess, 1996), in which a word is represented
by a vector of other words co-occurring with it
in a sliding window, and Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (LSA) (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Lan-
dauer and Harshman, 1990; Landauer, Foltz and
Laham, 1998), in which a word is expressed as
a vector of documents (or any other syntacti-
cal units such as sentences) containing the word.
In these semantic spaces, vector-based represen-
tations facilitate measurement of similarities be-
tween words. Semantic space models have been
validated through various studies and demonstrate

compatibility with human information processing.
Recently, they have also been applied in IR, such
as LSA for latent semantic indexing, and HAL for
query expansion. For the purpose of this paper, we
focus on HAL, which encodes word co-occurrence
information explicitly and thus can be applied to
query expansion in a straightforward way.

HAL is premised on context surrounding a word
providing important information about its mean-
ing (Harris, 1968). To be specific, an L-size
sliding window moves across a large text corpus
word-by-word. Any two words in the same win-
dow are treated as co-occurring with each other
with a weight that is inversely proportional to their
separation distance in the text. By accumulating
co-occurrence information over a corpus, a word-
by-word matrix is constructed, a simple illustra-
tion of which is given in Table 1. A single word is
represented by a row vector and a column vector
that capture the information before and after the
word, respectively. In some applications, direc-
tion sensitivity is ignored to obtain a single vector
representation of a word by adding corresponding
row and column vectors (Bai et al., 2005).

Table 1: A HAL space for the text “w1 w2 w3 w4
w5 w6” using a 5-word sliding window (L = 5).

HAL has been successfully applied to query ex-
pansion and can be incorporated into this task di-
rectly (Bai et al., 2005) or indirectly, as with the
Information Flow method based on HAL (Bruza
and Song, 2002). However, to date it has used
only statistical information from co-occurrence
patterns. We extend HAL to incorporate syntactic-
semantic information.

3 Event Extraction

Prior to event extraction, predicates, arguments,
part of speech (POS) information and syntac-
tic dependencies are annotated using the best-
performing joint syntactic-semantic parser from
the CoNNL 2008 Shared Task (Johansson and

121



Nugues, 2008), trained on PropBank and Nom-
Bank data. The event extraction algorithm then
instantiates the template REL [modREL] Arg0
[modArg0] ...ArgN [modArgN], where REL is the
predicate relation (or root verb if no predicates
are identified), and Arg0...ArgN are its arguments.
Modifiers (mod) are identified by tracing from
predicate and argument heads along the depen-
dency tree. All predicates are associated with at
least one event unless both Arg0 and Arg1 are not
identified, or the only argument is not a noun.

The algorithm checks for modifiers based on
POS tag1, tracing up and down the dependency
tree, skipping over prepositions, coordinating con-
junctions and words indicating apportionment,
such as ‘sample (of)’. However, to constrain out-
put the search is limited to a depth of one (with
the exception of skipping). For example, given
the phrase ‘apples from the store nearby’ and an
argument head apples, the first dependent, store,
will be extracted but not nearby, which is the de-
pendent of store. This can be detrimental when
encountering compound nouns but does focus on
core information. For verbs, modal dependents are
not included in output.

Available paths up and down the dependency
tree are followed until all branches are exhausted,
given the rules outlined above. Tracing can re-
sult in multiple extracted events for one predicate
and predicates may also appear as arguments in
a different event, or be part of argument phrases.
For this reason, events are constrained to cover
only detail appearing above subsequent predicates
in the tree, which simplifies the event structure.
For example, the sentence “Baghdad already has
the facilities to continue producing massive quan-
tities of its own biological and chemical weapons”
results in the event output: (1) has Baghdad al-
ready facilities continue producing; (2) continue
quantities producing massive; (3) producing quan-
tities massive weapons biological; (4) quantities
weapons biological massive.

4 HAL With Events

4.1 eHAL-1: Construction From Events
Since events are extracted from documents, they
form a reduced text corpus from which HAL can

1To be specific, the modifiers include negation, as well as
adverbs or particles for verbal heads, adjectives and nominal
modifiers for nominal heads, and verbal or nominal depen-
dents of modifiers, provided modifiers are not also identified
as arguments elsewhere in the event.

be built in a similar manner to the original HAL.
We ignore the parameter of window length (L)
and treat every event as a single window of length
equal to the number of words in the event. Every
pair of words in an event is considered to be co-
occurrent with each other. The weight assigned to
the association between each pair is simply set to
one. With this scheme, all the events are traversed
and the event-based HAL is constructed.

The advantage of this method is that it sub-
stantially reduces the processing time during HAL
construction because only events are involved and
there is no need to calculate weights per occur-
rence. Additional processing time is incurred in
semantic role labelling (SRL) during event iden-
tification. However, the naive approach to extrac-
tion might be simulated with a combination of less
costly chunking and dependency parsing, given
that the word ordering information available with
SRL is not utilised.

eHAL-1 combines syntactical and statistical in-
formation, but has a potential drawback in that
only events are used during construction so some
information existing in the co-occurrence patterns
of the original text may be lost. This motivates the
second method.

4.2 eHAL-2: Event-Based Filtering
This method attempts to include more statistical
information in eHAL construction. The key idea
is to decide whether a text segment in a corpus
should be used for the HAL construction, based
on how much event information it covers. Given a
corpus of text and the events extracted from it, the
eHAL-2 method runs as follows:

1. Select the events of length M or more and
discard the others for efficiency;

2. Set an “inclusion criterion”, which decides if
a text segment, defined as a word sequence
within an L-size sliding window, contains an
event. For example, if 80% of the words in an
event are contained in a text segment, it could
be considered to “include” the event;

3. Move across the whole corpus word-by-word
with an L-size sliding window. For each win-
dow, complete Steps 4-7;

4. For the current L-size text segment, check
whether it includes an event according to the
“inclusion criterion” (Step 2);

122



5. If an event is included in the current text
segment, check the following segments for
a consecutive sequence of segments that also
include this event. If the current segment in-
cludes more than one event, find the longest
sequence of related text segments. An illus-
tration is given in Figure 1 in which dark
nodes stand for the words in a specific event
and an 80% inclusion criterion is used.

Segment K+1
Segment K+2
Segment K+3

6. Extract the full span of consecutive segments
just identified and go to the next available text
segment. Repeat Step 3;

7. When the scanning is done, construct HAL
using the original HAL method over all ex-
tracted sequences.

With the guidance of event information, the pro-
cedure above keeps only those segments of text
that include at least one event and discards the rest.
It makes use of more statistical co-occurrence in-
formation than eHAL-1 by applying weights that
are proportional to word separation distance. It
also alleviates the identified drawback of eHAL-1
by using the full text surrounding events. A trade-
off is that not all the events are included by the
selected text segments, and thus some syntactical
information may be lost. In addition, the paramet-
ric complexity and computational complexity are
also higher than eHAL-1.

5 Evaluation

We empirically test whether our event-based
HALs perform better than the original HAL, and
standard LM and RM, using three TREC2 col-
lections: AP89 with Topics 1-50 (title field),
AP8889 with Topics 101-150 (title field) and
WSJ9092 with Topics 201-250 (description field).
All the collections are stemmed, and stop words
are removed, prior to retrieval using the Lemur
Toolkit Version 4.113. Initial retrieval is iden-
tical for all models evaluated: KL-divergence

based LM smoothed using Dirichlet prior with µ
set to 1000 as appropriate for TREC style title
queries (Lavrenko, 2004). The top 50 returned
documents form the basis for all pseudo-relevance
feedback, with other parameters tuned separately
for the RM and HAL methods.

For each dataset, the number of feedback terms
for each method is selected optimally among 20,
40, 60, 804 and the interpolation and smoothing
coefficient is set to be optimal in [0,1] with in-
terval 0.1. For RM, we choose the first relevance
model in Lavrenko and Croft (2001) with the doc-
ument model smoothing parameter optimally set
at 0.8. The number of feedback terms is fixed at
60 (for AP89 and WSJ9092) and 80 (for AP8889),
and interpolation between the query and relevance
models is set at 0.7 (for WSJ9092) and 0.9 (for
AP89 and AP8889). The HAL-based query ex-
pansion methods add the top 80 expansion terms
to the query with interpolation coefficient 0.9 for
WSJ9092 and 1 (that is, no interpolation) for AP89
and AP8889. The other HAL-based parameters
are set as follows: shortest event length M = 5,
for eHAL-2 the “inclusion criterion” is 75% of
words in an event, and for HAL and eHAL-2, win-
dow size L = 8. Top expansion terms are selected
according to the formula:

PHAL(tj | ⊕ t) = HAL(tj | ⊕ q)∑
ti

HAL(ti| ⊕ q)

where HAL(tj |⊕q) is the weight of tj in the com-
bined HAL vector ⊕q (Bruza and Song, 2002)
of original query terms. Mean Average Precision
(MAP) is the performance indicator, and t-test (at
the level of 0.05) is performed to measure the sta-
tistical significance of results.

Table 2 lists the experimental results5. It can
be observed that all the three HAL-based query
expansion methods improve performance over the
LM and both eHALs achieve better performance
than original HAL, indicating that the incorpora-
tion of event information is beneficial. In addition,
eHAL-2 leads to better performance than eHAL-
1, suggesting that use of linguistic information as
a constraint on statistical processing, rather than
the focus of extraction, is a more effective strat-
egy. The results are still short of those achieved

4For RM, feedback terms were also tested on larger num-
bers up to 1000 but only comparable result was observed.

5In Table 2, brackets show percent improvement of
eHALs / RM over HAL / eHAL-2 respectively and * and #
indicate the corresponding statistical significance.

Table 2: Performance (MAP) comparison of query
expansion using different HALs

with RM, but the gap is significantly reduced by
incorporating event information here, suggesting
this is a promising line of work. In addition, as
shown in (Bai et al., 2005), the Information Flow
method built upon the original HAL largely out-
performed RM. We expect that eHAL would pro-
vide an even better basis for Information Flow, but
this possibility is yet to be explored.

As is known, RM is a pure unigram model while
HAL methods are dependency-based. They cap-
ture different information, hence it is natural to
consider if their strengths might complement each
other in a combined model. For this purpose, we
design the following two schemes:

1. Apply RM to the feedback documents (orig-
inal RM), the events extracted from these
documents (eRM-1), and the text segments
around each event (eRM-2), where the three
sources are the same as used to produce HAL,
eHAL-1 and eHAL-2 respectively;

2. Interpolate the expanded query model by
RM with the ones generated by each HAL,
represented by HAL+RM, eHAL-1+RM and
eHAL-2+RM. The interpolation coefficient is
again selected to achieve the optimal MAP.

The MAP comparison between the original RM
and these new models are demonstrated in Ta-
ble 36. From the first three lines (Scheme 1), we
can observe that in most cases the performance
generally deteriorates when RM is directly run
over the events and the text segments. The event
information is more effective to express the infor-
mation about the term dependencies while the un-
igram RM ignores this information and only takes

dependencies

the occurrence frequencies of individual words
into account, which is not well-captured by the
events. In contrast, the performance of Scheme 2
is more promising. The three methods outperform
the original RM in most cases, but the improve-
ment is not significant and it is also observed that
there is little difference shown between RM with
HAL and eHALs. The phenomenon implies more
effective methods may be invented to complement
the unigram models with the syntactical and sta-
tistical dependency information.

6 Conclusions

The application of original HAL to query expan-
sion attempted to incorporate statistical word as-
sociation information, but did not take into ac-
count the syntactical dependencies and had a
high processing cost. By utilising syntactic-
semantic knowledge from event modelling of
pseudo-relevance feedback documents prior to
computing the HAL space, we showed that pro-
cessing costs might be reduced through more care-
ful selection of word co-occurrences and that per-
formance may be enhanced by effectively improv-
ing the quality of pseudo-relevance feedback doc-
uments. Both methods improved over original
HAL query expansion. In addition, interpolation
of HAL and RM expansion improved results over
those achieved by either method alone.
