Abstract

Quotes are used in news articles as evi-
dence of a person’s opinion, and thus are
a useful target for opinion mining. How-
ever, labelling each quote with a polarity
score directed at a textually-anchored tar-
get can ignore the broader issue that the
speaker is commenting on. We address
this by instead labelling quotes as support-
ing or opposing a clear expression of a
point of view on a topic, called a position
statement. Using this we construct a cor-
pus covering 7 topics with 2,228 quotes.

1 Introduction

News articles are a useful target for opinion min-
ing as they discuss salient opinions by newswor-
thy people. Rather than asserting what a person’s
opinion is, journalists typically provide evidence
by using reported speech, and in particular, direct
quotes. We focus on direct quotes as expressions
of opinion, as they can be accurately extracted and
attributed to a speaker (O’Keefe et al., 2012).

Characterising the opinions in quotes remains
challenging. In sentiment analysis over product
reviews, polarity labels are commonly used be-
cause the target, the product, is clearly identified.
However, for quotes on topics of debate, the target
and meaning of polarity labels is less clear. For ex-
ample, labelling a quote about abortion as simply
positive or negative is uninformative, as a speaker
can use either positive or negative language to sup-
port or oppose either side of the debate.

Previous work (Wiebe et al., 2005; Balahur
et al., 2010) has addressed this by giving each
expression of opinion a textually-anchored target.
While this makes sense for named entities, it does
not apply as obviously for topics, such as abortion,
that may not be directly mentioned. Our solution
is to instead define position statements, which are

Abortion: Women should have the right to choose an abortion.
Carbon tax: Australia should introduce a tax on carbon or an
emissions trading scheme to combat global warming.

Immigration: Immigration into Australia should be maintained
or increased because its benefits outweigh any negatives.

Reconciliation: The Australian government should formally
apologise to the Aboriginal people for past injustices.

Republic: Australia should cease to be a monarchy with the
Queen as head of state and become a republic with an Australian
head of state.

Same-sex marriage: Same-sex couples should have the right to
attain the legal state of marriage as it is for heterosexual couples.

Work choices: Australia should introduce WorkChoices to give
employers more control over wages and conditions.

Table 1: Topics and their position statements.

clear statements of a viewpoint or position on a
particular topic. Quotes related to this topic can
then be labelled as supporting, neutral, or oppos-
ing the position statement. This disambiguates the
meaning of the polarity labels, and allows us to
determine the side of the debate that the speaker
is on. Table 1 shows the topics and position state-
ments used in this work, and some example quotes
from the republic topic are given below. Note that
the first example includes no explicit mention of
the monarchy or the republic.
Positive: “I now believe that the time has come. . . for us to
have a truly Australian constitutional head of state.”

Neutral: “The establishment of an Australian republic is es-
sentially a symbolic change, with the main arguments, for
and against, turning on national identity. . . ”

Negative: “I personally think that the monarchy is a tradition
which we want to keep.”

With this formulation we define an annotation
scheme and build a corpus covering 7 topics, with
100 documents per topic. This corpus includes
3,428 quotes, of which 1,183 were marked in-
valid, leaving 2,228 that were marked as support-
ing, neutral, or opposing the relevant topic state-
ment. All quotes in our corpus were annotated by
three annotators, with Fleiss’ κ values of between
0.43 and 0.45, which is moderate.

2 Background

Early work in sentiment analysis (Turney, 2002;
Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Blitzer et al.,
2007) focused on product and movie reviews,
where the text under analysis discusses a single
product or movie. In these cases, labels like posi-
tive and negative are appropriate as they align well
with the overall communicative goal of the text.

Later work established aspect-oriented opinion
mining (Hu and Liu, 2004), where the aim is to
find features or aspects of products that are dis-
cussed in a review. The reviewer’s position on
each aspect can then be classified as positive or
negative, which results in a more fine-grained clas-
sification that can be combined to form an opin-
ion summary. These approaches assume that each
document has a single source (the document’s au-
thor), whose communicative goal is to evaluate a
well-defined target, such as a product or a movie.
However this does not hold in news articles, where
the goal of the journalist is to present the view-
points of potentially many people.

Several studies (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson
et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Godbole et al.,
2007) have looked at sentiment in news text, with
some (Balahur and Steinberger, 2009; Balahur
et al., 2009, 2010) focusing on quotes. In all of
these studies the authors have textually-anchored
the target of the sentiment. While this makes sense
for targets that can be resolved back to named enti-
ties, it does not apply as obviously when the quote
is arguing for a particular viewpoint in a debate,
as the topic may not be mentioned explicitly and
polarity labels may not align to sides of the debate.

Work on debate summarisation and subgroup
detection (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Abu-
Jbara et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2012) has of-
ten used data from online debate forums, partic-
ularly those forums where users are asked to se-
lect whether they support or oppose a given propo-
sition before they can participate. This is simi-
lar to our aim with news text, where instead of a
textually-anchored target, we have a proposition,
against which we can evaluate quotes.

3 Position Statements

Our goal in this study is to determine which side of
a debate a given quote supports. Assigning polar-
ity labels to a textually-anchored target does not
work here for several reasons. Quotes may not
mention the debate topic, there may be many rel-

evant textually-anchored targets for a single topic,
and polarity labels do not necessarily align with
sides of a debate.

We instead define position statements, which
clearly state the position that one side of the debate
is arguing for. We can then characterise opinions
as supporting, neutral towards, or opposing this
particular position. Position statements should not
argue for a particular position, rather they should
simply state what the position is. Table 1 shows
the position statements that we use in this work.

4 Annotation

For our task we expect a set of news articles on
a given topic as input, where the direct quotes in
the articles have been extracted and attributed to
speakers. A position statement will have been de-
fined, that states a point of view on the topic, and
a small subset of quotes will have been labelled as
supporting, neutral, or opposing the given state-
ment. A system performing this task would then
label the remaining quotes as supporting, neutral,
or opposing, and return them to the user.

A major contribution of this work is that we
construct a fully labelled corpus, which can be
used to evaluate systems that perform the task de-
scribed above. To build this corpus we employed
three annotators, one of whom is an author, while
the other two were hired using the outsourcing
website Freelancer1. Our data is drawn from the
Sydney Morning Herald2 archive, which ranges
from 1986 until 2009, and it covers seven topics
that were subject to debate within Australian news
media during that time. For each topic we used

Apache Solr3 to find the top 100 documents that
matched a manually-constructed search query. All
documents were tokenised and POS-tagged and the
named entities were found using the system from
Hachey et al. (2013). Finally, the quotes were ex-
tracted and attributed to speakers using the system
from O’Keefe et al. (2012).

For the first part of the task, annotators were
asked to label each quote without considering any
context. In other words they were asked to only
use the text of the quote itself as evidence for an
opinion, not the speaker’s prior opinions or the
text of the document. They were then asked to la-
bel the quote a second time, while considering the
text surrounding the quote, although they were still
asked to ignore the prior opinions of the speaker.
For each of these choices annotators were given a
five-point scale ranging from strong or clear op-
position to strong or clear support, where support
or opposition is relative to the position statement.

Annotators were also asked to mark instances
where either the speaker or quote span was incor-
rectly identified, although they were asked to con-
tinue annotating the quote as though it were cor-
rect. They were also asked to mark quotes that
were invalid due to either the quote being off-
topic, or the item not being a quote (e.g. book ti-
tles, scare quotes, etc.).

5 Corpus results

In order to achieve the least amount of noise in
our corpus, we opted to discard quotes that any an-
notator had marked as invalid. From the original
set of 3,428 quotes, 1,183 (35%) were removed,
which leaves 2,245 (65%). From the original cor-
pus, 23% were marked off-topic, which shows that

3http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

in order to label opinions in news, a system would
first have to identify the topic-relevant parts of the
text. The annotators further indicated that 16%
were not quotes, and there were a small number of
cases (<1%) where the quote span was incorrect.
Annotators were able to select multiple reasons for
a quote being invalid.

Table 2 shows both Fleiss’ κ and the raw agree-
ment averaged between annotators for each topic.
We collapsed the two supporting labels together,
as well as the two opposing labels, such that we
end up with a classification of opposes vs. neu-
tral vs. supports. The no context and context cases
scored 0.69 and 0.66 in raw agreement, while the
κ values were 0.43 and 0.45, which is moderate.

Intuitively we expect that the confusion is
largely between neutral and the two polar labels.
To examine this we merged all the non-neutral la-
bels into one group and calculated the agreement
between the non-neutral group and the neutral la-
bel, as shown in Table 3. For the non-neutral vs.
neutral agreement we find that despite stability in
raw agreement, Fleiss’ κ drops substantially, to
0.36 (no context) and 0.32 (context).

For comparison we remove all neutral annota-
tions and focus on disagreement between the po-
lar labels. For this we cannot use Fleiss’ κ, as it
requires a fixed number of annotations per quote,
however we can average the pairwise κ values be-
tween annotators, which results in values of 0.93
(no context) and 0.92 (context). Though they are
not directly comparable, the magnitude of the dif-
ference between the numbers (0.36 and 0.32 vs.
0.93 and 0.92) indicates that deciding when an
opinion provides sufficient evidence of support or
opposition is the main challenge facing annotators.

To adjudicate the decisions annotators made, we
opted to take a majority vote for cases of two
or three-way agreement, while discarding cases
where annotators did not agree (1% of quotes).
The final distribution of labels in the corpus is
shown in Table 4. For both the no context and
context cases the largest class was neutral with
61% and 46% of the corpus respectively. The drop
in neutrality between the no context and context
cases shows that the interpretation of a quote can
change based on the context it is placed in.

6 Discussion

In refining our annotation scheme we noted several
factors that make annotation difficult.

Table 4: Label distribution for the final corpus.

Opinion relevance When discussing a topic,
journalists will often delve into the related aspects
and opinions that people hold. This introduces a
challenge as annotators need to decide whether a
particular quote is on-topic enough to be labelled.
For instance, these quotes by the same speaker
were in an article on the carbon tax:

1) “Whether it’s a stealth tax, the emissions trading scheme,
whether it’s an upfront. . . tax like a carbon tax, there will not
be any new taxes as part of the Coalition’s policy”

2) “I don’t think it’s something that we should rush into. But
certainly I’m happy to see a debate about the nuclear option.”

In the first quote the speaker is voicing opposi-
tion to a tax on carbon, which is easy to annotate
with our scheme. However in the second quote,
the speaker is discussing nuclear power in relation
to a carbon tax, which is much more difficult, as it
is unclear whether is is off-topic or neutral.

Obfuscation and self-contradiction While
journalists usually quote someone to provide
evidence of the person’s opinion, there are some
cases where they include quotes to show that
the person is inconsistent. The following quotes
by the same speaker were included in an arti-
cle to illustrate that the speaker’s position was
inconsistent:

1) “My point is that. . . the most potent argument in favour of
the republic, is that why should we have a Briton as the Queen
– who, of course, in reality is also the Queen of Australia –
but a Briton as the head of State of Australia”

2) “The Coalition supports the Constitution not because we
support the. . . notion of the monarchy, but because we support
the way our present Constitution works”

The above example also indicates a level of ob-
fuscation that is reasonably common for politi-
cians. Neither of the quotes actually expresses a
clear statement of how the speaker feels about a
potential republic. The first quote is an opinion

about the strongest argument in favour of a re-
public, without necessarily making that argument,
while the second quote states a party line, with a
caveat that might indicate personal disagreement.

Annotator bias This task is prone to be influ-
enced by an annotator’s biases, including their po-
litical or cultural background, their opinion about
the topic or speaker, or their level of knowledge
about the topic.

7 Conclusion

In this work we examined the problem of anno-
tating opinions in news articles. We proposed to
exploit quotes, as they are used by journalists to
provide evidence of an opinion, and are easy to
extract and attribute to speakers. Our key con-
tribution is that rather than requiring a textually-
anchored target for each quote, we instead label
quotes as supporting, neutral, or opposing a posi-
tion statement, which states a particular viewpoint
on a topic. This allowed us to resolve ambigu-
ities that arise when considering a polarity label
towards a topic. We next defined an annotation
scheme and built a corpus, which covers 7 top-
ics, with 100 documents per topic, and a total of
2,228 annotated quotes. Future work will include
building a system able to perform the task we have
defined, as well as extending this work to include
indirect quotes.
