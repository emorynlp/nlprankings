Abstract

This paper proposes the utilization of lexical
cohesion to facilitate evaluation of machine
translation at the document level. As a linguis-
tic means to achieve text coherence, lexical
cohesion ties sentences together into a mean-
ingfully interwoven structure through words
with the same or related meaning. A compar-
ison between machine and human translation
is conducted to illustrate one of their critical
distinctions that human translators tend to use
more cohesion devices than machine. Various
ways to apply this feature to evaluate machine-
translated documents are presented, including
one without reliance on reference translation.
Experimental results show that incorporating
this feature into sentence-level evaluation met-
rics can enhance their correlation with human
judgements.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) has benefited a lot from
the advancement of automatic evaluation in the past
decade. To a certain degree, its progress is also con-
fined to the limitations of evaluation metrics in use.
Most efforts devoted to evaluate the quality of MT
output so far have still focused on the sentence level
without sufficient attention to how a larger text is
structured. This is notably reflected in the represen-
tative MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005) and TER (Snover et al., 2006), that adopt a
sentence-by-sentence fashion to score MT outputs.
The evaluation result for a document by any of them
is usually a simple average of its sentence scores. A

drawback of this kind of sentence-based evaluation
is the neglect of document structure. There is no
guarantee for the coherence of a text if it is produced
by simply putting together stand-alone sentences, no
matter how well-translated, without adequate inter-
sentential connection. As a consequence, MT sys-
tem optimized this way to any of these metrics can
only have a very dim chance of producing translated
document that reads as natural as human writing.

The accuracy of MT output at the document level
is particularly important to MT users, for they care
about the overall meaning of a text in question more
than the grammatical correctness of each sentence
(Visser and Fuji, 1996). Post-editors particularly
need to ensure the quality of a whole document of
MT output when revising its sentences. The con-
nectivity of sentences is surely a significant factor
contributing to the understandability of a text as a
whole.

This paper studies the inter-sentential linguistic
features of cohesion and coherence and presents
plausible ways to incorporate them into the
sentence-based metrics to support MT evaluation at
the document level. In the Framework for MT Eval-
uation in the International Standards of Language
Engineering (FEMTI) (King et al., 2003), coherence
is defined as “the degree to which the reader can de-
scribe the role of each individual sentence (or group
of sentences) with respect to the text as a whole”.
The measurement of coherence has to rely on cohe-
sion, referring to the “relations of meaning that exist
within the text” (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). Cohe-
sion is realized via the interlinkage of grammatical
and lexical elements across sentences. Grammatical

cohesion refers to the syntactic links between text
items, while lexical cohesion is achieved through the
word choices in a text. This paper focuses on the
latter. A quantitative comparison of lexical cohesion
devices between MT output and human translation
is first conducted, to examine the weakness of cur-
rent MT systems in handling this feature. Different
ways of exploiting lexical cohesion devices for MT
evaluation at the document level are then illustrated.

2 Related Works

Cohesion and coherence are both necessary mono-
lingual features in a target text. They can hardly
be evaluated in isolation and have to be conjoined
with other quality criteria such as adequacy and flu-
ency. A survey of MT post-editing (Vasconcellos,
1989) suggests that cohesion and coherence serve
as higher level quality criteria beyond many others
such as syntactic well-formedness. Post-editors tend
to correct syntactic errors first before any amend-
ment for improving the cohesion and coherence of
an MT output. Also, as Wilks (1978)1 noted, it
is rather unlikely for a sufficiently large sample of
translations to be coherent and totally wrong at the
same time. Cohesion and coherence are appropri-
ate to serve as criteria for the overall quality of MT
output.

Previous researches in MT predominantly focus
on specific types of cohesion devices. For grammat-
ical cohesion, a series of works, including Nakaiwa
and Ikehara (1992), Nakaiwa et al. (1995), and
Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996), present approaches to
resolving Japanese zero pronouns and to integrat-
ing them into a Japanese-English transferred-based
MT system. Peral et al. (1999) propose an inter-
lingual mechanism for pronominal anaphora gen-
eration by exploiting a rich set of lexical, syntac-
tic, morphologic and semantic information. Mu-
rata and Nagao (1993) and Murata et al. (2001) de-
velop a rule base to identify the referential prop-
erties of Japanese noun phrases, so as to facilitate
anaphora resolution for Japanese and article gen-
eration for English during translation. A recent
COMTIS project (Cartoni et al., 2011) begins to ex-
ploit inter-sentential information for statistical MT.
A phase of its work is to have grammatical devices,

such as verbal tense/aspect/mode, discourse connec-
tives and pronouns, manually annotated in multilin-
gual corpora, in hopes of laying a foundation for the
development of automatic labelers for them that can
be integrated into an MT model.

For lexical cohesion, it has been only partially and
indirectly addressed in terms of translation consis-
tency in MT output. Different approaches to main-
taining consistency in target word choices are pro-
posed (Itagaki et al., 2007; Gong et al., 2011; Xiao
et al., 2011). Carpuat (2009) also observes a general
tendency in human translation that a given sense is
usually lexicalized in a consistent manner through-
out the whole translation.

Nevertheless there are only a few evaluation
methods explicitly targeting on the quality of a docu-
ment. Miller and Vanni (2001) devise a human eval-
uation approach to measure the comprehensibility
of a text as a whole, based on the Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), a theory
of text organization specifying coherence relations
in an authentic text. Snover et al. (2006) proposes
HTER to assess post-editing effort through human
annotation. Its automatic versions TER and TERp
(Snover et al., 2009), however, remain sentence-
based metrics. Comelles et al. (2010) present a
family of automatic MT evaluation measures, based
on the Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and
Reyle, 1993), that generate semantic trees to put to-
gether different text entities for the same referent ac-
cording to their contexts and grammatical connec-
tions. Apart from MT evaluation, automated essay
scoring programs such as E-rater (Burstein, 2003)
also employ a rich set of discourse features for as-
sessment. However, the parsing process needed for
these linguistic-heavy approaches may suffer seri-
ously from grammatical errors, which are unavoid-
able in MT output. Hence their accuracy and reli-
ability inevitably fluctuate in accord with different
evaluation data.

Lexical cohesion has far been neglected in both
MT and MT evaluation, even though it is the single
most important form of cohesion devices, account-
ing for nearly half of the cohesion devices in En-
glish (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). It is also a signif-
icant feature contributing to translation equivalence
of texts by preserving their texture (Lotfipour-Saedi,
1997). The lexical cohesion devices in a text can be

1061



represented as lexical chains conjoining related en-
tities. There are many methods of computing lexical
chains for various purposes, e.g., Morris and Hirst
(1991), Barzilay and Elhadad (1997), Chan (2004),
Li et al. (2007), among many others. Contrary to
grammatical cohesion highly depending on syntac-
tic well-formedness of a text, lexical cohesion is less
affected by grammatical errors. Its computation has
to rely on a thesaurus, which is usually available for
almost every language. In this research, a number
of formulations of lexical cohesion, with or without
reliance on external language resource, will be ex-
plored for the purpose of MT evaluation.

3 Lexical Cohesion in Machine and
Human Translation

This section presents a comparative study of MT and
human translation (HT) in terms of the use of lexi-
cal cohesion devices. It is an intuition that more co-
hesion devices are used by humans than machines
in translation, as part of the superior quality of HT.
Two different datasets are used to ensure the relia-
bility and generality of the comparison. The results
confirm the incapability of MT in handling this fea-
ture and the necessity of using lexical cohesion in
MT evaluation.

3.1 Data

The MetricsMATR 2008 development set (Przy-
bocki et al., 2009) and the Multiple-Translation Chi-
nese (MTC) part 4 (Ma, 2006) are used for this
study. They consist of MT outputs of different
source languages in company with reference trans-
lations. The data of MetricsMATR is selected from
the NIST Open MT 2006 evaluation, while MTC4 is
from the TIDES 2003 MT evaluation. Both datasets
include human assessments of MT output, from
which the part of adequacy assessment is selected
for this study. Table 1 provides overall statistics of
the datasets.

3.2 Identification of Lexical Cohesion Devices

Lexical cohesion is achieved through word choices
of two major types: reiteration and collocation. Re-
iteration can be realized in a continuum or a cline of
specificity, with repetition of the same lexical item at
one end and the use of a general noun to point to the

same referent at the other. In between the two ends
is to use a synonym (or near-synonym) and superor-
dinate. Collocation refers to those lexical items that
share the same or similar semantic relations, includ-
ing complementarity, antonym, converse, coordinate
term, meronym, troponym, and so on.

In this study, lexical cohesion devices are defined
as content words (i.e., tokens after stopword having
been removed) that reiterate once or more times in
a document, including synonym, near-synonym and
superordinate, besides those repetition and colloca-
tion. Repetition refers to the same words or stems
in a document. Stems are identified with the aid of
Porter stemmer (1980).

To classify the semantic relationships of words,
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is used as a lexical re-
source, which clusters words of the same sense (i.e.,
synonyms) into a semantic group, namely a synset.
Synsets are interlinked in WordNet according to
their semantic relationships. Superordinate and col-
location are formed by words in a proximate se-
mantic relationship, such as bicycle and vehicle (hy-
pernym), bicycle and wheel (meronym), bicycle and
car (coordinate term), and so on. They are defined
as synset pairs with a distance of 1 in WordNet.
The measure of semantic distance (Wu and Palmer,
1994) is also applied to identify near-synonyms, i.e.,
words that are synonyms in a broad sense but not
grouped in the same synset. It quantifies the seman-
tic similarity of word pairs as a real number in be-
tween 0 and 1 (the higher the more similar) as

sim(c1, c2) =
2 d(lcs(c1, c2))

d(c1) + d(c2)

where c1 and c2 are the concepts (synsets) that the
two words in question belong to, d is the distance
in terms of the shortest path from a concept to the

3.3 Results

The difference between MT and HT (reference
translation) in terms of the frequencies of lexical co-
hesion devices in MetricsMATR and MTC4 datasets
is presented in Table 2. The frequencies are aver-
aged by the number of MT/HT versions. A further
categorization breaks down content words into lex-
ical cohesion devices and those that are not. The
count of each type of lexical cohesion device is also
provided. In general the two datasets provide highly
similar statistics. There are 4.7–5.1% more content
words in HT than in MT. The numbers of ordinary
content words (i.e., not lexical cohesion devices) are
close in MT and HT. The difference of content words

in HT and MT is mostly due to that of lexical co-
hesion devices, which are mostly repetition. 8.9–
11.4% more lexical cohesion devices are found in
HT than in MT in the datasets.

A further analysis is carried out to investigate into
the use of lexical cohesion devices in each version
of MT and HT in terms of the following two ratios,
LC = lexical cohesion devices / content words,
RC = repetition / content words.

A higher LC or RC ratio means that a greater pro-
portion of content words are used as lexical cohesion
devices.

Figure 1 illustrates the RC and LC ratios in the
two datasets. The ratios of different MT systems
are presented in an ascending order in each graph
from left to right, according to their human assess-
ment results. The distributions of these values show
a strong similarity between the two datasets. First,
most of the RC and LC ratios are within an observ-
able range, i.e., 0.25–0.35 for the former and 0.40–
0.50 for the latter, except a particularly low LC for

ent HT versions are very stable in comparison with
those of MT. Especially, all four HT versions in the
MetricsMATR dataset share the sameRC ratio 0.31.
This shows a typical level of the use of lexical cohe-
sion device. Third, the ratios in MT are lower than or
at most equal to those in HT, suggesting their corre-
lation with translation quality: the closer their RC
and LC ratios to those in HT, the better the MT.
These results verify our assumption that lexical co-
hesion can serve as an effective proxy of the level of
translation quality.

4 MT Evaluation at Document Level

As a feature at the discourse level, lexical cohesion
is a good complement to current evaluation met-
rics focusing on features at the sentence level. Ta-
ble 3 illustrates an example selected from the Met-
ricsMATR dataset, consisting two versions of MT
output for a short document of two segments only.
The n-grams matched with the reference are under-

lined, while the lexical cohesion devices are itali-
cized. The two MT outputs have a similar num-
ber of matched n-grams and hence receive similar
BLEU scores. These scores, however, do not reflect
their real difference in quality: the second version is
better, according to human assessment of adequacy.
Instead, their LC ratios seem to represent such a
variation more accurately. The theme of the second
output is also highlighted through the lexical chains,
including main/important, technology/technologies
and achieve/achieving, which create a tight texture
between the two sentences, a crucial factor of text
quality.

To perform MT evaluation at the document level,
the LC and RC ratios can be used alone or in-
tegrated into a sentence-level metric. The former
way has an advantage that it does not have to rely
on any reference translation. LC mainly requires
a thesaurus for computing semantic relation, while
RC only needs a morphological processor such as
stemmer, both of which are available for most lan-

1064



guages. Its drawback, however, lies in the risk of
relying on a single discourse feature. Although lex-
ical cohesion gives a strong indication of text co-
herence, it is not indispensable, because a text can
be coherent without any surface cohesive clue. Fur-
thermore, the quality of a document is also reflected
in that of its sentences. A coherent translation may
be mistranslated, and on the other hand, a text con-
taining lots of sentence-level errors would make it
difficult to determine its document-level quality. A
previous study comparing MT evaluation at the sen-
tence versus document level (Wong et al., 2011) re-
ports a poor consistency in the evaluation results at
these two levels when the sentence-level scores of
MT output are low. In regard of these, how to inte-
grate these two levels of MT evaluation is particu-
larly worth studying.

5 Experiments

We examine, through experiments, the effectiveness
of using LC and RC ratios alone and integrating
them into other evaluation metrics for MT evalua-
tion at the document and system levels. Three evalu-
ation metrics, namely BLEU, TER and METEOR,2

are selected for testing. They represent three dis-
tinctive types of evaluation metrics: n-gram, edit-
distance, and unigram with external language re-
sources, respectively. These metrics are evaluated in
terms of their correlation with human assessments,
using Pearson’s r correlation coefficient. The Met-
ricsMATR and MTC4 datasets and their adequacy
assessments are used as evaluation data. Note that
the adequacy assessment is in fact an evaluation
method for the sentence level. We have to rely on
an assumption that this evaluation data may emulate
document-level quality, since its MT outputs were
assessed sentence by sentence in sequence as in a
document. All experiments are performed under a
setting of multiple reference translations.

The integration of the two ratios into an evaluation
metric follows a simple weighted average approach.
A hybrid metric H is formulated as

H = α mdoc + (1− α) mseg

where mdoc refers to the document-level feature in

use (i.e., LC or RC), mseg to a sentence-level met-
ric, and α to a weight controlling their proportion.
The MetricsMATR dataset is used as training data to
optimize the values of α for different metrics, while
the MTC4 is used as evaluation data. Table 4 shows
the optimized weights for the metrics for evaluation
at the document level.

BLEU 0.28 0.29
TER 0.40 0.38
METEOR 0.19 0.18

course feature into sentence-level metrics

Table 5 presents the correlation rates of evalua-
tion metrics obtained in our experiments under dif-
ferent settings, with their 95% conference intervals
(CI) provided. The LC and RC ratios are found to
have strong correlations with human assessments at
the system level even when used alone, highly com-
parable to BLEU and TER. At the document level,
however, they are not as good as the others. They
show their advantages when integrated into other
metrics, especially BLEU and TER. LC raises the
correlation of BLEU from 0.447 to 0.472 and from
0.861 to 0.905 at the document and system levels,
respectively. It improves TER even more signifi-
cantly, in that the correlation rates are boosted up
from -0.326 to -0.390 at the document level, and
even from -0.601 to -0.763 at the system level. Since
there are only six systems in the MTC4 data, such a
dramatic change may not be as meaningful as the
smooth improvement at the document level. ME-
TEOR is a special case in this experiment. Its corre-
lation cannot be improved by integrating LC orRC,
and is even slightly dropped at the document level.
The cause for this is yet to be identified. Neverthe-
less, these results confirm the close relationship of
an MT system’s capability to appropriately generate
lexical cohesion devices with the quality of its out-
put.

evaluation results at the document level using dif-
ferent evaluation metrics in the MTC4 data. It il-
lustrates the homogeneity/heterogeneity of different
metrics and helps explain the performance change

Table 6: Correlation between the evaluation results of different metrics

by combining sentence- and document-level met-
rics. The table shows that the two ratios LC and
RC highly correlate with each other, as if they are
two variants of quantifying lexical cohesion devices.
The three sentence-level metrics, BLEU, TER and
METEOR, also show strong correlations with each
other, especially between BLEU and METEOR. The
correlations are generally weaker between sentence-
and document-level metrics, for instance, 0.263 be-
tween BLEU and LC and only -0.097 between TER
and LC, showing that they are quite heterogeneous
in nature. This accounts for the significant perfor-
mance gain from their combination: their difference
allows them to complement each other. It is also
worth noting that between METEOR and LC the
correlation of 0.437 is mildly strong, explaining the
negative result of their integration. On the one hand,
lexical cohesion is word choice oriented, which is
only sensitive to the reiteration and semantic relat-
edness of words in MT output. On the other hand,
METEOR is strong in unigram matching, with mul-
tiple strategies to maximize the matching rate be-

tween MT output and reference translation. In this
sense they are homogeneous to a certain extent, ex-
plaining the null effect of their combination.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

In this study we have attempted to address the prob-
lem that most existing MT evaluation metrics dis-
regard the connectivity of sentences in a document.
By focusing on a typical type of cohesion, i.e., lexi-
cal cohesion, we have shown that its use frequency is
a significant factor to differentiate HT from MT and
MT outputs of different quality from each other. The
high correlation rate of its use with translation ade-
quacy also suggests that the more lexical cohesion
devices in use, the better the quality of MT output.
Accordingly we have used two ratios, LC and RC,
to capture such correlativity. Our experimental re-
sults have confirmed the effectiveness of this feature
in accounting for the document-level quality of MT
output. The performance of two evaluation metrics,
BLEU and TER, is highly improved through incor-
porating this document-level feature, in terms of the

1066



change of their correlation with human assessments.
This finding is positive and sheds light on a region

of MT research that is still severely under-explored.
Our approach to extending the granularity of MT
evaluation from sentence to document through lex-
ical cohesion is highly applicable to different lan-
guages. It has a relatively weak demand for lan-
guage resource in comparison with the processing of
other discourse features like grammatical cohesion.
It is also much unaffected by grammatical problems
or errors commonly seen in natural languages and,
in particular, MT outputs.

Our future work will continue to explore the re-
lationship of lexical cohesion to translation quality,
so as to identify, apart from its use frequency, other
significant aspects for MT evaluation at the docu-
ment level. A frequent use of cohesion devices in
a text is not necessarily appropriate, because an ex-
cess of them may decrease the quality and readabil-
ity of a text. Human writers can strategically change
the ways of expression to achieve appropriate coher-
ence and also avoid overuse of the same lexical item.
To a certain extent, this is one of the causes for the
unnaturalness of MT output: it may contain a large
number of lexical cohesion devices which are sim-
ply direct translation of those in a source text that
do not fit in the target context. How to use lexical
cohesion devices appropriately instead of frequently
is thus an important issue to tackle before we can
adopt them in MT and MT evaluation by a suitable
means.
