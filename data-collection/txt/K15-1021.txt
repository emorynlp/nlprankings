Abstract

We propose MVCNN, a convolution neu-
ral network (CNN) architecture for sen-
tence classification. It (i) combines di-
verse versions of pretrained word embed-
dings and (ii) extracts features of multi-
granular phrases with variable-size convo-
lution filters. We also show that pretrain-
ing MVCNN is critical for good perfor-
mance. MVCNN achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four tasks: on small-scale
binary, small-scale multi-class and large-
scale Twitter sentiment prediction and on
subjectivity classification.

1 Introduction

Different sentence classification tasks are crucial
for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) ap-
plications. Natural language sentences have com-
plicated structures, both sequential and hierarchi-
cal, that are essential for understanding them. In
addition, how to decode and compose the features
of component units, including single words and
variable-size phrases, is central to the sentence
classification problem.

In recent years, deep learning models have
achieved remarkable results in computer vision
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition
(Graves et al., 2013) and NLP (Collobert and We-
ston, 2008). A problem largely specific to NLP is
how to detect features of linguistic units, how to
conduct composition over variable-size sequences
and how to use them for NLP tasks (Collobert et
al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014).
Socher et al. (2011a) proposed recursive neural
networks to form phrases based on parsing trees.
This approach depends on the availability of a well
performing parser; for many languages and do-
mains, especially noisy domains, reliable parsing
is difficult. Hence, convolution neural networks

(CNN) are getting increasing attention, for they
are able to model long-range dependencies in sen-
tences via hierarchical structures (Dos Santos and
Gatti, 2014; Kim, 2014; Denil et al., 2014). Cur-
rent CNN systems usually implement a convolu-
tion layer with fixed-size filters (i.e., feature detec-
tors), in which the concrete filter size is a hyper-
parameter. They essentially split a sentence into
multiple sub-sentences by a sliding window, then
determine the sentence label by using the domi-
nant label across all sub-sentences. The underly-
ing assumption is that the sub-sentence with that
granularity is potentially good enough to represent
the whole sentence. However, it is hard to find the
granularity of a “good sub-sentence” that works
well across sentences. This motivates us to imple-
ment variable-size filters in a convolution layer in
order to extract features of multigranular phrases.

Breakthroughs of deep learning in NLP are also
based on learning distributed word representations
– also called “word embeddings” – by neural lan-
guage models (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hin-
ton, 2009; Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov, 2012;
Mikolov et al., 2013a). Word embeddings are de-
rived by projecting words from a sparse, 1-of-V
encoding (V : vocabulary size) onto a lower di-
mensional and dense vector space via hidden lay-
ers and can be interpreted as feature extractors that
encode semantic and syntactic features of words.

Many papers study the comparative perfor-
mance of different versions of word embed-
dings, usually learned by different neural net-
work (NN) architectures. For example, Chen et
al. (2013) compared HLBL (Mnih and Hinton,
2009), SENNA (Collobert and Weston, 2008),
Turian (Turian et al., 2010) and Huang (Huang
et al., 2012), showing great variance in quality
and characteristics of the semantics captured by
the tested embedding versions. Hill et al. (2014)
showed that embeddings learned by neural ma-
chine translation models outperform three repre-

204



sentative monolingual embedding versions: skip-
gram (Mikolov et al., 2013b), GloVe (Pennington
et al., 2014) and C&W (Collobert et al., 2011) in
some cases. These prior studies motivate us to ex-
plore combining multiple versions of word embed-
dings, treating each of them as a distinct descrip-
tion of words. Our expectation is that the com-
bination of these embedding versions, trained by
different NNs on different corpora, should contain
more information than each version individually.
We want to leverage this diversity of different em-
bedding versions to extract higher quality sentence
features and thereby improve sentence classifica-
tion performance.

The letters “M” and “V” in the name
“MVCNN” of our architecture denote the multi-
channel and variable-size convolution filters, re-
spectively. “Multichannel” employs language
from computer vision where a color image has red,
green and blue channels. Here, a channel is a de-
scription by an embedding version.

For many sentence classification tasks, only rel-
atively small training sets are available. MVCNN
has a large number of parameters, so that overfit-
ting is a danger when they are trained on small
training sets. We address this problem by pre-
training MVCNN on unlabeled data. These pre-
trained weights can then be fine-tuned for the spe-
cific classification task.

In sum, we attribute the success of MVCNN
to: (i) designing variable-size convolution filters
to extract variable-range features of sentences and
(ii) exploring the combination of multiple pub-
lic embedding versions to initialize words in sen-
tences. We also employ two “tricks” to further en-
hance system performance: mutual learning and
pretraining.

In remaining parts, Section 2 presents related
work. Section 3 gives details of our classification
model. Section 4 introduces two tricks that en-
hance system performance: mutual-learning and
pretraining. Section 5 reports experimental re-
sults. Section 6 concludes this work.

2 Related Work

Much prior work has exploited deep neural net-
works to model sentences.

Blacoe and Lapata (2012) represented a sen-
tence by element-wise addition, multiplication, or
recursive autoencoder over embeddings of com-
ponent single words. Yin and Schütze (2014) ex-

tended this approach by composing on words and
phrases instead of only single words.

Collobert and Weston (2008) and Yu et al.
(2014) used one layer of convolution over phrases
detected by a sliding window on a target sentence,
then used max- or average-pooling to form a sen-
tence representation.

Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) stacked multiple lay-
ers of one-dimensional convolution by dynamic k-
max pooling to model sentences. We also adopt
dynamic k-max pooling while our convolution
layer has variable-size filters.

Kim (2014) also studied multichannel repre-
sentation and variable-size filters. Differently,
their multichannel relies on a single version of
pretrained embeddings (i.e., pretrained Word2Vec
embeddings) with two copies: one is kept stable
and the other one is fine-tuned by backpropaga-
tion. We develop this insight by incorporating di-
verse embedding versions. Additionally, their idea
of variable-size filters is further developed.

Le and Mikolov (2014) initialized the represen-
tation of a sentence as a parameter vector, treat-
ing it as a global feature and combining this vec-
tor with the representations of context words to
do word prediction. Finally, this fine-tuned vec-
tor is used as representation of this sentence. Ap-
parently, this method can only produce generic
sentence representations which encode no task-
specific features.

Our work is also inspired by studies that com-
pared the performance of different word embed-
ding versions or investigated the combination of
them. For example, Turian et al. (2010) compared
Brown clusters, C&W embeddings and HLBL em-
beddings in NER and chunking tasks. They found
that Brown clusters and word embeddings both
can improve the accuracy of supervised NLP sys-
tems; and demonstrated empirically that combin-
ing different word representations is beneficial.
Luo et al. (2014) adapted CBOW (Mikolov et
al., 2013a) to train word embeddings on differ-
ent datasets: free text documents from Wikipedia,
search click-through data and user query data,
showing that combining them gets stronger results
than using individual word embeddings in web
search ranking and word similarity task. How-
ever, these two papers either learned word repre-
sentations on the same corpus (Turian et al., 2010)
or enhanced the embedding quality by extending
training corpora, not learning algorithms (Luo et

205



al., 2014). In our work, there is no limit to the
type of embedding versions we can use and they
leverage not only the diversity of corpora, but also
the different principles of learning algorithms.

3 Model Description

We now describe the architecture of our model
MVCNN, illustrated in Figure 1.

Multichannel Input. The input of MVCNN in-
cludes multichannel feature maps of a considered
sentence, each is a matrix initialized by a differ-
ent embedding version. Let s be sentence length,
d dimension of word embeddings and c the to-
tal number of different embedding versions (i.e.,
channels). Hence, the whole initialized input is a
three-dimensional array of size c×d× s. Figure 1
depicts a sentence with s = 12 words. Each word
is initialized by c = 5 embeddings, each com-
ing from a different channel. In implementation,
sentences in a mini-batch will be padded to the
same length, and unknown words for correspond-
ing channel are randomly initialized or can acquire
good initialization from the mutual-learning phase
described in next section.

Multichannel initialization brings two advan-
tages: 1) a frequent word can have c representa-
tions in the beginning (instead of only one), which
means it has more available information to lever-
age; 2) a rare word missed in some embedding
versions can be “made up” by others (we call it
“partially known word”). Therefore, this kind of
initialization is able to make use of information
about partially known words, without having to
employ full random initialization or removal of
unknown words. The vocabulary of the binary
sentiment prediction task described in experimen-
tal part contains 5232 words unknown in HLBL
embeddings, 4273 in Huang embeddings, 3299 in
GloVe embeddings, 4136 in SENNA embeddings
and 2257 in Word2Vec embeddings. But only
1824 words find no embedding from any chan-
nel! Hence, multichannel initialization can con-
siderably reduce the number of unknown words.

Convolution Layer (Conv). For convenience,
we first introduce how this work uses a convo-
lution layer on one input feature map to gener-
ate one higher-level feature map. Given a sen-
tence of length s: w1, w2, . . . , ws; wi ∈ Rd de-
notes the embedding of word wi; a convolution
layer uses sliding filters to extract local features
of that sentence. The filter width l is a param-

pretraining.

eter. We first concatenate the initialized embed-
dings of l consecutive words (wi−l+1, . . . ,wi) as
ci ∈ Rld (1 ≤ i < s + l), then generate the fea-
ture value of this phrase as pi (the whole vector
p ∈ Rs+l−1 contains all the local features) using
a tanh activation function and a linear projection
vector v ∈ Rld as:

pi = tanh(vTci + b) (1)

More generally, convolution operation can deal
with multiple input feature maps and can be
stacked to yield feature maps of increasing layers.
In each layer, there are usually multiple filters of
the same size, but with different weights (Kalch-
brenner et al., 2014). We refer to a filter with a
specific set of weights as a kernel. The goal is
often to train a model in which different kernels
detect different kinds of features of a local region.
However, this traditional way can not detect the
features of regions of different granularity. Hence

206



we keep the property of multi-kernel while extend-
ing it to variable-size in the same layer.

As in CNN for object recognition, to increase
the number of kernels of a certain layer, multiple
feature maps may be computed in parallel at the
same layer. Further, to increase the size diversity
of kernels in the same layer, more feature maps
containing various-range dependency features can
be learned. We denote a feature map of the ith

layer by Fi, and assume totally n feature maps ex-
ist in layer i − 1: F1i−1, . . . ,Fni−1. Considering
a specific filter size l in layer i, each feature map
Fji,l is computed by convolving a distinct set of fil-

ters of size l, arranged in a matrix Vj,ki,l , with each
feature map Fki−1 and summing the results:

Fji,l =
n∑

k=1

Vj,ki,l ∗ Fki−1 (2)

where ∗ indicates the convolution operation and
j is the index of a feature map in layer i. The
weights in V form a rank 4 tensor.

Note that we use wide convolution in this work:
it means word representations wg for g ≤ 0 or
g ≥ s+1 are actually zero embeddings. Wide con-
volution enables that each word can be detected by
all filter weights in V.

In Figure 1, the first convolution layer deals
with an input with n = 5 feature maps.1 Its filters
have sizes 3 and 5 respectively (i.e., l = 3, 5), and
each filter has j = 3 kernels. This means this con-
volution layer can detect three kinds of features of
phrases with length 3 and 5, respectively.

DCNN in (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) used one-
dimensional convolution: each higher-order fea-
ture is produced from values of a single dimen-
sion in the lower-layer feature map. Even though
that work proposed folding operation to model
the dependencies between adjacent dimensions,
this type of dependency modeling is still lim-
ited. Differently, convolution in present work is
able to model dependency across dimensions as
well as adjacent words, which obviates the need
for a folding step. This change also means our
model has substantially fewer parameters than the
DCNN since the output of each convolution layer
is smaller by a factor of d.

1A reviewer expresses surprise at such a small number of
maps. However, we will use four variable sizes (see below),
so that the overall number of maps is 20. We use a small
number of maps partly because training times for a network
are on the order of days, so limiting the number of parameters
is important.

Dynamic k-max Pooling. Kalchbrenner et al.
(2014) pool the k most active features compared
with simple max (1-max) pooling (Collobert and
Weston, 2008). This property enables it to con-
nect multiple convolution layers to form a deep
architecture to extract high-level abstract features.
In this work, we directly use it to extract features
for variable-size feature maps. For a given feature
map in layer i, dynamic k-max pooling extracts ki
top values from each dimension and ktop top val-
ues in the top layer. We set

ki = max(ktop, dL− i
L

se) (3)

where i ∈ {1, 2, . . . L} is the order of convolution
layer from bottom to top in Figure 1; L is the total
numbers of convolution layers; ktop is a constant
determined empirically, we set it to 4 as (Kalch-
brenner et al., 2014).

As a result, the second convolution layer in Fig-
ure 1 has an input with two same-size feature
maps, one results from filter size 3, one from filter
size 5. The values in the two feature maps are for
phrases with different granularity. The motivation
of this convolution layer lies in that a feature re-
flected by a short phrase may be not trustworthy
while the longer phrase containing the short one is
trustworthy, or the long phrase has no trustworthy
feature while its component short phrase is more
reliable. This and even higher-order convolution
layers therefore can make a trade-off between the
features of different granularity.

Hidden Layer. On the top of the final k-
max pooling, we stack a fully connected layer to
learn sentence representation with given dimen-
sion (e.g., d).

Logistic Regression Layer. Finally, sentence
representation is forwarded into logistic regression
layer for classification.

In brief, our MVCNN model learns from
(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) to use dynamic k-
max pooling to stack multiple convolution layers,
and gets insight from (Kim, 2014) to investigate
variable-size filters in a convolution layer. Com-
pared to (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), MVCNN
has rich feature maps as input and as output of
each convolution layer. Its convolution opera-
tion is not only more flexible to extract features
of variable-range phrases, but also able to model
dependency among all dimensions of representa-
tions. MVCNN extends the network in (Kim,
2014) by hierarchical convolution architecture and

207



further exploration of multichannel and variable-
size feature detectors.

4 Model Enhancements

This part introduces two training tricks that en-
hance the performance of MVCNN in practice.

Mutual-Learning of Embedding Versions.
One observation in using multiple embedding ver-
sions is that they have different vocabulary cover-
age. An unknown word in an embedding version
may be a known word in another version. Thus,
there exists a proportion of words that can only
be partially initialized by certain versions of word
embeddings, which means these words lack the
description from other versions.

To alleviate this problem, we design a mutual-
learning regime to predict representations of un-
known words for each embedding version by
learning projections between versions. As a result,
all embedding versions have the same vocabulary.
This processing ensures that more words in each
embedding version receive a good representation,
and is expected to give most words occurring in a
classification dataset more comprehensive initial-
ization (as opposed to just being randomly initial-
ized).

Let c be the number of embedding versions in
consideration, V1, V2, . . . , Vi, . . . , Vc their vocab-
ularies, V ∗ = ∪ci=1Vi their union, and V −i =
V ∗\Vi (i = 1, . . . , c) the vocabulary of unknown
words for embedding version i. Our goal is to
learn embeddings for the words in V −i by knowl-
edge from the other c− 1 embedding versions.

We use the overlapping vocabulary between Vi
and Vj , denoted as Vij , as training set, formalizing
a projection fij from space Vi to space Vj (i 6=
j; i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , c}) as follows:

ŵj = Mijwi (4)

where Mij ∈ Rd×d, wi ∈ Rd denotes the rep-
resentation of word w in space Vi and ŵj is the
projected (or learned) representation of word w in
space Vj . Squared error between wj and ŵj is the
training loss to minimize. We use ŵj = fij(wi)
to reformat Equation 4. Totally c(c− 1)/2 projec-
tions fij are trained, each on the vocabulary inter-
section Vij .

Let w be a word that is unknown in Vi, but is
known in V1, V2, . . . , Vk. To compute an embed-
ding for w in Vi, we first compute the k projections
f1i(w1), f2i(w2), . . ., fki(wk) from the source

spaces V1, V2, . . . , Vk to the target space Vi. Then,
the element-wise average of f1i(w1), f2i(w2), . . .,
fki(wk) is treated as the representation of w in Vi.
Our motivation is that – assuming there is a true
representation of w in Vi (e.g., the one we would
have obtained by training embeddings on a much
larger corpus) and assuming the projections were
learned well – we would expect all the projected
vectors to be close to the true representation. Also,
each source space contributes potentially comple-
mentary information. Hence averaging them is a
balance of knowledge from all source spaces.

As discussed in Section 3, we found that for
the binary sentiment classification dataset, many
words were unknown in at least one embedding
version. But of these words, a total of 5022 words
did have coverage in another embedding version
and so will benefit from mutual-learning. In the
experiments, we will show that this is a very ef-
fective method to learn representations for un-
known words that increases system performance if
learned representations are used for initialization.

Pretraining. Sentence classification systems
are usually implemented as supervised training
regimes where training loss is between true la-
bel distribution and predicted label distribution. In
this work, we use pretraining on the unlabeled data
of each task and show that it can increase the per-
formance of classification systems.

Figure 1 shows our pretraining setup. The
“sentence representation” – the output of “Fully
connected” hidden layer – is used to predict the
component words (“on” in the figure) in the sen-
tence (instead of predicting the sentence label Y/N
as in supervised learning). Concretely, the sen-
tence representation is averaged with representa-
tions of some surrounding words (“the”, “cat”,
“sat”, “the”, “mat”, “,” in the figure) to predict the
middle word (“on”).

Given sentence representation s ∈ Rd and ini-
tialized representations of 2t context words (t left
words and t right words): wi−t, . . ., wi−1, wi+1,
. . ., wi+t; wi ∈ Rd, we average the total 2t + 1
vectors element-wise, depicted as “Average” op-
eration in Figure 1. Then, this resulting vector is
treated as a predicted representation of the mid-
dle word and is used to find the true middle word
by means of noise-contrastive estimation (NCE)
(Mnih and Teh, 2012). For each true example, 10
noise words are sampled.

Note that in pretraining, there are three places

208



where each word needs initialization. (i) Each
word in the sentence is initialized in the “Multi-
channel input” layer to the whole network. (ii)
Each context word is initialized as input to the av-
erage layer (“Average” in the figure). (iii) Each tar-
get word is initialized as the output of the “NCE”
layer (“on” in the figure). In this work, we use
multichannel initialization for case (i) and random
initialization for cases (ii) and (iii). Only fine-
tuned multichannel representations (case (i)) are
kept for subsequent supervised training.

The rationale for this pretraining is similar
to auto-encoder: for an object composed of
smaller-granular elements, the representations of
the whole object and its components can learn
each other. The CNN architecture learns sentence
features layer by layer, then those features are jus-
tified by all constituent words.

During pretraining, all the model parameters,
including mutichannel input, convolution parame-
ters and fully connected layer, will be updated un-
til they are mature to extract the sentence features.
Subsequently, the same sets of parameters will be
fine-tuned for supervised classification tasks.

In sum, this pretraining is designed to produce
good initial values for both model parameters and
word embeddings. It is especially helpful for pre-
training the embeddings of unknown words.

5 Experiments

We test the network on four classification tasks.
We begin by specifying aspects of the implemen-
tation and the training of the network. We then
report the results of the experiments.

5.1 Hyperparameters and Training

In each of the experiments, the top of the net-
work is a logistic regression that predicts the
probability distribution over classes given the in-
put sentence. The network is trained to mini-
mize cross-entropy of predicted and true distri-
butions; the objective includes an L2 regulariza-
tion term over the parameters. The set of param-
eters comprises the word embeddings, all filter
weights and the weights in fully connected layers.
A dropout operation (Hinton et al., 2012) is put be-
fore the logistic regression layer. The network is
trained by back-propagation in mini-batches and
the gradient-based optimization is performed us-
ing the AdaGrad update rule (Duchi et al., 2011)

In all data sets, the initial learning rate is 0.01,

dropout probability is 0.8, L2 weight is 5 · 10−3,
batch size is 50. In each convolution layer, filter
sizes are {3, 5, 7, 9} and each filter has five kernels
(independent of filter size).

5.2 Datasets and Experimental Setup

Standard Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al.,
2013). This small-scale dataset includes two tasks
predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. The
output variable is binary in one experiment and
can have five possible outcomes in the other:
{negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat
positive, positive}. In the binary case, we use
the given split of 6920 training, 872 development
and 1821 test sentences. Likewise, in the fine-
grained case, we use the standard 8544/1101/2210
split. Socher et al. (2013) used the Stanford Parser
(Klein and Manning, 2003) to parse each sentence
into subphrases. The subphrases were then labeled
by human annotators in the same way as the sen-
tences were labeled. Labeled phrases that occur
as subparts of the training sentences are treated
as independent training instances as in (Le and
Mikolov, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014).

Sentiment1402 (Go et al., 2009). This is a
large-scale dataset of tweets about sentiment clas-
sification, where a tweet is automatically labeled
as positive or negative depending on the emoticon
that occurs in it. The training set consists of 1.6
million tweets with emoticon-based labels and the
test set of about 400 hand-annotated tweets. We
preprocess the tweets minimally as follows. 1)
The equivalence class symbol “url” (resp. “user-
name”) replaces all URLs (resp. all words that
start with the @ symbol, e.g., @thomasss). 2) A
sequence of k > 2 repetitions of a letter c (e.g.,
“cooooooool”) is replaced by two occurrences of
c (e.g., “cool”). 3) All tokens are lowercased.

Subj. Subjectivity classification dataset3 re-
leased by (Pang and Lee, 2004) has 5000 sub-
jective sentences and 5000 objective sentences.
We report the result of 10-fold cross validation as
baseline systems did.

5.2.1 Pretrained Word Vectors

In this work, we use five embedding versions, as
shown in Table 1, to initialize words. Four of
them are directly downloaded from the Internet.

different corpora with different algorithms. This is
the very property that we want to make use of to
promote the system performance.

Table 2 shows the number of unknown words
in each task when using corresponding embed-
ding version to initialize (rows “HLBL”, “Huang”,
“Glove”, “SENNA”, “W2V”) and the number of
words fully initialized by five embedding versions
(“Full hit” row), the number of words partially
initialized (“Partial hit” row) and the number of
words that cannot be initialized by any of the em-
bedding versions (“No hit” row).

About 30% of words in each task have partially
initialized embeddings and our mutual-learning is
able to initialize the missing embeddings through
projections. Pretraining is expected to learn good
representations for all words, but pretraining is es-
pecially important for words without initialization
(“no hit”); a particularly clear example for this is
the Senti140 task: 236,484 of 387,877 words or
61% are in the “no hit” category.

5.2.2 Results and Analysis

Table 3 compares results on test of MVCNN and
its variants with other baselines in the four sen-
tence classification tasks. Row 34, “MVCNN
(overall)”, shows performance of the best config-
uration of MVCNN, optimized on dev. This ver-
sion uses five versions of word embeddings, four
filter sizes (3, 5, 7, 9), both mutual-learning and
pretraining, three convolution layers for Senti140
task and two convolution layers for the other tasks.
Overall, our system gets the best results, beating
all baselines.

The table contains five blocks from top to bot-
tom. Each block investigates one specific config-
urational aspect of the system. All results in the
five blocks are with respect to row 34, “MVCNN
(overall)”; e.g., row 19 shows what happens when

HLBL is removed from row 34, row 28 shows
what happens when mutual learning is removed
from row 34 etc.

The block “baselines” (1–18) lists some sys-
tems representative of previous work on the cor-
responding datasets, including the state-of-the-art
systems (marked as italic). The block “versions”
(19–23) shows the results of our system when one
of the embedding versions was not used during
training. We want to explore to what extend dif-
ferent embedding versions contribute to perfor-
mance. The block “filters” (24–27) gives the re-
sults when individual filter width is discarded. It
also tells us how much a filter with specific size
influences. The block “tricks” (28–29) shows the
system performance when no mutual-learning or
no pretraining is used. The block “layers” (30–33)
demonstrates how the system performs when it has
different numbers of convolution layers.

From the “layers” block, we can see that our
system performs best with two layers of convo-
lution in Standard Sentiment Treebank and Sub-
jectivity Classification tasks (row 31), but with
three layers of convolution in Sentiment140 (row
32). This is probably due to Sentiment140 being a
much larger dataset; in such a case deeper neural
networks are beneficial.

The block “tricks” demonstrates the effect of
mutual-learning and pretraining. Apparently, pre-
training has a bigger impact on performance than
mutual-learning. We speculate that it is be-
cause pretraining can influence more words and all
learned word embeddings are tuned on the dataset
after pretraining.

The block “filters” indicates the contribution of
each filter size. The system benefits from filters
of each size. Sizes 5 and 7 are most important for
high performance, especially 7 (rows 25 and 26).

In the block “versions”, we see that each em-
bedding version is crucial for good performance:
performance drops in every single case. Though it
is not easy to compare fairly different embedding
versions in NLP tasks, especially when those em-
beddings were trained on different corpora of dif-
ferent sizes using different algorithms, our results
are potentially instructive for researchers making
decision on which embeddings to use for their own
tasks.

6 Conclusion

This work presented MVCNN, a novel CNN ar-
chitecture for sentence classification. It com-
bines multichannel initialization – diverse ver-
sions of pretrained word embeddings are used –
and variable-size filters – features of multigranu-
lar phrases are extracted with variable-size convo-
lution filters. We demonstrated that multichannel
initialization and variable-size filters enhance sys-
tem performance on sentiment classification and
subjectivity classification tasks.

7 Future Work

As pointed out by the reviewers the success of the
multichannel approach is likely due to a combina-
tion of several quite different effects.

First, there is the effect of the embedding learn-
ing algorithm. These algorithms differ in many as-
pects, including in sensitivity to word order (e.g.,
SENNA: yes, word2vec: no), in objective func-
tion and in their treatment of ambiguity (explicitly
modeled only by Huang et al. (2012).

Second, there is the effect of the corpus. We
would expect the size and genre of the corpus to
have a big effect even though we did not analyze
this effect in this paper.

Third, complementarity of word embeddings is
likely to be more useful for some tasks than for
others. Sentiment is a good application for com-
plementary word embeddings because solving this
task requires drawing on heterogeneous sources
of information, including syntax, semantics and
genre as well as the core polarity of a word. Other
tasks like part of speech (POS) tagging may bene-
fit less from heterogeneity since the benefit of em-
beddings in POS often comes down to making a
correct choice between two alternatives – a single
embedding version may be sufficient for this.

We plan to pursue these questions in future
work.
