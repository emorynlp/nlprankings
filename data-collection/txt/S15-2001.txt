Abstract

In this shared task, we present evaluations
on two related tasks Paraphrase Identification
(PI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (SS) sys-
tems for the Twitter data. Given a pair of
sentences, participants are asked to produce
a binary yes/no judgement or a graded score
to measure their semantic equivalence. The
task features a newly constructed Twitter Para-
phrase Corpus that contains 18,762 sentence
pairs. A total of 19 teams participated, sub-
mitting 36 runs to the PI task and 26 runs to
the SS task. The evaluation shows encourag-
ing results and open challenges for future re-
search. The best systems scored a F1-measure
of 0.674 for the PI task and a Pearson corre-
lation of 0.619 for the SS task respectively,
comparing to a strong baseline using logis-
tic regression model of 0.589 F1 and 0.511
Pearson; while the best SS systems can of-
ten reach >0.80 Pearson on well-formed text.
This shared task also provides insights into the
relation between the PI and SS tasks and sug-
gests the importance to bringing these two re-
search areas together. We make all the data,
baseline systems and evaluation scripts pub-
licly available.1

1 Introduction

The ability to identify paraphrases, i.e. alternative
expressions of the same (or similar) meaning, and
the degree of their semantic similarity has proven
useful for a wide variety of natural language pro-
cessing applications (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). It

1http://www.cis.upenn.edu/˜xwe/
semeval2015pit/

is particularly useful to overcome the challenge of
high redundancy in Twitter and the sparsity inherent
in their short texts (e.g. oscar nom’d doc↔ Oscar-
nominated documentary; some1 shot a cop↔ some-
one shot a police). Emerging research shows para-
phrasing techniques applied to Twitter data can im-
prove tasks like first story detection (Petrović et al.,
2012), information retrieval (Zanzotto et al., 2011)
and text normalization (Xu et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2013).

Previously, many researchers have investigated
ways of automatically detecting paraphrases on
more formal texts, like newswire text. The ACL
Wiki2 gives an excellent summary of the state-of-
the-art paraphrase identification techniques. These
can be categorized into supervised methods (Qiu
et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2006; Das and Smith, 2009;
Socher et al., 2011; Blacoe and Lapata, 2012; Mad-
nani et al., 2012; Ji and Eisenstein, 2013) and unsu-
pervised methods (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Rus et al.,
2008; Fernando and Stevenson, 2008; Islam and
Inkpen, 2007; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011). A few
recent studies have highlighted the potential and
importance of developing paraphrase identification
(Zanzotto et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2013) and semantic
similarity techniques (Guo and Diab, 2012) specif-
ically for tweets. They also indicated that the very
informal language, especially the high degree of lex-
ical variation, used in social media has posed serious
challenges to both tasks.

Table 2: Statistics of PIT-2015 Twitter Paraphrase Corpus. Debatable cases are those received a medium-score from
annotators. The percentage of paraphrases is lower in the test set because it was constructed without topic selection.

The SemEval-2015 shared task on Paraphrase and
Semantic Similarity In Twitter (PIT) uses a training
and development set of 17,790 sentence pairs and a
test set of 972 sentence pairs with paraphrase anno-
tations (see examples in Table 1) that is the same as
the Twitter Paraphrase Corpus we developed earlier
in (Xu, 2014) and (Xu et al., 2014). This PIT-2015
paraphrase dataset is distinct from the data used in
previous studies in many aspects: (i) it contains sen-
tences that are opinionated and colloquial, represent-
ing realistic informal language usage; (ii) it con-
tains paraphrases that are lexically diverse; and (iii)
it contains sentences that are lexically similar but se-
mantically dissimilar. It raises many interesting re-
search questions and could lead to a better under-
standing of our daily used language and how seman-
tics can be captured in such language. We believe
that such a common testbed will facilitate docking
of the different approaches for purposes of compari-
son, lead to a better understanding of how semantics
are conveyed in natural language, and help advance
other NLP techniques for noisy user-generated text
in the long run.

2 Task Description and Evaluation Metrics

The task has two sentence-level sub-tasks: a para-
phrase identification task and an optional semantic
textual similarity task. The two sub-tasks share the
same data but differ in annotation and evaluation.

Task A – Paraphrase Identification (PI)
Given two sentences, determine whether they
express the same or very similar meaning. Fol-
lowing the literature on paraphrase identifica-
tion, we evaluate system performance by the F-
1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
against human judgements.

Task B – Semantic Textual Similarity (SS)
Given two sentences, determine a numerical
score between 0 (no relation) and 1 (semantic
equivalence) to indicate their semantic similar-
ity. Following the literature, the system outputs
are compared by Pearson correlation with hu-
man scores. We also compute the maximum
F-1 score over the precision-recall curve as an
additional data point.

3 Corpus

In this shared task, we use the Twitter Paraphrase
Corpus that we first presented in (Xu, 2014) and (Xu
et al., 2014). Table 2 shows the basic statistics of the
corpus. The sentences are preprocessed with tok-
enization,3 POS and named entity tags.4 The train-
ing and development set consists of 17,790 sentence
pairs posted between April 24th and May 3rd, 2013
from 500+ trending topics featured on Twitter (ex-
cluding hashtags). The training and development set
is a random split. Each sentence pair is annotated by
5 different crowdsourcing workers. For the test set,
we obtain both crowdsourced and expert labels on
972 sentence pairs from 20 randomly sampled Twit-
ter trending topics between May 13th and June 10th,
2013. We use expert labels in this SemEval eval-
uation. Our dataset is more realistic and balanced,
containing about 70% non-paraphrases vs. the 34%
non-paraphrases in the benchmark Microsoft Para-
phrase Corpus derived from news articles by Dolan
et al. (2004). As noted in (Das and Smith, 2009), the
lack of natural non-paraphrases in the MSR corpus
creates bias towards certain models.

4 Annotation

In this section, we describe our data collection and
annotation methodology. Since Twitter users are
free to talk about anything regarding any topic, a
random pair of sentences about the same topic has
a low chance of expressing the same meaning (em-
pirically, this is less than 8%). This causes two prob-
lems: a) it is expensive to obtain paraphrases via
manual annotation; b) non-expert annotators tend to
loosen the criteria and are more likely to make false
positive errors. To address these challenges, we de-
sign a simple annotation task and introduce two se-
lection mechanisms to select sentences which are
more likely to be paraphrases, while preserving di-
versity and representativeness.

Figure 1: A heat-map showing overlap between ex-
pert and crowdsourcing annotation. The intensity along
the diagonal indicates good reliability of crowdsourcing
workers for this particular task; and the shift above the di-
agonal reflects the difference between the two annotation
schemas. For crowdsourcing (turk), the numbers indicate
how many annotators out of 5 picked the sentence pair as
paraphrases; 0,1 are considered non-paraphrases; 3,4,5
are paraphrases. For expert annotation, all 0,1,2 are non-
paraphrases; 4,5 are paraphrases. Medium-scored cases
(2 for crowdsourcing; 3 for expert annotation) are dis-
carded in the system evaluation of the PI sub-task.

4.1 Raw Data from Twitter

We crawl Twitter’s trending topics and their associ-
ated tweets using public APIs.5 According to Twit-
ter, trends are determined by an algorithm which
identifies topics that are immediately popular, rather
than those that have been popular for longer periods
of time or which trend on a daily basis. We tokenize,
remove emoticons6 and split tweet into sentences.

4.2 Task Design on Mechanical Turk

We show the annotator an original sentence, then
ask them to pick sentences with the same mean-
ing from 10 candidate sentences. The original and
candidate sentences are randomly sampled from the
same topic. For each such 1 vs. 10 question, we ob-
tain binary judgements from 5 different annotators,
paying each annotator $0.02 per question. On aver-
age, each question takes one annotator about 30 ∼
45 seconds to answer.

Figure 2: The proportion of paraphrases (percentage of positive votes from annotators) vary greatly across different
topics. Automatic filtering in Section 4.4 roughly doubles the paraphrase yield.

4.3 Annotation Quality

We remove problematic annotators by checking
their Cohen’s Kappa agreement (Artstein and Poe-
sio, 2008) with other annotators. We also compute
inter-annotator agreement with an expert annotator
on the test dataset of 972 sentence pairs. In the ex-
pert annotation, we adopt a 5-point Likert scale to
measure the degree of semantic similarity between
sentences, which is defined by Agirre et al. (2012)
as follows:

5: Completely equivalent, as they mean the same
thing;

4: Mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details
differ;

3: Roughly equivalent, but some important informa-
tion differs/missing.

2: Not equivalent, but share some details;
1: Not equivalent, but are on the same topic;
0: On different topics.

Although the two scales of expert and crowd-
sourcing annotation are defined differently, their
Pearson correlation coefficient reaches 0.735 (two-
tailed significance 0.001). Figure 1 shows a heat-
map representing the detailed overlap between the
two annotations. It suggests that the graded simi-
larity annotation task could be reduced to a binary
choice in a crowdsourcing setup. As for the binary
paraphrase judgements, the integrated judgement of

five crowdsourcing workers achieve a F1-score of
0.823, precision of 0.752 and recall of 0.908 against
expert annotations.

4.4 Automatic Summarization Inspired
Sentence Filtering

We filter the sentences within each topic to se-
lect more probable paraphrases for annotation. Our
method is inspired by a typical problem in extractive
summarization, that the salient sentences are likely
redundant (paraphrases) and need to be removed
in the output summaries. We employ the scoring
method used in SumBasic (Nenkova and Vander-
wende, 2005; Vanderwende et al., 2007), a simple
but powerful summarization system, to find salient
sentences. For each topic, we compute the probabil-
ity of each word P (wi) by simply dividing its fre-
quency by the total number of all words in all sen-
tences. Each sentence s is scored as the average of
the probabilities of the words in it, i.e.

Salience(s) =
∑
wi∈s

P (wi)
|{wi|wi ∈ s}| (1)

We then rank the sentences and pick the original
sentence randomly from top 10% salient sentences
and candidate sentences from top 50% to present to
the annotators.

In a trial experiment of 20 topics, the filtering
technique double the yield of paraphrases from 152

4



to 329 out of 2000 sentence pairs over naı̈ve ran-
dom sampling (Figure 2 and Figure 3). We also use
PINC (Chen and Dolan, 2011) to measure the qual-
ity of paraphrases collected (Figure 4). PINC was
designed to measure n-gram dissimilarity between
two sentences, and in essence it is the inverse of
BLEU. In general, the cases with high PINC scores
include more complex and interesting rephrasings.

4.5 Topic Selection using Multi-Armed Bandits
(MAB) Algorithm

Another approach to increasing paraphrase yield is
to choose more appropriate topics. This is partic-
ularly important because the number of paraphrases
varies greatly from topic to topic and thus the chance
to encounter paraphrases during annotation (Fig-
ure 2). We treat this topic selection problem as a
variation of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) prob-
lem (Robbins, 1985) and adapt a greedy algorithm,
the bounded �-first algorithm, of Tran-Thanh et al.
(2012) to accelerate our corpus construction.

Our strategy consists of two phases. In the first
exploration phase, we dedicate a fraction of the to-
tal budget, �, to explore randomly chosen arms of
each slot machine (trending topic on Twitter), each
m times. In the second exploitation phase, we sort
all topics according to their estimated proportion
of paraphrases, and sequentially annotate d (1−�)Bl−m e
arms that have the highest estimated reward until
reaching the maximum l = 10 annotations for any
topic to insure data diversity.

We tune the parameters m to be 1 and � to be be-
tween 0.35 ∼ 0.55 through simulation experiments,
by artificially duplicating a small amount of real an-
notation data. We then apply this MAB algorithm
in the real-world. We explore 500 random topics
and then exploited 100 of them. The yield of para-
phrases rises to 688 out of 2000 sentence pairs by
using MAB and sentence filtering, a 4-fold increase
compared to only using random selection (Figure 3).

5 Baselines

We provide three baselines, including a random
baseline, a strong supervised baseline and a state-
of-the-art unsupervised system:

Random:
This baseline provides a randomized real num-

ber between [0, 1] for each test sentence pair as
semantic similarity score, and uses 0.5 as cutoff
for binary paraphrase identification output.

Logistic Regression:
This is a supervised logistic regression (LR)
baseline used by Das and Smith (2009). It uses
simple n-gram (also in stemmed form) overlap-
ping features but shows very competitive per-
formance on the MSR news paraphrase corpus.
It uses 0.5 as cutoff to create binary outputs for
the paraphrase identification task.

Weighted Matrix Factorization (WTMF):7
The third baseline is a state-of-the-art unsu-
pervised method developed by Guo and Diab
(2012). It is specially developed for short sen-
tences by modeling the semantic space of both
words that are present in and absent from the
sentences (Guo and Diab, 2012). The model
was learned from WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010),
OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), Wiktionary, the
Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979). It
uses 0.5 as cutoff in the binary paraphrase iden-
tification task.

6 Systems and Results

A total of 18 teams participated in the PI task (re-
quired), 13 of which also submitted to the SS task
(optional). Every team submitted 2 runs except one
(up to 2 were are allowed).

6.1 Evaluation Results

Table 3 shows the evaluation results. We use the F1-
score and Pearson correlation as the primary eval-
uation metric for the PI and SS task respectively.
The results are very exciting that most systems out-
performed the two strong baselines we chose, while
still showing room for improvement towards the hu-
man upper-bound estimated by the crowdsourcing
worker’s performance.

6.2 Discussion

Most participants choose supervised methods, ex-
cept for MathLingBp who uses semi-supervised,

Columbia and Yamraj who use unsupervised meth-
ods. While the best performed systems are super-
vised, the best unsupervised system still outperforms
some supervised systems and the state-of-the-art un-
supervised baseline. About half of systems use word
embeddings and many use neural networks.

To out best knowledge, this is the first time to
have a large number of systems in an evaluation that
has the two related tasks — paraphrase identification
and semantic similarity, side by side for compari-
son. One interesting observation that comes out is
the performance of the same system on the two tasks
(“F1 vs. Pearson”) are not necessarily related. For
example, ASOBEK ranked 1st (out of 35 runs) and
18th (out of 25 runs) in the PI and SS tasks respec-
tively, RTM-DCU ranked 27th and 3rd, while the
MITRE system ranked 3nd and 1st place. Neither
“F1 vs. max-F1” nor “Pearson vs. maxF1” nor “F1
vs. Pearson” show a strong correlation. It implies
that (i) high-performance PI systems can be devel-
oped focusing on the binary classification problem
without focusing on the degree of similarity; (ii) it
is crucial to select the threshold to balance precision
and recall for the PI binary classification problem;
(iii) it is important for SS system to handle the de-
batable cases proporiately.

6.3 Participants’ Systems

There are in total 19 teams participated:

AJ: This team utilizes TERp and BLEU – auto-
matic evaluation metrics for Machine Trans-
lation. The system uses a logistic regression
model and performs threshold selection.

AMRITACEN: This team uses Recursive Auto
Encoders (RAEs). The matrix generated for
the given input sentences is of variable size,
then converted to equal sized matrix using re-
peat matrix concept.

ASOBEK (Eyecioglu and Keller, 2015): This
team uses SVM classifier with simple lexical
word overlap and character n-grams features.

CDTDS (Karampatsis, 2015): This team uses
support vector regression trained only on the
training set using the numbers of positive votes
out of the 5 crowdsourcing annotations.

Columbia: This system maps each original sen-
tence to a low dimensional vector as Orthog-
onal Matrix Factorization (Guo et al., 2014),
and then computes similarity score based on the
low dimensional vectors.

Depth: This team uses neural network that learns
representation of sentences, then compute sim-
ilarity scores based on hidden vector represen-
tations between two sentences.

EBIQUITY (Satyapanich et al., 2015): This
team trains supervised SVM and logistic re-

Table 3: Evaluation results. The first column presents the rank of each team in the two tasks based on each team’s best
system. The superscripts are the ranks of systems, ordered by F1 for Paraphrase Identification (PI) task and Pearson
for Semantic Similarity (SS) task. � indicates unsupervised or semi-supervised system. In total, 19 teams participated
in the PI task, of which 14 teams also participated in the SS task. Note that although the two sub-tasks share the same
test set of 972 sentence pairs, the PI task ignores 134 debatable cases (received a medium-score from expert annotator)
and uses only 838 pairs (663 paraphrases and 175 non-paraphrases) in evaluation, while SS task uses all 972 pairs.
This causes that the F1-score in the PI task can be higher than the maximum F1-score in the SS task. Also note that
the F1-scores of the baselines in the PI task are higher than reported in the Table 2 of (Xu et al., 2014), because the
later reported maximum F1-scores on the PI task, ignoring the debatable cases.

gression models using features of semantic
similarities between sentence pairs.

ECNU (Zhao and Lan, 2015): This team adopts
typical machine learning classifiers and uses a
variety of features, such as surface text, seman-
tic level, textual entailment, word distributional
representations by deep learning methods.

FBK-HLT (Ngoc Phuoc An Vo and Popescu,
2015): This team uses supervised learning
model with different features for the 2 runs,
such as n-gram overlap, word alignment and
edit distance.

Hassy: This team uses a bag-of-embeddings ap-
proach via supervised learning. Two sentences
are first embedded into a vector space, and then
the system computes the dot-product of the two
sentence embeddings.

HLTC-HKUST (Bertero and Fung, 2015): This
team uses supervised classification with a stan-
dard two-layer neural network classifier. The
features used include translation metrics, lex-
ical, syntactic and semantic similarity scores,
the latter with an emphasis on aligned semantic
roles comparison.

MathLingBp: This team implements the align-
and-penalize architecture described by Han
et al. (2013) with slight modifications and
makes use of several word similarity metrics.
One metric relies on a mapping of words to
vectors built from the Rovereto Twitter N-
Gram corpus, another on a synonym list built
from Wiktionary’s translations, while a third
approach derives word similarity from concept
graphs built using the 4lang lexicon and the
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
(Kornai et al., 2015).

MITRE (Zarrella et al., 2015): A recurrent neu-
ral network models semantic similarity be-
tween sentences using the sequence of sym-
metric word alignments that maximize cosine
similarity between word embeddings. We in-
clude features from local similarity of char-
acters, random projection, matching word se-
quences, pooling of word embeddings, and

alignment quality metrics. The resulting en-
semble uses both semantic and string matching
at many levels of granularity.

RTM-DCU (Bicici, 2015): This team uses ref-
erential translation machines (RTM) and ma-
chine translation performance prediction sys-
tem (MTPP) for predicting semantic similar-
ity where indicators of translatability are used
as features (Biçici and Way, 2014) and in-
stance selection for RTM is performed with
FDA5 (Biçici and Yuret, 2014). RTM works
as follows: FDA5→MTPP→ML training→
predict.

Rob (van der Goot and van Noord, 2015): This
system is inspired by a state-of-the-art semantic
relatedness prediction system by Bjerva et al.
(2014). It combines features from different
parses with lexical and compositional distribu-
tional feature using a logistic regression model.

STANFORD: This team uses a supervised sys-
tem with sentiment, phrase similarity matrix,
and alignment features. Similarity metrics are
based on vector space representation of phrases
which was trained on a large corpus.

TkLbLiiR (Glavaš et al., 2015): This team uses
a supervised model with about 15 comparison-
based numeric features. The most important
features are the distributional features weighted
by the topic-specific information.

WHUHJP: This team uses the word2vec tool to
train a vector model on the training data, then
computes distributed representations of sen-
tences in the test set and their cosine similarity.

Yamraj: This team uses pre-trained word and
phrase vectors on Google News data set (about
100 billion words) and Wikipeida articles. The
system relies on the cosine distance between
vectors representing the sentences computed
using open-source toolkit Gensim.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented the task definition, data annota-
tion and evaluation results to the first Paraphrase and
Semantic Similarity In Twitter (PIT) shared task.

8



Our analysis provides some initial insights into the
relation and the difference between paraphrase iden-
tification and semantic similarity problems. We
make all the data, baseline systems and evaluation
scripts publicly available.8

In the future, we plan to extend the task to allow
leverage of more information from social networks,
for example, by providing the full tweets (and their
ids) that are associated with each sentence and with
each topic.
