Abstract 

We describe our efforts to apply the Penn 

Discourse Treebank guidelines on a Tamil 

corpus to create an annotated corpus of dis-

course relations in Tamil. After conducting 

a preliminary exploratory study on Tamil 

discourse connectives, we show our obser-

vations and results of a pilot experiment 

that we conducted by annotating a small 

portion of our corpus. Our ultimate goal is 

to develop a Tamil Discourse Relation 

Bank that will be useful as a resource for 

further research in Tamil discourse. Fur-

thermore, a study of the behavior of dis-

course connectives in Tamil will also help 

in furthering the cross-linguistic under-

standing of discourse connectives. 

1 Introduction 

The study of discourse structure in natural lan-

guage processing has its applications in emerging 

fields such as coherence evaluation, question an-

swering, natural language generation and textual 

summarization. Such a study is possible in a given 

human language only if there are sufficient dis-

course annotated resources available for that lan-

guage. The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a 

project whose goal is to annotate the discourse re-

lations holding between events described in a text. 

The PDTB is a lexically grounded approach where 

discourse relations are anchored in lexical items 

wherever they are explicitly realized in the text 

(Miltsakaki et al. 2004, Prasad et al., 2008). To 

foster cross-linguistic studies in discourse rela-

tions, projects similar to the PDTB in discourse 

annotation were initiated in Czech (Mladová et al., 

2008), Chinese (Xue, 2005), Turkish (Zeyrek and 

Webber, 2008) and Hindi (Prasad et al., 2008). We 

explore how the underlying framework and annota-

tion guidelines apply to Tamil, a morphologically 

rich, agglutinative, free word order language. 

In this paper, we present how a corpus of Tamil 

texts was created on which we performed our pilot 

experiment. Next, in Section 3 we cover the basics 

of the PDTB guidelines that we followed during 

our annotation process. In Section 4, we show var-

ious categories of Tamil discourse connectives that 

we identified after a preliminary study on dis-

course connectives in Tamil, illustrating each with 

examples. In Section 5, we discuss some interest-

ing issues specific to Tamil that we encountered 

during discourse annotation and present the results 

of the pilot experiment that we performed on our 

source corpus. We conclude this paper in Section 6 

by discussing about challenges that were unique to 

our work and our plans for the future. 

2 Source Corpus 

We collected Tamil encyclopedia articles from the 

June 2008 edition of the Wikipedia static HTML 

dumps
1
. Elements such as HTML metadata, navi-

gational links, etc. were then removed until only 

the text of the articles remained. A corpus was then 

built by collecting the texts from all the articles in 

the dump. The corpus thus created consists of

about 2.2 million words from approximately 

200,000 sentences. 

Since the texts used in building the corpus were 

all encyclopedia articles featured in the Tamil lan-

guage version of Wikipedia, the corpus covers a 

wide variety of topics including arts, culture, biog-

raphies, geography, society, history, etc., written 

and edited by volunteers from around the world. 

3 Penn Discourse Treebank Guidelines  

The PDTB is a resource built on discourse struc-

ture in (Webber and Joshi, 1998) where discourse 

connectives are treated as discourse-level predi-

cates that always take exactly two abstract objects 

such as events, states and propositions as their ar-

guments. We now describe the types of connec-

tives and their senses from the PDTB framework 

and provide examples from Tamil sentences. 

3.1 Annotation Process 

The process of discourse annotation involves iden-

tifying discourse connectives in raw text and then 

annotating their arguments and semantics. Dis-

course connectives are identified as being explicit, 

implicit, AltLex, EntRel or NoRel (Prasad et al. 

2008). These classes are described in detail in Sec-

tion 4. By convention, annotated explicit connec-

tives are underlined and implicit connectives are 

shown by the marker, “(Implicit=)”. As can be 

seen in example (1), one of the arguments is shown 

enclosed between {} and the other argument is 

shown in []. The AltLex, EntRel or NoRel relations 

are shown by underlining, i.e., as “(AltLex=)”, 

“(EntRel)” and “(NoRel)”, respectively. 
 

(1) {eN kAl uDaindadaN}Al [eNNAl viLayADa 

muDiyAdu].  

„{My leg broke}, hence [I cannot play].‟ 

 

3.2 Sense Hierarchy 

The semantics of discourse relations are termed as 

senses and are then classified hierarchically using 

four top-level classes „Comparison‟, „Contingen-

cy‟, „Expansion‟ and „Temporal‟. Each class is 

refined by its component types and these, in turn, 

are further refined by the subtype level. 

It is interesting to note that some connectives 

have multiple senses. In example (2) the affixed –

um connective carries the sense of type Expan-

sion:Conjunction „also‟ whereas in example (3) the 

same affix carries the sense of the subtype Contin-

gency:Concession „however‟.

„{By this, he became the tenth player to cross 

nine thousand runs in one-day internationals}. 

[He] also [attained the record of becoming the

„Though {two more teams participated when 

compared to last Cricket World Cup}, [the total

4 Discourse Connectives in Tamil 

Tamil is an agglutinative language where mor-

phemes are affixed to the roots of individual 

words, a trait that it shares with many other Dra-

vidian languages and languages like Turkish, Esto-

nian and Japanese. Here, each affix represents 

information such as discourse connective, gender, 

number, etc. We now describe how we try to cap-

ture various types of Tamil discourse connectives 

using a proposed scheme which is based on the 

existing PDTB guidelines proposed by (Prasad et 

al., 2007). 

 

4.1 Explicit Discourse Connectives 
 

Explicit discourse connectives are lexical items 

present in text that are used to anchor the discourse 

relations portrayed by them. In Tamil, they are 

found as affixes to the verb, as in example (4) 

where the affix -Al conveys the meaning „so‟. This 

is in a way similar to the simplex subordinators in 

Turkish, as described in (Zeyrek and Webber, 

2008). However, like in English, explicit discourse 

connectives are also realized as unbound lexical 

items, as can be seen in example (5) where the 

word eNavE means „hence‟. 

 

120



(4) {avaradu uDalnalam sariyillAmaiy}Al [nAngu 

mAdangaL avarAl viLayADa iyalavillai].  

„{He was suffering from ill health} so [he 

could not play for four months].‟ 

(5)  {tirukkuraL aNaittu madattiNarum paDittu 

payaNaDaiyum vagaiyil ezudappattuLLadu}. 

eNavE [innUl palarAl pArAttappaDuginradu]. 

„{Thirukkural has been written in such a way 

that people from all religions can benefit from 

it}. Hence, [this book is praised by many].‟ 

 

Syntactically, explicit connectives can be coordi-

nating conjunctions e.g., alladu („or‟), subordinat-

ing conjunctions e.g., -Al („so‟), sentential relatives 

e.g., -adaNAl („because of which‟), particles e.g., -

um („also‟) or adverbials e.g., -pOdu („just then‟). 

 

Explicit connectives also occur as conjoined 

connectives where two or more instances of con-

nectives share the same two arguments. Such con-

nectives are annotated as distinct types and are 

annotated discontinuously, as seen in example (6) 

where the connectives -um and -um are paired to-

gether to share the same arguments.  
 

(6)  {mANavargaLukku sattuNavu aLikkav}um 

[avargaL sariyAga uDarpayirchi seiyyav]um 

arasup paLLigaL udava vENDum. 

„Government schools should help in {providing 

nutritious food to the students} and [making 

sure they perform physical exercises]. 

 

4.2 Implicit Discourse Connectives 
 

Implicit discourse connectives are inserted be-

tween adjacent sentence pairs that are not related 

explicitly by any of the syntactically defined set of 

explicit connectives. In such a case, we attempted 

to infer a discourse relation between the sentences 

and a connective expression that best conveys the 

inferred relation is inserted. In example (7), the 

implicit expression uthAraNamAga („for example‟) 

has been inserted as an inferred discourse relation 

between the two sentences. 

 
 (7)  {IyOrA iNa makkaLiN moziyil irundu iNru 

Angilattil vazangum sorkaL uLLaNa}. (Implic-

it=uthAraNamAga) [dingO, vUmErA, vAlabi 

pONra sorkaL IyOravilirindu tONriya sorkaL 

dAN]. 

  „{There are words that are present in English 

that originated from the language of the Eora 

people}. (Implicit= For example) [Dingo, 

Woomera and Wallaby are words with their or-

igins in Eora].‟ 

 

4.3 AltLex, EntRel and NoRel 
 

In cases where no implicit connective was appro-

priately found to be placed between adjacent sen-

tence-pairs, we now look at three distinct classes. 

AltLex relations, as seen in example (8) are dis-

course relations where the insertion of an implicit 

connective leads to a redundancy in its expression 

as the relation is already alternatively lexicalized 

by some other expression that cannot be labeled as 

an explicit connective. Example (9) shows an En-

tRel relation where no discourse relation can be 

inferred and the second sentence provides further 

description of an entity realized in the first sen-

tence. When neither a discourse relation nor entity-

based coherence can be inferred between the two 

adjacent sentences, it is described as a NoRel, 

shown in example (10). 

 
(8) {mudalAvadAga mAgim, jOgEshwari, 

pUrivilla rayil nilayangaLil guNDu vedittadu}. 

(AtlLex=idai toDarndu) [mErku rayilvEyiN

 „{Initially, bombs exploded in Mahim, Joge-

shwari and Poorivilla}. (AltLex=following 

this) [all the trains from the western railway 

were halted].‟ 

(9) {ivvANDu kirikket ulagakkOppai mErkindiyat

  „{This year‟s Cricket World Cup was held in 

West Indies from the thirteenth of March to the

petition, the teams representing the sixteen na-

tions were grouped into four groups with four

„{Sachin Tendulkar is considered the best

5 Observations and Results 

5.1 Combined connectives 

There is a paired connective -um … -um (…) that 

sometimes expresses an Expansion:Conjunction 

relation between the events where each -um is suf-

fixed to the verb that describes each event (see ex-

ample (6)). Also, there is a connective -Al which 

usually never occurs more than once and some-

times expresses a Contingency:Cause relation be-

tween two events. 

It is interesting to see that in sentences like 

(11), the -Al combines with the -um … -um to ex-

press something like a new type of relation. In the 

process, the -um … -um causes the -Al, which is 

usually not doubled, to become doubled, thereby 

forming an -Alum … -Alum. We call this special 

type of connectives as combined connectives, as 

shown in example (11). 
 

(11)  {kirikket viLayADiyad}Alum {uDarpayirci 

seidad}Alum [sOrvaDaindEN]. 

„Because {I played cricket} and because {I did 

exercise} [I am tired].‟ 

 

5.2 Redundant connectives 

The connective -O … -O (…) that conveys a dubi-

tative relation also combines with the -Al connec-

tive in a way similar to what was shown in Section 

5.1 to form the combined connective -AlO … -AlO 

(…). 

However, in example (12), alladu, an equiva-

lent of the -O … -O connective has also occurred in 

addition to the combined -AlO … -AlO connective. 

This may be purely redundant, or could serve a 

purpose to emphasize the dubitative relation ex-

pressed by both alladu and -O … -O. 

 
(12)  {pOtti samappatt}AlO alladu {muDivu pera-

paDAmal pON}AlO [piNvarum muraigaL mU-

lam aNigaL tarappaDuttapaDum]. 

„If {a game is tied} or if {there is no result}, 

[the qualified teams are chosen using the fol-

lowing rules].‟ 

5.3 Results of Pilot Study 

In this experiment, we looked at 511 sentences 

from the corpus mentioned in Section 2 and anno-

tated a total of 323 connectives. Table 1 shows the 

distribution of the annotated connectives across the 

different types such as Explicit, Implicit, EntRel, 

AltLex and NoRel.

NoRel 2 - 0.6 - 
 

Table 1: Results of Pilot Experiment 

 

While a higher percentage of the connectives 

annotated are those of the Explicit type, it can also 

be seen that there is a higher proportion of unique 

connectives in the Implicit and AltLex types. Note 

that since EntRel and NoRel connectives are not 

associated with a sense relation or a lexical item, 

their counts are left blank. 

6 Challenges and Future Work 

The agglutinative nature of the Tamil language 

required a deeper analysis to look into suffixes that 

act as discourse connectives in addition to those 

that occur as unbounded lexical items. We also 

found certain interesting examples that were dis-

tinct from those observed during similar approach-

es in relatively less morphologically rich languages 

like English. 

While this was a first attempt at creating a dis-

course annotated Tamil corpus, we are planning to 

conduct future work involving multiple annotators 

which would yield information on annotation met-

rics like inter-annotator agreement, for example. 

Our work and results would also be useful for 

similar approaches in other morphologically rich 

and related South Indian languages such as Mala-

yalam, Kannada, Telugu, etc. 

We will also work on a way in which the dis-

course annotations have been performed will help 

in augmenting the information provided during 

dependency annotations at the sentence-level.
