Abstract 

As an alternative to requiring substantial su-
pervised relation training data, many have ex-
plored bootstrapping relation extraction from 
a few seed examples. Most techniques assume 
that the examples are based on easily spotted 
anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a 
corpus which contain the anchors are then 
used to induce alternative ways of expressing 
the relation. We explore whether coreference 
can improve the learning process. That is, if 
the algorithm considered examples such as his 
sister, would accuracy be improved? With co-
reference, we see on average a 2-fold increase 
in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful 
machine coreference, we see significant in-
crease in recall on all relations. Precision in-
creases in four cases and decreases in six.  

1 Introduction 

As an alternative to requiring substantial super-
vised relation training data (e.g. the ~300k words 
of detailed, exhaustive annotation in Automatic 
Content Extraction (ACE) evaluations1) many have 
explored bootstrapping relation extraction from a 
few (~20) seed instances of a relation. Key to such 
approaches is a large body of unannotated text that 
can be iteratively processed as follows:  
1. Find sentences containing the seed instances. 
2. Induce patterns of context from the sentences. 
3. From those patterns, find more instances. 
4. Go to 2 until some condition is reached. 

Most techniques assume that relation instanc-
es, like hasBirthDate(Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

1756), are realized in the corpus as relation texts2 
with easily spotted anchors like Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756.  

In this paper we explore whether using corefer-
ence can improve the learning process. That is, if 
the algorithm considered texts like his birth in 
1756 for the above relation, would performance of 
the learned patterns be better? 

2 Related Research 

There has been much work in relation extraction 
both in traditional supervised settings and, more 
recently, in bootstrapped, semi-supervised settings. 
To set the stage for discussing related work, we 
highlight some aspects of our system. Our work 
initializes learning with about 20 seed relation in-
stances and uses about 9 million documents of un-
annotated text3 as a background bootstrapping 
corpus. We use both normalized syntactic structure 
and surface strings as features. 

Much has been published on learning relation 
extractors using lots of supervised training, as in 
ACE, which evaluates system performance in de-
tecting a fixed set of concepts and relations in text. 
Researchers have typically used this data to incor-
porate a great deal of structural syntactic infor-
mation in their models (e.g. Ramshaw, 2001), but 
the obvious weakness of these approaches is the 
resulting reliance on manually annotated examples, 
which are expensive and time-consuming to create. 

                                                           
2 Throughout we will use relation instance to refer to a fact 
(e.g. ORGHasEmployee(Apple, Steve Jobs)), while we will use 
relation text to refer a particular sentence entailing a relation 
instance (e.g. Steve Jobs is Apple’s CEO).

Others have explored automatic pattern genera-
tion from seed examples. Agichtein & Gravano 
(2000) and Ravichandran & Hovy (2002) reported 
results for generating surface patterns for relation 
identification; others have explored similar ap-
proaches (e.g. Pantel & Pennacchiotti, 2006). 
Mitchell et al. (2009) showed that for macro-
reading, precision and recall can be improved by 
learning a large set of interconnected relations and 
concepts simultaneously. In all cases, the ap-
proaches used surface (word) patterns without co-
reference. In contrast, we use the structural 
features of predicate-argument structure and em-
ploy coreference. Section 3 describes our particular 
approach to pattern and relation instance scoring 
and selection.  

Another research strand (Chen et al., 2006 & 
Zhou et al., 2008) explores semi-supervised rela-
tion learning using the ACE corpus and assuming 
manual mention markup. They measure the accu-
racy of relation extraction alone, without including 
the added challenge of resolving non-specific rela-
tion arguments to name references. They limit their 
studies to the small ACE corpora where mention 
markup is manually encoded.  

Most approaches to automatic pattern genera-
tion have focused on precision, e.g., Ravichandran 
and Hovy (2002) report results in the Text Retriev-
al Conference (TREC) Question Answering track, 
where extracting one text of a relation instance can 
be sufficient, rather than detecting all texts. Mitch-
ell et al. (2009), while demonstrating high preci-
sion, do not measure recall. 

In contrast, our study has emphasized recall. A 
primary focus on precision allows one to ignore 
many relation texts that require coreference or 
long-distance dependencies; one primary goal of 
our work is to measure system performance in ex-
actly those areas. There are at least two reasons to 
not lose sight of recall. For the majority of entities 
there will be only a few mentions of that entity in 
even a large corpus. Furthermore, for many infor-
mation-extraction problems the number documents 
at runtime will be far less than web-scale.  

3 Approach 

Figure 1 depicts our approach for learning patterns 
to detect relations. At each iteration, the steps are:   
(1) Given the current relation instances, find possi-
ble texts that entail the relation by finding sentenc-

es in the corpus containing all arguments of an in-
stance.  
(2)  As in Freedman et al. (2010) and Boschee et 
al. (2008), induce possible patterns using the con-
text in which the arguments appear. Patterns in-
clude both surface strings and normalized syntactic 
structures.4 Each proposed pattern is applied to the 
corpus to find a set of hypothesized texts. For each 
pattern, a confidence score is assigned using esti-
mated precision5 and recall.  The highest confi-
dence patterns are added to the pattern set.6 
(3) The patterns are applied to the corpus to find 
additional possible relation instances. For each 
proposed instance, we estimate a score using a Na-
ive Bayes model with the patterns as the features.  
When using coreference, this score is penalized if 
an instance’s supporting evidence involves low-
confidence coreference links. The highest scoring 
instances are added to the instance set. 
 (4) After the desired number of iterations (in these 
experiments, 20) is complete, a human reviews the 
resulting pattern set and removes those patterns 
which are clearly incorrect (e.g. ‘X visited Y’ for 
hasBirthPlace).7   

 
Figure 1: Approach to learning relations 

We ran this system in two versions: –Coref has 
no access to coreference information, while +Coref 
(the original system) does. The systems are other-
wise identical. Coreference information is provided 
by BBN’s state-of-the-art information extraction 

                                                           
4 Surface text patterns with wild cards are not proposed until 
the third iteration.  
5 Estimated recall is the weighted fraction of known instances 
found. Estimated precision is the weighted average of the 
scores of matched instances; scores for unseen instances are 0.   
6 As more patterns are accepted in a given iteration, we raise 
the confidence threshold.  Usually, ~10 patterns are accepted 
per iteration.  
7 This takes about ten minutes per relation, which is less than 
the time to choose the initial seed instances.

system (Ramshaw, et al., 2011; NIST, 2007) in a 
mode which sacrifices some accuracy for speed 
(most notably by reducing the parser’s search 
space). The IE system processes over 50MB/hour 
with an  average EDR Value score when evaluated 
on an 8-fold cross-validation of the ACE 2007.  

+Coref can propose relation instances from text 
in which the arguments are expressed as either 
name or non-name mentions. When the text of an 
argument of a proposed instance is a non-name, the 
system uses coreference to resolve the non-name to 
a name. -Coref can only propose instances based 
on texts where both arguments are names.8 

This has several implications: If a text that en-
tails a relation instance expresses one of the argu-
ments as a non-name mention (e.g. “Sue’s husband 
is here.”), -Coref will be unable to learn an in-
stance from that text. Even when all arguments are 
expressed as names, -Coref may need to use more 
specific, complex patterns to learn the instance 
(e.g. “Sue asked her son, Bob, to set the table”). 
We expect the ability to run using a ‘denser,’ more 
local space of patterns to be a significant advantage 
of +Coref. Certain types of patterns (e.g. patterns 
involving possessives) may also be less likely to be 
learned by -Coref. Finally, +Coref has access to 
much more training data at the outset because it 
can find more matching seed instances,9 potentially 
leading to better and more stable training. 

4 Evaluation Framework 

Estimating recall for bootstrapped relation learning 
is a challenge except for corpora small enough for 
complete annotation to be feasible, e.g., the ACE 
corpora. ACE typically had a test set of ~30,000 
words and ~300k for training. Yet, with a small 
corpus, rare relations will be inadequately repre-
sented.10 Macro-reading evaluations (e.g. Mitchell, 
2009) have not estimated recall, but have measured 
precision by sampling system output and determin-
ing whether the extracted fact is true in the world. 

                                                           
8 An instance like hasChild(his father, he) would be useful 
neither during training nor (without coreference) at runtime. 
9 An average of 12,583 matches versus 2,256 matches. If mul-
tiple mentions expressing an argument occur in one sentence, 
each match is counted, inflating the difference. 
10 Despite being selected to be rich in the 18 ACE relation 
subtypes, the 10 most frequent subtypes account for over 90% 
of the relations with the 4 most frequent accounting for 62%; 
the 5 least frequent relation subtypes occur less than 50 times. 

Here we extend this idea to both precision and re-
call in a micro-reading context.  

Precision is measured by running the system 
over the background corpus and randomly sam-
pleing 100 texts that the system believes entail 
each relation. From the mentions matching the ar-
gument slots of the patterns, we build a relation 
instance.  If these mentions are not names (only 
possible for +Coref), they are resolved to names 
using system coreference.  For example, given the 
passage in Figure 2 and the pattern ‘(Y, poss:X)’, 
the system would match the mentions X=her and 
Y=son, and build the relation instance 
hasChild(Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.). 

During assessment, the annotator is asked 
whether, in the context of the whole document, a 
given sentence entails the relation instance. We 
thus treat both incorrect relation extraction and 
incorrect reference resolution as mistakes.  

To measure recall, we select 20 test relation in-
stances and search the corpus for sentences con-
taining all arguments of a test instance (explicitly 
or via coreference). We randomly sampled from 
this set, choosing at most 10 sentences for each test 
instance, to form a collection of at most 200 sen-
tences likely to be texts expressing the desired rela-
tion. These sentences were then manually 
annotated in the same manner as the precision an-
notation. Sentences that did not correctly convey 
the relation instance were removed, and the re-
maining set of sentences formed a recall set.  We 
consider a recall set instance to be found by a sys-
tem if the system finds a relation of the correct 
type in the sentence. We intentionally chose to 
sample 10 sentences from each test example, rather 
than sampling from the set of all sentences found. 
This prevents one or two very commonly ex-
pressed instances from dominating the recall set. 
As a result, the recall test set is biased away from 
“true” recall, because it places a higher weight on 
the “long tail” of instances. However, this gives a 
more accurate indication of the system’s ability to 
find novel instances of a relation.  

Ethel Kennedy says that when the family gathered 
for Thanksgiving she wanted the children to know 
what a real turkey looked like. So she sent her son, 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to a farm to buy two birds.

5 Empirical Results 

Table 1 gives results for precision, recall, and F 
for +Coref (+) and –Coref (-). In all cases remov-
ing coreference causes a drop in recall, ranging 
from only 33%(hasBirthPlace) to over 90% 
(GPEEmploys). The median drop is 68%. 

 

5.1 Recall 

There are two potential sources of –Coref’s 
lower recall. For some relation instances, the text 
will contain only non-named instances, and as a 
result -Coref will be unable to find the instance.     
-Coref is also at a disadvantage while learning, 
since it has access to fewer texts during bootstrap-
ping.  Figure 311 presents the fraction of instances 
in the recall test set for which both argument 
names appear in the sentence.  Even with perfect 
patterns, -Coref has no opportunity to find roughly 
25% of the relation texts because at least one ar-
gument is not expressed as a name.   

To further understand -Coref’s lower perfor-
mance, we created a third system, *Coref, which 
used coreference at runtime but not during train-
ing.12 In a few cases, such as hasBirthPlace, 
*Coref is able to almost match the recall of the 
system that used coreference during learning 
(+Coref), but on average the lack of coreference at 
runtime accounts for only about 25% of the differ-
ence, with the rest accounted for by differences in 
the pattern sets learned. 

Figure 4 shows the distribution of argument 
mention types for +Coref on the recall set.  Com-
paring this to Figure 3, we see that +Coref uses 
name-name pairs far less often than it could (less 
                                                           
11 Figures 3 & 4 do not include hasBirthDate: There is only 1 
potential named argument for this relation, the other is a date.  
12 *Coref was added after reading paper reviews, so there was 
not time to do annotation for a precision evaluation for it. 

than 50% of the time overall).  Instead, even when 
two names are present in a sentence that entails the 
relation, +Coref chooses to find the relation in 
name-descriptor and name-pronoun contexts which 
are often more locally related in the sentences. 

 
Figure 4: Distribution of argument mention types for 

+Coref matches on the recall set 
For the two cases with the largest drops in re-

call, ORGEmploys and GPEEmploys, +Coref and –
Coref have very different trajectories during train-
ing.  For example, in the first iteration, –Coref 
learns patterns involving director, president, and 
head for ORGEmploys, while +Coref learns pat-
terns involving joined and hired.  We speculate 
that –Coref may become stuck because the most 
frequent name-name constructions, e.g. ORG/GPE 
title PERSON (e.g. Brazilian President Lula da 
Silva), are typically used to introduce top officials. 
For such cases, even without co-reference, system 
specific effort and tuning could potentially have 
improved –Coref’s ability to learn the relations.  

5.2 Precision 

Results on precision are mixed. While for 4 of 
the relations +Coref is higher, for the 6 others the 
addition of coreference reduces precision. The av-
erage precisions for +Coref and –Coref are 82.2 
and 87.8, and the F-score of +Coref exceeded that

of –Coref for all relations. Thus while +Coref pays 
a price in precision for its improved recall, in many 
applications it may be a worthwhile tradeoff. 

Though one might expect that errors in coref-
erence would reduce precision of +Coref, such er-
rors may be balanced by the need to use longer 
patterns in –Coref. These patterns often include 
error-prone wildcards which lead to a drop in pre-
cision. Patterns with multiple wildcards were also 
more likely to be removed as unreliable in manual 
pattern pruning, which may have harmed the recall 
of –Coref, while improving its precision. 

5.3 Further Analysis 

Our analysis thus far has focused on micro-
reading which requires a system find all mentions 
of an instance relation – i,e, in our evaluation Or-
gLeader(Apple, Steve Jobs) might occur in as 
many as 20 different contexts.  While –Coref per-
forms poorly at micro-reading, it could still be ef-
fective for macro-reading, i.e. finding at least one 
instance of the relation OrgLeader(Apple, Steve 
Jobs). As a rough measure of this, we also evaluat-
ed recall by counting the number of test instances 
for which at least one answer was found by the two 
systems. With this method, +Coref’s recall is still 
higher for all but one relation type, although the 
gap between the systems narrows somewhat. 

 
In addition to our recall evaluation, we meas-

ured the number of sentences containing relation 
instances found by each of the systems when ap-
plied to 5,000 documents (see Table 3).  For al-
most all relations, +Coref matches many more 
sentences, including finding more sentences for 
those relations for which it has higher precision. 

6 Conclusion 

Our experiments suggest that in contexts where 
recall is important incorporating coreference into a 
relation extraction system may provide significant 
gains. Despite being noisy, coreference infor-
mation improved F-scores for all relations in our 
test, more than doubling the F-score for 5 of the 
10.  

Why is the high error rate of coreference not 
very harmful to +Coref?  We speculate that there 
are two reasons. First, during training, not all co-
reference is treated equally.  If the only evidence 
we have for a proposed instance depends on low 
confidence coreference links, it is very unlikely to 
be added to our instance set for use in future itera-
tions.  Second, for both training and runtime, many 
of the coreference links relevant for extracting the 
relation set examined here are fairly reliable, such 
as wh-words in relative clauses. 

There is room for more investigation of the 
question, however. It is also unclear if the same 
result would hold for a very different set of rela-
tions, especially those which are more event-like 
than relation-like.
