Abstract

Predicting context-dependent and non-literal
utterances like sarcastic and ironic expres-
sions still remains a challenging task in NLP,
as it goes beyond linguistic patterns, encom-
passing common sense and shared knowl-
edge as crucial components. To capture com-
plex morpho-syntactic features that can usu-
ally serve as indicators for irony or sarcasm
across dynamic contexts, we propose a model
that uses character-level vector representations
of words, based on ELMo. We test our model
on 7 different datasets derived from 3 different
data sources, providing state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in 6 of them, and otherwise offering
competitive results.

1 Introduction

Sarcastic and ironic expressions are prevalent in
social media and, due to the tendency to invert
polarity, play an important role in the context of
opinion mining, emotion recognition and senti-
ment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2006). Sarcasm and
irony are two closely related linguistic phenom-
ena, with the concept of meaning the opposite of
what is literally expressed at its core. There is
no consensus in academic research on the formal
definition, both terms are non-static, depending on
different factors such as context, domain and even
region in some cases (Filatova, 2012).

In light of the general complexity of natural lan-
guage, this presents a range of challenges, from
the initial dataset design and annotation to com-
putational methods and evaluation (Chaudhari and
Chandankhede, 2017). The difficulties lie in cap-
turing linguistic nuances, context-dependencies
and latent meaning, due to richness of dynamic
variants and figurative use of language (Joshi et al.,
2015).

The automatic detection of sarcastic expres-
sions often relies on the contrast between posi-

tive and negative sentiment (Riloff et al., 2013).
This incongruence can be found on a lexical level
with sentiment-bearing words, as in ”I love be-
ing ignored”. In more complex linguistic settings
an action or a situation can be perceived as neg-
ative, without revealing any affect-related lexical
elements. The intention of the speaker as well
as common knowledge or shared experience can
be key aspects, as in ”I love waking up at 5 am”,
which can be sarcastic, but not necessarily. Simi-
larly, verbal irony is referred to as saying the op-
posite of what is meant and based on sentiment
contrast (Grice, 1975), whereas situational irony is
seen as describing circumstances with unexpected
consequences (Lucariello, 1994; Shelley, 2001).

Empirical studies have shown that there are spe-
cific linguistic cues and combinations of such that
can serve as indicators for sarcastic and ironic ex-
pressions. Lexical and morpho-syntactic cues in-
clude exclamations and interjections, typographic
markers such as all caps, quotation marks and
emoticons, intensifiers and hyperboles (Kunne-
man et al., 2015; Bharti et al., 2016). In the case of
Twitter, the usage of emojis and hashtags has also
proven to help automatic irony detection.

We propose a purely character-based architec-
ture which tackles these challenges by allowing
us to use a learned representation that models fea-
tures derived from morpho-syntactic cues. To do
so, we use deep contextualized word representa-
tions, which have recently been used to achieve the
state of the art on six NLP tasks, including senti-
ment analysis (Peters et al., 2018). We test our
proposed architecture on 7 different irony/sarcasm
datasets derived from 3 different data sources, pro-
viding state-of-the-art performance in 6 of them
and otherwise offering competitive results, show-
ing the effectiveness of our proposal. We make

2 Related work

Apart from the relevance for industry applications
related to sentiment analysis, sarcasm and irony
detection has received great traction within the
NLP research community, resulting in a variety
of methods, shared tasks and benchmark datasets.
Computational approaches for the classification
task range from rule-based systems (Riloff et al.,
2013; Bharti et al., 2015) and statistical methods
and machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machines (Joshi et al., 2015; Tungthamthiti
et al., 2010), Naive Bayes and Decision Trees
(Reyes et al., 2013) leveraging extensive feature
sets, to deep learning-based approaches. In this
context, Tay et al. (2018). delivered state-of-the-
art results by using an intra-attentional component
in addition to a recurrent neural network. Previ-
ous work such as the one by Veale (2016) had
proposed a convolutional long-short-term memory
network (CNN-LSTM-DNN) that also achieved
excellent results. A comprehensive survey on au-
tomatic sarcasm detection was done by Joshi et al.
(2016), while computational irony detection was
reviewed by Wallace (2015).

Further improvements both in terms of classic
and deep models came as a result of the SemEval
2018 Shared Task on Irony in English Tweets
(Van Hee et al., 2018). The system that achieved
the best results was hybrid, namely, a densely-
connected BiLSTM with a multi-task learning
strategy, which also makes use of features such as
POS tags and lexicons (Wu et al., 2018).

3 Proposed Approach

The wide spectrum of linguistic cues that can serve
as indicators for sarcastic and ironic expressions
has been usually exploited for automatic sarcasm
or irony detection by modeling them in the form
of binary features in traditional machine learning.

On the other hand, deep models for irony and
sarcasm detection, which are currently offer state-
of-the-art performance, have exploited sequential
neural networks such as LSTMs and GRUs (Veale,
2016; Zhang et al., 2016) on top of distributed
word representations. Recently, in addition to us-
ing a sequential model, Tay et al. (2018) proposed
to use intra-attention to compare elements in a
sequence against themselves. This allowed the
model to better capture word-to-word level inter-
actions that could also be useful for detecting sar-
casm, such as the incongruity phenomenon (Joshi

et al., 2015). Despite this, all models in the lit-
erature rely on word-level representations, which
keeps the models from being able to easily cap-
ture some of the lexical and morpho-syntactic cues
known to denote irony, such as all caps, quotation
marks and emoticons, and in Twitter, also emojis
and hashtags.

The usage of a purely character-based input
would allow us to directly recover and model these
features. Consequently, our architecture is based
on Embeddings from Language Model or ELMo
(Peters et al., 2018). The ELMo layer allows
to recover a rich 1,024-dimensional dense vec-
tor for each word. Using CNNs, each vector is
built upon the characters that compose the under-
lying words. As ELMo also contains a deep bi-
directional LSTM on top of this character-derived
vectors, each word-level embedding contains con-
textual information from their surroundings. Con-
cretely, we use a pre-trained ELMo model, ob-
tained using the 1 Billion Word Benchmark which
contains about 800M tokens of news crawl data
from WMT 2011 (Chelba et al., 2014).

Subsequently, the contextualized embeddings
are passed on to a BiLSTM with 2,048 hidden
units. We aggregate the LSTM hidden states us-
ing max-pooling, which in our preliminary exper-
iments offered us better results, and feed the re-
sulting vector to a 2-layer feed-forward network,
where each layer has 512 units. The output of this
is then fed to the final layer of the model, which
performs the binary classification.

4 Experimental Setup

We test our proposed approach for binary clas-
sification on either sarcasm or irony, on seven
benchmark datasets retrieved from different media
sources. Below we describe each dataset, please
see Table 1 below for a summary.

Twitter: We use the Twitter dataset provided
for the SemEval 2018 Task 3, Irony Detection in
English Tweets (Van Hee et al., 2018). The dataset
was manually annotated using binary labels. We
also use the dataset by Riloff et al. (2013), which
is manually annotated for sarcasm. Finally, we use
the dataset by Ptáček et al. (2014), who collected a
user self-annotated corpus of tweets with the #sar-
casm hashtag.

Reddit: Khodak et al. (2017) collected SARC,
a corpus comprising of 600.000 sarcastic com-
ments on Reddit. We use main subset, SARC 2.0,

and the political subset, SARC 2.0 pol.

Online Dialogues: We utilize the Sarcasm Cor-
pus V1 (SC-V1) and the Sarcasm Corpus V2 (SC-
V2), which are subsets of the Internet Argument
Corpus (IAC). Compared to other datasets in our
selection, these differ mainly in text length and
structure complexity (Oraby et al., 2016).

In Table 1, we see a notable difference in terms
of size among the Twitter datasets. Given this cir-
cumstance, and in light of the findings by Van Hee
et al. (2018), we are interested in studying how
the addition of external soft-annotated data im-
pacts on the performance. Thus, in addition to the
datasets introduced before, we use two corpora for
augmentation purposes. The first dataset was col-
lected using the Twitter API, targeting tweets with
the hashtags #sarcasm or #irony, resulting on a to-
tal of 180,000 and 45,000 tweets respectively. On
the other hand, to obtain non-sarcastic and non-
ironic tweets, we relied on the SemEval 2018 Task
1 dataset (Mohammad et al., 2018). To augment
each dataset with our external data, we first filter
out tweets that are not in English using language
guessing systems. We later extract all the hash-
tags in each target dataset and proceed to augment
only using those external tweets that contain any
of these hashtags. This allows us to, for each class,
add a total of 36,835 tweets for the Ptáček cor-
pus, 8,095 for the Riloff corpus and 26,168 for the
SemEval-2018 corpus.

In terms of pre-processing, as in our case the
preservation of morphological structures is cru-
cial, the amount of normalization is minimal. Con-
cretely, we forgo stemming or lemmatizing, punc-
tuation removal and lowercasing. We limit our-
selves to replacing user mentions and URLs with
one generic token respectively. In the case of the
SemEval-2018 dataset, an additional step was to
remove the hashtags #sarcasm, #irony and #not, as
they are the artifacts used for creating the dataset.

For tokenizing, we use a variation of the Twok-
enizer (Gimpel et al., 2011) to better deal with
emojis.

Our models are trained using Adam with a
learning rate of 0.001 and a decay rate of 0.5 when
there is no improvement on the accuracy on the
validation set, which we use to select the best mod-
els. We also experimented using a slanted trian-
gular learning rate scheme, which was shown by
Howard and Ruder (2018) to deliver excellent re-
sults on several tasks, but in practice we did not
obtain significant differences. We experimented
with batch sizes of 16, 32 and 64, and dropouts
ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. The size of the LSTM
hidden layer was fixed to 1,024, based on our pre-
liminary experiments. We do not train the ELMo
embeddings, but allow their dropouts to be active
during training.

5 Results

Table 2 summarizes our results. For each dataset,
the top row denotes our baseline and the second
row shows our best comparable model. Rows with
FULL models denote our best single model trained
with all the development available data, without
any other preprocessing other than mentioned in
the previous section. In the case of the Twitter
datasets, rows indicated as AUG refer to our the
models trained using the augmented version of the
corresponding datasets.

For the case of the SemEval-2018 dataset we
use the best performing model from the Shared
Task as a baseline, taken from the task descrip-
tion paper (Van Hee et al., 2018). As the winning
system is a voting-based ensemble of 10 models,
for comparison, we report results using an equiva-
lent setting. For the Riloff, Ptáček, SC-V1 and SC-
V2 datasets, our baseline models are taken directly
from Tay et al. (2018). As their pre-processing
includes truncating sentence lengths at 40 and 80

tokens for the Twitter and Dialog datasets respec-
tively, while always removing examples with less
than 5 tokens, we replicate those steps and re-
port our results under these settings. Finally, for
the Reddit datasets, our baselines are taken from
Khodak et al. (2017). Although their models are
trained for binary classification, instead of report-
ing the performance in terms of standard classi-
fication evaluation metrics, their proposed evalu-
ation task is predicting which of two given state-
ments that share the same context is sarcastic, with
performance measured solely by accuracy. We fol-
low this and report our results.

In summary, we see our introduced models are
able to outperform all previously proposed meth-
ods for all metrics, except for the SemEval-2018
best system. Although our approach yields higher
Precision, it is not able to reach the given Recall
and F1-Score. We note that in terms of single-
model architectures, our setting offers increased
performance compared to Wu et al. (2018) and
their obtained F1-score of 0.674. Moreover, our
system does so without requiring external features
or multi-task learning. For the other tasks we are
able to outperform Tay et al. (2018) without re-
quiring any kind of intra-attention. This shows

the effectiveness of using pre-trained character-
based word representations, that allow us to re-
cover many of the morpho-syntactic cues that tend
to denote irony and sarcasm.

Finally, our experiments showed that enlarg-
ing existing Twitter datasets by adding external
soft-labeled data from the same media source
does not yield improvements in the overall perfor-
mance. This complies with the observations made
by Van Hee et al. (2018). Since we have designed
our augmentation tactics to maximize the overlap
in terms of topic, we believe the soft-annotated na-
ture of the additional data we have used is the rea-
son that keeps the model from improving further.

6 Conclusions

We have presented a deep learning model based
on character-level word representations obtained
from ELMo. It is able to obtain the state of the
art in sarcasm and irony detection in 6 out of 7
datasets derived from 3 different data sources. Our
results also showed that the model does not bene-
fit from using additional soft-labeled data in any
of the three tested Twitter datasets, showing that
manually-annotated data may be needed in order
to improve the performance in this way.
