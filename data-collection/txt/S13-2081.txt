Abstract

We evaluate a naive machine learning ap-
proach to sentiment classification focused
on Twitter in the context of the sentiment
analysis task of SemEval-2013. We employ
a classifier based on the Random Forests al-
gorithm to determine whether a tweet ex-
presses overall positive, negative or neu-
tral sentiment. The classifier was trained
only with the provided dataset and uses as
main features word vectors and lexicon word
counts. Our average F-score for all three
classes on the Twitter evaluation dataset
was 51.55%. The average F-score of both
positive and negative classes was 45.01%.
For the optional SMS evaluation dataset our
overall average F-score was 58.82%. The
average between positive and negative F-
scores was 50.11%.

1 Introduction

Sentiment Analysis is a growing research field, es-
pecially on web social networks. In this setting,
users share very diverse messages such as real-
time reactions to news, events and daily experi-
ences. The ability to tap on a vast repository of
opinions, such as Twitter, where there is great di-
versity of topics, has become an important goal
for many different applications. However, due to
the nature of the text, NLP systems face additional

challenges in this context. Shared messages, such
as tweets, are very short and users tend to resort to
highly informal an noisy speech.

Following this trend, the 2013 edition of Se-
mEval1 included a sentiment analysis on Twitter
task (SemEval-2013 Task 2). Participants were
asked to implement a system capable of determin-
ing whether a given tweet expresses positive, neg-
ative or neutral sentiment. To help in the develop-
ment of the system, an annotated training corpus
was released. Systems that used only the given
corpus for training were considered constrained,
while others were considered unconstrained. The
submitted prototypes were evaluated in a dataset
consisting of around 3700 tweets of several topics.
The metric used was the average F-score between
the positive and negative classes.

Our goal with this participation was to create a
baseline system from which we can build upon and
perform experiments to compare new approaches
with the state-of-the-art.

The last decade saw a growing interest in systems
to automatically process sentiment in text. Many
approaches to detect subjectivity and determine

polarity of opinions in news articles, weblogs and
product reviews have been proposed (Pang et al.,
2002; Pang et al., 2004; Wiebe et al., 2005; Wil-
son et al., 2005). This sub-field of NLP, known as
Sentiment Analysis is presented in great depth in
(Liu, 2012).

The emergence and proliferation of microblog
platforms created a medium where people express
and convey all kinds of information. In particu-
lar, these platforms are a rich source of subjec-
tive and opinionated text, which has motivated
the application of similar techniques to this do-
main. However, in this context, messages tend
to be very short and highly informal, full of ty-
pos, slang and unconventional spelling, posing ad-
ditional challenges to NLP systems. In fact, early
experiments in Sentiment Analysis in the context
of Twitter (Barbosa et al., 2010; Davidov et al.,
2010; Koulompis et al., 2011; Pak et al., 2010;
Bifet et al., 2010) show that the techniques that
proved effective in other domains are not sufficient
in the microblog setting. In the spirit of these ap-
proaches, we included a preprocessing step, fol-
lowed by feature extraction focusing on word,
lexical and Twitter-specific features. Finally, we
use annotated data to train an automatic classifier
based on the Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) and
BESTrees (Sun et al., 2011) learning algorithms.

3 Resources

Two annotated datasets were made available to
participants of SemEval-2013 Task 2: one for
training purposes which was to contain 8000 to
12000 tweets; and another, for development, con-
taining 2000. The combined datasets ended up
amounting to a little over 7500 tweets. The distri-
bution of positives, negatives and neutrals for the
combined datasets can be found in Table 1. Nearly
half of all tweets belonged to the neutral class, and
negatives represent just 15% of these datasets.

Class Number
Positive 37%
Negative 15%
Neutral 48%

Random examples of each class drawn from the
datasets are shown in Table 2.

4 Approach

Given our goal of creating a baseline system, we
experimented with a common set of features used
in sentiment analysis. The messages were mod-
elled as a combination of binary (or presence) uni-
grams, lexical features and Twitter-specific fea-
tures. We decided to follow a supervised approach
by learning a Random Forests classifier from the
annotated data provided by the organisers of the
workshop (see Section 3). In summary, the devel-
opment of our system consisted of four steps: 1)
preprocessing of the data, 2) feature extraction, 3)
learning the classifier, and 4) applying the classi-
fier to the test set.

4.1 Preprocessing
The lexical variation introduced by typos, ab-
breviations, slang and unconventional spelling,
leads to very large vocabularies. The resulting

491



sparse vector representations with few non-zero
values hamper the learning process. In order to
tackle this problem, we replaced user mentions
(@<username>) with a fixed tag <USER> and
URLs with the tag <URL>. Then, each sentence
was normalised by converting to lower-case and
reducing character repetitions to at most 3 charac-
ters (e.g. ”heelloooooo!” would be normalised to
”heellooo!”). Finally, we performed the lemma-
tisation of the sentence using the Morphadorner2

software.

4.2 Feature Extraction

After the preprocessing step, we extract a vector
consisting of the top uni-grams present in the train-
ing set and represent individual messages in terms
of this vector. For each message we also compute
the frequency of smileys and words with prior sen-
timent polarity using a sentiment lexicon. Finally,
we include the harmonic mean of positive and neg-
ative words. Next we explain each feature in more
detail.

Word vector: a sparse word vector containing
the top 25.000 most frequent words that occur in
the training set. This feature aims at capturing re-
lations between certain words and overall message
polarity. The vector was extracted using the Weka
toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) with the stop word list
option.

Lexicon word count: positive and negative sen-
timent word counts. When the word is preceded by
a negation particle we invert the polarity. We used
Bing Liu’s Opinion Lexicon3 that includes 2006
positive and 4783 negative words and is especially
tailored for social media because it considers mis-
spellings, slang and other domain specific varia-
tions.

Smileys count: a count of positive and negative
smileys that appear in the tweet. We take advan-
tage of these constructs being especially indicative
of the overall expressed sentiment in a text (Davi-
dov et al., 2010). Although there are smiley lexi-
cons, such as the one used on SentiStrength4, we
used regular expressions to capture most common

sentiment-analysis.html

smileys in a flexible way.
Hashtag count: a count of positive and negative

hashtags. This feature also uses Bing Liu’s lexicon
to determine wether a word contained in an hash-
tag is positive or negative. The rationale behind
this feature is that positive or negative words in the
form of hashtags can have a stronger meaning than
regular words (Davidov et al., 2010).

Positive/negative harmonic mean: harmonic
mean between positive and negative token counts,
including words and hashtags.

In an attempt to further reduce the dimensional-
ity of the feature space we computed the principal
components of the word vector using the Principal
Components Analysis filter in Weka but observed
that this yielded worse results.

4.3 Learning the classifier
To implement our classifier we used the Weka ma-
chine learning framework and experimented with
two ensemble algorithms: Random Forests and
BESTrees. We eventually dropped the use of BE-
STrees as initial results were worse.

We attempted to use most of the data while be-
ing able to effectively measure the performance of
the classifier. Therefore we used the totality of
both sets for training and evaluated using 10 fold
cross-validation.

Since we used only the annotated dataset that
was provided for this task, our approach is consid-
ered constrained.

5 Results

Our results with 10 fold cross-validation using the
submitted classifier, are presented in Table 3.

Class Precision Recall F-score
positive 61.0% 63.9% 62.4%
negative 54.1% 26.8% 35.8%
neutral 64.7% 72.4% 68.3%
average F-score (pos/neg) 49.1%

Task evaluation results are presented in Table 4
for tweets. Our approach ranked 44th out of 48
participants. The evaluation dataset had a sim-
ilar class distribution to the annotated datasets,

with almost half being neutral, and just 14% neg-
ative. Preliminary results with cross-validation
were similar to those of the final evaluation for
Twitter.

Class Precision Recall F-score
positive 62.52% 55.28% 58.68%
negative 55.74% 21.80% 31.34%
neutral 56.54% 75.43% 64.63%
average F-score (pos/neg) 45.01%

Table 4: Task evaluation results for Tweets.

Also included in SemEval-2013 Task 2 was an
evaluation using a SMS dataset to understand if a
classifier trained using tweets could be applied to
SMS messages. SMS results are shown in Table 5.
In this case our approach ranked 23th out of 42 par-
ticipants. The SMS evaluation dataset was com-
posed of more than half neutral messages (58%),
and similarly distributed positives (23%) and neg-
atives (19%).

Class Precision Recall F-score
positive 53.66% 59.50% 56.45%
negative 60.54% 34.26% 43.76%
neutral 72.91% 79.90% 76.27%
average F-score (pos/neg) 50.11%

6 Discussion and Conclusions

As expected, our naive approach performs poorly
in the context of Twitter messages. The obtained
results are in line with similar approaches de-
scribed in the literature and we found that Ran-
dom Forests achieve the same performance as
other learning algorithms tried for the same task
(Koulompis et al., 2011).

The uneven distribution of classes in the data
may have also contributed to the low performance
of the classifier. Although the neutral class was
not considered in the evaluation, the datasets had
a great predominance of neutral messages whereas
the negative examples only accounted for 15% of
the corpus. This suggests that it could be useful to
use a minority class over-sampling method, such

as SMOTE (Chawla, 2002), to reduce the effect
of this imbalance on the data. We used n-grams
to model the words that compose each message.
However, this approach leads to very sparse rep-
resentations, thus becoming important to consider
techniques that reduce feature space. We experi-
mented with PCA, without success, but we still be-
lieve that applying feature selection algorithms or
denser word representations (Turian et al., 2010)
could improve performance in this task.

We find that our classifier performs better on the
SMS dataset. This might be explained by the fact
that SMS messages tend to be more direct, whereas
the same tweet can express, or show signs of, con-
tradictory sentiments. In fact, our naive approach
outperforms other systems that had better results
in the Twitter dataset, but it is difficult to say why,
given that we do not have access to the SMS test
set annotations.

Despite the poor ranking results, we achieved
our goal of performing basic experiments in the
task of sentiment analysis in Twitter and developed
a baseline system that will serve as a starting point
for future research.
