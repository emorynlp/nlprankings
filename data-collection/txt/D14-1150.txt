Abstract

Given the large amounts of online textual
documents available these days, e.g., news
articles, weblogs, and scientific papers, ef-
fective methods for extracting keyphrases,
which provide a high-level topic descrip-
tion of a document, are greatly needed. In
this paper, we propose a supervised model
for keyphrase extraction from research pa-
pers, which are embedded in citation net-
works. To this end, we design novel fea-
tures based on citation network informa-
tion and use them in conjunction with tra-
ditional features for keyphrase extraction
to obtain remarkable improvements in per-
formance over strong baselines.

1 Introduction

Keyphrase extraction is the problem of automat-
ically extracting important phrases or concepts
(i.e., the essence) of a document. Keyphrases
provide a high-level topic description of a docu-
ment and are shown to be rich sources of informa-
tion for many applications such as document clas-
sification, clustering, recommendation, indexing,
searching, and summarization (Jones and Stave-
ley, 1999; Zha, 2002; Hammouda et al., 2005;
Pudota et al., 2010; Turney, 2003). Despite the
fact that keyphrase extraction has been widely re-
searched in the natural language processing com-
munity, its performance is still far from being sat-
isfactory (Hasan and Ng, 2014).

Many previous approaches to keyphrase extrac-
tion generally used only the textual content of
a target document to extract keyphrases (Hulth,
2003; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Liu et al., 2010).
Recently, Wan and Xiao (2008) proposed a model
that incorporates a local neighborhood of a doc-
ument. However, their neighborhood is limited
to textually-similar documents, where the cosine

similarity between the tf-idf vectors of documents
is used to compute their similarity. We posit
that, in addition to a document’s textual content
and textually-similar neighbors, other informative
neighborhoods exist that have the potential to im-
prove keyphrase extraction. For example, in a
scholarly domain, research papers are not isolated.
Rather, they are highly inter-connected in giant ci-
tation networks, in which papers cite or are cited
by other papers. In a citation network, information
flows from one paper to another via the citation re-
lation (Shi et al., 2010). This information flow and
the influence of one paper on another are specifi-
cally captured by means of citation contexts, i.e.,
short text segments surrounding a citation’s men-
tion. These contexts are not arbitrary, but they
serve as brief summaries of a cited paper. Figure
1 illustrates this idea using a small citation net-
work of a paper by Rendle et al. (2010) that cites
(Zimdars et al., 2001), (Hu et al., 2008), (Pan and
Scholz, 2009) and (Shani et al., 2005) and is cited
by (Cheng et al., 2013). The citation mentions
and citation contexts are shown with a dashed line.
Note the high overlap between the words in con-
texts and those in the title and abstract (shown in
bold) and the author-annotated keywords.

One question that can be raised is the following:
Can we effectively exploit information available
in large inter-linked document networks in order
to improve the performance of keyphrase extrac-
tion? The research that we describe in this paper
addresses specifically this question using citation
networks of research papers as a case study. Ex-
tracting keyphrases that can accurately “represent”
research papers is crucial to dealing with the large
numbers of research papers published during these
“big data” times. The importance of keyphrase ex-
traction from research papers is also emphasized
by the recent SemEval 2010 Shared Task on this
topic (Kim et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013).

Our contributions. We present a supervised

approach to keyphrase extraction from research
papers that, in addition to the information con-
tained in a paper itself, effectively incorporates,
in the learned models, information from the pa-
per’s local neighborhood available in citation net-
works. To this end, we design novel features for
keyphrase extraction based on citation context in-
formation and use them in conjunction with tradi-
tional features in a supervised probabilistic frame-
work. We show empirically that the proposed
models substantially outperform strong baselines
on two datasets of research papers compiled from
two machine learning conferences: the World
Wide Web and Knowledge Discovery from Data.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
We summarize closely related work in Section 2.
The supervised classification for keyphrase extrac-
tion is discussed in Section 3. Experiments and re-
sults are presented in Section 4, followed by con-
clusions and future directions of our work.

2 Related Work

Many approaches to keyphrase extraction have
been proposed in the literature along two lines of
research: supervised and unsupervised, using dif-
ferent types of documents including scientific ab-
stracts, newswire documents, meeting transcripts,
and webpages (Frank et al., 1999; Hulth, 2003;
Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Liu et al., 2009; Marujo
et al., 2013; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

In the supervised line of research, keyphrase
extraction is formulated as a binary classification
problem, where candidate phrases are classified as

either positive (i.e., keyphrases) or negative (i.e.,
non-keyphrases) (Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2000;
Hulth, 2003). Different feature sets and classifica-
tion algorithms gave rise to different models. For
example, Hulth (2003) used four different features
in conjunction with a bagging technique. These
features are: term frequency, collection frequency,
the relative position of the first occurrence and the
part-of-speech tag of a term. Frank et al. (1999)
developed a system called KEA that used only
two features: tf-idf (term frequency-inverse doc-
ument frequency) of a phrase and the distance of
a phrase from the beginning of a document (i.e.,
its relative position) and used them as input to
Naı̈ve Bayes. Nguyen and Kan (2007) extended
KEA to include features such as the distribution
of keyphrases among different sections of a re-
search paper, and the acronym status of a term. In
contrast to these works, we propose novel features
extracted from the local neighborhoods of docu-
ments available in interlinked document networks.
Medelyan et al. (2009) extended KEA as well to
integrate information from Wikipedia. In contrast,
we used only information intrinsic to our data. En-
hancing our models with Wikipedia information
would be an interesting future direction to pursue.

In the unsupervised line of research, keyphrase
extraction is formulated as a ranking problem,
where keyphrases are ranked using their tf (Barker
and Cornacchia, 2000), tf-idf (Zhang et al., 2007;
Lee and Kim, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Tonella et al.,
2003), and term informativeness (Wu and Giles,
2013; Rennie and Jaakkola, 2005; Kireyev, 2009)
(among others). The ranking based on tf-idf has

1436



been shown to work well in practice (Liu et al.,
2009; Hasan and Ng, 2010) despite its simplicity.
Frantzi et al. (1998) combined linguistics and sta-
tistical information to extract technical terms from
documents in digital libraries. Graph-based al-
gorithms and centrality measures are also widely
used in unsupervised models. A word graph is
built for each document such that nodes corre-
spond to words and edges correspond to word as-
sociation patterns. Nodes are then ranked using
graph centrality measures such as PageRank and
its variants (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan and
Xiao, 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011),
HITS scores (Litvak and Last, 2008), as well as
node degree and betweenness (Boudin, 2013; Xie,
2005). Wan and Xiao (2008) were the first to
consider modeling a local neighborhood of a tar-
get document in addition to the document itself,
and applied this approach to news articles on the
Web. Their local neighborhood consists of textu-
ally similar documents, and did not capture infor-
mation contained in document networks.

Using terms from citation contexts of scientific
papers is not a new idea. It was used before in
various applications. For example, Ritchie et al.
(2006) used a combination of terms from citation
contexts and existing index terms of a paper to
improve indexing of cited papers. Citation con-
texts were also used to improve the performance of
citation recommendation systems (Kataria et al.,
2010; He et al., 2010) and to study author influ-
ence (Kataria et al., 2011). This idea of using
terms from citation contexts resembles the anal-
ysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the
Web, which are instrumental in Web search (Man-
ning et al., 2008). Many current Web search en-
gines build on the intuition that the anchor text
pointing to a page is a good descriptor of its con-
tent, and thus use anchor text terms as additional
index terms for a target webpage. The use of links
and anchor text was thoroughly researched for IR
tasks (Koolen and Kamps, 2010), broadening a
user’s search (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), query re-
finement (Kraft and Zien, 2004), and enriching
document representations (Metzler et al., 2009).

Moreover, citation contexts were used for scien-
tific paper summarization (Abu-Jbara and Radev,
2011; Qazvinian et al., 2010; Qazvinian and
Radev, 2008; Mei and Zhai, 2008; Lehnert et al.,
1990; Nakov et al., 2004). Among these, proba-
bly the most similar to our work is the work by
Qazvinian et al. (2010), where a set of important

keyphrases is extracted first from the citation con-
texts in which the paper to be summarized is cited
by other papers and then the “best” subset of sen-
tences that contain such keyphrases is returned as
the summary. However, keyphrases in (Qazvinian
et al., 2010) are extracted using frequent n-grams
in a language model framework, whereas in our
work, we propose a supervised approach to a dif-
ferent task: keyphrase extraction. Mei and Zhai
(2008) used information from citation contexts to
determine what sentences of a paper are of high
impact (as measured by the influence of a target
paper on further studies of similar or related top-
ics). These sentences constitute the impact-based
summary of the paper.

Despite the use of citation contexts and anchor
text in many IR and NLP tasks, to our knowl-
edge, we are the first to propose the incorporation
of information available in citation networks for
keyphrase extraction. In our recent work (Gol-
lapalli and Caragea, 2014), we designed a fully
unsupervised graph-based algorithm that incorpo-
rates evidence from multiple sources (citation con-
texts as well as document content) in a flexible
manner to score keywords. In the current work,
we present a supervised approach to keyphrase ex-
traction from research papers that are embedded in
large citation networks, and propose novel features
that show improvement over strong supervised and
unsupervised baselines. To our knowledge, fea-
tures extracted from citation contexts have not
been used before for keyphrase extraction in a su-
pervised learning framework.

3 Problem Characterization

In citation networks, in addition to the informa-
tion contained in a paper itself, citing and cited
papers capture different aspects (e.g., topicality,
domain of study, algorithms used) about the tar-
get paper (Teufel et al., 2006), with citation con-
texts playing an instrumental role. A citation con-
text is defined as a window of n words surround-
ing a citation mention. We conjecture that cita-
tion contexts, which act as brief summaries about a
cited paper, provide additional clues in extracting
keyphrases for a target paper. These clues give rise
to the unique design of our model, called citation-
enhanced keyphrase extraction (CeKE).

cation model, built on a combination of novel fea-
tures that capture information from citation con-
texts and existing features from previous works.
The features are described in §3.1.1. CeKE classi-
fies candidate phrases as keyphrases (i.e., positive)
or non-keyphrases (i.e., negative) using Naı̈ve
Bayes classifiers. Positive examples for train-
ing correspond to manually annotated keyphrases
from the training research papers, whereas nega-
tive examples correspond to the remaining candi-
date phrases from these papers. The generation of
candidate phrases is explained in §3.2.

Note that Naı̈ve Bayes classifies a phrase as a
keyphrase if the probability of the phrase belong-
ing to the positive class is greater than 0.5. How-
ever, the default threshold of 0.5 can be varied to
allow only high-confidence (e.g., 0.9 confidence)
phrases to be classified as keyphrases.
3.1.1 Features
We consider the following features in our model,
which are shown in Table 1. They are divided
into three categories: (1) Existing features for
keyphrase extraction include: tf-idf, i.e., the term
frequency - inverse document frequency of a can-
didate phrase, computed for each target paper;

This feature was used in KEA (Frank et al., 1999);
relative position, i.e., the position of the first oc-
currence of a phrase normalized by the length (in
the number of tokens) of the target paper; POS,
i.e., a phrase’s part-of-speech tag. If a phrase is
composed by more than one term, then the POS
will contain the tags of all terms. The relative posi-
tion was used in both KEA and Hulth (2003), and
POS was used in Hulth; (2) Novel features - Cita-
tion Network Based include: inCited and inCiting,
i.e., boolean features that are true if the candidate
phrase occurs in cited and citing contexts, respec-
tively. We differentiate between cited and citing
contexts for a paper: let d be a target paper and C
be a citation network such that d ∈ C. A cited con-
text for d is a context in which d is cited by some
paper di in C. A citing context for d is a context
in which d is citing some paper dj in C. If a paper
is cited in multiple contexts by another paper, the
contexts are aggregated into a single one; citation
tf-idf, i.e., the tf-idf score of each phrase computed
from the citation contexts; (3) Novel features - Ex-
tend Other Existing Features include: first position
of a candidate phrase, i.e., the distance of the first
occurrence of a phrase from the beginning of a pa-
per; this is similar to relative position except that
it does not consider the length of a paper; tf-idf-
Over, i.e., a boolean feature, which is true if the
tf-idf of a candidate phrase is greater than a thresh-
old θ, and firstPosUnder, also a boolean feature,
which is true if the distance of the first occurrence
of a phrase from the beginning of a target paper is
below some value β. This feature is similar to the
feature is-in-title, used previously in the literature
(Litvak and Last, 2008; Jiang et al., 2009). Both
tf-idf and citation tf-idf features showed better re-
sults when each tf was divided by the maximum tf
values from the target paper or citation contexts.

The tf-idf features have high values for phrases
that are frequent in a paper or citation contexts,
but are less frequent in collection and have low
values for phrases with high collection frequency.
We computed the idf component from each col-
lection used in experiments. Phrases that occur in
cited and citing contexts as well as early in a paper
are likely to be keyphrases since: (1) they capture
some aspect about the target paper and (2) authors
start to describe their problem upfront.

3.2 Generating Candidate Phrases

We generate candidate phrases from the textual
content of a target paper by applying parts-of-

speech filters. Consistent with previous works
(Hulth, 2003; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Liu
et al., 2010; Wan and Xiao, 2008), only nouns
and adjectives are retained to form candidate
phrases. The generation process consists of two
steps. First, using the NLP Stanford part of speech
tagger, we preprocess each document and keep
only the nouns and adjectives corresponding to
{NN,NNS,NNP,NNPS, JJ}. We apply the
Porter stemmer on every word. The position of
each word is kept consistent with the initial state
of the document before any word removal is made.

Second, words extracted in the first step that
have contiguous positions in a document are con-
catenated into n-grams. We used unigrams, bi-
grams, and trigrams (n = 1, 2, 3) as candidate
phrases for classification. Similar to Wan and Xiao
(2008), we eliminated phrases that end with an ad-
jective and the unigrams that are adjectives.

4 Experiments and Results

In this section, we first describe our datasets and
then present experimental design and results.

4.1 Datasets
In order to test the performance of our proposed
approach, we built our own datasets since citation-
enhanced evaluation benchmarks are not available
for keyphrase extraction tasks. In particular, we
compiled two datasets consisting of research pa-
pers from two top-tier machine learning confer-
ences: World Wide Web (WWW) and Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). Our choice
for WWW and KDD was motivated by the avail-
ability of author-input keywords for each paper,
which we used as gold-standard for evaluation.

Using the CiteSeerx digital library1, we re-
trieved the papers published in WWW and KDD
(available in CiteSeerx), and their citation network
information, i.e., their cited and citing contexts.
Since our goal is to study the impact of citation
network information on extracting keyphrases, a
paper was considered for analysis if it had at least

1http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/

one cited and one citing context. For each paper,
we used: the title and abstract (referred to as the
target paper) and its citation contexts. The rea-
son for not considering the entire text of a paper
is that scientific papers contain details, e.g., dis-
cussion of results, experimental design, notation,
that do not provide additional benefits for extract-
ing keyphrases. Hence, similar to (Hulth, 2003;
Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Liu et al., 2009), we
did not use the entire text of a paper. However, ex-
tracting keyphrases from sections such as “intro-
duction” or “conclusion” needs further attention.

From the pdf of each paper, we extracted the
author-input keyphrases. An analysis of these
keyphrases revealed that generally authors de-
scribe their work using, almost half of the time,
bigrams, followed by unigrams and only rarely us-
ing trigrams (or higher n-grams). A summary of
our datasets that contains the number of papers,
the average number of cited and citing contexts
per paper, the average number of keyphrases per
paper, and the number of unigrams, bigrams and
trigrams, in each collection, is shown in Table 2.

Consistent with previous works (Frank et al.,
1999; Hulth, 2003), the positive and negative ex-
amples in our datasets correspond to candidate
phrases that consist of up to three tokens. The
positive examples are candidate phrases that have
a match in the author-input keyphrases, whereas
negative examples correspond to the remaining
candidate phrases.

Context lengths. In CiteSeerx, citation con-
texts have about 50 words on each side of a citation
mention. A previous study by Ritchie et al. (2008)
shows that a fixed window length of about 100
words around a citation mention is generally effec-
tive for information retrieval tasks. For this reason,
we used the contexts provided by CiteSeerx di-
rectly. However, in future, it would be interesting
to incorporate in our models more sophisticated
approaches to identifying the text that is relevant
to a target citation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012;
Teufel, 1999) and study the influence of context
lengths on the quality of extracted keyphrase.

Table 3: The comparison of CeKE with supervised approaches on WWW and KDD collections.

4.2 Experimental Design
Our experiments are designed around the follow-
ing research questions:

1. How does the performance of citation-
enhanced keyphrase extraction (CeKE) com-
pare with the performance of existing super-
vised models that use only information intrin-
sic to the data and what are the most informa-
tive features for classification? We compared
CeKE’s performance with that of classifiers
trained on KEA features only and Hulth’s
features only and present a ranking of fea-
tures based on information gain.

2. How do supervised models that integrate ci-
tation network information compare with re-
cent unsupervised models? Since recent un-
supervised approaches are becoming compet-
itive with supervised approaches (Hasan and
Ng, 2014), we also compared CeKE with
unsupervised ranking of candidate phrases
by TF-IDF, TextRank (Mihalcea and Ta-
rau, 2004) and ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao,
2008). For unsupervised, we considered top
5 and top 10 ranked phrases when computing
“@5” and “@10” measures.

3. How well does our proposed model perform
in the absence of either cited or citing con-
texts? Since newly published scientific pa-
pers are not cited by many other papers, e.g.,
due to their recency, no cited contexts are
available. We studied the quality of predicted
keyphrases when either cited or citing con-
texts are missing. For this, we compared
the performance of models trained using both
cited and citing contexts with that of models
that use either cited or citing contexts.

Evaluation metrics. To evaluate the perfor-
mance of CeKE, we used the following metrics:
precision, recall and F1-score for the positive class
since correct identification of keyphrases is of
most interest. These metrics were widely used in

previous works (Hulth, 2003; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008; Hasan and Ng, 2010).
The reported values are averaged in 10-fold cross-
validation experiments, where folds were created
at document level and candidate phrases were ex-
tracted from the documents in each fold to form
the training and test sets. In all experiments, we
used Naı̈ve Bayes and their Weka implementa-
tion2. However, any probabilistic classifier that re-
turns a posterior probability of the class given an
example, can be used with our features.

The θ parameter was set to the (title and ab-
stract) tf-idf averaged over the entire collection,
while β was set to 20. These values were esti-
mated on a validation set sampled from training.

4.3 Results and Discussion

The impact of citation network information on the
keyphrase extraction task. Table 3 shows the re-
sults of the comparison of CeKE with two su-
pervised approaches, KEA and Hulth’s approach.
The features used in KEA are the tf-idf and the
relative position of a candidate phrase, whereas
those used in Hulth’s approach are tf, cf (i.e., col-
lection frequency), relative position and POS tags.
CeKE is trained using all features from Table 1.
Among the three methods for candidate phrase
formation proposed in Hulth (2003), i.e., n-grams,
NP-chunks, and POS Tag Patterns, our Hulth’s im-
plementation is based on n-grams since this gives
the best results among all methods (see (Hulth,
2003) for more details). In addition, the n-grams
method is the most similar to our candidate phrase
generation and that used in Frank et al. (1999).

As can be seen from Table 3, CeKE outperforms
KEA and Hulth’s approach in terms of all perfor-
mance measures on both WWW and KDD, with
a substantial improvement in recall over both ap-
proaches. For example, on WWW, CeKE achieves
a recall of 0.386 compared to 0.146 and 0.107 re-
call achieved by KEA and Hulth’s, respectively.

Although there are only small variations from
KEA to Hulth’s approach, KEA performs better
on WWW, but worse on KDD compared with
Hulth’s approach. In contrast, CeKE shows con-
sistent improvement over the two approaches on
both datasets, hence, effectively making use of the
information available in the citation network.

In order to understand the importance of our
features, we ranked them based on Information
Gain (IG), which determines how informative a
feature is with respect to the class variable. Table
4 shows the features ranked in decreasing order of
their IG scores for WWW. As can be seen from
the table, tf-idf and citation tf-idf are both highly
ranked, first and third, respectively, illustrating
that they contain significant information in pre-
dicting keyphrases. The first position of a phrase
is also of great impact. This is consistent with the
fact that almost half of the identified keywords and

about 20% of the annotated keyphrases appear in
title. Similar ranking is obtained on KDD.

The comparison of CeKE with unsupervised
state-of-the-art models. Table 5 shows the re-
sults of the comparison of CeKE with three unsu-
pervised ranking approaches: TF-IDF (Tonella et
al., 2003), TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),
and ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008). TF-IDF
and TextRank use information only from the target
paper, whereas ExpandRank uses a small textual
neighborhood in addition to the target paper. Note
that, for all unsupervised methods, we used Porter
stemmer and the same candidate phrase generation
as in CeKE, as explained in §3.2.

For TF-IDF, we first tokenized the target paper
and computed the score for each word, and then
formed phrases and summed up the score of every
word within a phrase. For TextRank, we built an
undirected graph for each paper, where the nodes
correspond to words in the target paper and edges
are drawn between two words that occur next to
each other in the text, i.e., the window size is 2.
For ExpandRank, we built an undirected graph
for each paper and its local textual neighborhood.
Again, nodes correspond to words in the target pa-
per and its textually similar papers and edges are
drawn between two words that occur within a win-
dow of 10 words from each other in the text, i.e.,
the window size is 10. We performed experiments
with 1, 5, and 10 textually-similar neighbors. For
TextRank and ExpandRank, we summed up the
scores of words within a phrase as in TF-IDF.

Table 6: Results of CeKE using both contexts and using with only cited or citing contexts.

For each unsupervised method, we computed
results for top 5 and top 10 ranked phrases. As
can be seen from Table 5, CeKE substantially out-
performs all the other methods for our domain of
study, i.e., papers from WWW and KDD, illustrat-
ing again that the citation network of a paper con-
tains important information that can show remark-
able benefits for keyphrase extraction. Among all
unsupervised methods, ExpandRank with fewer
textual similar neighbor (one or five) performs the
best. This is generally consistent with the results
shown in (Wan and Xiao, 2008) for news articles.

The effect of cited and citing contexts informa-
tion on models’ performance. Table 6 shows the
precision, recall and F-score values for some vari-
ations of our method when: (1) all the citation con-
texts for a paper are used, (2) only cited contexts
are used, (3) only citing contexts are used. The
motivation behind this experiment was to deter-
mine how well the proposed model would perform
on newly published research papers that have not
accumulated citations yet. As shown in the table,
there is no substantial difference in terms of preci-
sion between CeKE models that use only cited or
only citing contexts, although the recall is substan-
tially higher for the case when only citing contexts
are used, for both WWW and KDD. The CeKE
that uses both citing and cited contexts achieves
a substantially higher recall and only a slightly
higher precision compared with the cases when
only one context type is available. The fact that
the citing context information provides a slight im-
provement in performance over cited contexts is
consistent with the intuition that when citing a pa-
per y, an author generally summarizes the main
ideas from y using important words from a target
paper x, making the citing contexts to have higher
overlap with words from x. In turn, a paper z that
cites x may use paraphrasing to summarize ideas
from x with words more similar to those from z.

Note that the results of all above experiments
are statistically significant at p-values ≥ 0.05, us-
ing a paired t-test on F1-scores.

4.4 Anecdotal Evidence

In order to check the transferability of our pro-
posed approach to other research fields, e.g., nat-
ural language processing, it would be interesting
to use our trained classifiers on WWW and KDD
collections and evaluate them on new collections
such as NLP related collections. Since NLP col-
lections annotated with keyphrases are not avail-
able, we show anecdotal evidence for only one pa-
per. We selected for this task an award winning pa-
per published in the EMNLP conference. The pa-
per’s title is ”Unsupervised semantic parsing” and
has won the Best Paper Award in the year 2009
(Poon and Domingos, 2009). In order for our al-
gorithm to work, we gathered from the Web (using
Google Scholar) all the cited and citing contexts
that were available (49 cited contexts and 30 cit-
ing contexts). We manually annotated the target
paper with keyphrases. The title, abstract and all
the contexts were POS tagged using the NLP Stan-
ford tool. We then trained a classifier on the fea-
tures shown in Table 1, on both WWW and KDD
datasets combined. The trained classifier was used
to make predictions, which were compared against
the manually annotated keyphrases. The results
are shown in Figure 2, which displays the title and
abstract of the paper and the predicted keyphrases.
Candidate phrases that are predicted as keyphrases
are marked in red bold, those predicted as non-
keyphrases are shown in black, while the filtered
out words are shown in light gray.

We tuned our classifier trained on WWW and
KDD to return as keyphrases only those that had
an extremely high probability to be keyphrases.
Specifically, we used a threshold of 0.985. The
probability of each returned keyphrase (which is
above 0.985) is shown in the upper right corner
of a keyphrase. Human annotated keyphrases are
marked in italic, under the figure. There is a clear
match between the predictions and the human an-
notations. It is also possible to extract more or
less keyphrases simply by adjusting the threshold

Unsupervised Semantic Parsing0.997

We present the first unsupervised approach to the problem of learning a semantic parser1.000, using
Markov logic0.991 . Our USP system0.985 transforms dependency trees into quasi-logical forms, recur-
sively induces lambda forms from these, and clusters them to abstract away syntactic variations of the
same meaning. The MAP semantic parse1.000 of a sentence is obtained by recursively assigning its
parts to lambda-form clusters and composing them. We evaluate our approach by using it to extract a
knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. USP1.000 substantially outperforms
TextRunner, DIRT and an informed baseline on both precision and recall on this task.

Human annotated labels: unsupervised semantic parsing, Markov logic, USP system

Figure 2: The title and abstract of an EMNLP paper by Poon and Domingos (2009) and human annotated
keyphrases for the paper. Black words represent candidate phrases. Red bold words represent predicted
keyphrases. The numbers above predicted keyphrases are probabilities for the positive class assignment.

on the probability output by Naı̈ve Bayes. For ex-
ample, if we decrease the threshold to 0.920 the
following phrases would be added to the returned
set of keyphrases: dependency trees, quasi-logical
forms and unsupervised approach.

Another interesting aspect is the frequency of
occurrence of the predicted keyphrases in the cited
and citing contexts. Table 7 shows the term-
frequency of every predicted keyphrase within the
citation network. For example, the phrase seman-
tic parser appears in 29 cited contexts and 26 cit-
ing contexts. The reason for the higher cited con-
text frequency is not necessarily due to impor-
tance, but could be due to the larger number of
cited vs. citing contexts for this paper (49 vs. 30).
The high rate of keyphrases within the citation net-
work validates our assumption of the importance
of citation networks for keyphrase extraction.

Finally, we performed the same experiment
with Hulth’s and KEA methods. While the clas-
sifier trained on Hulth’s features did not identify
any keyphrases, KEA managed to identify several
good ones (e.g., USP, semantic parser), but left
out some important ones (e.g., Markov logic, un-
supervised). Moreover, the keyphrases predicted
by KEA have a lower confidence. For this reason,
lowering the probability threshold would result in
selecting other bad keyphrases.

4.5 Error analysis

We performed an error analysis and found that
candidate phrases are predicted as keyphrases
(FPs), although they do not appear in gold stan-
dard, i.e., the set of author-input keyphrases, in
cases when: 1) a more general terms is used to
describe an important concept of a document, e.g.,

Keyphrase #cited c. #citing c.
semantic parser 29 26
USP 31 10
Markov logic 15 10
unsupervised semantic parsing 12 1
USP system 3 2

Table 7: Frequency of the predicted keyphrases in
cited / citing contexts.

co-authorship prediction represented as link pre-
diction or Twitter platform represented as social
media; 2) an important concept is omitted (either
intentionally or forgetfully) from the set of author-
input keyphrases.

Hence, while we believe that authors are the
best keyphrase annotators for their own work,
there are cases when important keyphrases are
overlooked or expressed in different ways, possi-
bly due to the human subjective nature in choosing
important keyphrases that describe a document.
To this end, a limitation of our model is the use of
a single gold standard keyphrase annotation. In fu-
ture, we plan to acquire several human keyphrase
annotation sets for our datasets and test the perfor-
mance of the proposed approach on these annota-
tion sets, independently and in combination.

Keyphrases that appear in gold standard are
predicted as non-keyphrases (FNs) when: 1) a
keyphrase is infrequent in abstract; 2) its distance
from the beginning of a document is large; 3) does
not occur or occurs only rarely in a document’s
citation contexts, either citing or cited contexts.
Examples of FNs are model/algorithm/approach
names, e.g., random walks, that appear in sen-
tences such as: “In this paper, we model the prob-
lem [· · ·] by using random walks.” Although such

1443



a sentence may appear further away from the be-
ginning of an abstract, it contains significant in-
formation from the point of view of keyphrase
extraction. The design of patters such as <
by using $model > or < uses $model > could
lead to improved classification performance.

Further investigation of FPs and FNs will be
considered in future work. We believe that a bet-
ter understanding of errors has the potential to ad-
vance state-of-the-art for keyphrase extraction.

5 Conclusion and Future Directions
In this paper, we presented a supervised classifi-
cation model for keyphrase extraction from scien-
tific research papers that are embedded in citation
networks. More precisely, we designed novel fea-
tures that take into account citation network in-
formation for building supervised models for the
classification of candidate phrases as keyphrases
or non-keyphrases. The results of our experi-
ments show that the proposed supervised model
trained on a combination of citation-based features
and existing features for keyphrase extraction per-
forms substantially better compared with state-of-
the-art supervised and unsupervised models.

Although we illustrated the benefits of leverag-
ing inter-linked document networks for keyphrase
extraction from scientific documents, the proposed
model can be extended to other types of docu-
ments such as webpages, emails, and weblogs. For
example, the anchor text on hyperlinks in weblogs
can be seen as the “citation context”.

Another aspect of future work would be the
use of external sources to better identify candi-
date phrases. For example, the use of Wikipedia
was studied before to check if the concept behind
a phrase has its own Wikipedia page (Medelyan
et al., 2009). Furthermore, since citations occur
in all sciences, extensions of the proposed model
to other domains, e.g., Biology and Chemistry,
and other applications, e.g., document summariza-
tion, similar to Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) and
Qazvinian et al. (2010), are of particular interest.
