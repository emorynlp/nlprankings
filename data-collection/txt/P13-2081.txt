Abstract
This paper introduces a supervised ap-
proach for performing sentence level di-
alect identification between Modern Stan-
dard Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Ara-
bic. We use token level labels to de-
rive sentence-level features. These fea-
tures are then used with other core and
meta features to train a generative clas-
sifier that predicts the correct label for
each sentence in the given input text. The
system achieves an accuracy of 85.5%
on an Arabic online-commentary dataset
outperforming a previously proposed ap-
proach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a
significant gain over a majority baseline of
51.9% and two strong baseline systems of
78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.

1 Introduction

The Arabic language exists in a state of Diglos-
sia (Ferguson, 1959) where the standard form of
the language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and
the regional dialects (DA) live side-by-side and
are closely related. MSA is the language used
in education, scripted speech and official settings
while DA is the native tongue of Arabic speak-
ers. Arabic dialects may be divided into five
main groups: Egyptian (including Libyan and Su-
danese), Levantine (including Lebanese, Syrian,
Palestinian and Jordanian), Gulf, Iraqi and Mo-
roccan (Maghrebi) (Habash, 2010). Even though
these dialects did not originally exist in a written
form, they are pervasively present in social me-
dia text (normally mixed with MSA) nowadays.
DA does not have a standard orthography leading
to many spelling variations and inconsistencies.
Linguistic Code switching (LCS) between MSA
and DA happens both intra-sententially and inter-
sententially. LCS in Arabic poses a serious chal-
lenge for almost all NLP tasks since MSA and DA

differ on all levels of linguistic representation. For
example, MSA trained tools perform very badly
when applied directly to DA or to a code-switched
DA-MSA text. Hence a need for a robust dialect
identification tool as a preprocessing step arises
both on the word and sentence levels.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of dialect
identification on the sentence level. We propose
a supervised approach for identifying whether a
given sentence is prevalently MSA or Egyptian
DA (EDA). The system uses the approach that was
presented in (Elfardy et al., 2013) to perform token
dialect identification. The token level decisions
are then combined with other features to train a
generative classifier that tries to predict the class
of the given sentence. The presented system out-
performs the approach presented by Zaidan and
Callison-Burch (2011) on the same dataset using
10-fold cross validation.

2 Related Work

Dialect Identification in Arabic is crucial for al-
most all NLP tasks, yet most of the research in
Arabic NLP, with few exceptions, is targeted to-
wards MSA. Biadsy et al. (2009) present a sys-
tem that identifies dialectal words in speech and
their dialect of origin through the acoustic signals.
Salloum and Habash (2011) tackle the problem of
DA to English Machine Translation (MT) by piv-
oting through MSA. The authors present a system
that applies transfer rules from DA to MSA then
uses state of the art MSA to English MT system.
Habash et al. (2012) present CODA, a Conven-
tional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic that aims
to standardize the orthography of all the variants
of DA while Dasigi and Diab (2011) present an
unsupervised clustering approach to identify or-
thographic variants in DA. Zaidan and Callison-
Burch (2011) crawl a large dataset of MSA-DA
news’ commentaries. The authors annotate part
of the dataset for sentence-level dialectalness on

Amazon Mechanical Turk and try a language mod-
eling (LM) approach to solve the problem. In
Elfardy and Diab (2012a), we present a set of
guidelines for token-level identification of dialec-
talness while in (Elfardy and Diab, 2012b), (El-
fardy et al., 2013) we tackle the problem of token-
level dialect-identification by casting it as a code-
switching problem.

3 Approach to Sentence-Level Dialect
Identification

We present a supervised system that uses a Naive
Bayes classifier trained on gold labeled data with
sentence level binary decisions of either being
MSA or DA.

3.1 Features
The proposed supervised system uses two kinds of
features: (1) Core Features, and (2) Meta Features.

3.1.1 Core Features:
These features indicate how dialectal (or non di-
alectal) a given sentence is. They are further
divided into: (a) Token-based features and (b)
Perplexity-based features.
3.1.1.1 Token-based Features: We use the
approach that was presented in (Elfardy et al.,
2013) to decide upon the class of each word in
the given sentence. The aforementioned approach
relies on language models (LM) and MSA and
EDA Morphological Analyzer to decide whether
each word is (a) MSA, (b) EDA, (c) Both (MSA
& EDA) or (d) OOV. We use the token-level class
labels to estimate the percentage of EDA words
and the percentage of OOVs for each sentence.
These percentages are then used as features for
the proposed model. The following variants of the
underlying token-level system are built to assess
the effect of varying the level of preprocessing
on the underlying LM on the performance of the
overall sentence level dialect identification pro-
cess: (1) Surface, (2) Tokenized, (3) CODAfied,
and (4) Tokenized-CODA. We use the following
sentence to show the different techniques:

1. Surface LMs: No significant preprocessing
is applied apart from the regular initial clean
up of the text which includes removal of
URLs, normalization of speech effects such
as reducing all redundant letters in a word to

2. Orthography Normalized (CODAfied)
LM: since DA is not originally a written
form of Arabic, no standard orthography
exists for it. Habash et al. (2012) attempt
to solve this problem by presenting CODA,
a conventional orthography for writing DA.
We use the implementation of CODA pre-
sented in CODAfy (Eskander et al., 2013),
to build an orthography-normalized LM.
While CODA and its applied version using
CODAfy solve the spelling inconsistency
problem in DA, special care must be taken
when using it for our task since it removes
valuable dialectalness cues. For example, the
letter �H (v in Buckwalter (BW) Translitera-
tion) is converted into the letter �H (t in BW)
in a DA context. CODA suggests that such
cases get mapped to the original MSA phono-
logical variant which might make the dialect
identification problem more challenging. On
the other hand, CODA solves the sparseness
issue by mapping multiple spelling-variants
to the same orthographic form leading to a
more robust LM.

3. Tokenized LM: D3 tokenization-scheme is
applied to all data using MADA (Habash et
al., 2009) (an MSA Tokenizer) for the MSA
corpora, and MADA-ARZ (Habash et al.,
2013) (an EDA tokenizer) for the EDA cor-
pora. For building the tokenized LM, we
maintain clitics and lexemes. Some clitics
are unique to MSA while others are unique to
EDA so maintaining them in the LM is help-
ful, eg. the negation enclitic � $ is only
used in EDA but it could be seen with an
MSA/EDA homograph, maintaining the en-
clitic in the LM facilitates the identification

of the sequence as being EDA. 5-grams are
used for building the tokenized LMs (as op-
posed to 3-grams for the surface LMs)

4. Tokenized & Orthography Normalized
LMs: (Tokenized-CODA) The data is tok-
enized as in (3) then orthography normaliza-
tion is applied to the tokenized data.

In addition to the underlying token-level system,
we use the following token-level features:

1. Percentage of words in the sentence that is
analyzable by an MSA morphological ana-
lyzer.

2. Percentage of words in the sentence that is
analyzable by an EDA morphological ana-
lyzer.

3. Percentage of words in the sentence that ex-
ists in a precompiled EDA lexicon.

3.1.1.2 Perplexity-based Features: We run
each sentence through each of the MSA and EDA
LMs and record the perplexity for each of them.
The perplexity of a language model on a given test
sentence; S(w1, .., wn) is defined as:

perplexity = (2)−(1/N)
∑

i
log2(p(wi|hi)) (1)

where N is the number of tokens in the sentence
and hi is the history of token wi.

The perplexity conveys how confused the LM is
about the given sentence so the higher the perplex-
ity value, the less probable that the given sentence
matches the LM.2

3.1.2 Meta Features.

These are the features that do not directly relate
to the dialectalness of words in the given sentence
but rather estimate how informal the sentence is
and include:

• The percentage of punctuation, numbers,
special-characters and words written in Ro-
man script.

2We repeat this step for each of the preprocessing schemes
explained in section 3.1.1.1

• The percentage of words having word-
lengthening effects.

• Number of words & average word-length.
• Whether the sentence has consecutive re-

peated punctuation or not. (Binary feature,
yes/no)

• Whether the sentence has an exclamation
mark or not. (Binary feature, yes/no)

• Whether the sentence has emoticons or not.
(Binary feature, yes/no)

3.2 Model Training

We use the WEKA toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) and
the derived features to train a Naive-Bayes classi-
fier. The classifier is trained and cross-validated
on the gold-training data for each of our different
configurations (Surface, CODAfied, Tokenized &
Tokenized-CODA).

We conduct two sets of experiments. In the first
one, Experiment Set A, we split the data into a
training set and a held-out test set. In the second
set, Experiment Set B, we use the whole dataset
for training without further splitting. For both sets
of experiments, we apply 10-fold cross validation
on the training data. While using a held-out test-
set for evaluation (in the first set of experiments)
is a better indicator of how well our approach per-
forms on unseen data, only the results from the
second set of experiments are directly comparable
to those produced by Zaidan and Callison-Burch
(2011).

4 Experiments

4.1 Data

We use the code-switched EDA-MSA portion of
the crowd source annotated dataset by Zaidan
and Callison-Burch (2011). The dataset consists
of user commentaries on Egyptian news articles.
Table 1 shows the statistics of the data.

perform the 10-fold cross-validation.

4.2 Baselines

We use four baselines. The first of which is a
majority baseline (Maj-BL); that assigns all the
sentences the label of the most frequent class ob-
served in the training data. The second baseline
(Token-BL) assumes that the sentence is EDA if
more than 45% of its tokens are dialectal otherwise
it assumes it is MSA.3 The third baseline (Ppl-BL)
runs each sentence through MSA & EDA LMs and
assigns the sentence the class of the LM yielding
the lower perplexity value. The last baseline (OZ-
CCB-BL) is the result obtained by Zaidan and
Callison-Burch (2011) which uses the same ap-
proach of our third baseline, Ppl-BL.4 For Token-
BL and Ppl-BL, the performance is calculated
for all LM-sizes of the four different configura-
tions: Surface, CODAfied, Tokenized, Tokenized-
CODA and the best performing configuration on
the cross-validation set is used as the baseline sys-
tem.

4.3 Results & Discussion

For each of the different configurations, we build a
learning curve by varying the size of the LMs be-
tween 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M and 28M tokens. Figures
1a and 1b show the learning curves of the different
configurations on the cross-validation set for ex-
periments A & B respectively. In Table 2 we note
that both CODA and Tokenized solve the data-
sparseness issue hence they produce better results

3We experimented with different thresholds (15%, 30%,
45%, 60% and 75%) and the 45% threshold setting yielded

than Surface experimental condition. However, as
mentioned earlier, CODA removes some dialectal-
ness cues so the improvement resulting from using
CODA is much less than that from using tokeniza-
tion. Also when combining CODA with tokeniza-
tion as in the condition Tokenized-CODA, the per-
formance drops since in this case the sparseness
issue has been already resolved by tokenization
so adding CODA only removes dialectalness cues.

All configurations outperform all baselines with
the Tokenized configuration producing the best re-
sults. The performance of all systems drop as
the size of the LM increases beyond 16M tokens.
As indicated in (Elfardy et al., 2013) as the size
of the MSA & EDA LMs increases, the shared
ngrams increase leading to higher confusability
between the classes of tokens in a given sentence.
Table 3 presents the results on the held out dataset
compared against three of the baselines, Maj-BL,
Token-BL and Ppl-BL. We note that the Tokenized
condition, the best performing condition, outper-
forms all baselines with a significant margin.

5 Conclusion

We presented a supervised approach for sentence
level dialect identification in Arabic. The ap-
proach uses features from an underlying system
for token-level identification of Egyptian Dialec-
tal Arabic in addition to other core and meta fea-
tures to decide whether a given sentence is MSA or
EDA. We studied the impact of two types of pre-
processing techniques (Tokenization and Orthog-
raphy Normalization) as well as varying the size of
the LM on the performance of our approach. The
presented approach produced significantly better
results than a previous approach in addition to
beating the majority baseline and two other strong
baselines.
