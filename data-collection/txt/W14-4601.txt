Abstract 

This paper describes an on-going project that seeks to develop the first automatic PoS tagger 
for Scottish Gaelic.  Adapting the PAROLE tagset for Irish, we manually re-tagged a pre-
existing 86k token corpus of Scottish Gaelic.  A double-verified subset of 13.5k tokens was 
used to instantiate eight statistical taggers and verify their accuracy, via a randomly assigned 
hold-out sample.  An accuracy level of 76.6% was achieved using a Brill bigram tagger.  We 
provide an overview of the project’s methodology, interim results and future directions. 

1 Introduction 
Part-of-speech (PoS) tagging is considered by some to be a solved problem (cf. Manning, 2011: 172). 
Although this could be argued for languages and domains with decades of NLP work behind them, 
developing accurate PoS taggers for highly inflectional or agglutinative languages is no trivial task 
(Oravecz and Dienes, 2002: 710).  Challenges are posed by the profusion of word-forms in these lan-
guages – leading to data sparseness – and their typically complex tagsets (ibid.).  The complicated 
morphology of the Celtic languages, of which Scottish Gaelic (ScG) is a member,1 led one linguist to 
state, “There is hardly a language [family] in the world for which the traditional concept of ‘word’ is 
so doubtful” (Ternes, 1982: 72; cf. Dorian, 1973: 414).  As inauspicious as this may seem for our 
aims, tagger accuracy levels of 95-97% have been achieved for other morphologically complex lan-
guages such as Polish (Acedański, 2010: 3), Irish (Uí Dhonnchadha and Van Genabith, 2006) and 
Hungarian (Oravecz and Dienes, 2002: 710).  In this paper, we describe our effort to build – to the best 
of our knowledge – the first accurate, automatic tagger of ScG.   
 
Irish is the closest linguistic relative to Gaelic in which substantial NLP work has been done, and Uí 
Dhonnchadha and Van Genabith’s work (2006; cf. Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009) provides a valuable refer-
ence point.  For them, a rule-based method was the preferred option, as a tagged corpus of Irish was 
unavailable (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009: 42).2  They used finite-state transducers for the tokenisation and 
morphological analyses, and context-sensitive Constraint Grammar rules to carry out PoS disambigua-
tion (2006: 2241).  In our case, after consultation, we decided to adopt a statistical approach.  We were 
motivated by the availability of a pre-existing, hand-tagged corpus of Scottish Gaelic (see Lamb, 
2008: 52-70), and our expectation that developing an accurate, rule-based tagger would take us beyond 
our one-year timeframe.    

2 Methodology 
2.1 Annotation  
Using an adapted form of the PAROLE Irish tagset (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009: 224), we manually re-
tagged the corpus of ScG mentioned above.  Significant conversion was required, as the corpus had 
been designed for a study of register variation (Lamb, 2008).  Currently, 13.5k tokens have been final-

ised and used to train and evaluate various tagger algorithms, as described below.  Our motivations for 
adapting the Irish tagset were to facilitate comparisons between Irish and ScG corpora, and to follow 
emergent de facto standards, as recommended in Leech (2005).  Although this expedited progress, 
some tokens could not be easily classified.   
   Like Irish (cf. Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009: 81), ScG morphology is generally regarded as complex, par-
ticularly in the nominal system.  Various process can re-shape word-forms, resulting in data sparse-
ness; sparsity is a common issue in NLP work with morphologically-rich languages (Orvecz and 
Dienes, 2002: 711).  These processes include initial consonant mutation (e.g. c → ch); internal vowel 
change (e.g. a → oi); palatalisation of final consonants (e.g. -at → -ait) and affixation. For example, 
the singular noun cearc [‘hen’] declines for case and definiteness as cearc, chearc, circ, chirc, circe 
and chirce. The adjective mall [‘slow’] can be found variably as mall, mhall, malla, mhalla, moill, 
mhoill, moille and mhoille.3   To compound issues, as the language attrites, historically robust 
distinctions are being levelled or inconsistently observed.  Another obstacle was ambiguous function 
words, such as a and a’; these can be tagged in various ways,4 depending on context.  There were also 
a small number of fused forms having multiple grammatical categories: e.g. cuimhneam [‘I know’],5 
← cuimhne [‘knowledge’] + agam [‘at me’].  It was not possible, in all cases, to split these at the to-
kenisation stage and introducing further complexity to an already involved tagset seemed ill-advised.  
Therefore, we determined to use concatenation tags (cf. Chungku et al., 2010: 105), e.g. cuimhneam 
[‘knowledge at me’] <Ncsfn+Pr1s>.  This tag is glossed as: Noun common singular feminine nomina-
tive + Pronoun prepositional 1st-person singular.    

2.2 Tokenisation   
A full account of the automatic tokeniser is beyond the scope of this paper.  What follows is a brief 
description of our guiding principles and the manual tokenisation of the training corpus.  As a rule, we 
strove for a 1:1 correspondence between words/punctuation and tokens (1).  However, some excep-
tions were necessary.  As illustrated in (2) by the phrase mu dheireadh [‘at last’], multi-word expres-
sions were tokenised together when they performed an indivisible grammatical function6 and could not 
be intersected by another word.  Here, we took a slightly different approach from Uí Dhonnchadh 
(2009: 71-72); our preference was for a low number of MWEs in order to avoid the need for a compli-
cated lexicon.7  In a few cases, we split words into two or more tokens if a failure to have done so 
would have negatively impacted the pipeline further on (e.g. during lexicon extraction).  In (3), this is 
illustrated by the word dh’fhuirich [‘stayed’], which has been split into two tokens, separating the 
morphophonemic particle dh’ from the verbal form.  As described in Uí Dhonnchadha (2009: 70-71), 
this obviates duplication in the lexicon (cf. m’ad1 [‘my hat’] → m’1 ad2).       
 

1) 1 WORD → 1 TOKEN 
“1Ò2 cha3 robh4 e5 seo6,7”8 ars’9 ise10 →  "1 Ò2 cha3 robh4 e5 seo6 ,7 "8 ars´9 ise10 
 
2) ≥ 2 WORDS → 1 TOKEN 
Bhàsaich1 am2 fear3 mu4 dheireadh5 →  Bhàsaich1 am2 fear3 mu dheireadh4 
 
3) 1 WORD →≥2 TOKENS 
Dh’fhuirich1 e2 ann3 →  Dh´1 fhuirich2 e3 ann4 

 

                                                
3 See Lamb (2008: 197-280) for further details on Gaelic grammar.  Many of the same issues are encountered in Irish (see Uí 
Dhonnchadha, 2009). 
4 The word a, for instance, can be variably tagged as a 3rd person masc possessive, a relative PN, a verbal agreement marker, 
the vocative particle, an interrogative pronoun, a simple preposition and a numerical counting particle.   
5 NB: cuimhneam is a fused form consisting of a noun and a prepositional pronoun.  Like Russian, Gaelic expresses 
possession in a locative fashion (e.g. tha e agam [‘I have it’, lit. ‘it is at me’]; there is no verb of possession.   
6 As defined by the tagset. 
7 However, toponyms were tokenised as MWEs, e.g. Dùn Èideann ‘Edinburgh’ (cf. Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009: 72).

More generally, the corpus was manually divided into clauses, with each clause on a separate line.  
This was done to provide additional context for automatic tag disambiguation, with clause boundaries 
used in lieu of ‘sentence boundaries’ for instantiating the taggers.  Clauses are linguistically well-
defined structures, whilst sentences are not (Miller and Weiner, 1998: 71).   

2.3 Tagger Instantiation 
The PoS tagging task can be formulated as follows: given a word wi, derived from a sequence of 
words (wi…wn), assign the best tag  ti, derived from a set of tags, T={ti..tn}.  After our 13.5k token 
sample had been manually tagged and twice verified, we used it to instantiate two stochastic taggers – 
bigram HMM (see Huang et al., 2009: 214) and trigram TnT (Brants, 2000: 224) – and a hybrid tagger 
(Brill, 1992: 112), which combines a stochastic and rule-based method.  We employed the principle of 
ensemble learning (Dietterich, 2000: 1), whereby simple statistical PoS tagging algorithms can be use-
fully employed to improve the precision of more sophisticated algorithms.  For comparative purposes, 
we also included simple unigram, bigram and trigram taggers.  Simple n-gram algorithms tend to as-
sign tags based on the most frequent tag sequence of the n-gram as observed in the training set. 
   On the surface, the HMM and TnT algorithms employ similar approaches to tagging, as both analyse 
the sequential history of word–tag pairings in a given ‘sentence’ using Markov Model principles 
(Ghahramani, 2001: 9).  However, the approaches employed by HMM and TnT are somewhat differ-
ent.  HMM is based on first-order Markov Model principles, whereas TnT tends to be based upon se-
cond-order ones. Additionally, TnT tends to employ additional features during training, such as capi-
talisation and suffixes (Brants, 2000: 224).  The Brill tagger, on the other hand, is an example of 
Transformational-Based Learning (Brill, 1992: 112).  Like a stochastic tagger, it begins by pairing 
words with their most likely tags, as observed in the training corpus.  This can be done using uni-
grams, bigrams or trigrams.  It then notes where tags are applied incorrectly and attempts to induce 
corrective rules via various context-sensitive templates (ibid.: 113).  Finally, it re-tags the corpus ac-
cording to learnt patterns.  A typical template is ‘replace t1 with t2 in the context of C’.  Some glossed 
examples from the Gaelic corpus follow: 

 
1) Ug →  Q-r if the tag of words i+1...i+2 is ‘V-s’ [token = a]  
Change the tag for the agreement marker to one for a relative pronoun if one of the next two 
words is tagged as a past-tense verb  
 
2) Tdsm →  Tdsf if the tag of words i+1...i+2 is ‘Ncsfn’ [token = a’] 
Change the tag for the singular, masculine definite article to one for the singular, feminine def-
inite article if one of the following two words is a singular, feminine noun in the nominative  
 
3) Sa →  Tdsf if the tag of the following word is ‘Ncsfn’ [token = a’] 
Change the tag for the aspectual particle to one for the singular, feminine definite article if the 
following word is tagged as a singular, feminine noun in the nominative  
 

One of the advantages of the Brill tagger over other stochastic approaches is its transparency.  With a 
knowledge of the tagset and target language, its output is easily understood.  As seen in the above ex-
amples, it is capable of handling the problematic homographs discussed in §2.1.   
   Eight models, in total, were developed and assessed using the same training and testing set (see Ta-
ble 1).  Since the Brill tagger requires the output of a stochastic tagger before applying inductive 
methods, as described above, we employed the unigram algorithm as a base.  Our ensemble strategy 
used a backoff mechanism, implemented as part of the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) libraries 
(Bird, 2006: 70).  Backoff creates a chain of PoS tagging algorithms that are executed in sequential 
order, ensuring that if an initial tagger is unable to classify a given token, then that token is passed on 
to the next tagging algorithm.  Two ensemble-based models were developed: Brill (with bigram) and 
Brill (with trigram).  Thus, in addition to using the simple unigram model as an initial stochastic tag-
ger with Brill, we also employed bigram and trigram models.  Brill (bigram) passes any untagged to-
ken to the unigram tagger, whereas the Brill (trigram), employs the bigram algorithm for untagged 
tokens and then passes any untagged tokens onto the unigram algorithm.  In all cases, these stochastic 

3



stages are followed by the inductive of rules characterising the Brill algorithm.  We used the default 
parameters of all algorithms, apart from one in the Brill algorithm, which defines the number of rules 
to be learned automatically from the training corpus.  This was set to 150, as it optimised performance 
with the training set (NB: it did not apply to the test set).  
   We employed the hold-out method to evaluate our models (cf. Acedański 2010).  To achieve this, we 
randomly divided the corpus sample into a 10% ‘hold-out’ set for evaluation (165 sentences, ~986 to-
kens), and a 90% ‘training’ set for model development (1492 sentences, ~12,560 tokens).  We as-
sessed the performance of the models by calculating the percentage of correctly assigned PoS tags for 
each against the manually assigned tags.     

3 Results  
The table below shows the preliminary results.

Model Unigram Bigram Trigram HMM TnT BrillUNI BrillBI BrillTRI 
Accuracy 66.1 52.1 23.6 74.6 76.1 75.6 76.6 75.2 

 
As seen in Table 1, the most successful method, at present, is the Brill bigram model, which had a per-
formance level of 76.6%.  This is to be expected given the granularity of the tagset, along with the re-
stricted training data; we expect accuracy to increase once we utilise the full corpus of ~86k tokens.8  
Unsurprisingly, due to sparsity issues, the least successful model was the simple trigram, at 23.6%.  
The performance of the TnT model was somewhat better than HMM (HMM: 74.6% and TnT: 76.1%), 
and also better than the Brill unigram model (TnT: 76.1% and BrillUNI: 75.6%).  The Brill bigram mod-
el, which is ensemble-based, outperformed the TnT model by about 0.5% (BrillBI: 76.6% and TnT: 
76.1%).  There was, however, a drop in performance of about 1.4% between the Brill bigram (76.6 %) 
and Brill trigram (75.2%).  Overall, our top accuracy level is comparable to that reported in Dandapat 
et al. (2007: 223) for their 10k sample (84.73%), although they experienced less sparsity as their tagset 
had only 40 categories (ibid.: 221).   

4 Discussion and Future Work 
In this paper, we describe an on-going project that seeks to develop the first automatic tagger for ScG.  
We  employed supervised methods to develop and evaluate eight different PoS tagging models.  De-
spite the promising results, more work is indicated.  Data sparsity is the most likely explanation for the 
relatively low performance across the models.  This is exemplified by the 43% difference between the 
performance of the simple trigram and unigram models.  Considering the size of the our current train-
ing set (12.5k tokens) and the granular nature of the tagset (242 discrete categories), it seems unavoid-
able at present.  The majority of tags had less than five instances in the training set, making it difficult 
for the algorithms to generate useful patterns.  We will address this problem soon by including the full 
corpus, once it has been verified.  Subsequently, we will carry out a fine-grained error analysis to de-
termine which PoS features require further development.  To improve results, we may integrate a lim-
ited amount of morphological analysis, as well a lexical database that has been made available to us 
(Bauer & Robertson, 2014).  Finally, we will be exploring a multi-phase feature disambiguation 
scheme similar to that described in Acedański (2010: 5).
