Abstract

In this paper we describe the system with
which we participated in the CoNLL-2011
Shared Task on modelling coreference. Our
system is based on a cluster-ranking model
proposed by Rahman and Ng (2009), with
novel semantic features based on recent re-
search on narrative event schema (Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2009). We demonstrate some
improvements over the baseline when using
schema information, although the effect var-
ied between the metrics used. We also explore
the impact of various features on our system’s
performance.

1 Introduction

Coreference resolution is a problem for automated
document understanding. We say two segments of
a natural-language document corefer when they re-
fer to the same real-world entity. The segments of
a document which refer to an entity are called men-
tions. In coreference resolution tasks, mentions are
usually restricted to noun phrases.

The goal of the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task (Prad-
han et al., 2011) is to model unrestricted coreference
using the OntoNotes corpus. The OntoNotes cor-
pus is annotated with several layers of syntactic and
semantic information, making it a rich resource for
investigating coreference resolution (Pradhan et al.,
2007).

We participated in both the “open” and “closed”
tracks. The “closed” track requires systems to only
use the provided data, while the “open” track al-
lows use of external data. We created a baseline

system based on the cluster-ranking model proposed
by Rahman and Ng (2009). We then experimented
with adding novel semantic features derived from
co-referring predicate-argument chains. These nar-
rative schema were developed by Chambers and Ju-
rafsky (2009). They are described in more detail in
a later section.

2 Related Work

Supervised machine-learning approaches to corefer-
ence resolution have been researched for almost two
decades. Recently, the state of the art seems to be
moving away from the early mention-pair classifica-
tion model toward entity-based models. Ng (2010)
provides an excellent overview of the history and re-
cent developments within the field.

Both entity-mention and mention-pair models are
formulated as binary classification problems; how-
ever, ranking may be a more natural approach to
coreference resolution (Ng, 2010; Rahman and Ng,
2009). Rahman and Ng (2009) in particular pro-
pose the cluster-ranking model which we used in our
baseline. In another approach, Daumé and Marcu
(2005) apply their Learning as Search Optimization
framework to coreference resolution, and show good
results.

Feature selection is important for good perfor-
mance in coreference resolution. Ng (2010) dis-
cusses commonly used features, and analyses of
the contribution of various features can be found in
(Daumé and Marcu, 2005; Rahman and Ng, 2011;
Ponzetto and Strube, 2006b). Surprisingly, Rahman
and Ng (2011) demonstrated that a system using al-
most exclusively lexical features could outperform

86



systems which used more traditional sets of features.
Although string features have a large effect on

performance, it is recognized that the use of seman-
tic information is important for further improvement
(Ng, 2010; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006a; Ponzetto
and Strube, 2006b; Haghighi and Klein, 2010). The
use of predicate-argument structure has been ex-
plored by Ponzetto and Strube (2006b; 2006a).

3 Narrative Schema for Coreference

Narrative schema are extracted from large-scale cor-
pora using coreference information to identify pred-
icates whose arguments often corefer. Similarity
measures are used to build up schema consisting
of one or more event chains – chains of typically-
coreferring predicate arguments (Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2009). Each chain corresponds to a role in
the schema.

A role defines a class of participants in the
schema. Conceptually, if a schema is present in a
document, than each role in the schema corresponds
to an entity in the document. An example schema is
shown with some typical participants in Figure 1. In
this paper the temporal order of events in the schema
is not considered.

Figure 1: An example narrative schema with two roles.

Narrative schema are similar to the script con-
cept put forth by Schank and Abelson (1977). Like
scripts, narrative schema can capture complex struc-
tured information about events described in natural
language documents (Schank and Abelson, 1977;
Abelson, 1981; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009).

We hypothesize that narrative schema can be a
good source of information for making coreference
decisions. One reason they could be useful is that

they can directly capture the fact that arguments of
certain predicates are relatively more likely to refer
to the same entity. In fact, they can capture global
information about verbs ranging over the entire doc-
ument, which we expect may lead to greater accu-
racy when combined with the incremental clustering
algorithm we employ.

Additionally, the information that two predicates
often share arguments yields semantic information
about the argument words themselves. For exam-
ple, if the subjects of the verbs eat and drink often
corefer, we may be able to infer that words which
occur in the subject position of these verbs share
some property (e.g., animacy). This last conjec-
ture is somewhat validated by Ponzetto and Strube
(2006b), who reported that including predicate-
argument pairs as features improved the perfor-
mance of a coreference resolver.

4 System Description

4.1 Overview

We built a coreference resolution system based on
the cluster-ranking algorithm proposed by Rahman
and Ng (2009). During document processing main-
tains a list of clusters of coreferring mentions which
are created iteratively. Our system uses a determin-
istic mention-detection algorithm that extracts can-
didate NPs from a document. We process the men-
tions in order of appearance in the document. For
each mention a ranking query is created, with fea-
tures generated from the clusters created so far. In
each query we include a null-cluster instance, to al-
low joint learning of discourse-new detection, fol-
lowing (Rahman and Ng, 2009).

For training, each mention is assigned to its cor-
rect cluster according to the coreference annota-
tion. The resulting queries are used to train a
classification-based ranker.

In testing, the ranking model thus learned is used
to rank the clusters in each query as it is created;
the active mention is assigned to the cluster with the
highest rank.

A data-flow diagram for our system is shown in
Figure 2.

4.2 Cluster-ranking Model

Our baseline system uses a cluster-ranking model
proposed by Rahman and Ng (2009; 2011). In this
model, clusters are iteratively constructed after con-
sidering each active mention in a document in order.
During training, features are created between the ac-
tive mention and each cluster created so far. A rank
is assigned such that the cluster which is coreferent
to the active mention has the highest value, and each
non-coreferent cluster is assigned the same, lower
rank (The exact values are irrelevant to learning a
ranking; for the experiments in this paper we used
the values 2 and 1). In this way it is possible to
learn to preferentially rank correct clustering deci-
sions higher.

For classification, instances are constructed ex-
actly the same way as for training, except that for
each active mention, a query must be constructed
and ranked by the classifier in order to proceed with
the clustering. After the query for each active men-
tion has been ranked, the mention is assigned to the
cluster with the highest ranking, and the algorithm
proceeds to the next mention.

4.3 Notation

In the following sections, mk is the active mention
currently being considered, mj is a candidate an-
tecedent mention, and cj is the cluster to which it
belongs. Most of the features used in our system ac-
tually apply to a pair of mentions (i.e., mk and mj)
or to a single mention (either mk or mj). To cre-
ate a training or test instance using mk and cj , the

features which apply to mj are converted to cluster-
level features by a procedure described in 4.6.

4.4 Joint Anaphoric Mention Detection

We follow Rahman and Ng (2009) in jointly learn-
ing to detect anaphoric mentions along with resolv-
ing coreference relations. For each active mention
mk, an instance for a ‘null’ cluster is also created,
with rank 2 if the mention is not coreferent with
any preceding mention, or rank 1 if it has an an-
tecedent. This allows the ranker the option of mak-
ing mk discourse-new. To create this instance, only
the features which involve just mk are used.

4.5 Features

The features used in our system are shown in Table
1. For the NE features we directly use the types from
the OntoNotes annotation. 1

4.6 Making Cluster-Level Features

Each feature which applies to mj must be converted
to a cluster-level feature. We follow the proce-
dure described in (Rahman and Ng, 2009). This
procedure uses binary features whose values corre-
spond to being logically true or false. Multi-valued
features are first converted into equivalent sets of
binary-valued features. For each binary-valued fea-
ture, four corresponding cluster-level features are
created, whose values are determined by four logical

1The set of types is: PERSON, NORP, FACILITY, ORGA-
NIZATION, GPE, LOCATION, PRODUCT, EVENT, WORK,
LAW, LANGUAGE, DATE, TIME, PERCENT, MONEY,
QUANTITY, ORDINAL, CARDINAL

Features involving mj only
SUBJECT Y if mj is the grammatical subject of a verb; N otherwise
*NE_TYPE1 the NE label for mj if there is one else NONE

Features involving mk only
DEFINITE Y if the first word of mk is the; N otherwise
DEMONSTRATIVE Y if the first word of mk is one of this, that, these, or those; N otherwise
DEF_DEM_NA Y if neither DEFINITE nor DEMONSTRATIVE is Y; N otherwise
PRONOUN2 Y if mk is a personal pronoun; N otherwise
PROTYPE2 nominative case of mk if mk is a pronoun or NA if it is not (e.g., HE if mk is him)
NE_TYPE2 the NE label for mk if there is one

Features involving both mj and mk
DISTANCE how many sentences separate mj and mk; the values are A) same sentence, B) previous sentence,

and C) two sentences ago or more
HEAD_MATCH Y if the head words are the same; N otherwise
PRONOUN_MATCH if either of mj and mk is not a pronoun, NA; if the nominative case of mj and mk is the same, C; I

otherwise
*NE_TYPE′ the concatenation of the NE labels of mj and mk (if either or both are not labelled NEs, the feature

is created using NONE as the corresponding label)

Features involving cj and mk
SCHEMA_CLUSTER_MATCH a cluster-level feature between mk and cj (details in Section 4.7)

valued features are converted into equivalent sets of binary-valued features before being used to create the cluster-level
features used by the ranker.

predicates: NONE, MOST-FALSE, MOST-TRUE,
and ALL.

To be precise, a feature F may be thought of as a
function taking mj as a parameter, e.g., F (mj). To
simplify notation, features which apply to the pair
mj ,mk take mk as an implicit parameter. The log-
ical predicates then compare the two counts n =
|{mj | F (mj) = true}| and C = |cj |. The re-
sulting features are shown in Table 2.

NONE F TRUE iff n = 0
MOST-FALSE F TRUE iff n < C

2

MOST-TRUE F TRUE iff C
2
≤ n < C

ALL F TRUE iff n = C

Table 2: Cluster-level features created from binary-
valued feature F

The two features marked with * are treated
differently. For each value of NE_TYPE1 and
NE_TYPE′, a new cluster-level feature is cre-
ated whose value is the number of times that fea-
ture/value appeared in the cluster (i.e., if there were
two PERSON NEs in a cluster then the feature
NE_TYPE1_PERSON would have the value 2).

4.7 SCHEMA_CLUSTER_MATCH

The SCHEMA_CLUSTER_MATCH feature is ac-
tually three features, which are calculated over an
entire candidate antecedent cluster cj . First a list is
created of all of the schema roles which the men-
tions in cj participate in, and sorted in decreasing
order according to how many mentions in cj par-
ticipate in each. Then, the value of the feature
SCHEMA_CLUSTER_MATCHn is Y if mention
mk also participates in the nth schema role in the
list, for n = 1, 2, 3. If it does not, or if the corre-
sponding nth schema role has fewer than two partic-
ipants in cj , the value of this feature is N.

4.8 Implementation Details

Our system was implemented in Python, in order to
make use of the NLTK library2. For the ranker we
used SVMrank, an efficient implementation for train-
ing ranking SVMs (Joachims, 2006) 3.

5 Experiments and Results

5.1 CoNLL System Submission

We submitted two results to the CoNLL-2011
Shared Task. In the “closed” track we submitted the
results of our baseline system without the schema
features, trained on all documents in both the train-
ing and development portions of the OntoNotes cor-
pus.

We also submitted a result in the “open” track:
a version of our system with the schema features
added. Due to issues with the implementation of this
second version, however, we were only able to sub-
mit results from a model trained on just the WSJ por-
tion of the training dataset. For the schema features,
we used a database of narrative schema released by
Chambers and Jurafsky (2010) – specifically the list
of schemas of size 12. 4

The official system scores for our system are
listed in Table 3. We can attribute some of the low
performance of our system to features which are too
noisy, and to having not enough features compared
to the large size of the dataset. It is likely that these
two factors adversely impact the ability of the SVM
to learn effectively. In fact, the features which we in-
troduced partially to provide more features to learn
with, the NE features, had the worst impact on per-
formance according to later analysis. Because of a
problem with our implementation, we were unable
to get an accurate idea of our system’s performance
until after the submission deadline.

5.2 Using Narrative Schema as World
Knowledge for Coreference Resolution

We conducted an evaluation of the baseline without
schema features against a model with both schema
features added. The results are shown in Table 4.

The results were mixed, with B3 going up and
MUC and CEAF falling slightly. Cross-validation
using just the development set showed a more posi-
tive picture, however, with both MUC and B3 scores
increasing more than 1 point (p = 0.06 and p <
0.01, respectively), and CEAF increasing about 0.5
points as well (although this was not significant at
p > 0.1). 5

One problem with the schema features that we
had anticipated was that they may have a problem
with sparseness. We had originally intended to ex-
tract schema using the coreference annotation in
OntoNotes, predicting that this would help alleviate
the problem; however, due to time constraints we
were unable to complete this effort.

5.3 Feature Analysis

We conducted a feature ablation analysis on our
baseline system to better understand the contribu-
tion of each feature to overall performance. The
results are shown in Table 5. We removed fea-
tures in blocks of related features; -HEAD removes
HEAD MATCH; -DIST removes the DISTANCE
feature; -SUBJ is the baseline system without SUB-
JECT; -PRO is the baseline system without PRO-
NOUN2, PROTYPE2, and PRONOUN MATCH;
-DEF DEM removes DEFINITE, DEMONSTRA-
TIVE, and DEF DEM NA; and -NE removes the
named entity features.

5All significance tests were performed with a two-tailed t-
test.

The fact that for three of the features, removing
the feature actually improved performance is trou-
bling. Possibly these features were too noisy; we
need to improve the baseline features for future ex-
periments.

6 Conclusions

Semantic information is necessary for many tasks in
natural language processing. Most often this infor-
mation is used in the form of relationships between
words – for example, how semantically similar two
words are, or which nouns are the objects of a verb.
However, it is likely that humans make use of much
higher-level information than the similarity between
two concepts when processing language (Abelson,
1981). We attempted to take advantage of recent de-
velopments in automatically aquiring just this sort
of information, and demonstrated the possibility of
making use of it in NLP tasks such as coreference.
However, we need to improve both the implementa-
tion and data for this approach to be practical.

For future work, we intend to investigate avenues
for improving the aquisition and use of the narra-

tive schema information, and also compare narra-
tive schema with other types of semantic informa-
tion in coreference resolution. Because coreference
information is central to the extraction of narrative
schema, the joint learning of coreference resolution
and narrative schema is another area we would like
to explore.
