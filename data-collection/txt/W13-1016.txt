Abstract

We deal with syntactic identification of oc-
currences of multiword expression (MWE)
from an existing dictionary in a text corpus.
The MWEs we identify can be of arbitrary
length and can be interrupted in the surface
sentence. We analyse and compare three ap-
proaches based on linguistic analysis at a vary-
ing level, ranging from surface word order to
deep syntax. The evaluation is conducted us-
ing two corpora: the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank and Czech National Corpus. We use the
dictionary of multiword expressions SemLex,
that was compiled by annotating the Prague
Dependency Treebank and includes deep syn-
tactic dependency trees of all MWEs.

1 Introduction

Multiword expressions (MWEs) exist on the inter-
face of syntax, semantics, and lexicon, yet they are
almost completely absent from major syntactic the-
ories and semantic formalisms. They also have inter-
esting morphological properties and for all these rea-
sons, they are important, but challenging for Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Recent advances show
that taking MWEs into account can improve NLP
tasks such as dependency parsing (Nivre and Nils-
son, 2004; Eryiğit et al., 2011), constituency parsing
(Arun and Keller, 2005), text generation (Hogan et
al., 2007), or machine translation (Carpuat and Diab,
2010).

The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) of
Czech and the associated lexicon of MWEs Sem-
Lex1 offer a unique opportunity for experimentation

with MWEs. In this paper, we focus on identifica-
tion of their syntactic structures in the treebank us-
ing various levels of linguistic analysis and match-
ing algorithms.2 We compare approaches operating
on manually and automatically annotated data with
various depth of annotation from two sources: the
Prague Dependency Treebank and Czech National
Corpus (CNC).

The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the state of the art of in
acquisition and identification of MWEs. Section 3
explains what we consider a MWE. In Section 4
we describe the data used for our experiments. Sec-
tion 5 gives the details of our experiments, and in
Section 6 we analyse and discuss the results. Con-
clusions from the analysis are drawn in Section 7.

2 Processing of Multiword Expressions
and Related Work

Automatic processing of multiword expressions in-
cludes two distinct (but interlinked) tasks. Most of
the effort has been put into acquisition of MWEs
appearing in a particular text corpus into a lexi-
con of MWEs (types) not necessarily linked with
their occurrences (instances) in the text. The best-
performing methods are usually based on lexical as-
sociation measures that exploit statistical evidence
of word occurrences and co-occurrences acquired
from a corpus to determine degree of lexical asso-
ciation between words (Pecina, 2005). Expressions
that consist of words with high association are then

2We do not aim at disambiguating the occurrences as figura-
tive or literal. We have not observed enough literal uses to sub-
stantiate working on this step. There are bigger improvements
to be gained from better identification of syntactic occurrences.

denoted as MWEs. Most of the current approaches
are limited to bigrams despite the fact that higher-
order MWEs are quite common.

The task of identification of MWE occurrences
expects a list of MWEs as the input and identifies
their occurrences (instances) in a corpus. This may
seem to be a trivial problem. However, the complex
nature of this phenomenon gives rise to problems on
all linguistic levels of analysis: morphology, syntax,
and semantics.

In morphologically complex languages, a single
MWE can appear in a number of morphological
variants, which differ in forms of their individual
components; and at the same time, a sequence of
words whose base forms match with base forms
of components of a given MWE do not neces-
sarily represent an instance of this MWE (Praco-
val dnem i nocı́ / He’s been working day and night
vs. Ti dva byli jako den a noc / Those two were as
day and night).

MWEs differ in the level of syntactic fixedness.
On the one hand, certain MWEs can be modified
by inserting words in between their components
or by changing word order. Such expressions can
only be identified by matching their syntactic struc-
tures, but only if a reliable syntactic information is
available in both the lexion and text (Po převratu
padaly hlavy / After the coup, heads were rolling
vs. Hlavy zkorumpovaných náměstků budou padat
jedna za druhou / One head of a corrupt deputy
will be rolling after the other). On the other hand,
some MWEs can appear only as fixed expressions
with no modifications allowed. In that case, the syn-
tactic matching approach can miss-indicate their in-
stances because of an inserted word or altered word
order (Vyššı́ společnost / High society vs. *Vyššı́ bo-
hatšı́ společnost / High rich society).

From the semantic point of view, MWEs are of-
ten characterized by more or less non-compositional
(figurative) meaning. Their components, however,
can also occur with the same syntax but composi-
tional (literal) semantics, and therefore not acting
as MWEs (Jedinou branku dal až v poslednı́ minutě
zápasu / He scored his only goal in the last minute of
the match. vs. Rozhodčı́ dal branku zpět na své mı́sto
/ The referee put a goal back to its place).

Automatic discrimination between figurative and
literal meaning is a challenging task similar to

word sense disambiguation which has been stud-
ied extensively: Katz and Giesbrecht (2006), Cook
et al. (2007), Hashimoto and Kawahara (2008), Li
and Sporleder (2009), and Fothergill and Baldwin
(2011). Seretan (2010) includes MWE identification
(based on a lexicon) in a syntactic parser and reports
an improvement of parsing quality. As a by-product,
the parser identified occurrences of MWEs from a
lexicon. Similarly, Green et al. (2013) embed identi-
fication of some MWEs in a Tree Substitution Gram-
mar and achieve improvement both in parsing qual-
ity and MWE identification effectiveness. None of
these works, however, attempt to identify all MWEs,
regardless their length or complexity, which is the
main goal of this paper.

3 Definition of Multiword Expressions

We can use the rough definition of MWEs put for-
ward by Sag et al. (2002): “idiosyncratic interpreta-
tions that cross word boundaries (or spaces)”. We
can also start from their – or Bauer’s (1983) – ba-
sic classification of MWEs as lexicalised or insti-
tutionalised phrases, where lexicalised phrases in-
clude some syntactic, semantic or lexical (i.e. word
form) element, that is idiosyncratic. Institutionalised
phrases are syntactically and semantically compo-
sitional, but still require a particular lexical choice,
e.g. disallowing synonyms (mobile phone, but not
*movable phone).

We need to make just one small adjustment to the
above: “phrase” above must be understood as a sub-
tree, i.e. it can have holes in the surface sentence, but
not in terms of a dependency tree.

In reality there is no clear boundary, in particu-
lar between the institutional phrases and other collo-
cations. Like many other traditional linguistic cate-
gories, cf. Manning (2003), this phenomenon seems
to be more continuous than categorial.

For the purpose of this paper, however, it is not
important at all. We simply try to find all instances
of the expressions (subtrees) from a lexicon in a text,
whatever form the expression may take in a sen-
tence.

4 Data

In this work we use two datasets: Czech National
Corpus (CNC), version SYN2006-PUB, and the

107



Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT), version 2.5.
We run and compare results of our experiments on
both manual annotation of PDT, and automatic anal-
ysis of both PDT and CNC (see Section 5.3). We
also make use of SemLex, a lexicon of MWEs in
the PDT featuring their dependency structures that
is described in Section 4.3.

4.1 Corpora – Czech National Corpus and
Prague Dependency Treebank

CNC is a large3 corpus of Czech. Its released ver-
sions are automatically segmented and they contain
automatic morphological tagging (Hajič, 2004).

PDT (Bejček et al., 2011) is a smaller news-
domain corpus based on a subset of the news section
of CNC. It contains approx. 0.8 million words that
have three layers of annotation: morphological, ana-
lytical (surface syntax), and tectogrammatical (deep
syntax).

Annotation of a sentence on the morphological
layer consists of attaching morphological lemma
and tag to the tokens. A sentence at the analytical
layer is represented as a rooted ordered tree with la-
belled nodes. The dependency relation between two
nodes is captured by an edge with a functional label.
On the tectogrammatical layer only content words
form nodes in a tree (t-nodes).4 Auxiliary words are
represented by various attributes of t-nodes, as they
do not have their own lexical meaning, but rather
modify the meaning of the content words. Each t-
node has a t-lemma: an attribute whose value is the
node’s basic lexical form, and a dependency func-
tion that relates it to its parent. Figure 1 shows the
relations between the neighbouring layers of PDT.

4.2 MWE in Prague Dependency Treebank 2.5

In the Functional Generative Description (Sgall et
al., 1986, FGD)5 the tectogrammatical layer is con-
strued as a layer of the linguistic meaning of text.
This meaning is composed by means of “deep”
(tecto-grammatical) syntax from single-meaning-
carrying units: monosemic lexemes.

3It contains 200 mil. words in SYN2000, 600 mil. in
SYN2006-PUB; http://www.korpus.cz.

guage, that the PDT project is based upon.

PDT. Lit.: “[He] would have gone into forest.”

In order to better facilitate this concept of t-layer,
all multiword expressions in the release of PDT 2.5
(Bejček et al., 2011) have been annotated and they
are by default displayed as single units, although
their inner structure is still retained.

A lexicon of the MWEs has been compiled. A
simple view of the result of this annotation is given
in the Figure 2. A detailed description can be found
in Bejček and Straňák (2010), and Straňák (2010).
The MWEs in PDT 2.5 include both multiword lex-
emes (phrasemes, idioms) and named entities (NEs).
In the present work we ignore the named entities,
concentrating on the lexemes. Some NEs (names of
persons, geographical entities) share characteristics
of multiword lexemes, other NEs do not (addresses,
bibliographic information).

We build on the PDT 2.5 data and MWE lexicon
SemLex (Section 4.3) to evaluate the approach with
various automatic methods for detection of MWEs.

4.3 Lexicon of MWEs – SemLex

SemLex is the lexicon of all the MWEs annotators
identified during the preparation of PDT 2.5 t-layer.
In the PDT 2.5 these instances of MWEs can then be
displayed as single nodes and all the MWEs them-
selves are compiled in the SemLex lexicon. The lex-
icon itself is freely available. See http://ufal.

Figure 2: An illustration of changes in t-trees in PDT 2.5;
every MWE forms a single node and has its lexicon entry

distribution of MWEs in PDT 2.5 is given in Table 1.
There are three attributes of SemLex entries cru-

cial for our task:
BASIC FORM – The basic form of a MWE. In

many languages including Czech it often contains
word forms in other than the basic form for the given
word on its own. E.g. “vysoké učenı́” contains a
neuter suffix of the adjective “vysoký” (high) be-
cause of the required agreement in gender with the
noun, whereas the traditional lemma of adjectives in
Czech is in the masculine form.
LEMMATIZED – “Lemmatised BASIC FORM”,

i.e. take the basic form of an entry and substitute
each form with its morphological lemma. This at-
tribute is used for the identification of MWEs on the
morphological layer. For more details see Section 5.
TREE STRUCT (TS) – A simplified tectogram-

matical dependency tree structure of an entry. Each
node in this tree structure has only two attributes: its
tectogrammatical lemma, and a reference to its ef-
fective parent.

4.4 Enhancing SemLex for the Experiments

SemLex contains all the information we use for the
identification of MWEs on t-layer.6 It also contains
basic information we use for MWE identification on
m-layer: the basic form and the lemmatized form of
each entry. For the experiments with MWE iden-
tification on analytical (surface syntactic) layer we

6Automatic identification of MWES was, after all, one of
the reasons for its construction.

need to add some information about the surface syn-
tactic structures of MWEs. Given the annotated oc-
currences of MWEs in the t-layer and links from
t-layer to a-layer, the extraction is straightforward.
Since one tectogrammatical TS can correspond to
several analytical TSs that contain auxiliaries and
use morphological lemmas, we add a list of a-layer
TSs with their frequency in data to each SemLex en-
try (MWE). In reality the difference between t-layer
and a-layer is unfortunately not as big as one could
expect. Lemmas of t-nodes still often include even
minute morphological variants, which goes against
the vision of tectogrammatics, as described in Sgall
et al. (1986).7 Our methods would benefit from more
unified t-lemmas, see also Section 6.2.

5 Methodology of Experiments

SemLex – with its almost 8,000 types of MWEs and
their 22,000 instances identified in PDT – allows us
to measure accuracy of MWE identification on vari-
ous layers, since it is linked with the different layers
of PDT 2.5. In this section, we present the method
for identification of MWEs on t-layer in compari-
son with identification on a-layer and m-layer. The

7These variants are unified in FGD theory, but time consum-
ing to annotate in practice. Therefore, this aspect was left out
from the current version of PDT.

8Indeed, there are expressions that are multiword, but
“single-node”. E.g.: the preposition in bez váhánı́ (without hes-
itation) does not have its own node on t-layer; the phrase na
správnou mı́ru (lit.: into correct scale) is already annotated as
one phrasal node in PDT with the lemma “na správnou mı́ru”;
the verbal expression umět si představit (can imagine) has again
only one node for reflexive verb “představit si” plus an attribute
for the ability (representing “umět” as explained in Section 4.1).

109



idea of using tectogrammatical TS for identification
is that with a proper tectogrammatical layer (as it
is proposed in FGD, i.e. with correct lemmatisation,
added nodes in place of ellipses, etc.), this approach
should have the highest Precision.

Our approach to identification of MWEs in this
work is purely syntactic. We simply try to find
MWEs from a lexicon in any form they may take
(including partial ellipses in coordination, etc.). We
do not try to exploit semantics, instead we want to
put a solid baseline for future work which may do
so, as mentioned in Section 2.

5.1 MWE Identification on t-layer
We assume that each occurrence of a given MWE
has the same t-lemmas and the same t-layer struc-
ture anywhere in the text. During the manual con-
struction of SemLex, these tectogrammatical “tree
structures” (TSs) were extracted from PDT 2.5 and
inserted into the lexicon. In general this approach
works fine and for majority of MWEs only one TS
was obtained. For the MWEs with more than one TS
in data we used the most frequent one. These cases
are due to some problems of t-layer, not deficiencies
of the theoretical approach. See section 6.2 for the
discussion of the problems.

These TSs are taken one by one and we try to find
them in the tectogrammatical structures of the input
sentences. Input files are processed in parallel. The
criteria for matching are so far only t-lemmas and
topology of the subtree.9 Comparison of tree struc-
tures is done from the deepest node and we consider
only perfect matches of structure and t-lemmata.

5.2 MWE Identification on a-layer and m-layer
We use identification of MWE occurrences on a-
layer and m-layer mainly for comparison with our
approach based on the t-layer.

9It is not sufficient, though. Auxiliary words that are ig-
nored on t-layer are occasionally necessary for distinguishing
MWE from similar group of nodes. (E.g. “v tomto směru” (“in
this regard”) is an MWE whereas “o tomto směru” (“about
this direction”) is not.) There are also attributes in t-layer that
are—although rarely—important for distinguishing the mean-
ing. (E.g. words typeset in bold in “Leonardo dal svým gólem
signál.” (“Leonardo signalled by his goal.”) compose exactly
the same structure as in “Leonardo dal gól.” (“Leonardo scored
a goal.”). I.e., the dependency relation is “dal governs gól” in
both cases. The difference is in the dependency function of gól:
it is either MEANS or DIRECT OBJECT (CPHR).)

We enhance SemLex with a-tree structures as ex-
plained in Section 4.4, and then a-layer is processed
in the same manner as t-layer: analytical TS is taken
from the SemLex and the algorithm tries to match it
to all a-trees. Again, if more than one TS is offered
in lexicon, only the most frequent one is used for
searching.

MWE identification on the m-layer is based on
matching lemmas (which is the only morphological
information we use). The process is parametrised
by a width of a window which restricts the maxi-
mum distance (in a sentence) of MWE components
to span (irrespective of their order) measured in the
surface word order. However, in the setting which
does not miss any MWE in a sentence (100% Re-
call), this parameter is set to the whole sentence and
the maximum distance is not restricted at all.

The algorithm processes each sentence at a time,
and tries to find all lemmas the MWE consists of,
running in a cycle over all MWEs in SemLex. This
method naturally over-generates – it correctly finds
all MWEs that have all their words present in the sur-
face sentence with correct lemmatisation (high Re-
call), but it also marks words as parts of some MWE
even if they appear at the opposite ends of the sen-
tence by complete coincidence (false positives, low
Precision).

In other experiments, the window width varies
from two to ten and MWE is searched for within a
limited context.

5.3 Automatic Analysis of Data Sets
The three MWE identification methods are applied
on three corpora:
• manually annotated PDT: This is the same

data, from which the lexicon was created. Results
evaluated on the same data can be seen only as num-
bers representing the maximum that can be obtained.
• automatically annotated PDT: These are the

same texts (PDT), but their analysis (morphological,
analytical as well as tectogrammatical) started from
scratch. Results can be still biased – first, there are
no new lexemes that did not appear during annota-
tion (that is as if we had a complete lexicon); second,
it should be evaluated only on eval part of the data –
see discussion in Section 6.1.
• automatically annotated CNC: Automatic

analysis from scratch on different sentences. The

disadvantage here is the absence of gold data. Man-
ual evaluation of results has to be accomplished.

For the automatic analysis we use the modular
NLP workflow system Treex (Popel and Žabokrtský,
2010). Both datasets were analysed by the standard
Treex scenario “Analysis of Czech” that includes the
following major blocks:
1) standard rule-based Treex segmentation and to-

kenisation
2) morphology (Hajič, 2004) and Featurama tag-

ger (Spousta, 2011) trained on the train part of
the PDT

3) MST Parser with an improved set of features by
Novák and Žabokrtský (2007)

4) and t-trees structure provided by standard rule-
based Treex block.

6 Results

Effectiveness of our methods of identification of
MWE occurrences is presented in Table 2. Numbers
are given as percentages of Precision and Recall The
first two columns show the results of the evaluation
against gold data in PDT 2.5, the third column re-
flects the manual evaluation on 546 sentences. The
results obtained for PDT (the first two columns) are
also visualised in Figure 3.

The important issue to be decided when evaluat-
ing MWE identification is whether partial match be-
tween automatic identification and gold data MWE

is to be counted. Because of cases containing el-
lipses (see Section 6.2), it can happen that longer
MWE is used for annotation of its subset in text.10

We do not want to penalise automatic identification
(either performing this behaviour or confronted with
it in the gold data), so we treated subset as a match.

Another decision is that although the MWEs can-
not be nested in gold data, we accept it for automatic
identification. Since one word can belong to several
MWEs, the Recall rises, while Precision declines.11

6.1 Discussion of Results
The automatically parsed part of the CNC consists
of 546 sentences. Thus the third column in Table 2
represents evaluation on a much smaller data set.
During manual annotation of this data carried out
by one annotator (different from those who anno-
tated PDT data, but using the same methodology and
a tool), 163 occurences of MWEs were found. Out

10Let us say, only elliptic term Ministry of Industry is seen
in the data (instead of the full name Ministry of Industry and
Trade) annotated by the full-term lexicon entry. Whenever Min-
istry of Industry and Trade is spotted in the test data, its first
part is identified. Should that be qualified as a mistake when
confronted with the gold annotation of the whole term? The as-
signed lexicon entry is the same – only the extent is different.

11For example, annotator had to choose only one MWE to an-
notate in vládnı́ návrh zákona o dani z přı́jmu (lit.: government
proposal of the Law on Income Tax), while it is allowed to auto-
matically identify vládnı́ návrh zákona, zákon o dani and daň z
přı́jmu together with the whole phrase. Recall for this example
is 1, whereas Precision is 0.25.

of them, 46 MWEs were out-of-vocabulary expres-
sions: they could not be found by automatic prece-
dure using the original SemLex lexicon.

Note that results obtained using automatically
parsed PDT are very close to those for manual data
on all layers (see Table 2). The reasons need to be
analysed in more detail. Our hypotheses are:
• M-layer identification reaches the same results

on both data. It is caused by the fact that the ac-
curacy of morphological tagging is comparable to
manual morphological annotation: 95.68% (Spous-
tová, 2008).
• Both a- and t-parsers have problems mostly in

complex constructions such as coordinations, that
very rarely appear inside MWEs.

There are generally two issues that hurt our accu-
racy and that we want to improve to get better re-
sults. First, better data can help. Second, the method
can always be improved. In our case, all data are
annotated—we do nothing on plain text—and it can
be expected that with a better parser, but also possi-
bly a better manual annotation we can do better, too.
The room for improvement is bigger as we go deeper
into the syntax: data are not perfect on the a-layer
(both automatically parsed and gold data) and on
the significantly more complex t-layer it gets even
worse. By contrast, the complexity of methods and
therefore possible improvements go in the opposite
direction. The complexity of tectogrammatic anno-
tation results in a tree with rich, complex attributes
of t-nodes, but simple topology and generalised lem-
mas. Since we only use tree topology and lemmas,
the t-layer method can be really simple. It is slightly

more complex on the a-layer (with auxiliary nodes,
for example); and finally on the m-layer there is vir-
tually unlimited space for experiments and a lot of
literature on that problem. As we can see, these two
issues (improving data and improving the method)
complement each other with changing ratio on indi-
vidual layers.

It is not quite clear from Table 2 that MWE iden-
tification should be done on the t-layer, because it is
currently far from our ideal. It is also not clear that it
should be done on the m-layer, because it seems that
the syntax is necessary for this task.

6.2 Error Analysis and Possible Improvements
There are several reasons, why the t-layer results are
not clearly better:

1. our representation of tree structures proved a
bit too simple,

2. there are some deficiencies in the current t-
layer parser, and

3. t-layer in PDT has some limitations relative to
the ideal tectogrammatical layer.

Ad 1. We thought the current SemLex implemen-
tation of simple tree structures would be sufficient
for our purpose, but it is clear now that it is too
simple and results in ambiguities. At least auxiliary
words and some further syntactico-semantic infor-
mation (such as tectogrammatical functions) should
be added to all nodes in these TSs.

Ad 2. Current tectogrammatical parser does not
do several things we would like to use. E.g. it cannot

112



properly generate t-nodes for elided parts of coordi-
nated MWEs that we need in order to have the same
TS of all MWE occurrences (see below).

Ad 3. The total of 771 out of 8,816 SemLex en-
tries, i.e. 8.75%, have been used with more than one
tectogrammatical tree structure in the PDT 2.5. That
argues against our hypothesis (stated in Section 5.1)
and cause false negatives in the output, since we cur-
rently search for only one TS. In this part we analyze
two of the most important sources of these inconsis-
tent t-trees and possible improvements:
• Gender opposites, diminutives and lemma vari-

ations. These are currently represented by variations
of t-lemma. We believe that they should rather be
represented by attributes of t-nodes that could be
roughly equivalent to some of the lexical functions
in the Meaning-text theory (see Mel’čuk (1996)).
This should be tackled in some future version of
PDT. Once resolved it would allow us to identify
following (and many similar) cases automatically.

– obchodnı́ ředitel vs. obchodnı́ ředitelka
(lit.: managing director-man vs. managing
director-woman)

– rodinný dům vs. rodinný domek
(lit.: family house vs. family little-house; but
the diminutive domek does not indicate that the
house is small)

– občanský zákon vs. občanský zákonı́k
(lit.: citizen law vs. citizen law-codex, meaning
the same thing in modern Czech)

These cases were annotated as instances of the same
MWE, with a vision of future t-lemmas disregard-
ing this variation. Until that happens, however, we
cannot identify the MWEs with these variations au-
tomatically using the most frequent TS only.
• Elided parts of MWEs in coordinations. Al-

though t-layer contains many newly established t-
nodes in place of elided words, not all t-nodes
needed for easy MWE annotation were there. This
decision resulted in the situation, when some MWEs
in coordinations cannot be correctly annotated, esp.
in case of coordination of several multiword lexemes
like inženýrská, montážnı́ a stavebnı́ společnost (en-
gineering, assembling and building company), there
is only one t-node for company. Thus the MWE
inženýrská společnost / engineering company is not
in PDT 2.5 data and cannot be found by the t-layer
identification method. It can, however, be found by

the m-layer surface method, provided the window is
large enough and MWEs can overlap.

7 Conclusions

Identification of occurrences of multiword expres-
sions in text has not been extensively studied yet
although it is very important for a lot of NLP ap-
plications. Our lexicon SemLex is a unique resource
with almost 9 thousand MWEs, each of them with
a tree-structure extracted from data. We use this re-
source to evaluate methods for automatic identifica-
tion of MWE occurrences in text based on matching
syntactic tree structures (tectogrammatical – deep-
syntactic, and analytical – surface-syntactic trees)
and sequences of lemmas in the surface sentence.

The theoretically ideal approach based on tec-
togrammatical layer turned out not to perform bet-
ter, mainly due to the imperfectness of the t-layer
implemented in PDT and also due to the low ac-
curacy of automatic tectogrammatical parser. It still
shows very high Recall, as expected – due to sim-
ple topology of the trees – however Precision is not
ideal. Morphology-based MWE identification guar-
antees high Recall (especially when no limits are put
on the MWE component distance) but Precision of
this approach is rather low. On the other hand, if the
maximum distance is set to 4–5 words we get a very
interesting trade-off between Precision and Recall.
Using analytical layer (and thus introducing surface
syntax to the solution) might be a good approach for
many applications, too. It provides high Precision as
well as reasonable Recall.
