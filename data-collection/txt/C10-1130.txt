Abstract

Question detection serves great purposes
in the cQA question retrieval task. While
detecting questions in standard language
data corpus is relatively easy, it becomes
a great challenge for online content. On-
line questions are usually long and infor-
mal, and standard features such as ques-
tion mark or 5W1H words are likely to be
absent.
In this paper, we explore ques-
tion characteristics in cQA services, and
propose an automated approach to detect
question sentences based on lexical and
syntactic features. Our model is capable
of handling informal online languages.
The empirical evaluation results further
demonstrate that our model signiﬁcantly
outperforms traditional methods in de-
tecting online question sentences, and it
considerably boosts the question retrieval
performance in cQA.

1 Introduction

Community-based Question Answering services
(cQA) such as Yahoo! Answers have emerged
as popular means of information exchange on the
web. They not only connect a network of people
to freely ask and answer questions, but also allow
information seekers to search for relevant histori-
cal questions in the cQA archive (Agichtein et al.,
2008; Xue et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).

Many research works have been proposed to
ﬁnd similar questions in cQA. The state-of-the-art
retrieval models include the vector space model
(Duan et al., 2008), language model (Duan et al.,
2008; Jeon et al., 2005), Okapi model (Jeon et al.,
2005), translation model (Jeon et al., 2005; Rie-

zler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008), and syntac-
tic tree matching model(Wang et al., 2009). Al-
though experimental studies in these works show
that the proposed models are capable of improv-
ing question retrieval, they did not give clear ex-
planation on which portion of the question that
the user query is actually matched against. A
question thread from cQA usually comprises sev-
eral sub-questions conveying different informa-
tion needs, and it is highly desirable to identify
individual sub-questions and match each of them
to the user query. Getting sub-questions clearly
identiﬁed not only helps the retrieval system to
match user query to the most desirable content but
also improves the retrieval efﬁciency.

However, the detection of sub-question is non-
trivial. Question sentences in cQA are usually
mixed with various description sentences, and
they usually employ informal languages, where
standard features such as question mark or ut-
terance are likely to be absent. As such, simple
heuristics using question mark or 5W1H words
(who, what, where, why, how) may become in-
adequate. The demand of special techniques in
detecting question sentences online arises due to
three particular reasons. First, the question mark
could be missing at the end of a question1, or
might be used in cases other than questions such
as “Really bad toothache?”. Second, some ques-
tions such as “I’d like to know the expense of re-
moving wisdom teeth” are expressed in a declar-
ative form, which neither contains 5W1H words
nor is neccessarily ended with “?”. Third, some
question-like sentences do not carry any actual in-
formation need, such as “Please help me?”. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates an example of a question thread

1It is reported (Cong et al., 2008) that 30% of online

questions do not end with question marks.

S1: What do you guys do when you find that the 'plastic 

protection seal' is missing or disturbed. 
Throw it out, buy a new one.. or just use it anyways?
Is it really possible or likely that the item you purchased was 
tampered with??
The box was in a plastic wrap but the item itself inside did 
not having the protection seal (box says it should) so I 
couldn't have inspected it before I bought it.
Please suggest?… thanks!

best of our knowledge, none of the existing ques-
tion retrieval systems are equipped with a com-
prehensive question detector module to handle
various question forms online, and limited effort
has been devoted to this direction.

In this paper, we extensively explore character-
istics of questions in cQA, and propose a fully
automated approach to detecting question sen-
tences. In particular, we complement lexical pat-
terns with syntactic patterns, and use them as fea-
tures to train a classiﬁcation model that is capable
of handling informal online languages. To save
human annotations, we further propose to employ
one-class SVM algorithm for model learning, in
which only positive examples are used as opposed
to requiring both positive and negative examples.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 presents the lexical and syntactic pat-
terns as used for question detection. Section 3
describes the learning algorithm for the classiﬁ-
cation model. Section 4 shows our experimental
results. Section 5 reviews some related work and
Section 6 concludes this paper.

2 Pattern Mining for Question Detection

As has been discussed, human generated content
on the Web are usually not well formatted, and
naive methods such as the use of question mark
and 5W1H words are not adequate to correctly
detect or capture all online questions. Methods
based on hand-crafted rules also fail to cope with
various question forms as randomly appeared on
the Web. To overcome the shortcomings of these
traditional methods, we propose to extract a set
of salient patterns from online questions and use

them as features to detect question sentences.

In this study, we mainly focus on two kinds
of patterns – sequential pattern at the lexical
level and syntactic shallow pattern at the syntac-
tic level. Sequential patterns have been well dis-
cussed in many literature, including the identiﬁ-
cation of comparative sentences (Jindal and Liu,
2006), the detection of erroneous sentences (Sun
et al., 2007) and question sentences (Cong et al.,
2008) etc. However, works on syntactic patterns
have only been partially explored (Zaki and Ag-
garwal, 2003; Sun et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009).
Grounded on these previous works, we next ex-
plain our mining approach of the sequential and
syntactic shallow patterns.

2.1 Sequential Pattern Mining

Sequential Pattern is also referred to as Labeled
Sequential Pattern (LSP) in the literature.
It is
in the form of S⇒C, where S is a sequence
{t1, . . . , tn}, and C is the class label that the se-
quence S is classiﬁed to. In the problem of ques-
tion detection, a sequence is deﬁned to be a se-
ries of tokens from questions, and the class labels
are {Q, N Q}, which stand for question and non-
question respectively.
The purpose of sequential pattern mining is to
extract a set of frequent subsequence of words
that are indicative of questions. For example,
the word subsequence “anyone know what . . .
to” could be a good indication to characterize the
question sentence “anyone know what I can do to
make me less tired.”. Note that the mined sequen-
tial tokens need not to be contiguous as appeared
in the original text.

There is a handful of algorithms available for
frequent subsequence extraction. Pei et al. (2001)
observed that all occurrences of a frequent pattern
can be classiﬁed into groups (approximated pat-
tern) and proposed a Preﬁxspan algorithm. The
Preﬁxspan algorithm quickly ﬁnds out all rela-
tive frequent subsequences by a pattern growth
method, and determines the approximated pat-
terns from those subsequences. We adopt this al-
gorithm in our work due to its high reported efﬁ-
ciency. We impose the following additional con-
straints for better control over the signiﬁcance of
the mined patterns:

1157

1. Maximum Pattern Length: It limits the maxi-

S

S

mum number of tokens in a mined sequence.

2. Maximum Token Distance: The two adjacent
tokens tn and tn+1 in the pattern need to be
within a threshold window in the original text.
3. Minimum Support: The minimum percentage

of sentences in Q containing the pattern p.

4. Minimum Conﬁdence: The probability of a
pattern p⇒Q being true in the whole database.
To overcome the word sparseness problem, we
generalize each sentence by applying the Part-of-
Speech (POS) tags to all tokens except some in-
dicative keywords such as 5W1H words, modal
words, stopwords etc. For instance, the question
sentence “How can I quickly tell if my wisdom
teeth are coming” is converted to “How can I RB
VBP if my NN NNS VBP VBG”, on top of which
the pattern mining is conducted. To further cap-
ture online language patterns, we mine a set of
frequent tokens that are unique to cQA such as
“any1”, “im” and “whats”, and keep them from
being generalized. The reason to hold back this
set of tokens is twofold. First, conventional POS
taggers are trained from standard English corpus,
and they could mis-tag these non-standard words.
Second, the special online tokens are analogue to
standard stopwords, and having them properly ex-
cluded could help reﬂect the online users’ textual
questioning patterns.

It is expected that the converted patterns pre-
serve the most representative features of online
questions. Each discovered pattern makes up a
binary feature for the classiﬁcation model that we
will introduce in Section 3.

2.2 Syntactic Shallow Pattern Mining

The sequential patterns represent features at the
lexical level, but we found that lexical patterns
might not always be adequate to categorize ques-
tions. For example, the pattern {when, do} could
presume the non-question “Levator scapulae is
used when you do the traps workout” to be a ques-
tion, whereas the question “know someone with
an eating disorder?” could be overlooked due to
the lack of indicative lexical patterns.

These limitations, however, could be allevi-
ated by syntactic features. The syntactic pattern
(SBAR(WHADVP(WRB))(S(NP)(VP))) extracted

Figure 2: An example of common syntactic pat-
terns observed in two different question sentences

from the former example has the order of NP
and VP being switched, which could indicate
the sentence to be a non-question, whereas the
pattern (VP(VB)(NP(NP)(PP))) may be evidence
that
the latter example is indeed a question,
because this pattern is commonly witnessed in
the archived questions. Figure 2 shows an ex-
ample that
two questions bear very different
wordings but share the same questioning pat-
tern (S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB)(NP))) at the syntactic
level.
In view of the above, we argue that pat-
terns at the syntactic level could complement lex-
ical patterns in identifying question sentences.

To our knowledge, the mining of salient pat-
terns at the syntactic level was limited to a few
tasks. Zaki and Aggarwal (2003) employed tree
patterns to classify XML data, Sun et al. (2007)
extracted all frequent sub-tree structures for erro-
neous sentences detection, and Wang et al. (2009)
decomposed the parsing tree into fragments and
used them to match similar questions. Our work
differs from these previous works in that: (1) we
also utilize syntactic patterns for the question de-
tection; and (2) we do not blindly extract all pos-
sible sub-tree structures, but focus only on certain
portions of the parsing tree for better pattern rep-
resentation and extraction efﬁciency.

Given a syntactic tree T , we deﬁne syntac-
tic pattern as a part of sub-structures of T such
that the production rule for each non-leaf node in
the patterns is intact. For example, the pattern
(S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB)(NP))) in Figure 2 is con-
sidered to be a valid syntactic pattern, whereas
(S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB))) is not, since the produc-
tion rule VP→VPB·NP is not strictly complied.
We take the following measures to mine salient
syntactic patterns: First, we limit the depth of
each syntactic pattern to be within a certain range.

Figure 3: Illustration of syntactic pattern extrac-
tion and generalization process

It is believed that the syntax structure will become
too speciﬁc if it is extended to a deeper level or
too general if the depth is too shallow, neither of
which produces good representative patterns. We
therefore set the depth D of each syntactic pattern
to be within a reasonable range (2≤D≤4). Sec-
ond, we prune away all leaf nodes as well as the
production rules at the POS tag level. We believe
that nodes at the bottom levels do not carry much
useful structural information favored by question
detector. For example, the simple grammar rule
NP→DT·NN does not give any insight to use-
ful question structures. Third, we relax the def-
inition of syntactic pattern by allowing the re-
moval of some nodes denoting modiﬁers, prepo-
sition phrases, conjunctions etc. The reason is
that these nodes are not essential in representing
the syntactic patterns and are better excluded for
generalization purpose. Figure 3 gives an illus-
tration of the process for pattern extraction and
generalization.
In this example, several syntac-
tic patterns are generated from the question sen-
tence “How can I quickly tell if my wisdom teeth
are coming?”, and the tree patterns (a) and (b) are
generalized into (a’) and (b’), in which the redun-
dant branch (ADVP(RB)) that represents the ad-
verb “quickly” is detached.

Contents on the Web are prone to noise, and
most off-the-shelf parsers are not well-trained to
parse online questions. For example, the parsing
tree of the question “whats the matter with it?”
will be very different from that of the question
“what is the matter with it?”. It would certainly
be nice to know that “whats” is a widely used
short form of the phrase “what is” on the Web,

but we are lack of this kind of thesaurus. Nev-
ertheless, we argue that the parsing errors would
not hurt the question detector performance much
as long as the mining database is large enough.
The reason is that if certain irregular forms fre-
quently occur on the Web, there will be statisti-
cal evidences that the syntactic patterns derived
from it, though not desired, will commonly occur
as well. In other words, we take the wrong pat-
terns and utilize them to detect questions in the
irregular forms. Our approach differs from other
systems in that we do not intentionally try to rec-
tify the grammatical errors, but leave the errors as
they are and use the statistical based approach to
capture those informal patterns.

The pattern extraction process is outlined in Al-
gorithm 1. The overall mining strategy is analo-
gous to the mining of sequential patterns, where
support and conﬁdence measures are taken into
account to control the signiﬁcance of the mined
patterns. All mined syntactic patterns together
with the lexical patterns will be used as features
for learning the classiﬁcation model.

3 Learning the Classiﬁcation Model

Although Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is
good sequential learning algorithm and has been
used in other related work (Cong et al., 2008),
here we select Support Vector Machines (SVM)
as an alternative learner. The reason is that our
task not only deals with sequential patterns but
also involves syntactic patterns that possess no
sequential criteria. Additionally, SVM has been
widely shown to provide superior results com-
pared to other classiﬁers.

1159

The input to a SVM binary classiﬁer normally
consists of both positive and negative examples.
While it is easy to discover certain patterns from
questions, it is unnatural to identify character-
istics for non-questions, as they usually do not
share such common lexical and syntactic patterns.
The lack of good negative examples leads tra-
ditional SVM to perform poorly. To adapt the
imbalanced input data, we proposed to employ
a one-class SVM method (Manevitz and Yousef,
2002) for learning. The basic idea of one-class
SVM is to transform features from only positive
examples via a kernel to a hyper-plane and treats
the origin as the only member of the second class.
It uses relaxation parameters to separate the posi-
tive examples from the origin, and ﬁnally applies
the standard two-class SVM techniques to learn
a decision boundary. As a result, anything out-
side the boundary are considered to be outliers
(i.e. non-questions in this problem).

More formally, given n training samples
x1, . . . , xn of one class, the hyperplane separating
them from the origin is constructed by solving

min

1
2(cid:5)w(cid:5)2 +

1
νn

ξi − ρ

(1)

n(cid:2)i=1

subject to: w · Φ(xi) ≥ ρ − ξi, where Φ is a ker-
nel function, ξi is the slack variable, and ν is the
parameter controlling the upper bound percentage
of outliers. If w and ρ solve this problem, the de-
cision function f (x) = sign(w·Φ(x)−ρ) will be
positive for most examples xi in the training set.
Supervised learning methods usually require
training data to be manually annotated. To save
labeling efforts, we take a shortcut by treating all
sentences ending with question marks as an initial
positive examples. This assumption is acceptable,
as Cong et al. (2008) reported that the rule-based
method using only question mark achieves a very
high precision of over 97% in detecting questions.
It in turn indicates that questions ending with “?”
are highly reliable to be real questions.

However, the initial training data still contain
many sentences ending with “?” but are not true
questions. These possible outliers will shift the
decision boundary away from the optimal one,
and we need to remove them from the training
dataset for better classiﬁcation. Many prepro-
cessing strategies are available for training data

reﬁnement, including bootstrapping, condensing,
and editing etc. In this work, we employ a SVM-
based data editing and classiﬁcation method pro-
posed by Song et al. (2008), which iteratively sets
a small value to the parameter ν of the one-class
SVM so as to continuously reﬁne the decision
boundary. The algorithm could be better visual-
ized with Figure 4. In each iteration, a new de-
cision boundary will be determined based on the
existing set of data points, and a portion of pos-
sible outliers will be removed from the training
set. It is expected that the learned hyperplane will
eventually be very close to the optimal one.

We use the freely available software LIBSVM2
to conduct the one-class SVM training and test-
ing. A linear kernel is used, as it is shown to be
superior in our experiments. In each reﬁnement
iteration, the parameter ν is conservatively set to
0.02. The number of iteration is dynamically de-
termined according to the algorithm depicted in
(Song et al., 2008). Other parameters are all set to
default. The reﬁned decision boundary from the
training dataset will be applied to classify ques-
tions from non-questions. The question detector
model learned will serve as a component for the
cQA question retrieval system in our experiments.

4 Experiments

In this section, we present empirical evaluation
results to assess the effectiveness of our ques-
tion detection model.
In particular, we ﬁrst ex-
amine the effects of the number of patterns on
question detection performance. We further con-
duct experiments to show that our question de-

tection model combining both lexical and syntac-
tic features outperforms traditional rule-based or
lexical-based methods. We ﬁnally demonstrate
that our question detection model gives additional
performance boosting to question matching.

4.1 Performance Variation over Different

Pattern Sets

The performance of the question detection model
can be sensitive to the number of features used for
learning. To ﬁnd the optimal number of features
used for model training, we examine the perfor-
mance variation over different amount of lexical
and syntactic patterns undertaken for training.

Dataset: We collected a total of around 800k
question threads from Yahoo! Answers Health-
care domain. From the collected data, we gener-
ated the following three datasets:
- Pattern Mining Set: Comprising around 350k
sentences from 60k question threads, where
those ending with “?” are treated as questions
and others as non-questions.

- Training Set: Positive examples comprising
around 130k sentences ending with “?” from
another 60k question threads for the one-class
SVM learning algorithm.

- Testing Set: Two annotators are asked to tag
randomly picked sentences from the remaining
set. A total of 2,004 question sentences and
2,039 non-question sentences are annotated.
Methods & Results: We use different combi-
nations of support and conﬁdence values to gen-
erate different set of patterns. The support value
ranges from 0.40% to 0.55% for lexical patterns

with a step size of 0.05%, and ranges from 0.03%
to 0.06% for syntactic patterns with a step size
of 0.01%. The conﬁdence value for both patterns
ranges from 60% to 80% with a step size of 5%.
These value ranges are empirically determined.
Table 1 presents the number of lexical and syn-
tactic patterns mined against different support and
conﬁdence value combinations.

For each set of lexical or syntactic patterns
mined, we use them as features for model train-
ing. We convert the training sentences into a set
of feature vectors and employ the one-class SVM
algorithm to train a classiﬁer. The classiﬁer will
then be applied to predict the question sentences
in the testing set. To evaluate each question de-
tection model, we employ Precision (P ), Recall
(R), and F1 as performance metrics, and Table 2
presents the results3.

We observe from Table 2 that given a ﬁxed sup-
port level, the precision generally increases with
the conﬁdence level for both lexical and syntactic
patterns, but the recall drops. The lexical feature
set comprising 1,314 sequential patterns as gen-
erated with {sup=0.45%, conf=70%} gives the
best F1 score of 88.7%, and the syntactic feature
set comprising 580 syntactic patterns generated
from {sup=0.04%, conf=65%} gives the best F1
score of 83.7%.
It is noted that the sequential
patterns give relatively high recall while the syn-
tactic patterns give relatively high precision. Our
reading is that the sequential patterns are capable
of capturing most questions, but it may also give
wrong predictions to non-questions such as “Lev-

3The results for certain conﬁdence levels are not very
promising and are not shown in the table due to lack of space.

1161

ator scapulae is used when you do the traps work-
out” that bears the sequential pattern {when, do}.
On the other hand, the syntactic patterns could
give reliable predictions, but its coverage could
suffer due to the limited number of syntactic pat-
terns. We conjecture that a combination of both
features could further improve the performance.

4.2 Performance Comparison with

Traditional Question Detection Methods
We next conduct experiments to compare the per-
formance of our question detection model to tra-
ditional rule-based or lexical-based methods.

Methods & Results: We set up ﬁve different

systems for meaningful comparisons:
1. 5W1H (baseline1): a rule-based method using

5W1H to determine a question sentence.

2. Question Mark (baseline2): a method using the

question mark “?” to judge a question.

3. SeqPattern: Using only the set of 1,314 se-

quential patterns as features.

4. SynPattern: Using only the set of 580 syntactic

patterns as features.

5. SeqPattern+SynPattern: Merging both lexical
and syntactic patterns and use them as a set of
features for question detection.
We again employ Precision (P ), Recall (R),
and F1 as performance metrics to evaluate each
question detection system, and tabulate the com-
parison results in Table 3. From the Table, we
observe that 5W1H performs poorly in both preci-
sion and recall, and question mark based method
gives relatively low recall although the precision
is the highest amongst all the methods evaluated.
This is in line with the results as observed in
(Cong et al., 2008). SeqPattern outperforms the
two baseline systems in both R and F1 scores,
and its combination with SynPattern augments
the performance in both precision and recall by
a lot. It also achieves statistically signiﬁcant im-
proved results (t-test, p-value<0.05) as compared
to other four systems. These results are consistent
with our intuition that syntactic patterns can lever-
age sequential patterns in improving the question
detection performance.

It is noted that SeqPattern+SynPattern exhibits
the highest recall (R) amongst all the systems.
The signiﬁcance test further suggests that many

question sentences miss-detected by 5W1H or
Question Mark method could be properly cap-
tured by our model. This improvement is mean-
ingful, as the question coverage is also an im-
portant factor in the cQA question retrieval task,
where high recall implies that more similar ques-
tions could be matched and returned, hence im-
proving the question retrieval performance.

4.3 Performance Evaluation on Question

Retrieval with Question Detection Model
To further demonstrate that our question detection
model can improve question retrieval, we incor-
porate it into different question retrieval systems.
Methods: We select a simple bag-of-word
(BoW) system retrieving questions at the lexical
level, and a syntactic tree matching (STM) model
matching questions at the syntactic level (Wang et
al., 2009) as two baselines. For each baseline, we
further set up two different combinations:
- Baseline+QM: Using question mark to detect
question sentences, and perform question re-
trieval on top of the detected questions.

- Baseline+QD: Using our proposed model to
detect question sentences, and perform ques-
tion retrieval on top of the detected questions.
This gives rise to additional 4 different system
combinations for comparison.

Dataset: We divide the dataset from Yahoo!
Answers into a question repository set (750k) and
a test set (50k). For the baseline systems, all the
repository sentences containing both questions
and non-questions are indexed, whereas for sys-
tems equipped with QM or QD, only the detected
question sentences are indexed for retrieval. We
randomly select 250 single-sentence questions
from the test set as queries, and for each query, the
retrieval system will return a list of top 10 ques-
tion matches. We combine the retrieved results
from different systems and ask two annotators to
label each result to be either “relevant” or “irrel-

evant” without telling them which system the re-
sult is generated from. By eliminating some query
questions that have no relevant matches, the ﬁnal
testing set contains 214 query questions.

Metrics & Results: We evaluate the question
retrieval performance using two metrics: Mean
Average Precision (MAP) and Top One Precision
(P@1). The results are presented in Table 4.

We can see from Table 4 that STM outper-
forms BoW. Applying QM or QD over BoW and
STM boosts the system performance in terms of
both MAP and P@1. They also achieve statis-
tical signiﬁcance as judged by paired t-test (p-
value<0.05). More speciﬁcally,
the MAP on
QM coupled systems improves by 3.13% and
2.83% respectively over BoW and STM. This is
evidence that having question sentences clearly
identiﬁed could help to retrieve relevant ques-
tions more precisely, as without question detec-
tion, the user query is likely to be matched to ir-
relevant description sentences. Our question de-
tection model (QD) further improves the MAP
by 1.32% and 2.1% respectively over BoW+QM
and STM+QM, and it also yields better top one
precision by correctly retrieving questions at the
ﬁrst position on 136 and 140 questions respec-
tively, out of a total of 214 questions. These im-
provements are in line with our expectation that
our model incorporating salient features at both
the lexical and syntactic levels is comprehensive
enough to capture various forms of questions on-
line, and hence improve the performance of ques-
tion matching.

5 Related Work

Research on detecting question sentences can
generally be classiﬁed into two categories. The
ﬁrst category simply employs rule-based methods
such as question mark, 5W1H words, or hand-

crafted regular expressions to detect questions.
As discussed, these conventional methods are not
adequate to cope with online questions.

The second category uses machine learning ap-
proaches to detect question sentences. Shrestha
and McKeown (2004) proposed a supervised rule
induction method to detect interrogative questions
in email conversations based on part-of-speech
features. Yeh and Yuan (2003) used a statistical
approach to extract a set of question-related words
and derived some syntax and semantic rules to
detect mandarin question sentences. Cong et al.
(2008) extracted labeled sequential patterns and
used them as features to learn a classiﬁer for ques-
tion detection in online forums.

Question pattern mining is also closely related
to the learning of answer patterns. Work on an-
swer patterns includes the web based pattern min-
ing (Zhang and Lee, 2002; Du et al., 2005) and a
combination of syntactic and semantic elements
(Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002) etc.

In contrast to previous work, we do not only fo-
cus on standard language corpus, but extensively
explore characteristics of online questions. Our
approach exploits salient question patterns at both
the lexical and syntactic levels for question detec-
tion. In particular, we employ the one-class SVM
algorithm such that the learning process is weakly
supervised and no human annotation is involved.

6 Conclusion

This paper proposed a new approach to detecting
question sentences in cQA. We mined both lexical
and syntactic question patterns, and used them as
features to build classiﬁcation models. The min-
ing and leaning process is fully automated and re-
quires no human intervention. Empirical evalua-
tion on the cQA archive demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of our model as well as its usefulness in
improving question retrieval performance.

We are still investigating other features that are
helpful to detect questions. One promising direc-
tion for future work is to also employ lexical and
syntactic patterns to other related areas such as
question type classiﬁcation etc. It is also interest-
ing to employ a hybrid of CRF and SVM learning
methods to boost the accuracy and scalability of
the classiﬁer.
