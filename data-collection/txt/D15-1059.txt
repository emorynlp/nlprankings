Abstract

Learning to determine when the time-
varying facts of a Knowledge Base (KB)
have to be updated is a challenging task.
We propose to learn state changing verbs
from Wikipedia edit history. When a
state-changing event, such as a marriage
or death, happens to an entity, the in-
fobox on the entity’s Wikipedia page usu-
ally gets updated. At the same time, the
article text may be updated with verbs ei-
ther being added or deleted to reflect the
changes made to the infobox. We use
Wikipedia edit history to distantly super-
vise a method for automatically learning
verbs and state changes. Additionally, our
method uses constraints to effectively map
verbs to infobox changes. We observe in
our experiments that when state-changing
verbs are added or deleted from an en-
tity’s Wikipedia page text, we can predict
the entity’s infobox updates with 88% pre-
cision and 76% recall. One compelling
application of our verbs is to incorporate
them as triggers in methods for updating
existing KBs, which are currently mostly
static.

1 Introduction

Extracting relational facts between entities and
storing them in knowledge bases (KBs) has been a
topic of active research in recent years. The result-
ing KBs are generally static and are not updated
as the facts change (Suchanek et al., 2007; Carl-
son et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2011; Mitchell et al.,
2015). One possible approach to updating KBs is
to extract facts from dynamic Web content such
as news (Nakashole and Weikum, 2012). In this
paper, we propose to predict state changes caused

by verbs acting on entities in text. This is differ-
ent from simply applying the same text extraction
pipeline, that created the original KB, to dynamic
Web content.

In particular, our approach has the following ad-
vantages: (1) Consider for example the SPOUSE
relation, both marry and divorce are good patterns
for extracting this relation. In our work, we wish
to learn that they cause different state changes.
Thus, we can update the entity’s fact and its tem-
poral scope (Wijaya et al., 2014a). (2) Learning
state changing verbs can pave the way for learn-
ing the ordering of verbs in terms of their pre- and
post-conditions.

Our approach learns state changing verbs from
Wikipedia revision history. In particular, we seek
to establish a correspondence between infobox ed-
its and verbs edits in the same article. The infobox
of a Wikipedia article is a structured box that sum-
marizes an entity as a set of facts (attribute-value
pairs) . Our assumption is that when a state-
changing event happens to an entity e.g., a mar-
riage, its Wikipedia infobox is updated by adding
a new SPOUSE value. At approximately the same
time, the article text might be updated with verbs
that express the event, e.g., X is now married to Y.
Figure 1 is an example of an infobox of an entity
changing at the same time as the article’s main text
to reflect a marriage event.

Wikipedia revision history of many articles can
act as distant supervision data for learning the cor-
respondence between text and infobox changes.
However, these revisions are very noisy. Many in-
fobox slots can be updated when a single event
happens. For example, when a death happens,
slots regarding birth e.g., birthdate, birthplace,
may also be updated or added if they were miss-
ing before. Therefore, our method has to handle
these sources of noise. We leverage logical con-
straints to rule out meaningless mappings between

infobox and text changes.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:

(1) we present an algorithm that uses Wikipedia
edit histories as distantly labeled data to learn
which verbs result in which state changes to en-
tities, and experimentally demonstrate its success,
(2) we make available this set of distantly la-
beled training data on our website1, and (3) we
also make available our learned mappings from
verbs to state changes, as a resource for other re-
searchers, on the same website.

2 Method

2.1 Data Construction

We construct a dataset from Wikipedia edit histo-
ries of person entities whose facts change between
the year 2007 and 2012 (i.e., have at least one fact
in YAGO KB (Suchanek et al., 2007) with a start
or end time in this period). We obtain Wikipedia
URLs of this set of entities P from YAGO and
crawl their article’s revision history. Given a per-
son p, his/her Wikipedia revision history Rp has
a set of ordered dates Tp on which revisions are
made to his/her Wikipedia page (we consider date
granularity). Each revision rp,t ∈ Rp is his/her
Wikipedia page at date t where t ∈ Tp.

Each Wikipedia revision rp,t is a set of infobox
slots Sp,t and textual content Cp,t. Each infobox
slot s ∈ Sp,t is a quadruple, 〈satt, svalue, sstart,
send〉 containing the attribute name (non-empty),
the attribute value, and the start and end time for

1http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ dwijaya/postcondition.html

which this attribute-value pair holds in reality.
A document dp,t in our data set is the difference2

between any two consecutive revisions separated
by more than 24 hours i.e., dp,t = rp,t+2 − rp,t,
where rp,t+2 is the first revision on date t+ 2 and
rp,t is the last revision on date t (as a page can be
revised many times in a day).

A document dp,t is therefore a set of infobox
changes ∆Sp,t and textual changes ∆Cp,t. Each
slot change δs ∈ ∆Sp,t = 〈satt, δsvalue, δsstart,
δsend〉 is prefixed with + or − to indicate whether
they are added or deleted in rp,t+2. Similarly, each
text change δc ∈ ∆Cp,t is prefixed with + or − to
indicate whether they are added or deleted.

For example, in Figure 1, a docu-
ment dkim, 05/23/2014 = rkim,05/25/2014 −
rkim,05/23/2014 is a set of slot changes: 〈SPOUSE,
+“Kanye West”, +“2014”, “ ”〉, 〈PARTNER, −“Kanye
West”, −“2012-present; engaged”, “ ”〉 and a set of
text changes: +“Kardashian and West were married in
May 2014”, −“She began dating West”, −“they became
engaged in October 2013”.

For each dp,t, we use ∆Sp,t to label the docu-
ment and ∆Cp,t to extract features for the docu-
ment. We label dp,t that has a new value or start
time added to its infobox: 〈satt,+δsvalue, ∗, ∗〉 ∈
∆Sp,t or 〈satt, ∗,+δsstart, ∗〉 ∈ ∆Sp,t with the la-
bel begin-satt and label dp,t that has a new end
time added to its infobox: 〈satt, ∗, ∗,+δsend〉 ∈
∆Sp,t with the label end-satt.

The label represents the state change that
2a HTML document obtained by “compare selected revi-

sions” functionality in Wikipedia

519



happens in dp,t. For example, in Figure 1,
dkim, 05/23/2014 is labeled with begin-spouse.

The revision history dataset that we make avail-
able for future research consists of all documents
dp,t, labeled and unlabeled, ∀t ∈ Tp, t ∈
[01/01/2007, 12/31/2012], and ∀p ∈ P ; a to-
tal of 288,184 documents from revision histories
of 16,909 Wikipedia entities. Using our labeling
process, we find that out of 288,184 documents,
only 41,139 have labels (i.e., have their infobox
updated with new values/start/end time). The dis-
tribution of labels in the dataset is skewed towards
birth and death events as these are life events that
happen to almost all person entities in Wikipedia.
The distribution of labels in the dataset that we re-
lease can be seen in Figure 2. We show only labels
that we evaluate in our task.

For our task of learning state changing verbs
from this revision history dataset, for each la-
beled dp,t, we extract as features, verbs (or
verbs+prepositions) v ∈ ∆Cp,t of which its sub-
ject (or object) matches the Wikipedia entity p
and its object (or subject resp.) matches an in-
fobox value, start or end time: (vsubject, vobject) =
(arg1, arg2) or (vsubject, vobject) = (arg2, arg1), where
arg1= p and 〈satt,arg2, ∗, ∗〉 or 〈satt, ∗,arg2, ∗〉
or 〈satt, ∗, ∗,arg2〉 ∈ ∆Sp,t. We use Stanford
CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) to dependency
parse sentences and extract the subjects and ob-
jects of verbs. We find that 27,044 out of the
41,139 labeled documents contain verb edits, but
only 4,735 contain verb edits with two arguments,
where one argument matches the entity and an-
other matches the value of the infobox change. We
use the latter for our task, to improve the chance
that the verb edits used as features are related to
the infobox change.

2.2 Model

We use a Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) clas-
sifier3 given a set of training data = {(vd` , y)}
where vd` = (v1, v2, ... v|V |) ∈ R|V | is the |V |-
dimensional representation of a labeled document
d` where V is the set of all verbs in our training
data, and y is the label of d` as defined in 2.1.

These training documents are used to estimate a
set of weight vectors w = {w1, w2, ... w|Y |}, wy
∈ R|V |, one for each label y ∈ Y , the set of all

3We use MALLET implementation of MAXENT:
http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/

labels in our training data. The classifier can then
be applied to classify an unlabeled document du
using:

p(y|vdu) =
exp(wy · vdu)∑
y′ exp(wy′ · vdu)

(1)

2.3 Feature Selection using Constraints

While feature weights from the MAXENT model
allow us to identify verbs that are good features
for predicting a particular state change label, our
distantly supervised training data is inherently
noisy. Changes to multiple infoboxes can hap-
pen within our revision. We therefore utilize con-
straints among state changes to select consistent
verb features for each type of state change.

We use two types of constraints: (1) mutual ex-
clusion (Mutex) which indicate that mutex state
changes do not happen at the same time e.g., up-
date on birthdate should not typically happen with
update on deathcause. Hence, their state changing
verbs should be different. (2) Simultaneous (Sim)
constraints which indicate that simultaneous state
changes should typically happen at the same time
e.g., update on birthdate should typically happen
with other birth-related updates such as birthplace,
birthname, etc. We manually specified these two
types of constraints to all pairs infoboxes where
they apply. We have 10 mutex constraints and 23
simultaneously updated constraints. The full list
of constraints can be found in our website.

Given a set of constraints, a set of labels Y ,
and a set of base verbs4 B in our training data,
we solve a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) for each
base verb b ∈ B to estimate whether b should be a
feature for state change y ∈ Y .

We obtain label membership probabilities
{P (y|b) = count(y, b)/∑y′ count(y′, b)} from
our training data. The MIP takes the scores P (y|b)
and constraints as input and produces a bit vector
of labels ab as output, each bit ayb ∈ {0, 1} repre-
sents whether or not b should be a feature for y.

The MIP formulation for a base verb b is pre-
sented by Equation 2. For each b, this method tries
to maximize the sum of scores of selected labels,
after penalizing for violation of label constraints.
Let ζy,y′ be slack variables for Sim constraints, and
ξy,y′ be slack variables for Mutex constraints.

Figure 2: Distribution of labels we evaluate in our task in the revision history dataset.

Solving MIP per base verb is fast; we reduce the
number of labels considered per base verb i.e., we
only consider a label y to be a candidate for b if
∃ vi ∈ V s.t. wiy > 0 and b = base form of vi.

After we output ab for each b, we select features
for each label. We only select a verb vi to be a
feature for y if the learned weight wiy > 0 and
ayb = 1, where b = the base form of vi. Essentially
for each label, we select verb features that have
positive weights and are consistent for the label.

3 Experiments

We use 90% of our labeled documents that have
verb edits as features (section 2.1) as training data
and test on the remaining 10%. Since revision his-
tory data is noisy, we manually go through our test
data to discard documents that have incorrect in-
fobox labels by looking the text that changed. The
task is to predict for each document (revision), the
label (infobox slot change) of the document given
its verbs features. We compute precision, recall,

values before and after feature selection (Fig. 3).

To the best of our knowledge, the task to learn
state-changing verbs in terms of states defined
in existing knowledge bases and learning it from
Wikipedia edit histories is novel. There is no pre-
vious approach that can be used as baseline; there-
fore we have compared our structured prediction
using MIP and MAXENT with a majority class
baseline. Both our approaches (MAXENT and
MAXENT + MIP) perform better than the majority
class baseline (Figure 3).

We observe the value of doing feature selec-
tion by asserting constraints in an MIP formula-
tion. Feature selection improves precision; re-
sulting in a better F1. By asserting constraints,

selection, the verbs: “marry”, and “be married

spouse and end-spouse. After asserting constraints
that begin-spouse is mutex with end-spouse, these
verbs (whose base form is “marry”) are filtered out
from the features of end-spouse. We show some of
the learned verb features (after feature selection)

we have about 18 verbs per infobox state change
in our state changing verb resource that we make
available for future research.

4 Related Work

Learning from Wikipedia Revision History.
Wikipedia edit history has been exploited in a
number of problems. A popular task in this re-
gard is that of Wikipedia edit history categoriza-
tion (Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2013). This task
involves characterizing a given edit instance as one
of many possible categories such as spelling error
correction, paraphrasing, vandalism, and textual
entailment (Nelken and Yamangil, 2008; Cahill et
al., 2013; Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010; Re-
casens et al., 2013). Prior methods target various
tasks different from ours.

Learning State Changing Verbs. Very few
works have studied the problem of learning state
changing verbs. (Hosseini et al., 2014) learned
state changing verbs in the context of solving
arithmetic word problems. They learned the effect
of words such as add, subtract on the current state.

The VerbOcean resource was automatically gener-
ated from the Web (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
The authors studied the problem of fine-grained
semantic relationships between verbs. They learn
relations such as if someone has bought an item,
they may sell it at a later time. This then involves
capturing empirical regularities such as “X buys
Y” happens before “X sells Y”. Unlike the work
we present here, the methods of (Chklovski and
Pantel, 2004; Hosseini et al., 2014) do not make a
connection to KB relations such as Wikipedia in-
foboxes. In a vision paper, (Wijaya et al., 2014b)
give high level descriptions of a number of possi-
ble methods for learning state changing methods.
They did not implement any of them.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we presented a method that learns
state changing verb phrases from Wikipedia revi-
sion history. We first constructed and curated a
novel dataset from Wikipedia revision history that
is tailored to our task. We showed that this dataset
is useful for learning verb phrase features that are
effective for predicting state changes in the knowl-
edge base (KB), where we considered the KB to
be infoboxes and their values. As future work we
wish to explore the usefulness of our verb resource
to other KBs to improve KB freshness. This is im-
portant because existing KBs are mostly static. We
wish to also explore the application of the learned
verb resource to domains other than Wikipedia in-
fobox and text e.g., for predicting state changes in
the knowledge base from news text.

In this paper, we learned post-conditions of
verbs: state changes that occur when an event ex-
pressed by a verb happens. As future work we
would also explore the feasibility of learning pre-
conditions of verbs from Wikipedia revisions. Ad-
ditionally, most Wikipedia revisions only have text
changes without the associated infobox change.
Therefore, another line of future work is to also
learn from these unlabeled documents.
