This article presents an ensemble parse approach to detecting and selecting high-quality lin-
guistic analyses output by a hand-crafted HPSG grammar of Spanish implemented in the LKB
system. The approach uses full agreement (i.e., exact syntactic match) along with a MaxEnt parse
selection model and a statistical dependency parser trained on the same data. The ultimate goal
is to develop a hybrid corpus annotation methodology that combines fully automatic annotation
and manual parse selection, in order to make the annotation task more efficient while maintaining
high accuracy and the high degree of consistency necessary for any foreseen uses of a treebank.

1. Introduction

Treebanks constitute a crucial resource for theoretical linguistic investigations as well
as for NLP applications. Thus, in the past decades, there has been increasing interest in
their construction and both theory-neutral and theory-grounded treebanks have been
developed for a great variety of languages. Descriptions of available annotated corpora
can be found in Abeillé (2003) and in the proceedings from the annual editions of the
International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories.

Quantity and quality are two very important objectives when building a treebank,
but speed and low labor costs are also required. In addition, guaranteeing consis-
tency, that is, that the same phenomena receive the same annotation through the corpus,
is crucial for any of the possible uses of the treebank. The first attempts at treebank
projects used manual annotation mainly and devoted many hours of human labor
to their construction. Human annotation is not only slow and expensive, but it also
introduces errors and inconsistencies because of the difficulty and tiring nature of the

task.1 Therefore, automating parts of the annotation process aims to leverage effective-
ness, producing a larger number of high-quality and consistent analyses in shorter time
and using fewer resources.

This article presents research that attempts to increase the degree of automation in
the annotation process when constructing a large treebank for Spanish (the IULA Span-
ish LSP Treebank) in the framework of the European project METANET4U (Enhancing
the European Linguistic Infrastructure, GA 270893GA).2

The treebank was developed using the following bootstrapping approach, details
of which are presented in Sections 3 and 4:

� First, we annotated the sentences using the DELPH-IN development
framework, in which the annotation process is effected by manually
selecting the correct parses from among all the analyses produced by a
hand-built symbolic grammar.

� Second, when a number of human-validated parsed sentences were
available, we trained a MaxEnt ranker.

� Third, we trained a dependency parser with the human-validated parsed
sentences converted to the CoNLL format.

� Fourth, we provided a fully automated chain based on an ensemble
method that compared the parse delivered by the dependency parser and
the one delivered by the MaxEnt ranker, and then accepted the
automatically proposed analysis, but only if both were identical.

� Fifth, sentences rejected by the ensemble were given to human annotators
for manual disambiguation.

Obviously, using fully automatic parsing would have been the best solution for
speed and consistency, but no statistical parsers for Spanish are good enough yet, and
when using symbolic parsers, there is no way to separate good parses from incorrect
ones. The ensemble method we propose is a way of avoiding monitoring automatic
parsing; the error is more than acceptable and recall is expected to be augmented by
re-training and the refinement of the different parses.

After this introduction, Section 2 presents an overview of related work on automatic
parse selection, Section 3 summarizes the set-up, Section 4 presents our experiments and
results and, finally, Section 5 concludes.

2. Related Work

In the broadest sense, this work is situated with respect to research into automatic
parse selection. Such projects have had a variety of different goals as well as dif-
ferent approaches, based on (i) semantic filtering techniques (Yates, Schoenmackers,
and Etzioni 2006), (ii) sentence-level features (e.g., length; Kawahara and Uchimoto

1 In order to control errors, a common strategy is to control inter-annotator agreement by making two
annotators work on the same sentences. This makes the task even slower and more expensive.

2 The IULA Spanish LSP Treebank contains 43,000 annotated sentences, distributed among different
domains (Law, Economy, Computing Science, Medicine, and Environment) and sentence lengths
(ranging from 4 to 30 words). The treebank is publicly available at http://metashare.upf.edu.

2008), (iii) statistics about PoS sequences in a batch of parsed sentences (Reichart and
Rappoport 2009), and (iv) ensemble parse algorithms (Reichart and Rappoport 2007;
Sagae and Tsujii 2007; Baldridge and Osborne 2003). Here, we focus on ensemble
approaches.

Reichart and Rappoport (2007) selected high-quality constituency parses by
using the level of agreement among 20 copies of the same parser, trained on dif-
ferent subsets of a training corpus. Experiments using training and test data for the
same domain and in the parser-adaptation scenario showed improvements over several
baselines.

Sagae and Tsujii (2007) used an ensemble to select high-quality dependency parses.
They compared the outputs of two statistical shift-reduce LR models and selected only
identical parses, in their case to retrain the MaxEnt model. Following this procedure,
they achieved the highest score in the domain adaptation track of the CoNLL 2007
shared task.

Finally, Baldridge and Osborne (2003) used an ensemble of parsers in the con-
text of HPSG grammars applied to committee-based active learning, that is, to select
the most informative sentences to be hand-annotated and used as training material
to improve the statistical parser and to minimize the required amount of such sen-
tences. Using the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger 2002) and the Redwoods
treebank (Oepen et al. 2002), they showed that sample selection according to preferred
parse disagreement between two different machine learning algorithms (log-linear
and perceptron), or between the same algorithm trained on two independent feature
sets (configurational and ngram sets, based on the HPSG derivation trees), reduced the
amount of human-annotated material needed to train an HPSG parse selection model
compared with a certainty-based method based on tree entropy and several baseline
selection metrics.

Like Baldridge and Osborne (2003), we investigate ensemble parsing in the context
of HPSG grammars; however, our goal does not involve selecting the most informative
sentences to retrain the parser, but rather to select those sentences most reliably parsed,
in order to enlarge the treebank automatically. Thus, rather than selecting sentences on
which two models disagree, we select those where they agree completely. In addition,
we present two important contributions, going beyond what has been done in previous
work. First, although parsing ensembles have previously been proposed only for closely
related language models (i.e., parsers that use algorithms under the machine-learning
paradigm, varying only the feature set or training data), the presented work is the
first to combine parsers from different paradigms: stochastic dependency parsing and
MaxEnt parse selection over parses produced by a symbolic grammar. Second, the
current work is the first to propose such a methodology for parse selection as a way of
overcoming the seemingly impossible task of automatically selecting good parses from
automatic parsing to speed treebank production and, more importantly, to meet the
requirements of high precision and high consistency that are good for all of the uses of
the treebank.

3. Set-up

We select high-quality HPSG analyses using full agreement among a MaxEnt parse
selection model and a dependency parser. A comparison between the two is performed
on the dependency structures that we obtain converting the parse tree produced by a
symbolic grammar to the CoNLL format.

3.1 HPSG Parsing and Disambiguation

Our investigation uses the Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG Initiative (DELPH-
IN),3 an open-source processing framework also used in several treebank projects
within this international initiative (Oepen et al. 2002; Flickinger et al. 2012). Using this
framework, the annotation process is divided into two parts: (1) the corpus is parsed
using a hand-built HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994); (2) the grammar output is ranked by
a MaxEnt-based parse ranker (Toutanova et al. 2005), and the best parse is manually
selected.

The grammar applied in parsing is a broad-coverage, open-source Spanish gram-
mar implemented in the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) system (Copestake 2002),
the Spanish Resource Grammar (SRG) (Marimon 2013).

The manual selection task is performed with an interface provided as part of the
[incr tstb()] grammar profiling environment (Oepen and Carroll 2000) that allows the
annotator to reduce the set of parses incrementally by choosing so-called discriminants
(Carter 1997); that is, by selecting the features that distinguish between the different
parses, until the appropriate parse is left or, if none of the displayed parses is the correct
one, all parses are rejected.

As always the case with symbolic grammars, the SRG produces several hundreds
of analyses for a sentence. The DELPH-IN framework, however, provides a MaxEnt-
based ranker that sorts the parses produced by the grammar. Although this stochastic
ranker cannot be used to select automatically the correct parse without introducing a
considerable number of errors (as we will show, it only achieves accuracy of about 61%),
it nevertheless allows the annotator to reduce the forest to the n-best trees, typically the
500 top readings. The statistics that form the model of the MaxEnt ranker are gathered
from disambiguated parses and can be updated as the number of annotated sentences
increases.

3.2 Conversion to the CoNLL Format

The linguistic analysis produced by the LKB system for each parsed sentence provides,
together with a constituent structure and a Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) seman-
tic representation (Copestake et al. 2005), a derivation tree, obtained from a complete
syntactico-semantic analysis represented in a parse tree with standard HPSG-typed
feature structures at each node.

The derivation tree is encoded in a nested, parenthesized structure whose ele-
ments correspond to the identifiers of grammatical rules and the lexical items used
in parsing. Phrase structure rules—marked by the suffix ‘ c’ (for ‘construction’)—
identify the daughter sequence, separated by a hyphen, and, in headed-phrase con-
structions, a basic dependency relation between sentence constituents (e.g., subject-
head (sb-hd) and head-complement (hd-cmp)). Lexical items are annotated with
part-of-speech information according to the EAGLES tag set for Spanish4 and their
lexical entry identifier, and they optionally include a lexical rule identifier. Figure 1
shows an example.

In order to compare the first-best trees selected by the MaxEnt selection model and
the outputs of the dependency parser, we convert the derivation trees to a dependency

format, also illustrated in Figure 1. In this target annotation, lexical elements are linked
by asymmetrical dependency relations in which one of the elements is considered
the head of the relation and the other one is its dependant. The conversion is a fully
automatic and unambiguous process that produces the dependency structure in the
CoNLL format (Buchholz and Marsi 2006). A deterministic conversion algorithm
makes use of the identifiers of the phrase structure rules mentioned previously, in
order to identify the heads, dependants, and some dependency types that are directly
transferred onto the dependency structure (e.g., subject, specifier, and modifier). The
identifiers of the lexical entries, which include the syntactic category of the sub-
categorized elements, enable the identification of the argument-related dependency
functions.5

3.3 Dependency Parsing

For dependency parsing, we use MaltParser (Nivre et al. 2007). To train it, we use
manually disambiguated parses among those parses produced by the HPSG grammar,
converted to the dependency format we describe earlier.

5 An alternative proposal for projecting HPSG trees to CoNLL is described in Ivanova et al. (2012).

4. Experiments and Results

In our experiments, we tested the ability of the ensemble approach to select only correct
parses. The experiment proceeded as follows:

� We divided a set of 15,329 sentences into a training and test set (13,901 and
1,428 sentences, respectively). Sentence length ranged from 4 to 20 words
(longer sentences had not been annotated yet).

� We trained the MaxEnt model and MaltParser and ran each of the models
on the test set. The results we achieved are displayed in Table 1.

� We compared the outputs of the two models and selected those sentences
where both parses produced identical analyses.

The performance of our parser ensemble approach was measured through precision
and recall on the task of selecting those sentences for which the first tree proposed by
the MaxEnt model was the correct one. Table 2 shows the confusion matrix resulting
from the experiment. The row predicted ok counts the number of sentences selected
by our ensemble method (Malt and MaxEnt delivered parses are identical), and the
row predicted nok contains the number of sentences not selected because the parsers
disagreed. Columns gold present the manual evaluation of a MaxEnt model first ranked
parse. From this table, we can compute precision and recall of our sentence selector:
445 sentences were selected out of the 1,428 sentences in the test set (31.2%). Precision
(number of correctly selected sentences among all the selected sentences) stood at 90.6%
(403/445), and recall (number of correctly selected sentences among all the actually
correctly ranked first sentences) was 46.6% (403/864).

We compared the results of our ensemble method with two parse selection methods
based on: (i) a simple probability-based threshold (baseline) and (ii) a parser uncertainty
measure computed as tree entropy as used by Baldridge and Osborne (2003). The baseline
consisted of selecting sentences for which the ratio between the probabilities of the two
highest ranked analyses delivered by the MaxEnt model was over a given threshold.

The idea was that a very high ratio would indicate that the parse ranked first had a
large advantage over the others, whereas if the ratio was close to 1, both the first and
the second analyses would have similar probabilities, indicating lower confidence of the
model in the decision. Tree entropy takes into account not just the two highest ranked
analyses, but all trees proposed by the parser for that sentence. The rationale is that
high entropy indicates a scattered probability distribution among possible trees (and
thus less certainty of the model in the prediction), whereas low entropy should indicate
that one tree (or a few) gets most of the probability mass.

Results for different thresholds (both for the baseline and tree entropy) are shown
in Table 3 (top). As we can see, setting a high threshold for the baseline, we can select a
small subset of 20% of the sentences with precision similar to that achieved by our parse
ensemble approach. To select 31% of the sentences (i.e., about the same proportion we
obtained with the ensemble approach) we need to set a threshold of 4.5, obtaining a
precision of 84%, which is lower than the 90% obtained with the ensemble method.

Tree entropy exhibits similar behavior, in that a restrictive threshold can select
about 15% of sentences with precision over 90%, while setting a threshold such that
about 31% of sentences are selected, we obtain precision of about 75%.

Note that although the baseline has an F1 score slightly higher than the ensemble,
our goal is a high precision filter that can be utilized to select correctly parsed sentences.
From this point of view, our approach beats both baselines.

The fact that tree entropy yields worse values than the baseline is somehow pre-
dictable: Given a sentence with n possible trees (note that n may be in the order of
dozens or even hundreds), if a small number m of those analyses (1 < m << n) concen-
trate a large portion of probability mass but exhibit small differences between them, the
sentence will be rejected by the baseline (because there is not enough distance between
the first and second analyses) but will be accepted by tree entropy (because entropy will
be relatively low, given the large value of n). Thus, tree entropy is a good measure for
Baldridge and Osborne (2003), whose purpose is to select sentences where the model
is less confident, but our simple baseline seems to be better when the goal is to select
sentences where the first parse is the correct one.

As shown in Table 3 (bottom), behavior is different for sentences of up to 10 words
than for longer sentences. All three systems have a bias towards selecting short rather
than long sentences (because short sentences are more often correctly analyzed by the
parser). The results for short sentences are similar in all three cases, but the ensemble
approach is clearly more precise for long sentences, with only a moderate loss in recall.

5. Conclusion

We have described research that aims to increase the degree of automation when
building annotated corpora. We propose a parser ensemble approach based on full
agreement between a MaxEnt model and a dependency parser to select correct linguistic
analyses output by an HPSG grammar. This enables a hybrid annotation methodology
that combines fully automatic annotation and manual parse selection, which makes the
annotation task more efficient while maintaining high accuracy and the high degree of
consistency necessary for a useful treebank. Our approach is grammar-independent and
can be used by any DELPH-IN-style treebank. In the future, we plan to investigate the
impact of automatic treebank enlargement on the performance of statistical parsers.
