Abstract

This paper presents the results of the WMT11
shared tasks, which included a translation
task, a system combination task, and a task for
machine translation evaluation metrics. We
conducted a large-scale manual evaluation of
148 machine translation systems and 41 sys-
tem combination entries. We used the rank-
ing of these systems to measure how strongly
automatic metrics correlate with human judg-
ments of translation quality for 21 evaluation
metrics. This year featured a Haitian Creole
to English task translating SMS messages sent
to an emergency response service in the af-
termath of the Haitian earthquake. We also
conducted a pilot ‘tunable metrics’ task to test
whether optimizing a fixed system to differ-
ent metrics would result in perceptibly differ-
ent translation quality.

1 Introduction

This paper presents the results of the shared tasks
of the Workshop on statistical Machine Translation
(WMT), which was held at EMNLP 2011. This
workshop builds on five previous WMT workshops
(Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al.,
2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch
et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010). The work-
shops feature three shared tasks: a translation task
between English and other languages, a task to com-
bine the output of multiple machine translation sys-
tems, and a task to predict human judgments of
translation quality using automatic evaluation met-
rics. The performance for each of these shared tasks
is determined through a comprehensive human eval-

uation. There were a two additions to this year’s
workshop that were not part of previous workshops:

• Haitian Creole featured task – In addition to
translation between European language pairs,
we featured a new translation task: translating
Haitian Creole SMS messages that were sent
to an emergency response hotline in the im-
mediate aftermath of the 2010 Haitian earth-
quake. The goal of this task is to encourage re-
searchers to focus on challenges that may arise
in future humanitarian crises. We invited Will
Lewis, Rob Munro and Stephan Vogel to pub-
lish a paper about their experience developing
translation technology in response to the crisis
(Lewis et al., 2011). They provided the data
used in the Haitian Creole featured translation
task. We hope that the introduction of this new
dataset will provide a testbed for dealing with
low resource languages and the informal lan-
guage usage found in SMS messages.

• Tunable metric shared task – We conducted
a pilot of a new shared task to use evaluation
metrics to tune the parameters of a machine
translation system. Although previous work-
shops have shown evaluation metrics other than
BLEU are more strongly correlated with human
judgments when ranking outputs from multiple
systems, BLEU remains widely used by system
developers to optimize their system parameters.
We challenged metric developers to tune the
parameters of a fixed system, to see if their met-
rics would lead to perceptibly better translation
quality for the system’s resulting output.

The primary objectives of WMT are to evaluate
the state of the art in machine translation, to dissem-
inate common test sets and public training data with
published performance numbers, and to refine eval-
uation methodologies for machine translation. As
with previous workshops, all of the data, transla-
tions, and collected human judgments are publicly
available.1 We hope these datasets form a valuable
resource for research into statistical machine transla-
tion, system combination, and automatic evaluation
of translation quality.

2 Overview of the Shared Translation and
System Combination Tasks

The recurring task of the workshop examines trans-
lation between English and four other languages:
German, Spanish, French, and Czech. We created a
test set for each language pair by translating newspa-
per articles. We additionally provided training data
and two baseline systems.

2.1 Test data
The test data for this year’s task was created by
hiring people to translate news articles that were
drawn from a variety of sources from early Decem-
ber 2010. A total of 110 articles were selected, in
roughly equal amounts from a variety of Czech, En-
glish, French, German, and Spanish news sites:2

Czech: aktualne.cz (4), Novinky.cz (7), iH-
Ned.cz (4), iDNES.cz (4)

French: Canoe (5), Le Devoir (5), Le Monde (5),
Les Echos (5), Liberation (5)

Spanish: ABC.es (6), Cinco Dias (6), El Period-
ico (6), Milenio (6), Noroeste (7)

English: Economist (4), Los Angeles Times (6),
New York Times (4), Washington Post (4)

German: FAZ (3), Frankfurter Rundschau (2), Fi-
nancial Times Deutschland (3), Der Spie-
gel (5), Süddeutsche Zeitung (3)

The translations were created by the professional
translation agency CEET.3 All of the translations

were done directly, and not via an intermediate lan-
guage.

Although the translations were done profession-
ally, in some cases errors still cropped up. For in-
stance, in parts of the English-French translations,
some of the English source remains in the French
reference as if the translator forgot to delete it.

2.2 Training data

As in past years we provided parallel corpora to train
translation models, monolingual corpora to train lan-
guage models, and development sets to tune system
parameters. Some statistics about the training mate-
rials are given in Figure 1.

2.3 Baseline systems

To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to
the field, we provided two open source toolkits for
phrase-based and parsing-based statistical machine
translation (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010).

2.4 Submitted systems

We received submissions from 56 groups across 37
institutions, as listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. We also
included two commercial off-the-shelf MT systems,
two online statistical MT systems, and five online
rule-based MT systems. (Not all systems supported
all language pairs.) We note that these nine compa-
nies did not submit entries themselves, and are there-
fore anonymized in this paper. Rather, their entries
were created by translating the test data via their web
interfaces.4 The data used to construct these systems
is not subject to the same constraints as the shared
task participants. It is possible that part of the refer-
ence translations that were taken from online news
sites could have been included in the online systems’
models, for instance. We therefore categorize all
commercial systems as unconstrained when evalu-
ating the results.

2.5 System combination

In total, we had 148 primary system entries (includ-
ing the 46 entries crawled from online sources), and
60 contrastive entries. These were made available to

4We would like to thank Ondřej Bojar for harvesting the
commercial entries (2), Christian Federmann for the statistical
MT entries (14), and Hervé Saint-Amand for the rule-based MT
entries (30)!

Continuing our practice from last year’s workshop,
we separated the test set into a tuning set and a final
held-out test set for system combinations. The tun-
ing portion was distributed to system combination
participants along with reference translations, to aid
them set any system parameters.

In the European language pairs, the tuning set
consisted of 1,003 segments taken from 37 docu-
ments, whereas the test set consisted of 2,000 seg-
ments taken from 73 documents. In the Haitian Cre-
ole task, the split was 674 segments for tuning and
600 for testing.

Table 2 lists the 10 participants in the system com-
bination task.

3 Featured Translation Task

The featured translation task of WMT11 was to
translate Haitian Creole SMS messages into En-
glish. These text messages were sent by people in
Haiti in the aftermath of the January 2010 earth-
quake. In the wake of the earthquake, much of the
country’s conventional emergency response services
failed. Since cell phone towers remained stand-
ing after the earthquake, text messages were a vi-
able mode of communication. Munro (2010) de-
scribes how a text-message-based emergency report-
ing system was set up by a consortium of volunteer
organizations named “Mission 4636” after a free
SMS short code telephone number that they estab-
lished. The SMS messages were routed to a system
for reporting trapped people and other emergencies.

Search and rescue teams within Haiti, including the
US Military, recognized the quantity and reliabil-
ity of actionable information in these messages and
used them to provide aid.

The majority of the SMS messages were writ-
ten in Haitian Creole, which was not spoken by
most of first responders deployed from overseas.
A distributed, online translation effort was estab-
lished, drawing volunteers from Haitian Creole- and
French-speaking communities around the world.
The volunteers not only translated messages, but
also categorized them and pinpointed them on a
map.5 Collaborating online, they employed their lo-
cal knowledge of locations, regional slang, abbre-
viations and spelling variants to process more than
40,000 messages in the first six weeks alone. First
responders indicated that this volunteer effort helped
to save hundreds of lives and helped direct the first
food and aid to tens of thousands. Secretary of State
Clinton described one success of the Mission 4636
program:“The technology community has set up in-
teractive maps to help us identify needs and target
resources. And on Monday, a seven-year-old girl
and two women were pulled from the rubble of a
collapsed supermarket by an American search-and-
rescue team after they sent a text message calling
for help.” Ushahidi@Tufts described another:“The
World Food Program delivered food to an informal
camp of 2500 people, having yet to receive food or
water, in Diquini to a location that 4636 had identi-

effort in the aftermath of the earthquake (Lacey-Hall, 2011).

fied for them.”

In parallel with Rob Munro’s crowdsourcing
translation efforts, the Microsoft Translator team de-
veloped a Haitian Creole statistical machine transla-
tion engine from scratch in a compressed timeframe
(Lewis, 2010). Despite the impressive number
of translations completed by volunteers, machine
translation was viewed as a potentially useful tool
for higher volume applications or to provide trans-
lations of English medical documents into Haitian
Creole. The Microsoft Translator team quickly as-
sembled parallel data from a number of sources,
including Mission 4636 and from the archives of
Carnegie Mellon’s DIPLOMAT project (Frederking
et al., 1997). Through a series of rapid prototyp-
ing efforts, the team improved their system to deal
with non-standard orthography, reduced pronouns,
and SMS shorthand. They deployed a functional
translation system to relief workers in the field in
less than 5 days – impressive even when measured
against previous rapid MT development efforts like
DARPA’s surprise language exercise (Oard, 2003;
Oard and Och, 2003).

We were inspired by the efforts of Rob Munro and
Will Lewis on translating Haitian Creole in the af-
termath of the disaster, so we worked with them to
create a featured task at WMT11. We thank them for
generously sharing the data they assembled in their
own efforts. We invited Rob Munro, Will Lewis,
and Stephan Vogel to speak at the workshop on the
topic of developing translation technology for future

crises, and they recorded their thoughts in an invited
publication (Lewis et al., 2011).

3.1 Haitian Creole Data

For the WMT11 featured translation task, we
anonymized the SMS Haitian Creole messages
along with the translations that the Mission 4636
volunteers created. Examples of these messages are
given in Table 4. The goal of anonymizing the SMS
data was so that it may be shared with researchers
who are developing translation and mapping tech-
nologies to support future emergency relief efforts
and social development. We ask that any researcher
working with these messages to be aware that they
are actual communications sent by people in need in
a time of crisis. Researchers who use this data are
asked to be cognizant of the following:

• Some messages may be distressing in content.

• The people who sent the messages (and who
are discussed in them) were victims of a natural
disaster and a humanitarian crisis. Please treat
the messages with the appropriate respect for
these individuals.

• The primary motivation for using this data
should be to understand how we can better re-
spond to future crises.

Participants who received the Haitian Creole data
for WMT11 were given anonymization guidelines

alongside the SMS data. The WMT organizers re-
quested that if they discovered messages with incor-
rect or incomplete anonymization, that they notify
us and correct the anonymization using the version
control repository.

To define the shared translation task, we divided
the SMS messages into an in-domain training set,
along with designated dev, devtest, and test sets. We
coordinated with Microsoft and CMU to make avail-
able additional out-of-domain parallel corpora. De-
tails of the data are given in Table 5. In addition
to this data, participants in the featured task were
allowed to use any of the data provided in the stan-
dard translation task, as well as linguistic tools such
as taggers, parsers, or morphological analyzers.

3.2 Clean and Raw Test Data

We provided two sets of testing and development
data. Participants used their systems to translate two
test sets consisting of 1,274 unseen Haitian Creole
SMS messages. One of the test sets contains the
“raw” SMS messages as they were sent, and the
other contains messages that were cleaned up by hu-
man post-editors. The English side is the same in
both cases, and the only difference is the Haitian
Creole input sentences.

The post-editors were Haitian Creole language
informants hired by Microsoft Research. They pro-

vided a number of corrections to the SMS messages,
including expanding SMS shorthands, correcting
spelling/grammar/capitalization, restoring diacritics
that were left out of the original message, and
cleaning up accented characters that were lost when
the message was transmitted in the wrong encoding.

tim yo nan tranbleman de té a,ki kité poto-
prins ki vini nan provins- mwen ede ak ti

For the test and development sets the informants
also edited the English translations. For instance,
there were cases where the original crowdsourced
translation summarized the content of the message
instead of translating it, instances where parts of
the source were omitted, and where explanatory
notes were added. The editors improved the trans-
lations so that they were more suitable for machine
translation, making them more literal, correcting
disfluencies on the English side, and retranslating
them when they were summaries.

Crowdsourced English translation:

We are in the area of Petit Goave, we
would like .... we need tents and medi-
cation for flu/colds...

Post-edited translation:

We are in the area of Petit Goave, we
would like to receive assistance, however,

29



it should not be the way I see the Minus-
tah guys are handling the people. We need
lots of tents and medication for flu/colds,
and fever

The edited English is provided as the reference for
both the “clean” and the “raw” sets, since we intend
that distinction to refer to the form that the source
language comes in, rather than the target language.

Tables 47 and 48 in the Appendix show a signifi-
cant difference in the translation quality between the
clean and the raw test sets. In most cases, systems’
output for the raw condition was 4 BLEU points
lower than for the clean condition. We believe that
the difference in performance on the raw vs. cleaned
test sets highlight the importance of handling noisy
input data.

All of the in-domain training data is in the raw for-
mat. The original SMS messages are unaltered, and
the translations are just as the volunteered provided
them. In some cases, the original SMS messages are
written in French or English instead of Haitian Cre-
ole, or contain a mixture of languages. It may be
possible to further improve the quality of machine
translation systems trained from this data by improv-
ing the quality of the data itself.

3.3 Goals and Challenges

The goals of the Haitian Creole to English transla-
tion task were:

• To focus researchers on the problems presented
by low resource languages

• To provide a real-world data set consisting of
SMS messages, which contain abbreviations,
non-standard spelling, omitted diacritics, and
other noisy character encodings

• To develop techniques for building translation
systems that will be useful in future crises

There are many challenges in translating noisy
data in a low resource language, and there are a vari-
ety of strategies that might be considered to attempt
to tackle them. For instance:

• Automated cleaning of the raw (noisy) SMS
data in the training set.

• Leveraging a larger French-English model to
translate out of vocabulary Haitian words, by
creating a mapping from Haitian words onto
French.

• Incorporation of morphological and/or syntac-
tic models to better cope with the low resource
language pair.

It is our hope that by introducing this data as a
shared challenge at WMT11 that we will establish a
useful community resource so that researchers may
explore these challenges and publish about them in
the future.

4 Human Evaluation

As with past workshops, we placed greater empha-
sis on the human evaluation than on the automatic
evaluation metric scores. It is our contention that
automatic measures are an imperfect substitute for
human assessment of translation quality. Therefore,
we define the manual evaluation to be primary, and
use the human judgments to validate automatic met-
rics.

Manual evaluation is time consuming, and it re-
quires a large effort to conduct on the scale of
our workshop. We distributed the workload across
a number of people, including shared-task partici-
pants, interested volunteers, and a small number of
paid annotators (recruited by the participating sites).
More than 130 people participated in the manual
evaluation, with 91 people putting in more than an
hour’s worth of effort, and 29 putting in more than
four hours. There was a collective total of 361 hours
of labor.

We asked annotators to evaluate system outputs
by ranking translated sentences relative to each
other. This was our official determinant of trans-
lation quality. The total number of judgments col-
lected for the different ranking tasks is given in Ta-
ble 6.

We performed the manual evaluation of the indi-
vidual systems separately from the manual evalua-
tion of the system combination entries, rather than
comparing them directly against each other. Last
year’s results made it clear that there is a large (ex-
pected) gap in performance between the two groups.
This year, we opted to reduce the number of pairwise

30



comparisons with the hope that we would be more
likely to find statistically significant differences be-
tween the systems in the same groups. To that same
end, we also eliminated the editing/acceptability
task that was featured in last year’s evaluation, in-
stead we had annotators focus solely on the system
ranking task.

4.1 Ranking translations of sentences

Ranking translations relative to each other is a rea-
sonably intuitive task. We therefore kept the instruc-
tions simple:

You are shown a source sentence followed
by several candidate translations.
Your task is to rank the translations from
best to worst (ties are allowed).

Each screen for this task involved judging trans-
lations of three consecutive source segments. For
each source segment, the annotator was shown the
outputs of five submissions, and asked to rank them.

With the exception of a few tasks in the system
combination track, there were many more than 5
systems participating in any given task—up to 23
for the English-German individual systems track.
Rather than attempting to get a complete ordering
over the systems, we instead relied on random se-
lection and a reasonably large sample size to make
the comparisons fair.

We use the collected rank labels to assign each
system a score that reflects how highly that system
was usually ranked by the annotators. The score for
some systemA reflects how frequently it was judged
to be better than or equal to other systems. Specif-
ically, each block in which A appears includes four
implicit pairwise comparisons (against the other pre-
sented systems). A is rewarded once for each of the
four comparisons in which A wins or ties. A’s score
is the number of such winning (or tying) pairwise
comparisons, divided by the total number of pair-
wise comparisons involving A.

The system scores are reported in Section 5. Ap-
pendix A provides detailed tables that contain pair-
wise head-to-head comparisons between pairs of
systems.

4.2 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreement in
the ranking task

We were interested in determining the inter- and
intra-annotator agreement for the ranking task, since
a reasonable degree of agreement must exist to sup-
port our process as a valid evaluation setup. To en-
sure we had enough data to measure agreement, we
purposely designed the sampling of source segments
and translations shown to annotators in a way that
ensured some items would be repeated, both within
the screens completed by an individual annotator,
and across screens completed by different annota-
tors.

We did so by ensuring that 10% of the generated
screens are exact repetitions of previously gener-
ated screen within the same batch of screens. Fur-
thermore, even within the other 90%, we ensured
that a source segment appearing in one screen ap-
pears again in two more screens (though with differ-
ent system outputs). Those two details, intentional
repetition of source sentences and intentional repeti-
tion of system outputs, ensured we had enough data
to compute meaningful inter- and intra-annotator
agreement rates.

We measured pairwise agreement among anno-
tators using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) (Cohen,
1960), which is defined as

κ =
P (A)− P (E)

1− P (E)

where P (A) is the proportion of times that the anno-
tators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of time that
they would agree by chance. Note that κ is basically
a normalized version of P (A), one which takes into
account how meaningful it is for annotators to agree
with each other, by incorporating P (E). Note also
that κ has a value of at most 1 (and could possibly
be negative), with higher rates of agreement result-
ing in higher κ.

The above definition of κ is actually used by sev-
eral definitions of agreement measures, which differ
in how P (A) and P (E) are computed.

We calculate P (A) by examining all pairs of
systems which had been judged by two or more
judges, and calculating the proportion of time that
they agreed that A > B, A = B, or A < B. In
other words, P (A) is the empirical, observed rate at

Table 6: A summary of the WMT11 ranking task, showing the number of systems and number of labels collected in
each of the individual and system combination tracks. The system count does not include the reference translation,
which was included in the evaluation, and so a value under “Labels per System” can be obtained only after adding 1
to the system count, before dividing the label count (e.g. in German-English, 4, 620/21 = 220.0).

which annotators agree, in the context of pairwise
comparisons. P (A) is computed similarly for intra-
annotator agreement (i.e. self-consistency), but over
pairwise comparisons that were annotated more than
once by a single annotator.

As for P (E), it should capture the probability that
two annotators would agree randomly. Therefore:

P (E) = P (A>B)2 + P (A=B)2 + P (A<B)2

Note that each of the three probabilities in P (E)’s
definition are squared to reflect the fact that we are
considering the chance that two annotators would
agree by chance. Each of these probabilities is com-
puted empirically, by observing how often annota-
tors actually rank two systems as being tied. We
note here that this empirical computation is a depar-
ture from previous years’ analyses, where we had
assumed that the three categories are equally likely
(yielding P (E) = 19 +

1
9 +

1
9 =

1
3 ). We believe that

this is a more principled approach, which faithfully
reflects the motivation of accounting for P (E) in the
first place.6

6Even if we wanted to assume a “random clicker” model,
setting P (E) = 1

3
is still not entirely correct. Given that

Table 7 gives κ values for inter-annotator and
intra-annotator agreement across the various evalu-
ation tasks. These give an indication of how often
different judges agree, and how often single judges
are consistent for repeated judgments, respectively.

There are some general and expected trends that
can be seen in this table. First of all, intra-annotator
agreement is higher than inter-annotator agreement.
Second, reference translations are noticeably better
than other system outputs, which means that anno-
tators have an artificially high level of agreement on
pairwise comparisons that include a reference trans-
lation. For this reason, we also report the agreement
levels when such comparisons are excluded.

The exact interpretation of the kappa coefficient is
difficult, but according to Landis and Koch (1977),
0−0.2 is slight, 0.2−0.4 is fair, 0.4−0.6 is moder-
ate, 0.6− 0.8 is substantial, and 0.8− 1.0 is almost
perfect. Based on these interpretations, the agree-
ment for sentence-level ranking is moderate to sub-
stantial for most tasks.

annotators rank five outputs at once, P (A = B) = 1
5

, not
1
3

, since there are only five (out of 25) label pairs that satisfy
A = B. Working this back into P (E)’s definition, we have
P (A > B) = P (A < B) = 2

5
, and therefore P (E) = 0.36

rather than 0.333.

Table 7: Inter- and intra-annotator agreement rates, for the various manual evaluation tracks of WMT11. See Tables 49
and 50 below for a detailed breakdown by language pair.

However, one result that is of concern is that
agreement rates are noticeably lower for European
language pairs, in particular for the individual sys-
tems track. When excluding reference comparisons,
the inter- and intra-annotator agreement levels are
0.320 and 0.512, respectively. Not only are those
numbers lower than for the other tasks, but they
are also lower than last year’s numbers, which were
0.409 and 0.580.

We investigated this result a bit deeper. Tables 49
and 50 in the Appendix break down the results fur-
ther, by reporting agreement levels for each lan-
guage pair. One observation is that the agreement
level for some language pairs deviates in a non-
trivial amount from the overall agreement rate.

Let us focus on inter-annotator agreement rates
in the individual track (excluding reference compar-
isons), in the top right portion of Table 49. The over-
all κ is 0.320, but it ranges from 0.264 for German-
English, to 0.477 for Spanish-English.

What distinguishes those two language pairs from
each other? If we examine the results in Table 8,
we see that Spanish-English had two very weak sys-
tems, which were likely easy for annotators to agree

on comparisons involving them. (This is the con-
verse of annotators agreeing more often on com-
parisons involving the reference.) English-French is
similar in that regard, and it too has a relatively high
agreement rate.

On the other hand, the participants in German-
English formed a large pool of more closely-
matched systems, where the gap separating the bot-
tom system is not as pronounced. So it seems that
the low agreement rates are indicative of a more
competitive evaluation and more closely-matched
systems.

5 Results of the Translation Tasks

We used the results of the manual evaluation to an-
alyze the translation quality of the different systems
that were submitted to the workshop. In our analy-
sis, we aimed to address the following questions:

• Which systems produced the best translation
quality for each language pair?

• Which of the systems that used only the pro-
vided training materials produced the best
translation quality?

Tables 8–10 show the system ranking for each
of the translation tasks. For each language pair,
we define a system as ‘winning’ if no other system
was found statistically significantly better (using the
Sign Test, at p ≤ 0.10). In some cases, multiple sys-
tems are listed as winners, either due to a large num-
ber of participants or a low number of judgments per
system pair, both of which are factors that make it
difficult to achieve statistical significance.

We start by examining the results for the individ-
ual system track for the European languages (Ta-
ble 8). In Spanish↔English and German↔English,
unconstrained systems are observed to perform bet-
ter than constrained systems. In other language
pairs, particularly French↔English, constrained
systems are found to be able to be on the same level
or outperform unconstrained systems. It also seems
that making use of the Gigaword corpora is likely
to yield better systems, even when translating out of
English, as in English-French and English-German.
For English-German the rule-based MT systems per-
formed well.

Of the participating teams, there is no individ-
ual system clearly outperforming all other systems
across the different language pairs. However, one
of the crawled systems, ONLINE-B, performs con-
sistently well, being one of the winners in all eight
language pairs.

As for the system combination track (Table 9),
the CMU-HEAFIELD-COMBO entry performed quite
well, being a winner in seven out of eight language
pairs. This performance is carried over to the Haitian
Creole task, where it again comes out on top (Ta-
ble 10). In the individual track of the Haitian Creole
task, BM-I2R is the sole winner in both the ‘clean’
and ‘raw’ tracks.

6 Evaluation Task

In addition to allowing us to analyze the translation
quality of different systems, the data gathered during
the manual evaluation is useful for validating auto-
matic evaluation metrics. Our evaluation shared task
is similar to the MetricsMATR workshop (Metrics
for MAchine TRanslation) that NIST runs (Przy-
bocki et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Ta-
ble 11 lists the participants in this task, along with
their metrics.

A total of 21 metrics and their variants were sub-
mitted to the evaluation task by 9 research groups.
We asked metrics developers to score the outputs of
the machine translation systems and system com-
binations at the system-level and at the segment-
level. The system-level metrics scores are given in
the Appendix in Tables 39–48. The main goal of the
evaluation shared task is not to score the systems,
but instead to validate the use of automatic metrics
by measuring how strongly they correlate with hu-
man judgments. We used the human judgments col-
lected during the manual evaluation for the transla-
tion task and the system combination task to calcu-
late how well metrics correlate at system-level and
at the segment-level.

This year the strongest metric was a new metric
developed by Columbia and ETS called MTeRater-
Plus. MTeRater-Plus is a machine-learning-based
metric that use features from ETS’s e-rater, an auto-
mated essay scoring engine designed to assess writ-
ing proficiency (Attali and Burstein, 2006). The fea-
tures include sentence-level and document-level in-
formation. Some examples of the e-rater features
include:

• Preposition features that calculate the proba-
bility of prepositions appearing in the given
context of a sentence (Tetreault and Chodorow,
2008)

• Collocation features that indicate whether the
collocations in the document are typical of na-
tive use (Futagi et al., 2008).

• A sentence fragment feature that counts the
number of ill-formed sentences in a document.

• A feature that counts the number of words with
inflection errors

• A feature that counts the the number of article
errors in the sentence citeHan2006.

MTeRater uses only the e-rater features, and mea-
sures fluency without any need for reference transla-
tions. MTeRater-Plus is a meta-metric that incorpo-
rates adequacy by combining MTeRater with other
MT evaluation metrics and heuristics that take the
reference translations into account.

Please refer to the proceedings for papers provid-
ing detailed descriptions of all of the metrics.

Table 12: System-level Spearman’s rho correlation of the
automatic evaluation metrics with the human judgments
for translation out of English, ordered by average abso-
lute value. We did not calculate correlations with the hu-
man judgments for the system combinations for the out of
English direction, because none of them had more than 4
items.

6.1 System-Level Metric Analysis
We measured the correlation of the automatic met-
rics with the human judgments of translation quality
at the system-level using Spearman’s rank correla-
tion coefficient ρ. We converted the raw scores as-
signed to each system into ranks. We assigned a hu-
man ranking to the systems based on the percent of
time that their translations were judged to be better
than or equal to the translations of any other system
in the manual evaluation. The reference was not in-
cluded as an extra translation.

When there are no ties, ρ can be calculated using
the simplified equation:

ρ = 1− 6
∑
d2i

n(n2 − 1)

where di is the difference between the rank for
systemi and n is the number of systems. The pos-
sible values of ρ range between 1 (where all systems
are ranked in the same order) and−1 (where the sys-
tems are ranked in the reverse order). Thus an auto-
matic evaluation metric with a higher absolute value
for ρ is making predictions that are more similar to
the human judgments than an automatic evaluation
metric with a lower absolute ρ.

The system-level correlations are shown in Ta-
ble 13 for translations into English, and Table 12
out of English, sorted by average correlation across
the language pairs. The highest correlation for
each language pair and the highest overall average
are bolded. This year, nearly all of the metrics

BLEU. The metrics that had the strongest correlation
this year included two metrics, MTeRater and TINE,
as well as metrics that have demonstrated strong cor-
relation in previous years like TESLA and Meteor.

6.2 Segment-Level Metric Analysis
We measured the metrics’ segment-level scores with
the human rankings using Kendall’s tau rank corre-
lation coefficient. The reference was not included as
an extra translation.

We calculated Kendall’s tau as:

τ =
num concordant pairs - num discordant pairs

total pairs

where a concordant pair is a pair of two translations
of the same segment in which the ranks calculated
from the same human ranking task and from the cor-
responding metric scores agree; in a discordant pair,
they disagree. In order to account for accuracy- vs.

error-based metrics correctly, counts of concordant
vs. discordant pairs were calculated specific to these
two metric types. The possible values of τ range
between 1 (where all pairs are concordant) and −1
(where all pairs are discordant). Thus an automatic
evaluation metric with a higher value for τ is mak-
ing predictions that are more similar to the human
judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with
a lower τ .

We did not include cases where the human rank-
ing was tied for two systems. As the metrics produce
absolute scores, compared to five relative ranks in
the human assessment, it would be potentially un-
fair to the metric to count a slightly different met-
ric score as discordant with a tie in the relative hu-
man rankings. A tie in automatic metric rank for
two translations was counted as discordant with two
corresponding non-tied human judgments.

lations into English, and Table 15 out of English,

guage pairs. The highest correlation for each lan-
guage pair and the highest overall average are

score translations into English: the MTeRater-Plus

score translation into other languages, there is not

7 Tunable Metrics Task

This year we introduced a new shared task that fo-
cuses on using evaluation metrics to tune the param-
eters of a statistical machine translation system. The
intent of this task was to get researchers who de-
velop automatic evaluation metrics for MT to work
on the problem of using their metric to optimize
the parameters of MT systems. Previous workshops
have demonstrated that a number of metrics perform
better than BLEU in terms of having stronger cor-
relation with human judgments about the rankings
of multiple machine translation systems. However,
most MT system developers still optimize the pa-
rameters of their systems to BLEU. Here we aim
to investigate the question of whether better metrics
will result in better quality output when a system is
optimized to them.

Because this was the first year that we ran the
tunable metrics task, participation was limited to a
few groups on an invitation-only basis. Table 16
lists the participants in this task. Metrics developers
were invited to integrate their evaluation metric into
a MERT optimization routine, which was then used
to tune the parameters of a fixed statistical machine
translation system. We evaluated whether the sys-
tem tuned on their metrics produced higher-quality

output than the baseline system that was tuned to
BLEU, as is typically done. In order to evaluate
whether the quality was better, we conducted a man-
ual evaluation, in the same fashion that we evalu-
ate the different MT systems submitted to the shared
translation task.

We provide the participants with a fixed MT sys-
tem for Urdu-English, along with a small parallel
set to be used for tuning. Specifically, we provide
developers with the following components:

• Decoder - the Joshua decoder was used in this
pilot.

• Decoder configuration file - a Joshua configu-
ration file that ensures all systems use the same
search parameters.

• Translation model - an Urdu-to-English trans-
lation model, with syntax-based SCFG rules
(Baker et al., 2010).

• Language model - a large 5-gram language
model trained on the English Gigaword corpus

• Development set - a development set, with 4
English reference sets, to be used to optimize
the system parameters.

• Test set - a test set consisting of 883 Urdu sen-
tences, to be translated by the tuned system (no
references provided).

• Optimization routine - we provide an imple-
mentation of minimum error rate training that
allows new metrics to be easily integrated as
the objective function.

task. Systems are ordered by their ≥others score, re-
flecting how often their translations won or tied pairwise
comparisons. The > column reflects how often a system
strictly won a pairwise comparison.

We provided the metrics developers with Omar
Zaidan’s Z-MERT software (Zaidan, 2009), which
implements Och (2003)’s minimum error rate train-
ing procedure. Z-MERT is designed to be modular
with respect to the objective function, and allows
BLEU to be easily replaced with other automatic
evaluation metrics. Metric developers incorporated
their metrics into Z-MERT by subclassing the Eval-
uationMetric.java abstract class. They ran Z-MERT
on the dev set with the provided decoder/models,
and created a weight vector for the system param-
eters.

Each team produced a distinct final weight vec-
tor, which was used to produce English translations
of sentences in the test set. The different transla-
tions produced by tuning the system to different met-
rics were then evaluated using the manual evaluation
pipeline.7

The results of the evaluation are in Table 18. The
scores show that the entries were quite close to each
other, with the notable exception of the SHEFFIELD-
ROSE-tuned system, which produced overly-long

ensure the outputs are more readable and easier to evaluate.

and erroneous output (possibly due to an implemen-
tation issue). This is also evident from the fact that
38% of pairwise comparisons indicated a tie be-
tween the two systems, with the tie rate increasing
to a full 47% when excluding comparisons involving
the reference. This is a very high tie rate – the cor-
responding figure in, say, European language pairs
(individual systems) is only 21%.

What makes the different entries appear even
more closely-matched is that the ranking changes
significantly when ordering systems by their
>others score rather than the ≥others score (i.e.
when rewarding only wins, and not rewarding ties).
NUS-TESLA-F goes from being a bottom entry to be-
ing a top entry, with CU-SEMPOS-BLEU also bene-
fiting, changing from the middle to the top rank.

Either way, we see that a BLEU -tuned system
is performing just as well as systems tuned to the
other metrics. This might be an indication that some
work remains to be done before a move away from
BLEU-tuning is fully justified. On the other hand,
the close results might be an artifact of the language
pair choice. Urdu-English translation is still a rel-
atively difficult problem, and MT outputs are still
of a relatively low quality. It might be the case that
human annotators are simply not very good at distin-

42



guishing one bad translation from another bad trans-
lation, especially at such a fine-grained level.

It is worth noting that the designers of the TESLA
family replicated the setup of this tunable metric task
for three European language pairs, and found that
human judges did perceive a difference in quality
between a TESLA-tuned system and a BLEU -tuned
system (Liu et al., 2011).

7.2 Anticipated Changes Next Year
This year’s effort was a pilot of the task, so we in-
tentionally limited the task to some degree, to make
it easier to iron out the details. Possible changes for
next year include:

• More language pairs / translations into lan-
guages other than English. This year we fo-
cus on Urdu-English because the language pair
requires a lot of reordering, and our syntactic
model has more parameters to optimize than
the standard Hiero and phrase-based models.

• Provide some human judgments about the
model’s output, so that people can experiment
with regression models.

• Include a single reference track along with the
multiple reference track. Some metrics may be
better at dealing with the (more common) case
of there being only a single reference transla-
tion available for every source sentence.

• Allow for experimentation with the MIRA op-
timization routine instead of MERT. MIRA can
scale to a greater number of features, but re-
quires that metrics be decomposable.

8 Summary

As in previous editions of this workshop we car-
ried out an extensive manual and automatic evalua-
tion of machine translation performance for translat-
ing from European languages into English, and vice
versa.

The number of participants grew slightly com-
pared to previous editions of the WMT workshop,
with 36 groups from 27 institutions participating in
the translation task of WMT11, 10 groups from 10
institutions participating in the system combination
task, and 10 groups from 8 institutions participating

in the featured translation task (Haitian Creole SMS
into English).

This year was also the first time that we included a
language pair (Haitian-English) with non-European
source language and with very limited resources for
the source language side. Also the genre of the
Haitian-English task differed from previous WMT
tasks as the Haitian-English translations are SMS
messages.

WMT11 also introduced a new shared task focus-
ing on evaluation metrics to tune the parameters of
a statistical machine translation system in which 6
groups have participated.

As in previous years, all data sets generated by
this workshop, including the human judgments, sys-
tem translations and automatic scores, are publicly
available for other researchers to analyze.8

A Pairwise System Comparisons by Human Judges

Tables 19–38 show pairwise comparisons between systems for each language pair. The numbers in each of
the tables’ cells indicate the percentage of times that the system in that column was judged to be better than
the system in that row. Bolding indicates the winner of the two systems. The difference between 100 and
the sum of the complementary cells is the percent of time that the two systems were judged to be equal.

Because there were so many systems and data conditions the significance of each pairwise comparison
needs to be quantified. We applied the Sign Test to measure which comparisons indicate genuine differences
(rather than differences that are attributable to chance). In the following tables ? indicates statistical signif-
icance at p ≤ 0.10, † indicates statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05, and ‡ indicates statistical significance at
p ≤ 0.01, according to the Sign Test.

B Automatic Scores

Tables 39–48 give the automatic scores for each of the systems.

C Meta-evaluation

Tables 49 and 50 give a detailed breakdown of intra- and inter-annotator agreement rates for all of manual
evaluation tracks of WMT11, broken down by language pair.
