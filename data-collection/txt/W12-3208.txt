Abstract

With rapidly increasing community, a plethora
of conferences related to Natural Language
Processing and easy access to their proceed-
ings make it essential to check the integrity
and novelty of the new submissions. This
study aims to investigate the trends of text
reuse in the ACL submissions, if any. We car-
ried a set of analyses on two spans of five years
papers (the past and the present) of ACL using
a publicly available text reuse detection appli-
cation to notice the behaviour. In our study,
we found some strong reuse cases which can
be an indicator to establish a clear policy to
handle text reuse for the upcoming editions of
ACL. The results are anonymised.

1 Introduction

Text reuse refers to using the original text again in
a different work. The text reuse in its most general
form can be of two types: verbatim (quotations, defi-
nitions) and modified (paraphrasing, boilerplate text,
translation). Although, the text reuse can be legal or
illegal from a publishing authority perspective about
the accreditation to the original author, more impor-
tantly it involves the ethical issues, especially in the
scientific work.

There is a fuzzy line between the text reuse
and the plagiarism and often this line is legislative.
There are no straight-forward measures to declare a
work as plagiarism and hence the publishing houses
usually deploy their own rules and definitions to deal

with plagiarism. For example, IEEE1 and ACM2

both consider the reuse as plagiarism in case of:

1. unaccredited reuse of text;

2. accredited large portion of text without proper
delineation or quotes to the complete reused
portion.

IEEE does not allow reusing large portion of own
previous work, generally referred as self reuse or
self plagiarism, without delineation, while ACM al-
lows it provided the original source being explicitly
cited.

With the advent of a large number of conferences
and their publicly available proceedings, it is ex-
tremely easy to access the information on the desired
topic to refer to and to reuse. Therefore, it becomes
essential to check the authenticity and the novelty of
the submitted text before the acceptance. It becomes
nearly impossible for a human judge (reviewer) to
discover the source of the submitted work, if any,
unless the source is already known. Automatic pla-
giarism detection applications identify such poten-
tial sources for the submitted work and based on it a
human judge can easily take the decision.

Unaccredited text reuse is often referred to as
plagiarism and there has been abundant research
about the same (Bouville, 2008; Loui, 2002; Mad-
dox, 1995). Self plagiarism is another related is-
sue, which is less known but not less unethical.

There has been limited research on the nature of self-
plagiarism and its limit to the acceptability (Bretag
and Mahmud, 2009; Collberg and Kobourov, 2005).
In theory, the technologies to identify either of them
do not differ at the core and there have been many
approaches to it (Bendersky and Croft, 2009; Hoad
and Zobel, 2003; Seo and Croft, 2008). The text
reuse can also be present in the cross-language en-
vironment (Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2010; Potthast et
al., 2011a). Since few years, PAN organises com-
petitions at CLEF3 (PAN@CLEF) on plagiarism de-
tection (Potthast et al., 2010; Potthast et al., 2011b)
and at FIRE4 (PAN@FIRE) on cross-language text
reuse (Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2011).

In the past, there has been an attempt to identify
the plagiarism among the papers of ACL anthology
in (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2010), but it mainly aims
to propose a new strategy to identify the plagiarism
and uses the anthology as the corpus. In this study,
we are concerned about the verbatim reuse and that
too in large amount, only. We identify such strong
text reuse cases in two spans of five years papers of
ACL (conference and workshops) and analyse them
to notice the trends in the past and the present based
on their year of publication, paper type and the au-
thorship. The detection method along with the sub-
section of the ACL anthology used are described in
Section 2. Section 3 contains the details of the car-
ried experiments and the analyses. Finally, in Sec-
tion 4 we summarise the work with remarks.

2 Detection Method

The aim of this study is to investigate the trend of
text reuse, and not proposing a new method. Look-
ing at the importance of the replicability of the ex-
periments, we use one of the publicly available tools
to detect the text reuse. First we describe the best
plagiarism detection system tested in (Potthast et
al., 2010) and then explain how the tool we used
works similarly. The partition of the ACL anthol-
ogy used for the experiments is described in Section
2.1. The details of the system along with the detec-
tion method are presented in the Section 2.2.

papers in ACL.

2.1 Data Partition

We crawled the long and short papers of the ACL
conference and all the workshop papers from the
ACL anthology of the years 1990-1997 and 2004-
2011. We converted all the papers from the PDF
format to plain text for processing using “pdftotext”
utility available with “xpdf” package in linux5. The
bibtex files available in the anthology are used for
the author analysis. We investigate the trends over
two span of five years (1993-97 and 2007-11) to de-
pict the past and the present trends. The number
of papers accepted for the mentioned categories in
these years are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Reuse Identification

First, we describe how the best plagiarism detection
system at PAN@CLEF 2010 works. Then we show
that WCopyFind6, the tool we used, works in a sim-
ilar way.

2.2.1 State-of-the-art
The best system in PAN@CLEF 2010 edition

was (Kasprzak and Brandejs, 2010). The overview
of the system is as follows.

1. Preprocessing: The documents are processed to
normalise the terms and word 5-gram chunks
are made using MD5 hashing scheme.

5http://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext
6WCopyFind is freely available under GNU public

license at http://plagiarism.bloomfieldmedia.
com/z-wordpress/software/wcopyfind/. Version
4.1.1 is used.

77



2. Similarity: Inverted index of these chunks is
created. Then for the given suspicious docu-
ment, the source documents which contain at
least 20 such chunks in common, are retrieved.

3. Annotation: The boundary of the exact frag-
ments (cases) are annotated based on the posi-
tion information of the common chunks. False
positives are removed by neglecting the cases
where the chunks are sparse (lay far from one
another).

2.2.2 WCopyFind
For the identification of text reuse, we used an

open source application WCopyFind. This system

Parameter Value
Shortest Phrase to Match 6
Fewest Matches to Report 500
Ignore Punctuation Yes
Ignore Outer Punctuation Yes
Ignore Numbers Yes
Ignore Letter Case Yes
Skip Non-Words Yes
Skip Long Words No
Most Imperfections to Allow 0

Table 2: Parameters used of WCopyFind to identify the
text reuse.

works very similarly to the approach explained in
Sec. 2.2.1.7 It handles the preprocessing by user de-
fined variables as shown in Table 2 to tokenise the
terms. Then it creates the word n-grams where n
= Shortest Phrase to Match parameter and converts
the chunks into 32-bit hash codes for similarity esti-
mation. It outputs the reuse text portions among the
documents in question explicitly as shown in Fig. 1.
The system extends a wide variety of parameters
with word and phrase-based similarity. We used the
parameter values as depicted in Table 2. Most of
the parameters are self-explanatory. We used word
6-grams for the identification because the value of
n=6 is suggested by the developers of WCopyFind.
Parameter “Fewest Matches to Report” interprets the
number of words in the matching n-grams hence it
is set to 500, which practically stands for ∼85 word

6-grams. There was a high overlap of the text among
the papers in the “reference” section which can not
be considered as reuse. To avoid this influence, we
estimated the maximum words overlap of the refer-
ence section between two papers empirically, which
turned out to be 200 words. Therefore, setting the
threshold value to 500 words safely avoided high
bibliographical similarity based false positives. In
order to confirm the reliability of the threshold, we
manually assessed 50 reported cases at random, in
which 48 were actually cases of text reuse and only
2 were false positives.

3 Experiments

We carried out a number of experiments to under-
stand the nature and the trends of text reuse among
the papers of ACL. These experiments were carried
for papers over two spans of five years to notice the
trends.

3.1 At present

In this category, we carry out the experiments on pa-
pers within the most recent five years.

I. Text reuse in the papers among the same year
submissions This experiment aimed to identify
the text reuse among the papers accepted in the same
year. Each year, ACL welcomes the work in many
different formats like long, short, demo, student ses-
sion and workshop papers. This analysis reveals the
same or highly similar text submitted in multiple for-
mats.

Fig. 2 shows the number of reuse cases identi-
fied among the papers accepted in the same year.

papers involved. The ‘L’, ‘S’ and ‘W’ denote the long,
short and workshop papers respectively. ‘XY’ refers to
the cases of reuse involving one paper of type X and the
other of type Y (span 2007-11).

We also analysed the types of the papers involved
in these reuse cases. In the same year papers, it is
difficult to decide the source and the target paper,
because both are not published at the time of their
review. Therefore, the number of cases based on the
unordered pairs of the paper types involved in the
reuse are shown in Fig. 3. It is noticeable from Fig. 2
and Table 1 that, although there is no big difference
between the number of accepted papers in the last
three years, the number of reuse cases are increasing
rapidly. Moreover, Fig. 3 reveals that the chance of a
workshop paper being involved in a reuse case with
a long, short or another workshop paper is higher.

II. Text reuse in the papers from the previous
year submissions This experiment aimed to de-
pict the phenomenon of text reuse from an already
published work, in this case, the ACL papers of the
previous years. In this experimental setting, we con-
sidered the papers of a year ‘X’ as the target papers
and the papers of the past three years from ‘X’ as
the source papers. Fig. 4 depicts the reuse trend of

this nature over a span of five years.
We also carried a similar analysis considering

only the immediate past year papers as the source.
Fig. 5 presents the trend of such cases. It is notice-
able from the Fig. 4 and 5 that the trend is upwards.
Moreover, it is interesting to notice that the majority
of the reuse cases involved the immediate past year
papers as the source compared to the previous three
year papers as the source.

We also analysed the trend of reuse based on the
source and the target paper types and the findings are
depicted in Fig. 6. Though the reuse cases involving
the workshop papers are very high, there are notice-
able amount of text reuse cases involving the papers
where both of them (source and target) are of type
long.

3.2 In retrospect
In this section we investigate the trends of text reuse
in early 5 years papers i.e. papers from the span of
years 1993-1997. Though the ACL Anthology con-
tains papers from 1979, we chose this span because,
for the consistency we wanted to include workshop

we present the number of text reuse cases in both
the test spans as a relative frequency based on the
total number of accepted papers in Table 3. It can be
noticed from Table 3 that the reuse cases were quite
a few in the past except the year 1997. Moreover,
in the last five years the amount of text reuse cases
have grown from 5.11% to 9.67%. In should also
be noticed that in spite of these cases of text reuse,

80



a large partition of the accepted papers (more than
90%) still remains free from text reuse.

Table 3: The relative frequency of text reuse cases over
the years.

3.3 Author analysis of the reuse cases

Finally we analysed the authorship of these text
reuse cases and categorised them as self and cross
reuse. If the two papers involved in text reuse share
at least one common author then it is considered as a
case of self reuse otherwise is reffered as cross reuse.
The number of the self and cross reuse cases in the
last five year papers are reported in Table 4. The
self reuse cases are much higher than the cross reuse
cases.

We also analysed the frequency of a particular au-
thor being involved in the text reuse cases. This
analysis is presented in Fig. 12. This phenomenon
follows the Zipf’s power law i.e. a small set of au-
thors (635 out of 8855 = less than 10%) refer to the
reported cases of reuse in the last five years. More
interestingly, only 80 authors (roughly 1% of the to-
tal authors) are involved in more than 5 cases of text
reuse.

reuse cases.

4 Remarks

These cases are reported based on the verbatim copy
of the text in the ACL proceedings only. We did
not aim to detect any text reuse that is paraphrased,
which in reality can not be neglected. The para-
phrased cases of text reuse are even harder to de-
tect, as remarked in (Stein et al., 2011): the state-
of-the-art plagiarism detectors succeeded in detect-
ing less than 30% of such plagiarised text fragments.
Moreover, including the other major conferences
and journals of the field, the number of reported
cases may increase. The manual analysis revealed
that, in some cases, the related work section is com-
pletely copied from another paper. There were many
cases when two papers share a large portion of the
text and differ mostly in the experiments and results
section. This study revealed that self reuse is more
prominent in the ACL papers compared to the cross
reuse. The cross reuse could be a plagiarism case if
the original authors are not acknowledged properly
and explicitly. The ethicality and the acceptability
of the self text reuse is arguable. Once more, the
aim of this paper is not to judge the acceptability of
the text reuse cases but to advocate the need of such
systems to help in the review process. Text reuse in
the same year submissions is also an eye opener be-
cause in such cases the text is novel but is used to
publish in multiple formats and can stay unnoticed
from the reviewers. In order to uphold the quality
and the novelty of the work accepted in ACL, it is
essential to implement a clear policy for text reuse
and the technology to handle such reuse cases. We
hope this work will help the ACL research commu-

81



nity to consider handling the text reuse for the up-
coming editions.
