Abstract 

Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in 
sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical 
models have been used for the task. However, 
such models without any domain knowledge 
often produce aspects that are not interpreta-
ble in applications. To tackle the issue, some 
knowledge-based topic models have been 
proposed, which allow the user to input some 
prior domain knowledge to generate coherent 
aspects. However, existing knowledge-based 
topic models have several major shortcom-
ings, e.g., little work has been done to incor-
porate the cannot-link type of knowledge or 
to automatically adjust the number of topics 
based on domain knowledge. This paper pro-
poses a more advanced topic model, called 
MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to ad-
dress these problems, which is based on an 
Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) 
model (which is also proposed in this paper).  
Experiments on real-life product reviews 
from a variety of domains show that MC-
LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art 
models markedly. 

1 Introduction 

In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect 
extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features 
on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and 
Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence 
“The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.” 
Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) 
extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from 
the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with 
similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “pho-
to” into one aspect category as they mean the 
same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we 

adopt the topic modeling approach as it can per-
form both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2). 

Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), 
provide an unsupervised framework for extracting 
latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect 
categories (or simply aspects) in our context. 
However, in recent years, researchers have found 
that fully unsupervised topic models may not pro-
duce topics that are very coherent for a particular 
application. This is because the objective functions 
of topic models do not always correlate well with 
human judgments and needs (Chang et al., 2009). 

To address the issue, several knowledge-based 
topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA 
model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates 
two forms of prior knowledge, also called two 
types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. 
A must-link states that two words (or terms) 
should belong to the same topic whereas a cannot-
link indicates that two words should not be in the 
same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more 
general knowledge can be specified using first-
order logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et 
al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 
2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable 
the user to specify prior knowledge as seed 
words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) 
also used word similarity as priors for guidance.  

However, none of the existing models is capable 
of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge 
except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Fur-
thermore, none of the existing models, including 
DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the num-
ber of topics based on domain knowledge. The 
domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may 
change the number of topics. There are two types 
of cannot-links: consistent and inconsistent with 
the domain corpus. For example, in the reviews of 

1655



domain “Computer”, a topic model may generate 
two topics Battery and Screen that represent two 
different aspects. A cannot-link {battery, screen} 
as the domain knowledge is thus consistent with 
the corpus. However, words Amazon and Price 
may appear in the same topic due to their high co-
occurrences in the Amazon.com review corpus. To 
separate them, a cannot-link {amazon, price} can 
be added as the domain knowledge, which is in-
consistent with the corpus as these two words have 
high co-occurrences in the corpus. In this case, the 
number of topics needs to be increased by 1 since 
the mixed topic has to be separated into two indi-
vidual topics Amazon and Price. Apart from the 
above shortcoming, earlier knowledge-based topic 
models also have some major shortcomings: 

Incapability of handling multiple senses: A 
word typically has multiple meanings or senses. 
For example, light can mean “of little weight” or 
“something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA 
cannot handle multiple senses because its defini-
tion of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B 
form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it 
implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, 
B, and C should be in the same topic. This case 
also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al., 
2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and 
Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et 
al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that 
each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed 
set), which is restrictive as the amount of 
knowledge should not be limited. 

Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: 
When using must-links or seeds, existing models 
basically try to ensure that the words in a must-
link or a seed set have similar probabilities under a 
topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link com-
prises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, 
due to the redistribution of probability mass, the 
probability of the frequent word will decrease 
while the probability of the infrequent word will 
increase. This can harm the final topics because 
the attenuation of the frequent (often domain im-
portant) words can result in some irrelevant words 
being ranked higher (with higher probabilities). 

To address the above shortcomings, we define 
m-set (for must-set) as a set of words that should 
belong to the same topic and c-set (cannot-set) as a 
set of words that should not be in the same topic. 
They are similar to must-link and cannot-link but 
m-sets do not enforce transitivity. Transitivity is 

the main cause of the inability to handle multiple 
senses. Our m-sets and c-sets are also more con-
cise providing knowledge in the context of a set. 
As in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), we assume that 
there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e., 
if 𝑤1  is a cannot-word of 𝑤2  (i.e., shares a c-set 
with 𝑤2), any word that shares an m-set with 𝑤1 is 
also a cannot-word of 𝑤2. Note that knowledge as 
m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a) 
and (Chen et al., 2013b). 

We then propose a new topic model, called MC-
LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not on-
ly able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust 
the number of topics, but also deal with the multi-
ple senses and adverse effect of knowledge prob-
lems at the same time. For the issue of multiple 
senses, a new latent variable 𝑠 is added to LDA to 
distinguish multiple senses (§ 3). Then, we employ 
the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model 
(Mahmoud, 2008) to address the issue of adverse 
effect of knowledge (§ 4). Deviating from the 
standard topic modeling approaches, we propose 
the Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) 
model (§ 5). E-GPU extends the GPU model to 
enable multi-urn interactions. This is necessary for 
handling c-sets and for adjusting the number of 
topics. E-GPU is the heart of MC-LDA. Due to the 
extension, a new inference mechanism is designed 
for MC-LDA (§ 6). Note that E-GPU is generic 
and can be used in any appropriate application. 

In summary, this paper makes the following 
three contributions: 
1. It proposed a new knowledge-based topic mod-

el called MC-LDA, which is able to use both 
m-sets and c-sets, as well as automatically ad-
just the number of topics based on domain 
knowledge. At the same time, it can deal with 
some other major shortcomings of early exist-
ing models. To our knowledge, none of the ex-
isting knowledge-based models is as compre-
hensive as MC-LDA in terms of capabilities. 

2. It proposed the E-GPU model to enable multi-
urn interactions, which enables c-sets to be nat-
urally integrated into a topic model. To the best 
of our knowledge, E-GPU has not been pro-
posed and used before.  

3. A comprehensive evaluation has been conduct-
ed to compare MC-LDA with several state-of-
the-art models. Experimental results based on 
both qualitative and quantitative measures 
demonstrate the superiority of MC-LDA.

2  Related Work 

Sentiment analysis has been studied extensively in 
recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 
2008; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wiebe et al., 2004). 
According to (Liu, 2012), there are three main ap-
proaches to aspect extraction: 1) Using word fre-
quency and syntactic dependency of aspects and 
sentiment words for extraction (e.g., Blair-
goldensohn et al., 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et 
al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 
2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 
2009; Yu et al., 2011; Zhang and Liu, 2011; 
Zhuang et al., 2006); 2) Using supervised se-
quence labeling/classification (e.g., Choi and 
Cardie, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; 
Kobayashi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010); 3) Topic 
models (Branavan et al., 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 
2010; Fang and Huang, 2012; Jo and Oh, 2011; 
Kim et al., 2013; Lazaridou et al., 2013; Li et al., 
2011; Lin and He, 2009; Lu et al., 2009, 2012, 
2011; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Mei et al., 2007; 
Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 
2012; Sauper et al., 2011; Titov and McDonald, 
2008; Wang et al., 2010, 2011; Zhao et al., 2010). 
Other approaches include shallow semantic pars-
ing (Li et al., 2012b), bootstrapping (Xia et al., 
2009), Non-English techniques (Abu-Jbara et al., 
2013; Zhou et al., 2012), graph-based representa-
tion (Wu et al., 2011), convolution kernels 
(Wiegand and Klakow, 2010) and domain adap-
tion (Li et al., 2012). Stoyanov and Cardie (2011), 
Wang and Liu (2011), and Meng et al. (2012) 
studied opinion summarization outside the reviews. 
Some other works related with sentiment analysis 
include (Agarwal and Sabharwal, 2012; Kennedy 
and Inkpen, 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Mohammad et 
al., 2009). 

In this work, we focus on topic models owing to 
their advantage of performing both aspect extrac-
tion and clustering simultaneously. All other ap-
proaches only perform extraction. Although there 
are several related works on clustering aspect 
terms (e.g., Carenini et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2009; 
Zhai et al., 2011), they all assume that the aspect 
terms have been extracted beforehand. We also 
notice that some aspect extraction models in sen-
timent analysis separately discover aspect words 
and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper 
and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our pro-
posed model does not separate them as most sen-

timent words also imply aspects and most adjec-
tives modify specific attributes of objects. For ex-
ample, sentiment words expensive and beautiful 
imply aspects price and appearance respectively. 

Regarding the knowledge-based models, be-
sides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et al., 
2011) enables the user to provide guidance interac-
tively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et 
al. (2009) used document labels in supervised set-
ting. In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDK-
LDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which 
serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in 
MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a 
framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal 
with the wrong knowledge when exploring the 
lexical semantic relations as the general (domain 
independent) knowledge in topic models. But 
these models above did not consider the 
knowledge in the form of c-sets (or cannot-links). 

The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model 
(Mahmoud, 2008) was first introduced in LDA by 
Mimno et al. (2011). However, Mimno et al. (2011) 
did not use domain knowledge. Our results in § 7 
show that using domain knowledge can signifi-
cantly improve aspect extraction. The GPU model 
was also employed in topic models in our work of 
(Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we pro-
pose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model. The E-
GPU model is more powerful in handling complex 
situations in dealing with c-sets. 

3 Dealing with M-sets and Multiple Senses 
Since the proposed MC-LDA model is a major 
extension to our earlier work in (Chen et al., 
2013a), which can deal with m-sets, we include 
this earlier work here as the background.     

To incorporate m-sets and deal with multiple 
senses of a word, the MDK-LDA(b) model was 
proposed in (Chen et al., 2013a), which adds a 
new latent variable 𝑠 into LDA. The rationale here 
is that this new latent variable 𝑠 guides the model 
to choose the right sense represented by an m-set. 
The generative process of MDK-LDA(b) is (the 
notations are explained in Table 1): 
                     𝜃  ~ 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛼) 
                     𝑧𝑖|𝜃𝑚  ~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(𝜃𝑚) 
                     𝜑 ~ 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛽) 
                     𝑠𝑖|𝑧𝑖,𝜑 ~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙�𝜑𝑧𝑖� 
                     𝜂 ~ 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑡(𝛾) 
                     𝑤𝑖|𝑧𝑖 , 𝑠𝑖,𝜂 ~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙�𝜂𝑧𝑖,𝑠𝑖� 

1657



The corresponding plate is shown in Figure 1. Un-
der MDK-LDA(b), the probability of word 𝑤 giv-
en topic 𝑡, i.e., 𝜋𝑡(𝑤), is given by: 

 𝜋𝑡(𝑤) = ∑ 𝜑𝑡(𝑠) ∙ 𝜂𝑡,𝑠(𝑤)𝑆𝑠=1    (1) 
where 𝜑𝑡(𝑠)  denotes the probability of m-set 𝑠 
occurring under topic 𝑡 and 𝜂𝑡,𝑠(𝑤) is the proba-
bility of word 𝑤 appearing in m-set 𝑠 under topic 𝑡. 

According to (Chen et al., 2013a), the condi-
tional probability of Gibbs sampler for MDK-
LDA(b) is given by (see notations in Table 1): 

    𝑃�𝑧𝑖 = 𝑡, 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑠 �𝒛−𝑖 , 𝒔−𝑖 ,𝒘,𝛼,𝛽, 𝛾� ∝ 
𝑛𝑚,𝑡−𝑖 + 𝛼

−𝑖 + 𝛽�𝑆𝑠′=1

×
𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑤𝑖
−𝑖 + 𝛾𝑠

∑ �𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑣′
−𝑖 + 𝛾𝑠�𝑉𝑣′=1

 (2) 

The superscript −𝑖  denotes the counts excluding 
the current assignments (𝑧𝑖 and 𝑠𝑖) for word 𝑤𝑖. 

4 Handling Adverse Effect of Knowledge 

4.1 Generalized Pólya urn (GPU) Model 
The Pólya urn model involves an urn containing 
balls of different colors. At discrete time intervals, 
balls are added or removed from the urn according 
to their color distributions. 

In the simple Pólya urn (SPU) model, a ball is 
first drawn randomly from the urn and its color is 
recorded, then that ball is put back along with a 
new ball of the same color. This selection process 
is repeated and the contents of the urn change over 
time, with a self-reinforcing property sometimes 
expressed as “the rich get richer.” SPU is actually 
exhibited in the Gibbs sampling for LDA.  

The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model differs 
from the SPU model in the replacement scheme 
during sampling. Specifically, when a ball is ran-
domly drawn, certain numbers of additional balls 
of each color are returned to the urn, rather than 
just two balls of the same color as in SPU. 

4.2 Promoting M-sets using GPU 
To deal with the issue of sensitivity to the adverse 
effect of knowledge, MDK-LDA(b) is extended to 
MDK-LDA which employs the generalized Pólya 
urn (GPU) sampling scheme. 

As discussed in § 1, due to the problem of the 
adverse effect of knowledge, important words may 
suffer from the presence of rare words in the same 
m-set. This problem can be dealt with the very 
sampling scheme of the GPU model (Chen et al., 
2013a). Specifically, by adding additional 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 
balls of color 𝑠 into 𝑈𝑡𝑆  while keeping the drawn 
ball, we increase the proportion (probability) of 
seeing the m-set 𝑠 under topic 𝑡 and thus promote 
m-set 𝑠 as a whole. Consequently, each word in 𝑠 
is more likely to be emitted. We define 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 as: 

 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 = �
1           𝑤 = 𝑤′                                   
𝜎           𝑤 ∈ 𝑠,𝑤′ ∈ 𝑠,𝑤 ≠ 𝑤′        

 0           otherwise                             
 (3) 

The corresponding Gibbs sampler for MDK-LDA 
will be introduced in § 6.

5 Incorporating C-sets 

5.1 Extended Generalized Pólya urn Model 
To handle the complex situation resulted from in-
corporating c-sets, we propose an Extended gener-
alized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model. Instead of 
involving only one urn as in SPU and GPU, E-
GPU model considers a set of urns in the sampling 
process. The E-GPU model allows a ball to be 
transferred from one urn to another, enabling mul-
ti-urn interactions. Thus, during sampling, the 
populations of several urns will evolve even if on-
ly one ball is drawn from one urn. This capability 
makes the E-GPU model more powerful as it 
models relationships among multiple urns. 

We define three sets of urns which will be used 
in the new sampling scheme in the proposed MC-
LDA model. The first set of urns is the topic urns 
𝑈𝑚∈{1…𝑀}𝑇 , where each topic urn contains 𝑇 colors 
(topics) and each ball inside has a color 𝑡 ∈
 {1 …𝑇}. It corresponds to the document-topic dis-
tribution 𝜃 in Table 1. The second set of urns (m-
set urn 𝑈𝑡∈ {1…𝑇}𝑆 )  corresponds to the topic-m-set 
distribution 𝜑 , with balls of colors (m-sets) 
𝑠 ∈  {1 … 𝑆}  in each m-set urn. The third set of 
urns is the word urns 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊 ,where 𝑡 ∈  {1 …𝑇} and 
𝑠 ∈  {1 … 𝑆} . Each ball inside a word urn has a 
color (word) 𝑤 ∈  {1 …𝑉}. The distribution 𝜂 can 
be reflected in this set of urns. 

5.2 Handling C-sets using E-GPU 
As MDK-LDA can only use m-sets but not c-sets, 
we now extend MDK-LDA to the MC-LDA model 
in order to exploit c-sets. As pointed out in § 1, c-
sets may be inconsistent with the corpus domain, 
which makes them considerably harder to deal 
with. To tackle the issue, we utilize the proposed 
E-GPU model and incorporate c-sets handling in-
side the E-GPU sampling scheme, which is also 
designed to enable automated adjustment of the 
number of topics based on domain knowledge. 

Based on the definition of c-set, each pair of 
words in a c-set cannot both have large probabili-
ties under the same topic. As the E-GPU model 
allows multi-urn interactions, when sampling a 
ball represents word 𝑤 from a word urn 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊 , we 
want to transfer the balls representing cannot-
words of 𝑤 (sharing a c-set with 𝑤) to other urns 
(see Step 3 a below). That is, decrease the proba-

bilities of those cannot-words under this topic 
while increasing their corresponding probabilities 
under some other topics. In order to correctly 
transfer a ball that represents word 𝑤, it should be 
transferred to an urn which has a higher proportion 
of 𝑤 and its related words (i.e., words sharing m-
sets with 𝑤). That is, we randomly sample an urn 
that has a higher proportion of any m-set of 𝑤 to 
transfer 𝑤 to (Step 3 b below). However, the situa-
tion becomes more involved when a c-set is not 
consistent with the corpus. For example, aspects 
price and amazon may be mixed under one topic 
(say 𝑡) in LDA. The user may want to separate 
them by providing a c-set {price, amazon}. In this 
case, according to LDA, word price has no topic 
with a higher proportion of it (and its related 
words) than topic 𝑡. To transfer it, we need to in-
crement the number of topics by 1 and then trans-
fer the word to this new topic urn (step 3 c below). 
Based on these ideas, we propose the E-GPU sam-
pling scheme for the MC-LDA model below: 

1. Sample a topic 𝑡 from 𝑈𝑚𝑇 , an m-set 𝑠 from 𝑈𝑡𝑆, and 
a word 𝑤  from 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊  sequentially, where 𝑚  is the 
𝑚th document. 

2. Record 𝑡, 𝑠 and 𝑤, put back two balls of color 𝑡 in-
to urn 𝑈𝑚𝑇 , one ball of color 𝑠 into urn 𝑈𝑡𝑆, and two 
balls of color 𝑤 into urn 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊 . Given the matrix 𝔸 
(in Equation 3), for each word 𝑤′ ∈ 𝑠, we put back 
𝔸𝑠,𝑤′ ,𝑤 number of balls of color 𝑠 into urn 𝑈𝑡𝑆. 

3.  For each word 𝑤𝑐 that shares a c-set with 𝑤: 
a) Sample an m-set 𝑠𝑐  from 𝑈𝑡𝑆  which satisfies 

𝑤𝑐 ∈ 𝑠𝑐 . Draw a ball 𝑏 of color 𝑤𝑐 (to be trans-
ferred) from 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑐

𝑊  and remove it from 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑐
𝑊 . The 

document of ball 𝑏 is denoted by 𝑚𝑐. If no ball 
of color 𝑤𝑐 can be drawn (i.e., there is no ball 
of color 𝑤𝑐 in 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑐

𝑊 ), skip steps b) to d). 
b) Produce an urn set {𝑈𝑡′,𝑠′

𝑊 } such that each urn in 
it satisfies the following conditions: 
i)   𝑡′ ≠ 𝑡, 𝑤𝑐 ∈ 𝑠′ 
ii) The proportion of balls of color 𝑠′ in 𝑈𝑡′

𝑆  is    
higher than that of balls of color 𝑠𝑐  in 𝑈𝑡𝑆. 

c) If {𝑈𝑡′,𝑠′
𝑊 } is not empty, randomly select one urn 

𝑈𝑡′,𝑠′
𝑊  from it. If {𝑈𝑡′,𝑠′

𝑊 } is empty, set 𝑇 = 𝑇 +
1, 𝑡′ = 𝑇, draw an m-set 𝑠′ from 𝑈𝑡′

𝑆  which sat-
isfies 𝑤𝑐 ∈ 𝑠′. Record 𝑠′ for step d). 

d) Put the ball 𝑏 drawn from Step a) into 𝑈𝑡′,𝑠′
𝑊 , as 

well as a ball of color 𝑠′ into 𝑈𝑡′
𝑆  and a ball of 

color 𝑡′ into 𝑈𝑚𝑐
𝑇 . 

Note that the E-GPU model cannot be reflected in 
the graphical model in Figure 1 as it is essentially 

1659



sampling scheme, and hence MC-LDA shares the 
same plate as MDK-LDA(b). 

6 Collapsed Gibbs Sampling 

We now describe the collapsed Gibbs sampler 
(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) with the detailed 
conditional distributions and algorithms for MC-
LDA. Inference of 𝑧 and 𝑠 can be computationally 
expensive due to the non-exchangeability of words 
under the E-GPU models. We take the approach of 
(Mimno et al., 2011) which approximates the true 
Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each word 
as if it were the last. 

For each word 𝑤𝑖 , we perform hierarchical 
sampling consisting of the following three steps 
(the detailed algorithms are given in Figures 2 and 
3): 

Step 1 (Lines 1-11 in Figure 2): We jointly 
sample a topic 𝑧𝑖  and an m-set 𝑠𝑖  (containing 𝑤𝑖) 
for 𝑤𝑖 , which gives us a blocked Gibbs sampler 
(Ishwaran and James, 2001), with the conditional 
probability given by: 
     𝑃(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑡, 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑠|𝒛−𝑖 , 𝒔−𝑖 ,𝒘,𝛼,𝛽, 𝛾,𝔸) ∝

restricts the ball to be transferred only to an urn 
that contains a higher proportion of its m-set. 
When no topic 𝑡 can be successfully sampled and 
the current sweep (iteration) of Gibbs sampling 
has the same number of topic (𝑇) as the previous 
sweep, we increment 𝑇 by 1. And then assign 𝑇 to 
𝑧𝑏 . The counts and parameters are also updated 
accordingly. 

7 Experiments 

We now evaluate the proposed MC-LDA model 
and compare it with state-of-the-art existing mod-
els. Two unsupervised baseline models that we 
compare with are:  
• LDA: LDA is the basic unsupervised topic 

model (Blei et al., 2003). 
• LDA-GPU: LDA with GPU (Mimno et al., 

2011). Specifically, LDA-GPU applies GPU in 
LDA using co-document frequency.  
As for knowledge-based models, we focus on 

comparing with DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et 
al., 2009), which is perhaps the best known 
knowledge-based model and it allows both must-
links and cannot-links.  

For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider 
the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA:  
• MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and c-

sets. This is the newly proposed model.   
• M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is 

the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). 
• DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. 
• DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and 

cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in 
(Andrzejewski et al., 2009).  

We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns 
et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 
2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) as seed sets are 
special cases of must-links and they also do not 
allow c-sets (or cannot-links). 

7.1 Datasets and Settings 
Datasets: We use product reviews from four do-
mains (types of products) from Amazon.com for 
evaluation. The corpus statistics are shown in Ta-
ble 2 (columns 2 and 3). The domains are “Cam-
era,” “Food,” “Computer,” and “Care” (short for 
“Personal Care”). We have made the datasets pub-
lically available at the website of the first author. 

Pre-processing: We ran the Stanford Core NLP 
Tools1 to perform sentence detection and lemmati-
zation. Punctuations, stopwords 2 , numbers and 
words appearing less than 5 times in each corpus 
were removed. The domain name was also re-
moved, e.g., word camera in the domain “Camera”, 
since it co-occurs with most words in the corpus, 
leading to high similarity among topics/aspects. 
Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and 
McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are 
applied to reviews as documents, they tend to pro-
duce topics that correspond to global properties of 
products (e.g., brand name), which make topics 
overlapping with each other. The reason is that all 
reviews of the same type of products discuss about 
the same aspects of these products. Only the brand 
names and product names are different. Thus, us-
ing individual reviews for modeling is not very 
effective. Although there are approaches which 
model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and 
McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody 
and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sen-
tences and treating each sentence as an independ-
ent document. Sentences can be used by all three 
baselines without any change to their models. Alt-
hough the relationships between sentences are lost, 
the data is fair to all models. 
Parameter settings: For all models, posterior in-
ference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations 
with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all 
models, we set 𝛼 = 1 and 𝛽 = 0.1. We found that 
small changes of 𝛼 and 𝛽 did not affect the results 
much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh, 
2011) who also used online reviews. For the num-
ber of topics T, we tried different values (see §7.2) 
as it is hard to know the exact number of topics. 
While non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh 
et al., 2006) aim to estimate 𝑇  from the corpus, 
they are often sensitive to the hyper-parameters 
(Heinrich, 2009).

For DF-LDA, we followed (Andrzejewski et al., 
2009) to generate must-links and cannot-links 
from our domain knowledge. We then ran DF-
LDA3 while keeping its parameters as proposed in 
(Andrzejewski et al., 2009) (we also experimented 
with different parameter settings but they did not 
produce better results). For our proposed model, 
we estimated the thresholds using cross validation 
in our pilot experiments. Estimated value 𝜎 = 0.2 
in equation 3 yielded good results. The second 
stage (steps 2 and 3) of the Gibbs sampler for MC-
LDA (for dealing with c-sets) is applied after 
burn-in phrase. 
Domain knowledge: User knowledge about a do-
main can vary a great deal. Different users may 
have very different knowledge. To reduce this var-
iance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of 
asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain 
the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each 
word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other 
parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects) 
from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify 
the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if 
a word 𝑤  is not provided with any m-set, it is 
treated as a singleton m-set {𝑤}. For c-sets, we ran 
LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on 
the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et 
al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to 
each model in the format required by each model. 
The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in col-
umns 4 and 5 of Table 2. Duplicate sets have been 
removed. 

7.2 Objective Evaluation 
In this section, we evaluate our proposed MC-

3 http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/df_lda.html 

LDA model objectively. Topic models are often 
evaluated using perplexity on held-out test data. 
However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the 
semantic coherence of individual topics learned by 
a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent re-
search has shown potential issues with perplexity 
as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that 
the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human 
judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect 
our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate 
semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of 
how well the model fits the data. 

The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 
2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens 
and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alter-
native for assessing topic quality. This metric re-
lies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the 
documents, and does not depend on external re-
sources or human labeling. It was shown that topic 
coherence is highly consistent with human expert 
labeling by Mimno et al. (2011). Higher topic co-
herence score indicates higher quality of topics, 
i.e., better topic interpretability. 
Effects of Number of Topics 
Since our proposed models and the baseline mod-
els are all parametric models, we first compare 
each model given different numbers of topics. 
Figure 4 shows the average Topic Coherence score 
of each model given different numbers of topics. 
From Figure 4, we note the following: 
1. MC-LDA consistently achieves the highest To-

pic Coherence scores given different numbers 
of topics. M-LDA also works better than the 
other baseline models, but not as well as MC-
LDA. This shows that both m-sets and c-sets 
are beneficial in producing coherent aspects. 

2. DF-LDA variants, DF-M and DF-MC, do not 
perform well due to the shortcomings discussed

in § 1. It is slightly better than LDA when 𝑇 = 
15, but worse than LDA in other cases. We will 
further analyze the effects of knowledge on 
MC-LDA and DF-LDA shortly. 

3. LDA-GPU does not perform well due to its use 
of co-document frequency. As frequent words 
usually have high co-document frequency with 
many other words, the frequent words are 
ranked top in many topics. This shows that the 
guidance using domain knowledge is more ef-
fective than using co-document frequency. 

In terms of improvements, MC-LDA outperforms 
M-LDA significantly ( 𝑝 < 0.03 ) and all other 
baseline models significantly (𝑝 < 0.01) based on 
a paired t-test. It is important to note that by no 
means do we say that LDA-GPU and DF-LDA are 
not effective. We only say that for the task of as-
pect extraction and leveraging domain knowledge, 
these models do not generate as coherent aspects 
as ours because of their shortcomings discussed in 
§ 1. In general, with more topics, the Topic Coher-
ence scores increase. We found that when 𝑇  is 
larger than 15, aspects found by each model be-
came more and more overlapping, with several 
aspects expressing the same features of products. 

So we fix 𝑇 = 15 in the subsequent experiments.  
Effects of Knowledge 
To further analyze the effects of knowledge on 
models, in each domain, we randomly sampled 
different proportions of knowledge (i.e., different 
numbers of m-sets/must-links and c-sets/cannot-
links) as shown in Figure 5, where 0% means no 
knowledge (same as LDA and LDA-GPU, which 
do not incorporate knowledge) and 100% means 
all knowledge. From Figure 5, we see that MC-
LDA and M-LDA both perform consistently better 
than DF-MC and DF-M across different propor-
tions of knowledge. With the increasing number of 
knowledge sets, MC-LDA and M-LDA achieve 
higher Topic Coherence scores (i.e., produce more 
coherent aspects). In general, MC-LDA performs 
the best. For both DF-MC and DF-M, the Topic 
Coherence score increases from 0% to 25% 
knowledge, but decreases with more knowledge 
(50% and 100%). This shows that with limited 
amount of knowledge, the shortcomings of DF-
LDA are not very obvious, but with more 
knowledge, these issues become more serious and 
thus degrade the performance of DF-LDA.  

7.3 Human Evaluation 
Since our aim is to make topics more interpretable 
and conformable to human judgments, we worked 
with two judges who are familiar with Amazon 
products and reviews to evaluate the models sub-
jectively. Since topics from topic models are rank-
ings based on word probability and we do not 
know the number of correct topical words, a natu-
ral way to evaluate these rankings is to use Preci-
sion@n (or p@n) which was also used in 
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), 
where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 
5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: 
topic labeling and word labeling. 

Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in 
(Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label 
each topic as good or bad. Each topic was present-
ed as a list of 10 most probable words in descend-
ing order of their probabilities under that topic. 
The models which generated the topics for label-
ing were obscure to the judges. In general, each 
topic was annotated as good if it had more than 
half of its words coherently related to each other 
representing a semantic concept together; other-
wise bad. Agreement of human judges on topic

labeling using Cohen’s Kappa yielded a score of 
0.92 indicating almost perfect agreements accord-
ing to the scale in (Landis and Koch, 1977). This 
is reasonable as topic labeling is an easy task and 
semantic coherence can be judged well by humans. 

Word Labeling: After topic labeling, we chose 
the topics, which were labeled as good by both 
judges, as good topics. Then, we asked the two 
judges to label each word of the top 10 words in 
these good topics. Each word was annotated as 
correct if it was coherently related to the concept 
represented by the topic; otherwise incorrect. 
Since judges already had the conception of each 
topic in mind when they were labeling topics, la-
beling each word was not difficult which explains 
the high Kappa score for this labeling task (score = 
0.892). 

Quantitative Results 
Figures 6 and 7 give the average p@5 and p@10 
of all good topics over all four domains. The num-
bers of good topics generated by each model are 
shown in Table 3. We can see that the human 
evaluation results are highly consistent with Topic 
Coherence results in §7.2. MC-LDA improves 
over M-LDA significantly (𝑝 < 0.01) and both 
MC-LDA and M-LDA outperforms the other base-
line models significantly ( 𝑝 < 0.005 ) using a 
paired t-test. We also found that when the domain 
knowledge is simple with one word usually ex-
pressing only one meaning/sense (e.g., in the do-
main “Computer”), DF-LDA performs better than 
LDA. In other domains, it performs similarly or 
worse than LDA. Again, it shows that DF-LDA is 
not effective to handle complex knowledge, which 
is consistent with the results of effects of 
knowledge on DF-LDA in §7.2. 

Qualitative Results 
We now show some qualitative results to give an 
intuitive feeling of the outputs from different mod-
els. There are a large number of aspects that are 
dramatically improved by MC-LDA. Due to space 
constraints, we only show some examples. To fur-
ther focus, we just show some results of MC-LDA, 
M-LDA and LDA. The results from LDA-GPU 
and DF-LDA were inferior and hard for the human 
judges to match them with aspects found by the 
other models for qualitative comparison. 

Table 4 shows three aspects Amazon, Price, 
Battery generated by each model in the domain 

“Camera”. Both LDA and M-LDA can only dis-
cover two aspects but M-LDA has a higher aver-
age precision. Given the c-set {amazon, price, 
battery}, MC-LDA can discover all three aspects 
with the highest average precision. 

8 Conclusion  

This paper proposed a new model to exploit do-
main knowledge in the form of m-sets and c-sets 
to generate coherent aspects (topics) from online 
reviews. The paper first identified and character-
ized some shortcomings of the existing 
knowledge-based models. A new model called 
MC-LDA was then proposed, whose sampling 
scheme was based on the proposed Extended GPU 
(E-GPU) model enabling multi-urn interactions. A 
comprehensive evaluation using real-life online 
reviews from multiple domains shows that MC-
LDA outperforms the state-of-the-art models sig-
nificantly and discovers aspects with high seman-
tic coherence. In our future work, we plan to 
incorporate aspect specific sentiments in the MC-
LDA model.
