Abstract 

Lemlat is a morphological analyser for Latin, 
which shows a remarkably wide coverage of 
the Latin lexicon. However, the performance 
of the tool is limited by the absence of proper 
names in its lexical basis. In this paper we 
present the extension of Lemlat with a large 
Onomasticon for Latin. First, we describe and 
motivate the automatic and manual proce-
dures for including the proper names in Lem-
lat. Then, we compare the new version of 
Lemlat with the previous one, by evaluating 
their lexical coverage of four Latin texts of 
different era and genre. 

1 Introduction 
Since the time of the Index Thomisticus by father 
Roberto Busa (Busa, 1974-1980), which is usual-
ly mentioned among the first electronic (nowa-
days called “digital”) annotated corpora availa-
ble, NLP tools for automatic morphological 
analysis and lemmatisation of a richly inflected 
language like Latin were needed. Over the last 
decades, this need was fulfilled by a number of 
morphological analysers for Latin. Among the 
most widespread ones are Morpheus (Crane, 
1991), Whitaker’s Words 
(http://archives.nd.edu/words.html) and Lemlat 
(Passarotti, 2004). Over the past ten years, such 
tools have become essential, in light of a number 
of projects aimed at developing advanced lan-
guage resources for Latin, like treebanks.1 

The most recent advances in linguistic annota-
tion of Latin treebanks are moving beyond the 

                                                
1 Three dependency treebanks are currently available for 
Latin: the Latin Dependency Treebank (Bamman and 
Crane, 2006), the Index Thomisticus Treebank (Passarotti, 
2009) and the Latin portion of the PROIEL corpus (Haug 
and Jøndal, 2008). 

level of syntax, by performing semantic-based 
tasks like semantic role labelling and anaphora 
and ellipsis resolution (Passarotti, 2014). In par-
ticular, in the area of Digital Humanities there is 
growing interest in Named Entity Recognition 
(NER), especially for purposes of geographical-
based analysis of texts. 

NER is a sub-branch of Information Extrac-
tion, whose inception goes back to the Sixth 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) 
(Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). NER aims at 
recognising and labelling (multi)words, as names 
of people, things, places, etc. Since MUC-6, 
NER has largely expanded, with several applica-
tions also on ancient languages (see, for exam-
ple, Depauw and Van Beek, 2009). 

Although Lemlat provides quite a large cover-
age of the Latin lexicon, its performance is lim-
ited by the absence of an Onomasticon in its lex-
ical basis, which would be helpful for tasks like 
NER. Given that in Latin proper names undergo 
morphological inflection, in this paper we de-
scribe our work of enhancing Lemlat with an 
Onomasticon. The paper is organised as follows. 
Section 2 presents the basic features of Lemlat. 
Section 3 describes our method to enhance Lem-
lat with an Onomasticon, by detailing the rules 
for the automatic enhancement and discussing 
the most problematic kinds of words. Section 4 
evaluates the rules and presents one experiment 
run on four Latin texts. Section 5 is a short con-
clusion and sketches the future work. 

2 Lemlat 
The lexical basis of Lemlat results from the col-
lation of three Latin dictionaries (Georges and 
Georges, 1913-1918; Glare, 1982; Gradenwitz, 
1904). It counts 40,014 lexical entries and 43,432 
lemmas, as more than one lemma can be includ-
ed into the same lexical entry.

Given an input wordform that is recognised by 
Lemlat, the tool produces in output the corre-
sponding lemma(s) and a number of tags convey-
ing (a) the inflectional paradigm of the lemma(s) 
(e.g. first declension noun) and (b) the morpho-
logical features of the input wordform (e.g. sin-
gular nominative), as well as the identification 
number (ID) of the lemma(s) in the lexical basis 
of Lemlat. No contextual disambiguation is per-
formed. 

For instance, receiving in input the wordform 
abamitae (“great-aunt”), Lemlat outputs the cor-
responding lemma (abamita, ID: A0019), the tags 
for its inflectional paradigm (N1: first declension 
noun) and those for the morphological features 
of the input wordform (feminine singular geni-
tive and dative; feminine plural nominative and 
vocative).  

The basic component of the lexical look-up 
table used by Lemlat to analyse input wordforms 
is the so-called LES (“LExical Segment”). The 
LES is defined as the invariable part of the in-
flected form (e.g. abamit for abamit-ae). In other 
words, the LES is the sequence (or one of the se-
quences) of characters that remains the same in 
the inflectional paradigm of a lemma (hence, the 
LES does not necessarily correspond to the word 
stem). 

Lemlat includes a LES archive, in which LES 
are assigned an ID and a number of inflectional 
features among which are a tag for the gender of 
the lemma (for nouns only) and a code (called 
CODLES) for its inflectional category. According 
to the CODLES, the LES is compatible with the 
endings of its inflectional paradigm. For in-
stance, the CODLES for the LES abamit is N1 (first 
declension nouns) and its gender is F (feminine). 
The wordform abamitae is thus analysed as be-
longing to the LES abamit because the segment -
ae is recognised as an ending compatible with a 
LES with CODLES N1. 

3 Enhancing Lemlat. Method 

The bedrock of our work is Busa’s (1988) Totius 
Latinitatis Lemmata, which contains the list of 
the lemmas (92,052) from the 5th edition of Lexi-
con Totius Latinitatis (Forcellini, 1940). In Busa 
(1988), three kinds of metadata are assigned to 
each lemma: (a) a code for the section of the dic-
tionary in which the lemma occurs (e.g. ON: the 
lemma occurs in the Onomasticon), (b) a code 
for the inflectional paradigm the lemma belongs 
to and its gender (e.g. BM: second declension 

masculine nouns) and (c) the number of lines of 
the lexical entry for the lemma in Forcellini. 

In order to enhance Lemlat with Forcellini’s 
Onomasticon, we first extracted from Busa 
(1988) the list of those lemmas that occur in the 
ON section. This list counts 28,178 lemmas. 
Then, we built a number of rules to automatically 
include the lemmas of the Onomasticon into the 
lexical basis of Lemlat. 

3.1 Types of Rules 
Including the Onomasticon of Forcellini into 
Lemlat means converting the list of proper 
names provided by Busa (1988) into the same 
format of the LES archive. In order to perform 
this task as automatically as possible, we built a 
number of rules to extract the relevant infor-
mation for each lemma in the list, namely its LES, 
CODLES and gender. By exploiting the morpho-
logical tagging of Busa (1988), which groups 
sets of lemmas showing common inflectional 
features, our rules treat automatically such in-
flectionally regular groups. In total, we wrote 
122 rules, which fall into four types. 

The first type (60 rules) builds the LES by re-
moving one or more characters from the right 
side of the lemma. Such a removal is constrained 
by the code for the inflectional paradigm of the 
lemma, which is then used to create both the 
CODLES and the tag for the gender. For instance, 
the lemma marcus (“Mark”) is assigned the in-
flectional paradigm BM in Busa (1988). One rule 
states that the LES for BM lemmas ending in -us is 
built by removing the last two characters from 
the lemma (marcus > marc) The inflectional 
code BM stands for second declension (B) mascu-
line (M) nouns: this is converted into the CODLES 
of Lemlat for second declension nouns (B > N2) 
and into the tag for masculine gender (M > m). 

The second type of rules (19) adds one or 
more characters on the right side of the lemma to 
build the LES. Again, this is done according both 
to the inflectional paradigm and to the ending of 
the lemma in Busa (1988). For instance, the LES 
for lemmas with inflectional code CM (third de-
clension masculine nouns) and ending in -o is 
built by adding an -n after the last character. One 
example is the lemma bappo (“Bappo”), whose 
LES is bappon, as third declension imparisyllable 
nouns are analysed by Lemlat by using the basis 
for their singular genitive (bappon-is). 

The third type of rules (19) replaces one or 
more characters on the right side of the lemma 
with others. For instance, the LES of clemens 
(“Clement”, third declension masculine noun 

91



ending in -s, with singular genitive clement-is) is 
built by replacing the final -s with a -t (clement).  

The last type of rules (24) deals with those 
lemmas that are equal to their LES (no change is 
needed). These are uninflected nouns, (like ha-
milcar - “Hamilcar”), which can be easily re-
trieved because they are assigned a specific in-
flectional code in Busa (1988). 

3.2 Problematic Cases 
Not all inflectional paradigms are as much regu-
lar as to allow for a fully automatic rule-based 
treatment.  

For instance, third declension feminine nouns 
represent an entangled class. The lemma charyb-
dis, -is (“Charybdis”) is a third declension pari-
syllable feminine noun ending in -is. Instead, 
phegis, -gidis (“daughter of Phegeus”) is a third 
declension imparisyllable feminine noun ending 
in -is. One common rule cannot be used for these 
two kinds of words. We overcome such problem 
by building two more specific rules: one ac-
counting for third declension feminine nouns 
ending in -dis and one for third declension femi-
nine nouns ending in -gis. However, there are 
sub-groups of nouns for which such a solution 
does not work, like third declension feminine 
nouns ending in -mis, which can be both impari-
syllable nouns (e.g. salamis, -minis, “Salamis”) 
and parisyllable nouns (e.g. tomis, -is, “Tomis”). 
For these lemmas we checked manually their 
inflection in Forcellini and assigned LES and 
CODLES accordingly. 

Another group of tricky words includes those 
lemmas that show two (or even more) different 
inflectional paradigms. For instance, apollonid-
es (“Apollonides”) shows both a singular geni-
tive of the second declension (in -i) and one of 
the first declension (in -ae). We treated these 
cases manually by checking their lexical entries 
in Forcellini. 

A further problem is represented by graphical 
variants, which are managed by Lemlat through 
so-called “exceptional forms”. These are word-
forms that are hard-coded in the LES archive and 
are assigned the same ID of the LES used to build 
their base lemma. For instance, the nominative 
singular of the lemma jesus (“Jesus”) is attested 
also as hiesus, ihesus and zesus. Beside the LES 
jes (used for the base lemma jesus), in the LES 
archive also the wordforms hiesus, ihesus and 
zesus are recorded and assigned the same ID of 
the LES jes. 

4 Evaluating the Enhancement 
We evaluated the enhancement of Lemlat with 
the Onomasticon of Forcellini in two steps. First, 
we focused on the accuracy of the rules for au-
tomatic enhancement. Then, we compared the 
new version of Lemlat with the previous one by 
the lexical coverage they provide for four Latin 
texts. 

4.1 Rules 
We evaluated the quality of the rules for auto-
matic enhancement by precision and recall (Van 
Rijsbergen, 1979). 

Measuring the precision of our rules is 
straightforward. As said, while writing the rules, 
we focused on inflectionally regular groups of 
lemmas. As a consequence, we never had to 
modify the output of rules neither in terms of 
removal of results (i.e. wrong results due to 
overproduction) nor in terms of completion of 
results (i.e. wrong results due to underproduc-
tion). Thus, the precision of our rules is always 
100%. 

To calculate recall, we grouped all those rules 
that treat lemmas of the same inflectional class 
(e.g. all rules for nouns of the first declension). 
We measured the recall of such groups of rules 
by comparing the number of lemmas automati-
cally inserted into Lemlat by one group of rules 
with the total number of lemmas in the Onomas-
ticon of Forcellini belonging to the inflectional 
class addressed by that group of rules. Table 1 
shows the results.

5th decl. 6 6 100% 
Uninflected 1,166 11,66 100% 
 26,184 24,664 94.194% 

 
Table 1: The recall of rules. 

 
The most problematic inflectional class is that 

of third declension nouns.2 As mentioned above, 
this is motivated by the fact that it is not always 

                                                
2 The rules for fourth declension nouns show an even lower 
recall than those for third declension, but the results for such 
class must be evaluated carefully as the lemmas of the 
fourth declension in the Onomasticon are just a few (50).

possible to match regularly an inflectional para-
digm (e.g. third declension imparisyllable nouns) 
with one specific ending. Hence, given such a 
low recall, the amount of manual work required 
for enhancing Lemlat with third declension prop-
er names was quite considerable. To provide an 
example, the number of third declension femi-
nine nouns in the Onomasticon is 1,200. Our 
rules covered only 542 out of them. Thus, 658 
nouns had to be inserted into Lemlat manually 
(54.833% of the total for that class). 

There are also entire inflectional classes for 
which writing a rule was not possible, like for 
instance Busa’s class of irregularly inflected 
nouns (146 wordforms). All these lemmas were 
inserted into the LES archive manually. 

In total, the number of lemmas transferred 
manually into Lemlat is 1,752 (6.632% of all the 
lemmas of the Onomasticon).  

4.2 Coverage 
We evaluated the enhancement of Lemlat with 
the Onomasticon of Forcellini by comparing the 
lexical coverage provided by the two versions of 
the tool for four Latin texts of similar size and 
different genre (prose and poetry) and era (Clas-
sical and Late Latin).3 Table 2 presents the num-
ber of distinct words (types) analysed by the 
original version of Lemlat and by the one en-
hanced with the Onomasticon (LemlatON).

downloaded from the Perseus Digital Library 
(www.perseus.tufts.edu). 

Most of the words not analysed by LemlatON 
are graphical variants (e.g. creüsa for creusa - 
“Creusa”) or part of the inflectional paradigm of 
lemmas not available in its lexical basis. Beside 
these words, there are Roman numbers (e.g. XV, 
“fifteen”), abbreviations (e.g. kal for kalendae, 
“calends”) and foreign words (e.g. µητέρα, 
“mother”).4 Table 3 shows the results by catego-
ry of unknown words (types).

(4) 52 0 1 3 48 

 
Table 3: Categories of unknown words.5 

 
Roman numbers are frequent in Caesar’s text 

(1). The fact that Lemlat does not analyse Roman 
numbers is not a major concern, as their form is 
regular, easily predictable and interpretable. On-
ly a few of them can raise ambiguity when writ-
ten lowercase. For instance, vi (“six”) is homo-
graph with the singular ablative of the third de-
clension noun vis (“power”). 

Homography can hold also between items of 
of the Onomasticon and the original lexical basis 
of Lemlat. For instance, the lemma augustus oc-
curs both in the original Lemlat (a first class ad-
jective, “solemn”) and in the Onomasticon (a 
proper name, “Augustus”). 

If we look at tokens instead of types, coverage 
rates remain quite similar, as it is shown by Ta-
ble 4.

It is worth noting that, while the text of Virgil 
shows the highest improvement in type-based 
evaluation (+5.7%), Caesar’s De Bello Gallico is 
the one that mostly benefits from the extension 
of Lemlat with the Onomasticon in token-based 
evaluation (+6.64%). This is due to the higher 
number of occurrences of proper names in Cae-
sar than in Virgil. Indeed, although the number 
of new word types analysed by LemlatON in 
comparison to Lemlat is lower for Caesar than 
for Virgil, the opposite holds when tokens are 
concerned.6 In more detail, the average number 
of occurrences (tokens) of the new word types 
analysed by LemlatON for Caesar is 3.59 
(542/151), while it is 1.71 for Virgil (493/288). 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper we described the enhancing of the 
morphological analyser for Latin Lemlat with a 
large Onomasticon provided by a reference dic-
tionary for Latin (Forcellini). 

Although we have included most of the words 
of the Onomasticon into Lemlat, the work is far 
from being complete. Indeed, we have just start-
ed to enhance the analyser with graphical vari-
ants. Furthermore, around 2,000 words of the 
Onomasticon belonging to minor and irregular 
inflectional classes still have to be included into 
Lemlat. Although this promises to be a largely 
manual and time-consuming work, it is worth 
doing for achieving the lexicographically moti-
vated completeness of the tool’s lexical basis. 

Once completed, the lexical look-up table of 
the Onomasticon will become part of the overall 
Lemlat suite, which will be shortly made availa-
ble for free download and on-line use.
