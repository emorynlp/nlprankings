Abstract 

Light verbs pose an a challenge in linguistics because of its syntactic and semantic versatility and  its 

unique distribution different from regular verbs with higher semantic content and selectional resrictions. 

Due to its light grammatical content, earlier natural language processing studies typically put light verbs 

in a stop word list and ignore them. Recently, however, classification and identification of light verbs 

and light verb construction have become a focus of study in computational linguistics, especially in the 

context of multi-word expression, information retrieval, disambiguation, and parsing. Past linguistic and 

computational studies on light verbs had very different foci. Linguistic studies tend to focus on the sta-

tus of light verbs and its various selectional constraints. While NLP studies have focused on light verbs 

in the context of either a multi-word expression (MWE) or a construction to be identified, classified, or 

translated, trying to overcome the apparent poverty of semantic content of light verbs. There has been 

nearly no work attempting to bridge these two lines of research. This paper takes this challenge by pro-

posing a corpus-bases study which classifies and captures syntactic-semantic difference among all light 

verbs. In this study, we first incorporate results from past linguistic studies to create annotated light verb 

corpora with syntactic-semantics features. We next adopt a statistic method for automatic identification 

of light verbs based on this annotated corpora. Our results show that a language resource based method-

ology optimally incorporating linguistic information can resolve challenges posed by light verbs in NLP. 

 

1 Introduction 

Identification of Light Verb Construction (LVC) plays an important role and poses a special challenge 

in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, e.g. information retrieval and machine 

translation. In addition to addressing issues related to LVC as a contributing factor to errors for vari-

ous applications, a few computational linguistics studies have targeted LVC in English specifically 

(e.g., Tu and Roth, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013). To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no 

computational linguistic study dealing with LVCs in Chinese specifically. It is important to know that, 

due to their lack of semantic content, light verbs can behave rather idiosyncratically in each language. 

Chinese LVC, in particular, has the characteristic that allows many different light verbs to share simi-

lar usage and be interchangeable in some context. We should also note that light verbs in Chinese can 

take both verbs, deverabal nouns, and eventive nouns, while the morphological status of these catego-

ries are typically unmarked, Hence, it is often difficult to differentiate a light verb from its non-light 

verb uses without careful analysis of the data. 

      It has been observed that some Chinese light verbs can be used interchangeably but will have 

different selectional restrictions in some (and generally more limited) contexts. For example, the five 

light verbs congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo (these words originally meant ‘engage’, ‘do’, ‘inflict’, 
‘proceed’, ‘do’ respectively) can all take yanjiu ‘to do research’ as their complement and form a LVC. 

However, only the light verbs gao and jinxing can take bisai ‘to play games’ as complements, where-
as the other light verbs congshi, jiayi, and zuo cannot. Since light verbs are often interchangeable yet

each also has its own selectional restrictions, it makes the identification of light verbs themselves both 

a challenging and necessary task. It is also observed that this kind of selectional versatility actually led 

to variations among different variants of Mandarin Chinese, such as Mainland and Taiwan. The versa-

tility of Chinese light verbs makes the identification of LVCs more complicated than English. 

Therefore, to study the differences among different light verbs and different variants of Chinese is 

important but challenging in both linguistic studies and computational applications. With annotated 

data from comparable corpora of Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese, this paper proposes both 

statistical and machine learning approaches to differentiate five most frequently used light verbs in 

both variants based on their syntactic and semantic features. The experimental results of our approach 

show that we can reliably differentiate different light verbs from each other in each variety of Manda-

rin Chinese.  

There are several contributions in our work. Firstly, rather than focusing on only two light verbs 

jiayi and jinxing as in previous linguistic studies, we extended the study to more light verbs that are 

frequently used in Chinese. Actually, we will show that although jiayi and jinxing were often dis-

cussed in a pair in previous literature, the two are quite different from each other. Secondly, we show 

that statistical analysis and machine learning approaches are effective to identify the differences of 

light verbs and the variations demonstrated by the same light verb in different variants of Chinese. 

Thirdly, we provide a corpus that covers all typical uses of Chinese light verbs. Finally, the feature set 

we used in our study could be potentially used in the identification of Chinese LVCs in NLP applica-

tions. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and annotation of the data. In Sec-

tion 3, we conducted both statistical and machine learning methodologies to classify the five light 

verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. We discussed the implications and applications of our 

methodologies and the findings of our study in Section 4. Section 5 presents the conclusion and our 

future work. 

2 Corpus Annotation 

2.1 Data Collection 

The data for this study is extracted from Annotated Chinese Gigaword corpus (Huang, 2009) which 

was collected and available from LDC and contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, with 700 million 

characters from Taiwan Central News Agency and 400 million characters from Mainland Xinhua 

News Agency.  

The light verbs to be studied are congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo; these five are among the most fre-

quently used light verbs in Chinese (Diao, 2004). 400 sentences are randomly selected for each light 

verb, half from the Mainland Gigaword subcorpus and the other from the Taiwan Gigaword subcorpus, 

which resulted in 2,000 sentences in total. The selection follows the principle that it could cover the 

different uses of each light verb.  

2.2 Feature Annotation 

Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2013, among 

others) have proposed several syntactic and semantic features to identify the similarities and differ-

ences among light verbs, especially between the two most typical ones, i.e. jinxing (originally ‘pro-

ceed’) and jiayi (originally ‘inflict’). For example, jinxing can take aspectual markers like zhe ‘pro-

gressive marker’, le ‘aspect marker’, and guo ‘experiential aspect marker’ while jiayi cannot (Zhou, 

1987);  congshi can take nominal phrases such as disan chanye‘the tertiary industry’ as its comple-
ment while jiayi cannot. A few features are also found to be variant-specific; for example, Huang and 

Lin (2013) find that only the congshi in Taiwan, but not in Mainland Mandarin, can take informal and 

negative event complements like xingjiaoyi ‘sexual trade’. 

In our study, we selected 11 features which may help to differentiate different light verbs in each 

Mandarin variant as well as light verb variations among Mandarin variants, as in Table 1. All 2,000 

examples collected for analysis were manually annotated based on the 11 features. The annotator is a 

trained expert on Chinese linguistics. Any ambiguous cases were discussed with another two experts 

in order to reach an agreement.

3 Identification of light verbs based on annotated corpora  

In this section, we adopted both statistical analysis and machine learning approaches to identify the 

five light verbs (jiayi, jinxing, congshi, gao and zuo) on the corpora with 2,000 annotated examples. 

The results of all approaches show that the five light verbs can be differentiated from each other in 

both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 

3.1 Identifying light verbs by statistical analysis 

Both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used in our study for the identification. The 

tool we used is the Polytomous Package in R (Arppe, 2008).

3.1.1 Univariate analysis  
Among the 11 independent features, one was found with only one level in both Mainland and Taiwan 

variants, i.e. all five light verbs in the two variants show the same preference over the features and 

thus excluded from the analysis. The feature is OTHERLV (all light verbs do not co-occur with another 

light verb in a sentence). Chi-squared tests were conducted for the significance of the co-occurrence of 

the remaining ten features with individual light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan variants. The 

chisq.posthoc() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R was used for the tests. The 

results are presented in Table 2, where the “+” and “-” signs indicate respectively a statistically signif-

icant overuse and underuse of a light verb with a feature, and “0” refers to a lack of statistical signifi-

cance.

Table 2: Identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via univariate analysis.  

 

Table 2 suggests that in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, each light verb shows significant 

preference for certain features, and thus can be distinguished from each other. For example, in Main-

land Mandarin, although both congshi and gao show significant preference for the features POS.N and 

ACCOMPEVT.no, congshi differs from gao in that it also significantly prefers DUREVT.yes (taking 

complements denoting durative events, e.g., yanjiu ‘to research’), EVECOMP.no (event complements 

do not occur in subject position), and INTEREVT.no (not taking complements denoting events involv-

ing interaction among participants, e.g., taolun ‘to discuss’), whereas gao shows either a dis-

preference or no significant preference over these features. Take gao and zuo in Taiwan Mandarin as 

another example. While both light verbs literally means ‘to do’, there is no single feature preferred by 

both: gao prefers POS.N, ARGSTR.zero, FOREVT.yes, INTEREVT.no, ACCOMPEVT.no, whereas zuo 

shows significant preferences for POS.V, ARGSTR.two, ASP.le, and PSYEVT.yes.  
 

3.1.2 Multivariate analysis  
As shown in Table 2, in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, some of the five light verbs share some 

features, which thus explains why sometimes they can be interchangeably used. This also indicates (a) 

that a particular feature is unlikely to be preferred by only one light verb and thus differentiates the 

verb from the others; (b) a certain context may allow the occurrence of more than one light verb. In 

78



this sense, a multivariate analysis was adopted to better classify the five light verbs in each variant. 

The multivariate analysis used in the current study is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe, 2008), 

and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R.  

The results from the multivariate analysis were summarized in Table 3.  The numbers shown in the 

table are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: when the 

estimated odd is larger than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased by 

the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo 

(76.47:1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), and PSYEVTyes (19.87: 1). 

When the estimated odd is smaller than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly 

decreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jinxing occurring is significantly decreased by 

ACCOMPEVTyes (0.1849: 1); in addition, “inf” and “1/inf” refer to odds larger than 10,000 and 

smaller than 1/10,000 respectively, whereas non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given in paren-

theses.

Table 3: identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via multivariate analysis.  

 

   As shown in Table 3, each of the light verbs in each Mandarin variant shows its favor and disfavor 

of certain features. Take Mainland Mandarin for example: although congshi has no feature significant-

ly in its favor, but it is significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (0.27:1) and ITEREVTyes (0.03:1); gao 

is disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (0.02:1), and ACCOMPEVTyes (0.1:1), but is 

significantly favored by ARGSTRtwo and ARGSTRzero; the chance of jiayi’s ocucrrence is significant-

ly increased by ARGSTRtwo(76.47:1), ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54:1), and 

PSYEVTyes (19:87:1); jinxing has INTEREVTyes and EVECOMPyes in its favor, but ACOMPEVTyes 

in its disfavor; no feature is significantly in the favor of zuo, but this light verb is significantly disfa-

vored by ARGSTRtwo, ARGSTRzero, FOREVTyes and INTEREVTyes.   

     The results in Table 3 also show that sometimes one key feature is able to identify two light verbs 

from each other, although not all five light verbs. Take Mainland Mandarin again for example. Most 

combinations of two light verbs from the five can be effectively differentiated by one feature. For in-

stance, the feature ARGSTRtwo can differentiate congshi/gao, congshi/jiayi, jiayi/zuo and gao/zuo; the 

feature INTEREVTyes can differentiate congshi/jinxing and jinxing/zuo; the feature ACCOMPEVTyes 

can differentiate the pairs gao/jiayi and jinxing/jiayi. 

3.2 Identifying light verbs by classification 

In this section, we resorted to machine learning technologies to study the same issue. Different classi-

fiers were adopted to discriminate the five light verbs with the annotated corpora: ID3, Logistic Re-

gression, Naïve Bayesian and SVM that are implemented in WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) and 10-fold 

cross validations were performed separately on the Taiwan and Mainland corpora.  

79



The results were presented in Table 4. We can see that different classifiers provide similar results 

on both corpora, which means that the classification results are reliable and the features we annotated 

are effective in identifying the five light verbs. Overall, ID3 out-performs SVM slightly, with Logistic 

and NB not far behind. ID3 performs the best since the data is in low dimension. The detailed results 

including precision, recall and F-measure by ID3 on both corpora are shown in Table 5. The corre-

sponding confusion matrixes are presented in Table 6. The confusion matrixes suggest two very im-

portant generalizations: (a) all five verbs can be classified with good confidence, and (b) the overall 

classification patterns of the Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are very similar, which is consistent with 

the fact that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are two variants. However, we also observe that the con-

fusion matrixes between various light verb pairs may differ between Mainland and Taiwan Chineses. 

This is the difference we would like to explore in the next section to propose a way to automatically 

predict these two variants. In addition, it is worth noting that all classifiers identify jiayi more effec-

tively than other light verbs, which thus shows a potential different usage of jiayi from the others.

3.3 Identifying light verbs by automatic clustering 

We further used the clustering algorithm to test the differentiability of the five light verbs in both 

Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. The results using the simple K-Means clustering algorithm on Tai-

wan and Mainland corpora are shown in Table 7. The results show that the light verb jiayi behaves 

80



quite differently from the other four light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan corpora, which is similar 

to the analysis based on statistical methods in Section 3.1 and classification methods in Section 3.2. In 

both corpora, jiayi has a narrower usage than the other light verbs. Meanwhile, we can also find a clus-

ter which is mainly formed by instances of jiayi from the Mainland corpus (i.e. cluster 0). After closer 

examination of the examples in this cluster, we found that it mainly includes sentences where jiayi 

takes complements denoting accomplishment events, e.g. gaizheng ‘to correct’ and jiejue ‘to solve’. 

However, jiayi in Taiwan corpus mainly takes complements denoting activity events, and thus almost 

all instances of Taiwan jiayi are mixed with those of the other light verbs. Meanwhile, our results 

show a tendency that all other light verbs (jinxing, congshi, zuo, and gao) mostly take activity com-

plements but fewer accomplishment complements in both Taiwan and Mainland corpora. More dis-

cussion on the light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin can be found in (Huang 

et al., 2014).

4 Applications and Implications 

4.1 Implications for Future Studies 

In the study above, we were able to annotate a corpus with all the types of significant context and, 

based on this annotated corpus, we were able to use statistic model to differentiate the use of different 

light verbs in different contexts. Such a module of generic linguistic tools can have several potentially 

very useful applications. First, in translation, LVC is one of the most difficult constructions as there is 

less grammatical or contextual information to make the correct translation. Our approach is especially 

promising. As we encode contextual selection information for all light verbs, the same approach can 

be applied to the other languages in the target-source pair to produce optimal pair. Second, in infor-

mation extraction, selection of different light verbs often conveys subtle difference in meanings. Our 

ability to differentiate similar light verbs in the same context could have great potential in extracting 

the subtle information change/increase in the same context. Lastly, in second language learning as well 

as error detection, light verbs have been one of the most challenging ones. Our studies can be readily 

applied to either error detection or second language learning environment to provide the correct con-

text where a certain light very is preferred over another. 

4.2 From light verb variations to variants for the same language 

One of the biggest challenges in computational processing of languages is probably to identify newly 

emergent variants, such as the cross-strait variations of Mandarin Chinese. For these two variants, the 

most commonly cited ones were on lexical differences. Systematic grammatical differences were 

much more difficult to study and hence rarely reported (comp. Huang et al., 2009). As these are two 

newly divergent variants, their main grammars are almost all identical, except for some subtle differ-

ences, such as the selection between different light verbs and their complements. Our preliminary re-

sults of univariate and multivariate analysis can be found in Table 2 and 3. It shows not only the simi-

larities/differences among the light verbs in each variety (e.g., both ML and TW congshi and gao 

show preferences over POS.N, whereas both ML and TW jiayi show dispreference), but also the simi-

larities/differences of the corresponding light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. For instance, 

jinxing in TW tends to take VO compounds as its complements e.g., jinxing toupiao “cast a vote”, 

81



which is consistent with the analysis in (Huang et al., 2013) (see more in Huang et al., 2014). But one 

thing should be pointed out is the difference is more between a significant and non-significant feature, 

rather than between a significant positive and significant negative feature.  

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we addressed the issue of automatic classification of Chinese light verbs based on their 

usage distribution, based on an annotated corpus marking relevant contextual information for light 

verbs. We used both statistical methods and machine learning technologies to address this issue. It is 

found that our approaches are effective in identifying light verbs and their variations. The automatic 

generated semantic and syntactic features can also be used for future studies on other light verbs as 

well as other lexical categories. The result suggested that richly annotated language resources paired 

with appropriate tool can lead to effective general solution for some common issues faced by linguis-

tics and natural language processing.
