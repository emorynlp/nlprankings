Abstract

Though data-driven in nature, emotion analy-
sis based on latent semantic analysis still relies
on some measure of expert knowledge in or-
der to isolate the emotional keywords or key-
sets necessary to the construction of affective
categories. This makes it vulnerable to any
discrepancy between the ensuing taxonomy of
affective states and the underlying domain of
discourse. This paper proposes a more gen-
eral strategy which leverages two distincts se-
mantic levels, one that encapsulates the foun-
dations of the domain considered, and one that
specifically accounts for the overall affective
fabric of the language. Exposing the emergent
relationship between these two levels advan-
tageously informs the emotion classification
process. Empirical evidence suggests that this
is a promising solution for automatic emotion
detection in text.

1 Introduction

The automatic detection of emotions in text is
a necessary pre-processing step in many differ-
ent fields touching on affective computing (Picard,
1997), such as natural language interfaces (Cosatto
et al., 2003), e-learning environments (Ryan et al.,
2000), educational or entertainment games (Pivec
and Kearney, 2007), opinion mining and sentiment
analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008), humor recognition
(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2006), and security in-
formatics (Abbasi, 2007). In the latter case, for ex-
ample, it can be used for monitoring levels of hate-
ful or violent rhetoric (perhaps in multilingual set-
tings). More generally, emotion detection is of great

interest in human-computer interaction: if a system
determines that a user is upset or annoyed, for in-
stance, it could switch to a different mode of inter-
action (Liscombe et al., 2005). And of course, it
plays a critical role in the generation of expressive
synthetic speech (Schröder, 2006).

Emphasis has traditionally been placed on the set
of six “universal” emotions (Ekman, 1993): ANGER,
DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, and SURPRISE
(Alm et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2003; Subasic and Huet-
tner, 2001). Emotion analysis is typically carried out
using a simplified description of emotional states in
a low-dimensional space, which normally comprises
dimensions such as valence (positive/negative eva-
lution), activation (stimulation of activity), and/or
control (dominant/submissive power) (Mehrabian,
1995; Russell, 1980; Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2008). Classification proceeds based on an underly-
ing emotional knowledge base, which strives to pro-
vide adequate distinctions between different emo-
tions. This affective information can either be built
entirely upon manually selected vocabulary as in
(Whissell, 1989), or derived automatically from data
based on expert knowledge of the most relevant fea-
tures that can be extracted from the input text (Alm
et al., 2005). In both cases, the resulting system
tends to rely, for the most part, on a few thousand
annotated “emotional keywords,” the presence of
which triggers the associated emotional label(s).

The drawback of such confined lexical affinity is
that the analysis tends to be hampered by the bias
inherent in the underlying taxonomy of emotional
states. Because this taxonomy only supports simpli-
fied relationships between affective words and emo-

1



tional categories, it often fails to meaningfully gen-
eralize beyond the relatively few core terms explic-
itly considered in its construction. This has sparked
interest in data-driven approaches based on latent
semantic analysis (LSA), a paradigm originally de-
veloped for information retrieval (Deerwester et al.,
1990). Upon suitable training using a large corpus
of texts, LSA allows a similarity score to be com-
puted between generic terms and affective categories
(Strapparava et al., 2006). This way, every word can
automatically be assigned some fractional affective
influence. Still, the affective categories themselves
are usually specified with the help of a reference lex-
ical database like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).

The purpose of this paper is to more broadly lever-
age the principle of latent semantics in emotion anal-
ysis. We cast the problem as a general application
of latent semantic mapping (LSM), an extrapolation
of LSA for modeling global relationships implicit
in large volumes of data (Bellegarda, 2005; Belle-
garda, 2008). More specifically, we use the LSM
framework to describe two distinct semantic levels:
one that encapsulates the foundations of the domain
considered (e.g., broadcast news, email messages,
SMS conversations, etc.), and one that specifically
accounts for the overall affective fabric of the lan-
guage. Then, we leverage these two descriptions
to appropriately relate domain and affective levels,
and thereby inform the emotion classification pro-
cess. This de facto bypasses the need for any explicit
external knowledge.

The paper is organized as follows. The next sec-
tion provides some motivation for, and gives an
overview of, the proposed latent affective frame-
work. In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the two main
alternatives considered, latent folding and latent em-
bedding. In Section 5, we discuss the mechanics
of emotion detection based on such latent affective
processing. Finally, Section 6 reports the outcome
of experimental evaluations conducted on the “Af-
fective Text” portion of the SemEval-2007 corpus
(Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).

2 Motivation and Overview

As alluded to above, lexical affinity alone fails
to provide sufficient distinction between different
emotions, in large part because only relatively few

words have inherently clear, unambiguous emo-
tional meaning. For example, happy and sad encap-
sulate JOY and SADNESS, respectively, in all con-
ceivable scenarios. But is thrilling a marker of JOY
or SURPRISE? Does awful capture SADNESS or DIS-
GUST? It largely depends on contextual informa-
tion: thrilling as a synonym for uplifting conveys
JOY (as in a thrilling speech), while thrilling as a
synonym for amazing may well mark SURPRISE (as
in a thrilling waterfall ride); similarly, awful as a
synonym for grave reflects SADNESS (as in an aw-
ful car accident), while awful as a synonym for foul
is closer to DISGUST (as in an awful smell). The vast
majority of words likewise carry multiple potential
emotional connotations, with the degree of affective
polysemy tightly linked to the granularity selected
for the underlying taxonomy of emotions.

Data-driven approaches based on LSA purport
to “individuate” such indirect affective words via
inference mechanisms automatically derived in an
unsupervised way from a large corpus of texts,
such as the British National Corpus (Strapparava
et al., 2006). By looking at document-level co-
occurrences, contextual information is exploited to
encapsulate semantic information into a relatively
low dimensional vector space. Suitable affective cat-
egories are then constructed in that space by “folding
in” either the specific word denoting the emotion, or
its associated synset (say, from WordNet), or even
the entire set of words in all synsets that can be la-
belled with that emotion (Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2008). This is typically done by placing the rele-
vant word(s) into a “pseudo-document,” and map it
into the space as if it were a real one (Deerwester et
al., 1990). Finally, the global emotional affinity of a
given input text is determined by computing similar-
ities between all pseudo-documents. The resulting
framework is depicted in Fig. 1.

This solution is attractive, if for no other reason
than it allows every word to automatically be as-
signed some fractional affective influence. However,
it suffers from two limitations which may well prove
deleterious in practical situations. First, the inherent
lack of supervision routinely leads to a latent seman-
tic space which is not particularly representative of
the underlying domain of discourse. And second,
the construction of the affective categories still relies
heavily on pre-defined lexical affinity, potentially re-
sulting in an unwarranted bias in the taxonomy of
affective states.

The first limitation impinges on the effectiveness
of any LSA-based approach, which is known to vary
substantially based on the size and quality of the
training data (Bellegarda, 2008; Mohler and Mihal-
cea, 2009). In the present case, any discrepancy
between latent semantic space and domain of dis-
course may distort the position of certain words in
the space, which could in turn lead to subsequent
sub-optimal affective weight assignment. For in-
stance, in the examples above, the word smell is con-
siderably more critical to the resolution of awful as
a marker of DISGUST than the word car. But that
fact may never be uncovered if the only pertinent
documents in the training corpus happen to be about
expensive fragrances and automobiles. Thus, it is
highly desirable to derive the latent semantic space
using data representative of the application consid-
ered. This points to a modicum of supervision.

The second limitation is tied to the difficulty of
coming up with an a priori affective description that
will work universally. Stipulating the affective cat-
egories using only the specific word denoting the
emotion is likely to be less robust than using the set
of words in all synsets labelled with that emotion.
On the other hand, the latter may well expose some
inherent ambiguities resulting from affective poly-
semy. This is compounded by the relatively small
number of words for which an affective distribution
is even available. For example, the well-known Gen-
eral Inquirer content analysis system (Stone, 1997)
lists only about 2000 words with positive outlook
and 2000 words with negative outlook. There are ex-
actly 1281 words inventoried in the affective exten-
sion of WordNet (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008),
and the affective word list from (Johnson–Laird and
Oatley, 1989) comprises less than 1000 words. This

considerably complicates the construction of reli-
able affective categories in the latent space.

To address the two limitations above, we pro-
pose to more broadly leverage the LSM paradigm
(Bellegarda, 2005; Bellegarda, 2008), following the
overall framework depicted in Fig. 2. Compared to
Fig. 1, we inject some supervision at two separate
levels: not only regarding the particular domain con-
sidered, but also how the affective categories them-
selves are defined. The first task is to exploit a suit-
able training collection to encapsulate into a (do-
main) latent semantic space the general foundations
of the domain at hand. Next, we leverage a sepa-
rate affective corpus, such as mood-annotated blog
entries from LiveJournal.com (Strapparava and Mi-
halcea, 2008), to serve as a descriptive blueprint for
the construction of affective categories.

This blueprint is then folded into the domain
space in one of two ways. The easiest approach,
called latent affective folding, is simply to super-
impose affective anchors inferred in the space for
every affective category. This is largely analogous
to what happens in Fig. 1, with a crucial difference
regarding the representation of affective categories:
in latent affective folding, it is derived from a cor-
pus of texts as opposed to a pre-specified keyword
or keyset. This is likely to help making the cat-
egories more robust, but may not satisfactorily re-
solve subtle distinctions between emotional conno-
tations. This technique is described in detail in the
next section.

The second approach, called latent affective em-
bedding, is to extract a distinct LSM representation

from the affective corpus, to encapsulate all prior
affective information into a separate (affective) la-
tent semantic space. In this space, affective anchors
can be computed directly, instead of inferred after
folding, presumably leading to a more accurate posi-
tioning. Domain and affective LSM spaces can then
be related to each other via a mapping derived from
words that are common to both. This way, the af-
fective anchors can be precisely embedded into the
domain space. This technique is described in detail
in Section 4.

In both cases, the input text is mapped into the
domain space as before. Emotion classification then
follows from assessing how closely it aligns with
each affective anchor.

3 Latent Affective Folding

Expanding the basic framework of Fig. 2 to take into
account the two separate phases of training and anal-
ysis, latent affective folding proceeds as illustrated
in Fig. 3.

Let T1, |T1| = N1, be a collection of training texts
(be they sentences, paragraphs, or documents) re-
flecting the domain of interest, and V1, |V1| = M1,
the associated set of all words (possibly augmented
with some strategic word pairs, triplets, etc., as ap-
propriate) observed in this collection. Generally, M1
is on the order of several tens of thousands, while N1
may be as high as a million.

We first construct a (M1×N1) matrix W1, whose
elements wij suitably reflect the extent to which
each word wi ∈ V1 appeared in each text tj ∈ T1.

From (Bellegarda, 2008), a reasonable expression
for wij is:

wi,j = (1− εi)
ci,j
nj

, (1)

where ci,j is the number of times wi occurs in text
tj , nj is the total number of words present in this
text, and εi is the normalized entropy of wi in V1.
The global weighting implied by 1 − εi reflects the
fact that two words appearing with the same count in
a particular text do not necessarily convey the same
amount of information; this is subordinated to the
distribution of words in the entire set V1.

We then perform a singular value decomposition
(SVD) of W1 as (Bellegarda, 2008):

W1 = U1 S1 V T1 , (2)

where U1 is the (M1 ×R1) left singular matrix with
row vectors u1,i (1 ≤ i ≤ M1), S1 is the (R1 ×R1)
diagonal matrix of singular values s1,1 ≥ s1,2 ≥
. . . ≥ s1,R1 > 0, V1 is the (N1 × R1) right sin-
gular matrix with row vectors v1,j (1 ≤ j ≤ N1),
R1 � M1, N1 is the order of the decomposition,
and T denotes matrix transposition.

As is well known, both left and right singular
matrices U1 and V1 are column-orthonormal, i.e.,
U T1 U1 = V

T
1 V1 = IR1 (the identity matrix of order

R1). Thus, the column vectors of U1 and V1 each
define an orthornormal basis for the space of dimen-
sion R1 spanned by the u1,i’s and v1,j’s. We refer
to this space as the latent semantic space L1. The
(rank-R1) decomposition (2) encapsulates a map-
ping between the set of words wi and texts tj and
(after apropriate scaling by the singular values) the
set of R1-dimensional vectors y1,i = u1,iS1 and
z1,j = v1,jS1.

The basic idea behind (2) is that the rank-R1 de-
composition captures the major structural associa-
tions in W1 and ignores higher order effects. Hence,
the relative positions of the input words in the space
L1 reflect a parsimonious encoding of the semantic
concepts used in the domain considered. This means
that any new text mapped onto a vector “close” (in
some suitable metric) to a particular set of words can
be expected to be closely related to the concept en-
capsulated by this set. If each of these words is then
scored in terms of their affective affinity, this offers
a way to automatically predict the overall emotional
affinity of the text.

4



In order to do so, we need to isolate regions in
that space which are representative of the underly-
ing taxonomy of emotions considered. The centroid
of each such region is the affective anchor associ-
ated with that basic emotion. Affective anchors are
superimposed onto the space L1 on the basis of the
affective corpus available.

Let T2, |T2| = N2, represent a separate collection
of mood-annotated texts (again they could be sen-
tences, paragraphs, or documents), representative of
the desired categories of emotions (such as JOY and
SADNESS), and V2, |V2| = M2, the associated set of
words or expressions observed in this collection. As
such affective data may be more difficult to gather
than regular texts (especially in annotated form), in
practice N2 < N1.

Further let V12, |V12| = M12, represent the in-
tersection between V1 and V2. We will denote the
representations of these words in L1 by λ1,k (1 ≤
k ≤M12).

Clearly, it is possible to form, for each 1 ≤ � ≤ L,
where L is the number of distinct emotions consid-
ered, each subset V(�)12 of all entries from V12 which
is aligned with a particular emotion.1 We can then
compute:

ẑ1,� =
1

|V(�)12 |
∑

V(�)12

λ1,k , (3)

as the affective anchor of emotion � (1 ≤ � ≤ L)
in the domain space. The notation ẑ1,� is chosen to
underscore the connection with z1,j : in essence, ẑ1,�
represents the (fictitious) text in the domain space
that would be perfectly aligned with emotion �, had
it been seen the training collection T1. Comparing
the representation of an input text to each of these
anchors therefore leads to a quantitative assessment
for the overall emotional affinity of the text.

A potential drawback of this approach is that (3) is
patently sensitive to the distribution of words within
T2, which may be quite different from the distribu-
tion of words within T1. In such a case, “folding in”
the affective anchors as described above may well
introduce a bias in the position of the anchors in the
domain space. This could in turn lead to an inability
to satisfactorily resolve subtle distinctions between
emotional connotations.

1Note that one entry could conceivably contribute to several
such subsets.

4 Latent Affective Embedding

To remedy this situation, a natural solution is to
build a separate LSM space from the affective train-
ing data. Referring back to the basic framework
of Fig. 2 and taking into account the two separate
phases of training and analysis as in Fig. 3, latent af-
fective embedding proceeds as illustrated in Fig. 4.

The first task is to group all N2 documents present
in T2 into L bins, one for each of the emotions con-
sidered. Then we can construct a (M2 × L) matrix
W2, whose elements w′k,� suitably reflect the extent
to which each word or expression w′k ∈ V2 appeared
in each affective category c�, 1 ≤ � ≤ L. This leads
to:

w′k,� = (1− ε′k)
c′k,�
n′�

, (4)

with c′k,�, n
′
�, and ε

′
k following definitions analogous

to (1), albeit with domain texts replaced by affective
categories.

We then perform the SVD of W2 in a similar vein
as (2):

W2 = U2 S2 V T2 , (5)

where all definitions are analogous. As before,
both left and right singular matrices U2 and V2 are
column-orthonormal, and their column vectors each
define an orthornormal basis for the space of dimen-
sion R2 spanned by the u2,k’s and v2,�’s. We refer
to this space as the latent affective space L2. The

5



(rank-R2) decomposition (5) encapsulates a map-
ping between the set of words w′k and categories c�
and (after apropriate scaling by the singular values)
the set of R2-dimensional vectors y2,k = u2,kS2 and
z2,� = v2,�S2.

Thus, each vector z2,� can be viewed as the cen-
troid of an emotion in L2, or, said another way, an
affective anchor in the affective space. Since their
relative positions reflect a parsimonious encoding of
the affective annotations observed in the emotion
corpus, these affective anchors now properly take
into account any accidental skew in the distribution
of words which contribute to them. All that remains
to do is map them back to the domain space.

This is done on the basis of words that are com-
mon to both the affective space and the domain
space, i.e., the words in V12. Since these words were
denoted by λ1,k in L1, we similarly denote them by
λ2,k (1 ≤ k ≤M12) in L2.

Now let μ1, μ2 and Σ1, Σ2 denote the mean vec-
tor and covariance matrix for all observations λ1,k
and λ2,k in the two spaces, respectively. We first
transform each feature vector as:

λ̄1,k = Σ
−1/2
1 (λ1,k − μ1) , (6)

λ̄2,k = Σ
−1/2
2 (λ2,k − μ2) , (7)

so that the resulting sets {λ̄1,k} and {λ̄2,k} each have
zero mean and identity covariance matrix.

For this purpose, the inverse square root of each
covariance matrix can be obtained as:

Σ−1/2 = QΔ−1/2QT , (8)

where Q is the eigenvector matrix of the covariance
matrix Σ, and Δ is the diagonal matrix of corre-
sponding eigenvalues. This applies to both domain
and affective data.

We next relate each vector λ̄2,k in the affective
space to the corresponding vector λ̄1,k in the do-
main space. For a relative measure of how the two
spaces are correlated with each other, as accumu-
lated on a common word basis, we first project λ̄1,k
into the unit sphere of same dimension as λ̄2,k, i.e.,
R2 = min(R1, R2). We then compute the (normal-
ized) cross-covariance matrix between the two unit
sphere representations, specified as:

K12 =
M12∑

k=1

Pλ̄1,kP
T λ̄T2,k , (9)

where P is the R1 to R2 projection matrix. Note
that K12 is typically full rank as long as M12 > R22.
Performing the SVD of K12 yields the expression:

K12 = ΦΩΨT , (10)

where as before Ω is the diagonal matrix of singu-
lar values, and Φ and Ψ are both unitary in the unit
sphere of dimension R2. This in turn leads to the
definition:

Γ = ΦΨT , (11)

which can be shown (cf. (Bellegarda et al., 1994))
to represent the least squares rotation that must be
applied (in that unit sphere) to λ̄2,k to obtain an esti-
mate of Pλ̄1,kP T .

Now what is needed is to apply this transforma-
tion to the centroids z2,� (1 ≤ � ≤ L) of the affective
categories in the affective space, so as to map them
to the domain space. We first project each vector
into the unit sphere, resulting in:

z̄2,� = Σ
−1/2
2 (z2,� − μ2) , (12)

as prescribed in (7). We then synthesize from z̄2,�
a unit sphere vector corresponding to the estimate
in the projected domain space. From the foregoing,
this estimate is given by:

ˆ̄z1,� = Γ z̄2,� . (13)

Finally, we restore the resulting contribution at the
appropriate place in the domain space, by reversing
the transformation (6):

ẑ1,� = Σ
1/2
1

ˆ̄z1,� + μ1 . (14)

Combining the three steps (12)–(14) together, the
overall mapping can be written as:

ẑ1,� = (Σ
1/2
1 ΓΣ

−1/2
2 ) z2,� + (μ1−Σ

1/2
1 ΓΣ

−1/2
2 μ2) .

(15)
This expression stipulates how to leverage the ob-
served affective anchors z2,� in the affective space
to obtain an estimate of the unobserved affective an-
chors ẑ1,� in the domain space, for 1 ≤ � ≤ L. The
overall procedure is illustrated in Fig. 5 (in the sim-
ple case of two dimensions).

Once the affective anchors are suitably embedded
into the domain space, we proceed as before to com-
pare the representation of a given input text to each
of these anchors, which leads to the desired quan-
titative assessment for the overall emotional affinity
of the text.

5 Emotion Classification

To summarize, using either latent affective folding
or latent affective embedding, we end up with an es-
timate ẑ1,� of the affective anchor for each emotion
� in the domain space L1. What remains to be de-
scribed is how to perform emotion classification in
that space.

To proceed, we first need to specify how to repre-
sent in that space an input text not seen in the train-
ing corpus, say tp (where p > N1). For each entry in
T1, we compute for the new text the weighted counts
(1) with j = p. The resulting feature vector, a col-
umn vector of dimension N1, can be thought of as
an additional column of the matrix W1. Assuming
the matrices U1 and S1 do not change appreciably,
the SVD expansion (2) therefore implies:

tp = U1 S1 v T1,p , (16)

where the R1-dimensional vector v T1,p acts as an ad-
ditional column of the matrix V T1 . Thus, the repre-
sention of the new text in the domain space can be
obtained from z1,p = v1,pS1.

All is needed now is a suitable closeness measure
to compare this representation to each affective an-
chor ẑ1,� (1 ≤ � ≤ L). From (Bellegarda, 2008), a
natural metric to consider is the cosine of the angle
between them. This yields:

C(z1,p, ẑ1,�) =
z1,p ẑ

T
1,�

‖z1,p‖ ‖ẑ1,�‖
, (17)

for any 1 ≤ � ≤ L. Using (17), it is a simple matter
to directly compute the relevance of the input text to

each emotional category. It is important to note that
word weighting is now implicitly taken into account
by the LSM formalism.

6 Experimental Evaluation

In order to evaluate the latent affective framework
described above, we used the data set that was devel-
oped for the SemEval 2007 task on “Affective Text”
(Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007). This task was fo-
cused on the emotion classification of news head-
lines. Headlines typically consist of a few words
and are often written by creative people with the
intention to “provoke” emotions, and consequently
attract the readers’ attention. These characteris-
tics make this kind of data particularly suitable for
use in an automatic emotion recognition setting,
as the affective/emotional features (if present) are
guaranteed to appear in these short sentences. The
test data accordingly consisted of 1,250 short news
headlines2 extracted from news web sites (such as
Google news, CNN) and/or newspapers, and anno-
tated along L = 6 emotions (ANGER, DISGUST,
FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, and SURPRISE) by different
evaluators.

For baseline purposes, we considered the follow-
ing approaches: (i) a simple word accumulation sys-
tem, which annotates the emotions in a text based on
the presence of words from the WordNet-Affect lex-
icon; and (ii) three LSA-based systems implemented
as in Fig. 1, which only differ in the way each emo-
tion is represented in the LSA space: either based
on a specific word only (e.g., JOY), or the word
plus its WordNet synset, or the word plus all Word-
Net synsets labelled with that emotion in WordNet-
Affect (cf. (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007)). In all
three cases, the large corpus used for LSA process-
ing was the Wall Street Journal text collection (Graff
et al., 1995), comprising about 86,000 articles.

For the latent affective framework, we needed to
select two separate training corpora. For the “do-
main” corpus, we selected a collection of about
N1 = 8, 500 relatively short English sentences (with

completely congruent with news headlines, we felt
that the type and range of topics covered was close
enough to serve as a good proxy for the domain.
For the “affective” corpus, we relied on about N2 =
5, 000 mood-annotated blog entries from LiveJour-
nal.com, with a filtered3 vocabulary of about M2 =
20, 000 words. The indication of mood being ex-
plicitly specified when posting on LiveJournal, with-
out particular coercion from the interface, mood-
annotated posts are likely to reflect the true mood of
the blog authors (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).
The moods were then mapped to the L = 6 emotions
considered in the classification.

Next, we formed the domain and affective matri-
ces W1 and W2 and processed them as in (2) and (5).
We used R1 = 100 for the dimension of the domain
space L1 and R2 = L = 6 for the dimension of
the affective space L2. We then compared latent af-
fective folding and embedding to the above systems.
The results are summarized in Table I.

Consistent with the observations in (Strapparava
and Mihalcea, 2008), word accumulation secures the
highest precision at the cost of the lowest recall,
while LSA-based systems achieve high recall but
significantly lower precision. Encouragingly, the F-
measure obtained with both latent affective mapping
techniques is substantially higher than with all four
baseline approaches. Of the two techniques, latent
embedding performs better, presumably because the
embedded affective anchors are less sensitive than
the folded affective anchors to the distribution of
words within the affective corpus. Both techniques
seem to exhibit an improved ability to resolve dis-
tinctions between emotional connotations.

3Extensive text pre-processing is usually required on blog
entries, to address typos and assorted creative license.

7 Conclusion

We have proposed a data-driven strategy for emotion
analysis which focuses on two coupled phases: (i)
separately encapsulate both the foundations of the
domain considered and the overall affective fabric
of the language, and (ii) exploit the emergent rela-
tionship between these two semantic levels of de-
scription in order to inform the emotion classifica-
tion process. We address (i) by leveraging the la-
tent topicality of two distinct corpora, as uncovered
by a global LSM analysis of domain-oriented and
emotion-oriented training documents. The two de-
scriptions are then superimposed to produce the de-
sired connection between all terms and emotional
categories. Because this connection automatically
takes into account the influence of the entire train-
ing corpora, it is more encompassing than that based
on the relatively few affective terms typically con-
sidered in conventional processing.

Empirical evidence gathered on the “Affective
Text” portion of the SemEval-2007 corpus (Strap-
parava and Mihalcea, 2007) shows the effective-
ness of the proposed strategy. Classification per-
formance with latent affective embedding is slightly
better than with latent affective folding, presumably
because of its ability to more richly describe the
affective space. Both techniques outperform stan-
dard LSA-based approaches, as well as affectively
weighted word accumulation. This bodes well for
the general deployability of latent affective process-
ing across a wide range of applications.

Future efforts will concentrate on characterizing
the influence of the parameters R1 and R2 on the
vector spaces L1 and L2, and the corresponding
trade-off between modeling power and generaliza-
tion properties. It is also of interest to investigate

how incorporating higher level units (such as com-
mon lexical compounds) into the LSM procedure
might further increase performance.
