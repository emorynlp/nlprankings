Abstract

Social networking sites have flooded the Internet with posts containing shared opinions, moods,
and feelings. This has given rise to a new wave of research to develop algorithms for emotion
detection and extraction on social data. As the desire to understand how people feel about certain
events/objects across countries or regions grows, the need to analyze social data in different lan-
guages grows with it. However, the explosive nature of data generated around the world brings
a challenge for sentiment-based information retrieval and analysis. In this paper, we propose a
multilingual system with a computationally inexpensive approach to sentiment analysis of so-
cial data. The experiments demonstrate that our approach performs an effective multi-lingual
sentiment analysis of microblog data with little more than a 100 emotion-bearing patterns.

1 Introduction

Web 2.0 and the rise of social networking platforms such as microblogs have brought new ways to
share opinions in a global setting. Microblogging sites represent a new way to share information about
everything, such as new products, places of interest or popular culture in some ways replacing traditional
word-of-mouth communication. Those sites have become rich repositories of opinions from audiences
diverse in culture, race, location, and language. They represent, for people and businesses, a potential
opportunity to understand what the global community thinks about them, helping them to make better
informed decisions when improving their image and products. They may also offer the general public a
way to find useful information and opinions before purchasing a product or service.

Vast swathes of the global population have access to nearly the same products and services. For
that reason, being aware of opinions from around the world, regardless of the languages, is no longer
ambitious but necessary. Systems which are able to aggregate opinionated data in multiple languages
could highlight a global trend around a target query. This is desirable as targets may have different
impacts depending on the area. The possibilities are huge but the challenges are many. As in every major
endeavor, it is necessary to start with the basics, such as language detection and sentiment analysis.

With the explosive nature of subjective data in the Web, several patterns analysis techniques such as
the ones bye Yi et al. (2003) and Davidov et al. (2010) have been proposed to extract opinionated and
emotion-bearing data. Most works have focused on English language, except the technique proposed
in (Sascha Narr and Albayrak, 2012) which utilizes n-grams as language independent features to classify
tweets by their polarity in 4 different languages. However, since this technique relies solely on frequency
statistics, it would need large training datasets.

In this paper, we propose a language independent approach to emotion-bearing patterns retrieval in
microblog data. Each extracted pattern and its related words can also be considered as n-grams, however,
selected in a way that makes them more semantically related to the domain of sentiment and emotion
analysis. The proposed multi-lingual framework consists of two stages: Filter and Refine approach. In
the Filter stage, the language and a hint of the polarity of a microblog post are detected based on the

n-gram classification approach. Our approach is different from the one proposed in (Sascha Narr and
Albayrak, 2012) in that the n-grams are used at the character-level instead of the word-level.

In the Refine stage, language-independent emotion-bearing words and patterns (using an adaptation
of extraction methods by Davidov and Rappoport (2006)) are employed. Our approach differs from the
method of Davidov et al. (2010) in that we use words belonging to empirically defined psychological and
structural categories (emotion, cognition, etc.)1. These words are used as seeds to restrict the features
extracted to emotion bearing patterns and words.

Our experimental results show that our approach can extract relevant patterns. With only about 100
patterns employed of about 31,500 n-gram candidates, the approach presented in this paper outperforms
a state-of-the-art classifier for the French language. These results validate the potential of the proposed
technique.

2 Related Work

Patterns have been extensively used for many Information Retrieval tasks. Pantel and Pennacchiotti
(2006) extract semantic relations using generic patterns (with broad coverage but low precision). The
key assumption is that in very large corpora like the Web, correct instances generated by a generic pat-
tern will be instantiated by some reliable patterns, where reliable patterns are patterns that have high
precision but often very low recall. Wang et al. (2007) propose a topical n-gram (TNG) model that au-
tomatically determines unigram words and phrases based on context, and assigns a mixture of topics to
both individual words and n-gram phrases. They present an Information Retrieval (IR) application with
better performance on an ad-hoc retrieval task over a TREC collection. Davidov and Rappoport (2006)
have proposed an approach to unsupervised discovery of word categories based on symmetric patterns.
A symmetric pattern is one in which co-occurring words can potentially belong to the same semantic
category.

With the speed at which subjective data is generated on the Web, and its potential usage, patterns
have also been applied to extract opinionated data. Yi et al. (2003) use a Sentiment Pattern Database
to match sentiment phrases related to a subject from online texts. The system was verified using online
product review articles. Dave et al. (2003) tried statistical and linguistic substitutions to transform specific
patterns into more general ones. They also used an algorithm based on suffix trees to determine substrings
that provide optimal classification. The extracted features were applied to opinion extraction of product
reviews. In their work, Davidov et al. (2010) use their pattern definition (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)
to identify diverse sentiment types in short microblog texts.

Most of the work with patterns for sentiment extraction has focused on English language. Although,
a few studies have identified patterns as a tool for bridging the gap between languages. Cui et al. (2011)
automatically extracted different types of word level patterns (denoted emotion tokens), and labeled
their sentiment polarities with an unsupervised propagation algorithm. Sascha Narr and Albayrak (2012)
utilized n-grams as language independent features to classify tweets by their polarity in 4 different lan-
guages.

The main drawback of features such as n-grams is that, to capture the semantics of a specific domain,
they rely solely on frequency statistics. This impacts less when large training data is available, but can
be a considerable disadvantage when the data is scarce. Another drawback of such features is the large
number of n-grams that need to be included in the features set. Larger feature spaces have a big impact
on the efficiency of systems.

3 Methodology

The objective of this work is to propose an effective multi-lingual emotion-bearing patterns extraction
approach. To test the relevance of the extracted features, a multi-lingual sentiment analysis system for
microblog data is defined. The proposed framework illustrated in Figure 1 consists of two stages: the
Filter stage and the Refine stage. Given a set of microblog posts containing a query term, the Filter stage
utilizing n-gram patterns first detects the language of all the microblog posts. Then it obtains the polarity

(negative, positive) by utilizing a classifier trained with n-gram features at the character level. The Refine
stage utilizing symmetric patterns performs a finer analysis of the posts to classify the ones that the Filter
stage left out. It utilizes extracted emotion-bearing patterns as described in Section 3.1 and related words
as features.

3.1 Candidate Emotion-Bearing Surface Patterns Construction

The intuition of the construction method is based on psychological studies (James W. Pennebaker and
Booth, 2007) proposing that emotional cues can be found in a person’s utterances and texts, providing
windows into their emotional and cognitive worlds. Based on this idea, the following method that can
capture the textual emotion cues in the form of patterns and words is introduced.

The proposed extraction technique in this paper adapted the unsupervised word categories discovery
technique introduced by Davidov and Rappoport (2006). To guarantee that the retrieved features are
relevant to the sentiment analysis task here presented, the proposed emotion-bearing pattern extraction
technique requires the following adaptations.

Other than the HW and CW word types introduced by Davidov and Rappoport (2006), the psycho-
logical word type (PW) is introduced as seeds for extracting more emotion-related patterns. Words in
PW are content-bearing, and pertain to psychological categories related to emotion, cognition, affection,
social, perception, etc. The PW set should include words like, “peace”, “abandon”, and “dream”. By the
symmetric nature of the patterns, the PW words can be naturally expanded from the extraction dataset .
In order to drive the extraction towards more emotion-related patterns, it is also enforced that at least one
of the CW words of a pattern contains a word from the PW set. For example, “peace is a dream” is an
instance of a pattern “CW HW HW CW”.

The result of the extraction is a large list of word subsequences related to different emotion-bearing
patterns. There are two main reasons not to employ all extracted subsequences from a large corpus
as features. First, the current list is usually huge (around 150,000 unique subsequences found in the
experiments with English data), making the training process inefficient. Second, it is necessary to account
for the fact that the dataset used for features extraction may be completely different from the training, and
testing sets. Additionally, the PW set can also vary greatly in size and psychological categories included.
This can potentially impact the coverage/accuracy due to unseen words.

3.2 Graph-Based Relevant Patterns Selection

The following reduction method based on the graph representation for patterns described in (Davidov
and Rappoport, 2006) is introduced to reduce the features space, and to account for unseen words. First,
infrequent subsequences are ignored. Then, the subsequences are grouped by pattern based on their HW
words. Subsequences having the same HW word in the same positions are grouped together and their
CW words are replaced by “*”.2 Finally, as proposed by Davidov and Rappoport (2006), the directed

2“*” is a wild card that matches any word

40



graph G(p) = (V(G),E(G)) for each pattern p is constructed. For example, subsequences “love my niece”
and “hate my boss” from the meta-pattern “CW HW CW” are both grouped together as part of the pattern
“* my *”.

Two different scores are proposed to measure the degree of emotion expressed by each pattern. The
intuition of the following definitions is, the higher the proportion of PW words appearing in subsequences
belonging to a given pattern, the higher the degree of emotion of this pattern.

Definition 1 (SC1)
The number of out-links of the vertex with max. number of out-links in the graph for pattern p.

SC1 = max(|{(x, y)|x ∈ V (G(p)}|) (1)

Definition 2 (SC2)
The number of in-links of the vertex with max. number of in-links in the graph for pattern p.

SC2 = max(|{(x, y)|y ∈ V (G(p)}|) (2)

Patterns with high SC1 and SC2 scores ensure a good coverage as they capture more PW words from
the corpus. For each score, a ranked list of patterns is obtained. Patterns in top THtop in at least one
list and not in bottom THbottom in any list are retained. The final list of features is composed of all
the retained patterns, and all the CWs it captured from the corpus through its related subsequences.
This approach significantly reduces the features space by using only the relevant patterns, and not the
subsequences (n-grams) as features. It also helps the coverage, as unseen words can still be captured by
a pattern through the “* ” wild card.

3.3 Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis on Microblog Data
The following Filter and Refine approach is employed to determine the polarity of posts from microblog
data. Given a post, the Filter stage firsts detects its language. It does so by training language models
using n-grams at the character-level. Next, the corresponding polarity models are used to determine the
polarity of the post. The polarity models are also constructed with the same method.

A confidence value is obtained as follows.

Conf(p) =
∣∣∣∑(Freqpositive(ng)− Freqnegative(ng))∣∣∣ (3)

where ng is an n-gram entry and Freq gets its frequency count in a polarity model.
We define experimentally two thresholds THpol for pol ∈ {positive, negative}. For a given detected

class pol we say the post has that polarity only if Conf (p) > THpol else we send the post to the Refine
stage.

The posts not classified by the Filter stage are processed by the Refine stage, which is based on a
Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes classifier. The classifier uses the emotion-patterns and words extracted using
the methods described in 3.1 and 3.2 as binary features. Each pattern is used as a regular expression to
look for matching subsequences in a post. If a match exists, the corresponding value in the vector is set
to 1 and to 0 otherwise. The same process applies for word features.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Setup
Two experiments were performed to validate the approach introduced in this paper. Datasets in three
target languages (English, Spanish, and French) were utilized to test the approach. To avoid favoring
the proposed method by having similar data characteristics in both training and testing stages, different
datasets are employed in the experiments.

The larger set, SetHT , was collected using emotion-bearing hashtags as noisy labels. This set is used
during the training process. The second set, SetEmo, was collected using positive and negative emoticons
as queries to the Twitter Search API. From the collected tweets, 500 positive and 500 negative were

41



manually annotated for each language by 2 volunteers. The third set SetRW , released by Sascha Narr
and Albayrak (2012), contains 739 positive and 488 negative manually annotated English tweets, and
159 positive and 160 negative French tweets.

To obtain more emotion-related patterns during the extraction phase, the psychological words (PW)
were obtained from psychological categories in a text analysis application called Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) (James W. Pennebaker and Booth, 2007).

Best performance for Filter and Refine

Figure 2: Filter + Refine performance with SetEmo testing set

The first experiment evaluated the proposed approach using the SetEmo testing set. The results in
Figure 2 show that overall accuracies of over 80% can be obtained for all languages. Keep in mind that
neither Filter nor Refine stages process all the posts, hence the reported individual accuracies are only
over the portion of posts analyzed by each, with only the Filter+Refine result being over the totality of
the posts. Due to time limitations, the approach used to combine the results from Filter and Refine is
basic and treats both classifications as independent processes. A more elaborated approach may improve
the results further.

Finally, an experiment similar to the previous one was performed using SetRW as the testing set.
Table 1 shows that using a significantly lower number of features (the number of unigrams used by Narr
is not available but must be large) and a smaller training set, the performance of the introduced approach
surpasses the one reported by Narr for French and is just slightly lower for English. This is possible
thanks to the effective reduction approach used to obtain relevant patterns from extracted subsequences,
which is one of the main contributions of this paper (See Table 2). The training sizes used by Filter
+ Refine were limited due to data availability. More data would have probably helped Filter + Refine
surpass the results reported by Narr for English.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Two main types of language-independent features were studied in this paper: character-level n-grams,
and emotion-bearing patterns. Character-level n-grams represent a useful tool for a preliminary sentiment
classifier such as Filter. Emotion-bearing patterns can capture the emotional cues embedded in a person’s
writing. Such features can help identify subjectivity and determine the polarity of microblog posts across
significantly different datasets in ways that regular patterns based purely on frequency wouldn’t. It is
believed that such emotion-bearing patterns can be used to perform a more complex analysis such as
ambiguity and sarcasm identification, and to model other social and psychological characteristics of
human behavior.

This paper contributes the introduction of emotion-bearing patterns as language independent features
for multi-lingual sentiment analysis, and the efficient reduction approach used during their extraction.
Sentiment analysis methods could benefit from such an approach during the training phases. Moreover,
since the features obtained are very relevant to the classification task, less training examples are required,
reducing the number of features significantly. Finally, the approach here presented is highly configurable,
with both Filter and Refine relying on different thresholds. Several experiments with different sets of
values can be performed to find the optimal set for a given language and show the full potential of the
approach.

As a future work, it is planned to study the applicability of the presented approach to Asian languages
such as Chinese and Vietnamese. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the patterns will be performed to
extend the classification from the classic binary approach to a multi-class approach (using 8 different
emotions). More difficult tasks such as detecting ambiguity and sarcasm will also be addressed.
