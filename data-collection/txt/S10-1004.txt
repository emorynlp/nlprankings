Abstract

This paper describes Task 5 of the
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2010
(SemEval-2010). Systems are to automat-
ically assign keyphrases or keywords to
given scientific articles. The participating
systems were evaluated by matching their
extracted keyphrases against manually as-
signed ones. We present the overall rank-
ing of the submitted systems and discuss
our findings to suggest future directions
for this task.

1 Task Description

Keyphrases1 are words that capture the main top-
ics of a document. As they represent these key
ideas, extracting high-quality keyphrases can ben-
efit various natural language processing (NLP) ap-
plications such as summarization, information re-
trieval and question-answering. In summariza-
tion, keyphrases can be used as a form of se-
mantic metadata (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997;
Lawrie et al., 2001; D’Avanzo and Magnini,
2005). In search engines, keyphrases can supple-
ment full-text indexing and assist users in formu-
lating queries.

Recently, a resurgence of interest in keyphrase
extraction has led to the development of several
new systems and techniques for the task (Frank
et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Turney, 1999;
Hulth, 2003; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004;
Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Hulth, 2004; Mat-
suo and Ishizuka, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and
Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008; Liu et al., 2009;
Medelyan, 2009; Nguyen and Phan, 2009). These

have showcased the potential benefits of keyphrase
extraction to downstream NLP applications.

In light of these developments, we felt that this
was an appropriate time to conduct a shared task
for keyphrase extraction, to provide a standard as-
sessment to benchmark current approaches. A sec-
ond goal of the task was to contribute an additional
public dataset to spur future research in the area.

Currently, there are several publicly available
data sets.2 For example, Hulth (2003) contributed
2,000 abstracts of journal articles present in In-
spec between the years 1998 and 2002. The data
set contains keyphrases (i.e. controlled and un-
controlled terms) assigned by professional index-
ers — 1,000 for training, 500 for validation and
500 for testing. Nguyen and Kan (2007) col-
lected a dataset containing 120 computer science
articles, ranging in length from 4 to 12 pages.
The articles contain author-assigned keyphrases
as well as reader-assigned keyphrases contributed
by undergraduate CS students. In the general
newswire domain, Wan and Xiao (2008) devel-
oped a dataset of 308 documents taken from DUC
2001 which contain up to 10 manually-assigned
keyphrases per document. Several databases, in-
cluding the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore,
Inspec and PubMed provide articles with author-
assigned keyphrases and, occasionally, reader-
assigned ones. Medelyan (2009) automatically
generated a dataset using tags assigned by the
users of the collaborative citation platform CiteU-
Like. This dataset additionally records how many
people have assigned the same keyword to the
same publication. In total, 180 full-text publi-
cations were annotated by over 300 users.3 De-
spite the availability of these datasets, a standard-
ized benchmark dataset with a well-defined train-

ing and test split is needed to maximize compara-
bility of results.

For the SemEval-2010 Task 5, we have
compiled a set of 284 scientific articles with
keyphrases carefully chosen by both their authors
and readers. The participants’ task was to develop
systems which automatically produce keyphrases
for each paper. Each team was allowed to sub-
mit up to three system runs, to benchmark the
contributions of different parameter settings and
approaches. Each run consisted of extracting a
ranked list of 15 keyphrases from each docu-
ment, ranked by their probability of being reader-
assigned keyphrases.

In the remainder of the paper, we describe
the competition setup, including how data collec-
tion was managed and the evaluation methodol-
ogy (Section 2). We present the results of the
shared task, and discuss the immediate findings of
the competition in Section 3. In Section 4 we as-
sess the human performance by comparing reader-
assigned keyphrases to those assigned by the au-
thors. This gives an approximation of an upper-
bound performance for this task.

2 Competition Setup

2.1 Data

We collected trial, training and test data from
the ACM Digital Library (conference and work-
shop papers). The input papers ranged from 6
to 8 pages, including tables and pictures. To en-
sure a variety of different topics was represented
in the corpus, we purposefully selected papers
from four different research areas for the dataset.
In particular, the selected articles belong to the
following four 1998 ACM classifications: C2.4
(Distributed Systems), H3.3 (Information Search
and Retrieval), I2.11 (Distributed Artificial In-
telligence – Multiagent Systems) and J4 (Social
and Behavioral Sciences – Economics). All three
datasets (trial, training and test) had an equal dis-
tribution of documents from among the categories
(see Table 1). This domain specific information
was provided with the papers (e.g. I2.4-1 or H3.3-
2), in case participant systems wanted to utilize
this information. We specifically decided to strad-
dle different areas to see whether participant ap-
proaches would work better within specific areas.

Participants were provided with 40, 144, and
100 articles, respectively, in the trial, training and
test data, distributed evenly across the four re-

search areas in each case. Note that the trial data is
a subset of the training data. Since the original for-
mat for the articles was PDF, we converted them
into (UTF-8) plain text using pdftotext, and sys-
tematically restored full words that were originally
hyphenated and broken across two lines. This pol-
icy potentially resulted in valid hyphenated forms
having their hyphen (-) removed.

All collected papers contain author-assigned
keyphrases, part of the original PDF file. We addi-
tionally collected reader-assigned keyphrases for
each paper. We first performed a pilot annotation
task with a group of students to check the stabil-
ity of the annotations, finalize the guidelines, and
discover and resolve potential issues that may oc-
cur during the actual annotation. To collect the ac-
tual reader-assigned keyphrases, we then hired 50
student annotators from the Computer Science de-
partment of the National University of Singapore.

We assigned 5 papers to each annotator, esti-
mating that assigning keyphrases to each paper
should take about 10-15 minutes. Annotators were
explicitly told to extract keyphrases that actually
appear in the text of each paper, rather than to cre-
ate semantically-equivalent phrases, but could ex-
tract phrases from any part of the document (in-
cluding headers and captions). In reality, on av-
erage 15% of the reader-assigned keyphrases did
not appear in the text of the paper, but this is still
less than the 19% of author-assigned keyphrases
that did not appear in the papers. These values
were computed using the test documents only. In
other words, the maximum recall that the partici-
pating systems can achieve on these documents is
85% and 81% for the reader- and author-assigned
keyphrases, respectively.

As some keyphrases may occur in multiple
forms, in our evaluation we accepted two differ-
ent versions of genitive keyphrases: A of B → B
A (e.g. policy of school = school policy) and A’s
B → A B (e.g. school’s policy = school pol-
icy). In certain cases, such alternations change the
semantics of the candidate phrase (e.g., matter of
fact vs. ?fact matter). We judged borderline cases
by committee and do not include alternations that
were judged to be semantically distinct.

Table 1 shows the distribution of the trial, train-
ing and test documents over the four different re-
search areas, while Table 2 shows the distribution
of author- and reader-assigned keyphrases.

Interestingly, among the 387 author-assigned

keywords, 125 keywords match exactly with
reader-assigned keywords, while many more near-
misses (i.e. partial matches) occur.

2.2 Evaluation Method and Baseline

Traditionally, automatic keyphrase extraction sys-
tems have been assessed using the proportion of
top-N candidates that exactly match the gold-
standard keyphrases (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et
al., 1999; Turney, 1999). In some cases, inexact
matches, or near-misses, have also been consid-
ered. Some have suggested treating semantically-
similar keyphrases as correct based on simi-
larities computed over a large corpus (Jarmasz
and Barriere, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),
or using semantic relations defined in a the-
saurus (Medelyan and Witten, 2006). Zesch and
Gurevych (2009) compute near-misses using an n-
gram based approach relative to the gold standard.
For our shared task, we follow the traditional ex-
act match evaluation metric. That is, we match the
keyphrases in the answer set with those the sys-
tems provide, and calculate micro-averaged preci-
sion, recall and F-score (β = 1). In the evaluation,
we check the performance over the top 5, 10 and
15 candidates returned by each system. We rank
the participating systems by F-score over the top
15 candidates.

Participants were required to extract ex-
isting phrases from the documents. Since
it is theoretically possible to retrieve author-
assigned keyphrases from the original PDF arti-
cles, we evaluate the participating systems over
the independently-generated and held-out reader-

assigned keyphrases, as well as the combined set
of keyphrases (author- and reader-assigned).

All keyphrases in the answer set are stemmed
using the English Porter stemmer for both the
training and test dataset.4

We computed a TF×IDF n-gram based baseline
using both supervised and unsupervised learning
systems. We use 1, 2, 3-grams as keyphrase can-
didates, used Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) and Maximum
Entropy (ME) classifiers to learn two supervised
baseline systems based on the keyphrase candi-
dates and gold-standard annotations for the train-
ing documents. In total, there are three baselines:
two supervised and one unsupervised. The per-
formance of the baselines is presented in Table 3,
where R indicates reader-assigned keyphrases and
C indicates combined (both author- and reader-
assigned) keyphrases.

3 Competition Results

The trial data was downloaded by 73 different
teams, of which 36 teams subsequently down-
loaded the training and test data. 21 teams partici-
pated in the final competition, of which two teams
withdrew their systems.

Table 4 shows the performance of the final 19
submitted systems. 5 teams submitted one run,
6 teams submitted two runs and 8 teams sub-
mitted the maximum number of three runs. We
rank the best-performing system from each team
by micro-averaged F-score over the top 15 can-
didates. We also show system performance over
reader-assigned keywords in Table 5, and over
author-assigned keywords in Table 6. In all these
tables, P, R and F denote precision, recall and F-
score, respectively.

The best results over the reader-assigned and
combined keyphrase sets are 23.5% and 27.5%,
respectively, achieved by the HUMB team. Most
systems outperformed the baselines. Systems also
generally did better over the combined set, as the
presence of a larger gold-standard answer set im-
proved recall.

In Tables 7 and 8, we ranked the teams by F-
score, computed over the top 15 candidates for
each of the four ACM document classifications.

using for the task, to avoid possible stemming variations be-
tween implementations.

F-score, we ordered teams by descending F-score
over all the data.

4 Discussion of the Upper-Bound
Performance

The current evaluation is a testament to the gains
made by keyphrase extraction systems. The sys-
tem performance over the different keyword cat-
egories (reader-assigned and author-assigned) and
numbers of keyword candidates (top 5, 10 and 15
candidates) attest to this fact.

The top-performing systems return F-scores in
the upper twenties. Superficially, this number is
low, and it is instructive to examine how much
room there is for improvement. Keyphrase extrac-
tion is a subjective task, and an F-score of 100% is
infeasible. On the author-assigned keyphrases in
our test collection, the highest a system could the-
oretically achieve was 81% recall5 and 100% pre-
cision, which gives a maximum F-score of 89%.
However, such a high value would only be possi-
ble if the number of keyphrases extracted per doc-
ument could vary; in our task, we fixed the thresh-
olds at 5, 10 and 15 keyphrases.

5The remaining 19% of keyphrases do not actually appear
in the documents and thus cannot be extracted.

Another way of computing the upper-bound
performance would be to look into how well peo-
ple perform the same task. We analyzed the
performance of our readers, taking the author-
assigned keyphrases as the gold standard. The au-
thors assigned an average of 4 keyphrases to each
paper, whereas the readers assigned 12 on average.
These 12 keyphrases cover 77.8% of the authors’
keyphrases, which corresponds to a precision of
21.5%. The F-score achieved by the readers on the
author-assigned keyphrases is 33.6%, whereas the
F-score of the best-performing system on the same
data is 19.3% (for top 15, not top 12 keyphrases,
see Table 6).

We conclude that there is definitely still room
for improvement, and for any future shared tasks,
we recommend against fixing any threshold on the
number of keyphrases to be extracted per docu-
ment. Finally, as we use a strict exact matching
metric for evaluation, the presented evaluation fig-
ures are a lower bound for performance, as se-
mantically equivalent keyphrases are not counted
as correct. For future runs of this challenge, we
believe a more semantically-motivated evaluation
should be employed to give a more accurate im-
pression of keyphrase acceptability.

5 Conclusion

This paper has described Task 5 of the Workshop
on Semantic Evaluation 2010 (SemEval-2010), fo-
cusing on keyphrase extraction. We outlined the
design of the datasets used in the shared task and
the evaluation metrics, before presenting the offi-
cial results for the task and summarising the im-
mediate findings. We also analyzed the upper-
bound performance for this task, and demon-
strated that there is still room for improvement
over the task. We look forward to future advances
in automatic keyphrase extraction based on this
and other datasets.
