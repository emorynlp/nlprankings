Abstract

We aim to better exploit the limited amounts
of parallel text available in low-resource set-
tings by introducing a differentiable recon-
struction loss for neural machine translation
(NMT). This loss compares original inputs
to reconstructed inputs, obtained by back-
translating translation hypotheses into the in-
put language. We leverage differentiable sam-
pling and bi-directional NMT to train models
end-to-end, without introducing additional pa-
rameters. This approach achieves small but
consistent BLEU improvements on four lan-
guage pairs in both translation directions, and
outperforms an alternative differentiable re-
construction strategy based on hidden states.

1 Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performance
degrades sharply when parallel training data is
limited (Koehn and Knowles, 2017). Past work
has addressed this problem by leveraging mono-
lingual data (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Ramachan-
dran et al., 2017) or multilingual parallel data
(Zoph et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2017; Gu et al.,
2018a). We hypothesize that the traditional train-
ing can be complemented by better leveraging lim-
ited training data. To this end, we propose a new
training objective for this model by augmenting
the standard translation cross-entropy loss with a
differentiable input reconstruction loss to fur-
ther exploit the source side of parallel samples.

Input reconstruction is motivated by the idea
of round-trip translation. Suppose sentence f is
translated forward to e using model θfe and then
translated back to f̂ using model θef , then e is
more likely to be a good translation if the distance
between f̂ and f is small (Brislin, 1970). Prior
work applied round-trip translation to monolin-
gual examples and sampled the intermediate trans-
lation e from a K-best list generated by model

θfe using beam search (Cheng et al., 2016; He
et al., 2016). However, beam search is not differ-
entiable which prevents back-propagating recon-
struction errors to θfe. As a result, reinforcement
learning algorithms, or independent updates to θfe
and θef were required.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of mak-
ing input reconstruction differentiable to simplify
training. In past work, Tu et al. (2017) addressed
this issue by reconstructing source sentences from
the decoder’s hidden states. However, this re-
construction task can be artificially easy if hid-
den states over-memorize the input. This approach
also requires a separate auxiliary reconstructor,
which introduces additional parameters.

We propose instead to combine benefits from
differentiable sampling and bi-directional NMT to
obtain a compact model that can be trained end-
to-end with back-propagation. Specifically,

• Translations are sampled using the Straight-
Through Gumbel Softmax (STGS) estima-
tor (Jang et al., 2017; Bengio et al., 2013),
which allows back-propagating reconstruc-
tion errors.

• Our approach builds on the bi-directional
NMT model (Niu et al., 2018; Johnson et al.,
2017), which improves low-resource transla-
tion by jointly modeling translation in both
directions (e.g., Swahili ↔ English). A sin-
gle bi-directional model is used as a translator
and a reconstructor (i.e. θef = θfe) without
introducing more parameters.

Experiments show that our approach outper-
forms reconstruction from hidden states. It
achieves consistent improvements across various
low-resource language pairs and directions, show-
ing its effectiveness in making better use of limited
parallel data.

2 Background

Using round-trip translations (f→ e→ f̂ ) as a
training signal for NMT usually requires auxil-
iary models to perform back-translation and can-
not be trained end-to-end without reinforcement
learning. For instance, Cheng et al. (2016) added
a reconstruction loss for monolingual examples to
the training objective. He et al. (2016) evaluated
the quality of e by a language model and f̂ by
a reconstruction likelihood. Both approaches have
symmetric forward and backward translation mod-
els which are updated alternatively. This require
policy gradient algorithms for training, which are
not always stable.

Back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016a) per-
forms half of the reconstruction process, by gener-
ating a synthetic source side for monolingual tar-
get language examples: e → f̂ . It uses an auxil-
iary backward model to generate the synthetic data
but only updates the parameters of the primary
forward model. Iteratively updating forward and
backward models (Zhang et al., 2018; Niu et al.,
2018) is an expensive solution as back-translations
are regenerated at each iteration.

Prior work has sought to simplify the opti-
mization of reconstruction losses by side-stepping
beam search. Tu et al. (2017) first proposed to re-
construct NMT input from the decoder’s hidden
states while Wang et al. (2018a,b) suggested to use
both encoder and decoder hidden states to improve
translation of dropped pronouns. However, these
models might achieve low reconstruction errors by
learning to copy the input to hidden states. To
avoid copying the input, Artetxe et al. (2018) and
Lample et al. (2018) used denoising autoencoders
(Vincent et al., 2008) in unsupervised NMT.

Our approach is based instead on the Gum-
bel Softmax (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al.,
2017), which facilitates differentiable sampling of
sequences of discrete tokens. It has been success-
fully applied in many sequence generation tasks,
including artificial language emergence for multi-
agent communication (Havrylov and Titov, 2017),
composing tree structures from text (Choi et al.,
2018), and tasks under the umbrella of genera-
tive adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014)
such as generating the context-free grammar (Kus-
ner and Hernández-Lobato, 2016), machine com-
prehension (Wang et al., 2017) and machine trans-
lation (Gu et al., 2018b).

3 Approach

NMT is framed as a conditional language model,
where the probability of predicting target token et
at step t is conditioned on the previously generated
sequence of tokens e<t and the source sequence f
given the model parameter θ. Suppose each token
is indexed and represented as a one-hot vector, its
probability is realized as a softmax function over
a linear transformation a(ht) where ht is the de-
coder’s hidden state at step t:

P (et|e<t,f ;θ) = softmax(a(ht))>et. (1)

The hidden state is calculated by a neural network
g given the embeddings of the previous target to-
kens e<t in the embedding matrixE(e<t) and the
context ct coming from the source:

ht = g(E(e<t), ct). (2)

In our bi-directional model, the source sentence
can be either f or e and is respectively translated
to e or f . The language is marked by a tag (e.g.,
<en>) at the beginning of each source sentence
(Johnson et al., 2017; Niu et al., 2018). To facil-
itate symmetric reconstruction, we also add lan-
guage tags to target sentences. The training data
corpus is then built by swapping the source and
target sentences of a parallel corpus and append-
ing the swapped version to the original.

3.1 Bi-Directional Reconstruction
Our bi-directional model performs both forward
translation and backward reconstruction. By con-
trast, uni-directional models require an auxiliary
reconstruction module, which introduces addi-
tional parameters. This module can be either
a decoder-based reconstructor (Tu et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2018a,b) or a reversed dual NMT
model (Cheng et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2018c; Zhang et al., 2018).

Here the reconstructor, which shares the same
parameter with the translator T (·), can also
be trained end-to-end by maximizing the log-
likelihood of reconstructing f :

LR =
∑
f

logP (f |T (f ;θ);θ), (3)

Combining with the forward translation likelihood

LT =
∑
(f‖e)

logP (e |f ;θ), (4)



444

we useL = LT +LR as the final training objective
for f → e. The dual e → f model is trained si-
multaneously by swapping the language direction
in bi-directional NMT.

Reconstruction is reliable only with a model
that produces reasonable base translations. Fol-
lowing prior work (Tu et al., 2017; He et al., 2016;
Cheng et al., 2016), we pre-train a base model with
LT and fine-tune it with LT + LR.

3.2 Differentiable Sampling
We use differentiable sampling to side-step beam
search and back-propagate error signals. We use
the Gumbel-Max reparameterization trick (Mad-
dison et al., 2014) to sample a translation token
at each time step from the softmax distribution in
Equation 1:

et = one-hot
(

arg max
k

(
a(ht)k +Gk

))
(5)

whereGk is i.i.d. and drawn from Gumbel(0, 1)1.
We use scaled Gumbel with parameter β, i.e.
Gumbel(0, β), to control the randomness. The
sampling becomes deterministic (which is equiv-
alent to greedy search) as β approaches 0.

Since arg max is not a differentiable operation,
we approximate its gradient with the Straight-
Through Gumbel Softmax (STGS) (Jang et al.,
2017; Bengio et al., 2013): ∇θet ≈ ∇θ ẽt, where

ẽt = softmax
(
(a(ht) +G)/τ

)
(6)

As τ approaches 0, softmax is closer to arg max
but training might be more unstable. While the
STGS estimator is biased when τ is large, it per-
forms well in practice (Gu et al., 2018b; Choi
et al., 2018) and is sometimes faster and more ef-
fective than reinforcement learning (Havrylov and
Titov, 2017).

To generate coherent intermediate translations,
the decoder used for sampling only consumes its
previously predicted ê<t. This contrasts with
the usual teacher forcing strategy (Williams and
Zipser, 1989), which always feeds in the ground-
truth previous tokens e<t when predicting the
current token êt. With teacher forcing, the se-
quence concatenation [e<t; êt] is probably coher-
ent at each time step, but the actual predicted se-
quence [ê<t; êt] would break the continuity.2

1i.e. Gk = − log(− log(uk)) and uk ∼ Uniform(0, 1).
2Sampling with teacher forcing yielded consistently

worse BLEU than baselines in preliminary experiments.

4.1 Tasks and Data

We evaluate our approach on four low-resource
language pairs. Parallel data for Swahili↔English
(SW↔EN), Tagalog↔English (TL↔EN) and
Somali↔English (SO↔EN) contains a mix-
ture of domains such as news and weblogs
and is collected from the IARPA MATERIAL
program3, the Global Voices parallel corpus4,
Common Crawl (Smith et al., 2013), and the
LORELEI Somali representative language pack
(LDC2018T11). The test samples are extracted
from the held-out ANALYSIS set of MATERIAL.
Parallel Turkish↔English (TR↔EN) data is pro-
vided by the WMT news translation task (Bojar
et al., 2018). We use pre-processed “corpus”,
“newsdev2016”, “newstest2017” as training,
development and test sets.5

We apply normalization, tokenization, true-
casing, joint source-target BPE with 32,000 op-
erations (Sennrich et al., 2016b) and sentence-
filtering (length 80 cutoff) to parallel data. Item-
ized data statistics after preprocessing can be
found in Table 1. We report case-insensitive
BLEU with the WMT standard ‘13a’ tokenization
using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018).

4.2 Model Configuration and Baseline

We build NMT models upon the attentional RNN
encoder-decoder architecture (Bahdanau et al.,
2015) implemented in the Sockeye toolkit (Hieber
et al., 2017). Our translation model uses a bi-
directional encoder with a single LSTM layer of
size 512, multilayer perceptron attention with a
layer size of 512, and word representations of size
512. We apply layer normalization (Ba et al.,

2016) and add dropout to embeddings and RNNs
(Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) with probability 0.2.
We train using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and
Ba, 2015) with a batch size of 48 sentences and
we checkpoint the model every 1000 updates. The
learning rate for baseline models is initialized to
0.001 and reduced by 30% after 4 checkpoints
without improvement of perplexity on the devel-
opment set. Training stops after 10 checkpoints
without improvement.

The bi-directional NMT model ties source and
target embeddings to yield a bilingual vector
space. It also ties the output layer’s weights and
embeddings to achieve better performance in low-
resource scenarios (Press and Wolf, 2017; Nguyen
and Chiang, 2018).

We train five randomly seeded bi-directional
baseline models by optimizing the forward trans-
lation objective LT and report the mean and stan-
dard deviation of test BLEU. We fine-tune base-
line models with objective LT + LR, inherit-
ing all settings except the learning rate which is
re-initialized to 0.0001. Each randomly seeded
model is fine-tuned independently, so we are able
to report the standard deviation of ∆BLEU.

4.3 Contrastive Reconstruction Model

We compare our approach with reconstruction
from hidden states (HIDDEN). Following the best
practice of Wang et al. (2018a), two reconstruc-
tors are used to take hidden states from both the
encoder and the decoder. The corresponding two
reconstruction losses and the canonical transla-
tion loss were originally uniformly weighted (i.e.
1, 1, 1), but we found that balancing the recon-
struction and translation losses yields better results
(i.e. 0.5, 0.5, 1) in preliminary experiments.6

We use the reconstructor exclusively to compute
the reconstruction training loss. It has also been

used to re-rank translation hypotheses in prior
work, but Tu et al. (2017) showed in ablation stud-
ies that the gains from re-ranking are small com-
pared to those from training.

4.4 Results

Table 2 shows that our reconstruction approach
achieves small but consistent BLEU improve-
ments over the baseline on all eight tasks.7

We evaluate the impact of the Gumbel Softmax
hyperparameters on the development set. We se-
lect τ = 2 and β = 0/0.5 based on training sta-
bility and BLEU. Greedy search (i.e. β = 0) per-
forms similarly as sampling with increased Gum-
bel noise (i.e. more random translation selection
when β = 0.5): increased randomness in sam-
pling does not have a strong impact on BLEU,
even though random sampling may approximate
the data distribution better (Ott et al., 2018). We
hypothesize that more random translation selec-
tion introduces lower quality samples and there-
fore noisier training signals. This is consistent
with the observation that random sampling is less
effective for back-translation in low-resource set-
tings (Edunov et al., 2018).

Sampling-based reconstruction is effective even
if there is moderate domain mismatch between
the training and the test data, such as in the case
that the word type out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate
of TR→EN is larger than 20%. Larger improve-
ments can be achieved when the test data is closer
to training examples. For example, the OOV rate
of SW→EN is much smaller than the OOV rate of
TR→EN and the former obtains higher ∆BLEU.

Our approach yields more consistent results
than reconstructing from hidden states. The lat-
ter fails to improve BLEU in more difficult cases,
such as TR↔EN with high OOV rates. We ob-
serve extremely low training perplexity for HID-

 Hidden  Sampling

(b) development set

Figure 1: Training curves of perplexity on the training and the development sets for TR↔EN. Reconstructing from
hidden states (HIDDEN) and reconstructing from sampled translations (β = 0) are compared. HIDDEN achieves
extremely low training perplexity and suffers from unstable training during the early stage.

DEN compared with our proposed approach (Fig-
ure 1a). This suggests that HIDDEN yields repre-
sentations that memorize the input rather than im-
prove output representations.

Another advantage of our approach is that all
parameters were jointly pre-trained, which results
in more stable training behavior. By contrast, re-
constructing from hidden states requires to initial-
ize the reconstructors independently and suffers
from unstable early training behavior (Figure 1).

5 Conclusion

We studied reconstructing the input of NMT from
its intermediate translations to better exploit train-
ing samples in low-resource settings. We used
a bi-directional NMT model and the Straight-
Through Gumbel Softmax to build a fully dif-
ferentiable reconstruction model that does not re-
quire any additional parameters. We empirically
demonstrated that our approach is effective in
low-resource scenarios. In future work, we will
investigate the use of differentiable reconstruc-
tion from sampled sequences in unsupervised and
semi-supervised sequence generation tasks. In
particular, we will exploit monolingual corpora in
addition to parallel corpora for NMT.
