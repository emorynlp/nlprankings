Abstract
Simplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand informa-
tion for a whole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, would
have difficulty in understanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified. However, the
production of simplified texts can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task. In this paper
we show that the employment of a short list of simple simplification rules could result in texts
of comparable readability to those written as a result of applying a long list of more fine-grained
rules. We also prove that the simplification process based on the short list of simple rules is more
time efficient and consistent.

1 Rationale

Simplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand information for a
whole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, would have difficulty in
understanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified. Such users include but are not limited to
people with insufficient knowledge of the language in which the document is written, people with specific
language disorders and people with low literacy levels. However, while the production of simplified texts
is certainly an indispensable activity, it often proves to be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task.
Various methodologies and simplification strategies have been developed which are often employed by
authors to simplify original texts. Most methods involve a high number of rules which could result not
only in the simplification task being time-consuming but also in the authors getting confused as to which
rules to apply. We hypothesise that it is possible to achieve a comparable simplification effect by using a
small set of simple rules similar to the ones used in Controlled Languages which, in addition, enhances
the productivity and reliability of the simplification process.

In order to test our hypothesis we conduct the following experiments. First, we propose six Controlled
Language-inspired rules which we believe are simple and easy enough for writers of simplified texts to
understand and apply. We then ask two writers to apply these rules to a selection of newswire texts and
also to produce simplified versions of these texts using the 28 rules used in the Simplext project (Saggion
et al., 2011). Both sets of texts are compared in terms of readability. In both simplification tasks the time
efficiency is assessed and the inter-annotator agreement is evaluated. In an additional experiment, we
seek to investigate the possible effect of familiarisation in simplification. In this experiment a third
writer simplifies a sample of the texts used in the previous experiments by applying each set of rules in
a mixed sequence pattern which does not offer any familiarisation nor the advantage of one set of rules
over the other. Using these samples, three-way inter-annotator agreement is reported.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines related work on simplification rules.
Section 3 introduces our proposal for a small set of easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply rules and
contrasts them with the longer and more elaborate rules employed in the Simplext proposal. Section
4 details the experiments conducted in order to validate or refute our hypothesis, and outlines the data
used for the experiments. Section 5 presents and discusses the results, while the last section of the paper
summarises the main conclusions of this study.

2 Related work

Since the late 1990s, several initiatives which proposed guidelines for producing plain, easy-to-read and
more accessible documents have emerged. These include the “Federal Plain Language Guidelines”,
“Make it Simple, European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information for people with
Learning Disability”, and “Am I making myself clear? Mencap’s guidelines for accessible writing”.

The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)1 developed the first version of the
“Federal Plain Language Guidelines” (PlainLanguage, 2011) in the mid-90s and have revised it every
few years since then. Their original idea was to help writers of governmental documents (primarily
regulations) to write in a clear and and simple manner so that the users can: “find what they need; under-
stand what they find; and use what they find to meet their needs.” (PlainLanguage, 2011). The “Make it
Simple” European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information for people with Learning
Disability (Freyhoff et al., 1998) were produced by Inclusion Europe2 in order to assist writers in devel-
oping texts, publications and videos that are more accessible to people with intellectual disabilities and
other people who cannot read complex texts, and thus enable those people to be better protected from
discrimination and social injustice. The “Am I making myself clear?” Mencap’s guidelines for accessi-
ble writing (Mencap, 2002) were produced by the UK’s leading organisation working with people with
a learning disability.3 Their goal is to help in editing and writing accessible material for that specific
target population. All of these guidelines are concerned with both verbal content of documents and their
layout. As we are interested in text simplification and not in text representation, we will concentrate only
on the former. All three guidelines share similar instructions for accessible writing, some of them more
detailed than others. Table 1 allows us to have a quick overview of intersecting rules suggested by these
guidelines which were intended for slightly different purposes and target audiences.. For example, they
all advise the writer to use active voice instead of passive, use short, simple words and omit unnecessary
words, write short sentences and cover only one main idea per sentence, etc. However, the “Federal
Plain Language Guidelines” also instruct writers to use contractions where appropriate, avoid hidden
verbs (i.e. verbs converted into a noun), and place the main idea before exceptions and conditions, while
the other two guidelines do not go into many details. Some of the instructions, e.g. to use the simplest
form of a verb (present and not conditional or future), or to avoid double negatives and exceptions to
exceptions, are not present in the Mencap’s guidelines for accessible writing, while they are at the same
time implicitly present in the “Make it Simple” guidelines, and explicitly present in the “Federal Plain
Language Guidelines”.

Karreman et al. (2007) investigated whether the application of the “Make it Simple” guidelines to the
website’s content would enhance its usability for users with intellectual disabilities. Additionally, they
investigated whether the application of these guidelines would have a negative effect on users without
disabilities, as Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines4 state that creation of multiple versions of
the same website should be avoided whenever possible. The authors prepared two versions of a website,
the original one and the one adapted according to the “Make it Simple” guidelines. These two versions
were then tested for efficiency (searching and reading time) and effectiveness (comprehension) by 40
participants, 20 with diagnosed intellectual disabilities and 20 without. The results demonstrated that the
adaptation of the website according to the guidelines enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness for both
groups of participants.

There has been a body of work associated with the development and use of Controlled Languages
for simplification purposes. The original idea of developing a Controlled Language arose during the
1930s when influential scholars sought to establish a ‘minimal’ variety of English, a variety specifically
designed to make English accessible to and usable by the largest possible number of people worldwide
(Arnold et al., 1994). This variety was called Basic English and one of the central ideas was to use
a few hundred general-purpose words only. Operator verbs were to be used with a set of nouns and

adjectives to replace most of the derived verbs. The Controlled Language writing rules included various
rules such as ‘Keep it short and simple’ (Keep sentences short, Omit redundant words, Order the parts of
the sentence logically, Don’t change constructions in mid-sentence, Take care with the logic of and and
or) and ‘Make it explicit’ (Avoid elliptical constructions, Don’t omit conjunctions or relatives, Adhere to
the PACE dictionary, Avoid strings of nouns, Do not use -ing unless the word appears thus in the PACE
dictionary) (Arnold et al., 1994). The concept of controlled languages evolved and developed further and
they have been regarded as a prerequisite part of successful Machine Translation. Controlled Languages
have been also employed in a number of critical situations where ambiguity could be a problem.5

3 Simplification strategies: contrasting two sets of rules

The Simplext guidelines were written under the Simplext project, with the aim of helping the authors to
produce texts which would be accessible to people with Down syndrome. They follow the same main
ideas as those in “Make it Simple, European Guidelines for People with Intellectual Disability” but they
adapt the rules to their specific target population and the Spanish language. The Simplext guidelines
contain 28 main rules6 concerned with the verbal content of documents. Those rules cover the same
main ideas as our rules (see below), e.g. to keep sentences short, use only the most frequent words,

5The reader is referred to (Kittredge, 2003), (Cardey, 2009) and (Temnikova, 2012) for more details.
6The Simplext guidelines actually provide even more sub-rules for most of the main rules, but in this study we use only the

28 main rules.

remove redundant words, use a simpler paraphrase if applicable. However, the Simplext rules are more
fine-grained, thus providing several more specific rules instead of our more general rules. For example,
they explicitly instruct the writer to use frequent words, use non-ambiguous words, and not use words
with more than six syllables whenever it is possible.

On the other hand, the six simple rules selected for our study have been inspired from the rules in
Controlled Languages7. We conjecture that there is a small set of simple, easy-to-understand and easy-
to-apply rules which can be equally efficient in terms of simplicity (readability) and yet their employment
is less time-consuming and less contentious in practice. The rules which we propose are as follows
(examples are presented in Table 2):

1. Use simple sentences

We have selected this rule to ensure that the simplified version of the document features sufficiently
short and simple sentences only so that the reader does not have to process longer complex sen-
tences.

2. Remove anaphors

This rules caters for replacing the anaphors such as pronouns and one-anaphors with their antecedent
to minimise the risk of anaphoric ambiguity but also makes sure that the texts does not feature any
elliptical constructions which may be more difficult to understand.

3. Use active voice only

We have included this rule as active voice is generally easier to process.

4. Use the most frequent words only

Similarly to the practice recommended in Basic English, we recommend the use of the 1,000 most
frequent words in Spanish as documented by RAE (Real Academia Española)8. If this is not pos-
sible, then words from the list of the 5,000 most frequent Spanish words are resorted to9. We have
allowed the following exception for this rule. There are cases where a specific technical word occurs
in the text and which is unlikely to be on the list of 1,000 (or 5,000) basic / most frequent words in
Spanish. By way of example, in the sentence ‘Ana Juan ganó el Premio Nacional de Ilustración de
2010’ (Ana Juan won the national prize for illustration in 2010) the word Ilustración is considered
as technical and is not replaced with a basic word.

5. Remove redundant words

Our rules recommend the removal of redundant words or phrases which do not really contribute to
the understanding of the text.

6. Use a simpler paraphrase, if applicable

There are cases where the sentence is difficult to read or understand due among other things, to
its syntax. Our rules recommend that in such cases the original sentence or part of the sentence is
paraphrased.

4 Experiments and data

In order to test our hypothesis we conducted several experiments. We selected 10 newswire texts in
Spanish and asked two writers who are native speakers of Spanish and who have a language/linguistics
background, to apply both our six rules and the 28 Simplext rules in order to simplify these newswire
texts. The writers familiarised themselves with the rules beforehand, had an induction with the authors

of this paper and were asked to have sessions no longer than 1 hour so that potential fatigue did not com-
promise the experiments. In order to minimise potential familiarity effect (texts which already have been
simplified are expected to be simplified faster and more efficiently as they are familiar to the writers),
we allowed a few days interval between each time a specific text was simplified using different rules.
We applied the Spauldings Spanish Readability index – SSR (Spaulding, 1956) as well as the Lexical
Complexity index – LC (Anula, 2007) to assess the readability of the simplified texts. Both metrics have
shown a good correlation with the possible reading obstacles for various target populations (Štajner and
Saggion, 2013), and were used for the evaluation of the automatic TS system in Simplext (Drndarević et
al., 2013). We also asked a third writer to simplify samples from the texts used by the first two writers
which were pre-assessed to be of comparable complexity, with a view to establishing whether familiari-
sation has an effect on the output. The results of these readability experiments are presented in Tables 4
and 5 of the following section. We also recorded the time needed to simplify each text as an indication
of, among other things, ease of use of (and clarity for) each set of rules and its productivity in general;
these results are reported in Tables 6 and 7 of the following section.

Several experiments were conducted to assess the inter-annotator agreement. We believe that the inter-
annotator agreement is another good indicator as to how straightforward it is to apply a specific set of
simplification rules and how reliable the simplification process is in general. We compute the inter-
annotator agreement in terms of the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). BLEU score is widely used in
MT to compare the reference translation with the output of the system (translation hypothesis). Here we
use the BLEU score to compare the simple sentences produced by one annotator with the corresponding
sentences of another annotator. We measure the inter-annotator agreement for all three pairs of annotators
(Table 8). In addition, we examined how many times each of the rules was selected by each writer which
in our view would be not only a way of accounting for agreement and but also assessing the usefulness
of every rule and how balanced a set of rules is in general. Tables 9 and 10 report the results of this study
on the texts simplified by all three annotators.

While in the above experiments (which involved only two writers) we made sure that there was at
least a few days’ span between applying the different sets of rules on the same text, we felt that the risk
of familiarity effect could not be removed completely. It is expected that a text which has already been
simplified would take less time to be simplified for a second time, even if different rules are applied.
Also, as Simplext rules were always applied after our simple rules, we felt that additional experiments
were needed where (i) there would be no risk of familiarisation effect and (ii) the rules were applied in a
mixed order so that any experience gained from simplification in general cannot serve as unfair advantage
to one of the sets of rules. In an experiment seeking to investigate the possible effect of familiarisation
in simplification, a third writer simplified a selection of the texts used in the previous experiments by
applying each set of rules in a mixed sequence pattern which does not offer any familiarisation nor any
advantage of one set of rules over the other. In other words, instead of this writer simplifying the same
text twice using different rules, different texts of comparable level of simplicity, informed by the input of
the first two writers, were selected and simplified. Based on the results of the time efficiency experiment
(Table 6, next section), we chose three pairs (Pair 1, Pair 2 and Pair 3) of texts where for each pair the
texts are deemed to be of comparable complexity. By way of example, in Pair 1 which consists of Text 1
and Text 2, Annotator 1 needed the same time for both texts with Simplext rules, and similar time with
our simple rules, Annotator 2 needed the same time with our rules, and similar time with Simplext rules.
Pair 2 consists of Text 3 and Text 4 and Pair 3 is made of Text 9 and Text 10 for the same reasons as
above. The simplification performed by a third writer makes it possible to report readability indices for
the text simplified by the third writer, as well as the time taken to simplify, and three-way agreement.

The 10 texts made available by the Spanish news agency Servimedia10 belong to one of the four
following domains: international news (Texts 2, 6, and 10), national news (Texts 4 and 8), society (Texts
3 and 7), or culture (Texts 1, 5, and 9). The sizes of these samples (in sentences and words) are listed in

5 Results and discussion

This section presents the results of a study on the readability of texts simplified with our rules as well as
with the Simplext rules. It also reports on a time efficiency experiment whose objective is to identify the
rules which are less time-consuming to apply. Next, interannotator agreement in terms of BLEU score
and selection of rules is discussed and finally, an interpretation of the results of an experiment seeking to
establish any familiarisation effect in simplification is provided.

5.1 Readability study

As can be observed from Table 4, simplification performed by our rules improves the readability of
texts in almost all cases (note the values in column ‘original’ with those in columns A-I and A-II for
both indices LC and SSR). This improvement was statistically significant in terms of both indices when
the texts were simplified by the second annotator, and in terms of the SSR index when the texts were
simplified by the first annotator (lower readability indices indicate text which is easier to read).11.

The differences in readability between the texts written by employing our simplification rules (columns
A-I and A-II) and those written by following the Simplext rules (columns B-I and B-II), were not sta-
tistically significant when the simplification was performed by the second annotator, while they were
significant when the simplification was performed by the first annotator. When interpreting these results,
it is also important to bear in mind that the LC index measures only the lexical complexity of a text,
while the SSR index measures general complexity of a text, including both its lexical and its syntactic
complexity. We also benefited from the familiarity experiment in which a third annotator was involved,
to assess the readability of the simplified versions of the texts of comparable complexity, as produced by
the third additional annotator. The results, which are reported in Table 5, suggest that in fact the texts
simplified by the third annotator with our rules are easier to read. On the basis of these readability results,
it can be concluded that the application of Simplext rules does not necessarily result in a (significantly)
simpler version than the one produced by our rules and comparable results are likely to be achieved.

5.2 Time efficiency experiment
The results from the time efficiency experiment (Table 6) show that in all cases, the simplification with
our rules is done in shorter (or equal) time. This is also confirmed by the time needed by the third
annotator in the additional experiment seeking to establish any familiarity effect (Table 7), where texts
of comparable complexity simplified by our rules were simplified faster than the texts simplified with the
Simplext rules. In our view, the results of these experiments are indicative not only of the time and cost
savings when using our rules but also of our rules being simpler for writers and more straightforward to
employ.

5.3 Inter-annotator agreement and selection of rules
Table 8 presents the inter-annotator agreement in terms of BLEU score. This score accounts for the
agreement during the simplification process and the higher the value, the more similar the simplifications
performed by the annotators are. In both cases where the difference is significant our rules exhibited a
higher degree of agreement among the annotators than the Simplext rules.

B (Simplext) 30.46 55.12 33.13

We also analysed how many times each rule was applied by each of the annotators (the annotators
were asked to write the numbers of all rules used during simplification of each sentence right after that
sentence). We regard the frequency of selection of rules as another indicator for the inter-annotator

Table 10: Frequency of selection of each of the Simplext rules (texts 2, 4, and 10).

It can be seen that there is less difference/discrepancy in the selection of our rules as opposed to the
Simplext rules and hence the simplification process can be regarded as more consistent and reliable.
Here again, there is higher agreement on our rules as opposed to the Simplext ones. This phenomenon is
illustrated in the following example where the annotators used the Simplext rules:

Original: “Esta reforma prevé que todos los delitos relacionados con la seguridad vial (como
exceso de velocidad o conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol, las drogas, sin carné o sin puntos)
pueden conllevar el decomiso del vehı́culo, si bien la decisión dependerá del juez.”
[This reform will envisage that all crimes related to road safety (such as speeding, driving
while under the effects of alcohol or drugs or driving without a licence or points) could result
in confiscation of the vehicle, although the decision to do so depends on the judge.]

Annotator 1: “El cambio del Código Penal dice que la decisión de embargar el coche o moto
dependerá del juez.” (rules used: 5,4,1,4,4)
[The change of the penal code says that the decision to confiscate the car or motorbike depends
on the judge.]

Annotator 2: “Esta reforma prevé que todos los delitos relacionados con la seguridad vial
como exceso de velocidad o conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol, las drogas, sin carné o sin
puntos. Los delitos pueden conllevar la retirada del vehı́culo pero la decisión dependerá del
juez.” (rules used: 26,17,20,1,8)
[This reform will envisage that all crimes related to road safety such as speeding or driving
under the effects of alcohol, drugs, without a license or points. The crimes could result in
confiscation of the vehicle but the decision depends on the judge.]

Annotator 3: “La reforma del Código Penal prevé que todos los delitos relacionados con la
seguridad vial pueden dar lugar a la pérdida del vehı́culo, aunque la decisión dependerá del
juez.” (rules used: 4,16,4,9)
[The penal code reform will envisage that all crimes related to road safety could result in loss
of the vehicle, although the decision depends on the judge.]

5.4 Familiarisation experiment

From the above results, it can be seen that the simplified texts written by the third annotator using a mixed
pattern indicate clearer preference to our simple rules in terms of better readability, time efficiency and
reliability as opposed to the simplified texts written by Annotator 1 and Annotator 2 where the Simplext
texts were applied only at the end. On the basis of this, we conjecture that this difference may be strongly
connected with the lingering familiarisation of the annotators when they simplify texts they have already
simplified.

6 Conclusions

Simplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand information for a
whole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, would have difficulty in
understanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified. However, the production of simplified
texts can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task. The results of this study show that a small set
of six simple rules, inspired by the concept of Controlled Languages, could produce simplified texts of
comparable readability to those produced using a long list of more fine-grained rules such as the ones
used in the Simplext project. In addition, the results of this study suggest that our simple rules could be
more time-efficient and reliable.
