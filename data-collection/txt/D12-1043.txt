Abstract

This paper present a new readability formula
for French as a foreign language (FFL), which
relies on 46 textual features representative of
the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as
well as some of the specificities of the FFL
context. We report comparisons between sev-
eral techniques for feature selection and var-
ious learning algorithms. Our best model,
based on support vector machines (SVM), sig-
nificantly outperforms previous FFL formulas.
We also found that semantic features behave
poorly in our case, in contrast with some pre-
vious readability studies on English as a first
language.

1 Introduction

Whether in a first language (L1) or a second and for-
eign language (L2), learning to read has been and re-
mains one of the major concerns of education. When
a teacher wants to improve his/her students’ reading
skills, he/she uses reading exercises, whether there
are guided or independent. For this practice to be
efficient, it is necessary that the texts suit the level
of students (O’Connor et al., 2002). This condition
is sometimes difficult to meet for teachers wishing
to get off the beaten tracks by not using texts from
levelled textbooks or readers.

In this context, readability formulas have long
been used to help teachers faster select texts for their
students. These formulas are reproducible meth-
ods that aim at matching readers and texts relative
to their reading difficulty level. The Flesch (1948)
and Dale and Chall (1948) formulas are probably

the best-known examples of those. They are typical
of classic formulas, the first major methodological
paradigm developed in the field during the 40’s and
50’s. They were kept as parsimonious as possible,
using linear regression to combined two, or some-
times, three surface features, such as word mean
length, sentence mean length, or proportion of out-
of-simple-vocabulary words.

Later, some scholars (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979;
Redish and Selzer, 1985) argued that the classic for-
mulas suffer from several shortcomings. These for-
mulas only take into account superficial features, ig-
noring other important aspects contributing to text
difficulty, such as coherence, content density, infer-
ence load, etc. They also omit the interactive as-
pect of the reading process. In the 80’s, a second
paradigm, inspired by structuro-cognitivist theories,
intended to overcome these issues. It focused on
higher textual dimensions, such as inference load
(Kintsch and Vipond, 1979; Kemper, 1983), den-
sity of concepts (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979), or
macrostructure (Meyer, 1982). However, these at-
tempts did not achieve better results than the clas-
sic approach, even though they used more principled
and more complex features.

Recently, a third paradigm, referred to as the “AI
readability” by François (2011a), has emerged in the
field. Studies that are part of this current share three
key features: the use of a large number of texts as-
sessed by experts (coming from textbooks, simpli-
fied newspapers or web resources) as training data ;
the use of NPL-enable features able to capture a
wider range of readability factors, and the combi-
nation of those features through a machine learning

algorithm. Since the work of Si and Callan (2001),
this paradigm have spawn several studies for English
(Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Heilman et
al., 2008; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Feng et
al., 2010).

However, for French, the field is far from being so
thriving. To our knowledge, only two “AI readabil-
ity” have been designed so far for French L1 and
only one for French as a foreign language (FFL)
(see Section 2). This paper reports some experi-
ments aimed at designing a more efficient readabil-
ity model for FFL. In Section 2, it is further argue
why a new formula was necessary for FFL. Section
3 covers the various methodological steps required
to devise the model, whose results are reported in
Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses some inter-
esting insights gained by this work.

2 Readability models for French

Readability of French never enjoyed a large suc-
cess: while readability studies on English dates back
to the 20’s, it is only in 1957 that the French-
speaking world discovered it through the work of
Conquet (1957). Since then, only a few studies fo-
cused on the topic.

The two first French L1 formulas were adap-
tations of the Flesch formula (Kandel and Moles,
1958; de Landsheere, 1963). It is only with
Henry (1975) that French got a model fitting the
particularities of the language. Henry used cloze
tests to assess the level of 60 texts from primary and
secondary school textbooks and trained three for-
mulas on this corpus. It is worth mentioning that
Henry’s formulas have been applied to FFL by Cor-
naire (1988). During the same time, Richaudeau
explored a different path, as a representative of the
structuro-cognitivist paradigm. He used the num-
ber of words recalled by a subject after he/she has
just read a sentence as a device to measure under-
standing and provided an “efficiency formula” of
texts (Richaudeau, 1979). Although more modern
in its conception, Richaudeau’s hard-to-implement
formula did not achieve the same recognition in the
French speaking world as Henry’s.

After those two major efforts, few works fol-
lowed. It is worth mentioning two more authors:
Mesnager (1989), who designed a classic formula

for children that draw inspiration from the Dale and
Chall (1948) formula and Daoust et al. (1996), who
developed SATO-CALIBRAGE, a program assessing
text difficulty from the first to the eleventh grade.
It can be considered as the first “AI formula” for
French L1, since it made use of NLP-enabled fea-
tures. It is also the last formula published for French
L1, if we except the adaptation of the model by
Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) to French.

As regards to French L2, the literature is even
sparser. Tharp (1939) published a first formula tak-
ing into account one particularity of the L2 context:
the cognates. Those are words sharing a similar
form and meaning across two languages and hav-
ing a facilitating effect in reading. This idea was re-
cently replicated by Uitdenbogerd (2005), who com-
bined a syntactic feature, the mean number of words
per sentence, with the number of cognates per 100
words in her formula. Although taking into account
this effect of the L1 on L2 reading is very interest-
ing, these two studies are confined to a limited audi-
ence: English speakers learning French. As regards
a more generic approach, François (2009) recently
published an “AI formula” for FFL, based on lo-
gistic regression and ten features. Among those, he
stressed the use of verbal tense information as a way
to improve performance. However, the set of fea-
tures he experimented remains limited (about 20).

From all this, it seems clear that FFL readability
needs to be addressed more thoroughly, especially if
we are willing to get a generic model, able to make
predictions for L2 readers with any L1 background.
The rest of this paper describes one such attempt.

3 Design of the formula

The design of an “AI readability” formula involves
the same three steps as a classification problem.
First, one need to gather a gold-standard corpus
large enough to reliably train the parameters of a
learning algorithm, as described in Section 3.1. The
next step, covered in Section 3.2, consists in defin-
ing a set of predictors, that is to say, linguistic char-
acteristics of the texts that will be used to predict the
difficulty level of new texts. Finally, the best sub-
set of these predictors is combined within a learning
algorithm to obtain the best model possible. Experi-
ments at this level are reported in Section 3.3.

3.1 The corpus

A gold-standard for readability consists in texts la-
belled according to their difficulty. For this, it is first
necessary to choose a difficulty scale used for the la-
bels (for English L1, it is usually the 12 grade levels
scale), that also constrains the output of the formula.
Then, each text have to be assessed with a method
able to measure the reading comprehension level of
the target population.

Regarding the scale, an obvious choice for
the foreign language context was the begin-
ner/intermediate/advanced continuum, recently re-
defined in the Common European Framework of
Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Eu-
rope, 2001) as the six following levels: A1 (Break-
through); A2 (Waystage); B1 (Threshold); B2 (Van-
tage); C1 (Effective Operational Proficiency) and C2
(Mastery). This scale has now become the reference
for foreign language education, at least in Europe.

Assessing the reading difficulty of texts with re-
spect to a target population of readers was a more
challenging issue. Several techniques have been
used in the literature, the most important of which
are comprehension tests, cloze tests and expert
judgements. They all postulate a given population of
readers, although relying on expert judgements save
the need for a sample of subjects to take a test. In
this case, texts comes from textbooks whose content
difficulty have been assessed by the publishers.

This last criterion is now mainstream in “AI read-
ability”, since it is very practical and facilitates the
creation of a large corpus, but it has its own short-
comings. Studies such as van Oosten et al. (2011)
found that expert agreement on a same corpus of
texts might be insufficient for a classification task.

For this study, we nevertheless relied on expert
judgements, since we needed a large amount of la-
belled texts to ensure a robust statistical learning.
We selected 28 FFL textbooks, published after 2001
and designed for adults or adolescents learning FFL
for general purposes. From those, we extracted
2,160 texts related to a reading comprehension task
and assigned to each of them the same level as the
textbook it came from.

As it was expected from van Oosten et al. (2011)’s
study, differences in the publishers’ conception of
difficulty led to an heterogeneous labelling between

textbooks. This heterogeneity was detected in three
of the six levels (A1, A2, and B1) using ANOVA
based on two classic readability features as inde-
pendent variables: the mean number of words per
sentence and the mean number of letters per word.
A subsequent qualitative analysis revealed that most
of the heterogeneity was coming from textbooks fol-
lowing the new didactic approach recommended by
the CEFR: the task-oriented approach, which fo-
cuses more on the task than the text when labelling
the overall reading activity. Therefore, we decided
to remove those type of textbooks from our corpus,
which amounted to 5 books and 249 texts. The re-
maining 1,852 excerpts were kept for our experi-
ments. Their distribution is displayed in Table 1 as
regard to the number of texts and tokens.

3.2 The predictors
In a second step, every text of the corpus was rep-
resented as a numeric vector of 406 features, each
of them representing a linguistic dimension of the
text as a single number. Their implementation drew
on two different sources of inspiration: the existing
predictors in the English and French literature and
the psycholinguistic literature on the reading pro-
cess. The complete set was classified in four fam-
ilies, depending on the kind of information each one
is supposed to represent. These families were: “lex-
ical”, “syntactic”, “semantic”, and “specific to FFL
context”. Each of them was further divided in sub-
families, described in the rest of the section 1.

3.2.1 Lexical Features
Lexical features have been shown to be the most

important level of information in many readability
studies (Chall and Dale, 1995; Lorge, 1944). It is
then not surprising that a wide range of lexical pre-
dictors have been developed in the literature. Our
own set comprised the following subfamilies:

Statistics of lexical frequencies: frequencies of
words in a text are a good indicator of the text’s over-
all difficulty (Stenner, 1996). They are usually sum-
marized via the mean, but we also tested the median,
the interquartile range, as well as the 75th and 90th

percentiles.
1Space restrictions did not enable us to formally defined

each variable used in this study. The reader may consult
François (2011b) for a more comprehensive description.

Table 1: Distribution of the number of texts and tokens per level in our corpus.

We used Lexique3 (New et al., 2007) as our fre-
quency database. It is a lexicon including about
50,000 lemmas and 125,000 inflected forms whose
frequencies were obtained from movie subtitles.
Since French has a rich morphology, we considered
the probabilities of both lemma and inflected forms.
Moreover, following an idea from Elley (1969), we
also computed the above mentioned statistics for
given POS words, such as content word, nouns,
verbs, etc.

Percentage of words not in a reference list: part
of the Dale and Chall (1948)’s formula, this feature
is one of the most famous in readability. For our
experiments, two word lists for FFL were used: the
well-known – but already dated – Gougenheim et
al. (1964)’s list and a second one that was found at
the end of one FFL textbook: Alter Ego (Berthet et
al., 2006). Different sizes were also experimented
for both lists.

Word length: mean word length is another classic
feature in readability (Flesch, 1948; Smith, 1961).
We used various statistics based on the number of
letters per word (mean, median, percentiles, etc.).

N-grams models: Si and Callan (2001) shown
that n-grams models can successfully be applied to
readability. We then used both a simple unigram ap-
proach based on the frequencies from Lexique3, and
a more complex bigram model trained on two dif-
ferent corpora: the Google n-grams (Michel et al.,
2011) and a corpus of newspaper articles from Le
Soir amounting to 5, 000, 000 words 2. Both were
normalized according the length n of the text as fol-
lows:

P (text) =
1

n

n∑
i=1

logP (wi|h) (1)

where wi is the ith word and h a limited history of
length 0 (unigram) or 1 (bigram).

2Smoothing algorithms used were respectively the simple
Good-Turing algorithm (Gale and Sampson, 1995) for unigrams
and linear interpolation (Chen and Goodman, 1999) for the bi-
grams.

Lexical diversity: the repetition effect is another
factor known to affect the reading process (Bowers,
2000). It has been mainly implemented through the
classic type-token ratio (TTR) that suffers from be-
ing dependent on the text length. This is why we
defined a normalized TTR, which is the mean score
of several TTRs, computed on text’s fragments of
equal length. This way, long texts were made com-
parable with short ones.

Orthographic neighborhood: we finally sug-
gested a new lexical variable, based on the fact that
some characteristics of the orthographic neighbors 3

of a word are known to impact the reading of this
word (Andrews, 1997). Thirteen predictors were
implemented to account for the number or the fre-
quency of the orthographic neighbors of all words in
a text.

3.2.2 Syntactic features
The syntactic level of information is another tradi-

tional area of investigation in readability. Although
most of the scholars in the field agree that it does not
lead to such efficient predictors as the lexical level,
they have noticed it can be combined with the latter
to improve performance of readability formulas. We
therefore investigated the following subfamilies:

Sentence length: the traditional approach to syn-
tactic difficulty relied on the number of words per
sentence. We have approached it through various
statistics such as the mean, the median, or several
percentiles.

Part of speech ratios: Bormuth (1966) demon-
strated the good predictive power of some POS ra-
tios in a text. We computed 156 ratios based on
TreeTagger’s POS (Schmid, 1994). They operated
as proxies for the syntactic complexity of sentences,
since we did not use features based on a parser 4.

3The orthographic neighbors of a word X have been defined
by Coltheart (1978) as all the words of the same length as X and
varying from it only by one letter (eg. FIST and GIST).

4This choice was motivated as follows. Bormuth (1966),
who performed a manual annotation of the syntactic structures

469



Verbs: although the tense and moods found in a
text have been hardly considered in the field, Car-
reiras et al. (1997) suggested that verbal aspects are
important while building a mental representation of
a text and therefore impact its understanding. They
help the reader to distinguish between major and
minor elements associated with events described by
these verbs. We therefore replicated and enhanced
the feature set proposed by François (2009), consid-
ering either binary indicators or proportions of the
use of tenses or moods in a text.

3.2.3 Semantic features

The importance of semantic and cognitive
factors have been particularly stressed by the
structuro-cognitivist paradigm, although Miller and
Kintsch (1980), as well as Kemper (1983), eventu-
ally admitted not being able to demonstrate the supe-
riority of those new predictors over traditional ones.
More recent work also reported limited evidence of
this alleged superiority (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008;
Feng et al., 2010). In order to clarify as much as
possible the situation for FFL, we implemented the
following features:

Personnalization level: Dale and Tyler (1934)
suggested that informal texts should be easier to read
and that informality might be assessed through the
type of personal pronouns found in a text. On this as-
sumption, 13 variables were defined to take into ac-
count various personal pronouns proportions in the
text.

Conceptual density: Kintsch et al. (1975) showed
that the number of propositions as well as the num-
ber of different arguments in a sentence influence
its reading time. Following Kintsch’s propositional
model, we used Densidées (Lee et al., 2010) to cap-
ture conceptual complexity. It is a program able to
estimate the mean number of propositions per word
in a text using 35 rules relying on lexical and POS
clues.

in its corpus, noticed that features based on parse trees were
less efficient than classic ones, such as sentence length or part
of speech ratios. Therefore, it seemed unlikely that the infor-
mation collected by means of syntactic parsers, which are still
committing a significant number of errors, at least for French,
would belie these findings.

Lexical cohesion : the level of cohesion in a text
was measured as the average cosine of all pair of
adjacent sentences in the text. Each sentence was
represented by a numeric weighted vector (based on
words) and projected in a vector space. As sug-
gested by Foltz and al. (1998), two methods were
used to define the vector space and weight every
word: the tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document
frequency) and the latent semantic analysis (LSA).
The first approach, called “word overlap”, corre-
sponds to the “noun overlap” defined by Graesser et
al. (2004, 199), except that all type of POS are taken
into account. For LSA, we applied a singular value
decomposition (SVD), and after comparing various
sizes with a cross-validation procedure, we retained
a small 15-dimensional space.

3.2.4 Features specific to FFL
Apart from the effect of cognates (Uitdenbogerd,

2005; Tharp, 1939), few features specific to the L2
context were previously investigated. It is probably
because such an approach requires to train a model
for each pair of language of interest and gather suit-
able data for evaluation. Since our study intended to
design a generic model, we focused on specific pre-
dictors affecting L2 reading, whatever the learner’s
mother tongue is:

Multi-word expressions (MWE): MWEs are ac-
knowledged to cause problems to L2 learners for
production (Bahns and Eldaw, 1993). However, the
effect of MWE on the reception side remains un-
clear, especially for beginners. Ozasa et al. (2007)
tested the mean of the absolute frequency of all
MWEs in a text as an indication of its difficulty,
but it appeared non significant. In a latter experi-
ment involving a larger set of MWE-based predic-
tors, François and Watrin (2011) detected a signifi-
cant, but limited effect. We therefore replicated this
set, which includes variables based on the frequen-
cies of MWE, their syntactic structure, their number
or their length. Frequencies were estimated on the
same corpora as the bigram model described above
(Google and Le Soir).

Type of text: Finally, we defined five simple vari-
ables aiming at identifying dialogues, such as pres-
ence of commas, ratio of punctuation, etc. as sug-
gested by Henry (1975). This focus on dialogue was

explained by their extensive use in foreign language
teaching, especially in the first levels. Furthermore,
even for L1, various scholars stressed the fact that
dialogues are often written in a simpler style and
have a more mundane content (Dolch, 1948; Flesch,
1948).

3.3 The algorithms

The last step in the development of our formula was
to select the most informative subset of features and
combine them in a state-of-the-art machine learn-
ing algorithm. The algorithms originally consid-
ered were six: multinomial and ordinal logistic re-
gression (respectively MLR and OLR), classifica-
tion trees, bagging, boosting (both based on decision
trees) and support vector machine (SVM). However,
since the logistic models and the SVM clearly out-
performed the others three, we will reported only
about those in the next section.

4 Results

The experiments based on this methodology were
twofold. First, we assessed the predictive power
of each of the 406 features, considered in a bivari-
ate relationship with difficulty. Second, we selected
various subsets of features for training models and

compared their performance. The two next sections
summarize the main findings obtained during these
two steps.

4.1 The efficiency of predictors

Spearman correlation was used to assess the effi-
ciency of each predictor, to better account for non-
linear relationships with the criterion. Values for
some variables among the four families are reported
in Table 2. In accordance with the literature, it ap-
peared that the best family of predictors were the
lexical one, followed by the syntactic one. On the
contrary, semantic and specific to FFL features did
not perform so well, with the exception of the LSA-
based feature (avLocalLsa-Lem).

Of all predictors, the best was surprisingly PA-
Alterego, a list-based variable inspired by Dale and
Chall (1948), but adapted to the FFL context, since
the list of easy words used came from a FFL text-
book (Alter Ego 1). This suggests that, although the
predictive power of “specific to FFL” features was
low, specialization to the FFL context was beneficial
at other levels.

471



4.2 The models

Once the best single predictors were identified, it
was possible to combine several of them in a read-
ability model for comparison. This required some
corpus preparation. Since preliminary experiments
showed that the equal prior probabilities are required
to ensure a unbiased training, the whole corpus was
resampled to get the same number of texts per level
(108), which amounted to a total of 648 texts. We
then split this smaller corpus into two sets. 240 texts
were kept for development purposes, mainly feature
selection and estimation of the meta-parameters γ
and C for the SVM. The remaining 408 texts were
used for evaluating performance of our readability
models.

4.2.1 Selection of the features
Several ways of selecting the smallest “best” sub-

set of features were compared, given that some
variables are partly redundant when combined to-
gether. The first method was based on the
structuro-cognitivist assumption that readability for-
mulas should include other features than just lexico-
syntactical ones, in order to maximize variety of in-
formation. Therefore, we tried an “expert” selec-
tion, keeping either the best feature among each of
the four families (set Exp1), or the two best features
(set Exp2) 5.

These “expert” approaches were compared to an
automatic selection, using either a stepwise proce-
dure 6 for logistic regression (OLR and MLR) or
a built-in regularization (Bishop, 2006, 10) for the
SVM, based on the 46 best predictors inside each
subfamily.

For the sake of comparison, we also defined two
other sets: one that corresponds to a random clas-
sification (the empty subset), and a baseline, based
on two classics predictors (number of letters per
word and number of words per sentence), which
aimed to mimic classic formulas such as those of

5For the syntactic level, since the two best variables be-
longed to the same subfamily (see Section 3.2) and were too
highly intercorrelated, the 90th percentile of the sentence length
(NWS90) was replaced by the best feature from another subfam-
ily: the presence of at least one present participle (PPres).

6In order to suppress as much random effects as possible, the
selection process was repeated 100 times via a bootstrapping
.632 procedure (Tufféry, 2007, 396-371) and only the features
selected at least 50 times out of 100 were kept.

Flesch (1948) or Dale and Chall (1948). A summary
of the features included in each subset is available in
Table 3.

4.2.2 Evaluation of the models
The next step then consisted in training logistic

and SVM models for each of the above subsets.
Their performances, reported in Table 4, were as-
sessed using five measures: the multiple correlation
ratio (R), the accuracy (acc), the adjacent accuracy 7

(adjacc), the root mean square error (rmse) and the
mean absolute error (mae). It should be noted that
each of these measures was estimated through a ten-
fold cross-validation procedure, which allowed us to
compare performances of different models with a T-
test.

The comparison between the models was per-
formed in two steps. First, we computed T-tests
based on adjacc to compare the models based on
a same set of features (either Exp1, Exp2, or Auto).
This allowed us to pick up the best classifier for each
set. In a second step, these three best models were
compared the same way, which resulted in the se-
lection of the very best classifier. The decision of
adopting the adjacent accuracy as a criterion instead
of the accuracy was motivated by our conviction that
our system should rather avoid serious errors (i.e.
larger than one level) than be more accurate, while
sometimes generating terrible mistakes. However, it
appeared that both metrics were mostly consistent.

The performance of the different models are dis-
played in Table 4. It is first interesting to note that
the baseline (based on SVM) already gives interest-
ing results. It reaches a classification accuracy of
34%, which is about twice the random. As regards
the first model (Exp1), based on RLM and including
four predictors, it outperforms the baseline by 5%, a
difference close to significance (t(9) = 1.77; p =
0.055). Therefore, combining variables from sev-
eral families seems to improve performance over the
“classic” baseline, limited to lexico-syntactic fea-
tures.

This finding is reinforced by the SVM model
from Exp2, which includes eight features. It per-
forms significantly better than the baseline (t(9) =

7Heilman et al. (2008) defined it as “the proportion of pre-
dictions that were within one level of the human assigned label
for the given text”.

2.36; p = 0.02), with an accuracy gain of 7%. How-
ever, to that point, it was not clear whether this supe-
riority was indeed a consequence of maximizing the
kind of information brought to the model or merely
the result of the increased number of predictor.

We thus performed another experiment to address
this issue. The model Exp1 was compared with
Auto-OLR, the best ordinal logistic model obtained
through the stepwise selection (see Tables 4 and
3), and previously discarded as a result of the T-
test comparisons. Like Exp1, it also contains four
predictors, but they are all lexical or syntactic fea-
tures. Therefore, this model does not maximize the
type of information. Surprisingly, we observed that
Auto-OLR obtained similar and even slightly bet-
ter performance than Exp1 (+2% for both acc and
adjacc). Thus, the claim that maximizing the source
of information should yield better models did not
stand on our data.

Finally, our best performing model was based on
the Auto feature set and SVM. Its accuracy was in-
creased by 8% in comparison with the Exp2 model,
which is clearly a significant improvement (t(9) =
2.61; p = 0.01), and outperformed the baseline by
15%. As mentioned previously, this model includes
46 features coming from our four families. It is
worth mentioning that the quality of the predictions
is not the same across the levels, as shown in Ta-
ble 5. They are more accurate for classes situated
at both ends of the difficulty scale, namely A1, C1

and C2. For A1, this is explained because texts for
beginners are more typical, having very short sen-
tences and simple words. However, the case of C1
and C2 classes is more surprising and might be due
to some specificities of the learning algorithm.

very similar to the average value of the model.

We also assessed the specific contribution of each
family of features in two ways: on one hand, we
trained a model including only the features from this
family; on the other hand, we trained a model in-
cluding all features except those from this family.
Results for the four families are displayed at Table 6.

It appeared that the lexical family was the most
accurate set of predictors (40.5%) and yielded the
highest loss in performance when set aside, espe-
cially for adjacent accuracy. In fact, this was the
only set whose absence significantly impacted ad-
jacent accuracy, suggesting that the other type of
predictors can only improve the accuracy of predic-
tions, but are not able to reduce the amount of crit-
ical mistakes. The second best family was, expect-
edly, the syntactic one. Its accuracy closely match
that of the lexical set, although more severe mistakes
were made, as shown by the drop in adjacent accu-

473



racy. Finally, our two other families was clearly in-
ferior, but they still improved slightly the accuracy
of our model, although not the adjacent accuracy.

4.2.3 Comparaison with previous work
Comparisons with other FFL models are difficult

to provide: not only there are few formulas available
for FFL, but some of these focus on a different au-
dience, making comparability low. This is why we
were able to compare our results with only two pre-
vious models.

The first of them is a classic readability formula
by Kandel and Moles (1958), which is an adaptation
of the Flesch (1948) formula for French:

Y = 207− 1.015lp− 0.736lm (2)

where Y is a readability score ranging from 100
(easiest) to 0 (harder); lp is the average number of
words per sentence and lm is the average number
of syllables per 100 words. Although it was not de-
signed for FFL, we considered it, since it is one of
the most well-known formula for French and the two
features combined are very general. Their predic-
tive power should not vary much in both contexts, as
shown by Greenfield (2004) for English. We evalu-
ated it on the same test corpus as our SVM model
and obtained really lower values : a R of 0.55 and
an accuracy of 33%.

The second model was that of François (2009),
which is based on a multinomial logistic regression
including ten features: a unigram model similar to
ML3, the number of letters per word, the number of
words per sentence, and binary variables indicating
the presence of a past participle, present participle,
imperfect, infinitive, conditional, future and present
subjunctive tenses in the text. To our knowledge,
this model is the best current generic model avail-
able for FFL. On our data, it yielded an accuracy of

41% and an adjacent accuracy of 72.7%, both esti-
mated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure.
Therefore, our new approach achieved an accuracy
gain of 8% over this state-of-the-art model, which
was considered as a significant difference (t(9) =
3.72; p = 0.002).

Apart of those two studies, Uitdenbogerd (2005)
also developed recently a FFL formula. However, as
explained previously, this work focused on a spe-
cific category of L2 readers, the English-speakers
learning FFL, which resulted in a different problem.
She reported a higher R than us (0.87 against 0.73).
However, this value might be the training one and
was estimated on a small amount of novel begin-
nings. It is therefore likely that our model generalize
better, especially across genres and L2 readers with
different L1 backgrounds.

5 Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a new “AI readability”
formula for FFL, able to predict the level of texts
according to the largely-spread CEFR scale. Our
model is based on a SVM classifier and combines 46
features corresponding to several levels of linguis-
tic information. Among those, we suggested some
new features: the normalized TTR and the set of
variables based on several characteristics of words’
neighbors. Comparing our approach with two pre-
viously published formulas, our model significantly
outperformed both these works. Therefore, it repre-
sent a robust generic solution for FFL readers will-
ing to find various kind of texts that suit their lin-
guistic abilities.

Besides the creation of a new FFL readability
formula, this study produced two valuable insights.
First, we showed that maximizing the type of lin-
guistic information might not be the best path to go,
since a model based on four lexico-syntactic fea-
tures yielded predictions as accurate as those of a
model relying on our Exp1 set of variables. How-
ever, this finding might be partly accounted by the
lower predictive power of the features from the se-
mantic and specific-to-FFL family, with the notable
exception of the LSA-based predictor (avLocalLsa-
Lem), which is the third best predictor when consid-
ered alone.

This leads us to our second finding, relative to the

474



set of semantic features. Yet their importance was
largely praised in the structuro-cognitivist paradigm
and in most of the recent works, our experiments
cast serious doubts about their efficiency, at least in
a L2 context. Not only the expert models, to which
we imposed the presence of one or two semantic pre-
dictors, did not perform the best, but none of the
features from our semantic set was retained during
the automatic selection of the variables for the lo-
gistic models. On the contrary, in some subsets,
the LSA-based feature was sometimes considered as
collinear with the other variables. Finally and fore-
most, we showed that dropping the semantic features
did not impact significantly the performance of our
best model.

With reservations one may have because of the
limited number of semantic predictors in our set,
these results however raise some concerns about
whether the information coming from semantic vari-
ables is really different from that carried by lexico-
syntactic features. Our results clearly show that
this may not be the case. This conclusion con-
tradicts the assumptions of the structuro-cognitivist
paradigm, but corroborates Chall and Dale (1995)’s
view that the information carried by semantic pre-
dictors is largely correlated with that of lexico-
syntactical ones.

Further investigation on this issue would defi-
nitely be worthwhile, since several facts could ex-
plain these contradictory findings. First, it might be
that semantic and lexical predictors are correlated
because the methods used for the parameterization
of the semantic factors heavily relie on lexical infor-
mation. This is the case for the LSA, as well as for
the propositional approach of the content density.

Alternatively, this difference with other work in
L1 could be due to the L2 context. Chall and
Dale (1995) explained that the lexicon and the syn-
tax are more important for children learning to read
than for more advanced readers, who then become
more sensitive to organisationnal aspects. From the
threshold hypothesis (Alderson, 1984), we know
that before reaching a sufficient level of proficiency,
L2 learners struggle mostly with the lexicon and
the syntactic structures. This might explain why
lexico-syntactic predictors were so predominant in
our experiments. Some further experiments are thus
needed to investigate which of these facts better ac-

count for our findings on the semantic features.
A last avenue of research worth mentioning would

be to develop the family of specific-to-FFL predic-
tors, to determine whether taking into account the
impact of a given L1 language on the readability of
L2 texts would increase performance over a generic
model enough so that tuning efforts are worthwhile.
