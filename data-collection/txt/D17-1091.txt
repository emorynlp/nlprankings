Abstract

Question answering (QA) systems are sen-
sitive to the many different ways natural
language expresses the same information
need. In this paper we turn to paraphrases
as a means of capturing this knowledge
and present a general framework which
learns felicitous paraphrases for various
QA tasks. Our method is trained end-to-
end using question-answer pairs as a su-
pervision signal. A question and its para-
phrases serve as input to a neural scor-
ing model which assigns higher weights to
linguistic expressions most likely to yield
correct answers. We evaluate our approach
on QA over Freebase and answer sentence
selection. Experimental results on three
datasets show that our framework con-
sistently improves performance, achieving
competitive results despite the use of sim-
ple QA models.

1 Introduction

Enabling computers to automatically answer ques-
tions posed in natural language on any domain or
topic has been the focus of much research in re-
cent years. Question answering (QA) is challeng-
ing due to the many different ways natural lan-
guage expresses the same information need. As a
result, small variations in semantically equivalent
questions, may yield different answers. For exam-
ple, a hypothetical QA system must recognize that
the questions “who created microsoft” and “who
started microsoft” have the same meaning and that
they both convey the founder relation in order to
retrieve the correct answer from a knowledge base.

Given the great variety of surface forms for se-
mantically equivalent expressions, it should come
as no surprise that previous work has investigated

the use of paraphrases in relation to question an-
swering. There have been three main strands of
research. The first one applies paraphrasing to
match natural language and logical forms in the
context of semantic parsing. Berant and Liang
(2014) use a template-based method to heuristi-
cally generate canonical text descriptions for can-
didate logical forms, and then compute paraphrase
scores between the generated texts and input ques-
tions in order to rank the logical forms. Another
strand of work uses paraphrases in the context of
neural question answering models (Bordes et al.,
2014a,b; Dong et al., 2015). These models are typ-
ically trained on question-answer pairs, and em-
ploy question paraphrases in a multi-task learning
framework in an attempt to encourage the neural
networks to output similar vector representations
for the paraphrases.

The third strand of research uses paraphrases
more directly. The idea is to paraphrase the
question and then submit the rewritten version
to a QA module. Various resources have been
used to produce question paraphrases, such as
rule-based machine translation (Duboue and Chu-
Carroll, 2006), lexical and phrasal rules from the
Paraphrase Database (Narayan et al., 2016), as
well as rules mined from Wiktionary (Chen et al.,
2016) and large-scale paraphrase corpora (Fader
et al., 2013). A common problem with the gen-
erated paraphrases is that they often contain in-
appropriate candidates. Hence, treating all para-
phrases as equally felicitous and using them to an-
swer the question could degrade performance. To
remedy this, a scoring model is often employed,
however independently of the QA system used to
find the answer (Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006;
Narayan et al., 2016). Problematically, the sepa-
rate paraphrase models used in previous work do
not fully utilize the supervision signal from the
training data, and as such cannot be properly tuned

Figure 1: We use three different methods to generate candidate paraphrases for input q. The question and
its paraphrases are fed into a neural model which scores how suitable they are. The scores are normalized
and used to weight the results of the question answering model. The entire system is trained end-to-end
using question-answer pairs as a supervision signal.

to the question answering tasks at hand. Based
on the large variety of possible transformations
that can generate paraphrases, it seems likely that
the kinds of paraphrases that are useful would de-
pend on the QA application of interest (Bhagat
and Hovy, 2013). Fader et al. (2014) use features
that are defined over the original question and its
rewrites to score paraphrases. Examples include
the pointwise mutual information of the rewrite
rule, the paraphrase’s score according to a lan-
guage model, and POS tag features. In the context
of semantic parsing, Chen et al. (2016) also use
the ID of the rewrite rule as a feature. However,
most of these features are not informative enough
to model the quality of question paraphrases, or
cannot easily generalize to unseen rewrite rules.

In this paper, we present a general framework
for learning paraphrases for question answering
tasks. Given a natural language question, our
model estimates a probability distribution over
candidate answers. We first generate paraphrases
for the question, which can be obtained by one or
several paraphrasing systems. A neural scoring
model predicts the quality of the generated para-
phrases, while learning to assign higher weights
to those which are more likely to yield correct an-
swers. The paraphrases and the original question
are fed into a QA model that predicts a distribution
over answers given the question. The entire sys-
tem is trained end-to-end using question-answer
pairs as a supervision signal. The framework is
flexible, it does not rely on specific paraphrase or
QA models. In fact, this plug-and-play functional-

ity allows to learn specific paraphrases for differ-
ent QA tasks and to explore the merits of different
paraphrasing models for different applications.

We evaluate our approach on QA over Free-
base and text-based answer sentence selection. We
employ a range of paraphrase models based on
the Paraphrase Database (PPDB; Pavlick et al.
2015), neural machine translation (Mallinson
et al., 2016), and rules mined from the WikiAn-
swers corpus (Fader et al., 2014). Results on three
datasets show that our framework consistently im-
proves performance; it achieves state-of-the-art re-
sults on GraphQuestions and competitive perfor-
mance on two additional benchmark datasets us-
ing simple QA models.

2 Problem Formulation

Let q denote a natural language question, and a its
answer. Our aim is to estimate p (a|q), the condi-
tional probability of candidate answers given the
question. We decompose p (a|q) as:

p (a|q) =
∑

q′∈Hq∪{q}
pψ

Paraphrase Model

where Hq is the set of paraphrases for question q,
ψ are the parameters of a QA model, and θ are the
parameters of a paraphrase scoring model.

As shown in Figure 1, we first generate candi-
date paraphrases Hq for question q. Then, a neu-
ral scoring model predicts the quality of the gen-
erated paraphrases, and assigns higher weights to
the paraphrases which are more likely to obtain

the correct answers. These paraphrases and the
original question simultaneously serve as input to
a QA model that predicts a distribution over an-
swers for a given question. Finally, the results of
these two models are fused to predict the answer.
In the following we will explain how p (q′|q) and
p (a|q′) are estimated.

2.1 Paraphrase Generation

As shown in Equation (1), the term p (a|q) is
the sum over q and its paraphrases Hq. Ide-
ally, we would generate all the paraphrases of q.
However, since this set could quickly become in-
tractable, we restrict the number of candidate para-
phrases to a manageable size. In order to in-
crease the coverage and diversity of paraphrases,
we employ three methods based on: (1) lexical
and phrasal rules from the Paraphrase Database
(Pavlick et al., 2015); (2) neural machine trans-
lation models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau
et al., 2015); and (3) paraphrase rules mined from
clusters of related questions (Fader et al., 2014).
We briefly describe these models below, however,
there is nothing inherent in our framework that is
specific to these, any other paraphrase generator
could be used instead.

2.1.1 PPDB-based Generation
Bilingual pivoting (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005) is one of the most well-known approaches
to paraphrasing; it uses bilingual parallel corpora
to learn paraphrases based on techniques from
phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT,
Koehn et al. 2003). The intuition is that two
English strings that translate to the same foreign
string can be assumed to have the same meaning.
The method first extracts a bilingual phrase table
and then obtains English paraphrases by pivoting
through foreign language phrases.

Drawing inspiration from syntax-based SMT,
Callison-Burch (2008) and Ganitkevitch et al.
(2011) extended this idea to syntactic paraphrases,

generation. NMT1 (green) translates ques-
tion q into pivots g1 . . . gK which are then back-
translated by NMT2 (blue) where K decoders
jointly predict tokens at each time step, rather than
only conditioning on one pivot and independently
predicting outputs.

leading to the creation of PPDB (Ganitkevitch
et al., 2013), a large-scale paraphrase database
containing over a billion of paraphrase pairs in
24 different languages. Pavlick et al. (2015) fur-
ther used a supervised model to automatically la-
bel paraphrase pairs with entailment relationships
based on natural logic (MacCartney, 2009). In our
work, we employ bidirectionally entailing rules
from PPDB. Specifically, we focus on lexical (sin-
gle word) and phrasal (multiword) rules which we
use to paraphrase questions by replacing words
and phrases in them. An example is shown in
Table 1 where we substitute car with vehicle and
manufacturer with producer.

2.1.2 NMT-based Generation

Mallinson et al. (2016) revisit bilingual pivoting in
the context of neural machine translation (NMT,
Sutskever et al. 2014; Bahdanau et al. 2015) and
present a paraphrasing model based on neural net-
works. At its core, NMT is trained end-to-end to
maximize the conditional probability of a correct
translation given a source sentence, using a bilin-
gual corpus. Paraphrases can be obtained by trans-
lating an English string into a foreign language
and then back-translating it into English. NMT-
based pivoting models offer advantages over con-
ventional methods such as the ability to learn con-
tinuous representations and to consider wider con-
text while paraphrasing.

In our work, we select German as our pivot
following Mallinson et al. (2016) who show that
it outperforms other languages in a wide range
of paraphrasing experiments, and pretrain two
NMT systems, English-to-German (EN-DE) and

German-to-English (DE-EN). A naive implemen-
tation would translate a question to a German
string and then back-translate it to English. How-
ever, using only one pivot can lead to inaccu-
racies as it places too much faith on a single
translation which may be wrong. Instead, we
translate from multiple pivot sentences (Mallinson
et al., 2016). As shown in Figure 2, question q
is translated to K-best German pivots, Gq =
{g1, . . . , gK}. The probability of generating para-
phrase q′ = y1 . . . y|q′| is decomposed as:

p
(
q′|Gq

)
=
|q′|∏
t=1

p (yt|y<t,Gq)

=
|q′|∏
t=1

K∑
k=1

p (gk|q) p (yt|y<t, gk)
(2)

where y<t = y1, . . . , yt−1, and |q′| is the length
of q′. Probabilities p (gk|q) and p (yt|y<t, gk) are
computed by the EN-DE and DE-EN models, re-
spectively. We use beam search to decode tokens
by conditioning on multiple pivoting sentences.
The results with the best decoding scores are con-
sidered candidate paraphrases. Examples of NMT
paraphrases are shown in Table 1.

Compared to PPDB, NMT-based paraphrases
are syntax-agnostic, operating on the surface level
without knowledge of any underlying grammar.
Furthermore, paraphrase rules are captured im-
plicitly and cannot be easily extracted, e.g., from
a phrase table. As mentioned earlier, the NMT-
based approach has the potential of perform-
ing major rewrites as paraphrases are generated
while considering wider contextual information,
whereas PPDB paraphrases are more local, and
mainly handle lexical variation.

2.1.3 Rule-Based Generation
Our third paraphrase generation approach uses
rules mined from the WikiAnswers corpus (Fader
et al., 2014) which contains more than 30 mil-
lion question clusters labeled as paraphrases by

WikiAnswers1 users. This corpus is a large re-
source (the average cluster size is 25), but is rel-
atively noisy due to its collaborative nature – 45%
of question pairs are merely related rather than
genuine paraphrases. We therefore followed the
method proposed in (Fader et al., 2013) to har-
vest paraphrase rules from the corpus. We first ex-
tracted question templates (i.e., questions with at
most one wild-card) that appear in at least ten clus-
ters. Any two templates co-occurring (more than
five times) in the same cluster and with the same
arguments were deemed paraphrases. Table 2
shows examples of rules extracted from the cor-
pus. During paraphrase generation, we consider
substrings of the input question as arguments, and
match them with the mined template pairs. For ex-
ample, the stemmed input question in Table 1 can
be paraphrased using the rules (“what be the zip
code of ”, “what be ’s postal code”) and (“what
be the zip code of ”, “zip code of ”). If no ex-
act match is found, we perform fuzzy matching by
ignoring stop words in the question and templates.

2.2 Paraphrase Scoring

Recall from Equation (1) that pθ (q′|q) scores the
generated paraphrases q′ ∈ Hq ∪ {q}. We esti-
mate pθ (q′|q) using neural networks given their
successful application to paraphrase identification
tasks (Socher et al., 2011; Yin and Schütze, 2015;
He et al., 2015). Specifically, the input ques-
tion and its paraphrases are encoded as vectors.
Then, we employ a neural network to obtain the
score s (q′|q) which after normalization becomes
the probability pθ (q′|q).

Encoding Let q = q1 . . . q|q| denote an input
question. Every word is initially mapped to a
d-dimensional vector. In other words, vector qt
is computed via qt = Wqe (qt), where Wq ∈
Rd×|V| is a word embedding matrix, |V| is the
vocabulary size, and e (qt) is a one-hot vector.
Next, we use a bi-directional recurrent neural net-
work with long short-term memory units (LSTM,
Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) as the ques-
tion encoder, which is shared by the input ques-
tions and their paraphrases. The encoder recur-
sively processes tokens one by one, and uses the
encoded vectors to represent questions. We com-
pute the hidden vectors at the t-th time step via:

The representation of q is obtained by:

(4)

where [·, ·] denotes concatenation, and q ∈ R2n.
Scoring After obtaining vector representations
for q and q′, we compute the score s (q′|q) via:

s
(
q′|q) = ws · [q,q′,q� q′]+ bs (5)

where ws ∈ R6n is a parameter vector, [·, ·, ·] de-
notes concatenation, � is element-wise multipli-
cation, and bs is the bias. Alternative ways to com-
pute s (q′|q) such as dot product or with a bilinear
term were not empirically better than Equation (5)
and we omit them from further discussion.

Normalization For paraphrases q′ ∈ Hq ∪ {q},
the probability pθ (q′|q) is computed via:

pθ
(
q′|q) = exp{s (q′|q)}∑

r∈Hq∪{q} exp{s (r|q)}
(6)

where the paraphrase scores are normalized over
the set Hq ∪ {q}.
2.3 QA Models
The framework defined in Equation (1) is rela-
tively flexible with respect to the QA model being
employed as long as it can predict pψ (a|q′). We il-
lustrate this by performing experiments across dif-
ferent tasks and describe below the models used
for these tasks.

Knowledge Base QA In our first task we use
the Freebase knowledge base to answer questions.
Query graphs for the questions typically contain
more than one predicate. For example, to answer
the question “who is the ceo of microsoft in 2008”,
we need to use one relation to query “ceo of mi-
crosoft” and another relation for the constraint “in
2008”. For this task, we employ the SIMPLE-
GRAPH model described in Reddy et al. (2016,
2017), and follow their training protocol and fea-
ture design. In brief, their method uses rules to

convert questions to ungrounded logical forms,
which are subsequently matched against Freebase
subgraphs. The QA model learns from question-
answer pairs: it extracts features for pairs of ques-
tions and Freebase subgraphs, and uses a logistic
regression classifier to predict the probability that
a candidate answer is correct. We perform entity
linking using the Freebasee/KG API on the origi-
nal question (Reddy et al., 2016, 2017), and gener-
ate candidate Freebase subgraphs. The QA model
estimates how likely it is for a subgraph to yield
the correct answer.

Answer Sentence Selection Given a question
and a collection of relevant sentences, the goal
of this task is to select sentences which contain
an answer to the question. The assumption is
that correct answer sentences have high semantic
similarity to the questions (Yu et al., 2014; Yang
et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2016). We use two bi-
directional recurrent neural networks (BILSTM)
to separately encode questions and answer sen-
tences to vectors (Equation (4)). Similarity scores
are computed as shown in Equation (5), and then
squashed to (0, 1) by a sigmoid function in order
to predict pψ (a|q′).
2.4 Training and Inference

We use a log-likelihood objective for training,
which maximizes the likelihood of the correct an-
swer given a question:

maximize
∑

(q,a)∈D
log p (a|q) (7)

where D is the set of all question-answer training
pairs, and p (a|q) is computed as shown in Equa-
tion (1). For the knowledge base QA task, we pre-
dict how likely it is that a subgraph obtains the
correct answer, and the answers of some candidate
subgraphs are partially correct. So, we use the
binary cross entropy between the candidate sub-
graph’s F1 score and the prediction as the objec-
tive function. The RMSProp algorithm (Tieleman
and Hinton, 2012) is employed to solve this non-
convex optimization problem. Moreover, dropout
is used for regularizing the recurrent neural net-
works (Pham et al., 2014).

At test time, we generate paraphrases for the
question q, and then predict the answer by:

â = arg max
a′∈Cq

p
(
a′|q) (8)

879



where Cq is the set of candidate answers,
and p (a′|q) is computed as shown in Equation (1).
3 Experiments

We compared our model which we call PARA4QA
(as shorthand for learning to paraphrase for ques-
tion answering) against multiple previous systems
on three datasets. In the following we introduce
these datasets, provide implementation details for
our model, describe the systems used for compar-
ison, and present our results.

3.1 Datasets
Our model was trained on three datasets, repre-
sentative of different types of QA tasks. The first
two datasets focus on question answering over a
structured knowledge base, whereas the third one
is specific to answer sentence selection.

WEBQUESTIONS This dataset (Berant et al.,
2013) contains 3, 778 training instances and
2, 032 test instances. Questions were collected by
querying the Google Suggest API. A breadth-first
search beginning with wh- was conducted and the
answers were crowd-sourced using Freebase as the
backend knowledge base.

GRAPHQUESTIONS The dataset (Su et al.,
2016) contains 5, 166 question-answer pairs
(evenly split into a training and a test set). It was
created by asking crowd workers to paraphrase
500 Freebase graph queries in natural language.

WIKIQA This dataset (Yang et al., 2015) has
3, 047 questions sampled from Bing query logs.
The questions are associated with 29, 258 candi-
date answer sentences, 1, 473 of which contain the
correct answers to the questions.

3.2 Implementation Details
Paraphrase Generation Candidate paraphrases
were stemmed (Minnen et al., 2001) and lower-
cased. We discarded duplicate or trivial para-
phrases which only rewrite stop words or punc-
tuation. For the NMT model, we followed the im-
plementation2 and settings described in Mallinson
et al. (2016), and used English↔German as the
language pair. The system was trained on data
released as part of the WMT15 shared transla-
tion task (4.2 million sentence pairs). We also
had access to back-translated monolingual train-
ing data (Sennrich et al., 2016a). Rare words were

2github.com/sebastien-j/LV_groundhog

split into subword units (Sennrich et al., 2016b) to
handle out-of-vocabulary words in questions. We
used the top 15 decoding results as candidate para-
phrases. We used the S size package of PPDB
2.0 (Pavlick et al., 2015) for high precision. At
most 10 candidate paraphrases were considered.
We mined paraphrase rules from WikiAnswers
(Fader et al., 2014) as described in Section 2.1.3.
The extracted rules were ranked using the point-
wise mutual information between template pairs
in the WikiAnswers corpus. The top 10 candidate
paraphrases were used.

Training For the paraphrase scoring model, we
used GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) vectors3 pre-
trained on Wikipedia 2014 and Gigaword 5 to ini-
tialize the word embedding matrix. We kept this
matrix fixed across datasets. Out-of-vocabulary
words were replaced with a special unknown sym-
bol. We also augmented questions with start-of-
and end-of-sequence symbols. Word vectors for
these special symbols were updated during train-
ing. Model hyperparameters were validated on
the development set. The dimensions of hid-
den vectors and word embeddings were selected
from {50, 100, 200} and {100, 200}, respectively.
The dropout rate was selected from {0.2, 0.3, 0.4}.
The BILSTM for the answer sentence selection
QA model used the same hyperparameters. Pa-
rameters were randomly initialized from a uniform
distribution U (−0.08, 0.08). The learning rate
and decay rate of RMSProp were 0.01 and 0.95,
respectively. The batch size was set to 150. To
alleviate the exploding gradient problem (Pascanu
et al., 2013), the gradient norm was clipped to 5.
Early stopping was used to determine the number
of epochs.

3.3 Paraphrase Statistics
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics on the para-
phrases generated by the various systems across
datasets (training set). As can be seen, the av-
erage paraphrase length is similar to the average
length of the original questions. The NMT method
generates more paraphrases and has wider cover-
age, while the average number and coverage of the
other two methods varies per dataset. As a way
of quantifying the extent to which rewriting takes
place, we report BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and
TER (Snover et al., 2006) scores between the orig-
inal questions and their paraphrases. The NMT

3.4 Comparison Systems

We compared our framework to previous work
and several ablation models which either do not
use paraphrases or paraphrase scoring, or are not
jointly trained.

The first baseline only uses the base QA mod-
els described in Section 2.3 (SIMPLEGRAPH and
BILSTM). The second baseline (AVGPARA) does
not take advantage of paraphrase scoring. The
paraphrases for a given question are used while the
QA model’s results are directly averaged to predict
the answers. The third baseline (DATAAUGMENT)
employs paraphrases for data augmentation dur-
ing training. Specifically, we use the question, its
paraphrases, and the correct answer to automati-
cally generate new training samples.

In the fourth baseline (SEPPARA), the para-
phrase scoring model is separately trained on para-
phrase classification data, without taking question-
answer pairs into account. In the experiments,
we used the Quora question paraphrase dataset4

which contains question pairs and labels indicat-
ing whether they constitute paraphrases or not. We
removed questions with more than 25 tokens and
sub-sampled to balance the dataset. We used 90%
of the resulting 275K examples for training, and
the remaining for development. The paraphrase
score s (q′|q) (Equation (5)) was wrapped by a
sigmoid function to predict the probability of a
question pair being a paraphrase. A binary cross-
entropy loss was used as the objective. The classi-
fication accuracy on the dev set was 80.6%.

3.5 Results

We first discuss the performance of PARA4QA on
GRAPHQUESTIONS and WEBQUESTIONS. The
first block in Table 4 shows a variety of systems
previously described in the literature using aver-
age F1 as the evaluation metric (Berant et al.,
2013). Among these, PARASEMP, SUBGRAPH,
MCCNN, and BILAYERED utilize paraphrasing
resources. The second block compares PARA4QA
against various related baselines (see Section 3.4).
SIMPLEGRAPH results on WEBQUESTIONS and
GRAPHQUESTIONS are taken from Reddy et al.
(2016) and Reddy et al. (2017), respectively.

Overall, we observe that PARA4QA outper-
forms baselines which either do not employ para-
phrases (SIMPLEGRAPH) or paraphrase scoring
(AVGPARA, DATAAUGMENT), or are not jointly
trained (SEPPARA). On GRAPHQUESTIONS, our
model PARA4QA outperforms the previous state
of the art by a wide margin. Ablation experiments

show that performance drops most when the NMT
paraphrases are not used on GRAPHQUESTIONS,
whereas on WEBQUESTIONS removal of the rule-
based generator hurts performance most. One rea-
son is that the rule-based method has higher cov-
erage on WEBQUESTIONS than on GRAPHQUES-
TIONS (see Table 3).

Results on WIKIQA are shown in Table 5. We
report MAP and MMR which evaluate the rela-
tive ranks of correct answers among the candi-
date sentences for a question. Again, we observe
that PARA4QA outperforms related baselines (see
BILSTM, DATAAUGMENT, AVGPARA, and SEP-
PARA). Ablation experiments show that perfor-
mance drops most when NMT paraphrases are re-
moved. When word matching features are used
(see +CNT in the third block), PARA4QA reaches
state of the art performance.

Examples of paraphrases and their probabil-
ities pθ (q′|q) (see Equation (6)) learned by
PARA4QA are shown in Table 6. The two ex-
amples are taken from the development set of
GRAPHQUESTIONS and WEBQUESTIONS, re-
spectively. We also show the Freebase relations
used to query the correct answers. In the first ex-
ample, the original question cannot yield the cor-
rect answer because of the mismatch between the
question and the knowledge base. The paraphrase
contains “role” in place of “sort of part”, increas-
ing the chance of overlap between the question and

the predicate words. The second question contains
an informal expression “play 4”, which confuses
the QA model. The paraphrase model generates
“play for” and predicts a high paraphrase score
for it. More generally, we observe that the model
tends to give higher probabilities pθ (q′|q) to para-
phrases biased towards delivering appropriate an-
swers.

We also analyzed which structures were mostly
paraphrased within a question. We manually in-
spected 50 (randomly sampled) questions from
the development portion of each dataset, and their
three top scoring paraphrases (Equation (5)). We
grouped the most commonly paraphrased struc-
tures into the following categories: a) question
words, i.e., wh-words and and “how”; b) ques-
tion focus structures, i.e., cue words or cue phrases
for an answer with a specific entity type (Yao and
Van Durme, 2014); c) verbs or noun phrases in-
dicating the relation between the question topic
entity and the answer; and d) structures requir-
ing aggregation or imposing additional constraints
the answer must satisfy (Yih et al., 2015). In the
example “which year did Avatar release in UK”,
the question word is “which”, the question focus
is “year”, the verb is “release”, and “in UK” con-
strains the answer to a specific location.

Figure 3 shows the degree to which different
types of structures are paraphrased. As can be
seen, most rewrites affect Relation Verb, espe-
cially on WEBQUESTIONS. Question Focus, Re-
lation NP, and Constraint & Aggregation are more

often rewritten in GRAPHQUESTIONS compared
to the other datasets.

Finally, we examined how our method fares on
simple versus complex questions. We performed
this analysis on GRAPHQUESTIONS as it contains
a larger proportion of complex questions. We con-
sider questions that contain a single relation as
simple. Complex questions have multiple rela-
tions or require aggregation. Table 7 shows how
our model performs in each group. We observe
improvements for both types of questions, with
the impact on simple questions being more pro-
nounced. This is not entirely surprising as it is eas-
ier to generate paraphrases and predict the para-
phrase scores for simpler questions.

4 Conclusions

In this work we proposed a general framework
for learning paraphrases for question answering.
Paraphrase scoring and QA models are trained
end-to-end on question-answer pairs, which re-
sults in learning paraphrases with a purpose. The
framework is not tied to a specific paraphrase gen-
erator or QA system. In fact it allows to in-
corporate several paraphrasing modules, and can
serve as a testbed for exploring their coverage
and rewriting capabilities. Experimental results

on three datasets show that our method improves
performance across tasks. There are several direc-
tions for future work. The framework can be used
for other natural language processing tasks which
are sensitive to the variation of input (e.g., tex-
tual entailment or summarization). We would also
like to explore more advanced paraphrase scoring
models (Parikh et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016)
as well as additional paraphrase generators since
improvements in the diversity and the quality of
paraphrases could also enhance QA performance.
