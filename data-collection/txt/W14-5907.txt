Abstract

Currently 19%-28% of Internet users participate in online health discussions. In this work, we 
study sentiments expressed on online medical forums. As well as considering the predominant 
sentiments expressed in individual posts, we analyze sequences of sentiments in online discus-
sions. Individual posts are classified into one of the five categories encouragement, gratitude, 
confusion, facts, and endorsement. 1438 messages from 130 threads were annotated manually 
by two annotators with a strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss kappa = 0.737 and 0.763 for 
posts in sequence and separate posts respectively). The annotated posts were used to analyse 
sentiments in consecutive posts. In automated sentiment classification, we applied HealthAf-
fect, a domain-specific lexicon of affective words.

1 Introduction

      Development of effective health care policies relies on the understanding of opinions expressed by 
the general public on major health issues.  Successful vaccination during pandemics and the incorpora-
tion of healthy choices in everyday life style are examples of policies that require such understanding. 
As online media becomes the main medium for the posting and exchange of information, analysis of 
this online data can contribute to studies of the general public’s opinions on health-related matters.  
Currently 19%-28% of Internet users participate in online health discussions (Balicco and Paganelli, 
2011). Analysis of the information posted online contributes to effectiveness of decisions on public 
health (Paul and Drezde, 2011; Chee et al., 2009).  
Our interest concentrates on sequences of sentiments in the forum discourse. It has been shown that 
sentiments expressed by a forum participant affect sentiments in messages written by other partici-
pants posted on the same discussion thread (Zafarani et al., 2010). Shared online emotions can im-
prove personal well-being and empower patients in their battle against an illness (Malik and Coulson, 
2010).  We aimed to identify the most common sentiment pairs and triads and to observe their interac-
tions. We applied our analysis to data gathered from the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) medical forum.1

Below is an example of four consecutive messages from an embryo transfer discussion: 
Alice: Jane - whats going on??
Jane: We have our appt. Wednesday!! EEE!!!   
Beth: Good luck on your transfer! Grow embies grow!!!!
Jane: The transfer went well - my RE did it himself which was comforting. 2 embies (grade 1 but slow in devel-
opment) so I am not holding my breath for a positive. This really was my worst cycle yet!!
In automated recognition of sentiments, we use HealthAffect, a domain-specific affective lexicon.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work in sentiment analysis, Section 3 
introduces the data set and the annotation results, Section 4 presents HealthAffect, Section 5 describes
the automated sentiment recognition experiments, and Section 6 discusses the results.

2 Related Work

The availability of emotion-rich text has helped to promote studies of sentiments from a boutique sci-
ence into the mainstream of Text Data Mining (TDM). The “sentiment analysis” query on Google 
Scholar returns about 16,800 hits in scholarly publications appearing since 2010.  Sentiment analysis 
often connects its subjects with specific online media (e.g., sentiments on consumer goods are studied 
on Amazon.com).  Health-related emotions are studied on Twitter (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; 
Bobicev et al, 2012) and online public forums (Malik and Coulson, 2010; Goeuriot et al, 2012).   

Reliable annotation is essential for a thorough analysis of text. Multiple annotations of topic-
specific opinions in blogs were evaluated in Osman et al. (2010). Sokolova and Bobicev (2013) evalu-
ated annotation agreement achieved on messages gathered from a medical forum. Bobicev et al. 
(2012) used multiple annotators to categorize tweets into positive, negative and neutral tweets. Merits 
of reader-centric and author-centric annotation models were discussed in (Balahur, Steinberger, 2009). 
In this work, we apply the reader-centric annotation model. We use Fleiss Kappa (Nichols et al, 2010)
to evaluate inter-annotator agreement. 
     An accurate sentiment classification relies on electronic sources of semantic information.  In 
(Sokolova and Bobicev, 2013; Goeuriot et al, 2011), the authors showed that the sentiment categories
of SentiWordNet2, WordNetAffect3 and the Subjectivity lexicon4 are not fully representative of health-
related emotions. In the current work, we use HealthAffect, a domain-specific lexicon, to automatical-
ly classify sentiments.  The lexicon has been introduced in (Sokolova and Bobicev, 2013).
Although there is a correlation between emotions expressed in consecutive posts (Chmiel et al, 2011; 
Tan et al, 2011; Hassan et al, 2012),  so far health-related sentiment classification has focused on indi-
vidual messages. Our current work goes beyond individual messages and studies sequences of senti-
ments in consecutive posts.

3 The IVF Data and Annotation Results

We worked with online messages posted on a medical forum. The forum communication model pro-
motes messages which disclose the emotional state of the authors.  We gathered data from the In Vitro 
Fertilization (IVF) website dedicated to reproductive technologies, a hotly debated issue in the modern 
society. Among the IVF six sub-forums, we selected the IVF Ages 35+ sub-forum5  as it contained a 
manageable number of topics and messages, i.e., 510 topics and 16388 messages, where the messages 
had 128 words on average 6. All topics were initiated by the forum participants. Among those, 340 top-
ics contained < 10 posts. These short topics often contained one initial request and a couple of replies 
and were deemed too short to form a good discussion. We also excluded topics containing > 20 posts.  
This exclusion left 80 topics with an average of 17 messages per topic for a manual analysis by two 
annotators. First, we used 292 random posts to verify whether the messages were self-evident for sen-
timent annotation or required an additional context.  The annotators reported that posts were long 
enough to convey emotions and in most cases there was no need for a wider context. We applied an 
annotation scheme which was successfully applied in (Sokolova and Bobicev, 2013). 

We started with 35 sentiment types found by annotators and generalized them into three groups: 

 confusion, which included worry, concern, doubt, impatience, uncertainty, sadness, anger, 
embarrassment, hopelessness, dissatisfaction, and dislike;

 encouragement, which included cheering, support, hope, happiness, enthusiasm, excitement, 
optimism;

 gratitude, which included thankfulness.

A special group of sentiments was presented by expressions of compassion, sorrow, and pity. Ac-
cording to the WordNetAffect classification, these sentiments should be considered negative. However,

in the context of health discussions, these emotional expressions appeared in conjunction with moral 
support and encouragement. Hence, we treated them as a part of encouragement.  Posts presenting on-
ly factual information were marked as facts. Some posts contained factual information and strong
emotional expressions; those expressions almost always conveyed encouragement (“hope, this helps”, 
“I wish you all the best”, “good luck”). Such posts were labeled endorsement. Note that the final cate-
gories did not manifest negative sentiments. In lieu of negative sentiments, we considered confusion
as a non-positive label. Encouragement and gratitude were considered positive labels, facts and en-
dorsement - neutral. It should be mentioned that the posts were usually long enough to express several 
sentiments. However, annotators were requested to mark messages with one sentiment category.

The posts that both annotators labelled with the same label were assigned to this category; 1256 
posts were assigned with a class label.  The posts labelled with two different sentiment labels were 
marked as ambiguous; 182 posts were marked as ambiguous.

Despite the challenging data, we obtained Fleiss Kappa = 0.737 which indicated a strong agreement 
between annotators (Osman et al, 2010). This value was obtained on 80 annotated topics. Agreement 
for the randomly extracted posts was calculated separately in order to verify whether annotation of 
separate posts was no more difficult than annotation of the post sequences. Contrary to our expecta-
tions, the obtained Fleiss Kappa = 0.763 was slightly higher than on the posts in discussions.  The final 
distribution of posts among sentiment classes is presented in Table 2. 

Classification category Num of posts Per-cent
Facts 494 34.4%
Encouragement 333 23.2%
Endorsement 166 11.5%
Confusion 146 10.2%
Gratitude 131 9.1%
Ambiguous 168 11.7%
Total 1438 100%

Table 2:  Class distribution of the IVF posts.

We computed the distribution of sentiment pairs and triads in consecutive posts. We found that the 
most frequent sequences consisted mostly of facts and/or encouragement: 39.5% in total. Confusion
was far less frequent and was followed by facts and encouragement in 80% of cases.  That sentiment 
transition shows a high level of support among the forum participants.  Approximately 10% of senti-
ment pairs are factual and/or encouragement followed by gratitude. Other less frequent sequences ap-
pear when a new participant added her post in the flow. Tables 3 and 4 list the results.

Sentiment pairs Occurrence Percent
facts,   facts 170 19.5%
encouragement, encouragement 119 13.7%
facts, encouragement 55 6.3%
endorsement,  facts 53 6.1%
encouragement, facts 44 5.1%

4 HealthAffect

General affective lexicons were shown to be ineffective in sentiment classification of health related 
messages.  To build a domain-specific lexicon, named HealthAffect, we adapted the Pointwise Mutual 
Information (PMI) approach (Turney, 2002). The initial candidates consisted of unigrams, bigrams 
and trigrams of words with frequency ≥ 5 appearing in unambiguously annotated posts (i.e., we omit-
ted posts marked as uncertain). For each class and each candidate, we calculated PMI(candidate, 
class) as 

PMI(candidate, class) = log2( p(candidate in class)/( p(candidate) p(class))).

Next, we calculated Semantic Orientation (SO) for each candidate and for each class as

SO (candidate, class) = PMI(candidate, class)
- Σ PMI(candidate, other_classes)

where other_classes include all the classes except the class that Semantic Orientation is calculated for.
After all the possible SO were computed, each HealthAffect candidate was assigned with the class that 
corresponded to its maximum SO.   

Domain-specific lexicons can be prone to data over-fitting (since, for example, they might contain 
personal and brand names).  To avoid the over-fitting pitfall, we manually reviewed and filtered out 
non-relevant elements, such as personal and brand names, geolocations, dates, stop-words and their 
combinations (since_then, that_was_the, to_do_it, so_you). Table 5 presents the lexicon profile.   Note 
that we do not report the endorsement profile as it combines facts and encouragement.

5 Sentiment Recognition

Our task was to assess HealthAffect’s ability to recognise sentiments of health-related messages. We 
used the sentiment categories described in Section 3.  In the experiments, we represented the messages 
by the HealthAffect terms. There were 1200 distinct terms, and each term was assigned to one senti-
ment. 

Our algorithm was straightforward: it calculated the number of HealthAffect terms from each cat-
egory in the post and classified the post in the category for which the maximal number of terms was 
found. Table 5 demonstrates that the number of terms was quite different for each category. Hence, the 
algorithm tended to attribute posts to the classes with a larger numbers of terms. To overcome the bias, 
we normalised the number of the terms in the post by the total number of terms for each category.   
The algorithm’s performance was evaluated through two multiclass classification results: 

47



 4-class classification where all 1269 unambiguous posts are classified into (encouragement, 
gratitude, confusion, and neutral, i.e., facts and endorsement), and 

 3-class classification (positive: encouragement, gratitude; negative: confusion, neutral: facts
and endorsement).

We computed micro- and macro-average Precision (Pr), Recall (R) and F-score (F) (Table 6).  

Metrics 4-class classification 3-class classification
microaverage F-score 0.633 0.672
macroaverage Precision 0.593 0.625
macroaverage Recall 0.686 0.679
macroaverage F-score 0.636 0.651

Table 6: Results of 4-class and 3-class classification.

For additional assessment of HealthAffect, we ran simple Machine Learning experiments using Naïve 
Bayes and representing the texts through the lexicon terms. The obtained results of F-score=0.44, Pre-
cision=0.49, Recall=0.47 supported our decision to use HealthAffect in the straight-forward manner as 
presented above.  For each sentiment class, our results were as follows:

 The most accurate classification occurred for gratitude. It was correctly classified in 83.6% of 
its occurrences.  It was most commonly misclassified as encouragement (9.7%). Posts classi-
fied as gratitude are mostly the shortest ones containing only some words of gratitude and ap-
preciation of others’ help. As they usually do not contain any more information than this, there 
were fewer chances for them to be misclassified. 

 The second most accurate result was achieved for encouragement. It was correctly classified 
in 76.7% of cases. It was misclassified as neutral (9.8%) because the latter posts contained 
some encouraging with the purpose of cheering up the interlocutor.

 The least often correctly classified class was neutral (50.8%). One possible explanation is the 
presence of the sentiment bearing words in the description of facts in a post which is in gen-
eral objective and which was marked as factual by the annotators.

Recall from Section 3, that we consider encouragement and gratitude to be positive sentiments and 
confusion to be a negative one. The reported results show that positive sentiments were most misclas-
sified within the same group or with neutral, e.g., encouragement was misclassified more as neutral or 
gratitude than as confusion, gratitude - more as encouragement or neutral than as confusion. On the 
other hand, confusion and negative sentiments were most often misclassified as neutral.

6 Discussion and Future Work

We have presented results of sentiment recognition in messages posted on a medical forum. Sentiment 
analysis of online medical discussions differs considerably from polarity studies of consumer-written 
product reviews, financial blogs and political discussions. While in many cases positive and negative 
sentiment categories are powerful enough, such a dichotomy is not sufficient for medical forums. We 
formulate our medical sentiment analysis as a multi-class classification problem in which posts were 
classified into encouragement, gratitude, confusion, facts and endorsement. 

In spite of sentiment annotation being highly subjective, we obtained a strong inter-annotator 
agreement between two independent annotators (i.e., Fleiss Kappa = 0.73 for posts in discussions and 
Fleiss Kappa = 0.76 for separate posts). The Kappa values demonstrated an adequate selection of clas-
ses of sentiments and appropriate annotation guidelines. However, many posts contained more than 
one sentiment in most cases mixed with some factual information. The possible solutions in this case 
would be (a) to allow multiple annotations for each post; (b) to annotate every sentence of the posts.

A specific set of sentiments on the IVF forum did not support the use of general affective lexicons 
in automated sentiment recognition.  Instead we applied the PMI approach to build a domain-specific 
lexicon HealthAffect and then manually reviewed and generalized it.

In our current work we went beyond analysis of individual messages: we analyzed their sequences 
in order to reveal patterns of sentiment interaction. Manual analysis of a sample of data showed that 
topics contained a coherent discourse. Some unexpected shifts in the discourse flow were introduced 
by a new participant joining the discussion. In future work, we may include the post’s author infor-
mation in the sentiment interaction analysis. The information is also important for analysis of influ-
ence, when one participant is answering directly to another one citing in many cases the post which 
she answered to. 

We plan to use the results obtained in this study for analysis of discussions related to other highly 
debated health care policies.  One future possibility is to construct a Markov model for the sentiment 
sequences. However, in any online discussion there are random shifts and alternations in discourse 
which complicate application of the Markov model. 

In the future, we aim to annotate more text, enhance and refine HealthAffect, and use it to achieve 
reliable automated sentiment recognition across a spectrum of health-related issues.
