Abstract

We present the Trip-MAML dataset, a
Multi-Lingual dataset of hotel reviews
that have been manually annotated at the
sentence-level with Multi-Aspect senti-
ment labels. This dataset has been built
as an extension of an existent English-only
dataset, adding documents written in Ital-
ian and Spanish. We detail the dataset
construction process, covering the data
gathering, selection, and annotation. We
present inter-annotator agreement figures
and baseline experimental results, compar-
ing the three languages. Trip-MAML is
a multi-lingual dataset for aspect-oriented
opinion mining that enables researchers (i)
to face the problem on languages other
than English and (ii) to the experiment the
application of cross-lingual learning meth-
ods to the task.

1 Introduction

Reviews of products and services that are sponta-
neously produced by customers represent a source
of unquestionable value not only for marketing
strategies of private companies and organizations,
but also for other users since their purchasing de-
cisions are likely influenced by other customers’
opinions (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006).

Overall ratings (e.g., in terms of a five stars rat-
ing scale), and also aspect-specific ratings (e.g.,
the Cleanliness or Location of a hotel), are the typi-
cal additional information expressed by customers
in their reviews. Those ratings help to derive a
number of global scores to facilitate a first screen-
ing of the product or service at hand. Notwith-
standing, users who pay more attention to a par-
ticular aspect (e.g., the Rooms of a hotel) remain

constrained to manually inspect the entire text
of reviews in order to find out the reasons other
users argued in that respect. Methods for au-
tomatic analysis of the aspect-oriented sentiment
expressed in reviews would enable highlighting
aspect-relevant parts of the document, so as to al-
low users to perform a faster and focused inspec-
tion of them.

Previous work on opinion mining (Pang and
Lee, 2008) has already faced the overall sentiment
prediction (Pang et al., 2002), multiple aspect-
oriented analysis (Hu and Liu, 2004), and fine-
grained phrase-level analysis (Wilson et al., 2009).
Most of the available opinion mining datasets con-
tain only documents written in English, as this lan-
guage is the most used on the Internet and the one
for which more NLP tools and resources are avail-
able. (Hu and Liu, 2004) worked on the summa-
rization of reviews by means of weakly supervised
feature mining. (Täckström and McDonald, 2011)
used a finer-grained dataset in which global po-
larity annotation is applied also to each sentence
composing the document. Similarly did (Socher
et al., 2013) with the Stanford Sentiment Tree-
bank, which annotates each syntactically plausi-
ble phrase in thousands of sentences using anno-
tators from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, annotat-
ing the polarity of phrases on a five-level scale.
(Lazaridou et al., 2013) performed a single-label
polarity annotation of elementary discourse units
of TripAdvisor reviews, adopting ten aspect labels.
(Marcheggiani et al., 2014) did a similar annota-
tion work, using sentences as the annotation ele-
ments and adopting a multi-label polarity annota-
tion, i.e., each sentence can be assigned to zero,
one, or more than one aspect.

Cross-lingual sentiment classification (Wan,
2009; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2011) explores the
scenario in which training data are available for

2533



a language that is different from the language of
the test documents. Cross-lingual learning meth-
ods have important practical applications, since
they allow to build classifiers for many languages
reusing the training data produced for a single lan-
guage (typically English), probably giving up a bit
of accuracy, but compensating it with a large save
in terms of human annotation costs.

Multi-lingual datasets are beneficial to the re-
search community both as a benchmark to ex-
plore cross-lingual learning and also as resources
on which to develop and test new NLP tools for
languages other than English. Prettenhofer and
Stein (2010) used a multi-lingual dataset focused
on full-document classification at the global po-
larity level. Denecke (2008) used a dataset of 200
Amazon reviews in German to test cross-lingual
document polarity classification using an English
training set. Klinger and Cimiano (2014) pro-
duced a bi-lingual dataset (English and German),
named USAGE, in which aspect expressions and
subjective expressions are annotated in Amazon
product reviews. In (Klinger and Cimiano, 2014)
aspect expressions can be any piece of text that
mentions a relevant property of the reviewed en-
tity (e.g., washer, hose, looks) and are not categor-
ical label, as in our dataset. The USAGE dataset is
thus more oriented at information extraction rather
than at text classification applications. Banea et al.
(2010) used machine translation to create a multi-
lingual version of the information-extraction ori-
ented MPQA dataset (Wiebe et al., 2005) on six
languages (English, Arabic, French, German, Ro-
manian and Spanish).

In this paper we present Trip-MAML, which
extends the Trip-MA1 dataset of Marcheggiani et
al. (2014) with Italian and Spanish annotated re-
views. We describe Trip-MAML and report ex-
periments aimed at defining a first baseline. Both
the dataset and the software used in experiments
are publicly available at http://hlt.isti.
cnr.it/trip-maml/.

2 Annotation Process

We recall the annotation process adopted by
Marcheggiani et al. (2014) for Trip-MA and the
procedure we employed to extend it into Trip-
MAML. We will use the national codes EN, ES,

1Marcheggiani et al. (2014) gave no name to their dataset,
here we name it Trip-MA to identify its source and its multi-
aspect nature.

and IT, to denote the English, Spanish, and Ital-
ian parts of the Trip-MAML dataset, respectively.
Note that EN coincides with Trip-MA.

2.1 English Reviews

The Trip-MA dataset was created by Marcheg-
giani et al. (2014) by annotating a set of 442
reviews, written in English, randomly sampled
from the publicly available TripAdvisor dataset of
Wang et al. (2010), composed by 235,793 reviews.
Each review comes with an overall rating on a dis-
crete ordinal scale from 1 to 5 “stars”. The dataset
was annotated according to 9 recurrent aspects fre-
quently involved in hotel reviews: Rooms, Clean-
liness, Value, Service, Location, Check-in, Business,
Food, and Building. The last two are not officially
rated by TripAdvisor but were added because they
are frequently commented in reviews. Two “catch-
all” aspects, Other and NotRelated, were also added,
for a total of 11 aspect. Aspect Other denotes
opinions that are pertinent to the hotel being re-
viewed, but not relevant to any of the former nine
aspects (e.g., generic evaluations like Pulitzer ex-
ceeded our expectations). Aspect NotRelated de-
notes opinions that are not related to the hotel
(e.g., Tour Eiffel is amazing).

If a sentence is relevant to an aspect, the possi-
ble sentiment label values are three: Positive, Neg-
ative, and Neutral/Mixed2. Neutral/Mixed annotates
subjective evaluations that are not clearly polar-
ized (e.g., The hotel was fine with some excep-
tions).

2.1.1 Annotation protocol

Marcheggiani et al. (2014) relied on three human
annotators to annotate each sentence of the 442 re-
views with respect to polarities of opinions that are
relevant to any of the 11 aspects. 73 reviews, out
of 442, were independently annotated by all the
annotators in order to measure the inter-annotator
agreement, while the remaining 369 reviews were
partitioned into 3 equally-sized sets, one for each
annotator. Bias in the estimation of inter-annotator
agreement was minimized by sorting the list of re-
views of each annotator so that every eighth re-
view was common to all annotators; this ensured
that each annotator had the same amount of coding
experience when labeling the same shared review.

2Marcheggiani et al. (2014) initially distinguished be-
tween implicit and explicit opinions but the human agreement
was so low they removed this distinction from the schema.

tences with at least one opinion annotation.

2.2 Spanish and Italian Reviews

For the creation of ES and IT parts of the Trip-
MAML dataset we followed the same annotation
protocol of Marcheggiani et al. (2014), employ-
ing teams of three native speakers as annotators
for each language. We crawled the Spanish and
Italian reviews from TripAdvisor by accessing its
websites with the ‘.es’ and ‘.it’ domains, which
mostly contains reviews in the national language.
From that domains we downloaded the reviews
for the 10 most visited cities in Spain and Italy,
respectively. We downloaded 10 reviews for ev-
ery hotel of each city, obtaining a total of 17,020
reviews for Spanish and 33,325 for Italian. For
each dataset, 500 reviews were selected by ran-
domly sampling 50 reviews for each city. We thus
obtained 139 unique reviews for each annotator,
plus 83 reviews which all three annotators inde-
pendently annotated.

We decided to annotate the aspects that were
ratable on TripAdvisor at the time of our crawl
(April 2015: Rooms, Cleanliness, Value, Service, Lo-
cation, and Sleep Quality). Differently from the as-
pect schema in EN, we included the new aspect
Sleep Quality, and we did not consider the miss-
ing aspects Check-in and Businnes, which are, in
any case, the least frequent aspects in the Trip-MA
dataset (see Table 2). We kept the additional as-
pects Food, Building, Other, and NotRelated, as they
still appear frequently in the reviews. We adopted
the same 3-values sentiment label schema of EN,
i.e., Positive, Negative, or Neutral/Mixed.

Following the same procedure adopted by
Marcheggiani et al. (2014), the Spanish and Ital-
ian annotator teams performed a preliminary an-
notation session on reviews not included in the fi-
nal dataset. This preliminary activity was aimed at
aligning the annotators’ understanding about the
labeling process for the different aspects, by shar-
ing and solving any doubt that might arise during
the annotation of some examples.

2.3 Statistics

Table 1 shows that English reviews have, on av-
erage, about double the number of sentences of
Spanish and Italian reviews. This can be in part
motivated by observing that the sentences in EN
are, on average, 25% shorter than in ES and IT.
Also, after a manual inspection of the data, we
found that the EN part contains some reviews re-
lated to long vacations in resorts, thus describ-
ing in longer details the experience, while IT and
ES reviews are mainly related to relatively short
visits to classic hotels. However, the portion of
opinionated sentences is similar across the three
parts, indicating homogeneity in content, which is
confirmed by the detailed aspect-level statistics re-
ported in Table 2.

Both aspect and sentiment labels show imbal-
anced distributions that follow similar distribu-
tions across the three parts. The most frequent
aspect in all collections is Other, followed by
Rooms, Service, and Location. Building and Value
are among the least frequent ones. The average
value of the Pearson correlation between the lists
of the shared aspects ranked by their relative fre-
quency, measured pairwise among the three parts,
is 0.795, which indicates a good uniformity of
content among the parts. In all the three parts, Pos-
itive is the most frequent sentiment label, followed
by Negative. Location is always the aspect with the
highest frequency of positive labels.

3 Inter-annotator Agreement

We measured the inter-annotator agreement in two
steps. The F1 score measures the agreement on
aspect identification, regardless of the sentiment
label assigned. Then symmetric Macro-averaged
Mean Absolute Error (sMAEM ) (Baccianella et
al., 2009) measures the agreement on sentiment
labels on the annotations for which the annotators
agreed at the aspect level. Aspect NotRelated is not
included in agreement evaluation, nor in the ex-
periments of Section 4. sMAEM is computed be-
tween each of the three possible pairs of annota-
tors and then averaged to determine the agreement
values reported in Table 3.

Agreement on aspect detection is higher for ES
and IT than for EN. This difference is in part moti-
vated by the fact that the two aspects that are miss-
ing in ES and IT have low agreement on EN, and
the novel Sleep Quality aspect has instead a high
agreement. However, also on the other aspects

there is, in general, a higher or equal agreement in
ES and IT with respect to EN, indicating that the
formers two were annotated in a more consistent
way. The agreement on assignment of sentiment
label is rather similar across the whole dataset.

4 Experiments

The experiments we present here are aimed at
defining a shared baseline for future experiments.
For this reason we chose a relatively simple setup
that uses a simple learning model and minimal lin-
guistic resources. We used a sentence-level Linear
Chain (LC) Conditional Random Field (Lafferty
et al., 2001) as described by Marcheggiani et al.
(2014). With respect to the features extracted from
text, we used three simple features types: word
unigrams, bigrams, and SentiWordNet-based fea-
tures, which consist of a Positive and a Negative
feature extracted every time the review contains
a word that is marked as such in SentiWordNet
(Baccianella et al., 2010). To use SentiWord-
Net on ES and IT, we used Multilingual Cen-
tral Repository (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2012) and
MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) to map senti-
ment labels to Spanish and to Italian, respectively.

Experiments were run separately on the EN, ES,

and IT parts, leaving cross-lingual experiments to
future work. On each part we built five 70%/30%
train/test splits, randomly generated by sampling
the reviews annotated by single reviewers (we left
out reviews annotated by all the reviewers, as we
consider that part of the dataset more useful as
a validation set for the optimization of methods
tested in future experiments). We then run the five
experiments and averaged their results.

4.1 Evaluation Measures

As for the agreement evaluation (Section 3), we
split the evaluation of experiments into two parts,
aspect detection and sentiment labeling. For the
sentiment labeling part we used simple Macro-
averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAEM , not the
symmetric version) as the true dataset labels are
the reference ones in this case, while in the anno-
tator agreement case the two sets of labels have
equal importance.

4.2 Results

Experiments on ES and IT obtain better F1 values
than on EN, indicating that the observed higher
human agreement can be also explained by a lower
hardness of the task when working with Spanish

and Italian.
MAEM values are all similar across languages,

again confirming what has been observed on
agreement. However, MAEM values on experi-
ments are sensibly worse than those measured on
agreement, possibly due to the fact that we used
very basic features, with limited use of sentiment-
related information.

5 Conclusion

We have presented Trip-MAML a multi-lingual
extension of Trip-MA, originally presented in
(Marcheggiani et al., 2014). The extension pro-
cess involved crawling and selecting the reviews
for the two new languages, Spanish and Italian,
and their annotation by a total of six native lan-
guage speakers. We measured dataset statistics
and inter-annotator agreement, which show that
the new ES and IT parts we produced are consis-
tent with the original EN part. We also presented
experiments on the dataset, based on a linear chain
CRFs model for the automatic detection of aspects
and their sentiment labels, establishing a baseline
for future research. Trip-MAML enables the ex-
ploration of cross-lingual approaches to the prob-
lem of multi-aspect sentiment classification.
