Abstract

We present a word alignment framework
that can incorporate partial manual align-
ments. The core of the approach is a
novel semi-supervised algorithm extend-
ing the widely used IBM Models with
a constrained EM algorithm. The par-
tial manual alignments can be obtained
by human labelling or automatically by
high-precision-low-recall heuristics. We
demonstrate the usages of both methods
by selecting alignment links from manu-
ally aligned corpus and apply links gen-
erated from bilingual dictionary on unla-
belled data. For the first method, we con-
duct controlled experiments on Chinese-
English and Arabic-English translation
tasks to compare the quality of word align-
ment, and to measure effects of two differ-
ent methods in selecting alignment links
from manually aligned corpus. For the
second method, we experimented with
moderate-scale Chinese-English transla-
tion task. The experiment results show an
average improvement of 0.33 BLEU point
across 8 test sets.

1 Introduction
Word alignment is used in various natural lan-

guage processing applications, and most statistical
machine translation systems rely on word align-
ment as a preprocessing step. Traditionally the
word alignment model is trained in an unsuper-
vised manner, e.g. the most widely used tool
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which implements
the IBM Models (Brown et. al., 1993) and the
HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996). However, for
language pairs such as Chinese-English, the word
alignment quality is often unsatisfactory (Guzman
et al., 2009). There has been increasing interest on
using manual alignments in word alignment tasks.

Ittycheriah and Roukos (2005) proposed to use
only manual alignment links in a maximum en-
tropy model. A number of semi-supervised word
aligners are proposed (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006;
Niehues and Vogel, 2008; Taskar et al., 2005; Liu
et al., 2005; Moore, 2005). These approaches use
held-out manual alignments to tune the weights
for discriminative models, with the model param-
eters, model scores or alignment links from un-
supervised word aligners as features. Also, sev-
eral models are proposed to address the prob-
lem of improving generative models with small
amount of manual data, including Model 6 (Och
and Ney, 2003) and the model proposed by Fraser
and Marcu (2006) and its extension called LEAF
aligner (Fraser and Marcu, 2007). The approaches
use labelled data to tune parameters to combine
different components of the IBM Models.

Figure 1: Partial and full alignments

An interesting question is, if we only have par-
tial alignments of sentences, can we make use of
them? Figure 1 shows the comparison of par-
tial alignments (the bold link) and full alignments
(both of the dashed and the bold links). A partial
alignment of a sentence only provides a portion of
links of the full alignment. Although it seems to be
trivial, they actually convey different information.
In the example, if the full alignment is given, we
can assert 2005 is only aligned to 2005nian, not to
de or xiatian, but if only the partial alignment is
given we cannot make such assertion.

Partial alignments can be obtained from vari-
ous sources, for example, we can fetch them by
manually correcting unsupervised alignments, by
simple heuristics such as dictionaries of technical

1



terms, by rule-based alignment systems that have
high accuracy but low recall rate. The function-
ality is considered useful in many scenarios. For
example, the researchers can analyse the align-
ments generated by GIZA++ and fix common
error patterns, and perform training again. On
another way, an application can combine active
learning (Arora et al., 2009) and crowdsourcing,
asking non-expertise such as workers of Amazon
Mechanical Turk to label crucial alignment links
that can improve the system with low cost, which
is now a promising methodology in NLP areas
(Callison-Burch, 2009).

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised ex-
tension of the IBM Models that can utilize partial
alignment links. More specifically, we are seeking
answers for the following questions:

• Given the partial alignment of a sentence,
how to find the most probable alignment that
is consistent with the partial alignment.
• Given a set of partially aligned sentences,

how to get the parameters that maximize the
likelihood of the sentence pairs with align-
ments consistent with the partial alignments
• Given a set of partially aligned sentences,

with conflicting partial alignments, how to
answer the two questions above.

In the proposed approach, the manual partial
alignment links are treated as ground truth, there-
fore, they will be fixed. However, for all other
links we make no additional assumption. When
using manual alignments, there can be links con-
flicting with each other. These conflicting evi-
dences are treated as options and the generative
model will choose the most probable alignment
from them. An efficient training algorithm for
fertility-based models is proposed. The algorithm
manipulates the Moving and Swapping matrices
used in the hill-climbing algorithm (Och and Ney,
2003) to rule out inconsistent alignments in both
E-step and M-step of the training.

A similar attempt has been made by Callison-
Burch et al. (2004), where the authors interpo-
late the parameters estimated by sentence-aligned
and word-aligned corpus. Our approach is differ-
ent from their method that we do not require fully
aligned data and we do not need to interpolate two
parameter sets. All the training is done within a
unified framework. Our approach is also different
from LEAF (Fraser and Marcu, 2007) and Model
6 (Och and Ney, 2003) that we do not use these

additional links to tune additional parameters to
combine model components, as a result, it is not
limited to fully aligned corpus.

A question may raise why the proposed method
is superior over using the partial alignment links
as features in discriminative aligners? There are
three possible explanations. First, the method pre-
serves the power of the generative model in which
the algorithm utilizes large amount of unlabeled
data. More importantly, the additional information
can propagate over the whole corpus through bet-
ter estimation of model parameters. In contrast, if
we use the alignment links in discriminative align-
ers as a feature, one link can only affect the par-
ticular word, or at most the sentence. Second, al-
though the discriminative word alignment meth-
ods provide flexibility to utilize labeled data, most
of them still rely on generative aligners. Some
rely on the model parameters of the IBM Mod-
els (Liu et al., 2005; Blunsom and Cohn, 2006),
others rely on the alignment links from GIZA++
as features or as training data (Taskar et al., 2005),
or use both the model parameters and the align-
ment links (Niehues and Vogel, 2008). Therefore,
improving the generative aligner is still important
even when using discriminative aligners. Third,
these methods require full alignment of sentences
to provide positive (aligned) and negative (non-
aligned) information, which limits the availability
of data (Niehues and Vogel, 2008).

The proposed method has been successfully ap-
plied on various tasks, such as utilizing manual
alignments harvested from Amazon Mechanical
Turk (Gao and Vogel, 2010), and active learning
methods for improving word alignment (Ambati
et al., 2010). This paper provides the detailed al-
gorithm of the method and controlled experiments
to demonstrate its behavior.

The paper is organized as follows, in section
2 we describe the proposed model as well as the
modified training algorithm. Section 3 presents
two approaches of obtaining manual alignment
links, The experimental results will be shown in
section 4. We conclude the paper in section 5.

2 Semi-supervised word alignment

2.1 Problem Setup

The IBM Models (Brown et. al., 1993) are a
series of generative models for word alignment.
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) is the most widely
used implementation of the IBM Models and the

2



HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996). Given two
strings from target and source languages fJ1 =
f1, · · · , fj , · · · fJ and eI1 = e1, · · · , ei, · · · eI , an
alignment of the sentence pair is defined as aJ1 =
[a1, a2, · · · , aJ ], aj ∈ [0, I]. The IBM Models
assume all the target words must be covered ex-
actly once (Brown et. al., 1993). We try to model
P (fJ1 |eI1), which is the probability of observing
source sentence given target sentence eI1. In sta-
tistical models a hidden alignment variable is in-
troduced, so that we can write the probability as
P (fJ1 |eI1) =

∑
aJ1
Pr(fJ1 , a

J
1 |eJ1 , θ), where Pr(·)

is the estimated probability given the parameter set
θ. The IBM Models define several different set of
parameters, from Model 1 to Model 5. Starting
from Model 3, the fertility model is introduced.

EM algorithm is employed to estimate the
model parameters of the IBM Models. In E-step,
it is possible to obtain sufficient statistics from
all possible alignments with simplified formulas
for simple models such as Model 1 and Model 2.
Meanwhile for fertility-based models, enumerat-
ing all possibilities is NP-complete and hence it
cannot be carried out for long sentences. A solu-
tion is to explore only the “neighbors” of Viterbi
alignments. However, obtaining Viterbi align-
ments itself is NP-complete for these models. In
practice, a greedy algorithm is employed to find
a local optimal alignments based on Viterbi align-
ments generated by simpler models.

First, we define the neighbor alignments of a as
the set of alignments that differ by one of the two
operators from the original “center alignment”.

• Move operator m[i,j], that changes aj := i,
i.e. arbitrarily set word fj in source sentence
to align to word fi in target sentence.
• Swap operator s[j1,j2] that exchanges aj1 and
aj2 .

We denote the neighbor alignments set of
current center alignment a as nb(a). In
each step of hill-climbing algorithm, we find
the alignment b(a) in nb(a), s.t. b(a) =
arg maxa′∈nb(a) p(a

′|e, f), and update the current
center alignment. The algorithm iterates until
there is no update could be made. The statistics of
the neighbor alignments of the final center align-
ment will be collected for normalization step (M-
step). The algorithm is greedy, so a reasonable
start point is important. In practice GIZA++ uses
Model 2 or HMM to generate the seed alignment.

To improve the speed of hill climbing, GIZA++
caches the cost of all possible move and swap op-
erations in two matrices. In the so called Moving
Matrix M , the element Mij stores the likelihood
difference of a move operator aj = i:

Mij =
Pr(m[i,j](a)|e, f)

Pr(a|e, f)
· (1− δ(aj , i)) (1)

and in the Swapping Matrix S, the element Sjj′
stores the likelihood difference of a swap operator
between aj and aj′ :

Sjj′ =

{
Pr(S[j,j′](a)|e,f)

Pr(a|e,f) · (1− δ(aj , aj′)) if j < j
′

0 otherwise
(2)

The matrices will be updated whenever an oper-
ator is made, but the update is limited to the rows
and columns involved in the operator.

We define a partial alignment of a sentence
pair (fJ1 , e

I
1) as α

J
I = {(i, j), 0 ≤ i < I, 0 ≤

j < J}, note that the partial alignment does not
assume 1-to-N restriction on either side, and the
word from neither source nor target side need to be
covered with links. If an index is missing, it does
not mean the word is aligned to the empty word.
Instead it just means no information is provided.
We use a link (0, j) or (i, 0) to explicitly represent
the information that word fj or ei is aligned to the
empty word.

In order to find the most probable align-
ment that is consistent the partial alignments,
we treat the partial alignment as constraints, i.e.
for an alignment aJ1 = [a1, a2, · · · , aj ] on the
sentence pair fJ1 , e

I
1, the translation probability

Pr(fJ1 , a
J
1 |eI1, αJI ) will be zero if the alignment is

inconsistent with the partial alignments.

Pr(fJ1 |eI1, aJ1 , αJI ) =
{

0, aJ1 is inconsistent withαJI
Pr(fJ1 |eI1, aJ1 , θ), otherwise

(3)

Under the constraints of the IBM Models, there
are two situations that aJ1 is inconsistent with α

J
I :

1. Target word misalignment: The IBM Models
assume one target word can only be aligned
to one source word. Therefore, if the target
word fj aligns to a source word ei, while the
constraint αJI suggests fj should be aligned
to ei′ , the alignment violates the constraint
and thus is considered inconsistent.

2. Source word to empty word misalignment:
Since one source word can be aligned to mul-
tiple target words, it is hard to constrain the
alignments of source words. However, if a
source word is aligned to the empty word,
it cannot be aligned to any concrete target
word.

However, we are facing the problem of con-
flicting evidences. The problem is not necessar-
ily caused by errors in manual alignments, but
the assumption of the IBM Models that one tar-
get word can only be aligned to one source word.
This assumption causes multiple alignment links
from one target word conflict with each other. In
this case, we relax the constraints of situation 1
that if the alignment link aj∗ is consistent with any
target-to-source links (i, j) that j = j∗, it will be
considered consistent. Also, we arbitrarily assign
the source word to empty word constraints higher
priorities than other constraints.

In EM algorithm, to ensure the final model be
marginalized on the fixed alignment links, and
the final Viterbi alignment is consistent with the
fixed alignment links, we need to guarantee that
no statistics from inconsistent alignments be col-
lected into the sufficient statistics. On fertility-
based models, we have to make sure:

1. The hill-climbing algorithm outputs align-
ment links consistent with the fixed align-
ment links.

2. The count collection algorithm rules out all
the inconsistent statistics.

With the constrained hill-climbing algorithm
and count collection algorithm which will be de-
scribed below, the above two criteria are satisfied.

2.2 Constrained hill-climbing algorithm
Algorithm 1 shows the algorithm outline of con-

strained hill-climbing. First, similar to the original
hill-climbing algorithm described above, HMM
(or Model 2) is used to obtain a seed alignment.
To ensure the resulting center alignment be con-
sistent with manual alignment, we need to split the

Algorithm 1 Constrained Hill-Climbing

18: Update Mj1∗,Mj′1∗,M∗j1 ,M∗j′1

and Sj′1∗, Sj1∗, S∗j′1 , S∗j1 , set a0 := Sj1j′1(a0)
19: end if
20: end loop
21: Return a0

hill-climbing algorithm into two stages, i.e. opti-
mize towards the constraints and towards the opti-
mal alignment under the constraints.

From a seed alignment, we first try to move the
alignment towards the constraints by choosing a
move or swap operator that:

1. has highest likelihood among alignments
generated by other operators, excluding the
original alignment,

2. eliminates at least one inconsistent link.

The first step reflects in line 2 through 7 in the
algorithm, where we use ic(·) to denote the total
number of inconsistent links in the alignment, and
nb(·) to denote the neighbor alignments.

We iteratively update the alignment until no ad-
ditional inconsistent link can be removed. The al-
gorithm implies that we force the seed alignment
to become closer to the constraints while trying
to find the best consistent alignment. Figure 2
demonstrates the idea, given the manual alignment
link shown in (a), and the seed alignment shown as
solid links in (b), we move the inconsistent link to
the dashed link by a move operation.

After we find the consistent alignment, we pro-
ceed to optimize towards the optimal alignment
within the constraints. The algorithm sets the cells
to negative if the corresponding operations are not
allowed. The Moving matrix only need to be up-
dated once, as in line 8 of the algorithm. Whereas
the swapping matrix need to be updated every it-

4



eration, Since once the alignment is updated, the
possible violations will also change. This is done
in line 10.

If source words ik are aligned to the empty
word, we set Mik,j = −1,∀j, as shown in line 8.
The swapping matrix does not need to be modified
in this case because the swapping operator will not
introduce new links. Again, Figure 2 demonstrates
the optimization step in (c), two move operators
or one swap operator can move the link marked
with cross to the dashed line, which can be a bet-
ter alignment.

Because the cells that can lead to violations are
set to negative, the operators will never be picked
in line 11, therefore we effectively ensure the con-
sistency of the final center alignment.

The algorithm will end when no better update
can be made (line 12 through 14), otherwise, we
pick the new update with highest likelihood as new
center alignment and update the cells in the Mov-
ing and Swapping matrices that will be affected
by the update. Line 15 through line 19 perform
the operation.

2.3 Count Collection

After finding the center alignment, we collect
counts from the neighbor alignments so that the
M-step can normalize the counts to produce the
model parameters for the next step. All statis-
tics from inconsistent alignments are ruled out to
ensure the final sufficient statistics marginalized
on the fixed alignment links. Similar to the con-
strained hill climbing algorithm, we can manipu-
late the Moving/Swapping matrices to effectively
exclude inconsistent alignments. We just need to
bypass all the cells whose values are negative, i.e.
represent inconsistent alignments.

By combining the constrained EM algorithm
and the count collection, the Viterbi alignment is
guaranteed to be consistent with the fixed align-
ment links, and the sufficient statistics is guar-
anteed to contain no statistics from inconsistent
alignments.

2.4 Training scheme

We extend the multi-thread GIZA++ (Gao and
Vogel, 2008) to load the alignments from a mod-
ified corpus file. The links are appended to the
end of each sentence in the corpus file in the form
of indices pairs, which will be read by the aligner
during training. In practice, we first training un-
constrained models up to Model 4, and then switch

to constrained Model 4 and continue training for
several iterations, the actual number of training
order is: 5 iterations of Model 1, 5 iterations of
HMM, 3 iterations of Model 3, 3 iterations of
unconstrained Model 4 and 3 iterations of con-
strained Model 4. Because here we actually have
more Model 4 iterations, to make the comparison
fair, in all the experiments below we perform 6 it-
erations of Model 4 in the baseline systems.

3 Obtaining alignment links
Given the algorithm described in the Section 2,

we still face the problem of obtaining alignment
links to constrain the system. In this section, we
describe two approaches to obtain the links, the
first is to resort to human labels, while the second
applies high-precision-low-recall heuristic-based
aligner on large unsupervised corpus.

3.1 Using manual alignment links
Using manual alignment links is simple and

straight-forward, however the problem is how to
select links for human to label given that labelling
the whole corpus is impossible. We propose two
link selectors, the first is the random selector in
which every links in the manual alignment has
equal probability of being selected. Obviously,
the random selecting method is far from optimal
because it pays no attention on the quality of ex-
isting links. In order to demonstrate that by select-
ing links carefully we can achieve better alignment
quality with less manual alignment links, we pro-
pose the second selector based on disagreements
of alignments from two directions. We first clas-
sify the source and target words fj and ei into
three categories. Use fj as an example, the cat-
egories are:

• C1: fj aligns to ei, i > 0 in e → f ,1 but in
reversed direction ei does not align to fj but
to another word.
• C2: fj aligns to ei, i > 0, in f → e, but in

reversed direction (e → f ), fj aligns to the
empty word.
• C3: no word aligns to fj , in f → e, but in

reversed direction fj aligns to ei, i > 0.2

The criteria of ei are the same as fj after swap-
ping the definitions of “source” and “target”.

We prioritize the links αJI = (i, j) by looking at
the classes of the source/target words. The order of

1Recall that fj can align to only one word.
2This class is different from C1 that whether ei aligns to

concrete words or the empty word.

5



Order Criterion Order Criterion
1 fj ∈ C1 5 ei ∈ C2
2 fj ∈ C2 4 ei ∈ C1
3 fj ∈ C3 6 ei ∈ C3

Table 1: The priorities of alignment links

priorities is shown in Table 1. All the links not in
the six classes will have the lowest priorities. The
links with higher priorities will be selected first,
but the order of two links in a same priority class
is not defined and they will be selected randomly.

3.2 Using heuristics on unlabelled data
Another possible way of getting alignment links

is to make use of heuristics to generate high-
precision-low-recall links and feed them into the
aligner. The heuristics can be number map-
ping, person name translator or more sophisticated
methods such as alignment confidence measure
(Huang, 2009). In this paper we propose to use
manual dictionaries to generate alignment links.

First we filter out from the dictionary the en-
tries with high frequency in the source side, and
then build an aligner based on it. The aligner out-
put links between words if them match an entry
in the dictionary. The method can be applied on
large unlabelled corpus and generate large num-
ber of links, after that we use the links as manual
alignment links in proposed method.

The readers may notice that GIZA++ supports
utilizing manual dictionary as well, however it is
different from our method. The dictionary is used
in GIZA++ only in the initialization step of Model
1, where only the statistics of the word pairs ap-
peared in the dictionary will be collected and nor-
malized. Given the fact that Model 1 converges to
global optimal, the effect will fade out after sev-
eral iterations. In contrast, our method impose
a hard constraint on the alignments. Also, our
method can be used side-by-side with the method
in GIZA++.

4 Experiments
4.1 Experiments on manual link selectors

We designed a set of controlled experiments to
show that the algorithm acts as desired. Particu-
larly, with a number of manual alignment links fed
into the aligner, we should be able to correct more
misaligned alignment links than the manual align-
ment links through better alignment models. Also,
carefully selected alignment links should outper-

form randomly selected alignment links.
We used Chinese-English and Arabic-English

manually aligned corpus in the experiments. Ta-
ble 2 shows the statistics of the corpora:

Sentences Source Target Links

Ar-En 29,876 630,101 821,938 830,349

Table 2: Corpus statistics of the corpora

First the corpora is trained as unlabelled data
to serve as baselines, and then we feed a portion
of alignment links into the proposed aligner. We
experimented with different methods of choosing
alignment links and adjust the number of links vis-
ible to the aligner. Because of the limitations of
the IBM Models, such as no N-to-1 alignments,
the manual alignment is not reachable from ei-
ther direction. We then define the best align-
ment that the IBM Models can express “oracle
alignment”, which can be obtained by dropping
all N-to-1 links from manual alignment. Also, to
show the upper-bound performance, we feed all
the manual alignment links to our aligner, and call
the alignment “force alignment”. Table 3 shows
the alignment qualities of oracle alignments and
force alignments of both systems. For force align-
ments, we show the scores with and without im-
plicit empty links derived from the manual align-
ment.3 The oracle alignments are the performance
upper-bounds of all aligners under IBM Model’s
1-to-N assumption. The result from Table 3 shows
that, if we include the derived empty links, the
force alignments are close to the oracle results.
Then the question is how fast we can approach the
upper-bound.

To answer the question, we gradually increase
the number of links being fed into the aligner. In
these experiments the seeds for random number
generator are fixed so that the links selected in
later experiments are always superset of that of
earlier experiments. The comparison of the align-
ment quality is shown in Figure 3 and 4. To show
the actual improvement brought in by the algo-
rithm instead of the manual alignment links them-
selves, we compare the alignment results of the
proposed method with directly fixing the align-
ments from original GIZA++ training. By fix-
ing alignments we mean that first the conventional

3We can derive empty links if one word has no alignment
link from the full alignment we have access to.

Figure 3: Alignment qualities of Chinese-English word alignment, NN: Random selector without empty
links, WN: Random seletor with empty links, DF: Disagreement selector, FR: Directly fixing the align-
ments with random selector, FD: Directly fixing the alignments with disagreement selector. Each row
shows the precision, recall and AER when applying different number of manual alignment links. The
three rows are for Chinese-English, English-Chinese and heuristically symmetrized alignments (grow-
diag-final-and) accordingly.

GIZA++ training is performed and then we add the
manual alignment links to the resulting alignment.
In case that the 1-to-N restriction of the IBM Mod-
els is violated, we keep the manual alignment links
and remove the links from GIZA++.

We show the results as FR (dashed curves with
diamond markers) and FD (dashed curves with
square markers) in the plots, corresponding to
alignments selected from the random link selector
and the disagreement-based link selector. These
two curves serve as baseline, and the gaps between
the FR curves and the WN curves (dotted curves
with cross markers) and the gaps between the FD
curves and the DF curves (solid curves) show the
amount of improvement we achieved using the
method in addition to the manual alignment links.
Therefore, they represent the effectiveness of the
proposed alignment approach. Also the gaps be-

tween DF and WN curves indicate the differences
in the performance of two link selectors.

The plots illustrate that when the number of
links is small, the WN and DF curves are al-
ways higher than the FR/FD curves. It proves
that our system does not just fix the links pro-
vided by manual alignments, instead the informa-
tion propagates to other links. The largest gap
between FD and DF is 8% absolute in com-
bined alignment of Chinese-English system with
200,000 manual alignment links. Also, we can
see that the disagreement-based link selector (DF)
always outperform the random selector (WN). It
suggest that, if we want to harvest manual align-
ment links, it is possible to apply active learning
method to minimize the user labelling effort while
maximizing the improvement on word alignment
qualities. Especially, notice that in the lower parts

Figure 4: Alignment qualities of Arabic-English word alignment, NN: Random selector without empty
links, WN: Random selector with empty links, DF: Disagreement selector, FR: Directly fixing the align-
ments with random selector, FD: Directly fixing the alignments with disagreement selector. Each row
shows the precision, recall and AER when applying different number of manual alignment links. The
three rows are for Arabic-English, English-Arabic and heuristically symmetrized alignments (grow-diag-
final-and) accordingly.

of the curves, with a small number of manual
alignment links, we can already improve the align-
ment quality by a large gap. This observation can
benefit low-resource word alignment tasks.

4.2 Experiment on using heuristics

The previous experiment shows the potential of
using the method on manual aligned corpus, here
we demonstrate another possible usage of the pro-
posed method that uses heuristics to generate high-
precision-low-recall links. We use LDC Chinese-
English dictionary as an example. The entries with
single Chinese character and more than six En-
glish words are filtered out. The heuristic-based
aligner yields alignment that has 79.48% preci-
sion and 17.36% recall rate on the test set we used
in 4.1. By applying the links as manual links,
we run proposed method on the same Chinese-
English test data presented in 4.1, and the results

of alignment qualities are shown in 5. As we can
see, the AER reduced by 1.64 from 37.23 to 35.61
on symmetrized alignment.

We also experimented with translation tasks
with moderate-size corpus. We used the corpus
LDC2006G05 with 25 million words. The train-
ing scheme is the same as previous experiments,
where the filtered LDC dictionary is used. After
word alignment, standard Moses phrase extraction
tool (Och and Ney, 2004) is used to build the trans-
lation models and finally Moses (Koehn et. al.,
2007) is used to tune and decode.

We tune the system on the NIST MT06 test
set (1664 sentences), and test on the MT08 (1357
sentences) and the DEV075 (1211 sentences) test
sets, which are further divided into two sources
(newswire and web data). A trigram language

Table 3: Alignment quality of oracle alignment
and force alignment, the rows with “ORL” in the
second column are oracle alignments, “F/NE” and
“F/WE” represent force alignments with empty
links and without empty links correspondingly.
For “F/NE” and “F/WE” we also listed the
scores of heuristically symmetrized alignment4.
(“Comb”)

model trained from GigaWord V1 and V2 cor-
pora is used. Table 4 shows the comparison of
the performances on BLEU metric (Papineni et
al., 2002). As we can observe from the results,
the proposed method outperforms the baseline on
all test sets except MT03, and has significant6

improvement on MT02 (+0.72), MT04 (+0.93),
and Dev07NW(+0.63). The average improvement
across all test sets is 0.35 BLEU points.

As a summary, the purpose of the this experi-
ment is to demonstrate an important characteris-
tic of the proposed method. Even with imperfect
manual alignment links, we can get better align-
ment by applying our method. This characteristic
opens a possibility to integrate other more sophis-
ticated aligners.

Table 5: Comparison on alignment error rate by

utilize partial manual alignments. The proposed
method enables us to efficiently enforce subtle
alignment constraints into the EM training. We
performed experiments on manually aligned cor-
pora to prove the validity. We also demonstrated
using the method with simple heuristics to boost
the translation quality on moderate size unlabelled
corpus. The results show that our method is ef-
fective in promoting the word alignment quali-
ties with small amounts of partial alignments and
with high-precision-low-recall heuristics. Also the
method of using dictionary to generate manual
alignment links showed an average improvement
of 0.35 BLEU points across 8 test sets.

The algorithm has small impact on the speed of
GIZA++, and can easily be added to current multi-
thread implementation of GIZA++. Therefore it is
suitable for large scale training.

Future work includes applying the proposed ap-
proach on low resource language pairs and in-
tegrating the algorithm with other rule-based or
discriminative aligners that can generate high-
precision-low-recall partial alignments.
