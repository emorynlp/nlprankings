Abstract

We present the design and evaluation of a
web-based peer review system that uses natu-
ral language processing to automatically eval-
uate and provide instant feedback regarding
the presence of solutions in peer reviews. Stu-
dent reviewers can then choose to either revise
their reviews to address the system’s feedback,
or ignore the feedback and submit their orig-
inal reviews. A system deployment in multi-
ple high school classrooms shows that our so-
lution prediction model triggers instant feed-
back with high precision, and that the feed-
back is successful in increasing the number of
peer reviews with solutions.

1 Introduction

Peer review provides learning opportunities for stu-
dents in their roles as both author and reviewer, and
is a promising approach for helping students im-
prove their writing (Lundstrom and Baker, 2009).
However, one limitation of peer review is that stu-
dent reviewers are generally novices in their disci-
plines and typically inexperienced in constructing
helpful textual reviews (Cho and Schunn, 2007). Re-
search in the learning sciences has identified prop-
erties of helpful comments in textual reviews, e.g.,
localizing where problems occur in a paper and sug-
gesting solutions to problems (Nelson and Schunn,
2009), or providing review justifications such as ex-
planations of judgments (Gielen et al., 2010). Re-
search in computer science, in turn, has used nat-
ural language processing and machine learning to
build models for automatically identifying helpful

review properties, including localization and solu-
tion (Xiong and Litman, 2010; Nguyen and Lit-
man, 2013; Xiong et al., 2012; Nguyen and Litman,
2014), as well as quality and tone (Ramachandran
and Gehringer, 2015). While such prediction mod-
els have been evaluated intrinsically (i.e., with re-
spect to predicting gold-standard labels), few have
actually been incorporated into working peer review
systems and evaluated extrinsically (Ramachandran
and Gehringer, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014).

The SWoRD research project1 involves different
active research threads for improving the utility of
an existing web-based peer review system. Our re-
search in the SWoRD project aims at building instant
feedback components for improving the quality of
textual peer reviews. Our initial work focused on
improving review localization (Nguyen et al., 2014).
Here we focus on increasing the presence of solu-
tions in reviews. When students submit reviews,

interface shows only one comment prompt and its associated rating prompt. The instant feedback interface displays a solution feed-

back message and three possible reviewer reactions (top), and highlights problem-only (middle) and solution (bottom) comments.

natural language processing is used to automatically
predict whether a solution is present in each peer
review comment (Figure 1). If not enough critical
comments are predicted to contain explicit solutions
for how to make the paper better, students are taken
from the original review interface to a new instant
feedback interface which scaffolds them in produc-
tively revising the original peer reviews (Figure 2).

Sections 2 and 3 describe the Instant-feedback
workflow, and the supporting natural language pro-
cessing techniques. Section 4 demonstrates the
promise of our system in supporting student review
revision in a recent system deployment.

2 Instant-feedback SWoRD

SWoRD2 was developed to support web-based re-
ciprocal peer review, especially in large classes in-
volving writing in the disciplines where writing and
revision are hard to support due to lack of resources.
A typical peer review exercise in SWoRD involves
three main phases: (1) student authors submit pa-
pers to SWoRD, (2) student reviewers download pa-
pers assigned to them and submit peer reviews of
the papers, and (3) student authors submit paper re-
visions that address the peer reviews they received.
To further enhance the utility of SWoRD, we have

developed Instant-feedback SWoRD, with the goal
of helping student reviewers increase the presence
of solutions in the peer review comments produced
during Phase 2 of the typical peer review exercise.

Figures 2 and 1 illustrate technical details
of Instant-feedback SWoRD. As in the original
SWoRD, student reviewers create a new review ses-
sion by opening the review interface (Figure 2,
left). Now, however, whenever the SUBMIT button
is clicked, the “text review input” is passed to the
“Submission order check” (Figure 1, diamond #1).
The submission order threshold3 specifies how many
times a review will be processed for instant feedback
(e.g., 0 means no instant feedback, 1 means only
the original comments are analyzed, 2 means revised
comments are also analyzed, etc.). If the threshold
is not reached, each comment in the review is an-
alyzed by the “Comment-level Solution Prediction
Component” (see Section 3) and classified as a Solu-
tion, Problem-only, or Non-criticism. Problem-only
comments point out problems without providing so-
lutions, while Non-criticisms such as summaries or
praise do not require solutions. To measure how
many problem comments have solutions, we define
S-RATIO as number of solution comments over the
sum of solution and problem-only comments. If the
predicted S-RATIO is less than or equal to a thresh-
old4 (Figure 1, diamond #2), instant feedback is trig-

gered to scaffold students in revising problem-only
comments. Otherwise the review is deemed accept-
able and stored for later use by Phase 3.

When instant feedback is triggered, the instant
feedback interface (Figure 2, right) displays a mes-
sage at the top suggesting that comments may need
to be revised to include solutions, followed by but-
tons representing the 3 possible reviewer responses:
revise the review and resubmit (left), view some pre-
defined example comments with solutions before re-
sponding (center), or submit the review without revi-
sion (right). To call the reviewer’s attention to com-
ments that might need revision, the interface turns
text boxes around predicted problem-only comments
to red (Figure 2, middle right). For these comments,
the system also generates option buttons that ask re-
viewers to provide feedback on the prediction. We
hypothesized that asking students to reason about
the absence of solutions in their own comments
would promote review revision. Their feedback on
the system’s predictions also provides new anno-
tated examples for future re-training of the predic-
tion model (described in Section 3). Conversely, the
interface highlights predicted solution comments in
green (Figure 2, bottom right) along with displaying
a thumbs-up icon. This highlighting was designed
to draw reviewer attention to examples of solutions
in their own comments. Finally, for reviews that are
revised and resubmitted, Instant-feedback SWoRD
increases the submission order and re-checks the
threshold (diamond #1 in Figure 1). Unrevised re-
views are instead stored for Phase 3 of SWoRD.

3 Comment-level Solution Prediction

To support the instant feedback interface described
in the prior section, we developed a 3-way classi-
fication model for predicting a review comment’s
feedback type: Solution, Problem-only, or Non-
criticism. Challenges emerge from the fact that
SWoRD serves a wide range of classes ranging from
high school to graduate school and from STEM to
language arts. Consequently, our prediction model
has to process peer review comments that greatly
differ in style and vocabulary. We thus focused on
modeling how students suggested solutions by de-
veloping the following feature sets that abstracted

using development data from prior classes.

over specific lexicons and paper topics:
• Simple: word count and order of the comment.
• Keywords: we semi-automatically created 10 key-

word sets to model different content patterns, extending
prior work (Xiong et al., 2010): Solution, Idea, Sugges-
tion, Location, Connective, Positive, Negative, Summary,
Error, Negation. For each set, we count the total occur-
rences of its keywords in the comment.
• Location phrases: we observed in our training data

that solution content usually co-occurs with location in-
formation in comments. Thus, we extracted words and
phrases that signal positional localization in comments
of training data. This feature set includes hand-crafted
regular expressions of location patterns (e.g., on page
5) (Xiong et al., 2010), location seed words (manu-
ally collected, e.g., page, thesis, conclusion), and loca-
tion bigrams (automatically extracted given the location
seeds, e.g., transition paragraph). For each location seed,
phrase or regular expression, we count its occurrences or
matches in the comment.
• Paper content: motivated by topic word features in

(Kim et al., 2006), this feature set was designed to model
how much of a paper’s content/topic was mentioned in
the comment. We first extracted bigrams with TF-IDF
above average in the training data, and collected uni-
grams that make-up these bigrams, e.g., ‘civil’ and ‘war’
in ‘civil war’.5 Domain unigram feature is the number of
collected unigrams in the comment. Window size feature
is the length of maximal common text span between the
comment and the paper (Ernst-Gerlach and Crane, 2008).
Similarity feature searches for the highest similarity score
between paper sentence to the comment. We extract 5 pa-
per sentences (1 covering the common span, 2 preceding,
and 2 following). For each pair of paper sentence and the
comment, we apply different similarity scores (e.g., Lev-
enshtein, cosine) to 4 abstractions of the pair (sequence
of tokens, sequence of part-of-speech, sequence of nouns,
sequence of verbs), and return the pair’s sum score. Fea-
ture value is the highest sum score over all pairs.

Our solution prediction model was trained with
logistic regression using annotated peer review com-
ments from two university classes (Computer Sci-
ence, History) and a high-school class (Literature).
During learning, we used a cost matrix to favor in-
stant feedback precision over recall by penalizing
relevant error types. We thought it would be better
to miss some feedback opportunities than to incor-
rectly trigger instant feedback (e.g., asking students
to revise reviews where all comments already con-

model performance. We plan to apply LDA (Blei et al., 2003)
for this task in future.

as red or green in the feedback interface.

4 Preliminary Evaluation

In Spring 2015, SWoRD with instant-feedback was
deployed in 9 high-school Advanced Placement
(AP) classes. We conducted preliminary evalua-
tions to answer two research questions: (1) How
precisely does the system predict peer review solu-
tion and trigger the instant feedback? (2) How does
the instant feedback impact review revisions? We
collected peer review submissions which were inter-
vened by Instant-feedback SWoRD (i.e., triggered
instant feedback), and their immediately subsequent
resubmissions (if any), then had an expert manu-
ally code the collected comments for their feed-
back types: solution, problem-only, non-criticism
(double-coded data had inter-rater κ 0.87).

Only intervened reviews were used to evaluate
model performance because subsequent resubmis-
sions were not predicted. In our deployment, 134
of 1428 reviews were intervened, containing 891
comments: 223 Solution, 340 Problem-only, and
328 Non-criticism. Table 1 shows that our deployed
model outperforms a Bag-of-Words (BoW) base-
line6 in 3-way classification. Given that the AP data
was never used for model training, the obtained per-
formance is promising and encourages us to improve
the model with more data.

Regarding instant feedback precision, we calcu-
lated the true S-RATIO for each intervened review
(using gold standard labels). Table 2 shows that
given the 0.7 threshold used for this deployment,
Instant-feedback SWoRD incorrectly triggered in-
stant feedback for 24 submissions (column 3) out
of 134, yielding a precision 0.82. Because Instant-
feedback SWoRD does not let student reviewers
know the S-RATIO threshold, students should only
think that the instant feedback was incorrect when

they provided solutions for all mentioned problems
(true S-RATIO = 1). From this student perspective,
Instant-feedback SWoRD had 16 incorrect triggers
(column 4), achieving a precision 0.88.

Finally, to evaluate the impact of instant feedback
on review revision, we considered the 74 subsequent
resubmissions. We collected comments that were re-
vised or newly-added to the resubmissions (no com-
ment was deleted), and obtained 115 comments.
Pairing 111 revised comments with their original
versions, we observed that 73 (66%) comments
were fixed from problem-only to solution, 3 (3%)
from non-criticism to solution, only 1 comment
(0.9%) was edited from solution to non-criticism,
and none from solution to problem-only. All of
the 4 newly-added comments mentioned problems
and provided solutions. These results suggest that
Instant-feedback SWoRD does indeed help review-
ers revise their comments to include more solutions.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper presented Instant-feedback SWoRD,
which was designed to increase the presence of so-
lutions in peer reviews. Evaluation results showed
that Instant-feedback SWoRD achieved high perfor-
mance in predicting solution in review comments
and in triggering instant feedback. Moreover, for
reviewers who revised their reviews after receiving
instant feedback, the number of comments with so-
lution increased. In future work, we plan to use more
data from a wider range of classes to re-train the
currently deployed prediction model. Also, a com-
prehensive comparison of our approach to studies of
similar tasks would give us insight into features and
algorithms for performance improvement.
