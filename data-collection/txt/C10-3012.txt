Abstract

In this paper, we propose a lexical senses
representation system called E-HowNet,
in which the lexical senses are defined by
basic concepts. As a result, the mean-
ings of expressions are more specific than
those derived by using primitives. We also
design an ontology to express the taxo-
nomic relations between concepts and the
attributes of concepts. To establish the
taxonomic relations between word senses,
we introduce a strategy that constructs the
E-HowNet ontology automatically. We
then implement the lexical ontology as a
Web application1 to demonstrate the tax-
onomy and the search functions for query-
ing key-terms and E-HowNet expressions
in the lexicon, which contains more than
88,000 lexical senses.

1 Introduction

E-HowNet, an evolution and extension of HowNet
(Dong & Dong, 2006), is an entity-relation rep-
resentation model for lexical senses. Under the
framework, word senses are defined by basic
concepts as well as conceptual relations called
attribute-values. The following is an example of
lexical sense representation in E-HowNet.

(1) ‘慎 選|carefully choose’ is expressed
(or defined) by the expression ‘{choose|選
擇:manner={cautious|慎}}’.

In the representation, the meaning of “慎選” is
comprised of two primitive concepts, “choose|選
擇” and “cautious|慎”, and the conceptual rela-

tion between the primitives is explained by the se-
mantic role “manner”. For further details, readers
may refer to the E-HowNet technical report (CKIP
2009).

With a well-established entity-relation model,
semantic composition is applicable from the mor-
phological level to the sentential level in E-
HowNet. Semantic compositionality, together
with syntactic information, contributes enor-
mously to natural language understanding.

The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. We describe the major features of E-
HowNet in Section 2 and introduce the E-HowNet
ontology in Section 3. Then, we present our on-
line E-HowNet system in Section 4. Section 5
contains some concluding remarks.

To achieve the goal of semantic compositional-
ity and to extend the advantage from HowNet, the
following features are implemented in E-HowNet.

a) Multi-level definitions and semantic decom-
position: Word senses (concepts) can be defined
(expressed) by primitives as well as by any well-
defined concepts and conceptual relations. How-
ever, using only primitives to express word senses,
as in HowNet, causes information degradation and
important ontological relations between concepts
may be missed.

b) Uniform sense representation and seman-
tic compositionality: To achieve semantic com-
positionality, it is necessary to encode the senses
of both content words and function words in a
uniform framework. HowNet performs well for
defining content words, but it does not provide
a well-form representational framework for ex-
pression the sense of function words, which in-
dicate semantic relations. In contrast, E-HowNet

provides uniform representations for the senses
of content/function words and the senses of sen-
tences/phrases. For example, the passive sense
of the preposition ‘被 by’ introduces an agent
role (relation) and the conjunction ‘因為 because’
links the relation of reason between two events.
The functional representation and semantic com-
positionality are illustrated by the following ex-
ample:

(2) Because of the rain, the clothes are all wet.
因為下雨，衣服都濕了。

Table 1: The function representation and semantic
compositionality for example sentence

下雨

(common noun)

都
Da Quantity=
(adverb) {complete|整}

濕
VH {wet|濕}
(state verb)

了
Ta aspect=
(particle) {Vachieve|達成}

Suppose that the following dependency struc-
ture and semantic relations are derived by parsing
sentence (2) as follows:

(3) S(reason:VP(Head:Cb:因為|dummy:VA:下
雨)|theme:NP(Head:Na:衣服) | quantity: Da:都 |
Head:Vh:濕|particle:Ta:了)。

The semantic composition in (4) is the result of
unifying the features of the lexical representations
shown in the above table. The dependency daugh-
ters have become feature attributes of the senten-
tial head ‘wet|濕’.

(4) def:{wet|濕:
theme={clothing|衣物},
aspect={Vachieve|達成},
quantity={complete|整},
reason={rain|下雨}}.
c) Taxonomy for both entities and relations: To

achieve automatic feature unification, E-HowNet
organizes entities and relations (attributes) in a hi-
erarchical structure that relates entities taxonomi-
cally. Further details are provided in the next sec-
tion.

2 Ontology

We adopt and extend approximately 2,600 prim-
itives from HowNet to form the top-level ontol-
ogy of E-HowNet, which includes two types of
subtrees: entities and relations. The entities are
comprised of events, objects, and attribute-values;
while the relations are comprised of semantic-
roles and functions. Entities indicate concepts that
have substantial content, whereas relations link
the semantic relations between entities (Chen et
al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005;
Huang et al, 2008). The taxonomic structure is or-
ganized by hypernym-hyponym relations; there-
fore, it forms an inheritable system, i.e., the hy-
ponym concepts inherit the properties of hyper-
nym concepts. The proposed approach facilitates
the adoption of knowledge represented by other
frameworks, such as FrameNet, and HowNet; and
it allows concepts to be represented with vary-
ing degrees of specificity. Another advantage is
that conceptual similarities can be modeled by
their relational distances in the hierarchy (Resnik,
1999), and the taxonomic relations between lexi-
cal senses can be captured from their E-HowNet
expressions automatically.

2.1 Automatic Construction of Ontology

With E-HowNet expressions, lexical senses are
defined as entities and relations. Thus, all the tax-
onomic relations of lexical senses can be iden-
tified according to their E-HowNet definitions.
Synonyms are identified by their identical E-
HowNet expressions, and hyponymy relations are
identified by the subsumption of attribute-values.
(Note that only near-synonym classes are iden-
tified due to the coarse-grained expressions of
the lexical senses in the current version of E-
HowNet.) Furthermore, new categories are iden-
tified by common attribute-values. For instance,
pandas and zebras can be categorized as animals
with the same feature: black and white markings.
To construct a complete lexical taxonomy, we use

46

a strategy that categorizes concepts automatically.
Starting with a manually created top-level on-

tology of primitive concepts, the following strat-
egy classifies the lexicon into hierarchical sub-
categories:

(1) Attach lexical senses. Words and associ-
ated sense expressions are first attached to the top-
level ontology nodes according to their head con-
cepts. For instance, the head concept of the ex-
pression ‘{choose|選擇:manner={cautious|慎}}’
is‘choose|選擇’.

(2) Sub-categorization by attribute-values. Lex-
ical concepts with the same semantic head are fur-
ther sub-categorized according to their attribute-
values. Lexicons that have the same attribute-
values share specific characteristics; therefore fur-
ther sub-categorization is performed based on the
distinct attribute-values of the lexicons.

(3) Repeat step (2) if there are too many lexical
concepts in one category. Although the lexicons
are classified after step (2), some sub-categories
might still contain too many lexicons. In this
situation, we further classify the lexicons in the
sub-category with other attribute-values until all
sub-categories contain fewer members than a pre-
defined threshold, or all members of a category
are synonyms.

3 Overview of the On-line System

The current E-HowNet ontology is an on-line ver-
sion of the automatically constructed taxonomic
structure of E-HowNet expressions, which con-
tain more than 88,000 lexical senses. This sec-
tion provides an overview of the ontology and the
functions of the on-line web browsing system.

Figure 2: Key-Term Search Box

Figure 1 shows the E-HowNet ontology system
and tree structure.

The tree structure of hyponymy relations al-
lows users to browse the entire tree by expanding
and hiding sub-trees. Although the classification
strategy enables the number of entities under each
node to be limited and viewed easily, a more effec-
tive function is essential for exploring more than
88 thousand items of data in E-HowNet. There-
fore, we provide a search function that allows
users to query lexical senses in two ways:

Key-Term Search: The first way is key-term
search, which is shown in Figure 2. The syntax
of the query interface is like that used by conven-
tional search engines. By inputting the key-term
“物體” , the system will search all the taxonomy
nodes, sub-categories, and lexical nodes. Then,
the results for the taxonomy node “object|物體”
and the lexical word “物體” will be displayed in

the respective columns.
E-HowNet Expression Search: To search

a class of words with specific attribute-values,
we provide another query syntax for exploring
data in E-HowNet Expression. For instance, to
find all expressions about wooden objects in-
volves finding E-HowNet data items containing
the entity “object—物體” and the attribute-value
“material={wood|木}”. The expressions are en-
tered on the form shown in Figure 3 and submitted
to the system. The results of word senses denoting
wooden objects are then returned.

4 Conclusion

E-HowNet sense representations are incremental.
Hence, lexical sense expressions can be updated
and refined at anytime. In addition, logical rela-
tions and the taxonomic structure can be rebuilt
automatically based on the refined expressions.
New categories in the taxonomy can be identi-
fied and characterized by their specific attribute-
values. Uniform representations of function
words and content words facilitate semantic com-
position and decomposition, and allow users to
derive sense representations of phrases/sentences
from the composition of lexical senses. Further-
more, because of E-HowNet’s semantic decom-
position capability, the primitive representations
for surface sentences with the same deep seman-
tics are nearly canonical. We have implemented
the E-HowNet ontology online to demonstrate the
taxonomy, sub-categories, and lexicons in a hier-
archical tree structure. In addition, we provide
search functions for querying key-terms and E-
HowNet expressions.
