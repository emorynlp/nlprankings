Abstract

In this paper we investigate the challenges
of applying statistical machine translation
to meeting conversations, with a particu-
lar view towards analyzing the importance
of modeling contextual factors such as the
larger discourse context and topic/domain
information on translation performance.
We describe the collection of a small cor-
pus of parallel meeting data, the develop-
ment of a statistical machine translation
system in the absence of genre-matched
training data, and we present a quantita-
tive analysis of translation errors result-
ing from the lack of contextual modeling
inherent in standard statistical machine
translation systems. Finally, we demon-
strate how the largest source of translation
errors (lack of topic/domain knowledge)
can be addressed by applying document-
level, unsupervised word sense disam-
biguation, resulting in performance im-
provements over the baseline system.

1 Introduction
Although statistical machine translation (SMT)
has made great progress over the last decade,
most SMT research has focused on the transla-
tion of structured input data, such as newswire
text or parliamentary proceedings. Spoken lan-
guage translation has mostly concentrated on two-
person dialogues, such as travel expressions or
patient-provider interactions in the medical do-
main. Recently, more advanced spoken-language
data has been addressed, such as speeches (St¨uker
et al., 2007), lectures (Waibel and F¨ugen, 2008),

and broadcast conversations (Zheng et al., 2008).
Problems for machine translation in these genres
include the nature of spontaneous speech input
(e.g. disﬂuencies, incomplete sentences, etc.) and
the lack of high-quality training data. Data that
match the desired type of spoken-language inter-
action in topic, domain, and, most importantly, in
style, can only be obtained by transcribing and
translating conversations, which is a costly and
time-consuming process. Finally, many spoken-
language interactions, especially those involving
more than two speakers, rely heavily on the par-
ticipants’ shared contextual knowledge about the
domain and topic of the discourse, relationships
between speakers, objects in the real-world en-
vironment, past interactions, etc. These are typ-
ically not modelled in standard SMT systems.

The problem of speech disﬂuencies has been
addressed by disﬂuency removal techniques that
are applied prior to translation (Rao et al., 2007;
Wang et al., 2010). Training data sparsity has been
addressed by adding data from out-of-domain re-
sources (e.g. (Matusov et al., 2004; Hildebrandt
et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2008)), exploiting com-
parable rather than parallel corpora (Munteanu
and Marcu, 2005), or paraphrasing techniques
(Callison-Burch et al., 2006). The lack of con-
textual modeling, by contrast, has so far not been
investigated in depth, although it is a generally
recognized problem in machine translation. Early
attempts at modeling contextual information in
machine translation include (Mima et al., 1998),
where information about the role, rank and gen-
der of speakers and listeners was utilized in a
transfer-based spoken-language translation sys-
tem for travel dialogs.
In (Kumar et al., 2008)

1228

statistically predicted dialog acts were used in a
phrase-based SMT system for three different di-
alog tasks and were shown to improve perfor-
mance. Recently, contextual source-language fea-
tures have been incorporated into translation mod-
els to predict translation phrases for traveling do-
main tasks (Stroppa et al., 2007; Haque et al.,
2009). However, we are not aware of any work ad-
dressing contextual modeling for statistical trans-
lation of spoken meeting-style interactions, not
least due to the lack of a relevant corpus.

The ﬁrst goal of this study is to provide a quan-
titative analysis of the impact of the lack of con-
textual modeling on translation performance. To
this end we have collected a small corpus of par-
allel multi-party meeting data. A baseline SMT
system was trained for this corpus from freely
available data resources, and contextual transla-
tion errors were manually analyzed with respect
to the type of knowledge sources required to re-
solve them. Our analysis shows that the largest
error category consists of word sense disambigua-
tion errors resulting from a lack of topic/domain
modeling.
In the second part of this study we
therefore present a statistical way of incorporat-
ing such knowledge by using a graph-based unsu-
pervised word sense disambiguation algorithm at
a global (i.e. document) level. Our evaluation on
real-world meeting data shows that this technique
improves the translation performance slightly but
consistently with respect to position-independent
word error rate (PER).

2 Data

2.1 Parallel Conversational Data
For our investigations we used a subset of the AMI
corpus (McCowan, 2005), which is a collection of
multi-party meetings consisting of approximately
100 hours of multimodal data (audio and video
recordings, slide images, data captured from dig-
ital whiteboards, etc.) with a variety of existing
annotations (audio transcriptions, topic segmenta-
tions, summaries, etc.). Meetings were recorded
in English and fall into two broad types: sce-
nario meetings, where participants were asked to
act out roles in a pre-deﬁned scenario, and non-
scenario meetings where participants were not re-

stricted by role assignments. In the ﬁrst case, the
scenario was a project meeting about the devel-
opment of a new TV remote control; participant
roles were project manager, industrial designer,
marketing expert, etc. The non-scenario meet-
ings are about the move of an academic lab to
a new location on campus. The number of par-
ticipants is four. For our study we selected 10
meetings (5 scenario meetings and 5 non-scenario
meetings) and had their audio transcriptions trans-
lated into German (our chosen target language) by
two native speakers each. Translators were able
to simultaneously read the audio transcription of
the meeting, view the video, and listen to the au-
dio, when creating the translation. The transla-
tion guidelines were designed to obtain transla-
tions that match the source text as closely as pos-
sible in terms of style – for example, translators
were asked to maintain the same level of collo-
quial as opposed to formal language, and to gen-
erally ensure that the translation was pragmati-
cally adequate. Obvious errors in the source text
(e.g. errors made by non-native English speak-
ers among the meeting participants) were not ren-
dered by equivalent errors in the German transla-
tion but were corrected prior to translation. The
ﬁnal translations were reviewed for accuracy and
the data were ﬁltered semi-automatically by elim-
inating incomplete sentences, false starts, ﬁllers,
repetitions, etc. Although these would certainly
pose problems in a real-world application of spo-
ken language translation, the goal of this study
is not to analyze the impact of speech-speciﬁc
phenomena on translation performance (which, as
discussed in Section 1, has been addressed be-
fore) but to assess the impact of contextual infor-
mation such as discourse and knowledge of the
real-world surroundings. Finally, single-word ut-
terances such as yeah, oh, no, sure, etc. were
downsampled since they are trivial to translate and
were very frequent in the corpus; their inclusion
would therefore bias the development and tuning
of the MT system towards these short utterances
at the expense of longer, more informative utter-
ances.

lated meetings after the preprocessing steps de-
scribed above. As an indicator of inter-translator

agreement we computed the symmetric BLEU
(S-BLEU) scores on the reference translations
(i.e. using one translation as the reference and the
other as the hypothesis, then switching them and
averaging the results). As we can see, scores are
fairly low overall, indicating large variation in the
translations. This is due to (a) the nature of con-
versational speech, and (b) the linguistic proper-
ties of the target language. Conversational data
contain a fair amount of colloquialisms, referen-
tial expressions, etc. that can be translated in a va-
riety of ways. Additionally, German as the target
language permits many variations in word order
that convey slight differences in emphasis, which
is turn is dependent on the translators’ interpreta-
tion of the source sentence. German also has rich
inﬂectional morphology that varies along with the
choice of words and word order (e.g. verbal mor-
phology depends on which subject is chosen).

2.2 SMT System Training Data

Since transcription and translation of multi-
party spoken conversations is extremely time-
consuming and costly, it is unlikely that parallel
conversational data will ever be produced on a suf-
ﬁciently large scale for a variety of different meet-
ing types, topics, and target languages. In order to
mimic this situation we trained an initial English-
German SMT system on freely available out-of-
domain data resources. We considered the follow-

ing parallel corpora: news text (de-news1, 1.5M
words), EU parliamentary proceedings (Europarl
(Koehn, 2005), 24M words) and EU legal docu-
ments (JRC Acquis2, 35M words), as well as two
generic English-German machine-readable dictio-
naries3,4 (672k and 140k entries, respectively).

3 Translation Systems
We trained a standard statistical phrase-based
English-German translation system from the re-
sources described above using Moses (Hoang and
Koehn, 2008). Individual language models were
trained for each data source and were then lin-
early interpolated with weights optimized on the
development set. Similarly, individual phrase ta-
bles were trained and were then combined into a
single table. Binary indicator features were added
for each phrase pair, indicating which data source
it was extracted from. Duplicated phrase pairs
were merged into a single entry by averaging their
scores (geometric mean) over all duplicated en-
tries. The weights for binary indicator features
were optimized along with all other standard fea-
tures on the development set. Our previous ex-
perience showed that this method worked better
than the two built-in features in Moses for han-
dling multiple translation tables. We found that
the JRC corpus obtained very small weights; it
was therefore omitted from further system de-
velopment. Table 2 reports results from six dif-
ferent systems:
the ﬁrst (System 1) is a system
that only uses the parallel corpora but not the
external dictionaries listed in Section 2.2. Sys-
tem 2 additionally uses the external dictionar-
ies. All systems use two meetings (IB4002 and
IS1008b) as a development set for tuning model
parameters and ﬁve meetings for testing (IB4003-
5,IS1008c,TS3005a). For comparison we also
trained a version of the system where a small in-
domain data set (meetings ES2008a, IB4001, and
IS1008a) was added to the training data (System
3). Finally, we also compared our performance
against Google Translate, which is a state-of-the-
art statistical MT system with unconstrained ac-

cess to the web as training data (System 6). As
expected, translation performance is fairly poor
compared to the performance generally obtained
on more structured genres. The use of exter-
nal dictionaries helps primarily in reducing PER
scores while BLEU scores are only improved no-
ticeably by adding in-domain data. System 6
shows a more even performance across dev and
eval sets than our trained system, which may re-
ﬂect some degree of overtuning of our systems
to the relatively small development set (about 7K
words). However, the PER scores of System 6 are
signiﬁcantly worse compared to our in-house sys-
tems.

In order to assess the impact of adding web data
speciﬁcally collected to match our meeting corpus
we queried a web portal5 that searches a range of
English-German bilingual web resources and re-
turns parallel text in response to queries in either
English or German. As queries we used English
phrases from our development and evaluation sets
that (a) did not already have phrasal translations
in our phrase tables, (b) had a minimum length
of four words, and (c) occurred at least twice in
the test data. In those cases where the search en-
gine returned results with an exact match on the
English side, we word-aligned the resulting paral-
lel text (about 600k words) by training the word
alignment together with the news text corpus. We
then extracted new phrase pairs (about 3k) from
the aligned data. The phrasal scores assigned to

5http://www.linguee.com

the new phrase pairs were set to 1; the lexical
scores were computed from a word lexicon trained
over both the baseline data resources and the par-
allel web data. However, results (Row 5 in Ta-
ble 2) show that performance hardly improved,
indicating the difﬁculty in ﬁnding matching data
sources for conversational speech.

Table 2 also shows the impact of different data
resources on the percentages of unknown word
types (OOV) for both the source and target lan-
guages. The use of external dictionaries gave the
largest reduction of OOV rates (System 1 vs. Sys-
tem 2 and System 3 vs. System 4), followed by the
use of in-domain data (System 1 vs. System 3 and
System 2 vs. System 4). Since they were retrieved
by multi-word query phrases, adding the web data
did not lead to signiﬁcant reduction on the OOV
rates (System 4 vs. System 5).

Finally, we also explored a hierarchical phrase-
based system as an alternative baseline system.
The system was trained using the Joshua toolkit
(Li et al., 2009) with the same word alignments
and language models as were used in the standard
phrase-based baseline system (System 4). After
extracting the phrasal (rule) tables for each data
source, they were combined into a single phrasal
(rule) table using the same combination approach
as for the basic phrase-based system. However,
the translation results (BLEU/PER of 24.0/46.6
(dev) and 20.8/47.6 (eval), respectively) did not
show any improvement over the basic phrase-
based system.

4 Analysis of Baseline Translations:
Effect of Contextual Information

The output from System 5 was analyzed manu-
ally in order to assess the importance of model-
ing contextual information. Our goal was not to
determine how translation of meeting style data
can be improved in general – better translations
could certainly be generated by better syntactic
modeling, addressing morphological variation in
German, and generally improving phrasal cover-
age, in particular for sentences involving collo-
quial expressions. However, these are fairly gen-
eral problems of SMT that have been studied pre-
viously.
Instead, our goal was to determine the
relative importance of modeling different contex-
tual factors, such as discourse-level information or
knowledge of the real-world environment, which
have not been studied extensively.

We considered three types of contextual in-
formation: discourse coherence information (in
particular anaphoric relations), knowledge of the
topic or domain, and real-world/multimodal infor-
mation. Anaphoric relations affect the translation
of referring expressions in cases where the source
and target languages make different grammatical
distinctions. For example, German makes more
morphological distinctions in noun phrases than
English. In order to correctly translate an expres-
sion like “the red one” the grammatical features
of the target language expression for the referent
need to be known. This is only possible if a suf-
ﬁciently large context is taken into account dur-
ing translation and if the reference is resolved cor-
rectly. Knowledge of the topic or domain is rele-
vant for correctly translating content words and is
closely related to the problem of word sense dis-
ambiguation. In our current setup, topic/domain
knowledge could be particularly helpful because
in-domain training data is lacking and many word
translations are obtained from generic dictionar-
ies that do not assign probabilities to compet-
ing translations. Finally, knowledge of the real-
world environment, such as objects in the room,
other speakers present, etc. determines translation
choices. If a speaker utters the expression “that
one” while pointing to an object, the correct trans-
lation might depend on the grammatical features

of the linguistic expression for that object; e.g. in
German, the translation could be “die da”, “der
da” or “das da”. Since the participants in our
meeting corpus use slides and supporting docu-
ments we expect to see some effect of such ex-
ophoric references to external objects.

In order to quantify the inﬂuence of contextual
information we manually analyzed the 1-best out-
put of System 5, identiﬁed those translation errors
that require knowledge of the topic/domain, larger
discourse, or external environment for their res-
olution, classiﬁed them into different categories,
and computed their relative frequencies. We then
corrected these errors in the translation output to
match at least one of the human references, in or-
der to assess the maximum possible improvement
in standard performance scores that could be ob-
tained from contextual modeling. The results are
shown in Tables 3 and 4. We observe that out of all
errors that can be related to the lack of contextual
knowledge, word sense confusions are by far the
most frequent. A smaller percentage of errors is
caused by anaphoric expressions. Contrary to our
expectations, we did not ﬁnd a strong impact of
exophoric references; however, there is one cru-
cial exception where real-world knowledge does
play an important role. This is the correct transla-
tion of the addressee you. In English, this form is
used for the second person singular, second per-
son plural, and the generic interpretation (as in
“one”, or “people”). German has three distinct
forms for these cases and, additionally, formal and
informal versions of the second-person pronouns.
The required formal/informal pronouns can only
be determined by prior knowledge of the rela-
tionships among the meeting participants. How-
ever, the singular-plural-generic distinction can
potentially be resolved by multimodal informa-

tion such as gaze, head turns, body movements,
or hand gestures of the current speaker. Since
these errors affect mostly single words as opposed
to larger phrases, the impact of the corrections on
BLEU/PER scores is not large. However, for prac-
tical applications (e.g. information extraction or
human browsing of meeting translations) the cor-
rect translation of content words and referring ex-
pressions would be very important. In the remain-
der of the paper we therefore describe initial ex-
periments designed to address the most important
source of contextual errors, viz. word sense con-
fusions.

5 Resolving Word Sense Disambiguation

Errors

The problem of word sense disambiguation
(WSD) in MT has received a fair amount of
attention before.
Initial experiments designed
at integrating a WSD component into an MT
system (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) did not meet
with success; however, WSD was subsequently
demonstrated to be successful in data-matched
conditions (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al.,
2007). The approach pursued by these latter ap-
proaches is to train a supervised word sense clas-
siﬁer on different phrase translation options pro-
vided by the phrase table of an initial baseline sys-
tem (i.e. the task is to separate different phrase
senses rather than word senses). The input fea-
tures to the classiﬁer consist of word features ob-
tained from the immediate context of the phrase
in questions, i.e. from the same sentence or from
the two or three preceding sentences. The classi-
ﬁer is usually trained only for those phrases that
are sufﬁciently frequent in the training data.

By contrast, our problem is quite different.
First, many of the translation errors caused by
choosing the wrong word sense relate to words
obtained from an external dictionary that do not

occur in the parallel training data; there is also lit-
tle in-domain training data available in general.
For these reasons,
training a supervised WSD
module is not an option without collecting addi-
tional data. Second, the relevant information for
resolving a word sense distinction is often not lo-
cated in the immediately surrounding context but
it is either at a more distant location in the dis-
course, or it is part of the participants’ background
knowledge. For example, in many meetings the
opening remarks refer to slides and an overhead
projector.
It is likely that subsequent mention-
ing of slide later on during the conversation also
refer to overhead slides (rather than e.g. slide in
the sense of “playground equipment”), though the
contextual features that could be used to identify
this word sense are not located in the immedi-
ately preceding sentences. Thus, in contrast to su-
pervised, local phrase sense disambiguation em-
ployed in previous work, we propose to utilize
unsupervised, global word sense disambiguation,
in order to obtain better modeling of the topic
and domain knowledge that is implicitly present
in meeting conversations.

5.1 Unsupervised Word Sense

Disambiguation

Unsupervised WSD algorithms have been pro-
posed previously (e.g. (Navigli and Lapata, 2007;
Cheng et al., 2009)). The general idea is to ex-
ploit measures of word similarity or relatedness
to jointly tag all words in a text with their correct
sense. We adopted the graph-based WSD method
proposed in (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007), which
represents all word senses in a text as nodes in an
undirected graph G = (V, E). Pairs of nodes are
linked by edges weighted by scores indicating the
similarity or relatedness of the words associated
with the nodes. Given such a graph, the likeli-
hood of each node is derived by the PageRank al-
gorithm (Brin and Page, 1998), which measures
the relative importance of each node to the entire
graph by considering the amount of “votes” the
node receives from its neighboring nodes. The
PageRank algorithm was originally designed for
directed graphs, but can be easily extended to an
undirected graph. Let P R(vi) denote the PageR-
ank score of vi. The PageRank algorithm itera-

1233

tively updates this score as follows:

P R(vi) = (1 − d) + d ∑(vi,vj )∈E

P R(vj)

wij∑k wkj

where wij is the similarity weight of the undi-
rected edge (vi, vj) and d is a damping factor,
which is typically set to 0.85 (Brin and Page,
1998). The outcome of the PageRank algorithm
is numerical weighting of each node in the graph.
The sense with the highest score for each word
identiﬁes its most likely word sense. For our
purposes, we modiﬁed the procedure as follows.
Given a document (meeting transcription), we ﬁrst
identify all content words in the source document.
The graph is then built over all target-language
translation candidates, i.e. each node represents a
word translation. Edges are then established be-
tween all pairs of nodes for which a word similar-
ity measure can be obtained.

5.2 Word Similarity Measures
We follow (Zesch et al., 2008a) in computing
the semantic similarity of German words by ex-
ploiting the Wikipedia and Wiktionary databases.
We use the publicly available toolkits JWPL and
JWKTL (Zesch et al., 2008b) to retrieve relevant
articles in Wikipedia and entries in Wiktionary for
each German word – these include the ﬁrst para-
graphs of Wikipedia articles entitled by the Ger-
man word, the content of Wiktionary entries of
the word itself as well as of closely related words
(hypernyms, hyponyms, synonyms, etc.). We then
concatenate all retrieved material for each word to
construct a pseudo-gloss. We then lowercase and
lemmatize the pseudo-glosses (using the lemma-
tizer available in the TextGrid package 6), exclude
function words by applying a simple stop-word
list, and compute a word similarity measure for
a given pair of words by counting the number of
common words in their glosses.

We need to point out that one drawback in this
approach is the low coverage of German content
words in the Wikipedia and Wiktionary databases.
Although the English edition contains millions
of entries, the German edition of Wikipedia and
Wiktionary is much smaller – the coverage of all
content words in our task ranges between 53% and

56%, depending on the meeting, which leads to
graphs with roughly 3K to 5K nodes and 8M to
13M edges. Words that are not covered mostly in-
clude rare words, technical terms, and compound
words.

5.3 Experiments and Results
For each meeting, the derived PageRank scores
were converted into a positive valued feature, re-
ferred to as the WSD feature, by normalization
and exponentiation:

fW SD(wg|we) = exp{

P R(wg)

∑wg∈H(we) P R(wg)}

where P R(wg) is the PageRank score for the Ger-
man word wg and H(we) is the set of all transla-
tion candidates for the English word we. Since
they are not modeled in the graph-based method,
multi-words phrases and words that are not found
in the Wikipedia or Wiktionary databases will re-
ceive the default value 1 for their WSD feature.
The WSD feature was then integrated into the
phrase table to perform translation. The new sys-
tem was optimized as before.

It should be emphasized that the standard mea-
sures of BLEU and PER give an inadequate im-
pression of translation quality, in particular be-
cause of the large variation among the reference
translations, as discussed in Section 4. In many
cases, better word sense disambiguation does not
result in better BLEU scores (since higher gram
matches are not affected) or even PER scores
because although a feasible translation has been
found it does not match any words in the refer-
ence translations. The best way of evaluating the
effect of WSD is to obtain human judgments –
however, since translation hypotheses change with
every change to the system, our original error an-
notation described in Section 4 cannot be re-used,
and time and resource constraints prevented us
from using manual evaluations at every step dur-
ing system development.

In order to loosen the restrictions imposed by
having only two reference translations, we uti-

approximating the larger space of feasible trans-
lations that could be obtained by producing addi-
tional human references. Note that the thesaurus
provided synonyms for only roughly 50% of all
content words in the dev and eval set. For each
of them, on average three synonyms are found in
the thesaurus. We use these extended references
to recompute the PER score as an indicator of
correct word selection. All results (BLEU, PER
and extended PER (or XPER)) are shown in Table
5. As expected, BLEU is not affected but WSD
improves the PER and XPER slightly but consis-
tently. Note that this is despite the fact that only
roughly half of all content words received disam-
biguation scores.

Finally, we provide a concrete example of
translation improvements, with improved words

6 Summary and Conclusions

We have presented a study on statistical transla-
tion of meeting data that makes the following con-
tributions: to our knowledge it presents the ﬁrst
quantitative analysis of contextual factors in the
statistical translation of multi-party spoken meet-
ings. This analysis showed that the largest im-
pact could be obtained in the area of word sense
disambiguation using topic and domain knowl-
edge, followed by multimodal information to re-
solve addressees of you. Contrary to our ex-
pectations, further knowledge of the real-world
environment (such as objects in the room) did
not show an effect on translation performance.
Second, it demonstrates the application of unsu-
pervised, global WSD to SMT, whereas previ-
ous work has focused on supervised, local WSD.
Third, it explores deﬁnitions derived from col-
laborative Wiki sources (rather than WordNet or
existing dictionaries) for use in machine transla-
tion. We demonstrated small but consistent im-
provements even though word coverage was in-
complete. Future work will be directed at improv-
ing word coverage for the WSD algorithm, in-
vestigating alternative word similarity measures,
and exploring the combination of global and local
WSD techniques.
