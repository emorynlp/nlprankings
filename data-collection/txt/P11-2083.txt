Abstract

We study in this paper the problem of enhanc-
ing the comparability of bilingual corpora in
order to improve the quality of bilingual lexi-
cons extracted from comparable corpora. We
introduce a clustering-based approach for en-
hancing corpus comparability which exploits
the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and
finally preserves most of the vocabulary of
the original corpus. Our experiments illus-
trate the well-foundedness of this method and
show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from
the homogeneous corpus are of better quality
than the lexicons obtained with previous ap-
proaches.

1 Introduction

Bilingual lexicons are an important resource in mul-
tilingual natural language processing tasks such as
statistical machine translation (Och and Ney, 2003)
and cross-language information retrieval (Balles-
teros and Croft, 1997). Because it is expensive to
manually build bilingual lexicons adapted to dif-
ferent domains, researchers have tried to automat-
ically extract bilingual lexicons from various cor-
pora. Compared with parallel corpora, it is much
easier to build high-volume comparable corpora, i.e.
corpora consisting of documents in different lan-
guages covering overlapping information. Several
studies have focused on the extraction of bilingual
lexicons from comparable corpora (Fung and McK-
eown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999;
Déjean et al., 2002; Gaussier et al., 2004; Robitaille
et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007; Garera et al., 2009;

Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Shezaf and Rappoport, 2010).
The basic assumption behind most studies on lex-
icon extraction from comparable corpora is a dis-
tributional hypothesis, stating that words which are
translation of each other are likely to appear in simi-
lar context across languages. On top of this hypoth-
esis, researchers have investigated the use of better
representations for word contexts, as well as the use
of different methods for matching words across lan-
guages. These approaches seem to have reached a
plateau in terms of performance. More recently, and
departing from such traditional approaches, we have
proposed in (Li and Gaussier, 2010) an approach
based on improving the comparability of the cor-
pus under consideration, prior to extracting bilingual
lexicons. This approach is interesting since there is
no point in trying to extract lexicons from a corpus
with a low degree of comparability, as the probabil-
ity of finding translations of any given word is low
in such cases. We follow here the same general idea
and aim, in a first step, at improving the compara-
bility of a given corpus while preserving most of
its vocabulary. However, unlike the previous work,
we show here that it is possible to guarantee a cer-
tain degree of homogeneity for the improved corpus,
and that this homogeneity translates into a signifi-
cant improvement of both the quality of the resulting
corpora and the bilingual lexicons extracted.

2 Enhancing Comparable Corpora: A
Clustering Approach

We first introduce in this section the comparability
measure proposed in former work, prior to describ-
ing the clustering-based algorithm to improve the

473



quality of a given comparable corpus. For conve-
nience, the following discussion will be made in the
context of the English-French comparable corpus.

2.1 The Comparability Measure

In order to measure the degree of comparability of
bilingual corpora, we make use of the measure M
developed in (Li and Gaussier, 2010): Given a com-
parable corpus P consisting of an English part Pe
and a French part Pf , the degree of comparability of
P is defined as the expectation of finding the trans-
lation of any given source/target word in the tar-
get/source corpus vocabulary. Let σ be a function
indicating whether a translation from the translation
set Tw of the word w is found in the vocabulary Pv
of a corpus P , i.e.:

σ(w,P) =
{

1 iff Tw ∩ Pv 6= ∅
0 else

and letD be a bilingual dictionary withDve denoting
its English vocabulary andDvf its French vocabulary.
The comparability measure M can be written as:

M(Pe,Pf ) (1)

=

∑
w∈Pe∩Dve σ(w,Pf ) +

∑
w∈Pf∩Dvf

σ(w,Pe)

#w(Pe ∩ Dve ) + #w(Pf ∩ Dvf )

where #w(P) denotes the number of different
words present in P . One can find from equa-
tion 1 that M directly measures the proportion of
source/target words translated in the target/source
vocabulary of P .

2.2 Clustering Documents for High Quality
Comparable Corpora

If a corpus covers a limited set of topics, it is more
likely to contain consistent information on the words
used (Morin et al., 2007), leading to improved bilin-
gual lexicons extracted with existing algorithms re-
lying on the distributional hypothesis. The term ho-
mogeneity directly refers to this fact, and we will say,
in an informal manner, that a corpus is homogeneous
if it covers a limited set of topics. The rationale for
the algorithm we introduce here to enhance corpus
comparability is precisely based on the concept of
homogeneity. In order to find document sets which
are similar with each other (i.e. homogeneous), it

is natural to resort to clustering techniques. Further-
more, since we need homogeneous corpora for bilin-
gual lexicon extraction, it will be convenient to rely
on techniques which allows one to easily prune less
relevant clusters. To perform all this, we use in this
work a standard hierarchical agglomerative cluster-
ing method.

2.2.1 Bilingual Clustering Algorithm

The overall process retained to build high quality,
homogeneous comparable corpora relies on the fol-
lowing steps:

1. Using the bilingual similarity measure defined
in Section 2.2.2, cluster English and French
documents so as to get bilingual dendrograms
from the original corpus P by grouping docu-
ments with related content;

2. Pick high quality sub-clusters by threshold-
ing the obtained dendrograms according to the
node depth, which retains nodes far from the
roots of the clustering trees;

3. Combine all these sub-clusters to form a new
comparable corpus PH , which thus contains
homogeneous, high-quality subparts;

4. Use again steps (1), (2) and (3) to enrich the
remaining subpart of P (denoted as PL, PL =
P \ PH ) with external resources.

The first three steps aim at extracting the most com-
parable and homogeneous subpart of P . Once this
has been done, one needs to resort to new corpora
if one wants to build an homogeneous corpus with
a high degree of comparability from PL. To do so,
we simply perform, in step (4), the clustering and
thresholding process defined in (1), (2) and (3) on
two comparable corpora: The first one consists of
the English part of PL and the French part of an ex-
ternal corpus PT ; The second one consists of the
French part of PL and the English part of PT . The
two high quality subparts obtained from these two
new comparable corpora in step (4) are then com-
bined with PH to constitute the final comparable
corpus of higher quality.

2.2.2 Similarity Measure
Let us assume that we have two document sets (i.e.
clusters) C1 and C2. In the task of bilingual lexi-
con extraction, two document sets are similar to each
other and should be clustered if the combination of
the two can complement the content of each single
set, which relates to the notion of homogeneity. In
other words, both the English part Ce1 of C1 and the
French part Cf1 of C1 should be comparable to their
counterparts (respectively the same for the French
part Cf2 of C2 and the English part Ce2 of C2). This
leads to the following similarity measure for C1 and
C2:

sim(C1, C2) = β ·M(Ce1, C
f
2 )+ (1−β) ·M(C

e
2, C

f
1 )

where β (0 ≤ β ≤ 1) is a weight controlling the
importance of the two subparts (Ce1 , C

f
2 ) and (Ce2 ,

Cf1 ). Intuitively, the larger one, containing more in-
formation, of the two comparable corpora (Ce1 , C

f
2 )

and (Ce2 , C
f
1 ) should dominate the overall similar-

ity sim(C1, C2). Since the content relatedness in the
comparable corpus is basically reflected by the re-
lations between all the possible bilingual document
pairs, we use here the number of document pairs to
represent the scale of the comparable corpus. The
weight β can thus be defined as the proportion of
possible document pairs in the current comparable
corpus (Ce1 , C

f
2 ) to all the possible document pairs,

which is:

β =
#d(Ce1) ·#d(C

f
2 )

#d(Ce1) ·#d(C
f
2 ) + #d(Ce2) ·#d(C

f
1 )

where #d(C) stands for the number of documents in
C. However, this measure does not integrate the rel-
ative length of the French and English parts, which
actually impacts the performance of bilingual lexi-
con extraction. If a 1-to-1 constraint is too strong
(i.e. assuming that all clusters should contain the
same number of English and French documents),
having completely unbalanced corpora is also not
desirable. We thus introduce a penalty function φ
aiming at penalizing unbalanced corpora:

φ(C) = 1
(1 + log(1 + |#d(C

e)−#d(Cf )|
min(#d(Ce)),#d(Cf ))

)
(2)

The above penalty function leads us to a new simi-
larity measure siml which is the one finally used in
the above algorithm:

siml(C1, C2) = sim(C1, C2) · φ(C1 ∪ C2) (3)

3 Experiments and Results

The experiments we have designed in this paper aim
at assessing (a) whether the clustering-based algo-
rithm we have introduced yields corpora of higher
quality in terms of comparability scores, and (b)
whether the bilingual lexicons extracted from such
corpora are of higher quality. Several corpora were
used in our experiments: the TREC1 Associated
Press corpus (AP, English) and the corpora used
in the CLEF2 campaign including the Los Ange-
les Times (LAT94, English), the Glasgow Herald
(GH95, English), Le Monde (MON94, French), SDA
French 94 (SDA94, French) and SDA French 95
(SDA95, French). In addition, two monolingual cor-
pora Wiki-En and Wiki-Fr were built by respectively
retrieving all the articles below the category Society
and Société from the Wikipedia dump files3. The
bilingual dictionary used in the experiments is con-
structed from an online dictionary. It consists of
33k distinct English words and 28k distinct French
words, constituting 76k translation pairs. In our ex-
periments, we use the method described in this pa-
per, as well as the one in (Li and Gaussier, 2010)
which is the only alternative method to enhance cor-
pus comparability.

3.1 Improving Corpus Quality
In this subsection, the clustering algorithm described
in Section 2.2.1 is employed to improve the quality
of the comparable corpus. The corpora GH95 and
SDA95 are used as the original corpus P0 (56k En-
glish documents and 42k French documents). We
consider two external corpora: P1T (109k English
documents and 87k French documents) consisting of
the corpora LAT94, MON94 and SDA94; P2T (368k
English documents and 378k French documents)
consisting of Wiki-En and Wiki-Fr.

Table 1: Performance of the bilingual lexicon extraction from different corpora (best results in bold)

After the clustering process, we obtain the result-
ing corpora P1 (with the external corpus P1T ) and
P2 (with P2T ). As mentioned before, we also used
the method described in (Li and Gaussier, 2010)
on the same data, producing resulting corpora P1′

(with P1T ) and P2
′ (with P2T ) from P0. In terms

of lexical coverage, P1 (resp. P2) covers 97.9%
(resp. 99.0%) of the vocabulary of P0. Hence, most
of the vocabulary of the original corpus has been
preserved. The comparability score of P1 reaches
0.924 and that of P2 is 0.939. Both corpora are
more comparable than P0 of which the comparabil-
ity is 0.881. Furthermore, both P1 and P2 are more
comparable than P1′ (comparability 0.912) and P2′

(comparability 0.915), which shows homogeneity is
crucial for comparability. The intrinsic evaluation
shows the efficiency of our approach which can im-
prove the quality of the given corpus while preserv-
ing most of its vocabulary.

3.2 Bilingual Lexicon Extraction Experiments

To extract bilingual lexicons from comparable cor-
pora, we directly use here the method proposed by
Fung and Yee (1998) which has been referred to
as the standard approach in more recent studies
(Déjean et al., 2002; Gaussier et al., 2004; Yu and
Tsujii, 2009). In this approach, each word w is rep-
resented as a context vector consisting of the words
co-occurring with w in a certain window in the cor-
pus. The context vectors in different languages are
then bridged with an existing bilingual dictionary.
Finally, a similarity score is given to any word pair
based on the cosine of their respective context vec-
tors.

3.2.1 Experiment Settings
In order to measure the performance of the lexi-
cons extracted, we follow the common practice by
dividing the bilingual dictionary into 2 parts: 10%
of the English words (3,338 words) together with
their translations are randomly chosen and used as
the evaluation set, the remaining words being used

to compute the similarity of context vectors. En-
glish words not present in Pe or with no translation
in Pf are excluded from the evaluation set. For each
English word in the evaluation set, all the French
words in Pf are then ranked according to their sim-
ilarity with the English word. Precision and recall
are then computed on the first N translation candi-
date lists. The precision amounts in this case to the
proportion of lists containing the correct translation
(in case of multiple translations, a list is deemed to
contain the correct translation as soon as one of the
possible translations is present). The recall is the
proportion of correct translations found in the lists
to all the translations in the corpus. This evaluation
procedure has been used in previous studies and is
now standard.

3.2.2 Results and Analysis
In a first series of experiments, bilingual lexicons
were extracted from the corpora obtained by our ap-
proach (P1 and P2), the corpora obtained by the
approach described in (Li and Gaussier, 2010) (P1′

and P2′) and the original corpus P0, with the fixed
N value set to 20. Table 1 displays the results ob-
tained. Each of the last two columns “P1 > P0”
and “P2 > P0” contains the absolute and the rel-
ative difference (in %) w.r.t. P0. As one can note,
the best results (in bold) are obtained from the cor-
pora P2 built with the method we have described in
this paper. The lexicons extracted from the enhanced
corpora are of much higher quality than the ones ob-
tained from the original corpus . For instance, the
increase of the precision is 6.9% (30.5% relatively)
in P1 and 23.5% (104.0% relatively) in P2, com-
pared with P0. The difference is more remarkable
withP2, which is obtained from a large external cor-
pus P2T . Intuitively, one can expect to find, in larger
corpora, more documents related to a given corpus,
an intuition which seems to be confirmed by our re-
sults. One can also notice, by comparing P2 and
P2′ as well as P1 and P1′, a remarkable improve-
ment when considering our approach and the early

476



methodology.
Intuitively, the value N plays an important role

in the above experiments. In a second series of ex-
periments, we let N vary from 1 to 300 and plot the
results obtained with different evaluation measure in
Figure 1. In Figure 1(a) (resp. Figure 1(b)), the x-
axis corresponds to the values taken by N, and the y-
axis to the precision (resp. recall) scores for the lexi-
cons extracted on each of the 5 corporaP0,P1′,P2′,
P1 and P2. A clear fact from the figure is that both
the precision and the recall scores increase accord-
ing to the increase of the N values, which coincides
with our intuition. As one can note, our method con-
sistently outperforms the previous work and also the
original corpus on all the values considered for N .

4 Discussion

As previous studies on bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion from comparable corpora radically differ on
resources used and technical choices, it is very
difficult to compare them in a unified framework
(Laroche and Langlais, 2010). We compare in this
section our method with some ones in the same vein
(i.e. enhancing bilingual corpora prior to extract-
ing bilingual lexicons from them). Some works like
(Munteanu et al., 2004) and (Munteanu and Marcu,
2006) propose methods to extract parallel fragments
from comparable corpora. However, their approach
only focuses on a very small part of the original cor-
pus, whereas our work aims at preserving most of
the vocabulary of the original corpus.

We have followed here the general approach in
(Li and Gaussier, 2010) which consists in enhancing
the quality of a comparable corpus prior to extract-
ing information from it. However, despite this latter
work, we have shown here a method which ensures
homogeneity of the obtained corpus, and which fi-
nally leads to comparable corpora of higher quality.
In turn such corpora yield better bilingual lexicons
extracted.
