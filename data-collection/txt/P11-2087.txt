Abstract

We present a method for lexical simplifica-
tion. Simplification rules are learned from a
comparable corpus, and the rules are applied
in a context-aware fashion to input sentences.
Our method is unsupervised. Furthermore, it
does not require any alignment or correspon-
dence among the complex and simple corpora.
We evaluate the simplification according to
three criteria: preservation of grammaticality,
preservation of meaning, and degree of sim-
plification. Results show that our method out-
performs an established simplification base-
line for both meaning preservation and sim-
plification, while maintaining a high level of
grammaticality.

1 Introduction

The task of simplification consists of editing an in-
put text into a version that is less complex linguisti-
cally or more readable. Automated sentence sim-
plification has been investigated mostly as a pre-
processing step with the goal of improving NLP
tasks, such as parsing (Chandrasekar et al., 1996;
Siddharthan, 2004; Jonnalagadda et al., 2009), se-
mantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008) and
summarization (Blake et al., 2007). Automated sim-
plification can also be considered as a way to help
end users access relevant information, which would
be too complex to understand if left unedited. As
such, it was proposed as a tool for adults with
aphasia (Carroll et al., 1998; Devlin and Unthank,
2006), hearing-impaired people (Daelemans et al.,
2004), readers with low-literacy skills (Williams and
Reiter, 2005), individuals with intellectual disabil-
ities (Huenerfauth et al., 2009), as well as health

consumers looking for medical information (El-
hadad and Sutaria, 2007; Deléger and Zweigen-
baum, 2009).

Simplification can take place at different levels of
a text – its overall document structure, the syntax
of its sentences, and the individual phrases or words
in a sentence. In this paper, we present a sentence
simplification approach, which focuses on lexical
simplification.1 The key contributions of our work
are (i) an unsupervised method for learning pairs of
complex and simpler synonyms; and (ii) a context-
aware method for substituting one for the other.

Figure 1 shows an example input sentence. The
word magnate is determined as a candidate for sim-
plification. Two learned rules are available to the
simplification system (substitute magnate with king
or with businessman). In the context of this sen-
tence, the second rule is selected, resulting in the
simpler output sentence.

Our method contributes to research on lexical
simplification (both learning of rules and actual sen-
tence simplification), a topic little investigated thus
far. From a technical perspective, the task of lexi-
cal simplification bears similarity with that of para-

phrase identification (Androutsopoulos and Malaka-
siotis, 2010) and the SemEval-2007 English Lexi-
cal Substitution Task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007).
However, these do not consider issues of readabil-
ity and linguistic complexity. Our methods lever-
age a large comparable collection of texts: En-
glish Wikipedia2 and Simple English Wikipedia3.
Napoles and Dredze (2010) examined Wikipedia
Simple articles looking for features that characterize
a simple text, with the hope of informing research
in automatic simplification methods. Yatskar et al.
(2010) learn lexical simplification rules from the edit
histories of Wikipedia Simple articles. Our method
differs from theirs, as we rely on the two corpora as a
whole, and do not require any aligned or designated
simple/complex sentences when learning simplifica-
tion rules.4

2 Data

We rely on two collections – English Wikipedia
(EW) and Simple English Wikipedia (SEW). SEW
is a Wikipedia project providing articles in Sim-
ple English, a version of English which uses fewer
words and easier grammar, and which aims to be
easier to read for children, people who are learning
English and people with learning difficulties. Due to
the labor involved in simplifying Wikipedia articles,
only about 2% of the EW articles have been simpli-
fied.

Our method does not assume any specific align-
ment or correspondance between individual EW and
SEW articles. Rather, we leverage SEW only as
an example of an in-domain simple corpus, in or-
der to extract word frequency estimates. Further-
more, we do not make use of any special properties
of Wikipedia (e.g., edit histories). In practice, this
means that our method is suitable for other cases
where there exists a simplified corpus in the same
domain.

The corpora are a snapshot as of April 23, 2010.
EW contains 3,266,245 articles, and SEW contains
60,100 articles. The articles were preprocessed as
follows: all comments, HTML tags, and Wiki links
were removed. Text contained in tables and figures

was excluded, leaving only the main body text of
the article. Further preprocessing was carried out
with the Stanford NLP Package5 to tokenize the text,
transform all words to lower case, and identify sen-
tence boundaries.

3 Method

Our sentence simplification system consists of two
main stages: rule extraction and simplification. In
the first stage, simplification rules are extracted from
the corpora. Each rule consists of an ordered word
pair {original→ simplified} along with a score indi-
cating the similarity between the words. In the sec-
ond stage, the system decides whether to apply a rule
(i.e., transform the original word into the simplified
one), based on the contextual information.

3.1 Stage 1: Learning Simplification Rules
3.1.1 Obtaining Word Pairs

All content words in the English Wikipedia Cor-
pus (excluding stop words, numbers, and punctua-
tion) were considered as candidates for simplifica-
tion. For each candidate word w, we constructed a
context vectorCVw, containing co-occurrence infor-
mation within a 10-token window. Each dimension
i in the vector corresponds to a single word wi in
the vocabulary, and a single dimension was added to
represent any number token. The value in each di-
mension CVw[i] of the vector was the number of oc-
currences of the corresponding wordwi within a ten-
token window surrounding an instance of the candi-
date word w. Values below a cutoff (2 in our exper-
iments) were discarded to reduce noise and increase
performance.

Next, we consider candidates for substitution.
From all possible word pairs (the Cartesian product
of all words in the corpus vocabulary), we first re-
move pairs of morphological variants. For this pur-
pose, we use MorphAdorner6 for lemmatization, re-
moving words which share a common lemma. We
also prune pairs where one word is a prefix of the
other and the suffix is in {s, es, ed, ly, er, ing}. This
handles some cases which are not covered by Mor-
phAdorner. We use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) as
a primary semantic filter. From all remaining word
pairs, we select those in which the second word, in

its first sense (as listed in WordNet)7 is a synonym
or hypernym of the first.

Finally, we compute the cosine similarity scores
for the remaining pairs using their context vectors.

3.1.2 Ensuring Simplification
From among our remaining candidate word pairs,

we want to identify those that represent a complex
word which can be replaced by a simpler one. Our
definition of the complexity of a word is based on
two measures: the corpus complexity and the lexical
complexity. Specifically, we define the corpus com-
plexity of a word as

Cw =
fw,English
fw,Simple

where fw,c is the frequency of word w in corpus c,
and the lexical complexity as Lw = |w|, the length
of the word. The final complexity χw for the word
is given by the product of the two.

χw = Cw × Lw

After calculating the complexity of all words par-
ticipating in the word pairs, we discard the pairs for
which the first word’s complexity is lower than that
of the second. The remaining pairs constitute the
final list of substitution candidates.

3.1.3 Ensuring Grammaticality
To ensure that our simplification substitutions

maintain the grammaticality of the original sentence,
we generate grammatically consistent rules from
the substitution candidate list. For each candidate
pair (original, simplified), we generate all consis-
tent forms (fi(original), fi(substitute)) of the two
words using MorphAdorner. For verbs, we create
the forms for all possible combinations of tenses and
persons, and for nouns we create forms for both sin-
gular and plural.

For example, the word pair (stride, walk) will gen-
erate the form pairs (stride, walk), (striding, walk-
ing), (strode, walked) and (strides, walks). Signifi-
cantly, the word pair (stride, walked) will generate

7Senses in WordNet are listed in order of frequency. Rather
than attempting explicit disambiguation and adding complex-
ity to the model, we rely on the first sense heuristic, which is
know to be very strong, along with contextual information, as
described in Section 3.2.

exactly the same list of form pairs, eliminating the
original ungrammatical pair.

Finally, each pair (fi(original), fi(substitute)) be-
comes a rule {fi(original) → fi(substitute)},
with weight Similarity(original, substitute).

3.2 Stage 2: Sentence Simplification
Given an input sentence and the set of rules learned
in the first stage, this stage determines which words
in the sentence should be simplified, and applies
the corresponding rules. The rules are not applied
blindly, however; the context of the input sentence
influences the simplification in two ways:

Word-Sentence Similarity First, we want to en-
sure that the more complex word, which we are at-
tempting to simplify, was not used precisely because
of its complexity - to emphasize a nuance or for its
specific shade of meaning. For example, suppose we
have a rule {Han→ Chinese}. We would want to
apply it to a sentence such as “In 1368 Han rebels
drove out the Mongols”, but to avoid applying it to
a sentence like “The history of the Han ethnic group
is closely tied to that of China”. The existence of
related words like ethnic and China are clues that
the latter sentence is in a specific, rather than gen-
eral, context and therefore a more general and sim-
pler hypernym is unsuitable. To identify such cases,
we calculate the similarity between the target word
(the candidate for replacement) and the input sen-
tence as a whole. If this similarity is too high, it
might be better not to simplify the original word.

Context Similarity The second factor has to do
with ambiguity. We wish to detect and avoid cases
where a word appears in the sentence with a differ-
ent sense than the one originally considered when
creating the simplification rule. For this purpose, we
examine the similarity between the rule as a whole
(including both the original and the substitute words,
and their associated context vectors) and the context
of the input sentence. If the similarity is high, it is
likely the original word in the sentence and the rule
are about the same sense.

3.2.1 Simplification Procedure
Both factors described above require sufficient

context in the input sentence. Therefore, our sys-
tem does not attempt to simplify sentences with less
than seven content words.

Type Gram. Mean. Simp.
Baseline 70.23(+13.10)% 55.95% 46.43%
System 77.91(+8.14)% 62.79% 75.58%

Table 1: Average scores in three categories: grammatical-
ity (Gram.), meaning preservation (Mean.) and simplifi-
cation (Simp.). For grammaticality, we show percent of
examples judged as good, with ok percent in parentheses.

For all other sentences, each content word is ex-
amined in order, ignoring words inside quotation
marks or parentheses. For each word w, the set of
relevant simplification rules {w → x} is retrieved.
For each rule {w → x}, unless the replacement
word x already appears in the sentence, our system
does the following:

• Build the vector of sentence context SCVs,w in a
similar manner to that described in Section 3.1,
using the words in a 10-token window surround-
ing w in the input sentence.
• Calculate the cosine similarity of CVw and
SCVs,w. If this value is larger than a manually
specified threshold (0.1 in our experiments), do
not use this rule.
• Create a common context vector CCVw,x for the

rule {w → x}. The vector contains all fea-
tures common to both words, with the feature
values that are the minimum between them. In
other words, CCVw,x[i] = min(CVw[i], CVx[i]).
We calculate the cosine similarity of the common
context vector and the sentence context vector:

ContextSim = cosine(CCVw,x, SCVs,w)

If the context similarity is larger than a threshold
(0.01), we use this rule to simplify.

If multiple rules apply for the same word, we use
the one with the highest context similarity.

4 Experimental Setup

Baseline We employ the method of Devlin and
Unthank (2006) which replaces a word with its most
frequent synonym (presumed to be the simplest) as
our baseline. To provide a fairer comparison to our
system, we add the restriction that the synonyms
should not share a prefix of four or more letters
(a baseline version of lemmatization) and use Mor-
phAdorner to produce a form that agrees with that
of the original word.

Type Freq. Gram. Mean. Simp.
Base High 63.33(+20)% 46.67% 50%
Sys. High 76.67(+6.66)% 63.33% 73.33%
Base Med 75(+7.14)% 67.86% 42.86%
Sys. Med 72.41(+17.25)% 75.86% 82.76%
Base Low 73.08(+11.54)% 53.85% 46.15%
Sys. Low 85.19(+0)% 48.15% 70.37%

Evaluation Dataset We sampled simplification
examples for manual evaluation with the following
criteria. Among all sentences in English Wikipedia,
we first extracted those where our system chose to
simplify exactly one word, to provide a straightfor-
ward example for the human judges. Of these, we
chose the sentences where the baseline could also
be used to simplify the target word (i.e., the word
had a more frequent synonym), and the baseline re-
placement was different from the system choice. We
included only a single example (simplified sentence)
for each rule.

The evaluation dataset contained 65 sentences.
Each was simplified by our system and the baseline,
resulting in 130 simplification examples (consisting
of an original and a simplified sentence).

Frequency Bands Although we included only a
single example of each rule, some rules could be
applied much more frequently than others, as the
words and associated contexts were common in the
dataset. Since this factor strongly influences the
utility of the system, we examined the performance
along different frequency bands. We split the eval-
uation dataset into three frequency bands of roughly
equal size, resulting in 46 high, 44 med and 40 low.

Judgment Guidelines We divided the simplifica-
tion examples among three annotators 8 and ensured
that no annotator saw both the system and baseline
examples for the same sentence. Each simplification
example was rated on three scales: Grammaticality
- bad, ok, or good; Meaning - did the transforma-
tion preserve the original meaning of the sentence;
and Simplification - did the transformation result in

8The annotators were native English speakers and were not
the authors of this paper. A small portion of the sentence pairs
were duplicated among annotators to calculate pairwise inter-
annotator agreement. Agreement was moderate in all categories
(Cohen’s Kappa = .350− .455 for Simplicity, .475− .530 for
Meaning and .415− .425 for Grammaticality).

a simpler sentence.

5 Results and Discussion

Table 1 shows the overall results for the experiment.
Our method is quantitatively better than the base-
line at both grammaticality and meaning preserva-
tion, although the difference is not statistically sig-
nificant. For our main goal of simplification, our
method significantly (p < 0.001) outperforms the
baseline, which represents the established simplifi-
cation strategy of substituting a word with its most
frequent WordNet synonym. The results demon-
strate the value of correctly representing and ad-
dressing content when attempting automatic simpli-
fication.

Table 2 contains the results for each of the fre-
quency bands. Grammaticality is not strongly influ-
enced by frequency, and remains between 80-85%
for both the baseline and our system (considering
the ok judgment as positive). This is not surpris-
ing, since the method for ensuring grammaticality is
largely independent of context, and relies mostly on
a morphological engine. Simplification varies some-
what with frequency, with the best results for the
medium frequency band. In all bands, our system is
significantly better than the baseline. The most no-
ticeable effect is for preservation of meaning. Here,
the performance of the system (and the baseline) is
the best for the medium frequency group. However,
the performance drops significantly for the low fre-
quency band. This is most likely due to sparsity of
data. Since there are few examples from which to
learn, the system is unable to effectively distinguish
between different contexts and meanings of the word
being simplified, and applies the simplification rule
incorrectly.

These results indicate our system can be effec-
tively used for simplification of words that occur
frequently in the domain. In many scenarios, these
are precisely the cases where simplification is most
desirable. For rare words, it may be advisable to
maintain the more complex form, to ensure that the
meaning is preserved.

Future Work Because the method does not place
any restrictions on the complex and simple corpora,
we plan to validate it on different domains and ex-
pect it to be easily portable. We also plan to extend

our method to larger spans of texts, beyond individ-
ual words.
